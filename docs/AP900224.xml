<HEAD>Lawyers Announce Settlement of Families' Lawsuits</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Drake Memorial Hospital has paid $2.3 million
to settle all lawsuits filed by families of 26 patients that former
nurse's aide Donald Harvey confessed to killing, lawyers announced
Friday.
   Lawyers for the hospital and the families will ask county Common
Pleas Judge William Morrissey to dismiss the lawsuits, said James
Burke, a lawyer asked by Hamilton County commissioners to help
negotiate the settlement.
   The lawsuits were filed after Harvey pleaded guilty, beginning
in August 1987, to 37 murders in Ohio and Kentucky. The victims
also included patients at Marymount Hospital in London, Ky., where
Harvey worked in 1970 and 1971.
   Harvey, who said he killed his victims by poisoning them or
suffocating them with plastic bags, is serving three consecutive
life sentences in an Ohio prison.
   The hospital did not admit any wrongdoing in the deaths. Lawyers
said Drake officials reached the settlement to avert a trial.
   ``The plaintiffs continue to believe in their position, and the
defendants continue to deny that they are legally responsible for
Harvey's actions,'' lawyers for both sides said in a joint
statement.
   At the time of the murders to which Harvey confessed, Drake
Hospital was owned by Hamilton County. The hospital sold its assets
to the University of Cincinnati in July 1989 and is now known as
Drake Center Inc.
   The settlement does not affect Drake Center, Burke said.
   A lawyer for the families of eight of Harvey's victims, Paul
Martins, said of the settlement, ``I think it's fair, in weighing
everything. It certainly doesn't compensate for all of the loss.
The reason to settle is, from a practical standpoint, not putting
these poor people through a trial.''
   Martins said the families also obtained an agreement through
which they could collect damages of as much as $11 million from
Harvey should he ever earn money from movies or books about the
murders.

   The space shuttle Atlantis should be
visible along much of the East Coast, provided the skies are clear,
as it hurtles into the highest inclination orbit ever traveled by a
shuttle.
   The shuttle will be carrying a spy satellite that will venture
300 miles farther north and 300 miles farther south than any other
shutle-lanched payload, according to sources who asked not to be
identified.
   After three postponements, Atlantis is scheduled to lift off
about 1 a.m. Sunday.
   The shuttle is expected to take a northeasterly course that will
fly east of Cape Hatteras in North Carolina and hug the coast. The
three main engines should burn out just east of New Jersey, with
the shuttle flying over Newfoundland on a 62-degree inclination.
   If it is a clear morning, the fiery launch should be visible to
many Floridians. The shuttle will resemble a shooting star to
onlookers up the coast from Jacksonville.

   Two Navy training planes collided in the
air Friday, killing an instructor and student pilot in one of the
aircraft, said a spokesman at Whiting Field, Fla., where the planes
were based.
   Those killed were aboard a T-34C Turbo Mentor that crashed into
the edge of a Navy training field here at about 11:30 a.m., said
Petty Officer 1st Class Jon Gagne.
   The second plane, also a T-34C, made an emergency landing at
another outlying field near Silverhill about five miles northwest
of this small South Alabama town. The pilots were uninjured.
   The dead men were identified as an instructor, Navy Lt. Gordon
Bruce Wulf, 29, a Wichita, Kan., native who resides in Cantonment,
Fla., and a student, Marine 1st Lt. Cary K. Smith, 25, of Columbia,
S.C.
   It was not immediately known whether Wulf or Smith was flying
the plane during the routine training flight, Gagne said.
   The Summerdale field is used to practice takeoffs and landings,
Gagne said, but details of the crash and what the planes were doing
when the collision occurred were not immediately available.
   The T-34Cs are two-seat, single-engine, turboprop planes used
for primary flight training at Whiting, about 35 miles northeast of
Pensacola, Fla. The Navy has several outlying fields in the Florida
Panhandle and Southwest Alabama where students practice taking off
and landing.
   The planes and crews were from Training Squadron 6, which is
part of Training Air Wing 5.
   Only two days before the crash, a national television audience
had a chance to see a T-34C in action during the ABC program ``Good
Morning America,'' which was telecast Wednesday from the Pensacola
Naval Air Station. A camera was trained on host Charlie Gibson in
the back seat of a T-34.

<HEAD>Carol's Brother: Family's Faith in People Restored by Donations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The brother of Carol Stuart said his parents are
still devastated over her death, but their faith in people has been
restored by the donations that continue to arrive for a foundation
established in her name.
   But in the nearly two months since 37-year-old Carl DiMaiti and
his parents learned that Charles Stuart probably plotted his wife's
death and told some family members before committing suicide, they
have yet to receive an apology from the Stuarts.
   ``Nothing, there's been nothing,'' said DiMaiti in the first
formal interview he has given since Charles Stuart apparently
jumped off Boston's Tobin Bridge to his death Jan. 4.
   DiMaiti spoke Friday, the day after the FBI began a preliminary
inquiry into the Boston Police Department investigation surrounding
the slaying of Carol Stuart. The investigation focuses on
allegations that police intimidated and coerced several people into
implicating William Bennett in the Oct. 23 crime.
   The Suffolk County grand jury met Friday for the fourth time
since Charles Stuart's death. Reportedly appearing before the panel
were three of Stuart's siblings _ Neysa Porter, Shelley Yandoli and
Michael Stuart.
   Carl DiMaiti, a former high school teacher who now runs the
family pizza dough business, said the family still is angry about
the slaying of his sister and the Stuart family's silence.
   But DiMaiti said the family has found new hope in the Carol
DiMaiti Stuart Foundation formed last month. The foundation was
established to award scholarships to residents of the Mission Hill
neighborhood where Charles Stuart had told police that a black
gunman shot him and critically wounded his pregnant wife.
   Carol Stuart died shortly after the shooting and the couple's
son, delivered by Caesarean section, died 17 days later.
   Contributions totaling $253,000 have poured in from around the
country, the latest a check for $5,122.40 from New England Baptist
Hospital. Many letters are addressed simply to ``DiMaiti Family,
Medford, Mass.,'' DiMaiti said. And many are from people who also
experienced the loss of a loved one, he said.
   ``They said the pain will ease,'' DiMaiti said. ``They say it's
something you never get over but it does get better.''
   DiMaiti described his mother as still devastated by the death of
her daughter but said the letters and contributions from as far
away as California and overseas have helped restore her faith in
people.
   Giusto, 64, and Evelyn DiMaiti, 58, have declined to speak
publicly about the case except for a speech the elder DiMaiti made
during a press conference last month announcing that the foundation
would be set up.
   Representatives of a public relations company hired by the
families monitored Friday's interview and tried to prevent DiMaiti
from answering questions other than general comments about the
foundation.
   DiMaiti declined to comment on the FBI's inquiry into the manner
in which Boston police handled the case.

   A county sheriff who shocked state
officials when he seized a National Guard armory to house prisoners
from his overcrowded jail has won the right to keep them there for
at least two more weeks.
   The decision came at a hearing Friday that followed a weeklong
standoff between the state and the sheriff, who argued that he had
a choice between seizing the armory or turning prisoners out on the
streets.
   ``I just felt I couldn't take it any more and it was important
to take a strong step,'' Hampden County Sheriff Michael Ashe said
after Friday's hearing.
   Ashe agreed to allow the National Guard to keep operating from
the building. Superior Court Judge George Keady set a March 12
court date for both sides to report back with a permanent solution.
If they don't, Keady will hold a hearing on Ashe's earlier request
for a preliminary injunction to stay at the armory.
   ``I think what we wanted to do is keep it on the front burner
but turn down the heat,'' said Lawrence Fletcher-Hill, assistant
attorney general.
   ``We're putting the issue of the sheriff's actions to the side.
It's more important that we find a solution,'' he said.
   The sheriff shocked state officials Feb. 16, when he moved on
the armory, informing National Guardsmen he was seizing the
building under a 17th century statute ordering him to keep the
peace.
   State officials at first reacted angrily. Secretary of Public
Safety Charles V. Barry, who has jurisdiction over armories in the
state, issued a statement saying he would pursue criminal trespass
charges against Ashe.
   The state had argued that Ashe is a county official and does not
have the right to take state property.
   After Ashe won a temporary restraining order allowing him to
stay at the armory, along with widespread support from residents,
local officials and even prisoners, the focus turned to trying to
work out a compromise location for the prisoners.
   Officials would not specify what locations they are considering
for overflow prisoners. A new jail to replace the county's
102-year-old jail is scheduled to be built in nearby Ludlow, but
completion is at least two years away.
   Nineteen inmates are currently housed in the armory, in a large
room with a concrete floor and a volleyball net stretched between
two walls. Previously it was used for drill exercises by the
National Guard.
   Inmates have said the armory is an improvement over the Hampden
County Jail, which was built to hold 279 inmates and is under a
federal court order to hold no more than 500 inmates.
   Ashe said he's pleased at his initial success in finding at
least a temporary solution to his problem.
   ``I really feel good that we're able to keep on fighting,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   ``The New Class,'' a 1957 indictment
of Communist elites that was popular in the West but earned its
Yugoslav author seven years in prison, has gone on sale for the
first time in Yugoslavia.
   Milovan Djilas' book was printed by a state publishing house and
was presented to the public Friday in a Belgrade bookshop.
   Djilas, 78, a protege of Yugoslavia's founder and former
president, Josip Broz Tito, broke with the Communist leadership in
1954 after he publicly criticized the Communist Party for not
allowing more Western-style democracy in Yugoslavia.
   After ``The New Class'' was smuggled out of the country and
printed in the West, the state press accused of being a Western spy
and a traitor to his country and to Communism.
   He was jailed for seven years.
   ``The New Class,'' which describes the flamboyant lifestyles of
ruling Communist elites, reflected Djilas' disillusionment with the
Communist system.
   Later works, including ``Conversations with Stalin,'' also were
sharply critical of Communist doctrine and practices and banned in
Yugoslavia during Tito's lifetime.
   Three years ago, several of his less-controversial literary
works were published in this country. Numerous interviews with him
have also been printed by the press since then and he has
frequently appeared on television.
   Earlir this month, Djilas figured prominently at the nationally
televised founding congress in Belgrade of the reconstituted
Democratic Party.
   As a senior Communist leader in charge of propaganda, Djilas had
helped run the Democrats out of Parliament in 1946.

   Actor John Cusack was arrested for
driving under the influence of alcohol after crashing a rented
vehicle, authorities said.
   Cusack, 23, star of the movie ``Say Anything,'' was arrested
early Friday after his rented Jeep broadsided another car, Los
Angeles County sheriff's Deputy George Moak said.
   His blood-alcohol level was measured above the legal limit of
.08 percent, said Moak, who declined to say what the exact level
was. The Chicago native was released later Friday with a citation
to appear in court.
   Moak said Cusack's car made a left turn into another car, and a
sheriff's deputy driving directly behind Cusack witnessed the
crash. When the deputy stopped to assist the accident victims he
smelled alcohol on Cusack's breath, he said.
   Moak said Cusack was ``very cooperative.'' The driver of the car
Cusack hit wasn't injured.
   In ``Say Anything,'' Cusack played a young man in love with a
girl from the better side of the tracks. He was featured first in
Rob Reiner's 1985 comedy ``The Sure Thing.''

   Hightower, a two-term populist Democrat, has sent out a

for money to combat campaigning by the Texas Farm Bureau, a private

said Nelson, who last year testified for Hightower when the
Legislature considered turning the commissioner's elected job into

   Eric Ramirez knows he's bound to lose
in Sunday's presidential elections, but the Social Christian Party
candidate hopes to become an important factor in political
developments following the election.
   Ramirez, the candidate of the Social Christian party, believes
President Daniel Ortega of the governing leftist Sandinistas will
win with about 50 percent of the vote.
   He thinks Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's United National
Opposition, a broad coalition known as UNO, will come in second
with about 35 percent.
   There are seven other candidates in the election. Ramirez is the
only one expected to draw a significant percentage of the vote.
   Ramirez, 43, sees the election as a landmark in the history of
Nicaragua ``with changes coming no matter who wins.''
   ``The opposition made a serious mistake when it didn't run six
years ago. We could have exercised a lot of pressure through the
Assembly all these years,'' he said in an interview.
   Many opposition parties, including the Social Christians and an
earlier broad coalition like UNO, refused to take part in a vote
overwhelmingly won by the Sandinistas.
   This time around, the UNO coalition wanted Ramirez to join, but
he refused to go along.
   He said the 14-party coalition, an odd mixture ranging from the
Communist Party to conservative elements of the Private Business
Council, will fall apart under the pressure of specific political
decisions.
   ``Some of those people, especially the Communists and the
Socialists, if they get someone elected to the Assembly, will vote
with the FSLN (Sandinistas), not with the Private Business people.''
   Losing presidential candidates who get a certain number of votes
_ the number is set by a complicated formula but will probably be
about 15,000 _ get a seat in the National Assembly.
   Ramirez hopes to lead six or seven other Social Christians in
what would be a 99-member Assembly if all presidential losers gain
seats.
   That could make the Social Christians an important party,
because Ramirez and some others see UNO splitting into its many
political components to seek temporary alliances.
   ``You have the United States providing money to the UNO that
will probably elect two members of the Communist party, who already
are talking to the FSLN,'' Ramirez said, using initials of the
Sandinista National Liberation Front. He was referring to U.S.
economic aid to the UNO.
   ``We can become the second largest single political party in the
Assembly,'' after the Sandinistas, he said.
   Bayardo Arce, Ortega's campaign manager, said he agreed with
Ramirez on both points: the Social Christians will win six to seven
seats and end up as the second largest party.
   Ramirez calls himself a centrist who believes the United States
should stop sponsoring Contra guerrillas who have fought a war to
topple the government.
   ``Reality will force both the United States and the Sandinistas
to become pragmatic and seek an accommodation,'' Ramirez said.

   Key international observers say they
expect Sunday's national elections to be free and fair, despite
problems during the often bitter campaign.
   ``I've given a lot of thought to how the system could be beat,''
said former U.S. attorney general Elliott Richardson, who heads a
U.N. observer mission. ``I haven't yet been able to come up with a
good scheme.''
   A U.N. report he released Friday concludes that Nicaragua's 1.75
million registered voters ``are in a position to decide between
alternatives which have been given a reasonable chance to be
aired.''
   The campaign was not without problems, it said, but it ``has
changed the way elections are perceived ... by redefining and
considerably broadening the limits of political action in
Nicaragua.''
   The Organization of American States reached similar conclusions
about the possibility of a fair election on Sunday, as did former
President Jimmy Carter.
   Carter is heading up a group of international observers that
includes five U.S. senators and seven House members, three former
state governors, a prime minister and five former presidents.
   Carter, who cried foul in the Panamanian election last year
while the votes were still being counted, is regarded as one of the
most influential observers.
   His delegation is working closely with both the Organization of
American States and the United Nations, which among them are
fielding more than 700 observers.
   ``We will monitor every step of the process and do parallel
tabulations of the vote to guarantee that the final results reflect
the will of the people,'' Carter said after arriving in Nicaragua
on Friday.
   The governing leftist Sandinistas expect to win the election,
and they hope an internationally recognized victory will lead to an
end to the U.S. economic embargo and U.S. support for the Contra
rebels.
   The verdict of the observers from Carter's Atlanta-based Council
of Freely Elected Heads of Government is considered crucial to a
change in attitude by the Bush administration.
   Rep. Jim Slattery, a Kansas Democrat, said an honest election
could pave the way to a new U.S. policy on Nicaragua.
   ``If the election is free and fair and if the Nicaraguan
government ceases any further attempt to export revolution and stir
up trouble in El Salvador, then I think the American government
should honor the will of the Nicaraguan people and move toward
improving economic relations and diplomatic relations,'' said
Slattery, one of the observers.
   The Nicaraguan government has previously said it is not
supplying weapons to the Salvadoran guerrillas. President Daniel
Ortega has signed a regional accord pledging not to provide such
aid.
   In today's editions of the New York Times, he was quoted as
saying he would not provide arms to them after the elections if he
is re-elected, and he called El Salvador's rightist government
``legitimate.''
   Ortega's main challenger is publisher Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro of the United National Opposition or UNO, a coalition of
14 parties and one native Indian group.
   Despite their generally optimistic conclusions, the key
observers all concede there have been problems, including violence
in the early days of the campaign, intimidation, limited opposition
access to the state-controlled media, and the control of other
resources by the Sandinistas.
   The U.N. report says the problems have diminished in the final
days of the campaign even though ``the question of free electoral
competition will no doubt be the subject of controversy.''
   Virgilio Godoy, UNO's vice presidential candidate, said Friday
the coalition would recognize a Sandinista victory if it is honest.

   Steven Magee, a University of Texas-Austin professor who was an
economist in the Nixon administration, said Friday the country's
500,000 lawyers are dampening the gross national product by $500
billion, or about 10 percent.
   Magee theorizes that the effect is caused by wealthy
corporations and individuals who hire lawyers to ``get their hands
into each others pockets.''
   These findings are part of a book Magee co-authored titled
``Black Hole Tariffs and Endogenous Policy Theory.''

<HEAD>Congress, Administration Square Off Over Dropped Pentagon Projects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress may be headed toward a legislative or
legal confrontation with the Bush administration over $1.25 billion
in Pentagon projects the administration wants to put on hold.
   Armed with a new General Accounting Office opinion, several
members of Congress urged the Bush administration Friday to
reconsider its postponement of the 15 projects, which had been
previously approved for 1990 funding.
   The administration's reasoning in announcing the delays earlier
this month was too vague to meet legal requirements, Milton J.
Soccolar, the special assistant to the head of the GAO, said in an
opinion.
   ``The administration's entire explanation of the deferrals is
that they are necessary because of `changes in requirements in view
of the promising developments in the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe,'' Soccolar wrote Wednesday to Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va,
chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. The GAO is an
investigative arm of Congress.
   ``This is not the detailed, reasoned explanation for the
deferrals which section 1013 (of the relevant law) requires. It is
no more than a generalized assertion,'' he wrote.
   The postponed projects include aircraft modifications, Navy ship
conversions expected to be a boon to many coastal states, defense
software research and Army, Army Reserve and Air National Guard
construction projects.
   The appropriations panel released a letter Friday in which Byrd
and the panel's ranking Republican, Sen. Mark Hatfield of Oregon,
asked budget director Richard Darman to reconsider the
postponements.
   ``In light of these findings by the GAO, we urge the
administration to withdraw immediately any and all deferrals, other
than those that involve the routine withholding of funds in
connection with the normal and orderly operation of the
government,'' Byrd and Hatfield said.
   Among the postponed projects was a $3.2 million access road for
the Tobyhanna Army Depot in northeastern Pennsylvania.
   Reps. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., and Joseph McDade, R-Pa., wrote
Bush on Friday saying such projects should not be written off in
the drive for budget savings as a result of emerging democracy in
Eastern Europe.
   ``We fail to see the relationship and linkage between recent
international events and a pressing public works project that has
been planned for several years,'' they said.
   The Office of Management and Budget said Friday it would have no
immediate comment on the issue.
   Presidents routinely ask Congress to delay billions of dollars
of planned spending each year. By law, those requests _ called
deferrals _ are permissible because of unexpected contingencies or
a chance to save money through better management.
   But delays are not allowable for policy reasons. They can be
blocked by a majority vote of either chamber, or by a civil suit
filed by the head of the GAO. Senate appropriations officials said
they hoped the issue could be resolved without court action.
   The GAO said its study showed $1.25 billion was being improperly
deferred by the administration.

<HEAD>Supporters Say Jackson Won't Run for D.C. Mayor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson, facing signs city voters are
wary that he will run for mayor in the wake of Mayor Marion Barry's
drug arrest, has told supporters he won't seek Barry's job,
associates say.
   ``He's not going to run for mayor of Washington. We talked about
it yesterday,'' Joel Ferguson, who managed Jackson's 1988
presidential campaign in Michigan, told a Lansing, Mich.,
television station Friday.
   Jackson, a two-time Democratic presidential contender, was en
route to Chicago on Friday evening. There was no answer at his
Chicago home.
   Jackson's political plans have been the subject of speculation
since he moved to the nation's capital in April. That speculation
intensified with Barry's arrest last month on a cocaine possession
charge.
   Jackson has said his recent campaign to gain statehood for the
District of Columbia will remain his priority. He has said he will
formally announce next week he will not run for mayor, associates
said.
   A top Jackson aide, Frank Watkins, refused Friday to discuss
Jackson's decision on the mayoral race.
   ``One of the reasons Jesse would run for anything, like mayor of
a major city, is to come in as a healer,'' Ferguson told station
WKAR. ``In a way, his candidacy would be viewed as divisive.''
   Ferguson estimated the chance that Jackson would run at only 10
percent, but another supporter said Jackson told him flatly that he
would not run.
   ``Jesse is out,'' said the supporter, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``He has decided that it would be wrong for him to get
into the race at this time, or at all.''
   Barry is at a South Carolina hospital for treatment for what
aides as called an alcohol problem. City Administrator Carol
Thompson is running the city in Barry's absence.
   Jackson's apparent decision comes amid growing signs that voters
_ and politicians _ are wary of a Jackson mayoral bid.
   A Washington Post poll released Thursday reported Jackson would
trail Barry if both were candidates in the September Democratic
primary.
   Jackson has repeatedly refused to rule out a run for Barry's
job, saying he would only seek the office if Barry, a colleague in
the civil rights battle, did not run for a fourth term.
   Jeffrey N. Gildenhorn, a Barry fund-raiser, said Jackson
associates told him that a mayoral candidacy was extremely unlikely.
   ``There were strong indications from his people that (Jackson's
decision not to run) was just a formality that needed to be
announced,'' Gildenhorn said. ``I started hearing that last week.''
   Barry has been silent since his arrest on his plans for
re-election. Aides close to the mayor have said Barry acknowledged
privately the weekend after his arrest that he would not run again.
   The Washington Post poll of 800 District residents found that
Barry was preferred by 25 percent of those surveyed, while 19
percent said they would vote for Jackson. If Barry weren't in the
race, Jackson would receive support from 26 percent of those
questioned compared with 19 percent for city Councilman John Ray.
   The poll had a margin of error of 4 percentage points.

<HEAD>Final Charges Dropped Against Three Men in Contra Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The remaining federal indictments against three men
who were already cleared of charges that they illegally armed and
trained the Contras have been dismissed, a defense attorney said.
   Charges involving weapons or passport violations were dropped
against former mercenery Jack Terrell, former Civilian Materiel
Assistance activist Jose Coutin and Rene Corvo, an opponent of
Cuba's Fidel Castro.
   ``It's the first clear victory for the whistleblowers in this
whole affair,'' said Terrell's attorney, John Mattes, describing
the decision to drop the charges.
   The three and 10 other people were indicted by a federal grand
jury in 1988 on charges of violating the U.S. Neutrality Act for
allegedly assisting the Nicaraguan Contras in 1984 and 1985.
   Two Fort Lauderdale federal judges dismissed those charges,
agreeing with defense attorneys that the U.S. government waged war
against Nicaragua despite congressional votes to cut off funds to
the U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   The Neutrality Act allows prosecution of anyone making war from
U.S. soil against a nation with which the United States is at peace.
   The U.S. attorney's office said Friday the lesser charges had
been dropped against Terrell, Coutin and Corvo, said Mattes. The
rest of the defendants already had been cleared completely.
   ``Obviously, the government felt the charges of harassment and
selective prosecution were too sensitive,'' Mattes said. ``And I
think they were fearful of disclosing illegal wiretaps in this
case.''
   The U.S. attorney's office did not return telephone calls Friday
from The Associated Press.
   Terrell had become disenchanted with the Contras in 1986, and
his information helped lead to the two indictments. Terrell's
revelations to the FBI angered then-National Security Agency aide
Oliver North, and North ordered the former mercenary investigated,
according to later congressional investigations into the
Iran-Contra scandal.
   Mattes said it was ironic that Terrell faced the strongest
charges _ a possible 40-year prison sentence _ in a case which he
had helped bring about.
   The last of the charges dropped against Terrell were two counts
of illegally transporting weapons. A charge of allowing someone
else to use his passport was dropped against Coutin. The dismissed
charges against Corvo accused him of shipping a 20mm cannon, a
mortar and other weapons from Fort Lauderdale to Contra bases in
Costa Rica under the guise of humanitarian aid.

<HEAD>Democrats to Push Own Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell says
Democrats are impatient with the slow progress of a bipartisan
House task force on campaign finance reform and will push a vote in
the Senate next month on their own legislation.
   Mitchell, D-Maine, said the Senate Rules Committee will approve
a bill in early March and the full Senate will take it up later in
the month.
   Mitchell, joined at a news conference by House Speaker Thomas S.
Foley, D-Wash., cast doubt on prospects for a bipartisan bill that
includes spending ceilings.
   ``As public demand for reform rises, we ought to be able to come
together and bridge our differences,'' Mitchell said. ``If we
cannot do so, then we will proceed to attempt to enact a bill in
any event ... over whatever opposition exists.''
   Foley said the 21-member House task force of members from both
parties that was created last year will continue its work. But he
acknowledged the task force is not going to find a package
agreeable to both parties.
   ``We hope there will be some of the bill at least that could be
bipartisan,'' he said. ``We will clearly have differences.''
   Democrats had hoped to see what the task force produced before
tackling the campaign finance issue again in the Senate, where the
last effort to toughen the law died in 1988 under a GOP filibuster.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole has remained noncommittal on
the issue. And Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska, the senior Republican on
the Senate Rules Committee, said at a hearing Thursday, ``I don't
think our side of the aisle is going to change.''
   Mitchell acknowledged allegations against six senators accused
of intervening with federal thrift regulators or housing officials
on behalf of campaign contributors is the driving force behind the
legislation.
   ``Many Americans believe that their elected representatives are
more responsive to campaign contributors than to constituents,'' he
said. ``The perception is that fundraising has overtaken the
election process (and) it is demeaning this institution.''
   Mitchell and Democratic Sens. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia
and David Boren of Oklahoma are cosponsoring a bill limiting
contributions by political action committees or PACs and
individuals to national and state party organizations.
   As an incentive to comply with voluntary spending ceilings, one
draft provides that candidates who remain under the limit would be
entitled to discount mail and TV advertising rates.
   The Democratic bill also would require more disclosure of
so-called ``soft money'' contributions from labor unions, trade
associations and individuals to party organizations and for other
campaign causes.
   Mitchell said he still favors public financing of political
campaigns but conceded there is not enough support to get it
enacted.

<HEAD>Bush Names Arthur Fletcher to Head Civil Rights Commission</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush wants Arthur A. Fletcher to
restore the Civil Rights Commission as ``an effective institution''
after years in which civil rights groups said the commission wasn't
doing its job.
   ``We think they can do a better job,'' White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Friday in announcing Fletcher's
selection.
   Fletcher, 65, is a moderate black Republican who has served in
three previous GOP administrations.
   Bush sought to give him the post nearly a year ago, but the
chairman of the commission, William B. Allen, wouldn't resign at
the time.
   Civil rights groups and members of Congress have criticized the
commission for its positions during the Reagan administration,
including opposition to affirmative action programs.
   Fletcher was assistant secretary of labor under President Nixon,
deputy assistant for urban affairs under President Ford and an
adviser to President Reagan. He also served with Bush at the United
Nations in 1971.
   In announcing Fletcher's nomination on Friday, Fitzwater said,
``We wanted to name a new chairman and reinvigorate the commission,
but we had to have a vacancy to do it.''
   Allen, the former chairman, indicated that he would not
voluntarily step aside when reports first surfaced that Bush wanted
to select Fletcher as the commission chairman. But he did resign
late last year with a blast at Bush, calling his administration
``too reticent ... to contribute to the debate on civil rights.''
   Fitzwater said Bush wants to see the commission restored as ``an
effective institution.''
   ``We have felt that it could be stronger and more forceful in
representing the concerns of minorities and others. We expect it to
operate in that fashion,'' the spokesman said.
   Fitzwater said another vacancy on the eight-member commission
will be filled soon. The president and Congress each appoint four
members.
   The commission was established in 1957. It evaluates federal
laws and the effectiveness of the government's equal-opportunity
programs and serves as a clearinghouse for civil rights information.
   Allen's tenure at the agency was marked by controversy and
confrontation with other commissioners. A speech he delivered last
year titled ``Blacks? Animals? Homosexuals? What is a Minority?''
was formally condemned as ``thoughtless, disgusting and
unnecessarily inflammatory'' on a 6-1 vote of the commission.
   An Arizona native, Fletcher was executive director of the United
Negro College Fund in 1972-73. In 1971, he was alternate delegate
to the General Assembly of the United Nations.

   The European Economic Community is considering
granting the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe associate
membership to encourage their economic reforms.
   Frans Andriessen, vice president for external affairs and trade
policy of the European Community, said the western democracies
needed to do everything possible to encourage the dramatic pace of
reforms under way in the former Communist bloc.
   ``If in the West, we persevere in our efforts to assist them,
then an economic revolution will succeed the political ones,''
Andriessen said Friday.
   The 12-nation community has already expanded its economic help
beyond the original targets of Poland and Hungary to include East
Germany, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania and Yugoslavia.
   But Andriessen said the community is also studying going beyond
grants ``to anchor these new Eastern democracies to the Free World
through a form of association with the European Community if they
want to.''
   Andriessen's comments came in a speech to a business conference.
Afterwards, he told reporters that the proposal would be reviewed
further before being taken up by the community's policy-making body
in late June or July.
   In a fact sheet, the community said associate membership could
be granted to countries to recognize their ``geographic proximity,
shared political, economic and cultural values and increased
interdependence.''
   It suggested that one model for such association would be the
existing European Free Trade Association _ Austria, Finland,
Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland _ who are not members of
the European Economic Community but who enjoy certain economic ties
with the EEC.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills, who also addressed the
conference, said that though the United States is negotiating trade
agreements with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, completely
normal trade relations would not occur until those countries became
full members in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the
96-country organization that regulates world trade.
   To join GATT, she said, these countries will have to clear the
major hurdle of making their currencies convertible into other
currencies and base their economies on market pricing rather than
pricing by government decree.

   Supporters of legal abortions say the defeat
of anti-abortion bills in Indiana and a veto of one in Michigan
show lawmakers are proving reluctant to impose new restrictions.
   Pro-choice leaders also hailed the defeat of bills this week in
the Virginia and Kansas legislatures, and the adjournment of Utah's
legislature without passing any anti-abortion bill.
   ``This week's events are irrefutable proof that the pro-choice
majority will mount significant opposition to the serious threat to
choice that still exists in America's statehouses,'' Kate
Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights
Action League, said Friday.
   Nancy Myers, spokeswoman for the anti-abortion National Right to
Life Committee, acknowledged her group had suffered setbacks in
several states this week. But she said it succeeded in winning
passage in South Carolina of a bill requiring a parent's permission
for a minor woman to receive an abortion.
   ``It's tremendously exciting,'' Myers said. ``Things are
happening everywhere. It's only February. State legislatures are
still in session. We've got a long time before we see how the chips
are going to fall.''
   Much of the political fight over abortion is being waged in the
statehouses this winter as anti-abortion forces try to take
advantage of an opening given them by the Supreme Court's Webster
decision last year. It gave states new authority to impose limits
on a woman's right to an abortion by upholding a Missouri law.
   Michelman plans to travel to Minnesota next week, where her side
expects a legislative showdown over a bill that would prohibit
abortions as a means of birth control _ a provision that would
prevent most abortions.
   Both sides say Alabama's legislature may be a key battleground
next week, with floor action possible on similar anti-abortion
legislation.
   In Indianapolis, the state Senate defeated legislation Thursday
to ban abortions in public hospitals.
   ``We're not going to be debating this issue again in the Indiana
Senate during this session,'' said Dinah Farrington, a lobbyist for
Planned Parenthood Inc., which supports legal abortions.
   In Michigan, Democratic Gov. Jim Blanchard on Friday vetoed a
bill that would have required minors to get permission either from
their parents or a court before having an abortion. His veto had
been expected.
   Blanchard said he supported parental involvement in such
decisions but that the bill ``takes a woman's right to help herself
away from her.''
   Myers, spokeswoman for the national anti-abortion group, said it
had assurances that South Carolina's Republican Gov. Carroll
Campbell would sign a similar bill passed in his state.
   Officials at NARAL, the national abortion-rights lobbying group
in Washington, also cited the defeat in Virginia's state Senate of
a similar parental-consent bill and the Kansas legislature's defeat
of abortion restrictions.
   They pointed to the adjournment of the legislature in Utah,
saying it represented a victory for them in a state where only two
months ago odds had looked good for the imposition of abortion
restrictions.
   ``We have not won the war by any stretch,'' Michelman said. ``We
have a long way to go, ... but we are making gains and politicians
are feeling our strength.

   As an 8-month-old boy cuts his teeth and
makes new gurgling sounds, a judge is deciding who the baby will
call ``Mommy'' and ``Daddy'' in place of parents who died on an
earthquake-smashed freeway.
   The baby's parents dropped Jimmy Brown off at his
great-grandmother's home on Oct. 17 as they headed to a Berkeley
pier to go fishing with friends. They never saw the baby again.
   Michelle Richard, 18, and 21-year-old James Brown III, a high
school student and her unemployed lover, died when the
7.1-magnitude quake twisted an elevated portion of freeway on which
they traveled into a mangled mess of collapsed concrete and steel.
A total of 67 people lost their lives in the temblor, most of them
on the freeway.
   The quake left their baby at the center of an intense emotional
and legal tug-of-war. Several bereaved relatives stepped forward
seeking custody of Jimmy, who stands to collect at least $100,000
from a state-controlled account compensating relatives of the
freeway victims.
   The state Board of Control has delayed awarding the claim until
Alameda County Superior Judge Roderic Duncan decides which
relative, set of relatives or outsiders will care for Jimmy.
   Hearings are set for April 13 and 22.
   Walnut Creek attorney Peter Hinton, one of two lawyers
representing maternal grandmother Anita Williams, complained that
``bigoted'' media coverage of the family squabbles has been
``almost like a rape case; they're being subjected to a public
scrutiny in a very unfair way.''
   ``The tragedy is being overlooked,'' he said.
   In making his decision, Duncan will have to sift through
allegations of drug and alcohol abuse, fingerpointing about
criminal records, teen-age sex and cycles of poverty.
   The parties seeking custody are:
   _Maternal grandmother Williams, 35, who has three other
children, a three-bedroom townhouse and income derived solely from
welfare; Jimmy's been staying primarily with her since the
earthquake.
   ``She's being portrayed as welfare trash,'' said Hinton, who
added that the only time Williams accepted welfare is when she was
unable to collect support money from her children's father.
   _Jimmy's paternal grandfather and his wife, who have a hauling
and landscape business in Oakland. James Brown II served a recent
prison term for theft. His son also did time in jail for possession
last April of crack cocaine for sale.
   _Great-grandmother Louise Brown, a 65-year-old family matriarch
who said she raised Jimmy's father almost like one of her own sons,
and probably spent more time looking after the baby than did either
one of his parents.
   ``I thought that eventually they would get hurt or something bad
would happen to them,'' Mrs. Brown said of Jimmy's parents, who she
said had hung around with ``nothing but bad actors.''
   Although critical of Michelle's family for what she called lack
of discipline and other problems, Mrs. Brown said she favors Anita
Williams adopting Jimmy if she takes good care of him and allows
other relatives to visit.
   The court also could place Jimmy with a foster family or
unrelated adoptive parents. Two county family service counselors
are investigating the situation.
   S. Simone Campbell, a state-appointed attorney representing
Jimmy, said, ``We're hoping that another family member surfaces.
   ``Everything's wide open at this point,'' said Campbell, a
Catholic nun. ``Every one of the parties have their strengths and
weaknesses, but enough weaknesses that I have some concerns.''
   Campbell said applications for the state compensation apparently
led the family reluctantly into court, unable any more to pass
Jimmy around between homes of various relatives without serious
disputes.
   She said Jimmy showed no apparent ``dramatic problems'' and
described him as ``laughing and giggly and doing things that
8-month-old kids seem to do.''
   ``This much pain hopefully will give rise to something good
eventually,'' Campbell said.

   The leader of Nicaragua's rebel military forces
predicts the nation's Sandinista government will remain in control
no matter what the outcome of Sunday's elections.
   The United National Opposition coalition is given little hope of
ousting the 11-year-old Sandinista government, but even an upset
victory would face difficulty overcoming ``an armed party,'' as
Israel Galeano called the Sandinistas.
   ``It is one thing for UNO to win _ it's another for them to
succeed in their objectives,'' said the commander, who has led the
rebel movement since the old civilian directorate was abolished and
rival Enrique Bermudez was pushed aside.
   Galeano, who used the name Commander Franklin, noted that the
Sandinistas have refused to give absentee votes to an estimated
700,000 exiled Nicaraguans _ more than 20 percent of the Central
American nation's population _ or the 7,000 Contra troops he said
are still camped inside Nicaragua.
   The Contras' skepticism toward the elections is mirrored by many
exiles in Miami, where few of the 50,000 exiles are making plans to
return home.
   ``The goal of these people is to get their family out,'' said
volunteer Donald Baldizol at the Nicaraguan Assistance Center on
Friday. ``They are poor people, and they don't see any future
there.''
   Prominent Nicaraguan exiles agree that even in the best of
cases, there will be no mass reintegration of the exiles into
Nicaraguan life.
   Roberto Arguello, president of the Nicaraguan American Bankers
Association and a member of the U.S. Senate Task Force on Hispanic
Affairs, said he expects 100,000 more Nicaraguans to stream into
the United States.
   ``When they see they have Daniel Ortega for another five years,
they will leave,'' said Arguello.
   He said that in 10 years of Sandinista rule, the average income
has slipped to 1950 levels.
   ``In another 10 years it will be down to the 1920s,'' the banker
said.
   A few Nicaraguans here say although skepticism is merited, there
is at least a little hope that UNO candidate Violeta Chamorro can
win and exiles can return home.
   ``You cannot get mangoes from apple trees, and the Sandinista
record certainly does not lend itself to having a credibile
election,'' said Adolfo Calero, former Contra leader who now works
for the Nicaraguan American Foundation. ``But it would be a great
advancement if she won, and she could eventually achieve real
power, with the support of the people.''
   Calero said he had wanted to return to Nicaragua to participate
in the elections, but was denied a passport by the Sandinistas.
   ``If Violeta wins, I will seriously consider going back,'' he
said. And even if the Sandinistas win, there is chance that
pragmatically, they will have to move closer to the United States.
   ``Win or lose, the Sandinistas are bound to lose,'' Calero said.
``The only unknown factor is time. They cannot run against the
world current and remain untouched.''

<HEAD>Cyprus Ferry To Lebanon Hit by Shellfire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A passenger ferry carrying 116 people was
hit by shellfire today off the coast of Lebanon and two passengers
were killed, Cypriot police reported.
   They said 14 people were wounded in the attack, which started at
least one fire on board.
   Initial reports indicated a Syrian naval vessel fired on the
passenger ferry when it was eight miles off Lebanon, said marine
police in the port of Larnaca.
   The ferry was steaming from the east Mediterranean island of
Cyprus to the Lebanese port of Jounieh, the police said. There has
been fighting near Journieh between rival Christian forces.
   The agents for the ferry, Socomare, had no immediate comment on
damage to the vessel.
   Helicopters were being sent to the boat to take off the wounded
passengers, police said.
   Police said there were 64 passengers and 52 crew members on the
ship.
   The ferry is one of the main escape routes for embattled
Lebanese Christians, many now fleeing from three weeks of fighting
between the rival Christian forces of army General Michel Aoun and
Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia.
   The captain and crew of the ship had been reluctant to take it
into Jounieh because of the risks involved in the intra-Christian
battle.
   The port in the Christian enclave is 120 miles from Cyprus, a
seven-hour journey.

   It's a mounted patrol
Florida-style: cops on jet skis.
   A Broward County deputy was to begin patrols today aboard a
specially equipped jet ski with police ensign and flashing light.
   The craft, similar to a seagoing snowmobile, will travel along
the Intracoastal Waterway, canals and lagoons searching for
reckless and improper jet ski operators.
   ``Jet skis are increasing popular ... and as more people become
involved with them, we have to become more cognizant about
safety,'' said deputy John D'Agostino, who tested the police jet
ski Friday.
   In Florida last year, 85 jet-ski accidents resulted in six
deaths.
   Beneath his life jacket, D'Agostino will wear a short-sleeve
white shirt, police-issue green shorts, black diving booties _ and
a pistol in a holster.

<HEAD>Exxon Valdez Skipper Says He Drank Iced Tea, Beer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shortly after the Exxon Valdez ran
aground, Joseph Hazelwood insisted to investigators that he drank
nothing stronger than a beer during a day ashore preceding the
accident.
   Jurors heard a tape Friday of Hazelwood's account told to a
Coast Guard investigator. He gave a scenario of his shore visit
which was nearly identical to that depicted by witnesses at his
criminal trial except for one crucial detail _ the drinking.
   Witnesses have said that Hazelwood spent at least part of the
afternoon of March 23 at the Pipeline Club in Valdez drinking
vodka. Hazelwood said it wasn't so.
   The muffled tape played for the jury showed that the skipper was
being questioned about alcohol use 13 hours after the 987-foot
tanker ran aground on Bligh Reef, unleashing the nation's worst oil
spill.
   ``There have been some suggestions and statements concerning the
fact that, ah, that you had some alcohol or an odor of alcohol on
you, do you?'' asked Coast Guard investigator Mark Delozier.
Delozier has testified he smelled alcohol on Hazelwood's breath.
   ``Well, I had one of those phony beers, `Moussy,' and I'd been
ashore,'' Hazelwood responded. ``I had lunch ... drank iced tea.''
   He said he finished lunch with some fellow officers in Valdez at
about 2 p.m. ``I did a little shopping, got some post cards and
sent some flowers to my wife for Easter and picked up some pizza to
bring back to the ship with us,'' he said.
   ``Did you stop at any other establishments in town, liquor
places or bars?'' asked Delozier.
   ``Well, we went by the Pipeline (Club) to see if anybody off the
ship was in there, if we knew anybody. ... Nobody there so we left
and picked up the pizza,'' he said.
   He denied drinking anything at the Valdez bar where witnesses
said they saw him ordering vodka.
   Hazelwood said he had one ``real'' beer before boarding the ship
and one or two ``phony,'' nearly non-alcoholic, beers before the
Exxon Valdez sailed.
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is charged with
second-degree criminal mischief, a felony; and three misdemeanors,
reckless endangerment, operating a vessel while intoxicated and
negligent discharge of oil.
   The Exxon Valdez, with a crewman at the helm and Hazelwood off
the bridge, struck a reef in Prince William Sound and leaked nearly
11 million gallons of Alaska crude oil. The spill blackened
hundreds of miles of rocky coastline and killed countless birds,
fish and other wildlife.
   Moussy beer was permitted aboard Exxon ships while other alcohol
was banned.
   Testimony resumes on Monday.

<TEXT>
   A prominent black businessman who purchased a
bankrupt college founded by freed slaves and missionaries called on
the city's black community to help him make the school a success
again.
   ``I waited until the last minute for someone or some group to
come through and buy it,'' said Comer Cottrell, after buying the
Bishop College's entire 130-acre campus on Friday. ``But no one
floated to the surface.
   ``It would have been a real blow to the developing black
community here if the school was dissolved. Now we need a
commitment from the blacks that they will help make it work.''
   Cottrell bought the college for $1.5 million in a liquidation
auction.
   Sobbing with joy, Cottrell called the acquisition of Dallas'
only predominantly black college his ``moral duty.''
   Cottrell owns Dallas-based Pro-Line Corp., the nation's 18th
largest black-owned company, which sells more than $30 million a
year in hair-care products for blacks.
   ``What happened to the school is criminal,'' Cottrell said. ``As
the past vice chairman of the school, I had to go through the
agony, pain and heartache of the demise of the college.''
   Cottrell said he will reopen the 108-year-old school as soon as
a board of trustees is in place and construction crews clean up the
decaying campus.
   ``We will turn the institution around to benefit the whole of
the community _ especially the black youth,'' he said.
   Cottrell, 58, opened the bidding at $1.2 million Friday
afternoon and said after purchasing the college that he had been
willing to go even higher.
   ``I was prepared to pay $5 million, so $1.5 (million) is quite a
bargain,'' he said.
   The auction lasted less than five minutes. Cottrell was one of
two bidders, but officials refused to release the name of the other
bidder.
   Bishop College, which is named after Union Army Col. Nathan
Bishop, a white man, was founded in Marshall, Texas, in 1881 by
nine freed slaves and a group of Baptist missionaries.
   The college was moved to Dallas from Marshall in 1961.
   State senator Eddie Bernice Johnson of Dallas said last week
state school officials are investigating whether the institution
should be resurrected as a teacher's college.
   Cottrell, who received an honorary degree from Bishop, said the
school will maintain its name, but he was unsure if the school
would become a teacher's college or remain an undergraduate
institution.
   ``As long as it serves the black community, that's all that
matters,'' he said.
   The school, which suffered from bungled management for more than
a decade, was closed in August 1988 by a federal bankruptcy judge
after the school failed to raise enough money to subsist.
   Bob Mottern, an attorney representing Duke Salisbury, the
trustee appointed to oversee the liquidation of Bishop's assets,
said the money from the sale will go to pay legal fees and salaries
of employees released when the school closed down.
   Cottrell said he is seeking investors to help him pay for the
school.

   Hundreds of mourners today thronged a church
to pay respects to former President Jose Napoleon Duarte, who tried
and failed to ease the searing class divisions that sparked a
crippling, decade-old civil war.
   Duarte died at his home Friday after a long battle with cancer.
He was 64.
   Two of Duarte's six children, Alejandro and Napoleon,
accompanied by leaders of the Christian Democratic Party he helped
found, carried his flag-draped coffin to the Don Rua Roman Catholic
church in the blue-collar neighborhood of San Miguelito.
   Military school cadets escorted the procession.
   About 500 mourners, many carrying flowers, awaited them at the
church, where Duarte's body was to lie in state until the funeral
Sunday.
   Mourners, many of them poor, continued to arrive early today
while hundreds of others blocked streets outside the church. Police
cordoned off the area.
   ``Duarte was everything for us, the women of the markets, for
all the poor. .. For us he will live forever,'' said one woman
trying to reach the coffin. She asked not to be identified.
   U.S. and regional leaders praised Duarte's dedication to
democracy.
   ``President Duarte was the father of Salvadoran democracy, a
dedicated servant to the people of El Salvador, and a firm friend
of the United States,'' said a statement issued in Washington by
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Vice President Dan Quayle will lead the U.S. delegation at
Duarte's funeral, the White House said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said, ``There could be no
more fitting tribute to his memory than for his countrymen to
follow his lead and to ensure that human rights and democratic
institutions grow and strengthen in the country he loved so deeply
and to which he gave so much.''
   Duarte was born in San Salvador Nov. 23, 1925, the second of
three sons of a tailor father and dressmaker mother.
   He graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1948 with a
degree in civil engineering, married a childhood friend, Ines
Duran, and worked in her family's construction business.
   He served three terms as mayor of San Salvador. He was winning
the presidential election in February 1972 when the army stopped
the count and declared its candidate the winner.
   After supporting a failed coup attempt a few weeks later, Duarte
was arrested, beaten and sent into exile in Venezuela, where he
spent more than seven years.
   After reform-minded military officers seized power in a 1979
coup, Duarte returned to El Salvador, and in 1980 he became
president of the ruling junta.
   Duarte tried to institute a land reform and other economic
changes but these were hampered by growing violence from leftist
guerrillas, the military, and military-linked rightists _ all of
whom tried to destabilize his fragile government.
   Elected president in 1984, Duarte enjoyed wide popularity and
opened peace talks with the guerrillas that year.
   The negotiations failed, however, and a plague of problems that
accompanied the war _ accusations of corruption, economic failure,
a devastating 1986 earthquake, parching drought _ overwhelmed his
government.
   In May 1988, doctors diagnosed the cancer and removed 60 percent
of Duarte's stomach, but the disease had spread to his liver. They
gave him from six to 18 months to live.
   He finished his five-year term, but his last public appearance
was the inauguration last year of his successor, Alfredo Cristiani,
the rightist president whose party represented the oligarchy Duarte
had struggled against.
   Duarte's death, said Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez,
``leaves a gap in the ranks of the great forgers of Latin American
democracy and most especially in Central America.''
   Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, head of El Salvador's armed forces
chiefs of staff, said history would remember Duarte as ``a fighter
who had all the forces necessary to carry out a democratic
process.''
   ``It is the loss of a person who fought all his life for the
democratization of the country,'' Ponce said as he arrived at the
church.
   Ricardo Alvarenga, president of the Legislative Assembly and a
member of the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance that
defeated Duarte's party in 1988 and 1989 elections, had no praise
for Duarte even in death.
   ``Today we political adversaries aren't going to slight him,''
Alvarenga said. ``He will be judged by God and I hope God will have
forgiven him.''
   A high-ranking U.S. diplomat who served in El Salvador during
most of Duarte's term said of him: ``He didn't work miracles, but
he must be credited with instituting the democratic system itself.
His great legacy is the transition. The rest pales by comparison.''

   A man convicted of killing 27 people in
the nation's worst drunken-driving accident was sentenced to 16
years in prison, but one crash survivor said he should have been
sent to jail for life.
   ``Sixteen years does not take the place of the friends I lost,''
said Tammy Darnell, breaking down in tears after Larry Mahoney was
sentenced on Friday.
   Mahoney was quiet during the sentencing, but many of his
relatives burst into tears. His 7-year-old daughter, Shawna, a
victim of spina bifida, began wailing after the sentence was read.
   Mahoney, 36, can be eligible for parole in eight years.
   Carroll Circuit Judge Charles Satterwhite denied a defense
motion to place Mahoney on probation and handed down the sentence
recommended by the jury, which convicted him more than two months
ago.
   Telling the packed courtroom that while few may remember what is
said at the hearing, ``I doubt that anyone will ever forget what
brought us here.''
   The defense plans to appeal.
   On May 14, 1988, Mahoney slammed into the front of a school bus
packed with teen-agers on a church outing while driving in the
wrong direction on Interstate 71. Twenty-four teens and three
adults died.
   He was convicted of 27 counts each of second-degree manslaughter
and first-degree wanton endangerment, 12 counts of first-degree
assault, 14 of second-degree wanton endangerment and one of drunken
driving.
   Defense lawyer William Summers urged Satterwhite to grant
probation to bring something positive from the tragedy. The defense
recommended a probation plan under which Mahoney would have
lectured schoolchildren about the dangers of drunken driving,
served volunteer time in hospital emergency wards, and spent one
year in a work release program.
   ``Judge, we must do as much good with this as we possibly can.
His punishment has already been dealt. He already has been given a
life sentence,'' Summers said, referring to Mahoney's suffering
since the crash.
   But prosecutor Paul Richwalsky Jr. of the state attorney
general's office vehemently opposed probation, saying, ``Regardless
of statements the defense would make, it's time for punishment.''
   Mahoney ``alone is responsible. He alone brought us to this
place today,'' he said.
   Jim Daugherty, Mahoney's brother-in-law, said the chemical plant
worker had held out some hope for probation but was not
particularly upset.
   ``He's resigned himself to it, I think,'' Daugherty said.
   Parents of some of the 24 children killed in the crash held a
news conference after the sentencing to urge passage of a package
of stiff drunken-driving laws pending in the Kentucky General
Assembly.
   Some of the victims and their families expressed satisfaction
Mahoney was sentenced, while others said wounds from the tragedy
were slow to heal.
   ``Probation would have left a real sour taste in my mouth,''
said Mickey Muller, whose daughter Katrina was injured in the
crash. ``Our poor children don't have probation.''
   ``This is not over today,'' said Gary Atherton, whose daughter,
Cynthia, died in the fiery wreck. ``It's not over for the rest of
our lives.''
   During the trial, jurors heard Mahoney issue a dramatic public
apology.
   He said he had no recollection of colliding with the bus, and
broke down into tears when disfigured survivors testified of horror
and panic inside the flaming bus.
   The collision punctured the bus's gas tank, shooting a stream of
flaming gasoline inside the bus.
   Defense attorneys argued the bus was unsafe because of
insufficent safety exits and had a fuel tank placed in a
crash-prone location.
   They also contended fire-retardant seat cushions and covers
could have limited the fire's rapid spread and the toxic smoke
which passengers inhaled.

<HEAD>USDA Announces Pizza Topping Recall Because of Broken Glass</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department says a Kansas
company has issued a nationwide recall of approximately 106,000
pounds of frozen pork pizza topping because it may contain light
bulb fragments.
   The product was made by Doskocil Sausage Co. and was sold
exclusively to food service facilities, including restaurants and
carryouts, the department said Friday. It is not available in
packages sold directly to consumers.
   Products include ``Leprino Foods Pizza Topping Mix'' with the
code NOV13891131, and ``Pizzano Cooked Italian Style Pizza
Topping'' with a code of NOV13891548 or NOV20891548.
   Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service said both products were shipped in
cartons containing five-pound bags. The establishment number 623
was stamped on the cartons and bags.
   Crawford said distributors and food service operators who have
any of the suspected products should return them to suppliers.
   The company began the recall after receiving four complaints,
one on Jan. 15 and three on Feb. 13, about broken glass in pizza
topping, Crawford said. There have been no reports of contaminated
products being consumed.
   People with questions about the recall were advised to call the
USDA's toll-free meat and poultry hotline at 1-800-535-4555, which
operates from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. EST Monday through Friday.

   The Senate Ethics Committee has questioned a
former top thrift regulator in an investigation of five senators
who intervened with banking officials on behalf of Lincoln Savings
and Loan.
   Edwin J. Gray, former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, said he met with the committee for four hours Friday behind
closed doors and ``they might choose to invite me back.''
   Gray declined to discuss his testimony.
   All five senators under scrutiny _ Alan Cranston, D-Calif.,
Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., John McCain, R-Ariz., Donald W. Riegle
Jr., D-Mich. and John Glenn, D-Ohio _ have denied wrongdoing. The
committee's investigation is still in its preliminary stage.
   Sources familiar with the overall investigation said the
committee appears to be exploring all possible relationships
between the senators and Phoenix millionaire Charles H. Keating
Jr., the former head of Lincoln, based in Irvine, Calif.
   Gray testified last November that four of the senators asked
him, in a private meeting on April 2, 1987, to drop a proposed
regulation that would have curtailed risky investments by Lincoln.
In return, he told the House Banking Committee, the four would get
``their friend'' Keating to make more home loans.
   Gray identified the four as DeConcini, Glenn, Cranston and
McCain, and described the offer as ``a quid pro quo.''
   Those senators and Riegle met a week later to discuss the case
with the San Francisco examiners, who were investigating Lincoln
and recommending its seizure by the government.

<HEAD>Air Force Secretary Calls Unflattering Report `Hypercritical'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air Force Secretary Donald Rice says a
congressional report contending his service had grossly understated
the costs of major weapons was ``hypercritical and inflammatory.''
   ``The ... report offers a narrow, CPA's view of the information
needed for defense decision-making that has limited relationship to
the real problems of defense management,'' Rice said in a
three-page letter to the head of the General Accounting Office,
Charles Bowsher.
   The letter was released Friday, the same day Bowsher told a
Senate committee Friday the Air Force's accounting system fails to
provide accurate cost data for almost 80 percent of its weapons,
inventory and equipment.
   ``We roughly estimate that equipment and missiles are misstated
by billions of dollars and aircraft and inventories are misstated
by tens of billions of dollars,'' he told the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee.
   Bowsher testified as the GAO released its 109-page audit of the
Air Force's accounting and financial management system.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio and chairman of the panel, noted that
the GAO chose to audit the Air Force because it is the only armed
service to develop financial statements that are in accord with
accounting practices elsewhere in the federal government.
   ``If the Air Force does indeed have the best financial
management system among the services, then the audit results are an
indictment of the financial management systems of the whole
Department of Defense _ the Army, the Navy, as well as the Air
Force,'' Glenn said.
   The Ohio Democrat also used the hearing to question Bowsher
about Rice's previously unreleased Feb. 15 letter to him.
   The Air Force secretary wrote that the service volunteered to
work with the GAO on the audit and ``in return, the GAO writes a
hypercritical and inflammatory report.''
   ``I urge you to send your team back to the drawing board with
instructions to prepare a report that fairly evaluates the pros and
cons of GAO's approach and which uses Air Force data only as a test
case for a new approach,'' Rice said.

<HEAD>Justice Department to Appeal Ruling Supporting Flag-Burning</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department says it will ask the
Supreme Court to overrule a federal judge's finding that a law
banning flag burning is unconstitutional.
   Spokesman David Runkel said Friday that Justice Department
attorneys will file a notice in Seattle federal court of the
government's plan to appeal Wednesday's ruling by U.S. District
Judge Barbara Rothstein.
   The judge dismissed criminal charges against four people arising
from a flag-burning incident, saying the law passed last year by
Congress violated constitutional free-speech protections.
   Congress enacted the law after the high court last year threw
out a similar Texas statute on the same constitutional ground.
   President Bush proposed a constitutional amendment to ban flag
burning but allowed the bill passed by Congress without signing it.
   Despite the administration's preference for a constitutional
amendment, the Justice Department has a duty to defend the law,
Runkel said.

<DATELINE>QUARRY HEIGHTS, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials are investigating
the crashes of two U.S. Army helicopters in Panama that killed all
11 servicemen aboard, the Southern Command said.
   The two helicopters, on a training mission, crashed during a
thunderstorm Wednesday night, a Southern Command statement said
Friday.
   An investigation is being conducted but sabotage is not
suspected, said Southern Command spokeswoman Marjorie Boggs.
   The wreckage of the first helicopter, an OH-58, was found
Thursday near Punta Diego, about 50 miles southwest of the city of
Colon, the statement said. The city is at the Atlantic Ocean end of
the Panama Canal.
   The dead in the OH-58 were identified as the pilot, Warrant
Officer James W. Carl, of the 228th Aviation Regiment at Fort Kobbe
in Panama, and Capt. Richard Tyndall, of the 7th Infantry Division
(Light), at Fort Ord, Calif. Tyndall was a passenger on the flight.
   Searchers on Friday found the second helicopter, a UH1H Huey, in
dense jungle about 55 miles southwest of Colon, the statement said.
   All four crew members and the five passengers were dead, it
said. A spokeswoman said the passengers also were U.S. military
personnel. Their names were withheld pending notification of
relatives.
   Both helicopters were based at Fort Kobbe, adjacent to Howard
Air Base.
   The aircraft were on a training mission when they encountered
the thunderstorms, rare during the current dry season. An earlier
statement said the OH-58 exploded, but also blamed the storm.
   The last communication with the aircraft was Wednesday night,
the statement said. Planes, helicopters and infantry troops
searched for the wreckage.
   The victims were among about 13,500 U.S. troops currently
assigned in Panama, about the number that were there before the
Dec. 20 U.S. invasion that ousted Manuel Antonio Noriega.

   Convicted drug kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas has been
up to his old game of smuggling, but this time it's for an auction
to raise money for college scholarships.
   Lehder, who is serving a life sentence at the maximum security
federal prison in Marion, Ill., sent a signed transcript from his
sentencing hearing to benefit business students at Miami-Dade
Community College.
   He smuggled the transcript out by mailing it to ``attorney'' Ed
Krohn, the chairman of the college's business administration
department who sought the celebrity donations.
   The transcript is among more than 1,100 items of memorabilia
donated by celebrities for the school, including a sun visor from
Cher, an engraved silver candy dish from Paul Newman and a pen from
President Bush. Jonas Salk sent an autographed copy of a 1955
report on polio.
   There also are flags from Belize, Lesotho, Liechtenstein and
Qatar and a post card of Monaco's royal family for today's auction.
   Also, there is an autographed airline boarding pass from Mother
Teresa and a picture book of former East German president Erich
Honecker _ mailed before the fall of his government.
   And there's Vanna White's black velvet dress.
   ``Bless her,'' Krohn said. He used that gift as an example to
inspire others to donate.
   ``Miami-Dade has the largest number of minority students and
foreign students of any college in the U.S., and those people need
money,'' he said Friday. ``We're doing it to raise money for their

   Not everyone who was asked complied.
   ``I don't think the people of Miami would appreciate anything
from me at this time,'' said Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air,
parent of the ailing Miami-based Eastern Airlines.
   Even so, Eastern donated a pair of tickets to be given away as a
door prize.

<HEAD>Boat People Allowed to Challenge Screening Process</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six Vietnamese were granted legal permission
today to challenge the screening process that decides which boat
people are to be returned to their Communist homeland against their
will, government radio said.
   The six maintain that the screening system is flawed and unjust,
the report said.
   The British colony, in an attempt to discourage Vietnamese from
sailing here, considers all boat people to be illegal immigrants
unless they can prove a well-founded fear of persecution back home.
   Under the screening process, which has been criticized by some
human rights groups, each Vietnamese is interviewed by immigration
officers who decide whether the applicant is a refugee or illegal
immigrant.
   A final decision is made by an appeal board that sits in private
and does not have to explain its decisions. Boat people are not
present at the appeal hearings.
   About 10 percent of the boat people who have gone through the
process have been granted refugee status, according to government
statistics. The rest are to be sent home.
   A first group of 51 boat people were repatriated against their
will in December, but no more Vietnamese have been forced back
since because of objections raised by the United States and Hanoi.
   The radio did not say when the court hearing for the six will
take place. Their case could have signficant repercussions on the
screening process.

   Elizabeth Morgan will seek an open court
hearing in New Zealand, where she sent her daughter into hiding, on
allegations that her husband abused 7-year-old Hilary, her family
says.
   ``The truth will have a lot of chance of coming out,'' Elizabeth
Morgan's older brother was quoted as saying in today's editions of
The Washington Post.
   Morgan, who spent 25 months in jail rather than let her former
husband visit the girl, told the Post she is hoping for a new
hearing on her allegations that Eric Foretich sexually abused the
girl during court-ordered visits in the Washington area. Foretich
has strongly denied the charges and contends his former wife is
mentally ill.
   Detective Chief Inspector Roger Carson of Christchurch, New
Zealand, said the girl is in the custody of her grandparents there
and that there will be a hearing on the issue next week in the
city's family court.
   ``I've not felt the legal system in Washington, D.C., had
listened to the evidence,'' Morgan told the newspaper. ``I didn't
think I ever said that I trusted no legal system.''
   Her lawyer, Stephen Sachs, said he will ask District of Columbia
Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon on Monday to return Morgan's
passport so she can go to New Zealand.
   Dixon is the judge who odered Morgan, 42, to jail in August 1987
for civil contempt when she refused to a court order to produce
Hilary for supervised visits with Foretich. She was released from
jail in Washington in September after President Bush signed a law
limiting civil contempt in District of Columbia child abuse cases
to 12 months.
   Foretich said he was ``elated'' that his daughter has been found
and ``appears to be at least physically well.''
   ``I would hope to obtain custody,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ``That's obviously why I want to bring her back to
Washington. I want to bring her back to the court in Washington
where she belongs.''
   But he said he has no illusions that gaining custody of the girl
will be easy.
   ``Elizabeth Morgan is going to ... wage the same media battle
that she's always done in the past,'' he said. ``She is undoubtedly
a media person, she's a media queen. And she creates this illusion
that I'm some kind of a pervert and she's going to try to do that
down there as well and use the media to do it in hopes that that
will influence the court.''
   Foretich said he resents the publicity as much for his daughter
as for himself. ``I don't think it's fair ... for my daughter to
... have her life made unnecessarily more public than it needs to
be,'' he said.
   ``Elizabeth is going to do whatever she possibly can do to
protect her daughter,'' Sachs told the Post. ``Elizabeth is
confident that the courts of New Zealand will protect Hilary.''
   Elizabeth Morgan, in the Post interview, declined to predict how
the new court proceedings will go. ``I think time will tell,'' she
said. ``It's early days.''
   But James Morgan, her older brother, said she wants to introduce
in open court the allegations of abuse that U.S. courts ruled
against.
   ``We're awfully happy that we're going to have an open hearing
in an open court, unlike the district, where everything was
closed,'' James Morgan said.

<TEXT>
   A 7-year-old American girl,
hidden by her mother during a highly publicized U.S. custody
battle, was found living with her grandparents in New Zealand. Her
father today said he tracked her down.
   Hilary Foretich has been living with her mother's parents in
Christchurch for three years and is in good health, Roger Carson,
the Christchurch detective chief inspector, said today.
   He said Hilary is the subject of a New Zealand Family Court
order issued Friday. ``As a result of that order Hilary is now in
the custody of her grandparents and there will be a further hearing
in the Family Court in Christchurch next week,'' Carson said. He
did not elaborate.
   The girl's mother, Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, a plastic surgeon,
accused the father, Dr. Eric Foretich, of sexually abusing Hilary.
She was jailed for 25 months from August 1987 for civil contempt of
court for failing to obey a judge's order to produce the child.
   Foretich, a 46-year-old oral surgeon, had offered a $50,000
reward to anyone who could find his daughter. He has strongly
denied ever abusing the child.
   ``I was the one who found my daughter,'' he said in a telephone
interview early today from his home in Great Falls, Va., a
Washington suburb. He said his lawyer in New Zealand went to court
to ask for custody after private investigators on Friday helped
``make a positive identification.''
   His account could not be independently confirmed.
   ``I'm elated,'' he said, but added that about obtaining custody:
``I don't have any illusions that this is going to be easy.
   ``I found my daughter with the help of investigative
reporters,'' he said. ``I made several trips to England where I
found information out.''
   Last week, his lawyers obtained a court order in England that
instructed the producer of a British talk show to investigate the
girl's whereabouts after a caller said she recognized the girl's
picture broadcast on the show, the Times of London reported Tuesday.
   Morgan's lawyer, Stephen H. Sachs, was quoted in today's
Washington Post as saying, ``Elizabeth is going to do whatever she
possibly can do to protect her daughter.''
   ``Elizabeth is confident that the courts of New Zealand will
protect Hilary, and Elizabeth will go to New Zealand as soon as
(Washington D.C. Superior Court Judge Herbert B.) Dixon gives her
back her passport, which we've requested several times, and we will
renew the request on Monday.''
   Dixon confiscated Morgan's passport before he jailed her in 1987.
   Morgan, 42, declined to predict the outcome of the New Zealand
proceedings.
   ``I think time will tell,'' she said.
   Robert Callard, the U.S. consul in the New Zealand capital of
Wellington, said the embassy's only role was to make sure the child
is protected and that nobody tries to take her out of the country.
Christchurch is 190 miles southwest of Wellington.
   Morgan had said she would go without seeing her daughter until
the girl turned 18 if necessary to protect her. She was released
from jail in Washington in September after President Bush signed a
law limiting civil contempt in District of Columbia child abuse
cases to 12 months.
   Morgan has married a federal appeals court judge, Paul R.
Michel, since she was released.
   She and Foretich met in 1981, married in January 1982 and
separated in August of that year, about a week before Hilary was
born.
   In 1983 the divorced couple sued each other for custody of the
child. In January 1985 Morgan took legal action to stop Foretich's
access to Hilary after making the sexual abuse allegations.
   Hilary's picture was shown on a BBC program last year, when
Foretich discussed the custody battle.
   The caller, the deputy headmistress at Beechfield College, a
private girls' school at Plymouth in southwest England, said Hilary
was a former pupil.
   The Times said the headmistress, Pat Holness, told the show's
producer that the girl, who went under the name Ellen Morgan, was
being looked after by her maternal grandparents, William and
Antonia Morgan, during the time she attended the school. She left
in summer 1988.

   The ruling Sandinista party is hoping
that an election certified as fair by international observers will
force the United States to end a decade of hostility even if the
U.S. favorite loses.
   That would be a difficult adjustment for the United States,
which views the Sandinistas as a disturbing and destabilizing
leftist factor in the region, and for the Sandinistas, who have
viewed the United States as an aggressor and an advocate of
socially regressive policies.
   ``They will both have to change,'' said Erick Ramirez, the
Social Christian Party's presidential candidate, in an interview.
   U.S. support is taken for granted if Violeta Barrios de Chamorro
pulls what would be a stunning upset over President Daniel Ortega.
U.S. aid is anticipated even if the United National Opposition cuts
a deal that gives the Sandinistas control of the army and the
Interior Ministry's police powers.
   But if the Sandinistas win it will be more problematic.
   The Sandinistas are desperate for U.S. recognition, which would
pave the way for an end to the U.S.-sponsored Contra guerrilla
movement, trigger negotiations with the Bush adminstration and
eventually bring in U.S. aid and development dollars.
   ``But the first thing we need from the United States is peace,''
Ortega campaign manager Bayardo Arce said Thursday.
   Earlier Thursday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the
United States will not automaticallay accept the judgments of
international observers, even people like former President Jimmy
Carter.
   As a second hedge he laid down a set of conditions in
anticipation of a legitimate Sandinista victory.
   ``There will be no normalization until we see a substantial
period of good behavior by the government,'' including a halt to
support for leftist rebels in El Salvador and political freedom for
the opposition in Nicaragua, Baker said.
   Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, once a harsh
critic of the Sandinistas, said the United States should recognize
the winner and ``start discussions with the new government.''
   Nicaragua needs peace and development badly, Obando y Bravo
said, and that can only come with U.S. help.
   At a Thursday press conference, Ortega was careful to be
conciliatory even in the face of Baker's comments, refusing to
discuss Baker's conditions and saying he hoped to initiate
negotiations with the United States after he was re-elected.
   In today's editions of the New York Times, he was quoted as
saying he would not provide arms to Salvadoran guerrillas after the
elections, and he called El Salvador's rightist government
``legitimate.''
   A senior Nicaraguan official who spoke on condition of anonymity
voiced the Sandinistas' devout hope when he said, ``(President)
Bush already threw a bone to the U.S. radical conservatives by
invading Panama. He can afford to talk to Nicaragua now without
looking weak.''
   During the past year the Sandinistas have tried to shed their
image as radical Marxists.
   The Sandinistas have pledged there will be no more
expropriations of private property, repeatedly told private
business they want a mixed economy, released political prisoners
and reduced friction with the powerful Roman Catholic Church.
   Obando y Bravo, once a bitter critic, said the Sandinistas
``have changed. I believe there are some pragmatic people in the
government. ... Circumstances here and abroad are forcing the FSLN
(Sandinistas) to change.''
   He was referring to the effects of liberalization and economic
problems in Eastern Europe since Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
took power.
   On a practical level, the changes mean reduced subsidies and
arms for Nicaragua; on an intellectual and political level they
mean communism is no longer a credible alternative.
   Arce said some Sandinista economic policies of the past 10 years
may have been wrong.
   A local joke has it that the Sandinistas will win to carry out
the UNO economic program, although Ortega says he disagrees with
policies that might lead to massive unemployment.
   Ortega also said Thursday that the United States should stop
assisting the Contra guerrillas before pointing a finger at
Nicaragua; although the U.S. halted arms shipments to them in 1988,
non-lethal aid continues.
   Only about 3,500 rebels are thought to remain inside Nicaragua;
the aid comes up for renewal after Sunday's election.
   ``The problem is that the United States has stayed with a
contradictory international policy. They are getting closer to the
Eastern European countries undergoing political reforms, but those
types of reforms exist in Nicaragua already,'' said Victor Hugo
Tinoco, the deputy foreign minister, in an interview.

<HEAD>Harbor Reopened After Firefighters Remove Leaky Container of Gas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Firefighters safely removed a leaky container
of flammable gas aboard a cargo ship, clearing the way for the
reopening of one of the world's busiest seaports.
   The harbor was reopened shortly before midnight Friday, said Pat
Marek, a Fire Department spokesman. The closure had affected harbor
traffic for about 24 hours.
   A 1{-mile stretch of the main channel of the Los Angeles Harbor
was closed after gas was found to be leaking from a 2,000-pound
cylinder deep in the cargo hold of a freighter.
   Firefighters on Friday night began removing containers from the
ship's cargo hold to reach the leaking container of
trifluoropropene, Marek said.
   ``We were able to get down into the ship to determine the
explosive environment,'' fire battalion Chief Leon Pursell said.
``We found it to be free of the flammable liquids. ... That allowed
us to get in there and start to remove the containers.''
   The leaking container was about 40 feet down in the cargo hold
of the 882-foot Taiwanese vessel owned by Evergreen Shipping Co.
   The closure was the first in 12 years at the nation's top
container shipping port.
   Coast Guard officials said the harbor shutdown did not affect
the harbor's vital container ship traffic as much as pleasure boat
traffic.
   ``Most of the container ships were already at anchor and
unloading'' when officials discovered the gas leak, Coast Guard
petty officer Tim Rowe said.
   However, two cruise ships, which normally use the channel to
load and unload passengers, were forced to berth at adjacent Long
Beach Harbor.

   An Army deserter who believes he
``threw 30 years of my life away'' by fleeing to East Germany in
1959 said the changes in the United States have left him
slack-jawed with amazement.
   Arnold Kephart, 53, who fled to East Germany fearing punishment
after wrecking an Army truck, said adjustment to U.S. society has
made him feel a bit like a latter-day Rip van Winkle.
   ``The first time I saw one of those,'' Kephart said, pointing to
a microwave oven, ``I thought it was a TV. Then someone came along,
opened it up, and put food in. I couldn't believe he was putting
food in the TV.''
   In an interview Friday at the home of his brother-in-law, Arlo
Dunbar, Kephart said he regretted his decision to enter East
Germany only a few weeks after settling in Schmalkalind, he town
where he lived for 30 years.
   ``It was like you were locked up all the time. I never really
ever felt at home,'' said the former Army private, who said he
twice unsuccessfully tried to escape the country.
   ``I feel like I threw 30 years of my life away,'' he said.
   Before his second escape attempt in 1975, Kephart drank ``enough
beer to get my courage up and so I'd have an excuse if I got
caught,'' he said.
   Three guards grabbed him as he approached the border, beat him,
and sent him back to town, Kephart said.
   ``After that, I didn't think about trying the border again,''
Kephart said.
   A year after the escape attempt he met his second wife,
Brigitte. She is the mother of Frankie, now 12 and in the United
States with his father, and Kephart's 8-year-old twin daughters,
Katharina and Kathleen. He has another child from his first
marriage in East Germany.
   The family lived in a small house, Kephart said. Their diet was
meager: bread with some bologna-like meat for breakfast, soup and
potatoes for lunch. Dinner was a reprise of breakfast, he said.
   ``You could seldom get eggs,'' he said. ``And the meat in the
store, when you could get it, a lot of times had a bad color, like
it was old.''
   He said the country he has returned to is a ``different world.''
   ``Here, everybody has a phone,'' Kephart noted with amazement in
a voice heavy with a German accent.
   On returning to the United States last month, the Army arrested
him at the airport as he was being reunited with relatives. He was
granted an other-than-honorable discharge a week later.
   Kephart, who earned a living driving trucks in East Germany,
could not believe the interstate highway system when he saw it. He
recently drove about 50 miles south from here to Rock Port, Mo.,
just to test Interstate 29.
   He said he is enjoying foods he sorely missed.
   ``I always loved chili,'' he said. ``And pork and beans. They
just don't have anything like that over there.''
   A deal for a television movie of Kephart's life has been closed,
according to his attorney, James Martin Davis. He wouldn't reveal
details.
   Kephart said he now will be try to rebuild his life in Council
Bluffs, a southwestern Iowa community.
   His second marriage ended in divorce in 1988, but he said he
wants to remarry Brigitte, bring her and his daughters to the
United States and work as a truck driver.
   He wrote all of this in a letter to his former wife, and now
awaits her reply.

<HEAD>New Program Lets New Englanders Pay Federal Taxes With Credit
Cards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID SEDENO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New England residents who find they haven't
saved enough money to pay their federal taxes this year have a
penalty-free way out of that dilemma _ charge it.
   A Southern California company is launching a test program in New
England next week that will allow taxpayers to use a Visa,
MasterCard or Discovery Card to pay their taxes.
   The new service, called InstaPay, is being offered by a
two-year-old company called InstaTax, one of several companies the
Internal Revenue Service has allowed to participate in the new
program.
   It's part of a new IRS electronic payment program called
Automatic Deposit of Electronic Payments for Taxes, which will be
available to taxpayers in Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts,
Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.
   ``This is a convenient way for people who are surprised by their
tax return and don't have the money on savings to pay their
taxes,'' InstaTax president Donald D. Cook said Friday.
   ``If they charge it on their credit card, they can begin making
payments and avoid penalties from the IRS.''
   Taxpayers filing forms 1040EZ, 1040A or 1040 are eligible for
the program if they have sufficient credit available on their Visa,
MasterCard or Discover Card credit cards to cover their taxes owed
and processing fees. Their 1989 tax return also must show a balance
due and each person listed on the return must have been living on
Jan. 1.
   The service is available at Mail Boxes Etc. retail outlets or
the office of a participating paid tax preparer.
   The customer fills out an InstaTax Order Form, signs a copy of
the terms and conditions receipt and must complete an IRS form. The
person then gives the documents, along with their 1989 tax return
and W-2 forms, to a clerk who checks the information for accuracy.
   After payment is received for filing the return electronically,
the clerk sends the documents to San Diego-based InstaTax. The
firm's minimum fee for filing the return is $29.95.
   InstaTax will file the customer's tax return electronically with
the IRS within 24 hours of receipt. Customers receive a postcard
informing them of the date the IRS accepted their return.
   When the customer uses the credit card to pay the taxes,
InstaTax will charge the credit card company and use San Diego
Trust &amp; Savings Bank to act as its agent.
   The bank, like other financial institutions and businesses
involved in the program, will transmit tax payments to the Boston
Federal Reserve Bank for crediting with the U.S. Treasury.
   Cook believes this pilot program is the wave of the tax-paying
future.
   ``The IRS is limiting the project to the six New England states
this year, but in a few years, I think, all you'll have to do in
signing a return is to give a credit card number when you send it
in,'' he said.
   Frank Burgess, head of the Automated Clearing House financial
network of the IRS, did not return phone calls Friday.

<HEAD>Monday Layoffs Loom for 4,200 GM Workers in 3 States</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. is scaling back production
at three assembly plants, idling about 4,200 workers.
   The layoffs, announced Friday, are part of a wave of cutbacks by
major automakers in a season of slow sales.
   Starting Monday, GM said it will eliminate one of two shifts at
each of its car assembly plants in Doraville, Ga., and Linden,
N.J., resulting in 1,900 and 1,600 layoffs respectively. The
nation's largest automaker also will trim production at its
assembly plant in Fairfax, Kan., causing about 700 layoffs.
   ``There's an air of despondency,'' said Guy Messina, a shop
chairman for United Auto Workers Local 595 in Linden, where
Chevrolet Corsica and Beretta cars are made. ``It finally sunk in
that these are their last days.''
   But the expected idling of other autoworkers will be put off.
   GM said Friday the planned mid-March shutdown of the Lakewood
assembly plant in Atlanta would be pushed back to between April 1
and July 1 because of a pickup in sales of Buick Estate station
wagons and 1990 Chevrolet Caprice cars.
   Chrysler spokesman Doug Nicoll said Friday that layoffs of 750
employees at an assembly plant in Belvidere, Ill., where luxury
cars are made, and 780 layoffs at its factory in Newark, Del.,
where Dodge Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim cars are assembled, will be
put off indefinitely. The layoffs originally were scheduled to take
effect March 19.
   Ford Motor Co. has avoided indefinite layoffs by increasing its
capacity during the boom years of 1985-88 through overtime at
existing plants rather than opening new factories.
   Automakers use plant shutdowns and production reductions to
bring factory output in line with the inventories of new, unsold
cars on dealer and plant lots. Automakers have said they expect
slower sales through at least the first half of this year with a
rebound later.
   Sales tumbled in October as the 1990 model year began. In
January, the pace picked up, mainly because of incentives on
Chrysler's popular minivans. Those offers expired Jan. 31, and the
rate of sales since then has fallen.
   On Friday, the Big Three reported their mid-February sales of
cars and light trucks were running 15.8 percent behind last year's
pace. Since Jan. 1, with effects of Chrysler minivan incentives
figured in, the sales pace was running 0.2 percent ahead of last
year.
   Throughout January, the Big Three automakers shut down dozens of
their plants for at least a week apiece to cut inventory. The move
apparently worked as inventory levels fell from around 90 selling
days' worth at the end of December to about 70 days at the end last
month.
   But that's not enough to stop the layoffs.
   Like GM, Chrysler is shutting down entire plants this year _ its
Jefferson Assembly factory in Detroit closed Feb. 2, resulting in
1,700 layoffs, and its St. Louis car plant cut a shift earlier this
month and will shut down totally Sept. 21. In all, 3,700 St. Louis
employees will be laid off.
   Workers placed on indefinite layoff status may qualify for a

   A caged lion ripped off part of its
owner's arm while the animal keeper was feeding the African cat,
authorities said.
   Charles McEntire, 57, was listed in stable condition Friday
after undergoing surgery at Riverside Community Hospital, said a
hospital spokeswoman.
   Sheriff's deputies and California Department of Forestry rescue
personnel were called to McEntire's Glen Avon exotic animal
compound late Thursday and found him with his left arm severed at
the elbow, said Riverside County Sheriff's Lt. Dan Borden.
   McEntire was licensed to possess exotic animals. A warden from
the state Fish and Game Department was investigating the mauling.

<TEXT>
   Poland will issue a 100,000 zloty note as
part of efforts to accommodate the soaring inflation that has
accompanied economic reform, the official news agency PAP reported
today.
   The banknote, to be introduced Monday, will be worth $10.50, the
report said. It is the second largest in circulation, after the
recently introduced 200,000 zloty note.
   The Polish National Bank note was being produced in December but
had to be redesigned after the country's name was changed from the
Polish People's Republic to the Republic of Poland, the news agency
said.
   The banknote honors Stanislaw Moniuszko, a 19th century opera
composer.
   Poland has been struggling with triple digit inflation since
last year, following the lifting of controls that had kept prices
unrealistically low through government subsidies to unprofitable
state enterprises.
   In January alone, the inflation rate was about 79 percent, but
economists forecast an easing of inflation during the next six
months as efforts to transform the socialist economy into a
market-driven system take hold.

   An 86-year-old driver accidentally hit her
84-year-old sister twice while backing a car out of her driveway,
authorities said.
   Viola Ditto was in critical condition Friday at Hemet Valley
Medical Center, a hospital spokesman said.
   Marjorie Smith was waiting to take Ditto for a drive Thursday
when she backed out of her driveway to look for her sister, said
Officer Dan Tarnoski of the Hemet Police Department.
   The sisters live near each other at a mobile home park in this
city about 85 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles.
   When she didn't see Ditto, Smith drove back up the driveway,
Tarnoski said. Minutes later, Smith again backed out. She then
spotted Ditto lying in the street, Tarnoski said.
   He said Smith's car apparently knocked Ditto down the first time
she backed out. The car ran over Ditto's legs the second time,
Tarnoski said.
   Smith was not cited, he said.

<HEAD>Governing Party Calls For $680 Million Rice Fund For Emergency Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing party proposed Japan spend hundreds
of millions of dollars on foreign rice over five years but use the
rice only for foreign aid and not on the heavily subsidized
domestic market, officials said today.
   Millions of tons of rice would be purchased, mainly from the
United States, Thailand and Singapore, said Takashi Sato, chairman
of the Liberal Democratic Party's Comprehensive Agriculture
Research Commission, who proposed the plan.
   The $680 million plan calls for construction of rice stockpiles
in each country, filled with rice purchased by Japan, said Hajime
Kondo, an aide to Sato.
   Kondo said the project would show Japan's willingness to buy
rice and contribute to those suffering but not to import foreign
rice for domestic consumption.
   ``We will never liberalize rice imports. We will never, ever
allow a single foreign rice grain into our nation,'' Kondo said.
   The government regulates the domestic rice market, buying much
of the rice crop and reselling it to consumers at subsidized
prices. Those prices are still several times higher than the world
market level.
   Sato's plan, proposed to begin in April 1991, calls for foreign
rice to be added to the list of items to be donated to countries
requiring emergency support. The Japanese Red Cross Society will
handle the donations, he said.
   ``We don't want to just give away money and be seen as
arrogant,'' Kondo said.
   The government budgeted $68,000 during fiscal 1990 for
feasibility studies.
   Japan has been trying to persuade its trading partners to accept
its existing agricultural trade policy in the current Uruguay round
of multilateral trade talks, without success so far.
   In September 1988, both houses of Parliament unanimously adopted
a non-binding resolution against opening the nation's rice market
to foreign imports. The resolution said rice production was vital
for local communities, the preservation of land and Japanese
culture.

<HEAD>Mountain of Ice Builds; Maine Bureaucrats Stumped on Snow Removal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One might think Maine's largest city
would have snow removal refined to an art form, bng snow into a shorefront
mountain.
   But officials now acknowledge that the mass of dirty ice will
carry some of the sand and salt into the cove, which drains into
Casco Bay, already one of the region's most polluted harbors.
   The state and city reached a two-year agreement that calls for
the snow to be piled up next to the cove while the city conducts an
environmental impact study.
   State environmental officials were concerned especially about
keeping the sand out of the cove in order to comply with pollution
standards set up the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
   Hydrocarbon tests on the snow and a study of clams, mussels and
microorganisms in the area should be completed by spring.
   Portland Public Works Director George Flaherty hopes by then to
have convinced the state that it is safe to dump the snow into the
bay instead of piling it high.
   ``We felt it hasn't caused a problem,'' he said.
   Phil Garwood of the state Department of Environmental
Protection, who does not think the city should dump any snow into
the bay, said the snow pile will lessen the pollutants that go into
the waters because the mountain is surrounded by a fine-mesh fence.
The fence is designed to let melting snow get through while
trapping large particles of dirt and pollutants.
   ``Some of the trash will no doubt blow into Back Cove,'' he said.
   Garwood said some Canadian cities are better at handling their
polluted snow than their U.S. counterparts. Quebec, for example,
has a snow dump that resembles a coliseum, where the snow is
allowed to melt and the remaining particles of pollutants are then
disposed of.
   But Portland has nowhere but the bay to put the snow because
most city land is used as parks, where salt from the snow could
harm vegetation and ground water, Flaherty said.
   The mountain also has developed into an eyesore, some say.
   ``I think it's pretty disgusting,'' said Beth Ravenelle, a
teacher from Saco who has watched the pile of snow and debris get
taller and taller during her frequent jogs along the water.
   ``We've just watched this thing grow all winter,'' said another
jogger, John Williams, a local scientist who sometimes makes his
exercise course more interesting by running right over the mound of
snow that has been packed into a hard ice by 35-ton bulldozers.
   The mountain of ice has grown so big that officials expect it to
last until mid-summer. This season so far has brought 58.3 inches
of snow _ 3.1 inches more than normal for Portland.
   ``My guess is probably mid-July,'' Flaherty said. He said City
Hall workers talk of setting up their own betting pool for
predicting the demise of the mound they have christened
``Flaherty's Mountain.''
   ``You might as well call it something,'' Flaherty said. ``I have
another name for it, but we sure don't put it in the press.''

   Snow fell from Michigan to Kentucky to Maine today as a cold
front blasted out of the nation's midsection on 55 mph gusts,
dragging down temperatures from the Great Lakes to the Northeast.
   Weekend readings in the Northeast were expected to be 15 to 30
degrees colder than Friday's and the coldest since December.
Temperatures tonight will dip below zero as far south as Illinois.
   Between 5 and 10 inches of fresh snow were likely from northern
Pennsylvania and southern New York to New England before ending
tonight.
   Drier, cold air replaced soggy warm air in the Deep South. On
Friday, 12 Alabama counties were added to an earlier emergency
relief declaration after two weeks of drenching storms. Nine
Georgia counties were declared disaster areas because of tornadoes
and floods.
   High water continued to threaten Mississippi's Gulf Coast, and
residents in lowland Indiana helped seal off neighborhoods from
flood waters with sandbags.
   Warnings of heavy snow and storms were issued today for
Michigan's Upper Peninsula, northern Lower Michigan and
northwestern Indiana.
   Gusty winds up to 55 mph lashed northwestern Iowa on Friday.
   Temperatures Friday were again unseasonably warm over parts of
the Atlantic states. Record highs set for the date include 56 in
Portland, Maine; 61 in Worcester, Mass.; 62 in New York City; and
65 in Boston.
   Friday's high temperature for the nation was 88 at West Palm
Beach, Fla.

<HEAD>Report: Networks to Pool Exit Polls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The three major television networks and Cable
News Network have agreed to create a single exit poll for election
days, according to a published report.
   Two senior network officials told The New York Times that the
networks agreed to cooperate to cut costs and to avoid the
competition that has resulted in predictions of winners before all
votes are cast.
   CBS, NBC, ABC and CNN are to be equal partners in the group,
which is to be called Voter Research and Surveys, the Times said in
today's editions.
   Each network is to receive the same information at the same time
on election days, the newspaper said.
   A public announcement is expected next week. Spokesmen for the
four networks said they could not officially confirm the agreement,
the Times said.
   Observers said the group polling would cut down on the
competition to be the first network to declare a winner.
   ``There's a public perception that such early projections are a
disenfranchisement of the West Coast,'' since results have been
announced there before voting concluded, said Eleanor Singer, a
research scientist at Columbia University.
   But the newspaper quoted network executives as saying that
saving money was the driving force behind the pooled polling. Each
network will chip in $3 million to operate the service on primary
and general election days until the next presidential election in
1992.
   One executive said a single network might spend $12 million on
polling in that time.
   It was unclear how the arrangement will affect other news
organizations, such as newspapers, who have teamed up with networks
in past polls.

   The victim, Charles Pickford, 42, of West Mifflin remained in

<HEAD>Councilman's Answer to Drug Problem: Controlled Distribution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A City Council resolution to study whether
distributing illegal drugs free would cut down on crime has drawn
ridicule from politicians and law enforcement officials.
   Councilman John Street offered the resolution Thursday calling
for reports on the legal and medical implications of a drug
distribution system. The resolution was routinely and unanimously
approved without discussion.
   But some councilmen said later they were unaware of the
resolution's content, and denounced the measure. One councilman
said the resolution would go to a committee _ and stay there.
   ``What they are proposing is a violation of state law and a
violation of federal law,'' District Attorney Ronald Castille said
Friday. ``If they try to distribute free cocaine and other drugs to
anyone, they will be arrested.''
   Mayor W. Wilson Goode urged the council to reconsider, saying
the study would waste his administration's time and siphon money
away from drug treatment and education programs.
   Pennsylvania Attorney General Ernest Preate called the
resolution ``absurb.''
   ``You're going to be diverting people who should be out there in
the fight against drugs to find ways to make Philadelphia the drug
capital of the United States,'' he said.
   The resolution calls for reports from the city's police and
health commissioners, prison and school superintendents, judges and
district attorney on the legal and medical implications of giving
addicts drugs at low or no cost to see if they can be cured of
their habit.
   ``I think other tools should be brought into the arsenal of
government against this terrible drug situation,'' Street said.
   ``It's stupid; it's nuts,'' said Councilwoman Joan Krajewski.
   Councilman James Tayoun said, ``He's an idiot.''
   But Councilman Thacher Longstreth thinks the idea is worth a
shot.
   ``We had a treatment program using methadone to help heroin
users, and that didn't do well,'' Longstreth said. ``But it's
always worth investigating. My initial reaction is maybe it's time
to experiment again.''
   Street insisted he was not advocating the legalization of drugs.
   ``We don't have enough treatment. We don't have enough police.
We don't have enough courtrooms to try those arrested. We don't
have enough jails. So there's got to be additional things to do,''
he said.
   ``My idea is strictly to look into the idea of legalizing drugs
for treatment purposes only.''
   Councilman Lucien Blackwell said the resolution would be
assigned to the Health Committee for a hearing and will not emerge.
   ``We do have a drug problem. I think we should discuss it. But
giving drug users more drugs to wean them off drugs won't work. You
got to cut if off entirely,'' Blackwell said.

   Crashes of two U.S. Army helicopters on
training exercises in Panama have claimed the lives of 11
servicemen, the U.S. Southern Command says.
   American military officials said the helicopters ran into
thunderstorms while flying on the Atlantic side of the isthmus. The
accident happened Wednesday night and was reported Friday.
Officials gave few details.
   The Southern Command statement said a search and rescue effort
was launched shortly after 9 p.m. Wednesday, when communications
with the two aircraft were lost.
   U.S. search teams found an Army OH-58 observation helicopter
Thursday morning in heavy jungle terrain near Punta Diego, about 50
miles southwest of Colon. The other, a UH-1H Huey helicopter, was
discovered about four miles away Friday afternoon.
   All four crew members and five passengers in the Huey were dead,
said the Southern Command statement from Panama City. Names were
withheld until relatives had been notified.
   Both occupants of the observation helicopter also were killed.
They were identified as Warrant Officer James W. Carl, the pilot,
and Capt. Richard D. Tyndall.
   Carl was assigned to the 228th Aviation Regiment at Fort Kobbe
in Panama. Tyndall was from the 7th Infantry Division at Ford Ord,
Calif. Both helicopters were based at Fort Kobbe, adjacent to
Howard Air Base.

speed, comfort and readiness, James Roddey, acting president of
Maglev Inc., said Friday.
   ``What we presently consider the communter airline market
represents the magnetic levitation market,'' said Roddey, an
advertising executive.
   Maglev Inc., a group of business, labor and government leaders,
was formed to develop a 19-mile demonstration project linking
downtown Pittsburgh to Greater Pittsburgh International Airport.
   The ``maglev'' train hovers on a magnetic field over an elevated
guideway, using technology devised in the United States in 1968 and
improved in West Germany. Train cars have no wheels and wrap around
a guide rail, preventing the train from derailing.
   The group has completed a preliminary study on the feasibility
of magnetic levitation in Pittsburgh and is trying to raise $2.1
million for a more detailed study, Roddey said.
   ``What we want to do in the Pittsburgh area is become a
technological and manufacturing base for magnetic levitation in the
United States,'' Roddey said.
   Richard Uher, director of Carnegie Mellon University's High
Speed Ground Transportation Center, said Maglev could create ``a
whole new industry here.''
   The 12 members of Maglev Inc. have agreed to invest $900,000 for
the study, which will take 2{ years to finish. An additional
$300,000 will come from the state, Roddey said.
   The Maglev Promotion Council, a Japanese trading company, has
committed about $250,000, he said, and the company is applying for
$1.2 million from federal officials.
   The airport project could be completed as early as 1996, Roddey
said. It would cost $300 million to $650 million to design and
build, depending on the route and whether a single or double track
system is built.

<TEXT>
   Recent statements from Iran and Lebanon
have given Syria ``great hope'' that Western hostages in Lebanon
will be released, Syria's information minister said today.
   But Mohammed Salam cautioned the sister of American hostage
Terry A. Anderson not to expect a quick release of her brother and
the 17 other Westerners believed to be held.
   ``The matter requires careful study and patience as well as
coordination of efforts with international and local parties. We
are following this road,'' he told Peggy Say, who is on her fifth
tour of the region in hopes of securing the hostages' release.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest-held of the Western hostages. He was
kidnapped in Moslem west Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   Salman's optimism stemmed from a statement made Friday in Beirut
by Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlalah, the most influential Shiite
Moslem cleric in Lebanon. He appealed for a new approach to free
the hostages.
   Fadlallah, who recently returned from a visit to Tehran with
senior Iranian leaders, spoke the day after an editorial in the
Tehran Times, which usually reflects the thinking of President
Hashemi Rafsanjani, urged that the hostages be freed. It was the
first time an Iranian newspaper has made such a statement.
   ``We have to think of finding realistic and humanitarian means
to free the foreign hostages'' Fadlallah said in a sermon on the
Moslem holy day.
   The hostage issue ``has been widely exploited by Western forces
to harm the image of Moslems,'' Fadlallah said.
   He is the spiritual guide to the Iranian-aligned Hezbollah, or
Party of God, which is believed to be an umbrella organization for
groups holding most of the Westerners missing in Lebanon.
   Salman praised the statements.
   ``We have great hope now that we can work with all concerned to
secure the release of the hostages,'' he said.
   Earlier statements from Iran and Shiite leaders in Lebanon about
a possible hostage release ``were not made in such a serious
manner,'' he said.
   Syria, with 40,000 troops in Lebanon, is the main power broker
in that country. The Syrians have been instrumental in securing the
release of some Western hostages over the past five years and
played a role in other releases. Syria is Iran's main ally in the
region.
   Salman said Syria ``would be proud if we were able to secure
release of any hostage regardless of his nationality.''
   He said Syria is categorically opposed to kidnapping.
   ``Neither Terry Anderson nor any other hostage is responsible
for the problems of the area. And kidnapping cannot solve these
problems,'' Salman said.
   Mrs. Say told him: ``I know in my heart that Syria's conviction
to gain the release of the hostages is total.''
   Mrs. Say is on a tour with an Associated Press delegation to
seek the release of Anderson and the others. She has met with U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, Pope John Paul II and
Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization.

   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and President Bush
will meet in California next week to discuss trade frictions
between the two countries and changes in Eastern Europe, the
government and news reports said today.
   Kaifu and Bush will hold their second Japan-U.S. summit meeting
in Palm Springs on March 2-3, the Foreign Ministry said in a
statement.
   The two leaders met for the first time in September, when Kaifu
visited Washington soon after becoming prime minister.
   Kaifu told reporters today that he had received a telephone call
from Bush, and quoted the president as saying, ``I would like to
have talks about the global partnership of Japan-U.S. ties without
deciding specific topics.''
   The White House said the two leaders would discuss
``internatinal developments, the U.S.-Japanese global parntership
and bilateral relations.''
   ``The visit underlies the vital importance both countries attach
to the U.S.-Japanese relationship and its contribution to the
preservation of peace and prosperity in the Pacific and throughout
the world,'' the White House said.
   Bush wants to hear Japan's position on the political changes in
Eastern Europe and hopes for an early exchange of opinions on
Japanese-U.S. cooperation toward thawing East-West ties, a Japanese
Foreign Ministry official told Kyodo News Service. Another Foreign
Ministry official told Kyodo that the two sides hope to find ways
to improve their strained trade relations.
   Kaifu is expected to reassure Bush that Japan intends to solve
issues such as the ``structural impediments'' at the top of
Washington's complaint list on trade with Japan. The U.S. trade
deficit with Japan for 1989 is expected to reach $49 billion.
   A two-day round of U.S.-Japan ``Structural Impediments
Initiative'' talks ended inconclusively in Tokyo on Friday with the
two sides taking widely divergent positions on fundamental aspects
of the Japanese economy. The American government believes the
Japanese have not responded to U.S. demands regarding market
barriers, the ministry official told Kyodo.
   During the telephone call, the news reports said, Bush also
congratulated Kaifu on his governing Liberal Democratic Party's
victory in Sunday's elections for the nation's powerful lower house.

<TEXT>
   With an eye toward ending a half
century of Soviet rule, Lithuanians today voted for a new
legislature that could be led by non-Communists and will
undoubtedly seek independence for the Baltic republic.
   The reformed Lithuanian Communist Party, which broke with Moscow
and advocated independence for the republic, made a strong bid to
retain power.
   It is unclear whether Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev will
allow the Soviet republic to break away, but some political leaders
expect Lithuania to proclaim independence as early as this summer.
The Lithuanian Communist Party broke from the national party in
December.
   At least six legal parties and the front-runner Sajudis popular
movement are vying for seats in the republic's 141-member Supreme
Soviet. Lithuania in December also became the first of the Soviet
Union's 15 republics to legalize parties other than the Communist
Party.
   ``This day is a line between the past and the future,'' said
Vytautus Landsbergis, chairman of Sajudis, shortly before marking
his paper ballot at a high school in Vilnius, the capital.
   Polls opened at 8 a.m. (midnight EST) and were to close at 8
p.m. (noon EST), the official Tass news agency said. Officials said
they expect the first preliminary results Sunday with official
results available Tuesday.
   Voters lined up to vote under clear skies and 50-degree
temperatures.
   ``I think these elections will mean independence for Lithuania.
But they are only a first step,'' said Rimantis Jankauskas, an
employee of Vilnius University, clutching his young daughter's hand
after he voted.
   ``We must be realistic about this,'' he said. ``We are still on
the very beginning of a very long road of negotiations with
Moscow.''
   About 30 men marked Soviet Army Day in Vilnius on Friday by
turning in their military I.D. cards, saying they refused to serve
in an ``occupation army.''
   A newspaper quoted Algirdas Brazauskas, leader of the republic's
Communist Party, as saying last week: ``All of Lithuania seeks an
independent state. The re-establishment of statehood is the central
aim of the rebirth of our people.''
   In 1940, the Soviet Union absorbed the three Baltic republics _
Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia _ under a secret agreement in which
Josef Stalin and Adolf Hitler divided central Europe between them.
They had been independent for 22 years.
   The government chosen by the new legislature will seek to
negotiate an orderly departure from the Soviet Union, said
Landsbergis.
   Sajudis, which has attracted hundreds of thousands of people to
rallies in this republic of 3.6 million people, is the clear leader
in today's election.
   It supports about 30 candidates of the Lithuanian Communist
Party.
   Sajudis and the Lithuanian Communist Party are contesting nearly
every seat. Members of the pro-Moscow Alternate Communist Party,
including candidates from Lithuania's 200,000 ethnic Russian
minority, are running in 78 districts.
   Many smaller parties with smaller slates of candidates sprang up
during the campaign, including the Social Democrats, Democrats,
Greens and Christian Democrats.
   A total of 475 candidates are running for the 141 seats, and
only eight are unopposed. Under Gorbachev's political reforms there
are no guaranteed seats for Communists.
   Canadian parliamentarians, invited by Sajudis, are to monitor
the election. Bob Rae, a member of the Canadian delegation, said
Moscow refused visas to several U.S. congressmen when they claimed
the status of official observers.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev said visas were
denied because the Americans did not have official invitations. He
said they could visit the Soviet Union later.
   A few campaign signs were up Friday. Outside Sajudis
headquarters in Vilnius, the capital, a steady stream of people
examined the posted election information and pictures of candidates.
   Sajudis leaders say they are not breaking away from the Soviet
Union so much as reclaiming a sovereignty usurped illegally.
   After the Red Army occupied Lithuania, the parliament was
coerced into voting to join the Soviet Union, which formally
annexed it on Aug. 24, 1940.
   The Baltic states became independent in 1918, after the collapse
of Russia and Germany in World War I.

   About 4,000 radical students and
dissidents shouting ``Down with Roh Tae-woo!'' fought riot police
in six cities today, news reports said, in the largest
anti-government demonstrations this year.
   Also today, on the eve of his second anniversary in office, Roh
said he expects his country, which has long been staunchly
anti-Communist, to establish full diplomatic relations with the
Soviet Union and China.
   Police firing tear gas charged about 1,000 students holding a
protest rally at a park in central Seoul. Students hurled hundreds
of firebombs and tore bricks and cement chunks from sidewalks to
throw at combat-clad riot police who drove students back with
barrages of tear gas.
   ``Let's crush the anti-democratic merger that tramples the
people's sovereignty!'' yelled students, demanding the dissolution
of a new governing party created by the merger of Roh's party with
two others.
   The students, dissidents and workers surged through the narrow
streets of a fashionable downtown Seoul shopping area shouting
anti-government slogans. Police kicked and punched students and at
least 50 were arrested.
   About 600 students at Chosun University in Kwangju fought riot
police with firebombs and rocks when they were stopped from
marching from the campus, news reports said. Anti-government
protests by a total of 2,400 people were held in the cities of
Chonju, Anyang, Suwon and Mokpo, said the Chosun-Ilbo and Hankook
Ilbo newspapers. There were no reports of serious injuries in the
protests.
   Radicals, a small but vocal minority, have dwindled in recent
months but dissidents and radicals claim a new giant governing
party created in January by the merger of Roh's party with two
others is undemocratic.
   The newspaper Joong-Ang Ilbo quoted Roh as saying ``I am
convinced South Korea will be able to establish formal ties with
the Soviet Union and China. ... It will be a matter of time.'' Some
news reports said Roh indicated full ties with Moscow could occur
before the end of the year.
   The Dong-A Ilbo, an influential Seoul daily, quoted Roh as
saying ``The establishment of formal relations with the Soviet
Union and China will be eventually realized, probably at different
times.''
   South Korea agreed in December to exchange limited consular
relations with Moscow. Seoul has said it will soon send a
government delegation to Beijing to discuss sending consular
officials during September's Asian Games.
   Roh also said he was optimistic he would visit the two Communist
countries before stepping down as president at the end of his
five-year term in 1993.
   Under his detente-oriented ``Northern Policy,'' Roh has been
trying to improve diplomatic and trade relations with China, the
Soviet Union and other East European countries. Seoul hopes
improved relations with Communist North Korea's allies will help
ease tension on the Korean peninsula.
   The Seoul government does not allow its citizens to travel or
communicate with rival North Korea without government approval,
which is seldom given. Pro-Communist activites are illegal in South
Korea. But travel to other Communist nations has been eased with
the new diplomatic initiatives.

   A Syrian gunboat opened fire on a
passenger ferry carrying 116 people off the coast of Lebanon,
killing one passenger, crew members said.
   At least 15 people were reported wounded, four critically. The
shellfire also caused a fire on board.
   The gunboat attacked the ferry Baroness M three times in an hour
19 miles west of the Lebanese port of Jounieh, third officer
Andreas Michaeliks said. The ferry had been steaming toward the
Lebanese Christian port.
   The gunboat flew a Syrian flag and the name Aoudah was visible
on its side, crew members aboard the ferry said.
   Crew members said the sailors on board the 150-foot-long gunboat
fired warning shots over the ferry and then hailed it in
Syrian-accented Arabic.
   ``They asked us who was on board and where we were going,'' said
Egyptian mechanic Mohammed Mohammed al-Murshidi, 27. He said he
talked with them over the radio because most of the ferry crew
spoke only Greek or English.
   Later, as the ferry turned back toward Larnaca, the gunboat
fired shells at the captain's quarters and into passenger areas,
the ferry crew said.
   ``When the Baroness M radioed for help for the wounded
passengers, the Syrian boat hauled down its flag,'' crew member
Danny Zarour said.
   The ferry returned to Larnaca with at least 20 holes visible in
its side as it docked. One of the shells went through a window on
the central deck housing the bar and the cafeteria, causing most of
the casualties, Michaeliks said.
   Crew members said one man was killed. He was identified as
Nasser Abu Nasr, 26, who was going to Lebanon to pick up his family.
   Cypriot police earlier had said two people were killed.
   British Royal Air Force helicopters earlier evacuated nine men
and two women to Larnaca, three in critical condition. A fleet of
ambulances rushed the wounded to local hospitals for treatment.
   Flight Lt. Dick Bardon said four wounded remained on the
Baroness, one too badly injured to be winched aboard the
helicopters.
   Most suffered cuts and burns in the legs from shrapnel.
   The Royal Air Force put two doctors and a paramedic team onto
the deck of the ship to assist the wounded, Bardon said.
   The ship carried 64 passengers and 52 crew members, said Nora
Kasbari, spokesman for Socomar, agents for the ship.
   The port of Jounieh is controlled by the Lebanese Forces, which
have been locked in a three-week battle for control of Lebanon's
Christian enclave with Christian Gen. Michel Aoun.
   The Lebanese forces also has a share in the ferry operations.
   The waters off Lebanon also are regularly patrolled by the
Syrian and Israeli navies. Gunboats controlled by Aoun also had
been reported at sea.
   The boat, one of two that travels to Lebanon from Cyprus, is a
main escape routes for Christians in embattled Lebanon, many
fleeing the army-militia confrontation that erupted Jan. 30.
   The captain and crew of the ship had been reluctant to take it
into Jounieh because of the risks involved in the fighting.
   Jounieh is 120 miles east of Larnaca, a seven-hour journey.
   The ferry service and other maritime traffic came under fire
repeatedly during six months of fighting in Lebanon in 1989 between
Aoun and the Syrian army with their Lebanese Moslem militia allies.
   The ferries were not hit, but at least eight ships were sunk or
set on fire, including small boats taking passengers out to the
ferry waiting off shore.

   The ruling Communist Party has agreed to
remove its representatives from the workplace _ a key demand by the
democratic opposition _ and to postpone elections by one month,
informed sources said today.
   The Communists' Supreme Council, at the same closed-door meeting
Friday, also decided to let Communists vote on whether to change
the name of their party to the Bulgarian Socialists Party, the
state BTA news agency said.
   All Communist Party members would be eligible to vote in the May
plebiscite, BTA said. Communist parties in Soviet bloc countries
further along the road to democracy already have reformed as
Socialists professing democratic ideals, in an attempt to win
support ahead of multiparty elections.
   The Supreme Council agreed in principle to abandon the Communist
Party's right to organize in factories, enterprises and
administrative units, sources said.
   The council, which replaced the policy-setting Central Committee
under a decision by a recent party congress, proposed the measure
be included in a new law on parties expected to be adopted during a
National Assembly session beginning March 5.
   The Supreme Council proposed to hold Bulgaria's first multiparty
elections in June, not in May as previously announced. However, the
opposition has repeatedly demanded that elections be held in
November, the sources said.
   Talks between the Communists and the opposition Union of
Democratic Forces and other political and social groups were
suspended Feb. 12 because of disagreement over the party cells and
other political demands.
   The talks began after longtime Communist strongman Todor Zhivkov
was toppled Nov. 10.
   The agreement to get Communist representatives out of the
workplace was welcomed by opposition representatives as a positive
step.
   ``It is a good sign because the Communist Party understands that
they must do something'' to show their commitment to democratic
change, said Alexander Karakachanov, a member of the opposition
coalition and president of the Bulgarian Greens Party.
   However, Karakachanov, who was reached by telephone from Vienna,
said he believed the opposition would still go ahead with a protest
rally Sunday in downtown Sofia, ``maybe not at the same level'' as
originally planned.
   In a statement read on national television Friday, the
opposition urged citizens to attend the weekend rally to protest
the Communists' stalling on reforms.
   The declaration, read on TV by Georgi Spassov, the spokesman for
the opposition coalition, also proclaimed the days until March 3 as
``days of protest and struggle for freedom and democracy.''
   In another concession to the opposition, the Supreme Council
proposed that in future the national holiday should be March 3, not
Sept. 9.
   Since 1944, the national day has been Sept. 9 when a national
front, dominated by the Communists, took over. On March 3, 1878,
under a peace treaty signed between Turkey and Russia, Bulgaria
became independent after nearly 500 years of Ottoman Turkish rule.

   A halt in shipments of Chinese
weapons crippled an offensive by Cambodian guerrillas and allowed
government forces to retake a strategic northwestern town, fighters
and Western diplomats have said.
   Senior guerrilla officials also said France halted secret arms
supplies to one of the rebel groups fighting the Communist
Cambodian government after the covert program was publicized.
France denied such shipments were made.
   China has been the main supplier of arms to three of the groups
fighting the Vietnamese-installed government, and the guerrillas
said in interviews that the halt in shipments is unprecedented in
11 years of fighting.
   It was unclear whether the suspension indicated a policy
decision or logistical problems. A Chinese diplomat in Bangkok _
speaking on condition of anonymity, as most of the other sources
did _ last month denied there was any change in support for the
resistance.
   The Khmer People's National Liberation Front said it has not
received Chinese shipments in three months, and Prince Norodom
Sihanouk's group also has reported shortages. It was not known
whether supplies to the Communist Khmer Rouge, China's main ally in
the resistance coalition, were affected.
   Gen. Pan Thai, chief of staff of the Khmer People's National
Liberation Front, on Friday blamed the loss of the northwestern
town of Svay Chek to Cambodian troops on the shortage of arms.
   Svay Chek _ a gateway to the government military operations
center at Sisophon and biggest prize of the front's recent
offensive _ was retaken Friday in the government's first major
victory.
   ``The (government) could never have taken back Svay Chek if we
had the ammo,'' Pan Thai said in an interview at Aranyaprathet, a
Thai border town. ``We would have taken Sisophon a long time ago.''
   ``We have nothing. No mortars, rockets, nothing. We have asked
the Chinese many times since December, but nothing,'' Pan Thai said.
   A Western diplomat in Bangkok on Friday confirmed the halt in
shipments and agreed it had crippled the guerrilla offensive.
   The guerrillas had seized a wide swath of territory along the
Thai border since late September, when Vietnam said it withdrew its
last troops. The Liberation Front seized Svay Chek Dec. 5 and said
it was pushing toward Sisophon, but fighting decreased in recent
weeks.
   Some Liberation Front commanders said they believed China is
punishing the front for refusing to cooperate more closely with the
Khmer Rouge. The Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people
during its three-year rule, which began in 1975 and ended with the
Vietnamese invasion in 1978.
   The commanders said the shipments ceased after a meeting in
early December in which Chinese officials requested closer
cooperation with the Khmer Rouge.
   Senior guerrilla officers also reported that last year France
halted its weapons supplies to Sihanouk's group after the covert
program was publicized.
   They said France had been supplying sophisticated FA-MAS assault
rifles and Luchaire AC rifle grenades as well as LRAC 89 mm
anti-tank guns, which helped shift the tide of the war after
September.
   The French did not supply the other two guerrilla groups.
   Reporters saw at least a dozen fighters carrying FA-MAS rifles
among the guerrillas guarding Sihanouk when he crossed into
northwestern Cambodia Friday to end 11 years of exile.
   Reporters have seen other French-supplied weapons in areas of
northwestern Banteay Meanchey province newly seized by the
guerrillas.
   The French Foreign Ministry issued a denial when the Thai Army
chief of staff said in April that French arms were being shipped to
the guerrillas through Thai territory. The shipments were halted
sometime later in the year, the guerrilla officers said. Western
diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, on Friday confirmed
their account.
   France, a former colonial power in Indochina, is among many
non-Communist countries that extend diplomatic support to the
resistance.

   British brewers and archaelogists wanting to know
how ancient Egypt made its beer plan to examine the ruins of a
brewery, read hieroglyphics and search for tiny amounts of the
liquid in ancient pottery.
   News of the three-year project, launched by a leading British
brewery and the nation's prestigious Egypt Exploration Society,
drew headlines in London newspapers on Friday.
   ``Brewers seek the Pharaohs' secret,'' said one. ``Explorers
seek the recipe for Tutankhamen's beer,'' boasted another.
   The Independent called it one of the first large-scale research
projects to be undertaken jointly by archaeologists and a
commercial British company.
   When the researchers have figured out what went into brewing
beer in ancient Egypt, the brewery will try to reproduce it at its
laboratory in the Scottish capital of Edinburgh.
   But Jim Merrington, corporate affairs director for Scottish and
Newcastle Breweries PLC, said he wasn't sure if the fine ale of the
pharoahs would be offered to tipplers in British pubs.
   ``It is highly improbable it will appear on the bar, but it is
not beyond the realms of possibility,'' he told a news conference
Thursday in Edinburgh.
   He said the project will be based largely on archaeological
excavations at Tell-el Amarna, one of Egypt's ancient capitals
located 190 miles south of Cairo.
   Archaeologists from the society, led by field director Barry
Kemp of Cambridge University, are investigating a royal brewery
there attached to a temple built by Queen Nefertiti.
   She was the leading wife of King Tutankhamen's father, the
Pharaoh Akhnaton, whose name also was spelled Akhenaten or Ikhnaton.
   Tutankhamen reigned from 1333 to 1323 B.C. His tomb was
discovered in the Valley of the Kings at Luxor in 1922. His solid
gold coffin and other fabulous treasures found inside captured the
imagination of the world.
   Merrington said Nefertiti's temple, each side of which measures
750 feet, had its own brewery and bakery for making beer and bread
for religious festivals. Both processes employ yeast.
   But no one knows what the beer tasted like.
   Ancient texts and wall paintings suggest there were several
different beers, ranging from thick gruelly ales to those of a
finer texture.
   Wall paintings from Tutankhamen's day depict courtiers vomiting
after getting drunk on beer. Another wall painting shows Nefertiti
pouring her beer through a strainer to remove lumps of gruel.
   Merrington said the archaeologists hope to find minute traces of
the beer. If they're successful, he said, scientists working for
Scottish and Newcastle would use a chemical process to test those
samples to try to determine the ancient brew's taste and
consistency.
   ``Apart from what the archaeologists give us, we hope to examine
beer residues left in pots which are now in museums in Europe,
America and Egypt,'' Merrington said. ``We will use 20th century
technology which can identify flavors to come up with a recipe.
Then we will try to brew it.''
   Researchers on the project also will examine ancient Egyptian
hieroglyphics, tomb models and written material for clues to making
the beer.
   ``The pyramids were built on a diet of bread and beer, with
bakeries and breweries operating together,'' Kemp said. ``The
ancient Egyptians baked a kind of bread first, then used it as a
mash from which to brew the beer.''

   With a healthy crew and clear skies,
NASA started the countdown today for an early Sunday launch of the
thrice-delayed space shuttle Atlantis and its secret military cargo.
   Atlantis commander John O. Creighton, whose sore throat and head
congestion were a factor in earlier postponements, is well and
ready to fly, doctors said Friday. And the foul weather that has
hung over Kennedy Space Center since Thursday faded.
   Early today, NASA workers moved Atlantis' service structure
away. A few hours later, according to sources, the countdown toward
launch resumed at 9:40 a.m. EST.
   The countdown and precise launch time are secret until the final
nine minutes, but NASA said liftoff will be between midnight and 4
a.m. Sunday. Sources said the most likely time is around 1 a.m. EST.
   Forecasters said there is a 70 percent chance of favorable
weather for launch. A slight increase in predicted winds lowered
the probability from 80 percent forecast Friday.
   ``We do expect it to get better as we go into the day,'' said
Air Force Capt. Ken Warren. ``We think the winds will die down.''
   Atlantis' flight path after launch is expected to be roughly
parallel to the eastern U.S. coastline, passing within a few
hundred miles of some points. If the skies are clear, residents
from northern Florida to New Jersey may be able to see the rocket
fire of the space-bound shuttle.
   Creighton's illness and uncertain weather forced NASA to cancel
launch attempts on Thursday and Friday. The astronaut recovered in
time for a launch early today, but NASA officials did not even
start the countdown after rain, dense leaden clouds and
thunderstorms moved into the area on Friday.
   Sources who spoke on condition they not to be named said
Atlantis will deploy a $500 million spy satellite called AFP-731
during a four-day mission. The satellite is capable of taking
high-resolution reconnaissance photos and listening in on
electronic communications all over the world.
   Sources said the satellite is to be placed into a high
inclination orbit that will cover more of the Earth than satellites
previously launched by the shuttle. This orbital path will carry it
over most of the Soviet Union, including areas far to the north.
   The Soviet Union has similar satellites over the United States.
   Once Atlantis is in orbit, progress of the mission will be
blacked out. Unlike shuttle flights with civilian payloads, NASA
will not release the air-to-ground communications or give reports
on the astronaut activities.
   The blackout will be lifted just an hour before Atlantis returns
to Earth for a landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California.
   Creighton's four crewmates on Atlantis are Air Force Col. John
H. Casper, Marine Lt. Col. David C. Hilmers, Air Force Col. Richard
M. Mullane, and Navy Lt. Cmdr. Pierre J. Thuot.
   Atlantis' flight will be 34th space shuttle mission and the
sixth secret military mission.

   Students and anti-government
protesters today stoned buses and blocked off a suburb, witnesses
said, after police tricked protesters into leaving a church and
then beat and arrested them outside.
   About 100 students ran through the central Boulevard de la
Republique, yelling ``Liberty!'' and ``Free our comrades!'' Police
did not respond.
   Also, the clandestine Ivorian Peoples Front said the government
banned its newsletter following a first edition that urged a
peaceful transition to democracy.
   Students, who have clashed with police since Monday and pose the
strongest opposition in years to conservative President Felix
Houphouet-Boigny, demanded reform after electrical power at their
university campus was cut off. They want a multiparty government
and have protested officials' lavish lifestyles during a time of
austerity.
   A Roman Catholic Church official accused a Cabinet minister of
lying about assurances for the safe passage of 200 student
protesters who were beaten and detained when they ended their
10-hour occupation of the capital's cathedral.
   The official, who requested anonymity, said a priest who
accompanied the students, the Rev. Jean-Pierre Koutouan, also was
beaten by police and briefly detained.
   The official said he had reports that hundreds of students took
to the streets of Yopougon, a high-density suburb housing four
university dormitories where the trouble started Monday night.
   He said protesters had blocked the suburb to traffic. But other
observers said it may have been sealed off by students or security
forces.
   On Friday, about 200 students in the capital holed up in St.
Paul's Cathedral. As night fell, police attacked more than 400
other students gathered opposite the church in downtown Abidjan.
   A policeman who identified himself only as ``a commandant''
threatened journalists at the scene. ``Go away. We'll beat you
up,'' he said.
   At about 1 a.m. today, the students inside the cathedral ended
their sit-in. For nearly an hour, they were photographed by police
who took down their names before letting them out the gate.
   When the students left the cathedral, they milled outside the
gate for nearly two hours, obviously frightened. At one point they
tried to get back into the cathedral, but were blocked by armed
police.
   Koutouan reportedly negotiated a safe passage for them and they
boarded police trucks, which drove around the corner to the main
police station.
   As Koutouan walked away from the station, the thwack of batons
was heard and police were seen beating the students, who cried out
in pain.
   It was not immediately known how many students were injured in
either incident, nor how many students remained held.
   British journalist Mark Huband, the Abidjan-based correspondent
of the London Financial Times, said he was in the cathedral when
Koutouan told students the police had agreed to let them go free if
they all were photographed.
   Huband said the students initially refused, saying they feared
police would attack them.
   Houphouet-Boigny, 84, who has ruled this West African country as
a one-party state since its independence from France in 1960, has
refused recent demands for a multiparty government.
   The nation's economy is struggling through a recession that has
brought unemployment and pay cuts to what was one of Africa's more
prosperous countries.
   Earlier Friday, militant students released the manifesto of a
new organization. It said demonstrations were ``the result of years
of suffered injustices.''
   The manifesto demanded, among other things, salary cuts for
Cabinet ministers and other high-ranking government officials in
line with wage cuts of up to 30 percent that have been imposed on
lesser government employees.
   The students said they were against the ``opulent lifestyles''
of officials while ordinary citizens suffer from a recession caused
by falling cocoa and coffee prices. The manifesto demanded the
government do something to solve the problem of agricultural prices.
   The annual per capita gross national product has fallen from
$1,200 in 1981 to $700 last year. The government has reacted
slowly, running up a $12 billion foreign debt.

<HEAD>Chinese Province Restricts Marriages of Handicapped</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A northeastern province has barred people with
physical or mental disabilities from marrying or giving birth,
official reports said Saturday. It was the second Chinese province
to pass such laws.
   The reports said the legislature in Liaoning province enacted
the regulations to prevent women from giving birth to babies with
mental and physical defects. It said the law would improve the
quality of the population.
   The law, which takes effect July 1, also forbids close relatives
from marrying.
   Gansu province, in China's remote and poverty-stricken
northwest, passed a law in 1988 ordering all mentally retarded
people who married to be sterilized and all mentally retarded women
to have abortions if they became pregnant.
   The China Daily newspaper said the Liaoning regulations ban
marriages between directly related members of one's family,
collateral relatives within three generations and individuals not
confirmed to have recovered from veneral disease and other
infectious diseases.
   It said two-year observation after hospital treatment is
compulsory for people with serious mental disabilities if they want
to marry.
   The newspaper did not say if mentally handicapped couples would
be subject to sterilization, and officials contacted in Liaoning by
telephone could not provide additional details of the regulations.
   However, the official People's Daily reported earlier this month
that a district in the Liaoning city of Benxi had already imposed
rules that required people suffering from congenital or hereditary
ailments to be sterilized before getting married.
   It said that as a result of close monitoring of marriages and
births, not one of the more than 10,000 babies born in Xihu
district between 1987 and 1989 suffered from mental or hearing
disabilities.
   The China Daily said 12 out of every 1,000 children born in
Liaoning had physical or mental disabilities and that 14 out of
1,000 children below the age of 14 were mentally handicapped.

   Thousands of radical students and
dissidents shouting anti-government slogans fought riot police with
firebombs and rocks in six cities Saturday, the eve of President
Roh Tae-Woo's second anniversary in office.
   In central Seoul, riot police dressed in combat gear fired
barrages of tear gas and charged about 1,000 students holding a
rally. Students hurled hundreds of firebombs, as well as bricks and
chunks of cement pried from sidewalks.
   ``Down with Roh Tae-woo!'' students shouted. ``Let's crush the
anti-democratic merger that tramples the people's sovereignty!''
   The students were demanding dissolution of a new governing party
comprising Roh's party and two opposition groups. They say the
merger is undemocratic and a ploy by the Roh government to stifle
moves toward democracy.
   It was the most widespread show of anti-government sentiment so
far this year and also included protests in the cities of Kwangju,
Chonju, Anyang, Suwon and Mokpo. Support for the radical students
had dwindled in recent months, but the surprise party merger in
January prompted renewed demonstrations.
   Roh, speaking on nationwide television Saturday, discounted the
possibility the new governing party would bring about a return to
authoritarian government.
   ``The path toward democratization should never be blocked, and
authoritarian rule is a thing of the past,'' said Roh, who took
office after months of anti-government demonstrations in 1987
forced his predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan, to allow the first free
nationwide elections in 16 years.
   At least four opposition legislators, members of the Party for
Peace and Democracy, joined about 50 dissidents at Seoul's Anglican
Church after riot police blocked a rally at a downtown cathedral. A
party spokesman said the lawmakers went on their own initiative and
party policy opposed violence or joining dissidents to fight the
merger.
   At another protest in Seoul, 1,000 radical students ran through
the narrow streets of a fashionable downtown shopping area shouting
anti-government slogans. Police kicked and punched students and at
least 50 were arrested. There were no reports of serious injuries.
   At Chosun University in Kwangju south of Seoul, 600 students
fought riot police with firebombs and rocks when they were
prevented from marching from the campus, news reports said.
   There were no details of anti-government protests in the four
other cities, although some rallies were violent, said the
Chosun-Ilbo and Hankook Ilbo newspapers.
   Roh was sworn into office Feb. 25, 1988 for a single five-year
term. He was the handpicked successor to Chun, who had taken power
eight years earlier with military backing.
   One of the radicals' major demands has been the withdrawal of
43,000 American troops stationed in South Korea. The radicals say
the U.S. presence is an impediment to reunification of South Korea
with Communist North Korea.
   Under Roh, South Korea's staunchly anti-Communist government has
sought relations with Communist and East bloc nations to broaden
trade and establish ties, which it hopes will help ease tensions
with the North.
   Roh was quoted Saturday as saying he expected South Korea to
establish full democratic relations with the Soviet Union and China.
   ``I am convinced South Korea will be able to establish formal
ties...it will be a matter of time,'' the newspaper, Joong-Ang
Ilbo, quoted Roh as saying. Some reports said Roh indicated full
ties with Moscow could occur before the end of the year.
   Roh also said he believed he would visit the Communist nations
before stepping down as president at the end of his term in
February 1993.
   South Korea has already set up ambassadorial relations with
Hungary, Poland and Yugoslavia and is expected to establish formal
ties with Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia when South Korean Foreign
Minister Choi Ho-joong visits in March.
   South Korea agreed in December to exchange limited consular
relations with Moscow.
   The Seoul government does not allow its citizens to travel or
communicate with rival North Korea without government approval,
which is seldom given. Pro- Communist activites are illegal in
South Korea. Travel to other Communist nations, however, has been
eased with the new diplomatic initiatives.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers are taking steps to ensure that
feeding programs for the poor don't get short-shrift treatment in
the congressional draft of this year's major farm bill.
   Legislation called the Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic Hunger
Relief Act will be introduced Tuesday to improve food stamp and
surplus commodity distribution programs to the tune of $600 million.
   It's a joint House-Senate measure in honor of the former
chairman of the House Select Comittee on Hunger who was killed in
an airplane crash last year during a visit to Ethiopia.
   The bill goes farther than the Bush administration proposals,
but is expected to become the nutrition title of the farm bill
without major changes.
   ``To me, nutrition programs are not just a title added on to the
end of the farm bill,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of
the Senate Agriculture Committee, whose staff helped write the
legislation. ``To me, nutrition programs are a test of the
conscience of this nation. This farm bill cannot be complete until
the needs of the hungry are met.''
   The proposed legislation calls for an additional $600 million in
spending for both food stamp and free food programs over the
current budget year, which ends Sept. 30.
   The Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program changes would
require the government to raise from $120 million to $190 million
the amount it spends on of high protein food distributed free to
the poor each year.
   The legislation also would require the government to spend $32
million on commodities to be supplied to soup kitchens throughout
the five-year life of the farm bill.
   The food assistance programs are used widely in rural areas
where food stamps are difficult to get. About 15,000 food
distribution centers, mostly churches, hand out food the government
purchases especially for the program and surplus commodities
already owned by the government.
   A key change in the food stamp program is a provision that would
take greater account of higher housing costs.
   ``Studies show that some low income families pay up to 70
percent of their income in rent,'' said Ann Kittlaus, spokeswoman
for Food Research and Action Center, which has been lobbying for
the improvements.
   The new legislation would not set a dollar limit on how much a
person can pay in rent and still qualify for food stamps.
   A release from Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said that Kittlaus'
organization and 100 religious, government, health and low-income
advocacy groups endorsed a ``statement of principles that are
embodied in this bill.''
   Panetta, who once headed the House Agriculture subcommittee on
domestic marketing and nutrition, is now chairman of the House
Budget Committee. His interest is significant.
   ``We've made some very good progress with hunger relief
legislation to repeal some of the damage done in the early 1980s,''
Panetta said in an interview with the National Journal. ``The
problem we now have is that some barriers still remain.''
   Kittlaus, whose organizations works nationally and has lobbied
hard over the years to improve programs for the poor, said she was
encouraged by the Bush administration's approach to these problems.
   ``We've been in a lot more contact with the USDA than we ever
were during the Reagan years,'' she said. ``Their proposals are not
everything we would like them to be, but at least they are
listening.''
   ``At least they are saying there is hunger in America,'' she
said.

   Authorities closed several beaches in
southern England on Saturday, less than 24 hours after they had
been reopened, when two more containers of potentially lethal
potassium cyanide were sighted.
   The public was barred from the beaches along the Sussex coast
earlier in the week after six containers of the chemical were found
there.
   Officials believe the containers may be from a vessel that
recently lost part of a chemical shipment off England during rough
weather.
   Brighton officials told the public to stay away from a 10-mile
stretch of beach around Brighton after one container washed up
Saturday at nearby Hove and another was seen floating off Saltdean.
   ``As long as there are still containers floating in the sea
there is a danger to the public and they should stay away,'' a city
spokesman said.

   A court Saturday sentenced a man
to hang for trafficking in marijuana but acquitted his wife, saying
she didn't know about the 21 ounces of cannabis authorities found
hidden in their home.
   Abdullah Zawawi Yusoff, 41, became the 248th person condemned to
death for drug trafficking since Malaysia passed laws in 1975
allowing the courts to give that sentence to convicted drug
dealers. Of those people, 82 have been hanged.
   The High Court said in its ruling Saturday that prosecutors had
failed to prove that Abdullah's wife, Ma Kalthom Idris, 33, knew
the box of marijuana had been hidden in the kitchen of their home
in Kota Bahru, 240 miles northeast of Kuala Lumpur.
   It was not known whether Abdullah would appeal.

   The deputy speaker of Parliament
resigned Saturday, two months after an opposition legislator
accused him of appearing in pornographic videotapes, the state-run
news agency said.
   The letter of resignation from D.P. Vijandran was received by
Parliament Speaker Mohamad Zahir Ismail, who said Parliament would
be informed on Tuesday.
   The Bernama news agency said the letter did not give a reason
for the resignation, which took effect immediately. However, the
communications minister, S. Samy Vellu, told reporters the deputy
speaker resigned to prevent opposition parties from using the
scandal for political gain.
   Vijandran will retain his Parliament seat.
   In December, opposition lawmaker Karpal Singh alleged in
Parliament that Vijandran had acted in pornographic videotapes and
demanded his resignation.
   Vijandran denied the allegation and filed a defamation suit
against Karpal Singh.

   Lt. Duane Gerstenberger clearly remembers
the night he and other state police set up Michigan's first
sobriety check lane nearly four years ago. The only people who
complained were the two drivers arrested out of 126 who were
checked, he says.
   But this week, the practice is the subject of arguments before
the U.S. Supreme Court, with civil libertarians urging the court to
rule it's unconstitutional and 30 states weighing in on the side of
Michigan officials.
   Officers set up roadblocks for an hour and 20 minutes on May 17
and 18, 1986, in front of a Vlasic pickle factory about two miles
north of Interstate 75 near Saginaw.
   ``It would have lasted longer, but it rained so hard we had to
take it down for our officers' safety,'' Gerstenberger said Friday.
   ``The drivers were there for 15 to 30 seconds. We didn't get any
negative feedback on it, except from the two we arrested,'' said
Gerstenberger, who supervised the operation.
   Authorities dropped charges against one of the suspects, and the
other's case is awaiting the outcome of a constitutional challenge
brought by state lawmakers. The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday is
expected to consider whether sobriety check lanes violate the
Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches.
   David's Party Store, located on the four-lane highway near where
the 11-man police contingent set up, saw its business dry up that
night. Word spread to the Der Eisenbahn Bar, about a half-mile
south of the check lane. It cleared out by 12:30 a.m., and most
drivers took routes to avoid the check lane.
   ``I had some people come in and tell me they were going to buy
some beer but decided against it once they saw the police cars,''
party store owner Tim David told The Saginaw News at the time.
   ``People are always skittish on this road because this is the
main route for the state police,'' David said Friday. ``Their post
is less than a mile from here.''
   Nearly four years later, the checkpoint isn't a daily topic of
conversation, but, ``We're wondering what's going to happen,''
store clerk Connie Lavery said.
   So is Howard Simon, executive director of the Michigan chapter
of the America Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU orchestrated the
challenge in which six legislators won a court order forbidding the
state police from setting up more sobriety checks after the first
try.
   ``This is the first case in the history of this country in which
the Supreme Court will be considering whether police can stop
people for no reason whatsoever to enforce a criminal law,'' he
said.
   Michigan Attorney General Frank Kelley said briefs supporting
sobriety check lanes have been filed by 30 states and the U.S.
Department of Justice. Alcohol was blamed in 793 traffic deaths in
Michigan and more than 18,500 nationally in 1988, the latest year
for which statistics are available.
   ``Driving a car is not a constitutional right. It is a privilege
granted by the state,'' Kelley said. ``All we we're doing is taking
30 seconds of a motorist's time.''
   Gov. James Blanchard in 1986 directed state police to set up the
check lanes. The state appealed a February 1989 Michigan Supreme
Court decision that let stand lower court rulings declaring the
check lanes unconstitutional.
   Anti-drunken-driving groups such as Mothers Against Drunk
Driving defend the check lanes as relatively unintrusive.
   ``What we consider an intrusion is when a driver is stopped
abruptly on the highway and your body is mutilated in an accident
caused by a drunk driver,'' said Bethany Goodman, executive
director of the Michigan chapter of MADD.
   Kelley defends the procedure as a brief inconvenience that
constitutes less of a search than the security measures at airports
or border entry points.
   Former state Rep. Rick Sitz, now of Tampa, Fla., was one of the
original opponents.
   ``It's just like in the movie `Casablanca,' where Claude Rains
turns to the gendarmes and says, `The colonel has been shot. Round
up the usual suspects,''' he said. ``That's what they want to do
with check lanes. Groundless searches or dragnets have no place in
our society.''
   The Michigan Sheriffs Association has another argument against
the check lanes, arguing that they are a waste of police resources.
   ``Give me 14 officers and I'll put them on the road with their
only assignment being to find and arrest drunk drivers and if they
don't bring in a minimum of one arrest each, they aren't worth
their salt,'' deputy director Dale E. Davis said.

   The frown turns to a smile at the sound of
giggling. Sam Jones whirls around, pointing at the line of
frolicking schoolgirls.
   ``It wasn't too long ago the people here were too scared to let
the kids out,'' Jones says as the girls skip by. But his smile
turned to a scowl as he returned to his account of the past, saying
``there were drugs and guns, mostly fear. The parents were afraid
to walk around, never mind the kids.''
   An alliance of residents and builders is creating a reborn
community with few signs of fear, fewer of drugs, and none of guns.
Today, the signs are of hope and promise.
   So far, Glenarden's turnaround is a story of success, one
residents and owners say is a model for subsidized housing
developments nationwide where drugs and violence have added terror
to the troubles of low-income families.
   Glenarden is owned by an investors group arranged by Associated
Financial Corp. of California and managed by an AFC affiliate. The
companies, and a web of affiliates, late last month were suspended
from any new Department of Housing and Urban Development business.
HUD says it is investigating allegations the companies misused
government and tenant funds at several developments in Oklahoma and
the District of Columbia.
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp says AFC is one of a handful of
companies that make lucrative fees by syndicating low-income
housing tax credits but put too little money back into the troubled
developments they take over.
   At Glenarden, however, the owners are setting aside a portion of
their credits to pay for bathroom vanities and other fixtures that
HUD said were too extravagant to be paid for with the development's
government loan.
   Residents of Glenarden say they are pleased about a better
living environment, no matter how it happened.
   ``I used to be embarrassed to live here,'' says Frances
Howerton, a 20-year Glenarden resident. ``But I feel great pride
now. We are becoming a true community.''
   Less than two years ago Glenarden was known not as a community
but as ``the drugstore,'' with cars often lined up to buy drugs
from dealers stationed outside the drab rows of apartment
buildings. Inside those buildings were rodent-infested units with
leaky pipes and sagging ceilings; families too poor to move, too
scared to mingle outside.
   ``At its worst we had unending drug infestation,'' says
Howerton. ``Most of the drug dealers who were here didn't actually
live on the property. It was just the best place to do business.''
   The new facades on the renovated buildings are the most obvious
sign of change. Inside, new cabinets and appliances line the
kitchens, the bathrooms have been remodeled and fresh paint covers
the walls. A model unit is used to give residents tips on cleaning
and energy efficiency.
   Howerton says the most important change is in the attitude of
residents, who are steadily being moved into renovated units, and
the owners, whose rental license had been suspended before they
agreed to the ambitious $15 million renovation plan.
   ``Families are no longer afraid to speak up, to have a voice in
what is going on around here,'' she says. Howerton, president of
Glenarden's residents association, speaks highly now of the owners
and managers she once scorned.
   ``There is a deep trust now,'' she says. ``We have learned to
trust one another.''
   The owners, however, have had little time or reason to celebrate
their success.
   During tours in December and again last week, AFC officials
talked of taking the lessons learned here to troubled projects
elsewhere. They talk now about getting out of the low-income
housing business while fighting HUD's sanctions.
   AFC, which denies any wrongdoing, said last week it is
negotiating to turn over control of most of the 45,000 subidized
apartment units it controls at 350 properties in 35 states.
   The dispute, likely to trigger a lengthy court battle, pits HUD
against one of the nation's largest landlords of subsidized
housing; 1988 Republican presidential hopeful Kemp against AFC
President A. Bruce Rozet, who has raised hundreds of thousands of
dollars for Democrats.
   AFC is assuring the residents of Glenarden the fight with HUD
won't make vain the battle being won here.
   ``We won't leave Glenarden until the work is finished,'' says
AFC vice president Richard Tell, who has spent most of the past
year at Glenarden supervising the renovations. ``We've come too far
here to walk away now.''
   A reminder of the stakes lies just down a hill from the first
row of renovated units.
   The windows of this apartment are covered with plywood, the thin
beams of sunlight sneaking past the edges providing the only inside
light because the fixtures have been ripped from the walls and what
is left of the ceiling. Broken glass and beer cans line the floor.
   ``Was a crack house,'' Jones says quietly.
   Outside, bulldozers are turning the giant complex into a handful
of villages, a plan not only designed to give residents a greater
sense of community but also to take away from dealers the easy
escape routes police say stymied past attempts to curb the drug
trade.
   Roads that once connected now are being blocked off, leaving
just one access route for each village. The gate will be guarded by
a tenant.
   The work is scheduled for completion in the fall. Then, Howerton
says it will be up to the tenants.
   ``After what we've been through here, you have to learn a new
way of thinking,'' she says. ``It's a matter of changing attitudes
about the way you live. But we have a voice now. Because of that
you're going to take pride in what you do and you're going to take
care of it.''

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
predicted Saturday that talks on the future of U.S. bases in the
Philippines will be ``very difficult'' given a wave of
anti-Americanism there.
   ``I ... sense that the political dynamics and the current
environment are such that it's difficult to find elected leaders
who are willing to stand up publicly and embrace the continuation
of the current arrangement,'' Cheney told reporters while en route
to Washington at the end of a two-week visit to Asian capitals.
   Cheney was burned in effigy and hundreds of protestors demanded
the closure of the six U.S. military sites during the secretary's
talks in Manila.
   The wrangle over the bases _ whose leases are due to expire in
1991 _ marred an otherwise successful trip for Cheney, his first to
the region as defense secretary.
   President Corazon Aquino, upset over negative coverage of her
coup-plagued government in the U.S. media and Congress' decision to
cut $96 million in support for the bases, refused to see Cheyney
during his visit.
   Yet he went out of his way to praise Mrs. Aquino and her
committment to democracy, and Cheyney reported that she responded,
albeit not in person.
   ``I received a nice response from her through a third party,''
Cheney said. He declined to identify the individual who carried the
message.
   In talks with Philippine Defense Minister Fidel Ramos, Cheney
said the United States would abandon the bases if it finds that
keeping them is too expensive or that Americans are unwelcome.
   After Cheney left Manila, Mrs. Aquino said she was ready to
discuss ``in security and good faith'' differences over
compensation for the bases.
   Cheney, asked whether he was willing to name a date for such
talks, would say only that Washington ``is eager to have the talks
begin as soon as possible.'' They are expected to begin in April,
but no date for opening the exploratory talks has been set.
   The defense secretary said he believes the majority of Filipinos
want the Americans to stay. But there appeared to be little
sympathy among the Philippine political leadership for the economic
difficulties in Washington that have led to aid cutbacks and tough
talk about compensation for the bases.
   ``The historic ties are strong,'' Cheney said.
   But, he added, ``I also came away from my trip ... with the view
that the negotiations are going to be very difficult.''
   Cheney said his effort to reassure Asian allies of the U.S.
commitment to the Pacific was ``well received,'' even though he'd
informed them that some 10,000 to 13,000 U.S. troops probably will
be withdrawn from the region by 1993.
   His hosts in South Korea and Japan were willing to listen to his
requests that they kick in additional support for those troops, he
said.
   Cheney said the exact details of the drawdown have yet to be
worked out, adding, ``the numbers could change by small amounts
once we get it all together. ... I want to review carefully those
plans myself.''
   He said he couldn't predict a dollar amount in savings, saying
that would depend on which units are chosen to be withdrawn.
   ``Clearly, we'll be able to save some money,'' he said.
   Asked about future cuts, he said he'd reassess the situation at
the end of the three-year period for ``possible adjustment levels.''
   ``But that will depend on developments. There's no way you can
predict. ... what things are going to look like three years from
now,'' he said.
   ``I think it was generally well received,'' Cheney said of his
trip.
   He said his message of fewer troops and less money to pay for
them may have come as a shock to some.
   ``Change is always a little disconcerting in the region, but I
felt that, especially the Japanese and Koreans, were understanding
and sympathetic and prepared to support the overall initiative,''
he said.
   The secretary was asked about prospects for opening U.S.-Soviet
talks on troop levels in the region, given the opening he's taken
with the unilateral force reduction.
   He didn't rule it out, but pointed to the difficulties
surrounding such negotiations. In the Pacific and Asia, Cheyney
said, ``We don't have the kind of formal framework you have in
Europe,'' such as the NATO and Warsaw Pact alliances that allow for
negotiations on conventional troop reductions.

<HEAD>Jury Must Decide Exxon Skipper's Sobriety from Inconclusive
Evidence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the final days of prosecution
testimony against Joseph Hazelwood, the state has revived the
question of whether the Exxon Valdez skipper was drunk when his
tanker went aground.
   The defense calls the issue ``a red herring,'' but its
resolution by a jury will help determine whether Hazelwood is
convicted or acquitted on an array of charges.
   After three weeks of testimony and 39 witnesses, there is
extensive but inconclusive evidence about alcohol.
   Did Hazelwood spend a day ashore drinking before his ship
sailed? Some crew members say he had a few drinks at a bar in the
port city of Valdez. The wife of a Coast Guard investigator insists
she saw the skipper drinking earlier than anyone else. And several
witnesses said they smelled alcohol on his breath.
   But the skipper denies being drunk and not a single witness has
said he appeared intoxicated.
   Repeatedly, defense attorneys have asked witnesses: ``Was the
captain impaired? ... Did he slur his words? ... Did he stagger?''
The answer has been, ``No.''
   In a last-minute effort to bolster his position, Assistant
District Attorney Brent Cole proposed calling in speech experts
from Canada and Indiana who claim they can tell by listening to
speech patterns whether a person is intoxicated.
   The experts analyzed tapes of Hazelwood's conversations with the
Coast Guard for the National Transportation Safety Board and
concluded he sounded intoxicated.
   Defense attorney Michael Chalos called the speech analysis
``voodoo stuff'' and argued it has never been admitted as evidence
in any U.S. court.
   ``I understand it's less reliable than a lie detector test,
which is inadmissible,'' said Chalos.
   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone, who chastised Cole for
proposing this tactic so late, hasn't decided whether to allow the
testimony.
   Hazelwood, 43, a seaman from Huntington, N.Y., has a history of
drunken driving convictions and underwent 28 days of voluntary
rehabilitation in 1985. But jurors can't be told about that because
a defendant's prior record can't be used against him.
   Hazelwood is charged with second-degree criminal mischief, which
is a felony, and three misdemeanors _ operating a vessel while
intoxicated, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil.
He could draw 7\ years in prison and $61,000 in fines if convicted
on all counts.
   Recklessness is a key element in proving the charges, and
drunkenness would support a finding that Hazelwood was reckless in
leaving the control of the tanker to a third mate and helmsman
during a dangerous passage.
   The Exxon Valdez rammed jagged Bligh Reef on March 24, 10
minutes after Hazelwood had left the bridge. Its oil tanks were
ripped open, gushing nearly 11 million gallons of Alaska crude oil
into the clear waters of Prince William Sound, the nation's largest
oil spill ever.
   Allegations that the captain was drunk surfaced soon after.
   ``This alcohol issue has been blown up out of proportion and had
nothing to do with the grounding,'' said Thomas Russo, one of
Hazelwood's defense lawyers. ``The whole hype that was put out
about Captain Hazelwood being drunk hasn't panned out.''
   Why, then, was the issue raised? Prosecutors have consistently
declined to comment outside court, but their case shows that two
investigators who boarded the Exxon Valdez shortly after its
grounding reported smelling alcohol on the skipper's breath and
called for blood alcohol tests of the crew.
   Hazelwood's test, administered 10{ hours after the grounding,
showed he had a blood alcohol level of .06, lower than the Alaska
state limit for driving but higher than Coast Guard limits for
operating a commercial vessel.
   Others who were aboard reported smelling liquor on Hazelwood but
seeing none of the physical effects of drunkenness. William Murphy,
the marine pilot who boarded the Exxon Valdez to guide it through
the tricky Valdez Narrows, testified Hazelwood was ``absolutely''
in command of his tanker although he detected the odor of alcohol
on the skipper.
   Prosecutors played for jurors Friday a tape of Hazelwood's first
post-accident interview in which he said he drank only one beer in
Valdez and one or two bottles of Moussy, a brew with almost no
alcohol that was permitted aboard the tanker.
   If so, how could his blood have tested positive for alcohol so
long after the accident? A prosecution alcohol expert will try to
explain, and after the state rests Tuesday, defense experts will
give their theories.

<HEAD>The Cruel Truth: Tax Laws No Less Mystifying This Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   February has been a cruel month for people who
like their taxes simple.
   It was during this month that most people began giving serious
consideration to their tax returns; they opened up the instruction
booklet and found the system generally is just as complicated as a
year ago.
   So complicated, in fact, that Internal Revenue Service
Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg Jr. complained to the House Ways and
Means Committee that the laws and regulations ``are imposing an
unacceptable burden on taxpayers and our system of tax
administration.''
   If people can't understand the law, Goldberg said, they ``will
engage in shortcuts and not fully comply. It's that simple: a 1
percent drop in compliance costs the treasury more than $5
billion.''
   In the same Capitol Hill hearing room two weeks later, there was
another message _ from dozens of special interests, ranging from
big-time charities to low-income soldiers to tuxedo rental shops _
pleading for the kind of special tax breaks that add complexity to
the law.
   And finally, the payoff: Money magazine announced that 50 tax
professionals who had been commissioned to prepare the return of a
hypothetical family came up with 50 different tax liabilities that
ranged from $9,806 to $21,115.
   The magazine's $130,000-a-year, make-believe family had some tax
problems that the typical family would never encounter, but some of
the experts made mistakes on some basic issues, such as moving
expenses, that even a low-paid American might have to confront.
   All this is happening 3{ years after Congress and then-President
Reagan agreed on a major tax overhaul whose main selling points
were fairness and simplicity.
   The new law made taxpaying simpler for as many as 6 million
low-income people by removing them from the tax rolls. Another 10
million found things simpler because they lost some valuable
deductions and no longer had reason to itemize.
   However, there was a consensus among witnesses testifying before
Congress that the new law resulted in little simplification for
most Americans. As a result, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.,
chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, has launched a new
simplification initiative and asked the public for suggestions.
   Rostenkowski won't find many in Congress who disagree that the
system is overly complex. As in the past, however, he is likely to
hear warnings that in many cases, complexity is the price paid for
fairness.
   For example, repealing the deduction for charitable
contributions would free more than 25 million people from a lot of
recordkeeping and paperwork, but it also would cost them a big
deduction and could mean a loss of revenue for churches, schools
and organizations that help the poor.
   The tax system is probably as simple as it is going to be for
people whose incomes are almost entirely from wages, interest and
dividends. Whatever simplification comes about in the near future
probably will be for the benefit of those whose returns reflect a
lot of stock transactions, partnership income and more exotic
investments.
   Most of that simplification would have to come from the IRS,
which writes thousands of pages of regulations each year spelling
out exactly what the tax law means. Goldberg already has his own
simplification initiative under way, aiming, for example, to
produce basic regulations that are as broad as possible and that do
not attempt to cover every conceivable exception.
   Such an approach might mean there might never be another
222-page regulation such as the one last year whose sole purpose
was to define the term ``passive activity.''
   The Bush administration also is pushing simplification, using
the complexity argument to oppose several targeted tax breaks that
were proposed to the Ways and Means Committee last week. However,
the administration is recommending a package of targeted tax
increases and tax cuts that would add their own complexity.
   The capital-gains tax cut that President Bush wants would have
three different levels of taxation, depending on how long an asset
was held. The president also wants to create four tax incentives
for the oil industry and recommends a new deduction for parents who
adopt children with special needs.
   Rostenkowski and other Democratic leaders recall that repeal of
a capital-gains provision was a key factor that led to passage of
the 1986 overhaul. They fear restoration of the benefit would be
the first step toward repealing the overhaul and wiping out
whatever simplification the law produced.

<HEAD>Nazi Hunter's Claims Challenged By Founder of Israeli Security
Agency</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The founder of Israel's security services says
famed Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal played no significant role in
the capture of Adolf Eichmann 30 years ago, despite Wiesenthal's
claims to the contrary.
   ``Wiesenthal had no role whatsoever in either the discovery, the
identification or the capture of Adolf Eichmann,'' Isser Harel says
in an unpublished manuscript made available to The Associated Press.
   Harel challenges the enduring legend of Wiesenthal as the dogged
tracker who supplied key information that enabled Israeli agents to
locate the Nazi fugitive in Argentina.
   While not an entirely new dispute _ Harel and Wiesenthal clashed
years ago _ the Harel manuscript was the most detailed effort yet
to debunk Wiesenthal's claims.
   ``This is a matter of jealousy,'' Wiesenthal said in a telephone
interview from Vienna.
   Harel said he held off disputing Wiesenthal before now because
he did not want to ``give satisfaction to Jew-haters and Nazi
sympathizers.''
   But Harel said he could no longer keep quiet. He said that
although he would not publish the manuscript commercially, he
wanted it preserved for historians. ``History must express the
truth about this case,'' he said.
   With few exceptions, the 79-year-old Harel has avoided the
spotlight. He founded Mossad, the legendary Israeli intelligence
agency, and masterminded the 1960 operation in which Mossad agents
kidnapped Eichmann in Argentina and spirited him to Israel for
trial.
   Eichmann ran the Gestapo bureau for Jewish affairs and was
accused of responsibility for planning and ordering the deportation
and murder of 4 million Jews. He was convicted by an Israeli court
and hanged in 1962.
   While Harel remained largely unknown, the 81-year-old Wiesenthal
gained world fame as a Nazi hunter, a reputation that began with
accounts of his role in the Eichmann case.
   In books written over 30 years, Wiesenthal has recounted how he
narrowly missed capturing Eichmann in Austria in 1949, kept track
of his brothers and wife over the years, and supplied Israel with
information about Eichmann's whereabouts in Argentina as far back
as 1954.
   ``In all my books, I say it was team work. I never say I alone
was responsible'' for the Eichmann capture, Wiesenthal said.
   Yet, repeatedly in published material and most recently in a
1989 Home Box Office movie about his life, Wiesenthal is depicted
as instrumental to the Eichmann abduction.
   His first book, in 1961, was titled, ``I hunted Eichmann.''
   ``Adolf Eichmann, whose spectacular capture was engineered by
Wiesenthal,'' reads the flyleaf of Wiesenthal's latest book
``Justice Not Vengeance,'' scheduled for U.S. release next month.
   Harel does not dispute that Wiesenthal was among those who
sought Eichmann, nor does he deny the Holocaust survivor's pivotal
role in tracking Nazi fugitives and keeping alive international
awareness of the German atrocities.
   But in his 270-page manuscript, he said, ``All the information
supplied by Wiesenthal before and in anticipation of the operation
was utterly worthless, and sometimes even misleading and of
negative value.'' He repeated that assessment in a telephone
interview from his home in suburban Tel Aviv.
   ``Just as it's very critical to accurately depict Nazi crimes,
it is very important that the effort to bring to justice Nazi
criminals be truthfully recorded,'' said Neal Sher, who heads the
Justice Department's office of Nazi war crimes.
   While it is clear that many people were looking for Eichmann
after the war, ``there can be no doubt that the most reliable and
authoritative source on the Mossad operation that captured Eichmann
is Isser Harel,'' said Sher, who teaches a course at Cornell
University about the Eichmann trial.
   In the 1970s Harel told his account of the capture in a book
entitled ``The House on Garibaldi Street,'' which is where Eichmann
lived under an assumed name. Wiesenthal is not mentioned in the
book.
   Harel's book ``gives generous credit to others involved in the
affair,'' Sher said. Among those is Fritz Bauer, the West German
prosecutor whom Harel identified as the source of the information
that eventually led to Eichmann.
   Harel said he had not known the extent to which Wiesenthal took
credit for the operation until he visited the United States last
year on a fund-raising drive for Israel and repeatedly encountered
audiences who asked about Wiesenthal's role.
   ``He tried to erode Israel's role in the affair,'' Harel said.
   Wiesenthal rejected the accusation, but said that when he passed
on information to Israel in 1954 about Eichmann being in Argentina,
``no one believed me.'' When interviewed by a Mossad team in
Austria in 1959, Wiesenthal said, he again provided valuable
information.
   Yet in a March 3, 1960 summary of the interview, a translated
version of which Harel made available, the Mossad operatives said:
   ``We again found Wiesenthal to be avoiding full and sincere
cooperation, although he is prepared from time to time to feed the
ambassador crumbs of general information. ... We parted from
Wiesenthal very coldly.''
   In his books, Wiesenthal tells of informing the German Embassy
in Buenos Aires in December 1959 of Nazi fugitive Josef Mengele's
last two known addresses in the Argentine capital. This was done as
a test case to see whether the Argentine authorities, who were
sympathetic to the thousands of Nazi fugitives in their country,
would extradite the notorious death camp doctor, he said.
   Wiesenthal viewed their refusal to hand over Mengele as proof
that they would also have refused an Israeli request for Eichmann's
extradition.
   But Harel argues that Wiesenthal had no right to undertake such
a risky step without the approval of Israel, which was at the same
time closing in on both Eichmann and Mengele.
   Wiesenthal's action tipped off Mengele who ``decamped from the
Argentine a few weeks before we reached Buenos Aires. ...
Wiesenthal's initiative could have warned'' Eichmann too and
jeopardized his capture, Harel added.
   ``Here, Wiesenthal's folly borders on the criminal,'' Harel
wrote.

   The elections Sunday in Nicaragua are offering
the United States and that deeply polarized Central American
country a unique opportunity to have a more cooperative
relationship after long years of bitter rivalry.
   But that outcome is far from certain, and Nicaragua could well
continue to be a divisive issue both domestically and
internationally if the election results are tainted by allegations
of fraud, according to officials.
   For the Bush administration, the most desirable outcome would be
a victory by opposition candidate Violeta Chamorro. This would
bring about an early exchange of ambassadors, an end to the
five-year U.S. trade embargo against Nicaragua and a renewal of
U.S. aid for the first time in a decade.
   The thousands of Contra rebels stationed at base camps in
Honduras presumably would lay down their arms and return to
Nicaragua in peace.
   In addition, if the leftist government headed by President
Daniel Ortega is returned to power in an honest process, the Bush
administration has committed itself to a more normal relationship,
provided certain conditions are met in the election's aftermath.
   Secretary of State James. A. Baker III said Thursday his price
for friendlier ties is a ``sustained period of good behavior'' by
the Sandinistas.
   As the election approaches, Republicans and Democrats _ so often
at loggerheads over Nicaragua during the 1980s _ find themselves
generally in agreement on the basic elements of the situation.
   If Ortega wins and shows he is both committed to democratic
values and to refraining from interfering in neighboring countries,
the administration and the Congress agree that a new era in
U.S.-Nicaraguan relations is possible.
   The only differences are in the pace and scope of normalization;
Democrats generally seem willing to move more quickly and
comprehensively than Republicans.
   But what happens if Ortega declares victory in a situation in
which his announced margin is narrow and there are widespread
allegations of fraud?
   This outcome is widely expected among State Department experts
on Nicaragua. Although most polls in Nicaragua show Ortega with a
comfortable lead, officials here believe Mrs. Chamorro has the
votes to defeat Ortega.
   The concern among officials is that Sandinista authorities will
be able to rig the result in Ortega's favor despite the presence of
about 2,000 foreign observers.
   President Bush will encounter a variety of competing pressures
if Ortega wins a disputed victory. If Bush decides that the
political costs of contesting such an outcome are too high, he
could declare it a flawed but acceptable result and then proceed
slowly toward normalization of relations.
   Some analysts argue that this course would benefit long-range
U.S. interests because the hand of hardliners in the Sandinista
government, including Interior Minister Tomas Borge, is weakened
when U.S. policies are conciliatory. Under this scenario, Ortega
also would be more inclined to loosen his ties to his chief
hemispheric ally, Cuba.
   The offer of U.S. trade ties and financial assistance, according
to this theory, would give Ortega an incentive not to run afoul of
Washington.
   Alternatively, a tainted Ortega victory almost certainly would
produce conservative pressure on Bush not to endorse a process in
which there is a strong perception that the will of the Nicaraguan
people has been trampled.
   Former Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams says he is
concerned that if the administration blesses an election stolen by
Ortega, this would only embolden the Sandinistas to accelerate
their assistance to leftist rebels in El Salvador.
   Abrams says that during the past 2{ years, the Sandinistas have
dishonored every promise they have made concerning their links to
the FMLN rebels.
   ``How many agreements have the Sandinistas signed promising to
stop arming the FMLN?'' he says.
   Whatever the outcome Sunday, there appears to be little support
here for restarting the Contra war. It was two years ago this month
that Congress ended military aid to the rebels.
   A $49.5 million program of U.S. humanitarian aid for the Contras
is about to expire, and the administration soon will open
consultations with the Congress on what to do next.
   Democrats generally will favor an aid program designed to
repatriate the Contras while the administration is likely to
support a continuation of the existing program, under which food
and other aid is provided without strings.

   A Syrian gunboat apparently looking for
arms shipments to Lebanon shelled a passenger ferry traveling from
Cyprus to Lebanon on Saturday, killing one civilian and injuring
18, crew members and military officials said.
   The dead man was identified as a 26-year-old Lebanese who had
just obtained an emigration vist to Canada and was headed home to
pick up his pregnant wife.
   Crew members said the attackers menaced the Baroness M before
pumping 20 shells into it as it headed for the Lebanese port of
Jounieh.
   The ship was flying a Syrian flag and was apparently on guard
against weapons shipments to Lebanon, where the Christian army
leader opposes the Syrian-backed government and the presence of
40,000 Syrian soldiers deployed to quell civil war fighting.
   Military sources on Cyprus, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said they also believed the boat that attacked was Syrian.
   Greek Capt. George Samlotakis said the gunboat accosted the
ferry three times, first at about 4:30 a.m. when it was 19 miles
west of Jounieh.
   ``They asked us who was on board and where we were going,'' said
Egyptian mechanic Mohammed Mohammed al-Murshidi, 27. He said he
talked with them because most of the ferry crew spoke on Greek or
English, while those on the gunboat spoke Arabic.
   Samlotakis said he then turned the ferry back to Cyprus and
about 30 minutes later the gunboat approached at great speed.
   ``I immediately prepared to stop and was in the process of doing
so when suddenly, and without any warning, the gunboat opened fire
against us,'' said the captain.
   Salmotakis said 20 shells hit the ship, wrecking his cabin right
below the bridge and heavily damaging the bar and cafeteria on the
deck below, where many people had taken cover.
   ``There was terrible confusion and panic on board. There was
smoke and dust everywhere and people screaming,'' he said.
   ``We ran from one side of the boat to the other as the gunboat
circled,'' said Rima Suleiman, a receptionist on the boat.
   The captain said at dawn, two hours after the first encounter,
passengers and crew went to the top deck and waved flags and sheets
at the warship to signal that they needed help for the wounded.
   Crew member Danny Zarour said at that point, the gunboat took
down its flag.
   It stayed in the distance for awhile, then approached a third
time, the captain said.
   ``As if nothing had happened he ordered me to open the back
gangplank so that he could examine our cargo,'' he said.
   The Baroness M, designed to take cars on and off the back ramp,
usually travels with an empty hull to Lebanon. Only the passenger
baggage is stored in the area for cars.
   ``We told him we were a Greek ship under the Cyprus flag and he
told us go back to our country and don't try to come to Lebanon
again,'' Samlotakis said.
   The attack wounded 18 passengers, four critically, said a
spokesman for the British Royal Air Force bases on Cyprus. The
Royal Air Force has a major base at Akrotiri on the southern coast
of the island.
   The Royal Air Force evacuated 15 of the wounded by helicopter
before the ferry docked at Larnaca at 1 p.m., said the spokesman,
who declined to be identified.
   The wounded, most suffering cuts and burns in the legs from
shrapnel, were rushed to local hospitals for treatment.
   The dead man was identified as Nasr Abu Nasr, 26.
   ``He was hit by shrapnel all over his body,'' said Ms. Suleiman.
``He was sitting facing the bar exactly where a shell hit.''
   Nora Kasbari, spokesman for Socomar, agents for the ship, said
it carried 64 passengers and 52 crew members when it left Larnaca
late Friday for the seven-hour trip to Jounieh, 120 miles east.
   The boat is one of two that travels regularly between Lebanon
and Cyprus. It is a main escape route for Christians fleeing their
embattled enclave in Lebanon, where Christian army forces are
battling for control over the Lebanese Forces Christian militia.
   The port of Jounieh is controlled by the Lebanese Forces, which
also has a share in the ferry operations.
   The ferry service and other maritime traffic came under fire
repeatedly during six months of fighting in Lebanon in 1989 between
the Christian army leader, Gen. Michel Aoun, and the Syrian army
and its Moslem militia allies.
   Syrian troops were deployed in Lebanon in 1976 under a
peacekeeping mandate to quell civil war fighting. Aoun said they
violated the mandate by siding with the Moslems in the war and
vowed to drive them out.

   A man who emigrated from Poland 2{ years
ago has been charged with strangling his wife one week after she
arrived in Canada with their two children to join him, authorities
said.
   Marian Frej, 42, was charged Friday with second-degree murder
after an autopsy indicated that his wife, Joanna, 34 had been
strangled. Her body was found Thursday in the bedroom of her
husband's townhouse.
   The victim arrived in Canada from Poland on Feb. 16 with the
couple's two children, ages four and six, said city police
inspector Jim Balmain.
   The children are now in the care of another family member living
in the southwestern Ontario city, said police.
   Marian Frej, who was unemployed, had been studying English at a
local college.
   There was no known motive for the killing.

<TEXT>
   President Bush has invited not only the
nation's governors to dinner Sunday, but the entire population of
Tuna, Texas, to boot.
   And they are all coming, in the persons of Jaston Williams and
Joe Sears, the comic actors and quick-change artists who put Tuna
on the theatrical map back in 1982.
   They have since performed ``Greater Tuna,'' their two-man,
two-dozen character take-off on small-town Texas life nearly 2,000
times from Austin to off-Broadway to Edinburgh, and this past
December they unveiled a seasonal sequel, ``A Tuna Christmas,''
that broke records at the Kennedy Center.
   It was there that two transplanted Texans now residing at 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue, George and Barbara Bush, decided the madcap
spectacle of two guys jumping in and out of dresses, overalls, wigs
and characters would be just the thing to cap an evening with the
governors.
   The state dinner, for governors, in town for their winter
meeting, is a traditional event. Pianist Michael Feinstein
performed last year.
   But who would have thought a Republican president from Yale
would get a kick out of two avowedly liberal entertainers who first
conceived their ``Tuna'' satire as a thumb-in-your-eye riposte to
the Moral Majority?
   ``You just never know,'' said Williams, ``but we knew better
than to say no.''
   The Bushes came backstage after taking in the show Jan. 6 on
their 45th wedding anniversary.
   ``The president asked if we were from Texas. He leaned to Mrs.
Bush and said, `We must have these boys over to the White House,'''
Williams recalled in an interview.
   They were still in their dressing gowns during that encounter.
When they showed up for tea with Mrs. Bush 10 days later, they were
wearing their Sunday finest.
   ``She's a very clever and funny lady. She had seen us in our
Texas attire backstage,'' said Williams. At the White House, she
eyed them and remarked, ``Well, you two clean up real nice!'' Then
she invited them back for the state dinner.
   Sears and Williams were also invited to dine with the governors,
but the duo is passing up the supper.
   ``We said we would just prefer to be backstage and warming up,''
said Williams. ``It would be a little hard to eat before the
performance.''
   The two will perform four scenes and six characters during the
25-minute skit. From ``Greater Tuna'' they will reprise a sermon by
a Bible-belting preacher and a funeral parlor viewing. They will
replay the holiday party from ``A Christmas Tuna.'' They will close
the evening with a skit especially written for the occasion: a
telephone call to the White House from a Tastee Kreme waitress.
   ``Joe will be bringing Aunt Pearl (Burras), Reverend Spike and
Bertha Bumiller,'' said Williams, ``and I will be bringing Vera
Carp, Helen Bedd and Arles Struvie.''
   Both actors now live in the Austin area. Williams was born in El
Paso, Sears in Oklahoma. After years as struggling actors
performing traditional fare, their take-off on life in the third
smallest town in Texas has brought both fame and fortune.
   Wiliams said his father, ``a grizzled, crusty old farmer, told
me, `Son, if you'd ever known what was going to happen, you should
have put that dress on 25 years ago.''
   ``When you can get your father to say that, I guess we have
crossed the last hurdle,'' said Williams.
   Or the next to last. Arles Struvie, Bertha Bumiller &amp; Co. may
cross the last hurdle in the East Room Sunday night.

<HEAD>Ethics Probers Eye Multiple Charges in Durenberger Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Ethics Committee is using a
standard tool of prosecutors _ combining major and minor charges _
to establish a potential pattern of misconduct by Sen. Dave
Durenberger in promoting his books, sources say.
   The committee on Thursday found ``substantial credible
evidence'' that the Minnesota Republican violated Senate rules and
federal law, mostly in promoting two books he authored. The panel
voted to hold a trial-like proceeding.
   Durenberger has launched a public relations effort that
emphasizes the less serious charges. His spokeswoman, Carrie
Collins, characterizes four of five potential rules violations as
minor ``bookkeeping'' or financial reporting errors.
   But sources familiar with the case, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the combined allegations suggest a pattern of
behavior that violated Senate rules to enable Durenberger to sell
books.
   And one allegation that Ms. Collins calls minor could escalate
into a major problem, sources said, if evidence shows a willful
attempt to file false financial disclosure reports.
   Former Rep. George Hansen, R-Idaho, was convicted in 1984 of
four felony counts for submitting false financial disclosure
statements to Congress. He served nearly a year in prison.
   The sources said the committee is mainly concerned in the case
with rulebreaking, not criminality, but the panel is obligated to
refer any criminal evidence to the Justice Department.
   In the possible violation that everyone agrees is major, the
committee said Durenberger may have exceeded limits on non-Senate
income when he accepted payments for speeches during 1985-86.
   Durenberger contends the money should not have counted toward
the limit, because he made the appearances as an author promoting
books _ not in his official capacity as a senator.
   Also during 1985-86, the committee said, Durenberger failed to
publicly disclose the travel reimbursements he received from the
organizations that hosted the book promotion speeches.
   Last July, four months after the committee began its
investigation, the senator amended his annual Senate disclosure
forms to include the information.
   This is the potentially troublesome allegation, sources said.
Former House Speaker Jim Wright resigned from Congress last year
after he was charged with 69 instances of rulebreaking _ including
evading outside income limits through bulk sales of his book.
   Other allegations cited by the Senate committee against
Durenberger involve: possible conversion of a $5,000 campaign
contribution to personal use by transferring the check to
Durenberger's publisher; using Senate space for commercial purposes
and acceptance of limousine service in the Boston area in 1985-86.
   The limousine was provided by host organizations so Durenberger
could visit his marriage counselor in Concord, Mass.
   The sources said the allegations are similar to a prosecutor
bringing felony and misdemeanor charges against a criminal
defendant. The lesser charges often would not have been brought by
themselves but become an important part of the case.
   Durenberger's public relations blitz, meanwhile, expanded
Friday. The senator sent a tape to all Minnesota radio and
television stations pronouncing himself pleased that the committee
will now ``get some sunshine on the facts.''
   Durenberger chief-of-staff Bert McKasy also released a
question-and-answer sheet to news organizations, emphasizing that
two potential allegations were dropped and the remaining case has
``been considerably narrowed.''
   Tom Horner, the senator's former chief-of-staff and now a public
relations executive in Bloomington, Minn., was hired recently by
Durenberger to aid in the counter-attack.
   Horner was quoted in Minneapolis as saying, ``The senator has a
concern that the full story is not getting out.''

<HEAD>Tennessee Rep. Asks Justice To Collect Fine from Former Senator</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former Sen. Harrison A. Williams Jr. still
owes the federal government much of his 1981 fine for bribery and
conspiracy and a Tennessee congressman says he should use his
federal pension to pay off the debt.
   Current law allows the U.S. government to recover debts from
federal employees by making deductions from their salaries and
retirement pay, the Justice Department says.
   However, it has never been tried with a member of Congress,
according to Assistant Attorney General Carol T. Crawford.
   ``The law is there apparently, but they've just never applied
it,'' said Jim Edwards, a spokesman for freshman Rep. John J.
Duncan, R-Tenn.
   ``I don't believe in kicking a man when he is down,'' Duncan
said of Williams, D.-N.J. ``However, the fact is that Senator
Williams owes the government money while he is being paid a
government retirement check. This situation should be corrected.''
   Duncan said only $2,324.23 of Williams' $50,000 fine has been
collected so far.
   Williams, reached earlier this month in New Jersey where he has
been helping at a drug treatment program, said attorney John D.
Arsenault was handling payment of the fine.
   ``It's worked out through my lawyer,'' Williams said. ``I know
Jack has worked out a program. And I'm going to be abiding with it.
It's all taken care of.''
   Phone calls to Arsenault's office in New Jersey were not
returned.
   Williams was released from prison in January 1986 after serving
two years of concurrent two-year and three-year sentences for
bribery, conflict of interest and conspiracy in the Abscam sting.
   In that FBI operation, undercover agents posing as middlemen for
Arab sheiks met with Williams. He agreed to accept a hidden
interest in a Virginia titanium mine in return for helping to find
military contracts for the venture, according to evidence at trial.
   Williams said in the telephone interview that the Abscam matter
was not yet behind him and he had filed Freedom of Information
requests to obtain material that could clear his name.
   Duncan began pursuing the matter of unpaid federal debts at the
request of Knoxville, Tenn., Mayor Victor Ashe, who had seen
published reports last September that Williams had drawn more than
$320,000 from a federal pension while owing most of his $50,000
Abscam fine, Edwards said.
   After a series of letters, Ms. Crawford wrote Duncan on Jan. 25,
1990, that the U.S. attorney's office in New Jersey was exploring
the possibility of pension deductions.
   ``Based on your and Mayor Ashe's inquiry, the U.S. attorney's
office is now investigating the applicability of these provisions
to Senator Williams' case and will utilize them to the extent
possible to recover his federal fine,'' she said.
   Spokesmen for the Justice Department in Washington and the U.S.
attorney's office in Newark declined to say whether they had
proceeded with deductions.
   ``We are actively pursuing the funds that we feel the department
is entitled to,'' said Doug Tillett of the Justice Department's
criminal division.
   ``The matter is in litigation,'' said Dick Lavinthal, a
spokesman for the U.S. attorney in New Jersey. ``When there is an
outstanding debt to the government we pursue it.''
   Ms. Crawford informed Duncan that other routes had been pursued
in collecting Williams' debt, such as seizing his federal income
tax refunds. However, she said Williams owns no real property and
his Bedminster, N.J., home was purchased in his wife's name,
preventing the government from using it to satisfy the debt.

   The helicopter appears as a pinlight on the
northern horizon, the brightest star in a dark blue sky.
   Coming closer, it shoots a wide beam of light over the rooftop
at Jackson Memorial Hospital and settles down with a shuddering
blast of tropical air. Two men inside have been shot twice each
with 9mm bullets, and one is dying.
   Dr. Jeff Vaughan, waiting on the landing pad, turns to a nurse.
``You're going to see blood now, sister,'' he says.
   But spilled blood is routine at Jackson Memorial's trauma
center. Already this evening, the trauma crew has treated a woman
shot by her boyfriend, a man dumped 30 feet off a scaffold, a
10-year-old bicyclist hit by a car and a prison inmate stabbed with
a homemade knife.
   That roster accounts for every serious injury suffered in the
Miami metropolitan area in the preceding six hours. If you're badly
hurt in Dade County these days, the only place to go is Jackson
Memorial.
   That distinction puts Jackson, a publicly financed teaching
hospital, at the forefront of a dismal national trend. It is one of
a shrinking number of big city hospitals offering special care for
trauma, the medical name given to life-threatening injuries.
   In Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and elsewhere, private
hospitals have been shutting down trauma units, most of which
opened in the mid-1980s, the specialty's boom years.
   The resulting squeeze threatens not only quality of health care,
but also the financial stability of the hospitals left carrying the
load.
   Gunfights, car crashes, the occasional industrial accident _
these are the lifeblood of trauma care centers. The American
College of Surgeons estimates that 250 to 350 trauma centers
operate around the country, ranging from such giants as New York's
Bellevue Hospital and Miami's Jackson Memorial to the N.T. Enloe
Hospital in Chico, Calif., and Easton Hospital in Easton, Pa.
   Trauma units are usually affiliated with, but distinct from,
ordinary emergency rooms. ERs handle broken legs, concussions,
poisonings, the lesser varieties of mayhem. Trauma units take over
in more serious cases of multiple injuries _ when lives are on the
line.
   Trauma centers are staffed by surgeons, and major trauma
hospitals keep full staffs of specialists on duty around the clock.
If you need a neurosurgeon at 3 a.m., Jackson Memorial will have
one.
   In rural and suburban areas, trauma is almost always the result
of auto accidents, and the drivers are usually insured. In these
areas, trauma centers pay their way, even make profits.
   But in inner cities, patients increasingly are members of what
doctors caustically refer to as ``the knife and gun club.'' Club
members have a couple of things in common: They are almost always
involved in drugs; they are almost never insured.
   At Jackson Memorial, which handles 6,000 trauma cases a year,
about one-third of the patients are admitted for ``penetrating
trauma'' _ knife or bullet wounds. About one-third of the patients
are uninsured.
   These are expensive injuries, and ``blunt trauma'' injuries
suffered in car crashes can be even costlier. It's not unusual for
trauma-care bills to mount into the tens or even hundreds of
thousands of dollars.
   ``Even with the paying patient, trauma is going to cost more
than the average treatment, more than what insurance will probably
pay,'' said Jeanne Eckes, a registered nurse who coordinates
Jackson's trauma service.
   Jackson estimates the trauma unit will lose at least $1.2
million this next fiscal year. In addition to direct losses, the
hospital loses money when trauma patients ``bump'' regular patients
out of operating rooms and intensive care beds. That happens nearly
every day.
   Of four patients admitted to Jackson's trauma center so far this
evening, three have been sent to the operating room or intensive
care. The lone exception is the luckless prison inmate, who's been
treated for his stab wounds and sent back to jail.
   It is already a grueling evening, filled with split-second,
life-or-death decisions. Even the janitor is busy, mopping up blood
from the trauma room floor.
   On a break in the action, Vaughan and another doctor, Alan
Rosenberg, wolf down dinner in the cafeteria. They are there when
Air Rescue calls about 10 p.m.
   Two men with gunshot wounds had shown up at a hospital eight
miles away. They couldn't be treated there _ the hospital doesn't
handle trauma. They are being flown to Jackson.
   On the elevator to the roof, Rosenberg and Vaughan turn goofy
with excitement. They stretch out on the two gurneys and joke and
slap five. They don't get serious until the helicopter is down, and
then, with the blades still blurring overhead, they get serious in
a hurry.
   Vaughan is first into the elevator with the more seriously
wounded man. Before the doors shut, he is frantically at work.
   ``He's not moving any air, man,'' he says, his voice tight with
tension. He shoves a tube down the man's nose and squeezes a
bulbous green bag. A hole in the patient's chest gurgles with blood.
   When the elevator reaches the ground floor, Vaughan runs with
the gurney to the trauma room. His patient is slipping away.
   Patients like this are flown to Jackson every day. The hospital
tallies more than 1,000 helicopter landings a year in what some
doctors say is a legacy of the Vietnam War _ the airborne rescue.
   Some people say the entire modern system of trauma care grew out
of the military's medical experience in Vietnam; others say it
evolved in large urban hospitals in the 1960s.
   Trauma care grew rapidly after research in the late 1970s proved
trauma centers routinely saved lives that would be lost with
ordinary emergency care.
   By the early to mid-1980s, trauma had become hot business. In
search of prestige and profits, hospitals jumped at the opportunity
to treat trauma victims, despite the expense of maintaining a
24-hour staff of surgical specialists.
   Some cities established trauma networks to ensure patients were
sent to the closest trauma hospital. Miami's network, established
in 1985, ultimately consisted of six private hospitals and the
public Jackson Memorial.
   B. Boyd Benjamin, the blunt-talking, gravel-voiced chairman of
the board of the Dade County Public Health Trust, recalls what
happened then.
   ``It was wonderful,'' he said. ``Big committees met, everything
was fine. And the first thing that happened, I guess, was some poor
sonofabitch got run over and didn't have a penny and he ends up at
one of these for-profit hospitals. And they want to ask, `Where's
your insurance?' `I don't have any insurance.' ... They found out
very quickly that this was going to be a loser.''
   In the space of six months in 1987, all six private hospitals
dropped out of the network, leaving Jackson the only metropolitan
area hospital willing to accept adult trauma patients (Miami
Children's Hospital accepts injured children).
   A similar winnowing process has taken place in other big cities
as hospitals discover their expected profits are elusive.
   ``They see it as fiscally irresponsible,'' said Dr. Gerald O.
Strauch, director of the Trauma Department at the American College
of Surgeons in Chicago. ``We all know that hospitals have become
big business, and they're managed like a big business.''

   In Los Angeles County, a regional trauma network with 23
hospitals has shrunk to 13. Chicago had 10 adult trauma hospitals
two years ago; the loss of another hospital this month will reduce
the number to six.
   Houston is down to just one Level I trauma center, capable of
handling the most serious cases. One of Philadelphia's major trauma
centers, Temple University Hospital, recently announced it was
leaving a regional trauma system.
   The hospitals that remain are increasingly overwhelmed, their
trauma centers resembling nothing so much as military MASH units in
the heat of battle. Indeed, the military sends its physicians to
inner city trauma centers to prepare them for combat.
   The consolidation of trauma care raises some daunting questions.
What happens to the patient who's in a serious auto accident and
has to be taken 25 miles to a hospital instead of five? Worse, what
happens when a plane crashes?
   ``It's gotten to the point where, no matter who you are, if
you're injured in a city, your chances of getting to a trauma
center that has everything it needs are getting slimmer,'' said Dr.
Jeff Augenstein, one of the attending surgeons in charge at Jackson.
   Jackson's administrators believe they've found a solution.
Having accepted their hospital's role as the city's only
trauma-care center, they intend to capitalize on it. They are now
trying to raise $25 million for what Benjamin, the public health
trust's board chairman, calls a ``state of the art, world class,
self-contained, free-standing shock-trauma center.''
   The idea is to get trauma patients out of the main hospital,
leaving more room there for regular, paying patients. ``Our
projections show that we will at least break even,'' Benjamin said.
   Hospital officials hope the new center will become a magnet for
research dollars and talented staff. In the meantime, doctors at
Jackson insist they can handle anything that comes their way.
   It is 10:14 p.m. when Jeff Vaughan wheels the gurney into the
trauma room. Half a dozen people jump to action. One slips an
oxygen mask over the patient's face, another takes blood. Vaughan
examines the body. It is young and strong and has bullet holes in
the chest and shoulder. Two police officers stand to the side,
watching.
   ``Where's X-ray?'' Vaughan hollers. ``C'mon, Hector, let's get a
quick film.''
   At 10:18, Vaughan inserts a tube nearly the width of a garden
hose into the left side of the man's chest. It begins pumping
hemorrhaging blood out of the chest cavity and into intravenous
tubes for transfusion. Vaughan's rubber gloves and gown are covered
with blood; red dots shine on his eyeglass lenses.
   ``What's his pressure?'' someone shouts.
   ``Very, very low,'' Vaughan yells back. ``He's got serious
problems in his chest.''
   He goes to the other side and inserts another tube. ``We've got
blood on this side too, guys, and lots of it.''
   Within minutes, the crisis ebbs. The patient's systolic blood
pressure, about 50 when he entered the trauma room, is up to 110.
His pulse is strong. He breathes with the aid of the oxygen mask.
   The gurney is pushed out the door and up to the operating room.
   ``He's a long way from being OK, but he's got a chance,''
Vaughan says.
   Bloody footprints mark the path down the hall.
   It has been a remarkable display of grace under pressure, but it
isn't enough this time. The patient dies 10 minutes into surgery.
   His buddy survives, and not for the first time. Medical records
show he's been treated at Jackson before for gunshot wounds _ six
times.
   ``Hey, man, you gonna get some frequent flier miles if you keep
coming in here,'' Vaughan tells him.
   Police say the two men claimed to have been attacked on the
street for no reason; the cops' tone suggests disbelief.
   Vaughan drifts into an employee lounge for a Dr Pepper and a
smoke. He is about 18 hours into a 24-hour shift and it is
beginning to show. He speaks bitterly about the strains of the job
and patients who ``would just as soon kill us as look at us.''
   ``It's a war zone,'' he says. ``And it's like this in every
major city.''

   East German Social Democrats, many
overcome with emotion and with tears in their eyes, on Saturday
elected former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt as their party's
honorary chairman.
   Brandt was among many top-ranking West German Social Democrats
attending the first national convention of the East German sister
party in Leipzig.
   Public opinion polls have predicted the East German Social
Democrats will be the leading contenders in next month's national
elections.
   The 76-year-old Brandt received a standing ovation after his
election. He is also honorary chairman of West Germany's Social
Democrats, who form that country's biggest opposition party.
   Brandt was mayor of West Berlin when the Berlin Wall was built
in 1961. As chancellor of West Germany from 1969 to 1974, he worked
for improved relations between East and West. His efforts won him
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971 and made him a hero to many East
Germans.
   Brandt was one of the first West German officials to step into
East Berlin after the Berlin Wall was opened Nov. 9 at the height
of the pro-democracy movement that made next month's elections
possible.
   Social Democrats in both countries have been urging East Germans
to stay and work for changes at home. Already this year, more than
100,000 East Germans have resettled in West Germany.
   ``It's worthwhile to stay here, it's worthwhile to start
again,'' Brandt told the 500 delegates. ``It doesn't make sense to
run away from a large part of Germany.''
   Despite the enthusiastic reception, there was some resistance to
making Brandt the honorary chairman. Several delegates argued that
an East German should have the title.

   Hundreds of people celebrated the
anniversary of the revolt that brought President Corazon Aquino to
power by lighting candles Saturday at an intersection where
Ferdinand Marcos' tanks were stopped in 1986.
   Elsewhere in Manila, Mrs. Aquino urged Filipinos to rekindle the
spirit of the 1986 ``People Power'' revolt to prevent further coup
attempts.
   Mrs. Aquino spoke to civil rights activists on the eve of the
4th anniversary of the military-civilian uprising that ended
President Marcos' 20-year rule and forced him into exile in Hawaii.
He died there in September.
   Hundreds of nuns, priests, businessmen, public officials and
other citizens marched from the armed forces headquarters to an
intersection a few miles away to offer prayers and thanks for the
revolution.
   The marchers formed a human chain and put the lit candles in the
shape of a giant cross. In 1986, citizens opposed to Marcos stopped
soldiers and tanks sent to the intersection to crush the rebellion.
   Mrs. Aquino _ who will lead a public celebration on Sunday, the
anniversary of the revolt _ criticized rebel soldiers who launched
a December coup attempt, the sixth and bloodiest bid to unseat her.
   ``Recently, our freedom was once again threatened by those who
believe that this government could be cowed by guns,'' Mrs. Aquino
said.
   She said the mutineers ``never learned their lesson. That if we
stood up, unafraid, for freedom in 1986, we will do the same this
year, next year or any year whenever our liberty is in danger.''

   President Bush welcomed West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl to his countryside retreat today, saying
their talks are of ``keen interest'' to people around the world.
   Just before Kohl arrived by helicopter from Dulles International
Airport near Washington, Bush told reporters he spoke this morning
to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney about his forthcoming meeting with Kohl.
   He said he also would talk with French President Francois
Mitterrand and other leaders as world attention focuses on the
fast-moving developments toward reunifying East Germany and West
Germany.
   ``I view this as a very important discussion,'' he said.
``There's a lot of keen interest not just in Europe but around the
world on these discussions we're going to have.''
   Light snow flurries fell as Bush, clad in a leather flight
jacket and wool slacks, and his wife, Barbara, welcomed Kohl and
his wife, Hannelore, to Camp David, the retreat in Maryland's
Catoctin Mountains.
   ``Welcome, welcome,'' said Bush.
   ``Wunderbar,'' Kohl replied before getting into a golf cart in
which Bush drove him from a helicopter landing zone to the Camp
David living quarters.
   Their talks are expected to focus on the rapid movement toward
reunification and when negotiations should be held on bringing the
two Germanys back together.
   Kohl's visit comes as East Germany nears its critical March 18
elections. One of his cabinet ministers predicted in a news report
Friday that the election will leave the East too divided to agree
on a government, and East Germany instead will opt for immediate
union with West Germany.
   Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble expressed this view to
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and national security adviser
Brent Scowcroft, the newspaper report said.
   Sometime after the March 18 election, talks on unification are
to begin between East and West Germany and the four major victories
allies of World War II _ the United States, France, the Soviet
Union and Great Britain.
   Baker and Scowcroft are joining Bush and Kohl today for the Camp
David meeting. Bush and Kohl both support reunification and agree a
united Germany should be a member of NATO.
   Besides discussing the timing of unification talks, they will
also discuss the future of U.S. troops in Europe.
   ``I would expect the two leaders to discuss the full range of
issues related to changes in Eastern Europe,'' including
reunification, a U.S. proposal on reducing conventional forces in
Europe, and the future of NATO and the Warsaw Pact, said White
House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater on Friday.
   ``We don't anticipate any new agreements or announcements,''
Fitzwater said.
   He said the meeting was a chance for the leaders ``to discuss
the status of events, where they think things are going,''
including West Germany's newly announced proposal for a one-to-one
currency exchange with East Germany.
   Kohl, just back from a trip to Moscow, also will give Bush an
account of his meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
who is talking now of a slower approach to reunification.
   The Camp David agenda could also include Poland's icy reception
to the movement toward reuniting Germany. Poland is worried that a
larger, Western-oriented Germany might reclaim territory that was
part of Germany but became part of Poland after World War II.
   Kohl has taken no position, but West German conservatives are
pressing to regain the territory.
   Bush has said his administration recognizes existing borders.
   Kohl comes to the United States on the heels of the Feb. 13
agreement in Ottawa calling for the two Germanies to develop a
unification plan and meet with the four other powers to approve it
and work out larger security issues.
   Under political pressure at home, Kohl also is looking to the
possibility that reunification will bring his party greater support
in elections scheduled for Dec. 2 in West Germany.

<TEXT>
   With his seizure of an armory to house
overflow prisoners, a mild-mannered county lawman with a master's
degree in social work was catapulted into a confrontation with
state officials.
   Hampden County Sheriff Michael J. Ashe had been best known for
innovative jail and community programs, ranging from one of the
first day reporting centers in the country to a jail garden teaming
inmates and senior citizens.
   Then on Feb. 16 he seized the National Guard armory, an action
applauded by guards, judges, citizens and even prisoners. He's
become a hero on radio talk shows. But the plain-spoken sheriff,
who never misses a wake or a wedding and once sneaked off to a
McDonald's to fill up after a fancy state dinner at the White
House, says he's never fancied himself as a rebel.
   ``I've always been a team player,'' he said. ``For the past 15
years I've been here we've worked very, very hard in a professional
way to try to manage the severe overcrowding.''
   ``We've looked in closets, in the garage and under the stairs.
And we've had prisoners in all those places. But there comes a
point where you run out of a `little magic.' And you just have to
go into the ring.''
   The sheriff admitted the timing of his move on the Friday
afternoon before the Presidents Day holiday was calculated. By the
time stunned state officials responded, he had 15 prisoners
installed in the armory and public opinion solidly in his corner.
   On Friday, state officials told a judge they would not challenge
his occupation for at least two weeks while looking for other
housing.
   Saturday, the number of prisoners stood at 17.
   For more than a decade, Ashe's knack of mixing toughness and
progressive social programs has kept a lid on his century-old
county jail.
   ``He believes inhumanity and coddling arrive at the same
point,'' said Richard McCarthy, jail spokesman. Rather than let
prisoners lie in their cells all day, McCarthy said, ``whether it
is one of the vocational programs or working in the kitchen, the
men have to answer the bell every morning just like John Q. on the
street and just like they will have to do when they get out.''
   One of the first things Ashe did after taking over the job in
1975 was to turn the sheriff's quarters at the jail into a 60-bed
pre-release center where inmates within six months of release get
extensive vocational, substance abuse and other counseling.
   In 1986 he added the day reporting center, where inmates with
four months left to serve can be released on a electronic
monitoring program that allows them to live at home as long as they
report in several times a day.
   More than 1,500 of the men that passed through his cells have
earned high school equivalency diplomas. He also started one of the
few prison industry programs to operate in a county jail. Last year
the office furniture-making operation returned $200,000 in profits
to the county, McCarthy said.
   Ashe reached the end of his patience with jail overcrowding
after more than a year of turning loose hundreds of prisoners to
meet a 500-inmate limit established by a federal judge. Previously,
Ashe had jammed 726 men into space supposed to house 279.
   ``It came down to a moral and ethical thing,'' Ashe maintained,
saying he could no longer live with the fear of having one of the
prisoners he released kill or maim. ``The system had collapsed. And
someone had to do something.''
   Born and raised in the Irish neighborhoods of Springfield, Ashe
married his high school sweetheart. Before running for sheriff, he
worked as a social worker, and he and his wife, Barbara, were the
first house parents in a program started by the Roman Catholic
Church to help homeless children. They have five sons and one
daughter.

   A judge has refused to dismiss television
evangelist Jimmy Swaggart and seven others from a $90 million
lawsuit filed by a preacher.
   Civil District Judge Richard Ganucheau ruled Friday in the
lawsuit filed by Marvin Gorman on Metairie.
   ``We're disappointed in the result, and we will proceed with
trial preparation,'' said Denise Pilie, Swaggart's attorney. Hunter
Lundy, Gorman's attorney, said the case could go to trial this
summer.
   Gorman claims Swaggart and others conspired to ruin his
reputation and his New Orleans-area television ministry by
spreading false stories that Gorman had numerous adulterous
affairs. Gorman acknowledged one illicit sexual encounter.
   At a Dec. 20 hearing, Swaggart's attorneys told Ganucheau that
statements made about Gorman were substantially correct and were
made as part of Assemblies of God disciplinary procedures in which
courts have no right to interfere.
   However, Gorman's attorneys argued that Swaggart and others made
defamatory statements long after Gorman left that church.
   Swaggart also was eventually ousted from the Assemblies of God,
the nation's largest Pentecostal denomination, for sexual
misconduct.

<TEXT>
   Stormie Jones, the world's first and longest
surviving heart-liver transplant patient, rested comfortably
Saturday as she continued her recovery from a second liver
transplant.
   Stormie, 12, of White Settlement, Texas, remained in critical
condition in the intensive care unit of Children's Hospital of
Pittsburgh, hospital spokeswoman Lynn McMahon said.
   The girl was placed back on a respirator to relieve breathing
problems she experienced Friday after fluid began collecting in her
lungs and other parts of her body.
   ``Doctors are trying to give her body a chance to rid itself of
some of the fluids,'' Ms. McMahon said.
   Physicians also downgraded Stormie's condition to critical, a
step down from critical but stable, which is how she was listed
after Tuesday's 10-hour transplant and a subsequent nine-hour
operation Wednesday to halt internal bleeding.
   Stormie probably will remain on the respirator for several days,
the hospital said.
   Surgeons were not worried by the development and expect her
recovery to proceed normally, Ms. McMahon said.
   Stormie's first transplant, in 1984 at Children's, was needed to
control effects of a rare disease that left her cholesterol levels
10 times greater than normal. The second operation resulted from
permanent liver damage caused by hepatitis.
   Her donor heart has remained healthy, doctors said.

   Tens of thousands of people chanting
``Freedom! Freedom!'' trekked to a Moslem saint's shrine Saturday
to campaign for the secession of Kashmir from India, witnesses and
pro-separatist activists said.
   At least three people died in two separate incidents on Saturday
in Kashmir, the center of the four-decade-old separatist campaign,
witnesses said.
   The deaths brought to 109 the number of people killed since Jan.
20 in the latest round of the secessionist violence and the
government crackdown.
   Meanwhile, the president of the Pakistan state of Kashmir said
in an interview Saturday that Kashmiris there had begun smuggling
arms across the border to Moslem insurgents fighting for
independence from India.
   President Abdul Qayyum, speaking to a reporter who traveled to
Pakistan's Kashmir, said the people of his state also had been
sheltering insurgents since India launched the military crackdown
in its state of Jammu-Kashmir last month.
   In India's Kashmir, the 600-year-old shrine of Shiekh Nuruddin
Wali at Charift Sharief, 20 miles northwest of Srinagar, became a
sea of humanity as Moslem men, women and children poured in from
Srinagar and nearby towns.
   Vehicles stopped 10 miles from the shrine as people thronged the
roads, said witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Supporters of the militants said they went to the shrine to seek
the saint's blessings to ``liberate'' Kashmir from India.
   In Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state,
residents were told by Moslem militants to put their clocks back by
30 minutes to correspond with the Pakistan standard time.
   The militants, led by the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, are
demanding either independence for Jammu-Kashmir, the only Indian
state dominated by Moslems.
   Groups of young Moslem men sat at street corners, stopping
passers-by and telling them to adjust their watches. At least six
fights broke out when people refused to comply, said witnesses who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   On Friday, at least 200,000 people marched to the office of the
United Nations Military Observers Group in Srinagar, demanding a
plebiscite in Kashmir, police said. Witnesses claimed that more
than 600,000 people took part.
   The U.N. group is posted to maintain a cease-fire line drawn
between Indian- and Pakistani-held Kashmir after a 1948-49 war over
the region.
   Residents, speaking on condition of anonymity, said security
forces fatally shot two men shouting anti-Indian slogans at Khrew,
15 miles southeast of Srinagar.
   In Srinagar, suspected Moslem militants shot and killed Ashok
Kumar, a Hindu government employee, witnesses said, also speaking
on condition of anonymity. Kumar was suspected to be a police
informer.
   India routinely accuses Pakistan of arming, training and
supporting the militants. The government in Islamabad denies the
charge but says the Kashmiri people have a right to
self-determination.
   An AP reporter who traveled to Pakistan's Kashmir last week said
state-run banks in the region have begun collections to help the
uprising. Signs in dozens of banks called for donations for ``a
holy war against India.''
   Naveed Hussain, a government spokesman in Pakistan's Kashmir,
said in an interview that $5,000 had been raised in a week and that
the money would be used to train Kashmiri militia groups in
territory held by Pakistan.
   Kashmir was divided between India and Pakistan after the two
countries were partitioned following the end of British colonial
rule in 1947.

   Jack Nicholson, Madonna, Steve Martin, Bill
Cosby _ it's not the A-list for a hot Hollywood party, but four of
America's top 100 collectors, according to the March issue of Arts
&amp; Antiques magazine.
   ``There are plenty of very rich people buying art who'll never
make this list,'' said editor Jeffrey Schaire. ``We seek out those
who forge their own ways, who often follow their passions down some
very unusual paths.''
   Madonna was cited for her collection of modern paintings and
photographs. ``I'm attracted to things that are about the sadness
of living,'' said the ``Material Girl'' singer.
   Nicholson likes American and European art and antiquities; his
collection includes everything from Monet and Picasso to Mexican
primitives and Etruscan bronzes.
   Cosby specializes in American furniture, paintings and folk art.
   Martin, a longtime collector of modern American art, recently
bought an Edward Hopper lighthouse painting, Arts &amp; Antiques
reported.
   Why is he attracted to paintings?
   ``A movie lasts an hour and a half,'' the comic actor explained,
``but a painting lasts two minutes or however long you're going to
look at it.''

   Two weeks after Buster Douglas dethroned boxing
champion Mike Tyson, he climbed into a roped-off ring for an
experience of an entirely different stripe.
   Douglas wore the referee stripes Friday at the World Wrestling
Federation title bout between Hulk Hogan and Randy ``Macho King''
Savage.
   His first task was fending off Savage's manager, Sensational
Sherri, who despite her sequined frock helped pound on Hogan.
   The Hulk retained his title, pinning the
hot-pink-and-yellow-clad Savage for a quick 1-2-3 count by Douglas.
   Some of the nearly 19,000 spectators at Joe Louis Arena may not
have expected such a short count from Douglas. It was a long count
in an eighth-round knockdown that allowed the boxer to go on to
knock out the previously unbeaten Tyson in Tokyo two weeks ago.
   The furious Savage lived up to his name, slapping Douglas, who
had climbed into the ring for the end of the match after calling
the shots from ringside. Hogan shoved the macho one toward Douglas,
and the boxer knocked him cold.
   Hogan then led Douglas around the ring with an arm outstretched
in victory, as adoring fans yelled ``Buster! Buster!''
   Douglas won his $100,000 role in the live NBC television show
when Tyson canceled after losing his title.

   Jeb Stuart Magruder says what he did as one
of President Nixon's aides pales in importance to his current work
as a minister.
   Magruder, who was imprisoned for seven months for perjury and
destruction of evidence in the Watergate scandal, discussed his
life as a minister last week after performing two funeral services
in Marion. He is a pastor at First Community Church in Columbus,
about 40 miles south of Marion.
   ``What I can do for those two families is much more than I ever
could have done in the White House,'' he said. ``I can't change
things, but I can help people deal with them.''
   One funeral was for the 54-year-old wife of a close friend, and
the other was for the 28-year-old daughter of a couple who attend
First Community.
   The ministry, he said, ``has changed my life and made it
meaningful.''

<HEAD>UMW-Pittston Settlement Leaves Some Miners Perplexed</HEAD>

   Steve Powers says he's relieved to be
going back to work Monday for Pittston Coal Group, 327 days after
1,695 United Mine Workers struck the company in a contract dispute,
but he's also perplexed.
   Both sides ended up getting basically what they said they really
wanted before the strike began: Union members have the job security
and health and retirement benefits they sought and the company has
its ``operational flexibility.''
   Now Powers said the miners are trying to figure out why it took
so long to end the fight, which cost the company and the union
millions of dollars and caused bitter divisions in coalfield
communities.
   ``It's hard for me to understand,'' the construction worker from
Clintwood said after studying the contract and hearing UMW
officials compare the terms with the contract that expired in
February 1988. Top scale went to $17.52 an hour for selected
positions, up $1.20 an hour.
   Perry Moore said he was equally confused, pointing out the
flexible scheduling that Pittston won. ``I can't figure out why we
were out 11 months just for that,'' he said.
   Pittston's UMW workers in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky
worked 14 months without a contract before UMW President Richard
Trumka called a strike April 5. Pittston had refused to agree to
the national contract the UMW negotiated with the Bituminous Coal
Operators Association, an industry group.
   Miners claimed throughout the strike that the motivation behind
Pittston's original contract proposal was to eventually set up a
non-union operation.
   Last Monday, the coal miners ratified a settlement that
negotiators reached New Year's Eve. The final ratification vote was
delayed while the two sides settled legal issues related to the
strike.
   Many miners link the progress on contract talks after months of
stalemate with the intervention of Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole
and her appointment of former labor secretary William Usery as a
federal mediator.
   Usery said part of his success in bringing the two sides
together was his ability to persuade negotiators to set emotions
aside and listen to their counterparts.
   Pittston President Michael Odom agreed. ``Bill Usery brought a
new light to the process,'' Odom told reporters after the
ratification was announced.
   UMW Vice President Cecil Roberts said Usery was able to get each
side to identify what provisions they truly needed in the contract.
   ``We all learned some lessons from this,'' Roberts said. ``It's
better to talk than to fight.''
   Asked to give his advice to future negotiators in labor
disputes, Odom said, ``Put yourselves in the other side's shoes.
And be innovative.''
   Odom bristled when asked if Pittston came out a loser.
   ``I feel like we were a winner,'' he said. ``We were not trying
to eliminate the union. We wanted flexibility.''
   The contract allows Pittston to operate for seven rather than
five days a week _ UMW members traditionally don't work Sunday _
and put some miners on a weekly schedule of four 10-hour days.
   Odom said during the bargaining that he couldn't understand why
the union was so opposed to the ``flextime,'' which he said will
allow Pittston to become more efficient, increase its coal sales
and hire more workers.
   ``It was a good compromise settlement for both sides.''
   The contract also includes a new profit sharing plan that gives
workers incentive to increase productivity.
   Mine worker James Gibbs said he hopes the contract will mark the
beginning of better labor relations with Pittston.
   ``Hopefully, that's what the profit sharing is in there for.''
   Last summer, the Pittston strike prompted thousands of workers
at other mines across the Southeast and Midwest to stage wildcat
sympathy walkouts.
   Violence also erupted sporadically during the strike.
Replacement workers and supervisory personnel were often pelted
with rocks when they drove to work and verbally abused when they
went to town.
   Now the replacement workers are gone, but the managers and
supervisors will be there when the miners return.
   ``There will be some tensions we will have to deal with,'' Odom
said.
   But Powers said: ``I know I'll be glad to get back to work. I
want life to get back to normal.''

   Rich and poor put on their dancing
shoes Saturday and kicked off Brazil's riotous Carnival, billed as
the country's largest and most democratic party.
   Merrymakers traded clothes for sequin and feather-clad costumes
for four days of drinking, dancing and wild sexual abandon. They
girated to samba strains in night clubs, ballrooms and on the
streets of Rio, the hub of Carnival.
   Banks, stores and government offices were closed, not to reopen
until after noon on Ash Wednesday, Feb. 28, when Carnival
officially ends.
   Nothing, not even Friday's news that inflation reached 73
percent in the first 23 days of February, dampened spirits.
   In the northeastern coastal cities of Salvador, Recife and
Olinda, sunbathers packed beaches and revelers danced along
boulevards behind throbbing music trucks heading parade processions.
   In Rio, temperatures soared into the high 90s, helping bring
festival fever to a boil.
   After fat, jolly King Momo _ Carnival's symbolic sovereign _
received the keys to the city from Mayor Marcelo Alencar in the
official opening ceremony at noon Saturday, thousands danced and
sang in the downtown financial district.
   Poorer Brazilians banged out samba rythymns on pots and pans and
frolicked in the streets, while the well-heeled donned glittering,
beaded costumes and danced until dawn in chandeliered ballrooms.
   At the Sugar Loaf Ball, the first of the ornate, celebrity
studded gala affairs, the throng danced wildly beneath a display of
Amazon Indian statues titled, ``Tupi, or not Tupi.''
   And at Rio's luxurious Monte Libano nightclub, party goers
munched and drank down 1 ton of filet mignon, 650 pounds of shrimp,
210 cases of scotch, and more than 2,000 gallons of draft beer, at
$1,250 a ticket.
   Also on tap was the Grand Gala G, a mecca for homosexuals from
around the world.
   Health authorities, concerned about AIDS, handed out 10,000
condoms and 1.5 million AIDS pamphlets at Rio's dance clubs.
Brazil, with 9,555 registered AIDS sufferers through December, has
fewer cases only than the United States.
   About 20,000 police were on duty in Rio's southern beachfront
districts to stem a recent violent crime wave. On Saturday, police
said the festival was peaceful and reported no major incidents.
   As always, Rio geared up for the highlight of Carnival _ the
``samba school'' parade, held in two 15-hour sessions on Sunday and
Monday.
   Sixteen ``schools,'' or neighborhood clubs formed in slum areas,
will parade as many as 5,000 dancers clad in flashy, feathered
costumes and string bikinis down the six-block, outdoor paradeway
known as the ``Sambadrome.''
   Schools spend a whole year and millions of dollars preparing
their parades, composing samba lyrics, choreographing dance steps,
and making costumes and floats based on the musical theme. They
then compete for a championship prize.
   Riotur, the city's tourism agency, charges a hefty $170 for the
best parade seat for tourists but gives $150 of the fee to each
samba school for costumes and floats.
   Riotur officials expect over 150,000 people will watch the samba
school parade.

<HEAD>World War II Airborne Gen. James Gavin Dies at 82</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NY25</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lt. Gen. James A. Gavin, who led American
paratroops in daring airborne attacks behind German lines in World
War II but became a critic of the nation's role in Vietnam, has
died. He was 82.
   Gavin, a highly decorated officer who served twice as ambassador
to France under President John F. Kennedy, died Friday in a
Baltimore nursing home where he had been confined since January.
   Private services were set for Wednesday at the U.S. Military
Academy at West Point in Highland Falls, N.Y., for the ``jumping
general'' who also was known for his habit of showing up on
front-line patrols with carbine in hand.
   Gavin jumped with 82nd Airborne Division troops in Sicily and
Normandy. As the unit's commander he again jumped at Nijmegen in
the ill-fated allied drive to expel the Germans from the
Netherlands in September 1944.
   He wore the two stars of a major general at age 37, one of the
youngest men ever to hold that rank. He retired in 1958 and became
a critic of U.S. defense policy.
   He also served as chairman of Arthur D. Little Co., a Cambridge,
Mass., management consulting firm.
   Gavin's military distinction, combined with his dovish views in
the late 1960s, brought talk of a dark-horse presidential
candidacy. But he declined to run.
   A native of New York City, Gavin enlisted in the Army in 1924
and won appointment to West Point the following year. He was
commissioned a second lieutenant in 1929.
   He held the Purple Heart, the Silver Star and the Distinguished
Service Cross. He also was awarded the Distinguished Service Order
by Britain, the Croix de Guerre and the Legion of Honor by France.
   At the time he retired, Gavin was head of research and
development for the Army. He was credited with an instrumental role
in developing helicopter-borne forces and tactics for the Army's
airborne units.
   But Gavin also was a maverick within the military establishment.
   ``I won't compromise my principles and I won't go along with the
Pentagon system,'' Gavin said on his retirement.
   His view that U.S. strategy was too dependant on nuclear weapons
was received sympathetically within the Kennedy administration, and
President Kennedy named him ambassador to France in 1961-1962 and
again in 1962-1963.
   Within five years, however, he was one of the most prominent
Vietnam critics, telling a lecture audience at Brandeis University
in 1967 ``We are in a tragedy.''
   He urged seeking negotiations ``by every means available.''
   Gavin was the author of several books, including ``Airborne
Warfare,'' ``War and Peace in the Space Age'' and his memoirs, ``On
to Berlin,'' published in 1978.
   He was married twice and had five daughters.

<HEAD>U.S. Treasury Secretary Confers on German Monetary Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and his
Italian counterpart on Saturday expressed concern that a common
currency for East and West Germany could increase world interest
rates and slow economic growth, Italian officials said.
   Brady met Guido Carli for two hours at the Italian Treasury on
the second day of his five-day European tour. The talks focused on
international economic cooperation and the creation of a European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
   After the meeting, Carli told reporters the consequences for the
world economy of German monetary union received the most attention.
West Germany has proposed making the West German mark the currency
for East Germany as well to help that country's economic survival.
   ``We both expressed the conviction that (the level of interest
rates) must be in line with the general interest'' and that an
increase in interest rates shouldn't ``spill over from Germany to
the rest of the world'' because ``that could provoke a slowdown in
economic development,'' Carli said.
   Carli also said the two sides ``recognized the need that the
German unification proceed in parallel with an accelerated
unification of Europe.''
   Brady limited himself to saying the meeting was ``useful and
constructive.''
   Mario Sarcinelli, director-general at the Italian Treasury, said
the greatest worries concern a possible increase in interest rates
because of re-emerging ``inflation fears which are shared by many
central bankers.''
   Sarcinelli said the U.S. economy is currently ``tending to
flatten out.'' The key problem, he said, will be to avoid a
recession, ``which would be of great consequence for the rest of
the world, in particular, for the indebted, developing countries.''
   Brady and Carli also addressed the state of the U.S. economy,
U.S.-Japanese relations and the ``need to strengthen international
collaboration,'' Carli said.
   Sarcinelli confirmed the finance ministers of the seven most
industrialized nations plan to meet this spring. He did not say
when the meeting would be.
   Brady is scheduled to meet with Premier Giulio Andreotti Sunday
morning before visiting Paris and London. He met with West German
officials on Friday.

<HEAD>Iran-Contra Prosecutors Used Reagan's Previous Testimony Against
Him</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran-Contra prosecutors used written answers
former President Reagan gave more than two years ago to neutralize
part of his videotaped testimony last week that could have helped
John Poindexter.
   In his deposition for Poindexter's trial, Reagan initially
seemed to suggest that it might have been all right for aides to
destroy documents in November 1986 in order to protect the lives of
U.S. hostages or Iranian contacts.
   The former president had to back away from that suggestion,
however, when confronted with his earlier statements in the
Iran-Contra affair.
   A portion of the indictment against Poindexter, the former
Reagan national security adviser who faces trial March 5 on five
felony charges, accuses him of conspiring with White House aide
Oliver North to destroy classified documents on the Iran initiative
in November 1986.
   ``Did you ... authorize ... any member of the National Security
Council ... to destroy or alter any records ... relating to the
Iran or Contra affair?'' Reagan was asked by Iran-Contra prosecutor
Dan Webb.
   Webb clearly expected the former president to say ``no,'' but
Reagan didn't answer directly. Instead he emphasized ``the
possibility that there were such papers that would violate the
secrecy that was protecting ... individuals' lives.''
   Renewing complaints about news leaks on Capitol Hill, Reagan
said Congress ``was not in many instances capable of the kind of
security that we required.''
   In response, Webb pulled out a written answer given in the fall
of 1987 in which Reagan said that ``At no time did I authorize or
approve the destruction or alteration of documents.''
   ``Was that a truthful statement?'' Webb asked.
   ``Yes,'' acknowledged Reagan, abruptly ending that portion of
his testimony.
   Reagan's written responses plus exhibits _ combined in a
telephone-book-size document _ were given to a federal grand jury
in answer to questions posed by Iran-Contra prosecutors.
   Only a few of those answers were read into the record at
Reagan's deposition in Los Angeles, and the rest remain secret.
Reagan was videotaped Feb. 16-17 for Poindexter's trial, and a
transcript of his answers was released Thursday.
   The former president repeatedly gave general answers that
appeared to help Poindexter, causing problems for Webb. The
prosecutor told U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene in a bench
conference midway through the deposition:
   ``The president has indicated basically there is an atmosphere
that he approved and authorized much of what John Poindexter did.
And I want to try to bring out as best I can through very specific
limited questions that John Poindexter and Oliver North were
engaged in a lot of underlying Contra-related and Iran-related
activities that he did not know about, did not approve of, did not
authorize.''
   Webb was only partially successful.
   Of North's activities on behalf of the Contras, Reagan said:
   ``I know that he was very active, and that was certainly with my
approval. ... I was convinced that they were all being done within
the law.''
   Asked whether he had given Poindexter authority to send false
answers to Congress, Reagan told Webb, ``No. And I don't think any
false statements were made.''
   Reagan also testified that the Iran initiative wasn't a deal to
trade arms for hostages, an assertion that contradicts statements
he made in an address to the nation three years ago.
   ``A few months ago I told the American people I did not trade
arms for hostages,'' Reagan said in March 1987. ``My heart and my
best intentions still tell me that's true, but the facts and the
evidence tell me it is not.''
   The Tower Board, which Reagan appointed, concluded that the Iran
initiative deteriorated into trading arms for hostages.
   In his Los Angeles deposition, however, Reagan reverted to the
statements he made in November 1986 denying the arms-hostages link.
   ``The little weekly newspaper in Beirut printed an erroneous
story that we were doing business directly with ... Khomeini and
trading arms for hostages,'' the former president said in his
videotaped testimony. The publication, the magazine Ash-Shiraa, was
the first to reveal the initiative.
   Reagan also testified that the administration wasn't sending
munitions to the government of Iran. But Webb drew Reagan's
attention to a presidential finding he signed in 1985 which
specifically stated that was the case.
   Poindexter tore up the politically embarrassing finding in
November 1986 as lawyers from the Justice Department prepared to
launch an inquiry to piece together what really happened in the
Iran arms sales.
   Reagan, who is 79, mischaracterized the Iran initiative,
compressing into several months events that took nearly a year and
a half to play out. Reagan mentioned one arms shipment to Iran.
Earlier investigations have established that there were six.
   He also contradicted the conclusions of the Tower Board, which
found that Israeli officials working with an Iranian, Manucher
Ghorbanifar, originated the idea for arms sales to Iran.
   Reagan testified that a group of Iranian citizens traveled to
Israel and that a delegation from the National Security Council met
with these citizens.

   Jimmy Stewart reminisced about
Hollywood's past and retired Adm. William Crowe addressed the
military's future as fellow alumni honored the two famed Princeton
University men Saturday.
   The Alumni Association gave Stewart its Woodrow Wilson Award for
undergraduate alumni distinguished in public service. The James
Madison Medal, the graduate student equivalent, was bestowed on
Crowe, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   Stewart, 81, an Indiana, Pa., native, came to the Ivy League
campus more than 60 years ago with an accordian and hopes for an
engineering degree. He charmed an audience of 850 with
self-deprecating humor and strong opinions about the movie industry
today.
   He remembered his poor mathematics ability that dashed his
freshman hopes of being an engineer, saying he switched to
architecture on the ``advice of several people, including my math
teacher, to stay away from mathematics.''
   Summer stock theater after his senior year led to Broadway,
which led to an MGM contract. He has appeared in 80 movies.
   The two-time Oscar winner made it clear he prefers the Hollywood
of his early days in the business over today's Hollywood.
   ``I feel very strongly, looking back, that the big studio system
is the only real way to make pictures,'' said Stewart.
   ``You didn't sit at home waiting for a script you liked. You
were there every day. ... Frankly, I think if things were like that
today we'd be getting much better movies.''
   The studio moguls of the day, Stewart said, ``loved motion
pictures. They didn't need censors. They knew what was right for
the public. They hated sequels. You know, they make one today and
you get six more.''
   He told an anecdote about a man who approached him on a movie
set and told him:
   ```Yeah, yeah, I saw you in a picture. ... You were in this
room. There was a girl there. ... I don't know who the girl was.
You sort of went toward the door, and as the guy went to the girl,
I forget what he said, but he said something to you. You turned and
looked at him, and I'll never forget that look.'''
   Stewart told his audience: ``I knew exactly the picture. I knew
exactly who was in it. I knew exactly that turn and I knew his
reaction to the turn was the reaction I hoped I would get.''
   Crowe, who recently retired from the military to teach
geopolitics at the University of Oklahoma, received a doctorate
from Princeton in 1965.
   He cautioned against the United States too quickly reducing its
military in response to the democracy movement and new governments
in Eastern Europe and decreased U.S.-Soviet hostilities.
   He predicted turmoil until ``the power is sorted out.''
   ``We do not know as yet what the final replacement regimes will
look like,'' he said. ``I suggest it will be a tough and trying
time, if not a dangerous one.''

<TEXT>
   Fog combined with heavy traffic
led to three separate highway pileups Saturday that involved more
than 200 cars and killed seven people, police said. Nearly 100
people were reported injured.
   The worst crash involved 134 cars on the main highway between
Frankfurt and Munich. Six people died and 72 were injured, 43 of
them seriously, police said.
   ``There are wrecked cars all over the place. The injured are
bleeding and screaming. It looks like a slaughterhouse,'' said a
police officer.
   Another person died when 74 cars crashed into each other on the
Frankfurt-Berlin highway, police said. Seven people were critically
injured, and 15 others suffered less serious injuries in that
accident.
   The third pileup, with 16 cars and five injuries, occurred on
another highway near Frankfurt, police reported. One of the five
suffered serious injuries.
   Police said all three pileups were caused by fast driving in
foggy conditions. There are usually no speed limits on West German
autobahns. Traffic was particularly heavy Saturday morning because
of a short holiday marking the carnival season.
   ``The visibility was poor, but as usual drivers did not adjust
their speed to the conditions and drove too fast,'' said one
officer at the scene of the worst crash, on a stretch of the A3
autobahn between Aschaffenburg and Wuerzburg.
   Police had to close the heavily traveled autobahn in both
directions, causing traffic jams of nearly 30 miles. Rescue
vehicles had trouble reaching the area because of the crowded
highway, police said.
   The pileup on the Frankfurt-Berlin highway also forced police to
block traffic for a period of six hours. Traffic backed up nearly
10 miles near the border with East Germany.

<HEAD>Defense Minister Says New Internal Security Will Resemble FBI</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   BUCHAREST, Romania _ The internal security operations run for
decades with ruthless efficiency by Nicolae Ceausescu's Securitate
will be revamped into an organization resembling the FBI, the
defense minister said Saturday.
   In addition, the government plans to maintain the tunnels that
Securitate troops used during the December revolution to move
freely while battles raged above ground against the army, Defense
Minister Victor A. Stanculescu said.
   The underground labyrinth has become a symbol of the repressive,
paranoid control maintained by Ceausescu during his 24-year tenure
that ended with his toppling Dec. 22 and execution three days later.
   The narrow passages reportedly connect major government
buildings in Bucharest and lead to communications bunkers or to
underground storage depots of food, weapons and ammunition.
   Stanculescu said the tunnels will be maintained in case they are
needed in wartime.
   Stanculescu said Securitate officers who did not commit
atrocities would be given jobs in the Defense Ministry's new
Internal Security Agency, which he described as similar in
character to the FBI.
   He said the Securitate, which had been part of the Interior
Ministry, was ``neutralized,'' but investigations of its former
members were continuing, and ``the process will not be over in a
week or two.''
   He did not elaborate on the process of transforming Securitate _
whose repressive secret police methods had been unmatched in Europe
since the Stalinist 1950s _ into a force resembling the FBI, a
branch of the U.S. Justice Department charged with investigating
such federal crimes as espionage, bank robbery, kidnapping and
fraud.
   Through the Securitate, the Communist government controlled
nearly every aspect of Romanian life; it widely recruited
informers, discouraged contact with foreigners and even demanded
that typewriters be registered.
   The scarcity of information about the restructuring of
Securitate has led to widespread fears that the dreaded force is
still in action, despite repeated government denials.
   Last week, the Romanian Defense Ministry said more than 3,500
Securitate agents had been retired. The force had about 15,000
officers and thousands of civilian informers, according to
officials of the interim government.
   The ministry has said some agents were arrested, but it has not
given a number, and only a handful have been convicted.
   Stanculescu, a lieutenant general, also told reporters he had
agreed to work with officers who demanded a purge in the army of
elements associated with Ceausescu.
   ``We established together a plan and a schedule and a system of
resolving these problems through teams,'' he said, declining to
elaborate.
   Dozens of officers who played a leading role in the December
revolution that ousted Ceasuescu and ended more than four decades
of Communist rule held a week of demonstrations earlier this month
that prompted the removal of the previous defense minister.
   The protests posed the first major challenge to the interim
government ruling Romania until free elections in May. Stanculescu
on Friday met with representatives of the military units.
   In another development, state radio reported that 35 people were
convicted of breaking into government headquarters during a
demonstration last week. Of them, 23 received prison sentences of
three to six months, and six were fined between $140 to $350.
   Six others were under age 18 and will be sent to reform school,
the broadcast said.

<HEAD>Investigators Find No Evidence of Child Abuse Despite Nude Photos</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police say they found no evidence
to support a child-abuse case against a day-care center owner who
kept nude pictures of some of the childen placed in his care.
   In the four weeks since John Shaver's arrest on child
pornography charges, counselors and investigators interviewed
former employees and 20 children from his Rainbow Learning Center,
police said Friday.
   ``What we have is not even close to substantiating a criminal
charge,'' said police Capt. Bruce Smith. ``All we have are comments
from some children that might be interpreted as inappropriate
touching by Mr. Shaver.''
   He did not elaborate on what children told the counselors.
   On Thursday, prosecutors backed away from a report that three of
the children had gonorrhea of the throat. The state attorney's
office said the three originally tested positive for gonorrhea but
had come up negative on a second test. Tests of Shaver found no
trace of the disease.
   Shaver was charged with 29 counts of possessing published
pornographic material depicting children. Police acting on a tip
from a photo lab also found nude snapshots of childen in his home,
but he does not face any charges in relation to those photos. The
children in the pictures, including 20 identified by parents as
children who attended the day care center, were not depicted in
sexual situations.
   ``The police investigation vindicates my client,'' said Shaver's
attorney J. David Bogenshutz.
   Shaver, who opened Rainbow Learning Center in 1985, had his
day-care license revoked. He previously had been forced to close a
day-care center in Hawaii following accusations that he improperly
touched children there, but he was never charged in that case.

   Love R. Divine hated her name when she was
in elementary school. But by high school, she had learned that
``Love'' is indeed divine.
   Ms. Divine, 26, a manager at a grocery store, is named for her
great-grandmother, a Cherokee Indian whose tribal name was Love.
The ``R'' stands for Renee.
   ``When I was in grade school, I hated it because the other kids
made fun of it,'' she said. ``I cried every day. I was mad at my
mom.''
   By the time she was in eighth grade, she felt better about it.
``My friends would say, `Oooh, your name is `Love.' And in high
school it gave me a lot of attention,'' she said. But she still
gets plenty of funny looks and comments.
   Once, she got stopped by a state trooper, who looked at her
identification and asked: ``Is this your real ID? Are you sure?''
He went back to his car and talked on the two-way radio, probably
trying to find out if she was genuine, she recalled.
   ``I still got a ticket, though,'' she added.
   Checking into a hotel or writing a check can produce some
interesting reactions, she said.
   ``They always ask for more identification,'' she said.
   ``Once I got asked if I was a porn star. I have to do a lot of
explaining.''

   You can lead a gorilla to grass, but can you make
him sit? That is the question Dallas Zoo officials are trying to
resolve.
   The zoo's four gorillas are scheduled to be moved to a new
outdoor enclosure in April. Zoo director Warren Iliff says that may
not set well with a few of the large beasts who are now living
behind bars in an indoor facility.
   ``Gorillas are conservative,'' Iliff said. ``They will need time
to adapt to the change.''
   Iliff said a large male named Om Bom is particularly leery of
change.
   ``He may not even be willing to walk on the grass,'' Iliff said.
   Zoo staff members are trying to help the gorillas get used to
sitting on grass by bringing grass, hay and the like into their
cages, so they will be willing to make the move when the new Wilds
of Africa primate habitat is completed.
   Earlier, zoo officials attempted to ensure the new gorilla
habitat will be escape-proof by bringing in mountain climbers to
detect unforeseen escape routes.

   Here are some facts and figures on Nicaragua:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Nicaragua is the biggest, but least populated,
country in Central American. It has 57,000 square miles, about the
size of Iowa.
   The most fertile parts of the country are the hills and lowlands
near the Pacific Coast. Farming and ranching run through the
central mountains.
   On the east, or Caribbean side, are the hot, wet jungles and
mangroves of the Miskito Coast. No road connects the two coasts.
   Nicaragua has more than 50 volcanos and two large lakes, one of
which contains the world's only fresh-water sharks.
   Honduras borders Nicaragua to the north and Costa Rica to the
south.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ The population is 3.5 million. About 90 percent of
Nicaraguans live in the western half of the country close to the
Pacific Coast. Managua, the capital, has a population of 850,000.
   About half the population is 15 years or younger.
   Spanish is the official language. But English and native Indian
languages, mostly Miskito, are spoken by ethnic minorities along
the sparsely populated Atlantic Coast.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Nicaragua is mainly an agricultural country,
deriving most of its income from exports of coffee, cotton, sesame
and beef. But exports have declined sharply since 1979, when the
Sandinistas seized power. They were $200 million last year, down
from $700 million in 1978.
   Inflation for 1989 was 1,700 percent, according to the
government, a figure that many experts think is low. In 1988 the
cost of living rose 33,600 percent.
   Nicaragua's economy is among the poorest in the world; in some
respects, even poorer than that of Haiti, long considered the
poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Spanish ``conquistadores'' colonized Nicaragua in the
1600s. Independence was achieved in 1821.
   Relations with the United States have long been sour.
   In the 1850s, American adventurer William Walker invaded the
country several times, once declaring himself president for two
years.
   Several U.S. interventions and military invasions marked the
start of the 1900s, and Augusto Cesar Sandino made himself a
revolutionary hero fighting U.S. Marines stationed in Nicaragua.
   In 1934 Sandino was killed and the United States installed the
Somoza dynasty of rightists, who ruled for 42 years. The last of
them, Anastasio Somoza, was overthrown July 19, 1979, by a popular
uprising led by the Sandinista National Liberation Front, which has
governed Nicaragua ever since.

   Nicaragua under the Sandinista government has taken a pivotal
role in Central America, by turns scaring and angering its
neighbors. Here is a brief glance at its regional relations:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HONDURAS _ Nicaragua has accused Honduras of selling its
national sovereignty to the United States in exchange for financial
aid. U.S. military troops conduct joint exercises with Honduran
troops to keep Nicaragua's armed forces _ the largest in the
region, with an estimated 150,000 troops _ in check. Nicaragua sued
Honduras in the World Court for allowing the U.S.-backed Contra
rebels to have bases there, from which they infiltrate Nicaragua.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   EL SALVADOR _ Managua denies arming the Salvadoran guerrillas,
but it is known that the rebels have a safe haven in Nicaragua.
Last November, a small plane loaded with missiles crashed in El
Salvador, which pulled its diplomats from Managua in protest.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   COSTA RICA _ Nicaragua's once-strained relations with Costa Rica
have improved since President Oscar Arias cut down the Contra
presence on Nicaragua's southern flank and began efforts to promote
regional peace. However, the pro-Sandinista press in Managua
regularly accuses the Costa Rican ambassador of inciting unrest and
illegally aiding the opposition.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   GUATEMALA _ Nicaragua's Sandinistas do not like Guatemala's
government. The Sandinistas say it is basically run by a rightist
military that tolerates death squad activity.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PANAMA _ The Sandinistas were hurt by the fall of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega. He allowed the Sandinistas to circumvent a U.S.
trade and economic embargo, re-invoicing and in many cases
re-labeling imports and exports in Panama's huge free-trade zones
at both ends of the canal. Panama's new government led by President
Guillermo Endara has not continued the practice.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CUBA _ Although it is not part of the region, Fidel Castro's
Cuba has until recently been a strong influencing factor in Central
America. But economic problems and diminished Soviet aid have cut
Castro's ability to affect events. Castro's waning influence may be
the principal factor pushing the Sandinistas toward economic and
political moderation.

   Here are some facts and figures on Nicaragua's Election Sunday:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE VOTERS _ There are 1,750,550 people registered to vote
Sunday. Turnout is expected to be high.
   The voting age is 16, lowered from 18 by the Sandinistas who
expect to harvest votes from youthful supporters. About one-third
of registered voters are between 16 and 25, and about 51.5 percent
are women. More than 26 percent of all registered voters live in
Managua.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   VOTING _ The 4,394 polling places nationwide open at 7 a.m. (8
a.m. EST) and close at 6 p.m. (7 p.m. EST) when anybody still
standing in line gets to vote.
   Voters must present their electoral registration card or a
document that is provided to replace lost, damaged or stolen cards.
The cards do not have a picture of the bearer.
   Each voter is handed three ballots _ one to choose a president
and vice president; another to choose each party's slate of
National Assembly deputy candidates; and a third to choose
municipal councils. In autonomous Atlantic Coast regions, voters
choose regional councils instead of municipal councils.
   Voters enter a stall where they have two minutes to mark the
three ballots, putting an X under the party of their choice.
   They leave the stall and deposit each ballot in its
corresponding sealed box. To prevent voting more than once, voters
must dip their thumbs in a special ink that takes days to wash off.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE COUNT _ After polls close, the ballots are counted by a
three-member commission at each polling station. The count will
take place under the observation of party-appointed observers as
well as accredited international observers, if they are present.
   The results are telegraphed to each of nine regional centers,
which transmit the results as they come in to the Supreme Electoral
Council in Managua.
   The ballots are then taken to each regional center, where they
are counted again. In isolated rural areas this may take days, with
ballots being transported on horseback or by boat on jungle rivers.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE RESULTS _ The Supreme Electoral Council is expected to begin
announcing results at about 9 p.m. (10 p.m.EST) and will continue
through the night with periodic announcements. Significant results
may not be available until Monday afternoon.

<TEXT>
   Sparks fly while Reggie Kester hammers a
length of red-hot iron just out of the forge, and gradually the
metal takes the shape of a horseshoe.
   Kester works in much the same way as craftsmen have for hundreds
of years, using forge, anvil and hammer. His rough hands speak of
the 30-odd years he has spent in the trade.
   But this isn't the village smithy. Kester and his wife,
Marcella, run the Oklahoma State Horseshoeing School, where they
teach the craft of the farrier, not blacksmithing.
   People hoping to enter what can be a lucrative trade come to the
school from around the world.
   ``I know guys that are making $150,000 shoeing horses,'' Kester
says. But he admits most make between $20,000 and $40,000 a year.
   They've have had students from Germany, Sweden, Australia,
Canada, Ireland, Israel and Switzerland. The six-week course costs
$2,450 and is offered six times a year.
   Kester credits trade advertising and word-of-mouth for the
school's wide appeal. All kinds sign up for the Kesters' courses.
   ``Most of the people we have are people who have experience with
horses,'' Kester says. But he adds: ``We have people come through
here who know nothing about horses except what they look like.''
   Kester says that after his course, they'll all be able to shoe a
horse and make a horseshoe from scratch.
   ``Sometimes you just can't buy what you need,'' Kester says.
``So you make it.''
   He says he learned the trade of a farrier as he teaches it: in
school.
   ``I'm a journeyman, certified horseshoer,'' he said. ``I've had
a lot of experience, and I've been in the teaching business for 15,
16 years.
   ``I went to school for it in '66. I thought I knew something
until I went to school and met people who did.''
   Kester says there's a lot to being a farrier, and it takes
instruction and practice. He says an unskilled person who shoes a
horse runs the risk of crippling the animal.
   His students don't spend all their time at the anvil. He's got a
textbook, a thick volume called ``The Principles of Horseshoeing
II,'' which contains information about anatomy, metallurgy and
history.
   Kester says there are many types of horseshoes for different
kinds of animals. There are lightweight, aluminum shoes for race
horses; large, heavy shoes for work animals; and even plastic shoes
for injured horses.
   Most horseshoes today are still metal and are nailed to a
horse's hoof. But synthetic and plastic shoes that are glued to the
hoof are beginning to take over.
   ``I think in 10 or 20 years the standard horseshoe we've known
for hundreds of years'll be obsolete,'' Kester says.
   As long as there are horses, there will be a need for people to
shoe them, but Kester says the farrier's business requires
individuals to go out and find clients.
   ``You don't go get a job'' just out of school, he says. ``You go
get a clientele. It's an entrepreneurial deal.''
   Clients vary. Racetracks are specialized and many require union
certification, he says, and working on show horses requires a high
level of skill. Horses with injured hoofs need a special kind of
care.
   In some ways, Kester says, he's an equine podiatrist. But he's
not a blacksmith.
   ``I call myself a horseshoer ... and that's what I am.''

<HEAD>Man Returns to Prison To Get AIDS Drug</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPSHAW, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man infected with the AIDS virus stole a
videocassette recorder so he could return to prison and receive
free daily doses of an expensive medicine that may prolong his life.
   ``I want to live; that's why I'm back,'' said the man housed in
an AIDS isolation cellblock at Limestone Correctional Facility.
   The American Civil Liberties Union, which represents the man,
has not disclosed his name. Other prisoners call the 35-year-old
man ``Batman.''
   He is one of 140 prisoners at Limestone who have tested positive
for exposure to the human immunodeficiency virus and can get the
drug AZT at state expense.
   Caring for inmates with AIDS or HIV infections is estimated to
cost $20,000 a month, said Jay Stuman, executive vice president of
Correctional Health Care Inc., which provides medical services to
the state prison system.
   Don Williamson, director of the state Health Department's
Disease Control and Rehabilitation Services, estimated $7 million a
year is needed to provide AZT to Alabamians infected with the AIDS
virus but lacking health insurance.
   AZT was the first drug approved by the federal government to
lessen the devastating effects of AIDS on the body's immune system.
The cost of the drug to individuals had varied as prices and dosage
recommendations both have been cut, but it can exceed $5,000 a year.
   Three years ago, while imprisoned for burglary and theft, Batman
was tested with 12,000 other state inmates and found to be infected
with HIV.
   Seven months after his release in April, he pleaded guilty to
stealing the VCR.
   Police officer William McCormick of Anniston said Batman had
enough experience with petty crimes to have stolen the VCR without
getting caught, so ``it was obvious he was trying to get back in
prison.''
   A federal judge last month upheld the state's right to segregate
its inmates with the AIDS virus in a special unit at Limestone. The
ACLU, representing the segregated inmates, is appealing the
decision.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Foreign Ministry's policy-making body
Saturday ruled out NATO membership for a unified Germany, saying
that would tip the balance of European power.
   The statement from the ministry's Collegium was issued as West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl met with President Bush in the United
States to discuss the future of Germany.
   Both men favor NATO membership for a reunited Germany. At
present, West Germany is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, and East Germany belongs to the Soviet-led Warsaw
Pact.
   The Foreign Ministry Collegium, in its statement carried by the
official Tass news agency, rejected the argument that membership of
a united Germany in the Western military alliance would satisfy
Soviet security concerns because it would place Germany ``under
some kind of external control.''
   Membership in NATO for a reunified Germany would lead to an
``impermissible violation of the military-strategic balance,'' the
Collegium said. Soviet officials have previously said a reunified
Germany should not belong to NATO.
   ``The Soviet Union on this account has its own conceptions,''
said the Collegium, which held a meeting on the German question
Saturday. ``And these conceptions, of course, don't include at all
the proposals that foresee the membership of a united Germany in
NATO.''
   In remarks on Germany's future printed Wednesday by the
Communist Party daily Pravda, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
said any disruption of the existing military-strategic balance is
unacceptable.
   East Germany is Moscow's most important military ally and home
to about two-thirds of its 575,000 troops deployed in Eastern
Europe.

   Research microbiologist Stephen Cuskey,
who developed so-called suicide genes that self-destruct after
making toxic wastes decompose, has died of a pancreatic infection.
He was 36.
   Cuskey, who worked at the Environmental Protection Agency
Research Laboratory at Pensacola Beach, died Thursday at Baptist
Hospital. A pioneer in genetic engineering, he joined the federal
agency in July 1985.
   The Pensacola Beach laboratory specializes in the study of
toxins and gene splicing and supervised the use of fertilizer to
speed the growth of oil-eating bacteria to help clean up the
Alaskan oil spill last year.
   Cuskey was a born ``gene jockey'' who loved splicing genes, Hap
Pritchard, the lab's chief of biotechnology, said Friday.
   He added that his colleague's genetic tinkering was done with a
concern for the environment.
   The scientist had fought a lifelong battle with asthma and high
blood pressure before the fatal pancreatic infection, Pritchard
said.
   Cuskey received a bachelor's degree in biology from Bucknell
University in Lewisburg, Pa., and did postgraduate work at Virginia
Commonwealth University and the University of Michigan before
earning his doctorate from Rutgers University in New Jersey.

   A video camera was lowered into Convict Lake but after two hours
nothing but clothing was spotted, the Mono County Sheriff's

from the camp, another counselor and two rescuers.
   Divers recovered the other six bodies earlier in the week.
   Camp O'Neal is a home for youngsters placed by county social

   Thousands of bootleg audio tapes,
high-capacity copying equipment and $89,000 in cash were found at
two homes after a mysterious 911 phone call from one residence,
authorities said Saturday.
   Six men identified as Mexican nationals were arrested.
   The operation had the capacity to make 15,000 to 20,000 tapes a
day, which could cost the record industry millions of dollars, said
Deputy Pat Hunter, a sheriff's spokesman.
   The discovery began with a call to the 911 emergency line that
was automatically traced when the caller hung up without saying
anything.
   Sheriff's deputies sent to investigate the call Friday found
thousands of tapes. They also found evidence that led them to more
tapes in the garage and to $89,000 in $100 bills stashed in a
cookie jar in an attic of a house several miles away, said Deputy
Rafael Estrada.
   Pico Rivera is 10 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles.

   The slain foreign minister was buried
Saturday on his family farm in western Kenya, and his widow
appealed for calm as hundreds of police and protesting students
faced one another during the ceremony.
   ``If you love him as you say you do, I beg you with tears in my
eyes and as his widow to let us give him a peaceful send-off,''
said Cristobel Ouko.
   Robert Ouko's funeral Friday touched off major protests in
Nairobi and Kisumu, where the body was taken for public display
after a memorial service. It was the worst violence in Kenya since
a 1982 coup attempt as students demonstrated to demand an
explanation of Ouko's murder last week.
   Saturday's funeral ended without major incident.
   Mrs. Ouko addressed mourners shortly before President Daniel
arap Moi spoke. None of the long line of speakers at the burial was
interrupted by the students.
   Between 500 and 600 students from four colleges arrived at the
farm aboard eight buses shortly before dawn. For the next six
hours, they paraded up and down Ouko's driveway chanting: ``We want
justice!'' ``No cover-up!'' ``Who killed Bob?'' ``Moi should
resign!''
   Police halted the parading students at noon, when the president,
ministers, diplomats and local politicians began arriving for the
burial service.
   At the gravesite, a few yards down a sloping yard from Ouko's
hilltop home, Moi was surrounded by some 200 police, their rifles
pointing out toward the crowd.
   Some students managed to get close to the grave and continued
muttering their chants. Moi occasionally glanced at them but showed
no reaction.
   In his speech, Moi again promised the government would conduct a
thorough investigation into the death of Ouko, whose charred body
was found in the brush near his home on Feb. 16. He had been shot
once in the head.
   ``I want the truth about the murder,'' Moi said.
   Ouko, 58, was the fourth leading political figure to die
violently since Kenya gained independence in 1963. The government
of former President Jomo Kenyatta was accused of covering up the
three other murders.
   Ouko also was the highest-ranking politician from the Luo tribe,
one of four major ethnic groups that vie for power in Kenya's
single-party government and engage in rivalries that go back
centuries. The others are the Kikuyu, the Luya and the Kalengen.
   University students in Nairobi began demonstrating early in the
week, demanding an impartial investigation of Ouko's death.
   The government has called in three Scotland Yard detectives and
a British pathologist to assist in the investigation.

   The ruling Sandinista Front will
remain the largest political party in Nicaragua even in the
unlikely event President Daniel Ortega loses Sunday's election, but
there still may be room for minor parties to wield some power in
the National Assembly.
   After the Sandinistas, the Social Christians are expected to be
the second-largest single party in the new National Assembly.
   The United National Opposition, which is mounting the strongest
challenge to the Sandinistas behind presidential candidate Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro, is a fractious coalition of 14 parties that
may not survive defeat _ or even victory.
   Voters will choose 90 deputies on Sunday, and losing
presidential candidates get additional seats if their vote total
reaches about 1 percent.
   The formula for calculating the exact vote total needed to
qualify for a seat is complicated but will end up at about 15,000
votes, which all eight minor opposition candidates may get. That
would result in a 99-member legislature.
   The 11 UNO parties running candidates for assembly seats will
act individually once it is no longer in their interest to be
hedged in by coalition decisions.
   None of the 11 is likely to have more than a few seats, and the
Social Christians hope to be second with seven or eight seats. They
may also pick up support from one of the UNO parties, the People's
Social Christian Party.
   The Sandinistas would be a cohesive bloc becasue of strong party
discipline, but if they lack a majority the Social Christians would
become crucial players.
   A two-thirds majority is needed for constitutional changes of
any kind.
   On the municipal level and in the two regional councils for the
Atlantic Coast, the only certain thing is that the Sandinistas will
no longer monopolize power.
   It is almost certain that Yatama, the native Indian
organization, will dominate the Atlantic Coast regions, an area
different from the Pacific Coast in language, ethnic background and
customs.
   The Indians and English-speaking blacks of the Atlanic side are
so fiercely independent that the Sandinista government was forced
to accede to their demands for autonomy.
   Some councils in the 144 cities and towns nationwide will most
certainly be in opposition hands, especially in the central
mountains where the U.S.-backed Contras _ and UNO _ are strong.
   Although they have local government responsibilities, their
power may be limited by the centralized nature of Nicaragua's
government. The councils will have to depend on Managua for money,
because they collect no local taxes.

   Leaders of a four-nation Arab council
Saturday urged Arab unity to cope with changes sweeping the world,
and Iraq's president urged Arabs to shift their wealth from the
United States to Eastern Europe.
   ``Just as Israel uses interest groups to apply pressure on the
American administration, there are hundreds of billions of dollars
invested by Arabs in the United States and the West which could be
used for this purpose,'' Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said.
   ``In fact, this investment could be converted to the Soviet
Union and Eastern Europe, and I believe it is a profitable
investment, probably more profitable than in the West.''
   Saddam's statement came at the opening of the first anniversary
summit of the Arab Cooperation Council, an alliance of Iraq, Egypt,
Jordan and North Yemen.
   Leaders of the nations held private talks on Friday and closed
their summit Saturday night by signing 11 agreements on economic
and administrative cooperation.
   Jordanian Foreign Minister Marwan Kassem said they also called
for ``withdrawal of all non-Lebanese troops from Lebanese soil,'' a
reference to Syrian and Israeli forces in the strife-torn country.
   Iraq is a bitter foe of Iran and Syria. The latter has some
40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League mandate, while
Israel and the militias it funds occupy southern Lebanon as a
self-declared ``security zone.''
   Kassem spoke at a news conference following the summit's closing
session.
   The chief political adviser to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
Osama El-Baz, told The Associated Press that the four nations had
also agreed to contact world leaders in a campaign to halt Jewish
settlement in Arab territories captured by Israel in 1967.
   Kassem, however, said that would happen only after a meeting of
Arab League foreign ministers in mid-March.
   Arabs have expressed alarm that tens of thousands of Soviet
Jewish immigrants to Israel could settle in the occupied
territories.
   El-Baz said such settlement would be ``a threat to the security
of the Arab nation and to the peace process itself.''
   In other resolutions, the leaders supported the Palestinian
uprising in the occupied territories, backed Iraq in its disputes
with Iran, called for peace in Lebanon and praised the release from
prison of South African black leader Nelson Mandela.
   In their speeches, the leaders urged Arabs to overcome
differences to cope with the democratic changes that are redrawing
the map of Europe.
   ``The world will not deal with us positively unless this unity
is achieved,'' Jordan's King Hussein said in his closing statement.
   The king said earlier Saturday that ``a new world order is
emerging'' based on economic and political blocs rather than on
hegemony and the arms race.
   He said Arabs can either ``be part of the historic developments
and employ them to enhance their existence, stability and growth,
or ... be on the periphery ... and so become an easy prey that is
mercilessly leeched and discarded.''
   While Saddam called for Arabs to use their financial muscle to
influence the United States, none of the ACC countries has much of
it. Egypt and Jordan are both coping with economic crises.
   Iraq has the world's second-largest known reserves of oil, but
it is financially drained by its long war with Iran. Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait and other Gulf states hold the bulk of Arab investment
wealth.
   Saddam said Arabs must deal with the United States, ``but
America has to respect Arabs and their rights and not interfere in
their internal problems.''

   Forty-one anti-abortion protesters were
arrested Saturday after blocking a clinic entrance, police said.
   Clinic workers broke a window to circumvent the demonstrators
and get into the building, police said.
   All were charged with defiant trespassing and were being
released on their own recognizance, said Deputy Chief James Galfy.
One person was charged with assault on a police officer for trying
to bite him, Galfy said.
   About 60 protesters from the anti-abortion group Operation
Rescue sat in front of the doors of the North Jersey Gynecological
Center while about 20 more picketed. Abortions are performed at the
clinic.
   Police carried protesters to two school buses when they refused
to leave the clinic, Galfy said. Five protesters locked themselves
to each other and to the entrance doors, he said.
   Clinic administrator Anne Crayfield said she had a window broken
so she and other employees could climb into the building. Once they
got in, the protesters handed over the keys to the locks they used
to chain themselves, she said.
   ``We just hated to have them have their way, so we hung in
there,'' Ms. Crayfield said. ``Some of the patients came from a
distance and some people couldn't wait another week.''
   Ginny Christel of Operation Rescue said that the protesters
remained silent throughout the ordeal to ``identify with preborn
babies who have no choice.''

<HEAD>Report: Bonn Renounces Claims to Poland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The West German government has assured the
Bush administration that a reunified Germany will renounce any
claim to Polish land, a newspaper said Saturday.
   The report came as West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl met with
President Bush at Camp David, Md., for weekend talks, mainly
involving unification.
   Poland wants a clear renunciation from the Bonn government that
a reunified Germany would not seek to take control of German
territory that was given to Poland at the end of World War II.
   The West German newspaper Bild am Sonntag said Saturday that
Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has told U.S. Secretary of
State James A. Baker III a reunified Germany would respect the
current border with Poland. The assurances were reportedly given
during a visit to Washington earlier in the week.
   Bild am Sonntag said such a declaration could be issued as soon
as the East German government votes to join with West Germany, and
Schaeuble predicted that step would come shortly after East
Germany's free elections, set for March 18.
   ``There will be an absolute and unmistakable clarification
regarding the Polish border,'' Bild am Sonntag quoted Schaeuble as
telling the Americans.
   Bild am Sonntag said its information came from a confidential
telex that Schaeuble had sent back to the Foreign Ministry in Bonn.
   The newspaper, which has good contacts within the government in
Bonn, said its report would appear in Sunday's editions. A copy was
distributed in advance to other news media.
   It was not clear whether the latest reported West German
assurance would satisfy Poland and other jittery nations of the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. Kohl has refused to categorically renounce
any claim to the Polish territory.
   However, on the eve of Kohl's U.S. trip, Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany gave an interview urging a
clear West German recognition of Poland's western border.
   German conservatives, whose votes Kohl hopes to gain in December
elections, have pushed claims for about a third of modern-day
Poland that was sliced off Germany by the victorious Allies after
World War II.
   In another news report, the West German news magazine Der
Spiegel reported that former Communist Party leader Erich Honecker
placed money paid by West Germany for the release of political
prisoners into a private bank account.
   According to Der Spiegel, the amount was $48 million last year
alone.
   The prisoners were mostly people convicted of trying to escape
from the country under the former hard-line regime.
   Prosecutors have already said they intend to indict the
77-year-old Honecker next month for treason and corruption. He was
ousted following pro-democracy demonstrations in October.

<HEAD>Arctic Cold Invading the Central and Eastern U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A sharp cold front ushered arctic air into the north-central and
northeastern sections of the nation Saturday and snow fell over
much of the area from the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes region to
New England.
   One storm off the Atlantic Coast produced snow in New England,
strong northerly wind produced squalls with heavy snow over the
upper Great Lakes, and a low-pressure system centered over
southeastern Lower Michigan produced snow from the Ohio Valley into
the middle Atlantic Coast region.
   The storm off the Atlantic Coast dumped 6 inches of snow in
Vermont at Brattleboro and Shaftsbury. Portland, Maine, got 5
inches of snow in six hours early Saturday.
   Winter storm watches were in effect through Sunday for Vermont,
eastern New York state, New Hampshire, southern Maine and all of
southern New England.
   The squalls over the Great Lakes produced heavy snow across
parts of Upper Michigan, with up to 12 inches at Ironwood and
Wakefield, and 10 inches at Marquette, the National Weather Service
said.
   Wind and snow produced blizzard conditions along the Lake
Superior shoreline of Upper Michigan.
   The low pressure system centered over southeastern Michigan
produced heavy snow across parts of the Ohio Valley, the lower
Great Lakes and the central Appalachians, with a foot in northern
Indiana.
   Strong northwesterly wind ushered arctic air into the central
and eastern part of the nation. Wind gusted to 54 mph at Peru,
Ind., during the morning, the weat her service said, with gusts to
50 mph around St. Louis, Mo.
   Temperatures remained below freezing during the afternoon from
the northern Plains to the Great Lakes and the Ohio Valley, and
across the northern Atlantic Coast region.
   Skies were partly cloudy over the Rockies and Pacific Northwest
on Saturday, while most of the rest of the nation had clear skies.
   Saturday's low for the Lower 48 states was 12 below zero at
Warroad, Minn.

<TEXT>
   The Seabrook nuclear power plant is on the
verge of obtaining an operating license after years of
demonstrations, regulatory delays and financial problems that
forced its lead owner into bankruptcy.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said last week that it would
rule Thursday on a license for the $6.4 billion plant, which became
a symbol for opponents of nuclear power in the 1970s.
   Protests began before ground-breaking in August 1976, when 18
people were arrested at the site. Subsequent protests have resulted
in about 3,200 arrests, including 1,400 in a May 1977
demonstration. The last major demonstration was in October, when
475 people were arrested.
   If the NRC gives its approval, as expected, spokesman John
Kopeck said there would be about a week of paperwork before the
commission issued the actual license. If promised court appeals
don't succeed, Seabrook would go through a three-month buildup to
full-power operation.
   The main sticking point to licensing has been federally required
evacuation plans for communities, including six over the border in
northeastern Massachusetts, within 10 miles of the plant.
   Critics argue that the area surrounding the plant, two miles
from popular Hampton Beach and 40 miles north of Boston, is too
densely populated to be evacuated safely in an emergency.
   The 10-mile area has a population of 148,000, which swells to a
summertime peak of 247,000, according to estimates by Seabrook
officials.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis refused to submit evacuation
plans to the NRC, so New Hampshire Yankee, the operating company
set up by the dozen utilities that own Seabrook, submitted its own
plans for Massachusetts.
   New Hampshire submitted its evacuation plans long ago, when
staunch Seabrook supporter John Sununu, now White House chief of
staff, was governor.
   Critics cite near-gridlock on coastal roads on hot summer
weekends as proof the plans wouldn't work.
   ``I think they're a fraud,'' said Robert Backus, lawyer for the
Seacoast Anti-Pollution League. ``I live 40 miles away and I don't
feel safe.''
   ``This process is a sham. Whenever (the NRC) runs into a rule it
can't meet, it changes the rule,'' said Backus, who has opposed the
project for years, although he was initially neutral.
   As an example, he objected to the NRC's changing its rules to
reduce standards for utility-drafted evacuation plans after
Massachusetts refused to submit its own plans. Seabrook spokesman
Rob Williams called that 1987 change a clarification of NRC policy
for reviewing such plans.
   Last fall, the NRC further irked plant opponents by abruptly
taking control of critical Seabrook licensing issues after two
lower-level NRC panels issued conflicting findings about the
evacuation plans.
   That decision prompted a congressional investigation of NRC
procedures that is still in progress.
   ``Quite apart from the merits of Seabrook, for the NRC to muzzle
an appeals board is a brutal and naked power grab, the height of
arrogance,'' Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., said at the time.
   Plant officials claim the regulatory process has been stacked
against them.
   ``Seabrook has been through a more stringent regulatory process
than any nuclear plant ever licensed,'' Seabrook's top executive,
Edward Brown, said in November. ``The people who claim that this is
a biased process ignore the fact that it has taken 17 years from
the date of the initial license application for Seabrook to get to
this point.''
   The plant, idle since its completion in 1986 except for
low-power testing last year, became an increasing financial burden
on its main owner, Public Service Co. of New Hampshire. Barred by
state law from charging customers for Seabrook expenses before it
generated electricity, Public Service entered bankruptcy
reorganization in January 1988.
   A $2.3 billion takeover of Public Service by Connecticut-based
Northeast Utilities, parent company of Connecticut Light &amp; Power,
another Seabrook owner, should be completed by July.
   Public Service first announced plans to build a nuclear plant in
1968, but delayed it for financial reasons. In 1972, the company
announced that it planned to build two 1,150-megawatt reactors, the
first planned for commercial operation in 1979, the second in 1981.
The estimated cost: $973 million.
   Owners scrapped the second reactor in the mid-'80s, completing
the first in July 1986 at a cost of $4.3 billion. Since then,
financing and maintenance and other costs have boosted the cost by
$50 million a month, bringing the total by Thursday to $6.5 billion.
   In the meantime, protests against Seabrook continue. The
Clamshell Alliance, a group of plant opponents, announced it would
hold 24-hour vigils beginning Tuesday at the Statehouse in Concord
and at Seabrook.

<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of important
events in the decade that the Sandinistas have ruled Nicaragua:
   _ July 19, 1979: The Sandinista National Liberation Front enters
Managua, two days after dictator Anastasio Somoza had fled in
secret and begins its rule.
   _ April 1980: Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the assassination of
whose husband helped bring the Sandinistas to power, quits the
governing junta claiming health problems. She would soon start
criticizing the Sandinistas.
   _ November 1980: First attacks by anti-Sandinistas who became
known as Contras, short for the Spanish word for
counterrevolutionary.
   _ February 1981: The Reagan administration announces suspension
of aid to Nicaragua and accuses the Sandinista Front of aiding
leftist guerrillas in El Salvador.
   _ April 9, 1984: Nicaragua asks the World Court to order the
United States to stop helping the Contras. The Reagan
administration announces it will not accept the court's
jurisdiction.
   _ Jan. 10, 1985: Daniel Ortega is inaugurated as president
following national elections.
   _ May 1, 1985: Reagan announces a trade embargo against
Nicaragua.
   _ June 27, 1985: The World Court says U.S. support of the
Contras violates the U.N. charter's ban on use of force.
   _ Aug. 13, 1985: The U.S. Senate approves Reagan's request for a
military aid package for the Contras.
   _ Oct. 5, 1986: An American-manned cargo plane is shot down over
Nicaragua. Surviving crew member Eugene Hasenfus is captured and
implicates the CIA in Contra-supply operations. Hasenfus is
subsequently freed.
   _ Nov. 25, 1986: U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese admits that
some of the profits from the sale of American arms to Iran were
secretly diverted to the Contras in an operation under U.S. Marine
Lt. Col. Oliver North.
   _ Aug. 7, 1987: Five Central American presidents sign a regional
peace plan sponsored by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias. He would
subsequently receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts.
   The plan called for amnesties for political prisoners,
democratic reforms, an end to foreign aid for irregular forces, and
prohibiting one country from allowing its territory to be used by
guerrillas to attack another country.
   _ Feb. 3, 1988: Congress cuts off military aid to the Contras
but continues non-lethal aid.
   _ March 1988: Sandinistas and Contras meet for the first time in
face-to-face peace talks in the Nicaraguan border post of Sapoa.
   _ April 1, 1988: A formal 60-day truce begins.
   _ May 31, 1988: The Sandinistas decide to extend the cease-fire
on a month-to-month basis; the Contras say they consider the truce
indefinite. Fighting begins to sink to a low level.
   _ July 11, 1988: U.S. Ambassador Richard Melton is expelled from
Nicaragua along with eight other U.S. diplomats, accused of trying
to destabilize the Sandinista government. Washington retaliates by
expelling the Nicaraguan ambassador, Carlos Tunnerman, and eight
other diplomats.
   _ September 1988: Contra-Sandinista talks break down, but
thousands of Contra guerrilla fighters are moving out of the
Nicaraguan hinterland into base camps in Honduras.
   _ Jan. 30, 1989: Ortega announces a tough austerity program to
combat world-record inflation that surpassed 33,600 percent in 1988.
   _ Feb. 14, 1989: Five Central American presidents sign an accord
in El Salvador. Ortega promises early elections in exchange for
dismantling the Contras, based in Honduran jungle camps.
   _ April 28, 1989: President Bush signs a $49 million non-lethal
aid package for the Contras. The package runs out Feb. 28.
   _ Aug. 7, 1989: Five Central American presidents meeting in
Tela, Honduras, sign an agreement to dismantle the Contras' bases
in Honduras by Dec. 8. They ask help from the United Nations and
the Organization of American States. The rebels are not signatories
to that pact, which says their demobilization must be ``voluntary.''
   The Bush administration wants the Contras to remain intact to
guarantee that elections set for Feb. 25, 1990, are free and fair,
shortly before their aid package runs out.
   _ Aug. 26, 1989: Contra Commander Israel Galeano says the rebels
will ignore the Tela accord and U.S. advice and starts moving his
troops back into Nicaragua.
   _ Nov. 1, 1989: Ortega announces the lifting of the 19-month-old
cease-fire after several attacks and the infiltration of thousands
of Contra troops. Fighting surges briefly, but returns to the low
level it had reached earlier, after the U.S. cut off lethal aid.
   _ Nov. 27, 1989: Ortega refuses to deny Nicaragua's role in a
shipment of missiles found when a small plane crashes in El
Salvador. The United States and El Salvador accuse the Sandinistas
of continuing to help the Salvadoran guerrillas, who had launched
their biggest offensive on Nov. 11.
   _ Dec. 12, 1989: Ortega and four Central American presidents
issue a communique calling for the demobilization of both the
Salvadoran guerrillas and the Contras.
   _ Feb. 25, 1990: Elections are held and are seen as a test of
the sincerity of Sandinista promises to democratize.

   A probation investigator was arrested
after selling two vials of his urine for $60 to undercover agents
who claimed they were trying to fake drug tests, authorities said
Saturday.
   Roberto Santiago, a 20-year-old investigator in Hudson County's
probation department, was arrested Friday after making the sale and
was charged with two counts of second-degree official misconduct
and held on $5,000 bail, county Prosecutor Paul DePascale said.
   DePascale said Santiago was arrested at his desk Friday
afternoon.
   The prosecutor said Santiago was immediately suspended without
pay from his job. Two other probation investigators also approached
by the undercover agents declined to help fake the tests, DePascale
said.
   Both undercover agents secretly recorded conversations with
Santiago to establish intent, he said.
   The county's probation office, which collects urine samples of
former inmates and others on parole to check their compliance with
the terms of their release, sends the specimens to a private
laboratory to test for drug use.

   A federal grand jury indicted four Filipino
nationals, including a retired judge, in an alleged attempt to
smuggle weapons and ammunition to their homeland, authorities said.
   They are each accused of five counts of weapons violations and
one count of customs violations in connection with what authorities
say was a scheme to smuggle 371 pistols and 500,000 rounds of
ammunition to Cagayan province in the Philippines. The area has
been the site of frequent anti-government activity in recent months.
   Indicted Friday were Antonio Paredes, 65; his son, Quintin
Paredes III, 42; Maria Louisa Tan Hang, 34; and her husband, Kerwin
Hang, 42.
   The elder Paredes, who lives in Long Beach, was once a vice
governor and judge in the Philippines, said U.S. Attorney Carol
Gilliam, who is prosecuting the case. The other three are residents

practice, Gilliam said.
   The elder Paredes was freed on $250,000 bail. His son and Mrs.
Hang were held without bail and a bail hearing has not been set for
Mrs. Hang's husband, authorities said.
   Authorities said the pistols and ammunition were seized Feb. 8
before they were to be put on a ship bound for the Philippines.
   If convicted, each of the four faces up to 10 years in prison
and a $1 million fine on the customs charge and five years in
prison and a $250,000 fine on each of the five firearms counts.

<TEXT>
   Nicaragua's future is in the hands of
the losers in Sunday's general election as well as the winners,
former President Jimmy Carter said Saturday.
   He also said the United States should move ``immediately'' to
repair tattered relations with Nicaragua if the vote is free and
fair.
   At least 3,000 international observers are monitoring the
election, according to election officials. But Carter's verdict
will be crucial, in part because of the impact he had when he
denounced fraud in the Panamanian election last year and in part
because his group includes a dozen U.S. senators and
representatives.
   Carter said the Sandinista government, which has been in power
since the 1979 revolution, realizes the importance of holding an
election that he can endorse and has adopted virtually all of his
recommendations to ensure a clean vote.
   ``It would indeed be a hollow victory if they got the most votes
and then I went before the world media and said in my opinion this
vote was ... false,'' he said.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who has been a key player in
U.S.-Nicaragua policymaking, criticized the Bush administration for
setting conditions for normalizing relations after the vote, such
as requiring a period of ``good behavior.''
   ``I think you've got to get through the process first,'' Dodd
said.
   The Bush administration has said that even if the Sandinistas
win in a fair election, better relations depend on their ``good
behavior'' and stopping aid to El Salvador's leftist rebels. The
Sandinistas deny supplying the rebels with weapons.
   Carter and the other major observer missions, the Organization
of American States and the United Nations group, have said they are
optimistic about election day.
   They have also emphasized the importance of what follows.
   ``Will there be reconciliation? What will happen with the
Contras?'' Carter asked. ``What will be the future relationship of
Nicaragua and the United States?''
   If the election is clean, Carter said, the Bush administration
should end the U.S. economic embargo that has helped turn Nicaragua
into one of the poorest nations in the hemisphere, help demobilize
the Contra rebels and re-establish full diplomatic relations with
Nicaragua.
   ``I've urged our country to honor the process that has evolved
here and to give credit to the Nicaraguan people for having
established what I consider to be a very admirable campaign
procedure and ... a superb system for holding the elections
tomorrow.''
   Carter spoke at a news conference and then in an interview with
a small group of reporters.
   He said the winners and the losers Sunday have a critical,
continuing role in the reconciliation of this badly divided nation.
   ``Will there be a continuing commitment to the level of
democracy, freedom, openness of political campaigning, a sense of
pluralism ... a respect for human rights? That's a question to
answered by the victor,'' he said.
   ``Will those defeated participate in a constructive way, a
minority way? Will there be reconciliation? What will happen with
the Contras?''
   Carter said peace talks with the U.S.-backed Contra rebels
should begin immediately, whatever the outcome.
   ``I would hope that no matter who wins, even the opposition
parties, that the Sandinistas would begin immediate talks with the
Contras,'' he said.
   Throughout the bitter campaign, President Daniel Ortega has
accused the coalition backing his main challenger, publisher
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, of being in league with the rebels.

<HEAD>Two Arrested After Skyrocket Bursts Under Pesticide Helicopters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORWALK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fireworks skyrocket burst below two
low-flying helicopters spraying pesticide to control a fruit fly
infestation, and two men were arrested for investigation of
assault, authorities said.
   Neither helicopter was damaged by the skyrocket, which was
observed by both pilots about 9:45 p.m. Friday, said Los Angeles
County sheriff's Deputy Chris Wahla.
   The alleged attack on the helicopters occurred amid a rising
public outcry against the repeated aerial spraying of the pesticide
malathion over Los Angeles suburbs where the Mediterranean fruit
fly has been found.
   The non-native Medfly is regarded as a threat to many fruits and
vegetables grown commercially in California. Officials maintain
spraying of a sticky mixture of malathion and corn syrup bait
doesn't pose a health threat, but opponents of the spraying say too
little is known about the potential risk.
   The rocket went up 200 feet before exploding in a shower of
sparks, witnesses said. The helicopters were flying in formation at
about 500 feet.
   A state ground spotter in radio contact with the helicopters saw
two men lighting the skyrocket, and called authorities.
   Patrick Gilmour of Lakewood and Charles Rockwell of Fullerton,
both 21, were booked for investigation of assault with a deadly
weapon.
   The men denied ligniting the skyrocket, Wahla said.

   Anti-government protesters stoned
buses and cars around the capital Saturday and demanded freedom for
students who were beaten and detained after ending a church sit-in,
witnesses said.
   Teachers at the state-run university announced support for the
6-day-old student protests, the most serious challenge to the
government in decades.
   Also, the clandestine Ivorian Peoples Front announced the
government banned its newletter following a first edition that
called for a peaceful transition to democracy. The government cited
a 1951 law on the need to protect public order and bar publication
of false information.
   The protesters are challenging the regime of conservative
President Felix Houphuet-Boigny. They want a multiparty government
and have protested officials' lavish lifestyles during a time of
austerity in this West African nation.
   About 100 students ran through the central Boulevard de la
Republique, yelling ``Liberty!'' and ``Free our comrades!'' on
Saturday, and police took no action against them. Protesters
demanded police free 200 students who were arrested and beaten
early Saturday when they ended a 10-hour occupation of the
Abidjan's Roman Catholic cathedral.
   The students also criticized the church, saying it had failed to
mediate with the government over their demands for democracy.
   A Catholic official accused a Cabinet minister of lying to
Cardinal Bernard Yago, who was assured the protesters inside the
church would receive safe passage if they left.
   Police also beat and briefly detained a priest who accompanied
the students to guarantee their safety, the official said on
condition of anonymity. The priest was identified as the Rev.
Jean-Pierre Koutouan, curator of St. Paul's Cathedral in this
capital city.
   Police were seen beating the students on the bus that drove them
to the main police station. It was not known how many protesters
were injured.
   The cardinal confronted police about the beatings, then met with
Interior Minister Youssouf Kone, who denied ever giving assurances
of safety, the official said.
   More than three dozen other students were arrested during the
week, but some were released and it was not known how many remained
in detention. One student said he had a friend among the church
protesters who was arrested and later released.
   Students and other protesters Saturday stoned buses in the
sprawling marketplace of Treichville, a slum suburb a few miles
from the city center, and shopkeepers quickly closed their doors,
witnesses said.
   In another protest, students stoned buses and cars on the main
road between the city center and Yopougon, a working-class suburb
where the trouble started Monday when protesters set fire to two
cars.
   New protests were also reported by witnesses Saturday in Adjame,
another working-class neighborhood.
   The Ivorian League of Human Rights said the ``forces of law and
order have brutally intervened ... following the rebellion by
students.''
   Houphouet-Boigny, 84, has ruled this nation as a one-party state
since its independence from France in 1960. He has refused recent
calls for a multiparty government, saying the system endangered
national unity.
   Dissent has grown in Ivory Coast as the economy suffers from a
decade-old recession caused by slumping cocoa and coffee prices
that brought unemployment and pay cuts to one of Africa's more
prosperous countries.
   In its announcement Saturday, the union of university lecturers
announced it was backing the students. It called for political and
economic reforms and a better-funded education system.
   In an indirect response, state television news quoted from a
letter it said it received from a citizen denouncing the
association's statement ``as intellectual red (communist) trash ...
that in no way reflects the realities of the economic crisis facing
Ivorians.''
   It was the first time the state-run news media has acknowledged
the unrest.

   The fifth of six prisoners who escaped a
prison in Joliet turned himself in Saturday at his parents' urging,
a prison system spokesman said.
   Ronald Roach, 20, surrendered at the Stark County Sheriff's

said Nic Howell, spokesman for the Illinois Department of
Corrections.
   Roach was to be returned to Joliet to face arraignment on escape
charges, Howell said.
   Roach was serving a four-year sentence for burglary when he and
five other prisoners escaped before dawn Feb. 11 from the
maximum-security Joliet Correctional Center, the state's oldest
prison.
   All the other escapees have been captured except for 21-year-old
David Rodriguez of Chicago, who was serving a 25-year term for
murder.

<HEAD>Governors Want Expanded Funding for Head Start Program</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: UPDATES with session debate; edits to tighten</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's governors parted with the White
House Saturday over the level of funding necessary for the popular
preschool program Head Start.
   The debate during the first session of the National Governors
Association's winter meeting centered on the national educational
goals outlined recently by President Bush.
   Before the formal opening of their debate, NGA chairman Terry
Branstad, the Republican governor of Iowa, declared that ``we
believe that it is not acceptable to just let American education
sit where it is today. There has to be radical change.''
   Many of the goals ``are very ambitious and they may be extremely
difficult to achieve,'' Branstand said.
   Budget Director Richard G. Darman was appearing before the
governors on Sunday, and the state officials were having dinner
with Bush at the White House. The governors also were to meet with
Bush on Monday.
   Although they expanded the student achievement goal, the most
controversial action came in the objectives approved as part of the
so-called ``readiness'' goal.
   Bush in his State of the Union address proposed that by the year
2000, all children in America will start school ready to learn. His
focus was on 4-year-olds.
   The NGA Education Task Force, at the urging of co-chairman Gov.
Bill Clinton of Arkansas, approved the objective to fully fund Head
Start, which provides preschool services such as breakfast, lunch
and health screening to needy children between the ages of 3 and 5.
   Under the approved objective: ``The federal government should
work with the states to develop early intervention strategies for
children. All eligible children should have access to Head Start,
Chapter I, or some other successful preschool program with strong
parental involvement. Our first priority must be to provide at
least one year of pre-school for all disadvantaged children.''
   Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer pushed to include Chapter
I in the objective, although that program aids disadvantaged
elementary and secondary students.
   Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste, Gov. John Ashcroft of Missouri and
Gov. Ray Mabus of Mississippi led the push to insert language to
fully fund the preschool program.
   Asked later whether the White House would have problems with the
Head Start language, Clinton said, ``I don't know. I hope not.''
   Clinton noted that the Bush administration would have until the
year 2000 to accomplish that objective.
   However, Roger Porter, White House domestic policy adviser, was
noncommital.
   ``I can't say anything until everything's over,'' said Porter,
noting that Bush last year proposed spending $250 million for the
program and has asked for $500 million for fiscal year 1991.
   The task force estimated it would cost about $1.5 billion to
fully fund the program.
   The governors also broadened the language of the student
achievement goal.
   Bush had said that by the year 2000, American students will
leave grades four, eight, and 12 having demonstrated competency in
challenging subject matter, including English, mathematics,
science, history and geography.
   Rather than changing the goal as Clinton had suggested, the task
force agreed to add that: ``every school in America will ensure
that all students learn to use their minds well, so they may be
prepared for responsible citizenship, further learning, and
productive employment in our modern economy.''
   ``It's pretty hard to disagree with this,'' said Porter
chuckling.
   The conference ends on Tuesday with House Speaker Thomas Foley,
D-Wash., discussing the congressional agenda.
   The NGA session was the first opportunity for the governors to
begin putting their own stamp on the drive to improve the nation's
educational system.
   ``We are here to create a national consensus to make American
education world class,'' said Branstad. ``We believe it is not
acceptable to just let American education sit where it is today.
There has to be radical change.''
   Branstad said that even after the governors approve the
objectives ``this will remain a dynamic process and adjustments and
improvements will be made along the way.''

   A youth honored as America's safest
teen-age driver may have fallen asleep at the wheel before his car
slammed head-on into another this weekend, killing him and the
other driver, police said.
   The boy, Michael Doucette, 17, of Concord, and the other driver,
Sharon Ann Link, 19, of Lebanon, were pronounced dead at the scene.
The crash occurred shortly after 5 p.m. Friday.
   According to the police report, Doucette's car _ which he won in
the safe driver competition _ drifted over the center line and
slammed head-on into Link's. It appeared Link may have tried to
swerve out of the way of the oncoming car, as the collision
happened at the extreme right side of her lane.
   ``Preliminary investigation shows (Doucette) may have fallen
asleep at the wheel,'' the state police report said. Henniker
police said Saturday that no further information on the accident
would be released until the investigation is finished.
   A passenger in Link's car, Michael Dimascola, 20, of Lebanon,
was injured in the crash, and was listed in stable condition
Saturday at Concord Hospital. Last July, Doucette won the safe
driving title in a contest called ``Operation Driver Excellence''
sponsored by Dodge and AMVETS, a veterans group. The contest was
held in Detroit.
   He won a $5,000 scholarship, a trophy and the use of a 1989
Dodge for a year. That is the car he was driving Friday night. He
also won a state competition, netting $250 cash and $500
scholarship.
   Doucette, driving the winning car, was one of the attractions in
a New Year's Eve parade down Concord's Main Street.
   Concord High School Principal Charles Foley was shaken by the
news. ``He was just a fine kid from a good family,'' Foley said.
``It's heartbreaking.''
   After winning the competition last year, Doucette said the
contest was ``like a driver's test, only a lot harder.''
   ``You need to concentrate and be aware of many things. Not
anyone can do it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Custody Battle Shifts From Washington to New Zealand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The search for Hilary is over. But the war for
her has widened.
   America's most famed child custody battle has boiled across two
oceans in just the past week, first into the courtrooms of Britain,
and now, into those of New Zealand. Hilary Foretich, 7 1@2 years
old, has been found, by her father's investigators, living with her
maternal grandparents in Christchurch.
   And there, presumably within days, the fight which has cost the
girl's mother alone nearly $2 million _ and more than two years in
jail _ will resume. Both parents intend to be there, with the
prospect that another nation's courts will become embroiled in a
case which already has produced more than 450 pleadings before U.S.
judges, with no end in sight.
   Hilary is the daughter of Jean Elizabeth Morgan, the 42-year-old
Washington plastic surgeon who has persistently charged her
ex-husband, Eric Foretich, with sexually abusing the child. Having
failed to support those allegations to the satisfaction of any
court, she sent Hilary into hiding and spent 759 days in jail
rather than accord Foretich his legal visitation rights, an act
which earned the mother, in countless hearts, a martyr's stature.
   Her sympathizers included the Congress and President Bush, who
signed the legislation which freed her last September from
municipal Judge Herbert Dixon's indeterminate sentence for contempt.
   Foretich, 45, a dental surgeon in suburban Falls Church, Va.,
never yielded, meanwhile, in his search for Hilary.
   He made several trips to Great Britain, where, just days ago, a
BBC talk-show producer, Di Burgess, was forced under court order
obtained by Foretich's attorneys to reveal what she had learned in
the wake of filming a documentary on the case. And that, in short,
was that the child, under the name Ellen Morgan, had attended a
girl's prep school in Plymouth, England, in the 1987-88 school
year, while living with her grandparents.
   Within days, Foretich's investigators tracked the older couple,
William and Antonia Morgan, to their current home in New Zealand,
at Christchurch, about 190 miles southwest of the capital city of
Wellington. It had long been speculated that Elizabeth Morgan had
entrusted Hilary to her parents, but their whereabouts remained a
mystery.
   Their role discovered, the elder Morgans obtained an order from
a New Zealand Family Court on Friday which temporarily entitles
them to retain custody of Hilary, according to Roger Carson,
detective chief inspector in Christchurch. He said a further
hearing is scheduled this week.
   ``I ... found my daughter,'' Foretich said early Saturday before
leaving for New Zealand. ``I'm elated.''
   But neither he nor Ms. Morgan would predict what legal fates
await them or Hilary. ``I don't have any illusions that this is
going to be easy,'' Foretich said.
   Ms. Morgan, meanwhile, seemed almost relieved that her
three-year secret was out. While declining to reveal whether she
had had any contact with Hilary since her release from jail, she
said: ``I can tell you I talked to her at length today. And we had
a heavenly conversation.''
   Ms. Morgan and her new husband, U.S. Appeals Judge Paul Michel,
spent several hours Saturday with her attorney, Stephen Sachs.
Their first objective: to convince Dixon, the Superior Court judge
who jailed her, to return her passport, without which she cannot
legally travel to New Zealand. They plan to argue for that on
Monday.
   Ms. Morgan declined to give an accounting of her parents'
travels, or to say how long they have been in New Zealand.
   She said, though, that she had been assured that New Zealand has
very strong statutes protecting children, and that the court there
will make no decision until Hilary has been evaluated by an expert
in child sexual abuse. But she also acknowledged that many nations
routinely respect the findings of one another's courts in child
custody cases.
   ``I'm not a foreteller of the future,'' she said. ``I would like
to think that our courts would offer her what I've been asking. At
the moment, if I brought her back today, she would not be
protected.''
   For years, each parent has accused the other of making Hilary's
life a nightmare. In the U.S. courts, the case is called Civil
Action No. D 684-83. To the American public, it is the Elizabeth
Morgan Story, even as every judge along the way has deemed it
unsupported by evidence.
   Ms. Morgan has claimed there was physical evidence _ scarring _
that Foretich sexually abused their daughter. To that, Foretich
countered in court that the scars were the consequence of injuries
caused by Ms. Morgan herself to stage photographic evidence to
bolster her claims. A Virginia judge dismissed the mother's suit
for exclusive custody when she refused to produce her daughter in
court.
   Foretich, recently separated from his fourth wife _ Elizabeth
Morgan was the third _ has said ``I've made some poor decisions in
some of the women I've been associated with ... but I did not rape
my children. That I did not do. I'd blow my brains out first.''
   By his account, Ms. Morgan ``is insane ... totally evil.''
   At one point, Ms. Morgan also accused Foretich's parents, both
over 70, of sexually abusing Hilary on the girl's visits to
Foretich's Early Georgian home, modeled after the President's House
at his alma mater, the College of William and Mary.
   By their account, they had driven up from Gloucester Point, Va.,
each time Hilary was brought to their son's house, on the advice of
a lawyer friend who had advised him to keep the place in
``wall-to-wall people'' because of a developing trend in child
custody cases _ accusations of sexual abuse.
   Among others who visited the house at the same time as young
Hilary was Foretich's other daughter, Heather, now 10, born to his
second wife, Sharon Foretich. And, in 1985, Sharon Foretich,
following Morgan's example, accused him of sexually abusing Heather.
   Foretich contended that his second and third wives had colluded
on their cases, and that Heather had been coached. He took and
passed two lie-detector tests on his behavior with the two
children, and a Virginia court ruled that Sharon Foretich had not
proved her allegation, either.

<TEXT>
   Here, in chronological order, are key
developments related to the battle between Dr. Elizabeth Morgan and
Dr. Eric Foretich for custody of their 7-year-old daughter, Hilary:
   January 1982: Morgan and Foretich are married in Haiti, where
Foretich also gets a divorce from his second wife. Morgan, at the
time, is two months pregnant with Hilary.
   August 1982: Morgan moves out of Foretich's home in Great Falls,
Va., a Washington suburb. Morgan and her mother, who has been
living with the couple, return to Morgan's home in Washington.
Hilary is born a week later.
   November 1982: Morgan obtains a Haitian divorce from Foretich.
   March 1983: Morgan and Foretich sue each other for custody in
D.C. Superior Court. Since the girl was born, Morgan has permitted
Foretich to see the child only in a day care center, and has
stopped those visits after hiring an at-home baby sitter.
   November 1983: Morgan is awarded permanent custody, but Foretich
wins liberal visitation rights.
   November 1985: Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon hears Morgan's
allegations that Foretich has sexually abused Hilary. He rules in
favor of Foretich, saying the evidence is not conclusive.
   August 1986: Morgan files a civil suit in federal court against
Foretich and his parents, claiming that the grandparents also have
abused the child. The grandparents file a counterclaim for
defamation. After a lengthy trial, the jury rules against each
side's claim.
   August 1986: After conducting a 12-day hearing on continued
allegations of abuse, Judge Dixon orders Morgan to jail for
refusing to allow Foretich to visit their daughter. Morgan is
released after three days by the D.C. Court of Appeals, which
requires that she surrender the deed to her house as bond and turn
over her passport.
   February 1987: Dixon sends Morgan to jail again. She is released
after three days, after agreeing let Foretich visit Hilary.
   April 1987: Dixon orders Morgan to allow Foretich unsupervised
weekend visits with his daughter. Morgan alleges that the child is
abused again.
   August 1987: Dixon jails Morgan a third time, after Morgan
refuses to produce the child for a two-week, unsupervised visit.
The child is missing.
   August 1988: The D.C. Court of Appeals upholds Morgan's
incarceration. Finding that both sides presented believable
evidence, the court described the effect on Hilary by quoting an
African proverb: ``When elephants fight, it is the grass that
suffers.''
   December, 1988: Judge Dixon refuses to release Morgan, saying,
``The coercion has only just begun.'' On Dec. 28, her incarceration
eclipses the record for civil contempt cases.
   January 1989: The U.S. Supreme Court refuses to hear Morgan's
appeal.
   September 1989: Morgan is freed after Congress passes a law,
tailored for her, limiting civil contempt imprisonment in the
District of Columbia to a year. Hilary's whereabouts remain unknown.
   February 1990: Hilary is discovered by Foretich's investigators
to be living in Christchurch, New Zealand, with Morgan's parents. A
New Zealand court temporarily bars Foretich from contacting the
girl, and indicates it will begin its own custody hearings within a
week.

   President Daniel Ortega, confident
he'll be re-elected to a second six-year term, said Saturday he
would invite President Bush to his inauguration as part of an
effort to normalize relations after 10 years of bitterness.
   ``The doors of Nicaragua are open to the president of the United
States,'' he told a group of journalists. ``I am going to invite
the government of the United States and President Bush to the
inauguration.''
   Relations between the United States and Nicaragua have been
bitter for 10 years as U.S.-sponsored Contra guerrillas tried to
topple the Ortega's leftist Sandinista government.
   But with a staggering economy _ in part due to U.S. trade
sanctions _ and the military defeat of the Contras, the Sandinistas
are eager to normalize relations.
   Ortega faces an opposition coalition headed by newspaper
publisher Violeta Barrios de Chamorro in Sunday's elections, which
will be monitored by more than 3,000 international observers.
   Ortega is considered the favorite, and European diplomats
consulted here Saturday said there is a consensus among them that
Ortega will be re-elected.
   He has often said Bush should come to Nicaragua to understand
its reality.
   His invitation appeared to be another pitch to bring the United
States to the negotiating table.
   Ortega said there is mutual distrust between the United States
and Nicargua.
   ``It is not easy to change this situation that the United States
caused,'' he said, referring to the U.S. support of the Contra
rebels.
   The United States says Nicaragua has been shipping arms to
Salvadoran rebels, and Secretary of State James A. Baker said
Thursday that even if the Sandinistas win a fair election, a
``substantial period of good behavior'' would be required before
relations could be normalized.
   ``I can understand Baker's tone. It requires not only the good
will of both countries, but the combined action of the
international community in favor of an agreement to overcome our
differences,'' Ortega said.
   He said Spanish President Felipe Gonzalez, ``who has good
communication with Bush,'' could be a good intermediary between
Nicaragua and the United Sates.
   ``I have talked to Gonzalez about this several times,'' he said.
   Ortega once again refused to say flatly that his government
would not in the future send arms to leftist rebels of the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front in El Salvador.
   He said he has stated repeatedly that Nicaragua is not sending
weapons to the Salvadoran rebels, but the United States believes
otherwise. A plane from Nicaragua was shot down in El Salvador last
November carrying rockets for the rebels.
   ``The United States and Nicargua must sit down and discuss
this,'' he said. ``We said before we are not sending weapons. We
have asked the United Nations to verify this.''
   Sources close to the Nicaraguan government said the Sandinistas
had made a policy decision not to send arms to the FMLN after a
Central American summit conference on Dec. 12.
   Ortega said Central American presidents have a written agreement
not to allow weapons to be sent to rebel groups in the region, but
that the United States does not respect this agreement.
   He added the United States says it is sending only humanitarian
assistance to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua, ``but that equipment
can be used to set up ambushes.''
   The U.S. aid consists of non-lethal items such as food, tents
and boots, but the Sandinistas point out that boots can help troops
in the jungle.
   The Nicaraguan president also said, in answer to another
question, that Sandinista defense expenditures would be reduced as
the war with the U.S.-backed Contras winds down.
   Nicaragua currently has the largest armed force by far in the
region.
   ``All Central American presidents agree that an arms race does
not favor economic and social development,'' he said.

   A prominent human rights activist has
been arrested in the government crackdown on the movement for
multiparty democracy, an associate said Saturday.
   The arrest was reported on the eve of planned nationwide
demonstrations to demand an end to a 29-year-old ban on political
parties in this Himalayan kingdom.
   Government spokesman Radhey Sham Bista refused to comment on the
reported arrest.
   The human rights activist, Mathura Prasad Shrestha, was taken
away by policemen from his Katmandu home late Friday to an
undisclosed location, said Debendra Raj Panday, the vice-president
of the Human Rights Organization of Nepal.
   Panday said he was told about Shrestha's arrest by ``sources
other than his family,'' but he refused to elaborate.
   He said Shrestha is a member of the Forum for Protection of
Human Rights, which works closely with Panday's group.
   Shrestha, a professor of community medicine at the Teaching
Hospital of Tribhuvan University in Katmandu, had organized a rally
by doctors and medical students on Friday to protest the deaths of
demonstrators during the democracy movement.
   ``I think that is what prompted the government action. The
government is so intolerant,'' Panday said.
   The government says 12 protesters have died since last Sunday,
when two banned political groups _ the Nepali Congress Party and a
left-wing coalition _ launched a campaign to demand restoration of
multiparty democracy. Most victims died in police gunfire.
   Activists allege that the death toll is nearly double the
government figure. They also say that at least 1,000 people have
been arrested and that some were being tortured in jail.
   The government says 175 people have been arrested and denies
allegations of torture.
   Panday said he along with Shrestha and other human rights
activists met Prime Minister Marich Mansingh Shresta on Friday to
``express concern at the repressive measures of the government.''
   ``It was an unproductive meeting, and the prime minister had no
cogent argument to put before us,'' he said, adding that the
two-hour meeting often became heated.
   Protest leaders said they planned demonstrations nationwide on
Sunday to protest the killings during the government crackdown.
   Political demonstrations are banned in Nepal.
   Nepal's two-year experiment with a Western-style democracy ended
in 1961, when King Mahendra, the father of the present monarch,
King Birendra, dissolved the government of the Nepali Congress
Party. He accused it of corruption and poor administration and
banned political parties.

   A decade of Sandinista pride and U.S.
hostility toward Nicaragua goes on the line Sunday as voters decide
whether to stick with their leftist government for six more years.
   The candidates of the two top parties _ Sandinista President
Daniel Ortega and Violeta Barrios de Chamorro of the United
National Opposition or UNO _ embody the choices for Nicaragua's
future.
   ``These elections constitute a gigantic and irreversible step in
the process toward a greater democratization and reconciliation of
the nation,'' Ortega wrote in an editorial published Saturday in
the Sandinista party newspaper Barricada.
   The Sandinistas have put a priority on not just winning or
winning fairly, but also on appearing to win fairly.
   To that end, they have invited election observers, including the
Organization of American States, the United Nations and former
President Jimmy Carter. Ismary Castillo, a spokeswoman for the
Supreme Electoral Council, said Saturday that at least 3,000
observers had been accredited and that in the end there would
probably be 4,000 from more than 40 groups.
   U.S. policy is also at stake: If the Sandinistas win a fair vote
it will be difficult for President Bush to maintain the hostility
of the past. Should Mrs. Chamorro win, the U.S. hostility is
expected to end.
   Ortega said Saturday that he would invite Bush to his
inauguration as part of an effort to normalize relations after 10
years of bitterness.
   ``The doors of Nicaragua are open to the president of the United
States,'' he told a group of journalists.
   Ortega has been favored in polls, but his opponents say
Nicaraguans are afraid to reveal their true feelings outside a
truly secret ballot box. About 1.75 million of Nicaragua's 3.5
million people are registered to vote.
   The tough guerrilla fighter in Ortega has refused to bow to the
United States, which is called ``the enemy of humanity'' in the
Sandinista Front anthem.
   Lately, the statesman has prevailed over the rebel, sending
conciliatory overtures to Washington.
   With changes in the East bloc siphoning off aid and reducing the
moral authority of the extreme left, the Sandinistas are eager to
restore normal relations with Washington to help right their
battered economy.
   The Sandinistas have released political prisoners, said they
wanted a mixed economy and pledged there will be no more
expropriations of private property.
   Ortega's life has been dedicated to the Sandinista cry that
``the past will never return,'' a past that included U.S. military
and economic intervention and right-wing dictatorships. Mrs.
Chamorro and UNO, he says, are the heirs to that legacy.
   Mrs. Chamorro portrays herself as a torch-bearer for the
democratic ideals of her slain husband, revered civic leader Pedro
Joaquin Chamorro, and of his trademark promise that ``Nicaragua
will be a republic again.''
   Mrs. Chamorro's bitterness at what she considers the
Sandinistas' betrayal of those ideals and the nation's deep
economic crisis are UNO's two top drawing cards.
   ``On this bright day, which announces the end of the dark night
of Sandinismo, I raise my flag of national reconciliation,'' Mrs.
Chamorro told some 60,000 supporters at UNO's final rally a week
ago.
   The Sandinista National Liberation Front has two points in its
favor: It helped free Nicaragua from years of dictatorship in 1979,
and it has given the common Nicaraguan a sense of national pride in
standing up to ``the colossus to the north,'' as the United States
is often called.
   The Sandinistas are counting on that grassroots loyalty and
pride to defeat Mrs. Chamorro, whom they call ``an instrument of
U.S. policy.''
   They admit to some errors but blame the economic crisis on the
long war against U.S.-supported Contra guerrillas and a U.S.
economic embargo.
   UNO promises to lift Nicaragua from the dubious distinction of
being called by some experts the poorest nation in the Western
hemisphere, and to finally bring true democracy after 45 years of
Somoza family rule and 10 years of Sandinismo.
   Ortega has said he is not running against UNO but against
President Bush. In fact, the Sandinistas believe that with a
certified election in hand, Bush will agree to deal with Ortega.
   Ortega has said the elections mark ``the beginning of an era
where the United States recognizes Nicaragua's right to
self-determination.''
   Also hanging in the balance are Nicaragua's relations with its
neighbors, who worry about the Sandinista military machine and fear
it backs leftist guerrillas in El Salvador.
   The Sandinista Front, the enfant terrible of the region, will be
transformed just for having gone through what many consider
Nicaragua's first truly free elections this century.
   From its original project of a Cuban-style one-party state, the
Sandinistas' own guerrilla movement has been forced to turn into a
party organized to win elections.
   Ortega himself has evolved from a dour-faced president to a
modern candidate who smiles, kisses babies and jumps on stage in
jeans and bright cotton shirts while waving the red-and-black
Sandinista flag.

<HEAD>Fire Knocks Out Power To Much of Downtown Seattle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARRIE FIGDOR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 70 blocks of downtown Seattle lost
electrical power for several hours Saturday after a fire in a
transformer vault.
   No injuries were reported, but the outage darkened hotel lobbies
and shut down switching equipment for the Washington State Lottery,
leaving some people unable to buy tickets on the night of a $6
million drawing _ one of the state's largest in months.
   The Fire Department responded about 11:30 a.m. and doused it by
1:50 p.m., a fire dispatcher said.
   City Light spokesman Hugh McIntosh said power was restored at
3:35 p.m. to the entire area.
   ``There was less damage than we had feared,'' McIntosh said
after initially indicating power restoration could take days.
   The area affected was bigger than, and included, the section
that was without power during a similar transformer vault fire in
August 1988. In that incident, power was out for three days,
McIntosh said.
   The fire apparently started in a device that works like a
circuit breaker in the Olympic Building, he said. The vault is in
the building's basement.
   The primary electric cables were across the room and were
undamaged, he said. The vault contains three transformers and three
cables. The protector device was replaced, allowing the power to
come back on, he said.
   City Light had closed down those cables plus three others at a
nearby substation when news of the fire was received, he said.
Those six cables or circuits constitute most of the downtown
network, he said.
   The area of the power outage encompassed Pike Place Market,
several major department stores, the Seattle Aquarium and the Port
of Seattle.
   Lottery spokesman Dick Paulson said 417 of the lottery system's
980 terminals in the state _ from south Seattle to the Canadian
border _ were without power because of the fire. The terminals are
connected to a switching center located in the Westin Building.
   People in four counties were unable to buy tickets, but the
drawing would take place as usual, Paulson said.

   Masked Arabs Saturday killed a 30-year-old
Palestinian suspected of cooperating with Israeli authorities,
Israel radio reported.
   An army spokesman, who under regulations could not be
identified, confirmed the death and said police were investigating
the circumstances.
   Israel radio identified the victim as Ahmed Hawajeh of the
village of Naalin near the West Bank town of Ramallah.
   His death raised to 189 the number of Arabs killed by fellow
Palestinians on suspicion of cooperating with Israeli authorities
during the 26-month-old Palestinian uprising against the Israeli
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   At least 658 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops or
civilians and 43 Israelis have died in the violence.
   Also Saturday, Israel television reported that Israel is
prepared to accept peace talks with a Palestinian delegation that
includes a deportee and an Arab living in East Jerusalem.
   The television said the agreement was worked out after Friday's
meeting between Foreign Minister Moshe Arens and Secretary of State
James A. Baker III and a series of talks in Washington held by
Cabinet Minister Ehud Olmert.
   A foreign ministry spokesman could not confirm the report and in
a later television broadcast Olmert was quoted as denying that such
an agreement was reached.
   Including a deportee in a Palestinian delegation has been
suggested as a way of satisfying the PLO's demand that diaspora
Palestinians be included in the talks, while at the same time
adhering to Israel's insistance that it will talk to only residents
of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The television and both of Israel's radio stations reported
Saturday that the nation's four top leaders _ Arens, Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir, Finance Minister Shimon Peres and Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin _ will meet to discuss proposals for the makeup of a
Palestinian delegation before Arens travels to Poland on Monday.

   President Joaquin
Balaguer was nominated Saturday by a governing party convention to
run for a fifth term in elections scheduled for May.
   Balaguer, 83 and nearly blind, had refused to say whether he
would seek re-election until he underwent a medical examination in
Houston, Texas, on Feb. 12 and received a clean bill of health.
   The convention of 1,750 members of the center-right Social
Christian Reformist Party also authorized Balaguer to pick a
running mate of his choice for the May 16 balloting.
   Opinion polls have indicated Balaguer is the second-favorite
candidate after former President Juan Bosch, 82.
   Balaguer, a former minister under the late dictator Rafael L.
Trujillo, was first elected to power in 1966 and won subsequent
four year terms in 1970, 1974 and 1986.
   After Trujillo's assassination in 1960, Bosch, a leftist, won
general elections in 1962, but was ousted in a military coup a year
later. In 1965 U.S. troops invaded the island after Bosch
supporters and loyalist soldiers attempted to overthrow a civilian
junta.

<HEAD>1950s Balladeer Johnnie Ray, Precursor to Rock 'n' Roll</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifties balladeer Johnnie Ray, known as the
``Prince of Wails'' for his vocal histrionics on such songs as
``Somebody Stole My Gal'' and ``Just Walkin' in the Rain,'' died
Saturday of liver failure. He was 63.
   Ray, who had entered Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on Feb. 16 with
liver failure, died at 4 p.m., said hospital spokesman Ron Wise.
   ``His family and friends were with him at the time of his
death,'' Wise said.
   In the early 1950s, the slender, boyish singer revolutionized
popular music with his unique blend of rhythm and blues, country
and gospel punctuated with real-sounding sobs.
   Some said his raw and emotional style opened the door to a new
type of music that later became rock 'n' roll.
   Ray's first hit record was ``Cry,'' followed by ``The Little
White Cloud That Cried,'' ``Please Mr. Sun,'' ``Brokenhearted, ''
``What's the Use,'' ``Somebody Stole My Gal,'' ``Who's Sorry Now,''
and ``Yes Tonight Josephine.''
   ``Cry,'' perhaps Ray's greatest hit, has sold more than 25
million copies since its original release, said his publicist, Alan
Eichler.
   Ray's raw and emotional style was controversial for the early
1950s, and he drew huge crowds in nightclub appearances in New York
and elsewhere.
   As the press reached for phrases to describe his performance,
Ray was crowned at various times as ``The Prince of Wails,'' ``The
Nabob of Sob,'' ``The Howling Success,'' `The Song Wringer,'' ``The
Cry Guy'' and the ``Master of Misery.''
   ``Of course the days are gone of the screaming teen-agers _ and
nobody had them screaming more than I did,'' Ray recalled in a 1984
interview with the Associated Press.
   ``But even in those days I had the same kind of audience I have
now _ the elderly, the middle-aged and the young kids,'' he said.
``I don't have a TV series, I've had no hit records.
   Ray was born Jan. 10, 1927, in Dallas, Ore., a tiny town near
Salem.
   It was there he saw his first movie when he was 3 or 4. ``It was
Edna Mae Oliver in `Murder on the Blackboard,' and from then on I
wanted to be a movie star,'' he told the AP.
   In 1954, Darryl F. Zanuck gave him a seven-year contract with
20th Century Fox and he appeared with Ethel Merman, Dan Dailey,
Marilyn Monroe, Donald O'Connor and Mitzi Gaynor in ``There's No
Business Like Show Business.''
   His movie career ended, however, when Zanuck resigned to become
an independent producer. Ray recalled that the new chief at Fox was
not a fan.
   Ray's success as a recording artist also waned in the United
States as other forms of rock 'n' roll gained popularity.
   But he remained popular in England and Australia, Eichler said,
and he continued to perform there until last year.
   His last public appearance was Oct. 7 at the Grand Theatre in
Salem, Ore.
   Ray married Marilyn Morrison in 1952, but the union lasted only
two years, the publicist said. He is survived by his sister, Elma
Money, and several nieces and nephews.

   The White House said Saturday that President
Bush will meet late this week in California with Japanese Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu, a meeting bound to touch on frustrated
efforts to resolve trade disagreements.
   The two will meet this coming Friday and Saturday in Palm
Springs ``for a general discussion of international developments,
the U.S.-Japanese global partnership and bilateral relations,'' a
White House statement said.
   The announcement said that Bush telephoned Kaifu on Friday to
congratulate him on the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's recent
electoral triumph and that the pair agreed on the ``desirability of
an early meeting.''
   The two leaders met for the first time in September, when Kaifu
visited Washington soon after becoming prime minister.
   ``The visit underlies the vital importance both countries attach
to the U.S.-Japanese relationship and its contribution to the
preservation of peace and prosperity in the Pacific and throughout
the world,'' the White House said.
   Bush wants to hear Japan's position on the political changes in
Eastern Europe and hopes for an early exchange of opinions on
Japanese-U.S. cooperation toward thawing East-West ties, a Japanese
Foreign Ministry official told Kyodo News Service in Tokyo.
   Another Foreign Ministry official told Kyodo that the two sides
hope to find ways to improve their strained trade relations.
   Kaifu is expected to reassure Bush that Japan intends to solve
issues such as the ``structural impediments'' at the top of
Washington's complaint list on trade with Japan. The U.S. trade
deficit with Japan for 1989 is expected to reach $49 billion.
   A two-day round of U.S.-Japan ``Structural Impediments
Initiative'' talks ended inconclusively in Tokyo on Friday with the
two sides taking widely divergent positions on fundamental aspects
of the Japanese economy. The American government believes the
Japanese have not responded to U.S. demands regarding market
barriers, the ministry official told Kyodo.

   Four years after the United States
encouraged Ferdinand Marcos to surrender power to Corazon Aquino,
harsh rhetoric and wide differences over U.S. military bases have
strained U.S.-Filipino relations.
   The problems have emerged nearly three months after U.S.
warplanes helped save Mrs. Aquino from military mutineers.
Ironically, the intervention may have aggravated relations by
encouraging her government to assert its independence from its
former colonial power.
   Since her highly publicized ``snub'' of Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney last week, the government has tried to soften its rhetoric
on the advice of its ambassador to Washington, Emmanuel Pelaez.
   But the strains also have been exacerbated by statements from
American officials questioning the political survivability of Mrs.
Aquino, who was touted as the savior of democracy when she was
swept to power on Feb. 25, 1986 uprising against Marcos.
   ``Let me just acknowledge to you that ... relations are in a
bumpy path right now,'' U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt said in a TV
interview last week. ``We're in some turbulent air.''
   Relations with Washington began to sour last month after
Congress cut $96 million from the Bush administration's Philippine
aid package.
   Filipinos considered this a violation of the October 1988
agreement under which the United States offered $962 million over
two years in return for use of Clark Air Base, the Subic Bay naval
base and four smaller installations through the end of their lease
in 1991.
   Talks on extending the lease are expected to begin in a few
weeks. But any agreement must be ratified by two-thirds of the
Philippines' 23-member Senate. Many in the 195-member House of
Representatives have urged Mrs. Aquino to postpone talks on the
bases until aid is restored.
   Before Cheney's visit, Mrs. Aquino said she would not receive
him because she was angry over negative U.S. media reports on her
administration.
   Filipino officials now insist the ``snub'' was to demonstrate
anger over aid cuts. But Mrs. Aquino, who bristles at criticism,
cited only the press reports, making it appear her decision was
more emotional than political.
   Filipino diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the Philippine Embassy in Washington warned the administration
that the snub and strong anti-American statements from congressmen
and commentators threatened to undermine U.S. support.
   The apparent attempt by the Aquino government to distance itself
from Washington stems from the sensitive nature of the bases issue
and a desire to display independence.
   An influential minority here believes the bases infringe on
sovereignty and that the presence of military men contributes to
prostitution and drug addiction.
   Unlike South Koreans, who face an enemy to the north, Filipinos
generally perceive no external military threat. Therefore, U.S.
arguments that the bases are essential for national and regional
defense carry little weight here.
   Last year, Mrs. Aquino noted to foreign reporters that the
presence of U.S. troops failed to deter Japan from invading in 1941
and doubtless encouraged the attack.
   Filipinos consider the bases a business deal _ renting territory
in return for cash _ and say ``failure'' to pay constitutes a
breach of contract.
   The need to ``stand up to the Americans'' was made more urgent
by U.S. intervention in the December coup attempt. U.S. warplanes
from Clark flew air cover for government forces, and their
intervention was widely seen as decisive in defeating the uprising.
   But the intervention also encouraged a belief that Mrs. Aquino
owes her political survival to the Americans and will ultimately
agree to extend the bases at terms favorable to the United States.
   Last January, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State David
Lambertson said the ``danger of a new coup attempt exists'' and
that corruption ``remains a real problem in the Philippines.''
   Some Filipino officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
believe such statements are a pressure tactic to force the
government to accept an unfavorable bases agreement.
   Officials here are deeply sensitive about such statements from
Washington because they recall the buildup of criticism of the
Marcos administration, culminating in the United States abandoning
its longtime ally in favor of Mrs. Aquino.
   U.S. diplomats here, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
fear that the current spate of criticism from Washington may
actually encourage military dissidents to try another coup. They
reason that coup plotters might be led to believe that Washington
would not intervene again, in an effort to convince the Philippines
of the bases' value.

   President Bush and West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl held talks Saturday to discuss the Polish border
question and German reunification.
   Kohl spent the weekend with Bush at the president's snow-swept
retreat at Camp David.
   During three hours of talks Saturday afternoon, Kohl discussed
with Bush ways to approach the problem of Polish borders, West
German spokesman Dieter Vogel told reporters.
   The two leaders were meeting again after dinner on Saturday and
then resuming their talks after attending church on Sunday, he said.
   Kohl reiterated his assertion that only a reunified Germany
could give a final guarantee to Poland that the border question is
closed, Vogel said.
   Poland is worried about demands by some German conservatives
that Germany be allowed to retake territory that was within German
borders until it was transferred to Poland by the World War II
victors.
   But Vogel said Kohl suggested a number of ways in which the two
German states could reassure Poles in the meantime, including talks
with the Polish government or a joint declaration.
   During three hours of talks Saturday afternoon, Bush and Kohl
also discussed a range of issues affecting reunification, Vogel
said.
   The two leaders were joined by close advisers, and the American
side said the two German states should begin soon to consult with
the four powers as they make progress in their reunification talks
in parallel consultations before the formal two-plus-four talks
begin, he said.
   Vogel said Bush told Kohl of his assessment of developments in
Soviet-American relations and arms-reduction talks.
   The president stressed that the West should support Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev's attempts to change the Soviet Union,
Vogel said.
   ``I view this as a very important discussion,'' Bush said as he
walked out to meet Kohl, who arrived by helicopter from
Washington-Dulles International Airport in Virginia. ``There's a
lot of keen interest, not just in Europe but around the world on
these discussions we're going to have.''
   Bush declined to answer reporters' questions about the substance
of the talks, noting he and Kohl would hold a news conference on
Sunday morning before Kohl's return to Germany.
   Bush, bundled up against the icy morning air in a leather
flier's jacket and gloves, greeted Kohl and his wife at the landing
pad with a hearty, ``Welcome, wlcome.''
   ``Wunderbar (wonderful),'' replied Kohl, who was dressed in a
business suit with no coat.
   ``In this time of dramatic change, German-American ties are of
essential significance,'' Kohl said through a translator.
   Bush hustled the West German into a golf cart to drive to the
Camp David living quarters, while Barbara Bush took the wheel of a
second cart and chauffeured Mrs. Hannelore Kohl.
   The two leaders were discussing ``the full range of issues
related to changes in Eastern Europe,'' according to White House
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Coming at this volatile juncture, their talks at Camp David were
seen as critical in making sure the two allies are together, a
German official said.
   In addition, the Kohl visit was considered an important symbol
of close ties between the two governments, three weeks before East
Germany holds an election that is to precede reunification talks.
   Kohl himself faces election in West Germany next Dec. 2, against
stiff opposition from the Social Democrats.
   While Kohl has agreed with Bush that a reunified Germany should
remain a member of NATO and NATO troops should remain in West
Germany, the Social Democrats contend there will be no need for
NATO if the Warsaw Pact continues to diminish in importance.
   The Soviet Foreign Ministry's policy-making body on Saturday
added another facet to the issue by ruling out NATO membership for
a unified Germany.
   Membership in NATO for a reunified Germany would lead to an
``impermissible violation of the military-strategic balance,'' the
Foreign Ministry Collegium said in a statement issued by the
official Tass news agency.
   Kohl recently created some uneasiness in Washington with his
suggestion that the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe, a 35-nation pact that includes the United States, oversee
NATO troop deployments and reductions, effectively superseding NATO
itself.
   Agreement to unify the two Germanys was reached earlier this
month in Ottawa during talks between East and West Germany and the
four World War II victors that divided them: the United States,
France, Britain and the Soviet Union.
   Joining Bush for this weekend's talks were Baker and national
security adviser Brent Scowcroft.

   Leftist guerrillas released two
Americans on Saturday, 10 days after they were kidnapped to protest
the visit of President Bush to Colombia for an anti-drug summit.
   James Donnelly of Detroit and David Kent of Indianapolis were
released to a Colombian human rights group in a village in a remote
part of the Andes mountains in northwestern Colombia.
   The rebels gave Donnelly a message for the Colombian government
that said ``the country's rich people will be punished if any more
guerrillas disappear or if there are any more massacres of
peasants.''
   Right-wing death squads have killed more than 1,000 people in
the last four years, many of them peasants who apparently were
suspected to be guerrilla supporters.
   Donnelly, in a live broadcast interview, said he was treated
well by the rebels.
   Kent was taken to a hospital in the northwestern city of
Medellin for treatment of hepatitis, the Colombian radio network
RCN said.
   He fell ill after being kidnapped, and the guerrillas brought a
doctor to their mountain hideout to treat him, RCN said, quoting
sources with Colombia's Human Rights Committee.
   The two Americans were released in the village of Cocorna, about
35 miles south of Medellin, RCN said.
   National Liberation Army guerrillas claimed responsibility for
kidnapping the two Feb. 13 in Medellin.
   Donnelly said in the interview with RCN that he was abducted by
15 men in cars and trucks.
   ``They treated me well. They gave me good meals,'' Donnelly said
in Spanish. ``They said they didn't have any problems with the
American people, but just with some parts of the U.S. government
that is intervening in Colombia.''
   Donnelly, 65, said he has lived in Colombia for 20 years and is
married to a Colombian. He said he and Kent, kidnapped spearately,
were taken to the mountain hideout the same day they were abducted.
   Kent, 40, is a teacher at a Medellin school.
   The were kidnapped three days before President Bush met in
Cartagena with three Latin America presidents for an anti-drug
summit.
   The three other presidents _ Virgilio Barco of Colombia, Alan
Garcia of Peru, and Jaime Paz of Bolivia _ promised to continue
fighting drug traffickers, who are sometimes allied with guerrillas.
   The National Liberation Army is commanded by a former Roman
Catholic priest, Manuel Perez of Spain. Several other priests are
believed to be members of the organization, which was founded in
the 1970s by another priest, Camilo Torres. He was later killed in
a battle with the army.
   The group has become the most active of Colombia's six guerrilla
groups.
   It kidnapped an American priest, Francis Amico Ferarri, on Feb.
15 in the eastern city of Cali to protest the Bush visit. He was
released Feb. 19.

<TEXT>
   This weekend the airplane becomes one more
no-smoking zone.
   Beginning Sunday, smokers must contend with a ban effective on
all domestic flights and trips to Alaska and Hawaii lasting six
hours or less. The ``no smoking'' signs will be turned on
permanently on 99.8 percent of daily domestic flights.
   ``I would probably go into the bathroom and smoke a cigarette,''
said New York stockbroker Art Lehne, who has smoked for 32 of his
55 years.
   Tampering with an automatic smoke detector is a federal offense
punishable with a $2,000 fine. Lehne already has been arrested and
fined $40 for defiantly lighting up on non-smoking commuter trains
to New York.
   Lehne's willingness to break the law shows how much the tables
have turned.
   Where non-smokers trying to avoid secondhand smoke once were
forced to move, smokers now must contend with a shrinking group of
permissible spaces in which to continue their habit.
   Airport terminals and Amtrak trains may not be far behind,
according to the authors of the ban, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.,
and Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill.
   Anti-smoking initiatives are taking on new life in President
Bush's Cabinet. Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan
on Friday asked athletic associations to reject sponsorships by
tobacco companies. Sullivan also has attacked cigarette makers for
targeting advertising on minorities, women and the young.
   The airline smoking law, an extension of the two-hour ban the
senator and congressman won at the end of 1987, exempts flights
abroad and those longer than six hours headed to Alaska and Hawaii.
   ``The result we think will be happier, healthier airline
customers and a safer, healthier workplace for airline employees,''
Lautenberg said.
   But Dan Lauria, a spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, said he
could barely keep up with telephone calls from irate smokers
accusing the tobacco lobbying group of abandoning them.
   ``They're miserable,'' Lauria said of the smoking public. ``We
are telling the people the law is the law. We're telling people not
to smoke in the (airliner's) bathroom. It's dangerous to the
plane.''
   Lautenberg, Durbin and a host of health organizations say the
ban will protect passengers and flight crews from gases and smoke
particles recirculated in cabin air.
   ``A new report just issued by the Department of Transportation
proves once again that our concerns were well-founded; that study
found that long-term exposure to tobacco smoke in airplanes
represents a significant risk of premature death,'' Lautenberg said.
   The study found 12-15 premature cancer deaths among every
100,000 cabin crew members breathing cabin air.
   ``That's a risk that no one should have to take,'' he said,
although tobacco interests dispute the findings.
   Non-smoking frequent fliers applaud the measure.
   ``It definitely will be much more comfortable,'' said Kimberly
Smith, a 30-year-old Washington computer consultant who travels on
business several times each month. ``I won't feel as though my
privacy or space is being invaded against my will.''
   She said she particularly would appreciate the change on longer
flights, when even in a non-smoking section, ``after several hours,
the smoke still ends up circulating through the filtration system.''
   Juliette D. Lenoir, national vice president of the Association
of Flight Attendants, said the new policy has been welcomed by the
nation's 90,000 flight attendants.
   ``We received tremendous support nationwide, because flight
attendants and the American public said it is not unreasonable to
demand a healthy workplace and a smoke-free travel environment,''
she said.
   The American Lung Association reported last week that several
airlines will exceed the law. For example, Virgin Atlantic Airways
is offering smokeless flights from New York to London and USAir is
banning smoking on its flights to the Bahamas and Bermuda.
   The association has passed out wallet-sized cards suggesting
ways smokers can ``make it through non-smoking trips with flying
colors.'' They include breathing exercises, stretching, drinking
non-alcoholic and caffeine-free beverages and napping.
   Ahron Leichtman, president of Citizens Against Tobacco Smoke, a
coalition of 100 anti-smoking groups that lobbied for the ban, says
the key is to treat smokers with compassion while safeguarding the
health of non-smoking passengers.
   Airlines have been making some preparations for the change.
   Sara Dornacker, a United Airlines spokeswoman in Chicago, said
the airline has agreed to make refunds or accommodations for
smokers unable to handle long hours on smoke-free planes. By
switching direct flights to flights with interim stops, they can
dash into an airport terminal for a quick cigarette.
   Since Feb. 15, all United arrival announcements have mentioned
the new policy, while information and entertainment guides in seat
pockets also spell out the change.
   At Trans World Airlines in St. Louis, spokesman Jim Faulkner
said pre-boarding announcements since Feb. 14 have included news of
the ban.
   Calls to travel agencies last week indicated no passenger
complaints about the new system.

<HEAD>Sisulu, Mandela to Preach Peace Between Warring Black Groups</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DURBAN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top official in the country's
leading anti-apartheid group said Saturday that fighting with other
black factions is huring efforts to end white rule.
   The official, Walter Sisulu, said newly freed ANC leader Nelson
Mandela would join him at a rally Sunday in Natal province to plead
for peace among warring factions.
   More than 2,500 blacks have died since 1986 in fighting among
supporters of the African National Congress _ or ANC _ members of
the Inkatha political party of Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and
various criminal gangs.
   Sisulu, who is leading the ANC peace delegation into the Zulu
townships around Durban and Pietermaritzburg, said Saturday he
would brief Mandela before the mass rally in an open sports field.
   ``I will leave him in no doubt as to the need to call for an end
to the violence,'' said Sisulu. ``We have a gigantic task in
leading a liberation movement. This distasteful violence, which has
caused so much trouble and pain to our people, is a great obstacle
to our cause in many ways.''
   Nine blacks, the youngest age 12, were buried Saturday in the
eastern Cape province town of Uitenhage as the result of factional
fighting over the past two weeks between ANC supporters and
supporters of the Pan-Africanist Movement. That movement opposes
negotiations with the white government and participation of whites
in the struggle to end apartheid. The ANC has said it will send a
delegation to talk with officials of the white government.
   Raymond Mhlaba, a Mandela co-defendant freed from a life prison
term in October along with Sisulu, signed a peace pact in Uitenhage
last week designed to end the fighting. Funeral speakers urged the
community to put the pact into effect.
   At the Durban news conference Saturday, Sisulu said the ANC is
glad that Inkatha leaders had urged their supporters to attend the
Sunday rally to welcome Mandela.
   The two major groups fighting for political supremacy in the
Natal townships have always had separate rallies, and violence
usually follows when the crowds head home through the opposite
camp's neighborhoods.
   Organizers said they expected 175,000 to 200,000 people at the
rally Sunday.
   Buthelezi reportedly did not plan to attend.
   He was a friend of Mandela's before the founder of the ANC
guerrilla wing went to prison in 1962 for sabotage and plotting to
overthrow the government. Buthelezi consistently called for
Mandela's release from prison during the next 27 years until he was
freed early this month.
   However, Buthelezi opposes sanctions and guerrilla attacks,
which the ANC uses. He has also accused the ANC of using its radio
broadcasts to call for his death and the murder of other Inkatha
leaders.
   Exiled ANC leaders accuse Buthelezi of collaborating with
apartheid by heading the Zulu tribal government.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<TEXT>
   The same fraud, self-dealing, rapid growth,
accounting gimmicks and lax regulation that forced a $166 billion
federal bailout of savings and loans last year also threatens the
insurance industry, a House panel has concluded.
   The Energy and Commerce Committee's investigative panel said in
a report Saturday that the cost of liquidating and paying off the
claims of failed insurance companies now reaches into billions of
dollars.
   While there is no evidence yet of an insurance crisis comparable
to the S&amp;L debacle, the subcommittee said, `the same early warnings
of potential disaster are abundantly evident, as they were five
years ago in the thrift industry.''
   In a 76-page report, the panel said its inquiries into both
insurance and thrift enterprises show that ``a relatively few
crooks, scoundrels and incompetents are capable of bankrupting huge
companies, and possibly an entire industry.''
   The subcommittee spent 18 months investigating four insurance
companies _ now insolvent _ with unpaid claims or other liabilities
totaling more than $5 billion, and the near failure of two other
companies.
   It attributed their problems to rapid expansion, extensive and
complex re-insurance arrangements, underpricing of premiums for
remote but expensive risks, false reports, reckless management,
lack of adequate reserves, fraud and self-dealing.
   ``Ultimately, the public bears the burden through higher
insurance premiums or insurance claims that aren't paid,'' said
Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of both the investigations
panel and its parent committee. ``In some cases, the taxpayer may
have to replenish the guaranteed funds.''
   The four failed companies cited in the report are Mission
Insurance Co. and Transit Casualty Co., both of Los Angeles;
Integrity Insurance Co. of Paramus, N.J., and Anglo-American
Insurance Co. of Dallas.
   All four companies were engaged primarily in commercial
property-casualty insurance, a highly competitive $477 billion
segment of an industry with assets totaling $1.75 trillion.
   ``The driving force was quick profits in the short run, with no
apparent concern for the long-term well-being of the company, its
policyholders, its employees, its re-insurors or the public,'' the
subcommittee said.
   It found that none of the officials responsible for running the
four failed companies has been prosecuted or even cited by state
insurance agencies responsible for regulating the industry.
   State regulators, the subcommittee said, appear bogged down by
jurisdictional restraints, unreliable information, limited
penalties they can impose and an unwillingness to pursue wrondoers.
   It said there is a ``shocking reluctance'' in some states to
deny or withdraw an insurance license unless a person has a legally
proven record of criminal fraud.
   ``As a result, there is not meaningful deterrent to dissuade
those who are inclined or tempted to plunder insurance companies,''
the report said.
   With inadequate reserves, some of the companies were using
premiums from new policies to pay incoming claims ``in the
well-known Ponzi scheme pattern,'' the subcommittee said.
   The report stopped short of recommending a federal takeover of
insurance regulation, a function that was delegated exclusively to
state governments under the 1945 McCarran-Ferguson Act.
   ``But current problems could give rise to reconsidering that
delegation,'' it said.
   Possible federal intervention could include a law empowering
national associations of state regulators of insurance companies to
develop and enforce adequate solvency standards.
   ``Particularly in the aftermath of the savings and loan
catastrophe, Congress must make certain that all insurers are
financially able to pay claims,'' said Rep. Thomas J. Bliley Jr. of
Virginia, the subcommittee's ranking Republican.
   Dingell said the panel would hold two hearings on the report in
March.

<TEXT>
   The Soviets plan to begin
withdrawing their 73,500 soldiers and thousands of tanks and
armored vehicles from Czechoslovakia on Monday.
   The chief of Soviet forces in Czechoslovakia said Saturday that
1,220 Red Army tanks and 2,505 armored vehicles will be withdrawn
as part of the pullout.
   Gen. Eduard Vorobjev released the new details of the program to
reporters at the headquarters of Soviet troops, about 20 miles
northeast of Prague.
   Vorobjev also said 77 combat planes and 146 helicopters would be
withdrawn during the three phases of the pullout, scheduled to end
by 1991.
   The first phase starts Monday in Frenstat pod Radhostem, 110
miles southeast of Prague, and in Krnov, on the Czechoslovak-Polish
border 150 miles east of Prague.
   The Soviet troops in Czechoslovakia were left by the Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact invasion in 1968 to suppress attempts at political
reform.
   However, following Eastern Europe's reforms and Soviet moves to
reduce its overall troop strength, Soviet and Czechoslovak
negotiators agreed Thursday on a total withdrawal from
Czechoslovakia. Hungary is also negotiating for a complete pullout
of Soviet troops from its territiory.

<HEAD>Police: Rumors Link Animal Rights Activists to Dean's Killing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police nationwide were alerted last week
to rumors that militant animal rights activists might be planning
to kill a veterinarian school dean each month for a year,
authorities said.
   Homicide Detective Lt. Larry Johnson of the Knox County
sheriff's office, lead investigator in the Feb. 8 ambush slaying of
University of Tennessee veterinary school dean Dr. Hyram Kitchen,
said the information was released as a precaution only.
   ``We just put out third-hand information,'' Johnson said. ``We
put it out for only one reason: we didn't want to sit on anything.''
   Kitchen, 57, was gunned down outside his home in north Knox
County as he was leaving for a work-related breakfast meeting.
   He was shot eight times with a .22-caliber revolver, twice in
the back of the head.
   The alert was sent nationwide Wednesday on the National Crime
Information Center computer to law enforcement agencies with
veterinary schools in their districts, Johnson said.
   ``Everything in it was unconfirmed,'' he said. ``It was a
`for-what-it's-worth' teletype based on second-, third- and
fourth-hand information.
   He described the information as ``gossip that's come back to
us.''
   He said investigators have no reason to think animal rights
activists are responsible for Kitchen's murder.
   Police have no motive nor suspects in the shooting.
   ``With high-profile people like Dr. Kitchen, there could
possibly be a dozen motives,'' Johnson said.
   ``If they did it, they probably would say so,'' he said,
referring to animal rights activists.

   A sky diver was knocked unconscious during
an 80-person free-fall Saturday and fell to his death after another
diver tried to deployt his chute but couldn't, a sky-diving company
official said.
   Paul Williams, 40, of Kentucky, was one of the last people to
jump from four planes at 15,000 feet when he collided with another
diver and lost consciousness, said Susan Basse, an owner of the
Palatka Paracenter.
   ``Another sky diver, seeing the man flailing in free fall,
attempted to get to him and pull the rip cord, but was unable. To
the best of our knowledge, unfortunately he never regained
consciousness and died on impact,'' Ms. Basse said.
   Williams was part of a group divers from across the southeastern
United States who joined in an 80-person formation.
   ``There's a pretty large concentration of sky divers. We'll
never know exactly what happened, but I believe he just misjudged
his distance from another sky diver,'' Ms. Basse said.
   ``This was an experienced jumper, in excess of 2,600 sky dives.
We're talking a serious jumper who made a mistake. Unfortunately,
it was a fatal mistake,'' she said.
   The man landed on one of the runways at Kay Larkin Airport,
about a half-mile from a crowd of friends and relatives who had
come to see the jump. Ms. Basse said several of Williams' friends
from Kentucky but no family members were there.
   Most of the other divers in the jump continued to join hands and
legs and landed safely after breaking the formation at 4,500 feet.
They probably were unaware that Williams' chutes failed to open,
she said.
   Palatka police, who are investigating the accident, identified
Williams, but refused to release his hometown.

   Heavy, blowing snow created a driver's nightmare in the Midwest
Saturday, contributing to as many as 19 traffic deaths, as a rush
of cold air ended several weeks of unseasonably mild weather from
the Great Lakes to New England.
   In the flood-weary South, more homes were inundated in southern
Mississippi as flood crests moved downstream toward the Gulf of
Mexico.
   Chain-reaction crashes and other traffic accidents in bad
weather killed 13 people in Ohio, nine of them in one pileup on
Interstate 75; three in Illinois; and one each in Michigan, Indiana
and Kentucky. Two people were killed in a snowstorm Friday in New
York state.
   Airline travel to and from Chicago was slowed, with delays of up
to two hours, as wind above 50 mph forced officials to close four
of six runways at O'Hare International Airport for a time, said
Lisa Howard, spokeswoman for the Chicago Department of Aviation. A
number of flights were canceled, she said.
   Nine people were killed Saturday evening and 45 injured in a
fiery chain-reaction crash on I-75 outside Dayton, Ohio. It
involved two tractor-trailer rigs and 16 other vehicles, said
Highway Patrol Cadet Robert Scott.
   Elsewhere in Ohio, one person was killed when a car collided
with a snowplow on U.S. 33 south of Athens, one was killed in a
57-vehicle crash on I-71 in Fayette County and two were killed in a
weather-related crash on I-280 outside Toledo.
   In Illinois, three people were killed and at least seven others
injured in a 15-vehicle pileup on I-80 west of Peru, hospital
officials and state police said. Sgt. Richard Ferguson of the state
police said snow and ice contributed to the crash.
   Hundreds of vehicles were involved in chain-reaction crashes in
blwoing and drifting snow in Michigan. A pileup on I-94 in Berrien
County killed one person; only minor injuries were reported in
three other crashes on I-94 involving at least 130 vehicles in all
and in a 100-vehicle collision on I-75 north of Pontiac.
   In northern Kentucky, at least one person was killed and 21
others injured in a pileup on I-75 near Walton, police said.
   Northern Indiana got as much as a foot of snow Saturday, and
blowing and drifting snow reduced visibility to near zero at times
over much of the state, authorities said. Two sections of I-65 were
closed, while the weather contributed to a pileup of at least 20
vehicles near Greensburg.
   ``We're recommending no travel at all today in the state of
Indiana. It's just extremely bad,'' said Indiana state police Sgt.
Tom Goble. ``We've had a lot of people just drive off the road
because they can't see where they're going.''
   Wind-driven snow also caused hazardous conditions in
southwestern Ohio.
   ``You top a rise where the wind's whipping across the field and
all of a sudden you're looking at a patch of ice and snow two to
three inches thick,'' said Earl Francis, spokesman for the Ohio
Department of Transportation.
   Wind blew at 25 to 35 mph across Ohio, with higher gusts, and
forecasters said the wind chill effect was expected to hit 20 to 30
below zero early Sunday. In Michigan, overnight lows were forecast
at zero in Detroit and as low as 21 below zero in extreme northern
Michigan.
   Overnight lows into Monday morning were expected to range from
zero to 5 above over most of New York state, with temperatures
dipping below zero in the Adirondack Mountains. New York City had a
record high of 62 on Friday; Saturday morning, snow fell and the
temperature was in the low 30s.
   The cold came too late to halt flooding in northern Ohio, where
about 20 homes in a low-lying area of Toledo were flooded early
Saturday by rain-swollen Swan Creek. Authorities said the area
floods periodically, but usually in spring, rather than in late
February.
   In Mississippi, flooding that has plagued the South for a week
continued with new flooding in the southeastern part of the state
as swollen rivers drained toward the Gulf of Mexico.
   Water began seeping into homes in Jackson County early Saturday
and officials warned dozens more homeowners to prepare for high
water from the Pascagoula River.
   ``When we went to bed it was right at the bottom of the back
door, so we knew it was coming in,'' Harold Morris, who lives in
the River Bend area of Escatawpa, Miss., said early Saturday. ``We
got a couple of inches downstairs.''
   In Alabama, the National Weather Service said rivers were
receding Saturday. The Coosa River had dropped to two feet above
flood stage at Gadsden and Childersburg and was below flood stage
near Montgomery.

   Malcolm Forbes, colorful owner of the business
magazine that bears his name and an unabashed salesman for
capitalism, died of a heart attack at his home Saturday. He was 70.
   He was pronounced dead of a heart attack at 4:30 p.m. at
Timberfield, his home in Far Hills, N.J., where he died in his
sleep, said William Donald Garson, director of corporate
communications for New York-based Forbes Inc.
   He was found by a houseman after failing to keep a doctor's
appointment, Garson said.
   Forbes, whose frequent forays on Harley-Davidson motorcycles and
hot-air balloons made him a symbol of capitalist machismo, had
returned Saturday morning from a trip to London.
   Often seen with longtime friend Elizabeth Taylor, Forbes
appeared in newspaper celebrity columns as often as on their
business pages.
   ``Forbes was the Babe Ruth of business publishing,'' said George
Steinbrenner, principal owner of the New York Yankees. ``He made
his mark through integrity, a toughness and wonderful sense of
humor. We'll miss him.''
   Billionaire developer Donald Trump expressed shock at the death
of his friend.
   ``Malcolm was an extraordinarily positive force in America's
business and social life. His loss takes excitement, creativity and
genuine business leadership from every American businessman,''
Trump said.
   Lee Iacocca, chairman of Chrysler Corp., said: ``Malcolm Forbes
was someone who lived life to its fullest and in doing so made all
of our lives a little more colorful. He was a great businessman,
publisher and collector, but more importantly, a great friend to
many. We will miss him deeply.''
   In Los Angeles, industrialist Armand Hammer released a statement
saying: ``The whole world will miss Malcolm, who brought humanity
to the capitalist system.''
   Forbes spent a reported $2 million on his 70th birthday party
Aug. 19. He was proclaimed an honorary citizen of Tangier as that
Moroccan bash _ which included seaside fireworks and nightlong
dancing _ drew to a close on Aug. 21.
   The nearly 1,000 guests featured some of the top names in
business, industry, entertainment and the arts. They feasted on
pigeon pie, lamb mechoui and chicken tadjine.
   Chairman and chief shareholder of Forbes Inc., Forbes's worth
has been estimated at $400 million up to $1 billion by various
sources.
   Experts value his company's flagship business magazine as high
as $600 million, while its American Heritage magazine, suburban
newspaper, real estate and art holdings almost add $100 million or
more.
   Forbes magazine rode the 1980s bull market and the pro-business
Reagan era to the greatest success since its founding by Forbes'
father.
   Since 1979, the amount of advertising space sold surged 50
percent while rates rose sharply, as biweekly Forbes pulled ahead
of Fortune in ad space and gained ground on Business Week, which
publishes more often than its two main competitors.
   According to Publishers Information Bureau reports, all three
big business magazines will post record ad revenue this year.
   Forbes made the first free flight over Beijing in a hot-air
balloon and set six world ballooning records. He rode his Harleys
in numerous charity events, and made the first motorcycle tour of
China.
   Miss Taylor had been his frequent companion since his 39-year
marriage ended in divorce in 1985.
   His ex-wife, the former Roberta Laidlaw, spends much of her time
at her Wyoming ranch and plays no role in the Forbes business.
   On Dec. 31, a Los Angeles Times story reported that Forbes' son,
Steve, would inherit 51 percent of the voting control of the Forbes
empire.
   But along with that, the son might also inherit a potential tax
nightmare, the paper reported. State and federal taxes on big
estates are levied at about 55 percent and the 1987 tax reform
closed loopholes that had eased the burden on family businesses.
   The estate tax threat has shadowed Forbes Inc. through its best
years, since Forbes magazine's big increase in value came
relatively late in Malcolm's life.
   While Forbes family members declined to discuss with the Times
their estate tax plans in detail, it is clear that their business
strategy had been constrained by the prospect of a tax bill that
could exceed $300 million.
   Forbes was born in Englewood, N.J., on Aug. 19, 1919, two years
after his father founded the magazine. He was the third child of
five born to B.C. ``Bertie'' and Adelaide Forbes.
   His father, named after Prince Albert of Great Britain, was the
son of a poor Scottish family who emigrated to the United States
and worked his way to affluence on Wall Street.
   In 1941, the newly graduated Malcolm Forbes was appointed
publisher of a weekly newspaper in Lancaster, Ohio, and within a
year had founded a second paper.
   But in 1942, he entered the Army as a private. During service in
Europe, Forbes fought as a staff sergeant commanding a machine-gun
unit and eventually won the Bronze Star and a Purple Heart for
saving the lives of many of his company.
   Forbes was shot in the thigh and spent 10 months in 1944-45
recovering.
   Following the war, Forbes joined his father's magazine as a vice
president with a broad mandate to modernize the journal's design
and layout.
   Forbes entered politics in 1949 by gaining a seat on the Borough
Council in Bernardsville, N.J. He served in the state Senate from
1951 to 1957 and ran for governor of New Jersey in 1957 on the
Republican ticket, with a ``No state income tax, no state sales
tax'' platform. He lost Robert B. Meyner.
   At 38, having lost his bid for the Statehouse, Forbes took over
as editor-in-chief of the magazine.
   He also was the author of seven books, including ``They Went
That-a-way'' which spent five weeks on the best-seller list.
   In addition to his former wife, Roberta, survivors include sons
Malcolm ``Steve'' Jr., Robert, Christopher and Timothy, a daughter,
Moira Mumma, a brother, Wallace and eight grandchildren.

   A man convicted of killing 27 people in
the nation's worst drunken-driving accident was sentenced Friday to
16 years in prison. He could be eligible for parole in eight years.
   Carroll County Circuit Judge Charles Satterwhite denied a
defense motion to place Larry Mahoney on probation, and instead
imposed the sentence recommended by the jury that convicted Mahoney
on Dec. 21.
   Satterwhite said the community would not stand for probation and
that punishment must be strong for such a serious crime.
   One survivor of the crash, 18-year-old Tammy Darnell, said
Mahoney should have been sent to prison for life.
   ``Sixteen years does not take the place of the friends I lost,''
she said, before breaking down in tears.
   Mahoney, a 36-year-old chemical plant worker, was driving the
wrong direction on Interstate 71 on May 14, 1988, when he crashed
into the front of a school bus packed with teen-agers on a church
outing. Twenty-four teens and three adults died.
   He was convicted of 27 counts each of second-degree manslaughter
and first-degree wanton endangerment, 12 counts of first-degree
assault, 14 of second-degree wanton endangerment and one of drunken
driving.
   The recommended sentence totaled 611 years, but the jury said
the terms should run concurrently. That effectively gave Mahoney 16
years. He is classified as a violent offender under Kentucky law
and must serve at least half his sentence before being considered
for parole.
   Defense attorney William Summers urged Satterwhite to make
something positive out of the bus crash tragedy. The defense
recommended a probation plan under which Mahoney would have
lectured to schoolchildren about the dangers of drunken driving,
served volunteer time in hospital emergency wards, and spent one
year in a work release program.
   ``Judge, we must do as much good with this as we possibly can.
His punishment has already been death. He already has been given a
life sentence,'' Summers said, referring to Mahoney's suffering
since the crash.
   Prosecutor Paul Richwalsky Jr. of the state attorney general's
office vehemently opposed probation.
   ``He alone is responsible. He alone brought us to this place
today,'' Richwalsky said. ``Regardless of statements the defense
would make, it's time for punishment.''
   Russell Baldani, one of Mahoney's three attorneys, said earlier
this week that Satterwhite's decision would be appealed.
   During testimony, jurors learned Mahoney was upset over
financial problems brought on by expensive medical bills for his
daughter, who suffers from a spinal birth defect, and that he spent
most of the day of the crash visiting friends and drinking beer at
several taverns.
   He testified that he only occasionally drank beer and abhorred
hard liquor. He said he didn't remember drinking hard liquor at a
party later that evening.
   He said he had no recollection of getting into his pickup and
driving the wrong way on the interstate. The collision punctured
the gas tank of the bus, sending a stream of flaming gasoline into
the passenger compartment.
   The 27 deaths were attributed to smoke inhalation, but Mahoney's
attorneys contended that toxic smoke emitted from the plastic seats
had poisoned the passengers.
   When Mahoney took the stand, he publicly apologized for the
tragedy.
   Richwalsky said earlier this week that he didn't expect Friday's
hearing to be the last of the Mahoney case.
   ``It's not over and done with,'' he said. ``I'm sure there will
be an appeal and so we change gears and go into another arena.''

<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 100 militant students
demanding the downfall of the government moved into the capital's
Roman Catholic cathedral Friday and refused to leave when armed
police surrounded the church.
   Cathedral officials asked the students to leave and promised to
negotiate their safe getaway, but the protesters said they feared
soldiers and police would beat them.
   The students, numbering about 150, chose the cathedral to win
publicity for their protests.
   The state-run media have ignored the anti-government protests
that began Monday night when students set two cars ablaze and
police responded with tear gas and rubber truncheons.
   Several students have been injured in clashes with soldiers and
police, but only a handful needed hospital treatment, the students
say. There was no violence Thursday.
   About two dozen armed police marched through a cathedral gate
and surrounded the modern building decorated with large stained
glass doors and windows. But they were ordered out after a more
senior officer arrived on the scene.
   There appeared to be a standoff later Friday, with police
remaining outside the gates and students refusing to leave.
   Dozens of other students opposite the cathedral raised their
fists at the soldiers. A few yelled what has become a rallying cry:
``We are opposed!''
   President Felix Houphouet-Boigny has ruled this West African
nation as a one-party state since its independence from France in
1960. He has refused recent calls for a multiparty system, saying
it would endanger national unity.
   ``We don't want Houphouet, we don't want his government,'' one
student protester said Friday. ``We will demonstrate until we have
a multiparty state. We want freedom.''
   Earlier in the day, student leaders announced formation of an
independent National Organization of Students and School Children
to replace another union. The existing group is in effect a youth
league of the ruling Democratic Party.
   The students claimed they have the support of 7,000 of the
22,000 students at the state-run National University of Ivory Coast.
   However, demonstrations have been limited to little more than
300 students at a time. The students say the low numbers reflect
cuts in bus service between the university and surrounding
neighborhoods.

<HEAD>SEC Nominee: Junk Bond Market Bears Watching in Wake of Drexel</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: ADDS 4 grafs on congressional investigations</NOTE>

   The Securities and Exchange Commission should
keep tabs on the amount of junk bonds held by financial
institutions in the wake of the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert
Group Inc., an SEC nominee said Friday.
   Philip R. Lochner Jr., deputy general counsel of Time Warner
Inc., also told a Senate panel that there might be a need for a
national quotation system, such as the one used to monitor the
over-the-counter stock market, to keep track of junk-bond prices.
   ``We absolutely do need more information on this issue,''
Lochner said at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking,
Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Group, parent of the Wall Street
investment banking house that practically created the high risk,
high yield ``junk bond'' market, filed for federal bankruptcy
protection earlier this month, rattling the already unstable market.
   Committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., asked Lochner
if the SEC should assemble information on what kind of financial
institutions _ such as banks, thrifts, mutual and pension funds _
hold junk bonds and in what amount.
   ``I think there's no systematic information on who holds junk
debt and how long it's been held,'' Lochner said. ``I think in
order to understand it better I think, yes, we absolutely do need
more information.''
   Riegle was the only senator present during most of the
questioning of Lochner, nominated by President Bush in January to
fill the unexpired term of former SEC Chairman David Ruder, who
returned to teaching law at Northwestern University.
   Lochner expressed views similar to SEC Chairman Richard C.
Breeden, saying that enforcement of securities laws would be a high
priority for him, particularly in an attempt to restore the
confidence of individual investors.
   Lochner also said jurisdictional disputes between the SEC and
the rival Commodity Futures Trading Commission were hurting
American competitiveness with overseas markets.
   The panel also questioned Arthur J. Hill, nominee for president
of the Government National Mortgage Association, also known as
Ginnie Mae, and John J. Adair, who was nominated this week as the
first inspector general of the Resolution Trust Corp.
   The RTC was established as part of the savings and loan industry
bailout legislation to dispose of failed thrifts.
   Riegle said the committee was expected to vote on all three
nominees next Friday.
   The committee also has scheduled a hearing for next Friday on
the downfall of Drexel, with Securities and Exchange Commission
Chairman Richard C. Breeden scheduled to testify.
   In addition, Rep. John D. Dingell, chairman of the House Energy
and Commerce Committee has asked the SEC to supply all the
information it has on hefty bonuses Drexel paid to employees before
its bankruptcy filing on Feb. 13.
   Dingell, in his capacity as chairman of the oversight and
investigations subcommittee, asked the SEC to ``provide the
subcommittee with the commission's analysis of these payments in
relation to violations of both the letter and spirit of the
applicable provisions of the federal securities laws.''
   The subcommittee also asked the SEC to deliver by March 16 ``a
copy of Drexel's bankruptcy contingency plan, and copies of any
minutes, transcripts or other memorializations of any board of
directors meetings where any such plan was discussed or approved.''

<HEAD>Bush Says Still Some Concern Over Soviet Arms Violations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush said Friday that the Soviet
Union had taken ``encouraging and significant'' steps to correct
violations of arms control agreements, but added that serious
concerns remain.
   ``During the past year, there has been an encouraging change in
the Soviet approach toward arms-control compliance,'' Bush said in
a report to Congress. ``The Soviet Union now appears to be willing
to take significant action to resolve some U.S. concerns.''
   Bush said he hoped recent Soviet actions ``indicate a new
willingness also to address and resolve our remaining concerns.''
   While highlighting positive action, Bush said the Soviet Union
still did not comply completely with the 1972 Antiballistic Missile
Treaty and the 1972 biological and toxin weapons convention.
   Bush noted last year's admission by the Kremlin that its massive
radar complex at Krasnoyarsk was a ``clear violation'' of the ABM
treaty, as the United States had long argued.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze pledged last year
that the facility would be dismantled.
   Bush said in his report that action would ``improve the
atmosphere surrounding bilateral relations,'' emphasizing that the
United States will not conclude agreements on strategic or space
weapons until concerns about Krasnoyarsk are resolved.
   Bush credited the Soviet Union with ``constructive steps'' to
correct other violations of the ABM treaty even though they had not
formally admitted they were not complying.
   On another front, Bush said the Soviet Union had admitted
technical errors in complying with a 1987 treaty to eliminate
intermediate-range nuclear missiles and had corrected them.
   ``During the past year,'' Bush said, ``our insistence on
scrupulous complaince, together with improved cooperation by the
USSR, has enabled generally successful implementation of the INF
treaty, the removal of one ABM treaty violation and positive
movement toward Soviet correction of the Krasnoyarsk radar
violation.
   ``This represents encouraging and significant positive movement
in arms control treaty compliance,'' the president said.
   In terms of chemical and biological warfare, Bush said the
United States had found no basis for amending earlier conclusions
that the Soviet Union was been involved in the production, transfer
and use of toxins for hostile purposes in Laos, Cambodia and
Afghanistan.
   He said there was no confirmed evidence of use of lethal agents
since January 1984, but said the alleged violations remained a
cause for serious concern.
   Moreover, Bush said that contrary to Moscow's claims, ``the
Soviet Union has maintained an active offensive biological warfare
program and capability in violation of the 1972 biological and
toxin weapons convention.''
   ``We judge that the Soviet capability may include advanced
biological and toxin agents of which we have little or no knowledge
and, and against which the U.S. has no defense,'' Bush said.

<HEAD>Air Force Cites Faulty Pump as Likely Cause of In-Air Explosion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A faulty fuel pump apparently caused an
Air Force tanker jet to explode in flight last fall, killing four
crewmen, military investigators said Friday.
   Officials at Loring Air Force Base said they determined that
there were two explosions, both in a fuel tank area in the rear of
the plane, and that the tail section separated from the fuselage
after the second blast.
   ``Post-accident analysis of the air refueling pumps recovered
from the crash site indicates one of two pumps ... was a likely
ignition source,'' said a statement issued by the base.
   The pump reached a temperature of at least 1,435 degrees before
the explosion, which occurred over the Canadian town of
Perth-Andover, New Brunswick, on the morning of Oct. 4.
   Residents of the area had reported that the explosion lit up the
predawn sky and started a fire in the woods where the wreckage
landed.
   The KC-135A plane, which was 25 years old, was a Boeing 707
reconfigured as a tanker. It was used in the midair refueling of
fighters and bombers based at Loring.
   The Air Force, releasing the first detailed account of the
events leading to the explosion, said the four-engine jet took off
from Loring at 11:40 p.m. the previous night and had completed a
midair refueling of two planes east of Newfoundland. It was
returning to Loring, descending from 3,000 feet to 2,500 feet, when
it exploded about 13 miles south-southeast of the base.
   The investigation turned up no discrepancies in the maintenance
of the plane. The crew members were technically qualified and
toxicology tests ``disclosed no evidence pertinent to the
investigation,'' the investigators said.

   Pioneer 11, the first spacecraft to visit
Saturn, flew beyond the orbit of Neptune on Friday and became the
fourth human-made craft to exit the solar system, NASA and the
probe's builder said.
   ``We wish it a fond farewell,'' said Montye Male, a spokeswoman
for TRW Inc., which built Pioneer 11 at its Space &amp; Technology
Group facility in Redondo Beach.
   Neptune is now the outermost planet. Pluto currently is closer
to the sun in an elongated, elliptical orbit, part of which is
beyond Neptune's path.
   By crossing Neptune's orbit Friday at a distance of 2.8 billion
miles from Earth, Pioneer 11 followed Pioneer 10 and Voyagers 1 and
2 out of the solar system, said Peter Waller, spokesman for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ames Research
Center in Mountain View.
   Both officials acknowledged that some don't consider the orbit
of the outermost planet to be the edge of the solar system. Some
scientists consider the true edge to be the heliopause, where solar
wind yields to interstellar wind an estimated 5 billion to 14
billion miles from the sun.
   A few even consider the solar system to end at the Oort Cloud, a
theorized but yet-unseen spherical cloud of comets that may be
located about 7 trillion to 14 trillion miles from the sun.
   Waller said NASA considers the Pioneers and Voyagers to be
outside the solar system because _ to use a seafaring analogy _
``once you've left land behind, you don't worry about coastal
waters.''
   Pioneer 11 was launched April 5, 1973, and visited Jupiter on
Dec. 2, 1974, a year after Pioneer 10 flew past the solar system's
largest planet. Pioneer 11 whizzed by Jupiter at 107,373 mph, which
Waller said was the fastest speed ever traveled by a spacecraft.
   It passed only 26,600 miles from Jupiter's cloud tops _ much
closer than the Voyager 1 and 2 flybys in 1979 _ and was bombarded
by the planet's intense radiation belts.
   On Sept. 1, 1979, it became the first spacecraft to explore
Saturn, visiting the ringed planet 14 months ahead of Voyager 1 and
two years ahead of Voyager 2. Pioneer 10 didn't fly past Saturn.
   Waller said in a telephone interview that Pioneer 11 flew about
13,000 miles from Saturn, taking the first closeup pictures of that
planet, discovering two small moonlets and a ring, and collecting
data that scientists used to determine that the major moon, Titan,
was too cold for life despite the presence of organic chemicals.
   Although Pioneer 11 was launched four years before the Voyagers,
it took longer to fly beyond the outermost planet's orbit because
it is traveling through space in the same direction as the sun and
the rest of the solar system, Male said.
   In June 1983, Pioneer 10 became the first spacecraft to pass
beyond the planets. It is now 4.5 billion miles from Earth, Male
said.
   In three years, it will become difficult to simultaneously
operate Pioneer 11's radio transmitter and scientific instruments,
although engineers may be able to get the spacecraft to send back
data on solar wind until 1995, project manager Richard Fimmel said.
   Pioneer 10, with a stronger power supply, may return information
through the year 2000.

<HEAD>Vermont Governor's Press Secretary Resigns Over Lewd Remark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Madeleine Kunin's press secretary
resigned Friday for making a lewd comment to a reporter.
   ``I deeply regret the fact that I failed to perform according to
the standards required,'' Peter Freyne wrote in his letter of
resignation to the governor.
   The resignation came two days after Kunin suspended Freyne
without pay for two weeks and three days after Freyne made the
comment, which he said was a joke.
   The remark was made to Betsy Liley, a reporter for The
Burlington Free Press, who asked him for a preview of the
governor's revenue forecast. Freyne replied, ``If you took off all
your clothes and (performed a lewd act) I might tell you.''
   He paused, then added: ``Even if you did that, I wouldn't tell
you.''
   On Tuesday, Kunin called the remark ``totally inappropriate,''
adding that it was sexist but she didn't consider Freyne to be
sexist.
   She issued a statement Friday saying she accepted Freyne's
resignation with sadness and regret.
   ``Peter has made the right decision,'' Kunin said. ``Despite his
deep remorse, he has recognized that he has lost his capacity to be
a spokesman for me.''

   A man accused of strangling and decapitating
his brother's girlfriend was convicted of murder Friday after
witnesses described the 18-year-old defendant singing rap songs
about the killing.
   Ruben Deases was found guilty in the May 28 murder of Jennifer
Ann Gardner, 20, capping a trial that at one point erupted into a
scuffle between brothers.
   Defense attorney Glenn Sedgwick put his arm around Deases as the
verdict was read. Deases showed little emotion at the verdict,
which the jury reached after about two hours and 15 minutes of
deliberations.
   In Iowa, a conviction on first-degree murder carries a mandatory
life sentence with no possiblity of parole unless a governor
commutes the sentence to a set term.
   The state's key witness was Deases' 16-year-old brother, Johnny,
who testified about the killing and said Ruben had sex with the
corpse afterward. A third brother, Edward, 21, awaits trial on
murder charges.
   The woman shared an Ames apartment with the eldest of the four
brothers, Eustaquio Deases, 23, who was out of town at the time of
the killing took place in the apartment.
   Prosecutors said she died because of the younger brothers saw
her as an impediment to their advancement in Eustaquio's
cocaine-dealing business, and witnesses said it took place soon
after she threatened the younger brothers with a gun.
   Eustaquio is serving a five-year federal sentence for cocaine
possession.
   Four youth workers testified that Ruben bragged about the
killing after his arrest and even made up rap songs about it.
   One such song included the lines, ``She thought she was cool,
and I was a fool. And now she's dead and I'm ahead,'' said Jack
Leinen, a former youth services worker at a Des Moines detention
center where Ruben was held.
   Judge M.D. Seiser had told jurors they could return a verdict of
innocent or of guilty to charges of first-degree murder,
second-degree murder or voluntary manslaughter. No sentencing date
was sent.
   Ms. Gardner's head was found in a ditch along a gravel road
south of Ames on May 29, and her body was found June 1 in a lake
north of Ames.
   Defense lawyer Stephen Terrill said he would appeal.
   As Eustaquio was led into the courtroom last week to testify for
the prosecution, he lunged across the defense table, throwing
punches and snarling obscenities at Ruben.
   Terrill had portrayed Ruben Deases as a frightened little boy
who didn't take part in the killing or the decapitation.
   ``I'm afraid that Ruben Deases may end up paying for a crime he
did not commit _ a terrible crime that his brother Edward
committed,'' Terrill told jurors in his closing arguments Thursday.
   But County Attorney Mary Richards had called Ruben ``a
cold-blooded killer'' and told jurors that ``reading at a
fifth-grade level is no excuse for committing murder.''

<DATELINE>LEIPZIG, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German opposition leaders
joined the East German Social Democrats at their convention Friday
to criticize the policies of Helmut Kohl, the West German
chancellor.
   The convention chose Ibrahim Boehme, a 45-year-old historian, to
be the party's chairman and lead it in East Germany's first free
elections March 18.
   The Social Democrats are favored to win the elections and Boehme
could be the next premier of East Germany, which was ruled by
Communists from the Stalinist mold until a few months ago. Several
recent polls have indicated the Social Democrats would win at least
50 percent of the vote.
   As the convention began in the industrial city of Leipzig,
former Chancellor Willy Brandt started his weekend of East German
campaigning with a rally in Plauen, a southern city.
   He told an audience of 40,000: ``As Germans and as Europeans, we
must cooperate in securing world peace.''
   West German politicians, including Kohl, have taken advantage of
the election campaign to speak at rallies across the country,
despite misgivings by the Communist-led interim government.
   While lending support to sister parties in East Germany, the
West Germans also are seeking to establish power bases before
reunification.
   Speakers from West Germany often have overshadowed East German
party leaders, making some campaign rallies seem like forums on
West German political issues.
   Earlier this week, Kohl addressed a rally of 100,000 in Erfurt
and received a more enthusiastic reception that he usually gets
back home.
   National elections in West Germany are scheduled for December,
and with the movement toward reunification gaining speed, some West
German politicians think it could become an all-German ballot.
   The left-leaning Social Democrats of West Germany accuse Kohl of
rushing into unification in hopes of boosting his re-election
chances by becoming the chancellor who reunites Germany.
   They want one Germany, but favor what they describe as a more
cautious pace in accomplishing it. Their East German sister party
is a strong advocate of reunification.
   Included in the West German delegation to the convention of East
German Social Democrats on Friday was Oskar Lafontaine, the
Saarland state governor who is expected to be the party's
challenger to Kohl in December.
   Brandt, who is very popular in East Germany, also will speak at
the Leipzig convention, which continues through Sunday. He is to be
made honorary chairman of the East German Social Democrats, the
same title he has in West Germany.
   Lafontaine's convention speech criticized Kohl for not giving
billions of dollars in immediate aid.
   East Germany requested $9 billion, but Kohl balked at providing
it to a Communist-led interim government. West Germany did provide
the equivalent of about $3.5 billion, most of it for projects over
which the East German government would have little control.
   Speaking to about 500 delegates, Lafontaine said Kohl's decision
was a ``blow to Germany unity.''
   He also criticized Kohl for calling 1989 the ``year of the
Germans.'' It was much more a year of ``freedom and liberation of
the people of Eastern Europe,'' he said.

<HEAD>Two Secret Service Agents Slightly Wounded in Counterfeit Raid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Secret Service agents were slightly
wounded and an alleged counterfeit money dealer was badly injured
during a raid that netted nearly $500,000 in bogus bills, officials
said Friday.
   Details were kept secret of the undercover investigation that
erupted in gunfire Thursday night, but the Secret Service confirmed
two of its agents suffered minor gunshot wounds in the raid at a
Los Angeles County residence.
   The identities of the agents were not released. Dick Griffin,
special agent in charge of the Secret Service office in Los
Angeles, said one was a 37-year-old man and the other a 30-year-old
woman.
   Also injured was Ignacio Padilla, 44, who suffered chest and hip
wounds and was in critical condition Friday at Martin Luther King
Jr.-Drew Medical Center, county sheriff's Deputy Van Mosely said.
Padilla lives in Los Angeles, Mosely said.
   A second man, Oliveros Orosco, 26, also of Los Angeles was not
harmed. He was arrested for investigation of attempted murder,
Mosely said.
   Griffin said the probe comes amid an extraordinary concentration
of counterfeiting activities in Los Angeles.
   ``At this point they were just people who came to our attention
as dealers,'' he said. ``In the overall scheme of things ...
counterfeiting in Los Angeles has been something that we've
experienced quite a bit of in the last two years.''
   It was not clear who fired the shots that wounded the three.
   One agent suffered a superficial leg wound and was treated and
released from a hospital Thursday night, said Griffin. The other
agent suffered broken bones and some nerve damage to a foot and
remained hospitalized.
   Griffin said the undercover agents, backed up by an unspecified
number of other agents and Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies,
were negotiating with the men to purchase about $485,000 in
counterfeit $50 bills.
   At a ``key point'' in the negotiations, a decision was made to
arrest the two men, Griffin said.
   All of the bills were seized, Griffin said.

   ``Suddenly there came a tapping, as of
someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.'' Yo.
   Edgar Allan Poe, meet Sylvester Stallone.
   Stallone took a detour during filming of ``Rocky V'' to visit
the Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site, a house where the poet
and short-story writer lived for two years.
   Park ranger Joelle Wagner said Thursday she answered a knock at
the locked front door Feb. 12 to find the creator of movie hero
Rocky Balboa on the doorstep with co-star Talia Shire and a
bodyguard.
   ``I was flabbergasted,'' she said. ``I had to take a few moments
to compose myself.''
   As the group toured the three-story structure, one of four
houses Poe rented while living in Philadelphia from 1838 to 1844,
Stallone told Ms. Wagner he had written a movie script about the
author of the poem ``The Raven.''
   ``He's just in awe of Poe,'' Ms. Wagner said. ``He said he
really admired him.''
   Stallone, the lead in such action movies as ``Rambo'' and
``Tango and Cash,'' did not say if he wanted to portray Poe, she
said.
   Ms. Wagner said the trio viewed the park's slide show, which
describes Poe's life from his childhood in Richmond, Va., his time
at West Point and his literary life in Philadelphia, where he was
most successful as a poet, short-story writer, literary critic and
editor.
   Poe died in 1849 in Baltimore as he was traveling to New York.
Stories at the time said he collapsed in the street of an alcohol
or drug overdose.
   While touring the house, Stallone discussed Poe's life and
literary works with his friends, according to Ms. Wagner.
   ``There wasn't much I could tell him'' about Poe, the park
ranger said.
   She said Stallone bought a book on the writer.
   Movie publicist Dave Fulton said Stallone wrote the script
because he believes the writer ``gets within the soul'' of people
and poetry.
   ``He's a big fan,'' Fulton said.
   Poe also wrote ``The Fall of the House of Usher,'' ``The Black
Cat,'' and ``The Murders of the Rue Morgue,'' which established the
mystery or detective short-story form.

<HEAD>Former Florida Governor Switches Back to GOP to Run Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENT KALLESTAD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Florida governor announced
Friday he has switched back to the Republican Party after a stint
as a Democrat to challenge Gov. Bob Martinez in the September GOP
primary.
   ``The opportunity is there,'' said Claude R. Kirk Jr., who was
governor from 1967 to 1971, the first Republican since
Reconstruction to win the office in Florida.
   Kirk, 64, who once vetoed his own budget, lost his re-election
bid in 1970. His ability to attract votes virtually disappeared
after he was turned out of office by Democrat Reubin Askew.
   Kirk mounted another ill-fated gubernatorial bid as a Democrat
in 1978 when he and running mate Mary Singleton finished sixth in a
field of seven. Two years ago, Kirk came in fifth in a six-way race
for U.S. Senate.
   In addition to Kirk and Martinez, state Sen. Marlene
Woodson-Howard of Bradenton and Fort Lauderdale resident Anthony
Martin are seeking the GOP nomination. Gainesville businessman Ben
Campen said Thursday he will probably enter the race next week.
   ``A primary against Bob Martinez is a farce,'' said J.M.
Stipanovich, the governor's campaign manager. ``They're wasting
their time, their money and their effort.''
   Kirk and Martinez are Florida's only two Republican governors
this century. Both won office when the Democratic Party was
fractured by bitter primary battles.
   Kirk, accompanied by his daughter Claudia and former state GOP
chairman Tommy Thomas, said he hoped to raise $1.3 million for his
primary challenge.
   ``Anything more than that is obscene,'' said Kirk, who dismissed
his most recent party change as insignificant. ``The voters of
Florida realize that the party I'm involved in is a Kirk party as
such, philosophically.''
   Kirk generally refrained from political attacks on Martinez,
telling reporters he'd unveil his campaign stands later.

<TEXT>
   U.S. disaster relief officials agreed in a
court settlement Friday to provide tens of millions of dollars to
replace residential hotel rooms and other cheap housing destroyed
in the San Francisco earthquake.
   The settlement, which could cost the Federal Emergency
Management Agency up to $50 million, came in a civil lawsuit filed
Jan. 19 in U.S. District Court to obtain assistance for low-income
people who were displaced by the Oct. 17 quake.
   It is the first time FEMA has provided money to renovate
residential hotels damaged in a disaster, said Lorrie Jean, deputy
director and general counsel for FEMA.
   ``We've done this because we're basically learning how to
respond to the unique needs of presidentially declared emergencies
in urban areas,'' Ms. Jean told reporters.
   The lawsuit was filed by at least four public interest agencies,
including the Legal Aid Society of Alameda County. The agencies
said at least 5,000 people were left homeless because their hotel
rooms were damaged by the quake.
   Stephen E. Ronfeldt of the Legal Aid Society said the agencies
agreed to settle the lawsuit because they were happy with how much
FEMA was willing to bend its policies to help poor people affected
by the quake.
   The settlement was tentatively approved by U.S. District Judge
Eugene Lynch, who set a March 16 hearing for final approval.
   It requires FEMA funds to cover about 1,800 hotel units and
other inexpensive housing affected, and calls for FEMA to provide
money for short-term housing assistance while replacement units are
found.
   Under the settlement, housing units can be replaced by
rehabilitation or through rent vouchers to owners of renovated
apartment buildings. Construction of new units is not allowed.
   Tens of thousands of other people also could be affected by the
settlement because it calls for FEMA reimbursement checks to go to
individuals who were sharing housing with non-relatives. The agency
had previously decided to issue one check per shared housing unit
that was damaged in the quake.

<HEAD>Pittsburgh Could Use Steel Mills to Build Maglev Trains, Study
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business, labor and government leaders said
Friday they hope to establish Pittsburgh as a major equipment
supplier for a levitated train system that could transport
passengers at up to 300 mph.
   The magnetic levitation train _ nicknamed ``maglev'' _ could
create jobs well into the 21st century by using the city's idled
steel mills to build the new technology, according to a report
released by members of Maglev Inc.,
   ``What we want to do in the Pittsburgh area is become a
technological and manufacturing base for magnetic levitation in the
United States,'' said advertising executive James Roddey, former
chairman of Port Authority Transit of Allegheny County and acting
president of Maglev Inc.
   Maglev was formed to develop a 19-mile demonstration project
linking downtown Pittsburgh to Greater Pittsburgh International
Airport.
   The train, which has no wheels, hovers on a magnetic cushion
over an elevated guideway. Car sides wrap around a guide rail.
Maglev appears to be the best high-speed ground transportation
based on cost, environmental impact, speed, comfort and readiness,
Roddey said.
   The group believes magnetic levitation eventually will become
the transportation method of choice for trips ranging from 150 to
300 miles in the United States, Roddey said.
   Electromagnetic train technology was devised in the United
States in 1968 but perfected in Germany.
   The group has just completed a preliminary study of the
feasibility of the the future of magnetic levitation in Pittsburgh
and now is trying to raise $2.1 million for a more detailed study,
Roddey said.
   ``We're now in the next phase to determine whether or not it's
financially possible or whether or not we can become a
manufacturing center,'' he said.
   The 12 members of Maglev Inc. have agreed to invest $900,000 and
staffing for the study, which will take 2{ years to finish. An
additional $300,000 will come from the state, Roddey said.
   The Maglev Promotion Council, a Japanese trading company, has
committed about $250,000, he said, and the company is applying for
$1.2 million from federal officials.
   The 19-mile link to the airport could be completed as early as
1996, Roddey said. It would cost $299 million to $648 million to
design and build, depending on which route to the airport is
selected and whether a single- or double-track system is built.
   Maglev Inc.'s 12 members are AGE Westinghouse Transportation
Systems Inc., Allegheny County, the city of Pittsburgh, USX Corp.,
Carnegie Mellon University, Duquesne Light Co., the Michael Baker
Corp., the law firm of Reed Smith Shaw &amp; McClay, the Tri-State
Conference on Steel, United Steelworkers of America, Union Switch &amp;
Signal and Transrapid International.
   Maglev Inc. officials said they are close to reaching an
agreement for the exclusive maglev manufacturing rights in North
America with Transrapid, a German consortium that has worked on the
train's technology.
   The study estimates the project would generate $96 billion in
economic activity in the region if Maglev Inc. is awarded
manufacturing rights.

<HEAD>Dangerous Ether Had Already Been Removed from Elementary School</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GASPORT, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials who closed two elementary schools
for fear that potentially explosive ether was stored in the
basements said Friday they later discovered the chemical had been
removed in 1974.
   Students were sent home Tuesday so explosives experts could
remove crates containing Cold War-era ``packaged disaster
hospitals,'' which, according to their labels, included ether. The
crates, dating from about 30 years ago, were meant for use in a
national emergency.
   Experts, however, found that the crates no longer contained
ether, said Roger Winner, a member of the Gasport Fire Department
Board of Commissioners and a former state Emergency Management
officer.
   ``The crates were opened. The ether had been removed,'' Winner
said. ``There were other ... mechanical items _ part of the
operating room equipment _ that were in these crates.''
   Some kinds of ether under certain conditions can have the
explosive potential of nitroglycerin.
   Officials said the ether apparently was removed in 1974, when a
directive to Niagara County emergency officials warned of the
potential danger.
   Nonetheless, officials Friday defended the decision to send home
500 students from Gasport Elementary School and 470 students from
another elementary school in the nearby community of Middleport.
   ``It was not blown out of proportion,'' said Margaret Chong, the
on-scene representative of the federal Environmental Protection
Agency. ``There was no indication at the time that there was
nothing in the box. No labeling, no information at all.''

   More than a decade after it became the first
spacecraft to visit Saturn, Pioneer 11 flew beyond Neptune's orbit
and out of the solar system, according to NASA and the company that
built the probe.
   ``Pioneer 11 is following in the historic footsteps of Pioneer
10, one of the spacecraft we are proudest of,'' TRW Inc.
spokeswoman Montye Male said Friday as the probe passed the
milestone 2.8 billion miles from Earth. ``We wish it a fond

   Neptune is now the outermost planet. Pluto currently is closer
to the sun in an elongated, elliptical orbit, part of which extends

   By crossing Neptune's orbit, Pioneer 11 became the fourth

   An Army deserter who believes he
``threw 30 years of my life away'' by fleeing to East Germany in
1959 said the changes in the United States have left him
slack-jawed with amazement.
   Arnold Kephart, 53, who fled to East Germany fearing punishment
after wrecking an Army truck, said adjustment to U.S. society has
made him feel a bit like a latter-day Rip van Winkle.
   ``The first time I saw one of those,'' Kephart said, pointing to
a microwave oven, ``I thought it was a TV. Then someone came along,
opened it up, and put food in. I couldn't believe he was putting
food in the TV.''
   In an interview Friday at the home of his brother-in-law, Arlo
Dunbar, Kephart said he regretted his decision to enter East
Germany only a few weeks after settling in Schmalkalind, he town
where he lived for 30 years.

<HEAD>IBM Stock Price Climbs as Computer Giant's Prospects Brighten</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>

   IBM's stock has climbed since December, and
analysts say the world's largest computer maker is beginning to see
the benefits of a cost-cutting program and stock buyback.
   The stock, which was down to about $94 a share in late December,
moved back into triple digits in recent weeks and was trading
around $103 late last week.
   Many analysts consider International Business Machines Corp.
shares a strong investment and say the company is bouncing back
from a multiyear slump.
   Rick Martin, who follows IBM for Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., recently upgraded his recommendation for IBM stock from
``hold'' to ``buy.''
   Martin said his recommendation was based in part on the new line
of computer workstations IBM unveiled earlier this month.
   The machines, aimed at the engineering and scientific markets,
won rave reviews from experts for their performance and relatively
low prices. Analysts say they are an important introduction in a
segment of the computer business in which IBM never has done well.
   ``We have postulated that IBM has only two ways out of its
malaise: It could either accept low growth and make massive
cutbacks in expenses or it could get more aggressive in products
and pricing,'' Martin wrote in a recent commentary.
   He said the workstation announcement was a clear sign the
company has chosen the latter path.
   ``We think the new-found aggressiveness will improve investor
psychology in the near term and should lead to substantial earnings
improvements for the long term,'' he wrote.
   John Jones, an analyst for Montgomery Securities in San
Franciso, said IBM also is benefiting from a share repurchase
program announced last fall. IBM said it would buy back up to $5
billion worth of its shares during an unspecified time period.
   Share repurchase programs usually boost a company's stock price
by reducing the supply of shares.
   Jones said in an interview that IBM's restructuring, which
involves the elimination of 10,000 jobs and consolidation of
plants, also has aided the company's performance.
   IBM reported that its profit slipped 35 percent last year to
$3.76 billion, or $6.47 a share, from $5.81 billion, $9.80 a share,
in 1988. Revenue grew 5.1 percent to $62.7 billion from $59.7
billion.
   ``The reality is that 1989, when you adjust for non-recurring
events, actually wasn't that bad a year for IBM,'' Jones said.
Among the one-time charges against earnings was a pretax charge of
$2.4 billion for the restructuring in the fourth quarter.
   He said IBM's revenue and profit overseas, where the company
does more than half its business, increased markedly last year, but
the impact to the bottom line was masked by an unfavorable dollar
exchange rate.
   He said the improved performance overseas in local-currency
terms ``says to the astute investor that the efforts IBM has been
making for the last four years are starting to show.''
   In addition, Jones said, IBM's domestic revenue grew for the
first time in four years, though it only was a 2 percent increase.
   Jones said IBM's share price is about where it was after the
October 1987 market crash.
   ``It is a battered stock that doesn't look like it's got a lot
of downside risk,'' he said.
   Among the positive factors, Jones said, is that growth in the
technology industry this year should exceed the economy as a whole,
despite recent reports of retrenchment in the computer field.
   An economic downturn could hurt IBM, he said, but ``it will have
less of an impact if IBM has aggressively priced new technology in
the marketplace.''
   Stewart Crane, an analyst with Gruntal &amp; Co., said IBM should
outperform the technology industry as a whole.
   But, he added, despite improvements, ``They're not working on
all six cylinders.''
   ``It's a general consensus that IBM (stock) is cheap enough on
basic earnings power and probably won't have any major negative
surprises,'' he said.
   He said IBM's profit margins are being hurt by its decision to
reduce the price of some of its products.
   As for growth in IBM's stock price this year, Jones predicts the
blue-chip issue could hit $120 to $130 a share, while Martin puts
it at the high end of that range.
   Jones predicts IBM's earnings per share should be about $10 this
year; Matin puts the figure at $9.30. Crane said the going estimate
on Wall Street is about $9.50 a share.

   Tom Clancy's high-tech novel ``The Hunt for
Red October'' enthralled millions of readers with its
suspense-filled drama of a renegade Soviet submarine. Surefire
movie material, right?
   Yet the saga took five years to reach the screen. At least part
of the reason, observes producer Mace Neufeld, is that studio
executives don't read books.
   The Paramount Pictures release, starring Sean Connery, Alec
Baldwin and a mammoth sub named Red October after the Russian
Revolution, reaches the nation's theaters Friday. Neufeld optioned
the Clancy book after reading the galley proofs in 1985. Even
though the book was a huge best seller, the producer's efforts to
find a studio failed.
   ``The cost factor was one reason,'' he said. ``In Hollywood,
because of time constraints, very few people in a position to say
yes to a project like this read the book. They generally read the
reader's report.
   ``This book doesn't condense well into two or three pages. I
read some of the reports from the other studios, and the story was
too complicated to understand. Fortunately, I was able to get a
major executive at Paramount to read the book, and he said: `I
think this can make a great movie. Let's see if we can develop it.'
''
   Larry Ferguson and Donald Stewart worked on the script, and
Neufeld sought the cooperation of the U.S. Navy _ ``without that,
there could be no movie.'' At first the submariners were reluctant,
pointing to their reputation as ``the silent service.''
   But many of the admirals were fans of the Clancy book, Neufeld
said, and they concluded a film would be a good way of ``showing
taxpayers where their money was going.'' It helped that Paramount
had glamorized the Navy's jet fighters in ``Top Gun.''
   Neufeld would admit only that ``The Hunt for Red October'' cost
``in excess of $30 million'' _ some estimates are as high as $50
million. Much of the budget went to the Navy, which carries a list
of charges for equipment and personnel used in movies.
   The first actor signed for the large, all-male cast was Alec
Baldwin.
   ``The picture was first mentioned to me in December of 1988,''
the Long Island-born actor recalled in an interview. ``But it was
not mentioned as the lead role. I figured they would get `Mr. Big'
again.''
   That had happened to Baldwin again and again. He had played
supporting roles in such films as ``Beetlejuice,'' ``Married to the
Mob,'' ``Working Girl,'' ``Talk Radio'' and ``She's Having a Baby.''
   ``For some of the films I actually read for the lead roles,'' he
says. ``It didn't work out that I got the roles.
   ``I had been offered some leads in films that were less
desirable to me, and I turned them down. I was lucky to be working
with Mike Nichols, Woody Allen, Jonathan Demme and John Hughes. So
I took the best that was offered to me at that time.''
   Baldwin was joined by a strong cast including Scott Glenn, James
Earl Jones, Sam Neill, Tim Curry, Richard Jordan and Courtney B.
Vance. The key role of the Soviet sub commander, Marko Ramius, went
to the German actor Klaus Maria Brandauer.
   John McTiernan (``Die Hard'') was chosen as director. He was two
weeks into filming when disaster struck: Brandauer could not report
because of another commitment. The filmmakers sent a distress
signal _ and a copy of the script by fax _ to Sean Connery.
   ``I had reservations about it,'' admits Connery. ``I thought
this kind of Cold War intrigue might be dated because of recent
events. It turned out that the studio had failed to fax the first
page of the script, which explained that it took place before
Gorbachev.''
   Connery arrived in Los Angeles on a Friday and was supposed to
start shooting on Monday. He requested a day's rehearsal, then
jumped into his role as the stolid Soviet captain. He managed with
remarkable ease, despite speaking his early dialogue in Russian.
   ``It wasn't hard,'' he said. ``They were all one-liners.''
   He also had to deal with the immensely complicated submarine
hardware. ``I can't even program my video recorder.''
   Another hazard: the submarine sets. Because filming aboard
actual subs was impractical, studio wizards constructed two
50-foot-square platforms to house mockups of the Red October and
the USS Dallas. They stood on top of two hydraulic gimbals that
could simulate the subs' movements.
   ``It was very claustrophobic,'' Connery recalls. ``There were 62
people in a very confined space, 45 feet above the stage floor. It
got very hot on the sets, and I'm also prone to seasickness. The
set would tilt to 45 degrees. Very disturbing.''
   He was a navy man himself. ``I enlisted at the age of 16 and
rose to the august position of able-bodied seaman. I enlisted for
12 years, but I was released after three because of ulcers _ which
tells you something.''
   Although he appears throughout the film, Connery's work was
telescoped from seven weeks to four. The production continued for
months on locations from Port Angeles, Wash., to the waters off Los
Angeles. That was the site of opening shots of the Red October
surfacing.
   ``We had built a replica over 400 feet long,'' says producer
Neufeld. ``Taking it out on the ocean was a scary moment for all of
us. We weren't sure it would work. Happily it did.''
   Paramount is taking no chances that the launch of ``The Hunt for
Red October'' will go unnoticed. The biggest movie hype since
``Batman'' was launched with an ad on the Super Bowl telecast.
Billboards in major cities have carried the teaser line, ``The hunt
is on.'' That was followed by a poster with the film's title and a
stern portrait of Sean Connery.
   Millions of dollars have been poured into two-page ads in
national magazines and commercials on national TV. A gala premiere
in Washington was aimed to attract political attention.
   And the entire campaign is keyed in flame-colored red and black.

<HEAD>The Audi V8 Quattro</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1990 Audi V8 Quattro is as close to a swagger as the folks
at Audi get.
   This $47,450 power machine is quietly packaged in decidedly Audi
styling _ the luxury Eurosedan look that's relatively unassuming.
   But take this new flagship of the Audi fleet out on the highway
and revel with Audi in a new appreciation for what a luxury
Eurosedan can be.
   The Audi V8 Quattro test car's 3.6-liter, 32-valve V-8 engine
impressively dominated, going from 0 to 60 mph in 8.7 seconds, and
is capable of producing 240 horsepower. Coupled with four-speed
electronically controlled automatic transmission, it delivered
smooth performance, especially in the economy driving mode.
   Drivers can change the shift points with a knob on the center
console, depending on whether they want to watch fuel consumption
(economy mode) or want maximum power (sport setting). I preferred
the sport setting, though it made this nearly 4,000-pound car so
quick I nearly took off the corner bumpers of a couple of cars I
was trying to pass.
   And road handling? The Audi V8's suspension was masterful,
making the vehicle feel as safe and in control at, let's just say,
frightfully high speeds, as it did at the highway speed limit of 65
mph. And with full-time four-wheel-drive, this car can handle just
about anything. It tackled snow with gusto, leaving other cars in a
swirl of white. It tracked capably through icy slush, too.
   It was especially impressive, considering this is Audi's first
merging of a powerful 32-valve V-8 engine, an automatic
transmission and permanent all-wheel-drive technology. Of course,
it's also the most expensive car the West German carmaker has
marketed in the States. The previous top-priced Audi was the 200
Quattro wagon at $38,000.
   But wait. There's more to the Audi V8 Quattro. A microcomputer
not only monitors the engine systems and maintains optimum
performance but memorizes malfunctions for easier diagnosis at the
shop.
   The test car's antilock brakes (ABS) came with a turnoff button
on the dashboard for those driving conditions, such as loose
gravel, where ABS can sometimes hinder a driver's ability to stop
by preventing gravel from building up at the wheels.
   The Audi Bose sound system was superb, and the electronically
controlled front seats _ leather, of course _ were roomy and
comfortable. The front center armrest, which housed a cellular
phone that was standard equipment, not optional, could be adjusted
to various heights.
   Other thoughtful touches included heated seats in both the front
and rear that worked wonderfully fast, a heated door lock on the
driver door so you can't be frozen out of the car, and a dual
windshield washer system. The system lets you use a special washer
fluid that's particularly effective for salt and grime first, and
then follow up with the regular fluid for picture-perfect vision no
matter what the road throws up at you. The headlights received a
washing, too, each time the regular washer fluid was activated.
   The front floor mats had fasteners to keep them in place,
carpeting was all-wool throughout, and the shoulder belt height was
adjustable so the belt wouldn't chafe against a short person's neck.
   There also was a reddish light that shone down on the driver
floor area as an added safety feature when the headlights were on,
wood grain tastefully swathed across the doors and dashboard, and a
spot in the center of the instrument cluster that showed what radio
station was tuned in so the driver never had to look below at the
radio.
   That feature took some getting used to. My eyes caught the
flickering of something changing in the instrument cluster, and at
first, I thought it must have been a warning light that came on and
went out. On examination, I realized it was just the changing radio
station.
   I also noted the car can guzzle down the fuel _ I averaged under
17 mpg in combined city-highway driving, with the EPA rating the
Audi V8 at 14 mpg in the city and 18 mpg on the highway. A gas
guzzler tax of $1,050, by the way, is added on to the $47,450 base
price for the Audi V8 Quattro because of the vehicle's poor fuel
economy.
   Additionally, the person sitting in the rear middle seat would
find the seatback a bit hard. That's where the rear center armrest
is, and it just doesn't make for a very comfortable long-term
resting spot. On the other hand, the rear legroom was good, and
both the rear window controls and rear cigarette lighter could be
disabled with the touch of a button on the driver door so children
in back can't get hurt.
   Audi lists some impressive competitors for the V8 Quattro _ the
Mercedes-Benz 420SEL, which starts around $63,000, the BMW 735i,
around $53,000, and the Jaguar XJ6 Vanden Plas, around $48,000.
Audi didn't mention Japanese luxury models, such as the Lexus
LS400, which starts at $35,000, but they're bound to be a factor,
too.
   Still, sales of the Audi V8 Quattro totaled more than 800 in
calendar 1989, and the company projects about 1,500 sales in 1990.
   They're looking for mostly male buyers between 35 and 49, with
household income of $150,000. They will be predominantly college
graduates in professional jobs, Audi said.
   Because the Audi V8 Quattro is a new vehicle, Consumer Reports
magazine does not list owner trouble reports.

<HEAD>Bonuses At Dying Drexel Show How Wall Street's Skewed Pay System
Works</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s disclosure that it
paid more than $200 million in bonuses before collapsing has
angered creditors and reinforced a popular notion that the junk
bond giant was a glutton to the end.
   But compensation experts say the magnitude and timing of the
Drexel bonuses, which came to light this past week, don't
necessarily show a last-minute money orgy by a company that came to
symbolize the greedy excesses of the past decade.
   Many said these bonuses, an alien dream to most American workers
but a standard practice on Wall Street, graphically illustrate the
nature of the skewed pay system in the feast-or-famine securities
business, where the best talent has come to expect annual rewards
of six figures and often more.
   ``What I think has happened to many firms is they've built these
bonuses into their cost structure,'' said Richard Furniss, a vice
president and compensation consultant at Towers, Perrin, Forster &amp;
Crosby in Manhattan.
   ``That's why you get a situation like Drexel, which feels
perfectly justified to pay the bonuses,'' he said. ``It's an
extreme result of the compensation system.''
   Drexel pioneered the $200 billion junk bond market, financed the
1980s takeover decade and became known as the brashest, most
arrogant and profitable firm on Wall Street.
   It collapsed with startling speed Feb. 13, the result of a slump
in junk bonds, a criminal plea bargain on fraud charges, a cash
shortage and a stunning loss of confidence by banks, lenders and
customers. Drexel's parent filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection with debts totaling nearly $3 billion.
   In those circumstances, the disclosure that Drexel paid yearend
bonuses in the hundreds of millions of dollars only a few months
before seemed even more stunning.
   It raised questions about whether management knew how severe the
firm's problems were or whether the money was paid deliberately to
keep creditors from getting any. Some Drexel critics even theorized
that if the company hadn't paid the bonuses it might have survived.
   Drexel denied initial reports that the bonuses totaled as much
as $350 million and said the payments were predetermined by a
formula devised a year ago. On Friday it issued a more detailed
response, saying the bonuses totaled only $260 million, about 25
percent of it paid in company stock that's now almost worthless.
   Nonetheless, the propriety of the bonuses is expected to become
an issue in bankruptcy court and in congressional scrutiny of the
Drexel collapse.
   Historically, bonuses have represented the overwhelming portion
of a Wall Street professional's annual compensation. Many
investment firms are structured as partnerships, in which employees
draw a living allowance during most of the year, calculate their
pool of profit toward yearend and divvy it up.
   Those profit pools began to multiply in the late 1970s and grew
even more dramatically in the 1980s, fueled by enormous expansion
in the financial markets and the role investment banks played in
corporate takeovers.
   ``Wall Street compensation packages are a result of the
industry's incredibly accelerated growth rate during the boom
years, when they were really engaged in a bidding war for a scarce
commodity, talent,'' said Pearl Meyer, head of Pearl Meyer &amp;
Partners, a New York compensation consulting firm.
   ``The firms became extremely profitable. Compensation spiraled
year after year,'' she said. ``Some tried to keep it down but
weren't successful because everyone was recruiting.''
   In those circumstances, an investment banker who historically
brought in millions of dollars in business would simply jump ship
if an employer tried to limit the bonus.
   Even in the midst of the slump that has gripped the securities
industry for more than two years, the bonus often has remained
entrenched. Many firms have laid off thousands of workers and
exited marginally profitable businesses to cut their costs instead.
   Vincent C. Perro, a principal at Sibson &amp; Co., a New York
management consulting firm, said a third alternative that some Wall
Street firms are trying is to base bonuses more on an individual's
contribution.
   ``Given the reduced ability to pay, firms are differentiating
between strong, average and weak performers more sharply in the
past,'' he said.
   Others said they expected this disparity to grow and were
advising clients to restructure their their bonus systems so that
stars get rewarded and laggards don't.
   ``You examine individual performance more closely so you know
where the money is made and you know who's making it,'' said
Furniss.
   Elsewhere in business this past week:
   _The auto industry showed more signs of weakness. Major
automakers said mid-February sales fell 12.1 percent. The Big Three
proceeded with previously announced layoff plans that will idle
thousands of workers. Jaguar PLC, the troubled British automaker
dogged by quality control problems, issued a major recall in the
midst of its acquisition by Ford Motor Co. In Europe, Volvo and
Renault said they would invest in each other to make them more
competitive.
   _Despite one of the worst weeks ever for the Tokyo stock market,
stocks in the United States suffered only slightly. The divergent
behavior conflicted with the widespread notion that the
economically mighty Japanese have become the dominant force in
influencing markets elsewhere.
   _In one of the few big takeovers so far this year, Great
Northern Nekoosa Corp. dropped its resistance to a $3.7 billion
acquisition by rival Georgia Pacific Corp.. The merger will create
the largest U.S. forest products company.
   _The federal government blasted smoking but sanctioned a fat
substitute. Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan,
intensifying a campaign against tobacco companies, urged athletes
to shun their ``blood money'' sponsorships. Meanwhile, the Food and
Drug Administration approved the first fat substitute, a concoction
of egg whites and milk called Simplesse, made by Monsanto Co.
subsidiary NutraSweet Co.

<HEAD>Peace Dividend of Another Sort</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There may indeed be a peace dividend in the
future, but it might not be the one that's getting most of the
attention.
   Most of the dividend talk so far has centered around the
possibility of the the country having to spend less for defense in
a more peaceful world, allowing deficits to be cut or money
allocated to various social needs.
   More recent thinking takes another perspective on the peace
dividend, one that envisions the United States, and in fact the
entire world, benefitting from a marked increase in trade and
economic development.
   The latter thesis is beginning to sound more likely for many
reasons, most compelling of them being that it probably has begun
already.
   Even before the Socialist wall crumbled, American companies were
preparing for a relaxation of business restrictions throughout
Eastern Europe. Now that matters have been facilitated, a rush is
on to develop markets there.
   Western money markets already reflect an eagerness to begin the
financing job, which Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan last
week called ``the most important financial issue of the decade.''
   Greenspan's comments were timely, since Eastern Europe's great
need for investment capital, representing a brand new demand on the
world's lendable funds, already have pushed up U.S. and world
interest rates.
   In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Greenspan
indicated that the higher rates might be temporary, and many
financial analysts continue to believe that interest costs in
general will resume falling later this year.
   His comments were also significant because until now the usual
explanation for high interest rates, often shared by the Fed, was
the existence of federal budget deficits. Those deficits now fall
to second place.
   If the United States is able to take advantage of the big
demands likely to be made by the emerging market economies of
Europe, it would help, at least in the short term, to reduce the
nagging U.S. balance of payments deficit.
   The expansion of market economies, especially if it eventually
includes China, would also provide relief from intense competition
for severely stressed domestic goods producers, now pressured by
imports from Europe and Asia.
   The possibilities for trade expansion are heightened also by
events beyond Eastern Europe. The Japanese are expected to relax
restrictions to entry into their markets. And the planned economic
unification of Western Europe might spur growth in that area,
further enhancing possibilities for U.S. companies.
   The original notion of a peace dividend was that savings would
come mainly from a reduction in defense spending, with estimates
ranging from a few billion dollars to as much as $150 billion a
year.
   Such a decline would open up various options to American
policymakers, including tax cuts, elimination of the big budget
deficits and attacks on various social problems, including drugs,
poor housing and health care.
   If the budget deficit shrinks, and if the Federal Reserve could
fine tune the money supply, it becomes conceivable in such a
scenario that interest rates and inflation would decline, giving a
big boost to the standard of living.
   In the past, however, such apparent opportunities have a
mysterious way of disappearing when the money is counted. Somehow,
planned savings get spent, sometimes unwisely, the only explanation
being that ``that's politics.''
   The peace dividend that arises from investment and industrial
development is very real, and it probably is under way right now.

   Events this week on Wall Street once again
demonstrated the link between the Japanese and American stock
markets _ or did they?
   Twice this past week the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
plunged. Each time, the drop echoed in New York. But the severity
of the decline on Wall Street didn't come close to the fall in
Tokyo.
   On Wednesday, when the Nikkei index fell 3.15 percent for its
third-worst decline ever, stocks in New York mimicked the slide at
the opening bell and the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted 30
points.
   But the market soon recovered, and by the close, the Dow was
down a modest 13.29.
   On Friday, the Nikkei fell 2.61 percent for its fifth-worst drop
in history. Again, the New York market opened lower _ but the Dow
was down only about 11 points. The market seesawed before the Dow
finished down 10.58.
   The behavior of the two markets cast doubt on what widely had
been assumed to be the inextricable link between the U.S. and
Japanese exchanges.
   That relationship was demonstrated powerfully last Oct. 13, when
the Dow plunged 190 points but the Tokyo stock market's strength in
the following session helped restore investor confidence on Wall
Street.
   At the time, many had feared the Tokyo market would plunge and
drag down New York even further, particularly if Japanese investors
were forced to sell their U.S. stocks to raise cash for obligations
at home. Many American securities holders worried about that
prospect again this past week.
   Walter Murphy, a senior market specialist with Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co. Inc., said the New York and Tokyo markets react to domestic
issues as much as to events abroad.
   ``You're looking at two markets that are acting under their own
reasons for being,'' he said.
   For example, he said, when the yen is down in relation to the
dollar, it's bad news for the Tokyo market but good news in New
York because a weaker yen helps improve U.S. trade competitiveness.
   However, he did not dispute that there was a link among the
world markets.
   ``If you look at markets over time, there is and has been a good
global relationship. Bull markets in one part of the world are
going to be bull markets in the other part of the world,'' he said.
   But, he added, ``To say there is a day-to-day correlation is not
only inaccurate but probably dangerous.''
   Ralph E. Blair, a partner in the trading department of
Montgomery Securities Inc. in San Francisco, said: ``There
certainly is a concern about what goes on over there. But
considering all the bad (economic) news, the (U.S.) market is
acting pretty well.''
   Blair said one factor that made it easier for the U.S. markets
to take the Japanese plunge in stride this week was that the
decline was fairly orderly as far as market drops go.
   In addition, analysts have been saying for months that the Tokyo
market _ the world's largest and richest _ was overpriced and ripe
for a ``correction.'' They said its share prices were way out of
line with corporate earnings.
   Some experts say the Tokyo market operates in a world of its
own. European stocks historically have moved more in tandem with
New York than with Tokyo. That also may account for a lessening of
the impact of a drop in Japan.
   The reaction in New York also may have been another
demonstration of Wall Street's stiff upper lip so far this year in
the face of gloomy economic news. The market has shrugged off
concern about higher interest rates, recession forecasts and the
demise of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   For the week, which was shortened a day by the Presidents Day
holiday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials lost 71.40 to
2,564.19.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index slipped 4.40 to
179.35; the NASDAQ composite index of over-the-counter trading lost
9.49 to 419.52, and the American Stock Exchange market value index
dropped 7.77 to 351.10.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 159.84 million shares a day,
compared with 148.57 the week before.

<HEAD>SEC: Philip Morris Can't Block Shareholder Anti-Tobacco Resolution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bowing to the ``growing significance of the
social and public policy issues'' involving tobacco products,
federal securities regulators say Philip Morris Cos. cannot block
shareholder anti-smoking resolutions.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission informed Philip Morris on
Thursday that it was reversing its stance allowing the company to
reject such proposals as interference with its ordinary course of
business.
   Companies seeking to exclude attempts to put issues up for a
vote at annual shareholders meetings must seek SEC approval, in the
form of a staff letter saying the agency will take ``no action''
against the company for barring such a proposal.
   ``While prior staff letters have permitted'' exclusion of
shareholder proposals limiting involvement in tobacco products on
the grounds of ordinary business interference, ``the staff believes
that many of these positions should be reversed,'' SEC Special
Counsel John C. Brousseau wrote Philip Morris.
   He added: ``those prior letters failed to reflect adequately the
growing significance of the social and public policy issues
attendant to operations involving the manufacture and distribution
of tobacco related products.''
   His letter concerned a resolution proposed for the annual
meeting on April 26 by two Roman Catholic religious orders, the
Province of St. Joseph of the Capuchin Order and the Adrian
Dominican Sisters. The proposal calls for amending the articles of
incorporation to bar Philip Morris after Dec. 31, 1991 from
conducting ``any business in tobacco or tobacco products.''
   Also allowed by the SEC was a proposal by the Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America to create a review committee to study
the impact of Philip Morris advertising on smoking by minors.
