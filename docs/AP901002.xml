   Three bodies and the wreckage of a
small airplane were found Tuesday on treacherous ledges near the
windy, snowcapped summit of Mount Washington, authorities said.
   Police said poor weather forced rescuers to suspend efforts to
recover the bodies. They were to go back up the mountain Wednesday.
   The victims' identities were not immediately disclosed.
   Hikers spotted the crash site Tuesday afternoon. The plane is
believed to be a Cessna-172 that disappeared from radar early
Tuesday during a night flight from Syracuse, N.Y., to Bangor,
Maine.
   Residents reported seeing a red light and flash, presumably as
the plane slammed into the northern side of the mountain near its
6,288-foot summit.
   ``It is snowing. The winds are very high. This is all going to
make (the salvage effort) very difficult,'' said Fish and Game Maj.
Henry Mock.
   Recreational hikers spotted the wreckage on the Great Gulf trail
on this mountain in eastern New Hampshire, the Northeast's highest
peak.
   Officials would have to use ropes and other climbing gear to
bring down the bodies and wreckage, Mock said.
   Federal Aviation Administration officials said the pilot of the
Cessna-172 that disappeared from radar had not filed a flight plan,
so they did not know how many people were aboard. A Cessna-172
usually has four seats.

<HEAD>Kaifu Rebukes Cabinet Minister Who Slurred Blacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has reprimanded for
the ``unpardonable'' remark a Cabinet minister who insulted U.S.
blacks, according to a government official.
   Justice Minister Seiroku Kajiyama's Sept. 21 comments touched
off a series of angry protests. At a news conference, the
64-year-old political veteran compared foreign prostitutes in Japan
to black Americans who ``ruin the atmosphere'' of neighborhoods
they move into.
   Following a Cabinet meeting last week, Kaifu called Kajiyama
into his office and told him his remarks were ``inappropriate and
unpardonable,'' giving him a ``stern warning,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Taizo Watanabe told a news briefing on Tuesday.
   The prime minister also ``wanted to make sure similar remarks
would not be uttered by others,'' Watanabe said.
   Asked whether Kajiyama would be forced to resign, Watanabe
indicated the justice minister would retain his post because he
later apologized for the comments and retracted them.
   The comments were the latest by a Japanese politician to provoke
outrage from U.S. minorities. On Friday, angry demonstrators
outside the Japanese Embassy in Washington threatened a boycott
against Japanese products. A group of about 30 foreigners also
protested the remarks in a demonstration at the Justice Ministry in
Tokyo in Tuesday, Kyodo News Service reported.

<DATELINE>EJIDO NUEVA VICTORIA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The gray-haired woman stood
motionless as the health worker's fingers gently probed for the
hard nodules under her skin that signal river blindness.
   The ravages of years of infection are evident in the drooping
skin of her face, in her strangely elongated earlobes. Victoria
Morales is 49; she could pass for 69.
   In her case, the disease was curbed before the parasite spun a
blinding web of microscopic filaments over her eyes.
   It took years of painful treatment with a drug whose side
effects made many afflicted peasants flee the rural health workers
that prowl the rich coffee country of southern Chiapas state.
   Mexico has been fighting river blindness for nearly a
half-century. Suddenly it has a new weapon: a gentler new drug
called ivermectin.
   Rural health worker Jose Alfredo Gordillo, 32, recalls how he
used to pressure people to take the old medication - diethyl
carbamazine, used in Mexico since 1953.
   ``They'd say: `You have come to make us sick,''' the six-year
veteran of the federal health department's river blindness brigades
said.
   Some people simply refused, the treatment was so unpleasant.
They paid the price with disfigurement, premature aging or
blindness.
   But the side effects of ivermectin are milder and patients now
readily come forward for treatment.
   ``We have a problem,'' Gordillo said, smiling. ``The community
leaders want everyone treated - even if they aren't sick!''
   Ivermectin has raised hopes worldwide in the battle against a
disease the World Health Organization says afflicts 18 million
people in West Africa, Latin America and parts of the Middle East.
An estimated 300,000 of them, mostly in West Africa, have been
blinded.
   Ivermectin was developed in the 1970s for livestock parasites.
When researchers discovered it was a safe, effective treatment for
onchocerciasis, or river blindness, the manufacturer, Merck and Co.
of Rahway, N.J., decided to provide it for free.
   A committee of medical experts based at the Carter Center in
Atlanta was set up to handle applications.
   Dr. Bruce Dull, the committee's secretary, said Mexico, which
has one of the world's oldest river blindness control programs,
began using ivermectin in May 1989.
   The three varieties of black fly that carry river blindness in
Mexico are found in Chiapas and nearby Oaxaca only at the high,
cool altitudes that coffee grows best. Their larvae thrive in
fast-moving streams.
   ``Coffee workers are those that are primarily affected and
coffee is very important to our economy,'' said Dr. Andres Martin,
a federal health official in Mexico City.
   He said 250,000 people live in areas where river blindness is
found. About 20,000 active cases have been diagnosed and 16,000
people are now taking ivermectin, he said.
   Worldwide, up to 500,000 people take the drug, which carries the
brand name Mectizan, Dull said.
   Twenty-five brigades of health workers spend up to 40 days at a
time in the field, hiking to remote villages, sleeping on floors
and treating the ailment peasants here call ``dog's skin'' or ``bad
bruise'' (piel de perro, or mal morado) because of the
discoloration and disfigurement it causes.
   There are 76 families on the ejido, or communal farm, of Nuevo
Victoria in the heart of river blindness territory. Nearly all are
affected by the disease, said Jorge Velasco, head of the regional
river blindness program.
   Velasco dips his hand into a stream that runs through the ejido.
A squirming black goo covers his fingertip. It is the larvae of the
black flies that carry the disease.
   The adult flies in turn inject the larvae of the parasite worm
into humans with their bite. The larvae grow into adult worms, some
as long as two feet, which can live inside humans for 12 years and
often cluster insie hard nodules under the skin.
   But it is not the adults that do the damage. It's their
offspring - hundreds of millions of microworms called
microfiliariae - that swarm through human body tissue.
   Blindness is more common in Africa than Latin America. But the
microworms produce fierce itching and disfigurement in most
victims.
   They cause the skin to decay; it becomes dark, scaly, flaccid.
And in the severest cases, lesions develop over the eyes until
sight is gone.
   The effects are not reversible. The only hope is to control the
infection before the worst damage is done.
   Both drugs kill the microworms.
   Reactions to diethyl carbamazine - swelling, itching, low blood
pressure, joint pain, rash, fever, swollen lymph nodes - can be so
intense that it is not used in some rural areas where patients
could not be hospitalized.
   Although ivermectin also produces swelling and itching, the
effects usually pass in days.
   ``We give thanks to God that this was invented to help us,''
said Rumalda Raymundo Perez, 51, who has taken both drugs.
   Neither drug is preventative or a complete cure. But both kill
the microworms, and ivermectin appears to reduce the rate at which
the adult worms breed.
   Although it appears annual treatment is effective, Mexico has
permission to administer it twice a year to see if the rate of
infection drops, Dull said.
   The war against river blindness is a tropical disease success
story in a country where thousands of children die each year of
simple ailments like measles and diarrhea. But hopes of eradication
depend on elimination of the disease-bearing flies.
   ``In my 23 years here, nothing has been done to attack the
vector (carrier),'' said Vicente Ardines Martinez, head of the
transmittable disease program in Chiapas, a state famed for its
lush forests, mountains, jungles and waterfalls.
   ``But the environment is fragile. We don't want to destroy it.''

<HEAD>Doing Their Job: Women Sportswriters Cope With Obstacles</HEAD>

   The justice of gender in the locker room was
supposed to be settled 12 years ago. Courts gave women
sportswriters equal access to dressing rooms so they would have the
same chance as men to do their jobs.
   Yet the issue of women in the clubhouse keeps making headlines.
Denise Tom of USA Today was barred Monday night from the Cincinnati
Bengals' dressing room hours after the National Football League
named an investigator to look into charges of harassment of Boston
Herald reporter Lisa Olson.
   ``We go into locker rooms not because we want to, but because we
have to,'' wrote Christine Brennan, a sportswriter with The
Washington Post and one of pioneers who fought for equal access.
   ``It's not exciting or sexy or tantalizing. It's cramped and
steamy and messy,'' she said. ``But most stadiums are too old to
have a room big enough for all reporters and all players to meet
for interviews. So the only place we can do our jobs is the locker
room.''
   About 500 women work as sports journalists, according to the
Association for Women in Sports Media. They have the same right to
do their jobs as women who drive trucks, mine coal, doctor the sick
or practice law.
   Precedent was established in 1978 when a federal judge ruled
Melissa Ludtke, a reporter for Sports Illustrated, could go into
the New York Yankees' clubhouse. Barring her violated her
constitutional right to equal protection under the law, Judge
Constance Baker Motley ruled.
   In 1985, Commissioner Pete Rozelle ordered all NFL teams to
treat reporters equally in interview areas, regardless of sex. Some
teams like the Dallas Cowboys set up rooms where players could be
interviewed; others handed out bathrobes or towels to players.
   Major league baseball provided equal access that year, too.
Basketball and hockey already had set open policies. The National
Basketball Association schools rookies on how to deal with the
media - male and female.
   But the going has hardly been easy for women in the world of
jocks, where clubhouses smell of sweat and salve and soiled
athletic supporters but where reporters have to go for interviews.
   In 1986, Susan Fornoff of The Sacramento (Calif.) Bee received a
live rat wrapped in a shoe box from Dave Kingman of the Oakland
Athletics. Joan Ryan of The Orlando (Fla.) Sentinel once told of a
player from a defunct football league who ran a razor up her leg as
she conducted an interview.
   Earlier this year, intern Jennifer Frey of the Detroit Free
Press was told by Detroit Tigers pitcher Jack Morris: ``I don't
talk to people when I'm naked, especially women, unless they're on
top of me or I'm on top of them.''
   When the newspaper complained, Tigers president Bo Schembechler
wrote back: ``No female member of my family would be inside a men's
locker room regardless of their job description.''
   Now, former Watergate investigator Philip Heymann has been named
to look into charges that New England Patriots' players exposed
themselves and made suggestive remarks to Olson on Sept. 17. The
Herald reporter called it ``nothing less than mind rape.''
   Tight end Zeke Mowatt was fined $2,000 and apologized, but
denied making lewd gestures or comments. He said the only thing he
told her was: ``You are not writing; you are looking.''
   Patriots owner Victor Kiam at first called the locker room
incident ``a flyspeck in the ocean,'' then told the paper it was
``asking for trouble'' by sending a female reporter into a football
dressing room. He was also quoted as calling her ``a classic
bitch.''
   After the National Organization for Women called from a boycott
of Remington Products Inc., which Kiam owns, he took out full-page
ads in The New York Times, the Boston Herald and The Boston Globe.
   Kiam apologized and said ``there's no excuse for what
happened.'' He also denied calling her a name.
   She was booed at Sunday's game.
   In Seattle, Bengals Coach Sam Wyche kept USA Today's Tom from
the locker room because ``our guys don't want a woman to walk into
a situation like that.'' In the past, Wyche has closed the locker
room to all reporters in violation of NFL policy and was fined last
year.
   Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Wyche faces another fine for
not letting a woman into the locker room.
   ``If he wants to make a stand on the issue, he can make a stand
on the issue. He will be fined very heavily for it. If he wants to
quit, he can quit, because he has been warned twice already,''
Tagliabue said.
   Tuesday's edition of USA Today contained a column by
sportswriter Rachel Shuster aimed at NFL brass. She concluded:
``We've earned our place in the locker room. Now, just give us some
respect, and we'll do our jobs and let you do yours.''

<HEAD>Soviet General Sees Prospects For US-Soviet Military Ties</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   As Germany ended 45 years of division, the
Soviet military chief of staff said the end of the Cold War opens
the road to cooperation between the armed forces of the United
States and the Soviet Union.
   Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev embraced and toasted his American
counterpart, Gen. Colin Powell, at a dinner reception in New York
on Tuesday on the second day of his first visit to the United
States.
   ``We have buried the Cold War and I don't think that General
Powell or I are going to try to dig it back up,'' Moiseyev, 51,
told an audience of about 120 U.S. and Soviet military officers and
New York politicians and businessmen.
   ``There are not only wide prospects for friendship between our
people and the American people, but also wide prospects for
cooperation between our armed forces,'' Moiseyev said.
   Earlier, Moiseyev commented on the possible use of force against
Iraq by multinational troops stationed in Saudi Arabia.
   He said the economic sanctions against Iraq were working and
that no force should be used in the Persian Gulf unless it was
approved by the United Nations, according to a report in
Wednesday's editions of The New York Times.
   Saddam Hussein ``is finding himself in economic and political
isolation and he can't survive very long that way,'' Moiseyev told
the newspaper.
   But Powell, who joined Moiseyev in the Times interview, said
President Bush has not ruled out any options in the current crisis.
   Moiseyev, his country's first deputy minister of defense and
chief of the general staff, is the highest-ranking Soviet military
officer to visit the United States since Soviet Marshall Sergei
Akhromeyev met with then-Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci in
December 1987.
   Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, accompanied
Moiseyev from Washington, where the Soviet general arrived Monday
for his six-day visit.
   ``The alliance of our countries lives again in our time under
the leadership of Bush and (Soviet President Mikhail) Gorbachev,''
Powell told the audience.
   He referred to himself and the Soviet general - a former
railroad worker - as ``old soldier Powell'' and ``old soldier
Moiseyev.''
   Earlier Tuesday, Moiseyev visited Fort Drum in upstate New York
and observed the 10th Mountain Division training drill - a battle
exercise once intended to prepare American soldiers for a military
encounter with a Soviet foe.
   The Soviet military leader said he had ``a typical soldier's
lunch meal, and everything was fantastic.''
   ``The very soul of what it is to meet the American military was
what we have accomplished,'' Moiseyev said, adding that he's ``a
little jealous of General Powell, because he's a man who pays so
much attention and does so much for the U.S. Armed Forces.''
   From New York, Moiseyev is to travel to other military
installations in Michigan, South Dakota, California and Colorado.
   In Washington, Moiseyev visited the Pentagon and the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial, received a 19-gun salute and met with President
Bush.
   ``In our hearts, we've felt much more than we have seen. In
meeting the average American citizen we felt care, attention,
affection,'' the Soviet general said.

<TEXT>
   Erich Honecker, the ousted and reviled
leader of the vanished East Germany, spent reunification night
behind the walls of the Soviet military hospital where he is
confined.
   Like the other 16.6 million citizens of the now extinct state he
ruled for 18 years, the ex-Communist party chief became a citizen
of united democratic Germany at the stroke of midnight Tuesday.
   Residents of Beelitz, 20 miles south of Berlin, had decorated
buildings with German flags for the occassion, and Mass was
celebrated in the town church.
   The 77-year-old Honecker, who withdrew in seclusion and disgrace
after he was ousted a year ago amid massive pro-democracy protests,
can sometimes be seen strolling through the pine and birch forest
on the hospital grounds.
   ``You can see him at night walking around quietly. It's a very
restful place,'' said a Soviet civilian taking a walk along the
road next to the hospital. The Soviet did not give his name and
said he was receiving treatment for an eye ailment at the facility.
   The hospital and old-fashioned brick villas on the grounds are
surrounded by a thick white wall.
   Honecker directed the building of the 1961 Berlin Wall that kept
East Germans trapped in the Communist state for 28 years.
   Most of them detested Honecker.
   Asked once what he liked most about unity, Wolf Biermann, the
former East German dissident expelled to West Germany in the 1970s,
replied: ``That Honecker became a citizen of united Germany and
can't do anything about it.''
   Honecker was accused of corruption and expelled from the
Communist Party in December, but was spared the indignity of
imprisonment when doctors determined that he suffered from a kidney
tumor and was too ill to survive jail life.
   He was transferred to the Soviet military hospital earlier this
year. Soviet officers at the gate declined to allow a Western
reporter on the grounds.
   ``Unity is the business of the Germans. We won't interfere,''
said one. He said the base had no plans to celebrate unification.
   The 360,000 Soviet troops in what was East Germany are scheduled
to return home by 1994.
   Honecker could face trial and imprisonment in the united
Germany, where he is under criminal investigation for allegedly
giving shoot-to-kill orders to border guards and harboring leftist
terrorists wanted in West Germany.

<HEAD>There's Far More Than Food at America's Farmers Markets</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The bumper crop of farmers markets blooming all over the country
is forging ties between city dwellers and the source of their food,
and providing growers with a way to hang onto their farms.
   Farmers markets - in parks and school yards, along downtown
malls or in church lots in hundreds of communities - are great
equalizers: Sophisticated chefs shop alongside poor working
mothers, both in search of inexpensive, fresh food and perhaps a
conversation with the farmer who harvested it the day before.
   ``It's much more than a simple economic relationship,'' said
Elizabeth Ryan, who with her husband farms 35 acres of apples and
other food in Staatsburg, in New York's Hudson River Valley.
   ``It makes you take what you do very seriously. You see the
people who buy your food, you see the people who put it in bottles
and feed it to their baby,'' said Ryan, who does 90 percent of her
sales through New York City's Greenmarket, which has 17 sites and
an estimated 40,000 shoppers a week.
   There are nearly 2,000 farmers markets nationwide, compared with
1,200 in 1980, according to Public Markets Collaborative, which
works to establish and preserve markets.
   Massachusetts had six markets in the mid-1970s; it has 85 this
year. California had just one market 15 years ago; today there are
140. Greenmarket farmers took in at least $9 million last year,
said Barry Benepe, a planning consultant who founded Greenmarket in
1976.
   American Demographics magazine estimates consumers will spend $1
billion to $2 billion for fresh food directly from 200,000 farmers
this year, but that includes roadside stands and other outlets as
well as farmers markets.
   Places like the 200-year-old French Market in New Orleans and
Pike Place Market in Seattle, for example, combine farmers markets
and permanent shops.
   Farmers markets are urban or suburban sites where growers bring
fresh food and sell directly to consumers. They are supported by
local or state governments or by non-profit organizations, and are
set up for many reasons: to support family farms, revitalize
downtowns, provide fresh, inexpensive food to urban residents.
   When Lynn Bagley started four markets in Northern California,
she said, she was primarily interested in nutrition. ``But you
quickly find out that what you're really doing is supporting the
small farmer, and in the long run helping maintain a regional food
belt.''
   In a study, Robert Sommer, director of the Center for Consumer
Research at the University of California-Davis, found that people
shop at farmers' markets for high-quality food, lower prices and
atmosphere, in that order.
   ``In the old days people went to the dump; now they go to the
farmers market. It's become a big social event,'' said August
Schumacher, outgoing commissioner of Food and Agriculture in
Massachusetts.
   ``Market shoping is really a form of entertainment. ... You
don't go to an open-air farmers market because it's convenient,''
said Hilary Baum of Public Markets Collaborative.
   All year, every Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, dozens of
growers do business in Manhattan at Union Square Park - once a
haven for drug dealers - and provide more than ample atmosphere
amid fragrant waist-high stalks of basil, chef demonstrations,
tours and tastings.
   One recent day shoppers could choose white eggplant, cider,
peaches, apples, okra, sour cherries, squash blossoms, raspberries,
eggs, chickens, bursting sunflowers, and apple and blueberry pies.
   A woman at a fish stand hands out cards with a number to call a
day ahead to find out what kinds of fish will be spread out on ice
the next morning. The Blews, who farm in Pittstown, N.J., offered
13 kinds of peppers.
   New York City's markets range from the sprawling Union Square
market - where, Benepe said, growers can make up to $10,000 a day -
to one on the Lower East Side, six farmers once a week. Farmers pay
less than 5 percent of gross for their stalls, he said.
   Growers first came to Greenmarket ``with great skepticism,''
Benepe said. ``They feared they'd come with full loads and go home
with empty pockets. Rip-off city.''
   They found otherwise.
   Merrie Kernan gets up at 2:30 a.m. three days a week to drive a
truckload of produce 125 miles from Bridgton, N.J. She likes
talking with New Yorkers, even those who ask when banana season
starts, or will she have oranges or artichokes soon.
   Then there are the kids she brings lightning bugs for. And the
customer who just bought a small farm and told Kernan she was going
to pay someone to cut the hay. ``I told her - you don't pay
somebody. They pay you.''
   ``Running a farm is very grueling and very demanding. There are
times you feel discouraged,'' Ryan said. ``And the thing that
really makes it worth it, honestly, it's such a shot in the arm to
get in that truck and go to market on Saturday and know that it's
all worthwhile.''
   And for consumers, studies show prices are 5 percent to 30
percent lower at farmers markets, where there are no ``middlemen''
and low transportation costs. There is more than good shopping at
work, however.
   Without the markets, many family farms - too small to comply
with demands for volume and uniformity of whole distributors -
would be forced to sell out. A Greenmarket survey found that 70
percent of its farmers said the market was either essential or
important to their economic well-being, Benepe said.
   In Connecticut, the non-profit Hartford Food System found that
farmers could not afford to run full-scale markets in the poorest
neighborhoods. So it linked up with neighborhood organizations,
bought food from farmers and opened farmstands, said Mark Winne,
the organization's executive director.
   Connecticut also is one of 10 states in the federal Farmers
Market Coupon program. Last year an estimated 275,000 poor women
and children were issued coupons worth $2.5 million. Many farmers
also accept food stamps.
   In Massachusetts, government made a difference, Schumacher said.
``The mayors of many cities wanted to link consumers to local
growers. They gave us wonderful spots, many in front of city halls
- Boston, Brockton, Springfield.''
   The markets, in turn, can help a city.
   A twice-weekly market saved downtown Pasco, Wash., said Linda
Sue Williams of the Pasco Downtown Development Association. Seventy
farmers drive to a lot where the city has in the last five years
built 48 shelters for growers and their food. Three thousand to
5,000 people shop there a week, she said.
   ``It's been credited by many many people with sving the
downtown,'' Williams said. ``It's the best thing that's happened to
Pasco in a long, long time.''
   But a Saturday market in Columbus, Ohio, across from a
convention center under construction, may be threatened by related
commercial development.
   ``There is support, but our future is still a little unknown,''
said Nancy Duncan Porter, executive director of the North Market
Development Authority, which formed to save the market from
becoming a parking lot just three years ago.
   ``Some people just like to tear down and build more than they
like to preserve,'' she said. ``The market is a very `people'
activity and social in nature, and we think a great drawing card
for downtown.''

   Republicans have won the Iowa governor's
race in every election since 1968, but Democrat Don Avenson is
within striking range and thinks he can beat Gov. Terry Branstad to
break the streak.
   ``Our time is coming,'' says Avenson, the state House speaker.
``We have a chance.''
   Recent polls vary, showing Branstad with a lead ranging from a
statistically insignificant three points to as much as 13 points.
   Avenson's campaign is pursuing the following strategy:
   -Raise one-third of the more than $3 million Branstad will
spend.
   -Play off of Iowa's recent economic problems, even though the
state appears to have come through the worst.
   -Reap some voter support from Avenson's pro-choice position on
abortion, even though he's not counting on the issue to dominate
the campaign and provide his margin of victory. ``It's not a silver
bullet,'' he says.
   Avenson hopes to chip away at the lead of a governor who is a
tireless campaigner and who has never lost an election.
   ``The last election I beat the majority leader and this time I'm
going to beat the speaker of the House,'' says the 43-year-old
Branstad, who also has been a state representative and lieutenant
governor.
   ``This governor's been at it six days a week, 14 or 16 hours a
day, for eight years,'' says Branstad. ``I oftentimes have said,
the harder I work, the luckier I get. You kind of make your own
luck.''
   While Democrats have a lead of about 100,000 in voter
registration among the state's 1.5 million registered voters,
Branstad discounts that. He argues there were more Democrats than
Republicans when he won in 1982 and again in 1986.
   Branstad has called for restoring the death sentence, a move
polls show has broad support.
   ``He feels the sentiments are changing among Iowans and among
legislators and this year the Legislature may accept a limited
death penalty,'' said Branstad spokesman Richard Vohs.
   ``I think the governor is nervous. I think he's saying this
because he's politically nervous,'' says Avenson, a veteran
politician of 18 years in the state Legislature, eight as speaker.
   In an era when many polls show voters leery of government,
Avenson, who is 46, takes an activist role.
   ``We don't need more government, we need more of the government
we have,'' he said. ``I think we need to let government go, unleash
it and let it do its job. We need to find ways to make government
work again.
   ``In the last 10 years, we've grown older, smaller and poorer,''
he says. ``If he were a football coach, they would have fired him a
long time ago for that kind of a record.''
   That approach may not be effective, with the state's economy
stronger than during the depths of a farm-based recession
throughout the 1980s.
   ``Our goal in the '90s is to continue the economic comeback that
we began in the past few years,'' says Branstad.
   Avenson admits he has big hurdles to overcome and points to the
growing Branstad presence on television.
   ``They are going to inundate this state,'' said Avenson. ``He
just doubled that. I cannot double my effort. I don't have the
money.''
   Another wild card in the election is abortion rights, supported
by Avenson and opposed by Branstad.
   With polls showing that two-thirds of Iowans consider themselves
pro-choice, Avenson hoped that would translate into votes. He
conceded that his private polling shows pro-choice voters still
split between the two candidates and not familiar with their
positions.
   While Branstad takes an anti-abortion position, he hasn't asked
the Legislature to impose restrictions and he picked a pro-choice
woman - state Sen. Joy Corning - as his running mate.
   ``I don't want to tear this state apart over an emotional
issue,'' Branstad argues.
   ``You see, the anti-choice vote, all of them, support Terry
Branstad,'' said Avenson. ``But the pro-choice vote hasn't come all
the way over because I haven't made it clear.
   ``We will cause that movement to take place because we will make
it very clear,'' said Avenson.
   Other activists argue the issue will help pro-choice candidates,
but only around the fringes.
   Iowa Democratic Chairman John Roehrick said movement will come
as independent voters focus in the final weeks.
   ``We've still got five weeks to go until the election,'' said
Roehrick. ``I don't think it will be the only issue. I think it
means two to four points.''

<HEAD>Bush Wants to Lift Nuclear Ban as Condition for Aid to Pakistan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush wants to keep U.S. aid flowing
to Pakistan even though there is evidence the country is violating
rules against nuclear weapons proliferation, administration and
congressional sources say.
   Senior State Department officials are working on Capitol Hill to
lift the legal requirement that bars Pakistan, the third largest
recipient of U.S. aid, from getting any money if it presses ahead
with nuclear bomb development.
   U.S. aid to Pakistan technically came to a halt Monday, the
beginning of the 1991 fiscal year, because Bush had not issued the
required annual certification that Pakistan does not possess a
nuclear bomb and that continued U.S. aid will reduce the prospect
for development of atomic weapons.
   Pakistan has scheduled national elections for Oct. 24 to replace
the government of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who was
removed from office two months ago amid charges of corruption.
   The administration wants to give the new government that emerges
after those elections time to curb or roll back the country's
nuclear weapons program before making a decision on cutting off
aid, said sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Senior administration officials, including Undersecretary of
State Reginald Bartholomew and Deputy Assistant Secretary Teresita
Schaffer, went to Capitol Hill last week to ask for a waiver. The
idea was received coolly among key House officials, including Rep.
David Obey, D-Wis., chairman of the foreign aid appropriations
subcommittee; and Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the
subcommittee on Asia.
   The administration, which typically finds a warmer welcome in
the Senate, is hoping it can pursue the waiver there, either as an
amendment to the foreign aid bill that comes up for committee
consideration today or on another bill before Congress adjourns
later this month.
   Leonard Spector, a weapons proliferation analyst at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace, said policymakers appear afraid
to assert U.S. values. Adopting a waiver, he said, would mean ``we
are in effect announcing to the world that Pakistan has nuclear
weapons, and we just don't care.''
   But an administration official said it is prudent to withhold
judgment on the certification until after ``we get beyond this
point of flux and set up a dialogue with the new government.''
While the White House would like to see a year-long waiver, it will
settle for six months, the official said.
   ``Nobody's jumping up and down about it, but they are
sympathetic and they understand the seriousness of the issue,'' the
official added.
   Pakistan has provided the base for covert U.S. aid to Afghan
rebels in the 1980s, and also has promised troops to help defend
Saudi Arabia from Iraq.
   Bhutto, who was warmly received when she promised her country
would not develop a nuclear bomb during a 1989 speech to Congress,
was removed from power on Aug. 6. While she is among those vying
for control in the new elections, analysts say she is unlikely to
regain power.
   U.S.-Pakistani relations have benn shaky since Bhutto's ouster.
   A minister in the caretaker cabinet urged that U.S. Ambassador
Robert Oakley be recalled for questioning the impartiality of
tribunals looking into government corruption, and Pakistan lodged
an official protest of his remarks.
   Sources on Capitol Hill and others with access to top Pakistani
officials said there are fears that Pakistan has produced enriched
uranium in a form that could be the basis for a bomb, stepping over
the line that both sides understood would trigger an aid cutoff.
   At the State Department, spokesman Richard Boucher said only
that the question of whether to issue the presidential
certification is ``still under review'' and that aid cannot be
provided until a certification is issued.
   Pakistan received nearly $580 million in U.S. military and
economic aid in fiscal 1990, making it the third largest recipient
of American largess, after Israel and Egypt. Similar amounts have
been requested for this year.
   The administration has quietly told Pakistan's interim
government that it must roll back the nuclear steps taken this
year, said one source. Those moves have the effect of reducing the
time it would take Pakistan to field nuclear weapons from a matter
of months to a matter of weeks, several sources said.
   Bomb-making requires enriching uranium hexafluoride, a gas, then
solidifying it into a metal that is milled into a hollow sphere for
use as a bomb core. Pakistan already has taken some of those steps,
the sources said.

   Kuwaiti families gather each day in hotel
lobbies on this small island nation. The adults are depressed and
uncertain about their homeland's future; their children troubled by
nightmares.
   ``We pass our time, day after day, reading newspapers, meeting
other Kuwaitis, thinking and praying,'' said a Kuwaiti lawyer who
brought his mother and sisters to Bahrain.
   ``We are depressed and idle. We are emotionally very tired.''
   But a 10-year-old Kuwaiti boy said he knew what to do: wait
until his 12th birthday, then join the underground resistance and
die killing Iraqi soldiers.
   The boy's aunt said ``all he does is talk about killing Iraqis,
and dying himself.''
   A 10-year-old girl with dark circles under her eyes has suffered
frequent nightmares since the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   ``I don't know how to comfort her,'' said her mother. ``We keep
telling her she is in Bahrain, not Kuwait. But she is still
frightened.''
   The two children are among the thousands of Kuwaitis who fled to
Bahrain, about 180 miles south in the Persian Gulf.
   The Kuwaitis in Bahrain, once enjoying one of the world's
highest standards of living, now must depend on their savings
outside Kuwait as well as help from friendly Arab governments.
   The Kuwaitis interviewed spoke on condition their full names not
be used, seeking to avoid possible reprisals by Iraqi forces
against family members remaining in Kuwait.
   ``We threw away our passports and ID cards. We were told there
would be strict inspections on the way out,'' said one woman
sitting in a hotel lobby. The Kuwaitis are placed by their embassy
at hotels in Manama until their identities can be verified. Until
then, they cannot collect full benefits from their
government-in-exile or put their children in school.
   Instead of school, the children gather in the lobbies with their
mothers and spend most of the time drawing or playing. Their games
almost always involve shooting and fighting.
   ``Their attitudes have changed,'' a Kuwaiti woman said of the
children. ``They draw soldiers, tanks, and blood. They have lost
the carefree spirit they once had.''
   ``We are trying to raise the morale of everyone, and we have
social workers going from hotel to hotel trying to pinpoint those
suffering from severe psychological problems,'' said a social
worker at the Kuwaiti Embassy in Bahrain. ``But sometimes their
dignity will not let them come forward to ask people for help.''
   In a radio broadcast heard in Bahrain, the exiled crown prince
of Kuwait, Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, on Monday hailed the
refugees for ``heroic steadfastness in the face of the despot of
Baghdad,'' a reference to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   ``Do not despair of the crimes of the brutal aggressor, for he
will not be able to destroy your will nor weaken your resolve and
resistance,'' said Sheik Saad. His exiled government is now based
in neighboring Saudi Arabia.
   ``History has not seen such world unanimity in support of a
cause as that given to the just one of Kuwait, to tightening the
noose around the Iraqi occupation until its forces pull out by
peace or war,'' the sheik said.
   Abdullah, chairman of the Information Committee at the Kuwaiti
Embassy in Bahrain, said he sometimes chats with friends and
momentarily forgets the troubles.
   ``But, when we go to our beds and put our heads on the pillow
and think about what's happening, we almost go crazy from the pain.
   ``How are we coping psychologically? Through hope. The hope that
we will return to our country soon.''

   The man destined to become the
oldest person to fly in space is not getting any younger as he
waits - and waits and waits - for NASA to fix and launch the
shuttle Columbia.
   But the on-again, off-again launch doesn't have 59-year-old
Vance Brand worrying whether if he's past it.
   ``Only if you let problems really get you down do you feel
older,'' Brand, commander of Columbia's astronomy mission, said
Monday.
   ``We're just all having to be very patient,'' he said. ``Time is
passing. But I don't think it's hurting any of us, just the sake of
the shuttle program. I'd just like to get going.''
   Brand's mission has been on hold since late May, when Columbia's
hydrogen leaks first were detected. NASA tried three more times to
launch the shuttle before stopping two weeks ago to make way for
Discovery's high-priority flight.
   Discovery lifts off Saturday with five astronauts and a
satellite that will be sent on a five-year journey to study the
sun's poles. It will be the first shuttle flight since Discovery
carried the flawed Hubble Space Telescope into orbit in April.
   ``I'll be a little jealous'' watching Discovery go up, Brand
said in a telephone interview from Johnson Space Center in Houston.
``But we'll get there.''
   Brand, an astronaut since 1966, made his first space flight in
1975 on the Apollo-Soyuz mission, in which the crews of the
American and Soviet spacecraft docked in space. He has flown in
space two other times.
   Brand said he isn't any more nervous about flying on a shuttle
than he was before hydrogen leaks struck Columbia and then
Atlantis.
   Crew member Mike Lounge, while frustrated, also takes it in
stride.
   ``You just go home and mow your lawn and pay your bills and take
a little leave. We're still getting paid,'' Lounge, 44, said. ``We
don't get a lot of sympathy about what an awful job we have here.''
   Brand figured he and his six crewmates have broken at least one
record while waiting to fly - the most time spent in quarantine for
a mission. The seven men have been confined to crew quarters for a
week before each launch attempt, adding up to about a month.
   ``We've had the supreme test, and we all get along great,''
Brand said.
   ``I'd like to be an astronaut until I'm 80,'' Brand said. ``But
I think when I finish this flight, there will just be a switch that
flips in my head that says, `OK, you're going after your second
career and it's going to have its own challenges and interesting
things, so let's get with that.' ''
   Brand plans to move into management at Johnson Space Center
after the Columbia mission.

<HEAD>Despite Scandalous Past, Lottery Idea May Prevail in Louisiana</HEAD>

   A century after a crooked Louisiana
lottery bilked an entire nation, voters in this state will decide
whether to give a new one a chance.
   Louisiana voters will consider a constitutional amendment
Saturday ending the state's ban on lotteries. Louisiana stands to
become the 33rd state to enact a lottery to help finance state
government.
   The Legislature already has passed a bill establishing a
quasi-public corporation, answerable to lawmakers and the governor,
to operate the games.
   Despite opposition from Gov. Buddy Roemer, the horse racing
industry and others who question its economic value, recent polls
favor passage.
   ``It's a good alternative to the sales tax,'' said state Rep.
Raymond Lalonde, who sponsored the measure in the House. ``The
lottery will bring as much as a penny (in sales tax) on milk and
bread.''
   Opponents led by the Coalition Against Legalizing a Lottery
argue a lottery would drain money from the state's weak economy and
take advantage of the poor.
   ``It's a senseless leech on our economy. It's a pernicious
cancer on the pocketbooks of the poor,'' said Ed Steimel, a
coalition spokesman.
   But proponents are so confident of passage that an organization
to push for a lottery was formed only in the past few weeks after
an anti-gambling group began a grass-roots campaign.
   Meanwhile, voters in neighboring Arkansas will consider adopting
a lottery on Nov. 6 to boost education funding.
   Opponents, including church leaders who denounce it on moral
grounds, hope to get the state Supreme Court to rule it off the
ballot. A poll commissioned by the Arkansas Democrat and reported
last week found that 52 percent favor the lottery, 36 percent
oppose it and 12 percent are undecided.
   Since Louisiana's economy declined along with oil prices in the
1980s, the Legislature has routinely renewed a sales tax on food
and utilities to balance the state's books. Such items were
traditionally exempt from the sales tax.
   Lotteries have been banned by the Louisiana Constitution since a
scandal-plagued private lottery operated in the state during the
late 1800s. Tickets for that operation were sold all over the
United States, and the people who had been duped complained to
Washington.
   In 1890, President Benjamin Harrison addressed a special message
to Congress, asking for relief because ``the people of all the
states are debauched and defrauded ... by the Louisiana lottery.''
   Congress responded with legislation that blocked the use of the
mail for selling lottery tickets. Since the lottery sold as much as
93 percent of its tickets outside Louisiana, the enterprise
collapsed. That postal prohibition still applies today.
   Because of the debacle, there has been deep-rooted opposition to
a lottery in Louisiana for years. But favorable sentiment has been
growing.
   Estimates of state revenue for the first full year range from
$59 million to $111 million, according to the Public Affairs
Research Council, a research and government watchdog group.
   But Steimel said that for the state to net $110 million annually
from a lottery, at least $300 million would have to be wagered -
money that otherwise would go into the private economy.
   ``We have an economy that is in real deep trouble,'' he said.
``Instead of a transfusion, we're getting a blood sucker.''

   Two months after Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein forced a gasoline price increase of about 25 cents a
gallon, the U.S. government is moving to tack on another 12 cents.
   A gradual 10-cent increase in the 9-cent-a-gallon tax and a new
2-cent levy on refined petroleum productions, including gasoline,
is one of the biggest items in a $500 billion, five-year plan for
reducing the budget deficit. The energy taxes would raise almost
$57 billion.
   The Energy Information Administration said Monday the price of
self-service, regular unleaded gasoline averaged $1.311 a gallon on
Sept. 27, compared with $1.075 July 31, two days before Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait disrupted oil markets.
   The budget proposal, backed by President Bush and leaders of
both parties, relies heavily on excise taxes and makes few changes
in income taxes.
   As a result, analysts say, the impact is likely to be felt most
by poorer, younger and rural families, who spend a larger portion
of their disposable income on gasoline, tobacco and alcoholic
beverages.
   Other parts of the plan target fliers; state and local
government employees; workers whose wages exceed $51,300; taxpayers
with incomes over $100,000, and anyone with a taste for expensive
cars, furs and jewels.
   The proposal also would mean more Internal Revenue Service
audits in an effort to corral more tax cheats and raise $9.4
billion.
   Earlier this year, the Congressional Budget Office found that
Americans spend 2.7 percent of after-tax income on gasoline, 1.1
percent on tobacco and 2 percent for liquor, wine and beer.
   The poorest 20 percent, with after-tax income averaging $8,200 -
spent 6.9 percent for gasoline, 4 percent on tobacco and 3.7
percent for alcohol. The 20 percent just below the richest, with
income averaging $38,000 after taxes, spent 2.9 percent for
gasoline, 1.1 percent for tobacco and 2.2 percent for alcohol.
   Here are some major parts of the tax plan, which congressional
leaders hope will become law this month:
   ENERGY: The federal gasoline tax of 9 cents a gallon would rise
by 5 cents Dec. 1 and another 5 cents next July 1. On Jan. 1, a
2-cent-a-gallon tax on most refined petroleum products, including
gasoline and home heating oil, would take effect. Almost 94 percent
of families buy gasoline.
   TOBACCO: The 16-cent-a-pack tax on cigarettes would rise 4 cents
on Jan. 1 and another 4 cents two years later. Taxes on cigars,
chewing tobacco and snuff would be increased at each step by 25
percent. About 46 percent of Americans use tobacco.
   ALCOHOL: About 71 percent of taxpayers would be affected. The
tax on hard liquor, now $12.50 for a gallon of 100 proof (50
percent alcohol), would rise to $14, up 30 cents for a fifth.
Lower-proof liquor would go up by the same ratio. The tax on beer,
now 16 cents for a six-pack, would double. Most wines also would
face higher taxes. The 3-cent tax on a fifth of table wine would
rise to 25 cents.
   AIRLINE TICKETS: More than 1.2 million passengers fly each day.
The 8 percent tax would rise to 10 percent. On the average
round-trip ticket, costing about $300, the tax would go up about
$6.
   LUXURIES: A 10 percent luxury tax would apply to the portion of
the sales price of certain commodities above certain thresholds.
For cars, the threshold would be $30,000; for private boats,
$100,000; for jewelry and furs, $5,000. The buyer of a $35,000 car
would pay a tax of $500 (10 percent of $5,000).
   ITEMIZED DEDUCTIONS: A couple or individual with adjusted gross
income above $100,000 could continue to deduct all allowable
medical expenses and investment interest expense. But they would
have to reduce other deductions by $3 for each $100 that their
income exceeds $100,000. A person with $120,000 income and $20,000
in allowable deductions, for example, could deduct 97 percent, or
$19,400. About 2.5 million people would be affected.
   MEDICARE WAGES: About 8 million workers earning more than
$51,300 would pay more tax for Medicare coverage. The tax (withheld
from paychecks as part of the Social Security levy) is 1.45 percent
of the first $51,300 earned each year. That wage limit would be
raised to $73,000, meaning a $315-a-year tax increase. Employers
match employees' taxes.
   About 2 million employees of state and local government hired
before April 1, 1986, who do not now pay for Medicare, would be
required to pay the 1.45 percent tax for the first time.
   SOCIAL SECURITY: About 4 million state and local workers not
covered by a public retirement plan would have to start paying the
6.2 percent Social Security tax on their first $51,300 of wages.
The employer would pay an equal amount.
   EDUCATION: The guaranteed student loan program would be trimmed
by $2 billion. Negotiators suggested eliminating all schools with
default rates above 30 percent, which officials acknowledge would
include many trade and vocational schools, as well as historically
black colleges.
   AGRICULTURE: Agriculture programs would be cut by $13 billion,
which is one-fourth of the $54 billion being sought for the next
five years.
   POST OFFICE: The price of stamps would rise faster because the
Postal Service would absorb about $5 billion in cuts over the next
five years.

<HEAD>Arts Endowment Survives Threat in House Panel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The National Endowment for the Arts emerged
unscathed from an assault by House critics but faces a floor battle
later this week over attempts to impose new anti-obscenity curbs.
   By voice vote Monday, the House Appropriations Committee
resoundingly defeated a proposal by Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, to
eliminate all funds for the federal arts agency until Congress
votes separately to extend the NEA's life.
   Rep. Sidney Yates, D-Ill., and other endowment supporters on the
panel said a vote for DeLay's amendment would be a vote to abolish
the 25-year-old agency. DeLay is among the NEA's most vocal
conservative opponents.
   The committee voted to give the endowment a 5 percent spending
increase in the fiscal year that began Monday, from $171 million to
$180 million. And it persuaded Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, to
withdraw a proposal to forbid the NEA to finance any obscene or
indecent works.
   Instead, at the urging of Yates and Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif.,
the committee sidestepped the ``obscene art'' issue in favor of
House action on a separate measure authorizing a five-year
extension of the NEA's life.
   Floor debate on that measure was tentatively scheduled to begin
Wednesday or Thursday. The endowment's statutory authority expired
Sunday night.
   Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., a staunch NEA supporter, and Rep. E.
Thomas Coleman, R-Mo., a conservative who is seeking restrictions
on the kinds of art eligible for endowment support, circulated the
outlines of a proposed compromise among their House colleagues
Monday.
   Their proposal reportedly would embrace a bipartisan Senate
measure that would require the NEA to recoup money from any grant
recipient who is convicted in court of using federal funds to
violate obscenity laws.
   Fazio said the compromise also would call for increasing to 27.5
percent the share of NEA grant money allocated to state arts
agencies.
   The current state share is 20 percent. Coleman originally had
sought to shift 60 percent of NEA funds to state control.
   For the time being, the arts endowment is operating under a
temporary extension of last year's $171 million spending level,
until Congress approves appropriations bills for the NEA and other
federal agencies for fiscal 1991, which began Monday.
   That means the endowment is still working under an obscenity ban
that Congress imposed last fall at the request of Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., and other conservative lawmakers. They were angered by NEA
support for exhibitions of works by photographer Robert
Mapplethorpe and artist Andres Serrano which they denounced as
obscene and blasphemous.
   The proposed $180 million budget for the NEA was included in a
$14.5 billion appropriations bill that the House committee approved
by voice vote Monday and sent to the floor. The measure also
includes money for the Interior and Energy departments, the Forest
Service, the Smithsonian Institution and the National Endowment for
the Humanities.

<HEAD>Senior Citizens Oppose Cut in Medicare Benefits</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Senior citizens say the proposed deficit
reduction package that would increase Medicare premiums and
deductibles requires them to shoulder more than their fair share of
budget cuts.
   ``The (budget) summiteers have declared budget war on the
elderly,'' said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA,
which represents the elderly.
   ``Those that wage this war shouldn't expect older Americans to
be pacifists on election day,'' he said.
   Of the $119 billion in domestic programs that would be saved
over the next five years under the budget compromise, $60 billion
would come from Medicare.
   Half of the savings in the health care program would be achieved
by requiring its beneficiaries - 33 million elderly and disabled
Americans - to pay more out of their own pockets for medical
services.
   Their $28.60 monthly premium for doctors' care would rise to
$34.30 next year; their $75 deductible on doctors' bills would
double by 1995; and a 20 percent co-payment for laboratory costs
would be restored.
   The rest of the savings - about $30 billion - would come from
cutting growth in reimbursement rates for hospitals and physicians.
   ``We're very disappointed that seniors have beensingled out for
this unfair tax treatment,'' said Martha A. McSteen, president of
the National Committee to Preserve Social Security.
   The American Association of Retired Persons was concerned about
the size of the Medicare cuts as well as protections for the poor.
   ``It's clearly going to take a very big hit,'' said Judy Schub,
a legislative representative for AARP.
   Instead, the government should ``resort to the progressive
income tax,'' said Arthur Flemming, a Republican and head of the
Save Our Security coalition of elderly lobbying groups. ``Change it
so it puts a heavier burden on the wealthy.''
   President Bush, asked about senior citizens' displeasure with
the plan, said Monday, ``Well, what are you going to do? You can't
keep everybody happy. I learned that long ago. You've got to do
what's right. That's what we're trying to do.''
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., defended the plan, saying
the Medicare program has been the fastest rising cost of any
federal entitlement program.
   AARP and the other senior citizens' groups were relieved that
budget negotiators decided against cuts that would affect Social
Security recipients. They had considered proposals to delay cost of
living adjustments and to tax a larger portion of Social Security
benefits.
   Gail Wilensky, head of the Health Care Financing Administration,
which handles Medicare, said the compromise package protects the
poorest elderly by continuing for them Medicaid coverage of
Medicare's out-of-pocket costs.
   Also, she noted, all Medicare beneficiaries will be protected by
a provision passed by Congress last year limiting the amount
physicians can charge beyond what Medicare will pay. That limit
will be 25 percent on Jan. 1 and will drop to 15 percent by 1993.
   Additionally, she said, the higher cost-sharing for recipients
is still far less than it was when the program began in 1965. Then,
beneficiaries paid 50 percent of the cost of premiums for doctors'
care. Now, it is 25 percent but would rise to 30 percent under the
budget compromise.
   ``I do believe you can say these are reasonable and justified
changes,'' Wilensky said.
   Also as part of the package, higher paid workers would see the
1.45 percent tax that helps support the Medicare program apply to a
larger part of their income. Currently, the tax is applied only to
the first $51,300 of income, but under the agreement it would be
applied to the first $73,000.
   Wilensky said this would help extend the solvency of the
Medicare trust fund, which could go bankrupt in the early part of
the next century if changes are not made.

   Hundreds of Lucy lookalikes and near-Desis
are out of luck. Two professional actors, Maurice Benard and
Frances Fisher, will play the wacky couple in a TV movie.
   The two were introduced Monday as the stars of ``Lucy and Desi:
Before the Laughter.''
   Hundreds of lookalikes, many of them amateurs, turned out for
cattle calls in New York, Miami and Los Angeles during the search
for the perfect Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz.
   Miss Fisher, who bears little resemblance to Miss Ball without
makeup, has appeared in the TV movies ``Cold Sassy Tree,'' ``Home''
and ``Broken Vows.''
   Benard, who played Nico Kelly on the soap opera ``All My
Children,'' looks a little like a young Arnaz.
   Benard is practicing on a conga. ``It's big shoes to fill. I'm
an actor. I'm not an impersonator. But he's a lot like my father,''
Benard said.
   CBS plans to broadcast the movie in February. It covers the
couple's private life from 1940 to the night they filmed the first
episode of ``I Love Lucy,'' which premiered in 1951.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Gov. Mario Cuomo got a high-five from a young
paisan.
   The governor appeared Monday with the Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles - Michelangelo, Leonardo, Donatello and Raphael - and
thanked them for help with a new drug prevention program.
   ``And I love their names,'' Cuomo said.
   Michelangelo dubbed Cuomo ``your honorable dudeship'' during a
ceremony at a grade school.
   ``Anybody here know the Ninja Turtles?'' the governor asked a
gymnasium filled with squealing first-, second- and third-graders.
He got a deafening, affirmative response. ``Man, I hope they don't
run for office,'' Cuomo said.
   Donatello high-fived Cuomo before the pizza-loving, TV turtles
performed their anti-drug song, ``Walk Straight.''
   The turtles recently launched a singing career and a national
tour.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Teen-age actor Corey Feldman pleaded innocent
to heroin possession and got another warning to stay in drug abuse
treatment.
   A Municipal Court commissioner on Monday ordered Feldman to
remain in a rehabilitation program as a condition of his $5,000
bail.
   The 19-year-old actor, who appeared in the movies ``Goonies,''
``Stand by Me'' and ``Gremlins,'' has been in a residential drug
abuse program since Sept. 21, when he was arrested on a heroin
possession charge for the second time.
   Feldman got a similar admonition in Superior Court last week
during a hearing on the first charge after he failed to appear for
a hearing.

   NEW YORK (AP) - For Cybill Shepherd and Peter Bogdanovich, the
movie ``Texasville'' was a trip home.
   Nineteen years after Bogdanovich left his wife, Polly Platt, for
Shepherd on the set of ``The Last Picture Show,'' the three were
reunited in Archer City, Texas, during the making of the sequel.
   ``Even though I wasn't born or raised in Archer City, that's
where my career began,'' Shepherd said in the Oct. 8 issue of
People magazine. ``So it was like going home again.''
   Platt came briefly to the set to visit her daughter, Antonia
Bogdanovich, 22, a still photographer for ``Texasville.''
   ``It was just so satisfying to give up that pain,'' Platt said
of the reunion. ``It was the most bizarre experience, but to me it
was exhilarating. Who ever gets a chance to go back?''
   The three say they're just friends now.

   LONDON (AP) - Princess Alexandra, a cousin of Queen Elizabeth
II, will visit Southern California this month.
   The princess will attend the opening of the Festival of Britain,
which will be held Oct. 11-17 in Orange County, a spokeswoman for
her said Monday.
   Married to businessman Angus Ogilvy, the 53-year-old Alexandra
is a popular member of the British royal family but shuns the
limelight.
   Her father, Prince George, was killed in a flying accident
during World War II when she was 5. The princess and her two
brothers were raised by their mother, Princess Marina.
   Alexandra, trained as a nurse, has traveled around the world on
royal visits. She was last in the United States on an official
visit in 1987 as guest of honor at a dinner at the National Gallery
of Art in Washington.

<HEAD>Senate Votes Halt to Overseas Construction Projects</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate is calling a halt to military
construction projects overseas until President Bush draws up a plan
for basing a smaller military force.
   By voice vote on Monday, the Senate approved an $8 billion
spending bill for fiscal 1991 that eliminates most of the projects
Bush proposed for Europe and deletes all construction in South
Korea and Japan.
   ``It would be premature to proceed with construction at
specified locations until the Defense Department has finalized
overseas base closure plans,'' the Senate Appropriations
subcommittee on military construction said in its report on the
bill.
   The bill trims $1.1 billion from Bush's budget request for the
fiscal year that began Monday. It is about $400 million below the
amount approved by the House. Conferees from the two chambers will
meet later this month to craft a compromise measure.
   The Senate bill cuts $151 million from Bush's budget of $153
million for West Germany, $43 million from the request of $44
million for Italy and $46 million from the budget of $47 million
for Britain.
   The bill eliminated all $83 million the administration sought
for South Korean projects and all $18 million for Japan.
   ``The Defense Department should seek host-nation funding for all
construction requirements in those countries,'' the subcommittee
report said.
   Certain to draw the ire of the Bush administration is a
provision of the bill that prevents the use of U.S. dollars from
the NATO Infrastructure Fund and the Air Force for construction of
new air base in Crotone, Italy, to house the 401st Tactical Wing of
F-16 jet fighters.
   The United States and its allies agreed to build the new
facility in Italy after Spain refused to allow the fighter wing to
remain at the U.S. base in Torrejon de Ardoz, Spain.
   The committee report said ``financing for a new $800 million
foreign air base is simply not available when dozens of domestic
bases are being closed.''
   Domestically, Missouri and Washington state were hit hard as the
Senate targeted construction projects associated with the B-2
stealth bomber and the plan to place MX nuclear missiles on
railroad cars.
   In Missouri, the bill cut $41 million from the administration's
budget request, including $9 million for B-2 maintenance docks.
Washington lost $93 million in construction projects, including $73
million for rail garrison facilities.
   The Senate was kinder in the home states of several of the
subcommittee's members.
   In Utah, home of Republican Sen. Jake Garn, construction
projects increased $40 million. Funds for Georgia, home state of
Democratic Sen. Wyche Fowler, increased $30 million, including $10
million for a soldier service center at Fort Gordon.
   In Alaska, home of Republican Sen. Ted Stevens, the bill adds
$13 million over the administration's request. In Hawaii, home of
Democratic Sen. Daniel Inouye, the bill added $2 million. The same
amount went to Nevada, home of Democratic Sen. Harry Reid.
   In Iowa, home of the subcommittee's ranking Republican, Sen.
Charles Grassley, funds for military construction were $14 million
over the administration's request.
   But in Tennessee, home of the panel's chairman, Democratic Sen.
James Sasser, funds for projects dropped $43 million with all the
money coming from a large rocket test facility at the Arnold
Engineering Development Center.
   In West Virginia, home of the chairman of the full Senate
Appropriations Committee, Sen. Robert Byrd, projects for the Army
National Guard, Army Reserve and Air National Guard were increased
$26 million.

   Synchronized leasing. A fancy name for moving
hell.
   Not enough vans. Not enough crews. Not enough room on the
streets for thousands of Chicago apartment dwellers who pack up and
head for new digs at the same time twice each year when their
leases expire simultaneously.
   Monday, Oct. 1, was one of those days. May 1 is the other.
   ``We started at 10 a.m. and it is now 4 p.m.,'' said Jim
Marchesi, who had to maneuver his rental truck around four others
on his North Side block Sunday. ``I have only had to move about
five blocks, and it feels like I have moved from five different
countries.''
   So-called ``synchronized leasing'' has been around a long time,
but most cities abandoned the practice. No one seems to know why it
lingered in Chicago, but many people believe it may have something
to do with the city's weather.
   ``No one in their right mind wants to move in a Chicago summer
or a Chicago winter,'' said leasing agent Tom Lucido.
   ``By May 1 it's usually warm - but not hot - and the weather
really does change significantly from September to October. By Oct.
1, it's cool - but not cold.''
   Synchronized leasing, Lucido said, is horrendous.
   ``The typical nightmare is that you have a tenant whose lease
expires Sept. 30, and they haven't moved out yet when the new
tenant's supposed to move in Oct. 1,'' he said. ``You end up with a
tenant sitting out there in a moving van with no place to go.''
   Commonwealth Edison Co. and Peoples Gas Co. estimated that more
than 50,000 rental units were up for tenant changes on or about
Oct. 1. A similar number of moves were made about May 1.
   ``You can't get a truck. You can't get a mover. You can't get an
elevator,'' said Joel Kline. ``You're moving into an apartment
someone's moving out of. You're moving out of an apartment
someone's moving into. It's just terrible.''
   Kline was among the lucky. He got a four-day lease extension.
   ``It's been total chaos,'' said Dave Beard, assistant manager of
a U-Haul outlet. ``We never seem to have enough equipment come May
and October. People get frustrated. There are attitude problems.''
   Chicago Student Movers, which uses leased trucks and a temporary
work force of college students to provide inexpensive moving for
apartment dwellers, averages 10 moves a day most monts. It had 80
Sunday. More were lined up for Monday.
   Company owner Guy Wojciechowski said he brought in 155
additional trucks and hired 100 extra men to handle the business.
   Truck and trailer rental companies recommend reservations at
least several weeks in advance of the May 1 and Oct. 1 deadlines.
But many renters never seem to learn.
   ``Simply put, if they reserved a truck weeks in advance, they're
very happy people,'' said Charlotte Adams, who works for Ryder
Truck Rental. ``If they just walk in hoping to get one, they're
very unhappy people.''
   Some accuse landlords and real estate agents of clinging to
synchronized leasing to manipulate the availability and price of
rental housing, but Lucido maintained it really doesn't benefit
building owners and managers.
   ``When the worst happens, and the October renter can't move in,
you have to provide him with emergency housing - rent free - until
you manage to get the old tenant out,'' he said. ``By law, it takes
21 days to get eviction proceedings going, and the sheriff's
department is always backed up three or four weeks this time of
year, so you can wind up losing several months' rent.''

   The deregulatory policies of the Reagan
administration helped contain the savings and loan crisis, former
Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan is telling skeptical
congressional Democrats.
   ``I think the thrift industry would have gone into the tank
sooner and may have never emerged,'' Regan told the House Banking
Committee at the first in a series of hearings on the causes of the
S&amp;L mess.
   Regan, who was Treasury secretary from 1981 to 1985, said that
after interest rates soared in the early 1980s it became clear that
a financial business confined to taking deposits from savers and
lending the money to home buyers could not survive.
   He said he had favored giving thrifts the same investment powers
as commercial banks, but had opposed the broader deregulation in
some states that had given thrifts non-bank powers.
   The committee also heard on Monday from Richard T. Pratt, who
served as the nation's top thrift regulator from 1981 to 1982.
Pratt defended his decision to allow S&amp;Ls to hide their losses with
accounting techniques.
   Pratt said when he took office, nearly every S&amp;L in the country
was technically insolvent because soaring interest rates had
drastically cut the value of their low-interest, fixed-rate
mortgages.
   Regulators' strategy was to close the worst institutions and to
buy time for the others until interest rates fell, as they did, he
said.
   Panel members pressed Regan, who was chairman of Merrill Lynch
before becoming treasury secretary, on his involvement with the
development of so-called brokered deposits.
   Such high-interest deposits, placed by Wall Street brokerage
houses, usually in amounts just under the $100,000 deposit
insurance limit, are blamed for fueling the explosive growth in
risky investments at many S&amp;Ls.
   Regan, however, said he had disqualified himself from any policy
matters affecting brokered deposits because of his connection to
Merrill Lynch. He said the firm did not deal in them extensively
until after he left.
   ``I want a blood test as far as being the father of brokered
deposits. I am not - in no way, shape or fashion,'' he said.
   Rep. Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass., countered that Regan allowed his
subordinate, Deputy Treasury Secretary R.T. McNamar, to forcefully
advocate their use.
   Edwin Gray, the nation's top thrift regulator from 1983 to 1987,
has accused Regan of trying to force him from office when he tried
to rein in the industry in general and brokered deposits in
particular.
   Regan, who previously had not had a chance to reply to Gray in a
public forum, described him as an absentee, lax regulator.
   ``In 1985, when I became (White House) chief of staff, I began
to hear rumors that this man was not paying attention; he was part
of the problem, not the solution. ... He was sort of a front for
the industry. I didn't like that,'' Regan said.
   He said that between September 1983 and June 1986, Gray was in
his office only 397 weekdays and absent 466 days. He also noted
that Gray was forced to repay his agency, the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board, $26,000 for travel and entertainment.
   ``He want to Pebble Beach. He went to Greenbriar. My crack was,
`I think he's working more on his (golf) handicap than he's working
on the thrifts,''' Regan said.
   Gray and former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker are
scheduled to appear before the committee Wednesday. The committee
chairman, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, plans to hear from
Carter administration officials later.
   In other S&amp;L developments Monday:
   -Federal regulators said they had transferred most offices of
the Phoenix-based Merabank to Bank of America, estimating the
bailout of the thrift - once Arizona's largest - at $1 billion.
   Bank of America Arizona, a subsidiary of the San Francisco-based
holding company, is taking over Merabank's 66 Arizona branches, the
Resolution Trust Corp. said. The agency will keep Merabank's seven
Texas branches for later sale.
   -Texas and California savings and loans dominate a list of the
top 100 federal thrift investigations by the Justice Department,
National Mortgage News, a weekly trade newspaper, reported.
   There were 36 Texas S&amp;Ls on the list, which has not been
publicly released, and 20 from California. Oklahoma and Illinois
and eight institutions listed, Florida had six; Colorado, five, and
Louisiana and New Jersey, four each.

<HEAD>Plane Crashes Near Canton After Apparent Hijacking</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES thruout with details of crash, airport closed. No

<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Chinese passenger jet traveling between two
southern provinces on a domestic flight crashed Tuesday after the
Boeing 737 apparently was hijacked, officials said.
   Airport officials at Canton international airport said the crash
occurred near the large southern city that is capital of Guangdong
province. Hong Kong radio, quoting the Canton People's Broadcasting
Station, said the plane, carrying 90 passengers, ``collided'' with
two other planes at the airport.
   There was no immediate explanation for the conflicting
information.
   The radio report said there were survivors but gave no further
details. Officials at the airport said it was closed soon after the
8 a.m. crash. Hong Kong is about 70 miles southeast of Canton.
   The flight apparently originated from the Fujian province city
of Xiamen, which is north of Guangdong province. Its destination
was not immediately known, but according to airline schedules the
only plane due to leave Xiamen early this morning was a Boeing 737
bound for Shanghai.
   An airport official and a reporter for the Guangdong People's
Broadcasting Station said they believed the plane, owned by China's
state airline CAAC, was first hijacked before it crashed.
   Richard Stites, a spokesman at the U.S. Consulate in Canton,
said the consulate had not been notified about any Americans on
board.
   In Beijing, officials at the state airline's headquarters
refused to even confirm the crash. Editors at various official news
media in the capital said they had no information on it.
   No further details were immediately available.

<HEAD>House Panel Votes to Continue Ban on Offshore Drilling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices may be soaring and America's
dependence on foreign petroleum may be all too clear, but a key
congressional panel says those aren't reasons enough to open the
nation's coastal waters to oil drilling.
   The House Appropriations Committee voted Monday to extend for a
year the wide-reaching prohibition on oil and gas leasing along
thousands of miles of coastal waters from Alaska to New England.
   The moratorium on the leasing was included in the Interior
Department's budget and goes even farther than the curbs on
drilling announced by President Bush last June.
   ``This was the first real test to protecting the offshore areas
since Iraq invaded Kuwait,'' said Lisa Speer, an attorney for the
Natural Resources Defense Council, a private environmental
organization.
   ``We had been nervous about this,'' she said, noting that the
oil industry has been pressing the administration and Congress to
open new areas of the Outer Continental Shelf for exploratory
drilling in light of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Industry groups greeted the action by the House panel with
disappointment.
   ``The Outer Continental Shelf contains enough oil to replace our
imports from the Persian Gulf for the next 25 years,'' said Robert
Stewart, president of the National Ocean Industries Association.
The group represents companies involved in offshore oil drilling.
   The action was seen widely as an attempt to preempt any action
by the administration to reverse itself on the decision last June
when the president announced a postponement, in some cases as long
as 10 years, of oil and gas leases off much of the West Coast,
southern Florida and New England.
   ``This extension guarantees the protection of the California
coastline to avoid any possible retreat by the president,'' said
Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif. ``It provides the protection that we
need.''
   White House officials have said Bush has no intention of backing
away from his June announcement, despite lobbying from industry to
ease some of the prohibitions.
   Some congressmen as well as environmentalists have been worried
that the administration might change its mind amid the clamor over
jumping oil prices, the threat of possible shortages and pressures
to ease America's reliance on foreign crude.
   The Appropriations Committee voted to extend the moratorium on
oil leases for one year in all the areas singled out for special
protection by Bush last June and went a step further. It extended
the ban on leases in Alaska's Bristol Bay, the eastern Gulf of
Mexico off northern Florida, and along a 50-mile buffer in the
North Atlantic from Connecticut to northern Virginia.
   The measure must still be approved by the House and the Senate,
but environmentalists called the vote a key victory for protecting
the offshore areas from oil companies. Traditionally the House
appropriations panel has taken the lead in pushing for moratoria on
offshore leasing, with the full House and Senate likely to go
along.
   The oil industry has cited the Persian Gulf crisis as clear
evidence that domestic oil production should be expanded including
more offshore drilling along the Outer Continental Shelf.
   ``Many observers in the past month have noted the irony in the
fact that the U.S. is risking the lives of American troops and
spending billions to protect Middle East oil while the domestic
supply lies dormant in our own backyard,'' said Stewart, the
drilling industry spokesman.

<HEAD>Ethics Panel to Quiz Five Senators on Aid to Keating</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Ethics Committee is summoning five
senators to explain their assistance for Charles H. Keating Jr. at
a time his Lincoln Savings and Loan was plummeting toward a massive
collapse.
   The senators will appear over the next two weeks, the committee
announced Monday, after which the panel will act on recommendations
from its special counsel.
   Congressional sources said counsel Robert S. Bennett has
recommended that the investigation go forward for Democratic Sens.
Alan Cranston of California, Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan and
Dennis DeConcini of Arizona.
   Bennett, also recommended that the investigations of Sens. John
McCain, R-Ariz., and John Glenn, D-Ohio, be dismissed, the sources
said.
   Continuation of any of the cases could mean trial-like hearings
would be scheduled, probably next year.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Bennett's
report establishes crucial links between the timing of
contributions by Keating to Cranston, Riegle and DeConcini and
actions they took on Keating's behalf.
   ``The conclusion was there was no connection between the
contributions and actions'' of Glenn and McCain, one source said.
   The links were instrumental in Bennett's recommendations, said
another source, who added Bennett's conclusions are not based on a
single factor but o a pattern and practice of behavior by each
senator.
   Glenn and McCain are scheduled to appear before the six-member
ethics panel this week, sources said. It was not known when the
other senators will testify.
   ``Under our existing practices, the committee must give each
senator under investigation the opportunity to be heard by the
committee in executive session before any decisions are made,'' a
committee statement said. ``Following these meetings with the
senators, the committee will meet to decide how it will proceed.''
   The five senators received a total of $1.3 million from Keating
and his associates for their campaigns and causes, and intervened
with U.S. banking regulators on behalf of the former head of
Lincoln Savings and Loan of Irvine, Calif.
   The federal government seized Keating's thrift in April 1989. It
could cost taxpayers more than $2 billion to cover the losses from
the collapse
   The senators have said they intervened with regulators -
especially in two key meetings in April 1987 - because Keating made
a persuasive case that his S&amp;L was being treated unfairly. All have
denied that their intervention was driven by the donations.
   Public documents and statements show some links between the
contributions and contacts with regulators by Riegle, Cranston and
DeConcini.
   However, Bennett reportedly has much more precise connections
involving the timing.
   The public record shows that:
   -Keating was the host of a fund-raiser for Riegle in Detroit on
March 23, 1987, less than two weeks before four senators met with
the nation's chief thrift regulator April 2, 1987. Riegle said he
received $78,250 from Keating and his associates at the
fund-raiser.
   Riegle didn't attend that April 2 meeting, although he suggested
it be held. He was at an April 9 meeting between all five senators
and regulators examining Lincoln.
   -Cranston solicited $850,000 from Keating for three voter
registration projects. The contributions began in June 1987, two
months after the meetings with regulators, and continued through
February 1988. Cranston also received $39,000 from Keating and his
associates for his 1986 re-election campaign.
   -DeConcini received $15,000 in campaign donations from Keating
or his associates in 1986, before the meetings with regulators, and
an additional $5,000 in October 1987.
   In addition to the April 1987 meetings, DeConcini and Cranston
continued a series of contacts with regulators right up to the time
the thrift was seized in April 1989. Both said they intervened in
an effort to get Lincoln sold, rather than seized by the
government, in order to save jobs.
   The links between those contacts and contributions could not
immediately be determined.
   At the April 2, 1987, meeting, Cranston, McCain, DeConcini and
Glenn discussed Lincoln with Edwin J. Gray, then chairman of the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   Gray told the House Banking Committee last November that Riegle
suggested the meeting with senators. Riegle acknowledged that such
a meeting was ``one of the issues'' he discussed with Gray a month
earlier, but he denied actually arranging the session.
   Gray testified that the four senators at the April 2 meeting
offered a deal on Keating's behalf: If regulators waived a rule
prohibiting risky investments for Lincoln, the thrift would finance
more home mortgages. All four senators vigorously denied that a
deal was offered.
   On April 9, 1987, all five senators, meeting with the San
Francisco-based regulators who were examining Lincoln, were told
that allegations against Keating's thrift were so serious that
criminal referrals were being made to the Justice Department.

<HEAD>Protesters Say They May Give Trustees Six Months to Quit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students barricaded inside a building at the
University of the District of Columbia say they may give some
members of the school's board of trustees until March 31 to resign.
   Leaders of the protest, which began Wednesday, had said the
students wouldn't leave the building unless the 11 mayoral
appointees to the 15-member board submitted letters of resignation
immediately. However they softened that demand on Monday.
   ``That gives everybody six months to determine whether or not
there are some members we want to reinstate or some we want to
replace,'' protest leader Mark Thompson said.
   The protesters are demanding extensive changes in the way the
12,000-student university is run and improvements in several
athletic and academic programs. They say the board has allowed the
quality of the school to decline and put the accreditation of some
of its departments in jeopardy.
   The students and the board have reached agreement on nearly all
of the students' other demands. But negotiations remain stalemated
on the issue of resignations, with most of the board refusing to
quit.
   ``It would not appear to be in the best interests of the
university for them to quit,'' UDC spokesman John Britton said.
   ``We've made progress, and honestly, the dialogue has become a
bit more candid and a bit more cordial, but we're still discussing
and neither side has really bent any,'' Thompson said.
   Thompson said about 500 students remained in the building
Monday, down from the 1,000 he said participated in the
demonstrations this weekend.
   Trustees have estimated the number of students involved from 150
to 300.
   Thompson said protesters were successful in persuading most
students to stay away from classes Monday, despite administrators
having officially opened the university for the first time since
demonstrations began.
   ``As far as we are concerned, school is still closed,'' Thompson
said.
   All buildings except an administration building occupied by the
students were reopened. But instructors were seen conducting
classes with fewer than 10 students each.
   Two trustees have agreed to resign for personal reasons, Britton
said, but the protests had not forced the actions. A third trustee
has agreed to quit because of illness, Thompson said.
   Trustee Nira Long has agreed to step down as board chairwoman
but has refused to leave the board.

<TEXT>
   Poles have poured into Berlin by the tens of
thousands, packing buses, jamming trains and sputtering along in
tiny cars. Their goal: one last, mad shopping spree to get Western
goods before German unification.
   Poles could freely come to East Germany and then pass unhindered
into the consumer nirvana of West Berlin. But at midnight today
East Germany won't exist and Poles and others will have to meet
rigorous visa requirements.
   Others seeking a quick profit in Berlin's frantic days before
unification were East European gypsies, a few Soviets, Germans and
even an enterprising Afghan.
   The Poles were especially noticeable on downtown streets Monday.
   There were Poles pulling baggage carts loaded with stereos,
video equipment, television sets and boom boxes.
   Rushing through Berlin's hectic streets, the Poles pushed their
goods and loaded them into dozens and dozens of waiting buses
parked along broad avenues.
   Berliners sat in outdoor cafes despite an uncomfortable wind and
threatening dark clouds.
   They seemed subdued compared with the euphoria of the days in
November when the Berlin Wall was opened. Millions of East Germans
then poured across the border and West Berlin's streets were a
circus of consumerism.
   But the most cosmopolitan of German cities was still enjoying
the show on Monday, throbbing with life as it prepared to become
Germany's capital, the biggest city between Paris and Moscow.
   At the Brandenburg Gate, hundreds of tourists browsed through
the bazaar that has mushroomed along the former ``death strip''
that separated East and West.
   An Afghan sold his native-country rugs, East German soldiers'
fur aps, Soviet-made watches and Islamic literature.
   The symbols of an outdated ideology and its military might were
being auctioned off at the once-forbidding Cold War barrier.
   A German was peddling East German flags, Soviet army belts and a
large blue, gold-edged banner that said, `Always Ready for Peace
and Socialism.''
   Next to him, two Soviets were offering records of Lenin's
thoughts, excerpts from speeches by their late hard-line leader
Leonid Brezhnev, and heroic martial songs performed by the Red Army
choir.
   At row after row of stands, Eastern European gypsies were doing
brisk a business in Soviet military belts, spy glasses,
night-vision infra-red binoculars, pistol holsters, East German
army helmets and Soviet and East German uniforms.
   A Soviet woman was unloading a bagfull of red Lenin banners to a
gypsy seller. Another group of Soviets was selling Lenin pins to a
group of Americans.
   Above the crowd, television technicians used cranes to hoist
floodlights in preparation for unification, which comes at the
stroke of midnight.
   Asian manufacturers of electronics will be celebrating German
unification too; their countries are receiving another boost to
their bulging trade surpluses.
   West Berlin merchants were struggling to meet the demand on
Monday as Poles scrambled to beat the imposition of visas that will
come with unification.
   To get visas, Poles will have to have 50 marks (about $30) for
every day they plan to spend in Germany and will have to show they
have medical insurance coverage for their stay.
   Across from the seedy Zoo train station, a truck was unloading
TV sets. Impatient Poles were crowding around the truck. A worker
wiped his sweaty brow and begged for space so that he could carry
the packed sets into the store.
   In front of the City Radio store, ropes were put up to form
lines. The stereos, the TV sets, the videos never got unpacked as
scores of Poles snapped them up.
   Polish cars took nearly all parking spaces around the station,
and in some of them weary shoppers took naps. Families took breaks,
sitting on boxes of newly bought stereo equipment.
   Others fanned across the city to search for their buses. Perhaps
hundreds were parked along the broad avenues leading to the
Brandenburg Gate, even blocking the view to the Bellevue Palace,
the official residence of German presidents.
   Thousands went back to Poland in train cars packed with people,
food and the latest in electronic gear.
   One man pushed a supermarket cart on top of which a huge TV set,
too big to fit into the cart, swayed precariously, tied with a
rope.
   One woman took off her shoes and lay across several boxes
containing stereos. A large grocery bag served as her pillow.

   About 90 people were taken by ambulance to
hospitals after an apparent outbreak of food poisoning at a hotel,
officials said.
   The victims were attending a hardware convention and apparently
were poisoned at a Sunday night banquet at the Hyatt Regency Hotel,
said Fire Department spokesman Tom Sheppard.
   They were taken by ambulance Monday night from three hotels
where they were staying.
   ``I'd say about 95 percent of the victims walked out on their
own power,'' Sheppard said.
   At least two dozen of the victims were reported in fair
condition.
   Iowa residents Darwin and Donna Springer complained of vomiting
and diarrhea after the dinner of chicken, bread pudding and salad.
   A person who answered the telephone at the Hyatt said the hotel
had no comment.

<HEAD>Washington Party Plans $20 Million Lawsuit Against Democrats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Harold Washington Party is filing a $20
million federal lawsuit accusing Cook County Democratic Party
leaders of conspiring to keep the predominantly black third party
off the Nov. 6 ballot.
   R. Eugene Pincham, attorney for the Washington Party, said the
Cook County Democratic Party and a number of its leaders were named
as defendants, as were five private citizens who challenged the
Washington Party's nominating petitions.
   Pincham, a former appellate judge running for the Cook County
Board on the Washington Party ticket, said the lawsuit contends the
Democratic Party concealed its involvement in challenges to the
nominating petitions.
   The lawsuit, filed Monday in U.S. District Court, also contends
that one sheet of objections to the petitions was duplicated 6,000
times and that copies were attached to each petition. Pincham said
election law requires that objections be made out for individually
for each challenged petition sheet.
   ``There never has been such a massive fraud disclosed,'' Pincham
said at a news conference.
   The lawsuit contends Democratic leaders hired influential former
U.S. District Court Judge George N. Leighton to serve as attorney
for the five citizens who objected to the legitimacy of the
Washington Party's petitions.
   Spokesmen for the Cook County Democratic Party could not be
immediately reached for comment because no one answered the party's
office telephone Monday afternoon.

   Authorities were investigating the

Republican U.S. Rep. Denny Smith's campaign office in downtown
Salem, says a campaign spokesman.
   The fire began in a storage room and burned itself out before
causing any major structural damage to the storefront office, said
Smith spokesman Tony Williams.
   A campaign worker discovered the damage early Monday when she
opened up the office, Williams said, adding that some campaign

   Williams said the Salem police and fire departments were
investigating the blaze as a possible arson-caused fire.
   Smith, running for a sixth term in Congress, is being opposed by

<HEAD>Gingrich Launches Fight Against Bush Over Deficit-Cutting
Agreement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, the second-ranking
Republican in the House, is staking out his opposition to President
Bush's effort to pass a $500 billion deficit-reduction agreement.
   ``It is my conclusion that it will kill jobs, weaken the
economy, that the tax increase will be counterproductive and it is
not a package that I can support,'' Gingrich told reporters Monday.
``We need to do better than this.''
   The Georgia Republican was one of the negotiators during the 4{
months of budget talks, but he refused to attend the announcement
ceremony.
   He didn't announce his opposition immediately, waiting instead
until Monday afternoon when it was clear there was strong
apprehension among his House constituents and the public.
   Gingrich and his allies were careful not to attack the president
directly, instead trying to pin the package - which is bound to be
politically unpopular - on the Democrats.
   ``The Democrats basically extorted the president,'' said Rep.
Duncan Hunter, R-Calif. who joined Gingrich at his press
conference.

<HEAD>Odd Aircraft Spotted in West</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several large, quiet, triangular wing-shaped
aircraft of unknown origin have been spotted in the air near Air
Force bases in California and elsewhere in the West, reports
Aviation Week and Space Technology.
   A different aircraft whose engines produce a loud roar that
resembles heavy rocket engines also has been spotted, the magazine
said.
   The Air Force declined to confirm or deny that the sightings
were of new warplanes.
   The publication, the current week's edition that became
available Monday, says the triangular aircraft are possibly
prototypes of the Air Force B-2 or Navy A-12 aircraft.
   The A-12 is a new fighter under development, which has not been
displayed. The B-2 is the ``stealth'' bomber, which has been
displayed, and its shape is well-known.
   Aviation Week published what appeared to be pictures of the A-12
without explaining whether they were actual aircraft in flight,
artists' conceptions, models or something else.
   The magazine said the triangular craft did not resemble the
production B-2 with its distinctive sawtooth wing trailing edge.
   It quoted ``well qualified observers'' as reporting that the
aircraft are ``fairly flat'' and triangular shaped with ``a rounded
nose, rounded wingtips and probably no vertical tail surfaces.''
   The observers were not otherwise identified.
   One observer in Nevada was quoted as saying the shape of the
aircraft was ``like a manta ray.''
   The magazine said there have been at least 11 sightings of the
triangular aircraft near Edwards Air Force Base in California and
one near Fresno, Calif. It said there have been other sightings of
similar aircraft in central Nevada near ranges operated by the Air
Force and the Energy Department.
   It described at least 14 sightings of the loud craft, called the
``pulser'' from the pulsating nature of the sound, varying up and
down in intensity once or twice a second, plus other reports of the
sound, often at night.
   It said that typically the pulser aircraft are seen flying a
southwest to northwest track near Edwards Air Force Base and the
China Lake Naval Weapon Center.
   ``This routing would suggest the aircraft are returning from
test ranges or `work areas' off the western U.S. coast where
airline pilots have reported seeing very high-speed vehicles at
altitudes above 50,000 feet,'' the magazine said.
   A companion article said research aircraft flying from Nevada
sites include ``both manned and unmanned hypersonic-capable
aircraft designed to perform strategic reconnaissance and other,
less conventionally defined missions.'' Some aircraft were said to
have ``exotic propulsion and aerodynamic schemes not fully
understood at this time.''
   Col. Joe Purka, an air force public affairs officer, said he
could say nothing.

<HEAD>Hitler Quote in Review Prompts Campus Commotion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HANOVER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Dartmouth Review, a politically
conservative Dartmouth College weekly that has attacked women,
blacks and homosexuals, is under fire for printing an anti-Semitic
passage from Hitler's ``Mein Kampf.''
   The student newspaper was distributed Saturday on Yom Kippur,
the Jewish Day of Atonement and Judaism's most solemn day.
   Dartmouth spokesman Alex Huppe said Monday a student petition
drive against the newspaper collected more than 1,000 signatures,
and a protest rally is planned for Thursday. The off-campus paper
is not affiliated with the college.
   The Dartmouth Student Assembly, which represents the 3,200
undergraduates, condemned The Review, and university President
James Freedman accused the paper of ``an act of moral cowardice''
and a pattern of discriminatory attacks.
   The passage from Hitler's manifesto was inserted, without
attribution, into the credo on The Review's masthead:
   ``Therefore, I believe today that I am acting in the sense of
the Almighty Creator: By warding off the Jews, I am fighting for
the Lord's work.''
   Editor in chief Kevin Pritchett said the quote was inserted
without the editors' knowledge. He said someone could have gotten
access to the paper's computers.
   ``It was an ugly, awful, anti-Semitic prank,'' he said. ``It
caused a lot of hurt feelings. We at The Review are sickened by
this.''
   The newspaper, in a statement, offered ``heartfelt apologies to
Jews at Dartmouth and to the Dartmouth community at large'' and
said it is investigating how the passage got into print.
   ``Our office is not secure,'' Pritchett said. ``It's Hanover,
New Hampshire, not New York City.''
   The paper, which has been published since 1980 with backing from
some of the nation's most prominent conservatives, has been
vilified over the years for its views on women, homosexuals and
blacks.
   Most recently, William Cole, a black music professor, resigned
in August after The Review attacked him for seven years in print,
belitting him as mediocre. Cole said his effectiveness was
compromised by the attacks.
   Cole filed a $600,000 libel suit against the paper that was
settled out of court two years later for no money.
   After Cole refused to talk about a scathing Review article in
1988, four student staff members confronted him in his classroom
after a lecture.
   The students photographed and tape-recorded the encounter,
saying Cole swore at them and broke the flash attachment off the
camera. The college suspended three of the students. A judge
ordered them reinstated.
   The petition distributed against The Review accused it a series
of actions that have ``fostered an intolerance of diversity at the
college'' and ``undermined our college's reputation and hindered
unity.''
   ``The opinions expressed by the 24 staff members of The Review
do not represent those of the Dartmouth Community,'' the petition
said.

<HEAD>U.S. Troops Use Oasis for Urban Warfare Training</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Army troops have turned an
abandoned oasis into a training ground for a kind of warfare not
usually associated with the desert - street fighting.
   It's called MOUT - for Military Operations in Urban Terrain.
   The exercise Monday shows the determination of U.S. forces to be
ready to defend Saudi towns from any Iraqi invasion or possibly to
dislodge Iraqi occupation forces from Kuwait City.
   It was an otherworldly setting to play out fearsome
possibilities. The site, which one officer described as ``right out
of a 1950s Foreign Legion movie,'' was a town that once had about
200 inhabitants.
   The town has stood vacant, silent but for the desert wind
whining through scrub pines, since the residents picked up and left
about 10 years ago for a new town that was built for them by King
Fahd.
   A wall bore evidence of incongruous foxhole humor - a sign
saying ``Master Charge and Visa accepted here.''
   But for military reasons, this cluster of stone and mud
buildings, some still bearing ornate wooden doors, was ``an ideal
setting,'' said Capt. John Madigan.
   Madigan, of Springfield, Va., a company commander in the 101st
Airborne Division, said he had trained in street fighting at a site
in California, but ``that doesn't replicate the distance or size
that you have out here in the Saudia desert.''
   In Monday's exercise, his troops advanced building by building
through the sand-swept streets, employing the tactics they would
use in actual street fighting. They simulated combat without using
live ammunition.
   Although the town is uninhabted, Madigan said his troops were
instructed to avoid further damage to crumbling walls.
   Some soldiers complained about suddenly finding their bottled
drinking water replaced by well water with an unpleasant, brackish
taste.
   Front-line units have had liberal supplies of water in plastic
bottles since the beginning of Operation Desert Shield, the U.S.
military buildup in Saudi Arabia.
   ``We've gone to an oasis well water here,'' said 1st Sgt. Joseph
Mudd, of St. Louis. ``It's the only type of water we may see in
combat.'' He said chlorine had been added to purify it.
   Maj. Dan Grigson, a division spokesman, said the bottled water
took up too much space in helicopters. The oasis water came from a
100-foot well and ``has been tested and is perfectly safe,'' he
said.
   Some troopers said the packets of flavored drink mix in the meal
rations helped to overcome what Spec. Anthony Stewart of Bessemer,
Ala., said was ``like swimming pool water.''
   Spec. Lorenza Abrams of Richmond, Calif., said, ``regular water
goes down easy. Not this one. They say to close your eyes and your

   Robert Mapplethorpe was one of the most
important photographers of the 1980s, says a museum director who
rushed to get his work on display before he died of AIDS.
   ``I felt it was my responsibility as a curator to work with him
while he was alive,'' Janet Kardon, director of New York's American
Craft Museum, testified Monday at the obscenity trial of a
colleague for showing seven of the pictures.
   ``It's the job of a contemporary curator to record history even
while it's happening,'' she said.
   More defense testimony was scheduled for today in the trial of
the Contemporary Arts Center and its director, Dennis Barrie, on
charges of obscenity and using children in nudity-related material.
   If convicted in the nation's first obscenity trial of a museum,
Barrie could receive a year in jail and a $2,000 fine. The gallery
could be fined $10,000.
   Ms. Kardon was director of the University of Pennsylvania's
Institute of Contemporary Art when the Mapplethorpe exhibit was
assembled.
   The seven photographs in question are among 175 pictures in the
exhibit, which was on display in Cincinnati for seven weeks ending
May 26. The work is now in Boston. Mapplethorpe died of AIDS in
March 1989.
   Jurors on Monday got their first look at the seven photos,
glancing at them with no visible reaction as they were passed
around. Five of the photographs show sexually graphic acts
involving men, and two show naked children.
   Ms. Kardon, asked by a prosecutor to describe the artistic merit
of four of the sexually explicit photos, said they were
artistically lighted and framed and showed symmetry and use of
horizontal and vertical lines.
   ``He was one of the most important photographers working in the
'80s,'' Ms. Kardon said.

<HEAD>UCLA Math Program Cited For Asian Discrimination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Education Department says an investigation
has determined that a graduate mathematics program at the
University of California at Los Angeles discriminated against Asian
Americans.
   Michael Williams, assistant secretary for civil rights, said
Monday that the 30-month inquiry found ``a statistical disparity in
the rates of admission to the mathematics department on the basis
of race'' and ``an inconsistency in how Asian and white applicants
who received the same evaluation ratings were treated.''
   Seventy-five other departments were cleared of discrimination
allegations, while eight departments were found to have
inconclusive records, Williams said.
   The Office of Civil Rights also is investigating undergraduate
admission practices at UCLA and at Harvard.
   As a result of the findings, Williams said UCLA must offer
admission to five Asian-American students who had been
``discriminatorily denied admission.'' The university also must
establish a uniform system of admission and improve recordkeeping
``to allow us to determine whether or not it is observing the civil
rights laws.''
   UCLA Chancellor Charles Young said the university will appeal
the violation finding because ``we firmly believe that racially
neutral criteria were used to make these decisions and that the OCR
has no basis to conclude that discrimination exists at UCLA.''

<HEAD>House Sends Decoder Provision to President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New television sets with 13-inch screens or
larger would have to include built-in decoders for displaying
closed captions for the deaf under legislation awaiting President
Bush's signature.
   The House gave final approval to the bill Monday by voice vote.
The Senate passed it in July.
   The measure requires TV sets sold after July 1993 to be equipped
with circuitry for converting audio portions of a TV program into
subtitles on the screen. Decoders are available now but they sell
for $160 to $200 separately.
   The House Energy and Commerce Committee estimated that including
the chips at manufacture would add no more than $15 to the retail
price.
   In addition to the estimated 20 million to 24 million Americans
who are deaf or hearing impaired, backers said the decoders also
would benefit millions of children and functionally illiterate
adults in learning to read as wells as immigrants trying to learn
English.
   All prime-time television shows broadcast by the three major
networks now carry closed captions, as do most national news shows
and sports events.

   The National Arboretum has unveiled the
official North American Bonsai Museum and paid tribute to the man
called the father of that horticultural art in America.
   John Naka, after whom the pavilion was named, called the honor
the most significant of his career.
   ``This is an honor that I never dreamed would come to me,'' he
said Monday at dedication of the museum. ``People all over the
world have embraced the art of the bonsai, and by doing that have
embraced one another to their customs.''
   Bonsai is the art of shaping trees and shrubs in shallow pots
through pruning and controlled fertilization. The technique
originated in Japan centuries ago.

<HEAD>House Approves Limiting TV Commercials On Kids' Shows</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House has sent legislation to President
Bush that would reinstate limits on commercial advertising on
children's television shows.
   The bill was approved on voice vote without dissent despite
oposition from the Bush administration, which says the
restrictions would ``create new and extremely serious First
Amendment problems'' involving free speech.
   Also approved without opposition by the Senate, the legislation
would effectively reverse the Reagan administration's deregulation
of the commercial content of children's TV programming in 1984.
   Similar legislation was passed by both the House and Senate two
years ago, but it was vetoed by President Reagan after Congress had
adjourned.
   But with opposition from the television networks and the
National Association of Broadcasters defused, sponsors of the bill
said they hope the overwhelming congressional support it enjoys
will persuade Bush not to veto it.
   ``The limits which we propose are reasonable,'' said Rep. John
Bryant, D-Texas. ``I trust the support of various groups will
persuade our president that this bill fits into his program as a
kinder and gentler president who responds to family concerns.''
   The legislation would limit commercial advertising during
children's programming to 10{ minutes an hour on weekends an 12
minutes an hour on weekdays.
   It also would require the Federal Communications Commission - in
renewing the licenses of television stations - to weigh how well
broadcasters are serving the educational and informational needs of
children.
   The House Energy and Commerce Committee estimates that the
average child spends 10,000 to 15,000 hours in front of a
television - more time than in school - and is exposed to more than
200,000 TV commercials by the time he or she reaches age 18.

<HEAD>Gen. Curtis LeMay, Architect of Strategic Air Command, Dies</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NY6</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARCH AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retired Gen. Curtis E.
LeMay, the gruff, cigar-chomping ``Iron Eagle'' who built the
nation's global nuclear strike force and suggested the United
States threaten to bomb North Vietnam ``back into the Stone Age,''
is dead at 83.
   The four-star Air Force general died of a heart attack Monday at
the base hospital.
   In addition to transforming the war-weary Strategic Air Command
into a force that could deliver nuclear weapons anywhere in the
world, LeMay relayed the order to drop the A-bomb on Japan and
directed the Berlin Airlift in 1948.
   In 1968 he ran for vice president as George Wallace's running
mate.
   During World War II, LeMay was instrumental in pressing the
daylight bombing offensive against the Nazis. He led missions
personally, demanding bombers not use evasive maneuvers over target
areas thick with anti-aircraft fire.
   Transferred to the Pacific, he organized the B-29 bombing
campaign against Japan. His planes dropped the atomic bombs on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But he said later that Japan had already
been beaten by incendiary bombing.
   ``We went ahead and droppped the bombs because President Truman
told me to do it,'' he said in a 1985 interview.
   LeMay was in charge of the Air Force in Europe in 1948 when the
Soviet Union cut off access to West Berlin. His management of the
Berlin Airlift kept West Berlin supplied and dismayed Stalin.
   He became Air Force vice chief of staff in 1957 and chief of
staff in 1961.
   Contending strategic air power held the key to U.S. security,
LeMay pushed for a modern bomber force. He ushered in the B-52,
still part of the nation's nuclear deterrent.
   LeMay retired as chief of staff in 1965, frustrated by Robert S.
McNamara, defense secretary under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson.
   McNamara had subordinated LeMay's coveted bombers to the new
ballistic missiles and put restraints on U.S. air power in Vietnam,
a sore point for LeMay, who believed in all-out war.
   In his 1965 autobiography, ``Mission with LeMay,'' he wrote that
a solution to the Vietnam War might be to warn the North Vietnamese
that they must ``draw in their horns and stop their aggression, or
we are going to bomb them back into the Stone Age.''
   Born in Columbus, Ohio, LeMay graduated from Ohio State
University. Charles Lindbergh's flight to Paris led him to enlist
as a cadet in the Army Air Corps in 1928.
   Tough on himself and subordinates, he was unable to distinguish
between the unfortunate and the incompetent. But he would do any
job he demanded of his followers. He was as comfortable in a
machine gun turret as he was in the cockpit.
   The 1955 Jimmy Stewart movie ``Strategic Air Command'' provided
a glimpse of the strike force LeMay built. A cigar-chomping Frank
Lovejoy played a character with LeMay's tough, demanding persona.
   One story about LeMay was that he once found a SAC sentry who
had put down his weapon to eat a sandwich. ``This afternoon I found
a man guarding a hangar with a ham sandwich. There will be no more
of that,'' LeMay said in a memo.
   LeMay was a gun collector, big-game hunter and ham radio
operator. His nicknames included ``Iron Eagle'' and ``Iron Pants.''
   In his autobiography, he said he had ``blood on my hands ... not
because I preferred to bathe in blood. It was because I was part of
a primitive world where men still had to kill in order to avoid
being killed, or in order to avoid having their loved nation
stricken and emasculated.''
   A memorial service is scheduled for Wednesday at the air base
chapel. Burial will be at the U.S. Air Force Academy on Thursday.
   Survivors include his wife, Helen, and a daughter.

   A detective got a search warrant and seized a
reporter's notebook from her desk for an investigation of a
slaying, shocking First Amendment experts. Police later backed down
and returned the notes.
   ``It was a case of an aggressive, young, sometimes overzealous
detective who felt the notes would help the case. We hope to put it
to rest,'' said Paul Pash, police commissioner in suburban Warren.
   Detective Richard Van Hulle seized the notebook Saturday from
Macomb Daily reporter Cindy Mooty, 27, while she was alone in the
newsroom of the 55,000-circulation newspaper in Macomb County. He
returned it on Monday.
   Herschel Fink, chairman of the State Bar of Michigan Law and
Media Committee, called the seizure a violation of the First
Amendment.
   ``It's so frankly abhorrent to freedom of speech maybe we all
felt comfortable it couldn't happen,'' he said. ``I don't think
it's a matter that we can allow to pass.''
   Fink said his committee will discuss recommendations to the
Michigan Supreme Court for a rule to prevent a similar incident.
   Mooty said the notes were of interviews with Elizabeth Schultz
on the Sept. 21 slaying of Roy Smith III. Smith, 17, was shot from
a passing car as he stood on Schultz's porch.
   Deputy Chief Carl Muschong said the notebook was held in an
evidence locker until it was returned. He said police did not make
copies.
   Ben Burns, editor and publisher of the Macomb Daily, said the
newspaper may sue for damages. But he added, ``I'm not interested
in pounding on some officer's head who was trying to do what he
thought was a thorough investigation.
   ``We've had a very good relationship with the Warren police and
we'd like to maintain that,'' he said.
   The search warrant was issued Friday by District Judge Dawnn
Gruenberg, who said police told her Mooty had agreed to turn over
the notes.
   ``Under the particular facts I had, I do not believe this was in
any way connected to the First Amendment or a free press,'' the
judge said.
   The police commissioner and deputy chief said they were not
aware a judge had issued a search warrant until it was executed.
   Mooty said she told police last week that if they wanted her
notes, they would have to subpoena them and that the newspaper
would probably fight it. She said she never expected a search
warrant.
   Dawn Phillips, general counsel for the Michigan Press
Association, said Michigan law does not protect a reporter's notes.
   At least 26 states have some form of shield law that protects
published or unpublished information and sources or bars a contempt
ruling for refusing to submit material, she said.
   ``Reporters shouldn't be afraid on a Saturday morning when they
go in to do a story that the police are going to show up,''
Phillips said.

   A Chinese passenger jet that was hijacked on a
domestic flight slammed into two other planes at Canton's
international airport on Tuesday, and hospital officials said
dozens of people were killed.
   The Boeing 737 was carrying about 90 passengers and all three
planes exploded after the collision on the airport tarmac,
according to Western diplomats a reporter at the Canton People's
Broadcasting Station.
   About seven hours after the crash, China's official Xinhua News
Agency reported only that a ``passenger plane of the Xiamen Airline
company was hijacked'' and ``landed in accident at the Canton
airport.''
   Xiamen is a subsidiary of China's national carrier, CAAC.
   The news agency did not say who hijacked the plane or why.
   The reporter said all three planes belonged to CAAC. One, a
Boeing 757, was believed to be Flight 3523, which had already begun
boarding passengers for Shanghai.
   Casualties were rushed to at least five area hospitals.
   Officials said they closed the airport soon after the 8 a.m.
accident in the southern city, capital of Guangdong province.
   ``Altogether several tens were killed,'' said an official at the
Chinese Traditional Medicine Univesity in Canton. Like other
officials, he spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A Taiwanese man was pronounced dead at his hospital, one of many
in the provincial capital to receive casualties.
   An official at the No. 1 People's Hospital said it had received
five victims and that one, a Chinese man, had died.
   ``We're right in the middle of emergency rescue procedures,''
the official said, declining to give her name.
   At the Red Cross Hospital, a nurse who only identified herself
as Huang, said a 43-year-old Chinese man was being treated.
   The city health department refused to comment on the death toll.
   At least five flights between Canton and the nearby British
colony, Hong Kong, were postponed. Six hours later, the airport
reopened for international flights but no domestic flights were
taking off.
   The hijacked flight originated in the Fujian city of Xiamen,
north of Guangdong province, and was heading toward Canton when
someone on board attempted to hijack it, a Western diplomat said,
speaking on condition of anonymity from Canton.
   In Hong Kong, government-owned radio quoted Hong Kong air
traffic controllers as saying they had been informed of a hijacking
early Tuesday.
   Richard Stites, a spokesman at the U.S. Consulate in Canton,
said the consulate had not been notified about any Americans on
board.
   In Taipei, Taiwan, state-run television reported that at least
two Taiwanese citizens had been on board the plane. Many Taiwanese
originally come from Fujian province and Taiwanese businesses have
invested millions of dollars there over the past few years.

<HEAD>Tobacco Subsidiary Joins Doctors' Groups to Promote Health</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two leading doctors' organizations are under
fire from members for joining with a subsidiary of a tobacco
conglomerate on a campaign to lower Americans' cholesterol and
reduce their risk of heart attack.
   ``It's a pathetic use of a medical organization for the
commercial ends of a tobacco and food conglomerate,'' said Dr. Alan
Blum, a family physician and chairman and founder of the
anti-smoking group DOC, or Doctors Ought to Care.
   Blum is a member of the two doctors' organizations, the American
Medical Association and the American Academy of Family Physicians.
   ``Basically the American Medical Association and the American
Academy of Family Physicians are associating with people who murder
400,000 Americans a year, in order to save a possible 35,000 or
40,000 because of lowering cholesterol,'' said Dr. Brent Blue of
Jackson, Wyo., a member of the family physicians' academy.
   Smoking is a leading cause of heart disease. Cigarettes kill an
estimated 390,000 Americans each year, according to the U.S. Office
on Smoking and Health.
   The doctors' organizations have allowed their names and symbols
to appear in newspaper and magazine supplements supported by
Fleischmann's, a maker of margarine and a cholesterol-free egg
substitute.
   Fleischmann's products are made by the Nabisco Foods Co., part
of the RJR Nabisco tobacco conglomerate. Fifty-five percent of the
conglomerate's net sales in 1989 came from tobacco products,
according to RJR.
   In a separate campaign, Fleischmann's paid the AMA $250,000 to
become a sponsor of its Campaign Against Cholesterol.
   Three years ago, Doctors Ought to Care successfully fought to
prevent the American Academy of Family Physicians from joining
Fleischmann's in a cholesterol screening program.
   At that time, the academy decided it ``would not deal directly
with tobacco companies, but that this proscription did not extend
to subsidiaries with no involvement with tobacco products,'' the
academy said in a statement Monday.
   Asked about the tobacco company link, Larry Joyce, an AMA
spokesman, said, ``The only concern we would have is if any company
tried to influence the public health messages that are part of the
program.'' He said the campaign includes anti-smoking messages.
   Academy members opposed to the earlier Fleischmann's proposal
said they were distressed at the new alliance.
   ``This is what we worked on, and this is what they said they
weren't going to do,'' said Blum. ``We're shocked and disappointed.
We're in disbelief.''
   Fleischmann's is an advertiser in the academy's supplement in
the current issue of Reader's Digest. Fleischmann's ads appear on
the same double, fold-out page with the academy's low-cholesterol
message. Supplements advertising Fleischmann's and featuring the
AMA name and symbol appeared in Sunday's newspapers.
   The academy has several links with Fleischmann's in addition to
the public health campaign, and its medical journal, the American
Family Physician, accepts Fleischmann's advertising, said academy
spokesman William DeLay.
   Discussion of the RJR Nabisco link is likely to come up at the
academy's meeting, said Blue.
   The Maine chapter has proposed that the academy stop
interweaving its public health messages with commercial
advertising, for fear that will damage the reputation of family
physicians.

<TEXT>
   The comic Woody Allen once wrote, ``In
perpetrating a revolution, there are two requirements: someone or
something to revolt against and someone to actually show up and do
the revolting.''
   On Monday, in what the leftist Sandinista Front had predicted
would be the most violent anti-government action yet, the second
factor - someone to show up - was largely missing.
   The result was nothing to laugh about for the Sandinistas. It
was a stark public display of the dwinding popularity of the party
of revolution that had ruled Nicaragua for a decade.
   A handful of burning tires scattered around some street
intersections and a demonstration by about 500 Sandinista
supporters at the government complex were the only signs in Managua
that it wasn't a Monday morning like any other.
   The demonstration was supposed to kick off a round of mass civil
disobedience over the government's economic policies.
   Nicaraguans interviewed expressed weariness with the
Sandinistas' violent tactics and a desire to give Violeta
Chamorro's U.S.-backed government a chance to work.
   Just a few months ago, the Sandinistas could whip up impressive
throngs for anti-government marches and party celebrations.
   But on Monday, people went to work and children to their
schools, while traffic and pedestrians skirted the piles of burning
rubber.
   Sandinista party and labor leaders had been announcing the
protest for weeks.
   Former President Daniel Ortega, who lost Feb. 25 elections to
Mrs. Chamorro, had issued dire warnings that ``this situation is
practically reaching the point of no return.''
   Lucio Jiminez, secretary-general of the National Workers Front,
the umbrella group for Sandinista labor unions, had said Monday's
protests would mobilize large numbers of supporters.
   Jiminez' organization alone claims to represent 200,000 people.
   After a government-Sandinista meeting last week, the government
announced a set of measures to alleviate hunger and misery. The
program addressed Sandinista demands that the government cushion
the poorest sectors against a drastic economic recovery program.
   But the Sandinistas, apparently sure of their popular appeal,
persisted in their plans for what Ortega called a ``social
explosion.''
   According to Ortega, it would be much bigger than two
Sandinista-led strikes in May and July that paralyzed the country.
The last one, in which six people were killed and hundreds left
injured, nearly deteriorated into civil war.
   Political observers have noted that the Sandinistas seemed to
start losing support in the first strike, which occurred barely two
weeks after Mrs. Chamorro's inauguration.
   Government supporters chided the Sandinistas for not living up
to their promise to be a loyal opposition.
   Aftr the second strike, people interviewed in the streets
expressed anger at the government's apparent inability to put down
the demonstrations, which caused millions of dollars in damage and
lost production and left Managua's streets nearly impassable for
days.
   For Monday's action, however, Mrs. Chamorro's young government
has shown it is learning how to take control.
   After announcing the cushioning measures Friday, state-run
television repeatedly ran clips from street interviews showing
people who agreed with the steps.
   Many Nicaraguans who watched a live television interview with
Ortega on Friday night saw the former president as unreasonable.
The interview was conducted by the deputy minister of the
presidency, Antonio Ibarra.
   While Ibarra tried to have Ortega admit the need for
government-Sandinista talks to work out a consensus on social and
economic reform, Ortega fell back on time-worn Sandinista
accusations and slogans.
   Despite this, Ortega has in the last few days begun to sound
somewhat conciliatory. And even Jimenez seems to be softening his
stance, agreeing to hold talks with government officials today.

<HEAD>Walesa Launches Presidential Campaign in Poland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORUN, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Presidential candidate Lech Walesa has told
his first campaign rally that he opposes abortion, and attacked the
anti-Semitism that has tainted politics in his overwhelmingly Roman
Catholic nation.
   At the rally Monday, the Solidarity chairman also stressed that
no alternative exists to the painful ``shock'' economic reforms now
pinching the Polish people.
   Walesa, 47, said it was too early to present his program but he
took questions for 45 minutes from the crowd of 5,000 assembled in
a cold, windswept market square of the northern-central city of
Torun.
   One Pole drew scattered murmurs of support from some in the
crowd when he asked Walesa to remove all the ``Communists and
Jews'' from the government.
   The union leader replied, ``Look at America and other countries
- many ethnic groups are existing there in a pluralistic way and
they are doing well. ... I am not a Jew, but I am not anti-Semitic,
and I will always be against such slogans.''
   He was applauded, and said to the questioner, ``I won.''
   Walesa also said he supported a controversial ban on abortion
approved by one house of Parliament on Saturday. ``You know that I
am a practicing Catholic, and my opinion here cannot be different
from that of the church,'' he said.
   It was Walesa's first rally since declaring his candidacy Sept.
16, and he struck a populist note, declaring, ``I am one of you and
want to remain one of you.''
   Walesa's likely chief rival, one-time ally Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, has not yet formally declared.
   Poland's first popular presidential vote in more than 50 years
could take place as early as Nov. 25 under a newly passed election
law signed Monday by President Wojciech Jaruzelski. The exact date
is to be announced shortly.
   Jaruzelski, the former Communist Party leader, asked Parliament
on Sept. 19 to shorten his term because of increasing demands for
him to step down as an unwanted symbol of Poland's old order.
   Parliament elected him to a six-year term in July 1989.
   When Walesa appeared on the red-brick balcony of the medieval
town hall in Torun, he flashed V-for-victory signs. The brass band
struck up a tune instantly recognizable to Poles as the anthem of
prewar strongman Marshal Jozef Pilsudski.
   A banner read ``Torun welcomes Lech'' and two posters said, ``We
will elect Lech Walesa president.''
   Walesa received a warm, but not thunderous welcome.
   Evoking the spirit that made Solidarity endure after it was
created as the East bloc's first independent trade union in 1980,
Walesa said: ``We succeeded 10 years ago. Ten million people joined
us in the search for new chances for Poland. Today I have a similar
job.''
   Walesa said, ``Poland is really free but ... we need new minds''
in government.
   He said repeatedly that the economic reforms were crucial, but
he did not appear to win over the audience.
   The labor leader has accused the Mazowiecki government of being
too slow to privatize the state-dominated economy and to dismiss
former Communists from positions of authority in government and
industry.
   Mazowiecki supporters accuse Walesa of personal ambition and
demagoguery.

<HEAD>Impeached Judge Attempts Political Comeback in Florida</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Impeached federal Judge Alcee Hastings
attempted to turn his ouster to his political advantage today in a
runoff for the Democratic nomination for Florida secretary of
state.
   Turnout was expected to be a low 20 percent. The runoff between
Hastings and ex-newspaperman Jim Minter was the only statewide race
on the ballot.
   Hastings, who was Florida's first black federal judge when
appointed in 1979, was removed by Congress last year over bribery
allegations on which he was acquitted in court. He claims to be a
victim of political persecution.
   ``A lot of people really do know that I took a political hatchet
in the face,'' he said. ``I will not be made into a clown.''
   The 53-year-old former judge finished second to Minter in a
three-way primary in which a former Ku Klux Klan grand dragon got
more than a quarter-million votes.
   Minter, a 52-year-old former speechwriter for former Gov. Reubin
Askew, covered the Capitol for years as a newsman. He resigned as
an editorial writer for the Tallahassee Democrat to enter politics.
   The winner faces Republican incumbent Jim Smith in the Nov. 6
election.
   Independent polls recently gave Minter a lead of about 11
points, but more than a third of the voters surveyed said they
hadn't yet made up their minds.
   Minter pinned his hopes on good government types such as
environentalists and political activists. Hastings was said to be
strong among unions and minorities.
   ``I will get 90 percent of the black vote, but I can't win with
just the black vote,'' he said. ``I have to get broad-based
support, and I have it.''
   In other runoffs today, former state Sen. John Vogt and
ex-defense industry lobbyist Bill Tolley vied for the GOP
nomination for the congressional seat now held by Bill Nelson.
Nelson, a Democrat, decided not to seek re-election and made an
unsuccessful run for governor. Democrat Jim Bacchus, a lawyer,
awaits the winner.
   Hastings has proposed abolishing the independently elected state
Cabinet as too cumbersome, even though he seeks a seat on it. And
he has suggested that casino gambling might help solve the state's
budget problems.
   The secretary of state is Florida's top elections official and
oversees corporate charters and state records.
   Minter and Hastings have called for campaign finance reform and
both have outlined positions on the environment, education and
other issues.

   Should Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
choose to grab it, there now is a lifeline in the turbulent Persian
Gulf waters to pull him free from an ultimate military showdown
with the United States.
   It was cast out Monday by President Bush in a United Nations
speech that blended condemnation of the Iraqi leader as a plunderer
of Kuwait with the option of a diplomatic solution.
   If Saddam wants to save face, if he takes seriously the recent
war-talk of senior administration officials, the Iraqi can
rationalize a withdrawal from the small oil-rich emirate as a means
to Arab ends.
   After all, Bush said Iraq's unconditional departure from Kuwait
could create new opportunities: a permanent settlement between Iraq
and Kuwait, new but undefined arrangements for stability in the
Persian Gulf and a settlement between the Arabs and Israel.
   Later, Bush told reporters ``there is no flexibility here.''
   He said his policy had not changed and they should not look for
nuances - hidden meanings - in his speech.
   And yet, mixed in with the denunciation of Saddam Hussein and
even the threat of a war crimes trial, the president offered more
in the way of a diplomatic alternative than at any point in the
two-month crisis.
   In effect, Bush said withdraw, then negotiate. Implicit is an
opportunity for Saddam to take up his territorial demands with the
ousted rulers of Kuwait, provided they are restored to power.
   The Iraqi leader, feeling the pressure of an international trade
cutoff, has complained that Iraq is being singled out while other
countries' actions are not checked by the United Nations.
   Saddam has pointed an accusing finger at Israel, seeking to
swing other Arabs to his side by projecting Iraq as the bearer of
the banner for an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza,
which Jordan and Syria lost in the 1967 Mideast war.
   But at least one major Arab nation, Egypt, reportedly took
exception to any gesture to the Iraqi leader.
   Butros Ghali, the Egyptian minister of state for foreign
affairs, discussed Bush's speech with David Levy, the Israeli
foreign minister. Afterward, diplomatic sources reported that Ghali
said Saddam should not be given any chance ``to claim a bonus'' for
his takeover of Kuwait and that the Arab-Israeli dispute should not
be linked to it.
   Just as Bush took a cue from Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze in raising the spectre of a war crimes trial for
Saddam, the president followed the lead of French President
Francois Mitterrand in offering Saddam a way to avert
confrontation.
   Mitterrand's four-step proposal before the U.N. General Assembly
last week also held out to Saddam the potential of an Arab-Israeli
settlement if Iraq gives up Kuwait.
   Senior U.S. officials, who had dismissed any linking of the two
disputes, showed little interest in the French proposal at the
time.
   But on Sunday, the birthday of the Muslim prophet Mohammed,
Saddam said Iraq was prepared for a dialogue with France ``so that
everything is based on clear ideas and actions.''
   Mitterrand said one of his objectives was to ensure Israel's
security. Bush, of course, would do nothing less for America's best
friend in the Middle East.
   And yet, Saddam and other Arab leaders also are aware that U.S.
policy seeks Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and the Golan
Heights.
   Bush's script for the area in the event of an Iraqi withdrawal
holds promise of realizing that goal.
   Whether it entices Saddam to execute a complete turnabout, only
the Iraqi leader can say.
   The president is providing a way out short of war for Saddam.
And yet he also is prepared to take the ultimate military step if
scorned.
   There are 165,000 U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf region and
more arriving daily.
   Brent Scowcroft, the president's assistant for national security
affairs, and other senior officials have been warning that U.S.
patience is running out.
   ``We're still giving sanctions the time to work, the time to be
effective,'' Bush told reporters Monday. ``And I'm a little
encouraged that perhaps they are having a strong effect.''
   The choice, evidently, is Saddam Hussein's.

   ``America Tonight,'' CBS' answer to
``Nightline,'' has a way to go before it's more than an insomniac's
edition of morning talk.
   Monday night's premiere proved a once-over-lightly exercise,
with too much crammed into too little time.
   The 30-minute premiere included a 40th anniversary story on
``Peanuts'' cartoonist Charles Schulz and a promising segment
called ``The Endgame.'' The creators will mercifully shun
interviews with actors hawking movies.
   ``We hope to have some insights, to have some arguments and have
some fun,'' said folksy Charles Kuralt, the show's anchorman in New
York. Crisp, efficient Lesley Stahl is the program's anchor in
Washington.
   The show, which began at 11:35 p.m. EDT, could have dispensed
with analyses that added little to the world's knowledge, one on
prospects for war in the Persian Gulf, the other economic reporter
Robert Krulwich's light-hearted, although knowledgeable, look at
the federal budget compromise.
   ``The Endgame'' is an occasional segment in which visiting
experts and analysts discuss the day's hot topics. That can be
dreary, but the first matchup of two former Reagan administration
officials discussing the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 proved
an inspired, different sort of Washington forum.
   Former Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle and former
Navy Secretary James Webb made war, or the prospect of one, more
than just a TV abstraction.

<TEXT>
   Gold fell more than $6 an ounce in Europe today,
but it traded higher than the New York low. The dollar strengthened
in early trading.
   The drop in the gold price followed a $16 tumble in New York on
Monday to $386.60. The fall in bullion was prompted by a lowering
of oil prices on a belief there is a better chance of a negotiated
settlement in the Persian Gulf.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$389.25 an ounce at midmorning, compared with $395.25 bid per ounce
late Monday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $388.80 at midday, down from
$396.60 late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $10.82 to close at a bid
$387.25.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.42 yen to a closing 136.73 yen.
Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 136.85 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   -1.5578 German marks, up from 1.5520
   -1.2973 Swiss francs, up from 1.2885
   -5.2205 French francs, up from 5.1985

   -1,1665.50 Itaiian lire, up from 1,163.50
   -1.1540 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1526.
   In London, the dollar also rose against the pound, which was
quoted at $1.8832, cheaper than $1.8890 late Monday.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $4.67 a troy ounce,
down from Monday's $4.72 dollars.

<TEXT>
   Gunmen raked supporters of rebel
Christian Gen. Michel Aoun with automatic weapons fire as they
rallied at a candlelight vigil and police said today that 30 people
were killed and 100 wounded.
   Aoun blamed the Lebanese Forces militia of rival Christian
warlord Samir Geagea, calling Monday's killings a ``horrific
massacre.'' He said President Elias Hrawi's Syrian-backed
government was ``equally responsible.''
   For his part, Geagea accused Aoun of engineering the bloodbath
to win international sympathy as government troops tighten a siege
around the general's enclave.
   The rival forces of Aoun and Geagea battled for control of
Lebanan's Christian communities earlier this year. Hrawi is
besieging Aoun's strongholds in an effort to make him yield to
government authority.
   In a new attack today, snipers fired at pedestrians in the same
spot as Monday's shooting, killing a civilian and wounding four,
police said.
   The earlier carnage occurred shortly before midnight at the
coastal highway bridge spanning Nahr el-Maut, or Death River, five
miles north of Beirut, police said.
   They said about 5,000 Aoun supporters carrying candles
demonstrated at the crossing to protest the weeklong siege of
Aoun's enclave, where his 15,000 soldiers are headquartered.
   ``As they shouted slogans condemning the president and Mr.
Geagea for the starvation blockade, gunfire suddenly erupted and
the crowd panicked in a stampede,'' said a police spokesman.
   ``Some of the victims were trampled to death, but at least 22
died of gunshot wounds,'' said the spokesman, who cannot be
identified in line with standing rules.
   In his statement, Aoun said Hrawi, Geagea, Prime Minister Salim
Hoss, Defense Minister Albert Mansour and Hrawi's army commander
Gen. Emile Lahoud are ``equally responsible for carrying out the
massacre.''
   He called on the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and
France to withdraw their recognition of Hrawi's government.
   He said forces of Geagea and Lahoud had fired at his supporters
from the north side of the crossing.
   Aoun said Geagea's militiamen and units of Lahoud's army fired
on the demonstrators from the northern tip of the river crossing.
   However, a statement from Geagea's command in the Christian port
of Jounieh, 12 miles north of Beirut, said Aoun's ``planted
intelligence agents fired at the demonstrators from behind.''
   It said the incident was designed ``to try to win some
international sympathy and acclaim and to prolong his stay in the
presidential palace a few more days.''
   Aoun is headquartered at the presidential palace in suburban
Baabda, the traditional seat of heads of state.
   He and Geagea fought a four-month war this year for control of
the Christian enclave that covers 310 square miles of coastal and
mountainous territory north of Beirut.
   By police count, 1,046 people have been killed and 2,799 wounded
in that confrontation. Aoun's forces were left trapped in parts of
east Beirut and neighboring mountains with no air or sea outlets.
   Geagea's 6,000-member militia, which ended the fighting in
control of more than 80 percent of the Christian enclave, has
pledged allegiance to Hrawi.
   He was elected president by Parliament on Nov. 24 under an Arab
League peace plan designed to give equal power to the Moslems in
the government, which was long dominated by Christians.
   But Aoun, who had been appointed a caretaker leader before the
peace plan, has rejected Hrawi's presidency. He has tried to oust
the estimated 40,000 Syrian troops from Lebanon.
   The president, in turn, has threatened to attack to dislodge
Aoun if the blockade fails.

   With the flick of a pen, thefour victorious
powers of World War II have signed away the rights they won over
Germany by pounding Hitler's army into submission 45 years ago.
   Ministers from the two Germanys joined in signing Monday's
declaration and toasting it with champagne. They pledged that the
reunited Germany being created this week will be dedicated to peace
and good neighborliness.
   The two German officials spoke at a 35-nation ministerial
conference on European security and cooperation, the first such
official meeting in North America. President Bush and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze congratulated the German
people during the session.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany and East
German Science-Education Minister Hans-Joachim Meyer addressed the
conference minutes after the four World War II Allies signed away
the special rights they have exercised in the Germanys and Berlin
since the end of the war in 1945.
   The declaration suspends allied rights from the moment the two
countries formally merge at midnight Tuesday.
   The suspension is a stopgap measure to allow the united Germany
to be a fully sovereign country. A Sept. 12 treaty must be ratified
by the U.S. Senate and legislative bodies of the Soviet Union,
Britain and France.
   Meyer's participation marked one of the final appearances on the
international stage for East Germany.
   ``United Germany wants to set a good example. The Germans commit
themselves to their duty to keep the peace, and they bindingly
declare that never again will Germany raise territorial claims and
that it recognizes existing borders as final,'' Meyer said.
   As a member of the NATO alliance and the Western European
community, united Germany ``is in a good position to substantially
promote the process of Europe's growing together,'' Meyer said.
   In an emotional speech, Genscher said unification day ``marks
the fulfillment of a desire cherished by the German people for 45
years: to unite in peace and freedom.''
   Genscher, who was raised in what became East Germany, also vowed
that a united Germany will dedicate itself to peace.
   ``We are uniting in happiness and gratitude, not in
nationalistic euphoria,'' he said. ``The dark chapters of our
history are a cause for reflection ... on what was done in
Germany's name. That will not be repeated.''
   In his remarks, Bush said he had watched on television on Sept.
12 as U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Shevardnadze,
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, French Foreign Minister
Roland Dumas and the two Germans signed the document suspending
postwar allied rights.
   ``Those strokes of a pen bring to an end an era of discord and
division,'' he said a few minutes later as he opened the two-day
meeting of 33 European countries, the United States and Canada.
   ``We rejoice with the German people that their nation is united
once more, and we will soon welcome a united Germany into the
community of states,'' Bush said.
   The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, known as
CSCE, began with the 1975 Helsinki East-West conference. With the
crumbling of the Soviet bloc's Warsaw Pact, many countries count on
using the CSCE framework for a new all-European security system,
   Provided negotiators at Vienna agree in time on a treaty
reducing European conventional forces, Baker said the United States
would agree to a CSCE summit in Paris in November.

   The inquiry into the bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103 was adjourned today after a Scottish lawyer representing
the families of 90 American victims was killed in a car crash.
   ``It's like a curse that keeps following this thing,'' said
George Williams, whose 24-year-old son, Geordie, was one of the 270
victims of the plane crash over the nearby town of Lockerbie.
``What a terrible, terrible tragedy.''
   Lawyer Michael Hughes, 37, was working with U.S. attorney Lee S.
Kreindler representing the American families.
   The judge, Sheriff Principal John S. Mowat, postponed until
Thursday the inquiry into the Dec. 21, 1988 disaster.
   Hughes, who left a widow and five young children, was killed
Monday evening on the M74 highway as the drove home to Glasgow, 70
miles north of Dumfries.
   Police said an oncoming truck spun out of control, hit a van and
plunged through the motorway's central divider into Hughes' car. No
one else was injured.
   Kreindler arrived in Glasgow on Monday night and was due in
Dumfries today.
   American attorney Frank Granito Jr., who represents the families
of 60 British and American victims, said Hughes' death ``will pose
a great hardship'' since he was the key Scottish member of
Kreindler's team.
   ``Oh God, we are in shock,'' said Granito. ``We relied very much
on Michael. He extended to us the utmost courtesy and was of
invaluable help to our firm ... it will be very difficult for us to
continue.''
   But Granito said the American attorneys representing the
victims' families had been granted the right to question witnesses
and will go ahead.
   Frank Rosenkrantz, a German whose Spanish wife, Maria Nieves
Larracoechea, was a stewardess on the plane, said: ``It's just a
nightmare. Everything that can happen in human terms has
happened.''
   Hughes was a partner in a family law firm, Hughes Dowdall, in
Glasgow.
   The inquiry, expected to last three months, is due to focus on
ways of preventing a similar disaster. It will not take evidence on
the key question of criminal responsibility for the bombing.
   Police have said the bomb hidden in a radio-cassette recorder in
a suitcase was probably put aboard the New York-bound flight in
Frankfurt. The flight changed from a Boeing 727 to a Boeing 747 at
London's Heathrow Airport.
   Scottish officials have said they are investigating Ahmed
Jibril's radical Palestinian group, the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command, and Mohammed Abu Talb of
the Popular Struggle Front, who was convicted of bombings in
Europe.

   Conservative Zulu leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi has refused to meet Nelson Mandela to discuss
ways to end savage factional fighting that has claimed hundreds of
lives, officials said today.
   The African National Congress said Buthelezi, leader of the
Inkatha Party, declined an invitation to attend a meeting Friday of
black homeland leaders at Mandela's home in Soweto outside
Johannesburg.
   ``The ANC would have preferred if Mr. Buthelezi would have
attended the consultative meeting on Friday,'' said ANC spokesman
Abba Omar.
   Inkatha officials said Buthelezi was visiting Switzerland and
they had no immediate comment.
   ANC officials said they hoped Buthelezi's refusal to attend the
meeting would not derail efforts to end fighting between the two
groups. The meeting was called last month when dozens of people
were being killed daily in black townships around Johannesburg.
   ``The ANC feels the peace initiatives that we have begun on the
ground, and which involved Inkatha members, will continue,'' Omar
said.
   It was not clear how the ANC could have any meaningful dialogue
with Inkatha without Buthelezi playing a role.
   Buthelezi had expressed reservations about attending the meeting
because he was invited as leader of the KwaZulu homeland. He said
he would attend as head of Inkatha and asked for a preliminary
meeting with Mandela.
   Government officials, meanwhile, said today they were still
considering a call from Mandela for an emergency meeting on
political violence. An official spokesman, who declined to be
identified, said the government thought such a meeting would not be
``worthwhile'' at this time.
   Some 800 people have been killed since August in black townships
around Johannesburg in bloody battles pitting Xhosas and other
blacks loyal to the ANC against Zulus linked to Inkatha. Similar
fighting has claimed about 5,000 lives in recent years in Natal
province.
   ANC officials said Mandela would meet Friday with five other
black homeland leaders. Homelands were set up by the South African
government as separate states for blacks under the apartheid
system.
   The ANC's proposal to include Buthelezi among the weak homeland
leaders was seen by many observers as an attempt to sideline the
Inkatha leader.
   Buthelezi, who heads Inkatha and the KwaZulu homeland, has
demanded a one-on-one meeting with Mandela to prove they are the
country's two top black leaders. Mandela has declined such a
meeting, mainly because of pressure from other ANC leaders who
refuse to have anything to do with Buthelezi.
   Buthelezi has accused the ANC of attempting to monopolize
political power and excluding other black political groups from
talks on ending white minority rule. President F.W. de Klerk has
promised to end apartheid and share power with the black majority.
   The ANC and Inkatha both oppose apartheid, but differ over plans
for a future South Africa. Inkatha wants a free-market economy and
appeals to Zulu nationalism, while the ANC is more leftist and pan
tribal.
   In other developments, police said a man was killed today in
Durban on the east coast when a bomb exploded at a computer
company. The company is owned by a white member of the ANC and one
of his workers was killed and two women workers injured, they said.
   No group claimed responsibility for the blast, police said.

   Police are looking for a ``clean-cut''
rapist who calls himself St. Peter, chops off his victims' hair as
a sacrifice to God and carves crosses in their backs.
   The man raped three women he picked up in his car last month,
said police Sgt. C. Roberson. He identified himself as ``St. Peter,
the messenger of the Lord,'' and cut off the victims' hair, saying
he would present it to God in order to cleanse their souls.
   After raping two of the women, the man carved an upside down
cross into their backs with a knife. He was about to mark the third
woman, but she was able to flee, Roberson said.
   ``Everyone tells us he's clean cut, fairly good looking,
articulate and real meticulous,'' said Roberson. ``He seems to be
real nice on the onset.''
   The rapes occurred Sept. 16, 21 and 28. Two were in Long Beach
and the other in the Harbor area of Los Angeles. Two victims had
been hitchhiking and the third entered the man's beige Volvo after
he offered her a ride, police said.

<HEAD>Man Accused of Torching Abortion Clinic Apparently Acted Alone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An abortion clinic fire that pro-choice
supporters blamed on the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue
apparently was started by a man accused of burglarizing a nearby
veterans center, authorities said.
   ``He said he had no reason. He is not an activist. He has no
opinion on abortion, pro or con,'' said police Detective Cleve
Palmer.
   ``He may have done it to throw suspicion back on the
protesters,'' Palmer said.
   Authorities on Friday arrested David Brian Martin, 31, after
recovering plants, a computer and some typewriters stolen from the
Veterans Counseling Center the night of the Sept. 4 blaze.
   Investigators also found at Martin's home wooden matches similar
to ones found at the Planned Parenthood office, police said. Martin
lives across the street from both the clinic and the veterans
center.
   Martin told investigators he was drinking and doesn't recall
setting fire to the clinic, Palmer said. He was being held on
$5,400 bail.
   The fire did about $100,000 in damage to the clinic's waiting
room, file room and laboratory.
   Immediately after the fire, Planned Parenthood supporters said
they suspected anti-abortion activists who had been picketing the
clinic two to three days a week.
   Operation Rescue denied involvement and spokeswoman Judie Hockel
said the arrest vindicates the organization.

<TEXT>
   Police opened fire on a stone-throwing
mob today, killing two people, as thousands of villagers rampaged
through the government district of the capital. One policeman also
was killed.
   The riot followed a student-led rally of more than 100,000
people to protest a federal policy to reserve up to half of public
jobs for low-caste Indians. There were indications the rally was
exploited by politicians seeking to destablize the government of
Prime Minister V.P. Singh.
   Police used gunfire when tear gas failed to disperse the mob. A
police spokesman said two people were killed, and news agencies
reported seven people were wounded.
   One policeman was killed by an unknown gunman in the crowd, said
a police inspector who declined to be identified.
   At least two other policemen were injured, apparently by stones,
news agencies reported.
   The violence ended four days of relative calm in the Indian
capital following riots that crippled parts of New Delhi last week
and affected supplies of gasoline, water and basic foodstuffs.
   Near the rally site, mobs set fire to a five-story government
building, damaging the ground floor of the Ministry of Food and
Civil Supplies, fire officials said.
   ``I have never seen such a dirty crowd,'' said Kanwaljit Deol,
commander of the 3,000 police deployed in a two-mile stretch of the
lawn where the rally was held. Brigades of paramilitary forces were
called in assist police.
   New Delhi police Chief Vijan Karan said mobs set ablaze two fire
engines, hurled stones at police patrols and government buildings
and smashed windows.
   The rally was the largest yet in the student-led movement
fighting Singh's job policy, which he announced Aug. 7.
   Since then, 70 people have died in protests and riots, including
about 20 youths who set themselves on fire or ate poison.
   Today's violence began after fiery speeches from student
leaders, social activists and farmers lambasting Singh.
   The speeches were punctuated by chants of ``Death to V.P.
Singh!'' and ``Whoever lives like Hitler, dies like Hitler!''
   Offices and most shops were closed for a national holiday. It
was the 121st anniversary of the birth of India's independence
leader Mohandas K. Gandhi, the prophet of non-violence.
   Police and some students claimed many participants in today's
rally were bused in from the neighboring largely rural Haryana
state to create turmoil that could destablize the government.
   A political rival of Singh, Devi Lal, has resigned from
Parliament to protest Singh's handling of the job-quota issue. He
has a substantial following in the countryside and is a senior
leader of Singh's Janata Dal party.
   ``The students have been outmaneuvered by the politicians,''
said Rajev Awasthi, who said he quit the student committee that
helped organize the rally when he saw it lose control.
   The rally went ahead despite a Supreme Court injunction Monday
ordering the government to halt the job quota program until the
court rules on its legality.
   The disputed policy reserves 27 percent of government jobs for
lower classes, in addition to a 22 percent quota previously set
aside for the most deprived castes.
   Upper-caste students claim they are victims of reverse
discrimination and would lose prized jobs to less qualified people.
   Singh's 10-month-old coalition won office largely on the
strength of the middle classes and intellectuals protesting alleged
corruption of Rajiv Gandhi's government.
   The new prime minister has said he endorsed the quotas to give
social justice to Indians deprived because of their caste. The
caste system assigns social status of Hindus according to birth,
and it often determines educational and professional opportunities.
   Modern India, which is 82 percent Hindu, professes secularism
and has outlawed discrimination by caste, but the system persists.

   A tractor-trailer rammed a disabled
Greyhound bus on the side of Interstate 65 and set it afire today,
killing one person and injuring 15, authorities said.
   Liz Dunn, public relations manager for Greyhound Lines, said the
truck hit the left rear of the bus and knocked it into a relief bus
as passengers were transferring to the new bus.
   The accident occurred about 5:15 a.m. on the southern edge of
the city, about 15 miles south of downtown Nashville.
   Passengers had been heading from Birmingham, Ala., to Detroit.
   The disabled bus caught fire in its engine compartment, but it
was quickly extinguished, Dunn said. The truck, which carried
produce, came to rest 100 yards up the highway and also burned.
   Dunn said the person killed was a bus passenger.
   ``They could have been outside, I'm not sure if they were on the
bus or walking from the disabled bus to the relief bus,'' Dunn
said.
   ``Both buses had four- way flashers on and were parked on the
shoulder,'' she said.
   Five people were critically injured, and 10 others also were
taken to hospitals, authorities said. Rescue workers had to pull
some people from the windows of the disabled bus.
   The truck was en route from Tipton, Ga., to Nashville,
authorities said.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Walter R. Tucker, a gun control
advocate who made Compton the first city in California to outlaw
automatic weapons, has died of cancer at age 66.
   Tucker died Monday at Kaiser Hospital in the Los Angeles suburb
of Bellflower. First elected mayor in 1981, he was serving his
third term.
   ``It is one of the most tragic losses Compton has ever had,''
said Councilwoman Patricia A. Moore. ``He was so important to this
community - to Compton's history. We loved him dearly.''
   A member of the Board of Directors of the National Conference of
Black Mayors, Tucker championed federally funded urban
redevelopment and job training.
   He was an early and vigorous advocate of gun control. In 1989,
Compton banned the sale and possession of automatic weapons after
the slayings of five schoolchildren in Stockton.
   Born in Oklahoma, Tucker became active in civic affairs shortly
after he moved to Compton in 1957. He started his political career
as a school board trustee in 1967 and was a city councilman for
four years before becoming mayor.
   A dentist by profession, Tucker also was a past board president
of the National Dental Association.
   Tucker is survived by his wife, Martha; two daughters; and two
sons.

<TEXT>
   President Bush has a ``tough job selling'' the
budget compromise he negotiated with Congress, a Republican
dissenter said today as the president began an arm-twisting drive
to win support.
   ``People are very skeptical about this kind of solution coming
from Washington,'' said Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa., who has declared
his opposition to the package of tax increases and spending cuts.
   Tauke is in a tough Senate race as he tries to unseat Democrat
Tom Harkin, and like other Republican challengers Bush hopes are
victorious in November, Tauke was quick to break with the president
on the budget agreement.
   Harkin complained that ``senior citizens and our family farmers
will suffer disproportionately'' under the agreement and said he
would spend the next couple of days studying it carefully.
   Bush summoned nearly 60 skeptical Republican members of Congress
to the White House to urge them to back the agreement.
   ``He's going to be twisting arms and cajoling and telling people
that if you are not supportive of this, we ask you to take another
look and think anew,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``He's got a tough job selling it,'' said Tauke.
   ``Muggers in pinstriped suits,'' cried Rep. Lynn Martin, the
Republican trying to unseat Democratic Sen. Paul Simon. ``They're
back at your pocketbook again.''
   ``Throw out the leadership of Congress,'' said Martin,
apparently excluding Bush from the gang of ``muggers.''
   Simon left himself a little more room to maneuver, saying, ``The
more I see of it, the less willing I am to support it.''
   The plan would enact permanent tax increases while leaving
spending cuts up to Congress to enact in the future, complained
Rep. Newt Gingrich, one of Congress' leading conservatives.
Gingrich, R-Ga., also was upset that the plan did not contain
enough measures to help businesses.
   ``We can do better for America,'' said Gingrich, the No. 2 House
Republican. ``This package will lose jobs, raise taxes and deepen
the recession.''
   The cries of outrage over the compromise were bipartisan on
Monday and came with certain swiftness from politicians running for
higher office or suspected of harboring such ambitions.
   ``I'm opposed to it,'' said Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York, who
could be Bush's Democratic opponent in 1992. ``Every middle-class
person will be forced to pay more for tobacco, gasoline, alcohol
while the rich go free because President Bush promised the
conservatives we wouldn't tax the rich people.''
   ``Fiscal irresponsibility,'' said Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of
Virginia, another Democrat.
   Only last week, Bush campaigned in Illinois for Martin and in
Michigan for Rep. Bill Schuette, who is challenging Democratic Sen.
Carl Levin.
   ``My inclinations and leanings are that this is a bad
agreement,'' said Schuette, who defended the president as having
``gone the last mile'' before being forced into the deal by
``liberal Democrats.''
   An aide to Rep. Claudine Schneider, the Rhode Island Republican
challenging Sen. Claiborne Pell, said Schneider was ``evaluating
it, studying it, trying to ascertain that no one group is being
singled out.''
   On his campaign swing, Bush threatened to put the blame squarely
on the Democrats if negotiators failed to reach an agreement and
the government ground to a halt.
   ``I will take that message to every state in the Union,'' he
said.
   But an agreement was reached and this week found the president
switching from bashing Democrats to trying to persuade Republicans.
   ``I think this hurts the Republicans,'' said Lyn Nofziger, White
House political director during President Reagan's first two years
in office. ``I think it's going to hurt our election chances next
month.''
   Nofziger said the agreement ``takes an issue away from the
Republicans. How can they go out and say, by golly, we're not going
to raise taxes.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle said that if an incumbent votes
against the package, ``there will be a lot of heavy water to carry
on the campaign trail.''
   Political operatives involved in 1990 campaigns were more
cautious in their assessment.
   ``I don't know what is going to happen,'' said Anita Dunn of the
Democratic Senate Campaign committee. ``I don't know who is going
to vote for what and I don't know what the final vote is going to
look like.''
   ``Today is really a day of assessing and studying,'' said Wendy
Burnley, spokeswoman for the Republican campaign committee.

<TEXT>
   An escaped convict was acquitted of a
rape charge after claiming that a woman whose home he broke into in
the middle of the night was living out a fantasy when she had sex
with him.
   Gilbert Stevens Diamond was convicted of burglary, assault and
escape charges Monday but found innocent of rape in the Dec. 17
incident.
   His attorney, public defender Richard Reinhart, had called the
sex encounter ``something she did to him'' and said the 48-year-old
woman reported it only because she felt guilty afterward.
   Neither the woman nor jurors would discuss the case after the
verdict was announced.
   The woman testified last week that she awakened to find Diamond
sitting on top of her, with one hand on her throat and a knife in
the other hand. She said she submitted to sex - and even suggested
one sex act to Diamond - after he threatened to kill her.
   Moments after Diamond left the home, the hysterical woman called
Manatee County's emergency telephone number. The jury twice heard a
tape recording of the call.
   ``I can't believe this is happening,'' the woman sobbed over and
over on the tape.
   Circuit Judge Robert Boylston had forbidden the public defender
to ask the woman questions about her sexual conduct. But Reinhart
stated his fantasy theory in his argument to the jury, without
objection from prosecutors.
   Assistant State Attorney James Parker described the woman's
submission as a question of life or death.
   ``Knowing that rape was inevitable, she had nothing to do but
save her life,'' Parker told the jury. ``She had to do what was
necessary in order to survive.''
   The judge set sentencing on the assault, burglary and escape
convictions for Nov. 1.
   Diamond, 31, was convicted in January 1989 of burglary and
assault. He had been assigned to a work-release program, and
testified he escaped by walking away from his dishwasher's job at a
restaurant.

<TEXT>
   Iraq challenged President Bush today to
demand that Israel dispose of its nuclear weapons arsenal in return
for the removal of other weapons of mass destruction in the hands
of the Arabs.
   An Iraqi government spokesman, reacting to Bush's speech at the
United Nations on Monday, said:
   ``We support the removal of all mass destruction weapons from
the region, provided this applies not only to chemical or other
weapons the Arabs possess but also the nuclear weapons Israel
has...
   ``And we challenge Bush, who is ever so careful not to anger
Israel, to declare a clear-cut position regarding this issue and
make the suggestion to Israel,'' the spokesman said. His statement
was carried by the official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia.
   He said, ``Bush should prove he is sincere in his call for peace
and security in the region and worldwide.
   ``Or is he again using the flowery calls for peace and for the
removal of the threat of mass destruction weapons as a camouflage
for ill intentions he harbors against the Arab people, their wealth
and sanctities?''
   Israel has never responded directly to allegations it has
nuclear weapons, saying only that it will not be the first country
in the region to introduce such weapons.
   Western intelligence reports say that Israel possesses up to 100
atomic bombs and nuclear warheads.
   In 1981, Israeli warplanes destroyed an Iraqi nuclear reactor
believed to be developing an atomic bomb.
   
   Iraq has been condemned by the United Nations for using chemical
weapons, banned under a 1925 Geneva protocol, in its 1980-88 war
with Iran.
   Baghdad also has been widely criticized for using mustard gas
and other chemicals in a crackdown on rebellious Kurds, becoming
the first country to use such weapons against its own people.
   Iran claimed the Iraqis killed some 4,000 Kurds in the March
1988 attack on the Iraqi Kurds, who allied themselves with Iran
during the war.
   U.N. teams who inspected victims hospitalized in Iran found
traces of the outlawed weapons, including blisters, severe burns
and darkened skin.
   Iraq also was reported to be developing biological weapons,
including toxins that spread lethal diseases.

<DATELINE>LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unruly mob today broke down police
barricades and stormed the courtroom where ousted Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto was to stand trial for corruption.
   Dozens of people, including policemen and journalists, were
injured in the stampede, apparently aimed at delaying the court
proceedings until after the Oct. 24 parliamentary elections.
   Hundreds of police, armed with steel-tipped batons and automatic
rifles stood by, prohibited by law from using force around the
Punjab High Court.
   Ms. Bhutto, pale and visibly shaken by the outburst, waited with
her lawyers and bodyguards in a room adjacent to the courtroom.
   After more than two hours of pandemonium, Justice Rashid Aziz
Khan adjourned the hearing until Oct. 9, the day Ms. Bhutto is to
stand trial before him on another corruption charge.
   Police blamed Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party for the
melee.
   Ms. Bhutto's lawyers accused police commandos of triggering the
violence to deliberately discredit the former prime minister and
her Pakistan People's Party. The party seems to be gaining strength
since the army-backed caretaker government resurrected the
one-judge special tribunals to try members of her ousted government
for corruption.
   Ms. Bhutto's political opponets were expected to try to
capitalize on the violence, portraying it as an example of her
party's disrespect for law and order.
   Ms. Bhutto's government was dismissed after only 20 months by
President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, who cited charges ranging from
corruption and nepotism to abuse of power.
   Ms. Bhutto and half a dozen former Cabinet ministers have been
charged with corruption before the tribunals.
   The charge before Aziz Khan today accused her of selling
government-protected land to a London-based firm owned by a cousin.
The land reportedly sold at below market value.
   Other charges to e heard before tribunals in her hometown of
Karachi allege she illegally used an Asia Development Bank loan to
hire a foreign consulting firm to oversee a Karachi power project
and allowed a British-based firm to export cotton at rates far
below the international market rate.
   She is also accused of giving lucrative contracts for the
distribution of liquified gas to family and friends.
   Ms. Bhuutto has said she does not recognize the jurisdiction of
the special tribunals, which were orginally set up in 1977 during
the days of martial law.
   But she has said she is appearing in protest to show the
hollowness and maliciousness of the caretaker government, which is
comprised of former allies and bitter critics.
   She has vehemently denied any wrongdoing.
   If she is convicted of any of the four charges she could be
disqualified from the Oct. 24 polls and banned from politics for up
to seven years.

   Two lots of a prescription antihistamine are
being recalled because the packages may contain a blood pressure
medication, the Fod and Drug Administration said today.
   The antihistamine is Bioline brand hydroxyzine pamoate in 50
milligram capsules.
   The blood pressure medication, 2 mg clonidine hydrochloride,
comes in scored, peach-colored tablets, with a ``dp'' logo above
the scoreline and ``02'' below the line.
   If a consumer finds that a bottle that is supposed to contain
the Bioline capsules instead contains the tablets, they should
return it to the pharmacy where they got it, the FDA advised.
   Someone who takes the blood pressure drug in the amounts
directed for the antihistamine could become dizzy and fall, the
agency said.
   Both drugs are made by Duramed Pharmaceuticals of Cincinnati,
Ohio. Labels are supplied by the distributor, Bioline Laboratries
of Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.
   Bioline is asking pharmacists to examine lots 91009 and 91240.
   About 237 bottles from these lots were distributed nationally,
the FDA said.

   President Bush, heartened by unbroken support
he heard from world leaders for standing up to Saddam Hussein, says
he hopes the Iraqi leader will reverse course and withdraw from
Kuwait.
   Bush met today with the Soviet Union's military chief, Gen.
Mikhail Moiseyev, who applauded the steps Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev have taken in arranging high-level exchanges
between superpower military officials.
   ``We cherish what is uniting our two nations today, and we fully
understand the contribution you both made to the improvement of our
ties,'' the general told Bush.
   Bush also met today with Chile President Patricio Aylwin, and
was meeting later with Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi. In their
first meeting since Aylwin's inauguration returned democratic rule
to Chile last March, Bush told the Chilean president that relations
between the two countries ``are moving in the right direction.''
   The president, who faces a hard sales job to both the public and
politicians on his $500 billion deficit-cutting deal, was keeping
the emphasis on foreign affairs after returning late Monday from a
weekend whirlwind of diplomacy in New York.
   Bush held one-on-one talks with nearly two dozen world leaders
and renewed his indictment of Iraq in an address to the U.N.
General Assembly that held out the possibility of ``opportunities''
for settling Saddam's quarrels with Kuwait once Iraq withdraws
unconditionally.
   At a news conference after signing a stopgap resolution keeping
the government running until Friday, Bush said he felt optimistic
both that the tough U.N. economic sanctions against Iraq are
holding fast and that the message is getting through to Saddam that
he stands alone.
   ``Let's hope that that, coupled with the economic sanctions,
will cause him to do what he's done in the past: do a 180 (-degree
turn) and get out,'' said Bush. He said the Iraqi president had
executed a turnabout in dealing with his old war adversary, Iran.
   Bush said ``there's no flexibility'' on the demand for a
complete Iraqi withdrawal and restoration of the government of
Kuwait.
   But he said he was not pressing at this point for a new U.N.
resolution to unleash force against Iraq. Bush said he shares
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's view that the
multilateral force in the gulf already has that authority.
   He said he found ``totally solid support for the U.N. position
and the U.S. position'' among the world leaders. ``What I'm
optimistic about is that there isn't one single breach in the
armor'' of worldwide condemnation of Iraq, he said.
   The stopgap funding resolution also frees more money for
Operation Desert Shield, in which the United States has dispatched
some 165,000 troops to Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf.
   The president's 23rd and last meeting in New York was with
President Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador, who assured Bush that
he will push the murder investigation ``in the ugly case of the
Jesuits ... until the end.''
   Six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter were
killed during Cristiani's election campaign last November, and the
military has been accused of obstructing the investigation, in
which government troops have been implicated.
   Earlier, the White House announced the United States is sending
two batteries of Patriot air-defense missiles to Israel to defend
against an increased threat from Iraq.

<HEAD>French Fire Warning Shots To Halt North Korean Freighter</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Gulf Rdp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A French warship fired warning shots today to halt
a North Korean freighter near Djibouti, the first use of naval
firepower by France to help enforce the trade embargo against Iraq.
   Military officials in Paris said the corvette Doudart de Lagree
opened fire after the freighter Sam Il Po defied an order to stop
for inspection.
   The warship set off in pursuit, firing blank warning shots from
more than 300 yards away before a third shot from closer range
prompted the freighter to halt, officials said.
   A French search party then boarded the freighter, officials
said. The vessel was allowed to resume its passage after searchers
determined it did not appear to be violating the U.N. embargo
imposed on Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
   The incident occurred in the Bab al Mandab strait, linking the
Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. French officials did not say where
the freighter began its journey or where it was headed.
   It was the fifth interception in which warning shots were fired
since the blockade was imposed Aug. 6, four days after Iraq invaded
Kuwait. The earlier incidents involved U.S. warships and an
Australian frigate.
   It was the 16th time French search teams have boarded vessels in
connection with the blockade.
   The Foreign Ministry said today that 332 French citizens
remained trapped in Iraq or Kuwait, including 67 held at strategic
sites in Iraq to deter possible military attacks.
   The ministry said Iraq's decision this week to free nine French
hostages was good news for their families, but would in no way
soften France's insistence that all foreign hostages be freed by
Iraq.
   The nine, expected back in France by Wednesday night, apparently
were chosen at random and were not among those held at strategic
sites, the ministry said.
   The release was announced by Iraq on Monday, a day after Saddam
Hussein said he would like to launch a dialogue with France based
on remarks by President Francois Mitterrand at the United Nations
last week.
   Mitterrand apparently piqued Saddam's interest by suggesting
that resolution of the crisis caused by the Iraqi invasion might be
followed by initiatives to solve the problems of Lebanon and the
Palestinians. But Mitterrand reiterated the West's insistence that
Iraq withdraw from Kuwait and free all hostages before any
negotiations take place.
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas has suggested that Saddam is
attempting to drive a wedge between France and the United States.

   The Bush administration urged the Supreme
Court today to let Oklahoma City children attend the schools
nearest to their homes even if that results in racial imbalance.
   ``The school board has no realistic control over where people
choose to live,'' Solicitor General Kenneth Starr, the
administration's top courtroom lawyer, said in arguing that
Oklahoma City's schools should be freed from a court-ordered
desegregation plan.
   But Julius Chambers, the New York City lawyer representing those
black parents who challenged the neighborhood school plan, said the
court should not turn back the clock. He opposed the plan adopted
by the city school board in 1985 for students in kindergarten
through fourth grade.
   ``You should not let the school district in Oklahoma City, or in
any other city, reinstate the same assignment practices that caused
segregation in the past,'' Chambers argued.
   How the justices resolve the Oklahoma City dispute - a decision
is expected by July - could determine the future racial makeup of
public schools in hundreds of American cities.
   At issue is what once-segregated school districts can do after
achieving racial balance under court-ordered plans.
   The court must decide whether school districts like Oklahoma
City's may abandon forced busing and other desegregation tactics
once a federal court rules they have become fully integrated.
   Ronald Day, representing the city's school board, said
residential segregation of the races ``is a phenomenon over which
this school board, indeed no school board, has control.''
   Starr, representing the federal government, warned the court
against ``placing undue emphasis on the numbers.'' He added, ``No
one is assigned on the grounds of race.''
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, the court's only black member and the
winning lawyer in the 1954 Supreme Court case that outlawed
racially segregated public schools, challenged Starr's assertions.
   ``The poor Afro-American kid is still in the same school,''
Marshall said. ``It remains a segregated school.''
   A federal judge ruled in 1977 that Oklahoma City schools had
achieved full integration, and eight years later city school
officials returned to a neighborhood schools plan for children in
kindergarten through fourth grade.
   The racial balance that had been achieved through busing
disappeared, and some parents called the result ``resegregation.''
   Hundreds of school districts, including those in most major
cities, operate court-ordered busing plans for racial
desegregation. Only a few have persuaded courts to declare their
once-segregated systems fully integrated, but the potential impact
of the high court's ruling in the Oklahoma City case is enormous
nevertheless.
   A federal appeals court disapproved the Oklahoma City
neighborhood schools plan last year, ruling that federal court
supervision in such cases ``extends beyond the termination of the
wrongdoing.''
   The city's schools once were racially segregated by law. Black
parents sued in 1961 to end the last effects of such segregation,
and in 1972 a court-ordered desegregation plan was put into place.
   U.S. District Judge Luther Bohanon ruled in 1977 that the school
district had become fully integrated, and ended his supervision.
   School officials continued the crosstown busing, however, until
1985 when children in kindergarten through fourth grade were
allowed to attend the school nearest their home.
   By 1986, 33 of the school district's 64 elementary schools were
90 percent black or white.
   After some black parents challenged the new racial makeup,
Bohanon ruled that the 1972 desegregation plan no longer had to be
enforced.
   But the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in reversing
Bohanon's ruling, said the Oklahoma City school board has a
continuing duty to refrain from any action that could weaken racial
balance in the public schools.
   Other federal appeals courts have ruled - in cases from Norfolk,
Va., and Austin, Texas - that a local school board's obligation to
promote racial balance ends when the school district is declared
``unitary'' or fully integrated.
   The justices opened the court's 1990-91 term with a flurry of
activity Monday. The court:
   -Agreed to decide in an Ohio case whether juries may impose
stiffer sentences because of a crime's impact on the victims or
their families.
   -Said it will consider letting states outlaw all barroom-style
nude dancing. The court will review a ruling that struck down such
an Indiana ban.
   -Refused to free a Southern Baptist seminary in New Orleans from
having to grant a divinity degree to a man the seminary says is
unfit for Christian ministry.
   -Voted to consider reinstating a libel suit against Janet
Malcolm, a writer for The New Yorker magazine. A lower court threw
out a suit against her by a psychologist who said she made up
quotes attributed to him.
   -Rejected an appeal by an Ohio woman who gave birth to a healthy
boy after she underwent an unsuccessful abortion. The woman tried
to sue a doctor and hospital for the costs of rearing the child.

   Iraq has strengthened its forces in southern Iraq and Kuwait and
has now deployed nearly half its 1 million-man army to defend the
occupied territory, U.S. military sources said today.
   In the Persian Gulf, meanwhile, the aircraft carrier USS
Independence arrived on a visit intended partly as a ``show of
force'' against Iraq, a Navy officer said in Saudi Arabia.
   The 79,000-ton carrier and several ships of its battle group
passed through the Strait of Hormuz, the only gateway to the gulf,
today and are now operating in the waterway, a statement from the
Pentagon said.
   ``The Independence and its escorts will remain in the Persian
Gulf for a short period to conduct normal operations,'' the
Pentagon said.
   A French warship today fired warning shots to halt a North
Korean freighter near Djibouti in the Bab al Mandab strait linking
the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. It was the first use of naval
firepower by France to help enforce the trade embargo against Iraq.
   Military officials in Paris said the corvette Doudart de Lagree
opened fire after the freighter Sam Il Po defied an order to stop
for inspection.
   A French search party then boarded the freighter, officials
said. The vessel was allowed to resume its passage after searchers
determined it did not appear to be violating the U.N. embargo on
Iraq. French officials did not say where the freigther began its
journey or where it was headed.
   It was the fifth interception in which warning shots were fired
since the naval blockade was imposed Aug. 6, four days after Iraq
invaded Kuwait. The earlier incidents involved U.S. warships and an
Australian frigate.
   More Egyptian soldiers were headed to Saudi Arabia today. Two
ships passed through the Suez Canal headed for the Saudi Red Sea
port of Yanbu. Canal officials said they carried troops and
military hardware but gave no details.
   At the United Nations, Iraq unexpectedly postponed its speech to
the General Assembly on Monday just hours after President Bush
hinted that an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait could help resolve
Arab-Israeli tensions.
   Iraq's U.N. Mission gave no explanation for rescheduling the
address to Wednesday. Diplomats speculated, however, that Baghdad
wanted time to evaluate Bush's message.
   Earlier Monday, Iraqi Ambassador Abdul Amir al-Anbari praised
Bush for saying he preferred ``a diplomatic outcome.''
   In his speech, Bush said Iraq's unconditional withdrawal from
Kuwait could create ``opportunities: for Iraq and Kuwait to settle
their differences permanently; for the states of the gulf
themselves to build new arrangements for stability; and for all the
states and peoples of the region to settle the conflict that
divides the Arabs from Israel.''
   The U.S. military sources in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, said
analysts estimate there are well over 400,000 Iraqi troops in
southern Iraq and Kuwait, compared to 360,000 a week ago.
   The numbers of tanks, artillery pieces and other heavy weapons
have also been increased, the sources said, speaking on condition
of anonymity. They gave no figures.
   The Pentagon said last week there were about 3,500 Iraqi tanks
in the ``Kuwait theater.'' Most are believed to be in defensive
positions, many dug-in behind earthworks.
   The buildup of recent weeks is concentrated in areas inland from
the Persian Gulf and in a crescent around Kuwait.
   The Iraqis were also said to have reinforced their defenses
along the supply lifeline from the southern Iraq city of Basra into
Kuwait. The highway runs about 20 miles to the border and another
50 miles to Kuwait City.
   U.S. and Saudi officials have stressed that the allied forces
are in defensive positions to protect against an Iraqi invasion of
Saudi Arabia.
   But many analysts have discounted the possibility of an invasion
in view of the buildup of U.S. troops, now around 165,000, in the
kingdom.
   The Saudi government says it will not allow the United States to
initiate offensive action against the Iraqis from Saudi soil
without their consent.
   The offensive capabilities of U.S. forces have been underscored
in recent days by ship-borne U.S. Marine units conducting
amphibious landing exercises in Oman, and by the arrival in the
gulf of the USS Independence.
   In Paris today, Foreign Minister Roland Dumas dismissed Iraq's
order Monday to release nine French hostages as insignificant, but
suggested Baghdad may be softening its line in the gulf crisis.
   On Sunday, Saddam complimented President Francois Mitterrand for
offering positive ideas to resolve the crisis and called for
replacing the language of ``threats and warnings'' with dialogue.
   In an interview from the United Nations, Dumas told the French
television network La Cinq: ``We are obliged to say that no gesture
has yet come from Iraq that modifies the basic problems. We simply
note a change in tone.''
   In other developments today:
   -Iraq challenged President Bush to demand that Israel dispose of
its nuclear weapons arsenal in return for the removal of other mass
destruction weapons in the hands of the Arabs. The statement was
carried by the official Iraqi News Agency.
   -In Jerusalem, a faulty siren signaled ``air attack,'' sending
Israelis scurrying into bomb shelters less than 24 hours after the
government decided to distribute gas masks to the public.
   It took a half hour before radio announcers broke into regular
programs to calm hundreds of anxious callers with the news that the
siren system went off by accident.
   Israel announced Monday it would start distributing gas masks to
its 4.7 million citizens.
   -A European Community official said the trading bloc has agreed
to give $2 billion in aid to Egypt, Jordan and Turkey to help
offset the impact of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   -Prime Minister Toshiku Kaifu of Japan began a Middle East tour
after promising the United Nations in New York to contribute
nonmilitary personnel and material to the international effort to
end the gulf crisis.

   The Navy sent the aircraft carrier
Independence into the Persian Gulf today as a show of strength in
the continuing military buildup against the forces of Iraq's
president, Saddam Hussein.
   The Pentagon said in a statement that the Independence and the
carrier battle group accompanying it will have an opportunity to
become familiar with the ``unique operating conditions'' in the
restricted waters of the Gulf between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
   But it said the presence of the Independence will also ``provide
a visible demonstration of the operational capabilities of a
carrier battle group to our friends and allies in the region.''
   No U.S. carrier has entered the Gulf since the USS Constellation
sailed there in 1974.
   ``Although the movement of one of our carrier battle groups into
the Persian Gulf is unusual, it is not unprecedented and is not
meant in any way to increase regional tensions,'' the Pentagon
said.
   The Independence carries some 75 aircraft, including F-14 Tomcat
fighters, F/A-18 Hornet strike fighters, A-6 Intruder attack
aircraft, S-3 Viking anti-submarine warfare aircraft, EA-6B Prowler
electronic warfare aircraft, E-2C Hawkeye airborne early warning
aircraft, and SH-3 Sea King helicopters.
   The Independence approached the Gulf through the Straits of
Hormuz Monday night. It had been positioned in the Gulf of Oman
which connects to the Persian Gulf through the straits.

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West African soldiers backed by
government troops and a rebel faction advanced behind a barrage of
heavy artillery against Charles Taylor's rebels early today,
forcing them to retreat.
   The French news agency Agence France-Presse reported the joined
forces launched the offensive Monday night, and forced Taylor's
army to retreat several hundred yards from strategic positions near
the presidential mansion.
   To the north of the besieged city, the five-nation West African
task force was led across swamps by rebels of rival guerrilla
leader Prince Johnson for an attack in which they seized Taylor's
front line facing Monrovia port, the French agency reported. The
West African army has its headquarters in the port.
   Hundreds of civilians fled fighting in the two-pronged attack
that followed a weeklong cease-fire called by Taylor.
   Agence France-Press quoted rebels as saying the West Africans
had pushed Taylor's forces back nearly four miles from northern
Monrovia, and were threatening to encirle the rebel army.
   The task force of 5,000 soldiers from Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea,
Gambia and Sierra Leone has been under pressure to act from
Johnson's faction. Johnson said he would launch an all-out assault
on Taylor's forces and on remnants of Samuel K. Doe's army holed up
in the mansion if the task force did not intervene.
   Johnson and Doe's officers support a West African plan to impose
a cease-fire and install an interim government of non-combatants to
organize fair elections.
   Taylor has opposed the transitional government, and has declared
himself president of his own temporary government.
   The West African army had been widely criticized for failing to
end the 9-month-old tribal war in which the three Liberian armies
have slaughtered at least 5,000 civilians. Most were killed because
of tribal affiliations.
   The task force went into action Monday, opening fire on Taylor's
positions with warplanes and heavy artillery. Their offensive
follows the arrival last week of a new field commander, Gen. Joshua
Dogonyaro of Nigeria.
   Johnson on Sunday said Taylor's men had attacked him and the
cease-fire had failed. He demanded action from the West Africans.
   Johnson told reporters: ``If I do not see them (the task force)
out there, there will be trouble. I am ready to mount my missiles
and attack the mansion. If they don't get them out, we will bomb
the mansion. I am also ready to move against Charles Taylor.''
   Johnson killed Doe, then Liberia's president, on Sept. 10 after
taking him prisoner at the task force headquarters in a surprise
attack.
   The West African force evacuated 1,000 people from Doe's mansion
after he died, mainly women and children. Some 1,000 soldiers now
trapped in the mansion and nearby Barclary Training Center barracks
refused to be evacuated, saying they did not trust assurances of
safe conduct.

   Lithuania and the Soviet Union agreed today to
maintain economic ties through 1991 and set up working groups to
prepare for negotiations, news agencies reported.
   The agreement came at a meeting between Lithuanian and Soviet
officials in the Kremlin after months of delays to try to settle
the standoff over the Baltic state's independence drive.
   The Lithuanian news agency ELTA reported the delegations agreed
to maintain trade and economic relations for 1991, clearing away
uncertainty about supplies to and from the republic. The Baltic
News Service reported a joint communique said the next meeting
would be held in two weeks.
   Expert groups were told to prepare proposals on providing
pensions to World War II veterans living in Lithaunia and other
issues of social welfare of Soviet citizens, ELTA reported.
   ``Our political position since the founding of (the independence
movement) Sajudis has been frank and clear, and today we will be
able to check out the position of the other side,'' Lithuanian
President Vytautas Landsbergis told a Lithuanian news service on
his way into the meeting.
   The seven-member Lithuanian delegation, headed by Landsbergis,
includes Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene and other top
officials of the republic's government.
   The Soviet delegation is headed by Prime Minister Nikolai
Ryzkhov and includes Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin and Justice
Minister Veniamin Yakovlev.
   Lithuania declared independence March 11, setting the pace for
other Soviet republics seeking more autonomy from the Kremlin. All
but two of the 15 republics have since declared some form of
independence or sovereignty.
   Lithuania agreed to suspend its declaration in July in exchange
for talks with the national government and the lifting of an
economic embargo imposed by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
in April.
   Mrs. Prunskiene said Monday that she expected Gorbachev would
participate in the talks, although he is not a member of the Soviet
delegation, the Estonian News Service reported. It said Gorbachev
did not attend this morning's session.
   Neither side has called the talks ``negotiations.'' The official
Tass news agency referred to the session as a ``consultative
meeting.'' The Estonian News Service referred to the meeting as
``consultations on negotiations.''
   The news agency quoted Landsbergis as saying he hoped the
Soviets would negotiate with an ``open hand'' and that the initial
meeting would produce a concluding general statement and a date for
future talks.
   Lithuania and the other two Baltic republics, Latvia and
Estonia, are refusing to participate in negotiations for a new
treaty linking the republics with the central government. All three
have accused Moscow of dragging its feet in dealing with their
independence claims.

   Alaskans will get more than $950 each from
the state this year as their annual share of earnings from the
$11.2 billion oil-wealth savings account.
   The $952.63 dividend announced Monday is the second-largest
since the state began payouts from the Alaska Permanent Fund in
1982. It is $79 more than the 1989 dividend.
   For a family of four, this year's dividends will total about
$3,810. They are paid to virtually every man, woman and child
residing in Alaska, regardless of income.
   The amount is based on a complex formula that considers the
fund's earnings over the previous five years. The recent doubling
of oil prices because of the Persian Gulf crisis did not affect
this year's dividend.
   Announcement of the dividend amount is widely anticipated in
Alaska, where merchants hold ``dividend sales'' and car dealers
accept the checks as down payments. In the state's poor, rural
areas the dividend is a major source of personal income.
   ``The annual distribution of Permanent Fund dividends is widely
recognized as an important element of the Alaska economy,'' said
state Revenue Commissioner Hugh Malone. ``When the 1990 payout is
complete, over $3 billion will have been put into the hands of
Alaskans since 1982.''
   The 1990 checks will be mailed starting Oct. 9.
   State officials said they expected more first-time applicants to
be rejected because the residency period for eligibility was
extended this year from six months to a year.
   But the state's rising population over the past two years was
adding to the number of applications, offseting most of the decline
attributed to the eligiblity change.
   The total amount of earnings made available for dividends this
year was $482.51 million. The state estimated there would be
506,511 eligible applicants.
   The Permanent Fund is a state trust created by voters in 1976 to
ensure Alaskans benefit from the state's oil wealth long after the
oil is gone. It has saved 20 percent of the $33.2 billion in oil
taxes and royalties received by the state since the huge Prudhoe
Bay field went into production.

   A court awarded City Hall to DeBow last week as payment on more
than $1 million the financially strapped city owed him from a $4
million damage award. The earlier award was set in 1985 for
injuries he suffered in the city jail.
   DeBow's attorney, Clyde Kuehn, said his client wants to seel the
property, long before the property taxes are due.

   A volcano on an uninhabited
island off New Zealand's North Island erupted Tuesday, sending ash
clouds about 10,000 feet in the air, scientists said.
   ``Seismically, it doesn't look like anything unusual, and it's
unclear what changes have taken place on the island,'' a spokesman
from the New Zealand department of scientific and industrial
research's Rotorua office said.
   The eruption, on White Island in the Bay of Plenty area, lasted
about 45 minutes and started at 11:45 a.m.
   The last major eruption in early June doubled the size of the
island's main crater and blew out a new one.
   The volcanic island is about 3.6 miles in circumference, with
three mountains rising above the crater. It is home to large
colonies of birds and is a designated bird sanctuary.

   A cocaine laboratory blew up today in a
house next to a school in Medellin, killing eight people and
leveling several buildings, police said.
   Three of the victims were children, the radio network RCN said.
   Twenty people were injured and several buildings and cars were
destroyed, RCN said.
   Gasoline and other explosive chemicals are used in the
processing of cocaine.
   The explosion appeared to be the result of a bomb placed in the
laboratory, the office of Mayor Omar Flores said in a statement.
   Two Colombian cocaine cartels have been at war for almost two
years in a battle for control of the cocaine smuggling into the New
York City area.
   About 200 people have been killed in the war between the
Medellin cartel and the Cali cartel. The two groups are named after
major Colombian cities where the drug gangs have their
headquarters.

   Taps and near-tears marked the retirement of
the last U.S. diesel-powered attack submarine and the launch of a
new era for the Navy, which now has an all-nuclear underwater
attack fleet.
   Past and present officers and crew of the USS Blueback said
farewell to the vessel Monday during the ceremony at the submarine
base on Point Loma.
   ``We are here to close, with honor, the active life of the
Blueback,'' said a choked-up Cmdr. Thomas A. Grassi. ``It's time to
say farewell to an era and to a gallant lady.''
   The Blueback, which was commissioned in 1959, never saw battle
and most of the time it patrolled the Pacific. But it did its part
for posterity.
   It made the first underwater voyage from Japan to San Diego in
23 days. In 1989, the Blueback was used as a Soviet submarine in
the film, ``The Hunt for Red October.''
   It's final trip will be to the Navy's submarine graveyard in
Bremerton, Wash.
   Grassi was the last of 15 Blueback skippers. The 215-foot
submarine is ``a floating hunk of cold, black metal,'' he said.
``It has been her crew which made her alive.''
   Taps sounded as the crew lowered the vessel's commissioning
pennant. The banner was given to Grassi, who is retiring along with
the sub.
   The ceremony ended an era that began in 1912 when the Navy
launched its first diesel-powered submarine, the Skipjack. The
Navy's only diesel submarine still in service, the Dolphin, is a
non-combatant research ship.
   The transition to a nuclear sub fleet began in 1954 with the
Nautilus.
   Defenders of diesel submarines contend they are quieter, harder
for an enemy to find and cheaper than their nuclear-powered
counterparts.
   Navy officials argue that the newer nuclear models are faster
and more efficient.
   ``Nuclear submarines offer the ability and the endurance to
deploy on station for many days as opposed to the diesel, which is
less capable in a forward-deployed role,'' said Navy spokesman Lt.
Greg Smith.
   Diesel engines drove the Blueback on the surface, and
high-capacity storage batteries powered electric motors when it was
submerged.

   A judge today ordered striking Temple
University professors back to work, saying that education is so
critical that the right to strike must yield.
   ``Education is vital to the health, safety and welfare of this
nation and this community,'' said Common Pleas Judge Samuel Lehrer
in issuing the back-to-work order sought by the university. The
walkout began Sept. 4, the first day of classes.
   The order, which the union said would be appealed, is to become
effective at 8 a.m. Wednesday.
   Temple officials had said they would have to cancel 1,900
classes, or more than 40 percent of those offered, for the entire
semester if professors weren't back by this morning.
   Arthur Hoskner, the president of the union representing the
1,100 teachers, librarians and others, said last week a
back-to-work order would be honored. Today, he said it would be
appealed.
   ``I'm sorry the judge made the wrong decision, but we will
appeal it,'' Hockner said. The next step would be Commonwealth
Court, which may or not grant a stay to the order if the case is
appealed.
   The union represents 1,100 teachers, librarians and others; its
officials would not say how many of them are taking part.
   A state mediator called both sides for a bargaining session
Monday night to see if something could be done before the courts
stepped in. But talks broke off just before 8 a.m. today and Robert
Harrington, Temple's chief negotiator, said there was no progress
made during the night.
   On Sunday, the union had overwhelmingly rejected the school's
latest offer. University officials have testified during hearings
that the four-week strike poses a threat to the public, including
the school's 30,000 students.
   ``Without an injunction the cancellation of classes will affect
6,000 students now without any classes and 23,000 other who have
lost one, two or three classes,'' said Temple lawyer John Langel.
   More than 250 students withdrew from the university Monday,
school officials said.
   Union attorney Alaine Williams had argued unsuccessfully that
there is no constitutional right to a college education, and urged
the judge to order both sides to the bargaining table. The union
presented witnesses who said that even if the strike goes on, it
would be possible for professors to make up for lost time.

<HEAD>Former KGB General Wins Round in Court in Battle for Pension</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge on Tuesday ordered the government to
provide a fuller explanation of its decision to strip a former KGB
general of his officer's pension in retribution for his public
criticism of the intelligence agency.
   ``I hope to achieve one thing: that other people, based on this
precedent, will act more boldly and courageously in their attempts
to restore justice and their human rights,'' former spy Oleg D.
Kalugin told reporters after the court's decision, which he called
a victory.
   ``I am satisfied. This gives us a chance to dig deeper, to find
out something more'' about how the decision was made, Kalugin told
reporters.
   Nikolai Romanenkov, presiding over a three-judge panel,
adjourned the proceedings until Oct. 23 and said the court would
ask the Council of Ministers - the Soviet Cabinet - and the chief
military prosecutor to explain their actions in Kalugin's case.
   If the court meets Kalugin's request to restore his rank,
pension and honors, it would be a landmark for citizens challenging
official secrecy about government decisions.
   ``I am sure there are thousands of these people in the Soviet
Union. I simply set an example for them,'' Kalugin said. He said
the case had no precedent in Soviet law.
   Under reforms President Mikhail S. Gorbachev introduced, the
Soviet parliament has asserted greater control over the government.
But Kalugin and other reformers argue that many officials continue
to follow secret orders.
   Kalugin said after the hearing that the court, by seeking
further information from the government, was pushing Soviet society
toward ``the stage where all secret acts, illegal acts, will be
slowly, gradually be done away with.''
   Officials in the KGB, whose predecessors in the 1930s arrested,
incarcerated and executed millions of citizens with impunity, have
told the Soviet people that the days of terror are over.
   But the KGB and the Soviet leadership reacted harshly last
summer after Kalugin went public with his criticism of the agency,
which gathers intelligence abroad and is responsible for state
security at home.
   Kalugin accused the KGB of tapping telephones and spying on free
trade unionists, clergymen and others who challenge Communist
authorities. KGB spokesmen have denied the charges.
   Publicity surrounding the case helped Kalugin win a seat
representing the southern Russian city of Krasnodar in the Soviet
parliament last month.
   Shortly after Kalugin began his public campaign against the KGB,
the Council of Ministers headed by Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov
issued an order stripping Kalugin ofhis rank of major-general.
   Gorbachev issued a decree revoking honors that Kalugin won
during a career that including a stint from 1958-70 in the United
States. Kalugin has filed a separate civil suit against Gorbachev.
   Viktor Alexeyev, chief of the KGB legal department, told the
court that the agency revoked Kalugin's military pension after he
was demoted, in accordance with a Soviet law. Alexeyev said Kalugin
could receive a normal old-age pension when he becomes eligible, in
five years.
   The judge rejected a motion by Alexeyev to dismiss the case, and
the KGB attorney appeared shaken, breaking into a sweat. His hands
shook as he read aloud from his legal papers before a bank of
Soviet photographers and television cameramen crowded into the
courtroom.
   Kalugin and his attorney, Boris Kuznetsov, told the court that
the KGB action was ``inhumane and a gross violation of the
constitution and of human rights.''
   Alexeyev told the court the KGB decision was based on a order
the Council of Ministers issued June 29.
   Kalugin's attorney requested and received a copy of the order,
noted that it was not signed by Ryzhkov, then asked, ``Is this a
secret order?''
   Alexeyev acknowledged that it was an internal order, and shouts
of ``Good Work!'' rang out in the courtroom.
   The judge, rather than asking for silence, broke into a grin.
   Alexeyev appeared angry as the judge and then a state prosecutor
began to question him for details about KGB's actions in the case.

<HEAD>Study Links Drinking to Death Before Age 65</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Men who habitually drank at least two alcoholic
drinks a day were nearly twice as likely than abstainers to die
before age 65, and the difference for women was three-fold, a study
found.
   Even people who drank at lower levels than such ``heavier''
drinkers showed higher death rates than abstainers.
   The study was based on a national sample of people who died in
1986.
   For women, 40.7 percent of so-called heavier drinkers died
before age 65 versus 13.2 percent of abstainers. For men, the
figures were 42.3 percent versus 22.4 percent.
   The numbers cannot be interpreted as indicating risks of early
death because of the way the study was done, cautioned study
co-author Darryl Bertolucci.
   The study began with people who already were dead, and worked
backward in time to classify them on their drinking habits, rather
than starting with people of known habits and following them to
find their risk of early death.
   Nonetheless, the study ``does show a relationship that needs to
be looked into,'' he said.
   Bertolucci, a statistician at the National Institute on Alcohol
Abuse and Alcoholism, presented the results oonday at the annual
meeting of the American Public Health Association.
   The study used data on the drinking habits during adulthood of
8,303 men and 7,158 women, ages 25 or older. The data was obtained
several months after their deaths from next-of-kin or other
knowledgeable informants.
   Those who had drunk fewer than 12 drinks a year were classified
as abstainers. Light drinkers were those who had averaged up to
three drinks a week, moderate drinkers were those taking four to 13
drinks a week, and heavier drinkers were those who took two or more
drinks a day.
   Among men, 33 percent of moderate drinkers and 32 percent of
light drinkers died before age 65. For women, the figures were 29
percent and 26 percent respectively.
   As expected, cirrhosis of the liver was a more frequent cause of
death in men for heavier drinkers than lighter drinkers or
abstainers. Cancers of the trachea, bronchus, lung and esophagus
increased with greater drinking levels for men and women.
   Similar increases were seen for suicide among women. But deaths
from traffic accidents were not related to drinking levels in
either sex. Bertolucci stressed that the study focused on long-term
drinking behavior, while traffic deaths might be more related to
how much a person was drinking just before the accident.
   Bertolucci said 25.2 percent of the men and 7.6 percent of the
women in the study were classified as heavier drinkers, 17.1
percent of the men and 8.3 percent of the women were ranked as
moderate drinkers, 27.2 percent of the men and 23.1 percent of the
women were light drinkers, and 30.6 percent of the men and 61
percent of the women were called abstainers.
   The percentages of heavier drinking were higher than those found
in a 1987 national survey that put 14 percent of men and 3.1
percent of women in that category, he said.
   Ian Rockett, an associate professor of public health at the
University of Tennessee in Knoxville, called the study ``valuable
in an exploratory sense.'' He cautioned that the drinking levels
reported by the next-of-kin may have been underestimates.

   The mayor said today he wants to hire more than
7,900 more police officers over the next 19 months as part of the
effort to curb the city's escalating crime.
   The officers would be part of a four-year, $1.9 billion
anti-crime program which would include 2,950 new jail beds at the
Rikers Island prison, improvement of security at 150 schools and
more officers on subway trains.
   Mayor David Dinkins' plan was released after Police Commissioner
Lee Brown issued a report saying that by hiring more patrolmen,
redeploying other officers and hiring more civilians, there would
be an overall increase in the number of officers on patrol daily
from 6,640 to 10,227, a hike of 54 percent.
   The number of police on street beats would triple. Dinkins said
the beefed-up force would reduce the average response time to
crimes by more than 50 percent to 90 seconds.
   A rash of high-profile crimes riveted the city's attention this
summer. Among the more noteworthy were a number of children hit by
stray bullets, the Zodiac gunman who apparently picked his victims
by birthdates, repeated killings of cab drivers, the killing of a
prosecutor near the Bonx courthouse and the fatal stabbing of a
tourist who was defending his mother during a subway mugging.
   The mayor's program would be financed in part by a property tax
increase that would cost the average single family homeowner $20
more per year, and a payroll tax that would cost a worker making
$50,000 about $1 per week the first year, $1.50 a week later.
   The new officers won't be on the streets for some time. The
Police Academy can handle 2,600 students at a time by splitting
classes into two shifts. Each class lasts six months.
   Dinkins' program also calls for $420 million over four years for
the Board of Education to provide services to students at risk of
dropping out, in the hope of preventing crimes.
   The mayor said he also wants the state to add five new prisons
to house additional criminals expected to be arrested by the extra
police officers.

   President Bush and Saddam Hussein have toned
down their rhetoric, but private Mideast specialists said Tuesday
there's no evidence either man is prepared to make significant
concessions in the Persian Gulf.
   ``I am marginally encouraged by what Saddam and the president
have to say, but I don't think it would change my bets very much,''
said Geoffrey Kemp of the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace, a research group.
   ``The rhetoric had dropped slightly, but we may be moving closer
to war because there is no evidence that anyone is prepared to
give,'' he said.
   Saddam has given no indication he'll pull his forces out of
Kuwait. In fact, U.S. military sources say he has deployed about
430,000 troops to southern Iraq and Kuwait to defend the occupied
territory.
   And Bush is a long way from cutting a deal with the Iraqi leader
he's repeatedly condemned, several experts said.
   Even though tensions remain high - the aircraft carrier USS
Independence and its battle group entered the Persian Gulf Tuesday
- analysts said recent statements by Saddam and Bush underscore the
caution with which they are proceeding to avoid what would surely
be a bloody conflict.
   They also appear to be keeping the doors open for some
face-saving diplomacy, although Bush has insisted there's no
flexibility in his policy.
   Saddam may be feeling the pressure of the U.N. economic
sanctions.
   Bush, in a Monday address to the U.N. General Assembly,
reiterated that Iraq's Aug. 2 occupation of Kuwait ``will not be
allowed to stand.'' But he said if Saddam withdraws from Kuwait,
that could help speed resolution of the Iraq-Kuwait conflict and
the dispute over Israel's seizure of Arab lands during the 1967
war.
   ``Bush was less confrontational, but the substance was the
same,'' said Richard Murphy, a former assistant secretary of State
for the Middle East. The United States, he said, has long pushed
for a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Bush may have appeared to soften his tone to play to his
international audience, as well as to underline the U.S. commitment
to follow the U.N. lead in isolating Iraq, Murphy said.
   He may also be sensitive to recent polls that show Americans
support Bush's goals in the gulf so far, but aren't prepared for
war. Some Republicans have expressed jitters over the effect of the
gulf policy on the Nov. 6 elections, analysts said.
   ``If we get involved in some interminable landlocked police
action, there are going to be some second thoughts,'' said Lance
Tarrance, a Republican political pollster.
   One survey, conducted for American Talk Security, a bipartisan
group of polling and consulting companies, said nine out of 10
Americans don't want the United States involved in war.
   Murphy said Saddam ``appears to be nibbling'' at a proposal
French President Francois Mitterrand offered at the U.N. last week.
   Mitterrand said if Saddam withdraws from Kuwait and meets other
U.N. demands, the Palestinian and Lebanon questions can be
discussed. Saddam has praised Mitterrand for offering positive
ideas to resolve the crisis and has said he'll be in contact with
the French.
   Since his annexation of Kuwait, Saddam has repeatedly called for
a broad-based resolution of Arab problems. He wants a peace
conference to deal with Israel's 23-year annexation of Palestinian
lands, including the West Bank and the Golan Heights, and Syria's
14-year occupation of Lebanon.
   Allen Gerson, a former U.N. official who is now a resident
scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said no one knows
what Saddam is thinking, but that the Iraqi president must realize
the foolishness of provoking the United States and its U.N. allies.
   The United States has about 170,000 troops based in Saudi
Arabia.
   ``If he were rational, he would go for a deal,'' Gerson said.
``Otherwise he will get wrecked. The overwhelming odds are that if
he doesn't, then he is going to get destroyed.''
   Hans Binnendijk, deputy director of London's prestigious
International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, said in a
recent article that Saddam might withdraw from most of Kuwait
except for the southern part of the Rumaila oil fields and the gulf
islands of Bubiyan and Warbah.
   Saddam might try to declare Kuwait a homeland for Palestinians
in a bid to garner support from other Arab leaders who don't
uniformly look with sympathy on the Kuwait's wealthy ruling clan,
the al-Sabahs.
   Alexander George, a Stanford University professor now at the
U.S. Institute of Peace, offered a scenario in which the al-Sabahs
or their representatives return Kuwait City, but the Iraqis would
then hold onto the oil fields and offshore islands as a bargaining
chip.
   ``I am not advocating appeasement, but these are important
carrots,'' he said.
   But Kemp said he doubts the United States would yield on the
demand that the al-Sabahs, who have been driven into exile in Saudi
Arabia, return to the emirate.

   Disabled activists ended their occupation of an
administration building at Morehouse College today, leaving the
building with a statement from the college saying it sympathized
with the group's concerns.
   The protest by members of ADAPT, or Americans Disabled for
Attendant Programs Today, had shut down some vital offices in the
administration building, but classes continued as scheduled.
   About 200 activists seized the building Monday and barricaded
themselves in the office of President Leroy Keith.
   They vowed at first to remain until Health and Human Services
Secretary Louis Sullivan agreed to meet with them. But they
modified their demands today, asking instead that Keith write a
letter to Sullivan, the former president of the Morehouse School of
Medicine, supporting their cause.
   Keith said he would not write or sign such a letter.
   ``We have no business intervening in this situation where we
have no authority,'' he said.
   Later, about 50 remaining members of ADAPT left the building
carrying a statement written on Keith's stationery. But the
statement was not signed and college officials refused to comment
on whether they had anything to do with it or come out of the
building.
   Even though they failed in their demand to get Keith to write
Sullivan, the demonstrators termed the protest a victory. College
students applauded the protesters as they left the building.
   Earlier today, Campbell Gardett, a spokesman for Sullivan in
Washington, said the Department of Health and Human Services had
offered to have its regional director in Atlanta meet with the
protesters ``as Dr. Sullivan's representative.''
   The demonstrators said they felt the late Martin Luther King
Jr., a Morehouse alumnus, would have approved of their protest.
   ``This is a college that has always valued human rights,'' said
Michael Auberger, a founder of ADAPT. ``This is another minority
that is trying to gain its human rights.''
   On Monday, the group expressed dissatisfaction that Sullivan did
not respond to their invitation to meet with them although he
agreed to speak at an AIDS symposium at Morehouse last week.
Auberger said the problems of the disabled are ``as serious as
AIDS. He chose to ignore the issue.''
   Georgia is one of 13 states that offers no state-funded care for
disabled people outside of nursing homes. It is one of eight states
that provides no matching supplements for federal disability
benefits, said Mark Johnson of Alpharetta, a spokesman of the
Georgia branch of ADAPT.

of a tight 1988 race.
   McCrery acknowledges that Saturday's open primary ``could be
close'' and has stepped up campaign advertising in the final days
of the race. But he makes no apologies for his views on abortion
and accuses Campbell of twisting the facts on the pay raise.
   Since McCrery and Campbell are the only two candidates on the
ballot, the weekend voting will decide the winner of the
congressional seat.
   ``I'm gonna beat this guy,'' says Campbell, a 43-year-old state
senator, cattleman and insurance agent. ``His positions are
indefensible on abortion. The voters view it as extremist. And,
people who work for a living can't handle a vote for a $30,000 pay
raise and a vote against a $1.20-an-hour minimum wage increase.''
   McCrery, 41, is completing his first full term. He defeated
Campbell by just 1,300 votes in an April 1988 special election to
complete the term of Buddy Roemer, who became governor.
   Campbell, who was severely injured in an auto accident in the
final month of the special election race, didn't run in the fall
election for the full term. In that race, McCrery handily beat
Adeline Roemer, the governor's mother.
   But now Campbell, 43, has fully recovered and is back on the
attack.
   Campbell himself supported a bill prohibiting abortion except in
cases of rape and incest and to save the life of the mother. But he
says McCrery goes too far in his opposition to abortion.
   In a recent debate, he called McCrery's vote for a measure
prohibiting use of federal funds for abortions ``cold and
callous.''
   Campbell's less restrictive views on abortion have brought him
support from a large group of Shreveport women in business and
professions.
   ``It was just time for us to take a stand on an issue that is
going to be involved in next year's state elections,'' said Judy
Williams, a public relations and advertising executive. ``A large
number of women would have otherwise voted for Jim McCrery.''
   McCrery responds that abortion is largely a state issue and
defends his vote in Congress against federally financed abortions.
   ``I have voted against spending your tax dollars to perform
abortions and will continue to vote against it,'' he said in a
recent debate.
   ``Go a step further, Jim,'' Campbell countered. ``If a poor
woman was raped, you are saying she should not be able to have an
abortion if she can't afford one even if she's a victim of rape. I
have two daughters. I don't want the government coming into my
living room making decisions about them.''
   McCrery says Campbell isn't telling the whole story about the
congressman's vote in support of a congressional pay raise.
   ``He doesn't tell you I voted to take away $30,000 of other
income from special interests, that I voted to restrict almost all
other forms of outside earned income,'' McCrery said. ``It was an
important bill to preserve the integrity of the country.
   ``He says I voted against minimum wage but he doesn't tell you I
voted for a 90-cent increase and that is now the law, not the
higher wage he wanted. Throughout this campaign, Foster has milled
you.''
   Campbell responded: `You voted for the $30,000 pay raise, Jim.
Why not just vote for a stronger code of ethics?'' Campbell pledged
that if he is elected, ``I'll give the $30,000 pay raise to charity
each year and document it.''

   Encouraged by confidence-building measures
announced by the Finance Ministry, share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange rebounded today in a record single-day surge.
   The closely watched Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues
climbed 2,676.55 points, or 13.24 percent, to 22,898.41. The index
had lost 3,555.97 points in the previous five sessions to close at
20,221.86 on Monday, its lowest level in 3{ years.
   The previous record advance was posted a day after the Black
Monday global stock market crash, when the Nikkei rose 2,037.32
points, or 9.3 percent, to 23,947.40 on Oct. 21, 1987.
   Following the Nikkei's fall below the 20,000-point level at one
point Monday, Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto announced his
ministry would take steps to raise margin trading limits and cut
futures and options trading hours in an attempt to support the
market.
   ``The support from the Finance Ministry boosted the market's
sentiment. I believe institutional investors as well as individual
buyers now can't resist investing at the current low levels,'' said
Toshiyuki Nishiguchi, a trader with Daiwa Securities.
   The market today roared with ``panic buying,'' said Amy Yip,
manager of equity sales at Baring Securities Ltd. ``Customers were
worried about missing the boat. They're afraid the market's going
to pull back tomorrow ... and yet their hands and mouth can't
function together. They're moving entirely differently from
logic,'' she said.
   While market participants predicted Monday that the Nikkei would
continue downward to 15,000 points, views are now calling for a
pulling back to 23,000 points, or even to 25,000 points, Yip said.
   ``This just shows how very fragile investor sentiment is,'' she
said.
   The Foreign Ministry's measures themselves weren't what prompted
buying today, traders said. They said the bullish mood resulted
more from the psychological impact of the ministry's stance on
``supporting'' the market.
   Volume on the market's first section was estimated at 550
million shares, up from 428 million shares Monday.
   Hashimoto's show of support came after the Nikkei index had shed
10,616.13 points, or 34.4 percent, from its closing of 30,837.99 on
Aug. 1, the day before Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   Japan is highly vulnerable to unrest in the Persian Gulf because
it imports 99 percent of its oil, with 70 percent coming from the
Middle East.
   ``In addition to the psychological effect of Hashimoto's
measure, the market, weary of selling, was prepared for an
upturn,'' said Yoshiro Inoue, a dealer with Nomura Securities.
   Diplomatic efforts by countries to settle the gulf crisis,
slipping oil prices, a surge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on
Wall Street overnight and a stronger bond market in Japan were
among the positive factors, he said.
   ``We believe today's rebound is an indication of sustained
recovery as long as the Middle East remains calm,'' Inoue said.
   The dollar, meanwhile, declined against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar began the day at 136.55 yen, down 0.60 yen from
Monday's close. After ranging between 136.53 yen and 137.10 yen, it
closed at 136.73 yen, down 0.42 yen.
   The yen's strength reflected overnight gains in New York and
other overseas markets amid growing expectations of an easing of
U.S. credit, said Minori Takeuchi of Chemical Bank.
   In bond dealings, the yield of benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds closed at 8.185 percent, down sharply
from 8.475 percent the previous day. Their price rose to 82.81
points from 81.68.
   North Sea Brent crude oil for November delivery fell to about
$35.50-35.65 a barrel, well under the $37.40 level late Monday in
New York.

<HEAD>Home Sales Decline For Sixth Time In Eight Months</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of new homes fell 1.4 percent in August,
the government reported Tuesday. Analysts said sales would have
fallen further but for buyers who signed contracts before the
effects of the Persian Gulf crisis were felt.
   Richard Peach, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers
Association, said buyers often rush to ``lock in'' on lower-cost
mortgages when they fear rates will rise following an event such as
the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   But David F. Seiders, economist for the National Association of
Home Builders, suggested that September sales will be adversely
affected by those made in August and by the rising rates that
accompanied the oil-price shock.
   TheCommerce Department said new home sales totaled a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 550,000 after edging down a revised 0.2
percent in July. However, the July fall was much softer than the
2.3 percent first reported last month.
   The August decline was the sixth in eight months and more
evidence of weakness in the housing industry. Sales during the
first eight months of the year have plunged 13.6 percent below the
same period of 1989.
   Many analysts expect sales to remain weak because of high
mortgage rates, consumer caution over adverse economic news and the
Persian Gulf crisis and overbuilding in some areas.
   Seiders said the Home Builders now are forecasting 500,000 sales
this year, compared to 650,000 in 1989. But he said that forecast
is contingent upon the Federal Reserve permitting interest rates to
fall.
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said fixed-rate mortgage
rates, which fell to 9.84 percent during the first week in August,
began spiraling after the Iraqi invasion and ended the month at
10.24 percent. They remained at 10.22 percent at the end of
September.
   The weak sales have contributed to sluggishness in the
construction industry. The Commerce Department reported on Monday
that overall spending was unchanged in August while residential
spending fell 1.2 percent from July.
   Sales of less-expensive existing homes, on the other hand, have
been moving up for three months, including a 2.1 percent advance in
August, according to surveys by the National Association of
Realtors.
   The Commerce Department said the median price of a new home
edged up 0.2 percent to $120,200 in August while the Realtors said
the median price of an existing home was $97,000. The median means
half of the homes cost more, half less.
   Inventories of new homes in August were unchanged from July's
7.7-month backlog, the department said.
   The West posted the only increase in sales, up 0.7 percent to
139,000 units after falling 3.5 percent a month earlier. Sales were
unchanged in the Northeast at 77,000 units following a 7.2 percent
decline in July.
   Sales fell elsewhere. They were down 3.2 percent to 91,000 units
in the Midwest after a 2.1 percent drop the previous month, and off
2.0 percent to 244,000 units in the South which had registered a
5.1 percent gain in July.

<HEAD>White Supremacist Leader Faces $10 Million Lawsuit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD GREEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer who bankrupted a Ku Klux Klan
faction with a $7 million civil judgment is going after another
white supremacist group with a lawsuit on behalf of the family of
an Ethiopian who was beaten to death.
   The $10 million wrongful death suit goes to trial Oct. 8 in
another test of the idea of attacking racist groups through their
wallets.
   Three skinheads confessed to bludgeoning Mulugeta Seraw to death
with baseball bats.
   The lawsuit contends Tom Metzger, the founder of White Aryan
Resistance, incited the killing by sending agents to a Portland
skinhead group with a message of hate for blacks and Jews. Metzger
denies the charge.
   The lawsuit will be argued by Morris Dees, a lawyer for the
Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center. He won a $7 million
civil judgment three years ago against the United Klans of America
after two Klansmen from Mobile, Ala., killed a 19-year-old black
man.
   Metzger, a former KKK grand dragon from Fallbrook, Calif., and
White Aryan Resistance are named as defendants, along with
Metzger's son, John, and two of the men who confessed to killing
Seraw.
   The case has drawn threats from a white supremacist group
suspected in the Sept. 15 bombing of the federal courthouse in San
Diego. The FBI is investigating the previously unknown group, the
Holy Church of the White Fighting Machine of the Cross.
   No one was injured in the explosion. But a letter the group sent
to KNSD-TV of San Diego said it could not guarantee there would not
be injuries in the future. And it warned ``all concerned to drop
the lawsuit in Portland, Ore.''
   Metzger said he had never heard of the group, but added that
other supporters would be in Portland for a fund-raising event
during the trial.
   Civil rights groups also plan rallies and a march during the
trial.
   ``Metzger symbolizes the rise of white hate groups in this
country over the last 10 years,'' said Ron Herndon, a black
activist in Portland. ``The trial and what happens to him will send
a strong message one way or the other to the country.''
   The lawsuit claims that, hours before Seraw was slain, two of
Metzger's agents spoke to the attackers and other members of a
neo-Nazi gang, East Side White Pride.
   ``Dave Mazzella and I told these skinheads that blacks and Jews
were the enemy of the white Aryan race,'' Michael Barrett said in
an affidavit for the lawsuit.
   ``We told them to use violence if they got the opportunity and
to be sure and beat the hell out of the enemy. We were telling them
what Tom and John Metzger told us to say to skinheads we were
organizing.''
   Barrett said he had since quit the white supremacist movement.
   In a telephone interview from California, Metzger denied he sent
Barrett and Mazzella to Portland.
   Seraw, 27, was attacked Nov. 18, 1988, by Kenneth Mieske, Kyle
Brewster and Steven Strasser, members of East Side White Pride.
   The three men and their girlfriends drove up as Seraw was being
dropped off by friends.
   ``They deliberately went up there for the purpose of starting a
fight,'' police Detective Tom Nelson said. ``Seraw was defending
himself against Brewster when Mieske came up and blindsided Seraw
with a baseball bat.''
   The blow to the head knocked Seraw to the pavement. Mieske
smashed Seraw's head twice more, splitting the bat lengthwise,
police said.
   Mieske admitted he killed Seraw because he was black. He pleaded
guilty to murder and racial intimidation, Brewster pleaded guilty
to manslaughter and racial intimidation, and Strasser pleaded
guilty to manslaughter.
   Mieske was sentenced to life with a 20-year minimum, Brewster to
10 to 20 years and Strasser to 20 years.
   Despite the confessions, Metzger contends the killing was in
self-defense. ``We've been saying from the beginning that it was
mutual combat provoked by the Ethiopians,'' he said.

   A cruise ship with 1,463 people on
board caught fire in the Atlantic Ocean off Panama, but the blaze
was quickly brought under control and no injuries were reported,
sources said today.
   The fire broke out aboard the Crystal Harmony on Monday night,
said the sources at Norton Lily of Panama City, the local agents
for the ship.
   The vessel carried 938 passengers and a crew of 525, said the
sources, who spoke with The Associated Press on condition of
anonymity.
   ``They're all well,'' one source said of the passengers and
crew.
   The source said the ship was heading for Cristobal, a port at
the north entrance of the Panama Canal, and had been expected to
arrive there Thursday.
   The sources refused to give further details.
   It was not known whether the fire had disabled the ship or
whether a rescue operation was under way. The ship's route, owner,
and the nationality of its passengers and crew also were not
immediately known.
   The sources said they demanded anonymity because the
unidentified company that owns the Crystal Harmony had forbidden
them to talk to reporters.

<HEAD>American Companies Plan To Increase Overseas Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American companies surveyed before the Persian
Gulf crisis said they planned to boost their overseas spending by 1
percent in 1991, the government said Tuesday.
   The Commerce Department said a survey conducted in June showed
that majority-owned foreign affiliates of U.S. companies planned
$56.6 billion in capital spending next year, up from $56 billion in
planned expenditures in 1990.
   But the department said ``the 1991 plans should be viewed with
particular caution because the most recent survey was conducted ...
before the (Aug. 2) Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   ``Developments in the Middle East following the invasion may
influence worldwide economic conditions, investment opportunities
and oil prices, which may significantly change firms' capital
spending plans,'' it said.
   The 17 percent increase in 1990 spending plans was up from a 13
percent planned increase reported in a survey last December. Actual
capital expenditures in 1989 totaled $47.9 billion.
   ``The level of capital expenditures indicates that U.S. parent
companies plan to maintain their recent emphasis on overseas
operations,'' the report said.
   The largest increases were planned in Germany, up 18 percent to
$6.3 billion, and Japan, up 15 percent to $2.6 billion.
   Even before the energy disruption of the Persian Gulf crisis,
the report said petroleum affiliates planned to increase spending
by 2 percent, to $15.9 billion, in 1991. The increases include oil
tanker construction and oil and gas extraction in Canada, Norway,
Nigeria and Southeast Asia.
   ``Petroleum firms - attracted by host government incentives and
potentially larger exploitable oil and gas reserves than those in
the United States - have been increasing their overseas spending,
relative to their domestic spending, for exploration and
development,'' it added.
   At the same time, it said completed projects will result in
spending declines in Australia, Britain and the Caribbean.
   Manufacturing affiliates plan to increase spending by 1 percent,
to $28.2 billion. Increases are planned in non-electrical
machinery, transportation equipment and chemicals.
   ``Manufacturers have been attracted by several favorable
conditions abroad: increasing economic integration in the European
communities, movement toward market-oriented economic systems in
Eastern Europe, an improved investment climate in Latin America and
rapid economic growth in East Asia,'' it continued.
   Large investments in the European communities account for the
bulk of the planned increase in spending on non-electrical
machinery, mainly computers, and transportation equipment.
   ``Computer manufacturing affiliates in the European communities
plan to build facilities to produce a new generation of high-speed
semiconductors and to meet rising demand for personal computers,''
the department said.
   ``Automotive manufacturing affiliates in the European
communities are planning extensive projects to reduce production
costs and introduce product improvements in response to rising
competition from Japanese-owned firms and growing consumer
demand,'' it added.
   ``In chemicals, sizable investments are planned in Japan, where
an affiliate is building a product development center,'' it said.
   Spending declines, related to project completions, are planned
in primary and fabricated metals, ``other manufacturing'' (mainly
rubber and paper products), electrical machinery and food products,
the report said.

<HEAD>Sandinista Commander Nunez Dies After Long Illness</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carlos Nunez Tellez, a government
leader in Nicaragua during the decade when it was ruled by the
leftist Sandinistas, has died in Cuba, a Sandinista radio station
said today. He was 39.
   Nunez died of ``an illness for which he was undergoing treatment
in Cuba,'' said Radio Ya, the main Sandinista radio station.
   It did not say when Nunez died. It has been rumored for some
time that he had leukemia or some other form of cancer.
   Nunez was one of the nine commanders that made up the National
Directorate of the Sandinista National Liberation Front, and was
president of the National Assembly when the Sandinistas controlled
it. He was known for his relatively moderate positions on key
issues.
   The Sandinistas lost control of the Assembly in elections on
Feb. 25, but Nunez was re-elected.
   He was seen only at the opening session after the government of
President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro took office April 25 after
defeating President Daniel Ortega and ending a decade of leftist
Sandinista rule.
   Nunez joined the then-underground Sandinista National Liberation
Front in 1969 with his brother, Rene, and received guerrilla
training abroad.
   He became part of the Sandinista directorate in March, 1979,
four months before the front toppled the dictatorship of the late
Gen. Anastasio Somoza.
   Information about his survivors and funeral plans were not
immediately available.

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA completed final preparations
Tuesday for the countdown of space shuttle Discovery, due to lift
off this week with five astronauts and a plutonium-powered sun
probe.
   The countdown clock was to start ticking at 3:30 a.m. Wednesday.
Liftoff is scheduled for Saturday morning.
   A generator containing 23.7 pounds of plutonium-238 was
installed Tuesday in the satellite, tucked inside Discovery's cargo
bay. The satellite, called Ulysses, will use electricity generated
from the decaying plutonium during its five-year journey in space.
   Technicians also repaired a broken wire in Discovery's engine
compartment that was preventing a liquid oxygen valve from opening.
   Environmental activists opposed to NASA's use of plutonium have
gone to court in an attempt to halt the launch. A hearing is
scheduled for Thursday in Washington, D.C., before U.S. District
Oliver Gasch, who refused to stop Atlantis from lifting off last
year with a plutonium-powered satellite bound for Jupiter.
   The activists fear a Challenger-like accident would scatter the
deadly plutonium over Florida and result in untold cancer
fatalities. They say NASA's inability to fix the shuttle Columbia's
hydrogen leaks calls into question the space agency's competency.
   NASA tried four times in four months to launch Columbia before
stopping two weeks ago to turn its attention to Discovery. Columbia
is expected to remain grounded until late this year or early next
year.
   A newly repaired Atlantis, grounded by hydrogen leaks in June,
is scheduled to carry a secret military satellite into orbit in
early November.
   NASA officials insist the chances of plutonium being released
into the atmosphere are extremely small and would pose little
health risk even if it did. There is no other way to get Ulysses
into an unprecedented orbit over the sun's poles, they said.
   ``We've done everything we can'' to ensure safety, said Willis
Meeks, NASA's project manager for Ulysses. ``We're ready, and I'm
optimistic we're going to launch on the 6th.''
   After being released from Discovery, Ulysses is to speed toward
Jupiter and use the giant planet's gravity to be whipped into the
proper solar orbit. If Discovery does not lift off by Oct. 23, the
$750 million mission will have to wait until late 1991 for the
proper planetary alignment.
   The four-day mission would be NASA's first shuttle flight in
nearly half a year. Discovery was the last spaceship to be
launched; its cargo was the Hubble Space Telescope, which later was
found to have a flawed mirror.
   Meeks, like everyone else at National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, is counting on a successful flight by Discovery to
help get the beleaguered agency back on track.
   ``It will be a boost for morale and a boost for NASA,'' Meeks
said.

   Pillsbury Co. on Tuesday recalled a limited
number of its Great Additions brand Double Chocolate Brownie Mix
because some boxes were inadvertently filled with Great Additions
brand Walnut Brownie Mix.
   The mix could be a problem to people allergic to walnuts, but it
poses no other danger, the company said.
   The mislabeled batch was distributed in Ohio, Kentucky,
Michigan, Pennsylvania and Indiana.
   The recall covers about 6,000 cases filled June 12-23 at a plant
in North Lake, Ill., said Jennifer O'Neill, a spokeswoman for
Minneapolis-based Pillsbury. Only a small number of boxes in those
cases were filled with the wrong mix, she said.
   Thirteen consumers in Kentucky, Indiana and Ohio complained
about the mistake in August and September, O'Neill said.
   Pillsbury is recalling packages with a production code of
``FOK'' followed by any number from 12 to 23. The codes are printed
on the top flap of the mix box.
   The ingredients pouch inside the box is correctly labeled.
   Consumers who want a refund or replacement can return the
product to their grocer or contact Pillsbury.
   Pillsbury has established a toll-free telephone number for
consumers who want more information: 1-800-767-4466. The line is
open Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. CDT.

   A model-airplane buff arrested after his
radio-controlled craft punctured a Goodyear blimp didn't mean to
disable the giant airship, his lawyer said.
   ``He had no desire to shoot the blimp. He knows the blimp flies
there,'' said William J. MacCabe, attorney for John W. Moyer, 28,
of Redondo Beach.
   Moyer was arrested after the Columbia, one of three Goodyear
blimps, was ripped Sunday when a model plane struck it at 1,000
feet above Carson.
   The blimp, which was carrying seven Goodyear corporate customers
on a promotional flight, made a hasty but safe landing at its base
10 miles south of Los Angeles.
   No one was injured, but the blimp's tail section and gondola
were slightly damaged and there was a 3-by-3-foot gash in the
blimp's skin.
   Moyer was booked for investigation of assault with intent to do
bodily harm, and was being held in lieu of $5,000 bail, authorities
said.
   Image-conscious hobbyists in the area were outraged by the
incident. ``This is a real black eye,'' complained Larry Wolfe,
owner of the Jet Hangar hobby shop in Carson.
   The Columbia was scheduled to fly with a temporary patch to the
Marine Corps Air Station at El Toro on Thursday for repairs
expected to take nearly a week, Goodyear spokesman Bob Urhausen
said.
   Urhausen said Monday the blimp may not be repaired in time to
serve as a television camera platform for the American League
baseball playoffs next week. But it will be on hand when the World
Series opens Oct. 16, he said.
   Goodyear's other blimps are based in Pompano Beach, Fla., and
Houston.

   Eighty-seven-year-old Charlotte Brooder likes
having an occasional glass of wine with dinner and wouldn't mind
having to pay slightly more for it.
   But when it comes to Medicare, she has a message for President
Bush and Congress: Don't mess with the rates.
   Trying to rein in the mushrooming budget deficit, Bush and
congressional leaders have tentatively agreed to increase the
Medicare premium for 34 million Americans, many of whom like
Brooder rely on fixed incomes.
   Taxes on gasoline, cigarettes, alcohol and other luxury items
also would rise.
   But it is the provision raising the Medicare premium that most
bothers Brooder, a retired schoolteacher and librarian who moved to
San Diego from Sheridan, Wyo., in 1973.
   Brooder and other low-income elderly living in the Green Manor
high-rise complex said in interviews Monday that the burden of
balancing the federal budget always seems to fall heavily on the
poor and the elderly. Often they are one in the same.
   ``I just don't like it,'' said Brooder, who pays $240 a month
for the one-bedroom apartment. ``I know they are trying to balance
the budget, but I just don't like the way they are trying to
balance it. I could probably get along fine, but there are many who
could not.
   ``I like to go out to dinner and have a glass of wine every once
in a while and I wouldn't mind paying the tax on it, but that's my
business and I'm probably going to have to keep my entertainment
down,'' said Brooder, a widow since 1961.
   According to the budget plan, Medicare beneficiaries would pay
more for the coverage that helps pay doctor bills. An annual $75
deductible would rise to $100 in 1991 and to $150 by 1993.
   Medicare insurance premiums would rise from $28.60 per month to
$33.50 next year and to $54.30 by 1995, the American Association of
Retired Persons estimates.
   The budget plan aims to save $60 billion in Medicare outlays in
the next five years. Half would be in reduced payments to doctors
and hospitals, the rest by taxing beneficiaries.
   As in other places with a large elderly population, talk around
Green Manor is all about the budget and its impact on Medicare.
   From the crowd chatting on the lobby couch, to the laundry room,
to the lounge, the topic was the proposed changes in benefits.
   Many said the effects would be severe.
   ``It's going to hit people hard,'' said Irene Hawkinson, 69, who
has lived in Green Manor the past four years with her husband,
Eugene, a retired meteorologist. ``I just hope they keep the Social
Security Cost of Living Adjustments. We don't need the jewelry or
the liquor or the cigarettes.''
   Green Manor has 180 residents. To live there, they must be able
to fend for teemselves and have an annual income of no more than
$20,500 if single or $23,000 if a couple.
   The 13-story high-rise is owned and subsidized by a nearby
congregational church. Rent is scaled to income. There is a
three-year waiting list.
   Bob Woodbridge, 64, a retired drapery maker who moved from El
Paso, Texas, in February, said he supplements his $602 monthly
Social Security check by washing cars and driving other residents
to grocery stores, the doctor and the hospital.
   ``Some people can't afford to go out, but those who can, why
can't it just be a 10 percent increase for them?
   ``If they are used to spending $20 on entertainment, $22
wouldn't hurt them. So, for people who can afford it, travel a lot
and entertain, let them pay the taxes,'' he said.

<HEAD>Executive Testifies About Proposal To Hire Tribal Chairman's Son</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 6 grafs to UPDATE with today's testimony.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former coal company executive
testified today that suspended Navajo Chairman Peter MacDonald and
his son sought a $4,500-a-month consulting contract for the son
while the company was negotiating a coal lease.
   The testimony by Kenneth R. Moore, former vice president of St.
Louis-based Peabody's western division, came one day after
attorneys made opening statements in tribal court in the bribery
and kickback trial of MacDonald and son Peter ``Rocky'' MacDonald
Jr.
   Moore, who retired from Peabody in 1988, said the contract,
which Peabody ultimately rejected, was suggested on at least three
occasions in late 1987. It was also mentioned in a letter that gave
the amount of the payment at $4,500 a month, he said.
   Moore said he talked to a Peabody attorney about the proposal
who ``basically said, `It smells.' ... We decided not to do it.''
   During questioning by the defense attorney Val Jolley, Moore
said he was not threatened by the elder MacDonald in relation to
Peabody leases to mine coal on Navajo land, nor did MacDonald
express any bitterness or hostility when the proposal was rejected.
Moore quoted MacDonald as responding: ``Fine, I understand.''
   On Monday, Jolley had argued that the prosecution of the
Navajos' suspended chairman is flawed because officials do not
understand the traditional Indian practice of a chief accepting
gifts. Jolley said the prosecution was trying to apply non-Indian
notions of political decorum to MacDonald's behavior.
   ``They've made a bunch of mud balls, hoping that some of them
would stick,'' Jolley said in his opening statement.
   Jolley said tribal ethics permit gifts based on a social
relationship, as well as campaign contributions. He did not deny
that MacDonald had received loans and gifts from contractors doing
business with the tribe, but he did deny such acceptance violated
any tribal laws.
   ``ot a single vendor that gave money to Peter MacDonald Sr.
ever received any agreement or understanding that Peter MacDonald
Sr. would do anything on behalf of that contractor,'' said Jolley.
   MacDonald, 61, said his political enemies had delayed the start
of the trial in an attempt to worsen his chances at winning
election to the new position of tribal president next month.
   MacDonald had previously accused the interim tribal government
of using the trial to remove him from the Nov. 6 ballot and give
the job of president to his opponent, former chairman Peterson Zah.
   In his opening statement, prosecutor Mark Donatelli said
MacDonald had violated a public trust.
   ``Mr. MacDonald retreated into his outside world of cash,
condominiums, and corrupt compromise. He alienated the business
community through a pattern of corrupt government,'' said
Donatelli, whose Santa Fe, N.M., law firm was hired to investigate
and prosecute corruption in tribal government.
   Clint Hartwell, manager of the Citibank Arizona branch here, was
the first prosecution witness. Hartwell verified microfilm copies
of deposits into the bank account of Denay Inc., owned by
MacDonald.
   Hartwell testified that checks were written to Mrs. MacDonald
from the Denay account totaling nearly $104,000 since 1986.
MacDonald also received $20,000 from the account, but there are no
bank records showing that Denay paid anything to the Internal
Revenue Service or the Arizona Department of Revenue, Hartwell
said.
   If convicted in tribal District Court on all 45 counts of
bribery, conspiracy and ethics violations, MacDonald could be
jailed for 23 years, fined up to $22,500 and barred from serving in
tribal office for four years.
   Monday's was the seventh trial date set for MacDonald and his
son, Peter ``Rocky'' MacDonald Jr. Legal maneuvering and other
roadblocks had forced Judge Robert Yazzie to abandon the previous
dates.
   The younger MacDonald, an unemployed lawyer who lives in San
Jose, Calif., faces 11 counts of bribery and one of conspiracy.

<HEAD>Groups Say Negative Ads Should Identify Their Source</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs top two grafs to CORRECT that petition does not seek to
outlaw ads, only to tighten regulations on identification of
sponsors.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two activist groups asked the government
Tuesday to tighten regulations to make sure negative political ads
clearly identify the candidate making the attack.
   People for the American Way and the Media Access Project said
many attack ads fail to adequately identify their sponsors in a
concerted attempt to confuse and deceive voters.
   ``The American public by and large does not like negative
television commercials,'' said Art Kropp, president of People for
the American Way. ``On the other hand, they are effective ... if
there is no connection made to the candidate who is paying for
them.''
   Candidates' pictures should appear for at least four seconds and
cover at least 20 percent of the TV screen, the two groups said in
a petition to the Federal Communications Commission.
   They also said text identifying the sponsor should appear for at
least four seconds and measure at least 4 percent of the vertical
height of the TV screen.
   Currently, special discounted advertising rates are available to
candidates whose commercials contain identifications that are
readily legible and on screen long enough to be read by the average
viewer.
   But the two groups that filed the FCC complaint showed a tape of
political commercials they say show that broadcasters are not
meeting those standards.
   The ads, including some from hot governors' races in California
and Texas, feature tiny pictures and text identifying the source of
the ads. Sometimes the sponsorship information appears for only a
second or two; often it appears against a backdrop of newspaper
clips or alongside distractions such as a moving dog or moving
text.
   Andrew Jay Schwartzman, an attorney with the Media Access
Project, said the current vague standards make broadcasters
reluctant to reject ads. ``As soon as one broadcaster in a
community accepts a given ad ... the pressure becomes
insurmountable,'' he said.
   Both groups stressed that they are not promoting censorship or
regulation of ad content. ``Negative ads will be a part of
campaigns forever. What we're aiming for is basically truth in
advertising,'' Kropp said.
   He and Schwartzman said the abuse is bipartisan and occurs at
all levels, with some of the worst cases occurring in local or
primary races involving inexperienced and unknown candidates.
   They said the problems arise mainly in negative spots because
they work best with voters when the sponsoring candidate is not
associated with the attack.
   In positive commercials, on the other hand, ``the candidates
happily appear standing in their Air Force uniform, bouncing
children on their knee or holding the hand of a senior citizen,''
Schwartzman said.
   The two said they do not expect the FCC to decide on their
petition before next month's election, but they want the agency to
issue an interim notice reminding broadcasters of their
responsibilities under current rules.
   Milton Gross, chief of the FCC's political branch, said the last
such notice was issued in September 1977. He said the agency
advises individual broadcasters of their obligations when specific
complaints arise, but has never received a broad complaint like the
one filed Tuesday.
   People for the American Way describes itself as a non-partisan
constitutional liberties group with 290,000 members. The Media
Access Project is a public interest telecommunications law firm.

   Actress Mimi Rogers says she's been so busy
lately she doesn't know if her divorce from Tom Cruise has been
finalized.
   ``As far as I know, we're divorced, but I've been so busy on
this new film that I haven't had time to check, so I'm not sure,''
she said recently. ``I bet that sounds pretty silly, huh?''
   The actress put her personal life on hold while she worked in
the desert from early morning to late at night on her new film
``The Rapture,'' in which she plays a woman facing the end of the
world.
   She also appears in Oliver Stone's ``The Doors'' and stars
opposite Mickey Rourke in the thriller ``Desperate Hours,'' which
opens this weekend.
   The Michael Cimino film is a remake of the 1955 Humphrey Bogart
movie ``The Desperate Hours,'' which is about an escaped felon who
takes a family hostage in their suburban home. Miss Rogers plays
the woman whose house is invaded.

   LANSING, Mich. (AP) - June Lockhart says life's a ``hoot and a
giggle,'' and she's too busy to settle down like Timmy's mother,
the character she played on the 1950s television series ``Lassie.''
   The twice-divorced grandmother of two recounted adventures from
flying gliders to paddling down the Amazon while speaking to a Town
Hall audience Monday.
   ``I'm not married, and this question sort of goes with how come
I look so good,'' said Lockhart, 65. ``There is nothing like a
rich, full romantic life to keep you looking great.''
   While she has played mothers on television's ``Lost in Space''
series and ``Lassie,'' she said she's anything but a homebody.
   ``I know so many wonderful men that I date and they are bright,
intelligent and young,'' she said. ``And they are sort of all over
the country, because I travel a lot so I just phone and say, `Hey,
I'm coming in, do you want to play?'
   ``I hit the ground in the morning running. For me, life is a
hoot and a giggle,'' Lockhart said. ``You can't take the stuff
seriously.''

   The Baltimore Orioles are thinking about asking
one of America's comeback kings, Richard Nixon, to throw out their
first pitch next year - the team's last in Memorial Stadium.
   The invitation hasn't been extended yet, but the team may ask
Nixon to do the honors, said Martin B. Conway, the team's vice
president for marketing.
   ``I'm sure it's something he'd look at and consider,'' said
Kathy O'Connor, an aide to the former president. ``He has not done
this kind of thing in a long time.''
   Nixon staged one of the greatest turnarounds in modern political
history when he was elected president in 1968 after vowing six
years earlier to leave politics forever.
   His current status as sometimes-adviser to Republican presidents
has some political experts saying he's made another comeback since
his resignation in disgrace after the Watergate scandal in 1974.
   If the impending invitation from the Orioles to throw the first
pitch raises eyebrows, Conway says it's all part of plans for a
nostalgic commemoration of Memorial's first year.
   It was Vice President Richard Nixon who threw out the first ball
on April 15, 1954, when the team played its first game at the
stadium.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Doris Day is returning to acting, 17 years
after she left television.
   Miss Day, 66, is signing a multipicture deal with ABC
Productions to star in television movies for ABC-TV, the studio
said this week. The contract calls for her to be in three TV films
a year as a recurring character.
   The character is still in the planning stages.
   Production is expected to begin at the end of the year, with
three movies to be televised during the 1991-92 season.
   Miss Day has appeared in more than 40 motion pictures, the last
being the comedy ``With Six You Get Egg Roll'' in 1968. Her last TV
series was the comedy ``The Doris Day Show'' from 1968-73.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Jazz and soul singer Nancy Wilson's name has
been added to Hollywood's Walk of Fame, more than 30 years after
she began her career as a vocalist.
   A party in Wilson's honor was held Monday at the Hollywood
Roosevelt Hotel following the installment ceremony on Hollywood
Boulevard.
   Wilson earned her first hit in 1963 with ``Tell me the Truth.''
Her other hits included, ``I Wanna Be With You,'' ``Peace of
Mind,'' and ``Can't Take My Eyes Off of You.''
   She received an Emmy for her 1975 television special ``The Nancy
Wilson Show.''
   Wilson, 53, lives on a 640-acre ranch outside Palm Springs with
her husband, the Rev. Wiley Burton.

   MALINDI, Kenya (AP) - Eduardo Agnelli, heir to the Fiat auto
fortune, was acquitted Tuesday on a charge of heroin possession.
   Magistrate Martin Muya freed Agnelli and two Kenyans accused
with him, saying the prosecution failed to prove its case. Agnelli
called it a set up.
   The prosecution claimed Agnelli and his co-defendants threw a
sachet of heroin into an adjoining room when police raided a home
in the nearby village of Watamu on Aug. 21.
   But Muya noted that the heroin could not have been tossed over
the wall separating the rooms, as police claimed, because the rooms
had ceilings of woven mats.
   ``I swear upon God I did not have the drug,'' Agnelli said later
outside the courtroom. ``The whole thing was a plant and the
judgment was very fair. God bless this country.''
   Agnelli, 36, is the only son of Giovanni Agnelli, chairman of
the Fiat auto company. The family is one of the world's wealthiest.

<HEAD>Israelis Face A New Reality: Gas Masks In Their Closets</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. LaBELLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Among the warnings broadcast to Israelis on the
radio Tuesday was: Don't let the children play with the gas masks.
   It was one of many reminders to Israelis - long used to air raid
shelters in their basements and sonic booms from air force jets
overhead - that they now must face the possibility of an Iraqi
chemical attack.
   In announcing Monday that masks would be distributed to the
entire population of 4.7 million, the army was at pains to make it
sound like a routine, unhurried operation and not an emergency.
   But the next morning, sirens in Jerusalem and a suburb of Haifa
sent some people in search of shelters while others made worried
phone calls to authorities. They were told the sirens went off by
accident.
   Israelis woke up to a barrage of radio talk shows and newspaper
articles on how to deal with the masks.
   To those who wondered whether Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
threat was serious, the reply from the experts was: Iraq probably
will not attack Israel, but it's best to be ready.
   Most callers to Israel radio focused on what people should do
with the sealed box containing a mask and syringe with a nerve gas
antidote. The answer was: Keep it in the closet, away from the
kids, and don't open it except when ordered.
   How, they asked, can we be sure the masks will work? What about
asthma sufferers, and babies? How does one protect the rest of the
body?
   ``In principle, the gas only causes damage when it is breathed
in through the lungs. It should not hurt the skin,'' said Col.
David Klivansky, answering a question on Israel radio.
   Klivansky added that in the sealed rooms that Israelis have
already been told to prepare for a possible gas attack, ``you need
only the mask.''
   The kits will be distributed at schools and notices mailed to
citizens telling them where to pick them up.
   Yitzhak Samuel, who lives in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat
Hasharon, said his family already had received masks and felt safe.
   ``We have them high up in the closet far from the kids,'' he
said on army radio. ``We received lectures on a video and we are
not afraid.''
   The daily Yediot Ahronot devoted three pages to the gas masks. A
picture showed a young woman demonstrating their use in the manner
of an airline stewardess. Other photos showed protective tents for
infants and special children's masks.
   A cartoon depicted Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
unwrapping a gas mask and advising a menacing-looking Saddam:
``Don't panic.''
   One concern voiced by Israeli officials has been that a decision
to distribute gas masks might be read by Saddam as a warlike move.
Another fear is that it will scare the Israeli public.
   ``We can expect the public to behave in an adult manner now,
although the announcement about distribution, in our view, will
raise the level of anxiety,'' reserve Brig. Gen. Aharon Vardi, a
civil defense official, said on Israel television.
   Indeed, signs of nervousness already are apparent.
   In the past weeks, while officials debated how to prepare for a
chemical attack, people rushed to buy sealing tape for their rooms
and baking soda for homemade gas masks.
   Still, officials are trying to make the gas masks a part of
everyday life, just like the constant appeals to be alert for
suspicious packages that could be bombs.
   As army spokesman Brig. Gen. Nachman Shai put it, the public
should accept the gas masks simply as ``another way of living in
the Holy Land.''

<TEXT>
   Large-scale Navy and Marine Corps amphibious
landing exercises are underway in the northern Arabian Sea
involving 18 ships and 90 aircraft, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
   Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams said the exercise,
involving elements of the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade and
Amphibious Task Group III, will continue through Friday.
   He would not say where the exercises are taking place,
specifically refusing to comment on reports that the landings are
in the sultanate of Oman.
   ``I can't confirm the name of the country involved,'' Williams
said.
   No U.S. reporters have been allowed to observe the exercises and
Williams said that is the wish of the unnamed host government.
   He also declined to say how many U.S. troops are involved in the
exercise, which he said is intended to sharpen the skills necessary
for a successful amphibious landing and to give those involved
experience at ``working in a desert environment.''
   The Pentagon, meanwhile, announced that U.S. troop strength in
the Persian Gulf region now tops 170,000 and is at its highest
level since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   A total of 26,806 U.S. military reserve personnel have been
alerted since the crisis began, Williams said. These include 18,136
Army reservists, 4,062 from the Navy, 3,930 from the Air Force and
678 from the Coast Guard.
   All are in combat support roles.
   No Marine reservists are been alerted.
   Iraqi troop strength in and near Kuwait remains at about
430,000, with 3,500 tanks, 2,500 armored vehicles and 1,700
artillery pieces, Williams said.
   He said Iraqi forces remain in an essentially defensive posture
with infantry forward and armored vehicles toward the rear of the
zone.

<HEAD>Opera Diva Joan Sutherland Makes Last Performance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL ALEXANDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The curtain calls and accolades lasted
nearly 45 minutes Tuesday night after Dame Joan Sutherland,
acclaimed as the greatest coloratura soprano of her day, gave the
final performance of her brillant career.
   Miss Sutherland, the 63-year-old soprano known as La Stupenda,
chose to make her last performance in her hometown, appearing as
Marguerite de Valois in Giacomo Meyerbeer's ``Les Huguenots.''
   Resplendent in a black floor-length gown, Miss Sutherland was
drowned in thunderous applause, cheers and foot-stomping when a
single spotlight illuminated her after the rest of the cast members
took their bows.
   They clapped from the wings before gathering behind her as
brightly colored streamers and flowers cascaded ankle-deep onto the
stage from the audience.
   Miss Sutherland tossed two of the bouquets into the orchestra
pit before rendering a last solo - a haunting, understated version
of ``Home Sweet Home.'' Her husband, Richard Bonynge, who conducted
the performance, then came on stage to give her a kiss.
   Moffatt Oxenbould, the opera company's artistic director, gave
Miss Sutherland a trophy, saying: ``Trophies are for winners, and
you are one of the most gracious winners of all time.''
   Later, a 12-man cadre of bagpipers and drummers greeted Miss
Sutherland at the Regent Hotel. Fans and guests lined the balcony
as her every move was greeted by a barrage of camera flashes. Even
photographers assigned to the event lined up for autographs.
   Tickets for the Opera House performance ranged up to $500 ($415
U.S.). More than 400 patrons in tuxedoes and furs also attended a
post-performance dinner that carried the same price tag.
   But the enthusiastic crowd, which included Prime Minister Bob
Hawke and Treasurer Paul Keating, seemed to feel they got their
money's worth, chatting excitedly about ``a once-in-a-lifetime''
event as they lingered after the performance.
   In a toast to Miss Sutherland, Hawke praised her ``hard work,
disciplined dedication and single-minded application.''
   ``In some ways tonight could be considered a sad occasion,
because we have seen the curtain come down on one of the greatest
careers in the history of opera,'' he said.
   ``But in fact tonight should be an occasion for happiness and
shared pride in the achievements of a truly great Australian.''
   Miss Sutherland was a member of the Royal Opera in London's
Covent Garden in 1952-59. In 1959, her performance in ``Lucia di
Lammermoor'' won widespread acclaim.
   Miss Sutherland, with her extraordinarily strong and pure high
notes and amazing dexterity in trills and runs, quickly became an
international sensation.
   She specialized in the tragic heroines of the bel canto
repertory, from Donizetti's Lucia to Bellini's ``Norma,'' although
her spunky Marie in Donizetti's ``Daughter of the Regiment'' was
among her most-admired portrayals.

   The Senate today endorsed President Bush's
efforts to ``deter Iraqi aggression'' despite some members'
concerns that the move could be seen as giving Bush broad authority
to wage war.
   The resolution of support passed by a 96 to 3 margin. It
followed an overwhelming House vote Monday expressing similar
sentiments.
   ``This resolution is not an authorization for the use of force,
now or in the future,'' Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, told his colleagues before the vote. ``This resolution is
not a blank check.''
   Senators voting on the prevailing side said they believed it was
important to send a signal of unity around the world by giving
legislative support to Bush's moves so far.
   The resolution ``strongly approves the president's leadership''
in winning approval of eight resolutions in the United Nations
Security Council, which imposed a global trade embargo on Iraq and
called for the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait.
   It states: ``The Congress supports continued action by the
president in accordance with the decisions of the United Nations
Security Council and in accordance with United States
constitutional and statutory processes ... to deter Iraqi
aggression and to protect American lives and vital interests in the
region.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., joined Sens. Bob Kerrey,
D-Neb., and Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., in voting against the
resolution. Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., was not present.
   Kennedy called the language of the endorsement ``a blank check
endorsement for future actions'' which abdicates Congress'
war-declaring power.
   The House resolution, adopted on a 380-29 vote Monday, avoids
any mention of future steps in the crisis.
   ``This resolution most assuredly does not represent a blank
check,'' said Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the Foreign
Affairs Middle East subcommittee. ``It does not support future
actions except those actions that continue present policy.''
   Hamilton and committee chairman Dante Fascell, D-Fla., said it
is the responsibility of lawmakers to demonstrate formally how they
feel about Bush's policies in the Middle East.
   ``This is the most significant decision of the Bush
administration with regard to foreign policy, and Congress ought to
speak its mind on it,'' Hamilton said.
   Opponents said the resolution abdicates Congress' responsibility
and gives Bush to many loopholes to wage a war.
   ``I'm very concerned ... this will only provide a congressional
public relations mandate for the president to accentuate a military
resolution of this crisis rather than sustained diplomatic
negotiations with all parties concerned,'' said Rep. Ron Dellums,
D-Calif.
   The House version puts Congress on record in support of
diplomacy, international sanctions and negotiations through the
United Nations to achieve Bush's policy goals: Iraq's withdrawal
from Kuwait, restoration of the legitimate Kuwaiti government,
freedom for hostages and stability for the gulf region.
   ``The United States shall continue to emphasize the use of
diplomatic and other nonmilitary means in order to achieve those
objectives and policies, while maintaining credible United States
and multinational deterrent military force,'' the resolution
stated.
   Like the House measure, the Senate resolution applauds Bush's
use of the United Nations as a forum for international diplomacy in
the crisis.
   But it appears to further limit Bush's future options by linking
them to approval by the United Nations.
   Congress ``supports continued action by the president in
accordance with the decisions of the United Nations Security
Council and in accordance with United States constitutional and
statutory processes ... to deter Iraqi aggression and to protect
American lives and vital interests in the region,'' the Senate
version states.

   East Germany spent a melancholy last day as a
nation Tuesday before passing into history, leaving behind 40 years
of communism and one brief, dizzy fling as a free country.
   Bureaucrats emptied their desks and clasped hands in farewell,
the first freely chosen Parliament held a wistful last meeting, and
the chief government spokesman said he was looking for work.
   The museum devoted to the former nation's history laid off some
workers and began closing departments. West Germany shut its
embassy in a country now part of its own.
   East Germany's once-sacred Communist flag, a red, gold and black
banner emblazoned with a hammer and drafting compass, was spread on
sidewalks and sold as souvenirs.
   Lawyers and bureaucrats, once among the powerful elite, stood in
the last unemployment lines of an autonomous East Germany.
   East Germany would have been 41 years old on Sunday, but instead
acceded to West Germany and transformed itself into just another
five states of the mighty Federal Republic of Germany, or West
Germany.
   Phones rang at government offices Tuesday, but there was nobody
home.
   ``I hope for a new chance in the new Germany. I'm deeply moved
by what has happened here,'' said Franz Jahsnowsky, a top Foreign
Ministry official.
   Jahsnowsky, who spoke in the ministry parking lot, was the
former chief of diplomatic protocol for ousted Communist boss Erich
Honecker.
   He said he is not optimistic about a role in the new German
government.
   About 220,000 government workers nationwide automatically went
into employment limbo. They will receive about 70 percent of their
pay while West German officials decide how many to keep.
   Chief East German government spokesman Matthias Gehler would not
hazard an estimate.
   ``I know I'm out of work,'' Gehler said.
   Some government workers may get jobs after the new East German
state governments are elected on Oct. 14. But tens of thousands are
expected to be shut out.
   Very few people in the Foreign Ministry are expected to get
jobs.
   ``Everyone thinks everyone in the Foreign Ministry had contact
with state security (secret police),'' said Eckhard Trenck, 40, who
works in the press department.
   Many East Germans said they welcomed unity, but felt sad at the
imminent end of their national identity and the only homeland they
knew.
   The Soviet Union carved the German Democratic Republic from the
rubble of World War II on Oct. 7, 1949.
   The nation was ruled by a succession of iron-fisted Stalinist
governments until the protests that swept the East bloc toppled the
old regime on Oct. 18, 1989. On Nov. 9, the Berlin Wall was opened.
   A Communist caretaker government ran the nation until the first
free elections of March 18, when the Christian Democrats of Prime
Minister Lothar de Maiziere were elected on the promise of quick
German unity.
   The 400-member Parliament held an emotional final sitting
Tuesday after a rocky, six-month tenure during which legislators
battled West Germany and among themselves over the terms and timing
of unity.
   Only 144 lawmakers are to be added to the West German Parliament
that convenes for the first time on Thursday. The rest are out of
work.
   ``We have fulfilled our duties,'' said Sabine-Bergmann Pohl, a
physician and president of Parliament.
   It was a sad time at East Berlin's Museum for German History,
where 25 pensioners were laid off and about half of the 160 other
workers were put on indefinite status.
   The museum - once a shrine to the old regime - was turned over
last month to the German History Museum in West Berlin, which
permanently closed some sections on Tuesday.
   It plans to empty the building by year's end and move its
artifacts to a wing of a new museum in the western side of the
city.
   A small group of employees was talking to a reporter Tuesday
when a woman came by with their layoff notices.
   ``That's what democracy is to us,'' snapped Gerta Kirchner, 70.
``I need this salary to survive.''
   West Berliner Christoph Stoelzl, the new head of the museum,
said pensioners are being laid off because West German law
regulates how much outside income they can receive.
   Peter Wensszlaw is a bit of a museum piece himself. He was a
lawyer in an East German legal system that no longer exists because
East Germany now has West German laws.
   The nattily dressed Wensszlaw, 38, stood in an unemployment
line. He said he has no bitterness about the changes that moved him
from a position of privilege to one of desperation.
   ``I was a lawyer for 19 years and a (Communist Party) member,''
he said. ``My wife was a teacher and she's also out of work. But
there is a good thing happening here. I'm optimistic.''
   Wensszlaw said an employment counselor mentioned the possiblity
of working as a tax adviser.
   ``From a Communist lawyer to a (West German) tax expert,'' he
said. ``You can't think about ideology any more.''

   The battle scars on the Reichstag testify to
Germany's turbulent past and the old parliament building's place in
German history.
   With the hoisting of Germany's flag and the singing of the
national anthem in front of the Reichstag at midnight Tuesday, the
old parliament building becomes the focal point of unification
ceremonies.
   On Thursday, the Reichstag will be host to the first session of
German lawmakers in nearly six decades as legislators from the West
and East come together for the first time in the new united
Germany.
   The sandstone edifice was heavily damaged in the last days of
World War II as German troops and Soviet soldiers engaged in fierce
fighting for the capital.
   After hand-to-hand combat, Red Army soldiers raised a red Soviet
flag atop the Reichstag, in a famous World War II photograph that
symbolized the crushing of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich.
   After the war, the West German parliament met occasionally at
the Reichstag, but never convened in full. Restoration of the
building was completed in 1971, but the main hall, where Thursday's
session will be held, was deliberately left empty as a reminder of
the unresolved German question.
   Germany got its first parliament in 1871 after Kaiser Wilhelm I
unified the country and Berlin became the capital. The building and
the parliament were called Reichstag, meaning imperial legislature.
   The present Reichstag building was completed in 1894 after 10
years of construction.
   A mysterious fire on Feb. 27, 1933, just a month after Hitler
became chancellor, gutted the building.
   The blaze served as Hitler's pretext to force passage of an act
that allowed his government to make laws without Reichstag
approval.
   The inscription ``Dem Deutschen Volke'' (To the German People)
was added to the building during World War I and is still visible
over the main portal.

   Among the thousands of bells ringing in the new
united Germany is one with a fitting inscription: a 23,000-pound
Liberty Bell given to Berlin by millions of Americans.
   The Liberty Bell, which hangs in the tower of Berlin's
Schoeneberg city hall, about three miles from the Brandenburg Gate,
was presented to Berlin on Oct. 24, 1950, by the then-military
governor of Germany, U.S. Gen. Lucius D. Clay.
   Records show 17 million Americans donated money to give the bell
to Berlin after the Berlin airlift. The nine-month airlift kept
West Berliners from starving and broke a Soviet blockade of the
city that ended in May 1949.
   The Liberty Bell bears this inscription, in English: ``That this
world under God shall have a new birth of freedom.''
   The Berlin Liberty Bell, which is electronically controlled,
rings out over the city each noon and during special celebrations.

<TEXT>
   A hijacked Chinese jetliner cartwheeled
into two parked jets at Canton airport Tuesday, setting off a fiery
explosion, killing at least 127 people and seriously injuring 46
others, officials said.
   ``The plane split the jets into pieces,'' said a Chinese man who
witnessed the crash. ``It was a horrible explosion. The whole sky
went red and the airport shook like an earthquake.''
   Money, passports, watches and clothes were scattered along the
tarmac. The crash occurred at 9 a.m., but ambulances wailed late
into the night.
   Chinese officials, Western diplomats and witnesses provided
conflicting accounts of the disaster and the resulting casualties.
   A Western survivor said there was a struggle in the cockpit of
the hijacked Boeing 737 as it landed at Baiyun International
Airport, causing the plane to careen into an empty Boeing 707 and a
Boeing 757 full of passengers bound for Shanghai.
   Other unconfirmed reports said two hijackers, Chinese men who
wanted to force the plane to Hong Kong or Taiwan, exploded a bomb
on the jet.
   A CAAC spokesman, Wang Chunfu, said only one Chinese man was
responsible for the hijacking.
   Wang told a news conference 127 people died in the crash and 46
people were seriously injured. He said 100 people, including the
injured, survived.
   Among those killed, he said, were foreigners and Chinese from
Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. He declined to release further
details.
   Premier Li Peng went to the crash site near China's main
southeast city and visited survivors at hospitals.
   The accident was the worst publicly acknowledged air disaster in
China. Previously, in 1982, a CAAC Trident crashed in the southern
city of Guilin, killing 112 people. China rarely disclosed air
disasters before the 1980s.
   Although it was a domestic flight from Ziamen to Canton, at
least two Americans were on the hijacked plane, U.S. Embassy
spokesman Sheridan Bell said. Erin Lynne Thomas of Oklahoma City,
Okla., was hospitalized in good condition with a broken limb, he
said. She reported a second American woman had been sitting next to
her, but Bell said the second woman was missing.
   An airport security officer, who only identified himself as
Chen, said the pilot tricked the hijackers into believing they were
leaving China, but the hijackers realized the truth as the jet
approached Canton.
   As the hijackers argued with the pilot, Chen said, the plane
circled the airport for about 40 minutes. Then it crashed.
   Witnesses said the 737 spun out of control down the tarmac,
sideswiping the empty plane before hitting the 757.
   ``The plane was snapped in half like a match stick,'' said a
Westerner who saw the crash scene. ``All that was left of the
fuselage was charred metal. It looked like a crematorium.''
   The conflicting reports on the number of people killed or
injured could not be reconciled immediately.
   Western diplomats said 104 people, including 10 crew members,
were aboard the hijacked plane. Diplomats said they learned of only
nine survivors, including the American woman.
   At least 150 people were aboard the Boeing 757, the airport
security official said. He said he believed ``a large number'' of
people were also killed aboard that flight.
   Tomohide Yamamoto, a businessman from Japan, said he was sitting
in the 12th row of the Boeing 757.
   ``I think those who were sitting behind the 14th row couldn't
have escaped from the plane,'' he told Japanese television. ``Only
those who were sitting in the front were rescued. After I got out
of the plane, no one came out.''
   The security official said that among the three planes, only
five people - an airplane mechanic, an air hostess, an elderly
woman, a young woman and a man - escaped unscathed.
   ``We have at least 200 people dead or injured,'' he said. He
said he believed the casualty tolls were higher than reported by
the Chinese media.
   The security official said two hijackers exploded a bomb as the
jet landed, causing the accident. Officials from the Boeing Co.,
which has an office at the airport, also told U.S. diplomats in
Guangzhou, that a bomb was detonated in the plane, diplomats said.
   But a survivor, speaking on condition of anonymity, denied the
report and said the crash was caused by a scuffle in the cockpit.
   The hijacking and crash occurred as China was playing host to
its first major international sporting event, the Asian Games.
Security forces nationwide have been on alert to prevent any
incidents that might embarrass the government.
   Several hijackings, once unheard of in Communist China, have
taken place in recent years. In April 1989, a hijacker blew himself
up after he failed to force a domestic flight to Taiwan.

   A fiery natural gas explosion destroyed
two houses and heavily damaged three Tuesday in this community
across Boston Harbor from Logan International Airport.
   Firefighters were hampered by low water pressure and winds up to
35 mph that whipped the flames, officials said. No injuries were
reported.
   Neighbors said the homes were empty because their occupants were
at work.
   ``There was just a massive explosion,'' said Dan Wall, who was
watching television at home at the time. ``Pictures came crashing
off the wall. It knocked me out of my chair.''
   Boston Gas spokesme said that justan Frank Arrical before the
noontime explosion, a utility crew had been about half a block away
digging in search of a reported leak. It was unclear whether the
digging was related to the explosion, he said.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Says Coast Guard Should Be Able to Shoot Down Drug Planes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If Rep. Lawrence Coughlin has his way, the
Coast Guard would have the authority to shoot down aircraft
suspected of carrying illegal narcotics.
   On Tuesday, the Pennsylvania Republican presented the House
Merchant Marines subcommittee with this scenario in which his
legislation wmunist Party official lashed out Tuesday at a
proposed law to limit the party's influence in the Soviet military
and police, calling it a ``step toward lawlessness.''
   The national legislature approved the law in principle Monday
and began considering amendments Tuesday. Final approval could come
as early as Wednesday.
   The bill would establish procedures for forming new political
parties and guarantee them equal rights with the Communist Party,
which agreed earlier this year to give up its constitutional
monopoly on power.
   Yuri A. Manayenkov, a member of the legislature and the party's
Central Committee, told reporters during a break in the legislative
debate that the law would usher in ``the real transition to a
multiparty system'' and create ``a good foundation for further
democratization.''
   But, he added: ``I would like to say that not all the provisions
in the draft law please us, as Communists.''
   In particular, he objected to a clause that would require
soldiers, police officers and KGB agents to ``suspend active
political participation'' in political parties, including the
Communist Party.
   ``What does `active political participation' mean?'' Manayenkov
said. ``What are the exact, concrete parameters? There aren't any.
So this would be, in fact, a step toward lawlessness.''
   The Communist Party's power and influence have waned in the past
year as President Mikhail S. Gorbachev created a powerful
presidency and appointed a presidential council that assumed much
of the authority formerly wielded by the party's Politburo.
   But the party has kept a strong hold on the military, KGB
security police and law enforcement agencies, and Manayenkov's
comments indicated that Communists are reluctant to give up that
control.
   Manayenkov also said the party plans to hold onto most of its
property, officially valued at $7.8 billion. There have been calls
by local authorities in some cities for the party to turn over its
buildings to the government.
   Maj. Gen. Mikhail S. Surkov, a legislator and head of the
political section of the Soviet army in the Transcaucasian region,
told reporters that soldiers could remain party members under the
proposed law. But he said all party meetings and other political
activities would have to take place during ``non-working hours.''
   Surkov denied allegations that officers who have quit the party
in recent months have been drummed out of the military. Of 480,000
Communists in the military, he said, only 680 have voluntarily left
the party this year, ``and not one of them was forced out of the
army afterward.''
   Nikolai Sazonov, a leader of the Democratic Socialist faction in
the legislature, called for stronger measures to depoliticize the
armed forces and law enforcement agencies.
   He said his faction would propose an amendment to prohibit any
party from giving orders to officials in the military, police and
KGB.
   ``The current proposal is too vague,'' he said. ``The party
won't give up control of the military and the KGB unless it has
to.''

<HEAD>Official Rules Out Debate on Celibacy, Women Priests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The moderator at the worldwide synod of
bishops said Tuesday there should be no debate on rules requiring
priests to be celibate and forbidding the ordination of women.
   The synod, an advisory body attended by more than 200 bishops,
was called by Pope John Paul II to discuss the formation of Roman
Catholic priests.
   The monthlong assembly, which opened Sunday with a Mass in St.
Peter's Basilica, began its official working sessions Tuesday.
   The pope has made it clear he has no intention of changing the
church position mandating priestly celibacy and an all-male
priesthood. Brazilian Cardinal Lucas Moreira Neves, the synod
moderator appointed by the pope, emphasized that these issues would
not be up for debate at the meeting.
   ``Time is not sufficient to deal with certain questions, such as
celibacy of priests, women priests, priesthood for married men,''
he told the assembly. ``These issues have already been dealt with
in a definite way in other forums.''
   Some bishops, however, are expected to raise the question of how
they can persuade more men to become priests without abandoning the
celibacy rule.
   One of the reasons cited for the decline in the number of
priests is the requirement that they be celibate and forsake
marriage.
   Earlier Tuesday, the International Federation of Married
Catholic Priests held a news conference in Rome to complain that
the ``opinion of an important minority has no voice'' at the synod.
   The organization's president, Bert Peeters of Belgium, said the
group had sent letters to all the bishops' conferences represented
at the synod to press for changes allowing ordination of women and
married men.
   Peeters said his federation is represented in 26 countries. Of
the 400,000 priests in the world, about 90,000 are married, he
said. The highest number is in the United States, with 17,000,
followed by France with 10,000, Peeters said.
   The church does not permit members of the organization to
celebrate the sacraments.
   In his speech, Moreira Neves, who is archbishop of Sao Salvador
of Bahia, said a greater effort must be made to prepare candidates
for the priesthood.
   ``The springtime of vocations experienced in many parts of the
world could turn into a cold winter if proper formation is
lacking,'' he said.
   If young candidates do not receive the proper training in
seminaries, the bishops who ordain them ``risk laying their hands
on good and nice pagans.''
   Young priests should be psychologically balanced and spiritually
motivated, and must dedicate their work to the good of the church,
Moreira Neves said.
   ``Otherwise they run the risk of throwing themselves into social
work in the role of militants, revolutionaries and labor leaders,''
he said.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Hears School `Resegregation' Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court was urged Tuesday to let
Oklahoma City children attend neighborhood schools even though that
has brought back racial imbalance. Continued desegregation of
public schools in hundreds of other American cities could be at
stake as well.
   Lawyers for the Bush administration and the Oklahoma City school
board said formerly segregated school districts should be allowed
to escape court-ordered integration plans once they achieve racial
balance.
   But a lawyer for some black parents in Oklahoma City said
returning to neighborhood schools in a city where whites and blacks
live in different areas had turned back the clock to a time when
blacks and whites were required to attend separate schools.
   In an animated, hour-long session, all eight justices asked
questions.
   Solicitor General Kenneth Starr, the administration's top
courtroom lawyer, acknowledged that many of Oklahoma City's
neighborhoods are predominantly black or white, but said, ``The
school board has no realistic control over where people choose to
live.''
   School board lawyer Ronald Day argued that a federal judge's
finding in 1977 that the city's schools were fully integrated - or
``unitary'' - freed the board from continuing forced busing and
other court-ordered remedies until all city neighborhoods are
integrated.
   Such residential segregation, Day said, ``is a phenomenon over
which this school board, indeed no school board, has control.''
   
   
   Julius Chambers, the New York City lawyer challenging the
neighborhood school plan, told the court, ``You should not let the
school district in Oklahoma City, or in any other city, reinstate
the same assignment practices that caused segregation in the
past.''
   At issue is whether once-segregated school districts are under
any continuing obligation to maintain racial balance in their
schools once a federal court says they have achieved total
integration.
   But the high court also may have to say for the first time, in a
decision expected by July, just what constitutes total integration.
   Justices Harry A. Blackmun and Anthony M. Kennedy posed
questions about the definition of ``unitary,'' and showed no
indication that they agreed with the definitions offered.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia
and Sandra Day O'Connor grilled Chambers on his assertion that
school desegregation should last as long as residential segregation
exists.
   At one point, O'Connor asked whether Oklahoma City school
officials would be required to comply with some kind of
desegregation plan ``100 years from now'' if blacks and whites
still lived in predominantly one-race neighborhoods.
   Chambers said they would be.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, the court's only black member and the
winning lawyer in the 1954 case that outlawed racial segregation in
public schools, engaged both Starr and Day in spirited exchanges.
   Referring to that landmark case, Marshall asked Day, ``What
assurance do I have that the school board will continue to honor
the Constitution?''
   And the justice challenged an assertion by Starr by stating,
``The poor Afro-American kid is still in the same school. It
remains a segregated school.''
   Before the court's 1954 ruling, Oklahoma City's public schools
were racially segregated by law. The school board was sued in 1961
for continuing to operate a dual system, and in 1972 massive busing
was ordered.
   But the same federal judge who had ordered the busing and other
desegregation tactics ruled in 1977 that Oklahoma City schools had
achieved full integration.
   Eight years later, city school officials returned to a
neighborhood schools plan for children in kindergarten through
fourth grade.
   The racial balance that had been achieved through busing
disappeared, and some parents called the result ``resegregation.''
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals disapproved the Oklahoma
City neighborhood schools plan last year, ruling that federal court
supervision in such cases ``extends beyond the termination of the
wrongdoing.''
   Other federal appeals courts have ruled - in cases from Norfolk,
Va., and Austin, Texas - that a local school board's obligation to
promote racial balance ends when the school district is declared
fully integrated.

<HEAD>Bush Meets Chile's President, U.S. Moves To Improve Relations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration took another step
Tuesday to strengthen relations with Chile's new democratic
government by allowing the Overseas Private Investment Corp. to
resume operations there.
   The announcement came during the first Washington visit of
President Patricio Aylwin since his March inauguration brought
democratic rule back to Chile. Aylwin met President Bush at the
White House Tuesday.
   OPIC is a quasi-governmental organization that facilitates
investment by U.S. firms in foreign countries.
   The White House also disclosed that Bush will travel to Chile
during a tour of five South American countries Dec. 2 to Dec. 8.
   The United States barred OPIC activities with Chile under
Aylwin's predecessor, military dictator Gen. Augosto Pinochet,
because of concerns about labor rights violations.
   Union leaders during the early Pinochet years claimed that many
labor organizers were killed by government factions.
   ``Following a review process, it has been determined that these
abuses have been eliminated,'' White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said in a statement.
   Relations between the United States and Chile now are moving
ahead and making the transition from the Pinochet era, said
Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson.
   ``There's a lot of baggage from the past from the Pinochet days
that we're trying to clean out. This is a government we feel very
strongly about and we want to make that clear in deed as well as
word,'' he said of the decision to let OPIC resume operations with
Chile.
   Pinochet remains head of the nation's 60,000-strong military,
and Aylwin recently ordered the general to cease his renewed
involvement in politics.
   Bush ``expressed the United States' strong support for Chile's
return to democracy, and our commitment to close and cooperative
relations with Chile,'' Fitzwater said in a statement.
   Aylwin told reporters after their Oval Office meeting that he
and Bush also discussed the newly signed agreement to set up a
U.S.-Chile Council on Trade and Investment, to lay the groundwork
for a future free trade agreement.
   The administration currently has a proposal pending in Congress
for a free trade pact with Mexico, like the one the United States
has with Canada.
   U.S. officials want to conclude the agreement with Mexico, which
would come at the end of 1991 at the earliest, before moving ahead
with stated intentions to open free trade with Chile or other
countries in the hemisphere, officials said.
   However, the trade council and the OPIC decision are seen as a
way the United States can encourage Chile's return to democracy and
pledge to end years of human rights abuses.
   ``We would like to reward that both for our sake and theirs,''
said Timothy O'Leary, spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative's
office. ``This is an important step toward enhancing our
relationship.''
   Bush announced in June in his Enterprise for the Americas
initiative that he wanted eventually to see free trade throughout
the hemisphere.
   Accords similar to the one reached with Chile also have been
signed with Colombia and Ecuador.
   The accord sets up a bilateral council that would include
private sector and government members to resolve trade disputes and
questions relating to investment.
   Aylwin also pressed Bush for inclusion of Chile in the
Generalized System of Preferences, a system in which Third World
countries can get special trade benefits.
   The Chilean government is working on the remaining obstacles to
obtaining GSP benefits, which center chiefly on U.S. industry's
complaints regarding the lack of patent protection for U.S.
products.
   Aylwin told reporters outside the White House that he had also
expressed to Bush his commitment to human rights and to seeing
justice done in the case of former Chilean diplomat Orlando
Letelier and an associate, who were murdered in a car bombing in
Washington in 1976.
   U.S. authorities blame agents of the military government then in
power.

   Paramilitary troops shot and killed 17
civilians and set 400 houses on fire in the troubled Kashmir valley
after an ambush attempt by Moslem separatists, witnesses and a
local official said Tuesday.
   United News of India said 20 people died.
   The government said 11 civilians, one policeman, one soldier and
two rebels died in a gunbattle between the troops and the
militants. It said a court of inquiry has been ordered.
   The shootings broke out around noon Monday in Handwara, an apple
trading town about 46 miles from the Jammu-Kashmir state capital of
Srinagar.
   The government said Moslem militants hurled a grenade at Border
Security Force troops patrolling the town market. The grenade
missed the troops, but ignited a fire in a shop that killed four
people, it said.
   A full-scale battle between the troops and about 50 militants
ensued, in which many civilians got caught in cross-fire, state
police chief Jyotindra Nath Saxena told reporters in Srinagar.
   The Kashmir valley has been wracked since January by a Moslem
movement for secession from Hindu-majority India. At least 1,300
people have been killed in battles between security forces and the
insurgents.
   Indian security forces have often been accused of human rights
abuses in trying to control the insurrection.
   About 64 percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 6 million people follow
Islam, making it the only Moslem-majority state in India.
Nationwide, Moslems account for 12 percent of India's 880 million
people.
   Phansung, a Handwara town official who uses one name, and other
residents said troops set fire to about 400 houses after the
grenade was thrown and raked the town with rifle fire.
   Many victims were dragged from their homes and shot at
point-blank range, and others died in the fire which gutted the
market, witnesses said.
   A shopkeeper, Mohammad Anwar, said he saw a government official
being stopped by the troops in the street and made to sit down on
the pavement.
   ``Then they just shot him in the head and threw him into a
burning shop,'' Anwar said.
   A senior state government official of the district, Mushtaq
Ahmed Gannai, said many of the 1,500 people inhabiting the shopping
neighborhood were missing.
   There were reports that 200 schoolchildren had not returned
home, he said. Handwara has a population of about 30,000.
   Among the dead was a former Kashmiri lawmaker, Malik Ghulam
Rassol, who was dragged out of his home and shot, his neighbor Jana
Begum said.
   She said her brother's wife and her son were also were shot to
death when they ran out of their blazing home.
   Four people were hit by bullets as they traveled in a taxi. On
Tuesday, the taxi was seen crashed into a wall, its windshield
punctured by bullet holes and the upholstery covered with dried
blood.
   The smell of burned flesh emanated from the smoking debris of
the buildings that housed shops on the ground floor and houses on
the upper stories.

   While a Cincinnati art gallery and its director
stand trial for obscenity, the Brooklyn Museum is showing
deliberately ``objectionable'' artworks funded in part by the
National Endowment for the Arts.
   Museum officials culled the display of nude children, embracing
lesbians and homo-erotic paintings from their own collection, in
response to what they call the current climate of censorship.
   The exhibit, ``The Brooklyn Museum Collection: The Play of the
Unmentionable,'' also includes three Robert Mapplethorpe
photographs, including a study of a nude black man. Twenty percent
of the funding came from the NEA and the rest from donations,
museum officials said.
   ``The really mind-bending discovery is that museums and private
collections throughout the land are already replete of art which
would send certain politicians and certain public pronouncers
crazy,'' said Robert Buck, the museum's director. ``It's already
been this way for thousands of years. Art is a reflection of
life.''
   NEA spokeswoman Virginia Falck said Tuesday the endowment was
not aware of the nature of the exhibit and was ``looking into it.''
The endowment has come under attack from conservatives for using
government money to fund art projects they believe is obscene.
   Joseph Kosuth, considered one of the leaders in the conceptual
art movement that began in the 1960s, received an NEA grant last
spring for an unspecified exhibition, giving just the briefest
details of the kind of art that would be displayed. He decided to
comb the Brooklyn Museum for art that would illustrate what he
believes is th fallacy of artistic censorship.
   Kosuth said he asked the curators of the museum's six major
departments to come up with artwork that could be considered
objectionable by some.
   ``It really shows the history of the culture of intolerance,''
said Kosuth. ``We're only organizing what's already there. We're
showing that this is endemic to the whole cultural context and that
a country shouldn't assault itself this way with this kind of
debate.''
   The exhibit includes a broad range of paintings, photographs and
sculpture. Among the artwork displayed are Rodin's bronzes of
lesbians embracing, 19th century paintings of nude children, and an
18th century Hindu painting of a man urinating into another man's
mouth called ``Intoxicated Ascetics.''
   One of the seven photographs at issue in the obscenity trial of
a Cincinnati art gallery and its director shows a man urinating
into another man's mouth. The prosecution rested its case Monday
after jurors took their first look at the explicit pictures.
   The Brooklyn Museum exhibit also includes a series by the
contemporary photographer Larry Clark whose series ``Teen-age
Lust'' shows explicit photographs of sex acts, as well as a photo
of a nude brother and sister. The boy is pointing a pistol at his
sister, who is tied up.
   ``Mapplethorpe would be considered mild compared with some of
the work,' said Kosuth.
   The exhibit, which opened Sept. 27 and runs until Dec. 4, is on
display in the grand lobby.
   ``It hits you right when you walk in,'' said Kosuth. ``But there
are signs up letting people know if they don't want to see it or if
they don't want their children to see it.''
   Juxtaposed between the artwork are quotations about art and
censorship by historical figures such as Adolf Hitler, Joseph
Goebbels and George Bernard Shaw.
   The quote from Hitler reads: ``Artist does not create for the
artist; he creates for the people and we will see to it henceforth
that people will be called in to judge its art.'' Shaw's quote
reads ``Assassination is the extreme form of censorship.''

   ``Hi Johnny ... we're having three
grandchildren, not two - Michelle is having twins,'' was the joyful
message to one of more than 900 American hostages in Iraq and
Kuwait.
   ``You're in my thoughts constantly, constantly, constantly.''
   Families of those trapped in the Mideast began sending messages
to their loved ones Tuesday, taping them on a hotline set up by the
Voice of America.
   ``These are radio postcards,'' said VOA Director Richard
Carlson.
   The families have been told to keep their messages personal, to
refrain from expressing political views and to avoid using last
names so they don't tip off Iraqi authorities searching for
Americans in hiding.
   A State Department task force has started calling the families
and giving them the hotline number, along with instructions on what
type of messages to prepare.
   The first calls to the hotline were poignant.
   One, to Sergio ``from the west coast of Mississippi,'' said:
``Missy will be coming home for Thanksgiving. I pray you'll be
here, too. Love, Mickey.''
   Another was to Bob ``from his loving wife Sue.'' Assuring him
the family was doing well, she added: ``We're praying for your safe
return. We miss you very, very much. Come home soon.''
   There were also some humorously cryptic messages. This one, to
Mike from Jeff, said the caller had spoken to ``Mrs. W. in New
York. Notre Dame has won its first three games. We think about you
every day.''
   The 30-second greetings will be aired starting Thursday on the
government-owned radio network. VOA, which since the gulf crisis
began has increased its English and Arabic-language programs to 24
hours a day, will broadcast the messages in three five-minute
segments during each hour of the station's morning news program.
   On the first day, the messages may be aired in a 15-minute
segment.
   An estimated 600 to 700 Americans - mostly men - are believed
trapped in Kuwait, with another 300 to 350 in Iraq. Most of their
families were allowed to leave.
   Iraqi authorities have rounded up about 100 Americans and moved
them to industrial and military facilities as ``human shields'' to
guard against U.S. bombings.
   The rest of the Americans in Kuwait are hiding from
house-to-house searches by Iraqi security forces. State Department
officials say many of those captured were fingered by informants
who led security forces to their hideouts.
   In many cases, Iraqi troops broke down doors to get into
apartments where Americans were hiding in cramped quarters and
suffering food shortages and uncertainty about their fate.
   A special round-the-clock task force at the State Department has
been keeping in touch with the families in the United States,
relaying information about the hostages if they have it and
providing moral support. It has also begun referring families to
support groups.
   VOA, which broadcasts news and entertainment in 43 languages
around the globe, said this was a first-of-its-kind operation.
   The only comparable project was a program of messages in Pashto
and Urdu, the languages spoken in Afghanistan and Pakistan, to
refugee families after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.
   Within hours of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, the Iraqis
began jamming VOA's Arabic language service, along with the British
BBC's Arabic service.
   But the jamming has eased considerably in recent days and the
English-language broadcasts have not been disrupted at all.
   The VOA recently received permission from Bahrain, off the coast
of Saudi Arabia, to use medium-wave transmitters for its
English-language service, providing the closest facility to Iraq
and occupied Kuwait.

<HEAD>Court Hears Case On Restoring Man To Sanity So He Can Be Executed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Louisiana officials should be barred from
giving a mass murderer mind-altering drugs to restore his sanity so
he can be executed, the Supreme Court was told Tuesday.
   ``It's fundamentally wrong,'' Baton Rouge, La., lawyer Keith
Nordyke argued in behalf of death row inmate Michael Owen Perry.
   ``The medications don't cure Mr. Perry. They may mask his
insanity for a period of time so we can feel better about executing
him,'' Nordyke contended.
   But Rene Salomon, an assistant state attorney general, said the
powerful drugs being given to Perry are beneficial. And Salomon
emphasized that Louisiana has a strong interest in seeing Perry
cured - so he can be executed.
   At one point, Justice Harry A. Blackmun said, ``It doesn't seem
to make much sense to cure a man only to execute him.''
   But Justices Antonin Scalia and Byron R. White suggested that
Louisiana officials are doing nothing more than administering drugs
routinely given to people suffering from Perry's mental illness.
   Why is it outrageous, Scalia asked Nordyke, to say Perry cannot
turn down normal, beneficial treatment solely to avoid execution?
   Nordyke said such treatment, because of its punitive aim,
violates the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment,
and that administering it against Perry's will violates his rights
as well.
   ``There is a fundamental right bottomed on human dignity,''
Nordyke contended. He said no other state uses medication for
punitive purposes.
   But Salomon said Perry's ``right to some sort of
self-determination has been greatly diminished'' by his status as a
convicted criminal.
   Perry was convicted of killing his parents and three other
relatives in their Lake Arthur home in 1983.
   He was judged to be sane when he committed the crimes and
mentally competent to stand trial. He lost his sanity while on the
state's death row.
   Tradition and a 1986 Supreme Court decision bar states from
executing anyone who is insane.
   When Justice Anthony M. Kennedy asked Nordyke whether it is
against Perry's ``medical interests'' to forcibly inject him with
such drugs, the inmate's lawyer answered, ``Ultimately, it will
kill him.''
   ``I was talking about his interests prior to execution,''
Kennedy said.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, the only member of the court opposed
to capital punishment under all circumstances, asked Salomon why
state officials simply did not give Perry enough mind-altering
drugs to kill him.
   ``It would be cheaper,'' Marshall suggested caustically.

   A submarine has retrieved the top half of the
cargo door that ripped away from a United Airlines jetliner last
year, sweeping nine people to their deaths, a Navy spokeswoman said
Tuesday.
   The discovery ends a needle-in-a-haystack search of the Pacific
Ocean floor. The Sea Cliff submarine recovered the bottom half of
the door last week.
   The Sea Cliff located and recovered the top half Monday evening
from 14,100 feet of water 90 miles south of Honolulu, lifting the
wreckage to the surface with its hydraulic jaws, said Pacific Fleet
spokeswoman Sandy Stairs.
   Stairs did not know how far the door's top half was found from
the bottom half.
   The three-man Navy mini-sub and its support ship were expected
to return to Pearl Harbor on Tuesday.
   The door will be turned over to the National Transportation
Safety Board, which wants to know why it tore away from United
Flight 811 shortly after takeoff from Honolulu International
Airport on Feb. 24.
   The Boeing 747 carried 355 passengers and was bound for New
Zealand. Shortly after takeoff, the cargo door opened at 22,000
feet, sweeping nine passengers from the plane. The crew managed to
return the disabled jet to Honolulu.
   After investigators examine the recovered debris, parts of it
will be sent to the Boeing Co. in Seattle for a more detailed
review under board direction, NTSB officials said.
   A preliminary examination of the door's lower half showed the
door had fractured lengthwise near the midspan latch. The eight
sectors of the latch lock were all in the locked position and were
deformed.
   The NTSB determined that faulty design of a locking mechanism
probably caused a cockpit light to falsely indicate the door was
locked, but wants to examine the door to confirm its findings.
   The agency blamed United, Boeing and the Federal Aviation
Administration for failing to corect problems with the door.
   It asked the Navy to find the cargo door in hopes that
examination could lead to better aviation safety rules.

   Trade school officials, upset by budget cut
proposals that would eliminate many of their institutions from the
student loan program, began to search Tuesday for other ways to
save money.
   The $500 billion deficit-reduction agreement between the White
House and congressional leaders calls for cutting $2 billion from
the student loan program, mainly by reducing loan defaults.
   ``I'm pleased with the approach they took - assigning the
savings over the next five years,'' said Dallas Martin, president
of the National Association for Student Financial Aid
Administrators. ``It certainly is a much more manageable and
realistic way to approach the problem.''
   The total of student loan defaults is $7.8 billion.
   To trim $2 billion, the budget negotiators would eliminate from
the student loan program correspondence or home study programs and
schools with default rates of 30 percent or more. Eligible students
would be required to have a high school diploma or the equivalent,
and credit checks on students aged 21 or older would be required as
a condition of a loan, the negotiators proposed.
   ``There clearly is going to be more scrutiny applied to'' the
student loan program, Martin said of the recommendations. ``There
certainly are going to be needy students who are not going to be
able to get loans. It's just going to require everyone to tighten
up a little bit.''
   Officials of the National Home Study Council and the National
Association of Trade and Technical Schools have been working on
alternative budget-cutting strategies.
   The trade school association plans to send a ``reform package''
to Capitol Hill on Wednesday that will help reach the dollar goals
``with minimum damage being done to students,'' said President
Stephen Blair.
   ``The guaranteed student loan program was established to make
sure people who are unable to get bank loans still can get a
loan,'' said Blair.
   He said about half of the 650,000 students attending the
association's 13,000 trade and technical schools are over age 21.
   The Education Department last month called for close scrutiny of
60 schools with high loan default rates - ranging from 20.4 percent
to 81.5 percent.
   Blair said the ``reform'' proposal will focus on improved
student admission testing, stronger refund requirements and delayed
disbursements of student loans.
   The National Home Study Council sent a letter to the Office of
Management and Budget on Tuesday, saying that eliminating home
study schools from the student loan program ``would not result in
any significant default savings in the coming years.''
   The council's four-point plan includes requiring that 15 percent
of a school's students not use the federal aid program and not
granting financial aid that exceeds the tuition amount.

   A leukemia patient whose quest for a bone-marrow
donor found perfect matches for 10 people but none for herself is
having complications from a transplant from her mother.
   Allison Atlas was in stable condition and improving Tuesday, and
could be released in two to three weeks, said Susan Edmonds, a
spokeswoman for the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.
   The 20-year-old native of Bethesda, Md. received a bone marrow
transplant from her mother in August. She was readmitted to the
hospital Sept. 18 after suffering a negative reaction, including
skin rash, nausea and vomiting, Ms. Edmonds said.
   The complications did not mean she was rejecting the marrow, Ms.
Edmonds said.
   Before the transplant, donors were sought throughout the United
States and Israel for the former New York University student.
   A group called Friends of Allison Atlas obtained 50,000 blood
samples. None was a perfect match for Miss Atlas, but for 10 other
patients they were.
   In the absence of a transplant, the condition is fatal.

<TEXT>
   Rwandese refugees, some who have lived in
Uganda for over a half-century, crossed into their homeland and
attacked several villages, state Radio Uganda said Tuesday.
   The radio mentioned no casualties in the raid Sunday by armed
civilians and uniformed gunmen serving in Uganda's National
Resistance Army.
   Haji Moses Kigongo, the vice chairman of the ruling National
Resistance Movement, condemned the raid in a statement and denied
Uganda knew of it in advance.
   Kigongo said Ugandan authorities had repeatedly asked Rwanda to
repatriate the refugees, pointing out inherent dangers in the
continued permament exile of thousands of them in Uganda.
   Ugandan officials say there are about 87,000 Rwandese refugees
camped near Rwanda's border in southwestern Uganda.
   Other refugees have moved elsewhere in Uganda and some occupy
senior positions in President Yoweri Museveni's government,
especially the army.
   Kigongo said Rwanda's government had pointed out the problems
involved in resettling the refugees in the tiny and crowded central
Africa nation.
   Rwanda is among the world's most densely populated countries
with an average of 566 people per square mile.
   Justice Bahunga, a Rwandese diplomat in Kampala, said it was
unfortunate the raid occured when the two government were seeking a
solution to the refugees' continued stay in Uganda.
   ``In fact, we had wanted to know how many wanted to stay here or
to go back to Rwanda, but these people could not wait for the
outcome,'' Bahunga said.
   The refugees are remnants of Rwandese who fled communnal
fighting in their homeland late 1950s and early '60s.

   Gonzalo Mora Jr. was considered a key player in a complex ring
involving the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and six men
associated with it. One was Manuel Noriega's one-time personal
banker.
   ``Everybody had a role to play,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney
Mark Jackowski. ``Mr. Mora's role was to secure the funds to be
laundered - he controlled the pickups of cash.''
   Mora, who pleaded guilty in January to money laundering
conspiracy and 33 specific money laundering acts, was sentenced to
12 years and seven months in prison to be followed by three years
probation.
   ``For stupid errors I have committed, I see myself separated
from my home and my family,'' a teary-eyed Mora told the judge. ``I
ask for your mercy and leniency.''
   U.S. District Judge William Terrell Hodges said he would credit
Mora for the two years he has already spent behind bars.
   Although Mora also pleaded guilty to drug trafficking, which
carries a possible life sentence, the judge agreed to dismiss that
charge as he did with the other defendants since there was little
evidence to support it.
   Prosecutors portrayed Mora as a launderer with ties to the
Medellin cartel who organized pickups of cocaine profits from the
streets of U.S. cities and funneled them from smugglers to
undercover agents posing as high-stakes launderers.
   Mora, 35, and the other defendants were accused of scheming to
use fake corporations and complex wire transfers to launder $14
million. During the two-year investigation, the government said
some $32 million in drug profits was processed.
   Defense attorney Joel Rosenthal argued that Mora was nothing
more than a ``small-time, journeyman money washer'' used as a pawn
in the government's undercover operation.
   ``Government agents sought him out, took advantage of him and
set him up in this scheme,'' Rosenthal said, adding that other
defendants in the case heaped their wrongdoing on Mora.
   A six-month trial ended in July, with five former BCCI bankers
and a Colombian businessman convicted of conspiracy and various
money laundering charges.
   Among the defendants was Amjad Awan, Miami-based assistant
director of BCCI's Latin American division, who once told a U.S.
Senate committee that he was Noriega's personal banker and
controlled some $25 million the fallen Panamanian leader kept at
BCCI banks.
   When sentenced Nov. 30, Awan and the others face between 10 and
30 years in prison under federal sentencing guidelines.
   Before the trial began in January, two divisions of the
Luxembourg-based BCCI pleaded guilty to participating in the money
laundering conspiracy and agreed to the biggest penalty ever
slapped against a bank.
   BCCI, one of the world's largest financial institutions with 72
offices worldwide, forfeited $14 million it was accused of helping
to launder plus another $1 million in interest.
   In addition to the hefty fine, BCCI was put on five years
probation under the Federal Reserve System and agreed to open the
books to prosecutors investigating Noriega.

<HEAD>Snipers Fire on Area of Demonstration Massacre in Beirut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FAROUK NASSAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Snipers fired at pedestrians Tuesday as
church bells tolled along the Death River for at least 30
supporters of rebel Christian Gen. Michel Aoun who were killed
during a candlelight march.
   Aoun and rival Christian warlord Samir Geagea blamed each other
for the sniper attacks and the slaying Monday of demonstrators
protesting a government blockade keeping food and other supplies
from entering Aoun-held territory.
   Aoun said Geagea and his Lebanese Forces militia were
responsible for the ``horrific massacre,'' and said President Elias
Hrawi's government was ``equally responsible.''
   Geagea, however, accused Aoun of engineering the bloodbath among
his own supporters to win international sympathy.
   At least 22 of those killed were shot and some others were
trampled to death by frightened crowds, said a police spokesman who
requested anonymity. At least 100 people were wounded in the
gunfire.
   Snipers, firing at pedestrians in the same spot of Monday's
carnage, killed at least one civilian and wounded four, police
reported.
   Papal Nuncio Pablo Puente issued a radio appeal to Aoun and
Hrawi for a temporary truce pending a Vatican effort to negotiate a
compromise.
   ``I ask for a 48-hour respite to be able to meet the president
and the general to mediate an accord, which might not be ideal but
will probably halt this deadly, destructive madness,'' Puente said.
   Following Puente's plea, Aoun proposed forming a national unity
government to ``hold free general elections, disband all militias
and normalize conditions in Lebanon.''
   ``We give the papal nuncio the 48 hours he requested. ... Our
doors are open. Let him come forth and do what he wants,'' Aoun
said.
   There was no direct response from Hrawi. But a statement issued
by his Cabinet said the government ``remains determined to pursue
efforts to smother Gen. Aoun's mutiny.''
   Hrawi, Aoun and Geagea are Maronite Catholics, which has
allegiance to the Vatican and has dominated power in Lebanon since
independence from France in 1943.
   The shootings on the demonstrators occurred on a highway bridge
spanning Nahr Al-Maut, or Death River, five miles north of Beirut.
   About 5,000 Aoun supporters gathered to protest Hrawi's weeklong
blockade of gateways into Aoun's enclave, home for 150,000
Chrisians. The government troops hope to pressure Aoun and his
15,000 mainly Christian soldiers into surrender.
   In a radio address to the army, Aoun appealed for an uprising to
overthrow Hrawi's government.
   ``They call us mutineers. You and I pride ourselves for
rebelling against a government that starves its own people and
squanders state wealth,'' Aoun said in the 10-minute speech.
   Aoun and Geagea fought a four-month war this year for mastery of
the Christian enclave that covers 310 square miles orth of Beirut.
   By police count, 1,046 people were killed and 2,799 wounded in
that confronation that left Aoun and his troops trapped in parts of
east Beirut and the adjoining Metn mountains with no air or sea
outlets.
   Geagea's 6,000-strong militia, which gained control of more than
80 percent of the Christian area, has joined with Hrawi, elected
president by Parliament Nov. 24.
   Aoun has rejected Hrawi's presidency.
   Syria has 40,000 troops controlling 70 percent of Lebanon under
a 1976 mandate from the Arab League to end the Moslem-Christian
civil war, now in its 16th year.

<TEXT>
   A long-festering feud between the world's two
best chess players, both from the Soviet Union, has erupted on
American soil. There's more at stake than pride and $3 million in
prizes.
   Garri Kasparov, 27, ended Anatoly Karpov's 10-year world chess
reign in 1985. On Monday, Karpov, 39, will try to wrest it back as
the two meet for the first time in three years.
   They warmed up for the battle at a news conference Tuesday,
exchanging verbal jabs over the politics of chess and their nation.
   Kasparov, founder of a democratic political party, said he will
play under the flag of the Russian Republic - not the Soviet Union.
Karpov often has been quoted as saying: ``I have two loves:
communism and chess.''
   ``Karpov represents the power authorities,'' Kasparov said in an
interview published Monday. ``He was Brezhnev's boy when Brezhnev
was in power and now is Gorbachev's boy when Gorbachev is in
power.''
   ``I am indifferent ... under which flag he wants to play,''
Karpov replied Tuesday, insisting that his beliefs are independent
of any party or leader. ``Probably somebody will try to make
politics of this. I came here to play chess.''
   Years ago, a chess analyst likened Kasparov's agile, bold
demeanor to the dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov, and Karpov's
methodical, rigid style to former Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev.
   ``Normally, chess is a battle between two individuals: a brutal,
intellectual battle,'' Kasparov said. ``But in my case, with
Karpov, it's a fight between two different mentalities in Russia. I
identify him with the system I've been fighting.''
   The two are as different in personality as they are in political
leanings.
   Kasparov, who beat ``Deep Thought,'' a chess-playing computer,
in New York last January, is talkative, flamboyant and fluent in
English - a media darling who tirelessly publicizes chess.
   Karpov often is portrayed as a colorless introvert who tunes out
the audience while playing with surgical precision. But on Tuesday,
he fluctuated between shy and outgoing. He even hammed it up once,
presenting a copy of his book to Kasparov.
   ``I consider for this match, the situation is very ...'' Karpov
said through an interpreter, who couldn't think of the right word
in English to finish his sentence.
   ``Unusual!'' Karpov interjected in English, prompting laughter
and applause.
   Kasparov won the world championship in 1985 and defended it
against Karpov in 1986. In 1987, their championship match ended in
a tie; under the rules, Kasparov retained his title.
   The latest match will comprise 12 games in New York and 12 games
in Lyon, France, the latter beginning Nov. 24.
   The winner will receive $1.7 million and the loser $1.3 million.
Kasparov said his earnings will fund ``my private interests and the
political interests of the world.'' Karpov said he will help
victims of the Chernobyl nuclear plant fire and promote chess in
schools.
   Despite his outer confidence, Kasparov conceded that he's
nervous.
   ``It's like a new mountain,'' he said. ``You have to climb this
mountain. You presume you will win. If you lose, it's very
painful.''
   He equates chess with creativity, decisiveness and even athletic
ability.
   ``I can analyze a situation and find a solution with a minimum
of information,'' he said. ``I think I have a strong will to fight.
Very often, you're dealing with your intuition.''
   Kasparov, a prolific author, also plays soccer and tennis,
swims, bicycles and jogs. Karpov favors billiards, cards and brisk
walks.
   ``I believe it's my brain's rest if I do something else apart
from chess,'' said Kasparov.
   Now, back to the juicy stuff. It's written, often, that they
despise each other. How, they're asked, do they REALLY feel?
   Long pause. Nervous smiles.
   ``They need an answer, or what?'' replied Karpov.
   ``Do the Yankees like the Red Sox?'' offered Kasparov.

<HEAD>Soviets: Iraqis Slow in Processing Exit Visas for Soviet Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraqi authorities have slowed processing of exit
visas for some of the 5,000 Soviet workers caught there, including
870 oil workers and 372 builders of a thermal power station near
Baghdad, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Tuesday.
   Spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh told a regular news briefing that
Iraq has promised to let all the Soviets leave, but an increasing
number have ``asked to accelerate their return.''
   Gremitskikh said 2,617 Soviets, mainly women and children, have
been evacuated since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, but 5,174
remain. That includes about 150 military experts training Iraqi
soldiers how to use and maintain Soviet-built weapons.
   ``Regrettably, the Iraqi authorities clearly show tardiness in
considering the documents submitted by the Soviet side to issue an
exit permit for several groups of specialists,'' Gremitskikh said.
   He said Iraqi authorities have been withholding for one week
exit visas for 870 oilmen working in southern Iraq and 372 workers
at the Yusifia thermal power station near the capital city.
   ``It is a genuine concern,'' he said. ``More and more
specialists demand that they be evacuated.''

<TEXT>
   Former Senate Republican leader Hugh Scott
returned to the Capitol Tuesday as he approaches his 90th birthday
to be honored by senators in a reception room that bears his name.
   Scott, who represented Pennsylvania in the Senate for 18 years,
was given a plaque, a birthday cake and a book on Chinese art. An
art collector, he has written a book on art in the Tang Dynasty.
   ``There's Sen. Scott, in the middle again,'' said Sen. John
Heinz, R-Pa., as Scott's wheelchair was encircled by Republican
Leader Robert Dole, R-Kan., and by Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.,
Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., Paul Simon, D-Ill., and John Danforth,
R-Mo.
   Scott turns 90 on Nov. 11, but his former colleagues are
celebrating now because the Senate will be in recess on that date.
   Scott was presented a framed, Senate-passed resolution extending
the chamber's ``best wishes.'' Then, a dozen senators sang ``Happy
Birthday'' and several shouted ``hip, hip hooray!''
   On the wall was a portrait of Scott with his trademark pipe and
walrus-like mustache.

   A judge Tuesday ordered striking Temple
University professors to return to their classrooms, saying their
29-day walkout threatened the nation's most precious commodity -
education.
   Union leaders appealed the ruling to state Commonwealth Court.
   Common Pleas Judge Samuel Lehrer said the strike by members of
the Temple Association of University Professionals damaged the
education of some 29,000 students and also harmed the public. The
walkout began Sept. 4, the first day of classes.
   ``Education is vital to the health, safety and welfare of this
nation and this community,'' said Lehrer, who ordered the faculty
to return Wednesday.
   Temple had threatened to cancel 1,900 of its 4,700 classes that
haven't met since the strike began, leaving 6,000 students without
any classes and 23,000 others minus one or more classes. Union
officials estimated that about 600 members joined the strike.
   The union, which represents 1,100 teachers, librarians and other
academic professionals, were meeting Tuesday afternoon to decide
whether to defy the order.
   ``The strike is going to continue until our members decide to
end it,'' the association's president, Arthur Hochner, said before
the meeting.
   Lehrer ordered the union officers, defendants in the lawsuit
filed by the university, ``to make no statements or encourage any
person to violate this order.''
   The judge said his decision was ``a tremendous responsibility''
but necessary ``in promoting, safeguarding and nurturing our most
precious commodity - education.''
   Temple lawyer John Langel said he was ``pleased with the judge's
decision but dispeased they'd rather appeal than negotiate.''
   Lehrer also ordered both sides to resume negotiations.
   The university has told striking teachers that they will not be
paid for the fall semester if they do not return to work. It also
had planned to cancel those classes Tuesday. The cancellation was
delayed a day, by the judge's order, so strikers could obey the
injunction.
   About 1,500 of the private university's students have withdrawn
because of the strike. There have been student rallies and sit-ins
on campus.
   The union on Sunday rejected the university's latest offer,
which included a 5 percent salary hike in a four-year contract. It
also would have required members to contribute $260 a year toward
health insurance.
   The professors, whose salaries average about $45,500, want 7
percent raises and do not want to pay for health care.
   Temple put its last offer into effect for those on the job,
prompting the union to file an unfair labor practice with the state
labor board.

   Republican John G. Rowland called
Lowell Weicker a ``hypocrite'' during a heated debate in the
Connecticut governor's race.
   At one point Monday night, Rowland handed Weicker an empty soda
can, representing Weicker's proposal to have the state seize
unredeemed can and bottle deposits, which Weicker estimates at $20
million. They would underwrite bonds to pay for clean-water
projects.
   But with the state facing a deficit approaching $400 million
``you only need 8 billion more cans to get rid of ... the
deficit,'' said Rowland.
   Weicker glared at him.
   Connecticut Party contender Weicker criticized Rowland and
Democrat Bruce Morrison because the two congressmen missed votes on
the floor of the U.S. House on Sunday night. Only 10 of the 435
congressmen missed the vote on a budget resolution and money for
American troops in the Middle East.
   Rowland acted shocked that Weicker would criticize him and
Morrison for missing votes, noting that Weicker, a millionaire,
missed hundreds of votes as a U.S. senator, sometimes while
``crisscrossing the country collecting honoraria.''
   ``You're the biggest hypocrite in the entire United States
Senate,'' Rowland said.
   Morrison tried to capitalize on Rowland's youth - his colleague
is 33 - and said Connecticut wasn't ready for ``a governor who's 10
years younger than Dan Quayle.''

<HEAD>$80,000 in Wirth Contributions Came From Cable TV</HEAD>

   Sen. Tim Wirth has received at least $80,000 in
campaign contributions since 1987 from cable television interests,
according to a report published Tuesday.
   The Colorado Democrat last week derailed a bill opposed by the
cable industry.
   Telecommunications Inc. of Denver, the nation's largest cable
company, its executives and the company's political action
committee gave Wirth $12,300, the Rocky Mountain News said.
   During the 1986 Senate race, when Wirth faced Republican Ken
Kramer, TCI pumped $25,000 into the Colorado Democratic Party. All
Democratic candidates, including Wirth, benefited.
   Wirth has denied the contributions had any influence on his
actions last week regarding the cable industry.
   ``I get contributions from the ski industry, and I defend them
too,'' Wirth said. ``I get contributions from teachers and I am
supportive of education. I am supportive of environmental issues

<HEAD>Soviets, Lithuanians Agree to Bilateral Economic Relations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lithuania and the Soviet Union agreed Tuesday to
conduct their economic and trade relations for 1991 as equal
partners, in a further stride toward independence for the Baltic
republic.
   ``The first step has been taken, and it was a major step, and we
did not lose our bearings,'' Lithuanian President Vytautas
Landsbergis told a news conference after the Kremlin meeting.
   The talks, headed on the Soviet side by Prime Minister Nikolai
Ryzhkov, were the first at such a high level since Lithuania
suspended its March 11 declaration of independence following the
Kremlin's economic embargo against the republic.
   A communique issued afterward also mentioned preparations for
future ``negotiations.'' That is a significant concession by the
Soviet side, because President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has maintained
bilateral ``negotiations'' can occur only between two nations and
not between the Kremlin and a republic.
   Asked whether the Kremlin has changed its view on independence
for Lithuania and is now willing to negotiate, Landsbergis replied:
``We'd like to think it is so, yet further meetings will show if it
really is so.''
   On the Lithuanian side, the communique said the republic will
discuss ``addressing the opinions of various groups of residents''
- a reference to the interests of the large Russian population of
the Baltic republic who oppose independence. The Kremlin has
alleged that Lithuania's Russian population has been the object of
discrimination during the republic's independence drive.
   According to the communique, the delegations ``agreed that their
further activities will be conducted according to bilateral trade
and economic relations for the year 1991.''
   Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene explained the
agreement would mean ``closer economic cooperation'' with the
Soviet Union, based on more of a partnership principle, rather than
the previous practice of a republic's rigid subordination to the
central government.
   The content of Lithuania's trade agreements with the Soviet
Union will depend on what functions the other republics delegate to
the central government, she said.
   ``This does not mean that the Lithuanian Republic will delegate
any functions of the governing of its economy to the Soviet
Union,'' she said. ``And it does not mean that Lithuania is going
to sign the union treaty or be a part of the Soviet economy.''
   The union treaty, which is still being negotiated, will define
the relationship between the Kremlin and the republics. Gorbachev
has proposed a loose confederation, with strong economic links, but
republics such as the Baltics who are seeking independence say it
does not go far enough.
   The agreement reached Tuesday would not affect any other
bilateral pacts Lithuania has struck with any of the other 14
Soviet republics, she said.
   Mrs. Prunskiene said experts would soon begin work on
Lithuania's economic cooperation with the Soviet Union in 1991 in
matters of foreign economic trade, customs and tariffs, and other
issues.
   Landsbergis, who led the republic's delegation, said that
although the four-hour Kremlin meeting was ``100 times better than
could be reflected in the communique,'' he did not foresee rapid
political independence.
   ``Probably we'll have to cover a long path of other such
meetings before we can commence official negotiations and sign an
appropriate protocol,'' Landsbergis said.
   The agreement might not meet with universal approval in
Lithuania, where sentiment is strong for complete independence, one
Western diplomatic expert said.
   ``Moscow hopes it if it gets an agreement without territorial
concessions, it will be to its advantage,'' said the diplomat,
speaking on condition he not be further identified.
   But Mrs. Prunskiene and Landsbergis ``feel the negotiations
convey legitimacy'' to the republic's independence declaration of
March 11, he said.
   When Mrs. Prunskiene and Landsbergis report back to the
pro-independence Lithuanian parliament, they can expect reaction
divided into three camps, he said.
   The most sympathetic group of Lithuanian lawmakers ``believes in
a step-by-step process,'' and that an agreement for bilateral
economic cooperation ``is useful, and lends momentum for further
negotiations.''
   The middle camp believes in the necessity for a political
agreement, but is generally sympathetic to the economic talks.
   The third group, the most radical, says ``don't negotiate at
all. The Soviet Union is falling apart, and all we have to do is
wait.''
   Lithuania and the Soviet Union agreed to set up a working group
headed by Soviet Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Doguzhiyev and
Lithuanian Deputy Prime Minister Romualdas Ozolas, who will draft
proposals in two weeks to prepare for official negotiations, the
communique said.
   The Soviet Union also agreed to increase pension payments to
World War II veterans in Lithuania as of Oct. 1, he said.
   Commenting on the reunification of Germany and its meaning for

   A write-in candidate for Texas governor
says widespread disappointment with this year's ballot inspired him
to run on the slogan: ``A vote for me is a vote for none of the
above.''
   Tyler Pierson, owner of Tyler's Fine Dry Cleaners in Arlington,
says he's trying to increase political participation in a year when
many people don't want to vote for either major-party candidate.
   ``I guess the reason I'm running is the choices we have,''
Pierson said. ``Nine of 10 people just flat weren't going to vote
(because of) the mudslinging and it being the costliest contest in
U.S. history.''
   Pierson's name and 18 others will be posted in the voting booth,
not as part of the official ballot but close at hand for easy
Election Day reference. On Nov. 6, Libertarian Jeff Daiell will
join Democrat Ann Richards and Republican Clayton Williams on the
ballot.
   Among the 19 write-in candidates are a former stripper, a
street-corner flower vendor and a man who has hedged his bets by
filing as a write-in for every office possible.
   The write-ins also include Jim Wright (not the former U.S. House
speaker), ``Alamo'' Scott, three ministers, two lawyers, a cooking
teacher and a grocery store manager.
   ``I think I'm going to beat out the other write-ins,'' predicted
Bubbles Cash, a former stripper who owns a jewelry store. Her
bumper stickers say, ``Texas needs Cash.''
   Another write-in is Carl ``Crazy'' Hickerson-Bull, a 46-year-old
flower vendor from Austin who wants to legalize marijuana. The
perennial Austin City Council candidate has called for the
construction of horseshoe pits for cab drivers waiting to pick up
passengers at the airport. His fans drive beat-up vans with bumper
stickers that say, ``I'm Crazy Too Carl.''

<HEAD>West African Task Force Drives Back Liberian Rebels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The five-nation West African army sent
to enforce peace in Liberia attacked rebel forces led by Charles
Taylor on Tuesday and forced them to retreat toward this capital
city's eastern suburbs.
   The French news agency Agence France-Press quoted Taylor's
rebels as saying their forces were pushed back nearly four miles
and that the guerrilla army was threatened with encirclement.
   Task force soldiers advanced behind a barrage of heavy
artillery, backed by government troops and by a rival rebel faction
under Prince Johnson, who broke with Taylor last February.
   The force began the two-pronged offensive Monday night after
Taylor's rebels attacked Johnson's fighters and lobbed rockets at
remnants of slain President Samuel Doe's army holed up in his
presidential mansion.
   The multinational army, joined by Doe's soldiers, forced the
rebels back from strategic positions near the mansion, starting a
retreat.
   To the north of besieged Monrovia, task force soldiers were led
across swamps by Johnson rebels for an attack in which they seized
Taylor's front line facing Monrovia port. The West African army has
its headquarters in the port.
   Hundreds of civilians fled fighting that followed a weeklong
cease-fire called by Taylor.
   The 5,000-member task force is the strongest in Monrovia, armed
with fighter-bombers, tanks and armored cars. Johnson has pressed
the force to take action, saying he would launch an all-out assault
on the forces of Taylor and Doe unless it intervened.
   Similar threats led the task force to evacuate about 1,000
people from Doe's mansion after Johnson's men killed Doe on Sept.
10.
   The Economic Community of West African States sent soldiers from
Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Gambia and Sierra Leone to Monrovia on Aug.
24 to enforce a truce in the civil and tribal war, in which at
least 5,000 civilians have been killed.
   Refugees said in Lagos, Nigeria, that rebels from both factions
in Monrovia are merciless and seem to enjoy murdering civilians.
They said people in the capital are dying of starvation, while
others are slaughtered without reason.
   George Matey, 28, of Ghana, said: ``I have never seen human
beings being killed as they are being killed in Liberia. They were
just slashing people's throats and it was fun to them. All the
streets were littered with bodies.''
   Matey was among 7,000 hungry and penniless nationals of Nigeria,
Ghana, Guinea and Liberia who arrived Monday from Monrovia aboard
the Nigerian cargo ship River Majidun.
   An additional 10,000 refugees, mainly Ghanaians and Nigerians,
left Monrovia by sea Monday, headed for Takoradi, in Ghana, and
Lagos.
   Task force soldiers initially said their role ruled out taking
the offensive, to the extent they did not fire a shot when Johnson
captured and wounded Doe in a surprise attack on the West African
force's headquarters.
   Johnson's men nightly watch a film of Doe's last tortured hours,
the French newspaper Liberation reported Tuesday.
   Its Africa editor, Stephen Smith, wrote he was among guests
invited to view ``scenes bristling with horror . . . blood clots
from the torture; zoom shots of a face disfigured by fear, an
anguished, gaping grin twisted onto a mouth murmuring pitiable
calls for mercy.''
   Many in the audience had seen the film before and called for the
operator to hurry over ``boring episodes,'' Smith wrote.
   Doe died at about 3.30 a.m. on Sept. 10, and for two weeks his
body was on display before it was taken to Johnson's headquarters,
according to the film.
   ``My men threw it in a hole, back there, behind the house,''
Smith quoted Johnson as telling him.
   Johnson and Doe's officers support a West African plan to impose
a cease-fire and install an interim government of non-combatants to
organize fair elections in this West African nation of more than
1.7 million people.
   Taylor has opposed the transitional administration, and declared
himself president.
   Nigerian Brig. Gen. Joshua Dogonyaro, the new task force
commander, asked the United States to persuade Taylor to agree to
talks, a task force statement said Tuesday. It said Dogonyaro made
the appeal when he called on U.S. Ambassador Peter de Vos last
Friday.
   De Vos told reporters Tuesday the United States was continuing
its role of passing messages between the warring sides, but would
not otherwise intervene.

   Neither rain, nor sleet, nor hail should
keep the postman from delivering the mail, and now not even traffic
since the U.S. Postal Service started using the rail.
   Traffic is so congested along a portion of Interstate 880 that
the Postal Service is moving its overnight Express Mail on the Bay
Area Rapid Transit system.
   The mail was transported on BART from Fremont to the West
Oakland mail-sorting center on a trial basis last month, said
spokesman Dan DeMiglio.
   The 25-mile stretch of roadway takes 45 minutes to travel in
typical commuter traffic and can take twice that on a bad day,
according to the California Highway Patrol.
   The trip on BART averages 41 minutes.
   Although the Postal Service hadn't yet missed an overnight
delivery, a quality control team started to worry that the heavy
traffic would cause problems, DeMiglio said Tuesday.
   Several hundred pieces of mail are moved on BART each day.
DeMiglio called the rail service ``an incredibly reliable system''
that helps reduce pollution. In addition, he said the postal worker
who moves the mail is far less likely to be involved in an accident
on BART.

<HEAD>Uncle And Nephew Battle For House Seat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAZARD, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State House Minority Leader William R. Strong
is running against his uncle, but neither candidate is pulling any
punches.
   ``I love him, but ... what am I supposed to do?'' Strong, a
Republican, said of his Democratic opponent, Pearl Strong.
   The incumbent's radio advertisements portray Pearl Strong - a
former state reresentative himself - as a tax-raising pawn of the
Frankfort Democratic establishment.
   The elder Strong, 68, describes his nephew as a political
careerist who has turned his back on the mountains and their needs.
   ``Uncle Pearl refuses to debate me on the issues,'' begins one
William Strong ad. ``Maybe he's afraid, because he knows the people
don't approve of his past record, which is why he lost the 1986
primary by nearly 500 votes.''
   ``I'm sorry, `Little Bill,''' Pearl Strong responds in another
ad. ``You have been debating for four years in Frankfort and the
people in the 39th District have not seen anything yet.''
   Pearl Strong said he decided to run because he thought his
nephew was giving up the seat. The elder Strong - who served as
state representative from 1985 to 1986 and state senator from 1968
to 1971 - said he thought it would be best to keep the seat in the
family.
   But the younger Strong, 47, denies ever giving his uncle the
impression that he would not run.
   The campaign has already driven a wedge between the two.
   Until this fall, the uncle used to stop by William Strong's
insurance office in Hazard for a daily chat. Now, he mails his
insurance payments from his home.
   William Strong says nasty things about his uncle in his ads, but
when it comes to questions about their past, he turns into the
teen-ager who used to play baseball with his uncle in the former
coal camp of Darfork.
   ``Oh, God, yeah,'' said William Strong, reminiscing. ``That
stuff was great. That has nothing to do with this race.''
   What does, he said, is his opposition to tax increases - and his
uncle's support of them.
   The elder Strong said his nephew's vote against the $1.3 billion
school-reform tax increase cost the district several million
dollars in state projects.
   Pearl Strong said his nephew's vote was in exchange for the
Republican leadership's support of an eventual bid for lieutenant
governor. William Strong denies any deal was made.
   But both men said that, after November, the election won't come
between them, no matter who wins.
   ``When I played baseball, everybody in a different uniform was
my enemy until the game was over,'' said Pearl Strong. ``Then we
were friends.''

<TEXT>
   It may be the revenge of the nerds, but four
people suing a chic nightclub because they were allegedly denied
admittance for not wearing trendy togs would prefer to think of it
as justice for all.
   The four argued Tuesday in small claims court that they were
rejected by a doorman at the Mayan, a former porno theater lately
reopened as a club, in a manner that violated state civil rights
law. They want damages of $250 apiece.
   ``I think we were met at the door by a flippant and arrogant
doorman,'' plaintiff Jeff Stolzer told the court. ``They just
looked you over like you were scum.''
   Municipal Court Commissioner Diana Wheatley took the case under
advisement and said she would issue a ruling later.
   Sammy Chao, president of the company that owns the Mayan, denied
discrimination and asserted that doormen choose from the crowd at
the entrance to keep out troublemakers. He denied there was a dress
code.
   The plaintiffs claim the problem is that the decisions are
arbitrary. If there had been a posted dress code, they argued, they
would have been able to comply.
   The plaintiffs are Kenneth Lipton, 36, a personal injury lawyer
specializing in dog bites; Tess Dubrall, 34, an accounting manager;
Stephen Ambrosini, 33, an accountant; and Stolzer, 35, who runs a
termite company.
   All waited in vain to get in the club when they tried to
rendezvous there on May 19.
   The San Fernando Valley residents claim a violation of the Unruh
Civil Rights Act, a state law passed in 1959 to end discrimination
by businesses.
   The commissioner was mostly interested in the mechanics of the
entry process, which was described as the doorman choosing from the
crowd.
   ``The places I go you can just walk in,'' the commissioner
remarked. ``Obviously this is a more popular spot.''
   Chao said he hires doormen sensitive enough to ``see through a
person'' and screen out people who are intoxicated, dangerous or
appear to have a dangerous attitude.
  He said there was no discrimination on the basis of race or sex,
but that the number of people who could get in was limited for
safety. Additionally, room must be saved for private parties and
people with reservations, he said.
   ``It's not Disneyland,'' he said. ``We have a limited time to
provide the service .... If we run a first-come, first-serve we
will soon be filled.''
   He also said the club was in a bad area. ``It is not a
particularly safe environment,'' he said. ``If a bum shows up
you're not going to let him in.''
   The owner of Vertigo, another club, came as an interested
spectator.
   Jim Colachis' club is facing action by the state Alcoholic
Beverage Control Department because its undercover officers were
denied entry. The ABC has recommended a 30-day suspension of its
liquor license. A hearing is pending.
   Colachis said his club never set out to be egalitarian, and if
it was first-come, first-served, loyal customers would be treated
unfairly.
   The state inspectors were not dressed properly, he said.
   ``It might have been nice for the beach, but I don't think it
would be appropriate for President Reagan's home, or my
establishment. I want to encourage anything but mediocrity,'' he
said. ``Haven't we become casual enough in America?''

   A small group of animal rights demonstrators

   Members of the Farm Animal Reform Movement, or FARM, were
criticizing the department's refusal to back legislation that would
provide for more humane treatment of farm animals.
   About two dozen protesters had been marching on the sidewalk in
front of the building when some ran toward the entrance, which was
guarded by federal police.
   Five members of the group were taken into custody. Two were
released but three were taken away to be charged with trespass, one
officer said.
   The protesters were wrestled to the pavement and handcuffed.
There were no visible injuries.

   Eighteen demonstrators were arrested Tuesday
when they blocked traffic on a busy street to protest rules they
say unfairly deny disability benefits to many women infected with
the AIDS virus.
   The AIDS activists said the Social Security Administration, in
determining eligibility for disability benefits, is ignoring many
of the diseases and infections that are common in women infected
with the virus.
   The result is that many women with disabling conditions
including gynecological disorders like pelvic inflammatory disease
and chronic vaginal infections are denied benefits, the protesters
said.
   These disorders are not on a list of infections and diseases
used by the Centers for Disease Control to define AIDS. Much of the
list was compiled in the early days of the epidemic when most AIDS
victims were white, middle-class, homosexual men.
   But this definition misses the ailments and conditions common to
women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which
causes AIDS, the activists said.
   ``It's time they stopped denying women'' said Phyllis Sharpe,
39, of New York, who marched in the demonstration led by the AIDS
Coalition to Unleash Power, known as ACT UP.
   Sharpe, who is infected with HIV and suffers from diarrhea,
shortness of breath and chronic vaginal infections, is also one of
several plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed in New York Monday on behalf
of people disabled by HIV but denied disability benefits.
   In addition to women, others with HIV - children, drug addicts
and poor people - also have been unable to get benefits despite
repeated hospitalizations for diseases not on CDC's list such as
tuberculosis, heart infections and kidney failure, the lawsuit
says.
   Social Security Commissioner Gwendolyn King said officials
awarding disability benefits are not limited by the CDC definition
of AIDS.
   Officials can award up to three months of Supplemental Security
Income payments immediately upon request to people who have any of
the AIDS-related conditions on CDC's list, pending a final decision
on the claim, she said.
   But Social Security officials also ``can and do'' give this
three-month presumptive disability status to people who are sick
with HIV infection but have not progressed into AIDS, she said in a
statement.
   ``We recognize our responsibility to continue to revise our
procedures, seek broader flexibilit,, improve our guidelines and
instructions to insure that we and the State Disability
Determination Services eliminate all artificial barriers'' to
assistance, King said.
   About 100 AIDS activists marched outside the Department of
Health and Human Services headquarters building near Capitol Hill,
chanting slogans such as ``How many women have to die, before you
say they qualify,'' and ``Health care is a right, not just for the
male and white.''
   Police arrested 12 men and six women who blocked traffic on
Independence Avenue and 3rd Street, near the U.S. Capitol.
   They were charged with demonstrating without a permit and
obstructing traffic on Capitol grounds.

   The mayor proposed a $1.8 billion ``battle plan
against fear'' Tuesday, asserting that his plan to confront street
and subway crime with nearly 8,000 new police officers would
reclaim the city from criminals.
   But footing the bill for the ``Safe Streets, Safe City'' program
would mean a hike in property taxes, a payroll tax and a 25-cent
surcharge on lottery tickets sold in the city, Mayor David Dinkins
said.
   ``We will flood the streets with an army of police officers. ...
Our war against fear will return peace to our communities, leaving
us with safe streets, in a safe city,'' Dinkins said in a City Hall
speech.
   The plan follows a summer of bad publicity and stinging
criticism about the city's escalating violence. If approved, it
would put the most officers on the force in the city's history.
   Among the more noteworthy cases were a number of children hit by
stray bullets, the Zodiac gunman who apparently picked his victims
by birthdates, repeated killings of cab drivers, the killing of a
prosecutor near the Bronx courthouse and the fatal stabbing of a
tourist who was defending his mother during a subway mugging.
   The proposal would need approval from the City Council and the
state Legislature. In Albany, Republican opposition threatened the
payroll tax part of the package, which would apply to out-of-town
commuters who work in the city, as well as residents.
   Assembly Speaker Mel Miller said he had some doubts about the
constitutionality of the proposed surcharge on lottery tickets.
   If given the legislative go-ahead, the plan would not kick in
for at least another six months while potential new police officers
were trained. And with the Police Academy operating at top volume,
it would take 18 months to get the proposed 7,931 new officers
walking a beat or riding a subway car.
   Key elements of the Dinkins proposal include 2,950 new jail beds
at Rikers Island, $420 million for educational programs to prevent
pupils from dropping out and turning to crime, assignment of a cop
to every train at night, and a 54 percent increase in the number of
police on patrol each day.
   ``Fear is the ugliest of emotions,'' Dinkins said. ``Unchecked,
it may become the greatest criminal of all.''
   The plan would mean more cops walking beats. Dinkins wants the
hiring of 1,626 civilians to free officers from desk duty,
elimination of certain units, and assignment of other agencies to
certain emergencies, such as heart attacks.
   The plan calls for a property tax hike that would cost the
average single family homeowner $20 more per year, and a payroll
tax that would cost a taxpayer who earned $50,000 annually about $1
per week the first year and $1.50 the next.

<TEXT>
   Former National Assembly speaker
Carlos Nunez Tellez, who helped plot and direct the Sandinista
revolution that overthrew dictator Anastasio Somoza, died Tuesday
in Havana of heart trouble. He was 39.
   Nunez was a senior leader of the opposition leftist Sandinista
party.
   Party spokesman Dionisio Marenco said Nunez died of heart
failure in the Cuban capital, where he went in January for
radiation treatment of an undisclosed illness, said to have been
leukemia.
   ``He had been ill for a long time,'' Marenco said, but declined
to give details. Friends said Nunez, a tall, thin man, looked gaunt
when he left for Cuba.
   Nunez gained fame as one of the nine Commanders of the
Revolution of the Sandinista National Liberation Front, the
masterminds who led the July 1979 overthrow of rightist President
Somoza. The Somoza dynasty had ruled Nicaragua with an iron fist
for 42 years.
   The dictatorship was overthrown after a year of fighting in
which human rights groups said more than 42,000 people were killed.
   The nine became Commanders of the Revolution - an honorary,
lifetime title -and formed the National Directorate, the party's
top-echelon inner core.
   Born on July 26, 1951, to a humble family in the northern city
of Leon, Nunez and his older brother Rene joined the underground
Sandinista movement in 1969.
   Carlos Nunez was immediately placed in charge of the Sandinista
political front in Leon. He was shifted to Managua, where he rose
steadily through the ranks.
   He was ecretly sent out of the country to receive military and
guerrilla training. He returned in June 1979 to direct Sandinista
sabotage and agitation during the Battle of Managua that sealed the
Somoza regime's fate.
   Nunez was on the Council of State, a temporary ruling body set
up by the Sandinistas, and in 1984 was elected speaker of the
National Assembly, Nicaragua's single-house legislature.
   He steered through most of the revolutionary legislation,
including measures that gave Nicaragua greater literacy and an
improved health care system.
   The Sandinistas lost in general elections last February to a
14-party coalition led by President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.
But Nunez and his wife Milu Vargas were re-elected deputies in the
assembly.
   He leaves his wife and four children, two by an earlier
marriage.

<HEAD>Officials Concerned About Possible Heating Oil Shortages</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   State energy officials and industry
representatives were told Tuesday there are adequate supplies of
heating oil for this winter, but some worried about possible
shortages if there is a glitch in the system or increased tensions
in the Mideast.
   ``We don't think there is going to be a supply problem this
winter,'' Calvin Kemp, director of the Energy Information
Administration, said at a conference on this winter's fuel outlook.
   But Kemp and other Energy Department officials cautioned that
the supply picture could change if there are additional
interruptions of crude oil supplies or a major problem at a
refinery.
   ``We see very, very tight refinery capacity, which leaves you
vulnerable if a refinery should go down for some reason,'' Kemp
said.
   Kemp and industry experts said that the supply of propane
continues to be precarious because of demands for the fuel from the
petrochemical industry and supply problems that could develop
during the winter.
   Lawrence Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation, which sponsored the conference, also acknowledged the
potential for heating oil supply problems.
   ``The sytem is in a very tenuous balance. We're betting that
everything that can go right will go right,'' Goldstein said at a
news conference.
   Many of the scores of participants in the forum, including state
energy officials and heating oil retailers, expressed worry about
what might happen if there are problems at refineries or if oil
supplies are further disrupted because of a flareup in the Persian
Gulf.
   ``We assume the system will work perfectly under the stress that
it has been under and we're just worried about a stressed-out
system not working,'' Charles Guinn of the New York Energy Office
said during a break in the proceedings.
   George Sterzinger of the Vermont Energy Office said there is
concern that if President Bush draws on the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve some regions needing oil the most might not get it.
   Many of the state officials sought clarification from Energy
Department officials on what the federal government might do to
assure adequate supplies should a shooting war erupt in the Middle
East.
   In a ``worst case'' scenario, said Julian Wright, deputy
assistant secretary for energy emergencies, oil would be drawn from
the petroleum reserve and both the federal government and states
would be expected to impose ``very strong conservation measures.''
   Wright did not elaborate on what measures might be needed, but
he and other federal officials, as well as most industry
representatives, rejected the possibility of either price controls
or an allocation of supplies.
   Although crude oil prices have edged to within $40 a barrel in
recent days, industry experts said that much higher prices can be
expected if hostilities erupt in the Persian Gulf.
   ``If there's a shooting war, prices would go up substantially,''
said John Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation. He said he would not be surprises at prices in the
$60-a-barrel range and noted that some estimates have been as high
as $100 a barrel.
   ``It would depend how long a war would last and if (Saudi) oil
installations were damaged,'' said Lichtblau.

   President Bush on Tuesday congratulated
Germans on the historic unification of their country and said that
``45 years of conflict and confrontation between East and West are
now behind us.''
   ``At long last the day has come,'' Bush said. ``Germany is
united. Germany is fully free.''
   Bush issued a written statement just hours before the formal
merger of East Germany with West Germany. He called his remarks a
statement in celebration of German unification and addressed them
to ``the people of the united Germany.''
   Bush said the 4{ decades since World War II ``were a time of
tension and turmoil'' for the world.
   ``For your nation, fate was particularly cruel,'' he said. ``For
45 years, at the heart of a divided continent stood a divided
Germany. On the fault line of the East-West conflict, one people
split between two worlds.
   ``No more,'' Bush said. ``Today begins a new chapter in the
history of your nation. Forty-five years of conflict and
confrontation between East and West are now behind us.''
   Bush said the United States had been ``a steady partner in the
quest for one Germany'' and shares common bonds.
   ``Even as Germany celebrates this new beginning,'' Bush said,
``there is no doubt that the future holds new challenges, new
responsibilities. I'm certain that our two nations will meet these
challenges, as we have in the past, united by a common love of
freedom.''
   He called the Berlin Wall ``the stark and searing symbol of
conflict and Cold War. ... Today the wall lies in ruins. And our
eyes open on a new world of hope.
   ``The last remnants of the wall remain, there at the heart of a
free Berlin, a ragged monument in brick and barbed wire, proof that
no wall is ever strong enough to strangle the human spirit; that no
wall can ever crush a nation's soul.''

   Soldiers on Tuesday shot and killed a
Palestinian youth as he fled arrest and troops fatally wounded two
other Arabs during ensuing riots, Arab reports said.
   At the West Bank's Vatican-sponsored Bethlehem University,
classes resumed, ending a nearly three-year closure by the army
that had kept 1,600 students out of school.
   It was the second Arab campus shut during the 34-month-old
Palestinian uprising that was permitted to reopen
   The violence broke out in the northern West Bank town of Jenin,
as soldiers opened fire on a youth who tried to flee detention,
Arab reports said. Troops later clamped a curfew on the town and
nearby refugee camp, they added.
   The victim, Maher Akel, 21, was shot twice in the chest and
died, Palestinian reports said. Akel had reportedly been wanted for
escaping an army prison three months ago.
   News of Akel's death sparked rioting in the town, and soldiers
opened fire to disperse stone-throwing protesters, killing two
other youths, Arab reports said.
   One victim, 16-year-old Tawfik Rajee, was struck in the chest
and died. The other, Omar Amer, 21, suffered a gunshot wound to the
abdomen and died on the way to Rafidiyeh Hospital in Nablus, the
reports added.
   The army confirmed Akel's death and the circumstances and said
it was checking the other reports.
   The fatalities raised to 1,007 the number of Palestinian victims
of the uprising against Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Of those, 735 have been killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians
and 272 by fellow Palestinians on suspicion of cooperating with
Israeli authorities.
   In the unrest, 52 Israelis and foreigners have been killed by
Palestinians.

<TEXT>
   Amnesty International in a report Wednesday said
Iraqi troops in Kuwait have tortured and executed scores of people,
some for refusing to display pictures of Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
   ``Iraqi forces have arrested not only people suspected of armed
attacks against them but men, women and children found with
opposition literature, the Kuwaiti flag or photographs of the Emir
of Kuwait,'' the London-based human rights organization said.
   The report said troops have forced some doctors to sign false
death certificates saying bullet-riddled corpses brought into
hospitals died after admission.
   Amnesty said the report was based on information gathered by two
representatives who interviewed witnesses and victims in Bahrain.
   ``Their testimony builds up a horrifying picture of widespread
arrests, torture under interrogation, summary executions and mass
extra judicial killings,'' Amnesty said.
   Since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion, possessing the Kuwaiti flag or a
picture of the emir has been punishable by death, said Amnesty
International. Other Kuwaitis have been arrested or killed for not
putting up a picture of Saddam.
   Amnesty said detainees are being held in police stations,
schools and other public buildings in Kuwait.
   ``Those who have been released say the Iraqi military and
intelligence routinely torture detainees,'' the report said.
   Torture of victims included electric shocks, prolonged beatings,
broken limbs and threats of sexual assault. Some victims had their
hair plucked out with pincers or their finger and toe nails pulled
out, the group reported.
   It said doctors who worked in Kuwait hospitals at the time of
the invasion told Amnesty investigators that Iraqi soldiers brought
in ``scores'' of bodies of young men who had been shot at close
range. Doctors were forced to issue certificates saying the young
men died after admission to hospital, the report said.
   Iraqi troops carried out executions at Kuwait University, said
the report.
   ``We cannot even publish more details on former torture victims
in case they or their families are identified and suffer further
reprisals,'' said Amnesty.

<HEAD>EPA Fails To Assure Disinfectants Kill Germs As Claimed, Study
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency fails to
monitor the effectiveness of disinfectants and up to 20 percent of
the products sold to kill disease-causing germs may not work, a
government study says.
   In a report released to Congress on Tuesday, the General
Accounting Office said the EPA has not inspected the majority of
laboratories that test disinfectants and that the agency ``lacks
assurance'' methods to prove the germ-killers are valid.
   ``EPA's policy of `let the buyer beware' for disinfectants may
be compromising public health and wasting consumer dollars,'' the
GAO's Richard L. Hembra said in a statement released with the
report.
   The GAO report said estimates by the EPA's own experts are that
an estimated 20 percent of all disinfectants fail to kill germs or
viruses as they are supposed to, and that tests in some states show
that more than 40 percent of the compounds are ineffective.
   Americans spend about $1 billion a year on disinfectants to kill
disease-killing germs, sterilize food preparation areas, surgical
tools and bathrooms and prevent infectious disease. There are about
4,100 such products registered by the government.
   The EPA is directed by law to register disinfectants and to
assure that they are effective. But the GAO said the agency depends
on test data submitted by manufacturers and that the EPA ``lacks
assurance that the test methods and performance standards used...
are valid.''
   The report said it found the EPA had inspected only a small
percentage of the labs that test disinfectants and ``in fact...was
aware of only 12 of the 92 labs that had performed these studies.''
   After labs have been inspected, the study said, it takes the EPA
from five months to more than 2{ years to process the reports.
   Even the methods of conducting disinfectant tests, the report
said, are uncertain.
   ``Almost all of the EPA-recommended efficacy test methods and
performance standards have been embroiled in scientific controversy
for over a decade,'' the report said. The agency has done little to
resolve these uncertainties and it ``inadequately managed'' a
$384,000 study of the issue at the University of North Carolina.
   Anne Lindsay, te EPA official who supervises the disinfectant
registration, said her agency has monitored labs that do about 40
percent of the testing. She also said the agency is developing a
``re-enforcement strategy'' to assure that manufacturers accurately
report test data.
   The GAO report said that from 1977 to 1982, the EPA's own lab
found that 42 percent of all disinfectant samples failed efficacy
tests. In 1982 the agency closed its lab and since then the EPA has
depended on industry self-testing. Lindsay said only one
manufacturer has reported a batch of disinfectant that failed to
pass the tests.
   She said the EPA ``generally agreed'' with the issues raised in
the GAO report and is attempting to improve the system.

   President Bush urged top math and science
teachers Tuesday to ``take children, lift them up, inspire them,
broaden their horizons and aim them'' toward careers as scientists
and engineers.
   ``You discovered how to bring out the fun in science,'' Bush
told 107 elementary teachers who gathered in the Rose Garden after
receiving Presidential Awards for Excellence in Science and
Mathematics Teaching. ``You provide a model and an inspiration for
elementary teachers everywhere.''
   ``You're also helping to meet a crucial national need,'' said
Bush, noting that three of the national education goals involve
boosting student achievement in math and science by the year 2000.
   Statistics show that by 1995, eight of the 10 fastest growing
professions will be based on science. Skills in mathematics and a
college education will be needed for a majority of the 21 million
new jobs created by the U.S. economy by the year 2000, says the
National Research Council.
   By the year 2010, U.S. industry will face a shortage of 560,000
scientists and engineers, other statistics show.
   ``For many students you represent their very first exposure to
science and math, which gives you a vital responsibility,'' Bush
continued. ``Most kids who go on to become scientists or engineers
first became interested in those subjects in elementary school or
junior high. Most often the reason they do is because they become
exposed to a teacher like you.''
   ``You are able to take children and lift them up, inspire them
and broaden their horizons and aim them ...,'' he said.
   The presidential awards program, sponsored by the National
Science Foundation and managed by the National Science Teachers
Association, began eight years ago. Each teacher receives a $7,500
grant.
   Elementary teachers are included for the first time this year in
the program. Middle and senior high school science and mathematics
teachers will be honored in mid-October.

   The Soviet Union claimed some of the credit
Tuesday for German unification and said it hopes the merger will
bring prosperity, peace and stability to the former adversaries and
Europe as a whole.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev said ``profound internal
democratic changes'' in the Soviet Union and East Germany set the
foundation for unification.
   At a news briefing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh
said ``German unification took place, not in the least, as a result
of many changes initiated largely by perestroika in the Soviet
Union. The unification of Germany took place according to the
aspirations of the German people, taking into consideration
legitimate interests of other states.''
   The Soviet Union initially balked at the idea of a united
Germany being part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Gorbachev and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl agreed this
summer to eliminate nuclear missiles and weapons capable of
carrying nuclear warheads from East Germany.
   West Germany also promised to arrange longterm financial aid to
help rebuild the Soviet economy as well as generous payments to
cover the withdrawal of Red Army troops in East Germany.
   The agreements paved the way for East and West Germany and the
four victorious World War II Allies to sign a treaty in Moscow on
Sept. 12 signifying there were no external obstacles to
unification.
   In a message Tuesday to Kohl and President Richard von
Weizsaecker, Gorbachev congratulated the leaders and the German
people on unification, which he described as a ``great event,'' the
Tass news agency reported.
   ``Unification could not have taken place if there had not been
profound internal democratic changes in our countries, if the right
conclusions from the tragedy of the most horrible war had not been
reflected in real life,'' Tass quoted the message as saying.
   ``On this remarkable day, I want to pay tribute to all those in
my country and in your country who, overcoming sorrows, remembering
losses and honoring the dead, did not yield to prejudice and fears,
but persistently worked for the future, making this peaceful and
worthy solution of the `German issue' possible,'' it said.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said the treaty provides
adequate guarantees for Soviet security by limiting the size of
Germany's army, forbidding offensive nuclear weapons on German
soil, forfeiting any German claims to territory it lost during
World War II, and banning any revival of Nazism.
   ``Thus an end has been put to the past and the ground has been
laid for Germany's future,'' Gremitskikh said Tuesday. ``Let us
hope that the German unification will be an integral part of
European development.''
   Gremitskikh said the Soviet Union and the united Germany will
enter a new phase of relations ``which we are hopeful will bring to
both peoples and to the entire community a prosperous peace,
stability and well being.''
   Tass noted some Soviets are wary of a united Germany, but it put
that concern in a new light.
   ``There are quite a few people in the Soviet Union who feel
bitterness about the loss of an ally, the GDR. But this is the
choice of citizens of the GDR,'' Tass said.
   ``We believe that we are not losing our ally, but gaining a
friend,'' the news agency said.

   St. Louis encephalitis, a sometimes
fatal viral infection spread by mosquitoes, has struck at least 26
people in Florida, the largest outbreak in the state since 1977,
health officials said Tuesday.
   Tourists and residents were warned to wear long-sleeved shirts
and pants or stay inside at dusk, when the mosquitoes are most
likely to bite. Boy Scout troops have canceled overnight camping
trips and schools are being sprayed with mosquito killer.
   Fifteen of those infected have been hospitalized and two are in
comas, state health officials said Tuesday.
   ``It's not enough for people not to come to Florida for
vacation, but when they come I want them to know they should follow
precautions,'' said Dr. Diana Wells, assistant state
epidemiologist.
   Encephalitis is inflammation of the brain. St. Louis
encephalitis, so named because it was identified there in 1933, is
the most common type and belongs to a family of viruses known as
arboviruses.
   Symptoms range from headaches and fevers to coma and death.
Other symptoms include stiffness of the neck, irritability, extreme
lethargy, tremors and seizures.
   The death rate is usually about 7 percent but no deaths have
been reported with the latest outbreak, Wells said.
   Last month, the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta reported
high levels of St. Louis encephalitis in Texas and Florida and high
levels of Eastern equine encephalitis - a more deadly arbovirus -
in Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey.
   Federal health officials reported 108 cases of various arboviral
encephalitis last year.
   Eight people died during Florida's last severe outbreak in 1977,
when 110 cases were reported.
   The last major outbreak of St. Louis encephalitis struck nearly
3,000 people 15 years ago, the CDC said.
   There are usually about three cases a year in Florida, said
Ernie Dufree, a spokesman for the state Department of Health and
Rehabilitative Services.
   Since late July, 26 cases have been documented in central and
southern Florida and preliminary blood tests show that another
seven are infected, Wells said. About 35 more possible cases are
being investigated, the CDC said.
   The youngest person to be afflicted is 14 and both of the
comatose victims are over 55, Wells said, adding that older people
are most likely to show symptoms.
   The state health department recommends that people stay inside
for an hour before sunset and two or three hours afterward. If they
do go outside, they should wear long pants and sleeves and use
insect repellant, Wells said.
   Boy Scout troops in southern and central Florida have canceled
overnight camping troops, some high school are playing football
games during the day rather than at night and several schools have
sprayed mosquito killer on campus.
   The Florida outbreak is expected to peak early this month and
the mosquitoes will disappear when twilight temperatures fall into
the 60s.

<TEXT>
   ``Nick and Nora,'' a musical version of ``The
Thin Man,'' has been postponed until next spring because the
producers have not been able to completely finance the $5.6 million
production.
   The musical, starring Barry Bostwick and Joanna Gleason as
Dashiell Hammett's famous detective couple, was to have opened in
February at the St. James Theater. It is one of the most highly
touted musicals of the season, one of the few big American shows
expected to compete with ``Miss Saigon,'' the British blockbuster.
   Rehearsals for the musical are now expected to begin on Jan. 2,
1991, in New York with an out-of-town engagement beginning Feb. 26
at the Mechanic Theater in Baltimore, a spokesman for producers
James Pentecost and Charles Suisman said Tuesday. The show now will
open at the St. James in New York on April 25 after three weeks of
previews.
   ``Nick and Nora,'' which has a book by Arthur Laurents, music by
Charles Strouse and lyrics by Richard Maltby Jr., has been in the
works for more than five years. It has been plagued by money
troubles.
   A last-minute backers audition, with Bostwick, Gleason and other
cast members, was held Sept. 18 at the Dramatists Guild for
potential investors. Variety quoted Pentecost and Susiman as saying
they needed to raise some $2.5 million to make the musical's
initial October rehearsal date.
   The audition was held, Variety said, because a three-performance
workshop of the show in August didn't raise the required amount of
capitalization from prospective backers.
   ``Nick and Nora'' was to have started a pre-Broadway tryout in
Baltimore on Dec. 20 at the Mechanic Theater and run there through
Jan. 19. The Mechanic will fill part of those dates with the
touring company of ``M. Butterfly,'' said Hope Quackenbush,
managing director of the Baltimore Center for the Performing Arts.

<TEXT>
   Florida's only historically black
public university will get $350,000 from a subsidiary of British
Petroleum Co., a company that does business in South Africa.
   Frederick Humphries, president of Florida A&amp;M University,
defended the gift Tuesday, saying the school was abiding by the
same standards as other schools.
   Thirty schools applied for the grants, which will mostly go to
provide scholarships for minority engineering students. Florida A&amp;M
was one of four schools that got the $350,000 grants.
   The other schools were Tuskegee University in Alabama, North
Carolina A&amp;T State University, two other historically black
schools. The fourth school was Ohio State.
   Charles Taylor, a spokesman for Cleveland-based BP America Inc.,
said he saw no contradiction in his company making donations to
encourage minority education in the United States while its parent
company does business in South Africa.
   ``We have had a long interest in what transpires in South
Africa,'' Taylor said from Cleveland. ``We share with all of the
opponents of apartheid an abhorrence of that system and we have
been aggressively opposing that system.''
   ``I wish that all American companies would get out of South
Africa,'' Humphries said. ``But some do and some don't.''
   Humphries said London-headquartered BP Co. abides by the
Sullivan Principles, a code of ethics established in 1977 by a
Philadelphia minister who has now backed away from the guidelines
as inadequate to dismantling apartheid.
   The Sullivan Principles called on companies operating in South
Africa to, among other thingts, use fair employment practices and
to train blacks and other nonwhites for management positions.
   ``The minimum is the Sullivan code and the maximum is I wish
they were all out,'' Humphries said.
   In 1986, the U.S. Anti-Apartheid Act banned most new investment
by American companies in South Africa and put more restrictions on
certain industries, like computers.
   Since South Africa has no oil reserves, it is dependent on
foreign companies for oil. In 1988, BP sales in South Africa were
estimated at $90 million and its assets were estimated at $400
million, said Donna Katzin, director of South Africa programs for
the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility in New York.
   Companies wholly owned by British Petroleum in South Africa
employ some 5,000 workers. Companies in which BP has some interest
employ 23,000 workers, Katzin said.
   ``I would say that BP is right up there at the top of the list
with other oversea corporations that do substantial and strategic
business in South Africa,'' Katzin said.
   British Petroleum supports education of blacks in South Africa
and works to improve living conditions, Taylor said.
   ``Our position is simply that we believe that we can have more
impact inside that system than a total withdrawal from it,'' he
said.

   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee on
Tuesday unanimously approved the treaty ending the post-World War
II division of Germany and sent it to the full Senate.
   The committee had hoped the Senate could act before the 7 p.m.
EDT unification of West Germany and East Germany, but the Senate
recessed for the evening without action.
   President Bush congratulated Germans on the historic unification
of their country and said that ``45 years of conflict and
confrontation between East and West are now behind us.''
   ``At long last the day has come,'' Bush said in a written
statement. ``Germany is united. Germany is fully free.''
   The committee voted 19-0 in favor of the treaty, signed in
Moscow last Sept. 12 by Britain, France, the Soviet Union, the
United States and East and West Germany.
   After Senate approval, President Bush was to sign the treaty on
Wednesday.
   Members of the committee said that, even though they voted for
the treaty, they still had reservations about a united Germany.
   ``Nothing should stand in the way of the treaty, but these
sentiments need to be said, and we will have to watch Germany,''
said Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., who was born in Berlin and fled
Nazi Germany at age 2.
   Boschwitz noted Germany's involvement in wars and the Holocaust.
   ``Germany is Germany from the standpoint of its history, and I
think we need to have some recognition of that fact,'' Boschwitz
said. ``I have a mixed emotion about seeing it get back together
again. Hopefully the feelings and mentality of the people have
changed.''
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., committee chairman, said he shared
Boschwitz's thoughts.
   ``I agree with him that we should all keep our eye on how things
progress in Germany,'' said Pell, whose father, former Rep. Herbert
C. Pell, helped prepare for the Nazi war crimes trials in Nuremberg
after World War II.
   The committee turned back an attempt by Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., to amend the treaty uniting the two Germanys with a
statement reaffirming U.S. rejection of the Soviet Union's
annexation of the Baltic states.
   Committee members agreed, however, to submit a parallel
resolution saying the same thing rather than trying to put it in
the treaty and delaying its ratification.
   ``The State Department doesn't want this due to the fact that it
might offend the Soviet Union, but I don't care about that,'' Helms
said, pointing out that it simply reasserts a position held by the
United States for 50 years.
   ``I don't think we ought to renege now,'' he said, adding that
the Soviets have been touting the treaty as a confirmation of
Soviet jurisdiction over the Baltic states of Estonia, Lithuania
and Latvia.
   Pell said the administration fears the amendment might serve as
an example to the Soviet Union to add its own language to the
treaty.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said he and other committee members
had written the president on Friday expressing concern about any
impact the treaty might have on the Baltic states.
   He said the president is expected during the signing ceremonies
on Wednesday to say that nothing in the treaty alters the U.S.
policy of rejecting the Soviet Union's annexations.

<HEAD>The Dartmouth Review President Resigns Over Anti-Semitic Quote</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HANOVER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of The Dartmouth Review
resigned Tuesday after the conservative off-campus weekly drew fire
for quoting Hitler in its masthead on a Jewish holiday.
   ``I will not be a part of this newspaper anymore - I am not an
anti-Semite,'' said C. Tyler White, who is also a student at
Dartmouth College. The newspaper is not funded by the college.
   Student officials of the newspaper, which has previously been
decried as sexist, racist and homophobic, said the quote was put in
by an unknown staffer without the authorization or knowledge of
editors. One called it ``sabotage.''
   But White said the newspaper's official response failed to
express the staff's regret or to assume responsibility for letting
the quote be printed.
   ``The editor-in-chief has failed in his job, and now we all must
wear the albatross of anti-Semitism because he won't take
responsibility for the issue's contents,'' White said in a
statement.
   He is the third of the weekly's 24 members to resign because of
the incident.
   The edition distributed Saturday on Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day
of Atonement and Judaism's most solemn day, carried a quotation
from Adolf Hitler's ``Mein Kampf.''
   The passage inserted without attribution in The Review's
masthead said:
   ``Therefore, I believe today that I am acting in the sense of
the Almighty Creator: By warding off the Jews, I am fighting for
the Lord's work.''
   Cheers and congratulations greeted the resignations at the
Student Assembly office, where students stacked petitions bearing
more than 2,000 signatures and planned a protest rally Thursday.
   ``The main message we're trying to get across ... to the nation
and the national media is that The Dartmouth Review in no way
represents the campus,'' said Brian Ellner, president of the
assembly, which represents 3,200 undergraduates.
   In a statement, Editor-in-chief Kevin Pritchett blamed the mess
on a ``tasteless prankster.''
   Pritchett has said staffers were investigating how the quote got
into print.
   The Review attacked administrators, saying ``it is unfair and
wrong to confuse our arguments with what is clearly a case of
sabotage.''
   College officials also condemned the weekly. President James
Freedman and other top administrators were to speak at the rally.
   The newspaper, which has been published since 1980 with backing
from some of the nation's most prominent conservatives, has been
vilified over the years for its views on women, homosexuals and
blacks.
   William Cole, a black music professor, resigned in August after
The Review had belittled him in print for seven years.
   Cole said his effectiveness was compromised by the attacks. He
filed a $600,000 libel suit against the newspaper that was later
settled out of court for no money.
   Review staffers also were involved several years ago in a
sledgehammer attack on shanties erected on campus as part of a
protest against enforced segregation in South Africa. Several
staffers were suspended.

<HEAD>UNICEF Says Sudan Drought May Kill Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. Children's Fund official said
Tuesday that advancing drought in Sudan could kill up to 1 million
people, and donor countries have not responded to calls for help.
   ``I think we have the makings of a major humanitarian disaster,
a bombshell disaster, that hasn't caught the attention of the
world,'' Richard Reid, UNICEF's regional director for the Middle
East and North Africa, said.
   He said 4 million to 5 million southern Sudanese are threatened
by drought worse than that which killed more than 250,000 Sudanese
in 1988.
   ``It is probable that unless there is focused and solid and
rapid intervention, we could lose at least 250,000, and it could go
up to the estimated 1 million that died in 1984,'' Reid warned.
   With UNICEF as the lead agency, Operation Lifeline Sudan saved
more than 200,000 lives last year when drought gripped Sudan, a Red
Sea nation with a population of more than 25 million. This year few
donor countries have been offering help.
   UNICEF collected about $67 million for the 1989 relief campaign.
   ``This year we have received practically nothing, less than $5
million,'' Reid reported.
   ``Frankly, there is, up to now, on the part of everyone involved
in addressing this humanitarian need, a hesitancy, a semiparalysis,
a disarray, and a lack of focus. We certainly hope that will
change.''
   Diplomats said privately that distaste for the military junta of
Lt.Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir, which seized power from the elected
government of Sadek el-Mahdi last year, is a major reason donations
dried up.
   U.S. laws bar foreign aid to military juntas that oust elected
governments.
   ``And so that assistance was lost,'' Reid said, ``and one by
one, donors have fallen off. But we're faced with a situation that
really shouldn't have political markings, and that is a situation
in which the children are going to be the most affected.''
   The major crop-growing areas have had no rain for more than two
months, he said.
   The drought leaves vast areas of the country without food;
people weakened by starvation lose their resistance to disease and
die, particularly children under age of 5.
   ``A disease like measles can spread through a village like
wildfire, and you have a mortality rate of up to 20 percent,'' the
UNICEF official said.
   ``I remember that . . . just before we began Operation Lifeline
Sudan, we would go into huge districts in which we couldn't find a
trace of children under age 5. They had all died.''
   A civil war between the Islamic government in Khartoum in the
north and the Sudan People's Liberation Army in the mostly
Christian and animist southern three provinces has cut off relief
deliveries in half of Sudan.
   Reid said railroad engineers, barge boatmen, and truck drivers
were afraid to carry grain shipments through the southern provinces
without security guarantees that relief agencies can't provide.
   El-Bashir's takeover added to the bureaucratic problems because
new officials were named in key ministries, such as transportation.
   El-Bashir announced a cease-fire with the SPLA through the end
of the year so children can be vaccinated, but he said Tuesday no
reply has come from the rebels.
   He is to meet Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar on
Wednesday to discuss the situation.
   The Secretariat is the organizing agency this year for Operation
Lifeline Sudan.

<HEAD>Clashes Reported in Kiev During Nationalist Demonstration</HEAD>

   Police on Tuesday clashed with nationalist
demonstrators defying a ban on rallies in front of the Ukrainian
Parliament in Kiev, according to press reports.
   One official predicted more violence unless the ban is lifted.
   Several people were injured in the third consecutive day of
pro-secessionist rallies in Kiev, about 400 miles southwest of
Moscow. It was first time any violence was reported.
   On Monday, the conservative majority in Parliament voted to
uphold a decree prohibiting rallies in front of the building.
Opposition members of the Parliament walked out following the
decision.
   On Tuesday, hundreds of people gathered to urge the dissolution
of Parliament and the Ukraine's secession from the Soviet Union,
the official Tass news agency reported. Many in the crowd carried
the nationalist blue-and-gold flags.
   Tass did not elaborate the clash, but the nationalist Rukh
movement reported fights began after several dozen demonstrators
tried to break through police barricades. ``Several old women were
beaten,'' and one policeman also was injured, it said.
   Rukh blamed the violence on unidentified ``provocateurs,'' but
it also quoted an unidentified nationalist sympathizer as saying,
``There was fault on both sides.''
   Some members of Parliament demanded a commission be formed to
investigate the violence outside, Tass reported.
   Deputy Pavlo Movchan was quoted as saying the decision to limit
access to the square outside Parliament ``will only increase
tensions and lead to further confrontation.''
   On Monday, tens of thousands of Ukrainian nationalists marched
and chanted slogans against the Communist Party and the republic's
leaders. One-day warning strikes idled factories in the more
radical western Ukraine, but many enterprises in Kiev and eastern
parts of the republic did not close.
   The Ukraine is the second most populous of the Soviet republics,
after Russia, and is an important grain-growing area.
   Its Parliament has declared sovereignty from Moscow and claims
the right to overrule national law. Rukh and other nationalist
groups want it to go further and take rapid moves toward secession.

<TEXT>
   People in this little farming
village in the Thuringian forest - once divided by a concrete wall
and a death strip of communist patrols and guard dogs - began
``dancing into unity'' late Tuesday on the eve of East Germany's
demise.
   President Bush visited Moedlareuth's western section while vice
president and dubbed the village ``little Berlin'' because of the
dividing wall.
   The whole village of about a dozen homes and 60 people
celebrated German unification smack in the center of the border
that for 45 years kept them apart. More than 2,000 people from
dozens of surrounding communities and even farther away jammed the
narrow streets as Germans officially united Wednesday.
   Those from the eastern section of Moedlareuth reckoned they had
every reason to celebrate.
   ``My cousins lived just 100 meters (330 feet) away, and I wasn't
even allowed to wave to them from here,'' recalled Rudolf Richter,
a 62-year-old farmer whose house overlooks the remains of the wall.
   Moedlareuth was divided from 1945 until November 1989.
   In 1952, border fortifications were installed. The mill was torn
down to prevent its being used as a hiding place for would-be
escapees to the West.
   Vehicle and pedestrian traffic between east and west Moedlareuth
was halted.
   A concrete wall 2,160 feet long was added 1966, with an
observation tower containing guards with shoot-to-kill-orders.
   Eastern residents were forbidden to wave to relatives on the
western side. Two brothers who lived on opposite hillsides
sometimes gazed at each other through binoculars, although that
also was banned by the communists.
   Visits might be permitted once a year for elderly people, less
for others. But not to eastern Moedlareuth, a forbidden zone for
non-residents including East Germans.
   Contact was so controlled Moedlareuth residents had to ride
three hours by train to visit relatives who lived within shouting
distance.
   At least two people escaped into the West despite the border
fortificaton. There is no record of anyone being shot trying to
flee through Moedlareuth.
   On Tuesday night, laughter peeled through the night air,
firecrackers popped and beer flowed.
   A rock band was brought in for the festival, which was called
``dancing into unity.''
   Many celebrants gazed at the nearly 1,000-foot section that
remains of the wall. Officials want to keep it as a reminder.
   Other revelers inspected the abandoned observation tower or
strolled down the death strip.
   ``It's unbelievable that this could happen to a village, to
people who love one another,'' said Bernhard Lerch, 33, an East
German who fled with his wife and two children to West Germany last
fall before the revolution.
   Asked what unity means to him, Lerch's son, 8-year-old Daniel,
replied, ``Freedom. That's all.''

   The army killed 85 Maoist Shining Path
guerrillas in three attacks in a remote, coca-rich jungle region
north of Lima, Col. Juan Rivero, military commander for the region,
said Tuesday.
   He said six soldiers were wounded in the clashes Thursday in the
Upper Huallaga River valley, 280 miles northeast of Lima.
   According to military reports, heavy fighting in the area the
past two weeks now has left at least 155 dead on both sides, with
guerrillas suffering most of the losses.
   Rivero said the army was pursuing a rebel column that attacked a
police station Wednesday, killing four police agents. A failed
guerrilla ambush Friday left 15 rebels and two soldiers dead, he
said.
   Rivero's headquarters are in Huanuco, a departmental capital 155
miles northeast of Lima.
   The Upper Huallaga is the world's main supplier of coca leaf,
the raw material for cocaine. Shining Path guerrillas provide
protection for drug traffickers in exchange for money and arms.

   The Senate on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved
a resolution praising President Bush's actions in the Persian Gulf
and supporting continued deployment of U.S. troops to deter Iraqi
aggression.
   But the debate leading up to the 96-3 vote had nervous echoes of
25 years ago, when a similar act opened the way to escalation of
the Vietnam War.
   Senator after senator rose to say Bush could not use the
resolution as justification for future military moves. In fact,
debate seemed aimed more at stating what the document was not than
what it was.
   ``This resolution is not an authorization for the use of force,
now or in the future,'' said Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine. ``This resolution is not a blank check. This
resolution is not a Gulf of Tonkin Resolution.''
   In 1964, Congress approved a resolution giving President Johnson
the authority to retaliate for an attack on two vessels in
Vietnam's Gulf of Tonkin. The resolution later was used as
authorization for a widening of the U.S. war effort.
   Tuesday's vote came a day after the House approved a similar
resolution on a 380-29 vote. Senators said they thought it was
important to send a signal of U.S. unity by giving legislative
support to Bush's moves so far.
   Voting against the measure were Sens. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., and Bob Kerrey, D-Neb. Not voting
was Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif.
   The resolution ``strongly approves the president's leadership''
in winning approval of eight resolutions in the United Nations
Security Council that impose a global trade embargo on Iraq and
call for the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait.
   It also states: ``The Congress supports continued action by the
president in accordance with the decisions of the United Nations
Security Council and in accordance with United States
constitutional and statutory processes ... to deter Iraqi
aggression and to protect American lives and vital interests in the
region.''
   Kennedy called that language ``a blank check endorsement for
future actions. ... It is, in effect, a Tonkin Gulf Resolution for
the Persian Gulf'' that abdicates Congress' war-declaring power.
   Kennedy said he was voting against the measure because it could
``easily be used by President Bush as approval in advance by
Congress of military action against Iraq, up to and including the
launching of an all-out war.''
   But Mitchell said the resolution speaks only to actions already
taken.
   ``Future actions must be judged on their own merits, in view of
the circumstances at the time,'' he said.
   ``The Constitution makes plain that only Congress can provide a
declaration of war. The president of the United States has no legal
authority to commit the United States to war,'' Mitchell said.
``The Senate, then, will be involved in future grave decisions
should the crisis expand and the shadow of war approach.''
   But Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, noted there had not been a
declaration of war since World War II.
   ``There was none for Korea, none for Vietnam, none for Grenada,
none for Panama,'' he said.
   ``We are somewhat in a no-man's-land'' in the Persian Gulf under
the War Powers Act, which requires presidential consultation and
congressional assent for deployment of troops in an area of
imminent hostilities, he said.
   Cohen said the Gulf situation, in which the ``most massive
military forces'' of Iraq and a multinational force are faced off,
is ``clearly a situation involving imminent hostilities.''
   A slight miscalculation by either side could lead to war, he
said.
   And Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., noted the crisis
involves the United Nations, a situation not envisioned by those
who ambiguously divided up the powers to make war in the
Constitution.
   But there appeared to be a broad consensus that for any military
action that goes beyond defensive and deterrent moves, Bush must
come to Capitol Hill.
   ``If the president decides he must (attack Iraq), and risk tens
of thousands of American casualties, then he must do so with the
approval of Congress - in advance, in specific terms,'' Kennedy
said.
   The Senate resolution was a non-binding document that would not
need to be signed into law by the president. The version the House
approved Monday is one that would need White House approval and
would become law.
   Meanwhile, House Speaker Thomas Foley said a 25-member
bipartisan House delegation would leave Friday for a visit to the
Persian Gulf. The group will be in the region three or four days to
oversee the multinational military buildup, Foley, D-Wash., said in
a statement.

   A minister who complained about simulated oral
sex in an art festival puppet show said Tuesday he had met with the
puppeteer and festival officials and was satisfied future shows
won't be open to children.
   In a joint appearance with puppeteer Jon Ludwig and officials of
Arts Festival of Atlanta, the Rev. John Norton said he acted
hastily in contacting news organizations to complain about the
Sept. 21 performance of ``Zeitgeist,'' a show for adults that
included puppets simulating oral sex.
   ``My complaint was not with the performance itself, but with
unaccompanied children having access to a performance with adult
material,'' said the Methodist minister from Marietta.
   Patricia Gann, executive director of the festival, said she
appreciated Norton's suggestions for the future, ``which will
ensure that unaccompanied children will not have access to all arts
festival activities.''
   TV evangelist Pat Robertson fueled the controversy last week by
complaining that the National Endowment for the Arts, which is
under attack by conservatives in Congress, had funded the show.
   Frankie Abourjilie, vice president for public relations at
Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network in Virginia Beach, Va.,
contended Tuesday that ``the NEA funded the puppeteer directly''
through funding of the Center for Puppetry Arts.
   Ms. Gann denied Robertson's assertions.
   The festival did receive money from the Georgia Arts Council,
which itself receives NEA funds, but the council's grant for
theatrical products was spent entirely on other works and none went
to Ludwig's performance, she said.
   Festival officials said the puppet show, staged as a
``surrealistic morality play'' for adult audiences only, was
financed entirely by ticket sales and concession receipts, without
support from any government source.
   Norton, without mentioning Robertson by name, complained Tuesday
that others had misconstrued his concerns.
   ``We do not feel it is appropriate for us to be placed in the
position of being connected with the greater issues others have
attempted to draw us into,'' he said.
   Norton, Ms. Gann and Ludwig read statements at Tuesday's news
conference, but refused to answer questions.

<HEAD>Italy Asks Extradition of Former Argentine President, 4 Officers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Rome court has asked that
former president and general Jorge Videla and four ex-officers be
extradited to face charges of human rights abuse, a federal court
disclosed Tuesday.
   The others were former navy chief Emilio Massera; former air
force commander Orlando Agosti; cashiered Gen. Carlos Suarez Mason
and retired Gen. Roberto Bocalandro.
   Justice and Foreign Ministry spokesman made no immediate comment
on the extradition request. Approval, however, was unlikely.
   The charges stem from the disappearance of four Argentine
citizens of Italian descent during the 1976-83 ``dirty war''
crackdown on suspected leftist subversives by the military regime.
   Relatives of Silvia Roncoroni, Maria D'Amico, Maria Ferrando and
Dora Greco filed the suit.
   The four young women were last seen in 1978 in coastal Mar del
Plata, 250 miles south of Buenos Aires, the government news agency
Telam reported, citing court and Foreign Ministry sources.
   During the crackdown, at least 9,000 Argentines vanished after
being arrested and were presumed executed, according to a
presidential commission. It said many were tortured, and that most
were innocent of any crime. Human rights groups contend up to
30,000 ``disappeared'' and are presumed dead.
   Videla was convicted by Argentine courts in 1985 of human rights
abuses, cashiered and sentenced to life in prison.
   Massera and Agosti were convicted with Videla and cashiered.
Massera was sentenced to life in prison. Agosti served a term of
three years, nine months and was released. Suarez Mason, also
cashiered, is in jail facing 39 charges of murder.

   The European Community will provide almost $2
billion in aid to Egypt, Jordan and Turkey as compensation for
economic hardships stemming from the Persian Gulf crisis, the
Italian foreign minister said Tuesday.
   ``The cohesion and the unity in the international community is
stronger than before,'' Gianni De Michelis said about opposition to
Iraq's seizure of Kuwait.
   De Michelis said the European Community would contribute $660
million as a group, with individual members providing a total of
$1.32 billion for a grand
   total of $1.98 billion.
   Turkey lost substantial revenue with by the shutdown of an Iraqi
oil pipeline through its territory, Jordan is burdened by an influx
of refugees and Egypt with the cost of keeping troops in Saudi
Arabia to deter an Iraqi attack.
   Most of the aid will be in the form of grants, and some in
loans. De Michelis said the European Community also would consider
assisting countries in Eastern and Central Europe and elsewhere
that are beset economically.
   Italy is chair of the 12-nation group, whose foreign ministers
approved the assistance while attending a European Security
Conference meeting here to prepare for a 35-nation summit in Paris
Nov. 19-21.
   The 35 ministers who attended the preparatory session condemned
Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait.
   ``These actions jeopardize the just and peaceful world order to
which more cooperative European relations are making an important
contribution,'' they said in a resolution introduced by the United
States that called for an immediate and unconditional withdrawal
from Kuwait.
   Two tentative decisions to help Egypt, Jordan and Turkey were
made last month.
   De Michelis cautioned Iraqi President Saddam Hussein not to
attack Israel, saying there would be ``a strong reaction'' from the
international community.
   ``It is difficult not to foresee a military reaction in that
case,'' he said, adding that his country would participate in any
military action against Iraq approved by the U.N. Security Council.
   But De Michelis said more time should be taken to see if the
curbs on trade approved by the Security Council produce an Iraqi
withdrawal from Kuwait.
   He said he concurred with President Bush's statement to the U.N.
General Assembly on Monday that a pullout could set the stage for
addressing the Arab-Israeli dispute.
   ``We cannot accept Saddam Hussein's attempt to link the
problems,'' De Michelis said. ``And we cannot reward aggression and
invasion.''
   But, he said, ``we have always stated the fact that there are
problems in the region'' that need solutions.
   He listed them, without elaboration, as Palestinian, Israeli and
Lebanese problems.
   Saddam insists he's being singled out for harsh treatment and
that Israel's retention of territory lost by defeated Arab nations
in 1967 should be taken up simultaneously with Iraq's territorial
dispute with Kuwait.
   De Michelis said Bush's approach was ``rational and right'' and
didn't reflect ``more flexibility'' toward Baghdad.

   A cocaine-processing laboratory blew up
Tuesday in a house next to a school in Medellin, killing nine
people and injuring 57, including 20 children at the school,
officials said.
   A police communique said four children were among those killed,
none of them pupils at the school.
   A mushroom-shaped cloud rose after the explosion, and odors of
gasoline, ether and other chemicals filled the air, witnesses said
in broadcast reports from the scene.
   More than 20 vehicles were destroyed.
   The explosion came at 9:45 a.m., when the school was filled with
hundreds of pupils.
   In a communique, Mayor Omar Flores' office blamed the explosion
on a bomb containing an estimated 35 pounds of dynamite in the
basement of the house.
   It said it could not be determined if the bomb went off
accidentally.
   The Medellin and Cali cocaine cartels have been at war in
Colombia for almost two years in a battle for control of the
cocaine smuggling into the New York City area.
   Before Tuesday, about 190 people had been killed in the war.

   Former newspaperman Jim Minter jumped
to an early lead Tuesday against impeached former federal judge
Alcee Hastings in a runoff for the Democratic secretary of state
nomination.
   With 347 of 4,528 precincts, or 8 percent, reporting unofficial
returns, Minter had 23,871 votes, or 71 percent, to Hastings' 9,804
votes, or 29 percent.
   Preliminary counts Tuesday indicated just 13 percent of the
state's 5.9 million registered voters cast ballots, elections
officials said. That translates to just 7.5 percent of the state's
voting-age population of 10.3 million.
   In the lone, U.S. House runoff, former Harris Corp.
space-defense lobbyist William Tolley opposed former state Senate
president John Vogt for the GOP nomination to face Jim Bacchus, an
Orlando attorney who captured the Democratic nomination without
opposition.
   The winner of the secretary of state race will face
well-financed Republican incumbent Jim Smith, who served two terms
as a Democratic attorney general, in the Nov. 6 election.

   A barrage of rockets battered the
Afghan capital on Tuesday, killing 25 people and wounding 22
others, Radio Kabul said.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack but the
radio broadcast, monitored in Islamabad, blamed U.S.-backed
insurgents.
   For more than a dozen years, Moslem rebels, called mujahedeen or
Islamic holy warriors, have been fighting to topple successive
communist-style governments in Afghanistan.
   From their headquarters in neighboring Pakistan, insurgents have
been waging a bloody war that has left an estimated 1.5 million
people dead.
   Another 3.5 million Afghan war refugees have fled to Pakistan
since December 1979 when more than 115,000 Soviet troops intervened
to crush a burgeoning Moslem insurgency and install a friendly
government.
   Moscow withdrew its soldiers in February 1989 in line with a
United Nations-negotiated agreement.
   Most of the people were killed when a rocket hit a central coal
distribution center where people were stocking up with fuel for the
winter, the radio said.
   The radio report could not be independently confirmed.
   Hundreds of people have died in rocket attacks on the Afghan
capital in the last two years.

   Louis Freddie Kohlman, a jazz drummer who
backed such greats as Billie Holiday and Diana Ross with a powerful
beat, has died of cancer at the age of 75.
   Kohlman died Saturday at his home in New Orleans.
   Kohlman, who was known only by his last name, began playing
professionally in his teens when he appeared with such musicians as
Oscar ``Papa'' Celestin, Sam Morgan and Joe Robichaux.
   A native of New Orleans, he moved to Chicago in 1956 to play at
Jazz Ltd. He stayed 11 years before returning to his hometown,
where he performed at clubs and hotels and later at the New Orleans
Jazz and Heritage Festival.
   As a member of the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, Kohlman traveled
widely in the United States and overseas.
   Kohlman appeared in several movies, including ``Pete Kelly's
Blues,'' ``Pretty Baby'' and ``Angel Heart.''
   Among the performers he worked with were Marian McPartland,
Leslie Uggams, Perry Como and Dolly Parton.

<HEAD>New Device Gives Amputees Sensation Through Artificial Limb</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amputees who wear artificial feet can sense
the floor with a new electronic device that was developed by a
company here and made its national debut Tuesday.
   The Sabolich Sense-of-Feel System was developed by John
Sabolich, president of the Sabolich Prosthetic &amp; Research Center.
It was demonstrated on the ABC-TV program ``Good Morning,
America.''
   The system uses small pressure transducers implanted in the
artificial foot to signal electrodes in the socket of the
prosthesis. The electrodes in turn stimulate the skin of the limb
stump and transmit sensation to the brain.
   The $1,400 electronic system is powered by a standard 9-volt
battery and can be used by any lower-limb amputee, Sabolich said.
   ``It's the most incredible thing,'' said Holly Howard, an
above-the-knee amputee from Tyler, Texas, who is one of 20 people
testing the device so far. ``For the first time in 10 years, I can
feel my foot and know where it is.''
   Sabolich said the invention he first conceived of eight years
ago might also have the potential to reduce, and even eliminate,
so-called phantom pain for amputees who feel discomfort as if from
the missing limb.
   ``The brain really likes to have information from the floor,''
Sabolich said. ``When it doesn't have information from the floor,
the nerves sort of dangle, and that increases phantom pain and
doesn't let the person know where their foot is on the ground.''
   Dr. William N. Harsha, an Oklahoma City orthopedic surgeon,
asked to comment on the system, said he had not known of it
``except in the research stage, and John Sabolich has been in the
forefront of that.''
   ``I would think it would be of great benefit,'' Harsha said.
``It would enable the patient to know where his foot iswhen he is
walking, going up and down the stairs. Each of these movements is
different and requires different control.''

<HEAD>Mitterrand Rules Out French Military Presence in Germany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand on Tuesday ruled out
a longterm French military presence in unified Germany unless it
comes within a new, overall European defense framework.
   The French leader made his comments in interviews with the
German television networks ARD and ZDF hours before East and West
Germany formally unified on Wednesday.
   ``A big country like yours, does it need foreign troops on its
soil, even friendly troops?'' Mitterrand asked.
   At a Sept. 18 summit in Munich with West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, Mitterrand announced France will withdraw half its
50,000 troops stationed in Germany over the next two years.
   The World War II Allied powers - the United States, Soviet
Union, France and Britain - give up their occupying rights in East
and West Germany with the unification.
   But Kohl has suggested he would like the Western allies to
continue a military role after unification, even though all have
announced intentions to quickly reduce troop levels.
   ``If it's judged necessary in the framework of European defense,
that's something else,'' Mitterrand said. ``A new accord would be
necessary. We must speak clearly'' on this.
   The 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe
will meet in Paris next month to consider the future shape of
Europe since the democratic revolutions that swept Eastern Europe
last year.
   Meanwhile, European Affairs Minister Edith Cresson said France
should launch an economic offensive to establish markets in
post-unification East Germany.
   ``We count on Germany to play the game (of competition)
fairly,'' she said in a report to be presented to the government
Wednesday.
   The report was made public hours before Mitterrand replaced the
outspoken Cresson with Elisabeth Guigou, a close adviser, in a
Cabinet shakeup marking the start of a new legislative term.
   Cresson, who caused an uproar last spring when she said Japan
was ``out to conquer the world'' with exports, said she had asked
to quit the government.
   In the report on Germany, Cresson said France has ``proved its
good will and its solidarity'' by supporting German unification.
   Now, she said, France should be vigilant in ensuring that
European Community measures aimed at helping East Germany do not
provide West German businesses with unfair advantages.
   Cresson said French companies has encountered difficulties as
they tried to move into East Germany in recent months, because of
disorganization there and also because of ``abuses'' by West German
firms.
   She said some West German firms had found ways to pressure the
East German government to their advantage.

   Yugoslav leaders Tuesday blocked
Slovenia's move for a self-sufficient defense force and ordered the
federal army to remain in the defiant region.
   The presidency said the nation's stability was treatened by the
constitutional amendment passed Friday by the Slovenia Parliament
saying the republic was solely responsible for its defense.
   In a statement, the presidency said the Slovenian move was
designed to ``destroy the constitutional competence of the
federation'' of Yugoslavia, which is beset by widening ideological
and ethnic rifts among various groups.
   ``This, the presidency ... cannot and shall not permit,'' said
the statement, carried by the state Tanjug news agency.
   In response to the decision, Slovenian President Milan Kucan
said his republic's military will ``fulfill only decisions and
commands of the presidency of Slovenia.''
   But in a speech on Slovenian television, he said the army would
``fully discharge its obligations ... as part of the armed forces
of Yugoslavia'' in case of war.
   The collective presidency, formed of representatives from each
of the country's six republics and two provinces, is the highest
body in the land. It is also in charge of the armed forces.
   The development sharpened the already intense conflict between
federal officials and the westernmost republic, seeking to make
decisions independent of the central government in Belgrade.
   Slovenia and Croatia are the only republics led by
democratically elected governments, following elections earlier
this year. Both want the nation changed into a loose confederation
of sovereign states.
   The meeting by the federal presidency was called to discuss the
heightened tensions between Communist-ruled Serbia and Croatia,
Yugoslavia's largest republics. Many of the estimated 500,000 Serbs
in Croatia claim to be victims of discrimination and harassment.
   The presidency early Wednesday demanded Croatia withdraw special
riot police from towns where members of the Serb minority seized
large amounts of automatic weapons from police armories last week.
   The presidency also ordered Croatia to release ``illegally
detained Serbs.'' At least 27 people have been arrested and one
Croatian policeman was wounded in clashes with Serb protesters
since the arms were taken.
   Federal officials said the seized arms must be returned and
barricades removed.
   ``The situation in many area with mixed national population has
seriously deteriorated,'' the presidency's statement said.
   President Borisav Jovic, a Serb now holding the annual rotating
chairmanship of the presidency, cut short his visit to the United
Nations to attend the session in Belgrade.
   Tension between Serbs and Croats, dating to the birth of
Yugoslavia in 1918, intensified this year after the first free
elections in Croatia since 1945. Center-right parties trounced the
Communists in those elections.
   Croatia's non-Communist leaders claim the unrest in their
republic has been orchestrated by Serbia to destabilize their
republic and gain support for Serbia's hard-line policies.
   Road and rail traffic was blocked Tuesday in eastern sections of
Croatia.
   Barricades were set up by Serbs across roads and railway lines
to Knin, a Serbian-dominated city of 10,000 people near the
Adriatic coast, witnesses said.
   The Serb minority, which makes up about 10 percent of Croatia's
population, proclaimed autonomy within the republic on Monday and
staged anti-government rallies.
   Tanjug quoted the Croatian Interior Ministry as saying its units
were beginning to withdraw from Serbian-dominated areas of the
republic.

   Germany united with a burst of color under a clear
moonlit sky Wednesday to close out the most festive chapter of a
remarkable year.
   The two sides of Berlin were linked by a river of people that
stretched from Alexanderplatz, East Berlin's central square, to the
historic Branderburg Gate more than a half-mile away.
   Crowds estimated at more than 1 million swarmed down Unter den
Linden, East Berlin's main avenue, and spilled onto the broad plaza
at the base of the gate.
   Floodlights and fireworks lighted the sky as German unification
took effect at midnight to a stirring chorus of the national
anthem.
   Masses gathered from every vantage point to watch the center of
the celebration at the Reichstag, the old German Parliament
building near Brandenburg Gate.
   Germans draped themselves in the red, gold and black flag, threw
firecrackers and shimmied to the rock, swing, and jazz bands that
lined Unter den Linden.
   The gigantic party was heavily orchestrated - and commercially
sponsored - compared to the mass demonstrations that brought down
the Communist government last year and the jubilant euphoria that
followed the Nov. 9 opening of the Berlin Wall.
   ``This was overdone, all of this money,'' said East German
Hartmut Giese, 46, from a place where the Wall once stood in view
of the Brandenburg Gate celebration.
   ``But we need things like this to help bring us together, to
give us something to share,'' he said.
   On Unter den Linden, a West Berlin school teacher drew gawks as
she leaned on the railing overlooking the Spree River, smartly
dressed in black tights and a tailored Soviet major's jacket and
hat.
   ``I wanted to see what it felt like to be an occupying power in
East Germany,'' she said.
   Nearby, a huge crane suspended an East German-made Trabant, a
tiny, two-cylinder car that was one of the first products spurned
by East Germans when their borders opened to Western commerce.
   West German youths fired at it with flareguns, shredding the
now-obsolete East German flag that hanged below it.
   Leftist radicals held small rallies throughout the city to
protest unification. About 200 blew whistles outside a police
barrier at the Schauspielhaus, jeering arriving dignitaries.

   The Senate voted 90-9 Tuesday to confirm the
nomination of Judge David H. Souter to the Supreme Court. The only
dissenting votes came from liberals who fear he will oppose
abortion rights.
   The New Hampshire jurist was approved less than 2{ months after
he was tapped as President Bush's first nominee to the high court.
It was too late to put him on the court for the start of its
session this week but, age 51, he'll probably participate in its
rulings well into the next century.
   The Supreme Court announced that Souter would be sworn in as the
first item of business next Tuesday morning, before the court
begins the second week of its session.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said: ``We're obviously very pleased that Congress confirmed this
nomination. We think Judge Souter will be an outstanding justice
for many years.''
   Fitzwater said Bush hoped to attend Souter's swearing-in.
   Souter watched the proceedings from a friend's law office in
Concord, N.H.
   ``He's just exactly the kind of person with a broad background
that we need on the Supreme Court,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said
as debate on the nomination began. ``I think he showed that he is a
person of fairness. He's willing to listen. He's a person of
independence.''
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., said
he supported Souter, but warned Bush that the path of the next
nominee might not be so smooth if the president moves further to
the right wing.
   ``I want to express the hope that the administration will not
learn the wrong lesson'' from the lopsided Senate vote on Souter,
Biden said. A more doctrinaire conservative ``could well fall
outside the sphere of acceptability,'' he said.
   Souter becomes the 105th justice of the Supreme Court, filling
the seat vacated last summer by the retirement of Justice William
Brennan.
   In Concord, Souter toasted the vote with champagne and friends,
and pledged to return the nation's confidence in him.
   ``I have been given much and much will be expected of me in
return, and I will make that return to you and I will make it in
the fullest measure that I can,'' Souter said.
   The court's spokeswoman, Toni House, said Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist would administer the oath of office in private at 9
a.m., and would administer the oath in a public ceremony in the
court's ornate courtroom 15 minutes later.
   The first major case in which he will participate will be a
sex-bias dispute that will be argued before the justices Wednesday,
Oct. 10. At issue is whether employers may exclude all women of
child-bearing age - perhaps 20 million - from some hazardous jobs.
   There was little doubt Souter would be a more conservative
justice than Brennan, especially on matters of criminal law. But
Souter's position on social issues, including abortion, would be
harder to predict.
   During three days of testimony before the Senate Judiciary
Committee, Souter declined to say whether he believed the court
should overturn its 1973 ruling in Roe vs. Wade, which legalized
abortion. He said he was open-minded.
   On issues including civil rights and religious liberty, his
testimony indicated a far more moderate viewpoint than his record
would suggest.
   Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., a committee member, said there appeared
to be ``two Judge Souters.''
   ``Fortunately, the Judge Souter who testified before our
committee did not seem locked to the past,'' said Kohl, saying he
was voting for that one and hoping the Senate had not been
deceived.
   Biden said he was troubled by Souter's refusal to declare
support for abortion rights and by the judge's mixed record on
civil rights. But Biden joined the majority when his committee
approved the nomination 13-1, and said Tuesday he would do so again
in the full Senate.
   ``He's about the best we can expect, from my perspective, from
this administration,'' said Biden, reflecting the outlook of many
Democrats.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, waited until
just before the vote to announce his support. ``Judge Souter
reflected a reasoned approach and a sound understanding of the
Constitution,'' he said.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said he was unwilling to give
Souter the benefit of the doubt.
   ``The Senate is still in the dark about this nomination,''
Kennedy said.
   Souter, he said, has not met the test of a ``good faith,
in-depth, abiding commitment to the core constitutional values of
the kind so obviously at stake at this turning point in our
history.''
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., the Senate Majority Whip, said if
because of Souter the court overturned Roe vs. Wade, he would move
legislation to create a federal statute legalizing abortion.
   Hatch, an abortion foe, said opponents were applying
single-issue politics to their decisions.
   ``I hope that the litmus test mentality is not used in the
future,'' Hatch said. It would make it ``almost impossible for any
great nominee to make it on to the court. And Judge Souter is a
great nominee.''
   All nine voting against Souter were Democrats: Daniel Akaka of
Hawaii, Brock Adams of Washington, Cranston, Bill Bradley and Frank
Lautenberg of New Jersey, Quentin Burdick of North Dakota, Kennedy,
John Kerry of Massachusetts and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland. Sen.
Pete Wilson, R-Calif., did not vote.
   Souter, of rural Weare, N.H., is a graduate of Harvard College
and Harvard Law School and a former Rhodes Scholar.
   He spent most of his adult life working in the judicial system
of his home state in jobs including attorney general, trial judge
and member of the state supreme court.
   Last April, he was confirmed by the Senate to the 1st U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston. He served only until July
before being tapped by the president to succeed Brennan.
   The debate Tuesday was interrupted at one point when a protester
who shouted, ``You murderers.'' The protester was charged with
disrupting an orderly session of Congress, according to U.S.
Capitol Police.
   Souter, meanwhile, underwent a brush with the law on his way to
his friend's law office - the parking meter accepted his quarters
but wouldn't drop the red flag.
   ``If I get a ticket, you guys are witnesses,'' he joked after
giving up on the meter.
   Souter did not get a ticket.

   On the western side of the Oder River,
fireworks exploded and Germans cheered Wednesday as the flag of the
united nation was hoisted.
   But on the eastern bank, Poles were more subdued, watching with
a mixture of fear and resentment at new German attitudes and
policies.
   The ceremony marking the unification of Germany was preceded by
stone-throwing attacks by German youths on two Polish buses picking
up factory workers in Frankfurt on Oder, the German city across the
river from Slubice.
   Two Polish cars waiting to cross the border back into Poland
also were pounded by youths wielding sticks.
   ``To me, it seems horrifying,'' said one passenger, Halina
Gawronska. ``They come to us and we welcome them with open arms and
then this. We live together, we know each other. How could they?''
   ``There was always great friendship, but now we don't know what
is going on,'' said a companion, Genewa Kowalska.
   The stone-throwers, who appeared to be teen-agers, shouted
pro-German slogans, shattered the windows of the buses and injured
the two drivers.
   Some of the many Poles who work in former East Germany cities
have expressed concerns they could lose their jobs due to new visa
restrictions, the deteriorating economic situation and pro-German
sentiments.
   There has been hostility and suspicion along the border, formed
by the Oder and Neisse rivers, since it was created after World War
II. One-third of Poland is land forfeited by defeated Germany,
settled largely by Poles thrown out of Polish territory to the east
annexed by the Soviet Union.
   Some Germans have never relinquished claims to the former lands.
Some Poles, with memories of German aggression and the 6 million of
their countrymen killed during World War II, have eyed a resurgent
German neighbor with distrust.
   ``History has taught us to have some fears,'' said Leszek
Korczak, of Glogow, waiting at the border to return to Poland.
   The western border of Germany was a crucial issue for Poland
during the unification talks. Poland secured promises from the
parliaments of the two Germanys that the border would be made final
in a treaty between Poland and the united Germany's new government.
   At midnight, fireworks began to explode over Frankfurt on Oder
and the commanders of the Polish and German border stations saluted
the flag of the German Federal Republic.
   Earlier, the German border guards had changed out of their grey
uniforms into the dark green uniforms of the West German units.
   The ranking Polish official present, Slubice Major Wieslaw
Wrzosek, called unification ``a new chapter in he history of
Europe, a new chapter in relations between Poles and Germans.''
   Some of the Poles returning from Germany expressed resentment at
a policy requiring visas for Poles visiting what had been East
Germany and Berlin. No visas had been needed for Berlin, and only
an invitation for East Germany.
   ``Poles always find some way to manage but this difficulty was
not needed at all,'' said Korczak.
   The new commander of the German border station, Ultun Topp,
defended the visa policy, which took effect Wednesday.
   The German-Polish line is now the new ``outer border'' between
Eastern and Western Europe, he said.
   ``We have to control it for all the people in the European
Community. But I believe there will come a time when all the visas
will fall away. ... I hope so.''

<HEAD>WASHN: spending cuts.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   This agreement will also raise revenue. I'm not - and I know
you're not - a fan of tax increases. But if there have to be tax
measures, they should allow the economy to grow, they should not
turn us back to higher income tax rates and they should be fair.
Everyone who can should contribute something and no one should have
to contribute beyond their fair share. Our bipartisan agreement
meets these tests. And through specific new incentives it will help
create more jobs.
   It's a little known fact. But America's best job creators and
greatest innovators tend to be our smaller companies. So our budget
plan will small-and medium-size companies a needed shot in the arm.
Just as important, I am convinced that this agreement will help
lower interest rates and lower interest rates means savings for
consumers, lower mortgage payments for new homeowners, and more
investment to produce more jobs. And that's what this agreement
will do.
   And now let me tell you what this agreement will not do. It will
not raise income tax rates, personal or corporate. It will not mess
with Social Security in any way. It will not put America's national
security at risk. And most of all, it will not let our economy slip
out of control.
   Clearly each and every one of us can find fault with something
in this agreement. In fact, that is a burden that any truly fair
solution must carry. Any workable solution must be judged as a
whole, not piece by piece. Those who dislike one part or another
may pick our agreement apart. But if they do, believe me, the
political reality is, no one can put a better one back together
again.
   Everyone will bear a small burden. But if we succeed, every
American will have a large burden lifted. If we fail to enact this
agreement, our economy will falter, markets may tumble and
recession will follow. In just a moment the Democratic majority
leader, Senator Mitchell, will offer what is known as the
Democratic response - often a rebuttal, but not tonight.
   Tonight, the Democratic and Republican leadership and I all
speak with one voice in support of this agreement. Tonight, we ask
you to help us move this agreement forward. The congressional
leadership and I both have a job to do in getting it enacted, and
tonight I ask for your help.
   First, I ask you to understand how important, and, for some, how
difficult this vote is, for your congressmen and senators. Many
worry about your reaction to one part or another. But I know you
know the importance of the whole. And so second, I ask you to take
this initiative: Tell your congressmen and senatorsyou support
this deficit reduction agreement.
   If they are Republicans, urge them to stand with the president.
Urge them to do what the bipartisan leadership has done, come
together in the spirit of compromise to solve this national
problem. If they're Democrats, urge them to stand with their
congressional leaders. Ask them to fight for the future of your
kids by supporting this budget agreement. Now is the time for you,
the American people, to have a real impact.
   Your senators and congressmen need to know that you want this
deficit brought down. That the time for politics and posturing is
over and the time to come together is now. This deficit reduction
agreement is tough and so are the times. The agreement is fair, and
so is the American spirit. The agreement is bipartisan, and so is
the vote. The agreement is real, and so is this crisis.
   This is the first time in my presidency that I have made an
appeal like this to you, the American people. With your help we can
at last put this budget crisis behind us and face the other
challenges that lie ahead. If we do, the long-term result will be a
healthier nation and something more. We will have once again put
ourselves on the path of economic growth and we will have
demonstrated that no challenge is greater than the determination of
the American people.
   Thank you, God bless you and good night.

   Israel on Tuesday accepted Germany's
unification with some hesitancy, tainted by the memory of the
slayings of 6 million Jews by the Germans a half-century ago.
   ``As Jews we have mixed feelings. We cannot forget our scars
from the past, what happened to our people during the Second World
War,'' said Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner.
   ``On the other hand, there is a new reality now with which we
have to live,'' Pazner said in a telephone interview.
   Pazner called on the new united Germany to ``remember its debt
to the Jewish people ... and do all it can to act favorably toward
the state of Israel, in bilateral ties and in the European and
international arenas.''
   Shamir, leader of the right-wing Likud bloc, was born in Poland
and lost his parents and other close family in the Holocaust. He
emigrated to British Mandatory Palestine before the war.
   Some Israeli leaders were more negative about the festivities in
Berlin.
   Parliament speaker Dov Shilansky, a concentration camp survivor,
said in a statement read on state television:
   ``On the day of united Germany the people of Israel should wear
sackcloth, douse their heads with ashes, mourn and chant
lamentations.''
   Eliahu Ben-Elissar, chairman of Parliament's Defense and Foreign
Affairs Committee said: ``The unification of Germany is happening
too soon. We should have raised our voices, the voice of conscience
against unification. This we didn't do and it is too bad.''
   Leaders of the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial museum called on
Germany to fight anti-Semitism, neo-Nazism and refrain from
supplying arms to Israel's Arab enemies.

   Robert Mapplethorpe took sexually explicit
photographs to come to terms with his own troubled life, an art
historia testified Tuesday at the nation's first obscenity trial
of a gallery and its director.
   Robert Sobieszek, curator of a New York photo museum, said in
videotaped testimony played for the jury that seven Mapplethorpe
photos at issue have as much artistic merit as others in his
175-picture retrospective.
   ``The story was of a very full and rich artist who was
interested in documenting what was beautiful and elegant on the one
hand and tortured and troubled on the other,'' said Sobieszek, from
the George Eastman House museum in Rochester, N.Y.
   Mapplethorpe, who was homosexual, began work on the show,
``Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment,'' after he was diagnosed
with AIDS. He died of acquired immune deficiency syndrome in March
1989 at age 42.
   ``They reveal in a very strong, forceful way a major part of his
life,'' said Sobieszek. ``A troubled portion of his life he was
trying to come to grips with.''
   The Contemporary Arts Center and its director, Dennis Barrie,
are on trial on misdemeanor charges of pandering obscenity and
using children in nudity-related material.
   Barrie may testify Wednesday, defense attorneys said.
   The charges stem from the seven photos Sobieszek referred to
showing the exposed genitals of two children, a man urinating in
another man's mouth and anal penetration involving various objects.
   The Cincinnati gallery hosted the show for seven weeks ending in
May.
   If convicted of both charges, Barrie could be sentenced to one
year in jail and fined $2,000. The gallery could be fined $10,000
for conviction on both counts.
   Jurors heard depositions from Beatrix Mary Nevill of London and
Claryssa Dalrymple of New York City, mothers of the girl and the
boy in the photos. They testified that Mapplethorpe took the
pictures in 1976 with their approval and exhibited them with their
consent.
   At issue is whether the seven Mapplethorpe photos violated
community standards of obscenity.
   Prosecutors, who have completed their case, sought to establish
that contemporary community standards provide one criterion for
defining obscenity.
   Defense attorneys said the exhibit drew more than 80,000 people
in Cincinnati. They want that considered as an indicator of
community standards.
   Jerry Stein, an arts critic at The Cincinnati Post who gave the
exhibit a favorable review, testified that the photographs of the
children are an ``innocent or non-sexual presentation.''
   Judge David Albanese refused to set aside a defense subpoena
seeking testimony from Owen Findsen, arts reviewer for The
Cincinnati Enquirer. The newspaper fought the subpoena.
   Defense attorneys said Findsen would be called to testify
Wednesday.
   Jurors might begin deliberations Wednesday. The trial in its
second week.
   Meanwhile, police said Tuesday they began issuing misdemeanor
disorderly conduct citations for at least 30 people who
participated in a Sept. 24 protest of the city's prosecution of
Barrie and the gallery.
   Most of the citations were issued anonymously in the names of
``Jane Doe'' or ``John Doe'' as police attempt to identify
protesters through police films.
   Police said protesters unlawfully blocked streets and tied up
traffic without a parade permit.

Budget Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush asked Americans Tuesday night
to support a demanding $500 billion package of tax increases and
spending cuts. ``Everyone who can should contribute something,''
the president said.
   Claiming rare unity with leaders of the Democratic-controlled
Congress, Bush said in a 10-minute televised speech from the Oval
Office that the package was written in ``eight months of blood,
sweat and fears - fears of the economic chaos that would follow if
we fail to reduce the deficit.''
   ``It is the best agreement that can be legislated now,'' Bush
said of the compromise.
   Bush's address from the Oval Office was nationally televised,
but his message was primarily aimed 16 blocks away: at Congress,
where an initial vote on the plan may be held as early as Thursday.
   Although the package generally has support among Democrats,
lawmakers from Bush's own party - particularly in the House - have
balked at its tax provisions. Bush himself had to abandon his ``no
new taxes'' pledge in the face of the growing deficit.
   ``I'm not, and I know you're not, a fan of tax increases,'' Bush
said. ``But if there have to be tax measures, they should allow the
economy to grow, they should not turn us back to higher income tax
rates and they should be fair.
   ``Everyone who can should contribute something. And no one
should have to contribute beyond their fair share.''
   Bush pointed out that the agreement had been hammered out by a
bipartisan group. ``The Democratic and Republican leadership
tonight all speak with once voice,'' he said, and urged people to
tell their congressmen they support the package.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, joined Bush in
urging passage of the fragile package, saying the future of the
nation ``is more important than partisan differences.''
   In a televised response, Mitchell acknowledged that Democrats
and Republicans had ``deep differences over values and priorities''
that delayed an agreement for months. The Democratic leader called
the agreement ``imperfect,'' and warned that the compromise budget
cuts and tax increases will demand ``sacrifice from all
Americans.''
   ``But, if enacted, it holds the promise of restoring a sound
economy, from which all Americans will benefit,'' Mitchell said.
   ``Everybody who can should contribute something,'' Bush said.
``Everybody will bear a small burden. But if we succeed, everybody
will have small burden lifted.''
   The alternative, Bush said, is recession.
   Wavering Republican lawmakers had told Bush earlier in the day
that the plan was in trouble, and that a presidential address to
the nation endorsing the package might be helpful if he expected
GOP support for the package with congressional elections just a
month away.
   Bush also planned to push for the three-day-old package, which
the White House negotiated with congressional leaders, in a series
of upcoming speeches around the nation.
   The budget package would raise taxes on gasoline, alcohol,
cigarettes, boats and furs while trimming benefits to farmers and
Medicare recipients. It also would reduce tax deductions for people
who earn more than $100,000.
   Bush earlier Tuesday had pressed his case with skeptical and
wavering House Republicans.
   He seemed to be making some headway and by late Tuesday, House
GOP leaders were beginning to feel more optimistic about their
chances of rounding up support from most of their members. ``We've
made significant progress,'' said House Minority Leader Robert
Michel, R-Ill.
   One opponent, Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn., agreed, saying, ``I'd
guess right now it would be narrowly defeated. By tomorrow, it
would be narrowly passed. ... People are being moved, one-by-one.''
   Bush said the budget deficit was ``a problem that has lingered
and dogged and vexed this country for far too long.''
   Likening the budget crisis to the Persian Gulf stalemate, Bush
said ``our nation is standing together against Saddam Hussein's
aggression ' while at home ``another threat, a cancer, is gnawing
away at our nation's health.''
   The president said that ending deficit spending was simple
``common sense.''
   ``No nation can continue to do business the way the federal
government has been operating and survive,'' he said.
   ``When you get a bill, that bill must be paid,'' he said.
   Bush said that the plan was not ``a magic act'' but contained
true deficit savings and would put the nation on the path toward
lower interest rates and a balanced budget.
   ``Everyone will bear a small burden but if we succeed, every
American will have a large burden lifted,'' he said.

<HEAD>Princeton Scientists Report Fusion Reactor Can Break `Break-Even'
Milestone</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH NEFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Physicists at Princeton University say they
have reached a milestone toward commercial use of the power packed
in a hydrogen bomb - a fusion reactor capable of producing as much
energy as it consumes.
   Scientists say the breakthrough allows them to move toward
developing fusion as an alternative energy to coal and nuclear
power plants.
   However, they cautioned that the project, which has already
spanned 15 years and cost $1 billion, faces several major hurdles,
including determining how to extract the energy from the reactor.
   Scientists said Tuesday that the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor in
Princeton could reach the ``break even'' point sometime after 1993,
but warned that commercial use remains decades away.
   The researchers, at the Princeton Plasma Physics Research
Laboratory, have combined atoms of a heavy form of hydrogen called
deuterium to form helium and energy.
   The next step, which the researchers hope to achieve in 1993,
would use deuterium and a radioactive form of hydrogen called
tritium to generate large amounts of energy in the Tokamak reactor.
   A hydrogen bomb uses the same reaction to cause mass
destruction.
   Dennis Manos, principle research physicist at the Princeton
labs, said the reactor would eventually be able to generate 10
million watts of power a day.
   Tokamak has attained 50,000 watts and a record temperature of
400 million degrees centigrade with the deuterium mixture, he said.
   ``It's step one, the first real threshold you have to get across
to get an engineering device whose ultimate objective is to produce
much more energy than you put in,'' said Robert Sachs, a physics
professor at the University of Chicago.
   The Atomic Age began at the University of Chicago in 1942 with
the creation of the first self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction.
   Fusion creates energy by combining two hydrogen atoms into a
heavier helium atom. It differs from nuclear fission, which powers
conventional nuclear plants by splitting heavy atoms into smaller
pieces.
   Proponents say fusion eliminates the danger of reacto
meltdowns, produces less radioactive waste and is produced from a
readily available source - hydrogen.
   ``It is a potentially safer technology, but it has a long way to
go when you compare it with existing commercial fission
technology,'' Manos said.
   The Soviet Union, the United States, Japan and the European
Economic Community hope to develop a test reactor sometime after
the year 2000, he said.
   But there are other obstacles.
   ``How to extract the energy from the reactor in a useful way is
an engineering question no one has yet answered,'' Sachs said.

   Here is the text of the Democratic response to
President Bush's televised address to the nation Tuesday night,
delivered by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I speak tonight not for the Democratic Party but for America's
future.
   For more than a decade the United States has endured budget
deficits that sap our economic strength. When you have a deficit
there are only two things you can do; cut spending or increase
revenue. This agreement does both.
   It cuts spending, military and domestic. It raises taxes.
   The President has asked you to support the budget agreement. The
democratic leadership in Congress joins in that appeal. We
recognize that this budget demands sacrifice from all Americans.
   But if enacted, it holds the promise of restoring a sound
economy from which all Americans will benefit.
   The agreement is a compromise. It's not what the President,
working alone, would have preferred. It's not what we Democrats,
working on our own, would have produced. Neither side got all it
wanted.
   And many are asking, ``Why did it take so long?'' The answer is
simple. What delayed us for months is what has divided us for
years. Democrats and Republicans have deep differences over values
and priorities.
   We prefer a budget that asks more from the wealthy and less from
the elderly. But when the President asked us to join in rewriting
his budget we agreed, because the nation is more important than
partisan differences.
   When the President asked us to help work out a compromise he got
our help. Now we hope that members of his party, the Republican
members of Congress, will also set aside partisan differences, as
we have done, and join us in doing what's right for our country.
   Two centuries ago the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia
was drawing to a close. The delegates had quarreled for months. Now
they were to vote on a difficult compromise. Benjamin Franklin, 81
years old, rose slowly and said to his fellow delegates, ``I
confess that there are several parts of this Constitution which I
do not approve. But I doubt whether any other convention may be
able to make a better constitution, for when you assemble men to
have the advantage of their joint wisdom you inevitably assemble
all their prejudices, their passions, their errors of opinion,
their local interests, their selfish views. From such an assembly,
can a perfect production be expected? I consent to this
Constitution because I expect no better and because I am not sure
it is not the best.''
   Of course, no budget can be compared with the Constitution, but
Franklin's point applies. Every human work is imperfect and that's
certainly true of this budget.
   But it's also true that for America's economic future, we have
to pass it. With your help, we will.
   Thank you and good night.

   The justice of gender in the locker room was
supposed to be settled 12 years ago. Courts gave women
sportswriters equal access to dressing rooms so they would have the
same chance as men to do their jobs.
   Yet the issue of women in the clubhouse keeps making headlines.
Denise Tom of USA Today was barred Monday night from the Cincinnati
Bengals' dressing room hours after the National Football League
named an investigator to look into charges of harassment of Boston
Herald reporter Lisa Olson.
   ``We go into locker rooms not because we want to, but because we
have to,'' wrote Christine Brennan, a sportswriter with The
Washington Post and one of pioneers who fought for equal access.
   ``It's not exciting or sexy or tantalizing. It's cramped and
steamy and messy,'' she said. ``But most stadiums are too old to
have a room big enough for all reporters and all players to meet
for interviews. So the only place we can do our jobs is the locker
room.''
   About 500 women work as sports journalists, according to the
Association for Women in Sports Media. They have the same right to
do their jobs as women who drive trucks, mine coal, doctor the sick
or practice law.
   Precedent was established in 1978 when a federal judge ruled
Melissa Ludtke, a reporter for Sports Illustrated, could go into
the New York Yankees' clubhouse. Barring her violated her
constitutional right to equal protection under the law, Judge
Constance Baker Motley ruled.
   In 1985, Commissioner Pete Rozelle ordered all NFL teams to
treat reporters equally in interview areas, regardless of sex. Some
teams like the Dallas Cowboys set up rooms where players could be
interviewed; others handed out bathrobes or towels to players.
   Major league baseball provided equal access that year, too.
Basketball and hockey already had set open policies. The National
Basketball Association schools rookies on how to deal with the
media - male and female.
   But the going has hardly been easy for women in the world of
jocks, where clubhouses smell of sweat and salve and soiled
athletic supporters but where reporters have to go for interviews.
   In 1986, Susan Fornoff of The Sacramento (Calif.) Bee received a
live rat wrapped in a shoe box from Dave Kingman of the Oakland
Athletics. Joan Ryan of The Orlando (Fla.) Sentinel once told of a
player from a defunct football league who ran a razor up her leg as
she conducted an interview.
   Earlier this year, intern Jennifer Frey of the Detroit Free
Press was told by Detroit Tigers pitcher Jack Morris: ``I don't
talk to people when I'm naked, especially women, unless they're on
top of me or I'm on top of them.''
   When the newspaper complained, Tigers president Bo Schembechler
wrote back: ``No female member of my family would be inside a men's
locker room regardless of their job description.''
   Now, former Watergate investigator Philip Heymann has been named
to look into charges that New England Patriots' players exposed
themselves and made suggestive remarks to Olson on Sept. 17. The
Herald reporter called it ``nothing less than mind rape.''
   Tight end Zeke Mowatt was fined $2,000 and apologized, but
denied making lewd gestures or comments. He said the only thing he
told her was: ``You are not writing; you are looking.''
   Patriots owner Victor Kiam at first called the locker room
incident ``a flyspeck in the ocean,'' then told the paper it was
``asking for trouble'' by sending a female reporter into a football
dressing room. He was also quoted as calling her ``a classic
bitch.''
   After the National Organization for Women called from a boycott
of Remington Products Inc., which Kiam owns, he took out full-page
ads in The New York Times, the Boston Herald and The Boston Globe.
   Kiam apologized and said ``there's no excuse for what
happened.'' He also denied calling her a name.
   She was booed at Sunday's game.
   In Seattle, Bengals Coach Sam Wyche kept USA Today's Tom from
the locker room because ``our guys don't want a woman to walk into
a situation like that.'' In the past, Wyche has closed the locker
room to all reporters in violation of NFL policy and was fined last
year.
   Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Wyche faces another fine for
not letting a woman into the locker room.
   ``If he wants to make a stand on he issue, he can make a stand
on the issue. He will be fined very heavily for it. If he wants to
quit, he can quit, because he has been warned twice already,''
Tagliabue said.
   Tuesday's edition of USA Today contained a column by
sportswriter Rachel Shuster aimed at NFL brass. She concluded:
``We've earned our place in the locker room. Now, just give us some
respect, and we'll do our jobs and let you do yours.''

   Divers on Tuesday recovered an eighth

Lake County Undersheriff Keith Clausen.
   The names of the other victims - two men and a woman - will not

   Investigators continued to pull parts of the Lockheed P2V
Harpoon out of the mud and murky shallow water of Clear Lake, where
it crashed after intruding on a seaplane air show and giving an
ill-fated aerobatics display.
   The cause of the crash remains under investigation, but
preliminary evidence indicates a heavy load of fuel and passengers
combined with high temperatures may have caused the plane to stall,
officials said.

to support a $500 billion package of tax increases and spending
cuts that demands sacrifice from all. ``Everyone who can should

we fail to reduce the deficit.''
   ``It is the best agreement that can be legislated now,'' Bush
said of the compromise. ``This deficit reduction agreement is
tough, and so are the times.''
   Bush's address from the Oval Office was nationally televised,
but his message was primarily aimed 16 blocks away: at Congress,
where an initial vote on the plan may be held as early as Thursday.
   Although the package generally has support among Democrats,
lawmakers from Bush's own party - particularly in the House - have
balked at its tax provisions. Bush himself had to abandon his ``no
new taxes'' pledge in the face of the growing deficit.
   ``I'm not, and I know you're not, a fan of tax increases,'' Bush
said. ``But if there have to be tax measures, they should allow the
economy to grow, they should not turn us back to higher income tax
rates and they should be fair.
   ``Everyone who can should contribute something. And no one
should have to contribute beyond their fair share.''
   Bush pointed out that the agreement had been hammered out by a
bipartisan group. ``The Democratic and Republican leadership
tonight all speak with once voice,'' he said, and he urged people
to tell their congressmen they support the package.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, joined Bush in
urging passage of the fragile package, saying the future of the
nation ``is more important than partisan differences.''
   In a televised response, Mitchell acknowledged that Democrats
and Republicans had ``deep differences over values and priorities''
that delayed an agreement for months. The Democratic leader called
the agreement ``imperfect,'' and warned that the compromise budget
cuts and tax increases will demand ``sacrifice from all
Americans.''
   ``But, if enacted, it holds the promise of restoring a sound
economy, from which all Americans will benefit,'' Mitchell said.
   ``Everybody who can should contribute something,'' Bush said.
``Everyone will bear a small burden. But if we succeed, every
American will have a large burden lifted.''
   The alternative, Bush said, is recession.
   Wavering Republican lawmakers had told Bush earlier in the day
that the plan was in trouble, and that a presidential address to
the nation endorsing the package might be helpful if he expected
GOP support for the package with congressional elections just a
month away.
   Bush also planned to push for the three-day-old package, which
the White House negotiated with congressional leaders, in a series
of upcoming speeches around the nation.
   The budget package would raise taxes on gasoline, alcohol,
cigarettes, boats and furs while trimming benefits to farmers and
Medicare recipients. It also would reduce tax deductions for people
who earn more than $100,000.
   Bush earlier Tuesday had pressed his case with skeptical and
wavering House Republicans.
   He seemed to be making some headway and by late Tuesday, House
GOP leaders were beginning to feel more optimistic about their
chances of rounding up support from most of their members. ``We've
made significant progress,'' said House Minority Leader Robert
Michel, R-Ill.
   One opponent, Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn., agreed, saying, ``I'd
guess right now it would be narrowly defeated. By tomorrow, it
would be narrowly passed. ... People are being moved, one-by-one.''
   Bush said the budget deficit was ``a problem that has lingered
and dogged and vexed this country for far too long.''
   Likening the budget crisis to the Persian Gulf stalemate, Bush
said ``our nation is standing together against Saddam Hussein's
aggression ' while at home ``another threat, a cancer, is gnawing
away at our nation's health.''
   The president said that ending deficit spending was simple
``common sense.''
   ``No nation can continue to do business the way the federal
government has been operating and survive,'' he said.
   ``When you get a bill, that bill must be paid,'' he said.
   Bush said that the plan was not ``a magic act'' but contained
true deficit savings and would put the nation on the path toward
lower interest rates and a balanced budget.
   A congressional study released Tuesday showed that the poor
would be hit hardest by the package, the rich would feel its
increases the least. The increased taxes and reduced benefits would
take an average 2 percent of the earnings of Americans with the
lowest incomes, according to the survey by the House Ways and Means
Committee.

   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
reinforcing an appeal by President Bush, Tuesday urged passage of a
$500 billion, five-year deficit-cutting package he said could
restore a sound economy.
   Mitchell, in a televised appeal that followed Bush's address to
the nation, said the two parties still have ``deep differences over
values and priorities'' which delayed an agreement for months, but
``the nation is more important than partisan differences.''
   The bi-partisan budget proposal ``holds the promise of restoring
a sound economy, from which all Americans will benefit,'' Mitchell
said.
   ``We prefer a budget that asks more from the wealthy and less
from the elderly,'' Mitchell said.
   But when Bush asked congressional Democrats to help rewrite his
budget, Mitchell said, ``he got our help.''
   Mitchell called the package ``imperfect,'' and said ``neither
side got what it wanted.''
   And he added, ``We recognize that this budget demands sacrifice
from all Americans.''
   Wavering Republican lawmakers had told Bush earlier in the day
that the plan was in trouble, and that a presidential address to
the nation endorsing the package might be helpful if he expected
GOP support for the package with congressional elections just a
month away.
   The budget package would raise axes on gasoline, alcohol,
cigarettes, boats and furs while trimming benefits to farmers and
Medicare recipients. It also would reduce tax deductions for people
who earn more than $100,000.
   Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., chairman of the House Republican
Conference, praised Bush but attacked Mitchell.
   ``The president stepped up to the plate tonight and hit the ball
clear out of the park,'' he said. ``His appeal to the American
people will make the difference.''
   He called the upcoming votes on the package the ``most important
... of the Bush presidency thus far'' and predicted a last-minute
``surge of support'' will win passage of the compromise.
   In attacking Mitchell, Lewis took issue with the majority
leader's remark that Democrats wanted higher taxes from the wealthy
and less from the elderly.
   The Democrats sought increases on high-income taxpayers as the
price for Bush's plan to reduce capital gains. Both measures were
dropped from the package.
   ``George Mitchell's partisan shots at capital gains in his
response was most disturbing,'' Lewis said. ``He, more than anyone
else, is responsible for the death of capital gains in the budget
package.''

<TEXT>
   The two Germanys ended 45 years of division with a
blaze of fireworks and the pealing of church bells Wednesday,
declaring the creation of a new German nation in the heart of
Europe.
   Near the ruins of Hitler's citadel in the city that symbolized
the Cold War division of Europe, the German flag was hoisted to
crown the dramatic rush to unify a Germany divided by World War II
and the Communist Berlin Wall.
   Rockets burst in the sky over Berlin, illuminating the
war-scarred Reichstag building and the Brandenburg Gate. The shower
of fireworks also lighted the upturned faces of thousands of
Germans, united in peace but troubled by the political and economic
problems facing a united Germany.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, President Richard von Weizsaecker and
former leader Willy Brandt stood in the glare of floodlights at the
Reichstag and joined in singing the national anthem as a vast party
occurred across the land of 78 million residents. Millions of
Germans and a watching world joined the ceremony by television.
   Wednesday was declared a national holiday, but late Tuesday
police in Goettingen, 66 miles south of Hanover, reported 1,000
leftist protesters opposed to unification rampaged through the
city. Authorities said the radicals broke store windows and chanted
``Never Again Germany!'' and ``Nazis out!''
   In Berlin, police detained seven people who were caught with
paint and gas pistols. Another man was arrested in the Kreuzberg
district after a policeman was stabbed in the arm during a scuffle
between police and about 500 youthful demonstrators.
   In the northern port of Rostock, authorities evacuated 23 Soviet
Jews from a refugee center because of fears the center could become
a target of rightist radicals. No incidents were reported.
   At least four people were injured and more than 10 arrested in
scuffles between police and demonstrators in Schwerin, where some
celebrated unification with the Nazi ``Sieg-Heil'' salute,
witnesses said. Police also reported clashes with youths in Leipzig
and Hamburg.
   The ceremony marked return of a united Germany built on the
ruins of Adolf Hitler's defeat in World War II and the end of Cold
War antagonism that split Europe into competing blocs led by the
United States and the Soviet Union.
   It came less than 11 months after the Berlin Wall was opened
Nov. 9, 1989, by a tide of democracy that swept away Communist
regimes across Eastern Europe.
   Fourteen schoolchildren from the former East and West Germanys
carried the huge, 72-square-yard German flag and hoisted it up the
132-foot-tall mast in front of the Reichstag.
   Hundreds of thousands of people, waving German flags, crowded
along the Unten den Linden thoroughfare and June 17th Street that
once were cut by the Berlin Wall.
   Fireworks exploded over the Reichstag as a replica of the
Liberty Bell, donated to Berlin by the American people, pealed.
   ``Germany is one again, Germany is sovereign,'' said German
television. ``Forty-five years after the unconditional surrender''
of Nazi Germany ``the two German states are united.''
   Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere said of unification minutes
before midnight, ``What for most people had been only a dream has
become reality.''
   Then, Kurt Masur directed Beethoven's Ninth Sympony as East
Germany ceased to exist to the deep chords of the ``Ode to Joy.''
   City authorities had banned demonstrations near the Brandenburg
Gate, the 200-year-old monument that was a focus of celebrations.
   The broad thoroughfares around the Brandenburg Gate were
thronged with tens of thousands of people hours before the historic
occasion, and vendors sold food, drinks and souvenirs.
   Dixieland jazz, street musicians and organ-grinders played music
that rang in the chilly fall air.
   Searchlight beams waved in a cloudless sky, and a tall crane
dangled an old East German ``Trabi'' car 50 feet in the air just
south of the massive stone gate.
   About 200 leftist radicals lined a police barrier outside the
Schauspielhaus, blowing whistles and jeering at dignitaries
arriving for a formal state ceremony hosted by the departing East
German government.
   The radicals chanted ``Germany, drop dead!''
   Kohl, 60, said in a statement to the Frankfurter Allgemeine
newspaper that the new Germany will help stabilize Europe, and that
it would not be a ``restless Reich'' like Nazi Germany, which
plunged Europe into its most disastrous war.
   The unification of Germany is a ``European, indeed a world event
of historic rank,'' Kohl said.
   Several German newspapers published the approved verse of the
national anthem to be sung in unified Germany - not the old
``Deutschland Ueber Alles'' verse - but the third verse, which
starts: ``Unity and Justice and Freedom for the German
fatherland.''
   The verse admonishes Germany to ``bloom,'' not to be ``above
all,'' the old mission that frightens some Europeans.
   Only a year ago the rush toward unity was barely starting. East
Germans demonstrated for political freedoms and the right to leave
their country. The Communist government opened the Berlin Wall last
fall but was swept away anyway in a peaceful popular revolution.
   East Germans began to demonstrate for unification, which was
taken up by Kohl and his government, and eventually approved by
Moscow and the Allies.
   The Soviets agreed to let united Germany remain in NATO and to
remove their troops by the end of 1994, although Germany is paying
Moscow $9.5 billion to finance the withdrawal. The Allies will keep
troops in West Berlin until the Soviets leave.
   The last formal steps to clear the way for unity were taken
mostly by the foreign powers who defeated Nazi Germany and retained
legal powers as occupiers in Berlin.
   In New York on Monday, President Bush and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze were present for the signing of a
declaration of a suspension of the Allies' special powers.
   On Tuesday morning, Allied generals from the United States,
Britain and France signed a letter ceding their powers. Buglers
played as the three flags were lowered for the last time at the
Allied headquarters.
   Maj. Gen. Raymond E. Haddock of the United States, Maj. Gen.
Robert J.S. Corbett of Britain and Maj. Gen. Francois Cann of
France then went to West Berlin City Hall to deliver the letter to
Mayor Walter Momper.
   ``We three commandants will shortly leave Berlin and we shall
carry with us a feeling of satisfaction that our collective efforts
have been successful. The Berlin which we leave will be whole and
free,'' their letter said.
   Kohl said in a statement broadcast on television that Germany
thanked the Western allies for their support, and he also praised
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, saying: ``He recognized the
nations' right to pursue their own path. Without this decision, we
would not have experienced the day of German unity so soon.''
   Much work needs to be done, Kohl said.
   ``Particularly at this moment, we Germans must show solidarity
toward one another,'' the chancellor said. ``A difficult path lies
before us.''
   The mighty West German economy, with a gross national product
last year of $1.4 trillion, has to rebuild East Germany, which had
one-fourth of West German's population but an economy only
one-eighth as big in 1989 and failing fast in its last days.
   East Germany's work force of 9 million had 360,000 out of work
in August, and 1.4 million were on so-called ``short work'' with an
uncertain future.

   Scientists say the humble potato may offer the
world a second chance to support a population that is outracing its
capacity to feed itself.
   The first chance was the ``Green Revolution,'' which started in
the 1960s and kept millions alive by developing high-yield strains
of rice, corn and wheat, but never fully lived up to its promise.
   At a conference here Monday and Tuesday on ``Feeding the Global
Village,'' the potato was held up as a potential lifesaver for the
half of the world that is hungry. It was called a ``power food,''
packed with protein and vitamin C, potassium, iron and magnesium.
   The conference was told the potato is becoming a vital source of
nutrition around the world. It is grown these days in 126
countries, from the Arctic and to the tropics, atop mountains and
in the desert.
   Even in China, the world's rice bowl, it is not uncommon to see
a youngster walking along, eating a potato like an apple.
   China has replaced Poland as the world's second largest grower
of potatoes.
   The Soviet Union is still first, but this year there are fears
that a breakdown in the harvesting system will deprive millions of
a crucial part of the Russian diet. A bumper crop is rotting in the
fields.
   India is in fourth place in potato production and the United
States is fifth.
   Americans eat five billion pounds of french fries a year, said
Robert Mercer, an official of the Potato Board, which represents
the industry, and the Orient - where they're known as ``American
fries'' - is importing 800 million pounds of frozen raw potatoes a
year.
   The potato's foremost champion at the conference was researcher
Richard Sawyer, who says his interest was sharpened when he
subsisted on stolen seed potatoes while a prisoner of war in Nazi
Germany. He is founder and director general of the International
Potato Center in Lima, Peru.
   Sawyer predicted the potato will launch a second agricultural
revolution, comparable to the ``Green Revolution.''
   He said this will buy time for the world to put population
growth in harmony with food production.
   Potatoes are usually grown from a tuber chunk containing buds or
``eyes.'' Research at the Potato Center made it possible to grow
them from seeds from the plant's flower, Sawyer reported, reducing
the high costs of seed material that made the potato a luxury
vegetable in much of the world.
   ``I can hold in my hand enough true potato seed to plant a
hectare (2.471 acres), whereas it takes 4,000 pounds or more of
tubers to plant the same area,'' Sawyer said.
   Meantime, he said, scientists have only begun to explore new
varieties. At the Peru center, he said, germplasm - seed material -
for about 175 varieties have been collected.
   ``I am confident we have the ability to develop varieties which
would have resistances to pests and diseases and eliminate 90
percent of the present use of chemicals on production,'' Sawyer
said. ``What we don't have in the germplasm collection we will
probably be able to produce through the new tools of
biotechnology.''
   Robert E. Rhoades, a researcher in the Philippines, said farmers
in the tropics can harvest potatoes within 50 days of planting, a
third of the time it takes in colder climates. Wherever
temperatures drop at night, potatoes can be grown, he said.
   ``The potato yields more nutritious food quicker on less land
and under harsher climates than any major crop,'' Rhoades said.
   Since they grow so fast, they can be planted in fields that are
used at other times of the year to raise rice or wheat, he said.
   Research has produced plants resistant to the blight that in
1845 attacked the potato fields of Ireland and northern Europe and
caused a third of Ireland's population of three million to starve
to death and another third to emigrate, many to America.

   Former newspaperman Jim Minter handily
turned back impeached federal judge Alcee Hastings' bid for a
political comeback Tuesday, capturing the Democratic nomination for
Florida's secretary of state.
   With 4,234 of 4,528 precincts, or 94 percent, reporting
unofficial returns, Minter had 273,324 votes, or 69 percent, to
Hastings' 123,145 votes, or 31 percent.
   Preliminary counts Tuesday indicated just 13 percent of the
state's 5.9 million registered voters cast ballots, elections
officials said. That translates to just 7.5 percent of the state's
voting-age population of 10.3 million.
   In the lone U.S. House runoff, former Harris Corp. space-defense
lobbyist William Tolley won the GOP nomination a second time in the
11th District, defeating former state Senate president John Vogt.
Tolley will face Jim Bacchus, an Orlando attorney who captured the
Democratic nomination without opposition.
   The seat was vacated by six-term Democrat Bill Nelson, who lost
a bid for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Nelson easily
defeated Tolley in the 1988 general election, but the district has
a GOP majority.
   With all 247 precincts reporting unofficial returns, Tolley had
20,508 votes, or 57 percent, to 15,673 votes, or 43 percent, for
Vogt, who switched from the Democratic Party after leaving the
state Senate.
   In a Democratic legislative runoff, state Sen. Don Childers
blamed his anti-abortion views for costing him the seat he held for
16 years.
   Anti-abortion militant Randall Terry campaigned for Childers,
who lost to Boca Raton attorney Robert Wexler by about 3-to-1.
Wexler captured the Palm Beach County district outright, because no
Republicans ran.
   Minter will face well-financed Republican incumbent Jim Smith,
who served two terms as a Democratic attorney general, in the Nov.
6 election.
   ``Now it's time for issue politics,'' Minter said. ``You don't
need a million dollars if you've got a million-dollar idea.''
   Minter has run a low-budget campaign - raising under $13,000 -
and is stressing campaign finance reform. He credited his strategy
of concentrating on local activists, environmentalists and other
``good government'' interests for his victory.
   Hastings said he would return to his Miami law practice and help
Democrats win in November - but he didn't rule out a return to
politics.
   ``Neither Florida nor the nation has heard the last of me,''
Hastings said. ``I will continue to fight for the things I believe
in. I really feel my loss in this race is Florida's loss - I feel I
still have a contribution to make.''

   Plice said they arrested two men and a woman
Tuesday near Stonehenge in southern England under the Prevention of
Terrorism Act.
   News reports said the three were Irish and were being questioned
about the Irish Republican Army's July 30 killing of legislator Sir
Ian Gow and other IRA attacks. Police refused to comment, nor did
they identify the three arrested.
   The British domestic news agency Press Association reported
without attribution that the men were spotted in a car sought by
anti-terrorist squad detectives. It said the auto was in a parking
lot near the prehistoric Stonehenge monument on Salisbury Plan in
Wiltshire, 75 miles west of London.
   It said the woman was arrested in the same police operation near
Stonehenge.
   Gow, 53, was killed when a bomb planted under his car exploded
as he got into the vehicle outside his home at Hankham, about 50
miles south of London. The IRA claimed responsibility.
   Gow, a member of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's ruling
Conservative Party, was chairman of the House of Commons' Northern
Ireland Committee and a close personal friend of Mrs. Thatcher and
her husband Denis. The committee discusses Northern Ireland affairs
but has no power over legislation.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting British rule in
Northern Ireland. It wants to unite the Protestant-dominated
province with the 95 percent Catholic Republic of Ireland under
socialist rule.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Air Force veterans involved in the spraying
of Agent Orange and other herbicides during the Vietnam War are as
healthy as those not exposed to the chemicals, Air Force
researchers reported.
   Two studies, reported in the Oct. 10th edition of the Journal of
the American Medical Association, compared the mortality rates and
physical health of veterans of Operation Ranch Hand, the unit
responsible for the sprayings, and Air Force veterans who served
concurrently in other units.
   ``An evaluation of cumulative and all-causing mortality revealed
no statistically significant differences between Ranch Hands and
comparison subjects,'' said Air Force Col. William H. Wolfe,
co-author of the studies.
   The first study found a significant increase in digestive system
disease deaths among the veterans, but most were linked to
alcoholism, not to herbicidal exposure.
   A second study, comparing the physical health of 995 Ranch Hand
veterans to 1,299 other veterans, found that the two groups
reported similar health problems. The study was based on physical
exams administered in 1982, 1985 and 1987.
   The researchers reported that the few associations found between
physical health and exposure to the herbicides were weak and
inconsistent.
   ``We are left with the interpretation that the few positive
findings are not supportive of a hypothesis of adverse health
effects in Ranch Hands,'' the authors wrote in the journal.

   U.S. Marine bomb technicians detonated a
letter bomb in the parking lot of the Dumfries Post Office on
Tuesday after a letter carrier reported the package as suspicious,
officials said.
   The unidentified letter carrier was making a routine stop at a
collection box when the appearance of the package led her to think
it was a bomb, said Paul Giroux, a spokesman for the Washington
Division of the Postal Inspection Service. Dumfries is south of
Washington, D.C.
   He declined to reveal what exactly caught her eye, saying the
investigation was still going on.
   ``She was exceedingly very good at picking up the signs that the
normal individual picking it up might otherwise have overseen,''
Giroux said. ``It did save somebody receiving this package.''
   He said her identity is being withheld to protect her privacy
while authorities assess whether she needs assistance in dealing
with the emotional repercussions of knowing she handled a bomb.
   The letter carrier hand carried the bomb back to the Dumfries
Post Office nearby and notified the postmaster, said Kim Chinn,
Prince William County Police spokeswoman.
   Officils notified the county police, the postal inspection
service and a bomb squad from the nearby Quantico Marine Base. The
small box was then X-rayed, which identified it as an explosive,
Giroux said.
   Several metal postal carts were placed around the package, and
it was detonated it in the parking lot, Giroux said. No one was
injured, although Giroux said the intended victim would have been
``quite devastated'' if it was opened as intended.
   Officials declined to release information concerning the
intended victim or the sender. Giroux said authorities have
positive leads.

   The challengers President Bush most wants to
see elected to the Senate were among the first to break with the
president on the budget agreement he negotiated with Congress.
   ``Muggers in pin-striped suits,'' cried Rep. Lynn Martin, the
Republican trying to unseat Democratic Sen. Paul Simon. ``They're
back at your pocketbook again.''
   ``Throw out the leadership of Congress,'' said Martin,
apparently excluding Bush from the gang of ``muggers.''
   The plan would enact permanent tax increases while leaving
spending cuts up to Congress to enact in the future, complained
Rep. Newt Gingrich, one of Congress' leading conservatives.
Gingrich, R-Ga., also was upset that the plan did not contain
enough measures to help businesses.
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush says he'd consider going on
television to ask the public to accept the $500 billion
deficit-cutting plan, a boost congressional leaders may need to win
enough support from worried lawmakers.
   Bush and leaders of the House and Senate continue searching for
votes today for the package, which was unveiled Sunday. In its
two-day life span, the plan has drawn barbs from lawmakers,
Democrats and Republicans, wary of voting for a record amount of
tax increases and spending cuts in an election year.
   ``Everybody knew this deficit-reduction agreement was an ugly
duckling,'' said Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate
Budget Committee. ``Nobody expected it to sprout wings and fly like
a swan.''
   But Bush put an optimistic face on prospects of approval. ``It
will all work out. Everybody will do what's right,'' he told
reporters.

   WEST BERLIN (AP) - East and West fade out today as official ways
to describe Germany.
   Old military occupiers' power will be handed over and scores of
foreign diplomats will lose their host country.
   The new united Germany of almost 78 million people arising at
midnight will have to rely on considerable strengths to cope with
difficult tasks.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl told a convention of his
Christian Democratic Union in Hamburg on Monday that Germany now
faces three immense tasks: the reconstruction of formerly Communist
East Germany, the completion of European integration and the taking
on of a greater international role.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Women who took at least two alcoholic drinks a
day were three times more likely than abstainers to die before age
65, a study found.
   The difference was nearly two-fold for men in the study, which
was based on a national sample of people who died in 1986.
   For women, 40.7 percent of so-called heavier drinkers died
before age 65 versus 13.2 percent of abstainers. For men, the
figures were 42.3 percent versus 22.4 percent.
   Even people classified as moderate or light drinkers showed
higher death rates than the abstainers.

   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - The strategically located Korean
peninsula is in the vortex of rapidly developing new relationships
that may change the political landscape of Northeast Asia.
   For he first time since the end of World War II, countries that
have been bitter adversaries and battleground enemies are talking
to one another. Delicate relations are being slowly, cautiously
realigned.
   Northeast Asia is unique in that it engages the vital interests
of four of the world's great powers: the United States, the Soviet
Union, Japan and China. The tense and bitterly divided Korean
peninsula sits at its geographical heart.
   All four countries are involved in, and will be affected by,
changes in Korea. All four governments have an interest in security
and peace on the peninsula and all four have economic reasons for
wanting to encourage friendly ties between North and South Korea.

<HEAD>`The Woodwright's Shop' Turns 10</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's not too early to begin celebrating PBS'
10th season of ``The Woodwright's Shop,'' where host Roy Underhill
illustrates the ancient craft of woodworking with traditional
American tools and a dry, hip wit.
   No power tools, please.
   ``It's the difference between playing a Stradivarius and a
synthesizer,'' Underhill said. ``Both of them get the work done,
but there's a lot of difference in the playing and what you end up
with. The product is the process.''
   The 10th season premiere Oct. 20 features a rocking horse
modeled on those of Germany's Franconia region, where Underhill
shot two other shows that feature the district's traditional
architecture and craftsmanship.
   Other woodworking projects featured will include traditional ash
wood basketry, the walking stick flute, a revolving bookcase, a
Colonial garden gate, a musical Balinese whirligig, a kayak, and
wooden shoes.
   And Underhill closes out the season with his favorite thing to
make, a light, wood garden rake split from white oak and hickory.
   Asked the origin of his love for woodworking with traditional
hand tools, Underhill said, ``I grew up in the mountains of
Washington, D.C. It's known as Capitol Hill now, but back then
there was no electricity, no roads.''
   That's probably not true, Roy.
   He acknowledged a boyhood with ``family connections to the
Smithsonian Institution'' and its collection of Americana. But he
insisted there were woods and deer inside the city limits of his
boyhood a couple of decades ago.
   He also acknowledged an undergraduate degree in theater
directing from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
   That was followed by ``some adventurous homesteading in the
mountains of New Mexico,'' and the ensuing graduate degree in
traditional woodworking from Duke University's forestry school, he
said.
   He came back from New Mexico, he said, to make old-style wooden
shovels and rakes, but quickly found he couldn't make them fast
enough to earn a living at it.
   ``I was really faced with having to give it up and do something
else, or compromise, and start making things by some kind of
mechanical method that I really didn't want to do,'' he said.
   So he taught people how to do woodwork. And he demonstrated his
craft before groups. ``It was slowly dawning on that that if I
showed people how to do it, then I could maintain its integrity.''
   Then he realized that it could work on television. ``The
Woodwright's Shop'' was born.
   Today, Underhill is finishing his fourth woodworking book and
his tenth year as master housewright at Colonial Williamsburg,
where the life of 18th century Virginia is re-created in a living,
working museum.
   ``The job is to build houses the same way, or to discover the
same way that they were built in the 18th century,'' he said. ``We
put people to work with axes, pit saws and oxen.''
   His latest project was the reconstruction of the big Anderson
blacksmith shops. Plans for the ``interpretation'' were based on
archaeology, library research, and studies of simiar, surviving
buildings.
   ``It's detective work, putting together the tools, the wood, all
of the evidence,'' he said. ``This is how we learn about how people
lived.''
   One of Underhill's favorite quotations is from ``The
Wheelwright's Shop,'' the 19th century memoirs of an artisan who
said of his craftsmen, ``They were friends with oak and iron, and
the grain in the wood told secrets to them.''
   It's those secrets that speak to Underhill. He reveals them on
his show, patiently working the wood with his craft's traditional
tools. He explores, reveals and connects with something basic and
profound about humankind.
   ``This is the fundamental stuff, part of us since our ancestors
started banging rocks on trees,'' he said. ``It's fundamental to
our language, our culture, our social structure, our engineering.
   ``It's the same thing for a writer to understand Latin, the
roots of the language. The trees haven't changed, a cutting edge
still works the same way. It's almost fundamental to human beings.
It's that kind of inextricable element from our culture.''

   TOUCH OF ORSON, A RARE CUT: The Movie Channel is offering a rare
treat for film buffs Oct. 10 with the national premiere of director
Orson Welles' ``lost cut'' of his classic film noir ``Touch of
Evil.''
   Film historians had doubted that Welles' 105-minute version of
the celebrated 1958 film actually existed. The studio cut is 95
minutes long, and is what most of us have seen at revivals.
   ``Touch of Evil'' is memorable for Welles' obsessive, deep-focus
imagery, his sweaty performance as a bloated, corrupt border cop,
and his unforgettable, uninterrupted, three-minute tracking shot
that backs up the opening credits.
   The cast includes Charlton Heston, Janet Leigh, Marlene
Dietrich, Mercedes McCambride and Joseph Cotten. The score is by
Henry Mancini.
   The Movie Channel follows the film with another Welles feature,
1948's ``Lady from Shanghai.'' It is memorable for Welles' obscure
brogue, his leading lady and then-wife Rita Hayworth, and the
climactic ``hall of mirrors'' finale.

   Rosa Perez and Carlos Peri were building a life
together. He was working construction. They had a nice apartment, a
new baby and a dream of going back to their native Honduras to
live.
   In a few frantic moments, the Happy Land fire changed all that.
Carlos was killed along with 86 other people when a revenge-seeking
arsonist torched the illegal Bronx social club early one Sunday
morning last March.
   Now Rosa's life is lawyers and lawsuits and waiting. And being a
single parent to her son, now 10 months old.
   ``I'm really at a loss without Carlos,'' says Rosa as she
lovingly strokes the boy's head. ``I had to move out of the
apartment we had because I couldn't afford to stay there anymore.''
   ``Sometimes I don't have enough money to buy milk for the
baby,'' the 23-year-old mother says sadly in Spanish. ``When the
baby's father was here and alive, life was not hard, because he was
very good.
   ``But now, it is very hard.''
   Rosa is a plaintiff in one of 93 lawsuits prompted by the March
25 fire. Thirty-seven lawyers represent victims' relatives and five
survivors of the blaze.
   The building's owner, real estate tycoon Alex DiLorenzo III,
faces dozens of suits alleging that he kept the building in
substandard condition and therefore should be financially liable.
   DiLorenzo, in turn, claims that the lease holders, Jay Weiss and
Morris Jaffe, didn't take steps to improve the building as was
their responsibility.
   The city had ordered DiLorenzo to close the building in November
1988. The city issued code violations for operating a social club
without a permit, failing to provide a least two exits on the first
and second floor, and having no emergency lighting, no fire alarms
and no sprinkler system.
   Despite the many violations, the club continued to operate.
   Today, the building is vacant, a burned-out shell that draws the
curious. Occasionally, flowers are placed on the sidewalk in memory
of the victims.
   Julio Gonzalez, 36, is charged with setting the blaze with a
dollar's worth of gasoline after a fight with his former girlfriend
who worked at the club. Most of the victims were trapped on the
second floor.
   Gonzalez was indicted on multiple counts of murder and arson and
is undergoing defense-requested psychiatric evaluation while
awaiting trial.
   One of the plaintiffs' attorneys, Norman Liss, says lawsuits
like Rosa's should be settled quickly.
   ``We feel that this is a case that cries out for justice,'' Liss
says. ``This is a very needy population. We don't want to be
talking about resolution of this case six, seven, 10 years down the
road.''
   Peter Cross, an attorney for DiLorenzo and DiLorenzo's company,
Clarendon Place Corp., agrees that all sides ``are hopeful that
this can be settled without prolonged litigation,'' possibly within
a year.
   Two factors may hinder a speedy resolution: DiLorenzo's personal
finances - it has been reported that he faces numerous foreclosures
and may not be able to pay his debts - and public squabbling
between DiLorenzo and Weiss, the husband of actress Kathleen
Turner.
   DiLorenzo said he never saw the violations issued by the city;
Weiss, whose corporation leased the Happy Land building from
DiLorenzo and then re-rented it to the club's operator, said
DiLorenzo ``ran his buildings into the ground.''
   While some attorneys debate responsibilities, others document
how relatives and loved ones depended on money sent by the victims.
   Carlos Peri worked as a carpenter, mostly in construction,
earning up to $250 a week, according to Susan Karten, Rosa's
attorney.
   He not only supported Rosa and their baby here, he also sent his
father in Honduras $50 a month and sent his sister $100 whenever he
could so she could attend school, she says. In poverty-stricken
Honduras, even those relatively small amounts can go a long way.
   Under New York law, the only person who can receive any money
from a settlement would be the baby, also named Carlos. But under
victim compensation laws, if relatives and loved ones can prove
support, they can file claims, Karten says. Rosa could qualify for
up to $30,000.
   Rosa seems nonplussed by all the lawyer talk.
   She now lives with her mother and sister in the Bronx, where she
says she and the baby both sleep on a sofa. She receives welfare
support for the child totalling about $140 a month.
   Her eyes grow vacant as she talks about Happy Land.
   She remembers she didn't like the club when she had gone there
with Carlos. In fact, she and Carlos had quarreled the night of the
fire. He wanted to go. She didn't.
   ``I told him, `You know I don't like to go there because the men
there just grab you and don't even ask you to dance.'
   ``Then he got angry and reprimanded me and said he wouldn't come
back. But before he left, he played with the baby and he put the
baby in the crib because the baby had fallen asleep in his arms.
   ``And then he said, `Now, I'm leaving. We'll see each other
later.' But I never saw him again.''

<HEAD>Mother's Murder Reflects Painful Life Beneath Rhythms</HEAD>

   Larry Wright wanted a drum set, but his mother
had money only for drugs. So one day he took the subway down to
Times Square, flipped over a plastic bucket and began pounding it
with battered drumsticks.
   He hoped for coins, maybe $10 or $20. But as strangers watched
this sinewy youth whale away - sweat pouring from his shirtless
torso, tiny bits of wood and plastic flying - they proferred
dollars instead of quarters.
   By day's end, the kid from Harlem, who had never taken a music
lesson in his life, had made $300.
   That was about two years ago. He kept coming back, day after
day, playing for hours at a time. He played faster and faster,
built up his callouses and broke dozens of buckets.
   He got some breaks: appearances in music videos by Phil Collins,
Fine Young Cannibals and Jane Child, and a short documentary on
public television.
   This summer Wright, now 15, caught the eye of filmmaker Spike
Lee, who featured him in a Levi's jeans commercial, playing his
bucket and meeting his hero, drummer Max Roach.
   But last month, at his moment of triumph, the drug scene claimed
his mother's life.
   Police say Marilyn Wright, 34, was waiting in line to buy drugs
when she was shot during the attempted robbery of a drug dealer in
her apartment building on West 138th Street. She died in the
hospital 12 days later.
   Detective John Grenawalt, who interviewed Mrs. Wright in the
hospital, said there had been no arrest in her shooting. He added,
incredulously, ``To this day, I have yet to get a phone call from
her family.''
   The family seems to accept her death as an awful - but not
altogether surprising - consequence of her drug use and the
neighborhood they live in. Larry and his grandmother, Margaret
Cook, still live in the building.
   Mrs. Cook was sitting on a folding metal chair on the sidewalk
across from the building one day recently when she talked about her
grandson. She is a slight woman who holds her arms close to her as
she talks.
   Larry gave most of his money to his mother, she said. ``As soon
as he made it, she took it, and it was going to the dope man, might
as well tell the truth.''
   When Larry's father bought him a drum set for Christmas, ``momma
took care of it,'' the grandmother said. She chuckled at the
absurdity. ``I can talk about it. I can't hurt her now. She's
resting.''
   ``Some rich lady heard him and bought him a real expensive
set,'' she continued. ``Don't ask what happened to that one.''
Relatives and friends sitting with her nodded knowingly and joined
the chuckling.
   After his mother died, Larry appeared at her wake with his
drumsticks and a bucket and set them down outside the door of the
funeral parlor.
   ``He didn't really realize what happened to his mom until he saw
her laying down in a coffin,'' said Monte Detioger, 23, who
befriended Larry a year ago and now is his manager. ``When I saw
him looking at his mom, he was crying. He was like screaming
inside.''
   Drumming came early and easily to Larry. His mother used to say
he began tapping on things when he was 3 months old; his uncle,
Bernard Mercer, says the baby always headed straight for Mercer's
tambourines.
   ``He was just crawling in diapers. He couldn't walk yet, or
talk,'' the uncle said. ``He'd bang on the TV screen. He'd bang on
the wall, on the refrigerator, anything.''
   Larry himself remembers tapping on floors when he was 3. Later
came table tops, garbage pail lids, trees, bottles, cups and
eventually, plastic buckets - the five-gallon size used to package
wallboard compound and other products.
   Which is what he was looking for on a recent day at 46th Street
and Broadway. He scrounged several buckets from a construction
site, knocked out the residue and was ready to warm up.
   He tapped out various beats on the bottom of the bucket,
gradually playing faster and louder. He threw in strokes to the
side and rim to produce different sounds. Using his right foot to
rock the open end of the bucket up and down against the sidewalk,
he created a thumping bass beat.
   Many drummers could imitate his rhythms with a little practice,
but Larry's listeners marveled at his speed and precision.
   At the point in his solo where a theater audience might applaud,
Larry's new fans reached into their pockets. Most approached his
bucket slowly and respectfully, depositing a dollar as carefully as
they would at church.
   ``He's playing his insides out,'' marveled a tourist from
Massachusetts. A commuter from New Jersey bought a can of Coke and
set it down next to the sweating Larry. A young woman said she had
seen him on television and wanted to marry him. Others gave him
kisses.
   ``The kid's a prodigy,'' said a man from San Francisco.
   Max Roach agrees.
   ``He's phenomenal. The thing that fascinated me about him was
the way he sequentially set up his rhythms to create music on that
bucket. The way he put his accents in, you knew he wasn't just
banging. Even though he would switch from eighth to 16th to 32nd
notes, it was still musical,'' he said.
   Roach spotted him coming out of Macy's one day. ``There was a
crowd around him. I heard these rhythms coming out and I stood
there with the crowd for about 20 minutes. I was really impressed.
The fact he had the strength that he could do this, probably for
hours, and he made sense with it. Just that bucket. He's very
musical.''
   And quite unprepared for success.
   Detioger, his manager, describes Wright as a ``street kid,''
with little education or understanding of people.
   ``He tries to be a man, but he's not,'' Detioger said. ``He
doesn't know anything about life. He's earning $200 a day banging
on a bucket in Times Square. He said, `Look Monte, I don't need to
go to school, look at how I do.' ''
   Since his mother's death, though, Wright has returned to school
for the first time in two years and says he's saving his money. His
goal, he says, is not to be in a band but to become a star soloist.
   ``I'm good enough to become a star, I know that,'' he says.
``I'm always playing my drums. That's the only thing I think about.
I don't let nobody get to me.'' And he adds, ``If I didn't have
that talent, I'd probably be locked up somewhere.''
   In the background is the memory of his mother and her fate.
Mercer, his uncle, says that for all her troubles Marilyn Wright
forged a special bond with her son; she was honest about her drug
problem, and warned him to stay clean.
   ``He's my life,'' she told an interviewer last year. ``He's my
whole world.'' In reality, however, drugs always rivaled Larry for
her attention.
   Mercer recalls the scene at the hospital, after she had been
shot:
   ``As they were getting ready to take her upstairs to her room,
she looked at all of us and said, `Take care of my son.' Then she
started crying with this real cry, like I never . . . like she used
to cry when she was a little girl.''

<HEAD>A Bush Supporter Denounces Budget Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The budget deal reached by the budget summiteers
comes with the claim of $500 billion in savings over the next five
years, but that claim doesn't mean overall cuts in government
spending.
   Government spending will continue to grow, by $55 billion in
fiscal 1991, a 4.5 percent rise, and by $222 billion in the next
five years, an increase of 18.4 percent. It will be financed mainly
by taxing rather than cutting.
   Confusion over this aspect of the agreement between the White
House and congressional leaders afflicts not just the public but
tax and finance experts and members of Congress, some of whom might
have been directly involved.
   In many instances, the cuts referred to are reductions in
planned or proposed spending rather than actual spending. Medicare
spending, for instance, will be ``cut'' by $4.6 billion but grow by
$4.4 billion in fiscal 1991.
   On a more personal basis, the monthly tax that senior citizens
pay to Medicare will be increased, but the revenues so generated
are counted in the agreement as a spending cut.
   In a scorching criticism of the agreement, Scott Hodge and
Daniel Mitchell of the Heritage Foundation, who supplied these
figures, claim negotiatiors sought to blunt negative reaction by
conspiring to ``cook the books.''
   That term is sometimes used by companies to hide financial
shenanigans from auditors and shareholders or to paint a
rosier-than-real picture. Hodge and Mitchell suggest that this
seems to have been a goal of the negotiators, too.
   They contend that ``the agreement is the most successful use of
blue smoke and mirrors to date by the budget summiteers,'' and that
few Senators and Congressmen can figure out what it is they are
asked to vote on.
   They conclude that in spite of the blue smoke, the glare and the
shadows, it is quite clear that Congress cannot control its
spending and that by means of higher taxes it seeks to shift the
burden from itself to the taxpayer.
   The affect, they say, might be enough to push the country into a
full-blown recession, but that isn't the way the summitteers see
it. Instead of slowing the economy, they assume it will spur it to
much greater growth.
   Should that growth - double this year's growth rate in 1991 and
almost triple that rate in 1992 - fail to develop, so also will
some of the alleged savings. But at least two other dangers must be
considered, too.
   1. Congress could begin almost immediately to offset any true
cuts with new spending measures. The danger is real - massive tax
cuts early in the 1980s were entirely offset by massive spending
well before the end of the decade.
   2. The agreement assumes that the Federal Reserve Board will be
so impressed by the negotiator's efforts that it will adopt an
easier money policy, which would mean lower interest rates.
   But, Hodge and Mitchell argue, the agreement could worsen rather
than lessen inflation. If inflation worsens, interest rates aren't
likely to fall. And, they say, $25 billion of the alleged savings
assume lower rates.
   These are the ingredients of a spirited discussion for Congress,
during which some of the hazier aspects might become clearer and
any dangers to the economy be re-examined without the blinding
glare of mirrors.
   Potentially, the political damage could be worse. The
foundation, a conservative think tank, has strongly supported
Presidents Reagan and Bush, and has had much intellectual input and
influence in their administrations.
   While Hodge and Mitchell might not speak for the entire
foundation, their views were distributed by it, and so far as is
known, they remain in good standing.

   The Los Angeles Basin has the dirtiest air in

In this profile, the fifth part of the occasional series, ``City

- with smog.

<TEXT>
   As Bob Phalen's minivan climbs a freeway
ramp on his 10-mile commute to work, he scans the sky to the east,
looking for mile-high Saddleback mountain, barely visible through
thick Los Angeles Basin smog.
   ``This is where I judge the air each day. It's pretty dirty
today,'' says Phalen, who can tick off the pollutants: nitrogen
dioxide, ozone, acids, soot and cancer-causing chemicals.
   ``Dirty air depresses me, but it reminds me I have a job to do.
There are millions of Americans breathing this stuff.''
   Phalen, a 49-year-old biophysicist and inhalation toxicologist,
directs the Air Pollution Health Effects Laboratory at the
University of California, Irvine. The campus is on the southern
edge of America's dirtiest smog zone: metro Los Angeles.
   Every day, in the lab where he and his team of jeans-clad
scientists manipulate smog exposure chambers, treadmills, fake
noses and pollution-breathing mannequins, Phalen examines polluted
air with the detachment of a scientist.
   But he breathes it, too. And so do his wife and two sons.
   Phalen the scientist speaks of the dangers: ``We breathe dozens
of carcinogens in every breath.'' They build up in the body because
ozone impairs the lungs' self-cleansing abilities.
   ``In heavily populated areas, one in 10 or 20 people suffer
because of air pollution - headaches, increased asthma attacks,
worsening of bronchitis and more frequent respiratory tract
infections.
   ``The most serious problems air pollution produce are not
immediate symptoms, but the contribution to lung disease. The
American Lung Association has estimated air pollution is a
contributing factor in about 10 percent of human deaths in urban
areas.''
   So how worried is he for his wife Kathy, his sons Robert, 21,
and Steven, 18, and himself?
   Yes, smog sometimes causes burning eyes, headaches and chest
tightness during exercise. Yes, Kathy Phalen said, smog is
depressing, hanging ``like a big heavy brown blanket over the
area.''
   But Phalen views life as a balance between risks and benefits.
Even he doesn't know how chronic exposure to smog affects his
family's health, but the Phalens don't intend to leave Southern
California.
   ``We have excellent food, wonderful climate, a good educational
system, a solid economy,'' he said. ``We have good medical services
and a relatively relaxed lifestyle. All these things promote good
health.
   ``It's certainly not worth moving to get away from the smog.''
   Barely an hour past breakfast, at the lab now, Phalen plunges
his gloved hands into a plastic tub of saline solution and pulls
out a blackened human lung.
   ``This is the lung of a smoker,'' he said. ``This particular
person died of a heart attack. The lungs weren't suitable for
transplantation. They were in bad shape.''
   The lungs were donated for research. In Phalen's laboratory,
blue silicone rubber was injected into one lung, filling the
airways and gradually congealing.
   Phalen submerges the lung into a tray of lye. A few days later,
the lung is dissolved. What remains is a lung cast: a blue rubber
mold of the branching airways, even tiny ones.
   Phalen studies casts of human, dog and ferret lungs to learn how
age and bad air change the passageways that carry oxygen and
pollutants into the body.
   ``Most environmental risks are through inhalation,'' he said.
``Each day, you drink two quarts of liquid, you eat two quarts of
food, but you inhale 15,000 quarts of air.''
   Here, and in other urban areas, are two strains of pollution:
primary pollutants, emitted by cars, factories and power plants,
and secondary ones, including ozone, ``a very irritating gas,''
created when sunlight triggers reactions among primary elements.
   He believes the health risks of air pollution must be reduced by
developing ``more efficient transportation; better emission control
systems for cars, trucks, power plants and industry, and better
ways of destroying our wastes.''
   But Phalen opposes confrontation politics - ``Hatred is the
worst pollution,'' he said - and doesn't consider polluters bad
guys.
   ``Air pollution is not created by malicious toxic polluters,''
he said ``It's created by our automobiles, our industry and our
generation of electricity. It's a consequence of our modern
society, and that society appears to be responsible for adding
approximately 40 years to our lifespan when we compare ourselves
with completely undeveloped countries.''
   Again, risks and benefits.
   Phalen got interested in the health effects of environmental
contaminants years ago. His master's and doctoral theses examined
how silver from the walls of a nuclear reactor where an explosion
occurred got into the lungs of rescue workers.
   He had been steered toward a scientific career by an
pharmacist-uncle who admired Einstein. ``He showed me that through
knowledge you can do something about a problem,'' Phalen said.
``You don't have to just be a victim, suffer and die.''
   Which brings him to the role of his lab now: ``to identify
particularly hazardous pollutants and combinations of pollutants
and target them for control.''
   John R. Holmes, research director of California's Air Resources
Board, said Phalen's 15-member team is responsible for several
breakthroughs, including assessments of how human health is
affected by mixtures of pollutants.
   ``Our air will be cleaner eventually as a result of what Bob
Phalen and his colleagues have done, and the nation will benefit
too,'' said Holmes.
   He credited Phalen with finding that children absorb much higher
doses of air pollution than adults, and with showing how ozone
hinders breathing, which allowed California to justify the nation's
toughest ozone standard.
   Phalen and his colleagues invented many of the innovative
testing tools used in the lab. The fake noses, for example.
   Polluted air is pumped through the noses - rubber cylinders with
carved channels - to simulate breathing, showing how much pollution
reaches the lungs, and how much is deposited inside the nose where
some contaminants can cause nasal cancer.
   ``We have 40 techniques for making smog,'' including tanks of
pollutants, an ozone machine, a diesel engine and a soot-producing
propane burner, he said.
   Rats and ferrets breathe the noxious air, sometimes while
walking on treadmills for studies on the effects of pollution and
exercise.
   Phalen's use of animals made him a target of the Animal
Liberation Front, which raided his lab in January 1988 and stole 13
beagles.
   The raid ended his studies with dogs. Phalen acknowledged that
40 beagles had been euthanized in one study, but he called the raid
ironic, saying he always advocated humane treatment of research
animals and either adopted or found homes for dozens of beagles
whose research careers were over.
   He has a former laboratory dog at home now. Until recently,
there was another one, a 15{-year-old beagle slowed by malignant
tumors and arthritis.
   ``Daphne was our friend, and it's painful to remember her not
being alive,'' said Phalen, who took the old dog to the lab one
morning, played with her one last time on the lawn, then held and
petted her while a technician put her to sleep.
   Afterward, the dog's lungs were removed and injected with
silicone rubber.
   ``It's a beautiful cast,'' Phalen said.

   Some people march against world hunger.
Some people give to charity. Others join the Peace Corps.
   Glenn Hawkes? He makes chili.
   ``Hunger is the next wall to fall,'' said Hawkes, a long-time
peace and anti-nuclear activist. ``I wanted to start a company that
would be dedicated to a single social cause - eliminating hunger.''
   So Hawkes, a former elementary school principal and founder of
Parents and Teachers for Social Responsibility, took out a $35,000
mortgage on his house and started Food 2000 Inc., which aims to end
world hunger by the year 2000.
   Food 2000 makes a product called Chili 2000. The chili, which is
packaged in a reusable glass jar, is sold to stores across the
country. For every 12 jars sold, one - or the value of one - is
given away to a local hunger group.
   Socially responsible diners need not confine themselves to a
diet of chili; these days, altruistic businesses now make cookies,
buttercruch candy, tea, salad dressing, spaghetti sauce and other
comestibles, sell them to the public and then donate a percentage
of their profits to heal societal wounds.
   ``Business was always the bugaboo of the peace activists, but
that was a horrendous mistake,'' said Hawkes. ``Being anti-business
slowed down any progress and cut off our strength.''
   Hawkes was inspired by another Vermont business, Ben &amp; Jerry's
Homemade, which regularly donates money, ice cream and marketing
expertise to causes.
   The company's ``primary purpose is to use the power and
creativity of business to be a force for social change,'' said Ben
Cohen, one of the founders of Ben &amp; Jerry's and president of the
separate Community Products Inc.
   Community Products makes Rainforest Crunch, a buttercrunch
candy. The company buys cashews and Brazil nuts straight from the
Brazilian Indian growers - building demand for the nuts and
eliminating the middle man, increasing growers' earnings 3 to 10
percent.
   The company donates 40 percent of its pretax profits to
organizations working to save the world's rain forests.
   Another 20 percent goes to One Percent For Peace Inc., a
non-profit organization founded by Cohen that wants the government
to devote the equivalent of 1 percent of the U.S. military budget
to ventures that promote understanding between cultures.
   The nuts that aren't used in candy go into Ben and Jerry's
Rainforest Crunch ice cream. And the powdery residue that remains
after the nuts are crunched soon will be used as an ingredient in
chocolate chip cookies.
   Those cookies will be made be Glassman's Greyston Bakery, a
company owned and operated by Zen Buddhists.
   The bakery's goodies are available in 300 gourmet shops
nationwide, and its brownies are used in Ben and Jerry's Fudge
Brownie ice cream; it plans to use some of its profits to renovate
buildings near its Yonkers, N.Y., factory and turn them over to the
homeless.
   The Ben &amp; Jerry social action cluster is not alone. A growing
list of companies hope to prove that the path to grocery shelves -
and profits - can be paved with good intentions:
   -NEWMAN'S OWN INC. Actor Paul Nwman founded his company in 1982
to market his gourmet salad dressing; it also makes spaghetti
sauce, popcorn and lemonade, donating 100 percent of its profits.
   In 1989, the company gave about $7 million to 320 organizations,
with $600,000 going to AIDS-related charities across the country.
   ``That's what makes this business such a kick - this mutually
beneficial recycling from the `haves' to the `have-nots,' '' said
Newman.
   -THE STASH TEA CO. of Portland, Ore., sells all-natural Earl
Grey, herbal, peppermint, camomile and other teas. Ten cents a
package goes to UNICEF for oral rehydration therapy, a solution of
water, sugar and salts that combat dehydration. Dehydration is the
largest cause of death in developing nations.
   Information about the therapy is put on store displays and in
the company's mail-order catalog. Response from the public has been
solid.
   ``We get positive feedback from the store managers as well as
the customers,'' said general manager Thomas Lisicki.
   -THOUSAND STARS INC., like Ben &amp; Jerry's, makes ice cream,
frozen yogurt and novelty bars. And like Ben &amp; Jerry's, this
2-year-old business is concerned about the rain forests.
   One percent of the proceeds from most of the company's products
go to two lobbying groups that advocate the accountability from
corporations and governments for rain-forest destruction.
   From the company's base in Junction City, Ore., ``We see the
destruction of logging. If you live in L.A., you don't see the
lumber trucks carting the trees away,'' said founder and owner Mark
Brawerman. ``We chose to focus on one area rather than be
insignificant in several.''
   He questions why a fledgling company such as his should be one
of a handful that contribute to social concerns: ``Where is the
rest of corporate America?''
   But Hawkes says there are changes blowing in the wind. He said
even the big corporations, which do not have a primary agenda of
social change, are seeing that such practices sell.
   ``It's a neat example of capitalism,'' he said. ``Some of it is
going to be shallow, of course, but we ought to welcome even the
most greedy enterprise that puts stakes in a service to society.''

<HEAD>Chilean Guerrilla Group Promotes Marxism, Sexual Revolution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDUARDO GALLARDO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rebel group that came into existence
during the former military regime is now baffling the new civilian
government with indiscriminate attacks and an ideology that
promotes Marxism and sexual promiscuity.
   Officials say the Lautaro Front is composed of about 100
hard-core commandoes and an estimated 5,000 followers, mostly
youngsters recruited from big city slums and middle-class high
schools who are too young to be legally prosecuted.
   The group takes its name from Lautaro, a Mapuche Indian chief
who fought the Spanish conquerors of Chile five centuries ago, and
police say it is unlike any other radical group in Latin America.
   The Lautaro, under the motto ``everything for the people,'' not
only promotes armed struggle and Marxist revolution, but also total
sexual freedom. Police say the latter is a strategy to attract
youth - and that it's working.
   Some of the group's strategies include robbing drug stores of
condoms and contraceptives, then giving them away at schools,
colleges and slums.
   Recently, a commando of the Front even took to distributing
female underwear for free at a Santiago college.
   An alleged leader of the Front identified only as ``Felipe,''
interviewed by a leftist newsgazine, explained the group's approach
to sex: ``It's our invitation to youth. We urge them to be happy
here and now. We don't call this free sex. We call it our sex.''
   The Front often robs supermarkets and food trucks, then hands
out poultry, milk and other supplies in slums.
   Still, it's a violent group. Authorities say it has killed at
least 10 police officers in random attacks the last two years. Last
August, a commando sprayed a police bus with sub-machinegun fire,
leaving two officers dead. One of the victims was an 18-year-old
rookie officer.
   ``All cops are our enemies,'' read a pamphlet left in the attack
site.
   The targets for the Front attacks also vary greatly. Since the
beginning of the year, the Front has claimed responsibility for
most of the 46 bomb attacks against Mormon chapels across Chile,
causing widespread damage but no victims.
   In leaflets found at the attacked chapels, the Front called the
Mormon church ``a tool of Yankee imperialism.''
   Police have been stymied in their investigation of the group's
activities, with one officer saying, ``These are indeed very
strange people.''
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, the investigator said:
``Once we arrested a Front member during a supermarket robbery
attempt. After a week of fruitless questioning, we had to give up.
The man simply wouldn't open his mouth.''
   Another arrested guerrilla, the officer said, claimed
responsibility for killing a police officer.
   ``It was chilling,'' he said. ``He told us he had indeed shot
the man. And he added that immediately after the attack, he went to
the movies with his girlfriend.''
   Interior Minister Enrique Krauss said recently that the
government is ``certainly worried'' about the group activities,
but, he claimed, ``It has been losing strength in recent weeks.''
   His justice colleague, Francisco Cumplido, warned though that
``there is a real risk'' in the Front's continued recruiting of
high school students.
   Jorge Roman, president of the Chilean High School Students
Federation, said the Front's recruiters aim mainly at students aged
15 to 17 ``because, according to the law, they are juveniles and
their legal responsibility is limited.''
   Acting Education Minister Raul Allard said his office will
launch a ``campaign of orientation'' to counter the Front's
recruiting efforts in the schools.
   Explained Claudio Orrego, president of the Santiago Catholic
University Students' Federation, ``We must make young people to
understand that violence is not democratic or heroic. They must
understand that the country is no longer under a dictatorship.''
   The Lautaro Front was organized in the mid-1980s to fight the
military regime of Gen. Augusto Pinochet. To the chagrin of the
elected civilian government, it has remained active after Pinochet
was succeeded in March by President Patricio Aylwin.
   The goverment change did not impress the Front, which has vowed
to continue its struggle, calling Aylwin ``a bourgeois enemy.''
   Another guerrilla group created to fight the Pinochet regime,
the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front, has virtually ceased
operations as a result of the new political situation in Chile.

<HEAD>Barring Fertile Women From Work: Protection or Prejudice?</HEAD>

   Every day, Gloyce Qualls lives with a cruel
choice she made six years ago: She traded her fertility for her
job. She felt agony then; she feels anger now.
   ``I regret it all the time,'' she said. ``It's something I had
to do to keep my job. I wouldn't do it again. I'd tell them, `Take
this job and shove it.' ''
   Mrs. Qualls works at Milwaukee-based Johnson Controls Inc., the
nation's largest auto battery manufacturer, whose policy of barring
fertile women from potentially risky jobs has triggered debate from
the factory floor up to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   On Wednesday, labor and business clash in the high court over
big issues - civil rights, privacy, safety, women in the workplace
- and, some say, big stakes. By one estimate, 20 million jobs could
be off-limits to females.
   ``It's an enormously important case,'' said Ellen Vargyas, an
attorney at the National Women's Law Center. ``We have women moving
into the work force, making some gains. It could be a major
setback.''
   International Union et. al vs. Johnson Controls - called
possibly the most important sex-discrimination case in decades -
focuses on one four-letter word: lead. The raw material, used in
auto batteries, is a potential hazard to fetuses and the basis for
Johnson's 8-year-old fetal protection policy.
   That policy doesn't encourage women to have themselves
sterilized and, in fact, Johnson says it strongly advises against
it. But Mrs. Qualls said she had a tubal ligation to qualify for a
higher-salary job because, ``I needed the money, frankly.''
   Johnson says banning women who can bear children from jobs in
high-lead areas is protection. But the United Auto Workers,
representing many of the workers, says it's prejudice.
   It violates civil rights, the UAW contends, and relegates women
to lower-paying jobs with little chance for promotion.
   ``It's plainly sex discrimination,'' said Joan Bertin of the
American Civil Liberties Union in New York City. ``If you have a
health and safety problem, you fix the workplace, not the worker.
If something made your spleen become infected at work, you wouldn't
say, `We'll only take workers who don't have spleens.' ''
   Men, some of whom work with their wives at Johnson's 13 battery
plants, also face lead hazards, workers note.
   ``If it was health, they would be concerned about all people,''
argued Judy Seymore, a Milwaukee worker. ``I think the woman is a
scapegoat.''
   In fact, one man is a named plaintiff in the class-action suit;
he sought to reduce his lead levels because he intended to become a
father.
   Scientists have linked reduced male fertility and high lead
exposure, but Johnson notes that there are no conclusive studies on
a father's impact on a fetus.
   Johnson, which has spent $15 milion on improvements from
1979-85, argues conditions are safe for men and women, but not for
unborn children.
   Doctors say low lead levels can cause premature babies and minor
birth defects, while high doses can be devastating.
   ``We think it would be wrong to knowingly expose fetuses to
physical harm. That is the No. 1 overwhelming issue why that policy
is in place,'' said Johnson spokeswoman Denise Zutz. ``The goal is
for there not to be a single tragedy.''
   The ban applies to all fertile women - not just those pregnant -
because lead can remain in the body long periods, Zutz said.
   Johnson also dismisses accusations it is motivated by fears of
lawsuits.
   ``Having shareholders, it would be wrong of us not to be aware
of that concern,'' Zutz said, but adds that's not Johnson's guiding
principle.
   ``They were acting out of the purest motives,'' said Stephen
Bokat, general counsel at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, one of
several business, religious and industrial groups supporting
Johnson. ``It wasn't somebody's idea to get rid of women.''
   If not the intent, it's the result, workers claim. They say
there's little incentive to join Johnson since fertile women now
hired are ineligible for top-scale jobs at the company's 13 plants,
located in California, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, North
Carolina, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, Vermont and
Wisconsin.
   Though Johnson says fewer than 20 women were transferred when
the policy became mandatory and that all retained their salaries,
workers say they lost overtime, shift differentials and promotion
opportunities.
   ``I have been denied the pay potential I am capable of earning
because I am a woman,'' said Catherine Voeltner, a 32-year-old
Milwaukee worker. Three years ago, she said, some men in lead areas
earned $9 to $10 an hour, while she made $5.50 and had more
seniority.
   ``It makes me mad, very mad,'' said Voeltner, an 11-year Johnson
veteran. ``A lot of women out there are losing $100 a week in
take-home pay. That's a lot of money when you're trying to raise a
family.''
   Other women say they've been stripped of their dignity.
   Virginia Green, a Bennington, Vt., worker, was 50 and long done
with childbearing when she was transferred to a glorified laundry
job. ``Was I angry? You'd better believe it,'' she said. She
considered sterilization, but said her doctor told her it was too
dangerous.
   This isn't the first protest of such rules. At least 15 major
corporations have fetal protection policies, and lawsuits have been
filed by hospital technicians, factory and auto workers, the ACLU
says. Among the companies with such policies are General Motors
Corp., Monsanto Corp. and duPont.
   In 1983, the ACLU reached an out-of-court settlement in a
discrimination suit against the American Cyanamid Co. on behalf of
several women workers at a West Virginia plant.
   Five women were sterilized to keep their jobs in a paint
pigments section, which closed within two years of their surgery,
the ACLU's Bertin said.
   Betty Riggs, then a 26-year-old mother facing divorce and
helping to support her ailing parents, is haunted by her
sterilization.
   ``I've wished a 100 million times I could change what
happened,'' she said. ``Me and my (second) husband could have had a
family of our own. We never will. They deprived us of a normal
family life.''
   Gloyce Qualls, 41, has similar feelings.
   ``Sometimes I see a lady pregnant my age ... I get mad at myself
for doing it,'' she said. ``Sometimes I feel bad, and I say, `Well
I did what I had to do.' ''
   Mrs. Qualls is unclear whether staff reductions or the policy
prompted her transfer from a high-lead area, but whentthe chance
arose to return to that department, she couldn't if she were
fertile.
   She was in her mid-30s, and about to be married to a man with
four children. Though they wanted a baby together and she had
received some money to compensate for the transfer, ``bringing home
less than $200 a week wasn't going to make it, it wasn't going to
pay the bills,'' she said.
   Her husband, Ike - who also works at the plant - her friends and
sister opposed surgery.
   ``It's very unfair,'' she now says, bouncing her granddaughter
on her knee. ``The company ought not to have nothing to do with
your body.''

   These controversial choice and reproduction issues already have
been debated in court, with conflicting rulings.
   This year, the California Supreme Court upheld a ruling against
Johnson in which a lower court said, in part: ``We are in an era of
choice. A woman is not required to become a Victorian brood mare.''
   But in 1989, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals supported Johnson,
saying it is ``reasonably necessary to the industrial safety-based
concern of protecting the unborn child from lead exposure.''
   Judge Frank Easterbrook dissented in that ruling, being appealed
to the high court. He called it likely the most important
sex-discrimination case since the 1964 enactment of Title VII,
which barred sexual bias in employment.
   Some business leaders say the potential impact is exaggerated,
but Mrs. Seymore disagrees.
   ``I'm not fighting only for me,'' she said. ``This is for all
women.''

   Her husband didn't want her to do it. Her sister and her friends
didn't want her to do it. But Gloyce Qualls says when she decided
to be sterilized six years ago, only one opinion mattered - that of
her employer. Fertile women could not work where they would be
exposed to high levels of lead, her company said. This week, that
policy comes before the U.S. Supreme Court in what is being touted
as the most important sex discrimination case in decades.

<HEAD>Finding Plants that Thrive without Much Water</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Corrects spelling to drought-resistant, sted
drought-resistent.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES E. WALTERS</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By choice or necessity, plants that use little
water are growing enormously in popularity in the Southwest, where
drought and soaring water costs drive home the message of current
or potential water shortages.
   But be warned: They don't become drought-resistant until they've
become established in your landscape, which may take a couple of
years.
   So while their reputation for needing little care and little
water is well justified, you can't just bring one home from the
nursery, dig a hole, put it in, and you and the plant live happily
ever after.
   Start by doing some research. For long-term satisfaction, check
first the vast amount of shade and color possible. Then be sure the
plant is suited for the location being considered.
   Will it eventually become too large for available space? If it
sheds leaves, seed pods and other litter, will this be a problem,
such as around a pool or patio? Can it reasonably be expected to
handle environmental stress - sun, wind, heat or cold - it must
tolerate in the contemplated site?
   Take your time in this. Study reference books. Talk to experts.
A species ideal in one part of your landscape may prove a nightmare
elsewhere. Unlike some clothes, one size definitely doesn't fit all
situations.
   Fall normally is the best time to plant most trees and shrubs in
warm-arid areas, strange as this may sound to newcomers accustomed
to snow and freezing temperatures.
   Not too much top growth may show initially, but the root growth
will get the plant ready for the triple-digit temperatures and
drying winds of the following summer. Early spring is the next best
time for planting, especially for cold-tender ones.
   A newly installed plant should be watered about every other week
in cooler weather and once or twice a week through the warmest
months for the first year or two. If it's making satisfactory
growth and looks healthy, back off to determine whether
supplemental watering still is required.
   If the plant seems to start suffering, apply an inch or two of
water and see if this helps. If it does, wait about a month to see
if another watering is needed. Once drought-resistant plants are
established, watering can be reduced dramatically.
   In general, over-watering is a serious problem for
drought-resistant plants. Once established, they simply can't
handle constantly moist soil. But natural rainfall may not be
sufficient in some years, either.
   Wilted foliage usually is a good indication of too little water.
Sometimes the leaf color becomes dull. It takes practice to
determine such nuances.
   New plants should be watered before they reach this stage. A
good rule to remember: Established plants probably won't die from
lack of irrigation; they just won't grow very fast or look as well.
   Make sure to apply water slowly and deeply. As a rough rule of
thumb, one inch of water on the surface will wet the soil one foot
deep. Thus deep, slow watering promotes root development at lower
soil levels, which helps minimize plant problems in hot weather.
   Deep watering also works to flush soil salts from the root zone.
This is important since salt content of arid-region soils normally
is quite high.
   Once drought-resistant plants are established, do you
automatically turn off the water? In certain cases, yes. For
example, if a tree has reached its desired size and can get by on
natural rainfall, stop watering it.
   When fertilizing, remember that nitrogen is the one element
consistently missing in most arid region soils. Most
drought-resistant plants, once established, need little, if any
fertilizer. As in watering, ``once established'' are the key words.
   A small amount of slow-release fertilizer, following label
directions, helps at planting time. Then, if the plants are putting
on the growth and providing the landscaping effect you want, they
probably don't need any.
   After all, many are native to areas where soil nitrogen is low,
owing to sparse vegetation where little organic matter is recycled
into the soil. Many experts believe that stimulating growth through
fertilizer reduces the lifespan of many arid-adapted plants. And as
plants increase their growth rate, they require more water and more
maintenance, such as pruning.
   Ammonium sulfate is an inexpensive, readily available fertilizer
containing 21 percent nitrogen and 24 percent sulfur. As a general
rule, 2 ounces of ammonium sulfate a year is sufficient nitrogen
for even a good-sized shrub under warm-arid conditions.
   The sulfur also lowers the pH, a most important consideration in
areas with alkaline soil, such as much of the Southwest.

   A sigh of relief sounded on Wall Street after
the Bush administration and leaders of Congress finally compromised
on a budget, but the best thing many observers could say of the
accord was that it exists.
   ``I think the financial markets are grateful that the issue is
going to be put behind us for a while,'' said David H. Resler,
chief economist at Nomura Securities International Inc.
``Regardless of whether people like or dislike the compromise,
there is some feeling that an albatross has been removed from
around the market's neck.''
   A stalemate in the negotiations over a package of tax increases
and spending cuts had added to the worries weighing down the stock
market in recent weeks. Markets on Monday welcomed the break in the
deadlock as a sign that interest rates could be header lower.

   NEW YORK (AP) - The volatile price of oil took its
second-sharpest fall of the Persian Gulf crisis, tumbling more than
$2 per barrel as traders thought they saw glimmers of peace.
   Light sweet crude for November delivery dropped $2.42 to $37.09
a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange Monday. Oil's largest
one-day fall since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 was $4 per barrel
on Aug. 27.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Former Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan said
the savings and loan industry would have plunged ``into the tank''
deeper and faster without the deregulatory policies of the Reagan
administration.
   When asked by Rep. Chalmers Wylie, R-Ohio, whether the thrift
debacle discredited deregulation, Regan replied ``absolutely not.''
Regan appeared Monday before the House Banking Committee in the
first of a series of hearings examining the causes of the S&amp;L mess.

   NEW YORK (AP) - The nation's manufacturing economy last month
hit its lowest level since the end of the previous recession in
late 1982, according to a key business survey.
   The third straight monthly drop in the National Association of
Purchasing Management index provided more evidence of an imminent
recession and reflected increased prices from the oil crisis.
   The group said Monday its indexes for production, new orders,
imports, inventories and employment all dropped sharply last month.
Meanwhile, its price index shot up to its highest level since
September 1988.
   ---
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Construction spending stalled in August
following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait after posting its first gain in
four months in July, the government said.
   Only an increase in government projects kept overall spending
from declining, according to a Commerce Department report released
Monday.
   ``Confidence is the major problem we have across the board right
now,'' said Daryl Delano, an economist with Cahners Economics in
Newton, Mass.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Falling prices and mortgage rates combined
with rising incomes in August to improve the typical American
family's ability to buy a home, a real estate trade group said.
   But the National Association of Realtors said Monday that the
improvement was curtailed by the Mideast crisis and weakness in the
overall economy.
   The Realtors group said its housing affordability index rose
from 102.4 in July to 105.6 in August. That meant a family with a
median income of $34,467 had 105.6 percent of the income needed to
buy a median-priced existing home costing $97,000.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal Reserve will move quickly to lower
interest rates now that negotiators have reached agreement on a
deficit-cutting plan, many economists predict.
   But these analysts said Monday the interest rate relief will be
too little and too late to avert a recession. Their forecasts were
made before today's key meeting of the Fed's top policy-making
group, the Federal Open Market Committee.

   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) - Exxon Corp. and its shipping subsidiary
have filed notices of claims against the U.S. Coast Guard totalling
more than $2 billion in connection with the Exxon Valdez shipwreck.
   Exxon spokesman Les Rogers said the Sept. 21 filings preserve
options for Exxon and Exxon Shipping Co. to sue the Coast Guard
over the spill.
   Exxon declined to offer an explanation for why company officials
think the Coast Guard should share responsibility for the March 24,
1989, oil spill that dumped nearly 11 million gallons of crude into
Prince William Sound.

<HEAD>Gannett Foundation Rejects $540 Million Stock Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Gannett Foundation has rejected a $540
million bid from the Gannett Co. to buy its 10 percent block of the
media giant's stock.
   Martin F. Birmingham, chairman of the foundation's finance and
investment committee, said Monday that the foundation, Gannett's
largest shareholder, had authorized the investment firm of Salomon
Brothers to seek other offers.
   ``The current depressed market price of Gannett stock does not
represent the true value of the company,'' Birmingham said. ``It
would be irresponsible for the trustees to accept this
unsatisfactory `at the market' bid.''
   The bid, dated Sept. 14, was $33.87{ per share for a total value
of about $540 million.
   The foundation had told the company that no substantive talks
with interested third parties would take place as long as serious
negotiations were going on with the company.
   Douglas H. McCorkindale, Gannett Co.'s chief financial officer,
agreed the company's stock was undervalued because of the recent
downturn in advertising revenue.
   Despite the foundation's rejection, Gannett Co. was still ``a
ready, willing and able buyer of the stock,'' he said.
   McCorkindale said Gannett was not worried that having such a
large block of stock up for grabs could make the company a
potential takeover target because ``financing a takeover in today's
market is much, much more difficult than it was two, three or four
years ago.''
   He cited the decline of the junk bond market that financed a
number of takeovers in the 1980s.
   He also noted that Gannett has a shareholder rights offering
plan that would kick in after somebody acquires 15 percent of the
stock. The plan would make it prohibitively expensive for a suitor
to acquire more shares.
   John Morton, a newspaper analysts with Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan in
Washington, agreed, that Gannett Co. was the most likely buyer to
pay a premium over market price.
   ``If they (the foundation) couldn't get the price they wanted
from Gannett, I think it's unlikely they're going to get it from
anybody else,'' said Morton.
   ``It's not as though Gannett is a company that's considered a
prime candidate for a takeover. Takeover-prone companies, normally
are those that have not satisfied their shareholders with financial
performance over the years. You cannot say that about Gannett,'' he
said.
   Gannett stock closed at $32.87{ Monday, up $2 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   The foundation had told the company that no substantive talks
with interested third parties would take place as long as serious
negotiations were going on with the company.
   Birmingham said the company made its bid for the foundation's
block of nearly 16 million shares after foundation officials asked
for its best offer in writing.
   He said the market value of the stock was about $800 million at
the third-quarter high a year earlier.
   ``Since last year, many factors have contributed to the decline
of Gannett stock, including the company's first down quarter since
it went public in 1967 and its gloomy predictions about 1990
earnings overall,'' Birmingham said.
   The foundation was established in 1935 as an independent entity
with controlling ownership of the company. Since the company went
public, the percentage of ownership by the foundation has declined
to its current 10 percent.

<HEAD>House Passes Enforcement Bill Increasing SEC Powers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission will
get new powers to curb penny stock abuse and fine lawbreakers under
a reform bill passed unanimously by the House.
   The same bill was passed by the Senate last week, paving the way
for it to be signed into law by President Bush.
   The House also unanimously passed another bill Monday that would
enhance the SEC's ability to cooperate with foreign securities
regulators in the investigation of international fraud cases.
   ``We have begun to reverse the rapacious and deregulatory 1980s
with proper legislative protections for the small investor,'' said
Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the House subcommittee
that oversees the SEC. Markey was one of the penny stock bill's
sponsors.
   ``While these bill's won't make us forget the 1980s were the
decade of greed, they will at least begin the process of making the
1990s a safer decade for the small investor,'' he added.
   SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden, who lobbied hard for the reform
bills, said he was pleased they passed because they help the SEC
protect the markets' stability and deter fraud by providing more
flexibile enforcement.
   An earlier Senate version did not contain a penny stock
provision, but was similar in most other ways to the Securities
Enforcement and Penny Stock Reform Act passed by the House on July
23. A compromise bill including penny stock provisions was passed
unanimously by the Senate last week after a month of negotiations
between House and Senate staffers.
   The new bill will give the SEC the authority to bar crooked
promoters and consultants from selling penny stocks, highly
speculative securities that sell for a few dollars or less.
   While not illegal, penny stocks are prone to fraud and are
considered to be very risky at best. They are usually not traded on
any stock exchange and, thus, information amount them is hard to
come by.
   The bill also would tighten disclosure requirements for some
types of penny stocks.
   It also would:
   - give the SEC the power to order alleged wrongdoers to ``cease
and desist'' illegal activities without first having to go to court
and obtain a restraining order;
   - widen SEC authority to seek court orders barring convicted
securities law violators from serving as officers or directors of
companies with publicly-traded stock;
   - enact numerous reforms in the selling of penny stocks;
   - authorize new civil penalties for securities violators of up
to $100,000 per violation for an individual and up to $500,000 for
companies and other entities.
   Previously, the SEC had the power to impose fines only in
insider trading cases. For other violations such as fraudulent
sales techniques, the agency had no mid-level sanction. It could
only enjoin violators from repeating their activities or revoke
their license, which some have called the regulatory equivalent of
the death penalty.
   Monday's vote follows House and Senate approval of another
reform bill last week that will allow the SEC to regulate the
controversial computerized strategy of program trading in times of
extreme market turbulence.
   That bill also would give the SEC authority to monitor large
stock trades and the parent holding companies of brokerages. It
would also allow the agency to close the markets - with the
president's approval - in market emergencies.

   The jeweler Cartier is crying foul, the elderly are worried and
a liquor distributor says bootleggers are apt to move in on his
territory because of the new taxes and cutbacks in the proposed
$500 billion deficit-reduction plan.
   ``Bush sure made a big deal about reading his lips, didn't he?''
grumbled Curtis Sine, a barber in Ottumwa, Iowa.
   The plan unveiled Sunday calls for $134 billion in new taxes on
gasoline, alcohol, tobacco, airline tickets and other luxury items
and includes $105 billion in spending reductions for benefit
programs such as Medicare.
   Some around the country shrugged off higher taxes Monday, saying
the deficit must be brought under control. Sine wasn't one of them.
   ``It sounds terrible, but frankly, I'd like the other guy to pay
for it. I think generally that's how people think,'' he said.
   Mark Sherman, owner of Spirit World liquor store in Omaha, Neb.,
said, ``People are going to drink less and drink better. The actual
gallonage we sell is going to go down.''
   And Jack Hooper, president of the Tennessee Wine and Spirits
Co., a major distributor, said bootleggers will benefit from the
higher alcohol tax. ``We run the risk of making legitimate
businesses more expensive,'' he said.
   The taxes would be used to dig politicians in Washington out of
``a hole which they dug through fiscal irresponsibility,'' said
Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder.
   ``The individuals who will bear overwhelmingly the burden of
this `agreement' are the majority of Americans - the hard-working
middle class - and Americans in need, the poor among us,'' he said.
   Joe Crosby, 71, of El Paso, Texas, said he's one of those
people.
   ``I'm a disabled. I'm on Social Security and Medicare. They're
hurting me when they do all of that,'' he said.
   Ralph Destino, chairman of swanky Cartier, said smaller jewelry
makers and retailers will be hurt. ``This notion that somehow or
other taxing jewelry is in the `soak the rich' category just isn't
borne out by the facts in this country,'' he said.
   Bernard Hargrove, who sells boats at his Red River Marine in
Heber Springs, Ark., complained of new fees on boats. ``That's
ridiculous. Let's charge them an annual fee to play golf or go
watch a football game or whatever,'' he said.
   Mando Guerra, a patron at Midtown Lounge in El Paso, Texas,
wasn't concerned about the higher alcohol taxes but said his
grandmother receives Medicare benefits. ``It's going to hurt a
whole lot of old people,'' he said.
   The agreement would boost the federal gasoline tax from 9 cents
per gallon to 21 cents by next summer.
   ``Look at this - I'm already paying $1.66,'' said Richard
Coleman, a printer from West Haven, Conn., who was pumping premium
unleaded at a station. The state has the nation's highest state tax
at 22 cents a gallon. ``They're hitting the middle class again.''
   Truckers cried foul.``A lot of these truck drivers operate just
down to the bare teeth now, as far as profit margin is concerned.
This is gonna hurt 'em,'' Bill Gussett said from the Flying J truck
stop in La Grande, Ore.
   Higher gas taxes don't worry Bob Muscatell, who sells motor
homes and recreational vehicles in Santa Clara, Calif.
   ``I've always taken the position the RV buyers are not concerned
about the cost of the gasoline,'' he said. ``Even if (gas) costs $2
a gallon and you want to go on a trip with your family, it's still
cheaper than flying and other means of transportation.''
   Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said the gasoline-tax increase
is difficult, but good for the country.
   ``The nation needs a meaningful budget-reduction package,'' said
Susan Shackson, Ford director of public policy development. ``Is
this the best one? Probably not. But we are where we are. I would
say at this point let's get on with it.''

   The United Auto Workers turned their attention to
Ford Motor Co. today after the union's contract with General Motors
Corp. won overwhelming approval from the UAW rank and file.
   The UAW hopes to get Ford to adopt the contract with little or
no change. Negotiations with Ford were to resume today for the
first time since Aug. 28, when the union chose to focus on GM to
set a pattern contract for the industry.
   ``We want to get on with this thing,'' Ford spokesman Dick Routh
said Monday.
   Workers at GM factories and offices in 29 states ratified the
three-year pact 86,032 votes to 21,461, the union said Monday. Only
a third of the 300,000 members eligible to vote cast ballots last
week and Sunday.
   The light turnout reflected satisfaction with the agreement,
former UAW vice president Irving Bluestone said.
   ``When people are upset, that's when they come out to vote in
droves,'' he said.
   It's expected that Ford will be able to sign a parallel
contract, perhaps within a couple of weeks.
   Under the GM-UAW agreement, GM will spend up to $4.1 billion to
guarantee the income of laid-off workers. The contract also calls
for a 3 percent raise the first year and lump-sum payments of 3
percent in the following years.
   Reports have said that if the income-guarantee provision is
carried over to Ford, it could cost that company about $1.4
billion. Ford, however, streamlined its work force several years
before GM and might have smaller obligations.
   The story might be significantly different when the talks shift
to Chrysler Corp., possibly by the end of the month.
   Chrysler is in the worst financial shape by far of the Big Three
and has said the GM agreement seems expensive. Later this month,
Chrysler is expected to report what could be a third-quarter loss
of more than $200 million.
   The Big Three contracts cover about 463,000 workers in all. The
contracts expired Sept. 14, but their terms were extended while
talks continued.

   The Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in
support of the deficit-reduction package, but the amount of the
decline is likely to disappoint the Bush administration and not be
enough to keep the country out of a recession, private economists
predict.
   These analysts said rising inflationary pressures from a
doubling of oil prices will severely limit the Fed's maneuvering
room despite administration contentions that interest rates need to
fall swiftly in order to stave off an economic slump.
   The Fed's top policymakers gathered in Washington today for a
key meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC. The
panel, composed of Fed board members in Washington and Fed regional
presidents, meets eight times a year to map the course of interest
rates.
   While the results of the closed-door deliberations are not
released for six weeks, many economists said they expected a vote
by the FOMC to nudge short-term interest rates down by one-fourth
of a percentage point.
   For his part, President Bush on Monday reminded the Federal
Reserve of his keen interest in seeing lower interest rates and he
predicted that the weekend budget deal, once enacted by Congress,
would trigger rate declines.
   ``I would look to the Federal Reserve to lower the rates ...
once they see that a sound budget agreement has been put into
effect,'' Bush told reporters in New York.
   Both the administration and congressional negotiators are hoping
to complete action on the budget cuts and tax increases by Oct. 19,
although the legislative outcome was far from certain.
   Many analysts said final passage of the deficit-cutting package
would likely be the trigger for Fed rate cuts, although some said
the reduction could come sooner, especially if Friday's report on
the unemployment situation for September shows widespread weakness.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has pledged several
times to support a credible deficit reduction package, indicating
that the central bank would move to offset the negative effects of
lower government spending and higher taxes by reducing interest
rates.
   ``Greenspan has got to ease. If he doesn't, he is telling the
financial markets that he doesn't view the deficit agreement as
credible,'' said David Wyss, chief financial economist at
DRI-McGraw Hill.
   But Wyss and other economists said they were not looking for
much more than a 0.25 percentage point drop in the federal funds
rate. The rate, now 8 percent, is the interest that banks charge
each other on overnight loans.
   Some economists said that while small, a 0.25 percentage point
drop would likely prod commercial banks to lower their benchmark
prime lending rate to 9.5 percent.
   The prime rate, which is used as the base for setting many
consumer and business loans, has been at 10 percent since January.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co., said markets
should not expect anything beyond a small easing move on the Fed's
part because of the rising inflationary pressures buffeting the
U.S. economy.
   ``The Fed is being tossed back and forth by the Iraqi event,''
Sinai said. ``It wants to ease because of an impending recession,
but aggressive easing is very hard to do as long as the inflation
threat is as great as it is.''
   Sinai and other economists said they viewed a recession starting
this year as all but inevitable despite the Fed's belated move to
lower interest rates.
   ``The handwriting is on the wall. The Fed has already waited too
long if it had hoped to avoid a recession,'' said David Jones, an
economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co.
   Jones said he was looking for the first downturn since the
1981-82 slump to begin in the next three months and to last for a
full year.
   Many analysts said they looked for further rate cuts by the Fed
early next year as the extent and severity of the recession become
known.
   An economic downturn would call into question the economic
assumptions underlying the new budget agreement and make the
agreement's deficit&equals;cutting
goals that much harder to obtain.
   The administration's new forecast predicts the overall economy,
as measured by the gross national product, will grow by 1.3 percent
in 1991, nearly double the 0.7 percent GNP rate forecast for this
year.
   But economists noted that the economic outlook was based on an
assumption that oil prices will average $24.15 per barrel in 1991,
far lower than current average of nearly $40 per barrel.

   For global economies, an empty barrel of oil can
be as scary as the loaded barrel of a gun.
   No shots have been exchanged yet in the Persian Gulf, but war
jitters have nearly doubled the price of crude oil to almost $40 a
barrel since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   In New York, the stock market fell 15 percent to its lowest
point in 16 months before rebounding somewhat Monday after the
federal budget compromise was reached. The Tokyo market is even
worse, plummeting about one-third and reaching a level below that
of the 1987 crash before regaining part of the loss today. In
London, stocks are down about more than 10 percent.
   So what happens if the real thing breaks out and bullets start
flying in the world's richest oilfields? What if Iraqi missiles
strike pipelines, pumping stations, oil ports or tankers in Saudi
Arabia? What if poison gas or germ warfare scatters oilfield
workers?
   ``It is not just thousands of lives that are at stake in a
shooting war. There is a risk of a real cataclysm for the global
economy,'' said Christopher Flavin, vice president of research at
Worldwatch Institute, a policy research organization.
   Worldwatch's projected casualty list means worldwide gas
rationing, the financial collapse of developing countries, outright
failure of the economic reforms in Eastern Europe and a severe
shock to the world banking system.
   Many experts believe doomsday anxieties are unfounded because
Iraq is unlikely to knock out Saudi exports. The Iraqis repeatedly
tried but failed to cripple Iran's Kharg Island loading terminal in
an eight-year war, and Iran had nothing resembling the U.S.-led,
high-tech shield protecting Saudi Arabia.
   But Iraq has vowed to fight ``the mother of all battles.'' The
Strait of Hormuz could become choked with mines, terrorists could
unleash hit squads and kamikaze pilots could fly missions against
oil terminals or tankers.
   And even though Iran fought a bloody war with Iraq, Iranians are
again shouting ``Death to America,'' so who knows what they might
do?
   Grab the financial flak jackets.
   The World Bank estimates a shooting war would boost oil prices
to $65 a barrel. Worldwatch said war could bring $80 prices, and
the former Saudi oil minister among others said it might even hit
$100.
   Superexpensive oil would trigger a financial chain reaction. The
immediate spike could mean gas pump prices of $2.50 a gallon or
higher, soaring electric bills and higher airline fares. Prices
would climb on oil-based products such as plastics,
pharmaceuticals, synthetic clothing and asphalt.
   There would also be the likely double whammy of recession. The
United States, the world's biggest oil user, has 6 percent of the
world's population and 3 percent of its oil reserves but consumes
26 percent of its oil.
   In a pinch, people are less likely to make major purchases such
as cars, houses, major appliances and discretionary clothing.
   ``A shooting war hits the consumer section very hard,'' said
Roger Brinner, chief economist for DRI-McGraw Hill. ``There's a
double blow to the economy from oil price shocks: the direct hit of
weaker purchasing power and a confidence shock.
   ``We were near a recession. We didn't need another shove in that
direcion,'' Brinner said.
   One other nasty effect of recession is joblessness.
   ``Saddam Hussein is going to throw a lot of people out of
work,'' said Joel Popkin, a consultant and inflation expert in
Washington.
   Popkin figures that every $10 increase in the price of a barrel
of oil means a 1 percent increase in the consumer price index just
in higher fuel costs, plus another 1 percent over six to nine
months in ripple effects.
   ``If the conflict is protracted without a definite conclusion,
oil prices are likely to stay around $40 for a year,'' Popkin said.
``The country would definitely be cast into a recession of some
magnitude, not just a shallow dip.''
   Complicating matters are budget and trade deficits, the savings
and loan bailout and shaky banking.
   Edwin Rothchild of Citizen Action, a Washington consumer group,
said of the aftershocks of a shooting war: ``You're talking about
stag-flation of enormous proportions. It's going to be a disaster
worldwide.''
   Two oil shocks in the 1970s caused gas lines, hoarding, limited
rationing and trucker discontent.
   But the United States is more dependent than ever on foreign
oil. It imports half its daily consumption of 16 million barrels a
day. One-fourth of the imports come from the Persian Gulf, a
powderkeg atop two-thirds of the world's oil reserves.
   Sixty-four percent of Japan's oil and 42 percent of Europe's
oil, excluding Great Britain, comes from there.
   There is one buffer: a 590 million barrel reserve in salt
caverns of Louisiana and Texas, which President Bush has tapped to
calm jitters. The reserve equals 73 days of all imports.
   Japan also has an oil reserve and has done a much better job
since the 1973 embargo. Virtually all the country's energy is
imported, but it has reduced its dependency on oil for energy from
77 percent to 57 percent by developing nuclear power and
conserving.
   Japan is the most efficient energy user among developed
countries, according to one Western analyst. The United States uses
2.5 times the commercial energy per person than Japan.

<HEAD>Apple, Sony Discuss Expanding Ties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID A. GROSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Apple Computer and Sony Corp. are discussing ways
to expand their business ties, a move which analysts expect will
lead to a strong alliance between the two divergent high-tech
companies.
   Officials from the two firms, however, refused Tuesday to
confirm reports that they are negotiating an agreement for Sony to
make personal computers in Japan to be marketed under Apple's name.
   A Sony official confirmed that the companies were engaged in
talks but said final details on the products and production volumes
were not yet decided.
   Sony now produces computer disk drives and displays for Apple.
   At a board meeting held in Tokyo last week, Apple Chief
Executive Officer John Sculley told reporters that his company is
seeking further ties with Japanese firms as it tries to expand its
still limited presence in the Japanese market.
   Apple was particularly interested in miniaturization, Sculley
said. He also said his firm lacked a low-priced, portable book-size
computer in its product line.
   Book-size computers are one of the fastest growing segments of
Japan's computer market.
   Sony, known best for its audio-visual and electronics devices,
has been unsuccessful in its attempt to break into the personal
computer market, said Darrel E. Whitten, an analyst for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   A tie with Apple could give it access to the American company's
advanced multimedia computing expertise and an opportunity to study
programming, he said.
   In turn, ``Apple's achilles' heel has been its manufacturers'
cost, and an agreement with Sony would give it greater control,''
he said.
   Chuck Goto, a technology analyst for S.G. Warburg Securities
(Japan), said computer hardware makers such as Apple have become
more dependent on integrated circuit technology, one of Sony's
strengths. The Japanese company also could offer experience in
converting analog to digital processes, he said.

<HEAD>House Approves Limiting TV Commercials On Kids' Shows</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House has sent legislation to President
Bush that would reinstate limits on commercial advertising on
children's television shows.
   The Bush administration opposes the legislation, saying it would
``create new and extremely serious First Amendment problems''
involving free speech.
   The bill was approved on voice vote Monday in the House without
dissent. It also has been approved by the Senate.
   The legislation would limit commercial advertising during
children's programming to 10{ minutes an hour on weekends and 12
minutes an hour on weekdays.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., said too many stations now allow
for 13 minutes to 17 minutes of advertising during each hour of
children's programming.
   The bill also would require the Federal Communications
Commission, in renewing the licenses of television stations, to
weigh how well broadcasters are serving the educational and
informational needs of children.
   And it would establish a federally funded National Endowment for
Children's Educational Television to subsidize the production of
children's programming. The endowment would be funded at $2 million
in 1991 and $4 million the next year.
   The legislation would effectively reverse the Reagan
administration's deregulation of the commercial content of
children's TV programming in 1984.
   Similar legislation was passed by both the House and Senate two
years ago, but it was vetoed by President Reagan after Congress had
adjourned.
   ``The limits which we propose are reasonable,'' said Rep. John
Bryant, D-Texas. ``I trust the support of various groups will
persuade our president that this bill fits into his program as a
kinder and gentler president who responds to family concerns.''
   The House Energy and Commerce Committee estimates that the
average child spends 10,000 to 15,000 hours in front of a
television - more time than in school - and is exposed to more than
200,000 TV commercials by the time he or she reaches age 18.
   Prior to the FCC's deregulation in 1984, broadcasters had
followed industry guidelines limiting ads in children's programming
to 9{ minutes an hour on weekends and 12 minutes an hour on
weekdays.
   Proponents said the commercial restrictions are necessary
because many children are unable to discriminate between ads and
programs until they reach the age of 4 or 5 and are unable to
recognize an advertising pitch as such until they are 7 or 8.

   Stocks continued their broad advance on Wall
Street today as oil prices resumed their slide.
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 25.99 to 2,541.83 as of
10 a.m. EDT.
   Advancing issues were ahead of decliners by a margin of about 5
to 1, with 984 stocks rising, 188 falling and 316 unchanged on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 41.06 million shares after the
first half-hour of trading.
   The November contract for light, sweet crude was off $1.09 at
$36.00 a barrel in early trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, following a plunge of $2.42 a barrel Monday.
   The drop in oil prices Monday helped spark a rally on Wall
Street that sent the Dow Jones average climbing more than 63
points. A decline in oil prices eases the threat of higher
inflation and increases the likelihood that the Federal Reserve
will allow interest rates to fall.
   General Electric led the NYSE most-active list, rising 1 to 57\.
   Among other blue chips, Philip Morris rose | to 48&rsqb;, IBM was up

   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 63.36 points
to 2,515.84, for its largest point gain since it rose 78.71 on Aug.
27.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 5 to 2 on the

   PepsiCo Inc. said Tuesday it has bought more
than 70 percent of Empresas Gamesa for about $300 million, giving
the big U.S. beverage and snack foods maker a majority stake in
Mexico's largest cookie manufacturer.
   The acquisition is PepsiCo's second largest international food
acquisition ever. It ranks behind the 1989 purchase of two British
snack chip makers, Smiths Crisps and Walkers Crisps, for $1.35
billion from the French company, BSN.
   The Mexican snack food subsidiary of PepsiCo, Sabritas SA de CV,
made the acquisition by buying over 70 percent of the outstanding
stock of Empresas Gamesa, which is a holding company that owns 68
percent of Grupo Gamesa, Mexico's major cookie company.
   The shares of Empresas Gamesa stock not bought by PepsiCo are
publicly held.
   ``We were attracted to this opportunity for making a significant
investment . . . by Mexico's considerable economic progress and its
government's commitment to free market policies,'' said Wayne
Calloway, chairman and chief executive officer of PepsiCo.
   Michael H. Jordan, president and chief executive officer of
PepsiCo's worldwide food operations, said PepsiCo plans to invest
more than $200 million in Gamesa and Sabritas over the next five
years as the two businesses expand their penetration further into
the Mexican snack foods market. Together, Gamesa and Sabritas will
have annual sales of almost $1 billion.
   PepsiCo, which has operations in 160 countries, has had a major
presence in Mexico for many years. It employs more than 14,000
people in that ountry, where its soft drinks have been
manufacturered and sold for over 50 years. PepsiCo's Pizza Hut and
Kentucky Fried Chicken businesses have been in Mexico for more than
20 years.

   Oil prices slid further this morning as traders
kept betting on the possibility of peace in the Persian Gulf.
   Light sweet crude was down $1.17 to $35.92 per barrel for
November contracts in late morning trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Contracts for crude delivery in later months
also traded lower.
   Energy analyst Thomas Blakeslee of Pegasus Econometric Group
Inc., in Hoboken, N.J., said today's move down was a continuation
of the sharp decline Monday, when oil fell by more than $2 per
barrel. Traders sold oil on the belief that antagonists in the
Middle East standoff were offering hints of a diplomatic solution
to the Gulf crisis.
   Traders said increased OPEC production and the U.S. decision to
tap its strategic reserve have also helped push prices lower.
   ``People are starting to realize that actual supply levels
aren't any lower than they were a year ago, or before the crisis,''
Blakeslee said.
   As crude fell, refined petroleum products also traded lower this
morning.
   Home heating oil dropped 1.68 cents to 98.35 cents a gallon for
November delivery, while unleaded gasoline was off 1.31 cents to
92.60 cents per gallon for November delivery. Later contract months
were lower for heating oil and gasoline.
   Natural gas was 2.1 cents higher, at $1.930 per 1,000 cubic feet
on November contracts. Later delivery months were trading lower.

   Grain and soybeans futures prices opened lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade but quickly reversed on updated
forecasts predicting rain.
   At first the market was depressed by continued selling from
yesterday's lows, which pushed futures prices lower as traders
worried about weak export demand and near-ideal harvest
temperatures.
   But new forecasts of wetter-than-normal conditions in the
Midwest over the new six to 10 days pushed soybean and corn futures
prices higher because it may slow harvesting.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 2 cents to 3 cents higher

<HEAD>Xerox Gambles on Machine That Copies, Faxes, Scans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Xerox Corp. today announced a new product
intended to revolutionize the office as much as the modern copying
machine it introduced 31 years ago.
   The new machine is a combination high-quality printer, image
scanner and fax machine that costs $220,000 and is aimed at large
corporations, universities and other businesses that produce
numerous documents.
   Xerox says the machine, called the DocuTech Production
Publisher, will replace offset printing presses and save companies
time and money in producing forms, reports and other documents.
   However, a model that will allow the DocuTech to connect to
desktop computers will not be available until the second half of
next year, disappointing some industry analysts.
   Nancy Erskine, an analyst at the research firm Gartner Group
Inc., in Stamford, Conn., said companies will need the networked
version of the machine to truly take advantage of its features.
Also, many companies lack the wiring between desktop machines that
would be necessary for them to connect with DocuTech, she said.
   Xerox predicts a huge market for DocuTech and says it already
has tested the machine at 28 companies and universities.
   Xerox said creation of DocuTech is a bid to put the copying
machine at the center of computer networks, even though it will be
next year before that can happen. Xerox calls the machine its most
important development since it introduced the automatic, plain
paper copier in 1959.
   Once the entire system is released, the souped-up copier would
allow computer users to push a button and order up magazine-quality
reproductions of a 50-page computerized report or to fax a document
to another computer user.
   In addition, the machine can electronically ``scan in'' paper
documents that then could be stored in a computer or manipulated on
a computer screen.
   The device is considered a gamble by Xerox, which has been
disappointed in the past by making technological breakthroughs only
to lose the market for them to competitors.
   For example, Xerox invented the personal computer, the
``user-friendly'' graphical software to run it and the computer
control device called the ``mouse,'' only to see them enrich
competitors who marketed them better.
   Eugene Glazer, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said the
research on DocuTech cost hundreds of millions of dollars.
   ``The people that have seen it are very impressed,'' he said.
But, he added, the market potential for the expensive device is
uncertain, especially in light of the sluggish economy.
   DocuTech represents an entry by Xerox into the fledging market
for ``imaging'' systems, which scan paper documents and photographs
to turn them into computer language that can be stored
electronically in much less space.

<HEAD>GE Blames Economy For Appliance Layoffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. officials said they
plan to lay off 450 to 500 hourly workers at its appliance
manufacturing complex in Louisville by Jan. 2 because of the
nation's softening economy.
   Company spokesman Jim Allen said the economy has forced a change
in GE's sales forecast for the rest of this year and for 1991.
Allen said the economy would have to make an unlikely turnaround to
forestall the job cuts.
   ``We're looking at a major appliance industry finishing this
year 3 to 5 percent down, and falling off another 3 to 5 percent in
1991,'' Allen said Monday.
   Housing starts, at their lowest level in several years, are a
key reason for the sluggishness, he said.
   Consumer polls indicate fewer people expect to buy such durable
goods as the refrigerators, ranges, washers, dryers and dishwashers
produced at the company's Appliance Park plant.
   Allen said the appliance division's sales already have begun to
bear out that pessimistic forecast.
   ``They're starting to drop off,'' he said. ``This is not just a
thing we're forecasting. We're experiencing it.''
   Allen said employment at Appliance Park is now about 10,800 -
8,800 hourly and 2,000 salaried. That is just under half of its
peak employment, which was about 22,000 in 1973.
   Much of the plant's business is tied directly to the housing
industry, and rises and falls with it.

<HEAD>Guinness Judge Rejects Tycoon's Appeal of Fine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge on Tuesday rejected Gerald Ronson's appeal
of his $9.2 million fine in the Guinness scandal case, saying rich
men must not be beyond punishment of the law.
   Justice Denis Henry rejected Ronson's claim that the fine, the
largest in British history, was too great and could not be paid in
nine months as the court demanded.
   Ronson, 51, was found guilty last month, along with former
Guinness chairman Ernest Saunders and stockbroker Anthony Parnes,
of fraudulently engineering Guinness' 1986 takeover of a Scottish
distiller.
   ``Punishments are, after all, intended to be punitive, and the
court must ensure that a man's wealth and power does not put him
beyond punishment,'' the judge said at a hearing.
   Ronson, 51, will have another chance to appeal the fine through
the Appeal Court.
   Saunders, 55, was sentenced to five years in prison and Parnes,
45, received 2{ years in jail for their part in the case, which
involved boosting Guinness shares during the company's takeover of
the firm Distillers.
   Saunder and Parnes are also appealing their fines.

   President Bush said today he would give a
televised address to the nation at 9 p.m. EDT tonight to press his
case for a $500 billion deficit-cutting package.
   Bush announced the speech himself at a meeting with a group of
business leaders as the White House launched a major effort to sell
the bipartisan package unveiled on Sunday.
   Earlier, he met with a group of skeptical and undecided
Republican House members. Some participants at the meeting said
that several lawmakers urged Bush to give a televised address to
the nation.
   ``This budget agreement is our last best chance to get the
federal budget deficit under control,'' Bush told the business
leaders. ``You can pick the package apart, but you cannot
realistically put a better package together.''
   Bush said it was important for ``Congress to act and act soon on
this vital legislation.''
   ``I don't want to sound sanctimonious about this, but I was
elected to govern,'' he said.
   The White House said Bush's speech to the nation would last
about 10 minutes.
   Although Bush campaigned against new taxes and for a lower
capital gains tax rate, he said, ``the philosophy I was elected on
runs out of gas in terms of votes in the United States Congress.''
   Earlier, lawmakers who met with the president said that deep
divisions remain in Congress on the measure.
   ``I'm undecided. So's the nation,'' said Rep. Robert Dornan,
R-Calif, after the first of three sessions between Bush and GOP
lawmakers.
   Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., said Bush had not changed his mind
and he still was likely to vote against the package.
   But Rep. Thomas Coleman, R-Mo., said he was persuaded by the
president to support the package. ``It's the only ball game in
town,'' he said. ``If this goes down, you're going to see chaos,''
he said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that some
Republicans up for re-election told the president that supporting
the package ``will be tough. But they promised to consider it.''
   ``It has opposition,'' he conceded. ``We need time to work it.''
   Fitzwater said that for all Americans, the proposed agreement
``is paying the bills. And paying the bills is never fun.''
   Fitzwater earlier said that Bush would make a strong pitch for
the bipartisan budget accord unveiled over the weekend.
   ``We'll be talking in very strong terms to all the members about
how important this is,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``He's going to be twisting arms and cajoling and telling people
that if you are not supportive of this, we ask you to take another
look and think anew,'' Fitzwater said.
   In its two-day life span, the plan has drawn barbs from
lawmakers - Democrats and Republicans - wary of voting for a record
amount of tax increases and spending cuts in an election year.
   Fitzwater also said Bush also planned to give speeches around
the country in the coming weeks.
   ``He'll be all over the place,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``The president will go to the nation, he will go around the
country in one speech after another and lay out what's in this
package,'' Fitzwater said.
   Missing from the list of those invited to the White House today
was one of the most outspoken critics of the compromise, House
Republican Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.
   However, Fitzwater said that nothing should be read into the
fact that Gingrich's name had been omitted.
   Bush already talked to Gingrich, the spokesman said, ``and we'll
talk to him again.''
   ``We're talking to everybody,'' Fitzwater said. ``There are a
lot of people who disagree with this, a lot of people have trouble
with it and they need to be convinced. And we're doing our best.''
   ``The deficit must be dealt with and it's not an easy fix,''
Fitzwater said.
   ``Everybody knew this deficit-reduction agreement was an ugly
duckling,'' said Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate
Budget Committee. ``Nobody expected it to sprout wings and fly like
a swan.''
   But Bush put an optimistic face on prospects of approval. ``It
will all work out. Everybody will do what's right,'' he told
reporters.
   Congressional leaders planned a series of votes over the next
three weeks to etch the compromise plan into law. But reluctance to
support the package comes from members of both parties.
   Rpublicans are leery of its $134 billion in new taxes on
gasoline, alcohol, tobacco, airline tickets, incomes of the wealthy
and other items. They also complained that defense cuts of up to
$182 billion were too deep and that domestic programs were not
pared enough.
   Numerous Democrats don't like the package's $105 billion in
spending reductions for benefit programs such as Medicare and the
fact that many of the taxes - such as those on gasoline and alcohol
- take a deep bite out of poor peoples' incomes.
   And lawmakers of both parties from cold-weather states are
furious over the plan's inclusion of a tax on home heating oil.
   Sensing that lawmakers would be more willing to embrace the plan
if it was supported by the public, congressional Democrats called
Monday for Bush to take to the airwaves to sell it to the voters.
   ``We've put together the pain,'' said Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga.,
who was one of the bargainers during four months of budget
negotiations this year. ``Now it's his job.''

   Farmers should prepare themselves for lower
target prices, as Congress looks for ways to cut the agriculture
budget by $13 billion over the next five years, farm organization
officials say.
   Government officials said Monday that the cuts would be painful,
although no one could give details yet on how the cut agreed to by
White House and congressional negotiators to reduce the deficit
would be accomplished.
   ``We want the target prices to stay at the current levels, but
it would be difficult, if not impossible, to make the magnitude of
cuts they have to make without doing something on the target
prices,'' said Don Lipton, media relations director for the
American Farm Bureau Federation.
   ``They said they were going to freeze target prices, (but)
there's no way with this budget agreement that can happen,'' said
David Senter, national director of American Agriculture Movement.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, who helped negotiate the agreement
said ``agriculture has taken a tough hit.''
   ``Any cut in USDA's budget is painful for our farmers and
ranchers,'' said Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter. ``However,
we have no oter alternative as a country but to reduce our federal
budget deficit.''
   Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,
said: ``We will all have to make deep and painful cuts in many
important programs to pay for a deficit caused by the S&amp;L scandal
and the freewheeling economic policies and tax giveaways of the
1980s.''
   ``Unfortunately, the people who had the party aren't the ones
paying the tab,'' said Leahy.
   Yeutter said farmers would be willing to take their share of the
cuts as long as they are fair.
   ``In the short run, these budget reductions, coupled with rising
fuel costs will squeeze agriculture hard,'' he said. ``We will have
to tighten our belts, and that is not easily done. But in the long
run, we will all be better off if we can restore fiscal sanity to
this nation.''
   The cuts ``will be as fair as possible,'' said Leahy, who also
chairs the House-Senate conference committee working on the 1990
farm bill.
   The farm bills approved by the House and Senate call for $54
billion in spending on commodities subsidies over the next five
years.
   Under the budget agreement, that figure must be cut 25 percent,
with about $1.3 billion coming out of the budget for the 1991
fiscal year, which began Monday.
   The problem this year is that all but about $2.92 billion of the
amount budgeted for fiscal 1991 is payment on expenses carried over
from 1990 that cannot be eliminated.
   That means it might be back to the drawing board on commodity
support programs in the farm bill, said several aides close to the
process.
   ``We don't want to see target prices dropped, but we'd rather
see target prices go down than loan rates go up,'' said Lipton of
the Farm Bureau.
   Loan rates are the amount farmers can borrow from the government
by using their crops as collateral. Thus, the loans are a support
or a guaranteed floor price for the commodities.
   Farmers have the option of forfeiting their crops - collateral -
and canceling the debt if market prices are low, or paying off the
loan and selling or using the commodities when market prices
improve.
   The administration and others favoring market-oriented programs,
say high loan rates result in government ownership of surplus
commodities that should be moving into export at world prices.
   Lipton said the agriculture industry as a whole won't suffer
extremely if cuts are made. It's not as dependent on government
programs as it was in the mid-80s, he said.
   Lipton said many farmers no longer participate in government
programs, either because their farms are so big, they can sustain
themselves even when market prices are low or because they are
smaller, speciality operations.
   However, Leland Swenson, president of National Farmers Union,
said the $13 billion slash in USDA programs would ``throw the farm
sector into a tailspin.''
   ``Farmers are facing disastrous grain prices, higher input costs
as the result of oil prices, and now $13 billion in cuts that will
come directly out of farm income under the 1990 farm bill
structure,'' Swenson said.
   ``You've got some new variables to work with now. The Mideast
situation, falling wheat prices and now budget cuts have all come
to roost since the farm bill passed the two houses,'' he said.

<HEAD>Poll Names Seattle Best Place to Establish a Business</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Top Cities-List</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the eyes of corporate executives, the
Northwest's biggest city is the best place in the nation to locate
a business, elbowing out Atlanta for the top spot in an annual
survey.
   About one-third of the 400 executives polled ranked Seattle as
``excellent,'' citing quality of life for employees and the
likelihood that economic conditions will improve over the next
year.
   Seattle finished second last year behind Atlanta in the survey
by the commercial real estate firm Cushman &amp; Wakefield. Atlanta
dropped to sixth this year.
   ``I don't know whether we thought we'd stay No. 1 forever,''
said Roy Cooper, vice president of economic development for the
Atlanta Chamber of Commerce. Atlanta had held the survey's top spot
for the first four years the survey was conducted.
   Second place in this year's survey went to Sacramento, Calif.,
which was 15th last year, while Portland, Ore., moved up from 27th
place to third. Rounding out the top 10 were Norfolk, Va., San
Diego, Atlanta, Columbus, Ohio, Dallas-Fort Worth, Minneapolis-St.
Paul and Tampa, Fla.
   Texas and other ``oil-patch'' cities made sizeable jumps in the
survey. In addition to Dallas-Fort Worth, which was 17th last year,
cities moving up the scale were San Antonio (11th from 22nd),
Houston (15th from 26th), Denver (17th from 28th), and New Orleans
(22nd from 31st).
   Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, Denver and San Antonio all made the
top five list of where CEOs believe general business conditions
will improve in the next 12 months, Cushman &amp; Wakefield said.
   By contrast, heavily populated and industrialized cities showed
significant drops in the survey. Baltimore fell from 10th place to
27th, Chicago from fourth to 14th, Los Angeles from ninth to 20th,
New York from 12th to 28th, Philadelphia from 18th to 30th and
Washington from 11th to 21st. The cities tended to score poorly on
quality of life.
   Cities were rated on access to markets and customers, the cost
and availability of labor, cost and expandability of office space,
availability of manufacturing sites with existing services, access
to raw materials and the governmental climate.
   Seattle finished first in quality of life. It also was praised
for a skilled labor force and access to Canadian and Pacific Rim
trade.
   Seattle's access to international air and water shipping gives
it an advantage over other cities, said Robert Fulton, president of
Generic Software. However, he and others said labor shortages in
certain skill classifications have created some problems. ``A lot
of things are being done in remedying that situation,'' Fulton
said.
   Despite those shortages, the region's labor costs are still
considered good, said Reidun Crowley, manager of community and
economic development at Puget Sound Power &amp; Light, said of the
business survey.
   ``People do want to come here and quality of life has a lot to
do with that,'' he said.
   Seattle also fared well in a recent Money Magazine survey of the
nation's most livable cities, ranking second behind its neighbor
across Puget Sound, Bremerton, Wash.
   Asked to select American cities outside the top 31 that are
attractive for business, the CEOs most often cited Charlotte, N.C.,
which earned the distinction for the fourth year in a row. Other
cities that scored high in that category were Raleigh-Durham, N.C.,
Orlando, Fla., and Nashville, Tenn.

   Wall Street's rally carried over to another
session today as oil prices continued to drop, but some traders
began to take profits and stocks gave up some of their gains.
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 15.60 to 2,531.44 as of
2 p.m. EDT after having been up around 25 points for much of the
day.
   Advancing issues were ahead of decliners by a margin of about 3
to 1, with 1,156 stocks rising, 394 falling and 413 unchanged on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 142.03 million shares at
midafternoon.
   Analysts said today's advance was a continuation of Monday's
rally, when the Dow Jones industrial average soared more than 63
points. But nervous traders, fearing the market might resume a
bearish course, began to take profits from the two-day advance
while they could.
   The big impetus for buying was again a drop in oil prices. The
November contract for light, sweet crude was off $2.39 at $34.70 a
barrel in midafternoon trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
following a plunge of $2.42 a barrel Monday.
   A decline in energy costs eases the threat of higher inflation
and increases the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will allow
interest rates to fall.
   Stock prices also surged in Tokyo early today, with the Nikkei
Stock Average of 225 selected issues climbing 2,676.55 points, or
13.24 percent, to 22,898.41. The gain, the index's largest one-day
advance, helped set a positive tone on Wall Street, analysts said.
   Unisys led the NYSE most-active list, falling } to 4\.
   Among other blue chips, Philip Morris rose &rsqb; to 48&lsqb;, IBM was up
| to 109|, and Boeing rose &rsqb; to 44|.
   Retailers, some of the most oversold issues in recent weeks,
were among today's big gainers. J.C. Penney rose 1{ to 44~ and
Woolworth was up 1{ to 25{.
   UAL shot up 9} to 113&lsqb; on a report that the lead banks in the
proposed employee buyout of the parent of United Airlines were
making progress in getting other lenders to help finance the deal.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.75 to 173.97. On the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.20 to 309.64.

   Grains and soybeans closed higher Tuesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade, recovering from sharp losses a day earlier
as harvest pressures eased amid forecasts of rain and reports of
new export sales.
   Grain and soybeans futures prices opened lower on follow-through
selling from Monday but quickly reversed on updated forecasts
predicting rain in the regions where they are grown, analysts said.
   ``There were new forecasts of rains coming in over the next
couple of days,'' said Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research
Department Inc. ``Plus, there was a smattering of support from
export business - some countries tendering small amounts for
supplies.''
   Traders in the past week have been worried about slow export
demand in the face of a possible record grains and soybean harvest
and near-ideal harvesting temperatures.
   An outlook for wetter-than-normal conditions in the Midwest and
the Cornbelt over the next six to 10 days pushed soybean and corn
futures prices higher because the rain may slow harvesting.
   Wheat futures prices also rose on spillover support from the
other two markets.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1{ cents to 4{ cents higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $2.71} a bushel; corn
was 2\ cents to 3\ cents higher with December at $2.25\ a bushel;
oats were 2 cents to 3} cents higher with December at $1.23 a
bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 6{ cents higher with November at

   These controversial choice and reproduction issues already have
been debated in court, with conflicting rulings.
   This year, the California Supreme Court upheld a ruling against
Johnson in which a lower court said, in part: ``We are in an era of
choice. A woman is not required to become a Victorian brood mare.''
   But in 1989, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals supported Johnson,
saying it is ``reasonably necessary to the industrial safety-based
concern of protecting the unborn child from lead exposure.''
   Judge Frank Easterbrook dissented in that ruling, being appealed
to the high court. He called it likely the most important
sex-discrimination case since the 1964 enactment of Title VII,
which barred sexual bias in employment.
   Some business leaders say the potential impact is exaggerated,
but Mrs. Seymore disagrees.
   ``I'm not fighting only for me,'' she said. ``This is for all
women.''

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. has begun pitching
its new Saturn car to the public, in an effort to increase its
visibility before it finally hits the road.
   Commercials produced by Hal Riney &amp; Partners of San Francisco
began airing last week during prime news and late-night slots in
the Southeast and California.
   ``Basically, we're trying to sell the Saturn story ahead of the
product,'' said Donald Hudler, Saturn vice president of sales,
service and marketing.
   The Saturn is an important development for GM, the nation's No.
1 automaker, which made the car to win back a chunk of the market
lost to Japanese competitors.
   The project has been shrouded in secrecy since its inception
eight years ago. Originally introduced as a boxlike subcompact car
to sell for $6,000 to $8,000, it now has more interior room, more
features and will sell for $10,000 to $12,000.
   It's slated to be introduced on Oct. 25.
   Six spots showing Saturn and employees from its $1.9 billion
Spring Hill, Tenn., plant will air for several weeks.
   GM hopes the ads will make the car more popular.
   ``Very few people - other than in Tennessee and Detroit - know
about Saturn,'' said Pat Sherwood, vice president and group account
director for Hal Riney. One survey showed only 1 percent of
Saturn's target group could name the car without prompting.
   ``(The first commercials) are directed at telling people the
values and philosophies of Saturn and the things that make Saturn
as a company unique and how those things will make Saturn a better
car,'' he said.

expensive cars, yachts, jewelry and furs, as well as wine and
liquor - discriminates against their well-heeled clientele.
   Though they protest, many are bracing themselves for a flurry of
sales as customers weigh the costs and benefits of putting an extra
case of champagne or a pair of sapphire earrings on their tabs for
the upcoming holidays.
   The taxes, if approved, could begin taking effect Jan. 1 as part
of a federal budget agreement reached over the weekend.
   ``In all likelihood there will be a measurable increase in the
sales of jewelry above $5,000 before the end of the year simply
because buyers will recognize that such items will cost more next
year,'' Ralph Destino, chairman of Cartier Inc., said Tuesday.
   For jewelry, plans call for a 10 percent tax on the amount over
$5,000. That means buyers would pay $6,100 for a diamond brooch
that sells for $6,000 today. ``Historically there has always been
an upward blip on the eve of any new tax increase,'' Destino said.
   David H. Resler, chief economistat Nomura Securities
International Inc., plans to ``stock my wine cellar for the next
three years,'' adding that consumers might stock up on
easy-to-store items.
   For Home Liquors Inc., the pickup in sales was ``pretty
significant'' when higher taxes took effect in New Jersey in the
1980s, said Bill Kenny, who manages the company's Astor Wines &amp;
Spirits store in Manhattan.
   The government wants to raise the tax on wine by 22 cents a
bottle and boost the tax on a bottle of 80-proof liquor by 24
cents.
   But Kenny said that just because the tax goes up, ``at the
retail level there will be discretion over whether we want to
increase'' prices. The price of Dom Perignon, a top-of-the-line
champagne that sells for $810 a case, ``is just too crucial to
raise,'' he said, particularly at holiday time when corporations
and wealthy individuals buy clusters of cases at a time.
   Kenny envisions ``tremendous work'' ahead since he will have to
decide on an individual basis whether to raise the price on a line
of wine or liquor or whether the store will cut its profit to keep
prices attractive to customers.
   Because many luxury goods are imported, their price is also
dictated by the value of the dollar, which has taken a hit this
year against most foreign currencies. A year ago, Kenny said, a
case of Dom Perignon sold for ``somewhere in the $700s.''
   At Continental Motors Inc., a Mercedes-Benz dealership in
suburban Fairfield, Conn., salesman Latka said several customers
want him to rush their orders through to make sure they beat the
increase, even though it could be modified.
   When Connecticut raised taxes by a half a percentage point a few
years ago, Latka said Mercedes sales jumped 20 percent, and that
could happen again.
   The average price of a Mercedes-Benz is $50,000, making it
liable to the proposed tax, which hits the amount of the purchase
price in excess of $30,000.
   ``This is something very much biased against luxury cars,''
Latka said. But he said the decision to buy a Mercedes is probably
based more on the fortunes of the stock market than the level of
taxes.
   The tax increase is not expected do much to bolster furriers,
who have been suffering from weak sales amid a lackluster economy
and a publicity campaign waged by anti-fur activists.
   Furthermore, most furriers contend that a decent fur can be had
for about $5,000 while the tax only applies to the amount above
that level. ``You can find a lot of good things at that price,''
said Tony Marinakos of Marinakos Furs in Beverly Hills, Calif. Very
stylish mink, linx and sable coats, though, generally sell for
about $10,000.

   Prices closed mixed on Wall Street today as
nervous traders took their profits late in the day and ended the
market's broad advance.
   Prices were higher - with the Dow Jones industrial average
climbing as much as 49 points - until early afternoon as the stock
market responded to another plunge in oil futures prices. The
November contract for light, sweet crude skidded $3.14 to $33.95 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, following a plunge of
$2.42 a barrel Monday.
   A decline in energy costs eases the threat of higher inflation
and increases the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will allow
interest rates to fall.
   Analysts also attributed today's early advance to
``follow-through'' buying after Monday's rally in which the Dow
Jones average soared more than 63 points. But traders feared the
market might resume its recent bearish course and began to take
profits from the two-day advance while they could.
   Stock prices also surged in Tokyo early today, with the Nikkei
Stock Average of 225 selected issues climbing 2,676.55 points, or
13.24 percent, to 22,898.41. The gain, the index's largest one-day
advance, helped set a positive tone on Wall Street, analysts said.

<TEXT>
   A manufacturer of the Army's main tactical
field radio was ordered Tuesday to pay $3.8 million for conspiring
to defraud the government on defense contracts by falsifying
reliability test results.
   E-Systems Inc. of Dallas received the sentence from U.S.
District Judge William Terrell Hodges after formally pleading
guilty to a three-count criminal information.
   Prosecutors charged the company repeatedly altered performance
records and concealed repairs and defects in tests of the field
radios to ensure the Army would accept and pay for them.
   The investigation began in 1985 after the Army ended two
E-Systems contracts to build radios at its Memcor Division in
Bushnell. The company had been building the Army's principal
vehicle-carried field radios since 1969.
   E-Systems appealed the termination, and the testing program
irregularities were noticed at that time. The company later sued
the government over the termination.
   In its plea, E-Systems agreed to pay a $2 million criminal fine
and $1.8 million in restitution. The company also is to drop its
pending $38 million lawsuit against the government.
   In addition, the company will pay $850,000 to cover any
potential civil claims the government may bring.
   In August, three former managers and a former supervisor at
Memcor were indicted on charges of repeatedly falsifying records
and test results to conceal failures and defects in the radios.
   In January, a front-line production supervisor, Sadonna S.
Hobbs, was convicted of perjury relating to her denials of this
activity. She is serving a 16-month prison sentence.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Post Dramatic Gains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLIFF EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Precious metals posted an impressive turnaround
from weeks of sharp loss Tuesday amid gains on the Japanese stock
market and new confidence in the U.S. economy, analysts said.
   On other commodity markets, energy futures extended their
decline; grains and soybeans were higher; cattle futures were
lower; and pork futures were sharply higher.
   Platinum had the strongest gains, followed by gold and silver.
Platinum on the New York Mercantile Exchange settled $16.80 to
$17.20 higher with the contract for delivery in October at $443.60.
   Gold settled $1.60 to $2.50 higher on New York's Commodity
Exchange with October at $389.10 a troy ounce. Silver settled 3.3
cents to 3.9 cents higher with October at $4.68 an ounce.
   Silver and platinum were long overdue to rebound from sharp
losses and rose amid new perceptions that the crisis in the Middle
East might be settled through diplomatic means, analysts said.
   ``Crude oil declined sharply, so today's economy looked a little
better and people moved their money to safety,'' said Bette
Raptopoulos, senior metals analyst with Prduential-Bache Securities
Inc. in New York. ``The rally in Japan also meant they had more
money to buy metals.''
   Speculators turn toward precious metals during a strong economy
period because of inflationary fears.
   A weaker dollar supported the gains, analysts said, but added
they could be quickly lost if crude oil prices rise during
escalating tensions in the Persian Gulf.
   Energy futures prices extended their slide after traders
speculated that President Bush's speech Monday at the United Nation
means there may be room for talks on the Middle East crisis.
   Light sweet crude oil settled $3.14 to $1.30 lower with November
at $33.95 a barrel; heating oil was 8 cents to 4 cents lower with
November at 92.03 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 6.98 cents
to 4 cents lower with November at 86.93 cents a gallon.
   Grains and soybeans closed higher on the Chicago Board of Trade,
recovering from sharp losses a day earlier as harvest pressures
eased amid forecasts of rain and reports of new export sales.
   Grain and soybeans futures prices opened lower on follow-through
selling from Monday but quickly reversed on updated forecasts
predicting rain in the regions where they are grown, said Joel
Karlin, an analyst with Research Deparmtent Inc.
   ``There were new forecasts of rains coming in over the next
couple of days,'' Karlin said. ``Plus, there was a smattering of
support from export business - some countries tendering small
amounts for supplies.''
   Traders in the past week have been worried about slow export
demand in the face of a possible record grains and soybean harvest
and near-ideal harvesting temperatures.
   An outlook for wetter-than-normal conditions in the Midwest and
the Cornbelt over the next six to 10 days pushed soybean and corn
futures prices higher because harvesting may be slowed.
   Wheat futures prices also rose on spillover support from the
other two markets.
   Wheat futures settld 2{ cents to 5 cents higher with December at
$2.72\ a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 2} cents higher with December
at $2.25\ a bushel; oats were 3{ cents to 3} cents higher with
December at $1.23 a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents to 3{ cents
higher with November at $6.06\ a bushel.
   Cattle futures prices settled lower and hog futures were sharply
higher on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Frozen pork bellies futures prices closed at their trading
limits after speculators continued to react favorably to Friday's
release of the Agriculture Department's quarterly hogs and pigs
report, which showed slower-than-expected growth in the breeding
herd and a decline in market hogs.
   Cattle turned lower amid profit-taking and reports of sluggish
beef demand.
   Live cattle settled .45 cent to .05 cent lower with October at
79.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .83 cent to .30 cent lower
with October at 87.82 cents a pound; hogs were .12 cent lower to
.87 cent higher with October at 56.20 cents a pound; pork bellies
closed at its trading limit 2 cents higher with February at 62.20
cents a pound.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interstate Commerce Commission agreed
Tuesday to approve the sale of the Delaware &amp; Hudson Railway to
Canadian Pacific Ltd. for $25 million.
   The ICC voted 4-0 to authorize the sale of the D&amp;H and certain
trackage rights, said commission spokesman Dennis Watson.
   The matter now goes back to the bankruptcy court that's been
overseeing reorganization of the financially troubled railroad,
Watson said.
   Francis P. Dicello, the court-appointed bankruptcy trustee,
accepted CP's $25 million bid in May. A bankruptcy judge sitting in
Wilmington, Del., approved the sale pending ICC approval and
completion of union negotiations with D&amp;H workers.
   The Canadian carrier took over operation of the freight line in
August and agreed to absorb any further financial losses.
   Dicello, who had been running the railroad since February, said
in June that the carrier had been losing about $200,000 a month.
   D&amp;H, the nation's oldest continually operated railroad, filed in
July 1988 for protection from its creditors. It owes about $100
million.
   The D&amp;H carries freight from Montreal to Washington, D.C., and
from Albany to Buffalo, N.Y.

<HEAD>Dollar Down in U.S.; Gold Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar dropped against all major currencies
in uneventful U.S. trading Tuesday after moving mostly higher
overseas.
   Gold prices skidded on European and Asian markets. But gold
gained modestly in the United States as the previous day's selloff
here subsidied.
   Currency dealers could not put their fingers on precisely why
the dollar weakened in the United States. But they said trading
volume was light, indicating sellers lacked conviction.
   A widespread belief that U.S. interest rates eventually will
move lower as the economy struggles to stay out of a recession was
offered as a possible reason for the diminished demand for dollars.
   Lower U.S. interest rates would make returns on
dollar-denominated holdings less appealing and could steer money
into higher-yielding foreign investments.
   The chances that U.S. rates will fall have risen since White
House and congressional negotiators reached agreement on a fiscal
1991 budget.
   Another slide in oil prices Tuesday helped ease inflation fears
and also possibly curbed interest in dollars. The contract for
November delivery of light, sweet crude tumbled $3.14 a barrel to
$33.95 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Unleaded gasoline and
home heating prices also closed down sharply.
   If the slide continues, the oil price retreat is expected to
give the Federal Reserve Board greater leeway to relax its monetary
policy. The central bank's mission is to promote economic growth
while keeping inflation at bay.
   The dollar moved ahead against most of its foreign counterparts
in European trading centers. But earlier in Asia, the dollar lost
ground.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.42 yen to a closing 136.73 yen.
Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 137.00 yen. In New York,
the dollar traded at 136.72 yen, down slightly from 136.75 yen late
Monday.
   The British pound fetched $1.8890 late in London, the same as
Monday's late rate. In New York, it cost $1.8930 to buy one pound,
up from $1.8830 late Monday.
   Other dollar rates late in New York, compared with Monday's late
quotes included: 1.5495 German marks, down from 1.55735; 1.2885
Swiss francs, down from 1.2960; 5.1915 French francs, down from
5.2195; 1,160.75 Italian lire, down from 1,167.25; and 1.15265
Canadian dollars, down from 1.153825.
   Late European dollar rates compared with Monday's late levels,
were: 1.5540 German marks, up from 1.5520; 1.2900 Swiss francs, up
from 1.2885; 5.2050 French francs, up from 5.1985; 1.7502 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.7495; 1,162.75 Italian lire, down from
1,163.50; and 1.1532 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1526.
   The declines posted in the price of gold overseas followed a
steep tumble in the United States on Monday.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for October
delivery settled at $389.10 a troy ounce, up $2.50 from Monday's
close. The contract sank more than $15 on Monday. Republic National
Bank in New York quoted a late gold bid of $389, $1.10 higher than
Monday's 4 p.m. EDT bid.
   Late in London, gold traded at $388.75 an ounce, compared with
$395.25 late Monday. In Zurich, Switzerland, the late gold bid was
$388.60, down from $396.60 late Monday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold
fell $10.82 to close at a bid of $387.25.
   Silver prices were unchanged to up slightly. On the Comex,
silver bullion for October delivery settled at $4.679 a troy ounce,
up from Monday's settlement of $4.64. In London, silver traded late
at a bid of $4.72 a troy ounce, equaling late Monday's $4.72.

   Nervous traders, mindful of the continuing
Persian Gulf crisis, took their profits and cut short a two-day
surge on Wall Street Tuesday.
   Prices closed mixed after having been broadly higher until early
afternoon.
   The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 industrials, up about 25
points for the first half of the day, closed down 10.64 at
2,505.20.
   But broader measures of the market's performance ended the day
on the plus side.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a margin of about 5 to
3 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks,
with 1,014 up, 582 down and 427 unchanged.
   Analysts said Tuesday's early advance was a continuation of
Monday's rally, when the Dow Jones average soared more than 63
points in response to a plunge in oil prices. But nervous traders,
fearing the market might resume a bearish course amid the
uncertainties surrounding the Gulf, began to take profits from the
two-day advance while they could.
   As they sold their holdings, traders ignored another, sharper
drop in oil prices that raised prospects for a slowing of inflation
and a decline in interest rates.
   The November contract for light, sweet crude skidded $3.14 to
$33.95 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, following a
plunge of $2.42 a barrel on Monday.
   Analysts said they were not surprised by the turnaround on Wall
Street. Hildegarde Zagorski, and analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., commented that she had been looking at the market
moving up in an almost straight line for two days, and that some
profit-taking was inevitable.
   Stock prices surged in Tokyo Tuesday, with the Nikkei Stock
Average of 225 selected issues climbing 2,676.55 points, or 13.24
percent, to 22,898.41. The gain, the index's largest one-day
advance, helped set a positive tone on Wall Street, analysts said.
   The most-active issue on the NYSE was Unisys, off 1&lsqb; to 3~. The
company's stock is taking a heavy toll from Unisys' announcement
last week that it was suspending its common stock dividend.
   Polaroid was up 2| to 33&lsqb; while Kodak dropped 1| to 38 amid
rumors the two companies were close to a settlement in Polaroid's
patent infringement case against Kodak.
   Retailing stocks that have been struggling lately had a
turnaround. J.C. Penney picked up 1| to 45, while Woolworth
advanced 1&lsqb; to 25&lsqb;.
   UAL shot up 8| to 112 on a report that the lead banks in the
proposed employee buyout of the parent of United Airlines were
making progress in getting other lenders to help finance the deal.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 188.32 million
shares, down from 202.21 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 225.48 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $8.955 billion, or 0.30
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.37 to 172.59.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 0.51 to 371.05, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index advanced 0.27 to 315.21.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
1.75 to 356.97. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 309.63, up 1.19.

   May will distribute 0.13 shares of common stock of Venture per
share of May common stock to holders of record on Oct. 15. After
the spinoff, May will own no more shares of Venture common stock.
   Originally, the company planned to offer 15 percent of the stock
to the public, but canceled that in August because of the condition
of the stock market, said company spokesman Jim Abrams.
   The market has been dragged down since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait

   May expects to distribute approximately 16 million shares of
Venture common stock in the spin-off, which was announced last
October. There are approximately 123 million shares of May stock

<TEXT>
   Apple Computer Inc. plans to offer
cheaper versions of its Macintosh machine as part of a strategy to
win market share that Chairman John Sculley hopes will help the
company withstand a recession.
   The plan begins with three new Macintosh computers to be
introduced Oct. 15 accompanied by a $40 million advertising
campaign.
   The Macintosh Classic, comparable to the popular $2,569 SE
model, will carry a list price of about $1,000 and a street price
as low as $700 to $800, according to sources close to Apple.
   The other two models, available with color monitors, will be
listed at about $3,000 and $5,000, or several thousand dollars less
than comparable Macintoshes in the current line.
   ``The basic strategy is to go after (a larger) share of the
market,'' Sculley said at a preview of the campaign. ``We have no
sacred cows as far as pricing. This means that this will be the
most aggressive pricing that Apple has ever had.
   ``In a weak economy, as the United States certainly is in, it's
a lot more reassuring to be introducing three major products at
price points that are going to be extremely affordable.''
   Critics of Apple have long complained that its Macintosh line,
which ranges from $1,799 for the MacPlus to $11,000 for the FX, is
too expensive. Apple's gross margins on those products is about 50
percent, one of the highest in the industry, Sculley said.
   As a result, Apple has racked up profits but stagnated with only
about 9 percent of the desktop computer market. Inexpensive
``clones'' of International Business Machines Corp. personal
computers have dominated the low end of the market.
   The Windows software program from Microsoft, which gives IBM
computers the ``look and feel'' of the Macintosh, also has forced
Apple to examine how it can distinguish itself.
   ``For us to be really successful in the 1990s, we want to have
much more than a 9 percent share'' Sculley said. He declined to say
what share of the market he is aiming for or what gross margins
he'll be satisfied with.
   Apple, which does nearly half of its business outside the United
States, is introducing its new computers simultaneously in 121
countries. The company expects the computers to be a hit especially
in Japan, where Apple's business has been doubling annually.
   ``Part of our business has been extremely strong,'' Sculley
said. ``We've continued to gain market share with our
high-performance modular Macs in business. While we clearly had
some need for freshening up at the low end of our product line, the
high end is very resilient and strong.''
   Apple will adjust its prices throughout its Macintosh line, but
it is not abandoning its top models.
   ``I want to make sure this isn't seen as a flip-flop, (as if)
we're now only in low-end systems,'' said Michael Spindler, Apple's
chief operating officer. ``We don't want to divest from markets. We
want to invest to make this a much broader growth business for
Apple.''
   He said the company will ``pull all the stops out, go a little
bit overboard'' in manufacturing the new machines in anticipation
of strong demand.
   ``If you have a brand new product in which you believe, it
doesn't make sense to run it tight,'' Spindler said.
   Sculley said the new products and new strategy are among the
most important events in his eight years with the company.
   He said Apple is also working on several notebook-size
computers.
   ``Miniaturization is one of the major themes we're focusing on
in research and development,'' he said. ``I think that's going to
be extremely important in the 1990s.''
   Sculley acknowledged criticsim that Apple has failed to come up
with a lightweight portable. The Portable Mac is a bulky, heavy
machine that seems almost antiquated compared to competitive
models.
   ``While Apple has started late in some of these areas we can do
a lot more than just catch up,'' Sculley said. ``We see this as a
chance to get real differentiation in the 1990s.''
   He said miniaturization is evident in the new desktop models
that Apple will show off.
   ``It means extremely high reliability because we have fewer
components on the board,'' he said. ``The reliability of the new
products we think is going to be significantly higher than anything
that's been brought out.
   ``We're basically saying this is the year of the new customer
and we are reaching out to people who have never experienced Apple
before. Many of those people don't know an awful lot about personal
computers, and we want their first experience to be extremely
satisfying so the product reliability is important.''

   Robert Maxwell's Mirror Group Newspapers plans to
sell its television broadcasting buisiness to concentrate on
newspapers and printing, the publisher said in a statement Tuesday.
   Maxwell said the decision follows investment in new technology
that has allowed three of the group's British newspapers to change
to color. They include the Daily Mirror, the group's
national-circulation tabloid flagship which has a daily sale of 3.9
million copies.
   The statement said: ``We have decided in the future the group
should concentrate purely on newspapers and printing.
   ``We intend to expand our newspaper activities both at home and
abroad, particularly in the USA where there are some excellent
opportunities for expansion.''
   It gave no other details about the planned expansion in the
United States.

   Financier Kirk Kerkorian, who owns
about 80 percent of MGM-UA Communications Co. stock, and other
shareholders voted Tuesday to approve a $1.3 billion buyout offer
from Pathe Communications Corp.
   The vote tally was not immediately available from the special
meeting.
   So far, Pathe has paid $353 million toward the purchase price of
about $1.3 billion. Questions still surround how Pathe's principal,
Giancarlo parretti, will finance the remaining $900 million. The
deal is scheduled to be consummated on Oct. 23.
   MGM-UA Chairman Jeffrey Barbakow said at the meeting he was
optimistic the deal would be completed by the deadline.
   Time Warner, formerly Pathe's most solid source of funding for
the merger, withdrew its pledge of $650 million in loans earlier
this year and has sued Pathe for breach of contract.

   Meanwhile, even as Bush called for public support for a measure
designed to chart the way to a balanced budget, he signed
legislation extending the nation's borrowing powers.
   He signed a bill extending the national debt limit of $3.2
trillion through Saturday. Congress is expected to vote then to
extend it further.
   Earlier Tuesday, Bush sought to win over a group of House
Republicans who were either undecided on the package or leaning
against it. Some 35 members came, though the White House indicated
about 60 had been invited.
   ``I'm undecided. So's the nation,'' said Rep. Robert Dornan,
R-Calif, after the first of three sessions between Bush and GOP
lawmakers.
   Bush, giving a preview of the evening television address, told a
group of business leaders at the White House that he knew the
deficit-fighting package would require sacrifices.
   ``This budget agreement is our last best chance to get the
federal budget deficit under control,'' Bush said.
   ``To all the people that disagree and the people on the
sidelines that are rushing out and having their press conferences
and the critics, let me say this: You can pick the package apart
but you cannot realistically put a better package together.''
   He also apologized to the business group that in the course of
forging the compromise he had abandoned his call for a cut in the
capital gains tax.
   ``The philosophy I was elected on runs out of gas in terms of
votes in the United States Congress,'' Bush said.
   The most vociferous opposition to the plan hammered out by White
House and congressional leaders has come from Bush's own party.
   Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., said Bush had not persuaded him
and he still was likely to vote against the package.
   But Rep. Thomas Coleman, R-Mo., said he would support the
package. ``It's the only ball game in town,'' he said. ``If this
goes down, you're going to see chaos.''
   With the first votes on the package scheduled for as early as
Wednesday, both sides were scrambling to line up support.
   Congressional leaders pondered letting the Senate take the first
vote on an outline of the plan.
   Support for the package is viewed as stronger in the Senate, if
only because only one third of the 100-member Senate is up for
re-election this year while all 435 House seats are up for grabs.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said letting the Senate
cast the initial vote would ``put heat on the House.''
   It was Bush's fourth televised speech from the Oval Office. He
also addressed the nation to announce his drug strategy, to
announce the invasion of Panama and to announce his Persian Gulf
policy.

<HEAD>Moody's Downgrades Unisys Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LYNN BERRY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major credit rating agency Tuesday
downgraded Unisys Corp.'s debt and preferred stock saying the
country's third-largest computer maker has dim prospects for
sustaining any improved profits.
   Unisys spokesman Peter Hynes said the firm was dissappointed by
Moody's Investor Service Inc.'s downgrade of about $5.2 billion
worth of securities.
   Hynes cited the company's decision last week to suspend its
common stock dividend as evidence of its efforts to maintain credit
quality. The firm decided it would pay off debt with the $40
million normally paid each quarter to holders of common stock.
   Dividends will continue to be paid on preferred stock, Unisys
said Tuesday.
   Unisys, based in nearby Blue Bell, Pa., wants to reduce its debt
by $600 million to $800 million this year. The company owed $3.6
billion on June 30, down from a peak $4.1 billion in the middle of
1989.
   Moody's noted that Unisys's management has taken steps to
improve its financial flexibility.
   ``Improvements, however, have been moderated by the ongoing
challenges of the slowed growth and the increasing margin pressure
that are endemic to the industry,'' Moody's said in a release.
   On Monday, Unisys announced a new strategy to shift the
company's core business away from large mainframe computers, which
are being pushed out of the market by cheaper, faster and more
powerful desktop computers.
   The new plan is to market software that can integrate Unisys
equipment and incompatible equipment made by IBM and other rival
companies, Hynes said.
   The result would be computer networks that can share information
regardless of the make or size of the machines, making it possible
for customers to build upon existing equipment.

<TEXT>
   President Bush asked Americans Tuesday night
to support a $500 billion package of tax increases and spending
cuts that demands sacrifice from all. ``Everyone who can should
contribute something,'' the president said.
   Claiming rare unity with leaders of the Democratic-controlled
Congress, Bush said in a 10-minute televised speech from the Oval
Office that the package was written in ``eight months of blood,
sweat and fears - fears of the economic chaos that would follow if
we fail to reduce the deficit.''
   ``It is the best agreement that can be legislated now,'' Bush
said of the compromise. ``This deficit reduction agreement is
tough, and so are the times.''
   Bush's address from the Oval Office was nationally televised,
but his message was primarily aimed 16 blocks away: at Congress,
where an initial vote on the plan may be held as early as Thursday.
   Although the package generally has support among Democrats,
lawmakers from Bush's own party - particularly in the House - have
balked at its tax provisions. Bush himself had to abandon his ``no
new taxes'' pledge in the face of the growing deficit.
   ``I'm not, and I know you're not, a fan of tax increases,'' Bush
said. ``But if there have to be tax measures, they should allow the
economy to grow, they should not turn us back to higher income tax
rates and they should be fair.
   ``Everyone who can should contribute something. And no one
should have to contribute beyond their fair share.''
   Bush pointed out that the agreement had been hammered out by a
bipartisan group. ``The Democratic and Republican leadership
tonight all speak with once voice,'' he said, and he urged people
to tell their congressmen they support the package.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, joined Bush in
urging passage of the fragile package, saying the future of the
nation ``is more important than partisan differences.''
   In a televised response, Mitchell acknowledged that Democrats
and Republicans had ``deep differences over values and priorities''
that delayed an agreement for months. The Democratic leader called
the agreement ``imperfect,'' and warned that the compromise budget
cuts and tax increases will demand ``sacrifice from all
Americans.''
   ``But, if enacted, it holds the promise of restoring a sound
economy, from which all Americans will benefit,'' Mitchell said.
   ``Everybody who can should contribute something,'' Bush said.
``Everyone will bear a small burden. But if we succeed, every
American will have a large burden lifted.''
   The alternative, Bush said, is recession.
   Wavering Republican lawmakers had told Bush earlier in the day
that the plan was in trouble, and that a presidential address to
the nation endorsing the package might be helpful if he expected
GOP support for the package with congressional elections just a
month away.
   Bush also planned to push for the three-day-old package, which
the White House negotiated with congressional leaders, in a series
of upcoming speeches around the nation.
   The budget package would raise taxes on gasoline, alcohol,
cigarettes, boats and furs while trimming benefits to farmers and
Medicare recipients. It also would reduce tax deductions for people
who earn more than $100,000.
   Bush earlier Tuesday had pressed his case with skeptical and
wavering House Republicans.
   He seemed to be making some headway and by late Tuesday, House
GOP leaders were beginning to feel more optimistic about their
chances of rounding up support from most of their members. ``We've
made significant progress,'' said House Minority Leader Robert
Michel, R-Ill.
   One opponent, Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn., agreed, saying, ``I'd
guess right now it would be narrowly defeated. By tomorrow, it
would be narrowly passed. ... People are being moved, one-by-one.''
   Bush said the budget deficit was ``a problem that has lingered
and dogged and vexed this country for far too long.''
   Likening the budget crisis to the Persian Gulf stalemate, Bush
said ``our nation is standing together against Saddam Hussein's
aggression ' while at home ``another threat, a cancer, is gnawing
away at our nation's health.''
   The president said that ending deficit spending was simple
``common sense.''
   ``No nation can continue to do business the way the federal
government has been operating and survive,'' he said.
   ``When you get a bill, that bill must be paid,'' he said.
   Bush said that the plan was not ``a magic act'' but contained
true deficit savings and would put the nation on the path toward
lower interest rates and a balanced budget.
   A congressional study released Tuesday showed that the poor
would be hit hardest by the package, the rich would feel its
increases the least. The increased taxes and reduced benefits would
take an average 2 percent of the earnings of Americans with the
lowest incomes, according to the survey by the House Ways and Means
Committee.

<TEXT>
   A government support package helped propel Tokyo
stocks to their biggest one-day jump in history Tuesday but left
uncertain prospects for an extended rebound from the worst market
decline in more than 30 years.
   The closely watched Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues
leaped 2,676.55 points, or 13.24 percent, to 22,898.41 after the
Ministry of Finance announced emergency measures to shore up the
ailing market.
   The market receded slightly in early trading Wednesday on profit
taking before resuming its climb as the Nikkei posted a
331.16-point gain in the morning session.
   As the largest single-day gain ever, Tuesday's market eclipsed
the 9.29 percent rebound posted a day after the stock market
crashed three years ago, when the Nikkei rose 2,037.32 points to
23,947.40.
   ``The support from the Finance Ministry boosted the market's
sentiment. I believe institutional investors as well as individual
buyers now can't resist investing at the current low levels,'' said
Toshiyuki Nishiguchi, a trader with Daiwa Securities.
   The unprecedented jump came after a nine-month meltdown that had
erased nearly half the market's value - the equivalent of $2.1
trillion - since the end of last year. The protracted slide was the
worst since the Korean War in the early 1950s, market observers
said.
   The Foreign Ministry's measures themselves were minor
adjustments, but because they sent a message of support to the
markets, their psychological impact was considerable.
   The measures were aimed at spurring buying and reducing market
volatility. They included easing restrictions on the purchase of
stock on credit and shortening the hours for futures and options
trading.
   On Monday, before Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto signaled
the government's intentions, market watchers had been predicting
the Nikkei would plummet below the 15,000 mark. After the market
began to rally, some were calling for a return to 23,000, or even
25,000.
   ``This just shows how very fragile investor sentiment is,'' said
Amy Yip, manager of equity sales at Baring Securities Ltd.
   The Nikkei's comeback began late in Monday trading on comments
from Hashimoto, indicating that the government was about to act to
stem the market's slide. The Nikkei, which had slipped more than
1,200 points to below 20,000, rebounded to cut the day's loss to
761.64 points.
   The surge picked up momentum Tuesday. Volume was estimated at
550 million shares, up from 428 million shares Monday.
   ``Talk about herd mentality. . . . This market has gone
completely and utterly bananas,'' Paul Muller, manager of
international equity sales at Schroder Securities (Japan) Ltd.,
said before Tuesday's trading ended.
   The rise was accelerated by ``panic buying,'' according to Yip.
   ``Customers were worried about missing the boat,'' she said.
They're afraid the market's going to pull back tomorrow. . . .
They're moving entirely differently from logic.''
   Dealers said the runup was fed by a so-called ``short squeeze,''
in which traders who had sold borrowed shares had to buy them back
to avoid serious losses.
   ``The short squeeze is on,'' Schroder's Muller said. ``Everyone
had been expecting it . . . and it came with a vengeance.''
   Some traders believed the market had bottomed out and was ready
for a change.
   ``In addition to the psychological effect of Hashimoto's
measure, the market, weary of selling, was prepared for an
upturn,'' said Yoshiro Inoue, a dealer with Nomura Securities.
   Diplomatic efforts by countries to settle the Persian Gulf
crisis, falling oil prices, a surge in the Dow Jones industrial
average on Wall Street Monday and a stronger bond market in Japan
were also among the positive factors, he said.
   In bond dealings, bond prices advanced as the yield on the
benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond closed at 8.185 percent,
down sharply from 8.475 percent the previous day.
   ``We believe today's rebound is an indication of sustained
recovery as long as the Middle East remains calm,'' Inoue said.
   Before the rebound, the Nikkei index had shed 10,616.13 points,
or 34.4 percent, from its closing of 30,837.99 on Aug. 1, the day
before Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   Japan is highly vulnerable to unrest in the Gulf because it
imports virtually all its oil, with 70 percent coming from the
Middle East.
   Because the economy remains susceptible to outside shocks, some
doubted the lasting impact of the ministry's initiatives. But many
felt they would give the market a healthy short-term boost.
   The principal change would increase the credit limit for
investors buying stock on margin. The measure would allow investors
to count 80 percent of the value of their holdings as collateral
for stock purchases, up from 70 percent.
   A second measure, aimed at easing market volatility, reduces the
time allowed for futures and options trading by 20 minutes to four
hours and 10 minutes. As in the United States, traders in Japan
have been hedging their stock bets with counterbalancing trades in
stock-index futures and options. Some critics say those strategies
have contributed to the market's uneasiness.
   The third measure loosens reporting requirements for big
insurance companies investing in stocks, which could spur more
buying by those companies.

   Following an early decline Wednesday morning, stock
prices resumed climbing one day after the key index on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange posted its largest single-day increase ever.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues added 331.16
points, or 1.45 percent, ending Wednesday morning's session at
23,229.57. The index gained 2,676.55 points Tuesday.
   The market got off to a slow start Wednesday, with the Nikkei
losing 139.05 points on profit taking in the first 15 minutes of
trading.
   Volume on the morning session Wednesday was estimated at 300
million shares, up from an estimated 200 million shares Tuesday
morning.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining issues 580 to 131, while
98 issues remained unchanged. About 30 percent of all shares were
left unpriced at the end of the session due to lack of sufficient
sell orders to match buy orders, traders said.
   The market rallied Tuesday on lower oil prices and moves by the
Finance Ministry to spur buying and reduce market volatility. The
changes included easing restrictions on the purchase of stock on
credit and shortening the hours for futures and options trading.
   While the measures were minor adjustments, they had a strong
psychological impact on the market Tuesday.
   In the foreign exchange market, the dollar fell slightly to
136.32 yen in the morning session. It opened at 136.33 yen, down
0.40 yen from Tuesday's close. It ranged between 136.32 yen and
136.58 yen by late morning.
   Currency dealers said the dollar declined against the yen
because of falling oil prices.
   ``Lower oil prices will support the yen because it is considered
to have a more positive impact on the Japanese economy than
elsewhere,'' said Yasushi Nishikado of Daiichi Kangyo Bank.
   He added that the dollar is expected to stay in the 135 to 136
yen range until Friday when U.S. unemployment figures for September
are announced.
   In bond dealings, the yield on the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 8.280 percent, from Tuesday's
close of 8.185 percent. Their price fell to 82.41 points from
82.81.
