<TEXT>
   Welcome to paradise - for as long as it
stays above water. The people of this chain of palm-studded islands
fear global warming could condemn their nation to geological
history.
   If the earth gets hotter, as some scientists predict, the
Maldives could be swamped by rising seas and violent storms. The
Indian Ocean archipelago almost certainly would be among the first
casualties of the greenhouse effect.
   ``We may have some islands just disappear. That is according to
the business-as-usual scenario. I would hope that the international
community would take note and do something before that happens,''
said Hussain Shihab, the Maldives' director of environment affairs.
   According to some estimates, unchecked emissions of carbon
dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases will raise the sea
level by a foot in the next 40 years - submerging much of the
Maldives' 175 square miles of land.
   The Maldives, about 400 miles south of India and the same
distance west of Sri Lanka, are little more than clumps of coconut
palms fringed by white sand in a nest of coral reefs.
   The 1,190 islands are clustered in atolls in an archipelago 510
miles long. Just 200 islands are inhabited and a quarter of the
nation's 200,000 people live on Male island, which covers barely
one square mile.
   Few of the islands are more than 6 feet above sea level, so a
big splash can be devastating, as demonstrated in April 1987 when a
tidal wave rolled over the island nation.
   ``We had a storm that was more severe than anyone could ever
remember,'' Shihab said. ``This really woke us up.''
   Two-thirds of Male, the Maldivian capital, was flooded by sea
water. The international airport on neighboring Hulule was closed
for two days, and entire fishing villages were under water.
   Shihab said damage totaled $40 million - half this nation's
annual gross domestic product.
   Some experts said the freak storm originated 4,000 miles away in
the south Indian Ocean, underlining the Maldives' vulnerability to
far-away calamities.
   The disaster forced Maldivians to take a more appreciative look
at their coral reefs, the feeding grounds for a stunning array of
tropical fish. The reefs provide a natural barrier from an often
hostile sea.
   The mining of coral, the basic building material for most houses
here, was forbidden on reefs connected to islands. The ban
eventually will be extended to unattached atolls, although
importing cement will be costly, Shihab said.
   Traditionally dependent on fishing and tuna exports, the
islands' energy needs are small. There is no heavy industry and
Male has only a few dozen cars. Experiments with solar power
promise to further decrease dependency on polluting fossile fuels.
   As a result, the Maldivians have felt few constraints about
pressing for worldwide controls on emissions of carbon dioxide and
other greenhouse gases that threaten the islands.
   These gases build a shield in the atmosphere which traps heat,
and many experts predict higher temperatures will change weather
patterns and raise sea levels, endangering coastal areas and
low-lying countries. Some experts disagree, arguing that such
long-term effects are unclear.
   ``It is the small island states who contribute the least (in
heat-trapping pollutants) which will suffer the most,'' Shihab
said.
   The tropical beauty of the islands is the Maldives' only natural
asset and major source of income other than the sea. When the first
tourist resort opened in 1972, the Maldives were virtually unknown
except as a staging post for the British air force dating from
World War II. The British left in 1976.
   This year the number of tourists is expected to equal the
resident population. Resorts have gone up on 59 previously
uninhabited islands, catering to scuba divers and sun worshipers.
   The influx of tourists has aroused fears of cultural pollution
in this strict Sunni Moslem society which has its own unique
language and script. Travelers are discouraged from visiting all
but a few fishing villages outside the resort islands.
   Passengers arriving on international flights are cautioned not
to bring alcohol, pigs, dogs, statues for worship, pornography,
explosives, guns or drugs - in that order.
   Shihab said the loss of cultural identity would be the real
tragedy if the Maldives were overwhelmed by the environment. ``We
don't want to be refugees of the greenhouse effect,'' he said.

<HEAD>Threat of War Strips Iraq of Its Youth</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young, able-bodied men seem in short supply
in the teeming markets and streets of Baghdad. The threat of war
has stripped Iraq of its youth and sent many of them to the front.
   The government announced this week it would call up an
additional 150,000 men for duty in Kuwait.
   But some Western diplomats question the numbers and expressed
doubts about Iraq's ability to wage a war, claiming troop morale is
low, strategic fuel supplies inadequate and vital spare parts are
in dwindling supply.
   Highways in Kuwait are littered with broken-down tanks and
disabled military vehicles, Western diplomats claimed.
   The country has 18 million people, a regular army of 550,000 and
480,000 reservists, as well as a Popular Army militia of about
850,000, according to diplomats in Baghdad who spoke on condition
of anonymity. Iraq claims more than 8 million volunteers in the
Popular Army.
   Its air force, with more than 500 combat jets, is fairly
sophisticated and its army well-equipped.
   A weakness, the diplomats say, is the soldiers, whose morale is
eroding because of months maintaining the alert in the desert and
food shortages brought about by distribution problems.
   Men going absent while on leave is another ``big problem,'' one
European diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``One estimate is 40 percent of those who go on leave don't go
back to Kuwait. The president had to decree that it's the same as
desertion,'' the diplomat said.
   Also, the diplomats noted that small numbers of Iraqi soldiers
have deserted along the Turkish border.
   Besides the expected reinforcements, Iraq has an estimated
430,000 troops in southern Iraq and Kuwait, which Iraq invaded Aug.
2.
   There are about 330,000 soldiers in Persian Gulf from the
multinational force, including about 230,000 U.S. troops. The
United States plans to increase its troop strength to about 430,000
by January.
   About 1 million Iraqis and Iranian troops died during their
eight-year war, according to U.N. estimates.
   Iraq expelled all Western military attaches last month, making
it more difficult to accurately assess Iraq's readiness for war.
   ``We're getting a lot of technical intelligence, but we can no
longer get the assessments of individual units, commanders and
their fighting ability,'' said one Western diplomat with long
military experience.
   Others say many of the troops in Kuwait belong to the Popular
Army, a ragtag outfit of ill-trained irregulars.
   Iraqi troops in the south also include the crack,
battle-hardened Republican Guards, whose ability and willingness to
fight remains unchallenged to Western observers.
   But Iraq is also a victim of its military system, said the
diplomat with military experience.
   He said the army is dug in along a Maginot-type line on the
border which is vulnerable to massive air strikes from
multinational forces. The Maginot line was a French fortification
that failed to repel Germany's invasion in World War II.
   ``They don't realize what they're facing,'' the diplomat said.
``This time, the Americans have the proper weapon for the proper
target.''
   Western diplomats increasingly feel that a limited war, coupled
with economic sanctions, might be enough to force Iraq to withdraw
from Kuwait.
   Iraq, meanwhile, is hoping it can endure the economic embargo
and break the international coalition against it, the diplomats
said.
   ``The Iraqi leadership believes that unless they give him a
reason to go to war, President Bush, like all presidents, will look
for a way to avoid doing it,'' the European diplomat said.
   Iraqi officials say they want peace but insist they're prepared
for war.
   ``We expect war at any moment. This is a fact, not just
propaganda,'' said Information Minister Latif Nassayif Jassim.
``One hopes a war will never erupt.''
   Diplomats contend the timing of Iraq's planned Dec. 25 to March
25 release of Western hostages reflects Baghdad's fear of fighting
the United States.
   The winter is considered the best time for military operations
in the gulf because of lower temperatures and frequent spells of
good weather.
   Also, diplomats say the West may face political pressure to
avoid war during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan beginning in
March.

<TEXT>
   Michael Milken, sentenced to 10 years in prison
for securities and tax violations, is no longer a billionaire. But
he remains one of the country's richest people.
   His net worth was estimated in October by Forbes magazine at
$700 million, good enough for 115th place on the register of
America's 400 wealthiest people.
   That's after paying $600 million in fines and restitution as
part of his guilty plea to six felonies in April. Forbes also
estimated that he lost $250 million from the collapse of the
junk-bond market and his employer, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
which filed for bankruptcy earlier this year.
   At Drexel, Milken made more than $1.1 billion from 1983-87,
including $550 million in 1987 alone. But he faces more than 50
civil lawsuits seeking billions of dollars in damages as a result
of his wrongdoing and Drexel's collapse. And he was sentenced to
prison Friday.

<HEAD>Desert Duty Puts Strain on Civilian Soldiers</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>IN EASTERN SAUDI ARABIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Life was good for Johnny Spell
until Saddam Hussein absorbed Kuwait.
   Spell was busy running an appliance store founded by his late
father in rural North Carolina, and he was settling down with his
bride of three months.
   Then he was called to active duty with his National Guard unit.
   Now, his original 90-day tour has been extended for another 90
days, so he won't be home for the holidays.
   ``When this is over, I hope I've got a business to go back to. I
hope my business don't go bankrupt because I'm gone,'' said Spell,
46, of Autryville, N.C., and a staff sergeant with the 382nd Public
Affairs Unit.
   ``I've got that to worry about plus breaking away from a new
family. We were just getting started, and all of a sudden this
thing comes along. That has been the hardest thing for me to cope
with,'' Spell said in an interview.
   More than 51,000 citizen soldiers have been called to active
duty under Operation Desert Shield. With an extension, they can
serve for 180 days or even longer if Congress authorizes it.
   By law, employers must keep a job open for reservists doing
their duty. But small businessmen such as Spell can only hope their
trade will survive in their absence.
   ``It's harder on the citizen soldier. We had to leave a job and
we had to leave our families,'' Spell said. ``Being self-employed,
it's just a tough situation to deal with. In my absence, I feel
like I am going to lose some business.''
   Spell, an 18-year veteran of the National Guard, says not to
misinterpret the strain of being away as an unwillingness to serve.
He won't shirk his duty, no matter how much it hurts financially
and personally.
   ``When you sign the dotted line, you know if a time comes like
this you have to go and do your duty. I'm not bitter about being
here. I just miss home and I miss my business like every person
does, and I need to be back,'' Spell said.
   ``This may sound corny, but I wanted to do my patriotic American
duty. I wanted to serve. We've got a job to do,'' he said. ``But
everyone over here regrets they're not at home. I don't guess that
can be helped.''
   His father founded Spell's Furniture and Appliance Store in
1949, selling and repairing household furnishings, TVs and other
electronic products in a town of 500 people. Spell's has eight
full-time employees at two locations.
   Spell will be away for the Christmas rush, his busiest time of
the year, and that's worrisome.
   ``I do the buying, the selling, the service, even some of the
delivery. Someone else has to do it now,'' Spell said. ``The only
way we've existed through the years is through repeat business.''
   Spell's wife and cousin are filling in as managers for the
business while he's in Saudi Arabia, attached to the Army's 18th
Airborne Corps. It would be impossible for him to try to run the
shop from 7,000 miles away while he's wearing his desert camouflage
fatigues and doing Uncle Sam's work.
   ``I need to give the Army 100 percent,'' he said.
   Spell was activated Aug. 31 and has been in Saudi Arabia since
Sept. 13. He had barely enough time to straighten out some business
details, change some things in his will and give his wife power of
attorney.
   He'll miss Thanksgiving and Christmas with his family and his
75-year-old mother, and he'll be away for his wife's Dec. 7
birthday.
   And there just wasn't enough time to take care of some personal
business, like selling his wife's former home while the couple
settled in.
   ``Some things will just have to be put on hold,'' Spell said.
``There's only so much one person can do.''

<HEAD>Congress Suspends Eight Supreme Court Justices in Beer Tax Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER MCFARREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The lower house of Congress has
temporarily suspended eight of twelve Supreme Court Justices in a
dispute over a beer tax, aggravating political divisions in the
country.
   In response, the justices threatened to annul the 1989 elections
that put the current government in power. They asked the armed
forces to intervene.
   The armed forces, which have staged more than 100 coups in
Bolivia's 165-year history, declined. A statement said the conflict
must be resolved according to the constitution.
   The government had said two weeks ago that it would try eight
out of the twelve justices for incompetence after they ruled that a
beer tax authorized by Congress was illegal.
   Charging the justices were influenced by beer companies, the
government said the repeal of the tax threatened an economic
stabilization plan by depriving the treasury of $50 million.
   The lower house temporarily suspended the justices on Tuesday,
and the Senate was to consider a measure permanently removing them.
   The court responded by saying it would consider a petition
presented in August 1989 by the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement
calling for the annulment of the elections. The court is controlled
by justices appointed under the previous Revolutionary Nationalist
Movement government.
   Congressmen Tito Hoz de Vila, head of the Congressional Economic
Committee, said the conflict ``threatens the country's political
and economic stability.''
   ``It is necessary for Bolivians to act with serenity,'' said
Gen. Hugo Banzer Suarez, a member of the governing coalition. ``We
must strengthen democracy, which is in danger.''
   The Revolutionary Nationalist Movement placed first in the 1989
popular vote but lacked the required absolute majority. As a
result, the president was elected by Congress.
   President Jaime Paz Zamora, of the Revolutionary Leftist
Movement, finished third in the elections but was elected by
Congress through an alliance with the conservative Nationalist
Democratic Action party, headed by former dictator Banzer Suarez,
whose party had finished second.
   The opposition accused the governing coalition of ``attempting
to destroy the judicial power by subjugating it to act as a legal
office and not as a separate branch of government.''

   Here are excerpts from Tuesday's testimony
before the Senate Ethics Committee on the dealings five senators
had with Charles H. Keating Jr., owner of the failed Lincoln
Savings and Loan.
   Gwendolyn van Paasschen, economics assistant to Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., continued her testimony from Monday. She was
questioned at one point by James Hamilton, the lawyer representing
Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.
   
   Hamilton: I would like to go back to the question I asked you
before about whether Sen. McCain was coaxed into the meeting (with
four senators and Edwin Gray, then chairman of the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board). ... Now, who was coaxing Sen. McCain into this
meeting?
   Van Paasschen: ... It was my view that what Sen. DeConcini had
suggested was inappropriate. And I further went on to say that I
believed that the reason that Sen. McCain was being involved in
this ... was because Sen. McCain was a Republican and that would
ensure that it was a bipartisan effort, and that Keating had raised
more for Sen. McCain than he had for Sen. DeConcini at that time.
So, if the press were to ever get a hold of it, it would be more
embarrassing for Sen. McCain than for Sen. DeConcini. ...
   Hamilton: What fact led you to believe that Sen. DeConcini was
coaxing Sen. McCain to this meeting because he was a Republican?
...
   Van Paasschen: His demeanor was very persuasive. He was coming
to Sen. McCain instead of Mr. Keating himself. He was a Democrat,
we were Republican. And as I said before, Keating had raised more
for Sen. McCain than he had for Sen. DeConcini at that time. ...

   In the afternoon session, Any Sabrin, special assistant to
special counsel Robert Bennett, questioned Sen. McCain's
administrative aide Christopher Koch.
   
   Sabrin: Did you attend the meeting between Mr. Keating and Sen.
McCain on the 24th? (March 24, 1987)
   Koch: I did.
   Sabrin: Can you tell us, with as much detail as you can recall,
what happened?
   Koch: It would be a very difficult meeting to forget. ... I
remember vividly him (McCain) telling Mr. Keating that he hadn't
spent 5{ years of his life in a prisoner of war camp to have his
courage or his integrity questioned - and he gave Mr. Keating a
dressing down, the likes of which I, in my experience on the Hill,
had never experienced a senator giving a major employer of his
state. It was startling to me. I mean it was a very vivid
impression.
   Sabrin: Can you recall with any detail what the substance was of
what Mr. Keating was asking Sen. McCain to do and what his response
was?
   Koch: Yes. John said that there's certain things he can do and
there's certain things he couldn't do. He said he could find out if
Mr. Keating's allegations ... had merit. He could look in and ask
questions about if this investigation was taking so long, why it
was taking so long. ...
   But he said, ``I can't go in and do your bidding for you. ... I
can't go in and break arms and legs for you. I can find out if
you're being treated fairly.''
   ... Mr. Keating thought he was being treated very, very
unfairly. ... it was almost as if he hadn't been listening to John
because he again got into requests for him to get involved ... and
again the meeting got a little bit hot. And John came back at him
again and said he couldn't do that ...
   Sabrin: What was your understanding after ... Mr. Keating walked
out of Sen. McCain's office of how the whole matter was left?
   Koch: I thought that the relationship had clearly in my opinion,
come to a screeching halt. I had never heard two people ... have
that kind of conversation and ever want to talk to each other
again. ...

   A judge will decide Dec. 4 whether to make the order permanent.
   Rose was arrested Oct. 30 for investigation of assault after an
altercation with Kantor. No charges have been filed, although Rose

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Madonna and a neighbor are suing each other
over trees and shrubs in her back yard that block a city view, and
the singer will get a chance to tell her side of the story in
court.
   Madonna, singer of such hits as ``Like a Virgin'' and ``Material
Girl,'' inherited the dispute from a previous owner when she moved
into the Hollywood Hills home.
   Neighbor Donald Robinson sued the previous owner for allegedly
failing to trim the foliage, then sued Madonna.
   Madonna's countersuit claims Robinson trespassed on her property
in 1989, ``making threatening, abusive and derogatory statements''
and ``cutting various trees and plants.''
   Trial has been scheduled for Nov. 30. Superior Court Judge Sally
Disco ordered Madonna to be there.

<HEAD>Michelle and Rodney: Thanksgiving Anniversary Driving Trucks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>IN EASTERN SAUDI ARABIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Michelle and Rodney Lawrence
got married, they really didn't anticipate spending their first
anniversary on Thanksgiving Day driving trucks in different parts
of Saudi Arabia, thousands of miles from their 3-month-old son.
   For Pvt. 1 Michelle Lawrence, the best Thanksgiving present
would be to see her 25-year-old husband, a 3{-hour drive away in
the northern desert, and to get home as quickly as possible to her
infant son and two older children.
   Though some military couples have thrived here, others like the
Lawrences have been torn between military duty and family
commitments back home.
   The huge U.S. deployment in the Persian Gulf shattered Mrs.
Lawrence's family, heightened her anxiety, and turned her against
the Army, which ordered her to leave Rodney Jr. when he was only
five weeks old.
   ``They said, you signed a contract, you have to go,'' she said.
``I don't think it's fair that they split families up like this
because not everybody needs to be here. ... (It's) extremely
heartless.''
   If she had the opportunity, the 21-year-old from Battle Creek,
Mich., said she would choose a peaceful, stateside job and quit the
Army.
   ``When I joined the Army, I never believed I'd be in a place
like this. Back home is such a beautiful place. When things come up
like this, it brings reality to the job that you're actually
doing,'' she said.
   Mrs. Lawrence candidly admits she joined the Army so she could
go to college, become a lawyer, and get comprehensive health
coverage for her children.
   She signed up for 6 years and has been in for 2{ years, driving
trucks.
   On Nov. 22, 1989, she married fellow truck driver, Spec. Rodney
Lawrence, and started a new life, excited at the prospect of
completing more pre-law courses.
   ``We used to be in the same unit,'' she said. ``When we got
married, according to military laws, they split us up.''
   Their first child was born just after Iraq invaded Kuwait on
Aug. 2.
   Shortly afterward, Lawrence's 96th Transportation Company was
ordered to Saudi Arabia. Then, 2{ weeks later, her 180th
Transportation Battalion from Ft. Hood, Tex., was deployed here.
   ``I knew I had to go so I volunteered to come with our advance
party so I could hurry up, get over here, get it over with, and get
back home,'' she said.
   But with no rotations because of the additional U.S. troops
being deployed here, she said, those who arrived first will end up
staying longer.
   Before Lawrence left, he adopted her two oldest children, Tony,
3, and Brandon, 2. His mother is now looking after them and the
baby, Rodney Jr.
   ``I've talked to them one time on the phone since I've been
here. the oldest one isn't doing too bad. The middle one is really
taking it hard. He's always talking about `Momma, I want you to
come home. Momma, I miss you. Momma, come get me.'
   ``It's hard to talk to him. I try and talk to Tony as long as I
can to make up for the tears that I shed with Brandon.''
   Since her arrival about seven weeks ago, Mrs. Lawrence has been
driving five-ton trucks. Some of her female colleagues have been
run off the road or stoned by Saudi men unaccustomed to seeing
women drivers, but she said so far she's been lucky.
   Her husband has been driving tank carriers.
   ``I've seen him three or four times and I get a letter about
every two or three days,'' she said. ``We've tried to spend as much
time alone as we possibly could, just talking and crying, and
talking about our three children we have back home.''

<HEAD>Government Creates `Invisible Judges' to Hear Drug Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN GUTKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a major step to reform Colombia's
battered judicial system, the government has created a special
corps of ``invisible judges'' to hear drug- and terrorism-related
cases.
   Up to 500 judges will try cases without having their identities
revealed, Justice Minister Jaime Giraldo told a news conference
Tuesday. They will live in heavily protected fortresses in
Colombia's four biggest cities.
   The reform measures Giraldo announced also provide anonymity for
witnesses and have police, rather than judges, collect evidence in
sensitive cases.
   They are part of President Cesar Gaviria's program to protect
judges from intimidation by drug traffickers.
   Seventy-seven judges have been murdered by the cocaine bosses in
the past 12 years. The magistrates often are given a choice between
``plata o plomo'' - a bribe or a bullet.
   So far, the country has been unable to keep any major drug
trafficker in jail. Most of the top traffickers brought to justice
were first taken to the United States, and tried and jailed there
under a special extradition treaty.
   But the extraditions have created political problems because
many consider them insults to national pride. Gaviria has said that
fortifying the judicial system will allow the government to
prosecute drug criminals in Colombia.
   In the present system, judges must act as investigators and
prosecutors in addition to deciding guilt or innocence. They visit
crime sites and collect witness testimony, thus becoming even
bigger targets of the drug mafia.
   Under the new plan, such evidence will be collected by police.
   The Medellin cocaine cartel has been blamed by authorities for
killing 550 Colombians since the government and the traffickers
declared war on each other after a political assassination in
August 1989.
   Among the dead were three presidential candidates.
   Most of the crimes have gone unpunished.
   Judicial reform will be among the topics discussed at an
upcoming national assembly to reform Colombia's 104-year-old
constitution.

<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reacting to a statewide vote against a
holiday honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., one Arizona
county decided Tuesday to give its workers a paid holiday
commemorating the slain civil rights leader.
   Pima County employees will be given time off on either of two
days, but the county's offices will remain open on both days with
at least skeleton crews, the Board of Supervisors decided by a
unanimous vote.
   The county includes the city of Tucson and its environs.
   Voters in the state's general election on Nov. 6 rejected two
propositions that would have created a paid holiday to honor King.
One proposition called for creating a King Day while retaining
Columbus Day and the other would have created a King Day while
eliminating Columbus Day.
   The rejection led to a backlash of national criticism, with many
organizers of conventions and sporting events threatening to
boycott the state.
   A majority of the voters in Pima County supported creating an
11th state holiday in honor of King.
   The board had been advised by its lawyer that it could not
simply declare a holiday because the county must abide by state
status on when offices must be open. However, the board's action
changes the county's personnel policy and does not conflict with
state law, said Supervisor Raul Grijalva.
   The resolution the board passed calls for giving county
employees eight hours' paid administrative leave to be taken on
either the third Monday of January or on the Friday preceding that
Monday, Grijalva said.
   The national holiday honoring King falls on the third Monday of
January.
   Grijalva also said he will send the board's resolution to the
Maricopa County Board of Supervisors in Phoenix in the hope that
they will follow Pima County's example.
   ``I think that if the two largest counties in the state set the
tone ... that will push the Legislature to either do something
themselves, or put it back on the ballot for voters to decide,'' he
said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush May Have Pushed Too Hard on Gulf Resolution</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush counseled ``just be patient'' when
pressed on why the Soviet Union hadn't joined his call for a
resolution authorizing military force against Kuwait. But in the
end, Bush may have been the impatient one.
   By seeking support for a resolution dealing with war at a
conference dedicated to peace, Bush may have given the impression
of pushing too hard. That threatened to alienate some of those who
stood with the United States in earlier United Nations actions
against international outlaw Iraq.
   The president's hand on the Persian Gulf also may have been
weakened by the political defeat delivered to British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher on Tuesday by her own Conservative
Party. Mrs. Thatcher, who was forced into a second party leadership
vote next week, has been Bush's staunchest ally in insisting that
the military option be left open in the gulf.
   Bush was heading to the Middle East - where he will meet with
Saudi and exiled Kuwaiti officials today, U.S. forces on
Thanksgiving and Egyptian officials on Friday - without the
consensus he had hoped to forge in Paris.
   But not for lack of trying.
   Like lobbyists on Capitol Hill in search of votes, Bush and
Secretary of State James A. Baker III worked the halls and the
elegant salons in which the 34-nation Conference on Cooperation and
Security in Europe had gathered to celebrate the end of East-West
hostilities.
   But the U.S. efforts failed to wring agreement from summit
leaders on what to do next to dislodge Iraq's Saddam Hussein from
Kuwait.
   When the summit leaders went into a closed-door session Tuesday
for concluding discussions, the crisis in the Persian Gulf didn't
even come up, participants said.
   After Bush's private dinner with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev on Monday night failed to produce a breakthrough, Baker
continued to press the president's case during two meetings Tuesday
with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   Speaking with reporters after the second meeting, Shevardnadze
stressed past U.S.-Soviet cooperation on the gulf. He noted it was
remarkable, considering the long history of rivalries.
   ``That unity and high level of solidarity that has been
accomplished in the course of preparation and adoption of past
Security Council resolutions is something that we cherish very
much,'' he said.
   ``So please don't make me get ahead of time,'' he added.
   The Soviets did agree that the United Nations should take
another look at the effectiveness of the sanctions it imposed on
Iraq, with an eye to ``new resolutions'' if necessary to enforce
the old ones.
   That narrowed the gap a little bit. But administration officials
said many differences remain.
   One Soviet official, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
suggested that ``Bush and Baker did not come here with a need to
decide anything urgently'' and might be getting a bum rap. ``It
seemed that they were interested in longer-range talks, in taking
the longer view,'' the official said.
   Even so, it was clear that administration officials had expected
more to happen.
   The two lecterns set up by the White House in the U.S.
ambassador's residence for a news conference that never happened -
one set high for the tall Bush, the other set lower for the more
stocky Gorbachev - were graphic testimony to that.
   Did Bush send out the wrong signals in trying to win support for
a more militant stance toward Iraq at a peace conference? ``I can
see the wisdom of that line of thought,'' said White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   But he suggested the need to build a consensus and ``having
everybody on board'' was more important than a question of location
and timing.

   Summit delegates offered their concern, but little
concrete help to cope with the seething nationalism and economic
troubles that threaten Eastern Europe's young democracies and the
crumbling Soviet empire.
   Speaker after speaker mentioned the dangers to peace and
democracy as the leaders of 34 nations met at the Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe, one year after Eastern Europe's
breathtaking revolutions.
   ``A new welfare war may rise in place of the Iron Curtain,''
warned Hungarian Prime Minister Joszef Antall. Poland's Tadeusz
Mazowiecki raised the specter of an ``A-class Europe and a B-class
Europe.''
   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is preparing to ship food to
help the Soviet Union through its harsh winter, used his first
summit speech as head of his reunified country to urge the wealthy
West to bail out the poorer East.
   Discussion of one grave danger - the migration of millions from
the poor East to the rich West - dominated a closed-door session
Tuesday, according to German spokesman Hans Klein.
   Up to 5 million Soviet citizens are believed ready to emigrate
once a new passport law is passed. As many as 25 million people
want to leave the former East bloc, United Nations officials
estimate.
   Soviet neighbors Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary are
particularly worried that the flood of migrants passing through
would tax their already stretched economies beyond the breaking
point. Thousands of talented young people already have fled the
poor Balkan nations of Romania and Bulgaria.
   Yet, while everyone agrees the West must act to shore up
democracy in Eastern Europe, the most delegates accomplished on the
migration question was to consider establishing a pan-European
group to monitor it.
   European leaders floated various proposals to help Eastern
Europe combat collapsing economies, high oil prices and dwindling
Soviet supplies, the threat of mass unemployment and the renewed
vigor of populist nationalism.
   The Netherlands, for instance, seeks a European Energy Charter
to help East Europe deal with reduced supplies of oil, coal used
for heating and a major shortfall in electricity predicted by 2000.
   Norway pledged to establish a new fund to help reduce harmful
emissions that cause global warming, and delivered a reminder that
capitalism cannot cure all the East's ills.
   ``Market forces alone cannot protect our health or achieve
social justice,'' said Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland.
``Economic growth cannot be bought at the expense of social
justice.''
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose giant country is
threatened with multiple ethnic and social conflicts, delivered the
strongest warning on nationalist tension, warning of a
``destructive snowball effect'' if demands to revise borders and
remake nations are elevated to state policy.
   Bulgaria's Zhelyu Zhelev, warning against ``the exaltation of
national sentiment,'' urged creation of a new section in the
Helsinki process - now divided into security, economic cooperation
and human rights - to deal with ethnic and minority issues.
   Some of these proposals would cost little, others would cost
billions. But no one mentioned providing money.
   This is at least partly because the East's needs arise as the
West also is becoming strapped for cash. The United States must
bear the costs of involvement in the Persian Gulf, escalating oil
prices, a coming economic recession and a vast, stubborn budget
deficit.
   Even wealthy Germany, the world's largest exporter, is expected
to become a heavy net borrower on international markets to help the
former East Germany achieve something approaching Western living
standards.
   When President Bush visited Prague last weekend, all he could
offer in new aid was a $60 million development fund he said he
would request from Congress. One Prague resident said that was less
than the value of Air Force One.
   But East European officials seemed appreciative that the
region's plight is at least high on the West's agenda.
   ``The problem is there for all to see,'' said Czechoslovak
President Vaclav Havel's spokesman, Michael Zantovsky. ``We feel
supported by the speeches, and we think that more concrete steps
will follow.''

<HEAD>U.S. Farm Exports Expected to Face Challenges Next Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The value of U.S. agricultural exports rose to
a nine-year high in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, but
Agriculture Department analysts say it'll be tougher sledding in
1991.
   In fiscal 1990, the department's Economic Research Service said
Tuesday, export values rose to $40.2 billion from $39.7 billion in
1989. That was the most since the record of $43.8 billion in 1981.
   Official forecasts of 1991 exports, farm income and other
indicators will be issued next week at the department's annual
outlook conference.
   But bumper crops in some other countries have already lowered
prospects for U.S. grain exports in the coming year, the report
said.
   For example, the export volume of corn in September - the final
month of the 1990 fiscal year - plunged to 2.7 million metric tons,
the lowest monthly volume since February 1987.
   Although analysts were not specific on the effects of an export
slowdown, the report noted other factors that will have a bearing
on farm income in 1991 and beyond.
   ``The U.S. economy continues to grow very slowly, and the
outlook is for more slow growth, or even a brief contraction,'' the
report said. ``Given an orderly unwinding of current problems,
though, growth should pick up in 1992.''
   Over the longer haul, it said, forecasts suggest that inflation,
interest rates and the value of the dollar will drift down.
   ``Lower interest rates would put downward pressure on farmers'
production costs and a lower exchange rate would aid farm
exports,'' the report said.
   But good crops in much of the world ``have lowered prospects for
U.S. exports of wheat, coarse grains and rice,'' it added.
   ``Global wheat output is expected to rise 11 percent in 1990-91,
setting a record,'' the report said. ``A smaller gain in coarse
grain production is likely, and world trade will slip. A record
world rice crop is expected, and trade will increase only
slightly.''
   The monthly report by the department's Economic Research Service
also said the net cash income of farmers this year is still
expected to be at a record level, probably in the range of $59
billion to $63 billion.
   That is unchanged from previous forecasts by the agency. Net
cash income is the difference between gross cash income and cash
expenses.
   Another report Tuesday said the cereal grain needs for 55
low-income countries in 1990-91 ``are substantial, despite the
favorable outlook for supplies'' globally.
   ``East Africa and the relatively populous region of South Asia
will require the most assistance, followed by Latin America and
Southern Africa,'' the report said.
   The analysis added that ``the situation reflects poor harvests
in Ethiopia and Sudan, good crops in most of Asia and declining
commercial cereal imports in most regions due to foreign exchange
shortages.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter has no
plan to leave his job, despite speculation that he would soon step
down, says his chief spokeswoman.
   Talk has circulated on Capitol Hill and elsewhere that Yeutter
was headed for greener pastures following completion of the 1990
farm bill and the conclusion next month of international trade
talks.
   One of the latest to surface is that Yeutter might be in line
for an ambassadorship, perhaps to Germany, if that should become
available.
   Kelly Shipp, who has been Yeutter's press secretary since 1987
when he was President Reagan's U.S. trade representative, said
reports of his leaving the Cabinet soon - perhaps within 90 days -
are ``not true.''
   Specifically, Shipp said Tuesday it is ``not true, absolutely,
patently false'' that Yeutter is seeking or being touted for an
ambassador's job,
   Yeutter just returned from a week of meetings in Europe where
the Uruguay Round of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade is struggling with agricultural strategy.
   The U.S. view, advocated vigorously by Yeutter for years, is
that trade-distorting policies, including export subsidies and some
internal price supports, are bad for everybody.
   Some countries share the U.S. position, but others - notably the
European Community - are balking. As a result, there is a
possibility the trade talks could wind up at an impasse on some of
the major agricultural issues.
   ``People have always speculated that the secretary was going to
leave after the Uruguay Round,'' Shipp said. ``But he never said
that, he doesn't feel that way. He hasn't even focused on life
after (USDA), whenever that's going to be.''
   When President-elect Bush chose him as agriculture secretary in
December 1988, it was reported that Yeutter had really wanted to
get back into the private sector after 3{ years as trade
representative.
   There was also talk at the time that Yeutter and Bush had agreed
the USDA commitment would last only through the formulation of the
1990 farm bill - which is awaiting Bush's signature - and the
conclusion of the GATT negotiations.
   But Shipp said Yeutter made no such deal with Bush. ``He and the
president never talked about his departure,'' she said.
   Yeutter, who will be 60 on Dec. 10, has an interest in a
2,500-acre family farming operation in Nebraska. He holds
doctorates in law and economics and has held many public and
private posts, including Agriculture Department service in the
early 1970s and the presidency of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
from 1978 to 1985.

   Black workers at the Treasury Department
agency that produces dollars, stamps and government securities will
be given more opportunity for advancement under a court settlement
that also provides for $1.4 million in back pay.
   The settlement was announced Tuesday by lawyers who brought the
action and was confirmed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.
The bureau said it initiated the settlement and was pleased with
its terms.
   The agreement in U.S. District Court covers 248 present and
former employees of the bureau. It ends an 8-year-old lawsuit in
which black workers contended they were denied access to
higher-paying ``craft'' jobs such as bookbinders, printers or
pressmen.
   The bureau employs 750 craft workers and 1,750 non-craft
workers, said bureau spokesman Ira Polikoff.
   The lawsuit said the bureau perpetuated an old-boy network under
which white workers were brought in from private industry by
friends and relatives, and were given preferential treatment for
craft jobs.
   Whites held 85 percent of the craft jobs while blacks held
nearly 100 percent of the non-craft jobs, the plaintiffs argued.
   Blacks were held back by an apprenticeship system and written
tests that had nothing to do with the skills required for the
better jobs, the plaintiffs claimed. They added that blacks often
had to train the whites on equipment that was unique to the bureau.
   The settlement suspends the written-test requirement for
selecting apprentices to the craft jobs and shortens the
apprenticeship period. The agreement also sets aside 72 bookbinder
and pressman apprenticeships to be filled from within the bureau.
   Top officials of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing ``just
didn't seem to care'' about the discrimination built into the
hiring and apprenticeship system, said attorney David P. Donovan.
   Joseph M. Sellers of the Washington Lawyers Committee for Civil
Rights Under Law, called the situation at the bureau ``one of the
most egregious'' examples of discrimination in the federal
government.
   Polikoff said the bureau initiated the settlement, which
includes reforms suggested by Peter Daly after he took over as
bureau director in 1988.
   ``He saw that the system was outdated and that it needed to be
modernized,'' Polikoff said. He disagreed with Sellers'
characterization of the degree of discrimination, and said that in
1983 the bookbinders apprentices consisted of 17 blacks and one
woman.
   The settlement also provides for wage increases for 39 employees
costing $300,000 in the first year of the settlement and pension
increases for 44 retired employees at a cost of more than $170,000
a year, according to a statement from the Washington law firm of
Wilmer, Cutler &amp; Pickering, whose attorneys brought the lawsuit.

<HEAD>Hubble Records Major Storm on Saturn: Caused by a `Burp?'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Through the eye of the Hubble Telescope,
scientists have recorded a gigantic storm blowing across Saturn at
more than 1,000 mph, sending ammonia clouds billowing 150 miles
into space.
   Pictures taken by the telescope's planetary camera show that the
storm, which began in September as an earth-sized white spot, now
girdles the planet in a band 6,000 miles across.
   ``It might just be the largest atmospheric structure right now
in the solar system outside of the sun,'' Andrew Ingersoll, a
planetary scientist from the California Institute of Technology,
said Tuesday. ``The last time Saturn did anything of this magnitude
was in 1933.''
   After amateur astronomers discovered the white spot in
September, the Hubble was trained on Saturn, the second largest
planet in the solar system. The flaw in the telescope's mirrors
does not detract from the instrument's ability to see such
relatively close objects.
   By Nov. 9 and 11 when the first pictures were taken, the storm
clouds ringed the planet with clearly visible swirls and loops. The
Hubble photographed Saturn again last weekend, bringing the number
of pictures to 400.
   They will be made into a film, said Charles Pellerin, director
of astrophysics at NASA headquarters, ``and pretty soon we'll be
able to watch what some people have called the storm of the century
evolve in great detail.''
   Astronomers don't know what is causing the great white belt of
clouds and whether it is diffusing as it spreads or whether
material from the planet is feeding it.
   ``These planets like Jupiter and Saturn are fluid objects, all
the way to the center,'' said Ingersoll. ``There are no volcanoes
erupting, because there are no volcanoes. There is no solid crust.
These planets are sort of bubbling cauldrons of liquid and gas.''
   The atmosphere of Saturn is composed of hydrogen and helium and
the clouds contain ammonia ice crystals and possibly a mixture of
sulfur and carbon compounds.
   Ingersoll discounted the possibility that a comet or other
celestial object hit Saturn or that the disturbance was formed by
smaller storms joining.
   ``It has to be some sort of internal intermittent thing on
Saturn, like Saturn burped,'' Ingersoll said. ``Why it should wait
so long to burp, I don't know.''
   Saturn, the second largest planet after Jupiter, is the windiest
place in the solar system with the storm being whipped by a west
wind of 1,000 mph.
   Ingersoll said heat is coming out of the deep interior of Saturn
and presumably pressures can build up. The planet's weather is not
driven just by sunlight as it is on Earth.
   ``I don't really understand it,'' he said. ``In some mysterious
way, which I don't have a clue about, Saturn burps in the
summertime ... this changing season could be part of it.''

<HEAD>Big Water Shortage Seen Possible in 1990s</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The decade of the '90s could confront America
with a water shortage as serious as the current oil-price
inflation, a top government water expert warns.
   ``As we move toward the 21st century, short supplies of clean
water could rival expensive oil as one of the nation's most serious
concerns unless we start now to implement strategies to better
manage our water supplies,'' Dr. Michael D. Hudlow said Tuesday.
   ``I believe we're headed into a water management crisis in the
1990s,'' said Hudlow, director of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration's Office of Hydrology.
   The severe drought that struck much of the nation in 1988 was
just the first round in what could become a continuing problem, he
explained. California already faces a serious water shortage.
   ``We're going to have real extreme drought conditions going into
next spring ... unless Mother Nature cooperates and gives us a
bumper crop of snowfall in the mountains of the West,'' Hudlow
said.
   In general, the water outlook in much of the West is precarious,
depending heavily on the winter snows, he said at a news conference
called to discuss water conditions and resources.
   ``Extreme drought still grips much of the West, from California
to Montana, and in parts of the Southeast. In mid-October, drought
conditions in much of Georgia and the Carolinas ended with a
significant flooding episode,'' Hudlow reported.
   Water shortages are developing as part of the normal variability
of climate, he said, with the relatively wet years of the 1970s and
early 1980s giving way to a drier period.
   And that does not include the threat of the so-called greenhouse
effect, which some scientists say could raise temperatures
worldwide and change rainfall patterns. If that does happen it
could just make things worse, said Hudlow.
   While forecasting floods and drought now depends on climate
records and short-term weather forecasts, Hudlow said a new water
supply forecasting system is being developed by his agency.
   Termed WARFS, for Water Resources Forecasting Service, the
system is being tested at the Colorado River Basin Forecast Office
in Salt Lake City.
   Using long-range climate and weather models, the system can
study the conditions in a local river basin and calculate
probabilities of floods, drought or a return to normal conditions
seasonally and farther into the future.
   If the testing goes well the system could be put into national
service by 1992, assuming money is available, Hudlow said.
   The new system could provide local water managers and civil
defense officials the probabilities of danger or drought on which
they could make decisions, he explained.
   For example, reservoir managers might be reluctant to reduce
water levels out of concern that they would later have too little
water for generating power, irrigating crops and other uses. But if
they had a reliable forecast that there was a good chance of severe
flooding, a decision could be made to lower reservoir levels so
flood water could be trapped and damage prevented.
   ``We didn't do it right in '88. We've got to get in a position
to do it right now,'' Hudlow said, referring to the lack of
accurate forecasts of water conditions in that drought year.

<HEAD>Ford Resigns as Honorary Chairman of PAC Headed by Gingrich</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Ford resigned as honorary
chairman of a Republican political action committee a week after
Democrats complained to him about a controversial word list the
group developed for GOP campaigning.
   But Penny Circle, a spokeswoman for the former president, said
Tuesday that his Oct. 8 resignation as honorary chairman of GOPAC
was not related to the complaint he received Oct. 1 from Rep. Beryl
Anthony, D-Ark., chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee.
   ``It was just coincidental,'' she said.
   Anthony's complaint was based on a 131-word list drafted by
GOPAC that urged Republican candidates to use words such as
``greed,'' ``sick,'' ``permissive'' and ``liberal'' when describing
Democratic opponents and words such as ``children,'' ``common
sense,'' ``reform'' and ``family'' when referring to themselves.
   The list also suggested that Democrats should be described as
``traitors,'' but GOPAC later removed that word from the training
brochure it mailed to some 6,000 Republican candidates and
officeholders nationwide.
   Anthony wrote Ford in September asking him to ``demonstrate your
support for decency in our nation's political life'' by repudiating
GOPAC, whose general chairman is House Republcan Whip Newt
Gingrich of Georgia.
   Ford replied, in a letter Anthony released Tuesday, that he had
resigned the post because of a desire ``to reduce significantly my
political activity.''
   He did not mention the GOPAC word list but said he had delayed
his response because he did not want it to become an issue in the
1990 elections.
   ``In view of this decision, I do not feel I should comment
further,'' the former president wrote.
   In his complaint to Ford, Anthony characterized the list as
``demagoguery without limits, without content and without
honesty.''
   ``As an individual who has devoted his life to public service, I
am sure you will find these activities as disgusting as I do,''
Anthony wrote. He sent Ford a copy of the list ``in the event that
you have not seen it.''
   Howard ``Bo'' Callaway, a former Georgia congressman who is
chairman of GOPAC, said Ford, 77, stopped signing letters for the
group about two years ago when he began cutting back his political
activities.
   ``He's clearly from everything I understand just getting out of
all political things,'' Callaway said. ``He has never expressed any
dissatisfaction of any kind to me and I think we're close enough he
would have.''

   ``It'' gripped viewers and ``The Big One''
shook them as the two dramas grabbed high ratings on television
last week.
   Part two of NBC's ``The Big One,'' about a killer earthquake in
Southern California, finished third in A.C. Nielsen Co. rankings
released Tuesday. Part one of Stephen King's ``It,'' about a
child-murdering entity, was fifth.
   ABC's ``Barbara Walters Special'' finished sixth. It featured
Delta Burke's teary rekindling of her feud with the producers of
her sitcom, ``Designing Women.''
   For the sixth time of the 9-week-old fall season, NBC's
``Cheers'' was the most-watched show on television. ``60 Minutes''
on CBS was No. 2.
   In overall ratings, NBC was first with a 13.4 average. ABC had a
13.3 and CBS an 11.9. Each ratings point represents 931,000
television homes.
   For the 45th consecutive week, ABC and Peter Jennings won the
network news with an 11.2 average. CBS and Dan Rather and NBC and
Tom Brokaw tied at 9.7.
   Here are the top 10 shows, their network and rating: ``Cheers,''

<HEAD>Dairy Industry, FDA Defend Safety of Milk Supply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Milk producers and the Food and Drug
Administration say the nation's milk supply is safe despite a
congressional report that contends federal testing methods are
inadequate.
   ``Milk is one of the most tested food Americans consume,'' said
Jim Barr, chief executive officer of the National Milk Producers
Federation. ``The industry is constantly working with farmers, milk
processors and state and federal governments to refine the testing
procedures that guarantee the purity of the milk supply from cow to
consumer.''
   His comments came Tuesday after Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., released
a report from the General Accounting Office that criticized the FDA
for not being able to detect certain animal drug residues in milk.
   ``GAO found that we cannot rely on FDA's assurances of safety
because FDA has absolutely no idea of the incidence of harmful drug
residues in milk,'' said Weiss.
   Dr. Gerald Guest, director of the FDA's center for veterinary
medicine, said the report's ``recommendations are things we will
work on and need to work on.''
   He said the FDA began improving its milk-testing methods after
Weiss' Government Operations subcommittee held hearings on the
subject last February.
   The milk ``is safe, but there are areas we should work to make
it safer,'' said Guest.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, said its findings
``suggest a need for more thorough examination by FDA to identify
the types and amounts of animal drug residues that may be
contaminating milk.''
   Even if the FDA had conducted a more thorough survey, ``the
results would still be of limited value because FDA lacks test
methods to detect and confirm most of the drugs believed to be used
in dairy cows, and some of FDA's test methods cannot detect drug
residues at the concern level set for human consumption,'' the
report said.
   The GAO recommended that the FDA:
   -Ask the states and the dairy industry to routinely provide them
with the results of screening tests for drug residues and
information about their testing methods.
   -Help states evaluate commercially available screening tests and
encourage that those found effective for sulfa, tetracycline and
other drugs be included in the surveys now primarily used just for
penicillins.
   -Speed up efforts to develop new testing methods.
   -Work closely with the states to confirm on a random basis the
types and amounts of drug residues found in state screening
samples.
   -If widespread misuse of drugs is found, the FDA should reassess
its policies on drugs it allows for dairy cows and take appropriate
regulatory action.

<TEXT>
   The Daily News took a new tack in the nearly
month-long strike against the tabloid by suing 11 people for
allegedly burning a delivery truck, stealing bundled papers or
attacking replacement drivers.
   Evidence in two of the three lawsuits filed in state court
Tuesday includes videotapes made by management, newspaper spokesman
John T. Sloan said.
   Each lawuit seeks $100,000 in punitive damages and unspecified
compensatory damages. They claim defendants hurt the paper's
ability to do business.
   One lawsuit claims that a member of the drivers union set fire
to a truck outside the paper's Brooklyn printing plant on Oct. 25,
the night the strike began.
   Another claims two Wall Street Journal drivers stole bundles of
the News that had been left off at a drop-off point by non-union
drivers on Oct. 30.
   The third lawsuit accuses eight people of attacking non-union
drivers and independent distributors on Oct. 31 at a paper drop-off
point.
   Nine unions representing more than 2,000 employees at the
nation's third-largest newspaper went on strike over what they said
were unfair labor practices. The walkout followed month of
unsuccessful contract talks.
   In a separate court action, strikers won a victory when U.S.
District Court Judge Jack B. Weinstein issued a temporary
restraining order Tuesday night permitting striking pressmen to
expand pickets outside the Brooklyn plant.
   The pressmen complained management and police infringed on their
rights by confining pickets to side streets on either end of the
block-long plant.

<HEAD>Automaker, Union Inaugurate Program on Repetitive Motion Trauma</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. is the last of the Big
Three U.S. automakers to establish a program for helping workers
ward off potentially crippling repetitive motion injuries.
   One hundred thirty-eight plants and an estimated 302,000 workers
will take part in an effort similar to those being undertaken by
Chrysler Corp. and Ford Motor Co. last year and earlier this year,
Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said Tuesday.
   The GM pact is part of a settlement of government charges that
the nation's largest automaker violated safety and health rules at
plants in Trenton, N.J., and Oklahoma City, Okla. GM will pay
$360,000 in fines for the alleged violations.
   ``The transformation of the workplace required by this agreement
won't be possible overnight,'' said Stephen P. Yokich, a UAW vice
president. ``But if we are to make progress, there must be an
immediate recognition by the management at each individual plant of
the full extent of the problem.''
   A spokeswoman said GM would have no immediate comment.
   Repetitive motion traumas, also referred to as cumulative trauma
disorders, are disorders of the musculoskeletal and nervous systems
caused by repetitive motions or exertion over extended periods.
   Painful and sometimes crippling, they range from back injuries
to a nerve disorder of the hand and wrist to various tendon
ailments. They comprise about 48 percent of the workplace injuries
for which the department's Occupational Safety and Health
Administration keeps records.
   Preventive measures include redesigning work stations t better
accommodate the body by, for example, adjusting workbench heights.
Also, devices can be used to prevent excessive lifting or similar
exertions. Tools and training can be redesigned.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses Bail For Son Of Interior Secretary</HEAD>

   A judge has refused bail to the son of
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan, saying Robert Jeffrey Lujan, who
was arrested on a rape charge, was ``an unreasonable danger'' to
the community.
   Circuit Court Judge Donald M. Haddock in suburban Alexandria,
Va., on Tuesday rejected an appeal from Lujan's attorney who argued
that the young man was not a threat to flee and had no history of
violent behavior.
   Lujan's attorney, Robert Powell, said he would take the case to
the Virginia Court of Appeals.
   Lujan, 28, was arrested Wednesday and held without bail on
charges of raping a woman resident of the same apartment building
where Lujan lives with his parents.
   The 48-year-old woman testified she awoke to find Lujan - naked
and armed with a shotgun - sitting on her bed.
   Powell has said Lujan has admitted spending several hours in the
woman's apartment, but added the woman invited him to the apartment
and that the sexual relations were consentual.
   Manuel Lujan said after the arrest that his son, who had a
federal felony drug conviction in 1983, has a severe drinking
problem.

<HEAD>New AIDS Vaccine Candidate Approved For Early Clinical Trials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new AIDS vaccine candidate that has been
shown to work in one chimpanzee has won approval for early human
clinical tests.
   The candidate vaccine approved for further testing by the Food
and Drug Administration was developed through the cooperation of
the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the
National Cancer Institute and Immuno-U.S., Inc., a Rochester, Mich.
branch of an Austrian company.
   At a news conference Tuesday, company officials said the
clinical trials will test the safety of the vaccine and determine
whether the 60 test subjects develop antibodies against human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. This
first step of human testing, called Phase I trials, will not use
AIDS patients.
   If the vaccine proves to be safe and shows promise, then Phase
II trials will more thoroughly test for protection against AIDS. A
final phase of testing would be required before the FDA releases
the vaccine for general use.
   The candidate vaccine is a genetically-engineered synthetic
glycoprotein that was derived from the envelope, or skin, of the
HIV1 virus. This part of the virus envelope is called gp160. The
theory is that the body's immune system will react to gp160 and
develop antibodies. These antibodies then would trigger an immune
response in the body should there be contact with the HIV virus.
   Dr. Martha Eibl, director of AIDS vaccine research at Immuno AG,
the parent company of Immuno-U.S., said that two forms of the
vaccine were tested on four chimpanzees.
   The chimps were injected with the candidate vaccine and then
injected with the AIDS virus, using a dose that is 100 times the
amount needed to cause an infection in the laboratory.
   All four of the chimps developed some immune response, and one
of the animals remained free of AIDS.
   ``It has protected a chimp from productive infection for nearly
three years,'' Eibl said of the candidate vaccine. ``That is the
longest protection up to now.''

   A man who burned himself to death on the steps
of the Capitol has been identified as a Vietnamese newspaper
publisher who recently moved from California to Washington.
   Authorities were unable to identify Nguyen Kim Bang, 56, after
the Monday incident because he was burned beyond recognition. He
doused himself with a flammable liquid and set himself afire on the
steps of the Capitol's West Front.
   A law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity
identified the man Tuesday and said he moved here two months ago to
help start a newspaper in northern Virginia.
   Acquaintances said he had been distressed about the treatment of
his fellow countrymen in Germany and about his own strained ties
with a newspaper in California, the Vietnam Daily News of San Jose.
   The law enforcement official and acquaintances said Bang
evidently had spent time in a ``re-education'' camp after North
Vietnamese communists overran the South and later became one of the
boat people who fled Vietnam by sea.

   Atlantis ended its secret mission
where it began, making the first shuttle landing in Florida since
1985. Many NASA workers who launch the spaceships got their first
chance to see one come back.
   Rain-dampened desert runways and high wind kept Atlantis from
landing in the California desert as planned. NASA opted for clear
skies, calm winds and the concrete runway at Kennedy Space Center
for touchdown Tuesday afternoon.
   ``We didn't expect to be here when we left,'' mission commander
Richard Covey, an Air Force colonel, said after the spacecraft
touched down.
   During their secret Pentagon mission, Atlantis' five astronauts
put in orbit a satellite to spy on Iraq.
   Atlantis' astronauts had planned to return on Monday, but high
winds at Edwards Force Base, Calif., forced them to stay in space
another day. Rain at the Mojave Desert base Monday night left the
natural surface runways too wet on Tuesday, and the wind was too
high for a landing on Edwards' concrete runway.
   So NASA decided to use Kennedy, where Atlantis touched down on
the 2.8-mile paved runway, its arrival heralded by its signature
twin sonic booms.
   Kennedy workers, given just a few hours' notice, scrambled to
prepare for the landing. About 250 people cheered the near-perfect
touchdown. They included two busloads of launch control center
workers who had counted down to Atlantis' fiery liftoff in an
unusual nighttime launch five days earlier.
   ``You have to remember that half the workforce (at Kennedy) has
never seen a shuttle landing,'' said launch director Bob Sieck.
``It's a real treat for them and of course we're thankful for it.''
   It was the sixth shuttle landing at Kennedy. The last was in
1985, when Discovery blew a tire and sustained brake damage on
touchdown.
   Atlantis appeared to be in good shape, with only a few dings in
the heat-resistant tiles, said William Lenoir, head of NASA's
spaceflight program.
   The shuttle had enough supplies to stay in orbit until Thursday
if necessary.
   The mission, delayed since July by hydrogen leaks, was the
seventh and last secret shuttle flight for the Pentagon, which
still plans to fly unclassified cargoes on two more shuttles but
will use unmanned rockets for secret payloads.
   The Pentagon ordered a news blackout on the mission, but sources
said the crew deployed a satellite that will conduct photo surveys
or eavesdrop on communications in the Persian Gulf.
   ``One of these days we'll be able to tell you about Dick and
Frank and Carl and Bob and Sam's excellent adventure,'' Covey told
a crowd of about 150 people on the crew's return to Houston hours
after the landing. ``For now, it'll have to remain under ropes and
under tight cover.''
   The other crew members were pilot Frank Culbertson Jr., a Navy
commander, and Army Maj. Charles ``Sam'' Gemar, Air Force Lt. Col.
Carl Meade and Marine Col. Robert Springer, all mission
specialists.
   Among those greeting the astronauts in Houston were their wives,
who had been at Edwards for landing.
   NASA plans to use Kennedy for more landings but prefers Edwards
because it has a variety of lakebed runways and a concrete strip to
choose from, weather more stable than Florida's, and wide-open
spaces with more room for error.
   The space agency saved $1 million and about a week's time by
using Kennedy since Atlantis doesn't have to be taken back to
Florida atop a jetliner.
   Columbia, also grounded this summer by hydrogen leaks, is
scheduled to fly next, in early December, on an astronomy mission.

<HEAD>Harvard Law Students Sue School to Broaden Minority Faculty Hiring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Harvard Law School students
turned their legal training into a weapon against their own school
with a lawsuit aimed at getting more minorities hired as
professors.
   ``Today we use the only instrument of power Harvard Law School
seems to understand,'' said second-year student John Bonifaz.
``Today we take Harvard to court.''
   The lawsuit filed Tuesday and signed by 11 students accused the
Ivy League school of failing to hire any minority women, American
Indians, Asian-Americans, disabled people, openly homosexual men
and women, or Hispanics to the permanent faculty.
   It also claims Harvard discriminates against white women and
blacks in its faculty hiring.
   ``The complaint does not have merit, and in due course we will
submit a formal response to the Superior Court,'' law Dean Robert
C. Clark said in a statement.
   The student group that sued, the Harvard Law Coalition for Civil
Rights, said five of 66 tenured and tenure-track faculty members at
the law school are women, or 7.58 percent. Nationwide, at law
schools approved by the American Bar Association, 23.7 percent of
faculty members are women.
   Of the school's four tenure-track faculty members, two are
black, the lawsuit said. Three of 62 tenured positions, or 4.84
percent, are held by blacks.
   Clark did not challenge the students' figures but countered that
about one-third of the school's part-time lecturers are women or
minorities.
   The lawsuit seeks to force Harvard to give weight to diversity
in its hiring and establish an affirmative action plan and other
corrective measures.
   In 1971 Derrick Bell became the first black appointed to a
full-time faculty position at the law school, founded in 1817. Bell
in April took an unpaid leave of absence to protest Harvard's
hiring policies.
   He joined the students at a sidewalk news conference after the
lawsuit was filed.

<HEAD>28 Leftist Leaders Arrested, Charged With Seeking Armed Revolution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security officers have arrested 28
leftist leaders on charges of plotting armed revolution and
instigating violent labor and campus protests, police and new
reports said today.
   Police said that since the crackdown began last month, 13
radical student and labor leaders have been arrested on charges of
organizing the Workers Struggle League, with 170 members at 60
factories in five cities.
   Police said the group has sought an armed revolution led by
students and workers to topple the government of President Roh
Tae-woo and establish a communist state.
   The group has operated a phony trading company in Seoul, the
Jaeil (first) Planning Co., and ordered workers and students to set
up revolutionary bases in factories, police said.
   Police said the group has described South Korea as a U.S. colony
and campaigned for the ouster of what they called the nation's
pro-U.S. dictatorship. About 43,000 U.S. troops are stationed in
the country under a mutual defense pact.
   In a related but separate crackdown, Yonhap, the South Korean
news agency, quoted the Agency for National Security Planning as
saying it arrested 15 dissidents and students last month.
   Those arrested by the security agency were accused of organizing
the Vangard Line, an underground group allegedly following North
Korea's revolutionary propaganda, Yonhap said.
   The agency's crackdown began Oct. 24, when security officers
arrested Song Gap-suk, head of Chondaehyup, a nationwide radical
student alliance.
   Song and other radical students were alleged to have sought
secret contacts with Communist North Korea through the Libyan
embassy in Seoul, Yonhap said.
   Song's group has organized violent anti-U.S. and anti-government
protests. Security officers are tracking down other student
leaders, Yonhap said.
   All are to be charged with violations of the National Security
Law, which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison.
   More than 100 radical students and dissidents have been arrested
this year on similar charges. In a major crackdown last month, the
security agency crushed a 1,600-member revolutionary ring and
arrested 40 leaders.
   South Korea's leftist movement has mushroomed in the past 10
years, with radical leaders calling for armed revolution and using
factories and campuses for their bases.
   The radicals have staged violent street protests, but their
violent tactics and ideological extremism have failed to build
widespread public support. U.S. facilities have been firebombed
frequently.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar today
presented a 32-member Cabinet dominated by loyalists who helped
propel him into office after political and religious turmoil sank
the previous government.
   The ministers who took their oaths of office include just two
with a long history in the top ranks of national government.
   Seven others served as junior ministers during Prime Minister
V.P. Singh's government, which lasted just 11 months, but sided
with Chandra Shekhar when he split Singh's Janata Dal Party two
weeks ago.
   Singh lost a vote of confidence on Nov. 6, and Chandra Shekhar
replaced him four days later.
   No portfolios were announced during the swearing-in ceremony,
but Press Trust of India said Chandra Shekhar retained the top
ministerial posts in defense, home affairs and information and
broadcasting for himself.
   Press Trust and another news agency, United News of India, later
reported a breakdown for the other ministries.
   Deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal was given agriculture and
tourism. Devi Lal was minister of agriculture under the previous
government until being forced out in a power struggle with Singh.
   Vidyacharan Shukla, who held a half-dozen Cabinet posts between
1966 and 1980, is the new foreign minister.
   The swearing-in ceremony at the presidential palace was marred
when police beat journalists, snatched cameras and kicked them out
of the palace.
   Police prevented about 100 journalists from entering the
ceremonial hall, claiming they had arrived too late. At least two
reporters' arms were cut by glass when the window in a door was
smashed.
   Police grabbed at least two cameras from photographers and beat
several journalists with bamboo staves.
   ``This is a brutal act by the police,'' Subodh Kant Sahay,
minister of state for home affairs in the new government, said
later. Sahay held the same post in the previous government.
   Sahay will also be minister of state for information and
broadcasting. Minister of state is a junior rank below minister.
   The Indian Press Association issued a statement condemning the
attack.
   Chandra Shekhar, whose splinter group, the Janata Dal
(Socialist) Party, commands barely 10 percent of the seats in
Parliament, became prime minister with the support of the
opposition leader, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
   Gandhi's Congress Party holds 195 seats in the 522-member lower
house of Parliament, giving him the power to bring down the new
government at any time.
   The Singh government collapsed when a right-wing Hindu party
withdrew its support a month ago following the arrest of its
leader. Lal Krishnan Advani, head of the Bharatiya Janata Party,
was detained while leading a cross-country caravan to rally support
for a campaign to build a Hindu temple on a site already occupied
by a Moslem mosque.
   At least 386 people were killed in Hindu-Moslem riots touched
off by the temple-building project.

<TEXT>
   Bill Irwin today neared the end of his
eight-month, 2,167-mile quest to become the first blind person to
hike the entire Appalachian Trail.
   Accompanied on his odyssey by his guide dog, Orient, he planned
to walk the final 2.4 miles to Baxter State Park in the Maine
wilderness this morning.
   Irwin, a 50-year-old recovered alcoholic who lost his sight to
an eye disease when he was 28, decided to attempt the feat as an
affirmation of his faith in God. Sponsors helped pay his expenses.
   ``I'm no great example of anything,'' the Burlington, N.C.,
resident said in a September interview. ``Any blind person that is
capable could do the same thing if they wanted to go through the
same difficulty.''
   A party was planned in Irwin's honor at a lodge tonight, said
Carolyn Starling, a friend who served as his spokeswoman during his
journey from Georgia. Eighteen fellow members of Irwin's church
traveled to Maine by bus last weekend from Burlington, N.C., to
celebrate Irwin's achievement, she said.
   In recent days, Irwin has hiked in snow and sleet, but today's
forecast held what Ms. Starling called ``prayed-to-order weather.''
   ``It's such a fitting end,'' she said.
   Since setting out from Georgia in March, Irwin has fallen down
dozens of times. He has broken a rib, worn out equipment and coped
with foul weather.
   He said in September that the scariest part of the trip was
``starting out on Springer Mountain all alone in the middle of the
worst flood in the history of Georgia ... not even knowing how I
was going to get down the trail.''
   Though he couldn't see the magnificent vistas or trailside
sunsets during his trek, Irwin said he found solace in the silence
of the woods and beauty in the odors and other sensations of
nature.
   At the urging of Baxter State Park officials, he interrupted his
hike in late October to climb mile-high Mount Katahdin - normally
the last northern leg of the trail - before winter weather closed
that section of the trail.

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. is recalling about 520,000
1989-90 cars because of a faulty switch that can keep the brake
lights from going on and the cruise control from turning off.
   The No. 1 automaker said Tuesday its is recalling certain
1989-90 Pontiac Grand Prix, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supremes, Buick
Regals and 1990 Chevrolet Lumina cars.
   GM dealers will inspect the cars and replace the switch for
free, spokesman David Sloan said Tuesday.
   ``It's a safety recall so you want to get it fixed as soon as
possible,'' he said.
   Since 1989, GM has learned of 10 accidents, including four minor
injuries, in which the defect allegedly was present, Sloan said.
   None of the accidents involved fatalities.
   The cars may have a faulty switch that can result in the brake
lights not going on when the brakes are applied, or staying on all
the time.
   If cruise control is being used, the cruise control, which
normally shuts off when the brakes are applied, may resume when the
brakes are released, GM said.
   When that occurs, the cruise control can be turned off manually
or by reapplying the brakes, GM said.

<TEXT>
   Margaret Thatcher may lose her job
next week, but Britain's Iron Lady kept a stiff upper lip at a
glittering feast for summit leaders.
   The British prime minister chatted politely with her Belgian
counterpart, Wilfried Martens, just two hours after being pushed
into a second-round vote for the leadership of her Conservative
Party.
   If she loses next week, Mrs. Thatcher will be out of a 15-year
job as party leader and will step down as prime minister.
   But Mrs. Thatcher put on a brave face and a black-and-red
brocade gown after hearing the news and attended a ballet and
five-course dinner at Versailles Palace.
   Seated at a dinner table as long as a fashion runway in the
shimmering Hall of Mirrors, Mrs. Thatcher smiled for photographers
but refused to comment on her future.
   Seated directly across the table, ironically, was French Premier
Michel Rocard, who survived a narrow no-confidence vote Monday in
the National Assembly.
   What was Mrs. Thatcher's mood? She wasn't letting on. A British
diplomat who was asked the question simply threw back his head and
roared in laughter.
   ---
   Ever the polite host, French President Francois Mitterrand held
up the ballet performance by star dancers of the Paris Opera while
Mrs. Thatcher made her entrance 25 minutes late.
   The troupe performed a medley of pieces by Tchaikovsky, Auguste
de Bournonville and Marius Pepita.
   Later, between bites of a dinner roll, President Bush offered
the simple critique: ``That ballet was good.''
   ---
   Mitterrand beamed from his seat at the center of the table next
to First Lady Barbara Bush. Few leaders can throw a party in a
place like Versailles.
   Built by King Louis XIV during the 17th century, the chateau and
its manicured gardens and fountains define grandeur, Gallic style.
Dining in the Hall of Mirrors aglow with chandeliers requires a
menu equal to the venue.
   The army of chefs feeding 120 heads of state or government and
their spouses and ministers settled on the following:
   Shellfish soup, lobster from Brittany, capon dressed with foie
gras, cheese and iced nougat sprinkled with Grand Marnier liqueur.
They washed it down with two vintage wines, a 1978 Chateau-Margaux
and 1985 Puligny-Montrachet.
   Coffee was in high demand among the summit leaders, who heard 21
speeches during day-long conferences Tuesday.
   ---
   Marie Antoinette supposedly mocked starving peasants with the
line, ``Let them eat cake.'' She lost her head. Today's French
leaders have learned their lesson in a land where the stomach is
the real king.
   The thousands of police officers, journalists, paramedics and
ordinary palace workers dined on bouillabaisse, creamy veal stew
and rich chocolate mousse in a palace wing converted into a
100-table dining room.
   ``I hear in America they just get sandwiches,'' a gendarme said,
shaking his head. ``Poor guys.''

   Exposed as lip-syncing frauds, the Milli
Vanilli duo say that rather than come clean about the sham, they
once took a dialect coach on tour with them to help them shed their
foreign accents.
   ``Every time we gave an interview, the reporters would hear my
French accent or Rob's German accent and they'd say, `No way. How
could these guys have sung the songs?''' Fabrice Morvan said in
today's Los Angeles Times.
   ``We didn't want to do any more interviews,'' said his partner,
Rob Pilatus. ``The more we talked, the worse things got.''
   Dialect Accent Specialists in Los Angeles was hired in August
1989 and paid by Arista Records to accompany Pilatus and Morvan and
help them sound more like the singing voices they mouthed on their
hot-selling album, they told the Times.
   On Monday, the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences
stripped Milli Vanilli of its Grammy after its producer confirmed
rumors that Pilatus and Morvan were just front men on the album
that won them best new artist honors in February.
   The pair met reporters Tuesday and heaped blame on their German
producer, Frank Farian. They claimed he took advantage of them when
they were down and out in Munich.
   ``We were seduced, we were abused and we felt very guilty,''
Pilatus said.
   The deception began to unravel at a 1989 concert when their
audio system playing the album ``Girl You Know It's True'' started
to skip like a broken record, the Times reported today. The
recording at the Bristol, Conn., show kept rerunning the lyrics:
``Girl you know it's, Girl you know it's ...''
   ``I knew right then and there it was the beginning of the end
for Milli Vanilli,'' Pilatus told the newspaper. ``When my voice
got stuck in the computer and it just kept repeating and repeating,
I panicked. I just ran off the stage.''
   Pilatus and Morvan, both 25, said at Tuesday's news conference
that they had been pressing Farian to let them sing on the next
album.
   ``We said to Frank Farian, `You don't let us sing on the album.
Don't do this anymore,'' Pilatus said. ``We don't want to live like
this.
   ``We don't want to be embarrassed every night by Arsenio Hall.
We didn't want to go to clubs and (have) every girl say, `Hey, you
don't sing on the records.' We wanted to stop.''
   Their album sold 7 million copies and made the two unknowns
international stars. Pilatus said it actually featured vocalists
Johnny Davis, Brad Howell and Charles Shaw.
   Pilatus said he and Morvan were offered $4,000 each to become
Milli Vanilli when they were living in a Munich housing project and
were so poor they had to steal food.
   ``You get something, but for that you make a pact with the
devil,'' Pilatus said.
   ``We really love our fans. ... We just hope that they understand
that we were young, that we just wanted to live the life the
American way.''
   Clive Davis, president of Arista Records, knew they were faking,
the pair and manager Carsten Heyn claimed, despite repeated Arista
denials.
   Pilatus, born in New York and raised in Germany, and Morvan, a
native of Guadaloupe in the French West Indies, intend continue to
their musical career - minus the Milli Vanilli name.
   The new monicker?
   ``Rob and Fab, the German and the French,'' Pilatus said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush counseled ``just be patient'' when
pressed on why the Soviet Union hadn't joined his call for a
resolution authorizing military force against Kuwait. But in the
end, Bush seemed to be the impatient one.
   By seeking support for a resolution dealing with war at a
conference dedicated to peace, Bush may have given the impression
of pushing too hard. That threatened to alienate some of those who
stood with the United States in earlier United Nations actions
against international outlaw Iraq.
   Even so, the president declared today that ``we're on the same
wavelength as the Soviet Union'' on Persian Gulf policy, despite
departing Paris without a new UN resolution backed by the Soviets
in his pocket.
   Bush was heading to the Middle East - where he will meet with
Saudi and exiled Kuwaiti officials today, U.S. forces on
Thanksgiving and Egyptian officials on Friday - without the the
clear consensus he had hoped to forge while here at a 34-nation
European summit.
   The president's hand on the Persian Gulf also may have been
weakened by the political defeat delivered to British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher on Tuesday by her own Conservative
Party. Mrs. Thatcher, who was forced into a second party leadership
vote next week, has been Bush's staunchest ally in insisting that
the military option be left open in the gulf.
   At a news conference today before leaving Paris, Bush hinted
that he and Gorbachev had reached understandings on how to proceed
against Saddam Hussein that he could not publicly divulge.
   He suggested this unity also may have been obscured by ``the
technicalities of diplomacy'' and that the ``coalition in the sands
and on the seas of the gulf'' was holding together.
   Like lobbyists on Capitol Hill in search of votes, Bush and
Secretary of State James A. Baker III worked the halls and the
elegant salons in which the 34-nation Conference on Cooperation and
Security in Europe had gathered to celebrate the end of East-West
hostilities.
   But the U.S. efforts failed to wring clearcut agreement from
summit leaders on what to do next to dislodge Iraq's Saddam Hussein
from Kuwait.
   When the summit leaders went into a closed-door session Tuesday
for concluding discusions, the crisis in the Persian Gulf didn't
even come up, participants said.
   After Bush's private dinner with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev on Monday night failed to produce a breakthrough, Baker
continued to press the president's case during two meetings Tuesday
with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   Speaking with reporters after the second meeting, Shevardnadze
stressed past U.S.-Soviet cooperation on the gulf. He noted it was
remarkable, considering the long history of rivalries.
   ``That unity and high level of solidarity that has been
accomplished in the course of preparation and adoption of past
Security Council resolutions is something that we cherish very
much,'' he said.
   ``So please don't make me get ahead of time,'' he added.
   The Soviets did agree that the United Nations should take
another look at the effectiveness of the sanctions it imposed on
Iraq, with an eye to ``new resolutions'' if necessary to enforce
the old ones.
   That narrowed the gap a little bit. But administration officials
said many differences remain.
   One Soviet official, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
suggested that ``Bush and Baker did not come here with a need to
decide anything urgently'' and might be getting a bum rap. ``It
seemed that they were interested in longer-range talks, in taking
the longer view,'' the official said.
   Even so, it was clear that administration officials had expected
more to happen.
   The two lecterns set up by the White House in the U.S.
ambassador's residence for a news conference that never happened -
one set high for the tall Bush, the other set lower for the more
stocky Gorbachev - were graphic testimony to that.
   Did Bush send out the wrong signals in trying to win support for
a more militant stance toward Iraq at a peace conference? ``I can
see the wisdom of that line of thought,'' said White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   But he suggested the need to build a consensus and ``having
everybody on board'' was more important than a question of location
and timing.

   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange continued
to decline in thin trading today, while the dollar closed sharply
lower against the yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which had shed
312.68 points on Tuesday, lost another 388.49 points, or 1.67
percent, closing at 22,816.99.
   A total of 260 million shares were traded on the first section,
up from 210 million shares Tuesday.
   Many securities firms and other institutional investors were
refraining from buying as they adjusted their positions for the
month's end, said Osamu Yamazaki, general manager of the equity
department at New Japan Securities Co.
   Also discouraging buyers, he said, were a sharp decline on Wall
Street overnight, continuing high interest rates in Japan and the
lingering Middle East crisis.
   The dollar closed at 127.68 yen, down 1.25 yen from Tuesday's
close of 128.93 yen. It opened at 128.68 yen and ranged between
127.45 yen and 128.70 yen.
   The dollar now has lost 2.05 yen in the last three trading days.
   Some $15.28 billion changed hands in today's spot trading, up
from $6.14 billion on Tuesday.
   Akihiko Kagawa, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, said the dollar
came under selling pressure through cross trading between the
German mark and the yen.
   Kagawa said yen buying followed a narrowing in differences
between Japanese and German interest rates. Higher interest rates
tend to make a country's currency more attractive to investors.
Kagawa said German rates began declining Tuesday.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 85.56 from Tuesday's close of
85.34. Their yield fell to 7.585 percent from 7.635 percent.

<TEXT>
   Navajo voters chose former Chairman
Peterson Zah to again lead the divided tribe as the first elected
successor to the jailed Peter MacDonald.
   ``The first order of business will be to put the tribe back
together,'' Zah told hundreds of supporters after defeating interim
President Leonard Haskie 46 percent to 32 percent Tuesday.
   Zah, chairman from 1983 to 1987, will be president, a position
replacing chairman under a newly created three-branch system of
government for the nation's biggest Indian tribe.
   Zah, 52, of Low Mountain, had 23,311 votes to Haskie's 16,354.
George P. Lee of Shiprock, N.M., an excommunicated official of the
Mormon church who had been MacDonald's running mate, had 11,407, or
22 percent, in write-in votes.
   Haskie, a 46-year-old engineer, said the vote totals show Zah
doesn't have a stronghold on tribal support.
   The tribe's Board of Election Supervisors disqualified MacDonald
from running against Zah after his Oct. 17 conviction in tribal
court on bribery, ethics and conspiracy charges. The Navajo Nation
Council then let Haskie face Zah.
   MacDonald, 61, was sentenced to nearly six years in a tribal
jail and five years of labor for taking cash, loans, plane rides
and the use of a car from businessmen trying to curry favor with
him. His son, Peter ``Rocky'' MacDonald Jr., 36, was convicted of
similar charges and sentenced to 1{ years in jail and a year of
labor.
   The elder MacDonald was suspended as chairman last year, during
his fourth term.
   He still faces trial on conspiracy charges stemming from the
tribe's purchase of a ranch for $33.4 million from a company that
paid $26.2 million for the property five minutes earlier, and on 93
fraud counts stemming from the tribe's 1986 elections.
   The council in April reorganized tribal government. The
president's powers are limited to heading the executive branch. The
new post of speaker was created to head the council, the tribe's
legislative branch. The tribe also has a judiciary.
   About 51 percent of the nearly 100,000 registered Navajo voters
cast ballots Tuesday. There are 219,000 Navajos in Arizona, New
Mexico and Utah.
   Voters made their choices by connecting symbols of broken arrows
to photos of the candidates or by writing in the candidates' names.
   Zah, an educator, campaigned on a platform of supporting family
and education. Haskie opposed the legalization of liquor on the
reservation and supported tribal ownership of mineral leases.

   Two city councilmen filed a federal
civil rights lawsuit seeking to block a two-term limit approved by
voters on Nov. 6.
   Charles Hazley and Robert Hernandez, who would be barred from
re-election under the new law, claimed in the lawsuit Tuesday that
the limit violates the Voting Rights Act of 1973 by restricting
minorities' choice of candidates.
   Term limits are fast becoming a trend among voters fed up with
incumbents. California, Colorado and Oklahoma in recent months
passed limits on how long politicians may serve, and similar
measures are being considered elsewhere.
   Hazley and Hernandez argued that city voters, the majority of
whom are white, restricted the choices of voters in predominantly
minority districts when they passed the term-limit measure.
   The measure would prevent nine of the 13 council members from
seeking re-election. All five minorities on the council are
affected, as are four whites. The four other council members are
white.
   Henry E. Lyons, chairman of the Committee to Limit Terms, said
minorities are not deprived of their voting rights under the term
limit any more than whites.
   The lawsuit seeks a court order allowing the councilmen to file
for re-election. The filing period opens Tuesday for the 1991
elections.

<HEAD>Candidate For Poland's Presidency Called a `Modern Indiana Jones'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 3 grafs to UPDATE with Tyminski faring even better
in more recent poll. Picks up 3rd pvs, `Canadian colleagues ...'
^By JEFFREY ULBRICH</NOTE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mysterious Polish emigre who exploded out of
nowhere to challenge for the presidency of his native land is
described by a close associate as a leader, a charmer and a
modern-day Indiana Jones.
   Stanislaw Tyminski, 42, has moved ahead of Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki in the most recent public opinion polls,
supported by 20 percent of respondents against 17 percent for
Mazowiecki as Sunday's election nears.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa leads with 27 percent in the
survey conducted by Poland's government polling service over the
weekend.
   Canadian colleagues of Tyminski say it all began as something of
a lark.
   Tyminski, head of several companies in North and South America,
turned a routine business trip to Warsaw in September into a run
for the presidency, according to business partner Frank Ollie.
   ``Look, he is a very mysterious guy,'' Ollie said, describing
Tyminski's route from Poland to Sweden to Canada to Peru to
self-made millionaire in the West to dark-horse candidate for the
top job in Warsaw.
   Tyminski traveled to Poland in September to attend to the
business of Transtek, a company he set up in his sister's name, and
to promote a book on his political and economic ideas written last
summer, entitled ``Sacred Dogs.''
   ``It was all fun in those days,'' Ollie said of Tyminski's early
presidential aspirations.
   It's not entirely fun now. Tyminski is being investigated for
slander for some of his comments, Polish newspapers are attacking
him and questions abound about the man who came home to run for
president after making his fortune.
   ``A Liar or a Fool,'' the pro-Mazowiecki Gazeta Wyborcza
newspaper said in a headline Tuesday. ``A week before the
elections, we know as much about Tyminski as he has told about
himself. And from what he says, and how he says it, an image of an
unbalanced individual emerges.''
   His colleagues across the Atlantic paint a much different
picture of the man who estimates his worth at $5 million.
   ``He is very charismatic,'' said Ollie, general manager of
Tyminski's Canadian-based computer company, Transduction. ``He
loves to talk. His stories are amazing. He would be a great dinner
guest. ... He is an excellent leader. Obviously he has a way about
him.''
   An adventurer?
   ``He is. I don't think there is any doubt about it. He's a bit
like a modern Indiana Jones. He just does crazy things,'' Ollie
said, referring to the rugged charcter in the adventure movies.
   According to Bob Spanski, Tyminski's ``North American campaign
manager,'' the candidate was born in a Warsaw suburb in January
1948. He left Poland at the age of 21, first going to Sweden, then
arriving pretty much penniless in Canada in 1970. He became a
Canadian citizen in 1975.
   Tyminski, who owns a 40-acre strawberry farm outside Toronto,
founded Transduction in the nearby suburb of Mississauga 15 years
ago. The private company produces industrial computers. Spanski
says its annual sales exceed $10 million. Tyminski also heads or is
associated with several other computer-related companies.
   ``He was in the right place at the right time, but he also took
some bold steps on the right products and made a lot of money out
of it,'' Ollie said.
   In the early 1980s, Tyminski went to Peru, ending up in Iquitos
on the upper Amazon.
   According to Ollie, Tyminski first built a barge to distribute
gasoline up and down the Amazon, but the army took a liking to it
and grabbed it. ``Rumor has it he lost $800,000 on it.''
   Then Tyminski decided the people of Iquitos needed cable
television.
   Now his main Peruvian interests include TVS Iquitos, a
radio-telephone business and a restaurant.
   ``Basically, the effect he had there was probably the exact
effect he had in Poland,'' Ollie said. ``He came in as a wealthy
gringo. He wanted to help the people.''
   He also married one. Tyminski and his Peruvian wife, Grace, have
three children. He also has a son by an earlier marriage.

   Black leaders accused police of a racist double
standard for their low-key investigation of the gang-rape and
murder of a young black woman.
   Eight teen-agers were arrested Monday in the slaying of Kimberly
Rae Harbour, 26, nearly three weeks after her mutilated body was
found on a playing field near the housing project where she lived
with her 7-year-old daughter.
   Investigators said the woman was repeatedly raped, beaten with a
bottle and a tree limb and stabbed more than 100 times on Oct. 31.
   ``The people of our community, particularly the women, were put
at risk by the police when they failed to inform the community,''
said Louis Elisa, president of the Boston chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   Police Commissioner Francis M. Roache said officers withheld
details of the grisly slaying to avoid jeopardizing the
investigation, but comparisons were immediately drawn to the
Charles Stuart case.
   Stuart, a white man, told police a black man had shot to death
his pregnant wife. Police questioned blacksuntil evidence began to
point to Stuart, who apparently jumped to his death in January when
he learned he was a suspect.
   ``In the Stuart case, Mayor (Raymond) Flynn was at the hospital
immediately making statements to the press and calling out every
available detective because there was some great threat to public
safety,'' Ellis-Hagler said.
   ``On this one we don't hear a whimper'' until weeks afterward,
he said.
   ``No one saw (Harbour's killing) as any great threat to public
safety,'' said the Rev. Graylan Ellis-Hagler, pastor of the Church
of the United Community. ``I can't help but think the difference is
that Stuart was white, and this victim was black.''
   David Rodman, spokesman for the district attorney's office, said
authorities were being placed in a no-win situation.
   ``In the Stuart case, the community was upset with the police
and the prosecution for publicizing the case,'' Rodman said. ``Now
they are criticizing us. You're really damned if you do and damned
if you don't.''

   CNN's tapes of Manuel Noriega's jailhouse phone
calls to his legal team are in the hands of a federal magistrate
who will help determine whether the former dictator's right to a
fair trial has been jeopardized.
   The network handed over a briefcase full of tapes on Tuesday
after the U.S. Supreme Court refused over the weekend to lift U.S.
District Judge William Hoeveler's temporary order barring CNN from
airing the recordings.
   U.S. Magistrate William Turnoff will make and study transcripts
and report to Hoeveler, who as the judge who will preside over
Noriega's trial on drug trafficking charges will weigh a defense
request to dismiss the case.
   Hoeveler assigned Turnoff to listen to the tapes to avoid being
``tainted'' by having learned details of Noriega's defense
strategy.
   No time limit for reviewing the tapes was set, but Noriega's
lead attorney, Frank Rubino, said the judge guaranteed it would
done ``with dispatch.''
   Rubino also asked Hoeveler to set a contempt hearing against CNN
for airing a conversation in alleged violation of the judge's
order. The judge did not immediately set a hearing, saying he must
await a decision by the chief judge of his judicial district on a
CNN request to remove him from the tapes case.
   CNN attorney Steven Korn wouldn't say how many tapes were turned
over. He would not discuss their contents or origins but said he
was confident that the judge will rescind his so-called prior
restraint on broadcast of the tapes.
   He said CNN believes it never violated the judge's order because
the telecast conversations did not deal with matters protected by
attorney-client confidentiality - in part because Rubino tacitly
agreed to broadcasting them when he identified them on the air.
   Noriega has asked that the case against him be dismissed because
of the taping, the freezing of his assets, and other alleged
government misconduct.
   The fallen dictator is jailed outside of Miami on charges of
taking bribes to protect the cocaine trade. His trial isn't
expected to begin before the spring.

   A state of emergency declared after ethnic

has been lifted, Tass reported today.
   The official Soviet news agency said the state of emergency
``accomplished its task'' and conditions in the republic had
stabilized.
   The clampdown was imposed on June 7, along with a curfew in the
capital of Frunze and the town of Osh, about 200 miles to the
south, where fighting between ethnic Kirghiz and Uzbeks claimed
more than 210 lives.
   The two ethnic groups, both largely Sunni Moslems who speak
Turkic dialects, are engaged in a dispute over the allocation of
land plots for building private houses.

<HEAD>Researchers: Parental Dieting, Praise Vital for Fat Kids</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Tubby kids stand a better chance of slimming down
and keeping the weight off if their overweight parents try to
reduce too, stay away from junk food and praise the children along
the way, researchers said today.
   ``If you have children who you don't want to eat potato chips,
you can't sit in front of them eating Ho-Hos,'' said psychologist
Leonard H. Epstein, head of the University of Pittsburgh's
Childhood Obesity Clinic and leader of the research team.
   Findings published in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association suggest child obesity need not persist into adulthood.
Previous research concluded that fat children will become fat
adults and that weight lost in dieting programs is typically
regained quickly.
   In the study, children who participated in a weight-loss program
as 6- to 12-year-olds and whose parents took part in similar
programs were significantly less obese 10 years later than those
whose parents received less training.
   Parental support, conveyed through praise and by maintaining
proper eating and exercise habits, made the difference, Epstein
said.
   ``If you have a family where both parent and child share the
problem, you have to include both in the treatment in order to
foster the best change in the children,'' he said.
   Despite the children's improvement, all parents in the study
were more obese after 10 years.
   In the project, 75 obese children and their parents were
randomly assigned to three groups. They were instructed to limit
consumption to no more than 1,500 calories a day and follow an
aerobic exercise program.
   All were asked to attend eight weekly treatment meetings
followed by six monthly meetings, then meetings at the 21-month,
five-year and 10-year marks.
   In one group, both parents and children received praise for
losing weight and were trained to praise other family members for
changing eating and exercise habits.
   In the second group, only the children received praise and were
trained to praise family members for weight-control behavior.
   Parents and children in the third group received praise only for
attending the meetings. They received information about social
reinforcement without specific training in how to use the method.
   All subjects lost weight initially. At the 10-year mark, the
children in the first group were, on average, 7.5 percent less
overweight than at the beginning of the study. Those in the second
and third groups were 4.5 percent and 14.3 percent fatter,
respectively.
   Although encouraging, the study needs to be repeated to confirm
its findings, Drs. Albert J. Stunkard of the University of
Pennsylvania medical school and Robert I. Berkowitz of the
Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic wrote in a journal editorial.
   Nevertheless, they said, the findings ``are the first evidence
that treatment of obesity in childhood can produce effects that
persist into young adulthood.''

   Even a clockmaker can't be expected to be
on time all the time. But 100 years late?
   Wait. Better make that 101 years.
   It was 1889 when workers erected the Jefferson County Courthouse
in this Rocky Mountain town, and blueprints called for three clocks
in the brick tower. The clocks were ordered from Germany. They
still haven't arrived.
   It wasn't until last year that county officials decided they'd
waited long enough.
   This time, the county contracted with a Helena electronics
distributor, who arranged for the manufacture of the timepieces in
Minnesota.
   Olivia Hagadone, chairwoman of the county's Museum Board, said
the clocks were supposed to be installed to mark the state's
centennial last year.
   But they were late - again.
   The clocks finally arrived last week, and the three 4-foot
clocks were installed in the building's steeple.
   Hagadone said supporters of the project raised about $5,000 to
buy and install the clocks.

   How did the turkeys that came to dinner
enjoy the food?
   They gobbled it up, of course.
   Paula Silver and Lorri Bauston cooked cornbread muffins,
cranberries, apple pie and stuffed squash Tuesday for six turkeys
at Ms. Silver's home. The two animal-rights activists held the meal
to promote humane treatment of poultry.
   ``The birds gobbled it up,'' Ms. Silver said. ``It was a
beautiful little spread.''
   Mrs. Bauston and her husband, Gene, operate an animal sanctuary
in upstate New York and are traveling the country with 15 turkeys
to publicize their cause.
   They are lobbying to have poultry protected under the federal
Humane Slaughter Act, which requires that farm animals be stunned
before they are killed for food.
   Ms. Silver, who adopted two of the Baustons' turkeys, lives in a
log house on 20 acres she shares with a wild mustang, four dogs, a
cat and several hens.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev led world leaders today in final rites for the Cold War
as a 34-nation summit ended with a triumphant declaration that the
``era of confrontation and division in Europe is over.''
   The celebration was tempered by concern over the Persian Gulf,
and the leaders departed Paris still apparently groping for
consensus on how to force Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait.
   The final act of the first post-Cold War European summit was
marked by the signing of the Charter of Paris, a written commitment
to democracy, human rights and economic freedom. ``We are closing a
chapter in history. The cold war is over and we now move on toward
working ... toward a peaceful and stable Europe,'' said Bush.
   It took only 15 minutes to sign the document, bound in red
leather, which signaled an end to an era of tensions in the nuclear
age.
   French President Francois Mitterrand was the first to sign. He
was followed by Helmut Kohl, chancellor of a newly unified Germany,
and the leaders of Poland, Hungary and other nations that until a
few months ago were hardline communist followers of the Soviet
Union.
   The summit opened on Monday with the formal signing of a
landmark treaty that slashes non-nuclear forces in Europe and a
companion non-aggression pact.
   But if the formal sessions were devoted to European security
issues in the post Cold War era, President Bush devoted much of his
backstage diplomacy to the Persian Gulf, where Iraq's occupation of
Kuwait is more than three months old.
   Bush, headed for the Middle East and a Thanksgiving Day visit
with U.S. troops there, departed without a public commitment from
Gorbachev to support a United Nations resolution authorizing the
use of force to dislodge Iraq's army from Kuwait.
   Even so, he said, ``I've said all along ... that we are on the
same wave length as the Soviet Union.'' He added he was ``very
encouraged about this holding together of a coalition in the sands
and on the seas of the Gulf.''
   The Soviets are calling for a meeting of the United Nations
Security Council, a position Gorbachev underscored after meeting
with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
   ``There is a need for a meeting of the U.N. Security Council
without delay to discuss the situation and take a decision there,''
Gorbachev said, describing the situaiton as ``very dangerous.''
   The summit document exulted in the end to Cold War tensions that
divided Europe for 45 years. Every European nation but Albania
signed, as did Canada, the United States and the Soviet Union.
   ``Europe is liberating itself from the legacy of the past,'' the
charter said. ``Ours is a time for fulfilling the hopes and
expectations our peoples have cherished for decades: steadfast
commitment to democracy based on human rights and fundamental
freedoms, prosperity through economic liberty and social justice,
and equal security for all countries.''
   The charter sets up a small bureaucracy in Prague for the
34-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, as well
as a center for the prevention of conflict in Vienna and an office
in Warsaw to help monitor elections.
   ``Democratic government is based on the will of the people,
expressed regularly through free and fair elections,'' the charter
said. ``Democracy is the best safeguard of freedom of expression,
tolerance of all groups of society, and equality opportunity for
each person.''
   The summit document also recommends that the heads of member
states and governments meet at least once every two years, their
foreign ministers annually and senior officials even more often.
   Bush, who met with Gorbachev over dinner on Monday night, said
he was leaving Paris convinced that ``we're in good
synchronization'' with other nations on strategy for ending the
gulf crisis.
   Nevetheless, the Persian Gulf was not discussed at Tuesday's
afternoon closed-door session, said French spokesman Hubert
Vedrine. He said the subject did not come up, adding: ``There will
be no common declaration by the 34 on the gulf.''
   There was not, and the leaders departed without devoting a line
of their summit charter to the issue.
   Asked by reporters if he had set a deadline for Iraqi withdrawal
from Kuwait, Bush replied, ``Just watch the way all this develops.
Everybody is convinced that they must get out of Kuwait with no
concessions, and that's what's emerging here.''

   The fruits of peace in Europe were evident in the summit
discussions.
   Several Eastern European leaders suggested that the Warsaw Pact
was headed for dissolution and appealed to the West for support to
avoid an economic Iron Curtain separating Europe's haves and
have-nots.
   Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel said he could imagine the
Warsaw Pact remaining, but only as ``a temporary consultative
organization'' on disarmament issues.
   Still, there was no shortage of problemsd to address:
   Kohl, leading his nation to its first major international forum
since unification, endorsed the appeals of Eastern European leaders
for Western financial support.
   ``There must now be no borders which perpetuate the prosperity
divide,'' he said. ``The ideological gulfs that have been overcome
must not be torn open again.''
   The social highlight of the summit came Tuesday night, when the
leaders gathered at the chateau of Versailles outside Paris for a
ballet performance and a banquet featuring lobster and capons.
   Among those on hand was Britain's Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, who learned shortly before the dinner that she faced a
second round of balloting in an unprecedented challenge to her
11-year reign as Conservative Party leader.
   The summit opened Monday after leaders of 16 North Atlantic
Treaty Organization members and the remaining six Warsaw Pact
nations put their signatures on two treaties - one making sweeping
cuts in non-nuclear arms throughout Europe and the other pledging
non-aggression toward one another.
   The so-called Conventional Forces in Europe treaty reduces
thousands of tanks, armored vehicles and other non-nuclear weapons
from the arsenals of the Warsaw Pact and NATO across Europe.
   U.S. and Soviet officials said Tuesday that Bush and Gorbachev
tentatively plan to meet in Moscow in January - hoping that
negotiators can first work out problems with a nuclear arms treaty.
   Havel was one of several leaders who, in summit speeches,
expressed regret that the Soviet Union's breakaway Baltic republics
- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - had been excluded from the
summit.
   The three Baltic foreign ministers protested Tuesday at the
Soviet move and urged participants to help them gain a ``full and
complete'' role in the conference.
   Also unhappy was the delegation from Albania, limited to
observer status because of its isolationist policies and lack of
political reform. The delegation said in a statement that the
reasons for its exclusion were ``incomprehensible.''

<HEAD>Florida Legislature Passes Ethics Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CURT ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not one member of the Legislature voted
against an ethics measure than bars more than 32,000 state and
local officials from taking gifts over $100 from lobbyists.
   ``I don't think there's another legislature in the nation that's
gone as far as we've gone,'' said House Speaker T.K. Wetherell, a
Democrat.
   The bill, an effort to restore public confidence eroded by a
criminal investigation into government ethics, passed the House
119-0 and the Senate 39-0 on Tuesday. Gov. Bob Martinez is expected
to sign it into law.
   The bill would prohibit gifts over $100 from lobbyists and
political action committees to more than 32,000 public officials,
including legislators.
   Among the exceptions: Lobbyists can pay for food and drink of
any price if it's consumed at a single sitting.
   The measure would impose a fine of up to $5,000 and a two-year
lobbying ban on lobbyists who violate it. Officials could be
removed from office.
   Senate Republicans had tried to amend the bill to prohibit gifts
no matter the value.
   ``Under this bill, (a lobbyist) couldn't give you a $400 set of
golf clubs,'' said Sen. Richard Langley. ``But he could give it to
you one club at a time.''
   But Democrat Tom Brown, the measure's chief Senate sponsor, said
$100 was a reasonable amount that could be changed by the
Legislature in the future.
   ``This is one we needed to get behind us,'' Brown said.
   The bill was inspired by an investigation into legislators'
acceptance of trips to hunting lodges, ski resorts and foreign
countries from lobbyists, and lawmakers' failure to report the
gifts as the law now requires.
   A prosecutor has subpoenaed records from dozens of lobbyists as
part of the probe.
   Government entities - such as state commissions, school boards
and city councils - could give officials gifts, but universities
and colleges could not. That would end such perks as football
weekends for legislators.
   Also out would be the annual legislative family day at Disney
World.
   Bill Jones of the good-government group Common Cause said the
bill is a good first step but that the need for campaign finance
reform is much greater.

<TEXT>
   A previously unknown millionaire emigre
who has suddenly become a contender in Poland's presidential race
jumped ahead of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki in the polls
today, trailing only Lech Walesa.
   The latest survey by the government polling service showed
42-year-old businessman Sanislaw Tyminski was backed by 20 percent
of respondents.
   Walesa, the Solidarity chairman, was favored by 27 percent,
Mazowiecki 17 percent, and the remaining three candidates shared a
total of 12 percent. Twenty-four percent were undecided or did not
plan to vote.
   If no candidate wins more than 50 percent in Sunday's election,
the top two vote-getters will compete in a Dec. 9 runoff.
   However, the poll was conducted over the weekend - before
Tyminski charged that Mazowiecki had betrayed the nation by
creating economic chaos and found himself the subject of a
government slander investigation.
   Tyminski's allegation was based in part on figures he
misinterpreted and prompted journalists to take the first hard look
at his international business dealings, his Canadian and Peruvian
nationality and his absence from Poland for the last 21 years.
   The pro-Mazowiecki newspaper lamented Tyminski's meteoric rise
in a front-page commentary today: ``Poland used to be the
conscience of Europe and now we have a chance to become the
laughing stock of the world.''
   Under the headline ``A Liar or a Fool,'' the newspaper on
Tuesday said Tyminski appeared ``unbalanced.''
   Tyminski describes himself as a self-made millionaire who left
Poland penniless at age 21 and made fortunes in Canada and the
Amazon port of Iquitos, Peru. According to his campaign, he runs
Transduction Ltd., a Toronto computer automation company, and leads
Canada's tiny, conservative Libertarian Party.
   Although unknown in Poland or in emigre circles, Tyminski was
given free television and radio time by newly democratic Poland's
evenhanded election law, and a press making every effort to be fair
covered him just as it treated Walesa, Mazowiecki or the other
three candidates.
   However, because he initially was given no chance of winning, he
was generally treated as a curiosity and not subjected to hard
criticism until his surge in the polls.
   He appealed to Poles disenchanted by the painful market-oriented
reform promulgated by Mazowiecki and endorsed by Walesa, who saw
his support drop from 35 percent in a poll released Friday.
   ``The anti-inflationary plan threatens to bring civil war,''
Tyminski told audiences struggling with high prices, unemployment
and uncertainty. ``The country has been engulfed by recession; we
have neither a government nor a Parliament.''
   A columnist in the Zycie Warszawy newspaper said one sociologist
described Tyminski's appeal as an easy way for Poles to resolve
their problem of choosing between Walesa and Mazowiecki.
   ``If I have a conflict hanging over me, I will gladly go out for
a vodka,'' the commentator said. ``It is this vodka that (Tyminski)
the only independent candidate represents.''
   However, he wrote, when Tyminski made charges amounting to
treason against Mazowiecki, a veteran Solidarity activist and the
first non-Communist prime minister in the East bloc, ``the vodka
got spilled.''
   Gazeta Wyborcza, referring to the investigation of Tyminski for
slander, said that a person can be imprisoned for from six months
to eight years if convicted of ``publicly offending and humiliating
the Polish nation.''
   The poll released today was conducted Saturday and Sunday and
surveyed 1,490 people in person, the government polling service
said. The margin of error was 2 percent.

   The estranged wife of a man accused of sending
mail bombs that killed a lawyer and a judge has pleaded guilty in
an unrelated case and is cooperating with prosecutors trying to
convict her husband, a newspaper says.
   Federal agents are questioning Susan Moody, 28, about the mail
bomb case, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported today.
   Her husband, Walter Leroy Moody Jr., is charged with sending the
bombs that killed a federal judge in Alabama and a Savannah civil
rights lawyer. The bombings last year terrorized the South, and
especially black leaders.
   Mrs. Moody pleaded guilty in a witness-tampering case on Nov. 10
in an unusual Saturday session before U.S. District Judge Anthony
Alaimo, the newspaper quoted unidentified sources as saying. The
judge sealed the records of the proceeding and barred participants
from even acknowledging a hearing took place.
   The newspaper filed court papers objecting to the closing of
proceedings that are typically open. A hearing was scheduled for
Friday.
   Sandra Popson, Mrs. Moody's Macon, declined comment, as did
Howard Shapiro, a prosecutor in the case.
   The Moodys were indicted in July on charges of threatening two
women who had been paid to provide a fake alibi for Moody during
his efforts to overturn a 1972 bomb-possession conviction. The
women were considering changing their story.
   Moody has been jailed without bail. Mrs. Moody, who has filed
for divorce, is free.

<HEAD>More Snow Falls in the West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow today helped ensure a white Thanksgiving for more of the
West after storms left more than 2 feet in Utah's canyons and up to
18 inches in Yellowstone National Park.
   The early-season snow had two predictable effects: It made
traveling difficult but ski area operators happy.
   ``The storm was far from being a turkey,'' joked William Alder,
a National Weather Service meteorologist. ``This is just perfect
for the resorts.''
   Utah's Big and Little Cottonwood canyons got more than 2 feet of
snow. Solitude ski resort decided to open two lifts today and open
more terrain Thursday. Snowbird also will open on Thanksgiving.
   The fast-moving storm caused traffic problems, but no serious
accidents were reported. High winds - gusts to 80 mph were recorded
near Wolf Creek, Colo., and to 62 mph between Cheyenne and Laramie,
Wyo. - blew the snow and hampered visibility.
   Snow fell this morning in Boise, Idaho, and heavy snow was
possible in the mountains of Washington and Oregon.
   The mountains of eastern Idaho generally got 1 to 3 inches, and
to 18 inches fell in Yellowstone.
   Light accumulations were expected in the mountains of Northern
California.
   Where it wasn't snowing, light rain was scattered throughout
much of the West, as well as parts of the Midwest, Texas, Oklahoma
and Kansas.
   The East and Southeast generally were fair with seasonable
temperatures today.
   The high temperature for the nation Tuesday was 90 degrees at
McAllen, Texas.

<TEXT>
   A dispute over how to grill a hot dog has a
Palestinian food retailer pitted against a rabbi who is Baltimore's
lone inspector of kosher meats.
   The merchant, George Barghout, still was touting his dogs as
kosher on Tuesday despite a conviction last week for violating a
city ordinance that bars merchants from claiming their products are
kosher when they're not.
   Rabbi Mayer Kurcfeld has spent 15 months dogging Barghout,
insisting that the kosher wieners he sells at his Yogurt Plus
eatery are rendered non-kosher because he grills them next to
non-kosher dogs.
   ``If the consumer believes he is getting kosher food, that is
what he should get,'' the rabbi said.
   Jewish dietary laws forbid the commingling of kosher and
non-kosher foods. Barghout says the cooking does not deprive the
hot dogs of their kosher qualities. ``The flame doesn't contaminate
the meat; it purifies it,'' he said.
   ``It doesn't make any difference what he thinks,'' Kurcfeld
replied.
   Barghout came to the United States 31 years ago and says he is
devoted to the cause of a Palestinian homeland. He owns five
Baltimore food stores.
   Kurcfeld is an Orthodox Jew born in Israel.
   He takes his job with Baltimore's Bureau of Kosher Meat and Food
Control so seriously that he refuses to reveal the days he travels
to Philadelphia for a second job as a kosher slaughterer.
   ``If people knew when I was out of town, who knows what they
might do?'' he asks.
   ``Am I in a Zionist state or am I in America?'' said Barghout.
``This is a Zionist place, I tell you, a goddamn Zionist place.''
   The conviction cst Barghout $500 in fines plus court costs.

<TEXT>
   A manuscript of Mozart's ``Fantasia and Sonata in
C Minor'' sold today at auction for $1.57 million, tying a record
for a music manuscript, Sotheby's said.
   The manuscript, which contained previously unknown
embellishments by the composer, was part of a group of manuscripts
offered by the Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary of
Philadelphia.
   The bid by Otto Haas, a London dealership, tied the record for
such a manuscript set a year ago, when Sotheby's got the same price
for a piano concerto by Robert Schumann.
   Haas paid an additional buyer's premium of 10 percent.
   The manuscripts were discovered in a safe at the school in July.
They had been donated in 1950 by Marguerite Treat Doane, whose
father had been a prominent collector.
   Sotheby's said the manuscript apparently had been among a
collection sold by Mozart's wife, Constanze, in 1799, eight years
after the composer's death.
   William Howard Doane of Cincinnati, Ohio, an industrialist and
hymn writer, acquired the manuscript in 1889.
   The fantasia and sonata are customarily played together.

   Time hasn't faded 77-year-old Harold Williams'
memory of leaving New York City along with other orphans on a train
taking them to new homes in the Midwest.
   ``I remember standing on the platform and then going into the
train and sitting down with my teddy bear in my lap,'' he said
Tuesday. ``I recall looking out the window and seeing all the
people and the buildings.''
   Many orphaned or abandoned children benefited from the Orphan
Train Movement, which lasted from 1854 to 1929. Others merely had
their suffering relocated.
   Their tales, good and bad, were told at an Orphan Train reunion
attended by about two dozen people who took part in the unusual
social experiment that sent more than 100,000 children to foster
homes far from the big city.
   ``In 1929, me and my twin brother were put on the last orphan
train out to Kansas,'' said Alan Bankston, 64, of Dayton, Ohio.
   ``We wound up with adoptive parents,'' he said. ``They gave us
everything we needed, except love. And love is what we needed the
most.''
   Bankston wept during part of his talk. He said although he and
his wife had six children, they took in two foster children
``because I knew how important it was to have someone love you.''
   The Orphan Train came at a time when New York City was inundated
by European immigrants who crowded tenements on the Lower East
Side. Poverty and disease were rampant. Many children were orphaned
or left to fend for themselves on the streets.
   Arthur Smith, 72, of Trenton, N.J., was only 49 days old when a
well-dressed woman left him in a wicker basket in Gimbel's
department store. When he was 4, he boarded a train for a new life
on an Iowa farm.
   Smith said he was lucky to be taken in by a loving family, but
he admitted the mystery of the woman who left him behind haunted
him.
   ``Then I sort of put it aside,'' he said. ``I decided it was a
door I wasn't meant to open. I don't feel bad about my mother. I
assume she was in circumstances beyond her control.''
   Williams, of Magalia, Calif., said he is still angry at his
mother. ``I was a cute little baby, only 16 days old,'' he said.
``How could she dump me?''
   He said he spent most of his childhood with ``an old lady who
was a tyrant and her five daughters.''
   ``I was scared to death of her,'' Williams said. ``If I became
sick, I got beaten. She had this theory that if you got sick, you'd
done something bad.''
   Williams left that home at 17, after years of being ``abused
mentally, physically and sexually.''
   He became a homeless alcoholic but pulled his life together with
the help of a job at a dairy plant. He later became plant manager
and got married.
   Seventy-one-year-old Winifred Williams, no relation, of Temple
Hills, Md., looked at her husband, Lawrence, while she spoke to the
group.
   ``To be an orphan means to survive,'' she said. ``You don't have
a parent or a mother to love you. You tell yourself you will
survive until you find someone who will love you. I felt that way
when I met my husband. He made up for all the love I didn't have as
a child.''
   Alice Ayler, 71, of Oklahoma City, survived a nightmarish
childhood in a series of foster homes where she was abused. She
became a psychologist and has been married for 51 years.
   The reunion, she said, completed the journey begun so many years
ago.
   ``We're all a big old family,'' she said, looking around the
crowd. ``Not by blood, by something bigger.''

<HEAD>Government Panel Slams Republics' Refusal To Lift Prices On Luxury
Goods</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Black market dollar prices in 3rd graf cq</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The national government berated the Russian and
Kazakhstan republics today for refusing to obey a decree to lift
price controls on jewelry, American cigarettes and other luxury
goods.
   The State Prices Committee said the move to free market prices
for non-essential luxury items was inevitable, and that their
prices should rise. The Communist Party newspaper Pravda quoted the
committee as saying the defiant republics' refusal to obey the
order was illegal.
   Prices of many luxury items have been fixed by the state, but
many are regularly sold for much more than the official price by
corrupt salesclerks and even the factory workers who produce the
goods and the truck drivers who deliver them.
   Women's shoes now cost $439 on average on the black market, a
pack of 20 cigarettes costs $9 and a color television set $3,638 -
all three to six times higher than state prices, a newspaper report
said today.
   The Council of Ministers, or Soviet Cabinet, announced last week
it was lifting price controls on select items to encourage
production of consumer goods.
   The order affected sales of furs, carpets, high-tech
electronics, cut glassware, china, car parts, caviar and imported
whiskey and gin.
   Within hours of the surprise announcement, the Russian republic
refused to enact it and temporarily forbade the sale of the
affected goods on Russian territory. The Central Asian republic of
Kazakhstan also nullified the decree within its borders, and
Azerbaijan said today it would temporarily ignore it while studying
its impact.
   Floating prices are an important element of the government's
plan to move to a market economy from central planning, in which
the government sets all prices regardless of the cost of
production.
   The Supreme Soviet, or national parliament, adopted a plan for
gradually freeing prices last month, but has run into resistance
from some republics, notably Russia, which has adopted its own
plan.
   The Rabochaya Tribuna (Workers Tribune) newspaper today quoted
the Russian Federation Statistics Committee as saying the black
market prices of some consumer goods in the republic exceeded state
prices by 100 to 200 percent or more.
   It said the average black market price for beef or pork was
$16.20 and for a small jar of caviar, $37.80, both four times the
state prce.
   In Moscow, a can of caviar fetches $63 dollars on the black
market, or seven times the state price, the newspaper said.
   ``The price of $45 dollars for a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of
chocolate candies exceeds the state price seven times over,'' it
said. ``A bottle of wine is sold for $18, while the average
official price is $6.30.''
   The State Prices Committee rejected criticism that the freeing
of prices would play into the hands of black marketeers.
   Pravda said as long as prices remain artificially low,
``jewelry, caviar and other goods in short supply are being bought
up on a large scale for personal gain, not only by Soviet citizens
but also - and this is particularly alarming - by foreigners.''

   A liberal lawmaker challenging a proposal to
regulate suggestive advertising evoked a provocative Biblical
passage while ultra-Orthodox Parliament members shouted and covered
their ears in protest.
   Arieh Eliyav of the left-leaning Labor Party said he read the
passionate sections from the Songs of Songs in the Old Testament to
show that indecency is not easily defined.
   But after seven hours of debate Tuesday, legislators voted 42-38
to give the first of three approvals needed to adopt a law banning
use of nude or scantily clad women in advertising.
   The law is among religious legislation the ultra-Orthodox Agudat
Israel Party demanded last week when it joined Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's ruling coalition.
   The proposed laws have incensed many secular Israelis who accuse
the ultra-Orthodox minority of religious coercion. About 70 percent
of Israeli Jews do not observe strict religious practices.
   At the beginning of the session, the debate was more academic
than erotic, with lawmakers discussing whether clothed or nake
women were more arousing.
   Then came Eliyav quoting from the Song of Songs, also known as
the Song of Solomon:
   ``Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle that
feeds among the lilies ... How delightful is your love, my sister,
my bride, how much more pleasing is your love than wine, and the
fragrance of your perfume than any spice,'' he quoted.
   Rabbi Avraham Ravitz of the ultra-Orthodox Torah Flag Party
leaped to his feet.
   ``He (Eliyav) is bringing damnation upon the people of Israel,''
he shouted. ``This could only happen in the Israeli Parliament,
using the Bible for political purposes. It's a shame.''
   Agudat Israel legislator Rabbi Moshe Feldman covered his ears.
   Eliyav continued unperturbed: ``Your belly is a heap of wheat
encircled with lilies ...''
   After Eliyav stopped reading, three legislators urged him to
leave.
   ``I won't let the Rabbi Ravitz teach me about loving the Bible
... Throughout the years, hundreds of millions of people throughout
the world loved these words, word for word ... and we gave them to
the world,'' he told the daily Yediot Ahronot newspaper.

   The city made it over the 1 million census hump,
although it took a recount to do it, and officials say retaining
their big city status gives them something to crow about.
   ``I guess I can say `I told you so,''' Mayor Coleman Young said
Tuesday. He led a massive ``Detroit, Were You Counted?'' campaign
to round up at least 30,000 uncounted residents after the first
count showed 970,000 people.
   Final figures still aren't in, but Census Bureau Director
Barbara Bryant told Young the city topped 1 million. The recent
tally included such people as military personnel stationed
elsewhere during the first count, Bryant said.
   Falling below 1 million would mean a loss of state and federal
dollars. Officials estimated it would cost Detroit about 16 percent
of its annual operating revenue of $1.9 billion.
   ``Hooray, hooray, hooray,'' Rep. John Conyers said from his
office in Washington. ``The powers that be finally got the message
that the oppressed, the homeless and the impoverished don't always
have phones and houses from which to be recorded.''

<TEXT>
   Diplomats under siege at the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait
have found a new source of water and may be able to hold out until
some time in December, President Bush said today.
   Bush said the water source was being purified for drinking, but
he did not elaborate. Until now, the diplomats drank purified
swimming pool water and bottled liquids.
   Iraq cut off water and electricity to all embassies in Kuwait in
late August, ordering them to shut down. All diplomats have left
except for eight Americans, two Britons and some Arab
representatives.
   The diplomats have been living off canned food supplies and
fresh dates, and were not expected to hold out beyond November.
   ``In terms of how long the people can last, I don't know the
answer to that,'' Bush told reporters at the U.S. ambassador's
residence following an international summit. ``It has been pushed
back to something in December,'' he added, before departing for a
visit to Saudi Arabia and Egypt.
   The 10th anti-Iraq resolution adopted earlier this month by the
U.N. Security Council calls for the Secretary General to find ways
to resupply the beleaguered embassies. But he has yet to announce
how he plans to do so.
   In late October, Secretary of State James Baker announced the
diplomats had dug a shallow well in the compound. He said they were
using the water to tend a vegetable garden and to thumb their nose
at the Iraqi troops ringing the compound by washing the embassy
cars.
   The U.S. compound shelters Ambassador W. Nathaniel Howe, a staff
of seven and 19 American citizens who have taken refuge there.
   ``There is an attempt by Saddam Hussein to starve them out,''
Bush said.

   A construction site cave-in four blocks from
the White House was stabilized early today as utility crews worked
to restore telephone and electrical services.
   A 100-foot-long section of sidewalk and part of a downtown
street slid into the 4-story-deep hole Tuesday as workers tried to
shore up the construction site from the initial collapse Monday
night. No injuries were reported.
   Workers at United Press International were allowed back in their
headquarters today, but telephone company spokesman Michel Daley
said full service would not be restored until later in the day. The
news agency abandoned its headquarters adjacent to the scene of the
collapse Monday night, but the news service continued to operate
with help from a rival agency, Reuters, and from National Public
Radio.
   Even though the site was stabilized, more dirt will be dumped,
according to Vincent Ford, District of Columbia chief building
inspector. Ford said he did not expect any further ground movement.
   Daley said Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Co. crews were
working to repair a cable that was severed in the collapse. About
70 percent of the circuits were expected to be restored by early
afternoon, Daley said.
   ``We're literally running cables through windows to get services
restored on a temporary basis,'' Daley said.
   If the cave-in spreads any further, it could cut electric lines
supplying power to surrounding office buildings, said Bill Gausman,
construction manager for the Potomac Electric Power Co. The utility
urged customers to curtail power usage.
   The area around the half-block-square construction project is
being blocked off to traffic while crews dump dirt into the site.
   Workers ``are going to be at it for days,'' said Charles Culver,
director of construction and engineering for the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration, which is investigating the
accident. Schal Mid-Atlantic Inc. had planned an office building at
the location.
   UPI will operate from temporary quarters until at least
Thanksgiving, according to spokesman Milt Capps.
   ``We urgently need our telephone service restored if we are
going to deliver quality service over the holiday period,'' Capps
said. He described morale as ``grim'' but added there was also a
``foxhole camaraderie'' among employees.
   UPI staff members who are members of the Wire Service Guild
voted last Friday to accept a 90-day, 35 percent pay cut the
company said was needed to stave off financial insolvency and make
it mre attractive to potential buyers. Management employees took
the same cut earlier.
   Capps said Reuters was helping UPI distribute photographs to its
clients and that National Public Radio was helping maintain its
broadcast and audio network services. UPI was operating out of
several locations, including the Senate press gallery at the
Capitol.
   ``We're prepared to continue operations over here
indefinitely,'' UPI's executive editor, Al Rossiter Jr., said from
a company facility in a Virginia suburb.
   UPI was unable to serve many Washington-area clients, mainly
federal agencies. The news service delivers stories to those
customers over telephone lines that were cut in the cave-in, said
Washington bureau chief Berl Schwartz.

   More than 200 freed Iranian prisoners of war
arrived home from Iraq today in the first prisoner exchange by the
two countries in two months, the official media reported.
   The Islamic Repubic News Agency said the freed men kissed the
ground on arrival, crying for joy and chanting ``Allahu Akbar!'' or
God is great.
   Tehran radio said the 238 former POWs arrived at the capital's
Mehrabad Airport and were warmly greeted by military and political
figures.
   Some 79 Iraqis taken prisoner during the eight-year Iran-Iraq
war were also sent home by air in the first prisoner exchange in
two months, the official Islamic News agency said.
   The agency said the Iraqis had been convicted of crimes but were
later pardoned by Iran. It did not specify the nature of the
crimes.
   Another 200 Iraqis were scheduled to be repatriated Thursday.
   The exchanges started in mid-August after Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein abruptly agreed to all Iran's conditions for a formal peace
treaty, including the exchange of prisoners.
   He was apparently seeking peace on his eastern border while
trying to consolidate his hold over Kuwait. Iran has strongly
condemned the Aug. 2 invasion of the emirate.
   Iraq suspended the prisoner exchanges without explanation on
Sept. 20, after 37,000 men had been exchanged. The International
Committee of the Red Cross said 25,000 men still remain interned,
without giving a breakdown.
   But a visit by Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati to
Baghdad last week, the highest official from Iran to visit Iraq
since the 1979 Islamic revolution, got the exchanges going again.
   Iraq said earlier that all the prisoners to be released today
were convicted of crimes such as murder and assault after they were
interned in camps during the 1980-1988 war.
   IRNA, in its report, said: ``A freed POW, while weeping
bitterly, said a great grief breaking their hearts was the passing
away of Imam Khomeini.''
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the personification of Iran's 1979
Islamic revolution, died in June 1989, almost a year after a
cease-fire in the Gulf War.

   It's still neck and neck - and neck and
neck and neck - in what was a four-way tie for one seat on the
newly created Franklin County Charter Commission.
   Now there's a fifth person in the tie for the District 3 seat.
Each got one write-in vote on the Nov. 6 ballot, which listed no
candidate for the post.
   The ballot boxes, which had been sealed since the election, were
opened Tuesday by county officials hoping to resolve the tie.
Instead they turned up the fifth write-in.
   ``We've never had this happen before,'' said Gladys Hanley,
chairwoman of the county Board of Registrars. ``We don't know what
to do.''
   The board plans to ask state election officials what to do.
   To further complicate things, one of the candidates already has
been elected to the Charter Commission as an at-large delegate and
another is tied with two other candidates for another at-large
seat.

<NOTE>EDS: CORRECTS 5th graf bgng, `Among the,' to identify Kamal Charif
as a former employee of Lebanese parliament, not former state
senator</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal drug agents lured reputed Lebanese
heroin producers and traffickers to the United States with the
promise of payment for previous drug shipments in order to arrest
the ring's leaders, a prosecutor says.
   ``We were able to arrange for all of the key players to be
present in the United States during a two-week period,'' said Henry
E. Hudson, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.
   ``They came here to collect money for previous transactions,''
he said Tuesday, adding, ``We're talking several hundred thousand
dollars.''
   The results were the arrests of 22 people in five states and the
District of Columbia, including nine people who normally reside in
Lebanon but were enticed to the Washington area, officials said.
   Among the Lebanese residents arrested were Kamal Charif,
identified by officials as a former employee of the Lebanese
parliament, and his son, Wadgy Charif.
   Wadgy Charif told undercover Drug Enforcement Administration
agent Hollis Williams and a DEA informant on Aug. 2, 1989 that his
father ``owned and operated one of the largest heroin processing
facilities in the Bekaa Valley, and could supply ... Williams with
large quantities of heroin,'' Williams said in an affidavit.
   Kamal Charif came to the United States not only to pick up money
but also ``to negotiate with our agents to supply 50 kilograms (110
pounds) a month to supply what he thought was a heroin network,''
Hudson said in an interview.
   The 16-month undercover case, dubbed ``Operation Helix,'' began
with the August 1989 meeting at the Four Seasons restaurant in
Alexandria, Va., and involved purchases or arrangements to purchase
numerous multi-kilogram quantities of heroin at about $40,000
apiece, Williams' affidavit said.
   It also led to the seizure of 25 kilograms of extremely pure
heroin, Hudson said.
   ``It's possible that the arrests could have been delayed so we
could have seized more heroin, but we might have lost a couple of
the key players,'' the prosecutor said.
   ``This organization is probably one of the largest importers of
heroin on the East Coast of the United States, responsible for
supplying significant quantities into the Washington metropolitan
area as well as into New York and Detroit,'' Hudson said.
   The organization was ``responsible for the importation of
hundreds of kilograms of relatively pure southwest Asian heroin
into the United States, Europe and Canada,'' a Justice Department
statement said.
   Of the 22 people arrested, 18 were charged with conspiracy to
distribute heroin, a charge that carries a possible sentence of
life without parole, as well as immigration violations. The other
four are charged only with immigration violations.
   Fifteen of the 22 were seized in Washington, D.C., or northern
Virginia; three in Detroit; two in New Jersey and one each in
Toledo, Ohio; and Miami.
   The investigation is expected to lead to nine more arrests,
including one in Germany, said an official familiar with the case.
   The heroin came from the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley. The
newfound cooperation between the United States and Syria due to
their alliance against Iraq has not extended to drug control
efforts, according to the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``The Syrians aren't helping us,'' the official said. ``If
anything, they are hindering us.''
   The State Department's International Narcotics Control Strategy
Report, issued last March, said, ``We believe that Syria tolerates
and profits from the drug production and trafficking in the areas
over which it exercises control.''
   This view was supported by one of the people arrested, Michel
Rebeiz, who told DEA agent Williams that ``the Syrian police were
now running the airport and asking $10,000 per kilogram to allow
heroin through the checkpoints,'' according to Williams' affidavit.
   The State Department report said Lebanese production of opium -
the raw ingredient for heroin - increased significantly last year
to as much as 45 metric tons. During that year, the U.S. officials
believe Lebanon produced as much as 6.5 metric tons of heroin, with
4.5 metric tons coming from locally grown opium and the rest from
opiates imported from Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
   The heroin involved in ``Operation Helix'' was shipped through
Cyprus, Western Europe and then to the United States, said DEA
spokesman Cornelius Dougherty.

<TEXT>
   TUCSON, Ariz. AP) - One Arizona county's employees will get a
paid day off in January in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. despite
voters' rejection of a state holiday honoring the civil rights
leader.
   The Pima County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday unanimously
voted to give county employees eight hours of paid administrative
leave to be taken on either the third Monday of January or the
Friday before it.
   Supervisor Raul Grijalva said he hopes the Maricopa County Board
of Supervisors in Phoenix will follow his board's example so ``that
will push the Legislature to either do something themselves, or put
it back on the ballot for voters to decide.''
   Voters in the state's general election on Nov. 6 rejected two
propositions that would have created a paid state holiday honoring
King. A majority of Pima County voters supported creating a King
holiday.
   The county includes the city of Tucson, which has a King Day.

   President Bush and Syrian leader Hafez Assad are
expected Friday in Geneva for an apparent meeting, airport sources
said today.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they had
no further details on the visit by the two presidents to the Swiss
city.
   Bush would be on his way back from a Thanksgiving visit to U.S.
troops in Saudi Arabia - the first by an American president to
front-line forces since Richard Nixon in 1969.
   Syrian troops are part of the 350,000-strong multinational force
massed against Iraq in the Persian Gulf since Iraq invaded Kuwait
on Aug. 2.
   The U.S. and Syrian diplomatic missions to the United Nations in
Geneva had no immediate comment.
   Washington's relations with Damascus, strained for many years
over Syria's support for international terrorism and its hard-line
positions against Israel, have warmed since the Syrians joined the
anti-Iraq coalition.

<HEAD>Latest Developments in the Gulf Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a brief look at the latest developments in the Persian
Gulf:
   ---
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev says the U.N. Security Council should meet
to address a ``very dangerous'' situation in the Persian Gulf ``and
take a decision there.'' Speaking after a meeting with Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, Gorbachev said: ``We can't just
leave things this way without giving them closer analysis.'' The
Soviet leader did not elaborate on what any U.N. Security Council
meeting might discuss, or what any solution might involve.
   ---
   Iraq, meanwhile, promised to free 157 more Europeans it is
holding, Western officials said. Hostages to be released over the
next days included Britons, Italians, Germans, Irish, Dutch, Danes,
Belgians, Portuguese and Greeks. Many Western officials have said
Saddam Hussein's policy of releasing hostages gradually is designed
to break the world alliance against Iraq.
   ---
   Speaking in Paris, where he attended a European Security summit,
President Bush said he and Gorbachev see ``eye to eye'' on the gulf
crisis and any differences between them were ``very minor.'' Bush
left Paris for the Middle East, where he was to meet with Arab
officials and spend thanksgiving with U.S. troops in Dhahran, Saudi
Arabia.
   ---
   It looks like virtually all 230,000 Americans deployed in the
gulf will be eating fresh turkey with all the trimmings on
Thanksgiving Day. But just in case, the U.S. military says it has
600,000 prepackaged turkey dinners stashed in a warehouse.
   ---
   Airport sources in Geneva said Bush and Syrian leader Hafez
Assad were expected Friday in Geneva for a meeting. The sources,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they had no further
details on the visit by the two presidents to the Swiss city.
Syrian troops are part of the 350,000-strong multinational force

<HEAD>`Shogun, The Musical' Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS other critics at end.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Shogun, The Musical'' certainly has the
spectacle. What it needs is a coherent story, a few good songs and
a couple of characters you could care about.
   All are missing from this big, beached whale of a show that
floated belly up into Broadway's Marquis Theater on Tuesday night.
The premiere was postponed several days after the leading man,
Philip Casnoff, was bonked by a piece of falling scenery during a
preview performance Nov. 13.
   It's amazing Casnoff wasn't hurt before. The show opens with a
shipwreck - a rather nifty maritime catastrophe done with an
honest-to-goodness ship, laser beams and some black-clad sea
sprites pulling billowing sheets of cloth. The musical also has an
earthquake and several big battle scenes, including one striking
chorus line of warriors on horseback. They are not enough.
   Although ``Shogun'' has the technical expertise of recent big
British musical blockbusters, it doesn't have the emotional sweep
of ``Les Miserables'' or the sense of romance and fun found in
``The Phantom of the Opera.'' Director Michael Smuin has mastered
the wizardry of modern stage technology but he can't do much with a
baffling narrative and pedestrian music and lyrics.
   The musical is based on James Clavell's mammoth novel of
17th-century Japan. The book is so detailed and complicated - the
paperback version runs more than 1,200 pages - that any adaptation
is bound to be more outline than story. Even so, the producers have
included a two-page plot synopsis and a glossary of Japanese
phrases that still don't make the tale completely accessible.
   ``Shogun'' concerns an Englishman, John Blackthorne, shipwrecked
on the Japanese coast. He gets involved with several warlords, a
conniving Portuguese Jesuit and, most significantly, the lovely
Lady Mariko, who happens to be married to a nobleman. You know
there will be trouble.
   ``Shogun'' takes itself very seriously. The characters don't
talk. They proclaim. When they are not proclaiming, they are
explaining the plot. Adapter John Driver uses several of the main
characters to summarize what is going on. It's like listening to
Cliffs Notes read out loud.
   When they are not explaining, the performers are singing
composer Paul Chihara's wallpaper-thin music, melodies that linger
no longer than the time it takes to sing them. The music and
lyrics, which are by Driver, often seem unnecessary, stopping the
plot rather than advancing it and, more important, in the love
songs, failing to forge the bond between Blackthorne and Mariko.
Instead, these love songs are so generic - particularly an often
repeated number called ``Born to Be Together'' - that they probably
could be dropped into any musical and work OK.
   The cast doesn't let the weak material stop them. Casnoff is
personable, a handsome leading man who sings with authority and
even seems to have a sense of humor. June Angela as the doomed
Mariko is striking, a lovely singer who throws herself into the
show with even more conviction.
   The rotund Francis Ruivivar, as the good warlord, is stuck with
a character who alternates between buffoon and nobleman. He also
has one of the show's more pointless songs, ``Rum Below,'' in which
Blackthorne teaches the would-be shogun to dance a jig. But the
show's campiest moment occurs early in the second act when the
geishas sing about Oriental sexual toys. Truly embarrassing.
   The costumes by Patricia Zipprodt are extraordinary, an endless
display of patterned silks and brocades as well as a parade of
armor for scores of warriors. No one seems to wear the same outfit
twice. Loren Sherman's settings are equally lavish, particularly
the richly decorated, dark-hued Osaka Castle, lair of the evil Lord
Ishido. The lighting by Natasha Katz beautifully shows off the
settings and the costumes.
   But these design achievements can't really mask the thinness of
what we're seeing and hearing on stage. ``Shogun, The Musical'' can
occasionally dazzle the eye but it never touches the heart and
mind.
   What other critics said:
   Frank Rich in The New York Times said Casnoff's accident with
the scenery may have been ``the biggest break of his career''
because his performance after his recovery ``had the swaggering
self-assurance of a star in complete command of a vast
production.''
   Clive Barnes in the New York Post said the show ``is as
unremittingly serious as triviality can ever hope to be. ... The
book is unwieldy and the lyrics banal,'' he said.
   Linda Winer in Newsday said: ``'Shogun' is drivel, but it's not
inept drivel. Without Cameron Mackintosh and his pre-sold
international marketing machine behind it, however, the show will
need all the karma it can get.''

   The government has agreed to free at least
157 more Europeans stranded in Iraq and occupied Kuwait, Western
officials said today. The announcement came a day after Iraq's
Parliament voted to free all Germans.
   The Bush administration, seeking global support for a U.N.
resolution to wage war on Iraq, has called the Baghdad government's
piecemeal releases of hostages an attempt to divide the coalition
arrayed against Saddam Hussein.
   There is general agreement among coalition members that the
U.N.-ordered embargo on trade with Iraq is far from achieving its
desired goal of forcing Saddam out of Kuwait, which his forces
seized on Aug. 2.
   Heavyweight boxing great Muhammad Ali left Amman for Baghdad
today for talks with Saddam on the gulf crisis. Ali was accompanied
by two associates and two members of the Coalition to Stop U.S.
Intervention in the Middle East.
   French right-wing politician Jean Marie Le Pen, in Baghdad since
Sunday, will take 83 European hostages to Strasbourg, seat of the
European Parliament, a member of his delegation said. Le Pen is a
member of the European Parliament, which is scheduled to discuss
the gulf crisis on Thursday.
   The delegation member, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
those leaving Thursday would be 35 Britons, 15 Italians, 15
Germans, six Irish, five Dutch, three Danes, 2 Belgians, a
Portuguese and a Greek.
   He said two others who held French passports but were not full
French citizens would fly out. He would not elaborate.
   The head of a Swiss parliamentary delegation said today that 36
hostages would leave Thursday afternoon on a Swissair charter
flight to Zurich.
   Edgar Oehler, a Christian Democrat member of Parliament, told a
news conference that those allowed to leave include 16 Swiss, four
Irish and two Britons.
   Also today, the head of personnel for foreign workers at Ibn
al-Bitar Hospital said 38 mostly Irish staff members would be
allowed to leave. The group includes 2 Britons and a Dane, said
Gerry Fitzgerald.
   It was unclear when the workers' contracts had already expired.
The Iraqi government has previously blocked some workers from
leaving even if their contracts were fulfilled.
   It was not immediately known when that group would be allowed to
leave.
   Iraq's parliament voted Tuesday night to release all the German
hostages in response to recent statements by German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl stressing the need for a peaceful solution to the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   Iraq's parliament speaker, Saadi Mahdi Saleh, said there were
124 Germans still in Iraq and Kuwait. No specific arrangements were
made for their departure. Germany says there are about 180 of its
citizens still in Iraq.
   The Germans were among the 600 people including Americans,
Britons and Japanese held at strategic sites to deter an attack by
the multinational forces gathered in the gulf to try to force Iraq
out of Kuwait.
   About 2,000 Westerners are believed hiding in Kuwait.
   Earlier this week Iraq said all foreigners would be set free
between Dec. 25 and March 25, but Information Minister Latif
Nassiyif Jassim indicated Monday that some might be allowed to
leave earlier.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, in Paris with President
Bush for a European security cummit, said Baghdad's moves to free
hostages gradually was another effort to chisel away international
solidarity against Iraq.
   ``Our answer is simply, `Sorry, it won't work,''' said Fitzwater
on Tuesday.
   The Iraqi promise to free all foreigners came after the Bush
administration announced last week that 200,000 more U.S. troops
would be sent to the region to place the 350,000-strong
multinational force on an offensive footing.

   Hindus mourning victims of a massacre by
Sikh separatists attacked a bus station today and assaulted Sikhs,
witnesses and police said.
   A four-hour curfew was imposed in some sections of Amritsar
following the violence, which injured at least two Sikhs. Some of
the Hindus were armed with swords and sticks, United News of India
reported.
   At least 11 Hindus and two Sikhs were killed in a crowded market
on Tuesday evening when masked Sikh gunmen opened fire. Four
militants, suspected to be among the assailants, were killed by
police a few hours later.
   Amritsar police chief Sanjeev Gupta said the mourners burned two
government buses when the funeral procession passed a bus station
on the way to a cremation ground. Sikh employees at the bus station
retaliated by throwing stones, said Gupta.
   The curfew was lifted after the victims of the attack were
cremated under police guard.
   Tuesday's attack in Amritsar, 250 miles northwest of New Delhi,
was the latest in a series of killings by separatists in
strife-torn Punjab state.
   Gupta was quoted by the news agency as saying the weapons
recovered from the slain radicals Tuesday matched spent bullets
found at the scene of the market shooting.
   Witnesses had said they saw at least five masked gunmen during
the attack. It was not immediately clear if only four were involved
or if one had escaped.
   At least 120 people have died since Nov. 13. Victims have
included passengers pulled out of a bus and shot, people on morning
walks and members of security forces.
   Sikhs comprise just 2 percent of India's 880 million people but
are in a majority in Punjab, a rich farming state which borders
Pakistan.
   Sikh militants have been campaigning for independence since
1982, claiming their community is discriminated against by the
Hindus, who make up 82 percent of the country's population.
   At least 2,860 people have been killed in Punjab this year in
violence blamed on the militants.

   Boris N. Yeltsin today criticized Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's plans to strengthen the executive branch of
government as illogical and hastily prepared.
   Yeltsin, president of largest Soviet republic, said Russia could
not be forced into signing Gorbachev's proposed Union Treaty, which
would redefine the relationship between the 15 republics and the
national government.
   The treaty would be signed only if Russia's ``real sovereignty''
would be assured and if issues are resolved over the ownership of
the vast republic's bounty of gold, diamonds, oil, gas and other
natural resources, said Yeltsin, Gorbachev's frequent critic and
main political rival.
   Gorbachev on Saturday proposed dumping his embattled prime
minister, Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, and revamping the executive branch to
put it entirely under presidential control. The Supreme Soviet
legislature gave the proposals initial approval, but is expected to
consider them further Friday.
   The Soviet leader made the proposals after the Supreme Soviet
urged him to resolve a building political crisis that was
paralyzing efforts at reforming the nation's economy.
   Most of the 15 Soviet republics, including Russia, have declared
some form of sovereignty, pushing for local control over their own
economies, political structures and culture. This has resulted in
political confrontations with the central government over which
directives should be carried out or ignored.
   Yeltsin, speaking to reporters at the opening of a historical
exhibition at the Russian republic's headquarters, said Gorbachev's
proposed strengthening of the national presidency seemed to be
``prepared in a hurry, probably as a result of the debates in the
Supreme Soviet, or prompted by the staff of the Supreme Soviet or
presidential aides.''
   ``But they are not exactly logical, not quite consistent, for
one thing, and for another such things should be discussed and
adopted taking into account the will of the republics,'' he said,
without elaboration.
   Yeltsin, who on Monday urged a referendum on the entire
presidential system and the government's performance, said today
that a decision on such a vote hasn't been made and he would not
predict one.
   Asked if Gorbachev's reputation or credibility are helped by the
proposal to strengthen his presidential powers, Yeltsin replied:
``It was my impression from the stormy meetings in the Ukraine,
where I spent only one day, that no, it doesn't.''
   Yeltsin was in the Ukraine earlier this week to sign a treaty on
relations between that republic and the Russian republic.

<HEAD>Energy Department Says Oil Company Profits Increased Slightly</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Profits for major oil companies increased by
less than 2 percent in the months immediately after the Persian
Gulf crisis, and most benefits from higher prices went to
oil-producing countries, the Energy Department reported today.
   A report by the Energy Information Administration said higher
crude oil prices ``led to substantial increases in income from oil
and gas production,'' but the beneficiaries often were foreign
governments.
   Income for oil-producing countries, as well as for domestic
producers, soared in the third quarter by 684 percent, compared to
the same three-month period in 1989, the report said. But for the
most part, the benefit did not pass on to many of the oil
companies, the study reported.
   ``For the major petroleum companies, increased profits from oil
and gas production were nearly offset by reduced earnings from
refining, marketing and chemical businesses,'' said the report.
   The net income for major U.S. oil companies was l.7 percent
overall, the report said. Companies that had to buy crude oil and
petroleum products at the higher prices reported profit declines,
the report said.
   Some refineries reported sharp increases in profits, however.
   The report said that the net income for independent refiners
increased 130 percent in the 3rd quarter compared to the same
period a year earlier. Profits from integrated refinery operations
at the major oil companies were mixed. Five companies reported
profit increases up to 46 percent, while six reported decreases of
up to 83 percent, the report said.
   ``Due to retail price restraint, U.S. companies who had to
purchase oil to process at higher prices, saw their income
decline,'' said the report.
   The report provided no information on specific companies.
   Its analysis covered the month of July through September. Iraq
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, leading to an embargo of Iraqi and
Kuwaiti oil and a shortfall of world oil supplies by 4.3 million
barrels, prompting prices to soar.
   Spot crude oil prices, which were about $21 a barrel before the
invasion peaked at $41 a barrel in October before declining to
about $34 a barrel in early November.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the
United States and abroad.

   Roswell (N.M.) Daily Record on the president's need to build
support before taking offensive action in the Persian Gulf:
   President Bush's decision to significantly expand American force
levels in the Persian Gulf and cancel troop rotation orders sends a
resolute signal he is ready to go to war to liberate Kuwait.
   Yet it is far from certain that, in the event of bloodshed on a
massive scale, Mr. Bush would be able to count on the sustained
backing of the American people and the rest of the world.
   Mr. Bush must clearly spell out America's aims and articulate
why the defeat of Saddam Hussein on the battlefield is vital to
U.S. interests. Otherwise, Americans may not be willing to make the
heavy sacrifices that a war almost certainly would impose.
   Much more is at stake in the Persian Gulf than low cost
gasoline. The strategic reality is that unless Saddam's aggression
is checked once and for all, the economic security of the entire
industrialized world will be in jeopardy. ...

   The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla., on the congressional role in the
Gulf crisis:
   President Bush, as commander in chief of the military, has every
right and obligation to prepare the troops for war. He acted wisely
by rapidly deploying U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia and the Persian
Gulf to contain Iraqi aggression. Containment of Saddam Hussein is
certainly in the best interest of the United States.
   The president should not, however, slowly draw the United States
into war with Iraq without first building a consensus among the
American people.
   Congress, in fact, should no let Bush do it.
   Congress has neglected its duties by putting off hearings on the
military buildup in the Middle East, the economic and human costs
of war, the strategic benefits and risks, and whether or not war is
necessary.

   Los Angeles Times on hostage family visits to Iraq:
   The somewhat ghoulish invitation of President Saddam Hussein to
``come visit Iraq,'' as it were, presents the loved ones of
hostages being held there with a difficult dilemma. It's not
surprising that some of them are reacting emotionally. It's also
not surprising that some plan to go. ...
   Clearly, the Iraqis hope to milk these visits for all the
propaganda value they are worth. Hussein seems to think the world
will see Iraq as a kinder, gentler place - and as a country with
which it is possible to do business. It probably doesn't occur to
Hussein that these visits, as well as his latest offer to free all
``guests'' by March, only remind everyone of Iraq's cruel
hostage-taking policy. ...
   It could be that the sight of loved ones in Baghdad for the
holidays will actually aid U.S. policy by starching up the
anti-Hussein coalition and reminding people of the grisly nature of
his dictatorship. ... But even if the visits have an effect close
to what Saddam Hussein probably wants, it is still right that they
be permitted to occur. In Western political philosophy, individuals
do count; the role and desires of just one person have importance.
...

   The Columbus (Ohio) Dispatch on election results:
   Committed political junkies, those who like to pick over the
bones of an election until they are absolutely clean, must have
noticed by now that the voting last week propelled a bumper crop of
women into office.
   And political strategists said the stage has been set for a
greater share of female victories in 1992.
   In the coming years, there will be an increasingly large number
of women working as lawyers, doctors, engineers and in other
professional capacities.
   No reason, then, that there shouldn't be more women politicians,
too. ...
   This year the Center for the American Woman and Politics
reported 2,063 female candidates in the field. These candidates are
expected to increase the share of state legislative offices held by
women to about 18 percent.
   Ask the average person what kind of job he or she thinks
politicians are doing and the answer might well be unprintable.
With more women in the field, maybe that will change.

   The Flint (Mich.) Journal on homelessness:
   Soon the last vestiges of Indian summer will vanish. ...
   And thus inside our homes, shut off from the snow and cold, we
will breathe in the fine aroma of well-cooked meals. ...
   There's nothing quite like home sweet home. But, sadly, for a
growing number of Americans, young and old, no such place exists.
They have no home, no fireplace, no closet, no oven - not even a
bed to call their own. For them, home is a box or a tent or a car
or an abandoned home - or for short periods, shelters. ...
   With the U.S. economy sliding ever deeper in recession, millions
more are teetering on the edge of homelessness.
   Some of these people are as ordinary as our friends or
neighbors. All they need is a good paying job and a couple of
breaks to return them to their feet. Others are people whose lives
have been torn for any of a wide variety of reasons, including
problems they inflicted upon themselves.
   Still, they are people - brothers and sisters in this special
relationship we call humanity.
   As a society, we must do a much better job of creating public,
private and charitable strategies to address this complicated
problem. ...
   But as a civilized people, as a caring people, we cannot wait
for these strategies to be implemented and succeed. We must do what
we can now as individuals to help those in need all around us.
   And so we urge you to help area shelters and food banks. Donate
what you can and volunteer your time. ...

   The Kenosha (Wis.) News on the airline industry's woes:
   One of the first economic sectors to suffer the effects of the
dawning recession is the airline industry. Thanks to Saddam
Hussein, the price of jet fuel has risen 70 percent since early
August. More than 10,000 airline employees have been laid off;
ridership is down and likely to fall further; yearly losses are
estimated at a record $1 billion. Some well-known carriers teeter
on the brink of bankruptcy.
   So in its new budget, Congress did to this essential industry
what Congress does best: It raised the industry's taxes and user
fees almost $14 billion. Congress blithely assumed that these costs
could be passed on to consumers, but the industry says competitive
pressures, combined with the general weakness of air-travel
business, make this impossible.
   Industry leaders have gone to Transportation Secretary Sam
Skinner seeking relief, perhaps by relaxing rules on foreign
investment or delaying ticket taxes. They're entitled to it - and
not in the name of some ``industrial policy,'' in which the
government manipulates the market to help favored industries. At
this critical moment, the airline industry, and the millions of
consumers who depend on it, don't need government protection; they
need protection from government.

   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on Willie Nelson:
   Willie Nelson is broke. The ``revenooers'' from Washington have
swooped down on Willie to the tune of $16.7 million they say he
owes Uncle Sam in back taxes.
   Now Willie is really a nice guy. He was the country music star
who back awhile staged those concerts that raised funds to help
struggling farmers stave off foreclosure and bankruptcies. ...
   But fortunately, he has friends. And one of them, Annetta White,
... has a solution to Willie's problem: We should all send a dollar
to ``Willie Aid'' and with those dollars, Willie, she says, could
pay off those troublesome tax men.
   Now if we all do as Annetta suggests, it's a safe bet Willie
would find his present stay in Hawaii a bit more relaxing,
   And when you millions of Americans send those dollar bills,
don't forget Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker.

   The Times of India on Japan:
   Important winds of change are blowing over Japan today. With the
accession to the throne of the new emperor, Akihito, the resurgence
of Japanese militarism, which historically has been associated with
royalist rule, has again become an issue. ...
   Mr. Kaifu favours the participation of a Japanese military
contingent in the Gulf alongside Western partners. He has been
pressured to adopt this view by the U.S. But it is clear that Tokyo
itself has fewer reservations than ever before about flexing its
long-dormant military muscle. ... Just as Emperor Akihito's
accession to what is seen as divine status is a generational change
at the apex, it may be only a short while before a new Japanese
generation, with only faint memories of World War II or the earlier
inter-war period, feels that the resurgence of Japanese militarism
is but the ``natural'' complement of its exceptional economic
might.

   The Herald of Harare, Zimbabwe, on the Gulf crisis:
   War is now inevitable in the Persian Gulf, if only because the
foreign forces have to seek justification for having been deployed
there in the first place.
   President George Bush, whose country already has the largest
single foreign force in the Gulf, has just ordered a further
build-up. ...
   Two weeks ago the Americans and the Saudis streamlined the chain
of command of their forces should war break out with Iraq. Many saw
this as one more step in the direction of armed confrontation.
   The American administration is under severe pressure at home to
do something now before the all too familiar campaign to ``bring
our boys back home'' gains momentum.
   Mr. Bush, smarting from a midterm election disaster, now has the
time to devote his energy to the Gulf crisis. But he and President
Saddam Hussein, more than anybody else, have burned their bridges
in a diplomatic game whose end result has all the potential for a
devastating conflict.

   El Pais of Madrid on the first anniversary of the murder of
Jesuit priests in El Salvador:
   ... The military chiefs who planned and ordered the action don't
even appear as suspects. The judge handling the case has been and
remains incapable of sitting all those responsible in the dock.
   The blame lies with, among others, the government of the extreme
rightist President Alfredo Cristiani which, far from fulfilling its
promise to solve the crime, has dragged its feet and even put
stumbling blocks in the way of the judicial investigation.
   The scandal is of such magnitude that the government of the
United States has reduced its military aid to El Salvador by 50
percent. Other governments, like the government of Spain - less
able to impose material sanctions - have put considerable moral
pressure on the Central American nation. Without much success,
either.
   In the end, it is not so much a question of finding and
punishing those guilty of a repulsive crime as it is of a country
demonstrating that it is capable of functioning like a civilized
society that follows the rule of law. ...

   Nov. 19
   Financial Times of London on the Soviet Union:
   The Soviet crisis deepens by the day. ... Hunger, possibly
famine, is facing the Soviet Union as the snows of winter cover
fields of rotting crops. ... Oil production is falling sharply and
the problem of delivering oil and gas is compounded by
disintegrating pipelines and a chaotic transport system. ... What
we are witnessing is the accelerating collapse of political and
economic structures. This is happening in a country where the
destruction of civil society over 70 years has fatally weakened the
country's capacity to react creatively to the new freedoms suddenly
granted it. ... All that is clear at this stage is that the
transition from communism is going to be much longer, much harder
and much more expensive than imagined over a year ago. To achieve
it peacefully could cost the West as much effort and treasure as
the cold war whose demise we celebrate in Paris this week. This is
the probable scale of the challenge ahead.

<HEAD>Afghan President Meets With Afghan Resistance in Geneva</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HANNS NEUERBOURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet-backed Afghan president said today he
met in Geneva with leaders of the U.S.-financed Afghan resistance
and the talks opened the way for restoring peace to his country
after 12 years of civil war.
   President Najibullah told reporters at U.N. headquarters in
Geneva that he had been satisfied with the talks on a possible
political solution to the Afghan conflict.
   ``A cornerstone has been laid for opening talks and dialogue and
for advancing the process as well as the implementation of the
peace process,'' Najibullah said. ``No doubt it will bear fruit.''
   Najibullah later left for the Swiss capital in Bern where he was
to meet with Swiss legislators. One deputy, Gilles Petitpierre,
said plans for an Afghanistan peace conference hosted by
Switzerland was a likely topic.
   At a news conference, Najibullah did not say when the talks took
place. He also declined to identify the Afghan resistance leaders
with whom he met, saying only they were ``prominent personalities
of the opposition side.''
   Some observers speculated that Najibullah met in Geneva with Pir
Sayed Ahmed Gailani, leader of the National Islamic Front - the
most moderate of the seven Afghan rebel groups allied against the
Communist Afghan government.
   Najibullah said conditions for a political solution were
favorable. He said his government had embarked on a democratic
course - providing for party pluralism, a free press and government
reforms.
   He said diminished tensions between the United States and the
Soviet Union also could contribute to the peace process.
   The Soviet Union sent troops to Afghanistan in 1979 to shore up
that country's gpvermment. Ten years later, the last of the Red
Army soldiers withdrew under a 1988 Geneva accord - also signed by
the United States.
   Moscow continues to send aid to Kabul. Washington supports the
the Pakistan-based guerrillas, who have kept on fighting Najibullah
but not managed to topple him.

   Two Azerbaijanis have been killed in a disputed
southern territory, triggering clashes between Soviet Interior
Ministry troops and Armenian nationalists that injured several
people, Tass said today.
   One Soviet soldier also was abducted during the clashes Tuesday
night in Nagorno-Karabakh. It began in the late afternoon and
continued for several hours, the official Soviet news agency said.
   Tass said unknown gunmen killed the Azerbaijanis near the
village of Zabukh, in Nagorno-Karabakh, but it gave no other
details.
   Twenty Soviet troops were dispatched to the scene, and
immediately came under fire fromy what Tass called ``an 80-man
group of Armenian terrorists.'' Authorities dispatched 20 more
troops as reinforcements, and a firefight continued until
nightfall, Tass said.
   ``The attackers suffered casualties. One serviceman was
abducted,'' Tass reported without elaboration.
   Armenians and Azerbaijanis have been clashing for nearly three
years over control of the predominantly Armenian region lying
within Azerbaijan.
   Armenia has demanded control, but Azerbaijan has refused,
prompting strikes, boycotts and violence that has killed a number
of people. Interior Ministry troops have been dispatched to
maintain order.

   President Bush headed to the Persian Gulf today,
saying he will tell U.S. troops they are ``not there on a mission
impossible'' and declaring the Soviets support his tough stand
against Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
   Departing a European security summit for a Thanksgiving Day
visit with U.S. forces in the Middle East, Bush said any
differences with the Soviet Union on the Persian Gulf are
``extraordinarily minor.'
   He said he and Gorbachev see ``eye to eye'' on the subject
despite the Soviet leader's reluctance to issue a public
declaration of support for a United Nations resolution authorizing
the use of force to evict Iraq's occupying forces.
   Bush was en route to Saudi Arabia when the White House announced
he would return to Europe on Friday to meet with Syrian President
Hafez Assad. The meeting in Geneva will center on the Persian Gulf.
   Relations with Syria, a hardline Arab state considered by the
State Department to be a sponsor of international terrorism, have
warmed since it joined the U.S.-led coalition against Iraq last
August.
   Bush spoke in Paris just before the Soviet leader issued a call
for an immediate meeting of the United Nations Security Council to
address a ``very dangerous'' situation in the Persian Gulf ``and
take a decision there.''
   ``We can't just leave things this way without giving them closer
analysis,'' the Soviet leader added.
   Asked if the U.N. might act this month, Bush said, ``Stay tuned.
There's certainly a chance.''
   Bush's first stop in the Middle East was in Jiddah for a meeting
with the exiled emir of Kuwait. Next was a near-midnight dinner
with Saudi King Fahd, known for his preference for late-night
meetings.
   On Thursday, Bush will fly to Dhahran on the Persian Gulf to
begin a day-long, hopscotch series of meetings - and Turkey - with
troops from the Air Force, Army, Navy and Marines. About 250,000
American troops have been sent to the gulf, and Bush has ordered an
additional 200,000 to the Middle East.
   The president had been scheduled to return to Washington
immediately after talks in Cairo on Friday with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak.
   As for his visit to Saudi Arabia, he said he planned to tell the
troops, ``We're going to prevail. We're not there on a mission
impossible.''
   Bush attended a three-day European security summit in Paris, and
spent much of his time working on Persian Gulf diplomacy. He said
efforts to win a United Nations resolution authorizing the use of
force to evict Iraq from Kuwait were ``on track.'' In addition to
Bush's personal diplomacy, Secretary of State James A. Baker III
met for several hours with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze to discuss the Persian Gulf conlfict.
   The president, who has sought a tougher international stand
against Iraq's Saddam Hussein, told reporters that ``I leave Paris
feeling that we are still together as countries who want to see
this situation reversed and want to see this man unilaterally get
out of Kuwait.''
   The president talked to reporters twice within two hours, once
during a meeting with Greek Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis
and again at the U.S. Embassy in Paris, where he spoke to
officials. Both times, he sought to minimize any differences with
the Soviets over a United Nations resolution authorizing force in
the Persian Gulf.
   ``I'm encouraged, very encouraged about this holding together of
a coalition in the sands and on the seas of the gulf,'' he said.
   Bush said he believes the United States is ``in goodsynchronization''
with other nations on how to cope with the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   Asked whether he had set a deadline for Saddam to get out of
Kuwait, he replied, ``Just watch the way all this develops.
Everybody is convinced they must get out of Kuwait with no
concessions, and that's what's emerging here.''
   Asked if he was concerned about the risks of going into a
potential combat zone, he replied, ``It really doesn't enter my
mind at all. It is not a risky mission in my view. I'd tell you if
I felt any tremors. I don't''
   Bush spent three days in Paris for the 34-nation Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe, dealing with the future of
Europe in the post-Cold War era.
   The Soviets did not rule out Bush's proposal for a U.N.
resolution, but instead counseled patience.
   Gorbachev, interviewed on French television, said, ``All
political leaders strive to avoid a military solution, but we
cannot tolerate Saddam Hussein and his regime bringing the world
community to its knees.''
   He said the U.N. Security Council ``will make an analysis of the
situation and will reach a well-considered solution.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater refused to confirm a
report that one resolution being discussed would call for automatic
military action if Saddam did not withdraw within a few months.
``There are any number of approaches that are being considered. We
will not comment on any one of them,'' he said.
   Resolutions already approved by the Security Council impose an
economic boycott on Iraq and occupied Kuwait, call for Iraq's
unconditional withdrawal and insist upon restoration of Kuwait's
previous government.
   Even before one trip was over, Bush was planning a second. The
White House said he would visit Greece and Turkey early next year.
Meanwhile, U.S. and Soviet officials unveiled plans for a
superpower summit in Moscow early next year to sign a treaty on
reducing long-range nuclear weapons.
   Fitzwater said there was no firm date for the summit, although
he said both countries were aiming for January. He said having a
nuclear arms treaty to sign was a prerequisite for the summit, but
holding the session in January ``is what we have been talking about
and shooting for.''

<TEXT>
   Border guards today killed 12 Moslem
militants after the separatists sneaked into India from Pakistan
carrying arms and ammunition, officials said.
   Five militants were captured after the encounter, the officials
said. They said 11 Soviet-designed AK-47 assault rifles, 3,200
bullets, 29 grenades and three rocket launchers were seized.
   The officials, who cannot be identified under briefing rules,
said the group of 17 Kashmiri militants was intercepted by troops
of the paramilitary Border Security Force in Kupwara, 45 miles west
of Srinagar.
   When asked to stop, the militants fired, forcing the troops to
return fire, the officials said.
   Officials regularly report similar encounters between border
guards and Moslem militants, who the government says receive arms
and military training in Pakistan to carry on their campaign for
the secession of Jammu-Kashmir state from India.
   Pakistan denies it is training Kashmiri militants but says it
morally supports the insurgency, calling it a movement for
self-determination.
   The extremists, who earlier wanted Jammu-Kashmir to unite with
Pakistan, now demand indepdence for the Moslem-majority state.
Sixtyfour percent of the state's 6 million people are Moslem.
   Nationwide, Moslems comprise 12 percent of India's 880 million
people. Hindus comprise 82 percent.
   At least 1,573 people have been killed in Kashmir since January.
Most of the victims have been militants who fell to security
forces.
   The separatist movement had been simmering since 1947 when
British-ruled India won independence and was partitioned into
Pakistan and India.
   Jammu-Kashmir, then an independent state ruled by a Hindu king,
had the option of merging with either Pakistan or India. The ruler
chose India. Pakistan, an Islamic country, says it should have got
Kashmir because of its predominantly Moslem population.

rifles today killed a South African policeman and seriously wounded
his partner in a black township outside Cape Town.
   Authorities reported five killings in separate incidents,
including a black man shot by police near Johannesburg.
   Police offered a $4,000 reward for help in capturing the killers
of the policeman, Constable Frans Van Der Merwe, who was shot in
Khayelitsha township outside Cape Town. Cartridges from assault
weapons were found at the scene, police officials said.
   They said Van Der Merwe and his partner were patrolling the area
when they came under fire before dawn. The partner, who was not
identified, was in stable condition in a Cape Town hospital.
   A wave of black-on-black violence has swept Khayelitsha. Some
residents have attacked supporters of local black officials,
accusing the officials of collaborating with the white-led South
African government. Eight blacks were killed in the township last
month.
   Garbage piled up today in the strife-torn township, where some
800 trash collectors fearing for their safety were on strike for a
fourth straight day to demand protection from authorities.
   In other violence around Cape Town, a black man was found dead
near railway tracks late Tuesday, apparently after jumping from a
train to escape assailants, a police report said.
   Police fatally shot a black man in Orkney, west of Johannesburg,
after firing on a group of blacks hurling gasoline bombs, according
to the police report, which chronicles unrest over the past 24
hours.
   Among the other fatalities were a black man found shot and
hacked to death Tuesday in the Zonkezizwe township outside
Johannesburg. Another black man was slain by unidentified
assailants in Kamashu, near Durban on the east coast, according to
the unrest report.
   A black woman died when she was hit during a brick-throwing
melee outside a police officer's residence in a township in Orange
Free State south of Johannesburg, police said. The report did not
specify when the incidents took place.
   Zonkezizwe was the scene of a weekend massacre in which 19 black
men were hacked and stabbed to death. Police said they have not
determined a motive for the slayings, but residents said the
township had been the scene of fighting between members of the
Xhosa and Zulu tribes.
   Zulus comprise the bulk of support for the Inkatha Freedom Party
and have been battling for years with Xhosas and other blacks
supporting the African National Congress led by Nelson Mandela.
Both groups oppose apartheid but differ on tactics for fighting it.

   A spate of guerrilla attacks
against the army abruptly halted today, but President Alfredo
Cristiani said the fighting could derail peace talks.
   Fighting broke out in half of El Salvador's 14 provinces on
Tuesday, beginning early in the day and leaving at least 27 people
dead and 141 wounded, officials said.
   But the country appeared to be returning to normal this morning,
despite sporadic exchanges of gunfire on the outskirts of the
northern provincial capital of Chalatenango, 30 miles north of the
capital.
   In the eastern provincial capital of Usulutan, where some of
Tuesday's heaviest fighting took place, buses were returning to the
streets and women were setting up market stalls today with no
gunfire in earshot.
   Electricity still had not returned to Usulutan, 60 miles east of
San Salvador, nor to most of eastern El Salvador.
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the rebel
organization also known as FMLN, denied it had launched an
offensive. It said the attacks aimed to prod Cristiani's government
back to the negotiating table.
   Government and rebel representatives have held five rounds of
talks since May. Negotiations were to resume Nov. 4 in Mexico but
bogged down over bitterly differing positions on the future role of
the armed forces. ``It is time to say enough to the FMLN. ... This
cannot be called military action, since most of those affected are
civilians,'' Cristiani said in a radio-TV speech late Tuesday.
``It's a new terrorist offensive.''
   ``The only thing these actions do is endanger the negotiating
process, since violence engenders violence and will not provide the
flexible and rational conditions needed to end the bloodshed,'' he
added.
   More than 73,000 people have been killed, nearly half of them
civilians, since the civil war began in October 1979. Many have
been slain by death squads linked to the military who suspected
them of leftist sympathies.
   The rebels say they are willing to demobilize and join the
political process only if the current armed forces are disbanded, a
demand the government refuses to entertain.
   Congress has slashed El Salvador's $85 million annual military
aid in half for 1991 to prod the negotiations along. It stipulated
that aid would be restored if the rebels launched an offensive, and
cut off altogether if the Cristiani government balked at further
talks.
   A rebel communique shortly after the attacks were launched said
the FMLN could launch an all-out offensive if the government does
not return to the negotiating table soon.
   FMLN's action followed the first anniversary of the army's
massacre of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her teenage
daughter on Nov. 16, 1989, during a rebel offensive in the capital.
   The guerrillas, international human rights groups and U.S.
congressional investigators say the armed forces murder and torture
political opponents and are corrupt.
   Defense Minister Col. Rene Emilio Ponce warned in a radio-TV
message Tuesday night the rebels were likely to intensify their
attacks. He said a total of 25 people were killed and 126 wounded
in the fighting.
   Ponce said 12 government soldiers were killed and 76 wounded,
and 10 guerrillas were killed and an undetermined number injured.
He said civilian casualties amounted to three dead and 50 wounded.
   A telephone survey of hospitals, first aid centers, military
officers in the field and town officials provided the casualty
figures earlier Tuesday showing that at least 27 were killed and
141 wounded.
   One military airplane and three small civilian planes were
destroyed by rebel gunfire at the main air base on the outskirts of
the capital, Ponce said.
   Guerrilla sabotage damaged electrical installations and power
lines affecting about two-thirds of this Central American nation of
more than 5.5 million people, the government electrical company
said.

   An unemployed man who went fishing to kill
time reeled in two bronze statues which had been stolen from a
recent art exhibition, the national news agency NTB reported
Wednesday.
   Algot Hansen, who fishes as a hobby, could hardly believe his
eyes when he saw a statue by Norway's prominent artist Per Ung on
the hook.
   ``I was even more surprised when I got another statue a bit
further out in the fjord,'' Hansen was quoted as saying.
   The statues were worth $17,000, according to Ung, 57, who said
they were stolen two weeks ago from an exhibition in Oslo.
   ``I never thought I would see them again,'' Ung said.

   An outbreak of meningitis has
killed 202 people within the past five months in Tanzania, a senior
health official said.
   The victims were among 2,132 people who had contracted the
disease since May, Health Minister Philemon Sarungu said Tuesday.
   Sarungu said the outbreak appeared under control but urged
health officials to send adequate stocks of medicine to hospitals
treating meningitis patients.
   The United Nations Children's Fund has donated $50,000 in
medicine for the campaign against the disease in the East African
nation, he said.
   Meningitis is a viral disease that attacks the brain and the
spinal cord. It can be fatal if not treated early.

<HEAD>Former CIA Official Says Indictments Close in Pan Am Bombing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former CIA official says the United States
is ``very close'' to getting indictments against the terrorists who
bombed Pan Am flight 103, and it also has evidence that Iran was
responsible for the disaster.
   U.S. officials investigating the December 1988 bombing over
Scotland had initially suspected that members of the Syrian-based
Palestine Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command
were responsible.
   But Vincent M. Cannistraro, who retired two months ago as chief
of operations and analysis at the CIA's Counter Terrorism Center,
said the PFLP-GC guerrillas abandoned the project at the last
minute after a police raid on their safehouses near Frankfurt.
   Cannistraro said the job was taken over by Libyan agents who
planted the highly sophisticated Semtex explosives in the forward
hold of the plane and timed them to go off soon after takeoff from
Frankfurt.
   Cannistraro said the Pan Am bombing was ordered by the
government of Iran in retaliation for the accidental downing of an
Iranian passenger jet over the Persian Gulf in July 1988 by the USS
Vincennes.
   The scheme was known by Iran's top leadership, including the
country's current president, Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   Most of the 270 people killed by the blast were Americans, and
the United States has been seeking sufficient evidence for
indictments that would stand up in a court of law.
   Cannistraro, taking the unusual step of speaking to reporters
soon after leaving the agency, said investigators had made great
progress in determining how the bomb was placed on board and by
whom. He did not elaborate.
   But, he added, the indictments won't make much difference
because the perpetrators probably are ``beyond the reach of U.S.
law.''
   CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield declined to address the substance
of Cannistraro's remarks. ``He's a retired agency officer who is
entitled to express his own opinion,'' Mansfield said.
   Cannistraro has been sharply critical of the administration as
being too timid in its handling of international terrorism. He
spoke at a luncheon sponsored by the National Strategy Information
Center Inc., a private group concerned primarily with Soviet
intelligence activities.
   Cannistraro also said there is some evidence that Iraq was
involved in the assassination last month of Egypt's parliamentary
speaker, though the attack probably was carried out by the small
Islamic Jihad movement in the country.
   He said Iraq is ``casing'' American military installations in
the Middle East as possible terrorist targets if war breaks out in
the Persian Gulf.
   ``I don't believe the Iraqis are going to unleash that
capability against the Americans at this time,'' he said. ``But
they are certainly preparing themselves, positioning themselves to
do so once the situation changes.''
   A specialist on the Middle East, Cannistraro also served as a
special assistant for intelligence at the Defense Department and as
director of intelligence programs at the National Security Council.
   He said Iraq is providing weapons, money and information to
various groups, including one headed by Palestinian radical Abul
Abbas as well as the Iraqi-backed Arab Liberation Front.
   Cannistraro said most terrorist incidents are sponsored by four
countries - Iran, Iraq, Libya and Syria. In trying to avert
bloodshed, he said, ``we are unsuccessful more than we are
successful.''

   Fear takes a seat at the nation's Thanksgiving tables on
Thursday, ushered in by rumblings of imminent war in a distant
desert.
   The fragile veneer of hope for a peaceful settlement in the
Persian Gulf has all but shattered as the conflict drags into the
holiday season, with 230,000 U.S. servicemen and women in the
region and hundreds of Americans held hostage in Iraq and occupied
Kuwait.
   At home, Americans cope with frayed nerves, growing uncertainty
and the pain of separation through protest, prayer and patriotism,
but patience is wearing thin.
   ``If Saddam Hussein will move back out of there like everybody's
been telling him to, we can maybe get back to a normal life. We've
said a prayer for that to happen,'' said Frank Atchison, a Missouri
National Guard mess sergeant whose Poplar Bluff detachment has yet
to be activated. His son, 1st Lt. Frank Darrell Atchison, leads the
1221st Transportation Company, which was called up this week along
with 15,091 other reservists from 35 states.
   ``I don't want any father's sons to be in war,'' the elder
Atchison said, keeping a firm grip on the infant car seat holding
his granddaughter, Morgan, 1 month-old on Thanksgiving. ``I'll give
thanks if we don't have a war.''
   Fear that the United States is moving too quickly toward war has
chipped away at support for President Bush's policy. Only half of
Americans surveyed recently approved of the deployment of troops to
the Middle East, down from 75 percent shortly after Saddam's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.
   The CBS News-New York Times poll found half of Americans expect
the United States to fight Iraq, and they are not happy about the
prospect.
   Protesters have marched in places like Fargo, N.D., held peace
vigils in New Haven, Conn., and Richmond, Ind., and poured oil and
simulated blood over a mound of sand in front of San Francisco's
Presidio.
   ``I think as long as the president is beating the war drums and
not wanting to have a full discussion of this in Congress, people
are getting angrier and angrier,'' said Frances Crow, a 71-year-old
Quaker among those gathered at the gates of Westover Air Force Base
in Massachusetts.
   Anger mingled with sadness and a feeling of helplessness have
overshadowed the usual joy of the season for some hostage families.
   ``I haven't even thought about Thanksgiving,'' said Kim Edwards
of Carson City, Nev., whose husband, Tony, is trapped in Baghdad.
``I should be out shopping and doing stuff, but what can you do? I
just don't have any enthusiasm for celebrating.''
   Sally Martindale's older brother, Thomas Gordon, had been
planning to stay in Kuwait during this year's holidays, teaching
English to members of that country's Air Force. In August, he
became a hostage.
   ``All along I've been thinking he'd be home for Halloween. Now
it's Thanksgiving, and a week from now, I'll probably be thinking
Christmas,'' said Martindale, of Curtis, Mich. ``It will definitely
put a damper on our holidays, but we always have that hope.''
   Some families and friends of Desert Shield soldiers are keeping
the blues at bay by honoring absent loved ones in small ways, like
the place setting at the empty seat at Darla Dick's Thanksgiving
table in Camden, N.J.
   ``My husband told me to make sure they set a plate for him and
to eat both plates,'' said Mrs. Dick, whose husband, Gregory, left
for the Gulf two weeks ago with a reserve unit. ``Of course, we're
all going to miss him, but we know his heart and soul are with us,
and that helps a lot.''
   Mothers like Marge Panny, of Green Creek, N.J., chase away fear
with routine, keeping life as normal as possible for her sons,
Eric, 8, and Michael, 5, while their father, Sgt. 1st Class Edward
Panny, is away.
   ``I don't think the reality of it has set in yet for the older
one,'' Mrs. Panny said. ``We've been telling him for so long that
Daddy's going to be away, but I don't think it's going to hit him
until Thursday.''
   For Michael, a telephone call from Saudi Arabia on Tuesday was
an early present. Tuesday was the first day of a week of free calls
home from U.S. troops, at AT&amp;T's expense.
   Michael is deaf, but he knew his father was on the other end of
the line as his mother signed ``I love you.''
   ``His face lit up like a Christmas tree,'' Mrs. Panny said. ``He
was signing away, saying `It's Daddy! It's Daddy!'''

   A year ago, Johnny Harris spent
Thanksgiving in Marine Corps boot camp. This year, he'll have
turkey with the trimmings among the flies in the gritty Saudi
Arabian desert.
   ``It's still special. We consider ourselves family in the Marine
Corps. I'll miss the football though,'' said Harris, 18, of
Chicago, a private first class in the 2nd Battalion of the 7th
Marine Regiment based in Twentynine Palms, Calif.
   Of the visit to the troops by President Bush, Harris said: ``To
see the highest person over us come here lets us know we're doing
something good. It'll be good for him to spend some time with us.''
   The troops deployed in the desert may not have all the niceties
of back home, but their hearts are tuned to the same thoughts:
family, food and football.
   The military has done everything it can to observe Thanksgiving
for the 230,000 Americans in the Persian Gulf as part of Operation
Desert Shield.
   -The Armed Forces Radio and Television Service will broadcast
Thursday's NFL game between the Detroit Lions and Denver Broncos
from the Silverdome in Pontiac, Mich.
   -U.S. Air Force units in Oman will hold a mock Macy's
Thanksgiving Day parade. Eight floats, several marching units and a
band with homemade instruments will be featured. Various units from
five Air Force commands and 23 bases will participate.
   What goes into a dinner for 230,000?
   Well, 90,000 pounds of turkey have been ordered, along with
70,000 pounds of roast beef and 45,000 pounds of baked ham. For
dessert, there are 32,000 pies, including minced meat, pumpkin,
cherry and apple, 230,000 Mars or Snickers candy bars donated by
Saudi Arabia, 12,000 pounds of nuts and 17,000 pounds of fruitcake.
   The dinner menu being prepared in the field kitchens includes
roast turkey, shrimp cocktail, gravy, roast beef or ham, bread and
corn bread dressing, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes, glazed sweet
potatoes, corn, mixed vegetables, fresh fruit, assorted pies and
egg nog.
   But the troops hunkered down on the front lines may have to
settle for tray rations, which are like prepackaged TV dinners that
are heated by immersing them in boiling water. They will feature
turkey with dressing, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes, stuffing,
vegetables, deserts, cakes, fruits and assorted drinks.
   No one will be eating turkey MREs, which is a military acronym
for Meals, Ready-to-eat.
   ``The idea is to provide every service member with a hot turkey
meal,'' said U.S. Army Capt. Glenda Kitchen, spokeswoman for
military operations here. ``We're trying to make it a festive
event.''
   Part of the trimmings include decorations of paper turkeys and
cornucopia horns.
   ``Being out in the desert and the heat isn't going to change
anything. It's still part of being American,'' said Marine Sgt. Don
White, 32, of Winter Haven, Fla. ``It's always a sacrifice to be
away from home. Sometimes you got to make that sacrifice.
Somebody's got to be on the job.''
   Lance Cpl. Donald Tuyls, 24, of Poway, Calif., will be away from
his wife and daughter. But it won't stop him from doing his duty.
   ``I always took holidays in stride,'' Tuyls said. ``Hey, I'll
fight on Christmas Day if I have to. It won't stop me.''
   Army Sgt. Daniel Walker, 29, of Sacramento, Calif., will be
thinking of his wife and two kids. A National Guardsman, he was
activated for duty in Saudi Arabia and arrived Nov. 6.
   ``I've spent holidays away from home before, and it's always
been hard on the family,'' Walker said.
   The special menu will mean a lot to the soldiers in the Army's
75th Field Artillery Brigade, which is one of the northernmost
deployed units in Saudi Arabia.
   ``We haven't had a salad for months up there. For Thanksgiving,
we're getting a salad and all kinds of good stuff,'' said Sgt.
Kenneth Hetzer 32. ``I don't know what we'll have for lunch.
Another MRE, I guess.''

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said today she
will battle to retain her leadership against her most serious
political challenge since taking office in 1979.
   ``I fight on. I fight to win,'' Mrs. Thatcher said as she left
her office at 10 Downing St. for the House of Commons, where a
second vote on the leadership of the ruling Conservative Party is
scheduled for next week.
   Mrs. Thatcher suffered a resounding defeat Tuesday when she
failed to stop a party leadership challenge by former defense
minister Michael Heseltine in the first round of voting among
Conservative lawmakers.
   The prime minister spent nearly 75 minutes in the House of
Commons, fielding questions after her brief report on the 34-nation
summit on European security, which she attended Monday and Tuesday.
   When Paddy Ashdown, leader of the small Liberal Democratic
Party, suggested Mrs. Thatcher was ``in the twilight days of her
premiership,'' Mrs. Thatcher responded:
   ``The first 11{ years haven't been so bad. With regard to
twilight, please remember there are 24 hours in a day.''
   Mrs. Thatcher also met today with Conservative leaders to assess
her chances.
   With Mrs. Thatcher weakened politically and her long-governing
party severely split, the opposition Labor Party - leading in
opinion polls - is scenting victory.
   ``I think people are far more likely to switch from her to
Michael Heseltine than the other way around,'' said Conservative
lawmaker Timothy Raison, who abstained on the first round.
   Party leaders, including chairman Kenneth Baker and chief whip
Timothy Renton, met with Mrs. Thatcher this afternoon. Renton, the
party's chief vote counter in Parliament, presumably gave Mrs.
Thatcher his view on her support.
   Lord Whitelaw, a former deputy prime minister and a senior
figure in the party, also visited 10 Downing St. It was not
immediately known what they told her.
   Mrs. Thatcher, Europe's longest-serving prime minister, fell
just short of the 15 percent margin she needed to avoid a second
round of voting.
   She received receiving 204 votes to 152 for Heseltine in the
secret ballot, with 16 lawmakers abstaining.
   Conservative Party legislators, who hold 372 seats in the
650-seat House of Commons, will vote for a second time next
Tuesday, and Mrs. Thatcher would be expected to step down as prime
minister if she does does not emerge victorious.
   Rumors that Mrs. Thatcher would resign pushed up the British
pound on currency exchanges late today, dealers said.
   The Times of London today reported strong speculation among
legislators that senior Tories would try to persuade the
strong-willed Mrs. Thatcher to reverse her decision to fight a
second round.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who was in Paris for the 34-nation summit on
European security, is expected on Thursday to lead the debate on
the motion of no confidence proposed by opposition Labor Party
leader Neil Kinnock.
   Heseltine could win the leadership by picking up the 16 votes
that abstained on Tuesday and persuading 19 of Mrs. Thatcher's
supporters to change sides.
   Other candidates have until noon Thursday to join the race.
   In the second round, a simple majority can win, but other
candidates now are free to join the race. If necessary, a third and
final ballot would be held Nov. 29.
   Mrs. Thatcher, 65, has recently suffered a great loss in
popularity, in part because of a new per capita local services tax
that demands the same fee of prince and pauper alike.
   Her government also has been blamed for high inflation and high
interest rates. The Conservatives have trailed Labor in opinion
polls for 16 months.
   Heseltine, 57, also has criticized Mrs. Thatcher's reluctance to
fully integrate Britain into the European Community.
   She became prime minister when the Conservatives won the 1979
general election and is now in her third term.
   The next general election must be held by mid-1992 at the latest
but the prime minister of the day can call one any time before
then.
   If he becomes prime minister, Heseltine has pledged to
substitute what he calls ``caring capitalism'' for Mrs. Thatcher's
austere free market policies.
   In addition, he has focused on her lone opposition among
European Common Market leaders to closer political and financial
unity in the Community.
   Heseltine has also promised to review the new per capita tax,
which sparked anti-Tory riots in London and elsewhere this year.
   Heseltine resigned as defense secretary in 1986 in a fight over
rival merits of European and U.S. rescue packages for the Westland
helicopter company.

<HEAD>Keys to Keating Five Defense - C-SPAN, Puzzles, Mother Teresa?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rhetorical excess is no stranger in the U.S.
Senate, but it still seemed a little out of place to find Mother
Teresa's name coming up this week in defense of the Keating Five.
   Dennis DeConcini, one of the five senators, invoked her name as
he held nothing back in an impassioned defense against allegations
of misconduct in behalf of savings-and-loan owner Charles H.
Keating Jr.,
   Mother Teresa, the Nobel Peace Prize winner for her selfless
work on behalf of the world's poor, might seem a far cry from
Keating, who has become a symbol for some of the S&amp;L scandals.
   But the two are linked, the Arizona Democrat told the Senate
Ethics Committee. Keating, who gave substantial political
contributions to each of the five senators, also contributed to
Mother Teresa's cause, he said.
   So much so, DeConcini said, that when he had occasion to meet
her once, in 1986, and told her he was from Arizona, also Keating's
home state, ``The first thing she said, `How is my friend Charlie
Keating?'''
   DeConcini was trying to make the point that Keating was well
thought of just a short time ago, at the time the senators
intervened with federal banking regulators on his behalf.
   Robert S. Bennett, the ethics panel's special counsel, couldn't
resist the opening left to him.
   When DeConcini and a roomful of lawyers had finally finished,
Bennett rose to discuss with the committee the order of witnesses
he intended to call. First would come an aide to one of the

   And then, he began, ``Mother Teresa. ...''
   He slapped his hand on the table top. No, just kidding. He
wouldn't call Mother Teresa to verify the story.

   It's often said that the ethics panel's hearings amount to a
public trial for the five senators.
   It would be more accurate to say there are two trials for each
of the senators: one, before their peers, and two, the trial before
a public audience.
   The hearings, which have recessed until Monday, are being
carried live on the C-SPAN cable television network.
   Everyone in the large Senate hearing room is mindful of the
larger audience. And after each day's testimony, some senators head
for the hallway where a dozen or so television cameras stand vigil
in search of notable passersby.
   The senators under scrutiny often stop, seeing one more chance
to declare their innocence. Don Riegle, D-Mich., spoke for nearly
90 minutes to the committee last Friday, then marched out front and
took all questions.
   But Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., took the public relations effort
to new heights. After stopping for the cameras after his appearance
Friday, he went on C-SPAN's live post-hearing television show and
took telephone calls from viewers, including some extremely hostile
ones.

   Once the Senate held its celebrated hearings in its ornate
Caucus Room. But no more. Nowadays they are held in something
called the Hart Central Hearing Facility, a fancy name for what
amounts to a big television studio.
   The room has a contemporary look, with brown wood paneling on
the sides and a polished stone backdrop behind the committee
members.
   What's not seen on the television screen are the built-in
television booths. The room is two stories tall, and at the upper
level are booths with soundproof glass windows that look down on
the meeting below, much like a football press box or a political
convention's anchor booths.
   Inside, production crews and reporters can watch the proceedings
while listening on piped-in sound, their computers and telephones
at hand. Just below are recessed areas for television cameras and
still photographers.

   While courtroom lawyers are expected to produce rhetorical
flourishes, senators are no less theatrical.
   Bennett began his initial address to the committee by waving
around a boxed puzzle, saying he was about to paint the verbal
picture that the members would later be guided by when they fit
together the pieces of evidence. He shook it for effect.
   When it came his turn to offer an initial defense, Riegle
brought his own puzzle box, held it aloft and jostled pieces onto
the desk around him. Pieces, he said, are sometimes missing.
   Bennett, in the role of Riegle's prosecutor, watched from across
the room.
   ``Mine's bigger,'' he announced.

   Some 20,000 children live in orphanages in the
Russian republic and most suffer from neurological disabilities
caused by pollution, alcoholism, malnutrition and poverty, a
newspaper reported Wednesday.
   Trud, the trade union newspaper, said many of the children
living in 274 orphanages in Russia were abandoned by their parents.
Russia is the largest of the 15 Soviet republics.
   The newspaper said almost three-quarters of the children had
problems with their central nervous systems, but it did not specify
what the disabilities were or elaborate.
   Trud said 65 percent of the children at one unidentified Moscow
orphanage had parents who lived elsewhere, but abandoned them after
deciding ``it's going to be better this way.''
   ``One woman ran away from the maternity home right after her
child was born. When the police found her, she explained that this
was her sixth child, that her husband is held in custody, and that
she has no money to pay the rent,'' the newspaper said.
   ``So she wrote an application asking the orphanage to accept her
child for at least three years.''
   Trud said it costs the government about $18 a day to keep a
child in an orphanage. It said that when a woman who placed her
child in an orphanage learned of the cost, she exclaimed: ``If the
state could give us this money, we'd never have parted with our
son.''

   President Bush will meet Friday in
Switzerland with Syrian President Hafez Assad to discuss the
Persian Gulf crisis, the White House announced today.
   Bush will fly to Geneva for the two-hour meeting following a
Thanksgiving day visit with U.S. troops and a stop in Cairo for
talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, said presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater said the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait was the focus of
the meeting, but that the plight of U.S. hostages in captivity in
Lebanon also would be discussed.
   It will be the first meeting between a U.S. and Syrian president
since Jimmy Carter met Assad in Geneva in 1977.
   Syria is a hard-line Arab state accused by the State Department
of sponsoring international terrorism and suppressing human rights.
   But relations have warmed since Syria joined the U.S.-led
coalition against Iraq last August.
   The Syrians have promised to send 15,000 troops to join the
international force deployed in Saudi Arabia, and Secretary of
State James Baker visited Syria last month to discuss its role in
the coalition.
   ``As a result of contacts between the governments of the United
States and Syria, it has been agreed that President George Bush and
President Hafez Assad will hold a meeting in Geneva on Nov. 23,
1990,'' said a statement issued aboard Air Force One as it took
Bush to Saudi Arabia. Bush spent three days in Paris at a 34-nation
summit on European security.
   A similar statement was issued by the Syrian government in
Damascus.
   Diplomatic sources in Damascus noted that the summit, which they
said was requested by the White House, revives hope that the ordeal
of the Western hostages, who include six Americans, might be
heading toward an end.
   An editorial in the Syrian government newspaper Tishrin earlier
this month linked the release of hostages held by pro-Iranian
extremists in Lebanon to Britain and the United States improving
ties with Syria.
   The hostages, in addition to the Americans, are four Britons,
two Germans and an Italian.
   The longest-held of these captives is American journalist Terry
Anderson, 43, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   ``The two presidents will discuss a number of international and
regional issues,'' the joint Syrian-U.S. statement said.
   Speaking to reporters aboard the plane, Fitzwater said ``the
main purpose of the meeting is to discuss the situation in the
gulf.''
   He said the meeting was arranged by a number of U.S. allies,
specifically Egypt and Turkey. ``They thought it should happen,''
he said.
   Bush was originally scheduled to return to Washington directly
from Cairo Friday evening. He will now be returning in the early
hours of Saturday, Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater also said efforts were made for Bush to meet with
Jordan's King Hussein in Paris, but that the monarch ``said he
couldn't come.''
   But Jordan, which shown sympathy for Iraq in the gulf crisis,
blamed Bush.
   The Royal Palace in Amman announced Monday that Bush had
indefinitely postponed a meeting with Hussein which was scheduled
to be held in Paris on Tuesday.
   Government sources said Bush postponed the meeting after Hussein
accused the United States last Saturday of a double standard in its
relationship with Iraq.
   The king said that by condemning Iraq for invading Kuwait but
supporting Israel which occupied other Arab lands, the United
States was guilty of ``blatant and shameless'' conduct.
   Ties between Washington and Damascus have steadily improved
since Assad's government joined the U.S.-led international alliance
against Iraq's Saddam Hussein after his invasion of Kuwait on
Aug.2.
   It was the first time in almost two decades that Washington and
Damascus have agreed on a conflict in the Middle East. Until then,
Syria had been a staunch critic of U.S. Middle East policy, mainly
because of Washington's support of Israel.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government, however,
has refused to reward Damascus for its stance on the Gulf crisis.
   Anglo-Syrian ties were severed four years ago after Britain
announced that it had conclusive evidence that Syria was behind an
attempt to blow up an Israeli jetliner at Heathrow Airport in April
1986.
   Relations further deteriorated after a Syrian-based radical
group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command, was implicated in the Pan Am explosion over Lockerbie,
Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988, in which 270 people were killed.

<TEXT>
   A 16-year-old boy was kicked to death in a
gang initiation rite meant to test his toughness, police said.
   Paul Ruedas died after being hit by a spinning karate kick from
a gang member that knocked him to the pavement, authorities said.
   But the teen-ager's parents and friends said Ruedas wasn't
likely to have wanted to join a gang. They say the attack may have
stemmed from a disagreement with gang members.
   The youth died Tuesday at a hospital where gang members took him
Monday night, police said.
   Authorities said Ruedas is the third person involved with the
same gang to die this year.
   The boy's mother, Frances Ruedas, said the only way her son
would agree to join a gang is if he bowed to intimidation.
``Instead of intimidating him further, they just beat him to
death,'' she said.
   Tony Robert Parrotte, 22, surrendered to police Tuesday in the
area where police said the initiation ceremony occurred. He was
being held in lieu of $40,000 bail on a charge of aggravated
assault, filed before Ruedas died. Police were discussing upgrading
the charge with the district attoreny.
   Police said Ruedas and another youth had been ``walking the
line'' as part of an initiation into the gang. Walking the line is
a rite in which gang members form a double column, or as in Ruedas'
case, a circle, and hit the initiates as they walk past.
   Homicide Sgt. John Jones said Ruedas was standing when one gang
member made a ``spinning karate move'' that struck Ruedas in the
face and caused his head to hit the pavement.

   Golfing gangsters have become the bane of Japan's
genteel country clubs, and one association of course owners has
decided to do something about the ``flowers of evil that spoil our
greens.''
   They've promised to bar Japan's ``tattooed men,'' a euphemism
for gangsters, who have been increasingly drawn to the expensive
and high-status world of Japanese golf.
   ``We will not allow gangsters to join our clubs, not allow them
on our courses, and we will not allow people with tattoos in our
showers,'' says a pamphlet by the Council to Rid Chiba Golf Courses
of Gangsters.
   The council claims as members all 108 country clubs in Chiba
prefecture, a state on Tokyo's eastern border.
   ``I believe it has been an effective part of our anti-crime
efforts,'' said council executive Mikiji Komatsu.
   He said a new edition of the 20-page pamphlet was published last
month after an enthusiastic response to the original printing two
years ago. About 30,000 copies have been printed.
   So how do you spot a gangster with his shirt on?
   ``Most of them drive expensive foreign cars, and are surrounded
by bodyguards or underlings,'' the pamphlet says. ``They wear their
hair in tight, short curls or have shaved heads and wear
sunglasses.
   ``Part of the little finger on their left hand is missing. If
they are missing any other fingers you can assume that is because
of an accident, and does not indicate they are gangsters. To hide
their tatoos they wear long-sleeved shirts even in the summer.''
   The brightly colored tattoos, often covering most of their
torsos, are a trademark of Japanese gangsters, who often cut off
sections of their fingers to show devotion to their boss.
   Besides golfing for relaxation and amusement, the gangsters have
used the courses as a setting for high-stakes illegal gambling,
police say. At least one gang-related murder has been reported on a
golf course.
   Course operators fear mobsters can lead to a bad reputation for
the course and lower the value of memberships, which can approach
$1 million at the most prestigious Tokyo clubs.
   Non-members can pay up to $250 for 18 holes at some courses.
   The pamphlet also explains what kind of tricks gangsters use to
make golf reservations without divulging their backgrounds.
   Its cartoon-style illustrations show scar-faced thugs -
``flowers of evil that spoil our greens'' - clubbing innocent
golfers while course workers telephone the police.
   ``Manners are important in the sport of golf,'' it says.
``Please help us create a bright environment on the courses, free
of violence.''
   Police estimate that Japan has about 90,000 gangsters, which are
known as ``yakuza,'' meaning good for nothing. They often keep a
high profile, operate out of well-marked offices and wear lapel
pins to denote their gang membership.
   For decades, their appearance on golf courses was looked upon as
an unavoidable evil.
   But while golf courses take action against the gangs, police
have made little progress in uprooting the underworld.
   Authorities believe the gangs have reacted to increased outside
pressure by consolidating their forces, creating huge syndicates
that rake in an estimated $9 billion each year on gambling,
extortion, drugs and other illegal activities.
   Yoshinori Watanabe, head of the nearly 30,000-member
Yamaguchi-gumi, Japan's largest gang, was convicted of assault last
year for a fight on a golf course in 1984. He was given a suspended
sentence, and continues to be a devoted duffer.
   Other gangland golfers boast they regularly travel to Hawaii or
Guam to pursue their sport.
   The Chiba golf course owners' council, formed in 1986, is one of
a growing number of grass-roots organizations that have teamed up
with police to rid gangsters from their neighborhoods or
businesses.
   ``The movement began after problems with gambling of hundreds of
millions of yen and even a murder (1985 in the southern Japanese
city of Fukuoka) on golf courses in other prefectures were
reported,'' said a Chiba police official. ``Our efforts are
preventative, and we think they have worked.''
   While there has not been a great increase in arrests, fewer
gangsters are being allowed onto courses, resulting in less
disturbances for regular golfers, according to the official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``We've been telling our younger members not to take showers at
the clubs,'' said the boss of one Tokyo-based gang in a recent
interview. ``We don't want to frighten the regular members.''

<TEXT>
   Leaders from East and West on Wednesday buried the
Cold War, uniting for the first time in solemn commitment to
democracy and vowing to combat the economic hardships that threaten
to divide Europe anew.
   The signing of the Paris Charter by the United States, Canada
and all European nations except Albani was a victory for the
unheralded millions who fought tyranny and violence in Europe's
troubled past.
   But it posed new challenges for the newly united northern
hemisphere, whose leaders left Paris without consensus on action in
the Persian Gulf crisis.
   President Bush flew to Saudi Arabia without Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's backing for a United Nations resolution
sanctioning the use of force to get Iraq out of Kuwait.
   Gorbachev, meanwhile, won pledges of food and other aid to help
his reforms survive the rigors of winter. But neither he nor East
European leaders came away with any guarantees that the West will
help ease mounting ethnic and social strife.
   Seated around a three-dimensional map of Europe and North
America, the 34 leaders took 15 minutes to sign into history their
commitment to free elections, the rule of law and a market economy.
   French President Francois Mitterrand, host of the three-day
summit, was the first to sign the red leather-bound document.
Helmut Kohl, attending his first summit as leader of a united
Germany, was second, followed by Bush.
   ``The era of confrontation and division in Europe has ended,''
the charter declared. ``Europe whole and free is calling for a new
beginning.''
   Bush said, ``We are closing a chapter in history. The Cold War
is over.''
   To cement their new unity, the leaders agreed to meet again, in
Helsinki in 1992. Their foreign ministers will gather in Berlin
next year, meeting annually after that. Senior officials will meet
even more often.
   The charter established a small office in Prague to run the
process, known as the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe (CSCE). It also set up a Vienna center for the prevention of
conflict and an office in Warsaw to monitor free elections.
   The only European states that have not yet held free balloting
are the Yugoslav republics of Serbia and Montenegro, which vote
Dec. 9, and Albania, where elections still dominated by the ruling
communists are due in February.
   Albania was limited to observer status at the summit because of
its isolationist policies and lack of political reform.
   The conference charter exulted in the end of Cold War tensions.
``Ours is a time for fulfilling the hopes and expectations our
peoples cherished for decades: steadfast commitment to democracy
based on human rights and fundamental freedoms; prosperity through
economic liberty and social justice; and equal security for all our
countries,'' it declared.
   Concluding the summit, Mitterrand spoke about the global bonds
forged by the charter and the challenges confronting the nations.
   ``If it is true that a shot fired on the soil (of Europe) echoes
in a Canadian forest, then it is also true that any wave born in
the Pacific breaks on our continent's shores,'' he said.
   ``Everything has to be rethought,'' Mitterrand said. ``No
institution will escape this critical re-examination: the European
Community, NATO, the Council of Europe.''
   At the summit opening Monday, leaders from the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization and the crumbling Warsaw Pact signed an accord
scrapping vast arsenals of tanks, guns and other weapons.
   The two military alliances also signed a non-aggression pact and
measures allowing Europe's armies to know more about each than ever
before.
   East European leaders suggested in Paris that it is only a
matter of time before the Warsaw Pact disbands. Hungarian Premier
Joszef Antall, host of a Warsaw Pact next month, said he wants the
alliance dissolved by 1992.
   NATO leaders have clung firm to their alliance without saying
how it might accommodate the security needs of newly democratic
Eastern Europe or save the tax dollars of Western citizens.
   Europe faces long soul-searching on economic unity, both on the
continent and across the Atlantic. The United States and Canada are
currently at loggerheads with the EC over its massive subsidies to
farmers.
   The yawning gap in living standards between the rich West and
poor East also threatens stability. United Nations officials
estimate as many as 25 million citizens of the former East bloc
want to emigrate in search of wealth and stability.
   ``There must now be no borders which perpetuate the prosperity
divide,'' said Kohl. Germany is expected to be a key source of
Western economic largesse to the East.
   Another potential peril are ethnic tensions breeding fierce
nationalism and threatening the post-World War II borders sealed in
the 1975 Helsinki Final Act, which launched the CSCE process.
   Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and especially the Soviet Union face
ethnic disputes.
   Political frictions also impinged on the summit. French Premier
Michel Rocard survived a confidence vote Monday night, but
Britain's Margaret Thatcher was forced Tuesday into a second round
in a damaging contest for leadership of her Conservative Party.
   ``There was a general feeling of sadness for her and good wishes
from everyone there,'' said Canada's Brian Mulroney.

   Junk bond financier Michael Milken was sentenced
today to 10 years in prison for breaking federal securities and tax
laws in the most celebrated case of financial corruption in Wall
Street history.
   Milken, who sobbed at points during the sentencing, stood with
his head down as U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood pronounced the
stiffest punishment yet in the fraud scandals that have gripped
Wall Street since the mid-1980s.
   In addition, she sentenced him to three years' probation during
which he must work 1,800 hours a year in community service.
   Milken, 44, faced a maximum of 28 years but Wood's sentence is
far stiffer than many had predicted. He must serve at least
one-third of his prison term before he can be considered for
release.
   ``I believe that a prison term is required for the purposes of
general deterrence,'' Wood told a court crammed with 200
spectators, including many of Milken's friends and supporters.
   Wood said Milken's misuse of his leadership position constituted
``serious crimes warranting serious punishment and the discomfort
of being removed from society.''
   She said Milken was a man of ``talent and industry'' but that a
long prison term was required to send a message to other possible
securities-law violators.
   The judge said she considered evidence of additional crimes,
including obstruction of justice by Milken in handing down the
sentence.
   He was ordered to begin his sentence March 4, 1991. No federal
prison was designated.
   The sentence capped the long, tumultuous saga of the former
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. executive who was first implicated in
an aggressive government insider trading investigation by
speculator Ivan Boesky in 1986.
   Milken of Encino, Calif., personally made more than $1 billion
through a junk bond empire that altered American corporate finance
in the 1980s.
   Sobbing at times during the 90-minute hearing, he told the
judge: ``What I did violated not just the law but all of my
principles and values and I will regret it for the rest of my life.
I am truly sorry.''
   Before Wood issued the sentence, Milken's attorney Arthur Liman
asked her to consider the financier's more than $360 million in
charitable contributions and other acts of generosity.
   ``He will never repeat his mistakes. He is a changed person,''
Liman said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jess Fardella countered that ``despite
his talents and opportunities, Mr. Milken sought to multiply his
success through the vehicle of fraud.''
   Milken pleaded guilty in April to six counts of conspiracy and
fraud related to illegal securities trading after denying a much
broader array of accusations.
   None of the charges involved insider trading or junk bonds, the
risky debt securities Milken turned into a tool for capital raising
and corporate takeovers.
   As part of his plea bargain, Milken also agreed to pay $600
million in fines and restitution to defrauded investors, the
largest penalty against an individual in U.S. history.
   The Wall Street fraud probe revealed seamy pockets of corruption
at top firms during major investment deals and resulted in about 50
indictments.
   Boesky, by comparison, was sentenced to three years in prison
and penalized $100 million after pleading guilty to one criminal
count of lying to federal regulators. He served 18 months in
prison.
   Before he was sentenced, Milken wrote an 11-page letter to Wood
apologizing for his crimes and asking for a chance to rebuild his
life by performing community service.
   ``I never dreamed I could do anything that would result in being
a felon,'' Milken wrote. ``But I did break the law. I was wrong,
and no matter how sorry I am I have to accept that fact.''
   Wood delayed sentencing, originally scheduled for Oct. 1, for a
hearing into government charges of additional crimes beyond
Milken's guilty plea.
   Prosecutors revealed that Drexel paid Milken a total of $1.1
billion from 1984 to 1987, including $550 million the final year.
That $550 million paycheck put him in the Guinness Book of World
Records.
   Drexel in February filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
The firm was hurt by its 1989 guilty plea to six felonies, its
agreement to pay $650 million in penalties and the collapse of the
junk bond market.
   Regulators have pinned much of the blame for the savings and
loan crisis on Drexel, accusing it of plundering S&amp;Ls through its
junk bond practices.

   U.S. military forces caught in the Middle East
crisis and unable to pay back taxes may qualify for special
treatment, the Internal Revenue Service said Wednesday.
   Procedures for getting more time to pay were outlined by the IRS
as part of an announcement providing guidance to reservists
activated because of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, to regular
military personnel and to hostages held by Iraq.
   Here are answers, based on the IRS guidance, to often-asked
questions:
   Q. Is hazardous-duty pay taxable?
   A. Yes, just like regular pay, although basic allowances for
quarters, subsistence and uniforms are tax-free.
   Q. Is there a booklet that provides details on this?
   A. Yes. It is Publication 3, free from the IRS, entitled ``Tax
Information for Military Personnel.''
   Q. I am an activated reservist awaiting shipment to Saudi
Arabia. I received a bill for past-due taxes, which I cannot pay.
What can I do?
   A. Call the IRS toll-free at 1-800-829-1040 and ask for Form
Letter 1175. Or, you may write the IRS giving your name, Social
Security number, monthly income and source of income before
military service, current income, rank, the date you entered
service and the date you will be eligible for discharge. It also
would be helpful if you enclosed a copy of your activation orders.
   You will have to show that your income dropped because of
activation. If the IRS approves, you will be able to defer payment
of back taxes until six months after your initial period of service
ends. You will not be charged penalty or interest during the
deferment.
   Q. What if my income did not drop?
   A. The IRS will reduce to 6 percent the interest charged on
overdue taxes. The money saved by paying the lower rate will not be
taxable income.
   Q. What happens to my employer-paid health insurance when I
report for active duty?
   A. Your employer must give you the opportunity to continue under
your old plan, but you may have to pay for the coverage.
   Q. I recently sold my home and now I learn I will be activated.
Since I obviously won't be buying another home soon, what is the
tax situation with the profits from the sale?
   A. In most cases, a person avoids profit on the sale of a home
if a new home costing at least as much is purchased within two
years before or after the sale. If you are on active duty
indefinitely or for more than 90 days, the replacement period is up
to four years. If that extended duty is outside the United States,
the replacement period starts one year after your foreign tour
ends. The maximum replacement period is eight years after the sale.
   Q. My wife and I file joint tax returns but because she is being
called up, it will be difficult to get her signature.
   A. Have her sign a document giving you power to sign her name.
This can be done on IRS Form 2848 or by getting a general power of
attorney that specifically covers tax returns. A copy of the signed
document must be attached to your return.
   Q. My husband is a hostage in Iraq and the IRS sent a notice
about our 1988 taxes. What can I do?
   A. Call the IRS at 1-800-829-4351 and the IRS will suspend any
collection or audit activities. Any penalties charged while your
husband is being held generally will be waived.
   Q. What if my husband is still being held when our next tax
return is due April 15?
   A. Assuming you file joint returns, your filing deadline will be
extended until the 15th day of the third month following his
release. You should notify IRS at 1-800-829-4351 that you need the
extension.
   Q. I am not in the military but had to leave Kuwait after the
Iraqi invasion. What happens to the foreign-income exclusion I have
been expecting?
   A. Under certain conditions, an American working abroad but not
for the U.S. government may avoid tax on up to $70,000 of foreign
earnings each year. You must be a resident of a foreign country for
an entire tax year or be present for at least 330 days during 12
consecutive months. Those residence and presence tests have been
waived for 1990 for Iraq, Kuwait, Libya and Yemen; if other
conditions are met you may claim the exclusion even though you were
forced to leave one of those countries before the time test was
met.
   Q. Is there similar relief for my deductible job-related moving
expenses?
   A. If you took a job in the Middle East earlier this year but
were forced by events to leave before meeting the minimum
requirements for working in that job, you still may be able to
deduct moving expenses.

<HEAD>Bush Arrives In Saudi Arabia For Official Talks, Thanksgiving With
Troops</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the eve of a Thanksgiving-day
trip to the front lines, President Bush conferred with Arab leaders
on the three-month stand-off against Iraq. He said the 230,000
American troops on Saudi soil were not on a ``mission impossible.''
   After a five-and-a-half hour flight from Paris, Bush stepped
from Air Force One into the warm, humid Saudi evening at this Red
Sea port and was greeted by King Fahd. He was to meet privately
with the exiled emir of Kuwait.
   On Thursday Bush and his wife Barbara will share Thanksgiving
with servicemen and servicewomen at two desert military sites in
Saudi Arabia and on a Navy ship in the Persian Gulf.
   ``If I do nothing else, I will convey to them the heartfelt
thanks of the American people at this very special time of year for
Americans,'' Bush said.
   He told reporters he would tell the troops that ``we are going
to prevail, that they're not there on a mission impossible.''
   Earlier Wednesday, Bush told reporters in Paris that he and
Mikhail S. Gorbachev now see ``eye to eye'' on the crisis, even
though the Soviet president's public statements have reflected a
greater reluctance to use military force.
   The president reportedly is seeking support for a U.N. Security
Council resolution authorizing military force against Saddam if he
does not leave Kuwait by a certain date.
   French President Francois Mitterrand said in Paris Wednesday
that the U.N. resolution against Iraq would likely be adopted
within three weeks.
   The White House also announced Wednesday that Bush will meet
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad in Geneva on Friday on his way
home.
   ``The two presidents will discuss a number of international and
regional issues,'' said a short statement issued as Bush flew here
aboard Air Force One from Paris, where he had attended a European
summit.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Iraqi
occupation of Kuwait was the focus of the meeting, but that the
plight of U.S. hostages in captivity in Lebanon also would be
discussed.
   The meeting was expected to last several hours, following talks
in Cairo with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
   Although the United States still considers Syria a terrorist
state, the president agreed to the first meeting between leaders of
the two countries in 13 years because of Syria's importance in the
coalition trying to pry Iraq from Kuwait, Fitzwater said.
   Syria has contributed about 5,000 troops to the U.S.-led
military operation confronting Saddam across the Kuwait and Iraq
borders.
   Although Fitzwater said that the visit did not imply a change in
U.S. condemnation of Syria for terrorist activities, an
administration official travelling with the president said ``we
think there's opportunity to move ahead on other issues once the
crisis is behind us.''
   Fitzwater also disclosed that Bush while in Paris had tried to
arrange a separate meeting with Lebanon's King Hussein but that
Hussein ``couldn't come.''
   In Paris, Bush attended a three-day, 34-nation summit meeting on
ending Cold War tensions in Europe.
   
   - The following material embargoed for 6 p.m. EST -
   
   In a pre-recorded Thanksgiving message to U.S. troops, broadcast
on armed forces radio worldwide beginning Wednesday evening, the
president said:
   ``You know, Barbara and I have spent a lot of Thanksgivings with
a family we're proud of. Well, this year is no different, as we
spend Thanksgiving in the Persian Gulf.
   ``And as Americans celebrate this special day back home, know
that you are in their hearts. America is proud of you and the job
you're doing.''
   
   - end embargoed material -
   
   Bush already has dispatched more than 230,000 U.S. servicemen
and women to the region, and has announced plans to send an
additional 200,000 over the next few months.
   The president was to spend the night here, then fly east across
the Saudi peninsula to the Persian Gulf city of Dhahran, not far
from the Kuwaiti border.
   He and his wife, top aides and a press pool of about two dozen
were to board helicopters to visit three sites - an Army
installation, a Marine encampment and a naval vessel in the Persian
Gulf.
   For security reasons, the White House refused to identify in
advance the location of the bases, the name of the vessel, or even
say how long the helicopter rides would take.
   Still, Bush said he was not concerned for his safety and that
``I have never felt more secure in going anyplace than I do in
going to see our troops over there...It's not a risky mission in my
mind.''
   Meanwhile, Bush suggested he and Gorbachev were closer on the
issue of using force than public statements by both governments
might suggest.
   ``We see eye to eye on the Persian Gulf,'' he said and disputed
accounts that suggested he and Gorbachev were at odds.
   ``If we have differences, they are extraordinarily minor and
they can be resolved,'' he said.

<HEAD>Scholar Says Lenin Had Czar Shot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin approved the
executions of Czar Nicholas II and his family in 1918, according to
new evidence published in the most widely read Soviet publication.
   The latest edition of the weekly Arguments and Facts quotes
scholar Eduard Radzinsky as saying the signatures of Lenin and
fellow leader Yakov Sverdlov were on a telegram about the execution
of the czar's family sent to local authorities in Ekaterinburg.
   The newspaper, which has a circulation of 32.7 million, quotes
former Bolshevik leader Leon Trotsky as writing in his diary that
``the decision was taken in Moscow and with the direct
participation of Lenin.''
   The disclosure of Lenin's involvement - suspected by Western
historians and reported earlier this year in the weekly Soviet
magazine Ogonyok - is sure to further tarnish the near-holy image
of the founder of the Soviet state.
   Under the sardonic headline, ``Toward a bloody battle'' - lyrics
from a famous Soviet revolutionary song - Arguments and Facts said
Soviet citizens had been misled about who was behind the murders.
It illustrated the article with an icon-like representation of
Nicholas II.
   In July 1918, soldiers acting on Bolshevik orders shot Nicholas
and his family in a basement in the Ural mountains city of
Sverdlovsk, then called Ekaterinburg. Nicholas, born in 1868, was
forced to abdicate in March 1917 as revolutionary discontent swept
Russia.
   The Communists seized power in November 1917.
   ``For 72 years, there was a myth that the decision to shoot the
czar and his family was taken in Ekaterinburg by local authorities.
Lenin and the government in Moscow found out about it only after it
happened,'' Arguments and Facts quoted Radzinsky as saying.
   Lenin has been increasingly criticized in some publications and
demonstrations in the Soviet Union.
   In what is called ``Red Terror,'' Lenin is accused of creating
the Soviet secret police and the network of labor camps that came
to be known later as the Gulag.
   Some groups want the monarchy restored in Russia, and the Soviet
press has written frequently in recent years about Nicholas and his
fate.
   Last year, the weekly Moscow News reported that a former
policeman had unearthed human remains he identified as those of
Nicholas and his family 10 years ago and kept the grisly find
secret.
   Until now, Moscow News said, investigators assumed they could
not find the bodies of Nicholas and the others because they were
reportedly dropped into a mineshaft where they dissolved under a
layer of acid. Only traces of buttons, some jewelry and a severed
human finger were reported to have remained.

<HEAD>Children's Messages in a Bottle Found Three Years Later near Guam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FULLERTON, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Waiting three years for mail to be
delivered might seem like a long time, but the surprise for
children at Sunset Lane School was that it got anywhere at all.
   A wine bottle carrying a dozen messages from teacher Angelita
Woodworth's class was set adrift in the Pacific in 1987. More than
6,000 miles later, the bottle recently washed up on a rocky beach
on Saipan, an island near Guam, where Ted Gebhardt discovered it.
   ``It seems like the romantic type of story that you always read
in those pirate-type novels,'' Gebhardt, a lawyer, said this week
from his home in Saipan, the largest of the Northern Marianas.
   The children, now in the sixth grade, couldn't believe it when
they received a letter from Gebhardt, along with their original
notes.
   ``When I first found out, I was amazed,'' said 11-year-old
Francis Kwang. ``I thought it would sink to the bottom of the
ocean.''
   Ms. Woodworth has enjoyed success in dispatching messages in
bottles. A previous class' bottle was tossed into the Atlantic
Ocean near New York in 1986 and was found at Scotland within 18
months, she said.
   The teacher said her pupils consider themselves much older and
wiser now and were somewhat embarrassed to reread the letters they
wrote as third-graders.
   ``One of them turned really red and said, `How could I write
such a dumb letter?''' Ms. Woodworth said.
   Twelve-year-old Brian Costales said he would have written his
letter differently if he had known who would receive it.
   ``I would have asked for money: `Dear lawyer, send $5,''' he
joked.

   The hoppin' good low cholesterol food of the
'90s - Bunny Burgers, made with rabbit meat - was merely a wascally
pwank by those guys at Spy magazine, who persuaded four public
relations firms to promote it.
   The cottontail con was conceived for ``Spy TV Pranks,'' a pilot
for a potential weekly program. PR firms were contacted for advice
on the right way to market Bunny Burgers, a rabbit patty garnished
with carrots, said Spy features editor Bruce Hardy.
   The phony fast food joint also offered Hareballs - a sort of
rabbit McNuggets - along with carrot fries and milkshakes.
   ``We came up with a product that was pretty far-fetched,'' said
Hardy.
   Not far-fetched enough. Four firms offered real advice on
pitching the ``low sodium, low cholesterol fast food of the '90s,''
said Spy show producer David Kaminsky. Among other things, Bunny
Burgers was advised to drop the Hareball idea.
   The PR firms were later told of the scam and were paid for their
time and advice. Spy agreed not to reveal which companies were
involved.
   One firm, Fleishman Hillard, did not go for the hare-raising
meal, according to the New York Post.
   The company considered showing up with a presentation for
``Double Bugs,'' ``Double Bugs with Cheese'' and ``Thumper Cajun
Style'' sandwiches, the Post reported.
   ``Bunny Burgers smelled fishy, and besides, we had a conflict
with our Puppy-on-a-Stick (account),'' company vice president Jan
Van Meet told the Post.

   A judge recommended that a man
get a vasectomy and sentenced him to three years in prison for
fracturing his baby's skull because the infant wouldn't stop
crying.
   Stephen Anthony Judd, 19, pleaded no contest Tuesday to one
count of aggravated child abuse for dropping his son on his head on
a table.
   ``If it was left up to me, I'd give you 15 years in prison.
Anyone who could do that to a 7-week-old baby deserves no mercy,''
said Circuit Judge Giles P. Lewis, who also ordered five years'
probation.
   ``I don't have the authority to order a vasectomy, but I'd think
long and hard about it if I were you, son,'' Lewis said.
   The maximum penalty for aggravated child abuse is 15 years in
prison, but sentencing guidelines called for a term of 2{ to 3{
years, said Assistant State Attorney Howard Maltz. Because of
prison overcrowding, Judd probably will serve about a third of the
term, Maltz said.

<HEAD>Official Resigns After Miss America Threatens to Keep Texas Out</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with Magness resigning. Changes byline. No

<BYLINE>By MIKE COCHRAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former chairman of the Miss Texas
Pageant, who allegedly made lewd comments to contestants, today
severed his ties with the competition at the insistence of the Miss
America pageant.
   Officials of the national competition said there would be no
Miss Texas in next year's Miss America contest unless B. Don
Magness stepped aside.
   Magness, voluntary chairman of the Texas pageant for 20 years,
resigned in August, just before this year's national contest. But
he stayed on the pageant's board of directors, saying news reports
depicted him unfairly.
   After a two-month investigation, national pageant director
Leonard Horn said Tuesday he would strip the Texas contest of its
franchise - barring its winner from the Miss America competition -
unless Magness stayed off the state board for at least three years.
   Magness announced his resigned at a news conference today and
said Horn's threat amounted to blackmail.
   Magness countered with allegations of his own, contending
national leaders of the pageant are concerned with the number of
black winners of the competition and its ability to attract
sponsors.
   Magness said Horn told him prior to the Miss America pageant in
1989 that it was time for a minority contestant to win. That year,
Debbye Turner, who is black, was chosen the 1990 Miss America. The
1991 winner, Marjorie Vincent, is the fourth black to hold the
title.
   Magness alleged Horn raised concerns about television ratings
and sponsors, should a black woman be chosen for the third year in
a row.
   A Miss America spokeswoman in Atlantic City, N.J., said Horn
could not immediately be reached for comment on Magness' remarks.
   In response to a question, Magness said he was not contending
that the pageant in 1989 was rigged, but added, ``I'm just telling
you what he said.''
   The Texas pageant is among the nation's largest. During Magness'
tenure as chairman, 18 Miss Texases have made it to the national
contest's top 10; two of them, Phyllis George and Shirley Cothran,
won.
   A Life magazine article in August quoted Magness as yelling,
``Come on in, sluts!'' to a group of Miss Texas contestants. He was
quoted as making other sexually explicit remarks as well.
   Magness acknowledged making the remarks but said they were in
jest. He complained that the magazine article was negative and
unfair.
   Later news reports accused Magness of other improprieties,
including trying to influence the outcome of local pageants, making
advances to a beauty queen and having a contestant model swimsuits
alone for him.

   Eight Air Force Academy cadets
have been disciplined for their involvement in a Halloween party in
which seven cadets tried to gross one another out, officials said.
   Among the stunts, one cadet vomited in the face of another
cadet, and a third cadet ate a candied apple from between the
buttocks of another cadet, officials said.
   Investigators found that about 40 cadets witnessed the
performance, but a number of them left.
   The eighth cadet disciplined, a squadron commander, did not take
part in the activities, but failed to stop them. Academy spokesman
Lt. Col. Greg Dziuban said that young man was reassigned, given 50
demerits, required to march 80 hours, and restricted for four
months.
   It was the second bizarre incident at the academy since August,
when six male cadets hid in a darkened room to watch a friend have
sex with a female cadet. Five cadets resigned and three others are
awaiting hearings.

<HEAD>Greenhouse Effect Could Sink Idyllic Islands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MALE, Maldives (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Welcome to paradise - for as long as it
stays above water. The people of this chain of palm-studded islands
fear global warming could condemn their nation to geological
history.
   If the earth gets hotter, as some scientists predict, the
Maldives could be swamped by rising seas and violent storms. The
Indian Ocean archipelago almost certainly would be among the first
casualties of the greenhouse effect.
   ``We may have some islands just disappear. That is according to
the business-as-usual scenario. I would hope that the international
community would take note and do something before that happens,''
said Hussain Shihab, the Maldives' director of environment affairs.
   According to some estimates, unchecked emissions of carbon
dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases will raise the sea
level by a foot in the next 40 years - submerging much of the
Maldives' 175 square miles of land.
   The Maldives, about 400 miles south of India and the same
distance west of Sri Lanka, are little more than clumps of coconut
palms fringed by white sand in a nest of coral reefs.
   The 1,190 islands are clustered in atolls in an archipelago 510
miles long. Just 200 islands are inhabited and a quarter of the
nation's 200,000 people live on Male island, which covers barely
one square mile.
   Few of the islands are more than 6 feet above sea level, so a
big splash can be devastating, as demonstrated in April 1987 when a
tidal wave rolled over the island nation.
   ``We had a storm that was more severe than anyone could ever
remember,'' Shihab said. ``This really woke us up.''
   Two-thirds of Male, the Maldivian capital, was flooded by sea
water. The international airport on neighboring Hulule was closed
for two days, and entire fishing villages were under water.
   Shihab said damage totaled $40 million - half this nation's
annual gross domestic product.
   Some experts said the freak storm originated 4,000 miles away in
the south Indian Ocean, underlining the Maldives' vulnerability to
far-away calamities.
   The disaster forced Maldivians to take a more appreciative look
at their coral reefs, the feeding grounds for a stunning array of
tropical fish. The reefs provide a natural barrier from an often
hostile sea.
   The mining of coral, the basic building material for most houses
here, was forbidden on reefs connected to islands. The ban
eventually will be extended to unattached atolls, although
importing cement will be costly, Shihab said.
   Traditionally dependent on fishing and tuna exports, the
islands' energy needs are small. There is no heavy industry and
Male has only a few dozen cars. Experiments with solar power
promise to further decrease dependency on polluting fossile fuels.
   As a result, the Maldivians have felt few constraints about
pressing for worldwide controls on emissions of carbon dioxide and
other greenhouse gases that threaten the islands.
   These gases build a shield in the atmosphere which traps heat,
and many experts predict higher temperatures will change weather
patterns and raise sea levels, endangering coastal areas and
low-lying countries. Some experts disagree, arguing that such
long-term effects are unclear.
   ``It is the small island states who contribute the least (in
heat-trapping pollutants) which will suffer the most,'' Shihab
said.
   The tropical beauty of the islands is the Maldives' only natural
asset and major source of income other than the sea. When the first
tourist resort opened in 1972, the Maldives were virtually unknown
except as a staging post for the British air force dating from
World War II. The British left in 1976.
   This year the number of tourists is expected to equal the
resident population. Resorts have gone up on 59 previously
uninhabited islands, catering to scuba divers and sun worshipers.
   The influx of tourists has aroused fears of cultural pollution
in this strict Sunni Moslem society which has its own unique
language and script. Travelers are discouraged from visiting all
but a few fishing villages outside the resort islands.
   Passengers arriving on international flights are cautioned not
to bring alcohol, pigs, dogs, statues for worship, pornography,
explosives, guns or drugs - in that order.
   Shihab said the loss of cultural identity would be the real
tragedy if the Maldives were overwhelmed by the environment. ``We
don't want to be refugees of the greenhouse effect,'' he said.

<HEAD>French President Says New U.N. Resolution Likely Within Three
Weeks</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Gulf Rdp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand said today that a
U.N. resolution authorizing an eventual use of force against Iraq
would likely be adopted within three weeks.
   ``With the passage of time, if there is no real progress, the
danger grows,'' Mitterrand told a news conference hours after the
close of a 34-nation summit hosted by France.
   The French leader said that he was asked by President Bush if a
resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq were needed.
``I told him yes.''
   ``We are prepared to discuss it,'' Mitterrand said, reiterating
France's declared readiness to talk about such a resolution. ``As
far as its being put into effect, that's another matter. There is
nothing automatic.''
   He said the resolution would be discussed soon and ``should be
adopted within the next three weeks.''
   Bush has been trying to gain support for a Security Council
resolution that would authorize force against Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein to get him to withdraw from occupied Kuwait.
   The American effort was discussed in numerous U.S.-Soviet
meetings during the conference. But Bush went away from the
conference with no public nod of consent from the Soviets.
   Asked about the Soviet position, Mitterrand replied: ``It is no
great mystery. Mr. Gorbachev ... let it be understood that it (a
new resolution) would be possible for the Soviet Union,''
especially ``if that would weigh on the resolve of Mr. Saddam
Hussein.''
   Saddam must be made to understand he must cede and withdraw from
Kuwait, ``or the die will be cast,'' Mitterrand said.

   Odie the cat may have used up one of his
nine lives.
   The orange tabby - presumed dead - showed up on his owners'
doorstep four days after they had buried him. Or thought they had.
   Odie, owned by state Rep. Lynn Taborsak, disappeared from the
backseat of Taborsak's car Nov. 13.
   Later that night, Taborsak found a dead orange tabby in the
street. She brought it home, wrapped it in a towel, and the family
buried it in their backyard.
   But on Saturday, Odie came home.
   ``The ... cat just came waltzing in,'' Taborsak said.
   Now, the family is going door-to-door, trying to identify the
owners of the cat they buried.
   ``We want the owner, whoever it is, to know their cat was buried
in a loving and respectful manner,'' Taborsak said. ``They don't

   The U.S. Postal Service and union leaders for
660,000 workers accused each other Wednesday of intentionally
botching contract talks so wage and job security disputes would go
to arbitration.
   ``The Postal Service never had any intention of entering into
collective bargaining with the unions. They kept us dangling. Never
once did they get down to the crux of the issues,'' said Vincent
Sombrotto, president of the 234,000-member National Letter Carriers
Association.
   But Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank said it appeared union
leaders were the ones who wanted a third-party involved because
they waited until three days before Tuesday's midnight deadline to
propose a $50 billion pay increase package.
   ``Why three days ahead of time, you would ask for a $50 billion
increase, it's just so far off the wall. It may well be a not very
hidden signal that they want to go to arbitration,'' Frank said.
   The contract dispute was sent to a lengthy binding arbitration
process after three months of talks between the Postal Service and
its four largest unions broke down.
   The stalemate was not expected to create any disruption in mail
service because it is illegal for postal workers to strike.
   Once an impasse is reached in postal talks, federal law provides
for the establishment of a fact-finding commission - under the
direction of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service - to
review the dispute.
   The fact-finders will report within 45 days. If management and
labor still can't reach agreement, an arbitration panel will settle
the dispute. The two sides could waive the fact-finding step and
move straight to arbitration to speed things up. The process could
take up to three months.
   Negotiators also could agree to resume bargaining and settle the
dispute on their own.
   Key disputes were pay increases and how many part-time workers
the Postal Service should be allowed to hire to help it shift to
automation.
   The Postal Service had offered workers automatic cash bonuses of
$950 over two years and additional performance-based bonuses of up
to $1,100 a year if certain customer satisfaction and budget goals
were met.
   Unions, seeking a three-year contract, asked for 8 percent pay
increases the first year and 7 percent raises the next two years.
Letter carriers and clerks make between $24,000 and $31,500 a year,
plus an additional $8,500 in benefits.
   The Postal Service said the unions' $50 billion pay increase
package would mean stamp prices would have to be increased from 25
cents to 43 cents.
   The service, no longer subsidized by taxpayers, must break even
over time. Its board of governors already has proposed raising the
cost of mailing a letter from 25 cents to 30 cents next spring,
regardless of what the contract includes.
   In addition to the Letter Carriers and the Postal Workers, the
other unions involved are the National Postal Mail Handlers Union,
which represents 50,000 mail handlers, and the National Rural
Letter Carriers Association, with about 42,000 members.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev today urged a U.N. Security Council meeting
to discuss the Persian Gulf crisis. French President Francois
Mitterrand said a U.N. resolution authorizing an eventual use of
force against Iraq would likely be adopted within three weeks.
   Iraq, meanwhile, promised to free 157 more Europeans it is
holding, Western officials said. Many have said Saddam Hussein's
policy of releasing hostages gradually is designed to break the
world alliance against Iraq.
   President Bush arrived in Saudi Arabia today after three days in
Paris, saying there were only minor differences between himself and
Gorbachev, the Soviet president, on Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.
   Bush also said he would tell U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia that
they were ``not there on a mission impossible.''
   He then will meet with Syrian President Hafez Assad in Geneva,
U.S. and Syrian officials announced today. The two countries said
the meeting would take place Friday.
   Syrian troops are part of the multinational force massed against
Iraq.
   In Paris, Bush met with Gorbachev and other world leaders on the
gulf crisis but failed to win backing from the Soviets for a U.N.
resolution on using force to drive Iraq from Kuwait.
   However, Bush said he and Gorbachev saw ``eye to eye'' on the
subject of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. He said any
differences between the superpowers were ``extraordinarily minor.''
   Asked if the United Nations might act this month on a U.N.
resolution to use force against Iraq, Bush said: ``Stay tuned.
There's certainly a chance.''
   Later, Gorbachev seemed to move closer to Bush's position. The
Soviet leader urged an immediate Security Council meeting to
address a ``very dangerous'' situation in the gulf ``and take a
decision there.''
   Gorbachev did not elaborate on what any U.N. Security Council
meeting might discuss, or what any solution might involve.
   Mitterrand said a resolution authorizing the use of force
against Iraq was needed.
   ``We are prepared to discuss it,'' Mitterrand said. ``As far as
its being put into effect, that's another matter. There is nothing
automatic.''
   He said the resolution would be discussed soon and ``should be
adopted within the next three weeks.''
   On Tuesday, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said the
Security Council should ``take stock of things and pass appropriate
judgment on what it has been doing.''
   Then, if necessary, he said, the body should ``adopt new
resolutions with a view to implementing all the previous
decisions.''
   Resolutions already approved by the Security Council impose an
economic boycott on Iraq and occupied Kuwait, call for Iraq's
unconditional withdrawal, insist upon restoration of Kuwait's
deposed government and demand Iraq free Western hostages.
   Iraq is holding hundreds of Westerners, many as human shields at
strategic sites to deter attack by the 350,000-strong U.S.-led
multinational force in the gulf. Those troops are arrayed against
an estimated 460,000 Iraqi soldiers, deployed in southern Iraq and
Kuwait.
   French right-wing politician Jean Marie Le Pen, who arrived in
Baghdad Sunday, will take 83 European hostages to Strasbourg, seat
of the European parliament, a member of his delegation said. Le Pen
is a member of the European parliament, which is scheduled to
discuss the gulf crisis on Thursday.
   Captives to be allowed to leave with Le Pen on Thursday included
Britons, Italians, Germans, Irish, Dutch, Danes, Belgians,
Portuguese and Greek.
   The head of a Swiss parliamentary delegation said today that
another 36 hostages would leave Thursday afternoon on a Swissair
charter flight to Zurich. Those hostages were Swiss, Irish and
British.
   Also today, the head of personnel for foreign workers at Ibn
al-Bitar Hospital said 38 mostly Irish staff members would be
allowed out of the country. The group would include two Britons and
a Dane, said Gerry Fitzgerald of the Irish PARC company that runs
the hospital.
   It was not immediately known when that group would be allowed to
leave.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, in Paris with Bush, said
Baghdad's moves to free hostages gradually was an effort to chisel
away international solidarity against Iraq.
   ``Our answer is simply, `Sorry, it won't work,''' said Fitzwater
on Tuesday.
   On Thursday, Bush will spend thanksgiving in Dhahran, Saudi
Arabia, with U.S. troops deployed there. About 250,000 American
troops have been sent to the gulf in the biggest deployment since
the Vietnam war.
   It was to be the first visit by a U.S. president to front-line
troops since Richard Nixon went to Vietnam in 1969.
   Syrian troops are part of the multinational force massed against
Iraq.

<HEAD>Universal Reopens King Kong Portion of Studio Tour</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with two grafs to CLARIFY that the King Kong portion of
the tour was reopened and tour itself went back into operation the
day after the fire.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Universal Studios has reopened the
popular King Kong tour attraction for the first time since fire
ravaged the studio's back lot two weeks ago.
   The studio tour resumed operation the morning after the Nov. 6
blaze but the King Kong exhibit remained closed for inspection.
   The fire at Hollywood's biggest and longest-running movie
factory destroyed sets for several TV and movie productions,
including the ``Back to the Future'' movies, ``Dick Tracy'' and
``The Sting.'' Damage was put in the millions.
   A security guard, Michael J. Huston, 40, has been charged with
setting the blaze.
   In ceremonies Tuesday in front of the tour's 37-foot mechanical
King Kong, Universal officials presented silver film reel awards to
firefighters who battled the blaze, and donated 400 free tour
passes to a burn center.
   The fire didn't harm King Kong, one of the most popular draws on
the Universal tour, but the $6.5 million attraction was closed for
inspection. Visitors who take the tour also are treated to a
simulated earthquake.
   Universal said it will rebuild the sets with help from Steven
Spielberg, whose production headquarters are on the studio lot but
were not damaged.

<HEAD>Teen-Ager in Critical Condition After Clash with Army</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 13-year-old Palestinian boy was reported in
critical condition with a bullet wound in the head after a clash
with Israeli troops Wednesday in the occupied Gaza Strip.
   Arab reports said at least two other people were wounded in the
stone-throwing incident in the Shati refugee camp on the edge of
Gaza City.
   The army said it ws checking the report.
   The boy, Aouni el-Habib, was struck with a rubber-coated metal
pellet when troops opened fire after their patrol was stoned, camp
residents said.
   He was transferred from Shifa Hospital in Gaza City to Tel
Hashomer Hospital in Israel in critical condition, doctors said.
   In the Rafah refugee camp to the south, nine Palestinians were
reported wounded in a stone-throwing confrontation, Arab hospital
officials said.
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens told Jewish settlers in the
occupied West Bank that road security would continue to be
improved. Settlers have complained bitterly that their cars are
repeatedly stoned by Palestinians.
   Israel radio said the army has built 90 new security posts in
the occupied territories over the past six months to improve
settlers' security, at a cost of $9 million.
   About 70,000 Israelis have moved into settlements scattered in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, whre 1.7 million Palestinians live.
Israel captured the territories from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967
Middle East war.
   Arens, on a visit to settlers in the town of Hebron, said he
believed there has been an easing of the attacks that followed the
Oct. 8 killing by police of at least 17 Palestinians on the Temple
Mount.
   ``We plan to continue with the policy of guaranteeing security
for all those traveling the roads of the land,'' Arens pledged.

   Barbara Bush will see both the glories of
ancient Egypt and the problems of the nation today during a brief
tour of Cairo on Friday.
   President Hosni Mubarak's wife Suzanne will guide the American
first lady through the Egyptian Museum and to a children's library
founded by Mrs. Mubarak to give poor children a chance to better
their lives.
   ''We're proud as Egyptians of our ancient civilization, of our
past, but we're equally proud of our present,'' Mrs. Mubarak told
The Associated Press in an interview.
   ''And when people come to Egypt, we want them to see that
despite all the problems we've been facing in the last three
decades; despite wars, which many people tend to forget; despite
everything Egypt is progressing in every walk of life.''
   Mrs. Mubarak said she got the idea for one of her pet projects,
founding children's libraries in depressed areas, during a visit to
the United States.
   ''I'm so involved with libraries ... that when Egyptians hear
the word library, they automatically think I built it,'' she said.
   U.S. President George Bush and Mrs. Bush are scheduled to arrive
in Cairo Thursday night for an 18-hour stopover after spending
Thanksgiving day with American troops in Saudi Arabia.
   The first ladies' Friday morning schedule begins with a visit to
Cairo's Egyptian Museum, a block from the Nile River in the heart
of the city. Built at the end of last century, the two-story museum
houses 100,000 artifacts from thousands of years of ancient
Egyptian civilization. They will see the lavish golden collection
from the tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun.
   They will then go to a children's library, where the first
ladies are scheduled to read to the children.
   ''I knew Mrs. Bush has never had a chance to sit down and talk
with Egyptian children,'' Mrs. Mubarak said. ''Now we'll give her
the chance.''

<HEAD>CBS Announces New Series, NBC Brings Faith Daniels to Daytime</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A midday news show starring ``Today'' newscaster
Faith Daniels will replace ``Generations'' at NBC, and CBS is
putting in a new comedy,``You Take the Kids,'' the networks said
Wednesday.
   NBC, trying to bolster its third-place daytime lineup, said
seven other possible news-information series are in development,
including ``Women's Diaries'' with former NBC News star Linda
Ellerbee.
   Daniels, who will remain on ``Today,'' will be host of ``A
Closer Look,'' a half-hour NBC News series that examines social
issues. It will premiere on Jan. 28, succeeding ``Generations,''
which began in March 1989.
   ``Generations,'' which focused on two families, one black, the
other white, was third in its time period. NBC said it will explore
ways of keeping the NBC-made series in production for sale in
syndication.
   The series had improved but ``the ratings were not there,''
Brandon Tartikoff, chairman of the NBC Entertainment Group, told
NBC affiliates by closed-circuit television.
   CBS last week said it was axing ``The Hogan Family,'' an NBC
cast-off that it had picked up and put on its Saturday night
schedule this season.
   Its new sitcom, ``You Take The Kids,'' is part of its shuffle of
four TV family comedies to or from its Saturday schedule.
   CBS said Wednesday it was taking its new ``The Family Man'' off
the air after Dec. 1, but would bring it back next spring.
   CBS said it will return its new ``Lenny,' which began as a
Wednesday series, as a Saturday series, starting Dec. 15, when
``You Take the Kids'' premieres.
   The latter, which will begin CBS' new Saturday schedule, stars
Nell Carter of ``Gimme a Break'' and Roger E. Mosley of ``Magnum
P.I.'' as parents of a blue-collar family in Pittsburgh.

<HEAD>25 Injured in Anti-Government Riot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police using batons and tear gas on
Wednesday battled anti-government protesters who exploded crude
bombs and hurled rocks at cars. At least 25 people were injured,
opposition leaders said.
   Five people were arrested in central Dhaka, police said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Several vehicles were damaged by the stones and three cars,
including one belonging to the Japanese Embassy, were set afire,
they said.
   The clash began during a rally called to protest an assault on
the son of Khaleda Zia, the chief of Bangladesh Nationalist Party,
a main opposition groups campaigning for the government's ouster.
Three unidentified people raided Zia's house Tuesday and attacked
his son and two servants.
   At least 260 people were injured Tuesday in clashes during a
daylong nationwide general strike called by opposition parties to
press for President Hussain Muhammad Ershad's resignation, a demand
he has rejected.
   The shutdown was the seventh and the latest in the series of
strikes and demonstrations organized by the opposition since Oct.
10 under the anti-Ershad campaign.
   Ershad, a 60-year-old former army general, seized power in a
bloodless military coup in 1982. He quit the army after winning
presidential elections in 1986 that observers said were heavily
rigged.
   Ershad has promised to hold another presidential election in
1991, but the opposition has said it will boycott any balloting,
arguing the polls are certain to be rigged again.
   The opposition wants Ershad to hand over power to a caretaker
government until a new leadership can be chosen in an election.

   So what's the deal with Arnold Becker and
Roxanne? Will the sleazy-but-lovable divorce attorney and his
long-suffering secretary on the popular television series ``L.A.
Law'' ever get together?
   Susan Ruttan, who plays Roxanne, says she and co-star Corbin
Bernsen wonder, too.
   ``We fantasize that in the very last episode, in the very last
year, he'll look at Roxanne and say `Oh my gawd, it's been you all
along,''' Ruttan said this week on her own honeymoon.
   ``And she'll go `bleah!''
   Ruttan said ``L.A. Law'' fans see Roxanne as the ``eyes'' of the
show.
   ``She's with the audience saying `What is going on here?'''
Ruttan said. ``She's the one who sort of represents regular people,
not the people who are worrying about junk bond deals, but the
people who are wondering if someone will ever love them, like
everyone is.''
   Ruttan is visiting Honolulu with her husband of three weeks,
Hollywood sound technician and artist Randy McDonald.

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - The hard-rock band Jane's Addiction said
``artistic direction'' caused it to walk out during a concert, but
the show's promoter said band members didn't like the audience.
   When the four band members refused to return Monday night after
abruptly leaving the stage 40 minutes into their concert in
suburban Upper Darby, fans rushed outside and began throwing
bottles and stones and blocking traffic.
   Others rocked the band's bus in an unsuccessful attempt to turn
it over.
   It took more than 100 police officers to end the disturbance,
which lasted about an hour. Police said 23 people were charged with
disorderly conduct or drunkenness.
   ``Rather than compromise their artistic direction, it was the
feeling of the band that to play on would be infringement on their
music, their performance, and unfair to their many fans,'' the band
said Tuesday complaining about the sound and stage setup.
   But Jim Sutcliffe, a spokesman for Electric Factory Concerts,
said band leader ``Perry Farrell told our representative there he
didn't like the audience.''
   Electric Factory said it would send $5 to fans who mail in a
ticket stub showing they paid $15.50 for the sold-out show.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Jon Bon Jovi says he's worried that stardom is
wearing away at him.
   ``You know, I've written so many songs in the last ... eight
months that I've forgotten what the hell I've written,'' he said in
the Dec. 10 issue of US magazine.
   When a fan recently asked him to play ``Blood Money,'' a song
from his new solo album ``Blaze of Glory,'' Bon Jovi recalled, ``I
forgot the words. I've written, like, 25 songs since.''
   Bon Jovi, who married his high-school sweetheart and still lives
in his home state of New Jersey, says he's unsure if he's happy
with who he is today.
   ``I'm 28 years old. I'm president of a multimultimillion-dollar
corporation. I don't care,'' he said. ``I'd rather not have money
and be happy than have money and have the innocence taken away.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - Priscilla Presley says her 3-year-old son and
year-old granddaughter are being raised like brother and sister.
   The 46-year-old actress says she spoils her granddaughter,
Danielle, but ``I won't let her call me Grandma.''
   ``It has such an image and I don't want it,'' she said in an
interview in Woman's Day magazine.
   Priscilla's son, Navarone, was fathered by Marco Garibaldi, a
33-year-old Brazilian the actress has known for five years.
   Danielle's mother, 22-year-old Lisa Marie Keough is the child of
Priscilla's marriage to Elvis Presley, which ended in divorce in
1973.
   ``When she takes her baby home, mine cries,'' Presley said.
``She adores him and he adores her.''
   She said she is positive Elvis' death 13 years ago was not a
suicide and she calls the ``sightings'' and reports that he is
still alive ``ridiculous, another way for people to earn a buck.''

   SADDLE RIVER, N.J. (AP) - Former President Nixon sold his
seven-bedroom home for $2.4 million to a Japanese businessman last
week, a real estate agent said Wednesday.
   Nixon and former first lady Pat are moving to a three-bedroom
condominium in Park Ridge, about a mile from their home in northern
New Jersey. They decided the condominium would be less expensive to
maintain, a family spokesman said last spring.
   The home was placed on the market with a $3.25 million price tag
and was reduced to $2.9 million during the summer.
   Real estate broker Mary Lenk said a Japanese businessman
purchased the house but she would not further identify the buyer.
She didn't know whether it had been bought as a residence or as an
investment.
   The Nixons bought the house in Saddle River in 1981 for $1.25
million and made $300,000 in improvements, family spokesman John
Taylor said in April.

   In Connoisseur magazine's December issue, he said he studied the
scenery from a car for the 1987 painting ``Fast Lane,'' which
depicts a dead squirrel on the road in front of the house.
   ``I was sitting there one winter's day when I noticed this light

   ``I told him I wanted to make a drawing. He said, `What you

   ``I said, `I hate to tell you, but I am.'
   ``No!'' he yelled. `Now, stay riht there and sign this paper
for my wife, and you can stay where you are.'''
   The artist also said that Helga Testorf, the model for his
``Helga'' collection, still comes to his studio.
   ``I've never felt I've come to an end with any subject,'' said
Wyeth.

   Tens of thousands of Texans living along the
Rio Grande are still using pit privies and some must travel up to
30 miles just for a jug of fresh water, according to a
congressional study released Wednesday.
   A General Accounting Office study of six border counties in
Texas found 198,000 people are living in 842 colonias -
unincorporated, rural subdivisions with frequently substandard
housing, inadequate roads, a lack of running water or adequate
sewage systems.
   Sixty percent of the colonias surveyed have water supplies but
less than 1 percent - a total of three - have public sewage
disposal systems, said GAO, the investigative arm of Congress.
   ``I'm very concerned that the lack of proper waste systems for
these colonias poses a growing health risk to residents and their
children. It's also contributing to environmental problems along
the border,'' said Rep. Kika de la Garza, D-Mission, who requested
the study.
   De la Garza, the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee,
said the study ``substantiates the need to continue and strengthen
our efforts to bring adequate water and sewer facilities to the
hundreds of thousands of colonia residents along the Texas-Mexico
border.''
   The six counties surveyed - El Paso, Webb, Starr, Hidalgo,
Willacy and Cameron - represent 91 percent of Texas colonias
residents, GAO said. An earlier study by the Congressional Research
Service found 10,850 people were living in 61 colonias in the
state's other 10 border counties in 1987.
   The GAO also found 14,600 people were living in 15 colonias in
New Mexico's Dona Ana County. Twelve had access to public water and
only one had access to a public sewer.
   Although a colonia may have a water system, residents do not
necessarily have running water, the GAO said.
   ``In some Texas colonias, residents have only outside water
spigots to provide water and do not have indoor plumbing. Sometimes
residents have not hooked up to the water system because they
cannot afford the user fees,'' the study said. And local officials
believe most of the on-site sewage systems used in colonias are
substandard.
   ``Some residents travel as far as 25 to 30 miles to any of three
county owned water spigots to fill their water containers,'' GAO
said. ``Pit privies are the primary method of sewage disposal for
Webb County colonias.''
   Texas voters last year authorized $100 million to fund water and
sewer projects in counties with economically distressed areas and
in all border counties with colonias. De la Garza also included in
the 1990 Farm Bill a $60 million program to make loans and grants
to help bring water and sewage systems to colonias, and to hook
homes to those systems. Congress must still authorize the funding.

   A plane carrying at least 37 people to
a southern resort island crashed during heavy rain today, and
police said all aboard were killed.
   The rain apparently caused the Bangkok Airways turboprop to
crash into a coconut grove short of the airport on Koh Samui
island, said Pitipong Kansan, the island's police chief.
   Police spokesman Prateep Pakdeepol said the flight from Bangkok
was carrying four crew members and 33 passengers, almost all
foreign tourists and one infant. He said the bodies were badly
burned.
   In Bangkok, Prasert Prasarthongsot, the president of Bangkok
Airways, said 38 people were aboard - 33 passengers and five crew
members.
   The passenger manifest listed 30 foreigners and three Thai
passengers. It gave no breakdown of the foreigners by nationality.
   Among the foreigners were five Japanese, said a first secretary
of the Japanese Embassy, Hiroshi Enomata.
   Passanee Thongsuk, a hotel receptionist, said she saw the plane
crash.
   Passanee said she was watching the sky because her hotel was
expecting some of the tourists aboard the plane to check in.
   ``I saw the plane slowly heading down,'' she said. ``A few
seconds later, I saw a big fire and smoke. I was shocked and I knew
the plane had crashed. There was a loud explosion.''
   ``It came down between some houses near the main road,'' she
said. ``The people living there were very lucky to escape.''
   Dr. Suvit Nantapanich, the director of an island hospital, said
the bodies would be put on a ferry to the mainland, then flown to
Bangkok on Thursday.
   The 50-minute flights from Bangkok usually are packed with
foreign tourists heading to the beaches of the island on the Gulf
of Thailand, 300 miles south of Bangkok.
   An aviation official in Bangkok said the plane was a Dash 8
model that can carry about three dozen passengers.
   The storm churned up 10-foot waves off southern Thailand, and
more than 20 boats sank, said an editor at the mass circulation
daily Thai Rath. The editor, speaking on condition of anonymity,
did not have further details.

   Europe's leaders Wednesday pledged to replace the
Cold War with an era of peace and unity, but left unresolved
several bitter disputes.
   The final document of the 34-nation summit made no mention, for
example, of the three Baltic republics, which were excluded from
the three-day conference despite strenuous lobbying efforts.
   It skirted the issue of Cyprus, which remains divided. Unlike
Eastern Europe, the foreign army occupying part of Cyprus -
Turkey's - is not in the process of withdrawing.
   Yugoslav President Borisav Jovic, in his address to the summit,
spoke of the need to improve the status of national minorities. But
he made no reference to the mounting ethnic division that threatens
his own federation.
   The foreign ministers of the three Baltic republics - Estonia,
Latvia and Lithuania - protested in vain against the Soviet Union's
move to exclude them from the summit deliberations.
   Soviet officials sought to defuse the complaints, saying the
three breakaway republics were welcome to join its delegation. But
several Western European leaders spoke in sympathy with the
Baltics, making clear this issue will remain one of Europe's few
enduring international disputes.
   While barriers fell this year between the former West and East
Germanys, citizens in Cyprus' capital of Nicosia still cannot pass
from one side of the city to another.
   Turkey invaded in 1974 in the wake of a Greek Cypriot coup
attempt, and established what it now calls the Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus. United Nations resolutions have called for the
withdrawal of the 25,000 Turkish troops that occupy 39 percent of
the country.
   ``There exists, in Europe itself, a conflict that I cannot let
pass in silence: that of Cyprus,'' U.N. Secretary General Javier
Perez de Cuellar said in his speech to the summit Monday.
   Cyprus and Turkey were the only countries at the summit which
remain avowed enemies. At a luncheon Monday, Cypriot President
George Vassiliou sat facing his nemesis, Turkish President Turgut
Ozal.
   ``I said to him, `We must solve the Cyprus problem.' He said,
`Yes, we must.' That was it,'' Vassiliou told reporters.
   In Yugoslavia, the northernmost republic of Slovenia is at
loggerheads with Serbia, the largest republic. Serbia, the tiny
fellow republic of Montenegro and still-Stalinist Albania are the
only European states that have not yet held free elections.
   Serbia and Montenegro plan elections on Dec. 9, while Albania,
where the ruling Communists still dominate, is due for a vote in
February.
   Albania, restricted to non-voting status at the three-day
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, objected to its
continuing exclusion from a forum open to every other state on the
continent.
   ``It is surprising and indeed incomprehensible that some states
did not grant the consensus for Albania's full participation,'' its
delegation said in a statement. ``It seems this attitude stems from
reminiscences about the past.''

   New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo says President
Bush should negotiate an end to the Persian Gulf standoff and send
U.S. forces into war against Iraq only as a last resort.
   Cuomo, addressing a Jewish service group, said the United States
may have to soften its demands for bringing an end to the Iraqi
occupation of Kuwait.
   ``You could negotiate something that gets (the Iraqis) out of
Kuwait for the most part, leaves them maybe a little bit on the
water, leaves them a little bit of the oil, and then puts in a
United Nations task force to go over the whole question of chemical
weapons ... and this movement toward nuclear capacity,'' Cuomo said
Monday night.
   President Bush has rejected direct talks with Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein.
   Cuomo is considered a possible candidate for the 1992 Democratic
nomination for president.

<TEXT>
   An AIDS patient received a government-approved
shipment of marijuana Wednesday to help ease the pain of his
disease, a private group said.
   ``I have a lot to be thankful for this Thanksgiving,'' the
34-year-old Virginia man said in a statement released by the
Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics, which helped him present his
case.
   The man, identified by ACT only as ``Danny,'' is the second AIDS
patient in the United States to receive marijuana approved by the
Food and Drug Administration.
   An FDA spokeswoman confirmed the agency gave approval Tuesday
for someone to use marijuana.
   ACT quoted Danny as saying the drug ``helps me cope with this
terrible disease.''
   Marijuana reduced the patient's nausea, vomiting and weight-loss
caused by the AIDS virus and restored his appetite, said the group,
which favors making marijuana available legally for medical uses.
   The FDA has allowed marijuana use by patients for compassionate
purposes in at least two dozen instances since 1976.
   ACT's president, Robert Randall, a glaucoma patient, was the
first to win FDA approval.
   ``Marijuana's use is widespread and rapidly growing among AIDS
patients,'' and Danny's case will encourage them to demand an end
to its ban in medicine, Randall said.
   Marijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug by the Drug
Enforcement Administration, making it available only for research.
DEA administrators for more than 14 years have rejected bids to
make marijuana available to medical patients.
   In 1988, an administrative law judge recommended that DEA make
marijuana available by prescription for the treatment of life- and
sense-threatening diseases. The DEA administrator rejected the
recommendation.
   Advocates are appealing that decision to the U.S. Court of
Appeals in Washington, D.C.
   The government-supplied drug, in cigarette form, came from a
pharmacy in northern Virginia, ACT said.

<TEXT>
   A 270-year-old Stradivarius violin named after the
descendants of composer Felix Mendelssohn sold Wednesday for $1.76
million, the highest price paid at auction for a musical
instrument, Christie's said.
   The violin, known as The Mendelssohn, was purchased by a private
buyer in the salesroom who asked not to be identified.
   ``It was owned by an American collector for the past 35 years
and he probably played it a bit,'' said William Hanham, the
auctioneers' spokesman.
   ``The fact that it had been off the market for a long time was a
considerable help to the price,'' he added. ``We believe that more
expensive instruments have been sold privately.''
   The previous owner, who remained anonymous, sold the violin to
aid the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of
New York.
   Antonio Stradivari made the violin in Cremona, Italy, in 1720
toward the end of his ``golden period'' when he produced his finest
instruments. The greatest ones are usually given personal names.
   The violin was named after its owners in the 19th century, the
Mendelssohn family of Berlin.
   The previous musical instrument auction record was $1.22 million
for a Stradivarius cello in 1988.
   The same year, a Baron Heath violin made in 1743 by Giuseppe
Guarnieri fetched $1.12 million at auction.

<HEAD>Miami Beach To Report All Drug Arrests to Employers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Support for an all-out war on drugs
prevailed over concern for civil liberties as the city commission
Wednesday approved an ordinance requiring police to report drug
arrests to employers.
   ``Drug users would get a very, very powerful lesson that they
cannot use drugs with impunity,'' said University of Miami
President Tad Foote.
   Foote, chairman of the Miami Coalition for a Drug-Free
Community, said the ordinance will make Miami Beach a leader in the
fight against drugs. Supporters and opponents believe the ordinance
to be the first of its kind in the nation.
   The American Civil Liberties Union opposed the bill, and
commissioners agreed to seek a court opinion on the measure's
constitutionality before any letters go out. The commission
approved the first reading, 5-2, and set final review for Dec. 19.
   Supporters in Wednesday's debate focused on the need to show the
determination of the city - which accounts for 40 percent of Dade
County drug arrests - to fight drugs and related violent crime.
   Opponents worried about the legality of notification based
solely on an arrest, and the potential legal costs of defending the
ordinance.
   ``I know in my heart that the employer is going to take that
letter and probably fire the individual,'' said Mayor Alex Daoud,
who voted against the measure.
   ``It's not right, it doesn't feel right, it's not correct.''
   He also questioned why the ordinance was limited to drug
arrests, and did not include drunken driving, rape or other crimes.
   But leaders of the Miami Coalition contended the notification
letter would safeguard the rights of employees by warning employers
against taking any punitive action. A draft version of the letter
recommends that employers respond with drug counseling or
rehabilitation.
   Supporters included educators; physicians; the local heads of
the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, Customs Service and
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; and businessmen and
residents victimized by drug-related crimes.
   The opposition was led by the ACLU, which charged the ordinance
would violate due process and privacy rights, and the Miami Beach
taxpayers association, which said the letters would hurt employees
for life.
   ``A user who gets fired is no longer just a user,'' said
association spokesman Harley Willner. ``He's a loser because he's
got no other means of support.''
   Dorian Jones, a clothing store owner who said he's been arrested
three times but has never been convicted of a crime, asked, ``Since
when are we putting so much trust in government officials and
police?''
   But hotel manager Don Meginley expressed the sentiment of the
audience's majority.
   ``We've had it. This is not an end-all, cure-all for drug use on
Miami Beach, but it's a start,'' he said.
   Commissioner Bruce Singer acknowledged the issue will wind up in
court, but said, ``The costs of human lives far outweigh the cost
of defending or determining whether the ordinance is legal.''
   Commissioner Abe Resnick added, ``We have an all-out war, and we
have to defend ourselves.''

<TEXT>
   The State Department reacted sharply Wednesday
to a military campaign launched by leftist rebels in El Salvador
and left open the possibility of increasing military aid to the
Salvadoran armed forces.
   Deputy spokesman Richard Boucher strongly condemned the military
campaign by the FMLN rebels, accusing the insurgents of violating a
commitment not to undertake military attacks that affect the
civilian population.
   He said seven civilians were killed and 67 wounded.
   Americas Watch, a private human rights group, said the rebels
have been responsible for only a small percentage of the civilian
deaths in El Salvador over the years. Ann Manuel, an associate at
Americas Watch, said the ``vast majority'' of the estimated 40,000
civilian killings have been the work of government forces and
rightist death squads.
   An FMLN statement said Tuesday's attacks were aimed at inducing
the government to return to the negotiating table.
   Under legislation approved last month, Congress cut military aid
to El Salvador to $42.5 million - half the administration's
request. President Bush had objected strongly to the congressional
action.
   The legislation would allow the cut aid to be restored if the
rebels launched a military offensive that threatens the government.
Boucher said that provision of the legislation was being reviewed
in light of Tuesday's attacks.
   The attacks, he said, did not appear to pose a threat to the
government's survival.
   Other officials said preliminary consultations had begun with
the staff of the chief sponsor of the legislation, Sen. Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn. Dodd was out of the city Wednesday.
   The administration had argued forcefully against the aid
cutback, contending it didn't contain sufficient incentives for the
FMLN to agree to a cease-fire and to negotiate a settlement to
their 10-year war with the governent.
   Proponents of the cutback saw it as an inducement for the
government to meet the rebels half way in peace talks that began
earlier this year. Five rounds have been held since May.
   An additional stipulation of the legislation is that all
military aid to the armed forces would be cut off if the government
refused to negotiate in good faith.
   Boucher said the government has made a number of concessions
during the peace talks.
   Among other things, he said the government has offered to
transfer police forces to civilian control, abolish civil defense
units at the beginning of a cease-fire and disband immediate
reaction battalions. It also is committed to reducing the size of
the armed forces by three-fourths when a final settlement is
reached, he said.
   Boucher accused the FMLN of cynicism by describing the attacks
as a ``limited national campaign undertaken in the spirit of
accelerating the negotiating process.''
   ``Once again, the FMLN is talking about peace settlement, while
raining violence and death on El Salvador's citizens. The FMLN has
repeatedly stalled the negotiating process over the past four
months, and now claims to be seeking to accelerating it,'' Boucher
said.
   He said a U.S. military helicopter was struck by gunfire during
the attack. One crewman suffered minor injuries from broken glass
but the helicopter returned safely to its base.

   Strict security arrangements for President
Bush's Thanksgiving Day visit to Saudi Arabia are being kept top
secret.
   In Saudi Arabia, the Army unit with whom he will have
Thanksgiving dinner has not been announced. The Navy ship where he
will attend a Thanksgiving service has not been named, nor have the
Marine and Seabee units he will greet.
   With 230,000 American troops presently in Saudi Arabia,
terrorist plotters would have a hard time guessing exactly where
Bush will be, even if they penetrated the Saudis' tough security
and strict control of entry of foreigners.
   Bush and his delegation plan to leave Saudi Arabia for Cairo on
Thursday evening.
   In Egypt, government sources say security for Bush's visit Nov.
22-23 will be under the joint responsibility of Egyptian
intelligence and the U.S. Secret Service. Some 800 American
security officers are expected to protect Bush during his 19-hour
stop in Cairo.
   They include divers who will patrol the murky green waters of
the Nile River.
   U.S. spokesmen in Saudi Arabia and Egypt refused to give details
on security measures for Bush's visit.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A few staff members returned to work at United
Press International's headquarters Wednesday, two days after a
cave-in at an adjacent construction site forced them to evacuate to
temporary quarters.
   Police continued to detour motorists around the area, snarling
downtown traffic. District of Columbia building inspectors said the
site was stabilized early Wednesday.
   ``We're not fully functional yet, and not all our phones are up,
but we're doing what we have to do out of here,'' Washington bureau
chief Berl Schwartz said. ``Things aren't normal, but we're getting
the job done.''
   Schwartz said ``only a few'' staffers were in the headquarters
Wednesday, with the remainder scattered between press galleries at
the U.S. Capitol and the wire service's computer headquarters in
Vienna, Va.
   ``Our concern right now is that we don't want to get a lot of
people and computers in here and generate the power surge that will
knock out electricity in the whole area,'' Schwartz said. ``Our
best guess is that we will return to normal operations Friday.''
   In the interim, UPI will continue operating part of its radio
network through National Public Radio headquarters in the nation's
capital, Schwartz said. Reuters will also continue transmitting
UPI's news photos.
   Steve Arabia, spokesman for Potomac Electric Power Co., said the
situation in the area was ``tenuous,'' with only one of the normal
seven power cables in the area operational.
   ``We've re-routed service to some buildings and tried to isolate
the area,'' Arabia said.
   Crews will be working in the area for days, he added.
   No one was injured in Monday's cave-in at the half-square-block
construction site.
   The sudden collapse swallowed several construction trailers, a
large construction crane, part of an adjoining alley and several
light poles.
   At least 50 trucks dumped dirt in the hole Tuesday as engineers
tried to reinforce the collapsed wall to prevent further erosion.
   However, 100 feet of a wooden walkway, the sidewalk and part of
the adjoining street - H Street near the corner of 14th Street -
fell into the hole Tuesday.
   The evacuation was another setback for workers at UPI, who voted
last week to accept a 90-day 35 percent pay cut the company said
was needed to help find a buyer to rescue the financially-ailing
wire service.

   The creators of ABC-TV's ``The Wonder
Years,'' husband and wife team Neal Marlens and Carol Black, signed
an exclusive deal to create movies and television shows for Walt
Disney Studios.
   The deal, announced Tuesday by Disney, calls for them to be
involved in a wide range of projects for four years, said Disney
spokesman Marian Effinger.
   The financial terms of the agreement weren't released. Reports
earlier this fall estimated they would be paid at least $15 million
by Disney.
   Marlens and Black bring to the deal a commitment by ABC to pick
up three series.
   In addition to creating, writing and producing ``The Wonder
Years'' and co-producing the movie ``Soul Man'' for New World
Entertainment, they wrote and produced the TV show ``Growing
Pains.''

   A seventh death has been linked to
Florida's outbreak of St. Louis encephalitis, an official said
Wednesday.
   The 79-year-old Hillsborough County man died Nov. 7, said David
Adams, spokesman for the state Department of Health and
Rehabilitative Services.
   The first death, reported in late October, was that of a
58-year-old Brevard County woman. The outbreak began in mid-August
and has since spread to 27 counties.
   As of Wednesday, 128 confirmed cases of the mosquito-borne
disease had been reported statewide. There also were 56 presumed
cases, meaning the people had tested positive in the first of two
tests needed to verify the disease.

<HEAD>Child Abuse Charges Against Chuck Berry Dropped</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By R.B. FALLSTROM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ST. CHARLES, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pioneer rock star Chuck Berry said
Wednesday he's eager to resume performing and recording now that
charges of child abuse against him have been dropped.
   ``I feel fantastic, because I hope and believe that the
clearance will be as prominently exposed as the allegation,'' Berry
told reporters at his lawyer's office. ``And therefore I can go on
with my life.''
   The 63-year-old rock 'n' roll legend - whose early hits include
``Johnny B. Goode,'' ``Roll Over Beethoven'' and ``Sweet Little
Sixteen'' - agreed to serve two years of unsupervised probation on
a marijuana charge as part of a plea agreement reached Tuesday.
   Berry maintained that the marijuana found during a raid of his
home was not his but he would accept probation - ``parole'' he
called it - on a misdemeanor charge.
   ``You want your hands wrung of everything, but I can do 10 years
parole,'' Berry said.
   Berry said the child abuse charges damaged his career. Since his
150-acre rural estate was raided in June he said promoters have
shied away and he has done only three concerts. Last year in the
same six-month period he said he did 30 concerts.
   Berry said he has one concert booked in March. He also resumed
recording Tuesday on an album that he has been working on for four
years.
   In the plea agreement, Berry dropped his civil-rights violation
suit against St. Charles County Prosecutor William Hannah that had
stemmed from the raid.
   Hannah said: ``Mr. Berry's level of accountability for the
criminal activities that we can prove is properly reflected in this
plea agreement.''
   The status of an unspecified number of lawsuits related to the
case was unclear. Berry and his lawyer, Wayne Schoeneberg, said
other legal action would be forthcoming but refused to comment
further.
   Berry maintained that somebody was out to get him.
   ``Oh yes, of course,'' he said. ``Or else this wouldn't have all
come up. I'm not a bad boy.
   ``The curtain is just rising on these other allegations.''
   Berry was charged July 19 after drug agents searched his estate
near Wentzville, about 40 miles west of St. Louis, at Hannah's
direction.
   The original felony charges accused him of possession of more
than 35 grams of marijuana. Three charges of child abuse alleged
that Berry made nude films of youths under age 17 for sexual
gratification.
   Authorities said the raid turned up several plastic bags of
marijuana, some hashish, two .22-caliber rifles and a shotgun, plus
$122,000 and various pornographic videotapes, slides and books.
   The raid came after an informant told authorities that Berry had
received a large amount of cocaine and would have it at his home
for 10 days. Police found no cocaine.
   Berry said Wednesday he was contributing $5,000 to drug and
alcohol education and rehabilitation programs. ``It's not the first
one and it won't be the last contribution,'' he said.
   Schoeneberg said the tape that brought the child abuse charges
was phony. ``Somebody had slipped that videotape into evidence
seized at his property,'' Schoeneberg said.
   Berry had been free on $20,000 bond.

<HEAD>Five Votes for Five Candidates Tie Up County Race</HEAD>

   County commissioners knew they had a
problem when four people each got one write-in vote for a seat on a
newly created commission. Things got worse when they took another
look.
   Now they have a five-way tie.
   ``Democracy has its quirks, I guess,'' Greenfield Town Manager
Norman Thidemann said Wednesday. ``We had five write-ins for a seat
where there wasn't even a candidate to begin with.''
   The race in question is a relatively low-profile spot on the
Franklin County Charter Commission, a new group that will start
work on revamping the structure of county government. The 14 other
seats were filled quietly enough, but no one ran for the District 3
seat on the Nov. 6 ballot.
   On Tuesday, county election officials met to try to break the
four-way tie by looking at escrow votes, ballots that were cast
Nov. 6 but were set aside after being challenged because voters'
names could not be found on current lists.
   Of 23 escrow ballots, five were determined to be valid because
the voters had registered in the past.
   But the only thing the new ballots yielded was one write-in vote
for yet another candidate.
   County Administrator Jay DiPucchio said he plans to ask the
write-in winners next week if any of them want the job. From there,
the county may decide whether to hold a special election to fill
the seat, or the seated members of the commission may appoint
someone, he said.
   ``It's no big deal,'' he said.
   One of the write-in winners is assured a seat regardless of what
happens. In addition to his write-in nod for District 3, Charles
McCarthy was elected to the charter commission as an at-large
candidate.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's supporters have
tried to play the Iraqi card in the Conservative Party's leadership
struggle, but her opponent has said he would not change her firm
policy in the Persian Gulf.
   Michael Heseltine, who is challenging Mrs. Thatcher for
leadership of the Conservative Party, has called Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein ``a destructive loser.'' He has said that war in the
gulf is both ``possible and justifiable.''
   ``Heseltine's views on the gulf are a carbon copy of Mrs.
Thatcher's,'' said Jack Spence, a professor of politics at
Leicester University. ``When it comes to the crisis, it's `business
as usual' under Heseltine.''
   As Mrs. Thatcher's defense minister from 1983 to 1986, Heseltine
defended her conduct of the Falklands War with Argentina and
supported the controversial deployment of cruise missiles. He also
backed development of former President Reagan's ``Star Wars''
program.
   ``He's every bit as strong on defense as Mrs. Thatcher,'' said
Peter Jenkins, a leading political writer and commentator.
   ``Here is a guy who ... is a patriot on defense, who is solidly
pro-NATO, who saw off the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament during
his time as defense secretary. And he is solid on the gulf.''
   What Heseltine will not have is Mrs. Thatcher's stature of more
than a decade as a prominent world leader and reliable ally of the
United States.
   However, Jenkins said, Heseltine ``is a very satisfactory mix as
far as the United States is concerned: strong on defense but also
pro-Europe. President Bush has made it clear that he likes this
configuration.''
   Defense Secretary Tom King has come closest to playing the Iraqi
card against Heseltine. Before Heseltine announced his candidacy,
King linked any fight over the leadership with an upcoming visit to
British troops in the gulf.
   ``If at this moment we had a contest, what am I to say to the
troops I am going to see in the next days about the fact that `the
whole country is behind you'?'' The Times of London quoted King as
saying.
   A few days later, with Heseltine in the race and King in Saudi
Arabia, the defense minister emphasized that the Conservative Party
was united on policy toward Iraq.
   When Heseltine became defense secretary in 1983, the euphoria of
Britain's victory in the Falklands had faded and critics were
begining to demand answers about the government's conduct of the
war.
   Heseltine took them on with the straightforward, sometimes
aggressive, style that has become his trademark.
   Taxed in Parliament about Britain's sinking of the Argentine
cruiser Belgrano, with the loss of 368 lives, Heseltine argued that
it had been in Britain's strategic and political interests.
   Heseltine actively pursued Mrs. Thatcher's insistence of a
strong NATO alliance confronting the former Soviet bloc in Europe.
   Under his guidance, Britain was one of the first NATO allies to
deploy U.S. cruise and Pershing missiles on its territory.
   He apparently relished confrontations with demonstrators outside
the missile bases in Britain, accusing them of ``ruthlessly playing
on the fears of the civilian population.''
   On Dec. 7, 1985, Britain became the first U.S. ally to sign an
agreement to participate in Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative,
also known as ``Star Wars.''
   Heseltine rounded on critics who accused him of warmongering,
arguing that SDI ``is not about war but prevention of war.''
   A month later, Heseltine resigned from the Cabinet in a row with
Mrs. Thatcher about the takeover of an ailing defense contractor.
Heseltine favored a European buyer, Mrs. Thatcher backed an
American.
   Spence said a Heseltine administration was likely to continue
Mrs. Thatcher's uncompromising line on defense as a matter of
conviction and to win the support of the party's right wing.
   ``His first priority will be unity and the gulf crisis is a
great rallying point, which he will play for all it is worth,''
Spence said.

<HEAD>Oilseeds Could Keep Bloom On Farm Profits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP BRASHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sunflowers and other oilseed crops, which
disappeared from much of the northern Plains during the 1980s, may
blossom again as a result of a last-minute change in the 1990 farm
bill.
   The new provision tucked into the farm bill also could take some
of the sting out of the drastic cuts in government subsidies that
wheat growers face over the next five years.
   The government will pay farmers to refrain from planting wheat
and other subsidized crops and allow them to keep the profits from
growing sunflowers, safflowers, canola and other minor oilseeds on
their land.
   The provision could prove to be a real moneymaker for those
willing to risk investment in a new crop and the four oilseed
crushing plants in North Dakota and Minnesota.
   Farmers ``may find that they can recoup at least some of what
they're losing in federal benefits from the market place,'' said
John Gordley, a lobbyist for the National Sunflower Association and
U.S. Canola Association.
   Some worry that a burst of new production could depress oilseed
prices the way wheat prices have been hurt by bumper crops
worldwide this year.
   Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., slipped the provision into the farm
bill during 11th-hour negotiations in October, Gordley said.
   The ``0-92'' provision encourages wheat farmers to plant
sunflowers or other oilseeds other than soybeans by guaranteeing
them 92 percent of their usual government payment.
   Farmers also can experiment with oilseeds by planting them on
the 15 percent of their land that will no longer be eligible for
government subsidies under the new farm bill.
   If the legislation works as intended, the sunflower industry
hopes to double production over the next five years.
   The industry hit hard times in the mid-1980s as farmers switched
to subsidized crops and foreign countries stepped up exports of
cheap, subsidized vegetable oils.
   U.S. sunflower production fell from 5.5 million acres in the
early 1980s to 1.4 million acres this year.
   An oilseed crushing plant at Velva, N.D., is in mothballs. A
second plant, at Enderlin, N.D., went through bankruptcy and is
operating at well under capacity, as are two other plants at Fargo
and Red Wing, Minn.
   ``We've lost so much production the last several years that we
need a good healthy increase,'' said Larry Kleingartner, executive
director of the sunflower association.
   ``There's a lot of uncertainty right now,'' said Guy
Christensen, vice president of the National Sun Industries plant at
Enderlin. ``Certainly it's going to have a positive impact on
production.''

   A defiant Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher took
the offensive Wednesday against her most serious political
challenge since taking office, dismissing her campaign manager and
hustling votes in the House of Commons.
   ``I fight on. I fight to win,'' Mrs. Thatcher declared following
a meeting with leaders of the ruling Conservative Party. Some
fellow Conservatives have urged her to step down rather than
prolong party strife.
   Former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine, however, claimed
support was flowing his way and said he could beat Mrs. Thatcher in
next Tuesday's vote among party members in the House of Commons.
Also, some opinion polls have suggested voters desire a change in
leadership.
   Heseltine forced a second ballot Tuesday by winning 152 votes of
the party's 372 House of Commons lawmakers. Mrs. Thatcher won 204
votes, four votes short of the margin needed to stop the challenge.
Sixteen lawmakers abstained.
   ``Last night, colleagues were indicating that having supported
her once, the situation is now such that the change is now
necessary and they will be switching their vote,'' Heseltine said
in an interview with British Broadcasting Corp. radio.
   Some Conservative lawmakers who voted for the prime minister on
Tuesday warned that they would back Heseltine next time, but other
legislators cheered on Mrs. Thatcher, who took office in 1979.
   Mrs. Thatcher departed early from a 34-nation summit on European
security in Paris on Wednesday.
   Later, she replaced her soft-spoken campaign manager, George
Younger, and made a rare appearance in the Commons tearoom to lobby
for support.
   She replaced Younger with Energy Secretary John Wakeham.
   Mrs. Thatcher's determination to fight discouraged speculation
that Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd or Chancellor of the Exchequer
John Major would step forward as a ``stop-Heseltine'' candidate.
   Both men signed Mrs. Thatcher's nomination papers for the second
round.
   ``Some Tories have said to her: `Look, this is too awful and we
would entirely understand if you were to walk away from it,'''
former party chairman Norman Tebbit told Independent Television
News.
   ``It was very clear that there was no better candidate,'' he
said.
   But other Conservative lawmakers regretted Mrs. Thatcher's
stubbornness.
   ``I think it is the wrong decision to have made - it will mean
that we have a further week of bloodletting,'' said Nicholas
Soames, grandson of Sir Winston Churchill.
   ``It would help to clear the air more than if it were left to
the two to slug it out at the OK Corral next Tuesday,'' said Sir
Geoffrey Johnson Smith, vice chairman of the committee that
oversees the leadership votes.
   Mrs. Thatcher spent more than an hour in the House of Commons on
Wednesday, reporting on the summit and fielding questions.
   Although appearing tired, she bristled when an opposition
lawmaker suggested she was in ``the twilight days'' of power.
   ``The first 11{ years haven't been so bad and with regard to
twilight, please remember there are 24 hours in the day,'' she told
Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats.
   On Thursday, she is expected to lead the government in a debate
on the opposition Labor Party's motion of no confidence. If it
carried, it would bring down the government, but Heseltine said
Conservatives would stick together to defeat the motion and seek to
oust Mrs. Thatcher next Tuesday.
   Both Mrs. Thatcher, 65, and Heseltine submitted their ballots
for next Tuesday's second ballot, in which the winner needs a
simple majority, or 187 votes if everyone participates. If neither
wins, a third ballot will be necessary Nov. 29.
   Heseltine criticized Mrs. Thatcher's independent style, and her
brief consultations before deciding to challenge in the second
round.
   ``We're talking about whether the Cabinet has a role in the way
the government is run,'' said Heseltine, who resigned as her
defense secretary in 1986.
   Speculation raged about the trend of Tory sentiment.
   ``The information is that something like 30 or 40 people who
voted (for Mrs. Thatcher) yesterday out of loyalty are now very
doubtful whether this ought to go on,'' said Sir Gerard Vaughan.
   Thatcher loyalist Nicholas Ridley responded: ``I'll give you
another rumor, that quite a lot of people who voted for Mr.
Heseltine are going to swing back to her.''
   The longest-serving prime minister in Europe, Mrs. Thatcher has
led the Conservatives to an unprecedented three straight victories
in national elections.
   But the party must call another by mid-1992 and the party
challenge largely grew out of worries that it might lose.
   The Tories, who have trailed Labor for 16 months in voter
opinion polls, have been beset by troubles such as strong reaction
against a new per-capita tax, defeats in special Parliamentary
elections and continued struggles over Britain's role in Europe.
   Heseltine, 57, also has criticized Mrs. Thatcher's reluctance to
fully integrate Britain into the European Community.
   Heseltine has also promised to review the new per capita tax,
which sparked anti-Tory riots in London and elsewhere this year.

<TEXT>
   The first of a string of Central American
``peace parks'' intended to save critical wilderness areas and end
decades-old border disputes has been launched in Costa Rica and
Panama, officials said Wednesday.
   The park has been established in the misty mountains of the La
Amistad Biosphere Reserve, which includes the largest tract of
undisturbed cloud forest in Central America.
   The reserve straddles the border of Costa Rica and Panama. As
many as 40 percent of its plants and animals are found nowhere else
on Earth.
   So far, 115 fish species, 215 reptiles and amphibians and at
least 500 bird species have been found there.
   Similar parks are on the drawing board for a forest that
overlaps the border of Belize and Guatemala and for the Maya
Biosphere Reserve that includes parts of Mexico and Guatemala.
   A third is planned for an area along the Costa Rica-Nicaragua
border, said James Nations, director of the Latin American program
of Conservation International, a private environmental organization
in Washington, D.C.
   ``The idea is to defuse the border conflict by creating an
international peace park in an area that was formerly the haunt of
the Contras,'' said Nations.
   ``What we're doing is looking for regional solutions to regional
problems.''
   Central America has more different species of plants and animals
than any comparably sized region on Earth, according to
Conservation International. It is one-eighteenth the size of the
United States, but has just as many plant species and twice as many
vertebrates.
   Nations said Conservation International and the Organization of
American States have just completed a management plan for the Costa
Rican side of the peace park.
   The plan specifies steps that must be taken to protect the park,
including projects to improve the well-being of the park's
residents.
   ``If you allow those people to produce the income they need,
they won't need to move across the hillsides destroying the
tropical forests their lives depend on.''
   ``It is the first time the original residents of the region are
being treated as equals in deciding how land and resources will be
managed,'' said Hernan Seguro, a Bribri Indian and a representative
to the park's coordinating commission.
   The proposed peace park along the Guatemala-Belize border
exemplifies the importance of international cooperation in
preserving ecosystems, he said.
   The border is criss-crossed by the Chiquibul River, which begins
in Belize, runs through Guatemala and then dumps into Belize's San
Ignacio Valley, an agricultural area that supplies most of Belize's
food.
   ``What happens to that river when it's in Guatemala is vitally
important to Belize,'' he said. ``If you can get the two countries
talking to protect that forest, you've done something positive for
both countries.''

<HEAD>Vietnamese Who Burned Himself to Death Repeatedly Threatened to Do
So</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Vietnamese-born newspaper publisher
had threatened so many times to burn himself to death in front of
the U.S. Capitol that friends no longer believed he would do it.
   Nguyen Kim Bang set himself ablaze Monday near the Capitol's
West Front, apparently in part to protest Communist rule in his
homeland. His body was identified Tuesday.
   Dozens of bystanders watched when Bang doused his body with a
flammable liquid and ignited himself.
   ``He said it too many times; it was like crying wolf,'' said
Quynh Thi, publisher of the Vietnam Daily News in San Jose. ``He
just said, `I want to die, I want to die, I want to die in front of
the Capitol for my country.'''
   Friends and colleagues described Bang, 56, as a workaholic who
never recovered from the trauma of leaving Vietnam after the
Communist victory in 1975.
   They said the father of five children was forced to spend time
in a ``re-education'' camp after North Vietnam took over. He later
fled Vietnam by sea.
   Some co-workers said they assumed he hoped to bring attention to
the issues of fellow boat people and the tribulations that
Vietnamese guest workers have endured in Eastern Europe.
   The fiery suicide evoked memories of the June 11, 1963,
immolation of Thich Quang Duc, a monk who killed himself on the
streets of Saigon to protest the South Vietnamese government's
discrimination against Buddhists.
   Bang had left California two months ago to help start a
Vietnamese-language newspaper called the Capitol Voice, based in
northern Virginia.
   Bach Hac Nguyen, owner of Capitol Voice, said she saw Bang on
Monday but he gave no indication that he planned to kill himself.
He left behind several letters - to Nguyen, to his wife and to Thi
- all of which were confiscated by authorities.
   Bang slept in a room at the Capitol Voice office and left only
to shower and eat at Nguyen's apartment, friends said.
   While Nguyen said Bang's suicide may have been meant to draw
attention to the problems of Vietnamese refugees, Thi said she
thought he was also plagued by emotional problems.
   ``He was very upset, and sometimes I think he was in mental
distress,'' Thi said, adding that anti-communism had become an
obsession for Bang. ``That was really a mental problem with him.''
   Bang, a banker in his native country, fought in the South
Vietnamese army against the communists. His grandfather, father,
uncle and younger brother were killed in the war.
   He and his wife, Doa Vien, 53, lost everything when they came to
the United States with their children, now age 14 through 25, and
settled in San Jose.
   A telephone message to the family was not returned Wednesday.
   Bang and Thi founded the Vietnam Daily News in 1986. Bang
eventually left to publish his own Vietnamese-language weekly,
Thuan An.

<HEAD>Study Says Deposit Law Would Help Environment</HEAD>

   Levying a deposit on beverage cans and bottles
would reduce pollution and conserve energy, says a government
report released Wednesday.
   The study by the General Accounting Office, the congressional
investigative agency, improves prospects for passing deposit
legislation next year, said Rep. Paul Henry, R-Mich.
   ``It addresses all of the industry concerns,'' said Henry, who
this year unsuccessfully sponsored a bill to charge a five-cent
refundable deposit on soft-drink, beer and mineral water
containers. Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., pushed similar legislation.
   ``There is no correlation between a bottle bill and a dropoff in
beverage consumption,'' Henry said. ``There is no direct tie
between loss of container manufacturing jobs and a bottle bill.''
   William L. Ball III, president of the National Soft Drink
Association, said a national deposit law ``would be an unwanted
albatross around the neck of those who are serious about recycling
and the environment.''
   Pepsi-Cola Co. spokeswoman Leigh Curtin said Henry's plan was
``high-handed environmental doubletalk'' that would impose a
``regressive tax'' on soft-drink consumers.
   Brewers and bottlers once imposed deposits to encourage
consumers to return glass bottles. But the practice has gradually
disappeared since the 1950s as cans gained popularity and bottlers
switched to non-returnable plastic and glass.
   Nine states have enacted deposit laws between 1972 and 1983:
Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New
York, Oregon and Vermont.
   California in 1987 established a program where redemption
centers, rather than retailers, redeem beverage containers. Florida
adopted a disposal-fee system in 1988 that affects beverage and
other containers. Several other states are considering some form of
deposit legislation, the study said.
   The beverage and container industries and retailers have
thwarted national legislation repeatedly since 1970. They contend
such laws increase the beverage industry's costs, reduce sales and
hurt some packaging products.
   The GAO report, however, said the trend toward cans and
non-returnable bottles and away from returnable bottles has
occurred in states with and without deposit laws.
   ``It is clear that factors other than deposit legislation also
affect beverage packaging decisions,'' the report said, citing
consumer preference and prices. Accordingly, ``it is not clear to
what extent the laws result in job losses in the container
manufacturing industry.''
   The report also found that:
   -Although there were some declines in beverage consumption in
some states after enactment of deposit legislation, the declines
were short-term and only partly caused by the laws.
   -States with deposit laws have reported declines as high as 83
percent in beverage-container litter.
   -Deposit laws could play a ``significant role'' in meeting the
EPA's goal of recycling 25 percent of the nation's solid waste.

<TEXT>
   The possibility of on-campus abortions
went down to resounding defeat when put to a student-body vote at
the University of Texas at Arlington.
   Only 34 percent - or 746 students - voted Monday and Tuesday in
support of a non-binding resolution calling for the university to
offer first-trimester abortions at a campus clinic. Officials said
1,430 students voted against the measure.
   Only 9 percent, or 2,233, of the university's 24,000 students
cast ballots in the election, which addressed other campus issues,
including election of homecoming queen. All of the voting students
did not vote on all the ballot issues.
   When asked if they would support the on-campus abortions if not
funded by student service fees, 718 students, or 34 percent, voted
yes and 1,372, or 66 percent, said no.
   The Student Congress presented the resolution to gauge campus
reaction to on-campus abortion services.
   ``I think the abortion issue got a lot of people to vote that
didn't traditionally vote. A lot of the Christian groups. ...
actually came out and voted against it,'' said Richie Grona, the
group's vice president.
   Fifty-two percent of those who voted identified themselves as
``pro-choice,'' while 39 percent said they were ``pro-life,'' and 9
percent were undecided.
   The Student Congress will meet Nov. 27 to decide whether to pass
the resolution. The student body itself cannot approve the clinic.
   If the council passes the resolution, it would then need
approval by UT-Arlington President Wendell Nedderman.
   There are no abortion clinics in Arlington, a city of about
250,000 located midway between Dallas and Fort Worth.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional report released Wednesday
supports a charge that lenders are miscalculating rate changes on
adjustable-rate mortgages.
   The General Accounting Office, in a letter to Sen. Richard
Lugar, R-Ind., said whistleblower John M. Geddes' ``basic
observation that some ... adjustment mistakes are taking place''
was supported by its research.
   However, most of the people interviewed by the congressional
watchdog agency said they believe Geddes overstated the extent of
the problem. Geddes estimated that 35 percent of all
adjustable-rate mortgages have been misadjusted and that borrowers
were overcharged $8 billion from 1979 to 1989.
   The GAO's research indicated the mistakes were accidental and
were as likely to favor the borrower as the lender.
   The GAO interviewed officials of five agencies regulating banks,
savings institutions and credit unions; two
congressionally-chartered secondary mortgage-market companies; the
Federal Trade Commission; the Department of Housing and Urban
Development; the savings and loan bailout agency, and 18 private
mortgage market participants.
   None of the government agencies ventured a guess about the
extent of adjustable-rate mortgage mistakes, but three of the
private participants offered estimates ranging from 20 percent to
30 percent.
   Geddes was fired by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
in August 1989 after he said that mortgage miscalculations could
expose the government to liability for the mistakes of savings and
loans that later failed and were seized by the government.
   Geddes based his charges on a study of 5,000 mortgages in the
Midwest. The GAO said interviewees indicated he may be
overestimating the problem because Midwestern institutions have
less experience with adjustable-rate mortgages and therefore tend
to make more mistakes.
   Based on the GAO study, Lugar this week asked Sen. Donald W.
Riegle Jr., D-Mich. and the chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, to hold a hearing on the situation early next year.

   President Bush finally said it Wednesday: ``The

   He had resisted saying it for more than a year, even as hardline
communist rule collapsed in country after country in Eastern Europe
and the Soviet Union became increasingly friendly toward the West.
   On a number of occasions, Bush has been asked whether he

   Yet he finally said it in Paris, at the conclusion of a

   ``We are closing a chapter in history,'' the president said.

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Wednesday
finally concluded the sale of its state carrier Aerolineas
Argentinas in the second major privatization of a money-losing
state business this month.
   Thirteen days after selling the phone company ENTel, the
government announced the sale of the state airline to a group of
private owners led by Iberia, Spain's national carrier. Aerolineas
is the second-largest carrier in South America.
   The sale of the airline and phone company are centerpieces of
President Carlos Menem's plans to revitalize Argentina's economy -
stagnant through much of the 1970s and '80s - by reducing the role
of the state.
   By selling both, the government pared its deficit by several
hundred million dollars a year, reduced the public payroll by about
67,000 employees and shrank Argentina's foreign debt by $7 billion.
   Just as the sale of ENTEL, or Empresa Nacional de
Telecomunicaciones, was opposed by legsilators and delayed a month
before finally being sold on Nov. 8, the Aerolineas deal was
hampered by controversy.
   The new owners, which include Argentina's private airline
Austral, argued so much about the down payment and installments
that the government considering putting Aerolineas out to bid a
second time.
   In return for 85 percent of Aerolineas, the government received
$130 million cash, and notes for another $130 million payable over
five years.
   The Iberia group also will pick up $2 billion of Argentina's
foreign debt. The total value of the deal was about $560 million,
assuming that Argentina's debt is purchased on secondary markets at
about 15 cents on the dollar.
   Argentina is the third-most indebted country in the developing
world after Brazil and Mexico.
   The new owners took possession of Aerolineas' property and 29
planes debt-free. Also, the government turned over 55 percent of a
company that prepares in-flight meals, Buenos Aires Catering.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A board member of the Miss Texas
Pageant resigned Wednesday, assailing the Miss America Pageant's
director and casting racial aspersions on the contest's selection
process.
   B. Don Magness ended his 30-year association with the Texas
beauty show in response to what he labeled ``blackmail'' by Leonard
Horn, director of the Miss America Pageant.
   Horn said in a letter this week that no Miss Texas would
participate in the national competition unless the Texas board
jettisoned Magness, who resigned under pressure as pageant director
last summer. He retained his board seat, however.
   In stepping down, the portly, popular and flamboyant Magness
raised questions about Horn and his role in the selection of the
last two Miss Americas, both black.
   He quoted Horn as saying another black winner would cause ``deep
trouble'' with sponsors and television ratings.
   He said Horn told him before the 1989 Miss America Pageant it
was time for a minority winner. Debbye Turner, who's black, won the
title.
   ``I'm not saying he rigged the '89 contest,'' Magness said.
``I'm just saying what he said. And it turned out that way.''
   Horn would not take calls from reporters Wednesday, but the
national pageant director said in a statement that Magness'
comments revealed why the pageant moved against him Tuesday.
   ``I am not going to dignify Mr. Magness' statement with any
comment except to say that his comments are again confirmation of
why the Miss America Organization does not want B. Don Magness
involved in our program any longer,'' he said.
   Magness also quoted from a July 20 article in The New York Times
that mentioned the possibility of a lawyer winning the Miss America
crown. Marjorie Vincent, Miss Illinois, was a second-year law
student at the time and also a summer law associate at Richard
Nixon's old New York law firm.
   The article said Horn disputed ``the notion that lawyers might
feel queasy about having one of their own as Miss America'' and
indicated that such a choice would enhance the legal profession.
   On the basis of that article, Magness said, he told a reporter
before the 1990 pageant that if Miss Texas did not win the national
title, Miss Illinois would. Ms. Vincent, who's black, won the 1991
crown in September.
   ``A lucky guess,'' said Magness, refusing further comment on the
Times article, his own prediction and Vincent's selection.
   Magness came under fire last summer after a Life magazine ran a
photograph showing him in a bubble bath smoking a big cigar and
quoting him as yelling, ``Come on in, sluts!'' to a group of Miss
Texas contestants.
   ``I apologize for the 40th time for the Life magazine article,''
Magness said Wednesday. ``I obviously regret doing it. I still
would like some day to see somebody write a fair pageant story. It
hasn't been done yet.''
   That article touched off other criticism of Magness and his
pageant activities and brought Horn to Fort Worth in October during
a two-month investigation of the Magness affair.
   ``He said he didn't need to be in Texas,'' Magness recalled,
quoting Horn as saying: ```I've got problems of my own. I've got my
second straight black Miss America.'''
   According to Magness, Horn said if it happens again, ```I'll be
in deep trouble with our sponsors and our (television) ratings.'''
   As far as his own troubles, Magness said he had the votes to
retain his board position but added: ``I would never do anything to
cause the competition to be removed from Fort Worth.''
   Horn's letter, he said, was ``a form of blackmail.''

   Bill Irwin fell to his knees in a
silent prayer of thanks Wednesday after he became the first blind
man to hike the entire 2,167-mile Appalachian Trail.
   ``It's just an indescribable feeling of gratitude,'' Irwin said.
``I feel like I did the best I could at the time, and hopefully the
Lord feels the same way.''
   Irwin, who set from the southern end of the trail at Springer
Mountain, Ga., arrived Wednesday morning on a snow-covered trail at
the remote Katahdin Stream campground.
   In all, he spent eight months on the trail.
   After sleet and snow at the start of this week, the sun shined
brightly and temperatures were in the high 30s for his arrival.
   Dozens of friends, reporters and other hikers joined Irwin for
the final 2.4-mile leg Wednesday, but let him walk the last tenth
of a mile alone. He was accompanied only by his guide dog, Orient,
who was with him every step of his journey.
   Eighteen fellow members of the People's Memorial Christian
Church in Irwin's hometown of Burlington, N.C., sang ``Amazing
Graze'' as he approached the campground.
   About 70 people watched silently as Irwin touched a sign
commemorating his eight-month trek. After Irwin prayed, the crowd
broke into cheers.
   Irwin, a 50-year-old recovering alcoholic who lost his sight to
an eye disease when he was 28, decided to attempt the feat as an
affirmation of his faith in God. Sponsors helped pay his expenses.
   Along the way, Irwind suffered a broken rib when he slipped on a
stone and his 50-pound pack swung over his head, slamming him onto
a rock.
   Irwin's closest brush with death came in Maine, when he was
swept off his feet while crossing the West Branch of the
Piscataquis River and was carried nearly 20 yards down the icy
stream, said David McCasland, a freelance writer who traveled with
Irwin the last two weeks. Also in Maine, he was held up three days
by a snowstorm that left 28 inches on the ground.
   Last month, Irwin interrupted his hike to climb mile-high Mount
Katahdin, site of the trail's northern terminus, before wintry
conditions closed that section of the path. He spent Tuesday
completing difficult sections of the trail he had previously
missed.

<TEXT>
   President Bush will meet Friday with Syrian
President Hafez Assad, a man whose government has been denounced by
the administration as a supporter of terrorism and oppressor of
human rights.
   The two-hour meeting focusing on the Persian Gulf crisis will be
held in Geneva as Bush heads home from a Thanksgiving day visit
with U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia and talks in Cairo with President
Hosni Mubarak.
   In Saudi Arabia Wednesday, Bush defended his meeting with the
leader of a state the U.S. government has branded as terrorist.
``Syrians want to see Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait just as much as
we do,'' Bush said. ``I have no problem sitting down with him for
this common objective.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater stressed, ``I don't think
it (the meeting) implies any change in our overall relationship.''
   Still, there are clear advantages for Bush in becoming the first
U.S. president Assad will meet since Jimmy Carter in 1977 - not the
least of which is solidifying Syrian support for the coalition
against Iraq.
   The meeting's main purpose is to discuss the coalition, to which
Syria has committed 15,000 troops, said Fitzwater.
   The two leaders will also discuss the plight of 13 Western
hostages, among them six Americans, held by pro-Iranian extremists
in Lebanon, he said. Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon,
with 40,000 troops who control large parts of the country.
   Taking advantage of its new alliance with Syria, the United
States asked Assad to use his good offices with Iran to press for
the hostages' release and for Iranian compliance with the
international trade embargo against Iraq.
   Assad went to Tehran in late September, after Secretary of State
James Baker met him in Damascus, but reportedly came away empty
handed on both counts.
   Assad also has much to gain from easing his hardline anti-U.S.
policy and joining the anti-Iraq coalition. An immediate dividend
is the rage of his bitter foe, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   By gaining points with the United States, Syria hopes it will
eventually be removed from the State Department's list of seven
countries that support terrorism and become eligible for aid or
other economic benefits.
   Officials have denied that Bush brokered a deal for Saudi Arabia
to give Syria $1 billion since the Syrians joined the coalition.
Nonetheless, a Syrian diplomat here confirmed the Saudis have
substantially increased their aid to Damascus in recent months,
easing the cutoff in Soviet support that sustained Assad for much
of the 1980s.
   Syria also hopes that by improving its relationship with
Washington, it might eventually prevail on the United States to
pressure its close ally Israel into relinquishing the Golan
Heights, a strategically vital area conquered in the 1967
Arab-Israeli war.
   U.S. officials bristle at the suggestion that the administration
is turning a blind eye to Syria's record. ``Our policy cannot and
never will be amoral,'' Baker said in response to criticism of his
visit to Damascus.
   ``We have an enormous problem with Syria'' because of its
alleged sponsorship of international terrorism, State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Wednesday. ``We cannot improve
our relations until the terrorism problem is cleared up. It is
still a very emotional, sensitive subject in our country.
   ``At the same time,'' she added, ``it is a fact of life they
have troops on the groud in Saudi Arabia. It's just really
important to other Arabs that they (Syria) not be left out.''
   Baker brought Syria documents which cite evidence that a
Palestinian guerrilla group headquartered in Damascus was
responsible for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am 103 in which 270 people,
mostly Americans, were killed.
   Syria responded, as it has often in the past, that the evidence
was insufficient to warrant the group's expulsion.
   Syria has also angered U.S. anti-narcotics officials.
   The State Department's International Narcotics Control Strategy
Report issued last March, said, ``We believe that Syria tolerates
and profits from the drug production and trafficking in the areas
over which it exercises control.''
   Syria controls Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, where production of opium
- the raw ingredient for heroin - increased significantly last
year.
   ``The Syrians aren't helping us,'' one official said. ``If
anything, they are hindering us.''
   ``Syria remains effectively under the rule of an authoritarian
regime,'' according to the State Department's annual report on
human rights around the world. ``Human rights abuses, including
torture, denial of the freedoms of speech, press, association, ...
continue to characterize the regime's record in 1989.''
   Middle East Watch, a human rights group, said in a recent report
that Syria had executed 10,000 of its own citizens over the past 20
years.
   The United States is also worried about Syria's chemical weapons
arsenal, considered by experts as dangerous as Iraq's - if not more
so. Acting within a 16-nation alliance known as the Australia
Group, the United States has tried to stop European companies from
helping Syria build its chemical weapons capability.
   But Syria is known to have begun production in the mid 1980s,
and to have equipped accurate SS-21 missiles with chemical warheads
that can hit neighboring Israel.

<TEXT>
   This battered provincial capital
and most of the rest of the country returned to peace Wednesday
after a brief guerrilla offensive, but few expected the calm to
last.
   ``It is very possible that these sick minds of the most radical
elements of the FMLN will continue or augment these actions,''
President Alfredo Cristiani told the nation Tuesday night, 20 hours
after the rebels launched their most extensive and concerted
military campaign of 1990.
   Usulutan, 65 miles southeast of San Salvador, was the scene of
some of Tuesday's heaviest combat. Rebels of the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front, or FMLN, struck army posts here and in
14 other towns and cities.
   The fighting left more than 80 dead and nearly 270 people
wounded, according to the U.S. State Department, which cited
Salvadoran military sources.
   As they have in many previous battles of El Salvador's 11-year
civil war, the citizens of this city of 80,000 listened to the
racket of gunfire through shuttered windows Tuesday, then returned
to their affairs at first light Wednesday.
   With the rebels cleared out of town, the market was bustling
with women selling melons, plantains and beans to shoppers. Buses
and other traffic circulated normally.
   But 25 miles to the west, on the flat coastal highway to San
Salvador, traffic was backed up more than an hour because of combat
between guerrillas and government soldiers.
   Reporters saw at least three soldiers wounded in the fighting.
Battles also continued Wednesday in Sesori, about 30 miles north of
Usulutan.
   In Santa Elena, five miles northeast of here, about 100
government troops rested or manned guard posts after driving rebels
out of the town Tuesday afternoon.
   But the feeling among townspeople was that the rebels had been
testing the waters and would be back.
   ``I'm going to stock up for a few days,'' said shopper
Evangelina Castillo, a 45-year-old mother of four.
   Guerrillas who spoke with reporters on the northern periphery of
San Salvador, where fighting was also heavy Tuesday, had said the
rebel campaign was designed to last three or four days.
   Insurgents remained entrenched in Quetzaltepeque, 10 miles north
of San Salvador.
   Guerrilla commander German Serrano said Wednesday in an
interview broadcast on the clandestine rebel radio said the
offensive was designed ``to pressure the army to agree to political
accords that will permit us to achieve peace.''
   The State Department strongly denounced the offensive and said
it was weighing an increase of military aid.
   ``Once again, the FMLN is talking about peace settlement, while
raining violence and death on El Salvador's citizens. The FMLN has
repeatedly stalled the negotiating process over the past four
months, and now claims to be seeking to accelerating it,'' said
spokesman Richard Boucher in Washington.
   Under legislation approved last month, Congress cut military aid
to El Salvador in half, to $42.5 million, because of the lack of
progress in halting rights abuses.
   The legislation would allow the cut aid to be restored if the
rebels launched a military offensive threatening the government.
Boucher said that provision of the legislation was being reviewed
in light of Tuesday's attacks.
   The bill also called for a complete aid cutoff if the government
pulls out of peace talks.
   Five rounds of peace talks this year have produced little
progress, bogging down on the rebel demand for demilitarization of
society.
   The rebels are calling for the transformation of the army into a
civilian-led police force.
   Cristiani has said his government is willing to reform the armed
forces, but that their abolition is out of the question.

   Although Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev appealed Wednesday for an urgent Security Council meeting
on the gulf crisis, there is no sign of an agreed resolution or a
meeting soon.
   Gorbachev's appeal came after President Bush failed to win the
Soviet leader's support for a U.N. resolution to use force to drive
Iraq from Kuwait.
   Gorbachev urged the 15-nation Security Council to address ``very
dangerous'' developments in the gulf and ``take a decision there.''
   He did not elaborate, but the comments seemed to indicate he was
moving closer to Bush's position.
   Bush met with Gorbachev on Tuesday in Paris, where the two
leaders were attending a European security summit. After the
meeting, Bush said that despite his failure to win support for a
U.N. resolution condoning force, he and Gorbachev ``saw eye to
eye'' on Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, and that any differences
between the two superpowers were ``extraordinarily minor.''
   The United States had been trying to push through a resolution
to use force against Iraq before the end of the month, when U.S.
Ambassador Thomas Pickering gives up the council's rotating
presidency. The position then passes to Yemen, which is the only
Arab council member and is reluctant to move toward war with Iraq.
   Asked if the United Nations might act this month on a U.N.
resolution to use force against Iraq, Bush said: ``Stay tuned.
There's certainly a chance.''
   Nevertheless, both the Soviet and American U.N. missions said
Wednesday they had no instructions to call a meeting of the
15-nation Security Council.
   Finnish Ambassador Klaus Tornudd, who is close to both the U.S.
and Soviet missions, said of the prospect for such a meeting: ``I
don't think so, not this week.''
   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said the U.N. Secretariat has
not been asked to make preparations for a council meeting.
   The U.S. mission said the only council action they have in sight
is a possible meeting Friday on a PLO-backed resolution on Israel
and the occupied territories, which would call for deployment of
U.N. peacekeepers to monitor Israeli security forces.
   The Soviets and Americans are known to have prepared texts for
potential resolutions on the gulf crisis, but they differ markedly,
diplomats have said.
   Resolutions already approved by the Security Council impose an
economic boycott on Iraq and occupied Kuwait, call for Iraq's
unconditional withdrawal, insist upon restoration of Kuwait's
deposed government and demand Iraq free all hostages.

<HEAD>Ohio Supreme Court Rejects Former Congressman's Appeal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Rep. Donald Lukens' conviction
on a charge of having sex with a 16-year-old girl in 1988 was
upheld Wednesday by the Ohio Supreme Court.
   Lukens resigned from Congress last month, two days after the
House Ethics Committee voted to investigate new charges of sexual
misconduct against him that involved alleged advances on a
congressional employee.
   Lukens, a Republican from Middletown, was sentenced in June 1989
to 30 days in jail and fined $500 after a jury convicted him of a
misdemeanor charge of contributing to the unruliness of a minor.
   He has been free on bond pending appeal.
   There was no immediate indication when Lukens might begin
serving his sentence.
   Franklin County Domestic Relations Judge Ronald Solove said he
would have to await paperwork in the case from the Supreme Court.
``Once that's done then we will probably set a date for enforcement
of the sentence,'' Solove said.
   A call to Lukens' lawyer, Thomas Tyack of Columbus, was not
immediately returned.
   Lukens' attorneys had argued that Solove erred by barring
testimony about the girl's juvenile offense record.
   The Franklin County prosecutor's office had no comment on the
appeal.
   A state appeals court upheld the conviction in June.
   Court records indicated the Supreme Court justices voted 5-1 to
dismiss the appeal, with one judge listed as not participating. The
court did not elaborate on its decision.
   Allegations surfaced in early 1989 that Lukens had sex with a
girl while he was a member of Congress. A Columbus television
station broadcast a videotape of a November 1988 meeting between
Lukens and the girl's mother, Anna Coffman. Lukens did not know the
meeting at a restaurant was being taped by a television crew.
   Lukens served two terms in Congress, from 1967 to 1970, and then
made an unsuccessful attempt to gain the GOP gubernatorial
nomination in Ohio. After 15 years in the Ohio Senate, voters
returned him to Congress in 1986 and he was re-elected in 1988.
   He lost his bid for a third consecutive term in the 8th District
GOP primary in May. He will be succeeded by state Rep. John
Boehner, who won the seat in the Nov. 6 election.

   Government supporters and opponents
skirmished in the capital Wednesday, as Parliament prepared to vote
on a controversial reform package that could decide the fate of
embattled Premier Andrei Lukanov.
   Riot police intervened to prevent serious clashes, the state BTA
news agency said.
   Leaders of the governing Socialist Party and the main opposition
alliance, the Union of Democratic Forces, went on national
television to call for tolerance and restraint before the key
Parliament session Thursday.
   The legislature is to vote on Lukanov's budget package, which
includes steep price hikes. Lukanov has said he will step down if
it is not passed.
   The Socialist premier faces increasing calls for his resignation
from citizens frustrated by the country's continuing economic
decline and food shortages.
   On Wednesday, several hundred supporters of the opposition
scuffled with pro-government demonstrators who marched through the
capital, witnesses said. They said hundreds of helmeted police
armed with shields and batons surrounded Parliament.
   Three demonstrators and three policemen were slightly injured in
the scuffles, said a police spokesman on condition of anonymity.
   A first-aid doctor said he saw one young opposition supporter
beaten by police after he allegedly attacked pro-government
demonstrators.
   Several hundred demonstrators marched to Sofia's TV station, the
site of pro-democracy demonstrations after Bulgaria's long-time
Communist leader Todor Zhivkov was ousted last November. Police
said there were no violent incidents.
   Supporters of both sides also rallied in other cities, many
chanting slogans such as ``Give Lukanov a Chance'' or ``Down with
the Socialists.'' There were no reports of violence.
   Zhivkov, who has been under house arrest since he was forced
from power, is to be brought to trial on charges of
misappropriating millions of dollars in state funds and for abuse
of power, the prosecutor general announced Tuesday. No date has
been set.
   After Zhivkov's ouster, the Communist Party subsequently renamed
itself the Socialist Party and introduced reforms that led to free
elections in June. The Socialists won a majority and hold 210 of
the 400 Parliament seats.
   The opposition, which holds 144 seas, rejected repeated offers
by Lukanov to form a coalition government that would have broad
popular support and be better able to push through badly needed
economic reforms.
   The government's inability to stock Bulgarian stores with
staples has caused the Socialists' popularity to plummet with the
economy's performance.
   In an effort to boost food supplies, Parliament voted Wednesday
to restrict the export of meat and dairy products, except in
exchange for scarce commodities, the BTA news agency said.
   The opposition alliance backed a call Tuesday by the labor
confederation Podkrepa for a general strike next week if Lukanov's
government does not resign.
   Several thousand university students, who have been on strike
for two weeks, also staged an anti-government rally in Sofia
Wednesday.
   The rector of Sofia University announced all classes would be
canceled from Thursday through Dec. 1 in solidarity with the
student strikers, BTA said.

<HEAD>Kasparov, Karpov Prepare for Second Half of Title Match</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Chess masters Garry Kasparov and Anatoly
Karpov said Wednesday they hope the peace and quiet of this central
French river city will help their play when they face off this
weekend for the world championship.
   Both complained of the noise and activity that surrounded them
in New York, where they ended a 12-game contest in a draw, with six
points apiece. The second half of their championship play begins
Saturday.
   ``For chess publicity it was better in New York, but for the
chess player it is better in Lyon,'' Kasparov, the 27-year-old
defending world champion, told a joint news conference.
   Karpov, 39, said the longtime rivals had hoped to boost the
popularity of chess among Americans by playing in New York from
Oct. 8 to Nov. 7.
   He said chess ``is a lot more popular in Europe.''
   Unlike New York, where honking horns and police sirens proved
inescapable, the two Soviet masters are installed in spacious
villas in Lyon.
   ``It's always different between a hotel and a grand villa,''
Kasparov said.
   Karpov agreed. ``In New York, I was on a very noisy street,'' he
said, adding that he had to move into a hotel one night to get
rest. ``Here I have a nice, quiet house.''
   Each player won one game in New York. They tied 10.
   Kasparov likened the match - the fifth world championship he has
played against Karpov - to the series they played in 1986 in London
and Leningrad, which began with only three clear victories in
London. At the time, Kasparov was defending the title he won a year
earlier.
   ``We had only three positive results in London and then six
results in Leningrad,'' Kasparov said. ``Hopefully, we will have it
here again.''
   Kasparov retained the title again in 1987 when the match ended
at 12 points apiece.
   The two men dislike each other, but Kasparov declined to discuss
personal animosity Wednesday. ``For me to explain it again, I would
have to tell my biography from beginning to end,'' he said.
   The talkative, flamboyant Kasparov, who speaks fluent English,
identifies Karpov with the official Soviet system.
   Karpov, who is frequently portrayed as a colorless introvert who
plays with surgical precision, has often said he has ``two loves:
communism and chess.'' The first player to win 12{ points is victor
in this year's world championship, and will receive $1.7 million of
a $3 million purse. A 12-12 tie would leave Kasparov with the
title.
   Kasparov says he will help victims of the Chernobyl nuclear
power station disaster and promote chess in schools with his share
of the winnings.
   Karpov has been quoted as saying that his earnings will finance
``my private interests and the political interests of the world.''

<HEAD>Government Announces Accord With Army on Makeup of High Command</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Patricio Aylwin has succeeded
in vetoing the promotions of two generals favored by Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, the government announced Wednesday.
   The vetoed officers, Brig. Gens. Carlos Parera and Ramon Castro,
will remain in the army, but will not be promoted to major general
as Pinochet wished, said Defense Minister Patricio Rojas.
   Parera, commander of the Santiago garrison, will be made
military attache at an unspecified embassy abroad, apparently South
Africa, sources said.
   Castro will remain as military attache in the Chilean embassy in
Washington.
   Rojas said in a communique that Aylwin approved all the new
assignments to the high command that had been proposed by Pinochet.
   The outcome of the annual army command shuffle seemed to
strengthen Aylwin, who took office in March after the first Chilean
elections in 18 years.
   Wednesday's arrangement marked the first time since the military
coup that brought Pinochet to power in 1973 in which the command
makeup was not determined by Pinochet alone.
   Aylwin's relations with the army are considered among the most
complex problems he will deal with during his four-year term.
   Under a special clause of the 1980 constitution, the 74-year-old
Pinochet remained commander of the 65,000-man army. Aylwin cannot
fire Pinochet.

<HEAD>Iran Says Embassies Involved in Drug Smuggling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH PANOSSIAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran said Wednesday some embassies in
Tehran are involved in drug trafficking and appealed to Europe and
the United Nations to help combat the smuggling of narcotics.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Cyprus,
said the charge was leveled by Mokhtar Kalantari, commander of the
Islamic Revolution's Committees and secretary of the Anti-drug
Headquarters.
   Kalantari told a news conference in Tehran the Foreign Ministry
was investigating the alleged involvement of certain embassies in
drug smuggling, but did not specify what ones.
   Iran is a major transit route for illicit Asian drugs reaching
Europe and the United States. Some drugs are also believed produced
locally.
   He said with European help, Iran will completely block transit
of drugs to Europe.
   ``Unfortunately, those countries appear to be indifferent toward
the fate of their youths. No heroin would arrive in Europe if
Western countries desired to contribute to our anti-narcotics
campaign,'' IRNA quoted him as saying.
   He did not elaborate on what help he expected Europe to offer.
   However, Kalantari also complained that the U.N. Fund for
Anti-Narcotics Campaign failed to help fight smuggling. He
suggested the fund could offer assistance to his government.
   ``What we need is some technological assistance, such as
drug-detecting instruments, and trained dogs,'' he said.
   Kalantari estimated the number of Iranian drug addicts at 1
million, but said 200,000 to 300,000 have given up the habit the
past two years ``and not single person had become addicted to opium
in the said period.''
   U.N. reports have said the number of addicts in Iran is at least
double that reported officially.
   Iran's parliament passed a law in 1988 mandating the death
penalty for anyone caught possessing narcotics, no matter the
quantity. According to official figures, 1,500 people have been
executed for drug offenses since then and about 50,000 people
jailed as abusers.
   Iranian opposition groups and international human rights
organizations maintain that those executed included political
prisoners.
   Kalantari said Iran's crackdown has broken up about 520
international drug trafficking rings since 1988, comprising 38,862
smugglers who included 1,158 Afghanis.
   He said members of one ring recently confessed to smuggling
three tons of drugs to Europe. He gave no details.
   Kalantari said Afghanis were the main distributors of drugs,
``and there are clues that they account for 60 to 70 percent of
smuggling rings.''
   On Tuesday, Iranian security forces killed ``eight notorious
traffickers and bandits'' - including two Afghanis - in a clash in
Sirjan, in southern Hormuzgan province, he said.

   Mayor Raymond Flynn said Wednesday he is
considering a nighttime curfew for young people as city officials
and civic leaders reel from arrests of teen-agers in the Halloween
gang rape and murder of a young woman.
   The curfew idea drew immediate criticism from civil libertarians
who called it an unconstitutional abridgement of freedom, but Flynn
said parents have to be made accountable for their children.
   ``I'm going to talk to parents, young kids, community leaders
and see whether or not there's something we can put in place that
holds parents responsible for the behavior of their children,
particularly in the wee hours of the morning,'' Flynn said.
   Authorities alleged that the rape and murder of 26-year-old
Kimberly Rae Harbour was committed by a gang of teen-agers roaming
the streets in search of women to rob. Eight black tee-agers were
arrested this week.
   Flynn suggested a system similar to the curfew put in place this
week in Atlanta, where youths under 18 hanging around on street
corners or in public places are arrested and turned over to the
custody of their parents.
   He said that if he decides to start a curfew, he would make it
effective in the spring, when warming weather draws more people
outside.
   The Massachusetts chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union,
like its Georgia counterpart, promised to challenge a curfew in
court.
   ``There is no way to equitably enforce curfew laws. It's simply
impossible,'' said John Roberts, director of the Massachusetts CLU.
``It will be enforced in some neighborhoods and you know which
ones. It will be enforced vigorously in Roxbury in a way that it
will not in West Roxbury.''
   Roxbury is a predominantly black neighborhood that has been
beset by violent crime in the past several years. West Roxbury is a
predominantly white neighborhood and one of the more affluent
sections of Boston.
   Harbour's nude body was found on a grassy knoll in the Franklin
Field park in Dorchester, a neighborhood next to Roxbury that also
has been troubled by crime. Harbour had been bludgeoned, repeatedly
raped, and stabbed more than 100 times.
   Boston city Councilor Bruce Bolling, who is black, said the
curfew idea ``merits some discussion,'' but he questioned how it
could be practically enforced.
   State Sen. Bill Owens criticized police for withholding details
of the murder and investigation for three weeks. He added that ``We
do not accept the blanket indictment that the entire black male
population of our community behaves in this manner.''
   Police compared the attack to one in New York's Central Park in
which a female jogger was raped, brutally beaten and left for dead,
allegedly by a group of black teen-agers who had gone ``wilding.''
   The Harbour slaying initially drew little public notice after
police announced it as a homicide. Details weren't released until
this week after the arrests of the eight teen-agers, five of them
juveniles.
   Prosecutors are seeking to have the five juveniles charged as
adults. Conviction as an adult on a charge of first-degree murder
would bring an automatic life sentence without parole. If they are
found delinquent as juveniles, they could be released on their 18th
birthday.
   The juveniles are scheduled to appear in court Dec. 5. Three
adults aged 17, 18 and 19 have a pre-trial hearing on Dec. 29.

   The leaders of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia on
Wednesday denounced what they termed ``a policy of intimidation''
by the Kremlin against the Baltic republics, according to media
reports.
   Their summit was convened in Jurmala, Latvia, to respond to
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proposals on strengthening
the executive branch of government under his control.
   The leaders issued a statement asking the parliaments of the
three republics to meet in an extraordinary joint session, citing
what they said was a ``real threat to the independence of the three
Baltic states.'' The statement did not elaborate.
   Presidents Vytautas Landsbergis of Lithuania, Anatoly Gorbunov
of Latvia and Arnold Ruutel of Estonia invited representatives from
international bodies to attend.
   In an interview with Interfax News Agency, Estonian presidential
spokesman Tonu Kalume said the Baltics will not be swayed from
their course of ``full sovereignty and independence,'' even if
Gorbachev threatens to introduce direct presidential rule or
economic sanctions.
   In a separate appeal to the Soviet parliament, Landsbergis,
Gorbunov and Ruutel denounced what they said were ``direct threats
to use force to suspend our democratically elected governmental
institutions and our laws,'' according to the Baltic News Service.
   ``In the face of these threats, we note that the Baltic states
will exercise their inalienable right to resist violence,'' it
quoted the appeal as saying. ``The people, parliaments and the
governmental bodies of the Baltic states will oppose new aggression
and the repetition of tragic events comparable to those of 1940.''
   The presidents reiterated their refusal to sign Gorbachev's
proposed union treaty, which would redefine the relationship
between the Soviet government and the republics. They expressed
willingness, however, to take part in negotiations and conclude
agreements with the Soviet Union and with other republics on
political, economic and other forms of cooperation.
   Gorbachev said Wednesday support existed in the Baltics for
staying in the Soviet Union.
   He told Soviet and French television journalists before leaving
Paris, in an interview broadcast on Soviet TV:
   ``Look what happened during the celebration of the Soviet
Revolution Day. More people took part in the celebration in Riga
than in Moscow. And Latvians, Poles, Russians - all people who live
there, Ukrainians, threw flowers at the participants in the parade.
   ``People went there deliberately to demonstrate in favor of
this, the union, in favor of preservation, yes, also for renewal.
So when we analyze these complex processes, we have to see the
entire complexity of the thing, not just statements made by
(Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera) Prunskiene, Landsbergis or
anyone else.''
   Gorbachev denounced as a ``provocation'' a demonstration that
took place in Lithuania on Saturday in which protesters marched to
a Soviet military base, shouted slogans against the Red Army and
scuffled with soliders.
   ``An appeal to the government and the police didn't do any
good,'' he said. ``The military had to defend themselves without
using weapons.''
   ``The fact is that the great majority of the people are in favor
of the union, I am convinced.''
   Gorbachev rejected the Baltic republics' declarations of
independence this year. He blocked deliveries of Soviet oil,
natural gas and other key supplies to Lithuania. Those sanctions
ended after the government in Vilnius suspended its declaration in
exchange for the start of negotiations with the Kremlin.
   Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia - independent between the two
world wars - were seized by Josef Stalin in 1940.

<TEXT>
   The new prime ministers of India and
Pakistan agreed Wednesday that hostilities between their nations
had helped keep the region enslaved by poverty.
   But in their speeches at the opening of a seven-nation South
Asian summit, the leaders avoided the contentious issues that led
to three India-Pakistan wars in 43 years and brought them to the
brink of a fourth conflict earlier this year.
   ``If we fight amongst each other, we will not be able to fight
poverty, misery and squalor,'' said India's Chandra Shekhar,
departing from his prepared text.
   ``It is regrettable that the new wave of conciliation and
accommodation has not as yet pervaded the South Asian region,''
said Nawaz Sharif, head of Pakistan's two-week-old government.
   Sharif said the South Asian nations ``face underdevelopment in
all its manifestations,'' and cannot afford confrontations and high
defense budgets. ``We should harness the requisite political will
to eliminate the root causes of suspicion and tension in our
region.''
   It was the international debut for both men, who each came to
power the last two weeks, Sharif through general elections and
Chandra Shekhar because of the collapse of a previous government.
   The summit opening was marked by impatience with the slow pace
of regional development because of the conflicts and distrust among
the members of the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation,
known as SAARC.
   Chandra Shekhar, who was granted a two-day delay of the summit
while he assembled his government in New Delhi, said the
differences should not be allowed to impede economic cooperation.
   ``Most of the time SAARC meetings and summits are just
formalities. Why not try to take up the issues which are agitating
the minds of the people?'' he said.
   India has sought to use the regional association to broaden
trade, economic and financial ties in the region, but the smaller
countries have been reluctant to move too quickly for fear their
economies would be swamped by their huge neighbor.
   The other members of six-year-old organization are Bangladesh,
Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives. Afghanistan's
application to join may be discussed by the summit, officials said.
   Preliminary talks by foreign ministers focused on whether to
seek outside contributions to a regional development fund and on
harmonizing laws against drug trafficking.
   Reporters have been kept at a distance from the delegations, but
officials said Sharif and Chandra Shekhar had no opportunity to
meet before the opening session.
   The seven leaders and their top aides were scheduled to spend
all of Thursday in informal talks on an isolated tropical island.
   The heads of India and Pakistan have not met since the last
regional summit two years ago.
   Escalating guerrilla violence and an Indian army crackdown in
the northern Kashmir valley nearly brought a fourth war between the
two countries earlier this year.
   India accuses Pakistan of aiding seccessionist insurgencies by
Sikhs in Punjab state and by Moslems in Jammu-Kashmir. Pakistan
denies actively helping the guerrillas, but supports their aims for
self-determination.
   The two insurrections have claimed more than 4,400 lives this
year.
   As the summit began, Maldives officials said three local
magazines had been closed and their editors arrested on charges of
publishing articles defaming the government.
   Residents said the offending articles accused defense officials
of corruption, and that seven local journalists had been arrested.
   The archipelago nation, a chain of 1,190 islands with a
population of 200,000, witnessed a coup attempt two years ago by
dissidents who accused President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom of stifling
all dissent.
   India rushed troops to its neighbor 400 miles off its southern
coast to crush the coup attempt carried out by Sri Lankan Tamil
merceneries.

   A municipal employee pleaded innocent Wednesday
to charges that he murdered Jewish extremist Meir Kahane, while
followers of the slain right-wing rabbi called for vengeance.
   ``No justice, no peace'' chanted about 40 demonstrators marching
in a circle outside the courthouse. One of their placards read:
``Hand Nosair over, we'll take care of him.''
   Defendant El Sayyid Nosair, 35, a native of Egypt, wore a white
skullcap with Arabic script around its perimeter. His chin and neck
were bandaged where he was shot by a postal police officer he
encountered after allegedly shooting Kahane at a Manhattan hotel on
Nov. 5.
   Nosair, of Cliffside Park, N.J., has been suspended from his
city job of repairing heating and air-conditioning equipment.
   Kahane, a New York native, had served four years in Israel's
Parliament but was barred from office in 1988 by a ban on racist
parties. He had campaigned to drive Arabs from Israel.
   Before moving to Israel, Kahane founded and led the Jewish
Defense League and urged American Jews to arm themselves against
anti-Semites.
   When Nosair entered the courtroom, Suzanne Gruer shouted
``Revenge!'' in Hebrew.
   Gruer, 21, of East Northport, wearing a T-shirt bearing the
symbol of Kahane's Kach Party, was among about 100 people crowding
the courtroom.
   Gruer said they were there to ``show how strongly we feel. We
will not permit a whitewash.''
   Acting state Supreme Court Justice Sheryl Parker scheduled a
hearing for Dec. 5. Supreme Court in New York state is a
trial-level court.
   Nosair remained in custody without bail.
   An indictment announced Tuesday charged Nosair with murder,
attempted murder, assaulting a police officer, assault, weapon
possession, reckless endangerment and coercion.
   District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said federal and local
investigators had developed no information connecting others to the
slaying and that it appeared Nosair acted alone.
   The murder charge carries a maximum sentence of 25 years to life
in prison.

<HEAD>Energy Department Lax In Overseeing Nuclear Weapons Security,
Report Says</HEAD>

   The Energy Department failed to take prompt
action after inspections showed that some guards at nuclear weapons
facilities could not shoot accurately and did not know how to
arrest, search or handcuff intruders, congressional investigators
said Wednesday.
   The General Accounting Office, an investigating arm of Congress,
said some shortcomings uncovered in 1985 inspections at the
department's Los Alamos, Argonne, Sandia and Savannah River sites
went uncorrected for five years.
   It said the department gave the Argonne facility an
unsatisfactory rating over the five-year period but continued to
rate security at the others as satisfactory.
   The GAO report was requested by the House energy subcommittee on
oversight and investigation and by Sens. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., and
Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., after a 10-week strike by the contract
security force at the Los Alamos National Laboratory last year.
   The congressional investigators said many guards hired as
replacements during the strike did not have the required skills.
   They also said an unannounced exercise conducted in April showed
that 75 per cent of the regular security force failed at one or
more of the skills required.
   ``For example, when the participants encountered an adversarial
situation, many failed to stay behind cover and assess the
situation,'' the report said. ``Instead, they left their cover and
walked up to the potential adversaries to ask what they were
doing.''
   Consequently, it said, many of the adversaries were able to take
out a visible weapon, theoretically kill the guard and make off
with classified documents.
   It said 24 participants and hostages were ``killed'' during the
test.
   The GAO said the department does not routinely conduct
unannounced tests, which it considers disruptive, but did so at the
request of the congressional agency.
   The Energy Department referred inquiries about the report to Los
Alamos, where Anna Bachicha, a public affairs officer, said the
``report was just released today and we just received a copy of it
this afternoon and have not had time to fully assess it.''
   ``If after we review it we find there are any weaknesses we'll
take whatever steps are necessary to correct those findings,'' she
said. ``The department is confident that safeguards and security
programs at Los Alamos are being managed in an effective and
efficient manner.''
   L. Ari Fleischer, Domenici's press secretary, said he had
written to Energy Secretary James D. Watkins asking him to respond
to the report.
   ``He is concerned about it, of course,'' Fleischer said. ``But
we don't read that to say that there is an imminent crisis out
there or that DOE facilities are in imminent danger or even in
danger at all.''
   The agency recommended that the department standardize skill
requirements for all security force members, including strike
replacements, and make sure they all receive required training.
   It also recommended that contractors have part of their fees
withheld if they fail to correct weaknesses in security.

   When it comes to Thanksgiving hunger in America
this year, more people are hurting and fewer people are helping.
   ``Some of the people who had been giving are people who need
help this year,'' said Wiley Cooper, director of the United Way of
America's emergency food and shelter program.
   The slumping national economy and fears of war in the Middle
East are cutting into donations, charity groups say.
   Joseph Zalenski, director of the Brotherhood Mission in
Philadelphia, said some people are disheartened because they can't
give.
   ``The only thing I can do is to graciously back off and say, `I
appreciate your plight,''' Zalenski said. ```I understand and I
only hope it doesn't get worse for you, so that you don't come down
to where these people are right now.'''
   The National Coalition for the Homeless estimates there are 3
million homeless people nationwide. Cooper said there is no
reliable way of counting the hungry, but ``the people who are
providing the services are reporting to us their demand is up
greatly.''
   ``The economy and the Saudi Arabia thing have hurt us the
most,'' said Ron Cool of the Kiwanis Club of Little Rock, Ark.
Donations for Thanksgiving food baskets are off 10 percent to 15
percent, he said. ``People are a little afraid, and they're hanging
onto their bucks.''
   Some restaurants that helped supply the Rhode Island Community
Food Bank have gone out of business, said Eileen Welly, executive
director. A drive last week collected 300,000 pounds of canned
foods - 100,000 pounds less than last year.
   Salvation Army Lt. Col. Leon Ferraez, the national spokesman,
said demand for Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday relief services
is up nearly 20 percent at the army's 9,000 centers.
   Last year, the Salvation Army spent $115 million for food,
shelter, clothing, toys and parties over the holidays. This year,
Ferraez said $138 million will be needed. He couldn't say how much
has been raised so far.
   ``We just pray that the resources come in,'' said Ferraez,
Salvation Army spokesman.
   Five-thousand households will celebrate Thanksgiving with canned
hams and chickens from the Maryland Food Bank, even though the
agency's holiday food drive has collected 180,000 pounds of food,
far short of the 650,000 pounds it had hoped for.
   Feed the Hungry in Atlanta will serve 23,000 to 25,000
Thanksgiving dinners and deliver an additional 4,000. It served
21,000 last year. Its organizer, the Rev. Hosea Williams, said he
needs $100,000 but has collected just $3,000 so far.
   ``We always bail ourselves out at Christmas,'' said Williams.
``(But) we've never been this short before.''
   In Ohio, 547 turkeys were donated by Tuesday after the Toledo
Seagate Food Bank announced last week that some 700 families would
get only bologna and tuna for Thanksgiving. Alice Mosiniak, food
bank executive director, said plant closings and layoffs have
heightened the need as donations and surplus food dwindled.
   ``The ones who are bringing the turkeys in, for the most part,
are the ones who are having a hard time themselves, but they know
what it's like to go without something,'' Mosniak said.
   At the Salvation Army in Miami, donations on Monday were $793
ahead of last year, but there are 800 more homeless people, said
Maj. Ted Arrowood, area commander. ``The faster we go, the more
behind we get,'' he said.

<HEAD>Interim Government Reportedly Goes to Liberia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amos Sawyer, the president of an
interim government for war-shattered Liberia, left for the capital
city of Monrovia to be installed in a ceremony expected Thursday, a
source in the government said.
   Sawyer left unannounced Wednesday with his entourage, the source
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He would not say if the
party went by ship or by air.
   Security apparently was the reason for the secrecy. Warring
factions have killed prominent politicians and Sawyer's government
is opposed by rebel leader Charles Taylor, whose army has overrun
most of Liberia except Monrovia.
   Taylor's insurgents have been shelling the port of Monrovia this
week.
   Three members of Sawyer's proposed Cabinet were threatened by
rival rebel chief Prince Johnson, and it was not clear whether they
left with the party.
   Sawyer, a veteran leftist opposition leader and a political
scientist, was chosen as interim leader at a September conference
of Liberian exiles. He has the backing of five Western African
nations - Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Gambia - which
have sent a regional task force to Liberia to enforce peace in that
fellow West African nation of 2.3 million people.
   The five nations say the fighting and flood of Liberian refugees
also affected them.
   Taylor and Johnson invaded Liberia from Ivory Coast last
December to overthrow President Samuel Doe, whom they accused of
corruption, tribalism and brutal repression of opposition.
   The rebels fell out in February. Johnson's fighters, a small
band compared to Taylor's army, won the race to Monrovia, captured
and tortured Doe to death, and since have been cooperating with the
West African task force.
   Nigerian jets from the intervention force have been bombing
rebel-held towns to force Taylor to negotiate an end to the
11-month-old war in which more than 10,000 civilians have been
killed.
   Remnants of Doe's army have signed a cease-fire with Johnson.
The two sides say they support Sawyer's interim administration and
its mandate to organize fair elections.
   Taylor says Sawyer and his team are puppets of West African
governments bent on dominating Liberia. Taylor has named a rival
government.
   Installation of Sawyer's administration appears to anticipate a
West African summit scheduled for Monday in Bamako, Mali, to
discuss Liberia.
   Taylor has said he would attend the meeting, but he has promised
to go to other peace conferences without showing up.

<HEAD>Officials Say Loud Music May Have Been Factor in Fatal Accident</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Loud stereo music may have prevented a
school bus driver from hearing a locomotive warning horn moments
before the train and bus collided, killing him and a young
passenger, authorities said.
   A side-view mirror on the bus also may have impaired the
driver's vision and contributed to Friday's accident at a railroad
crossing in downtown Miltona, officials said Tuesday.
   But the crucial factor in the crash was the driver's apparent
failure to stop at the crossing as required by state law, said
Douglas County Sheriff Terry Eilers.
   ``If he would have come to a proper stop as school buses are
supposed to and taken a look, this accident would not have
happened,'' said Eilers.
   ``You can put all kinds of possible causes and factors and
probabilities into it, but unless the driver obeys the law and
makes sure the track is clear, the other factors don't mean much,''
said Eilers.
   Driver Fred Beman, 66, and Kristian Rindahl, 9, of rural Carlos,
were killed in the crash. Twenty-one students were injured.
   Eilers said mechanical difficulties had been ruled out as a
possible cause after a preliminary investigation. He said a full
report was expected in three to five weeks.
   The use of stereos on school buses and school bus driver
training procedures will be reviewed, said Paul Tschida, state
commissioner of public safety.

   The future of the Fox series ``American
Chronicles,'' the newest television offering from the makers of
``Twin Peaks,'' is up in the air, Fox Broadcasting Co. and its crew
said Wednesday.
   ``People are picking up their final paychecks,'' segment
producer David Jones said.
   But Fox said the show had not been canceled and that no decision
had been made to end the series.
   ``It's not canceled,'' said Fox spokesman Brad Turell. ``We
haven't decided whether we will pick it up'' for additional
episodes.
   ``American Chronicles,'' a surreal travelogue from ``Twin
Peaks'' creators Mark Frost and David Lynch, debuted this fall and
fell to last place in the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings.
   The program mixed music and video as it catalogued bits of
Americana from decidedly skewed angles. The show has traveled to
New Orleans for Mardi Gras, to the Lone Star state for the Miss
Texas Pageant and to Sturgis, S.D., for the 50th Annual Bikers
Convention.
   The last installment of the show's 13-episode contract is
scheduled for Dec. 22. Members of the show's staff said they
weren't told if Fox will air all 13 segments.

<HEAD>Report Says Vatican Profited From Birth Control Pill Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic Church benefited
financially from the sale of birth control pills, according to a
German television report Wednesday night.
   Citing internal documents from the prosecutor's office in Milan,
the report said the Vatican Bank in the late 1960s held a majority
of shares in the Rome-based pharmaceutical firm Serono, which began
producing birth control pills in 1968.
   That same year, the Roman Catholic Church reaffirmed its
opposition to artificial birth control in Pope Paul VI's encyclical
``Humanae Vitae.''
   The report came from the German news magazine Stern and was
broadcast on the private television station RTL Plus.
   According to Stern, the Vatican Bank by 1970 had sold its shares
in Serono to a Milan-based bank, which the report identified as
Banca Unione.
   But the Vatican Bank had 20 percent of the shares of the Milan
bank and so profited indirectly from the sales of birth control
pills, according to the report.

<TEXT>
   Another batch of locally made eye drops was
found to be contaminated, but with a different bacteria than the
strain that caused infections so bad that two people lost eyes,
hospital officials said Wednesday.
   The eyedrops in both cases were sold under the brand name
Indocin by Hieber's Pharmacy during the second half of this year.
   In the most recent case, Eye &amp; Ear Hospital found several
strains of bacteria in three bottles of Indocin eye drops a
suburban Pittsburgh man bought at the pharmacy in July, August and
September.
   Results of tests to determine the origin and type of the
bacteria were expected Friday, said hospital spokesman Mark Kanny.
   Prelimary test results ruled out pseudomonas, said Kanny. That
highly toxic strain, found in a batch of the drops believed to have
been made in October, caused at least 12 people to be hospitalized
with eye infections, two of whom required surgery to remove the
infected eye, he said.
   ``It appears one type of bacterium appears in two bottles and
that some bottles have more than one bacterium growing in them,''
Kanny said.
   It wasn't clear if the bacteria were introduced during the
manufacture of the eye drops, Kanny said.
   In the newly reported case, the bacteria were found in three
bottles of Indocin purchased by Karl Smith, 60, of Aspinwall, with
a prescription written by his ophthalmalogist.
   Smith began taking the drops in July and complained of pain and
redness in the eyes in October.
   His doctor told him to decrease the dosage. When the pain
continued, he sought treatment Tuesday at Eye &amp; Ear's emergency
room.
   ``It's like burning in the eyes, like fires in my eyes,'' Smith
said Wednesday.
   Indocin is an anti-inflammatory agent commonly taken orally to
treat patients with arthritis or osteoarthritis. Several Pittsburgh
area doctors have prescribed its use in eye drop form, which was
mixed at Hieber's, to reduce swelling following cataract surgery.
   Although not illegal, Indocin has not been approved by the Food
&amp; Drug Administration for use in eye drops.
   State and federal officials are investigating how the drops
became contaminated and why Hieber's, allegedly without proper
registration, was providing them to doctors and other pharmacists
for resale to patients.
   Pittsburgh area officials earlier this month issued a recall of
all eye drops containing Indocin or the generic equivalent
indomethacin.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Wednesday urged the U.N. Security
Council to meet immediately on the gulf crisis, and French
President Francois Mitterrand said a resolution backing military
force against Iraq could be adopted within a month.
   President Bush arrived in Saudi Arabia, where he met King Fahd
and Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, Kuwait's exiled emir. He planned
to spend Thanksgiving with American troops deployed under operation
Desert Shield and to meet Friday with Syrian President Hafez Assad.
   In Baghdad, Western officials said Iraq had agreed to release
157 Europeans it is holding. Many have said Saddam Hussein's policy
of gradually releasing hostages is designed to break the world
alliance against Iraq.
   Before flying to Saudi Arabia, Bush wrapped up a three-day visit
to Paris where he had gone to attend a European security meeting.
The Paris conference on peace in Europe, however, was dominated by
talk of war in the Middle East.
   Bush had hoped to win Soviet backing for a Security Council
resolution on using military might to drive Iraq out of Kuwait,
which it invaded on Aug. 2. But the Soviets stopped short of
supporting any such action.
   Bush tried to dismiss talk about a conflict of opinion, saying
he and Gorbachev saw ``eye to eye'' on the subject of Iraq's
occupation of Kuwait. He said any differences between the
superpowers were ``extraordinarily minor.''
   When asked if the United Nations might act this month on a
resolution to use force against Iraq, Bush said: ``Stay tuned.
There's certainly a chance.''
   On Wednesday, Gorbachev seemed to move closer to Bush's
position. The Soviet president urged a Security Council meeting be
held ``without delay to discuss the situation'' in the Persian Gulf
and ``take a decision there.''
   But Gorbachev did not say what any U.N. meeting might discuss,
or when the council might meet. At U.N. headquarters in New York,
Soviet and U.S. officials said they had received no instructions on
the matter.
   In Paris, Mitterrand said a U.N. resolution authorizing the use
of force against Iraq was needed.
   ``We are prepared to discuss it,'' he said, reiterating France's
declared readiness to talk about such a resolution. ``As far as its
being put into effect, that's another matter. There is nothing
automatic.''
   He said the resolution ``should be adopted within the next three
weeks.''
   Resolutions already approved by the Security Council impose a
trade embargo on Iraq, urge Baghdad's unconditional withdrawal,
insist upon restoration of Kuwait's deposed government and demand
Iraq free Western hostages.
   Iraq is holding hundreds of Westerners, many as human shields at
strategic sites to deter attack by the multinational force arrayed
against Iraq. Others have been released to visiting foreign
dignitaries.
   French right-wing politician Jean Marie Le Pen, who arrived in
Baghdad on Sunday, will take 83 European hostages to Strasbourg,
seat of the European parliament, a member of his delegation said
Wednesday. Le Pen belongs to the European Parliament, which is
scheduled to discuss the gulf crisis on Thursday.
   Captives to be allowed to leave with Le Pen on Thursday included
Britons, Italians, Germans, Irish, Dutch, Danes, Belgians,
Portuguese and a Greek citizen.
   The head of a Swiss parliamentary delegation said an additional
36 hostages would leave Thursday on a Swissair charter flight to
Zurich. Those captives were Swiss, Irish and British.
   Also Wednesday, the head of personnel for foreign workers at Ibn
al-Bitar Hospital said 38 mostly Irish staff members would be
allowed to leave, although it was unclear when they could go.
   Bush began his Middle Eastern tour in an effort to build the
alliance against Iraq and bolster the morale of U.S. forces in
Saudi Arabia. He said he would tell U.S. troops they were ``not
there on a mission impossible.''
   On Thursday, Bush was to spend Thanksgiving in Dhahran, Saudi
Arabia, with the 250,000 U.S. troops deployed there. It was to be
the first visit by a U.S. president to front-line troops since
Richard Nixon went to Vietnam in 1969.
   Bush was also to meet in Cairo with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and then on Friday in Geneva with Assad. It would be the
first meeting between a U.S. and Syrian president since President
Carter met Assad in 1977.
   Syria is a hard-line Arab state accused by the State Department
of sponsoring international terrorism and suppressing human rights.
But relations have warmed since Syria joined the U.S.-led coalition
against Iraq in August.
   The Syrians have promised 15,000 troops for the 350,000-strong
multinational force arrayed against Iraq. They face an estimated
460,000 Iraqi troops deployed in southern Iraq and Kuwait.

<HEAD>Council Agrees To Let Pension Fund Decide on Emergency Loan to
City</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TED DUNCOMBE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>

   The City Council voted 11-6 Wednesday to
authorize the city pension board to grant a loan back to the city,
which is due to run out of money next month.
   The emergency council meeting was attended by labor leaders who
fear the effect a loan to the city with its low credit rating would
have on a $1.5 billion pension fund.
   ``We're very much interested in helping the city find funding
sources, but not through our pension plan,'' Les Yost, president of
Philadelphia Fire Fighters Union, Local 22, International
Association of Fire Fighters, said Tuesday.
   The ordinance passed Wednesday does not order the pension board
to make the loan but removes a ban on such loans. The board has
hired an attorney to look into the legal issues.
   Mayor W. Wilson Goode and other Democratic leaders recently
urged the sale of $250 million to $300 million in short-term notes
to keep city coffers from running dry in December.
   The pension fund normally would not be allowed to invest in such
notes because the city's credit rating has fallen below junk-bond
levels to the lowest among major U.S. cities.
   The council vote allows the board to invest in Philadelphia
notes, regardless of quality, until July 1.
   ``The pension fund is the linchpin of a cash financing at this
point,'' Finance Director Elizabeth C. Reveal said last week.
   Pensioners and city employees counting on future pensions
bombarded council members to protest the plan.
   ``They don't trust the mayor,'' Councilman Francis Rafferty
said. ``That's the main beef. They're so afraid of this guy, and
their pension is the only thing they've got left.''   Rafferty co-sponsored
the legislation, but changed his mind and
voted against it.

   Boris N. Yeltsin said Wednesday the 15 Soviet
republics could no longer wait for approval of a new union treaty
and were proceeding on their own to create an economic union
separate from the Kremlin.
   Also Wednesday, Victor Alksnis, leader of a group of right-wing
legislators, threatened to call for Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev's resignation next month unless he ``begins at last to
carry out his promises to prevent a breakup of the country,'' the
newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya reported.
   The developments amounted to the harshest indictment of
Gorbachev since he proposed Saturday to dump his prime minister,
Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, and revamp the executive branch under his
presidential control.
   Russian President Yeltsin signed his republic's fourth bilateral
treaty with another republic Wednesday, after saying earlier he
could not be forced to accept Gorbachev's proposed union. That
treaty would redefine the relationship between all 15 republics and
the central government.
   Yeltsin's comments came as he continued butting heads with
Gorbachev. Their divergent plans for saving the economy and for
holding this nation of 285 million people together have paralyzed
power in their rival governments.
   Yeltsin is more popular domestically than Gorbachev. Wednesday's
actions indicated he was moving faster to consolidate his support
among the republics while refraining from taking a stand on
specific points of Gorbachev's plan.
   The Supreme Soviet legislature gave Gorbachev's proposals
initial approval, but will consider them further Friday.
   Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of the Central Asian
republic of Kazakhstan, signed a treaty Wednesday to set up direct
economic, political and cultural ties. Yeltsin signed a treaty
Monday with the Ukraine and treaties earlier with Moldavia and
Georgia.
   The five republics constitute more than two-thirds of the Soviet
population and most of its raw materials. Other republics have
signed bilateral treaties, but Russia is the focal point as the
strongest republic.
   Yeltsin said officials planned to sign a treaty with Byelorussia
in weeks.
   ``These bilateral treaties could constitute a major, solid
foundation for the future signing of a new union treaty,'' he told
a news conference in the Russian republic headquarters.
   ``They have to be signed to prevent chaos in the economy. They
will be a salvation, because personally, I don't believe the union
treaty will be signed in a week, in two weeks, in three weeks, even
a month.''
   Gorbachev, interviewed by French and Soviet TV reporters
Wednesday in Paris, was asked if he could form a ``government of
national unity'' with Yeltsin.
   He replied that he, Yeltsin and all Soviets ``are all tied
together with our responsibility for the destiny of the country,
and this ought to determine positions taken by each of those people
who were positioned to lead those changes as a result of a
democratic process.''
   ``I don't see any obstacles for cooperation on the basis of the
understanding of this responsibility.''
   On Saturday, Yeltsin had said he would consider a ``coalition''
government with Gorbachev.
   Alksnis, leader of the 500-member Soyuz group of
parliamentarians, said he and some colleagues would demand
Gorbachev's resignation unless he showed progress on solving the
country's problems during his address to the Congress of People's
Deputies session starting Dec. 17.
   Alksnis said his group had not yet taken an official stand on
the subject, but added ``this is not only my personal opinion,''
Sovietskaya Rossiya reported.
   What action Alksnis had in mind was unclear. Parliament rules
require a two-thirds vote by the 2,250-member body to ``recall''
the president.
   Alksnis also said the group wants Vadim Bakatin to resign as
interior minister. Bakatin came under fire from many republics for
dispatching Interior Ministry troops in areas hit by ethnic
violence.
   Yeltsin told reporters earlier Wednesday at the opening of a
historical exhibition that Gorbachev's proposed strengthening of
the national presidency seemed to be ``prepared in a hurry,
probably as a result of the debates in the Supreme Soviet, or
prompted by the staff of the Supreme Soviet or presidential
aides.''
   ``But they are not exactly logical, not quite consistent, for
one thing, and for another such things should be discussed and
adopted taking into account the will of the republics,'' he said,
without elaboration.
   He said the union treaty would be signed only if Russia's ``real
sovereignty'' is assured, either by the national president or the
legislature, and if issues are resolved over ownership of the
republic's bounty of gold, diamonds, oil, gas and other natural
resources.

<TEXT>
   A new poll Wednesday put a previously
unknown emigre in second place in Poland's first popular president
election, behind Lech Walesa but ahead of Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki.
   But the same survey, published days before Sunday's vote,
indicated Mazowiecki could pick up enough votes to beat Walesa if
they had to engage in a two-candidate runoff.
   The dark-horse candidacy of wealthy businessman Stanislaw
Tyminski, who has returned to Poland after 21 years of making his
fortune in Canada and Peru, created a sensation in Polish news
media. One commentator said Tyminski risks making Poland ``the
laughing stock of the world'' if he wins.
   Prosecutors have announced a slander investigation into
Tyminski's charge on Saturday that Mazowiecki committed treason
against Poland by creating economic chaos. But Tyminski continued
his sharp attacks while on the stump Wednesday, saying he supports
a wave of labor strikes against authorities.
   With campaigning required to end at noon Friday, Walesa was
making a last dash around the country and Mazowiecki, direct from
the Paris summit, drew one of his largest crowds to an evening
rally in Warsaw.
   ``I believe we will win in these elections!'' Mazowiecki told
more than 5,000 people at Warsaw Polytechnic Institute.
   ``There is no magic wand, there are no short cuts'' to repair
Poland's economy, he warned.
   He arrived in a horse-drawn cart he was coaxed into sharing with
four young women for a campaign picture.
   Solidarity chief Walesa, campaigning in Zamosc, said it would be
``something horrible'' to be in a runoff with Tyminski.
   ``He offers sausage to some people and they think he will save
Poland,'' he said. ``One must have some background, one even must
have been in prison here. One simply must have been living here.''
   The government polling service's random survey of 1,490 people
indicated Walesa had 27 percent of the vote, Tyminski 20 percent
and Mazowiecki 17 percent. The remaining three candidates shared a
total of 12 percent, and 24 percent were undecided or did not plan
to vote.
   If no candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote, the top
two finishers face a Dec. 9 runoff. The poll indicated that if
Walesa and Mazowiecki were in a runoff, 39 percent of those
surveyed would vote for Mazowiecki and 36 percent for Walesa.
   The polling agency said its survey was conducted Saturday and
Sunday, before the controversy over Tyminski gathered strength, and
has a 2 percent margin of error.
   ``I think the election results will not reflect the polls, on
the presumption that Poles are clever,'' said Piotr Nowina-Konopka,
who resigned as an undersecretary to outgoing President Wojciech
Jaruzelski on Wednesday to endorse Mazowiecki. Nowina-Konopka was
Walesa's longtime adviser before moving to Jaruzelski's chancellory
last year.
   Suddenly in the spotlight, Tyminski was being questioned about
his international business dealings, his past in Canada and Peru,
his long absence from Poland and his leadership of the ultra
right-wing Libertarian Party of Canada.
   ``Poland used to be the conscience of Europe and now we have a
chance to become the laughing stock of the world,'' Gazeta Wyborcza
editor Ernest Skalski wrote in a front-page commentary. ``If
Tyminski gets into the second round, Poland will stop being treated
seriously.''
   Appearing before thousands of supporters in Belchatow, Tyminski
said he was being ``fiercely attacked'' because of his standing in
the polls, according to the state PAP news agency - ``However, I am
not afraid that they will find something in my past.''
   PAP quoted Tyminski as saying he would ``support every strike,''
referring to recent labor unrest among miners and transit workers
demanding higher wages refused by the government. Walesa and other
candidates have tried to quell strikes at least until after
elections.
   Tyminski gets free television and radio advertising time under
newly democratic Poland's evenhanded election law. The press has
tried to give roughly equal news coverage to all six candidates.
   Because he was given almost no chance, Tyminski escaped
criticism until now.
   Tyminski, 42, describes himself as a self-made millionaire who
left Poland penniless and made fortunes in Canada and the Amazon
port of Iquitos, Peru. According to his campaign, he runs
Transduction Ltd., a suburban Toronto computer automation company.
   He leads the Libertarian Party of Canada, a fringe party that
has no representatives in Parliament.

<HEAD>No Charges Filed Against Dallas Commissioner at Center of Racial
Tensions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors announced Wednesday that they would
not pursue criminal charges against a black county commissioner
whose dispute with a Hispanic policeman inflamed racial tensions.
   The district attorney's office decided not to try to bring
Dallas County Commissioner John Wiley Price to trial on an arrest
in March for painting over billboards with tobacco and alcohol ads
in predominantly black neighborhoods.
   Price previously was allowed to take six months' probation in
the sign-painting without the case going to trial. But after an
incident in which a policeman accused him of pointing a submachine
gun Nov. 5, prosecutors sought to revoke that probation and a judge
agreed to hold a hearing that could have led to a trial and
conviction.
   Price, who at one time issued a ``call to arms'' over the choice
of a police chief, and police Officer Robert Bernal reached a truce
during 12 hours of talks late Tuesday and early Wednesday.
   Bernal emerged from the talks saying he wanted the district
attorney to drop the case, and a grand jury later agreed.
   ``Both Commissioner Price and Officer Bernal wish the incident
had never occurred and apologize to the citizens of Dallas that
their actions contributed to discord at a time when the city needed
harmony,'' Price and Bernal said in a joint statement Wednesday.
   Bernal had told his superiors that Price pointed an Uzi gun at
his head in retaliation for an insult the officer yelled at Price
as he jogged past the commissioner's home. Price contended he was
holding a pellet gun, which he denies pointing at Bernal.
   For his part, Price said: ``Officer Bernal is probably one of
many police officers who have been thrust into communities that
they probably know nothing about and have frustrations that are
mounting.''
   Acting Police Chief Sam Gonzales said an internal affairs
investigation into Bernal's conduct was continuing. But he
indicated discipline for Bernal could be tempered by his efforts to
resolve his dispute with Price.
   ``We would be remiss if we didn't look at what he may have done
to ease the tensions in this city,'' Gonzales said.
   Bernal's lawyer, Bob Baskett, said Wednesday he was not
surprised that police would continue their internal investigation.
   ``It causes me no concern ... because we are confident that such
an investigation will not result in any disciplinary action against
(Bernal),'' he said.
   Some civic leaders have said the recent discord surrounding the
incident could threaten a Dec. 8 vote on a proposed
single-member-district city council system that proponents say
would allow minorities more voice in the city's government.

   Gen. George A. Joulwan took over
as chief of the U.S. Southern Command on Wednesday and vowed to
help Latin American nations fight drug trafficking and terrorism.
   The vice director of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. David
E. Jeremiah, formally gave the command to Joulwan in a ceremony at
Howard Air Force Base near the Panama Canal.
   He replaces Gen. Maxwell Thurman, who directed the military
invasion of Panama last December. Thurman has retired after 37
years of military service.
   Joulwan told his audience that drug trafficking is ``a threat
for the Latin American region and for the United States,'' and said
the U.S. is ready to help local nations combat it.
   Joulwan, a Vietnam combat veteran who has also served in Europe
and Washington, is responsible for all U.S. military activities in
Latin America.
   Taking part in the ceremony were Panamanian Vice Presidents
Ricardo Arias Calderon and Guillermo Ford, as well as U.S.
Ambassador Deane Hinton.

   The State Department sharply accused Burma's
military government Wednesday of persecuting two opposition leaders
who this week were sentenced to 10 years in prison.
   ``We are dismayed by the sentences ... we strongly condemn this
action,'' department spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters. ``We
again call upon the military authorities in Burma to release
political prisoners and to heed the overwhelming call for
parliamentary democracy of the May elections,'' he added.
   The two who were sentenced, Kyi Maung and Chit Khaing, officials
of the National League for Democracy, ``are clearly being
persecuted by the regime in a further effort to negate the results
of the national elections in May which the league won by a large
margin,'' Boucher said.
   The league won more than 80 percent of the 485 seats in the
national parliament.
   The arrest and sentencing of the two opposition leaders has been
described as the Burmese military's toughest move thus far against
the party which has been prevented from taking office.
   Kyi Maung and Chit Khaing were among the successful
parliamentary candidates of the National League for Democracy.
   Political sources in Rangoon have reported that authorities have
arrested at least 50 other members of the party, including about 15
elected to parliament, since the end of October.

   Ava Gardner's many pairs of shoes sold briskly at
an auction of the late actress' effects Wednesday that netted
$678,000.
   Ms. Gardner, the sensous star of ``Show Boat,'' ``The Barefoot
Contessa,'' ``On the Beach'' and scores of other films, died in
January at age 67. She had lived in London since 1968.
   The 78 pairs of shoes were sold in six lots. One lot of 10
pairs, including Gucci loafers and stilettos by other designers,
went for $1,270.
   The highest-priced item was a Louis XVI-period French bureau
table, made about 1785, went for $73,300 dollars.
   ``There were many private buyers present who wanted a memento of
a very beautiful actress,'' said Nigel Semmens, the auctioneers'
spokesman.
   None of the buyers was identified. A man who paid $4,700 for an
embroidered matador cape in ivory satin said it was a 21st birthday
present for his daughter.

<HEAD>Court Rules No Plagiary from `Gone With the Wind'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court overturned a lower ruling and said
Wednesday that French novelist Regine Deforges' best-seller, ``The
Blue Bicycle,'' is not based on Margaret Mitchell's 1936 epic
``Gone with the Wind.''
   A civil court in Paris ruled last December that the work
borrowed heavily from the American Civil War romance classic. It
ordered Miss Deforges and her publisher to pay $400,000 in damage
to the Trust Company Bank, which manages the rights to Miss
Mitchell's works.
   But Appeals Judge Myriam Ezratty said ``The Blue Bicycle,'' the
first volume of a trilogy published from 1982-84 by Editions
Ramsay, was ``not even a partial plagiarism'' of ``Gone with the
Wind.''
   The ruling said, ``The theme of a young girl who falls head over
heels in love with a man who loves another woman, and at the same
time is loved by a man older than she, is hardly original.''
   Miss Deforges told a reporter last year, ``I know what
plagiarism is, and it's a very bad thing. From the beginning `Blue
Bicycle' was intended to be a pastiche. I never said it was
suypposed to be anything else.''
   Her book, set in Nazi-occupied France, has sold at least 6
million copies.
   French law forbids plagiarism, but permits pastiche, which it
defines as a humorous take-off or remake of a recognizable original
text.

   Ethiopia appealed Wednesday for
more than 800,000 tons of emergency aid to feed some of the 4.3
million people it says could starve next year.
   Ethiopia's appeal for aid comes as neighboring Sudan, also hit
by drought, faces a famine that Western relief officials say
threatens an estimated 11 million Sudanese.
   The number of threatened people in the two countries, by these
counts, is roughly equal to the combined populations of New York
City, Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston.
   In Sudan, where drought has made some land barren for the first
time this century, the government has refused to recognize the
threat of famine or appeal for aid, calling the problem a temporary
``food shortfall.''
   But Ethiopia, reeling from rebel battlefield defeats and on the
lookout for new foreign supporters with Soviet aid diminished,
relief officials have appealed for international help.
   Ethiopia is ``again confronted with the task of trying to save
the lives of over 4 million innocent Ethiopians, most of whom face
such a problem for the second successive year in a very difficult
environment,'' said Yilma Kassaye, head of the state Relief and
Rehabilitation Commission.
   Many of the victims are in the war-ravaged northern provinces of
Eritrea and Tigre, he said at a meeting with foreign ambassadors
and representatives of aid agencies.
   The rebel Eritrean People's Liberation Front, which has been
fighting the government for 30 years, earlier this year captured
the Red Sea port of Massawa, Ethiopia's only deep-water harbor and
a past gateway for relief to the north.
   The rebels have rejected appeals by the United Nations and the
Ethiopian government to reopen the port, saying it would be used to
resupply an estimated 100,000 government soldiers besieged in the
Eritrean provincial capital of Asmara.
   The United Nations and the government have been airlifting food
and other supplies to Asmara, where about 1 million civilians are
trapped.
   Although the rebels truck relief of their own from neighboring
Sudan, aid officials say it isn't enough to feed everyone in the
two provinces.
   The famine could surpass the 1984-85 tragedy in which 1 million
Ethiopians died, said Kassaye.
   Timothy Painter, the representative for the U.N. Development
Program in Ethiopia, described the government's estimate of
potential devastation as ``fairly accurate.''
   Kassaye said satellite photographs and unofficial reports
indicate a major shortfall in food production in Tigre, which is
controlled by the Tigre People's Liberation Front, a smaller
insurgency.
   The provinces of Wollo and Harar in eastern Ethiopia are also
threatened, Kassaye said.
   A consortium of Ethiopian churches has been transporting 4,000
tons of emergency food a month to southern Tigre and Wollo from
Assab, Ethiopia's second port. But the journey is much longer than
it would be from Massawa.

   A free Thanksgiving lunch for the homeless
sent more than two dozen people to hospitals with food poisoning
Wednesday.
   ``It's not a pretty sight,'' Brackenridge Hospital spokesman
Larry BeSaw said.
   Officials said the meal had been donated by a church and served
to about 300 people at a downtown-area soup kitchen called the
Austin Baptist Chapel.
   Between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m., some of those who ate the lunch of
turkey sandwiches and turkey soup started becoming ill.
   ``It looks like a pretty straight case of food poisoning,'' said
Sue Noffke, of the Austin-Travis County Health Department.
   The city's emergency medical service set up a command post at
the Salvation Army shelter, where many of the homeless went after
lunch. Sally Muir, an EMS spokeswoman, said 28 people had been
taken to three hospitals by 6 p.m.
   Police were told to look out for other homeless people with
similar symptoms, said Dan Pickens of the city-county health
department. He said the church provided a food sample for
laboratory tests.
   Ms. Noffke said people with food poisoning usually recover
quickly, but many of those who got sick were in poor health to
begin with.

<HEAD>Brazil President Asks Critics to Stop Attacks Against Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Fernando Collor de Mello
called Wednesday for business leaders to sacrifice some of their
profits to help the government improve the economy.
   In a 10-minute nationwide TV and radio address, Collor said
inflation was the country's gravest problem and said he would not
alter his severe inflation-fighting plan, which has provoked
recession and rising unemployment.
   ``I never said the transition would be easy,'' said Collor.
``One cannot defeat 30 years of inflationary culture easily.
   ``But we are on the right path,'' he said. ``We can't get ahead
of ourselves and fall into the temptation of using attacks,
thinking that will bring about change.''
   Collor has been under a barrage of criticism from businessmen,
politicians and labor leaders. Several former political allies have
resigned this month, accusing the government of fraud and
corruption.
   ``There are those who know only how to criticize,'' said
Collor.``We've had enough of those who only know how to oppose,
without realizing they do not oppose me, but to the new Brazil.''
   Bankruptcies and joblessness are on the rise. Inflation has been
steadily climbing since May and economists say it will hit 20
percent in December.
   That is down from a monthly rate in March of 90 percent, and
Collor insisted his eight-month-old administration had ``done away
with the ghost of hyperinflation.''
   He blamed resurging inflation on the doubling of world oil
prices as a result of the gulf crisis, and on corporate leaders for
their failure to reduce large profit margins.
   ``We had not expected that a some would be anti-patriotic enough
to continue to abusively mark up prices, for profits without
comparison in the world,'' he said.

<HEAD>Counselor to Rape Victim Fired for Signing Publication Contract</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The coordinator of a witness-victim
protection program was fired Wednesday for signing a contract for
movie and book rights in the rape case of a woman who doctors say
has 46 personalities.
   The same day she was fired, Shelia Carmichael filed a letter
with the trial judge alleging that the woman was still being
sexually exploited by another person, described as a close
acquaintance.
   Winnebago County District Attorney Joseph Paulus said Ms.
Carmichael was fired for breaking county rules that prohibited her
from profiting from her role as a counselor to the victim in the
widely publicized case.
   Ms. Carmichael signed a contract along with three prosecution
witnesses in the case that would have guaranteed her 20 percent of
any profits the victim received from any books or movie about the
case, he said.
   Ms. Carmichael said the victim wanted her to be involved in the
deal and that she received no financial compensation.
   Paulus called Ms. Carmichael's actions deplorable and compared
them to the man convicted this month of exploiting the mentally ill
woman by manipulating one of her personalities to have sex with
her.
   ``It was always the state's position that the victim had been
manipulated by the defendant. It's very unfortunate and despicable
that this has to happen all over again,'' the prosecutor said.
   Ms. Carmichael said she never intended to exploit the victim and
had signed a very limited partnership agreement with three
prosecution witnesses on Nov. 14, six days after the rape trial
ended.
   She said she signed the deal at the request of the 27-year-old
victim to ensure that any publication or movie deals would be
handled properly.
   ``She (the victim) was very concerned about how she would be
portrayed in anything that would arise from all of this,'' Ms.
Carmichael said. ``She wanted to make sure I was involved in all of
this.
   Paulus said he would investigate the new allegation that the
victim was still being sexually exploited.
   ``We already asked the victim and she denied that it is true. I
don't know whether it is true but we'll look into it. If the victim
denies it is true, I'm not sure there's much we can do,'' Paulus
said.
   He also questioned Ms. Carmichael's motives for filing the
letter with Judge Robert A. Hawley the same day she was fired. In
the letter, Ms. Carmichael alleged Paulus knew about past and
current sexual exploitation of the woman and didn't bring them up
to ensure a conviction.
   George Curtis, a lawyer for the victim, said his client was
``somewhat overwhelmed'' by the report of continuing sexual
explotation.
   Jurors convicted Mark Peterson on second-degree sexual assault
on Nov. 8.
   Prosecutors argued that the 29-year-old unemployed grocery
bagger knew the woman was mentally ill and unable to consent to
sex. They said he manipulated one of her vunerable personalities to
have sex with him in a park just two days after meeting her.
   Peterson's trial included eerie testimony from six of the
victim's personalities.
   Peterson faces a maximum of 10 years in prison when he is
sentenced Dec. 10 but has hired a lawyer to appeal the verdict. He
has maintained he didn't know the woman was mentally ill until
after they had sex.

<HEAD>State Farm Insurance Settles Discrimination Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has approved settlement of a
class-action lawsuit that claimed State Farm Insurance Companies
discriminated against minorities and women in its Texas region.
   Under the settlement approved Tuesday by U.S. District Judge
David Hittner, State Farm will distribute $12 million. It will go
to the seven women who filed the lawsuit last year and to qualified
Hispanics, blacks and women who were not hired, recruited or
promoted in agent or representative trainee jobs before 1984.
   State Farm also agreed to establish a fund for scholarships,
insurance training classes and recruitment of women and minorities.
   Company lawyers said in a statement that the settlement did not
constitute an admission by State Farm that it had violated Title
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment
discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex and
national origin.
   The lawsuit was filed by seven women who said they were
unlawfully denied positions as State Farm trainee agents and field
claim representatives between 1975 and 1983. They had sought $100
million in damages.
   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission joined in the
lawsuit.
   It accused State Farm of reserving the jobs of sales agents,
claims adjusters and underwriters for white men. At the time, the
895 agents in the company's Texas region included 126 women and 125
minorities.
   State Farm's Texas region, headquartered in Austin, covered the
southern half of Texas, including Houston, San Antonio, Austin and
El Paso. The remainder of State Farm's Texas operations,
headquartered in Dallas, was not affected by the lawsuit.
   In a similar case in California, State Farm agreed in 1988 to
name women to half its sales agents jobs and pay millions of
dollars to women who contended they were discriminated against from
1974 to 1987.
   That lawsuit accused State Farm of refusing to recruit women on
the same basis as men for agent jobs and discouraging women from
applying for the lucrative jobs.
   According to the lawsuit, although 80 percent of all State Farm
employees in California were women, 98 percent of its agents were
men.

<TEXT>
   Soviet television reported that an airliner
carrying more than 170 people crashed Wednesday in the Siberian
city of Yakutsk, but airport officials and a news agency said
nobody was hurt.
   Soviet television reported Wednesday evening that 176 people
were killed when the Aeroflot airliner crashed in Yakutsk, a city
about 2,700 miles east of Moscow. It offered no source for its
report.
   However, Marina Potapova, a shift supervisor at the Magan
Airport in Yakutsk, said nobody was killed when the Ilyushin-62
arriving from Moscow at Wednesday overshot the runway while landing
and came to rest near a small lake.
   She said in a telephone interview that none of the 174
passengers aboard was seriously injured, and many continued on to
their destinations. She said she had no idea whether any foreigners
were on board.
   Valentin Popov, an inspector at the airport, also said by
telephone that there were no casualties. He said the plane carried
174 passengers and 10 crew, and that five people were slightly
injured.
   The independent Postfactum news agency also reported the crash
and said there were no injuries. It said the aircraft struck ground
installations and was seriously damaged.
   The television report said the plane's wings were torn off
during the crash.
   However, Ms. Potapova said the plane was still in one piece.
   She and Popov said the airliner was diverted to Magan, the
city's second airport, because of poor visibility at the main
Yakutsk airport.
   A special commission has been set up to investigate the
incident, she said.

<TEXT>
   With about 85 percent of the votes
counted on Wednesday, nationalist parties appeared headed for a
landslide victory over Communists in Bosnia-Hercegovina's first
free elections since 1938.
   The election last Sunday in the central, multi-ethnic state
could decide the fate of Yugoslavia as a federation of six
republics and two provinces.
   Serbia's Communist leader, Slobodan Milosevic, himself faced
with Dec. 9 elections and with his party's failing popularity,
addressed a hastily organized mass rally on Wednesday.
   The Moslem Union for Democratic Action was leading in four of
Bosnia-Hercegovina's seven constituences; the Serbian Democratic
Alliance was ahead in two, and the Croatian Democratic Union in
one.
   Indications were that the three nationalist parties probably
would capture about 80 percent of the 240 seats in the republic's
two-house parliament.
   Pre-election favorites, the reformed League of Communists and
federal Prime Minister Ante Markovic's Alliance of Reform Forces,
were trailing and looked set to split the remaining seats with
several small parties.
   Both had campaigned across ethnic groupings and for the
preservation of a united Yugoslavia. They had warned that a
nationalist victory could set off violence.
   According to the results, the Communists, who have led the
republic since 1945, would not be represented in the region's
seven-seat presidency.
   The Communists were ousted earlier in the westernmost republics
of Slovenia and Croatia. New, center-right governments there want
Yugoslavia transformed into a loose association of near-independent
states.
   Slovenia's parliament on Wednesday debated holding a referendum
January on the republic's possible secession from the federation.
   Such moves have pitted the western republics against Serbia and
the other, poorer southern republics that want power to stay
centralized in Belgrade, the federal and Serbian capital.
   Bosnia-Hercegovina has steered a neutral and independent course
in the feuding and the final outcome of its elections could tip the
balance.
   The republic's 4.2 million people include Serbs, Croats and
Moslems. It is geographically and politically at the heart of
Yugoslavia's bitter ethnic rivalries.
   Serbia and Croatia flank Bosnia-Hercegovina, and have previously
made territorial claims on it.
   Serbia's Milosevic spoke at a rally in Nis, 125 miles south of
Belgrade. Organizers said 200,000 attended. Independent sources
estimated the crowd as up to 100,000.
   Milosevic accused Serbia's opposition parties of
``primitivism.'' He said the opposition derided his party for
alleged past mistakes but failed to offer solutions for the future.
   Polls conducted by Serbia's independent newspapers indicate
Milosevic and his party are rapidly losing supporters to the
center-right Serbian Renewal Movement and its nationalist leader,
Vuk Draskovic.
   In Slovenia, polls indicate most of the 2 million people in the
republic, Yugoslavia's most prosperous, want more independence, or
even secession from the federation.

<TEXT>
   Divers believe they have found a Civil
War-era Union gunboat at the bottom of the Tennessee River and they
hope eventually to raise it for a museum.
   ``They found it right where we expected it to be. We pretty much
feel that it's the Undine,'' John Latham said of Tuesday's
discovery.
   He is an organizer of Raise the Gunboats Inc., a non-profit
organization whose goal is to raise and display one or more of four
paddle wheel gunboats scuttled by Union forces.
   The Undine was the largest of the four sunk in 1864 after
Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest closed in on the Union
military depot of Johnsonville.
   ``More of one end is covered than another,'' he said. ``It's in
about 40 feet of water and covered with silt.''
   ``One of the divers found, and we're real excited about this,
the hub of what is believed to be the paddle wheel,'' said Latham,
owner of a Camden radio station.
   He said they also found an artillery shell about 10 inches long
and 4 or 5 inches in diameter near the boat on the river.
   Although the Undine was set afire when it was deliberately sunk,
Latham said divers believe the damage was confined to the top deck.
   ``They pulled out some pegs and they were burned on the surface
but down in the wood they weren't,'' he said.
   Despite being underwater for 125 years, the ship's wooden frame
is believed intact.
   ``Some wood was brought off of it. It was white oak and
well-preserved. You could nail into it,'' Latham said.
   The ship's location was marked with buoys so divers can return
to it easily.
   ``Now we're going to begin looking for the others,'' said
Latham, referring to the remaining gunboats, the Key West, Tawah
and Elfin.
   Raise the Gunboats is a cooperative venture among residents of
Humphreys and Benton counties, which are separated by the Tennessee
River.
   In addition to a gunboat museum, the group's plans include an
observation tower and rebuilding the town of Johnsonville, which
was inundated when Kentucky Lake was created.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Elias Hrawi promised on
Wednesday to create a militia-free ``greater Beirut'' despite
right-wing Christian defiance of a government deadline for
reunifying the capital.
   ``Greater Beirut is coming and no one will be able to prevent
its emergence,'' Hrawi said in a televised speech.
   The president indicated he would not use force, however, to make
the6,000-strong Lebanese Forces withdraw from districts it still
holds in eastern Beirut. The Forces, under Samir Geagea, make up
the Christians' main militia.
   ``We are dealing with the problem in a responsible, fatherly
spirit. Greater Beirut is to end the war,'' Hrawi said.
   His government had set a 10-day timetable for all militias to
withdraw with their weapons from the capital and its environs by
Nov. 19 so reunification of the war-divided capital could be
formally proclaimed.
   Druse and Shiite Moslem militias complied. But Geagea demanded
expulsion first of the estimated 1,500 militiamen of his main
Christian rival, Syrian-backed Elie Hobeika, from the Christian
heartland.
   They had returned to the heartland after Hrawi's troops, backed
by Syrian army units, crushed an 11-month mutiny by rebel Gen.
Michel Aoun on Oct. 13.
   ``We are not against greater Beirut, but we want it to be built
on solid foundations,'' Geagea said in an interview with his TV
station shortly before Hrawi broadcast his speech.
   ``We don't want anarchists turned loose after we pull out to
ransack, loot, kidnap and torture our partisans,'' Geagea said.
   Geagea deposed Hobeika in a January 1986 power struggle.
   Organizing a greater Beirut is a key element in a peace plan
brokered by the Arab League to end 15 years of civil war between
Moslems and Christians.
   Hrawi said, ``The accomplishment of greater Beirut is the
cornerstone of national reconciliation. There will be no compromise
or tolerance with anyone seeking to block it, to destroy the state
and partition Lebanon.''
   Like Geagea and Hobeika, Hrawi is a Maronite Catholic, the
largest Christian sect that has dominated power in Lebanon since
independence from France in 1943. He was elected president by
parliament on Nov. 24, 1989.

   Germans got an inside view Wednesday of
the underground bunker ousted East German leader Erich Honecker
built to protect himself and leading Communist Party officials in
event of war.
   Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg led journalists and TV
camera crews on a tour of the bunker, nearly 80 feet underground in
Prenden. It is 30 miles north of Berlin and about a 10-minute drive
from suburban Wandlitz, where Honecker and leading party
functionaries lived.
   Stoltenberg said Germany will decide soon what to do with it.
   ``We have no use for this central set-up,'' he added.
   The bunker, completed in 1983, can accommodate 350 people; has
20-foot-thick walls, contains a computerized headquarters that
allows contact with the outside in event of war, and includes
hospital facilities, bedrooms and an office for Honecker with TV
and telephone.
   Honecker, toppled last year, briefly visited the bunker once, in
1984, officials said.

<TEXT>
   A murder trial of fugitive cocaine boss
Pablo Escobar has resumed after years of delay caused by the
assassination of an attorney and a judge in the case, a court
official said Wednesday.
   Pablo Escobar and nine other defendents are accused of the
December 1986 murder of Guillermo Cano, a prominent newspaper
publisher.
   Escobar, the leader of the notorious Medellin cocaine cartel, is
in hiding and will stand trial in absentia, the court source said.
   Escobar has been blamed for the murder of hundreds of Colombians
and the government is offering $500,000 for information leading to
his capture, dead or alive.
   Authorities said Escobar ordered the murder of Cano, publisher
of the Bogota daily El Espectador, who had been an outspoken
opponent of drug trafficking and the moral toll it is taking on
Colombia.
   Members of the Cano family were present at Tuesday's resumption
of the murder trial. In March 1989, the family's prosecuting
lawyer, Hector Giraldo, was murdered by drug-backed assassins.
   The law in many Latin American countries permits people to hire
their own lawyers to collect prosecutorial evidence in a case.
   The family did not name a prosecuting lawyer to replace Giraldo
because of fear such a lawyer would also be killed. The government
alone is prosecuting the defendents.
   In August 1989, drug killers murdered Carlos Valencia, a judge
involved in the case.
   The trial was postponed four times because of the murders,
changes in the judges hearing the case, and legal maneuvers by the
defense, the court official said.
   The three jurors and the judge hearing the present round of
deliberations are receiving special police protection, officials
said.
   Top drug bosses have so far managed to bribe or threaten
judicial officials into letting them go free.
   On Tuesday, the government announced a comprehensive plan to
reform Colombia's courts. About 500 well-protected ``invisible
judges,'' whose identities will be kept secret, will hear drug- or
terrorism-related cases, Justice Minister Jaime Giraldo said at a
news conference.
   The Medellin gang has been blamed for killing about 550
Colombians since the government and drug traffickers declared war
on each other in August 1989, following the assassination of
presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan.
   The slain politician's widow, Gloria Pachon de Galan, published
an open letter to Presdient Cesar Gaviria in major newspapers
Wednesday calling on the government to respect human rights in its
drug investigations.
   The cartel has been claiming that police, especially judicial
police under Col. Oscar Pelaez, are torturing and murdering its
associates in Medellin, Colombia's second largest city.
   The traffickers' latest intimidation scheme has been to kidnap
nine journalists.
   One of them is the widow Galan's sister.
   Pelaez is being replaced as head of the police and reassigned to
the Colombian embassy in the United States, police spokesman Maj.
Jorge Martin told the Associated Press.
   He called the change ``routine.''

   A radio station received hundreds of guns in just
under an hour Wednesday in a cash-for-weapons campaign to observe
the 27th anniversary of the assassination of President Kennedy.
   ``We thought we'd get about 50 to 100 guns so we brought about
$12,000. We went through that much in 47 minutes,'' said KQKS
program director Dave Van Stone. ``We were caught very surprised by
the response to this thing.''
   The station resorted to handing out vouchers and promising those
who gave up their guns could collect their money next week.
   Under the ``Get Guns Off the Streets'' promotion, the radio
station paid $104 for every gun turned in - no names, no questions,
no police, the station said.
   The drive was promoted by on-air spots featuring District
Attorney Norm Early, police officials and political leaders.
   Early said more than 300 guns were recovered, including
sawed-off shotguns, automatic weapons and handguns that police will
help the station destroy.
   ``Was that great or what?'' said Early.
   Van Stone said the station received many guns that were worth
more than $104, and people cited many reasons for getting rid of
them.
   ``A number of people that were parents and had the gun in the
house and really didn't know how to get rid of it. I think they
brought them by because the guns will be destroyed,'' he said.
   Similar drives have been held by radio stations in Austin,
Texas, Charlotte, N.C., and three Denver-area churches.
   President Kennedy was shot on Nov. 22, 1963.

<TEXT>
   A prominent photographer asked a federal
court Wednesday to force authorities to return photos and other
property it has held for seven months while deciding whether to
charge him with child pornography.
   Jock Sturges, whose nude portraits, many of them of children,
are displayed in major galleries across the country, contends
police illegally searched and ransacked his San Francisco home last
April.
   Papers he filed in U.S. District Court say the FBI confiscated
100,000 photo negatives and numerous other items.
   Police have returned some of the material but turned the rest
over to the U.S. attorney's office, which says it is still
investigating to determine whether to seek an indictment against
Sturges.
   Meanwhile, the photographer and his lawyer said, the FBI has
been calling around the world to the families of everyone he has
photographed, and every gallery that displays his work, telling
them he is a pornographer and child molester and hunting for any
possible evidence against him.
   ``It's evidence of a government that's run amok,'' Sturges said
at a news conference.
   ``It does not take seven months to study a handful of pictures -
unless, of course, you become obsessed with them,'' added attorney
Michael Metzger.
   The case started when a photo lab employee told the FBI that a
roll of color negatives contained 22 nude pictures of young girls.
Joseph Semien, a fellow photographer and developer who had
submitted the film, was arrested and charged by local authorities
with child pornography, charges that were later suspended.
   Sturges said his photo enlarger was returned, badly damaged, and
many of the negatives he has recovered were also damaged. He said
most of his commercial customers, a separate part of his business,
canceled their accounts after learning of the investigation, but he
has continued his artistic work, and has recouped some of the
income through increased sales of prints.
   Asked when the case might be resolved, U.S. Attorney William
McGivern said, ``We can't pin ourselves to deadlines, either
imposed by potential defendants or imposed by the press.''
   He said ``senior prosecutors'' in his office were still
reviewing the case and had not yet decided whether to ask him to
seek a grand jury indictment.
   FBI spokesman Duke Diedrich said Sturges' photographs were being
examined by experts on child pornography who ``know it when they
see it.''
   Metzger showed reporters what he said was a representative
sample of the photographs presented by police to Municipal Court
Judge Philip Moscone, who issued a warrant to search Sturges' home.
The pictures included nudes of children, none of them in
particularly sexual or provocative poses.
   ``If you find yourself sexually stimulated, we have the name of
a good psychiatrist,'' Metzger said.
   He argued that neither the pictures nor anything police saw when
they forced their way into Sturges' home provided evidence of
criminal activity that justified a search warrant.
   Metzger also argued that the warrant was overly broad and
allowed seizures of all papers, children's toys, and even the
kitchen sink, since it could have been used to process photos.

   President Najibullah of Afghanistan said Wednesday
he had talks in Geneva with leaders of the Afghan resistance that
paved the way for restoring peace in the country after 12 years of
war.
   He told reporters at U.N. headquarters in Geneva the talks were
on how to go about achieving a political solution and left him
``very much satisfied.''
   ``A cornerstone has been laid for opening talks and dialogue and
for advancing the process as well as the implementation of the
peace process,'' he said. ``No doubt it will bear fruit.''
   Najibullah then left for Bern, the Swiss capital, where he
scheduled a meeting with parliamentarians. One deputy, Gilles
Petitpierre, said plans for an Afghanistan peace conference in
Switzerland was a likely topic.
   Najibullah would identify the resistance leaders only as
``prominent personalities of the opposition side'' and did not say
when they met. He declined comment when asked if they included Pir
Sayed Ahmed Gailani, leader of the National Islamic Front in
Afghanistan.
   Gailani leads the most moderate faction in the alliance of seven
anti-government groups. Rumors in Islamaba, Pakistan, said he was
in Geneva.
   Marxists seized power in Afghanistan in 1978. In December 1979,
one Marxist government succeeded another in a coup and invited in
more than 100,000 Soviet troops. An insurrection by Moslem
guerrillas, known as mujahedeen, began soon afterward and
continues, although the Soviets completed withdrawal of their
troops in February 1989.
   Najibullah said conditions for a political solution were
favorable. He said his government had embarked on a democratic
course providing for a free press, party pluralism and a more
Western-like structure of government.
   He said a growing understanding between the United States and
the Soviet Union could contribute to the peace process.
   He singled out Pakistan as being chiefly responsible for the
continued Afghan civil war and accused Pakistan of preventing
Afghan refugees from returning home.
   Nearly 3 million Afghans fled to adjoining Pakistan over the
past decade, and Afghan guerrilla operations have been based there.
   Najibullah said he hoped the new Pakistan leadership would
embark on a ``sound course.''
   ``If they move one step forward we will move 10 steps,'' he
said.

   Attorneys for Peter MacDonald have
appealed the suspended Navajo chairman's criminal convictions to
the tribal Supreme Court, while MacDonald's lawyer-son and
co-defendant has filed his own appeal.
   Attorneys for the elder MacDonald filed his appeal late Tuesday.
Peter ``Rocky'' MacDonald Jr. filed his Wednesday.
   The father and son were convicted Oct. 17 in tribal District
Court on charges alleging that the senior MacDonald accepted bribes
and kickbacks from businessmen operating on the reservation.
   Salt Lake City attorneys Ronald Yengish and Earl Xaiz cited
numerous fair-trial issues in their request for a reversal of
MacDonald's conviction or a new trial.
   MacDonald's lawyers noted that his trial attorneys, who are not
representing him in the appeal, ``spent a considerable amount of
time attempting to withdraw from the case.''
   The appeal filed by Rocky MacDonald, a lawyer who lives in San
Jose, Calif., asked the tribal high court to order him released on
his own recognizance pending appeal because he is too poor to post
bond.
   Rocky MacDonald argued several of his rights were violated,
partly because of public testimony he gave under subpoena before a
Senate committee in February 1989 under a grant of immunity.
   Prosecutors have 20 days to file responses to the appeals with
the court, but special prosecutor Robert Rothstein said Wednesday
his firm would fight to maintain the convictions.
   ``We will take whatever steps necessary to uphold the verdict,''
Rothstein said. ``It's our position there was no error in the
trials. We will certainly address whatever arguments they may
raise.''
   Both MacDonalds were released Nov. 15 from the tribe's Window
Rock jail where they'd been held, with the exception of one
weekend, since being sentenced Oct. 22 by Judge Robert Yazzie. His
order for the MacDonalds' release said it was temporary and
intended to enable them to assist their attorneys with appeals and
prepare for the defendants' next trial.
   The father and son are scheduled to go on trial in tribal
District Court Tuesday on conspiracy charges from the tribe's
purchase of a ranch.
   The father and another defendant faces trial later on
election-law charges stemming from the tribe's 1986 election.

<HEAD>Army Says National Guard Combat Units to Mobilize by Nov. 30</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS grafs 3-6: ``The announcement,'' reports of discharges
to be frozen</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Guard combat brigades from Georgia,
Louisiana and Mississippi will be put on active duty in about a
week for possible deployment to the Persian Gulf, the Army said
Wednesday.
   They will be augmented by National Guard combat units from
Alabama, South Carolina and Texas to create a combined fighting
force of about 15,100 soldiers, the Army said.
   The announcement was followed by reports that the Army had
decided to halt retirements and discharges, as well as transfers
unrelated to the Persian Gulf deployment, for the present.
   The Washington Post said Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney had
given the services authority to hold personnel in the service under
a presidential order issued in August, and the Army had decided to
use it. Normally, 5 percent to 7 percent of the 760,000 soldiers in
the Army would leave each month.
   CBS News broadcast a similar report. Wednesday evening, Pentagon
spokesman Lt. Col. Stuart Wagner said he had no information on the
subject.
   Separately, the Air Force announced it was sending an
unspecified number of OA-10 low-level observation aircraft to the
Arabian Peninsula for Operation Desert Shield, and the Navy ordered
to active duty 875 reservists from 13 states and the District of
Columbia.
   The Air Force OA-10 planes, which are used to direct air and
ground fire at enemy armored vehicles, are deploying Saturday from
Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Ariz.
   More than 77,000 reservists from all military services already
have been called up for Desert Shield. It is the largest reserve
activation since the 1961 Berlin crisis.
   Included in the Army statement was the first official mention
that two active divisions - the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized)
of Fort Carson, Colo., and the 5th Infantry Division (Mechanized)
of Fort Polk., La. - may be sent to the gulf as further
reinforcements beyond the deployments already announced.
   Maj. Joseph Allred, an Army spokesman, said deployment of the
divisions from Fort Carson and Fort Polk was ``an option'' now
available, but that no firm decision had been made on whether or
when they would be used in Desert Shield.
   The Guard brigade from Mississippi will be assigned to the 4th
Infantry Division and the unit from Louisiana will be made part of
the 5th Infantry Division, bringing both of those heavy units to
full three-brigade strength, the Army said.
   The Army said the divisions, with their National Guard brigades,
could be used as additions to the force now in Saudi Arabia or as
rotation forces to replace units that have been there since early
in the crisis sparked by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The Army announcement, following two days of official Pentagon
confusion over an activation date for the Georgia, Mississippi and
Louisiana brigades, means that the first Army combat units of
citizen-soldiers could be digging in against Iraqi troops by early
next year.
   No decision on sending them to Saudi Arabia will be made,
however, until after they undergo an unspecified period of desert
warfare training in California. The decision will depend on their
performance there, officials have said.
   The men of the 48th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized) of Georgia,
the 155th Armored Brigade of Mississippi, and the 256th Infantry
Brigade (Mechanized) of Louisiana, will be sent to their regular
mobilization stations ``on or about Nov. 30,'' said Maj. Doug Hart,
a Pentagon spokesman. They include about 14,200 men.
   To increase the war-fighting capabilities of the three brigades,
they will be augmented by an armored unit of the 152nd Armor at
Oneonta, Ala.; an armored battalion of the 263rd Armor at Mullins,
S.C., and a mechanized infantry unit of the 141st Infantry at
McAllen, Texas. Those three units will total about 900 men.
   Putting the National Guard combat brigades on active duty is
especially significant in two ways. It takes the Persian Gulf
crisis beyond the bounds of the professional Army and brings it to
the doorsteps of ordinary citizens in dozens of communities. And
that, in turn, adds a further dimension to the Bush
administration's challenge of winning public support for possible
hostilities against Iraq.
   The Defense Department had alerted the Guard combat units for
possible activation last week, and on Monday the department said
they were mobilized as part of a broad call-up of combat and
combat-support National Guard and Reserve members. But on Tuesday
the department reversed itself and said they had not been
activated.
   In Macon, Ga., headquarters for the 48th Infantry Brigade,
public affairs officer Capt. Sue Ellen Reitz said the unit received
word on Tuesday that it would be activated on or about Nov. 30.
   Ms. Reitz said her brigade, composed of about 5,000 men, would
go to Fort Stewart, Ga., for ``some weeks'' of individual and unit
training in such operations as chemical warfare protection and for
weapons training and inoculations.
   Similar training will be carried out by the 155th of Mississippi
at Camp Shelby, Miss., and the 256th of Louisiana at Fort Polk,
La., before all three brigades undergo desert warfare training at
the Army's National Training Center at Fort Irwin, Calif.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said earlier this month that he
wanted the National Guard brigades to be evaluated at Fort Irwin
before deciding if they were adequately prepared for the rigors of
possible combat on the Arabian Peninsula.
   Ms. Reitz said she did not know how long the units would be at
Fort Irwin.
   ``The amount of time we spend there will depend on the progress
of the brigade'' in demonstrating their ability to perform in
desert conditions, she said.

   President Bush declared today international resolve
against Iraq's occupation of Kuwait remains solid and said he will
reassure U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf that they are ``not there
on a mission impossible.''
   Bush said he and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev see ``eye to
eye'' on the Persian Gulf, despite the Soviet leader's
unwillingness to issue a public declaration of support for a United
Nations resolution authorizing the use of force to evict Iraq's
occupying forces from Kuwait.
   Asked if the U.N. might act this month, Bush said, ``Stay tuned.
There's certainly there's a chance.'' The president is headed for a
Thanksgiving Day visit with U.S. servicemen and women stationed in
the Persian Gulf.
   Before the European summit in Paris, where he spent much of his
time trying to round up support for the U.S. stand against Iraq,
Bush insisted that efforts to win a United Nations resolution
authorizing the use of force to evict Iraq from Kuwait were ``on
track.''
   ---&equals;
   PARIS (AP) - President Bush, joining the leaders of 33 nations
in wrapping up Europe's first post-Cold War summit, today touted an
emerging world consensus that Iraq must get out of Kuwait ``with no
concessions.''
   ``I leave Paris feeling that we are still together as countries
who want to see this situation reversed and want to see'' President
Saddam Hussein ``unilaterally get out of Kuwait,'' Bush told
reporters.
   Answering questions during a picture-taking session with Greek
Prime Minister Konstontinos Mitsotakis as delegates prepared to
draw the curtain on the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe, he also claimed Soviet support for a U.N. resolution that
would permit the use of force to oust Saddam.
   ``I've said all along ... that we are on the same wave length as
the Soviet Union,'' Bush said. ``I still feel that way ... with
regard to the United Nations.''
   ---&equals;
   NEW YORK (AP) - When it comes to Thanksgiving hunger in America
this year, more people are hurting and fewer people are helping.
   ``Some of the people who had been giving are people who need
help this year,'' said Wiley Cooper, director of the United Way of
America's emergency food and shelter program.
   The slumping national economy and fears of war in the Middle
East are cutting into donations, charity groups say.
   Joseph Zalenski, director of the Brotherhood Mission in
Philadelphia, said some people are disheartened because they can't
give.
   ---&equals;
   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) - Atlantis ended its secret mission
where it began, making the first shuttle landing in Florida since
1985. Many NASA workers who launch the spaceships got their first
chance to see one come back.
   Rain-dampened desert runways and high wind kept Atlantis from
landing in the California desert as planned. NASA opted for clear
skies, calm winds and the concrete runway at Kennedy Space Center
for touchdown Tuesday afternoon.
   ``We didn't expect to be here when we left,'' mission commander
Richard Covey, an Air Force colonel, said after the spacecraft
touched down.
   During their secret Pentagon mission, Atlantis' five astronauts
put in orbit a satellite to spy on Iraq.
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - A dispute over wages and job security for
660,000 unionized Postal Service workers was sent into binding
arbitration early today after negotiators failed to meet a midnight
contract deadline and called off further talks.
   Union leaders accused Postal Service officials of refusing to
bargain with them while Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank said
the unions' demands would have ``priced the Postal Service out of
business.''
   No disruption in mail service was expected because federal law
prohibits postal workers from striking.
   ``It was a charade. We waited untold hours by the telephone for
their phone calls,'' Vincent Sombrotto, president of the
234,000-member National Letter Carriers Union, said at a midnight
news conference at the hotel where the Postal Service had held
talks with its four largest unions.
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Five senators under scrutiny by the Senate
Ethics Committee are offering differing versions of events
connected to the help they gave savings and loan owner Charles H.
Keating Jr.
   The panel recessed its hearings into the so-called Keating Five
on Tuesday for the Thanksgiving holiday and will resume Monday.
   The panel plans next week to question Edwin Gray, the former top
federal S&amp;L regulator who contends the senators attempted to apply
inappropriate pressure on behalf of Keating.
   Keating owned the California-based Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association, whose collapse and seizure by federal regulators is
estimated to cost taxpayers $2 billion to cover insured deposits.
He and his associates gave more than $1.3 million to the five
senators' campaigns and favored causes.
   ---&equals;
   NEW YORK (AP) - Time hasn't faded 77-year-old Harold Williams'
memory of leaving New York City along with other orphans on a train
taking them to new homes in the Midwest.
   ``I remember standing on the platform and then going into the
train and sitting down with my teddy bear in my lap,'' he said
Tuesday. ``I recall looking out the window and seeing all the
people and the buildings.''
   Many orphaned or abandoned children benefited from the Orphan
Train Movement, which lasted from 1854 to 1929. Others merely had
their suffering relocated.
   Their tales, good and bad, were told at an Orphan Train reunion
attended by about two dozen people who took part in the unusual
social experiment that sent more than 100,000 children to foster
homes far from the big city.

   When tango fans call 84-year-old
composer and pianist Osvaldo Pugliese ``the master,'' it is a
tribute to the man and the musician.
   A composer, arranger, pianist and band leader, Pugliese has
recorded hundreds of songs. His own classics include ``Recuerdo''
(``Memory'') and ``Malandraca'' (``Ruffians'').
   In August, his band of 12 musicians and two singers celebrated
its 50th anniversary. There were two performances to accommodate
all the fans. The following month, the band toured Holland and
Belgium. Last year, it played for two months in Japan.
   Pugliese fans say tango may be divided into before and after
``Recuerdo,'' a tune he wrote in 1924 that featured bandoleon riffs
which elevated the accordian-like instrument from the periphery to
the heart of the music.
   At the time, Pugliese was 19 - too young to legally register the
song in his own name. So his father, a leather cutter in a shoe
factory and an amateur flutist, took credit.
   Pugliese's signature piece, ``Yumba,'' was first performed in
1946. It showcases his distinctive style of a simple melody, a
one-three beat and the violent stops and starts of the instruments
- bandoleon, piano, violin and cello - that get feet tapping and
hearts pounding.
   In comparison, tango's other main exponent, bandoleonist and
composer Astor Piazzolla, revels in complex scores that are meant
to be listened to rather than danced. Sixty-nine and in poor
health, he acquired his own legion of fans by fusing tango and jazz
rhythms, and experimenting with instruments such as the clarinet
and the vibraphone. His followers compose songs on computers and
play them on electric guitars.
   But there's more to Pugliese than music. He's a communist who
never renounced his beliefs, a labor leader punished for promoting
workers' rights, a government critic who refused the safety of
exile, a factory worker's son who won fame but never turned his
back on his roots.
   The grade-school dropout and self-taught pianist also is a
forgiving man who accepted public apologies from President Gen.
Juan Peron and others who threw him in jail and denied him work
over four decades.
   ``His music is great because the man is a giant in every sense
of the word,'' Isidoro Gilbert wrote in the prologue to a 1985
book-length interview of Pugliese. ``He is the high priest of
tango, the soul of the city.''
   ``Pugliese is one of the few people who represent something
special about Buenos Aires,'' said theater promoter Lino Patalano.
``You will never hear anyone say a single bad word about him.''
   Pugliese's story is well known in this South American capital
where tango was born a century ago in bars and brothels by the
docks, and thrives today in nightclubs, dance halls and, when
Pugliese plays, theaters that seat several thousand.
   Jailed or barred from performing more times than he can
remember, Pugliese once persuaded a jailer to enroll in the
Communist Party. In 1961, he composed ``Milonga Para Fidel'' for
Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
   During his enforced absences, Pugliese's orchestra would place a
red rose atop his black piano. The words, ``Tango Is Prisoner, Free
Osvaldo Pugliese,'' would appear as graffiti on the downtown
Obelisk, symbol of the city.
   In 1936, he helped found the Argentine Musicians Union so
colleagues might get a greater share of proceeds from concerts and
recordings. He still splits earnings with his band, and is not a
wealthy man.
   ``I enjoy good health and many friends,'' he said with a smile
at Tango House, a foundation he helped set up to promote the music.
He often can be found at the two-story building, playing truco (a
card game), sipping mate (bitter tea) and telling jokes in lunfardo
(Buenos Aires slang).
   Success seemed unlikely for Pugliese. He dropped out of school
after fourth grade and hired on as a printer's apprentice, learning
to play the piano on the side.
   But he had a natural gift and tremendous yearning. By age 14, he
was helping family finances by playing piano from 6 p.m. until 1
a.m. in cabarets. And practicing, practicing, always practicing.
   Asked his secret of composition, he once said, ``These things
just come out in an instant. ... They appeared in my head, they
appeared in my heart and, bruuuuuum, I wrote it.''
   At 84, Pugliese is hard of hearing, physically frail and sees
the world through thick lenses. But the passing of years has not
weakened his cheery good nature, unbreakable spirit or his touch.
   At his anniversary performance, the notes were clear and his
left-hand mightily swept down the keys. Between songs, he chatted
with fans who shouted out tunes they wanted to hear next.
   ``One thing surprised me,'' he said afterward. ``When I
finished, everyone was quiet and, I thought, asleep or bored? Then
came the applause. I almost had a heart attack.''

   Like any proud parents, Len and Debra
Bonamassa will whip out the pictures of their 13-year-old son,
Joey, at the drop of a hat.
   But don't look for photos of little Joey taking his first step
or standing at attention in a Cub Scouts uniform.
   Instead, you'll see Joey on stage at a Hollywood nightclub with
pop artist Stephen Stills, or backstage at the Saratoga Performing
Arts Center with Stills, Graham Nash and David Crosby or chatting
with blues great B.B. King.
   When the Bonamassas talk about wanting to limit how much their
son plays, they mean in nightclubs, not Nintendo. And their home
movies are apt to be a promotional video for Joey, whose reputation
as a blues guitar prodigy is growing.
   He's been working professionally for two years, since the night
he sat in with blues singer and harmonica player James Cotton in a
nightclub in Hamilton, N.Y. Joey has since opened for B.B. King and
jammed with some of the country's best blues guitarists, including
Buddy Guy, Ronnie Earl and Albert Collins.
   ``It's just the same as if you go up there with your own band,''
said Joey. ``It's really no different. You're just playing with
another fellow musician.''
   Len Bonamassa, echoing the critics who've caught his son's act,
says Joey plays the blues with ``maturity and heart and soul'' far
beyond his years. Audiences, perhaps skeptical at first of an
eighth-grader in snakeskin boots who styles himself ``Smokin' Joe''
on stage, are won over from the first notes he plays.
   ``He's definitely going to be a monster guitar player,'' said
Robert Dye of Guitar World magazine, who caught Joey's act recently
at a New York City club. ``He's got feel beyond his years. ... He's
managed to capture the feel of players in their late 30s or early
40s.''
   Yet, sitting at the kitchen table of the Bonamassa's ranch house
in this quiet, working-class suburb of Utica, Joey looks no
different than any other eighth-grader. As the family dog barks up
a storm in the garage, Joey asks his mother for a cookie but gets a
pretzel instead. He talks about cars with his father and about the
local high school's champion sports teams.
   In all ways, his parents say, Joey is an average 13-year-old.
Except when he has a guitar in his hands.
   ``By the time he was 6, he was sounding like something. By the
time he was 7, he was about as good as most guitar players in this
area,'' said Len, himself once a member of a duo that played Top 40
songs in local lounges. ``He was able to pull off Stevie Ray
Vaughan note for note at 7 years old.''
   With his father initially giving him pointers, Joey learned to
play on a scaled-down electric guitar. He said he still practices
about an hour and a half a day, more on weekends and during the
summer.
   About the only formal training Joey has had was with a local
jazz guitarist who admitted to his parents that while he enjoyed
playing with their son, he couldn't really teach him anything.
   Joey first got to meet and perform with the prominent blues
performers appearing in central New York through his father's
contacts with club owners and musicians. Now he has made enough of
a name to perform on his own at nightclubs and music festivals,
backed by a band of adult professionals put together with the help
of his father.
   His repertoire includes rocking blues songs made famous by
Vaughan, Jimi Hendricks, Muddy Waters and others.
   Len Bonamassa said he is now looking for a big-time agent to
handle his son's bookings and publicity. ``He's ready for some
professional hands,'' said Len, a truck driver for a paper
distributor. ``It's just too much for Mom and Dad.''
   Something about the rhythm of the blues songs he heard as a
child on his father's Vaughan and Allman Brothers records appealed
to him, Joey says. While most kids his age are listening to M.C.
Hammer or Metallica, he continues to mine the work of blues-based
guitarists including Roy Buchanan, Danny Gatton, Collins, Stills
and Earl for influences.
   ``They're all in their own little world of heavy metal and
rap,'' he says of his schoolmates. ``I just want to play the
blues.''
   So far, except for occasionally singing ``Johnny B. Goode,''
Joey has limited his performing to playing the guitar.
   ``I'm a lot more comfortable playing,'' he said. ``Singing is
something I do because if you don't sing it really isn't marketable
for a blues guitar players. But Daddy says, `Why don't you sing a
few tunes just to let them know you can sing?' So I do, but it's
not the greatest voice in the world.''

<DATELINE>CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten years after Ronald Reagan extinguished
the Sagebrush Rebellion by moving into the White House, the
modern-day range war is rekindling.
   Fearful of losing control over their own land and losing access
to natural resources on public lands, at least 50 ranchers, miners,
loggers and local government officials plan to meet in Las Vegas on
Friday to develop a strategy to combat the Bush administration and
the conservation movement.
   Those who participated in the rebellion in an effort to have
Bureau of Land Management property turned over to the states say
President Bush's environmental leanings are jeopardizing their
livelihoods.
   ``I think the new push by President Bush, that he wants to be
the environmental president for the century, has certainly caused
an uproar,'' says Dean Rhoads, the Nevada rancher and lawmaker who
spearheaded the rebellion in 1979.
   That year, Rhoads traveled throughout the West spreading his
belief that public lands management policies would ruin the region.
   The federal government owns more than half of Utah, Idaho and
Oregon. In Nevada, Rhoads pointed out, 87 percent of the state
belongs to Uncle Sam.
   ``We're operating, in a state of 70 million acres, on 4 million
acres. I think it makes us a little smaller than Connecticut, if we
were to look at the size of private land,'' Rhoads said at that
time.
   Ranchers complained that livestock grazing land was being
destroyed by wild horses and that the Bureau of Land Management's
stringent grazing regulations were killing the sheep industry.
   As the rebellion spread, legislators in Nevada, New Mexico,
Wyoming, Utah and Arizona passed measures calling for the federal
government to relinquish control of its lands.
   But Reagan managed to quell the uprising because Westerners
considered him one of their own, sympathetic to their troubles and
sure to solve the regulatory nightmares.
   ``When Reagan came in, the West felt they had someone there that
would help them,'' recalls Marlene Simons, a rancher and member of
Wyoming's House of Representatives who joined Rhoads in promoting
the rebellion 11 years ago. ``When James Watt got in (as interior
secretary), they thought they had it won.''
   But since Bush succeeded Reagan in 1988, those who rely on the
millions of acres of public lands in the West have sensed a
tightening of the regulatory noose.
   They cite a number of growing concerns:
   - Efforts by the federal government to preserve wetlands.
   - Management decisions emphasizing recreation over timbering in
national forests.
   - Moves in Congress to protect more public land from
development.
   - A recent effort in Congress to increase grazing fees on public
lands fivefold by fiscal 1994.
   Rhoads plans to be at the Las Vegas session to meet with others
disenchanted over Bush's environmental stances, but he's not saying
what action they will consider.
   ``We kicked around a lot of ideas'' during an initial meeting
earlier this year, he said in a phone interview from his Nevada
ranch.
   According to William Perry Pendley, chief legal officer of the
Mountain States Legal Foundation, any strategy should be built
around unified opposition to environmental groups who oppose use of
the nation's natural resources.
   ``The side that wants to use the lands are not as well-financed
(as environmentalists), they are not as aggressive, and frankly
they have got to get back to work,'' he said.
   Wayne Hage, a rancher from Tonopah, Nev., has written a book on
the public lands controversy that he says has existed virtually
since the West was settled.
   Like Rhoads, Hage believes the climate that spurred the
Sagebrush Rebellion is returning.
   ``The sentiment that spurred the Sagebrush Rebellion has always
been here in the Western states,'' he said. ``It's just that
occasionally, depending on how heavy the hand that the federal
government has been wielding, we get an outburst of more intense
reaction.''
   Today's revival of the movement is tied to what Hage calls the
anti-development tactics of the Bureau of Land Management, U.S.
Forest Service and Army Corps of Engineers.
   State and local governments are becoming increasingly alarmed
``as they see the potential for devastating economic chaos settling
into their own areas,'' he said.
   And those in the movement point to the Pacific Northwest, where
habitat protection plans for the northern spotted owl will curb the
timber industry in some areas, and to Nevada and California, where
protection of the desert tortoise is limiting development and
recreation.
   Cy Jamison, director of the Bureau of Land Management, disagrees
on the extent of unhappiness among Westerners.
   ``We've really tried to be a good neighbor out in the West,'' he
said in an interview from his Washington office. ``There's still
some spots ... especially where we have a lot of resource
conflicts, where there's a deep frustration.
   ``Overall, I think we've really changed a lot of attitudes out
there. But I could find one person about everywhere you went that
wouldn't agree with me on that,'' he added.
   Jamison said the key to resolving the growing discontent is
compromise.
   ``We have to have a little bit for everybody,'' he said.

<HEAD>Lone Voice Raised About Bishops' Silent ``Problem''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Some compare us to a disfunctional family,
which is unable to talk about its problem even though we all know
about it.''
   A Midwestern Roman Catholic bishop made that point at last
week's meeting in Washington of the church's U.S. hierarchy, but
his was a lone voice. The others skirted the ``problem.''
   It is that most Catholics reject the church's prohibition of
contraception. This widespread dissent has been repeatedly
documented and is widely recognized throughout the church.
   But the bishops don't talk about it, having been firmly called
to heel about it by Pope John Paul II.
   Nevertheless, Bishop Kenneth E. Untener, 53, of Saginaw, Mich.,
a warm-mannered, straightforward man standing at a microphone among
about 300 of his fellow bishops, spoke up.
   ``When the people disagree,'' he said, ``it means something.''
   He urged attention to the ``sensus fidelium,'' or ``sense of the
faithful,'' which, as long taught in the church, often brings
fuller understanding of Christian truth through ordinary believers.
   While the Holy Spirit acts through the ``magisterium,'' the
bishops, to guide the church, the Spirit also acts through the
people, Untener said, and their convictions should be taken
seriously.
   Noting that a document on sexuality that the bishops were
considering advised those who dissent from the church's stand
against contraception to prayerfully reconsider, he said they might
respond:
   ```We will if you will.'''
   It has become obvious that many lay people, many priests and
even some bishops are not convinced that the ban on contraception
is sound doctrine grounded in biblical principles, he said.
   The bishops should ``listen to what this is saying about
Christian understanding of sexuality and what it means for the
family in marriage,'' he said, and added:.
   ``If we don't, it can cause great damage to the church at
large.''
   Publically, none of the bishops took him up on it, although
several thanked him privately for his courage in mentioning the
unmentionable. One did refer to it glancingly as something to be
overcome.
   ``There may still be questions and a considerable amount of
dissent'' about contraception because ``we have been reticent in
asserting our position,'' said Bishop James T. McHugh of Camden,
N.J.
   ``We are trying to assert values and principles'' and ``inform
the new generation what that position is,'' he said of the
sexuality document, which gently reiterated the ban and was
approved.
   Although not mentioning the particular ``problem,'' Auxiliary
Bishop Austin B. Vaughan of New York wanted the entire sexuality
document delayed to get response from parents, many of whom oppoose
its call for sex education.
   He suggested bishops weren't exactly suited to deal with the
subject.
   ``We're all celibate,'' he said. ``None of us are parents. By
U.S. standards we're all aging. ... We're not experts. We're a
little out of touch with what's going on. We should give interested
parents a shot at this document.''
   Mentioned or not, the contraception issue has simmered for years
in the church, going back to the Second Vatican Council of 1962-65,
which started to take up the matter before Pope Paul VI removed it
from council consideration.
   He put it before a papal commission of bishops, theologians and
various experts. Eventually, a strong majority of them recommended
modification of the contraception ban.
   However, Pope Paul rejected that recommendation and in 1968
issued his controversial encyclical, ``Humanae Vitae,'' reasserting
the prohibition and touching off waves of dissent among theologians
and others.
   Several foreign national hierarchies expressed reservations
about the encyclical.
   Surveys in this country have found that more than 80 percent of
Catholics do not accept the teaching. Some scholars have contended
the encyclical has tended to undermine church teaching authority.
   In 1980, Archbishop John R. Quinn of San Francisco told a synod
of bishops in Rome that 70 percent of U.S. Catholics ignored the
contraception ban and most priests supported that defiance of it.
   His candor somewhat backfired. When some news reports implied he
had criticized the church position, he quickly made clear that he
firmly backed it.
   Something of a further damper was put on the issue in 1987 when
Pope John Paul met with a delegated group of bishops in Los
Angeles.
   Referring to dissent against the contraception ban, he said some
claim this is ``totally compatible with being a good Catholic and
posed no obstacle to reception of the sacraments. This is a grave
error.''
   For the bishops, this tended to tighten the lid on the
``problem.'' They know it's there. They just avoid discussing it
publicly. But Untener broke that silence, cautioning of damage that
could come from such suppression.

   Heading into the final weeks of 1990, students
of financial history have some encouraging words to offer savers
and investors hoping for better times ahead.
   If past patterns in American politics and economics are any
guide, these analysts say, the health of the stock market - and of
stock-related investments in places like mutual funds, variable
annuities and employer-sponsored savings plans - could improve
noticeably in 1991.
   The force from which stocks could stand to benefit: The approach
of the presidential election in 1992.
   In the words of Yale Hirsch, who documented the ``political
stock market cycle'' years ago in his annual Stock Trader's
Almanac: ``Each president of the United States must face political
realities every four years if he wants to stay in the White House,
or at least keep his party in power.''
   By implication, that suggests that President Bush, and
incumbents of both parties in Congress, will work increasing hard
to pull the economy and the markets out of their slumps as the
elections draw closer.
   In a similar vein, say analysts at the investment management
firm of Wright Investors' Service, ``It won't be long before the
political machines begin gearing up for the 1992 presidential
election.''
   Assuming that a recession has indeed taken hold in recent
months, Wright asserts, ``one should expect to see the Bush
administration exerting increasing pressure on the Federal Reserve
to lower interest rates.''
   Although the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials hit a new high
as recently as early summer of this year, most broader gauges of
stock price trends have been falling since September or October of
1989.
   Over that span, for example, the Value Line geometric average of
1,651 stocks has dropped about 35 percent.
   If that eventually defines a phenomenon that goes into the
record books as the 1989-90 bear market, analysts say, it would be
no historical anomaly.
   In fact, it would be a pretty fair match for the last three big
bear markets - 1981-82, 1973-74, and 1969-70 - all of which
occurred in the first two years following a presidential election.
   The ensuing pre-election years of 1983, 1975, and 1971,
witnessed gains of 10 percent to 32 percent, using Standard &amp;
Poor's 500-stock composite index as a gauge.
   In theory at least, each administration tends to take painful
economic policy actions early in the span between elections. That
way, there is time to forget the pain of a slump, and to begin
seeing its beneficial after-effects, by the time the voters go to
the polls again.
   Few politicians ever acknowledge acting on such seemingly
cold-blooded motives - even though many economists argue that
recessions are inevitable at least once in a while, providing a
process of purging and renewal that is hard to accomplish any other
way.
   Neither economics nor politics is ever neat and tidy enough to
allow such matters to be managed in detail.
   In addition, there have been signs lately that past patterns may
be changing. In the last post-election period of 1985 and 1986,
stocks rose sharply instead of undergoing their usual setback.
   Then, in the supposedly bullish pre-election year of 1987 came a
market crash.
   Such twists and turns make it patently risky to base investment
decisions entirely on a single indicator such as the political
cycle.
   Still, as Hirsch wrote in his almanac, ``Our quadrennial
elections of presidents unequivocally affect the economy and the
stock market, just as the moon affects the tides.''

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Carlos Menem's enemies
wonder how he gets away with cracking down on unions, business, the
armed forces and even his own Peronist party.
   Similar actions by the previous government provoked 13 general
strikes, three barracks revolts, food riots and hyperinflation.
President Raul Alfonsin was forced to step down more than five
months early, in July 1989.
   ``If I had done 10 percent'' of what Menem has done, ``they
would have hanged me from a lamppost,'' Alfonsin said recently.
   In 16 months, Menem has wrenched the economy from state control
toward free enterprise and sought closer ties with the United
States at the expense of Third World nations. Those are major
shifts for any Argentine president, particularly a Peronist.
   He is selling off public companies the unions consider a
national patrimony, used military personnel to break a strike,
ended collective bargaining agreements and held pay increases for
public employees far below the inflation rate.
   ``What Menem is doing is exactly the opposite of what Peron did,
what the party stands for and what Menem himself promised in his
campaign,'' said novelist Tomas Eloy Martinez, once a follower of
the late President Juan Peron.
   Col. Mohammed Ali Seineldin, who led an army rebellion in
December 1988, was forced to retire and many of his followers were
purged from the service. The military budget is so low the 1990
draft had to be cut by two-thirds. Many officers have second jobs,
in the civilian world.
   Argentina is in a recession. Real wages are below their average
values of the 1980s and one in five adults lacks full-time work.
The austral currency is greatly overvalued.
   Despite all that, Argentina has managed to avert economic
collapse, political crisis, social unrest and military
insurrection. Catastrophe is always possible in a country that has
had six coups since 1930 and four currencies in 20 years, but it
does not seem imminent.
   Supporters credit Menem, but also cite a change in Argentine
social values, and the president's critics tend to agree.
   Historian Felix Luna, a member of Alfonsin's Radical Civic Union
who finds the Menem foreign policy ``excessively pro-American,''
said the people believe ``it's absolutely necessary ... that
Argentina change.''
   Public services are in terrible condition: Telephones are
expensive, trains don't run on time and mail gets lost.
   A nation accustomed to triple-digit annual inflation was swamped
in 1989 by hyperpinflation of more than 4,900 percent. Many people
are willing to accept brutal measures, even severe recession, to
keep that from happening again.
   There is virtually no public support for a return to military
rule, and Menem seems to have placated the armed forces by calling
off trials of officers accused of human rights abuses during the
dictatorship of 1976-83. A pardon for those convicted is pending.
   Nearly everyone in Argentina is suffering to some degree and the
man imposing the pain of economic conservatism comes in the
unlikely guise of a Peronist.
   Political analyst Carlos Escude suggested only a Peronist could
undertake such radical changes, and said: ``There are historical
corollaries: Nixon and China, Reagan and Gorbachov, Bush and
taxes.''
   Saul Ubaldini, Menem's chief rival in the Peronist-dominated
labor movement, criticizes the president's economic policy but
insists: ``By no definition am I a political opponent.''
   For all the criticism, no one has proposed a convincing
alternative to the president's program.
   Menem, 60, is a son of Syrian immigrants who became a lawyer and
provincial governor. As an outsider, he scored a primary victory in
July 1988 over Gov. Antonio Cafiero of Buenos Aires, who party
leaders thought would be the next president.
   He tells Argentines in direct language that the government he
inherited was bankrupt, the currency almost worthless and the
economic model of state control an empty shell.
   Again and again, he repeats that radical change was unavoidable
and asks for patience during the years it will take for the
sacrifices to bear fruit.
   Inflation rose by only a single digit in October, for the first
time in 11 months. Real wages have recovered some of their lost
value, interest rates have fallen and Central Bank reserves rose
fortyfold to $4 billion.
   There also are signs, however, that the popularity of Menem and
his policies is wearing thin, and that serious opposition may be
forming.
   Recent polls put his public support at about 50 percent, down 30
points from its peak.
   Ubaldini is mobilizing workers against the economic program and
Menem's decree restricting the right to strike.
   Several parties have withdrawn from the political coalition that
helped Menem win the presidency in May 1989.
   The Peronist governors of Chubut and Jujuy provinces were forced
to resign in October by mass protests of workers demanding back
wages. The provinces said they couldn't pay because the federal
government had withheld funds.

   Drummer Buddy Rich made his show business debut
at 18 months. Singer Mel Torme, who has just finished writing
Rich's biography, waited until he was 4 before becoming a
professional entertainer.
   Torme talked to a lot of people for ``Traps, the Drum Wonder,''
including Rich, Artie Shaw, Johnny Carson, tenor saxophonist
Georgie Auld and singer Jo Stafford who, with Frank Sinatra, sang
with the Pied Pipers in the Tommy Dorsey Band.
   ``He (Rich) and Sinatra were the darlings of the band. They sort
of locked heads, fighting for the attention of the public. Tommy
stood back and laughed. In a weird way, he encouraged this,'' said
Torme, who visited Rich at home the afternoon before he died April
2, 1987.
   He said he asked the drummer that day if he wanted the book to
be a puff piece, or warts and all. ``He said, `Warts and all. Just
be accurate.'
   ``Buddy had a mouth on him. I've liberally quoted him,'' Torme
said.
   ``His dad had been a black-face comedian with minstrel shows at
the turn of the century. He was a hard taskmaster. Life was made
very tough for Buddy. I feel his occasional abrasiveness came out
of that. He was extremely tough on his bands. That's why they were
superb. He used to say, `I give 110 percent every night. I expect
nothing less from you.' When they did play well, he was ecstatic.
When they dogged it, he went bananas.
   ``We occasionally had our outs. One time I didn't talk to him
for 2{ years. I allude to the argument, without the hurtful
quotes,'' Torme said.
   ``I made the book as objective as I could make it. I'm not
settling old scores for him, or with him. He was wildly witty and,
if you believe the phrase, his talent was God-given.''
   Torme said that Rich, as an infant, was keeping time with a
vaudeville band during a rehearsal. ``The manager of the theater
comes over, `Why don't you put the kid in your act tonight?'
Buddy's father carried him out by his belt, put him in front of
drums and they played `Stars and Stripes Forever.' They had to play
it three times that night.
   ``His vaudeville name until he was 12 was Traps, the Drum
Wonder. Then he became Buddy Traps. His real name was Bernard
Rich.'' The book will be published by Oxford University Press next
fall. Torme intends to give Rich's grandson 30 percent of the
profits.
   Torme's debut came with the band led by Carleton Coon and Joe
Sanders at the Blackhawk Hotel in Chicago. ``My parents took me in
to hear them one night. Joe Sanders said to them, `Why does this
kid know all the tunes? I can see he knows them.''' Torme's father
explained he'd heard them on the radio. So, on invitation, the tiny
Torme sang ``You're Driving Me Crazy.''
   ``I became a Monday night feature, made $15 every Monday night
and dinner for me and Mom and Dad. My family was musical but not
professional. My mother, who's 89, played piano and my dad, 92,
danced.''
   Rich and Torme met in 1944, when Rich sat in on ``Hawaiian War
Chant'' with Charlie Spivak's band. ``He played it as if he'd
played it all his life. He had played a different arrangement with
Tommy Dorsey. He could sense everything.
   ``The last time he played professionally was in January 1987 at
the Paladium in a show I hosted, a salute to Tommy Dorsey. The last
thing he played was the Dorsey arrangement of `Hawaiian War Chant.'
''
   Torme turned 65 in September. The November issue of Life
magazine lists him among the nation's six most enduring singers.
   Torme lives in Beverly Hills, Calif., with his fourth wife, Ali.
He has five children, ages ranging from 17 to 37.
   While here for a month's performances at Michael's Pub, a table
in his hotel room holds a small blender and packets of Slim Fast.
``I started on it in May 1988,'' he said. ``I just got to the point
I wasn't comfortable in my clothes. Singing, I was having trouble
with breath control because I was too heavy.''
   He lost 35 pounds in eight months. Last year, executives of Slim
Fast, whose offices are in the same building as Michael's Pub, saw
his show and invited him to make a TV commercial for them. He did
it, after writing his own jingle.
   Torme's been busy this year. He and George Shearing performed at
a New Zealand jazz festival, and he and Cleo Laine toured together
during the summer. Torme also recorded the Stephen Sondheim song,
``Live Alone and Like It'' for Warren Beatty's movie, ``Dick
Tracy.''
   Torme, the Buddy Rich Band and the McGuire Sisters will start an
extensive U.S. tour next February.

   Roman Catholic leadership at present says ``no''
to some theoretical changes that a prominent theologian and a
big-selling priest-novelist imagine as happening.
   They cast their visions in different forms, one in a scholar's
hypothetical scenario of a new pope's election, the other as a
fictional account of an American bishop's pathbreaking innovations.
   If their fancies precede reality, then Roman Catholicism one of
these days will officially take up ordaining women and allowing
priests to marry if they choose.
   That doesn't appear plausible under the present firm stance
against it by Pope John Paul II and the shunning of the idea by the
recently concluded Vatican synod on the priesthood.
   However, surveys find majorities of American Catholics would
approve it, and it comes to storied fruition in a new novel, ``The
Shepherd,'' and also flowers in the speculations of Notre Dame
scholar, the Rev. Richard McBrien.
   In the novel, the Rev. Joseph F. Girzone, an Albany, N. Y.,
priest, tells of a dutiful Midwestern priest who is named a bishop
and begins a series of drastic reforms.
   These include assigning married priests to evangelizing tasks,
ordaining women as deacons, a first step toward the priesthood, and
forming a unified ministry with Lutheran, Methodist and Episcopal
bishops.
   Girzone, whose previous best-selling novel, ``Joshua,'' portrays
a modern-day Jesus figure, keeps Joshua around in the new novel to
advise and encourage the bishop in critical moments.
   ``Don't put new wine into old wineskins,'' Joshua advises. ``Old
molds are part of the past and are not sacred. New situations need
new tools if the church is to help people through difficult
times.''
   The publisher has sent copies of the novel to all the country's
cardinals, archbishops and some bishops.
   The fictional Bishop David Campbell meets stiff opposition, even
on his own staff, but gets confidential support by many bishops,
though they fear to take similar steps.
   He also has the secret backing of the pope himself, who strives
to hold off upset Vatican officials. On the pope's death, the
reformer Campbell, by a fluke of circumstances, succeeds him.
   McBrien, head of the theology department of the University of
Notre Dame, envisions the reforms as coming with the conjectured
election of a new pope, John XXIV, about the end of the decade.
   In a syndicated column, McBrien says the imaginary new pope,
named after the late reforming Pope John XXIII, immediately
announces the calling of another ecumenical council, Vatican III.
   Among its surmised concerns would be the church's ban on
contraception, ignored by most Catholics, the shortage of priests,
the requirement of priestly celibacy, and the ordination of women.
   ``I expect that some members of the church who were pleased with
many ecclesiastical policies during the past decade will not be
comfortable with the changes I have announced,'' the fancied new
pope tells a news conference.
   He nullifies the Vatican's recently promulgated ``loyalty oath''
and expanded ``profession of faith'' for priests, and announces the
resignation of the Vatican's doctrinal watchdog, Cardinal Joseph
Ratzinger.
   ``The church itself must remain acutely conscious of its own
sinfulness and weakness,'' the new pope says. ``That is why I will
issue no call for discipline and obedience, unless it is good news,
and unless it is obedience to the reign of God, which is a reign of
justice and peace.''
   Unlike the previous Vatican council, the imaginary new one would
include lay persons as well as bishops, as many women as men, and
delegates of other Christian churches would have the right to
participate in debates.
   ``As the church enters a new century and a new millennium, we
must show the world what it means to be a community of
understanding, of patience, of mercy and compassion,'' says the
fancied new pope.
   In Girzone's novel, ``The Shepherd,'' the reformist U.S. bishop
also finally becomes pope, but only after his revamping of church
practices gets him exiled to an isolated, desert post.
   Girzone keeps his theology folksy, writing in a simple, almost
fairy-tale style. His previous novel, ``Joshua,'' has sold nearly a
million copies.
   In the new novel, the bishop gets regular encouragement from the
almost ubiquitous Joshua about the difficulties of introducing new
and revitalizing forms of ministry.
   ``God is concerned about his children, not about structures,
which exist only to aid God's children,'' Joshua says. ``When you
ask yourself, `What would Jesus do?' the answer is simple, but to
follow is the way of the cross.
   ``Church leaders are no different than anyone. ... They may have
the good of the church at heart, but they, like others, rarely ask,
`What would Jesus do?' ''

   At age 72, Evangelist Billy Graham last Sunday
finished a five-day crusade here that achieved the largest single
audience in his more than 40 years of international ministry, a
press spokesman says.
   He said the meetings were extended by satellite and video to
more than 30 countries in Asia and the Pacific region in 48
languages to an audience totalling 100 million per night.
   More than 25 million of them attend 70,000 satellite and video
follow-up crusades organized by about 125,000 churches in those
countries, with over 400,000 counselors trained, and 10 million
pieces of literature provided.
   The spokesman said the 29,000-seat Hong Kong Stadium overflowed
each night, with bigger crowds viewing by large-screen projection
in an adjacent athletic ground. An average of 4,762 each night made
commitments to Christ.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - A survey by Catholics for a Free Choice finds
that 71 percent of Roman Catholics believe a doctor who performs an
abortion should not be excommunicated; 73 percent oppose
excommunication of pro-choice legislators and 76 percent oppose
excommunication of women who had abortions.
   The church's canon law calls for automatic excommunication of
anyone directly involved in an abortion.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Episcopal Presiding Bishop Edmond L. Browning
has criticized a recent fund-raising letter by an Episcopal faction
as a ``total fabrication.''
   The letter, sent by the Rev. Todd Wetzel, executive director of
Episcopalians United for Revelation, Renewal and Reformation, said
Browning ``supports not only inclusive language ... but also the
ordination of practicing homosexuals and blessing of homosexual
`unions'.''
   After Wetzel rejected Browning's request to retract the letter,
Browning said it was false and he had to ``set the record
straight.'' Wetzel said the EURRR apologized for the tone of part
of the letter, but ``we believe that he is in favor of those three
items.''

   ST. LOUIS (AP) - Reporting on a study of Jewish division into
Orthodox, Conservative and Reform wings, Queens College Sociologist
Samuel Heilman told the executive council of the American Jewish
Committee:

that American Jews were ever unified. Rather, most of both groups
believe, with the exception of the Orthodox, that Jewish unity is
not as important as pluralism.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - A joint Eastern Orthodox-Roman Catholic
statement affirms common beliefs about the sanctity of marriage,
but notes that differences in practice remain on such matters as
divorce and remarriage.
   A dialogue tem of bishops of the two traditions, at an October
meeting in Johnstown, Pa., said both see marriage as a way to
``experience through human love the liberating effect of divine
love.''
   The statement noted that the Orthodox churches permit divorce
and remarriage under certain circumstances while in Roman
Catholicism, a second marriage is approved only if the previous one
is found to have been null.
   It also was noted that in Orthodox marriages, the priest is the
``minister of the sacrament,'' while Catholicism considers the
couple as ``ministering the sacrament to each other'' to which the
priest is witness.

<HEAD>Civil Rights Leaders Question Bush's Commitment to Fight
Discrimination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civil rights advocates are questioning
President Bush's commitment to fighting discrimination despite the
administration's aggressive prosecution of some ground-breaking
voting rights and housing bias cases.
   They cite Bush's veto of the Civil Rights Act of 1990, which
would have made it easier for victims of discrimination to sue
their employers.
   ``That fallout is going to take some time to clear,'' said Drew
Days, who ran the civil rights division under President Carter.
   Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on
Civil Rights, had a harsher assessment. ``Once again, we have an
administration defying the bipartisan consensus that exists on
civil rights,'' he said.
   Still, civil rights leaders acknowledge there are bright spots
in the Bush administration's record.
   Bush actively courted black voters during the 1988 campaign,
invited Coretta Scott King to the Republican National Convention,
and spoke about healing racial divisions. He is credited with
appointing more blacks to political jobs than his predecessor,
Ronald Reagan.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh tried to re-establish ties with
civil rights leaders that were left badly frayed by conservative
William Bradford Reynolds, who ran the Justice Department's civil
rights division under President Reagan.
   He also played a major role in ensuring passage of the Americans
with Disabilities Act, which bars discrimination against people
with mental and physical handicaps.
   The Justice Department also has made enforcement a priority,
adding lawyers to bring cases under a new statute that expands the
government's authority to counter housing discrimination.
   It has forced municipalities to drop restrictions against group
homes for mentally retarded people. The agency recently won a jury
verdict against a landlord for refusing to rent apartments to a
drug program to house recovering addicts.
   The Justice Department filed suit to force the all-male Virginia
Military Institute to admit women cadets. It moved to overturn
Georgia's election system, which it says discriminates against
black office seekers.
   ``When I came here it was with the understanding with the
attorney general that I would be responsible for the vigorous and
the complete enforcement of the civil rights laws,'' said John
Dunne, who was named assistant attorney general for civil rights
after the Senate Judiciary Committee blocked Bush's first nominee,
William Lucas.
   ``No matter what the subject area, we have been extremely
aggressive,'' Dunne said.
   Civil rights advocates want more.
   ``They are going to have to make a record across the board, it's
not going to be sufficient to carve out enclaves where they are
vigorous and leaving others untouched and uncared for,'' Days said.
   Neas says he finds ``very few substantive differences'' in
Justice Department policy from the Reagan administration when it
was headed by Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   And on many major issues of dispute involving the 1990 civil
rights bill, ``the Thornburgh Justice Department was much worse
than the Meese Justice Department,'' Neas said.
   ``Thornburgh strikes you as being the planet Jupiter, a failed
star. You would have anticipated much more from him,'' said Barbara
Arnwine, an attorney for the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights
Under Law.
   The bill Bush vetoed would have restored an evolving legal
standard dating back 18 years for discrimination cases involving
employer policies that have a ``disparate impact'' on women and
minorities.
   Bush said it would spawn hiring quotas by encouraging businesses
to employ and promote minorities simply to avoid costly court
suits.
   Civil rights lawyers accuse the president of using divisive
rhetoric to mischaracterize the bill, which contained language
stating that no provision was designed to promote quotas.
   ``It's dividing people when this was the president who was going
to try to heal those divisions,'' said William Taylor, a Washington
civil rights lawyer.
   Both Taylor and Arnwine charge that the Bush administration
wants to eliminate ``disparate impact'' cases to protect business
from the costs of discrimination suits.
   ``They believe that if somebody didn't intend to discriminate,
they shouldn't be held accountable,'' Arnwine said.
   Dunne rejected this view, providing figures showing that the
since Bush took office the civil rights division has brought nine
disparate-impact suits against state and local governments.
   But civil rights activists contend that the department wastes
valuable time and resources pursuing reverse discrimination cases,
such as a recent lawsuit accusing the Maryland Lottery Commission
of discriminating against white males by setting aside 12 positions
for women and minorities.
   ``We don't apologize for bringing reverse discrimination
cases,'' said Roger Clegg, one of Dunne's deputies who also served
in the Reagan administration. ``The law requires us to enforce the
law in an even-handed fashion.''
   The bitterness that lingers following Bush's veto is fueled by
charges that the administration failed to bargain in good faith
with the bill's supporters.
   ``The sense of many in the civil rights community is that the
administration strung people along, giving them the sense there
really was room for negotiations and compromise when there really
wasn't,'' Days said.
   ``The administration is going to have to work very hard to
re-establish its good faith,'' he said.

<HEAD>Collor Under Attack; Criticizes Critics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEN SILVERSTEIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Economic and political problems
are growing in Brazil, and President Fernando Collor de Mello's
conservative government is under attack from all sides.
   Businessmen say the country is being driven into an unnecessary
recession. Labor leaders complain that paychecks are eaten up by
inflation.
   Professional grous rail against authoritarian government
officials, and even Collor's congressional allies are in open
rebellion.
   ``The government is growing increasingly isolated,'' said Walder
de Goes, a political science professor at the University of
Brasilia. ``It has lost almost all support from organized sectors
of society. The president must show a greater willingness to
negotiate and less arrogance.''
   Inflation has risen steadily since May. It totaled 13.7 percent
last month and many observers predict nearly 20 percent in
December.
   Business bankruptcies are up, unemployment is increasing and a
steep recession appears to be developing.
   Bad economic news has led to harsh public confrontations between
the government and businessmen, who had been Collor's most
enthusiastic backers. The president has said corporations cause
inflation by not reducing their profit margins.
   ``We need more love for our motherland instead of for only
what's in our pockets,'' he told Brazilian reporters during a trip
to Japan in November.
   In response, businessmen say they are being made scapegoats for
the administration's economic failures.
   ``Just because they're too incompetent to beat inflation, we
can't all be held responsible,'' Antonio Ermirio de Moraes,
director of the huge conglomerate Grupo Votorantim, said in an
interview with the Rio daily O Globo. He also said there were
``thieves'' in the government, and Justice Minister Jarbas
Passarinho threatened him with legal action.
   Jair Meneguelli, president of the Workers Central Union, the
largest and most radical labor federation, has threatened to
withdraw from government-sponsored talks on a national ``social
pact.''
   One round was postponed in November and Meneguelli said his
union would meet with its traditional enemy, the Federation of
Industries of Sao Paulo State, to draw up a joint proposal for the
``social pact'' negotiations.
   ``The government has reason to fear this union because capital
and labor have a strength, and that strength can change the
government's plans,'' said the union leader, who represents 12
million workers.
   Early in November, the Brazilian Bar Association urged Collor to
reverse a decree limiting the sex and violence content of
television programs in prime time. Tales Castelo Branco,
association president, said the decree was unconstitutional and
amounted to censorship.
   Presidential spokesman Claudio Humberto Rosa e Silva responded:
``I'd like to suggest the Association president return to school,
and if he lacks the humility to return to school, he should at
least read the constitution.''
   At a ceremony launching a low-income housing program, Collor
declared: ``No one is going to put a straitjacket on this
president. I'm going to continue to work for the needy, without
fear of those who want to continue oppressing our people with lies,
radicalism and violence.''
   A poll published by the newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo indicated
support for Collor's economic austerity measures was at a record
low. The survey, conducted in Brazil's 10 largest cities, found 43
percent of respondents opposed, 26 percent supporting Collor and
the rest neutral.
   In mid-November, the government suffered several important
defeats in Congress, where it technically has a comfortable
majority. Collor lost one vote, on retirement benefits, by a
humiliating 264-41.
   ``The government has a majority ... but not an organized
majority it commands,'' said Rep. Gastone Righi of the conservative
Brazilian Labor Party. Righi, who previously supported Collor, said
his party would now condition its support on economic results.
   Renan Calheiros, Collor's long-time political ally, quit as the
president's House leader and broke with the government. ``The
president is becoming crazy,'' Calheiros said in resigning. ``He
has a total contempt for Congress.''
   Villas Boas-Correa, a leading political analyst, said Collor was
lucky in the timing of his problems: Congress is due to recess
until March and the year-end holidays are approaching in the hot
southern hemisphere summer.
   ``Public opinion is basically shut down for the next few
months,'' he said. ``If the government can regain control of the
economy in the near future, Collor will be able to recoup at least
part of his prestige.''

   The disorder is often misdiagnosed in adults and
even when identified, some physicians are reluctant to prescribe
the proper medication - speed and related stimulants. It was
discovered that the ``hyperactive child'' syndrome persisted into
adulthood in 1971. But now scientists are upping the numbers for
the adult population.

<TEXT>
   Up to seven million American adults may be
suffering from a disorder they don't know they have. It was first
described in the medical literature in 1902, but its name is still
being debated.
   ``Most of these adults know something is wrong, but they don't
know what,'' says Dr. Alan Zametkin, a psychiatrist at the National
Institutes of Mental Health.
   Best known as the hyperactive child syndrome, the scientific
name is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Residual Type,
(ADHD,RT), when it persists into adulthood.
   In 1971, Dr. Paul Wender of the University of Utah, a pioneer in
the field, recognized that it sometimes persisted into adulthood.
Since then, researchers have found increasing numbers of adults
still suffering from the syndrome. It is now estimated that 40
percent to 60 percent of diagnosed childhood cases persist.
   About 3 percent to 6 percent of all children are diagnosed with
the disorder. It is the most common reason for referrals to mental
health specialists.
   It is generally accepted that it affects five times more boys
than girls, but University of Yale Medical School pediatrician Dr.
Sally Shaywitz believes girls are significantly undercounted.
   It is the ``squeaky wheel'' that gets referred: the child who
appears motor driven, cannot stay in his seat, cannot concentrate,
cannot wait for his turn, speaks out in classrooms, has a short
attention span, an insatiable need for attention, is very
impulsive, appears far too independent for his age, has few social
skills and frequently bullies other children.
   Two-thirds of ADHD children also suffer from a specific
development disorder, dyslexia being the most common.
   Those missed are often milder cases or very bright children who
really may not have to concentrate, children with no co-morbidity
and children who do not outwardly manifest the hyperactivity.
   Some adult cases, especially those not diagnosed in childhood,
can be difficult to diagnose. Other psychiatric problems may
accompany the disorder and physicians just aren't looking for it.
   ``The reason the diagnosis is often missed is that it is never
even considered,'' says Dr. Ivan Goldberg, a New York City
psychopharmacologist who treats adult cases.
   One who agrees is Dr. Barry Garfinkel, director of child and
adolescent psychiatry at the University of Minnesota and chairman
of the committee that will seek to redefine and perhaps rename the
disorder for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM IV), due
out in 1993.
   ``We trained doctors to believe ADHD disappeared with
adolescence. The patients whom we didn't train are way ahead of the
clinicians,'' says Dr. Garfinkel. ``If you throw in a patient
without the hyperactivity, the physician for sure would be at a
real loss in putting it all together.''
   The core of the disorder is the attention deficit, not the
hyperactivity, despite its name. The hyperactivity is the most
dramatically recognizable symptom. However, there are cases where
the hyperactivity is not present and the sufferer appears
hypoactive. Scientists say only 10 percent lack hyperactivity.
   The sad thing is that up to 85 percent can be helped with
medication. Most sufferers feel isolated and alone, not realizing
they have so much company, or that medication is available.
   The disorder, untreated, can destroy lives. Some women who
suspect something is wrong have chosen not to have children because
they did not want to pass along this monster with no name. Others
are working in jobs far beneath their intellectual abilities. The
prison population is probably rife with sufferers.
   Many adults retain traces of the hyperactivity, but have learned
to cope in such a way that it is not so evident, but the attention
deficit has not decreased.
   Zametkin's research using a PET scan on 25 ADHD adults and 50
normal controls was the lead article in the prestigious New England
Journal of Medicine on Nov. 15. An accompanying editorial by Dr.
Gabrielle Weiss of Montreal Children's Hospital said the findings
``represent a clear advance in our understanding'' of
hyperactivity.
   Zametkin found that the parts of the brain that control
attention don't work as hard as normal brains. It may be the best
evidence yet that an abnormality in the brain is at the root of the
problem.
   ``I'm not going to say it's the cause,'' said Zametkin. ``But
it's possible this has something to do with the cause.''
   Wender suggested that the cortex, the higher part of the brain,
may be sluggish because of faulty control signals from a more
primitive part of the brain.
   Dr. C. Thomas Gualtieri, a neuro psychiatrist at the University
of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. predicts that within five years
PET scans will be able to diagnose the disorder.
   That would certainly have helped one man. Blessed with
extraordinary intellectual gifts, he was hypoactive, and guesses he
saw 20 psychologists and psychiatrists before he got what is
probably the correct diagnosis: Attention Deficit Disorder without
Hyperactivity.
   He prefers to remain anonymous, but describes his attention
deficits.
   ``I claw for every word in reading, writing and speaking,'' he
says, appearing laconic as he struggles for precisely the right
word.
   His brain, fleet, agile, and retentive, is cursed to move at the
anguished gait of a tortoise. To even touch his gifts requires
Herculean efforts and untold time.
   Ignorance, here, would indeed be bliss, but that is not the
reality.

   The Great Lakes - Huron, Erie, Ontario, Michigan and Superior -
were for a period rich in history and lore, the main American
arteries of commerce.
   Timber to build cities floated down from the Canadian shores.
Iron ore to make steel sailed out of Superior. Grain, stone, coal
and copper filled cargo holds, but the ships also carried human
cargo and their belongings, fur traders, immigrants, pioneers,
laborers, homesteaders.
   The wooden boats and steel freighters never were a match for the
sudden fury of the inland seas, where unexpected west winds in an
afternoon can drive up waves three stories high.
   The Great Storm of 1913, a six-day blow, sank 10 ships and
killed 235 seamen. Gales from 1878 to 1898 ravaged nearly 6,000
ships and sank more than 1,000 of them.
   Modern ships have fared little better. In 1964, a Huron storm
tore the ore freighter Daniel J. Morell in half. Only one of its
crew of 29 survived. Eleven years later the freighter Edmund
Fitzgerald and its crew of 29 went down in Superior seconds after
the captain radioed that he was holding his own.
   The Great Lakes have become an archaeologist's paradise. Where
the water is deep and cold, decay is arrested and each wreck
remains a frozen moment of history.
   The preservation is so remarkable that bodies can last for
years, skeletons for centuries. Archaeologists excavating the wreck
of the Rockaway in Lake Michigan found the remains of salted meat
in the galley and rope made from corn leaves still sitting in a pot
used to mix caulking. The schooner went down in 1891.
   ``The sort of Hollywood concept of what a shipwreck looks like
actually exists in the Great Lakes,'' said Rockaway archaeologist
Ken Pott from his museum in South Haven, Mich. ``Short of a
skeleton lashed to the wheel, it's all there.''
   For example, the Hamilton and the Scourge, two Canadian
battleships from the war of 1812, went down in 300 feet of water in
Lake Ontario. Pott says a searcher using submersible cameras found
the ship intact, replete with cutlasses, cannons, guns, bones and
masts.
   But the conservation work of maritime archaeologists such as
Pott is up against an army of black marketeers and souvenir
seekers.
   Simple wood blocks that litter wrecks by the hundreds fetch $500
in an antiques store. Collectors will pay $10,000 for a ship's bell
or a wood steering wheel. A carved ship's figurehead is almost
priceless.
   Such stripping was legal in Michigan until 1980, when the state
passed a law allowing salvage only under permit. Wisconsin only
recently toughened its law. All of the Great Lakes states and
Ontario outlaw stripping to some degree. But some, such as
Michigan, are willing to grant salvage permits, especially to
divers picking up things for museums.
   Archaeological surveys take years. The pillage can occur
overnight. Witness the fate of the U.S. Coast Guard cutter
Mesquite.
   That crippled buoy tender was buried at sea last July, dropped
intact to the bottom of Lake Superior.
   The stripping started immediately: dinner plates from the boat's
galley, tools from the work rooms, hard hats from lockers, dress
jackets out of the closets of crew members.
   ``I am appalled at what happened,'' says Michigan archaeologist
John Halsey in Lansing. ``It was like a feeding frenzy. We're
talking in hours, in days.''
   Because of that, many explorers go to great pains to hide their
discoveries. Charles Feltner, an engineer for Ford Motor Co., found
the 1856 wreck of the brig Sandusky in the Straits of Mackinac. He
dove on it for years in secrecy. Then he made the find public.
   ``People stripped the thing in a couple of months,'' Feltner
says. ``Things like dishes, tools, all the blocks, belaying pins,
deadeyes, you name it.''
   The original ship's rams head figurehead no longer remains.
Divers bolted it back down after someone tried to steal it, too.
Would-be looters persisted until divers removed the original for
preservation and last year installed a look-alike.
   That was 10 years ago. Feltner thinks the advent of divers such
as Biniecki signals a change in ethic. Today, Feltner feels, the
looting would take years, not months.
   ``It's still bad enough to where divers 25 years from now aren't
going to have much to look at,'' Feltner says. ``The whole idea of
seeing a virgin wreck will be gone.''

<HEAD>DRY-EYED AND SHARP-WITTED: Sylvia Sidney at 80</HEAD>

   Barking. Dogs are barking. Two black Pugs.
   ``Petey! Malcolm!'' their owner, Sylvia Sidney, calls out.
``Quiet! You be quiet in there!'' The barking, heard from the
bedroom of her hotel suite, quickly fades.
   Animals hardly intimidate an actress who faced down football
players in ``Beetlejuice.'' Sidney is 80 years old, a tiny woman
built to last. Last spring, she caught pneumonia and was
hospitalized for several weeks, but she gets around quite well now,
not even needing a cane.
   Luck and ``excellent medical care'' are the secrets, she
insists. Also a strong mind. Sidney has no use for sentimentality.
She doesn't gush about her old movies, and shrugged off a tribute
being given by the Film Society of Lincoln Center on Nov. 30,
joking ``If they don't get to it now, God knows what is going to
happen.''
   Her colors today: black leather pants and matching vest, a black
turtleneck sweater, and gold rings and bracelets. The eyes are
blue-green, large and round, ready for anything. Acting is
listening, she notes, and just watching her eyes will give you an
idea of what she's thinking - lighting up when she's excited, or
rolling in disbelief.
   ``Ugh, God,'' she groans as she remembers Alfred Hitchcock's
``Sabotage,'' a 1936 thriller in which Sidney murders her husband
(Oscar Homolka) after discovering he's a saboteur.
   ``If you did not know I was already an established fine actress,
if you had never heard of me, had never heard of Homolka, you would
have looked at it and said, `What are those people doing?'
   ``It was all Hitchcock. It had nothing to do with people acting.
It was carefully timed. It was easy to indulge in the ego, `My
performance,' but it was because of Hitchcock. He was a cinema
man.''
   She's equally dry-eyed about today's movies. Most young
directors don't impress her. ``I think I'm too tough for
Spielberg,'' she snaps. Tim Burton of ``Beetlejuice'' is an
exception.
   ``I turned it down so many times because I couldn't understand
the script,'' says Sidney, who played a cranky social worker from
the great beyond. ``I finally had a long conversation with them,
and they said, `Read the script again.' I said you'll have to send
another one because I threw the other one away. So they sent me one
again.
   ``I had never heard of Tim Burton. He met me the morning I
arrived in California. We had breakfast together. We had lunch
together, and I was in love ... his sensitivity, how he thought
about scenes.''
   ``Look what happened with that film: Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis,
Winona Ryder. She was just a baby then. ... She used to hang around
me a lot. I think because her mother said, (whispering) `She's an
old actress.'''
   Sidney, a descendant of Russian Jews, was born Sophia Kosow in
New York City in 1910. Her parents were divorced when she was
young, and her mother took another husband, Dr. Sigmund Sidney, a
dental surgeon.
   She began taking dancing lessons at age 10 and was a teen-ager
when she made her stage debut, appearing in the title role of the
Theatre Guild's production of ``Prunella'' in 1926. After breaking
into films in the late '20s, Sidney became one of Paramount's five
leading actresses along with Claudette Colbert, Marlene Dietrich,
Miriam Hopkins and Carole Lombard.
   The others were tough and sharp-witted, the way Sidney is in
person. But her specialty, ironically, was playing victims: the
slum girl who loses her boyfriend to a socialite in ``An American
Tragedy'' (Shelly Winters had the same role in the 1951 remake, ``A
Place in the Sun''), the nice girlfriend of racketeer Gary Cooper
in ``City Streets,'' the nice girlfriend of falsely accused
murderer Spencer Tracy in ``Fury.''
   Tracy, James Cagney and other leading men were ``good guys, men
of the theater.'' She also has kind words for Cary Grant, who made
``Madame Butterfly'' with her in 1932, a poorly regarded film that
came out a few years before Grant became a major star.
   ``A few years ago, I got the surprise of my life,'' Sidney
recalled. ``They were showing `Madame Butterfly' up in Rochester
(N.Y.), and I came in at the end of the film. I saw a closeup of
Cary Grant, and it was one of the most extraordinary pieces of
acting I had seen. He was more talented than we thought he was.''
   She liked ``Fury'' director Fritz Lang, and William Howard, who
worked with her on the 1935 film ``Mary Burns Fugitive.'' Another
personal favorite is Rouben Mamoulian, the director of ``City
Streets,'' whom Sidney credits with helping her to develop as a
film actress.
   ``Oh, indeed, indeed,'' she says brightly. ``If it hadn't been
for Mamoulian, I wouldn't have been in films - ever. First of all,
I had great faith in him because I had known him in New York, and
he talked my language: theater. Also, I was thrown in that part so
quickly I didn't know which way was up. He said, `Don't worry, I'll
take care of you.'''
   Sidney endured quite well. In 1973, she received an Academy
Award nomination for best supporting actress for ``Summer Wishes,
Winter Dreams,'' in which she played Joanne Woodward's mother. She
won a Golden Globe in 1986, and was nominated for an Emmy for ``An
Early Frost.''
   She married three times, all ending in divorce, and had one
child, Jacob, who died in the mid-1980s of Lou Gehrig's disease -
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. (Sidney has done extensive work for
the National ALS Foundation).
   Now living in a house in Danbury, Conn., Sidney's hobbies
include gardening and needlepoint, about which she has written two
books. She also makes occasional trips to Manhattan.
   Her illness changed her priorities, she says, and she plans to
leave all her money to charities such as Covenant House, anything
to do with children.
   ``I plan to die without a nickel,'' she notes calmly. ``I will
be penniless, but not a pauper. It will all be gone, at least
what's in cash. The rest will be disseminated among my friends.''
   But Sidney has plenty to do right now. Malcolm and Petey are
barking again. It's lunchtime, their lunchtime; they need to be
fed. ``Quiet!'' she shouts. ``Be patient!'' Rice is on the menu,
one of their favorite dishes, a special treat for her beloved pets.
And as the actress turns and faces the bedroom there's no doubt
those dogs will eat every morsel.

   Before the tears dried, before the body was
cremated, T-shirts and posters hit the streets. In death, John
Lennon gained immortality - partly through his music and partly
through the merchandising efforts of his widow, Yoko Ono. On the
10th anniversary of his slaying, the author of ``Revolution'' and
``Working Class Hero'' has become a cottage industry.

   Imagine coffee mugs and tote bags. Imagine
greeting cards and prescription eyewear. Imagine doodles turned
into limited-edition prints.
   In the 10 years since John Lennon's murder, such items have
become part of the legacy of the ex-Beatle, eternal rebel and
author of such songs as ``Revolution,'' ``Working Class Hero'' and
``Gimme Some Truth.''
   Lennon's death on Dec. 8, 1980, ended his comeback after five
years as a reclusive homebody. But his name, face and voice are
still out and about, thanks largely to the enthusiastic efforts of
his widow.
   ``Since 1981, I promised myself and ... the fans that I would
keep on dishing out something of John's every year,'' Yoko Ono said
in an interview a few days before Lennon's 50th birthday on Oct. 9.
``I simply don't like the idea that John would just become a
library item.'
   A library item, no. But posthumously, Lennon has become a
cottage industry. Living in the cottage, of course, is Ono - and
her constant companion, Sam Havadtoy.
   Their office, Studio One, is on the ground floor of the Gothic
Dakota apartment house where Lennon was killed as Yoko looked on.
The wall behind Havadtoy's desk is covered with Lennon's photos and
album covers - a reminder of who still makes the money here.
   Attempts to cash in on Lennon's memory began even before his
body was cremated. Laura Senft recalls working in a Rochester,
N.Y., record shop the day after Lennon was shot, when she received
a phone call from someone peddling a John Lennon Frisbee. She hung
up, but offers of Lennon dinnerware and charm bracelets followed in
quick order.
   Ono was never involved in this flood of low-budget merchandise;
she spent her days holed up in the Dakota with son Sean. But a year
after the slaying, Ono was back running the Lennon empire.
   She ended the 1980s with a reported net worth of $500 million.
Yet she says ``bad karma'' dogged her through the decade:
   -``Double Fantasy'' producer Jack Douglas collected about $2.7
million in a settlement with Ono after suing her for royalties.
   -Elephant's Memory, the back-up band at Lennon and Ono's 1972
Madison Square Garden concert, sued for $70 million, claiming in
the process that Yoko was musically so inept that her keyboard was
unplugged during the show.
   -Ono had to pay an undisclosed amount to the writers of the song
``Makin' Whoopee'' for copyright infringement in her own song,
``I'm Your Angel.''
   -In his acerbic biography, ``The Lives of John Lennon,'' Albert
Goldman depicted the legend as a vain, anorexic hypocrite who spent
much of the last five years of his life in a drugged haze.
   -Fred Seaman, Lennon's former assistant, systematically stole
Lennon's diaries, tapes and slides from the Dakota. He pleaded
guilty to second-degree grand larceny and received five years
probation.
   -Ono locked horns with Lennon's ex-wife, Cynthia, over the best
way to mark John's 50th birthday. Yoko reportedly undercut
Cynthia's plans by refusing to allow any of Lennon's music to be
played at the latter's planned tribute; her own concert in
Liverpool was described as ``an uneven tribute'' in Rolling Stone.
   ---&equals;
   On the night of Dec. 8, 1980, John Lennon was returning home
with Ono after a session for her ``Walking on Thin Ice'' single. He
stepped from the limousine and moved toward the entrance of the
Dakota apartments.
   A demented fan, Mark David Chapman, was waiting on the sidewalk
with a copy of ``The Catcher in the Rye'' and a Charter Arms
.38-caliber revolver. After Lennon passed him, he opened fire.
   The slaying produced a worldwide outpouring of grief. Tens of
thousands of people gathered in New York's Central Park for a
ceremony that culminated in 10 minutes of silence; the Dakota front
gate became an instant shrine; three distraught fans committed
suicide.
   But even as John Lennon died, his legend had been born. Lennon
and Ono's ``Double Fantasy'' LP was climbing to the top of the
charts, and ``Starting Over'' was to become his most successful
single.
   Magazines were filled with Lennon's story: how he and Ono
rescued their relationship after Lennon's 18-month ``lost weekend''
in Los Angeles in the mid-'70s; how he took several years off to
help raise his son, Sean; how he had agonized about ever recording
and playing again.
   That image - prophet of peace and love, devoted family man,
seminal rocker - was virtually uncontested for eight years, until
the publication of Goldman's 719-page barrage. Goldman's Lennon was
a violent Liverpool thug who descended into a Howard Hughes-like
world of drugs and paranoia.
   But Lennon's life, so glaringly public and intensely documented,
served to refute some of Goldman's charges. ``Imagine,'' a movie
culled from vaults of previously unreleased film footage, showed a
healthy and happy Lennon making love to his wife, talking about
life and politics, singing his own songs.
   ``Imagine'' was just one of Lennon's many forays in the decade.
   Lennon was married to his first wife Cynthia when he met Ono at
a London art show in the late '60s. In short order, Lennon divorced
his wife, married Yoko and, in 1970, left the Beatles. John and
Yoko collaborated on everything: bed-ins, avant-garde films, music
and finally a son, Sean, born in 1975.

   At this point, Lennon says he became a househusband to their
child while Yoko ran the family business. The arrangement continued
until Lennon told the woman he called ``Mother'' it was time to
make music again. ``Double Fantasy'' followed just before John's
death, although it was not to be Lennon's swan song.
   Bruce Springsteen has released three albums since 1980; Michael
Jackson two. In contrast, Lennon - or, more accurately, Ono - has
released five albums: ``Milk and Honey,'' ``Menlove Ave.,'' the
movie soundtrack ``Imagine,'' the ``John Lennon - Live in New
York'' collection and a boxed CD collection for Christmas '90.
   In addition, ``The Lost Lennon Tapes,'' featuring hours of
unreleased Lennon music, became a popular syndicated radio program.
   Ono has overseen all these projects.
   ``People ask me, `What would he have done in the '80s?' I say,
`Let's talk about what he HAS done in the '80s,' because he has
definitely,'' she said. ``In spirit, I think he's alive, and we're
getting the benefit.''
   Others charge Ono with turning her memories into millions
without concern for Lennon's image. A Fame magazine profile derided
her as ``The Merry Widow''; the now-defunct weekly 7 Days described
her as the decade's ``premier celebrity civil defendant.''
   Greed, insensitivity, egomania. None of Ono's alleged faults are
apparent in an interview.
   In October, a barefoot Ono greeted a visitor to the Dakota in a
high-ceilinged first-floor room with white carpet and black onyx
walls. Curled up on a chair, she serenely sipped herbal tea from a
mug decorated with a Lennon drawing of John and Yoko with the
inscription, ``Grow Old With Me.''
   The mug is one of an assortment of Lennon collectibles available
(by appointment only) from Bag One Arts Inc., the entity that
controls reproductions of Lennon's art work.
   Some of that black on white artwork - which includes doodles
jotted down on napkins, the margins of letters or stray scraps of
paper - has been colorized or redone in neon at Ono's order.
   ``People would ask if we had anything in color,'' says Lynne
Clifford, who runs Bag One for Yoko. ``And Yoko said, `I feel
confident enough to add the color myself. So she took the original
sketches and we made plates and she added colors.''
   Lithographs that sold for $400 four years ago have increased as
much as 10 times in value, she says, and new ones cost between $600
and $700.
   Although Bag One's gallery a few blocks from the Dakota deals
primarily in lithographs, it also sells the collectibles, including
$3 laminated bags that bear Lennon's drawings.
   ``Yoko wanted everybody to be able to walk away with
something,'' explained Clifford.
   Where does all the money go?
   ``Yoko is very funny about (saying) where the money goes. ...
But some goes to the Spirit Foundation,'' she said. The foundation,
established by Lennon and Ono before John's death, has contributed
to causes ranging from a home for drug addicted children to
bulletproof vests for police officers.
   Is there anything that will never bear Lennon's sketch-work?
   Socks, Clifford said. ``Yoko said she couldn't imagine people
walking around on John's drawings.''
   Back at the Dakota, Ono receives a familiar question: Is this
all commercialism? Has the iconoclastic ex-Beatle been sold out?
   She laughs.
   ``No. I didn't sell out John. And I'm sure John would be happy
I'm still keeping him out there. ... There's a commercial aspect,
yes, but I mean, why not? I was a partner, and I still feel that
I'm a partner.''

<TEXT>
   Drummer Andy Newmark was touring with Roxy Music
in the summer of 1980 when he got the call that changed his life:
He was to play on John Lennon's new album.
   Lennon had been in virtual seclusion for five years, busy taking
care of his son, Sean, and admittedly out of songwriting ideas. But
in 1980, he suddenly felt inspired again and planned to return to
the studio to make an album with his wife, Yoko Ono.
   It was more than a superstar session. Afterall, Lennon gave no
press conferences, and didn't attend clubs or concerts. Rare photos
occasionally emerged and he looked different in each one (Lennon
jokingly referred to himself as ``Greta Hughes'' and ``Howard
Garbo'').
   Producer Jack Douglas, who had worked with Lennon as an
engineer, recruited Newmark, bassist Tony Levin, guitarist Hugh
McCracken and other New York-based sessions players. Recording was
to take place at the Hit Factory in Manhattan.
   To Newmark, Lennon was a hero and only a hero. He didn't know
him and was nervous about working with him. The drummer guessed he
was something like the intense, irreverent young man of the movies
``Help!'' and ``A Hard Day's Night.'' Lennon was those things - and
more.
   ``His personality seemed so consistent with all we had ever
heard about John Lennon,'' said Newmark, who still lives in New
York and works with former Roxy Music singer Bryan Ferry.
   ``His straightforwardness was as visible and apparant as the
stories and images we had created. I didn't see anything that
seemed startlingly new to the myth. It just appeared to be what we
had imagined: down to earth, direct, so direct it could not offend
people.''
   Newmark spent just one month in the studio, playing on the songs
that eventually ended up on ``Double Fantasy'' and ``Milk and
Honey,'' Lennon's final albums. It was the ``best experience of my
life,'' he insisted. ``The highlight of my career.''
   The nerves quickly settled. Once recording began, Lennon was
just a ``working musician'' with the same goal as everyone else:
finishing the album. The music was mostly mainstream pop; no
18-minute jams or political anthems. ``I hate all that fancy
stuff,'' Lennon told his drummer. ``Keep it simple, like Ringo.''
   He was a happy man at this point and his singing was higher,
sweeter than on earlier albums. Lennon was hoping to get back in
touch with his audience, and the songs were melodic, the production
lush.
   ``Dear Yoko'' and ``Grow Old With Me'' were tributes to his
wife. ``Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)'' was for Sean. Lennon defended
his self-imposed retirement on ``Watching the Wheels'' and summed
up his feelings about turning 40 on ``Borrowed Time,'' capping the
line ``Good to be older'' with a self-assured ``you bet.''
   Between takes, Lennon jammed on Buddy Holly songs and played
host. Sushi was the food of choice. The strongest drug was
Brazilian coffee, freshly ground. ``Guys, I'm taking off,'' Lennon
would say as he poured himself another cup.
   And there were plenty of stories about the Beatles - the
``B's,'' as John called them. Reunions were out of the question, a
return to adolescence in his opinion, but talking about the old
days seemed the nicest kind of high.
   ``By this time he was old enough to look upon the work they did
and be proud of it,'' Newmark said. ``When he talked about the
`B's,' it was as if it was his band. He was the spiritual leader. I
felt that a lot through the sessions.''
   By the fall, Newmark had finished working on the album, and his
contact with Lennon was limited to an occasional visit to the
studio. But he had planned on working with him again. ``Milk and
Honey'' was to come out the following year and Lennon wanted to
tour, using many of the same musicians.
   ``Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans,''
Lennon once sang.
   It took the drummer a long time to recover from Lennon's murder
the night of Dec. 8, 1980; he didn't even feel like working for the
next few years - everything else suddenly seemed ``second rate.''
   Newmark never listens to the record, but still hears ``Woman''
on the radio. When he thinks about it now, it's not so much a
particular song that hurts him, it's the day-to-day stuff: the
jokes and wisecracks, the coffee and the stories. No one had a
reason to remember all that at the time; those weren't supposed to
be farewell sessions.
   ``When I looked in his eyes, I felt a tremendous depth of
character and a tremendous understanding of the human condition, a
tremendous amount of compassion,,'' Newmark said. ``He was totally
friendly and open to everybody, including the janitor. He had time
for everybody. That working class hero thing, he was trying to be
real about that.''

<HEAD>Picture is Cloudy for Women and Power in the Land of Television</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>

   The numbers are black and white. The reasons
are decidedly gray.
   In prime-time television, 91 percent of all directors are men.
Of producers, 85 percent are men. Of writers, 75 percent are men.
   A yearlong study titled ``What's Wrong With This Picture?''
examined all 80 of last season's prime-time entertainment programs
for their treatment of women both behind the camera and in front of
it.
   Since its release by Women in Film and the Washington D.C.-based
National Commission on Working Women, the report's findings have
been called shocking, horrendous and bizarre by the few top-ranking
females in the business. But to ask why is to receive far more
muted answers.
   Lynn Loring, the president of MGM-Pathe Communications Corp.'s
television division, said discrimination is not easy to define.
   ``I feel it more than see it,'' Loring said. ``Like when I'm in
a room at an important meeting and there's 14 people at the
conference table. There's only one woman, and that's me.''
   There is a boy's club in television, said Loring, and they play
basketball together. ``But I can out-ski all of them,'' she added
with characteristic dry wit. ``I'm too short to play basketball.''
   Lengthy interviews with some of the most powerful female
television executives in Hollywood produced a wide range of
theories about why women are underrepresented in the TV industry.
   The most common: ``Television mirrors society.'' Until there is
equality for women in real life, most of the women said, there will
be none for females in the make-believe world of TV.
   The second most common response: ``I don't know.''
   Of the women interviewed for this story, not one said they had
suffered sexual discrimination. Rather, they said, discrimination
is so subtle and so far entrenched that it simply can be part of
the landscape.
   Discrimination does not always mean a casting couch experience.
Most of the time, these women said, it is insidious.
   But Betty Friedan, who helped launch the modern women's movement
with her book ``The Feminine Mystique,'' disagreed.
   ``They may have never been told `We wouldn't give you this show
because you're a woman.' But they're not giving shows to women. The
numbers don't lie. It represents a kind of unconscious myopia.''
   Friedan now heads Women, Men and Media, a research foundation
that reports on women's representation in the newspaper, magazine,
broadcast and film industries.
   The organization's reports have found that few newspaper
publishers are women and that network television correspondents
overwhelming tend to be men.
   Friedan calls the small number of female media executives ``a
symbolic annihilation of women.''
   The figures, she said, speak for themselves: ``You can't measure
what doesn't exist.''
   Of the 555 television characters surveyed in the Women in Film
study, with few notable exceptions, most female roles perpetuated
male fantasies of half-clad, half-brained women who needed to be
rescued.
   ``I would say that getting raped or being in jeopardy is
probably the No. 2 or No. 3 job on television and in films today,''
said Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, whose hit show ``Designing Women''
was one of a handful cited in the report as providing realistic
depictions of women.
   ``I'm so tired of women being depicted as mindless and
unadventurous, whining and victimized,'' Bloodworth-Thomason said.
``I'm embarrassed for my sex.''
   ``Designing Women'' chronicles the lives of the Sugarbaker
sisters and their two female colleagues, who own their own interior
design company in Atlanta. None of the women is mindless,
unadventurous or victimized.
   Not one `` has to have a man to be happy,'' Bloodworth-Thomason
said. ``They talk about Newsweek and rock lyrics and bad doctors.
They talk about the same things that men talk about.''
   Bloodworth-Thomason, who with her husband, Harry Thomason, also
produces ``Evening Shade'' the new CBS series starring Burt
Reynolds, Marilu Henner and Hal Holbrook, was asked why there
aren't more women directing, producing and writing for television.
   ``I don't know,'' she replied. ``There is a good ol' boys
network. You have to have something that they want so bad, you can
penetrate the network.''
   The programming chiefs of NBC, CBS, ABC and the Fox Broadcasting
Co. all are men. None would comment for this story.
   Besides ``Designing Women,'' the report lauded ``Murphy Brown''
and its acerbic title character, played by Candice Bergen, and
``China Beach,'' and its lead character, the multifaceted nurse
Colleen McMurphy, played by Dana Delany.
   John Sacret Young, executive producer and co-creator of ``China
Beach,'' called the report's statistics ``pretty shocking.''
   But, he added, ``In the '60s and '70s, women were making great
strides. There was a door that was open very wide. Our society is
now wrestling with a conservative leaning that has helped make that
opening smaller.''
   Loring, of MGM-Pathe, wonders if the whole problem of
discrimination - television or no - might not be moot today if
society was better at teaching equality than jumping up and down
about it.
   ``If in the last 10 years we had spent more time educating our
children ... that girls can throw footballs, too, I don't think
we'd be in the shape we're in today,'' she said.
   She also wonders why she doesn't hear more from women who want
an equal opportunity in television.
   ``Out of the hundreds of writers who pitch to me, maybe 5
percent are women. You tell me why, when there's a woman president
of a major television division ... why are those women not calling
here to pitch to me? I have had one call this entire season about a
female director to maybe 250 calls about men directors.''
   The women who have attained power in the land of television say
they probably didn't experience overt discrimination because they
are not the types to be silent about it.
   ``There are things I won't accept as a human being, and I won't
accept that,'' Loring said.
   So she has never felt that her sex was a problem?
   Loring laughed. ``I think my insolence and arrogance is worse,''
she replied.
   Suzanne dePasse, the Emmy-winning executive producer of
``Lonesome Dove'' and president of Gordy-dePasse Productions
(formerly Motown Productions), calls herself the ultimate
hyphenate.
   ``I will always be defined as a black woman producer,'' said
dePasse. ``It has been my experience that there is only one true
way to have any impact and that is to do good work.''
   Being militant about equal representation is not the answer,
dePasse said. Neither is getting angry.
   The only way to get more women into high positions is to let
your good work speak for itself and to help other women on the way,
said dePasse, echoing statements made by the other female
executives.
   ``As much as I hate it, I'm not willing to chuck my career in
the porcelain receptacle to call attention to something that's
obvious,'' dePasse said.
   ``I can do far more in the position that I'm in than if I go
burn a cross on the door of Walt Disney studios.''

   In a close-knit town of 1,400 people, word
has a way of getting around.
   Some folks now say it was known for years that Douglas Marks was
molesting his male students. But no one did anything about it.
   How could it continue for three decades? Marks' reputation as a
devoted teacher? People's unwillingness to believe such improbable
allegations? The young victims' reluctance to talk? His wealthy and
influential family, which includes a brother who once was speaker
of the Montana House?
   School board chairman David Rieder dissects each theory, and
finally concludes that he just doesn't know.
   ``It was fairly common knowledge of his sexual preference,''
said Rieder, a rancher who has known Marks all his life. ``With all
the psychological problems Doug had ... for some reason, these red
flags went unheeded.
   ``I think there's a tendency for everyone to submerge these bad
thoughts. I think people tend not to want to deal with the darker
side of life - and I include myself in that.''
   Boulder's loosely kept secret went public in February when
Marks, 63, was charged with molesting four of his students between
1985 and 1989.
   He pleaded guilty and was sentenced Nov. 14 to 20 years in
prison and ordered to pay $25,000 for counseling for his young
victims.
   County Attorney Richard Llewellyn said he knows Marks molested
at least 45 students, including sons of victims he attacked a
generation ago. But some residents and victims say it's likely
Marks molested several hundred students during the past three
decades.
   All the victims didn't remain silent.
   ``We know now that they told some people,'' Rieder said.
   The school board has hired two investigators to determine if
teachers, principals or counselors failed to protect students.
   It was Dr. Phillip Pallister, a physician who forced the school
board to oust Marks from Boulder's high school in 1959 for
molesting three students, who forced officials to investigate
again, 30 years later.
   It also was Pallister who helped Marks get another teaching job
in 1960 at nearby Clancy - where officials say four to five
students may have been molested - and Pallister who encouraged the
Boulder School Board to rehire Marks as an elementary school
teacher in 1965.
   ``I thought of him as a homosexual then, not as a pedophile,''
Pallister said, calling his decision a terrible mistake.
   Paul Myrhow, now 24, said he first was molested by Marks in a
school restroom in 1980 after a seventh-grade sex education class
Marks had volunteered to teach. Their relationship continued for
years.
   Myrhow blew the whistle twice, the first time in 1985, when he
approached Daryl Craft, a longtime friend who had become a
Jefferson County deputy sheriff.
   Craft did not doubt the story - he, too, had been molested by
Marks.
   ``In my graduating class, more than half were victims,'' said
the deputy, who graduated in 1973 with 12 to 14 other boys. ``If
Paul hadn't come forward, I don't have any doubt that Doug would
still be doing the same thing.''
   And Marks did do the same thing - for five more years. All four
of the offenses to which he pleaded guilty in July occurred after
Myrhow first reported him.
   Craft took Myrhow to Sheriff Tom Dawson, who later told the
deputy that he was having trouble locating victims and witnesses
Myrhow had named. Pallister said he knows the sheriff investigated,
but no charge was filed, and Marks continued to teach.
   The sheriff won't talk about it.
   Myrhow said he believes Marks molested boys in every class,
every year, but that the boys apparently never told one another.
   ``Sometimes I think he would be molesting every male in his
class, and sometimes only one or two,'' Myrhow said.
   Marks began ``recruiting'' boys in elementary grades with
touching and petting, then arranged to take them on school trips in
the seventh or eighth grades, Myrhow said.
   ``He'd usually take three kids, because if you had two double
beds one would get stuck with sleeping with him.''
   Myrhow is certain that townspeople knew what was going on.
   At a bar that Marks favored, Myrhow said, ``Doug would come in
for a sandwich and when he left, people would joke about who he was
taking on trips this year.''
   Llewellyn said he doubts the molestation was widely known in
this Rocky Mountain ranching and mining town. Some victims told him
their parents did not believe them, and some said they did not tell
their parents.
   ``Some tried to tell some school people, but the message
oftentimes was missed,'' Llewellyn said. ``Some of the victims
apparently were trying to tell people for some time.''
   Myrhow persisted. In June 1989, he made his second effort to
expose Marks. This time, he went to Pallister.
   Pallister took Myrhow to Llewellyn, who asked the state attorney
general's office for help. But when school began, Marks still was
teaching, and Pallister found that none of the victims Myrhow had
identified had been contacted.
   Pressed by Pallister, Llewellyn hired his own investigator in
December and accumulated enough evidence within two months to file
charges.
   As a teacher, there's no argument Marks was widely admired. He
quietly donated part of his salary to the school each year, spent
vacations painting the school, and bought shoes for needy students.
Two sections of the high school were dedicated to him. Wall
plaques, quietly removed after his guilty plea, extolled ``his
years of service to the community.''
   But eyebrows were raised over the fact that Marks lived in the
elementary school except on weekends, sleeping on a cot in the
nurse's room.
   ``That bothered me,'' Rieder said. ``But I didn't do anything.''
   Though some people still strongly defend him, Rieder said Marks
had steady detractors.
   ``There were people who wanted him out of there,'' Rieder said.
``There was a lot of anger, things under the surface. I was hoping
Doug would resign for several years.
   ``I'm tired of hearing he was such a good teacher that it
justifies anything. He was harming kids in ways other than the
sexual molesting - psychological abuse.''
   Lillian Larson, a substitute teacher who graduated from high
school with Marks in 1944, is one who fears the good he did will be
forgotten. She does not dispute that he is guilty, though she says
many of the offenses were ``patting and pinching'' and have been
overblown by the news media.
   ``I don't know how to tell you how I feel about it,'' she said.
``Guilty is guilty. It's just that I feel sorry for him. He's my
friend.''
   Why did it take 30 years to stop Marks?
   ``I don't think the system failed,'' said former school board
chairman Jan Anderson. ``It worked just right.'' Marks is out of
the classroom at last, and that's the important thing, she said.
   It will be four years before Marks is eligible for parole; one
condition imposed by the sentencing judge would prohibit him from
having contact with anyone younger than 18.
   The long-term effects on his victims - and on the town of
Boulder - are uncertain.
   The school board has set aside an initial fund of $3,000 for
students who request counseling, and some have responded, Rieder
said.
   ``I think in the long run we're going to be a community where
any kind of abuse - sexual or otherwise - simply is not going to
happen again,'' he said.
   ``I guess we'll never know the full extent of it. I guess that's
part of the shock of it.''

<HEAD>Without Strong Leader, Economic Plan at Impasse</HEAD>

   Zhang Yueliang set out from Qufu in northeastern
China with five tons of fresh grapes in his truck. By the time he
reached his destination 550 miles down the coast, he'd lost the
grapes and nearly his shirt.
   All along the way, he found roadblocks set up by local
governments charging for the right to pass. He handed over his
cash, a tarpaulin, finally grapes. When Zhang reached the buyer
five days late, the remaining grapes were rotten.
   The People's Daily told Zhang's story, and quoted him as saying:
``If they don't get the roadblocks under control, no one will dare
work in transport.''
   Beijing once could have solved the problem with an edict
prohibiting such local customs barriers. Today, regional conflicts
are too strong and the central government's moral and economic
power has eroded.
   As national leaders try to develop an economic plan to lead the
country into the 21st century, they are forced to consider not just
what will work or be ideologically correct, but what strong special
interests will accept.
   The one man who used to keep everyone working together,
86-year-old Deng Xiaoping, has lost prestige since endorsing the
army attack on pro-democracy demonstrators last year. His public
appearances are rarer than ever, and appeals to his authority
appear to have little effect.
   Nothing illustrates the leadership vacuum better than the
government's inability to produce new Five- and Ten-Year Plans, the
basic blueprints of China's economy. The current plans expire Dec.
31.
   Premier Li Peng has said the Central Committee of the ruling
Communist Party will meet before year's end to discuss new plans.
   Before that, the party wants a consensus among provincial and
central officials on spending priorities, new development projects
and economic reforms. Drafts have been circulated and meetings
held, but there are few signs of progress.
   Provincial governments are competing for state aid and other
favors.
   ``I suggest that all keep a clear head,'' Li told one gathering
of provincial officials after apparently being besieged by
petitions for new development zones.
   All five existing Special Economic Zones, areas of capitalist
experimentation and technological growth, are along the coast, and
Western provinces want a share. They also seek higher prices for
their coal, iron and other raw materials, which are sold to eastern
factories at discount rates.
   An influential government economist, Ma Hong, publicly endorsed
the western provinces' plea last week and advocated giving the
region more freedom to experiment. That indicates a deal may have
been struck.
   There has been no agreement to get rid of the provincial customs
barriers, which went up in the past year as regional officials
tried to reserve their markets for local products during a
nationwide decline in consumption.
   Conflicting regional interests are not the only fragmenting
force. Officials with opposing ideological positions are struggling
for personal power and control of China's future.
   Most unusual is the inclusion of widely divergent views in the
official media, which generally stress uniformity.
   Leading economists who met this month were quoted as advocating
such radical reforms as turning state factories over to public
shareholders and letting the market determine most prices.
   Conservatives who halted the momentum of reform two years ago
want two more years of slow growth, but are mindful of communism's
collapse elsewhere and concede some reform is needed to save China
from a similar fate.
   ``Without reform, it is impossible to show (communism's)
superiority and increase its attractiveness,'' said government
spokesman Yuan Mu, a leading conservative.
   He said the market must play a role, but that state planning and
ownership should remain dominant.
   That was the idea 10 years ago when Deng first grafted limited
free markets and private enterprise onto China's planned economy.
The free market was to be a supplement.
   In practice, the unplanned sector has flourished while the
favored state sector has wilted.
   Fewer than one-third of state factories will make a profit this
year and the government will pay $11.5 billion to bail out the
rest, according to official figures.
   Factories outside the state plan, including private ones and
those set up by villages and towns, now produce half the gross
national product.
   A Western diplomat in Beijing said the era of planners may be
over.
   ``The economy has become so complex,'' she said, on condition of
anonymity. ``The information revolution has overtaken (China), to
say nothing of the need for speedy product development. A planned
economy can't react quickly enough.''
   Perhaps Deng has recognized this.
   Recently, he called for ``better, more rapid and more
effective'' reforms. His remarks were made public by a leading
economic official, Chen Jinhua, but received only passing notice
and seemed to have no impact on the Five-Year Plan debate.
   In the words of a Western banker who deals with leading Chinese
economists: ``The battle is continuing. I'm not at all clear that
we will have anything released, except platitudes, for a good
while.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush's Persian Gulf policy is being
tested on the home front in Senate hearings this week and next,
forums for debate and defense of the course that threatens war with
Iraq.
   Force, at least the threat of it, is an option Bush wants
strengthened, not put into question. To that end, he needs solid,
not slipping support in Congress and the country.
   Congressional policy questions could serve his aim, but only if
the administration can deliver answers that rally political support
for the president's course.
   And there also is the risk that policy hearings will reinforce
doubts. That's happened before: Senate hearings became an early
rallying point for opposition to Vietnam War policy a generation
ago.
   Since debate is inevitable in a prolonged confrontation, the
administration task will not be easy. As Secretary of State James
A. Baker III observed, democracy can sometimes be messy.
   That's a special problem in the 16th week of a crisis in which
the threatening message is crucial, but the public support behind
it appears to be fraying. The White House has said the
administration welcomes a national discussion of the U.S. role in
the Persian Gulf - but that differing views should signal no lack
of will or purpose in confronting Iraq.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee opens three days of hearings
on Tuesday. Baker is to testify before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee on Dec. 5, as part of a two-day policy review there.
House hearings are likely, too.
   While Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney had spoken approvingly of
public hearings and the debate they will bring, he is not on the
witness list for next week's sessions. He had been invited to lead
off, but neither he nor other administration officials were on the
schedule issued Wednesday.
   That yields the first phase of the public review to statements
by former Cabinet and defense officials, some of them critical of
administration policy.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the committee chairman, has raised
critical questions about it, too, since Bush's Nov. 8 order that
U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia be doubled to about 400,000. In
inviting Cheney to testify, Nunn said he wanted to ask about the
rationale for that move.
   Nunn, the Democrats' leading man on defense matters, has said
that if those forces are to be used in an offensive operation, Bush
must get congressional approval in advance. He says the
reinforcements represented a chance in policy, from the original
mission of deterring any Iraqi move against Saudi Arabia and
enforcing the United Nations economic embargo.
   Nunn also has questioned the wisdom of a course that could lead
to a ground war in the desert, suggesting that air power could be
used instead if it comes to combat. In addition, he has asked how
the administration would meet U.S. military responsibilities
elsewhere in the world with so large a force committed to the
Middle East.
   Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, have appeared twice before at open congressional hearings on
the Persian Gulf operation. So has Baker. And all of them have been
back to the Capitol to brief groups of senators and House members
in closed sessions. Bush says he has been consulting with Congress,
too, ``more than any other president in history.''
   But that process didn't work to the congressional satisfaction
before Bush announced the increase in troop strength. There was
advance notice to some congressional leaders, but others were
missed. They were told, not consulted.
   The expansion led to debate and in turn to a Republican
suggestion that Congress be called to emergency session to vote on,
and presumably for, Persian Gulf policy. The White House didn't
like that idea, nor did Democratic congressional leaders, who
settled on policy hearings instead.
   Cheney said open public hearings will be a forum for debate, and
that's as it should be, to air the issues he and Powell have
debated with skeptics in closed sessions. He said it needs to be
done without giving Saddam Hussein cause to doubt the U.S.
commitment to stand firm against him.
   ``We should have democratic debate in this country, particularly
on issues that are as fundamental as the issues we are here dealing
with,'' Baker said before his latest overseas mission seeking to
strengthen the alliance against Iraq. ``But in the course of that
debate, we should do everything we can to try and send a consistent
and uniform signal.''
   That assumes debate will lead to consensus.
   Sometimes it does.

   ``C'mon girls,'' a man in the doorway of
the dairy barn shouted. ``Come o-o-on, get in here!''
   From the dirt path came the steady sound of hooves and the
lilting melody of a Japanese song. The Brown Swiss cows, horns
intact, came around the corner first. Behind them was Yumiko Kan,
swinging a short stick and singing.
   She came from Japan to Camphill Village Kimberton Hills for a
three-year training course in biodynamic farming. She's learning to
treat cows with homeopathic medicines, grow crops without
chemicals, enrich soil by burying manure in cow horns and
understand cosmic rhythms.
   The farmers and trainees, from all over the world, also come for
a chance to live communally and provide a social service. Roughly
one-third of the 130 people who live and work at Kimberton Hills,
including the man in the dairy barn, are mentally handicapped. The
farm, about 30 miles west of Philadelphia, is owned by Camphill
Village U.S.A.
   The land is farmed without pesticides, herbicides or artificial
fertilizers. Farmers rely on crop rotation, composting and a
``living'' soil to produce healthy crops.
   The 420-acre farm has fields of corn, wheat, oats, barley,
soybeans and hay. Vegetable gardens, orchards and hilly pastures
for sheep and cows complete the landscape.
   Not many farmers understand or accept the biodynamic approach
and its combination of science and spiritualism.
   ``The few who have (heard of biodynamic) refer to it as cow
(dung) and horns,'' said Roger Wentling, an agronomist. ``It's not
a viable option to them.''
   But Wentling, who worked several years for the federal Soil
Conservation Service, said he has seen the benefits, citing a farm
couple who used several methods to grow oats.
   ``The oats they had looked good until I got to see the
biodynamic oats,'' he said. ``I've never seen oats look that good,
and I've walked farms for over 10 years.''
   There are about 100 biodynamic farms in North America, with
pockets in Pennsylvania, North Dakota, Northern California, New
England and Wisconsin, said Rod Shouldice, director of the national
Biodynamic Farming and Gardening Association, based in Kimberton.
   Shouldice said the largest concentration is in southern Ontario,
where government policies allow biodynamic farms to operate more
profitably.
   Biodynamic farmers say their methods are discriminated against
by U.S. subsidy programs, which reward single-crop agriculture and
a high use of chemicals for increased yield.
   There are signs of change, however, as support grows in Congress
and the Department of Agriculture for what is known as low-input
sustainable agriculture.
   LISA seeks to reduce the use of chemical pesticides and
fertilizers, thereby reducing farmers' costs and damage to the
environment. A section of the 1990 farm bill authorizes $40 million
a year to pursue these methods, an eightfold increase over the
previous bill.
   ``A lot of it has to do with the changing perspective of the
public that chemicals need to be reduced in our environment,'' said
John Haber, staff member of the Senate Agriculture Committee.
   Howard Kerr, director of the USDA's Office of Small Scale
Agriculture, resents the attention, and funding, given to LISA.
   ``If it works for them, we should support them,'' he said. ``But
to say it's the path for everybody, I don't buy that.''
   Cost-effectiveness is difficult to measure, Kimberton Hills
farmers said, bristling even at the question. ``And who will pay
the cost of groundwater pollution?'' asked Michael Wildfeuer, the
dairyman. ``Biodynamics puts value back into the land.''
   The aim of organic farmers has never been to produce the most
for the least amount of money, and the issue is further complicated
at Kimberton Hills.
   The farm is part of the international Camphill movement of 75
communities worldwide. The handicapped people work the farm and
benefit from being contributing members of the community.
   The dairy is the center of the farm's operation.
   ``Cows are magic,'' he said. ``They go out and eat grass, and
then they come back and give milk. They make manure and they give
meat. They give back to the land and to humanity.''
   In return, Wildfeuer said the farm's 30 dairy cows live as
naturally as possible. They graze in large pastures and keep their
horns. In conventional dairies, horns are usually removed to
prevent cows from hurting one another when kept in close quarters,
he said.
   The preparations are what many people focus on, perhaps because
they sound mysterious and strange. In one preparation, fresh cow
manure is packed into cow horns and buried for six months during
the winter.
   When the horns are dug up, the manure has become compost,
changing in a way it would not change if it were not in a horn,
said Jim Barausky, who manages the field crops at Kimberton Hills.
   Barausky said one horn is prepared for each acre. The compost is
combined with water, stirred for an hour in a vortex and then
sprayed on the fields in the evening.
   ``It stimulates root hairs - that's been pretty clearly
demonstrated,'' he said. ``It makes a big difference in plants,
especially if there's a drought that year.''
   Barausky is sensitive to what he said is too much emphasis on
the preparations. He said biodynamics was one of the earliest forms
of organized organic agriculture and pioneered many methods,
including composting, which have since become standards.
   What has kept biodynamics apart, Barausky said, is its
philosophy. Biodynamics grew out of a series of lectures given in
1922 in Silesia, a region in southwestern Poland, by the late
Rudolf Steiner, a philosopher known for anthroposophy, meaning
wisdom of man.
   Barausky said biodynamics incorporates science and spiritualism.
Scientific research has been used to prove some biodynamic methods,
he said, but unlike laboratory experiments, plants do not respond
the same way for everyone.
   ``It seems to be something else that's involved there, which
then people don't understand, and therefore it opens this whole
realm of questions,'' he said. ``Some of the questions go into what
people call the occult ... almost superstitions, which I think
biodynamics doesn't want to fall into.''
   Despite the criticism, the farm sells most of the crops it
produces and three-fourths of the milk, Barausky said. The milk is
not pasteurized or homogenized, and he said there is a larger
market for raw milk than the farm can supply.

<HEAD>Researchers Studying Expanded Uses of Oil Eating Bacteria</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PENSACOLA BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The use of oil-eating microbes has
become an accepted and safe method of cleaning up oil spills, but
not a panacea, researchers say.
   Scientists who used fertilizers to speed the biological
degradation of Alaska's massive oil spill are pleased with the way
bioremediation worked there.
   They are skeptical at best, however, about claims of overnight
success on a spill in the Gulf of Mexico and the performance of
laboratory-grown, rather than natural, bacteria.
   ``It's not a magic cure,'' said James Clark, an aquatic
biologist at the Environmental Protection Agency lab in this
panhandle barrier island community. ``There are times when it won't
be very effective.''
   Clark represents EPA in a joint program with Exxon and the
Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation. It began last year
after the tanker Exxon Valdez spilled nearly 11 million gallons of
crude oil in Alaskan waters.
   In 1989, fertilizers were applied to 74 miles of shoreline to
make oil-eating microbes already present grow and devour the crude
faster.
   It was the first time bioremediation had been used on a U.S.
spill and the largest such project ever undertaken. Prior uses have
included treatment of sewage and hazardous wastes.
   ``The monitoring and research show that it had no adverse
ecological effects. We saw no algae blooms, no toxicity to the
fish,'' Clark said. ``The basic understanding of increasing the
bacteria by adding nutrients is going to be an accepted
technique.''
   Bioremediation, however, represented only a fraction of the
cleanup effort in Alaska, where 1,245 miles of coastline had been
coated with oil.
   Studies show nitrogen and phosphorous fertilizer, some of it
just like that used on lawns and gardens, increased the degradation
rate by 30 percent to 50 percent, Clark said.
   That still means it could take from a few weeks to four years,
depending upon the amount of oil present, to complete the
decomposition, he said.
   The next step in the laboratory and at spills is to see how
bioremediation strategies may vary from site to site. ``We may have
to use different kinds of fertilizers or do something different in
the Gulf of Mexico than Alaska,'' Clark said.
   Texas officials in July claimed a major success for
bioremediation. They applied 100 pounds of laboratory-produced
microbes to one acre of an oil slick in the gulf from the June 8
explosion of the supertanker Mega Borg, 57 miles off Galveston.
   It was the first time bioremediation had been used in open
water. Texas Land Commissioner Garry Mauro said surface oil was
reduced by 30 percent in some samples a day after the application,
while no such reduction was found in an untreated portion of the
slick.
   ``We remain skeptical of the results,'' Clark said. ``Our
studies have shown oil degradation occurs in the course of days and
weeks, not hours. It's very hard for us to understand how it would
degrade overnight.''
   Clark called the controversy ``a touchy issue'' for EPA, which
officially says more research is needed about bioremediation at
sea.
   A blunter assessment came from Jim Mueller, a microbiologist for
Southern BioProducts, an Atlanta-based bioremediation company EPA
has hired to help with research.
   ``I don't think it worked. I think they sank the oil,'' Mueller
said. ``Studies we have done with very high concentrations of
organism, optimum nutrient, optimum temperature, (show) it still
takes days and weeks.''
   Experiments are under way with two brands of commercially grown
microbes, but preliminary evidence shows they are no better than
natural bacteria, Clark and Mueller said.
   On the other hand, research on new ways to apply fertilizers has
been promising.
   In Alaska, a special oil-attracting fertilizer known as Inipol
EAP 22, made only by the French company Elfe Aquitaine, was sprayed
in liquid form. Garden-variety water-soluble fertilizer was applied
in granular form with lawn spreaders.
   While Inipol has been more effective in cleaning up visible oil,
water-soluble fertilizers are better at seeping below the surface.
   Mueller is experimenting with simply hosing down oil-tainted
shores with water-soluble fertilizer in liquid form.
   ``Potentially what we can do is get on a boat with a fire hose
and just blast the beaches with soluble nutrient, let the rocks
bathe in it during low tide,'' he said.
   That would make application simpler and cheaper. Bioremediation
already costs less than most other cleanup methods.
   Bioremediation in the past has cost about as fourth as much as
incineration for cleaning up hazardous waste sites, Mueller said.
Clark figured the price difference would be at least that much for
oil cleanups in which the alternatives include physically wiping
off rocks or dumping them in landfills.

<HEAD>Physicist Claims Einstein's Wife Helped Develop Theory of
Relativity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX DOMINGUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ABERDEEN, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Albert Einstein's letters, and the example
of couples like the Curies, contributed to the belief that his
theory of relativity was a collaboration between Einstein and his
first wife.
   Evan Harris Walker, a research physicist at the Army's Aberdeen
Proving Grounds, said there are a dozen instances in which Einstein
referred to ``our work'' in letters to his first wife Mileva
Einstein-Maric.
   ``It becomes clear from what he has to say himself that Mileva
played a significant role in the early work,'' Walker said
recently.
   Several Einstein historians disagree.
   But Louis Pyenson, a science historian at the University of
Montreal, said such a collaboration would not be unusual
considering the number of other well-known husband and wife
scientific teams at the turn of the century, including Marie and
Pierre Curie, known for their work in radioactivity.
   Walker said his theory also would help solve a puzzle over the
development of his landmark theory. Einstein denied later in life
that previous work on the speed of light by the American physicist
Albert Michelson influenced his work.
   Walker said the influence likely came from Einstein-Maric.
   In one letter, Walker noted, Einstein wrote: ``How happy and
proud I will be when the two of us together will have brought our
work on the relative motion to a victorious conclusion.''
   The letters were part of the Einstein papers published in 1986
by Princeton University, where he worked for several years.
   The theory of relativity was the foundation for much of physics
since Einstein published three groundbreaking papers in 1905 that
eventually led to his winning the Nobel Prize in 1921. The theory
deals with the relationship between time and space and proposes
that time moves slower for objects traveling at greater speeds.
   ``I don't see that there's any evidence she contributed in the
way they claim,'' said Clifford Will, a physics professor at the
McDonnell Center for Space Science at Washington University in St.
Louis. ``I guess they looked at some of the letters and tried to
infer she was involved.
   ``Part of this is the myth that Einstein needed help with
mathematics, and there is simply no evidence in his career that
this is true,'' Will said. ``The mathematics in relativity is
simple. All that was needed to develop the theory was physical
insight, the brilliant physical insight that Einstein had.''
   Einstein-Maric, a mathematician and physicist, was several years
older than Einstein, who was in his early 20s when he began work on
relativity, and may have been the leader early on, Walker said.
   The two met as students at the Swiss Federal Institute of
Technology in Zurich and were married in 1904, a year before
Einstein published the three papers. Strengthening Walker's case is
their 1919 divorce agreement, in which Einstein agreed his former
wife would receive any Nobel Prize proceeds Einstein might win.
   The case for her role also is bolstered by a German research
linguist, Senta Troemel-Ploetz, of the German Research Society in
Bonn. She reported reading an account by the late Russian
physicist, Abram Joffe, who said he had seen the original
manuscript of the paper on special relativity with the names of
Einstein and his wife on it, Pyenson said.
   Walker said Einstein-Maric studied in Heidelberg, Germany, where
Michelson had visited several years earlier.
   ``Without Michelson, the problem the theory of relativity would
have answered wasn't there. That's why physicists said the theory
was puzzling,'' Walker said. ``Mileva was on the scene and had
access to information of that sort and she probably played the role
of inseminating those ideas.''
   Light, like other waves, had been thought to require a medium,
dubbed the ether, to travel through. Some physicists theorized that
because Earth was moving through this substance it would slow down
or speed up light, depending on the direction the light was
traveling in relation to the ether.
   Michelson's experiments in the late 19th century compared the
amount of time it took two beams of light pointed in different
directions to travel from their source, bounce off a mirror and
return. Despite repeated attempts at increasing distances, the
times were always the same, confusing scientists.
   Einstein's 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect of light
disproved the ether theory.
   ``On one paper she helped with the mathematics, and on the
papers on relativity and light, she did something very
fundamental,'' Walker said. ``That she helped is beyond question.
It's the degree of help.''
   Einstein-Maric studied under Phillip Lenard, a German physicist,
and most likely brought to Einstein's attention Lenard's work on
light, Walker said.
   ``It is true we don't have any direct evidence for precisely
which equation Einstein's first wife told Albert about. That kind
of information is seldom available,'' Pyenson said.
   ``What does seem clear, and there is no question, is the pattern
of young physicist couples in the 1900s is a clear trend in
Europe,'' he said. ``All you have to do is look at the Curies.''

<HEAD>Doctors Learning the Gift of Gab</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM STRADER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barry Alpert is learning that the gift of gab
can be as critical to his medical practice as skill with a scalpel.
   Doctors say poor communication with patients is a leading cause
of missed diagnoses. Lawyers say the problem is cited in many
malpractice lawsuits.
   ``A lot of malpractice cases go away simply because they like
the doctor,'' said Pittsburgh attorney Edwin H. Beachler III.
   Alpert, a cardiologist at West Penn Hospital in Pittsburgh, said
he can't evaluate his own communications skills. But he said
patients have come to him after having difficulty dealing with
other doctors.
   He said he suspects some of his own former patients may have the
same complaint about him.
   Alpert is not alone. Roughly 80 percent of 300 doctors surveyed
nationwide by the pharmaceutical division of Miles Inc. regard
effective communication with patients as ``extremely important'';
only one-third said they communicate ``very well.''
   ``A lot of physicians are exceptionally sensitive about their
relationships with their patients,'' Alpert said. They don't want
to be told how to conduct their practice.
   In an effort to improve his abilities, Alpert took part in a
seminar offered by Miles at West Penn earlier this year. The
four-hour program has been presented this year at two dozen
hospitals, medical schools and health maintenance organizations
around the country.
   Vaughn Keller, who led the Pittsburgh session, told doctors part
of the problem stems from differences in background.
   Physicians are trained to rely on a rigorous decision-making
process in making a diagnosis, Keller said. Patients, on the other
hand, rarely get right to the point with physicians, said J.
Gregory Carroll, a corporate training specialist at Miles, a West
Haven, Conn., company.
   ``A patient may start by telling a story about lower back pain
and may be warming up to something they're not ready to talk
about,'' Carroll said. ``The patient may wait 'til the end of the
interview, when he has his hand on the doorknob, to say, `Oh, by
the way, doctor, should I be worried about this swelling. ...'''
   Doctors need to be able to recognize when a patient is hedging
and should try to draw out relevant ``pieces of the clinical
puzzle,'' he said.
   ``It's not just an educational gap. It's really two different
world views,'' Keller said.
   Terminology can be a problem, too.
   eller urged seminar participants to encourage their patients to
be more open about medical problems and said doctors should give
specific instructions for medication, exercise, therapy and other
treatment.
   The extra effort Keller and Carroll prescribe can have benefits
for doctors. Several attorneys said better relations can reduce a
physician's chance of being sued for malpractice.
   ``The doctors who don't get sued are the ones who take the time
to explain, `This could happen or this could happen' and give their
patients what we call informed consent,'' said Beachler.
   ``Without exaggeration, in half if not three-quarters of these
cases, one of the complaints these people have is they don't like
the way they were treated.''
   A typical patient's hospital stay might involve seeing four or
five doctors. ``Sometimes, you feel like you're on a conveyor
belt,'' said Pittsburgh attorney John C. Conti, who represents
physicians.
   In the last decade, many medical schools added courses designed
to teach students how to conduct efficient discussions with
patients.
   ``It's one of those things that people used to say, `Well, you
pick it up,'' said Dr. Stanley K. Dorst, who teaches a required
course, introduction to patient care, at the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine.
   Dorst disagrees that communication is ``part of the art of
medicine'' and can't be taught. ``It's a skill and you need to
practice it.''

<TEXT>
   French physicist Goery Delacote has been
named director of the Exploratorium, the city's innovative science
museum.
   Delacote, 51, leader of the scientific research team that
created La Villette, the French government's new sciece and
technology museum in Paris, will join the museum in January.
   He said he hopes to expand the museum in the Palace of Fine Arts
into a major international center to help foster understanding of
nature and art and appreciation of scientific discovery.
   The Exploratorium was founded in 1969 by the late Frank
Oppenheimer, with whom Delacote formed a close friendship.
Oppenheimer's creative exhibit builders designed 50 interactive
displays at La Villette.
   ``Now is a good time for a Frenchman to pay back some of what
Frank Oppenheimer gave to my country,'' Delacote said.
   Robert L. White, a Stanford engineer, resigned in December and

<HEAD>Seven Panthers Die, Captive Breeding Pushed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The deaths of seven endangered Florida
panthers this year have wildlife officials pushing for a captive
breeding program by early next year.
   Three of the seven were killed in fights with other panthers,
two died of infections and one was killed crossing a road. One
cause of death hasn't been determined.
   Two deaths were particularly critical because the cats had
``founder'' genetic material, meaning they had some of the purest
genetic material available and haven't been subjected to
inbreeding, said Dennis Jordan, Florida panther coordinator for the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Gainesville.
   ``In terms of the goal of the program, to protect existing
genetic material, we've lost some,'' Jordan said.
   Under the program, about half the existing Florida panthers
would be captured for breeding programs at zoos and private
preserves. That, some biologists say, could prevent the extinction
of the cats. No more than 50 panthers are believed to exist, most
of them in southwest Florida.
   Biolgists had hoped to begin capturing panthers last spring, but
began reassessing the program after environmentalists complained
that wildlife agencies were rushing into the project without proper
studies.

<HEAD>Genentech President's Wife Settles SEC Action</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wife of Genentech Inc.'s president has
settled insider trading allegations that she tipped her brother
about confidential merger talks the company was holding with Roche
Holding Ltd.
   According to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mollie E.
Raab did not trade for herself, but her brother told a friend who
allegedly made some $127,400 in illegal profits.
   Genetech completed a merger with Roche in September.
   Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, Mrs. Raab, of
Hillsborough, Calif., agreed to pay $162,400 in penalties and
interest to settle a civil action filed by the Securities and
Exchange Commission at federal court in San Francisco on Tuesday.
   Neither Genentech, nor Mrs. Raab's husband, G. Kirk Raab, chief
executive officer of the San Francisco-based pharmaceutical and
biotechnology company, were accused of any wrongdoing.
   ``Mrs. Raab did not profit on the stock trades,'' Raab said in a
statement issued by Genentech. ``She knows it was wrong to have
told her brother, who was having prolonged financial difficulty,
and she accepts her penalty. We are both sorry for any
embarrassment this incident has caused to Genentech and its
employees,'' the statement concluded.
   Also settling with the SEC were Mrs. Raab's brother, Michael
Gaylord Painter, and one of his friends, Joseph Jeffries, both of
San Antonio, Texas.
   Some of the circumstances in the case resemble the controversial
insider trading case against broker Robert Chestman in New York.
   A federal appeals court overturned Chestman's conviction earlier
this year on the grounds there was insufficent evidence Chestman
knew information he got from a family member of the Waldbaum
supermarket chain owners about a pending merger with A&amp;P was
confidential.
   The government is appealing that court decision.
   ``Though the issues framed for litigation would have been
interesting, Mr. Painter was not required to disgorge any money or
to pay any penalty, and under the circumstances he decided to
dispose of the matter rather than engage in costly litigation,''
said his lawyer, Washington attorney Richard Morvillo.
   But Harry Weiss, an associate director of the SEC's Enforcement
Division, said the misappropriation theory used in the Raab case
``is not an issue in the Chestman appeal.''
   In the Chestman case, said Weiss, the issue is the proof the
government must offer to establish whether a person getting a
confidential stock tip knows the tipster is illegally violating a
trust or duty.
   In the Raab case ``we're alleging sufficient evidence to
establish the exisitence of a relationship and a breach of that
relationship,'' said Weiss.
   Mrs. Raab ``is not an officer of the company but she has a
relationship of trust and confidence with her husband, the breach
of that duty is the misappropriation (with which she was
charged).''
   Weiss noted that in any event, the defendants settled without
going to trial.
   The SEC alleged that Jeffries made about $127,400 in illegal
trading profits using the information Painter got from his sister
with the understanding that the two men would split it, although
lawyers declined to say whether Painter actually ever took
possession of any of the profits.
   The SEC also alleged that Jeffries also told other people who
made an additional $70,000 in trading profits.
   They were not accused of insider trading because there wasn't
enough evidence to conclude they knew the information had been
stolen, said Weiss.
   As part of the settlement, however, Jeffries will pay $133,700
in illegal profits plus interest. The government waived additional
penalties for him and Painter after they gave sworn statements that
they were unable to pay.
   Although there was no allegation Mrs. Raab, traded illegally for
herself, under the Insider Trading Sanctions Act, however, she
could have been ordered to pay penalties equal to the profits made
by those she tipped.
   The $162,400 she will pay was part of the negotiated settlement,
said Weiss.
   According to the SEC complaint, Mrs. Raab learned about the
merger negotiations from her husband and sometime between Jan. 22
and Feb. 2 she told her brother to buy a few thousand dollars worth
of Genentech stock, saying ``buy now'' even if he had to borrow
money.
   She told her brother ``good things were about to happen to
Genentech,'' and that he should keep his purchase and her comments
confidential, according to the SEC.
   At the time, Genentech stock was trading at about $21 a share.
Painter, in turn, told Jeffries, who bought option contracts to buy
Genentech securities which he agreed to split with Painter. An
option contract is an agreement to buy stock at a later date for a
fixed price. If the price of the stock goes up before the contract
date, the buyer makes the difference in profit.

   Most people in the turkey business love
November. Not Roger Bassett, owner of Bassett's Original Turkey
fast-food restaurants.
   When home-cooked Thanksgiving leftovers make such good
sandwiches at home, ``why would you pay $5 for a sandwich'' at one
of his restaurants? The answer, he said, is they don't.
   Sales usually drop 50 percent for three days following the
holiday.
   But Bassett said he understands.
   ``You have a wonderful dinner at home and you make sandwiches
with the leftovers,'' he said.
   Bassett's Original Turkey has grown from a small oven set up at
a Sundae bar to a nine-restaurant chain in Pennsylvania, New
Jersey, Maryland and Virginia.
   The latest franchise opened to brisk business last week at a
mall in downtown Philadelphia.
   Bassett, 29, stood back and watched the people line up to buy
his cold sandwiches and his hot opened-faced platters.
   ``People like turkey,'' he said. ``People are tired of pizza and
cheesesteaks.''
   Bassett is a fifth-generation member of the century-old
Bassett's Ice Cream Co.
   He originally carried on the family's tradition of selling ice
cream. When he was 19, he opened a small sundae bar in
Philadelphia's Reading Terminal Market.
   His father visited the market on a regular basis, but grew tired
of eating greasy hamburgers and sloppy pizza.
   ``So he asked me if I would fix him a turkey sandwich whenever
he came in,'' Bassett said.
   After setting up a small oven at the ice cream stall, Bassett
wandered through the market and bought tomatoes, lettuce, bread and
a turkey.
   ``I cooked a turkey sandwich for him,'' he said. ``Then some guy
saw him eating and asked where he got the sandwich. The next day I
cooked two turkeys. They sold out strictly on word of mouth.''
   He finally gave in and bought the equipment to make turkey
sandwiches on a larger scale.
   The business was an immediate success, he said. Within five
years, he opened up three more stores of his own. In 1989, Bassett
sold his ice cream stand as more malls wanted his turkey in their
food courts. He turned to selling franchises for the next five
stores.
   Bassett will concentrate on the Northeast first, but wants to
sell franchises nationally in five years. ``I've already got offers
in California, Florida, and Canada,'' he said.
   He said his menu is perfect in mall food courts because it
offers an alternative for health-conscious consumers.
   Pat Glickman agreed as he sat down to eat the turkey sandwich he
just bought.
   ``I love turkey,'' said Glickman, 26, of Philadelphia. ``It's
healthier for you than McDonald's or Burger King.''
   Another customer, Jennifer Landis, said she had passed Bassett's
Turkey stores several times without stopping before she gave in and
ordered a platter.
   ``One of my favorite lunches is an open-faced turkey sandwich,''
said Landis, 32, of suburban Jamison. ``I enjoy it. At home I eat
it a lot.''

<HEAD>Treasury Chief Asks Regulators to Soften Lending Policies</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady broke his
public silence on the so-called ``credit crunch'' with a plea to
regulators to soften their crackdown on bank lending.
   ``Be mindful of the effect your behavior can have on the
willingness of banks to take even the reasonable risk of lending to
good credits,'' Brady said Tuesday in remarks directed at the
nation's bank examiners.
   ``We need a banking system that is a taker, not a shedder, of
such risks,'' he said.
   A text of the speech, delivered to the Arthritis Foundation in
New York, was released in Washington. Brady also signaled that the
administration wants the dollar to stop falling.
   His comments on the credit crunch come amid growing concern that
banks' reluctance to lend is holding back an already weak economy.
   President Bush conducted a series of meetings last week,
discussing the economic lull with top advisers, senior regulators
and business executives.
   Bankers and some business owners have complained for nearly a
year that regulators were cracking down too hard in the wake of the
savings and loan debacle.
   Regulators responded that they were simply urging prudence in
response to more fragile economic conditions, particularly in the
commercial real estate industry.
   Brady conceded that ``traditional lending standards applied by
many banks clearly eroded'' during the long economic expansion of
the 1980s.
   But, he cautioned, ``To the regulators, I'd like to say publicly
what I've said privately many times: use some judgment. Apply some
balance. Don't use unrealistically negative scenarios in evaluating
loans. Don't overreact.''
   A Federal Reserve survey of lending officers released Monday
found that bankers were becoming increasingly cautious about making
loans, not only to commercial real estate developers, but also to
large corporations and home buyers, two types of borrowers
generally considered safe.
   ``Let me offer a word to banks,'' Brady said. ``I urge you to
keep lending to your good customers. ... Let's not overreact to the
economy or to the regulators.
   ``Your franchise depends upon your continued willingness to
stand by your customers. I urge you not to walk away from those
whose trust you have worked so hard to earn.''
   Some banks have come under pressure to cut back lending by the
need to meet stricter capital standards taking effect in January
under an international agreement. But Brady said banks had
alternatives, including cutting costs, reducing dividends or
seeking a merger partner.
   Brady also sought to calm fears about the condition of the
banking industry, saying, ``The banks of 1990 are not the S&amp;Ls of
the 1980s. They are as different as chalk and cheese.''
   He said banks have a capital cushion of $200 billion to absorb
losses, 6 percent of their assets, compared with $10 billion for
S&amp;Ls in 1987, or 1 percent of their assets.
   Regarding the dollar, Brady said the deficit reductions in the
1991 budget adopted by Congress last month ``should promote renewed
and welcome stability in exchange markets.'' And, he said,
``policies that promote stability in the dollar exchange rate are a
plus, not just for the United States, but for the world economy at
large.''
   Until Tuesday's speech, Treasury officials have expressed little
concern about the dollar, which has been declining for most of the
year and is trading near post-World War II lows against the German
mark. It also has fallen sharply against the Japanese yen.
   A weak dollar worsens inflation in the United States by driving
up the cost of imports, but it improves the U.S. trade performance
by making American goods cheaper on overseas markets.

<HEAD>Senior Ranks Shuffled At Honeywell</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honeywell Inc. has streamlined its top
management by reducing to three from six the number of top
executives who report to chief executive James Renier and form the
company's top policy-making committee.
   The changes had been in the works for several months,
spokeswoman Susan Eich said Tuesday.
   The three, who were named to the company's board of directors,
are:
   -Christopher J. Steffen, 48, executive vice president and chief
financial and administrative officer. Steffen has been credited
with masterminding much of the successful restructuring at
Honeywell in the past year and a half - selling assets, spinning
off defense operations, buying back shares and cutting costs.
   -D. Larry Moore, 54, executive vice president and chief
operating officer for space and aviation operations and for
industrial automation businesses. Moore has been the head of space
and aviation, the company's fastest growing business.
   -Michael R. Bonsignore, 49, executive vice president and chief
operating officer responsible for international operations and for
the homes and buildings business. Bonsignore has been the head of
international operations, where much of the firm's growth has come
in recent years.
   The move gives broader duties to the three executives, who will
control Honeywell operations and report to Renier. Earlier this
year as many as six executives filled those roles.
   Honeywell is a global controls company that provides products,
systems and services for homes and buildings, industry, and
aviation and space. The company had 1989 sales of $6.1 billion.

<HEAD>Newspaper Closes After 69 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Lisbon evening newspaper Diario de
Lisboa will close at the end of November after 69 years of
publication, the editor said Wednesday.
   The daily is the latest victim of a Portuguese press crisis that
has seen eight major daily and weekly papers close in the past two
years.
   Chief Editor Antonio Ruella Ramos said Wednesday the last issue
of Diario de Lisboa will hit the streets Nov. 30, after
negotiations with the Projornal media group failed to find a
formula to save the paper.
   The center-left tabloid was reportedly loosing 18 million
escudos, or $138,000, a month and circulation had fallen to 10,000
from almost 30,000 in 1987.
   Ruella Ramos blamed the closure on a contraction of the
Portuguese advertising market, a lack of state funding and a change
in reading habits away from afternoon papers.
   In the 1960s, the Diario de Lisboa was one of the few papers to
challenge the strict censorship imposed by rightist dictator
Antonio Oliveira Salazar.
   After a 1974 revolution restored Portuguese democracy many
leading journalists of the newly-freed press came from Diario
Lisboa.
  The Portuguese press boomed at the end of the 1980s. But the
market was unable to sustain the increasing number of titles in
this country where almost 20 percent of the 10.3 population is
illiterate.
   The center-right government is hoping to boost the press by
privatizing state-owned papers.
   Several titles have been sold and the last remaining state-owned
paper, the prestigious Diario de Noticias, is scheduled for
privatization early next year.

<HEAD>Union Wants Right To Match Offers for Steel Division</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If USX Corp. decides to sell off its steel
business, the United Steelworkers union wants the right to match
any offer the company receives.
   The union asked during contract negotiations for the right to
equal any bid made by potential suitors. The union represents
18,000 USX employees.
   The union's chief negotiator, Andrew V. ``Lefty'' Palm, said
Tuesday the USW wants to know more about the company's long-range
plans for its steel business.
   ``Are they going to keep it in one piece? Chop it up? Spin it
off?'' Palm asked. ``We're concerned about speculators coming in
... who could care less about our jobs, our community.''
   Financier Carl C. Icahn has pressured USX to sever its cyclical
steel business from its more profitable energy unit, which accounts
for about 70 percent of the company's revenue and operating income.
Icahn, USX's largest stockholder, thinks his 33.9 million shares
would be worth a lot more if the steel business were shed.
   Last week, Icahn threatened to nominate his own slate of
directors at USX's annual meeting in May unless the company quickly
moves to restructure its steel business. Options include selling
the steel division, in whole or individual plants, or spinning it
off into a separate company and selling all or part of the stock.
   USX announced three weeks ago that its board had authorized the
conversion of the steel unit into a wholly owned subsidiary.
Chairman Charles A. Corry said the move gives USX ``the flexibility
for any steel restructuring.''
   Palm said the union's request to match offers for the steel
division must be dealt with before there can be agreement on a
contract to replace the one that expires Feb. 1. No date is set for
resuming the talks, which broke off after the two sides failed to
meet a self-imposed deadline on Nov. 10.
   The union said it would swing the deal through an employee stock
ownership plan, a buyout technique that gained favor in the 1980s,
particularly in the steel industry.
   Weirton Steel Corp. was created in 1984 when the West Virginia
steel maker's 7,700 employees bought the company from National
Steel for $386 million. Other employee-led buyouts in the industry
include Northwestern Steel and Wire of Sterling, Ill., Republic
Engineered Steels of Massillon, Ohio, and Pittsburgh Forgings.
   USX spokesman Thomas Ferrall declined to comment on the union's
request to match any offer for the steel unit, but many analysts
believe USX would balk at such a deal. However, several said the
success of other steel employee stock ownership plans, pressure
from Icahn, the softening steel market and other factors might
force USX to accede to an employee buyout.

<TEXT>
   Honda of America Manufacturing Inc. is handing
out average profit-sharing checks of $1,712 for each of its hourly
and salaried workers.
   The Big Three U.S. automakers, meanwhile, forecast no such check
for their workers.
   About 9,400 workers at Honda's assembly and component factories
in Marysville, East Liberty and Anna, Ohio, last week received the
payments based on profits for the 1990 fiscal year, company
spokesman Jeff Leestma said Wednesday.
   The payments are based on a formula computed from a variety of
figures, including worldwide pre-tax income and the size of the
work force.
   The Big Three automakers, which reported a combined $2.1 billion
loss for the third quarter of this year, have said profit-sharing
checks for their 650,000 or so eligible employees are in doubt.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. compute
their profit sharing checks on profitability of the companies'
North American operations for a calendar year. When profits allow,
profit-sharing checks are delivered in the spring.
   Last year, Ford workers got an average of about $1,025 each, GM
employees got an average of $50 and Chrysler workers got none. The
largest profit-sharing checks were handed out by Ford in 1988 when
the average eligible employee got $3,700.

<TEXT>
   When James W. Arnett flunked out of
college and went to work as a Shoney's Inc. cook flipping burgers
and stirring soup, the thought of running the company was the last
thing on his mind.
   But in his 20-year career at Shoney's, Arnett has gradually
moved from the frying pan of a kitchen into the fire of a
big-business boardroom, making decisions that affect 28,000
employees in a network of restaurants and hotels in 30 states.
   ``I guess it's easier to teach somebody when you know how to do
it yourself,'' said Arnett, 41. ``I said awhile back that I'd still
like to be a teacher. Somebody pointed out that's what I do
today.''
   Arnett's elevation to president and chief operating officer of
Shoney's, announced last month, is unusual in an era when companies
usually fill top executive positions with number-crunching MBAs.
   Many executives don't necessarily have experience on the
assembly line, shop floor or in this case, the kitchen, where
Arnett began toiling in 1970 for a minimum wage.
   ``I worked hard,'' Arnett said in a recent intervew in his
office at Shoney's Nashville headquarters. ``I took out the trash,
swept, mopped, whatever it took.''
   Arnett said his self-imposed discipline stems from flunking
school and anxiety over becoming a loser in life.
   He was living with his parents when his casual attitude about
studying and grades resulted in a near-zero grade point average at
Tennessee Tech in Cookeville, a 90-minute drive east of Nashville.
   ``I think I made a C in something,'' he said.
   Arnett's father, a retired Marine Corps sergeant major, demanded
repayment of $1,400 in tuition money and ordered his son to get a
job. He found one at Shoney's, a growing chain of restaurants known
for its Big Boy burgers and for pioneering the family style
``breakfast bar'' buffet.
   ``There's no doubt in my mind that fear of failure is what keeps
Jim Arnett motivated,'' Arnett said. His father, he said,
``literally picked me up and carried me to work every day.''
   Arnett gave most of the earnings from his 80-hour week to his
father, eventually repaying the $1,400. At the same time, Arnett
said, he discovered something he could do well.
   He soon became kitchen manager, then store manager before
working his way up into the higher levels of the company.
   Shoney's has since grown into a large publicly held company that
owns and operates 1,600 restaurants and motels including Shoney's
Restaurants, Shoney's Inns, Captain D's fast-seafood chain, Lee's
Famous Recipe Chicken, Fifth Quarter and Pargo's restaurants.
   Six feet tall and slightly overweight ``due to sampling our
foods all the time,'' Arnett says he enjoyed his early cooking
career and still makes occasional forays into a company kitchen.
Just a few weeks ago, for example, he did a stint at a Captain D's
to assess its efficiency.
   ``The reason is sometimes you have a tendency to overcomplicate
things,'' Arnett said. ``You have to keep it simple to put the food
out in a reasonable amount of time.''
   Arnett's appointment has been widely praised among securities
analysts who follow Shoney's, which is under pressure from a large
debt load and must seek ways to economize and become more
efficient. Arnett's experience in everything from menu planning to
mixing vegetable soup gives him an advantage.
   ``In our opinion, that was the correct move for the company,''
said John Lawrence, of Morgan Keegan &amp; Co. in Memphis.
   As the No. 2 executive, Arnett is heir-apparent to Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Leonard H. Roberts.
   Shoney's founder Ray Danner, who retired as chairman but is
still on the company's board and executive committee, said Arnett
``was a good kid. And now he's a great man.''
   ``I would say he has all the ingredients to maybe one day be a
CEO of the company. In my opinion, he certainly has the
qualities,'' Danner said.
   Arnett credits his success to simple hard work.
   ``I still consider myself an employee. I'll go around pouring
coffee,'' he said.
   ``If you don't go to the stores, you're making your decisions in
a void. It's easy not to go to the stores. It would be easy to have
a fancy office.''
   Arnett's office is not fancy. It has a desk, work area, five
chairs and no paintings on the walls.
   Instead, a wall near his desk holds framed copies of the goals
of Shoney's divisions, along with a statement of the company's
business philosophy.
   ``Our philosophy is you can't run a business from an office,''
he said.
   Arnett declined to disclose his salary, though he said it was
close to the compensation of predecessor Gary Spoleta, who
according to the company's latest proxy statement earned $388,202
in fiscal 1989. That's a far cry from the $1.25 an hour Arnett
pulled in 20 years ago.
   ``Let me put it this way,'' Arnett said. ``I owe more money now
than I did then.''
   The company plans to more than double its operations to 3,400
motels and restaurants - mostly Shoney's family style restaurants
and the Captain D's and Lee's chicken fast food outlets - by 1995.
   Despite signs of a economic sluggishness that is huring many
restaurant companies, Shoney's still anticipates a big jump in
sales this year from the $860 million it earned a year ago.
   ``I'm positive. Other leaders will say their sales will by down
4.2 percent this year,'' Arnett said. ``And they'll hit their
goals. We're looking for $1 billion.''

<HEAD>Big Accounting Firm Files For Bankruptcy Court Protection</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 2 grafs to UPDATE with bankruptcy case filed. Picks

<TEXT>
   Laventhol &amp; Horwath, the nation's
seventh-largest accounting firm, filed for bankruptcy protection
today under the weight of lawsuits seeking damages for allegedly
faulty audits.
   The firm filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy case in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in New York, said Jaimie Walthour, a clerk in the court.
Under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code, a company seeks to
reorganize its operations while it remains in business.
   ``A series of tragic circumstances brought this proud firm to
this sad day,'' Robert Levine, the firm's executive partner and
chief executive officer, said Tuesday.
   Levine blamed the collapse on high litigation costs and the
increasing number of lawsuits being filed against accounting firms.
The lawsuits were filed primarily by businesses challenging audits
or by shareholders contending they received faulty financial
information.
   The company reportedly had to pay nine creditor banks at least
$30 million last year, of which only $18.5 million was covered by
insurance, over its auditing of the Grabill Corp. of Chicago.
   Laventhol's audits of Jim Bakker's PTL ministry are the subject
of an ongoing trial in Charlotte, N.C.
   ``Most accounting firms are suffering from high litigation costs
and our firm is no exception,'' Levine said on Tuesday. ``Because
of the raised expectations of plaintiffs and the popular
misconception of auditors as all-seeing and all-knowing, the number
of lawsuits against accounting firms has skyrocketed.''
   The firm had 4,200 employees - 360 of which were partners in the
firm - in its 50 offices across the country. Laventhol reported
$350 million in domestic revenue last year.
   Response in the firm's offices nationwide was diverse.
   ``We will close,'' said Nick Iacuzio, department head of
accounting and auditing for the firm's Boston office, which let its
160 workers go. ``It's very devastating, there's a lot of sadness
and grief.''
   Offices in Ohio, Connecticut and Philadelphia also folded, but
partners and senior executives in the Kansas City, Mo., office say
they plan to open a firm of their own. Stanley H. House, managing
partner in Kansas City, said the new firm will be known as House,
Park, Morriss &amp; Co.
   In Tampa, Fla., two Laventhol partners have already set up their
own firm, Aidman, Piser, and Co.
   ``It's certainly very hectic right now, but we've gotten
enthusiastic support from our clients,'' said Philip C. Piser who
is setting up the new firm with Terry Aidman. They had previously
headed Laventhol's audit and tax practice departments in Tampa.
   The firm's 360 partners could remain liable for debts created by
the national firm, said Leslie D. Corwin, an attorney and partner
in the New York City-based law firm, Morrison, Cohen, Singer &amp;
Weinstein.
   Once assets are sold off, whatever liabilities are left after
the firm's insurance pays off becomes the responsibility of the
individual partners, Corwin said.
   Two of the Laventhol's largest clients praised the accounting
firm's work even while they scrambled to find new accountants.
   Ed Ashburn, accounting controller for Trans World Airlines Inc.
in suburban New York, said Laventhol handled the airline's audits
for the past four years.
   ``If they are unable to perform the audit work, we should not
have any difficulty in awarding the contract to another firm,'' he
said, adding that TWA has received several offers from other
accounting firms.
   Chicago-based Hyatt Corp. had worked with Laventhol for 15
years, said Hyatt spokeswoman Karen Rugen, but is now reviewing
other firms to do its year-end audits.

<HEAD>Once-Thriving Puerto Rico Tuna Industry in Deep Trouble</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAIME PIERAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Puerto Rico's tuna canning
industry, which accounts for more than half of U.S. tuna
processing, is struggling to stay afloat in a sea of Far East
competition and efforts to save dolphins.
   This year, two of the island's five tuna canneries closed and a
third reduced operations, putting about 2,000 people out of work.
   Puerto Rico is the center of the U.S. tuna packing industry, a
$634 million-a-year business that at its height employed 8,000
people. Last year, 535,069 tons of tuna were processed in the
United States - more than half of it in Puerto Rico, according to
the U.S. Department of Commerce.
   Most of the tuna canned here comes from the eastern Pacific
Ocean, where dolphin and tuna swim together. Dolphins are
air-breathing mammals that drown when captured in nets along with
tuna.
   In April, the three largest tuna canners in the world -
Starkist, Bumble Bee and Chicken of the Sea - responded to an
international outcry and said they would stop buying and selling
tuna caught with dolphins.
   That led tuna fishing boats to move to the western Pacific and
Indian Ocean, where tuna and dolphins swin separately, according to
industry spokesmen.
   Companies say the expense of transporting tuna from those
regions to Puerto Rico is too high to meet the competition. Also
attracted by cheaper labor in the Far East, companies are
relocating.
   In late July, Bumble Bee's plant in the Puerto Rican city of
Mayaguez laid off 800 employees and said it was transferring part
of its operation to Santa Fe Springs, Calif., and Thailand.
   ``This industry is labor-intensive. It will go where the rates
are more beneficial,'' said Bumble Bee plant manager Pat Vella in
an interview.
   In July, Van Camp, which cans Chicken of the Sea tuna, closed
its plant in the southern Puerto Rican port city of Ponce and said
it was moving operations to Indonesia and American Samoa. Neptune,
the sole tuna cannery of the Japanese conglomerate Mitsui, closed
its Puerto Rican operation in August.
   Puerto Rico is left with just three plants - Star Kist Caribe,
the largest cannery in the world, the Mitsubishi-owned Caribe Tuna,
and a scaled-down Bumble Bee.
   ``The main problem with the tuna industry is costs,'' said Jimmy
Seda, a vice president at Neptune.
   Many fear such plant closings, if they continue, could topple
Puerto Rico's tuna industry and hurt the island's overall economy.
   ``It would be catastrophic,'' said Jorge Orama Monroig, chairman
of the Puerto Rico Senate's Treasury Committee, which is studying
incentives for local tuna canneries. ``If an industry that big
leaves the island, you're also going to have indirect job losses.
In Mayaguez, it's an important part of the economy.''
   In July, Star Kist and Bumble Bee were among the top 25
employers on the island, with Star Kist employing 5,900 workers and
Bumble Bee 2,000.
   Puerto Rico, a U.S. Commonwealth, is subject to many U.S. laws.
The minimum wage here matches the mainland's - $3.85 an hour. In
Thailand, where much of the tuna is now being canned, it is about
$2 to $3 a day.
   Seda said that with added expenses such as health insurance,
workers here cost about $7 an hour.
   ``But it's not just wages,'' he said, adding that environmental
and health regulations are less restrictive in Thailand than in the
United States. ``Our waste water treatment plant alone was costing
about $1 million to operate,'' he said.
   Lured by tax incentives and cheaper labor, the tuna canning
industry expanded in this Caribbean island in the early 1980s when
Star Kist, Bumble Bee and Van Camp closed their Pacific coast
operations in California.
   American companies operating in Puerto Rico enjoy the benefits
of a federal tax code provision that exempts them from paying
federal income tax on profits earned by their Puerto Rican
subsidiaries.
   Commonwealth officials are asking the International Trade
Commission for higher tariffs on tuna imported to the United
States. Under current tariffs, oil-packed tuna is taxed at a rate
of 24 percent, while water-packed tuna, preferred by consumers, is
taxed at 12.5 percent.
   ``If the United States does not review its import tariff policy,
the whole industry here is going to be in trouble,'' said Seda, the
Neptune vice president.
   Raul Velez, president of the Tuna Employees Association, is
doubtful the lobbying will be effective because it faces opposition
from the large tuna canneries themselves. Asian owners control the
major tuna processors except Star Kist, so higher import tariffs
are not in their interest, he said.

<HEAD>Shadow SEC Second-Guesses Federal Market Regulator</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of the
Securities and Exchange Commission? The Shadow SEC thinks it does.
   The self-appointed panel of five - mostly free-market economists
- intends to shadow and second-guess the real SEC, a presidentially
appointed panel entrusted with keeping the stock markets fair and
honest.
   The real SEC, an independent panel of five commissioners backed
up by a staff of lawyers, accountants and economists, not only
oversees the trading of stocks and bonds but oversees mutual funds
and investment advisers - affecting the jobs, investments and
futures of millions of Americans.
   At its first meeting in a swank Washington hotel, the Shadow SEC
debated the real SEC's policies on two hot issues: the effect of
program trading on stock market plunges and the voting rights of
shareholders in takeover battles.
   The Shadow SEC voted for the elimination of a rule - approved
this year by the real SEC - limiting index arbitrage, a form of
program trading, on the New York Stock Exchange when the market
rises or drops 50 points. The panel also called on the real SEC to
revise rules governing shareholders' absentee ballots or proxies.
   Critics have called the body irrelevent or presumptious. Even
those who think there is a place for a Shadow SEC think its role
will be minor.
   Samuel Hayes, investment banking professor at Harvard
University's business school, thinks the concept of economic
criticism ``is an excellent idea. I just don't take too seriously
the establishment of a regulator in exile.''
   ``Frankly, I don't understand why some people are so upset about
a Shadow SEC,'' said SEC Commissioner Philip R. Lochner. ``There
are 1,000 conferences a year around the country on securities
matters and this is one of them,'' he added.
   That's precisely the attitude the Shadow SEC, which includes
1990 Nobel Prize-winning economist Merton H. Miller and former SEC
Commissioner Charles C. Cox, wants to change.
   Gregg Jarrell, a finance and economics professor at the
University of Rochester and one of the shadow body's creators told
reporters at the first meeting earlier this month: ``One of the big
purposes of this is to spur greater progress in research among the
academic community'' to create ``one more outlet besides the normal
run of academic conferences. One that's a little different, perhaps
a little more exciting.''
   ``I don't know whether we'll reach the SEC itself,'' said
Miller, who teaches at the University of Chicago. ``I think we
will, but by a very indirect route.''
   The SEC as an institution has no official position on its shadow
self. Even Richard C. Breeden, the usually outspoken SEC chairman,
declined to comment on the matter.
   But sources inside the commission say more than a few SEC
feathers have been ruffled by the interlopers.
   Following its first meeting, SEC General Counsel James Doty
needled the Shadow SEC in a speech to securities lawyers saying he
was worried: ``Do they have a shadow general counsel, too?''
   In an interview, Doty, said his speech was ``clearly facetious
but it had a serious point'' about the importance of the private
securities bar's input.
   ``There is room for all disciplines to comment on the law and
the rules but I don't think economists can infer they have a
superior vantage point, any more than lawyers can,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, the Securities Industry Association ``is totally
against a Shadow SEC and believes it will be disruptive,'' said Art
Samansky, a spokesman for the New York-based trade association.
   The Shadow SEC, sponsored by the University of Rochester's Simon
Graduate School of Business Administration, is financed by the John
M. Olin Foundation, IBM Corp., Twenty-First Securities Corp. and
Mesa Limited Partnership, the firm of takeover strategist T. Boone
Pickens.
   ``They're good people with basically a conservative economic
viewpoint, trying to make sure everybody involved pays enough
attention to economic theories in the regulation of the stock
market,'' said prominent Washington securities lawyer Arthur
Mathews. ``(But) I don't perceive it as a group that's going to
have any power or particular influence.''
   If the first Shadow SEC meeting had been a movie, it could have
been called: ``The Revenge of the Economists.'' Panelists, noting
that the five current SEC members are all lawyers, complained that
statistical studies had been downplayed or ignored in the SEC
rule-making process.
   In addition to Jarrell, Cox and Miller, who teaches at the
University of Chicago, the Shadow SEC consists of Ronald J. Gilson,
a law professor at Stanford University and Hans R. Stoll, a finance
professor at Vanderbilt University.
   Steven Manaster, former chief economist for the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, now teaching at the University of Utah,
heads the Shadow SEC staff.
   ``That's one hell of a line up,'' concluded Edward H.
Fleischman, the only member of the real SEC to attend part of the
shadow session.
   The reams of raw data presented was ``fascinating,'' he said
adding: ``I think its very healthy for an organization, especially
a so-called fourth branch of government agency, to be publicly to
account - in a constructive way.''
   Lochner, who did not attend the session but sent an observer,
said ``economists have something to teach lawyers, but I think its
kind of a foolish notion that we should wait until all the data is
in, because all of the data is never in. You've got to make
decisions with what's available at the time.''

   Grain and soybean futures prices stabilized this
morning on the Chicago Board of Trade after Tuesday's sharp
declines.
   The market is closely watching Persian Gulf developments and the
interplay between President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   The theory is that the closer Gorbachev is to Bush's thinking,
the more likely food aid or export credits becomes for the Soviets.
   On Tuesday, apparently seeking to dispel doubts about the
Soviets' resolve on using military action, Gorbachev said the U.N.
Security Council should address the situation in the Persian Gulf.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to \ cent lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $2.45\ a bushel; corn was {

were \ cent lower to } cent higher with December at $1.08 a bushel;
and soybeans were 1 cent to 2{ cents higher with January at $5.70{
a bushel.
   At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange livestock futures were mostly
higher while pork bellies were mostly lower.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .18 cent higher with the December
contract at 79.25 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower
to .07 cent higher with January at 87.67 cents a pound; live hogs
were .25 cent lower to .23 cent higher with December at 53.30 cents
a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .30 cent lower to 1.10 cents
higher with February at 70.15 cents a pound.
   On Tuesday, livestock and meat futures were lower.

<TEXT>
   Michael Milken climbed quietly to the
mountaintop of American finance. His descent was much louder.
   Born and raised in California, Milken was a math whiz helping
his father's accounting business by age 10. He studied arcane
business tracts while others marched for civil rights and peace
during the 1960s. In his early years on Wall Street, Milken
digested financial documents during a two-hour commute.
   With the same passion, Milken avoided the limelight after
gaining market prowess, shunning interviews and refusing to pose
alone for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s annual report.
   Milken became a familiar figure only after named by speculator
Ivan Boesky in the government's fraud investigation in late 1986.
The most prominent financier in the securities industry in the
booming 1980s, Milken became prosecutors' main target.
   His quirky personality and stupefying wealth have contributed to
widely divergent public views of the 44-year-old financier.
   On the one hand, he is considered a financial genius, economic
visionary and generous philanthropist who has enabled many
businesses to prosper through his masterful selling of high-risk,
high-yield ``junk bonds.''
   On the other hand, Milken is an admitted felon whom some equate
with the excesses of the takeo Iraq from Kuwait were ``on track.'' In addition
to
Bush's personal diplomacy, Secretary of State James A. Baker III
met for several hours with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze to discuss the Persian Gulf conflict.
   The president, who has sought a tougher international stand
against Iraq's Saddam Hussein, told reporters that ``I leave Paris
feeling that we are still together as countries who want to see
this situation reversed and want to see this man unilaterally get
out of Kuwait.''
   The president talked to reporters twice within two hours, once
during a meeting with Greek Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis
and again at the U.S. Embassy in Paris, where he spoke to
officials. Both times, he sought to minimize any differences with
the Soviets over a United Nations resolution authorizing force in
the Persian Gulf.
   ``I'm encouraged, very encouraged about this holding together of
a coalition in the sands and on the seas of the gulf,'' he said.
   Bush said he believes the United States is ``in good
synchronization'' with other nations on how to cope with the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   Asked whether he had set a deadline for Saddam to get out of
Kuwait, he replied, ``Just watch the way all this develops.
Everybody is convinced they must get out of Kuwait with no
concessions, and that's what's emerging here.''
   Asked if he was concerned about the risks of going into a
potential combat zone, he replied, ``It really doesn't enter my
mind at all. It is not a risky mission in my view. I'd tell you if
I felt any tremors. I don't''
   Bush spent three days in Paris for the 34-nation Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe, dealing with the future of
Europe in the post-Cold War era.
   The Soviets did not rule out Bush's proposal for a U.N.
resolution, but instead counseled patience.
   Gorbachev, interviewed on French television, said, ``All
political leaders strive to avoid a military solution, but we
cannot tolerate Saddam Hussein and his regime bringing the world
community to its knees.''
   He said the U.N. Security Council ``will make an analysis of the
situation and will reach a well-considered solution.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater refused to confirm a
report that one resolution being discussed would call for automatic
military action if Saddam did not withdraw within a few months.
``There are any number of approaches that are being considered. We
will not comment on any one of them,'' he said.
   Resolutions already approved by the Security Council impose an
economic boycott on Iraq and occupied Kuwait, call for Iraq's
unconditional withdrawal and insist upon restoration of Kuwait's
previous government.
   Even before one trip was over, Bush was planning a second. The
White House said he would visit Greece and Turkey early next year.
Meanwhile, U.S. and Soviet officials unveiled plans for a
superpower summit in Moscow early next year to sign a treaty on
reducing long-range nuclear weapons.
   Fitzwater said there was no firm date for the summit, although
he said both countries were aiming for January. He said having a
nuclear arms treaty to sign was a prerequisite for the summit, but
holding the session in January ``is what we have been talking about
and shooting for.''

   The brokerage Stuart James &amp; Co. apparently will
cease stock trading after Friday, turning over at least eight of
its 23 retail branch offices nationwide to Chatfield Dean &amp; Co.
   Chatfield Dean president Sandy Greenberg said Tuesday that the
deal should be finished by Friday, and he hopes to have the leases
for the branch offices on Monday.
   The Chatfield Dean agreement follows a National Association of
Securities Dealers' order this month directing Stuart James to
contract with an independent company to clear its cash and
securities transactions for 100,000 customer accounts.
   Greenberg said his brokerage has contracted with an undisclosed
New York clearinghouse.
   His seven-year-old company will absorb 150 to 250 of Stuart
James' 800 brokers, he said. Chatfield Dean now employs 80 brokers,
and another 15 are in training. Chatfield Dean is based in
Englewood, a suburb of Denver.
   Greenberg said Chatfield Dean will not sell penny stocks, but
will continue to concentrate on over-the-counter and mutual funds.
Chatfield Dean has a ``much more conservative product mix'' than
Stuart James, he said.
   C. James Padgett, Stuart James president, could not be reached
by telephone for comment.
   But he was quoted in Wednesday's edition of the Wall Street
Journal as saying the firm would no longer sell and trade stock as
of Monday.
   The story said he blamed the slumping stock market but also said
he sees no future in the penny-stock business. Stuart James was a
leader in the sale of penny stocks, which get their name from their
low prices and are traded over-the-counter.

   Westinghouse Electric Corp. plans to

   Westinghouse spokeswoman Mimi Limbach said most of the

   ``We don't have a number to announce at this point,'' she said.
   The division employs 9,400 people, including 6,500 in western
Pennsylvania. Last month, Westinghouse began offering retirement
incentives for workers 57 and older, including a year's salary for
those who terminated work by the end of the year.
   The division, which is based in suburban Pittsburgh, supplies

facilities.
   Westinghouse does not itemize the sales or operating profits for
the division in the company's financial results. The company said a

<TEXT>
   British Steel PLC said Wednesday it has agreed to
buy the 90.4 percent of Tuscaloosa Steel Corp. it doesn't already
own from the Alabama-based company's other shareholders.
   British Steel refused to disclose the price.
   Tuscaloosa, a producer of plate and hot-strip steel, was formed
in 1984 as a joint venture between British Steel, Tippins
International, O'Neal Steel and American Cast Iron Pipe Co.
   British Steel is the main supplier of semi-finished steel slabs

   Federal regulators' liquidation of tiny Freedom
National Bank earlier this month has prompted a wave of protest
from state and federal officials against what they call the
government's double standard for insolvent institutions.
   In closing the bank, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. was
unable to come up with a buyer. The FDIC's $100,000 limit on
guaranteed deposits caused painful losses to many charities that
invested money at the bank, one of two black-owned banks in New
York.
   But critics assert the episode illustrates a federal policy that
favors the giants and squeezes the meek. They say the FDIC has been
much more accommodating to larger busted banks.
   This week, Rep. Henry Gonzalez, Texas Democrat and chairman of
the House Banking Committee, and Rep. Charles Rangel of New York
fired off separate letters to FDIC Chairman William Seidman asking
for a full explanation of the circumstances surrounding Freedom's
liquidation.
   New York state Attorney General Robert Abrams also wrote to
Seidman asking him to reimburse charitable organizations with
accounts in Freedom.
   Critics say that federal regulators, in their handling of
hundreds of troubled institutions these past two years, have
pursued an unwritten ``Too Big To Fail'' doctrine. Regulators,
critics say, will go all out to save large banks to prevent
repercussions from rippling through the financial community.
   Freedom's lack of political and economic clout, they say, made
it a candidate for a less common option - Too Small To Rescue.
   ``Freedom's largest depositors stand to take substantial losses
as a result of this kind of two-tiered policy - one for the larger
banks and one for the smaller banks,'' said Stephen Verdier, senior
legislative council at Independent Bankers Association of America,
a group representing community-based banks.
   Following the Freedom liquidation, several large charitable
groups - which provide programs including foster care, elderly
services and housing assistance to crime victims - stand to lose
hundreds of thousands of dollars in deposits.
   These depositors were under the mistaken impression that as long
as each of their accounts did not exceed the $100,000 limit covered
by federal insurance, their deposits would be covered. But last
Friday the groups learned that the FDIC totaled all their accounts
in applying the $100,000 cap. All told, roughly $11 million in 100
Freedom accounts exceeded the insurance limit, compared to about
$80 million that was covered, according to the FDIC.
   Some of the charities assert that their separate accounts are
actually being held in trust for different depositors, which may
enble the FDIC to apply a separate $100,000 cap to each account.
The FDIC is looking into these claims.
   Accounts of more than $100,000 often make it through a bank
failure. In one recent case more typical of the way the FDIC
handles insolvency, all depositors of the National Bank of
Washington, D.C. - even those with accounts in a branch in the
Bahamas - were able to recover their funds regardless of the size
of their deposits.
   In this instance, the FDIC arranged a sale of the $1.5 billion
bank to Riggs National Bank of Washington, which took over the
failed bank's assets. In the process, the FDIC decided to cover $37
million in the failed bank's Nassau, Bahamas branch.
   The FDIC justified the decision at the time by saying it was
meant to help soothe foreign investors, who account for a large
percentage of deposits in big American banks.
   But the decision was vigorously opposed by small banks, which
are being hit hard by increases in their deposit insurance
premiums.
   ``These larger banks and particularly their foreign depositors
are totally protected, while for small banks in the middle of
depressed areas the FDIC finds it somehow more convenient just to
liquidate them,'' said Verdier.
   The FDIC says that of the 153 troubled banks it handled in 1990,
Freedom was one of only six for which the FDIC could not find
buyers and had to liquidate instead.
   FDIC officials maintain they did all they could to find a buyer
for Freedom, spending four weeks sifting through a list of 55 banks
and investors, including minority banks and investors. ``In most
instances four weeks is more than enough time,'' said FDIC
spokesman David Barr.
   Just after the bank's failure was announced, New York City
business leaders met to raise the $6 million needed to replenish
the bank's depleted capital.
   But the FDIC says it was too late by then to consider the offer,
because the bank had already been shut down, and the group of
investors needed to obtain a bank charter to be considered.
   Critics, however, argue that the federal regulators should have
tried harder to rescue the black-owned bank.
   ``What we are trying to investigate is why in this particular
incidence, they chose a bank that is in an area that has a
tremendous problem keeping any banks at all,'' said Peggy Miller of
the Consumer Federation of America, a group representing
depositors. ``Why suddenly in this particular case did they choose
to get hard-nosed?''

   The stock market declined slightly today in a
sluggish preholiday session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 5.20 to 2,525.00

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of key developments in the prosecution of
former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond chief Michael Milken:
   Nov. 14, 1986 - Stock speculator Ivan Boesky pays $100 million
to settle charges of insider trading on information supplied by
investment banker Dennis Levine. He agrees to cooperate with
investigators and plead guilty to a single criminal charge. Boesky
later is sentenced to three years in prison.
   Late 1986 - Published reports link Milken to an illegal insider
trading network led by Boesky.
   Sept. 7, 1988 - The Securities and Exchange Commission accuses
Drexel, Milken and three others of violating a wide range of
securities laws, most in connection with Boesky.
   Dec. 21 - Drexel agrees to plead guilty to six felonies and pay
a record $650 million in fines and restitution to settle the
biggest securities fraud probe in history.
   March 29, 1989 - A federal grand jury indicts Milken, brother
Lowell, and former Drexel trader Bruce Newberg on 98 counts of
racketeering and fraud largely based on information supplied by
Boesky. Potential penalties and fines total $12 billion plus
possible prison terms.
   April 7 - The Milkens plead innocent. Newberg enters an innocent
plea later.
   April 13 - Drexel and the SEC announce a settlement of the civil
fraud case that subjects the firm to federal monitoring for three
years and forces it to sever ties with Milken.
   June 15 - Milken resigns after 19 years at Drexel to form his
own consulting firm. Lowell Milken quits to return to practicing
law.
   Sept. 11 - Drexel formally pleads guilty to six felonies and
begins paying its fine.
   Feb. 13, 1990 - Drexel's parent company files for federal
bankruptcy court protection after defaulting on debts and begins
laying off employees.
   March 19 - Prosecutors promise to bring a new indictment with
broader charges against Milken by the week of April 16.
   April 4 - Boesky is released from federal custody after
completing two years of a three-year term.
   April 19 - Four months of negotiations intensify between the
government and Milken for a possible plea bargain to settle the
case as a deadline looms for the new indictment.
   April 20 - Milken agrees to settle his case and reaches a plea
bargain guilty plea with the government.
   April 24 - Milken tearfully pleads guilty to six felonies
including conspiracy, securities fraud, mail fraud and assisting in
the filing of a false tax return, carrying a total maximum sentence
of 28 years imprisonment. Four of the counts directly involve
Boesky. Milken also agrees to pay $600 million in restitution and
fines and cooperate with the government after sentencing, set for
Oct. 1.
   Sept. 24 - U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood orders pre-sentencing
memorandums released to the public because of enormous interest in
the case. Federal prosecutors urge her to give Milken a severe
punishment, based partly on crimes Milken hasn't admitted. Defense
attorneys ask Wood to consider only the six charges in his guilty
plea and urge her to sentence him to community service.
   Sept. 27 - Wood delays sentencing to hold a special two-week
hearing in mid-October to consider the government's array of
unproven charges against him. She says the purpose of the hearing
is to gain a greater insight into Milken's character in order to
fashion a fair sentence.
   Oct. 11-25 - Eight days of testimony by more than a dozen
government witnesses fail to link Milken decisively to lawbreaking
in three transactions. Former Drexel employees describe secret
bathroom conversations, cryptic orders, document destruction and
questionable behavior, but hard evidence against Milken is scant.
Ex-Drexel chief executive Frederick Joseph testifies against his
star employee for the first time. Milken and Boesky do not take the
stand.
   Oct. 30 - The defense, in written closing arguments, says the
government failed to prove Milken guilty of the additional crimes.
Prosecutors sat they proved their case conclusively.
   Nov. 21 - Milken is sentenced by U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood
to 10 years in prison and three years of probation, during which he
must do 1,800 hours of community service annually.

   Litton Industries, Inc., and Rockwell
International Corp., have joined a growing list of major military
contractors paring their workforces.
   Litton confirmed this week it eliminated 600 of its 6,000 jobs
in Southern California from October 1989 to September. Defense
facilities in Woodland Hills and Van Nuys were hit the hardest,
losing 550 of 4,400 jobs, Litton spokesman Robert Knapp said.
   Also this week, Rockwell officials said the company had cut 161
union employees at its Rocketdyne division in Canoga Park.
Rocketdyne's union membership accounts for about one-fifth of its
9,100-employee work force.
   A week ago, TRW Inc.'s Redondo Beach-based space and defense
operations acknowledged eliminating 1,600 jobs, about one-tenth of
the work force, through attrition and layoffs. Most of the layoffs
were in California.
   All three companies acknowledged the layoffs and other job
eliminations only after inquiries from newspapers, the last two in
response to the Los Angeles Daily News.
   Because the numbers are relatively low and have taken place
gradually, the companies are not required to announce the
reductions formally.
   The cuts are further evidence of hard California's aerospace
industry has been hit by cuts in defense programs.
   McDonnell Douglas Corp., Lockheed Corp. and Northrop Corp.
announced plans over the last year to reduce their Southern
California work forces by 22,000.
   In 1989, Hughes Aircraft Co. said it was eliminating 9,300 jobs,
most of them in Southern California.

   A suburban Philadelphia woman faces charges
that she tried to sell a secret SmithKline Beecham marketing plan
to one of the drug maker's main competitors, the FBI said
Wednesday.
   Rebecca J. Lindquester, 42, of Newtown Square, was arrested
Tuesday after exchanging photocopies of the marketing plan with a
representative of a competing drug company, which had notified the
authorities of her offer, said FBI Special Agent Wayne R. Gilbert.
   The competing drug company, Glaxo Inc. of Raleigh, N.C.,
produces Zantac, an anti-ulcer drug that competes on the market
with the SmithKline Beecham product Tagamet.
   Tagamet is SmithKline's biggest seller, with annual sales in the
hundreds of millions of dollars.
   Lindquester and her husband, David, co-own Horizon Productions,
a video-production firm that had obtained the marketing plan Sept.
5 when SmithKline asked the firm to bid on a contract to produce a
videotape to train sales representatives on a new use for Tagamet.
   Her husband was not charged in the case.
   Shortly after obtaining the marketing plan, Lindquester
contacted Jim Daly, product manager for Glaxo.
   Identifying herself as ``Mary Anne Riley,'' she said she was
willing to sell material to Glaxo that would give it ``a
competitive advantage'' over Tagamet, the FBI said.
   Daly notified Glaxo's security office, which contacted the FBI
on Sept. 11.
   Over the next two months, Lindquester sent several fax messages
to Daly, demanding $500,000 for the material, the FBI said.
   On Friday, in a telephone conversation recorded by Glaxo
security, the woman agreed to accept $25,000 for the material, the
FBI said.
   Daly and the woman agreed to meet at the Airport Marriott near
Philadelphia International Airport. After making the exchange,
Lindquester went out to her car in the hotel parking lot, where the
FBI arrested her.
   She was arraigned before U.S. Magistrate Judge M. Faith Angell
and released on $2,000 bail. Lindquester was charged with fraud by
wire and faces five years in prison and a $1,000 fine if convicted.

   Fleet-Norstar Financial Group Inc.,
considered to be one of New England's strongest banking companies,
slashed its dividend by almost 43 percent Wednesday.
   Fleet directors declared a quarterly dividend of 20 cents per
share, down from 35 cents, payable Jan. 1 to stockholders of record
Dec. 15. Analysts had expected some sort of cut.
   Terrence Murray, Fleet chairman and chief executive, said Fleet
retains a 7 percent capital-to-assets ratio, compared with the
industry average of almost 5 percent. But ``retention of capital is
the most prudent course of action at this time.''
   The region is in the throes of an economic downturn, with
slumping real estate values and higher loan defaults eroding the
value of bank stocks and the banks' bottom lines.
   Fleet, with $33.6 billion in assets, joins a growing list of
banks that have cut shareholder returns as loan losses have
increased. As of Sept. 30, Fleet reported non-performing loans of
$852 million, up almost $100 million from the previous quarter.
   Fleet reported a loss of 5 cents per share for the nine months
ended Sept. 30, compared with earnings of $2.51 the year before. It
had third-quarter earnings of 33 cents per share, down from 86
cents last year.

   The association of Italian floor traders
decided Wednesday to suspend their protest strike, which has
blocked trading since Friday.
   The suspension will be effective until Nov. 30, when traders
will evaluate the progress made in adopting legislation modernizing
the stock market and simplifying a proposed capital gains tax.
   The decision followed a meeting early Wednesday between
representatives of striking floor traders and members of the
Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies.
   Trading on Italy's 10 regional stock exchanges, which are
dominated by the Milan bourse, is expected to resume Thursday.
   The floor traders had called the strike to protest a new
government proposal for a 30 percent capital gains tax. They fear
that the way the government intends to collect the tax will scare
investors away from the stock market and shift business to other
European markets.
   The government has said it is willing to consider technical
improvements in the implementation of the law, but that it isn't
willing to renounce the capital gains tax itself.

   Heavy usage of soybean oil and meal sent futures
prices higher Wednesday in the soybean complex at the Chicago Board
of Trade.
   Corn weakened in late trading, while wheat futures advanced a
few cents a bushel.
   The U.S. Census Bureau's soybean crush report for October,
released after the close of trading on Tuesday, showed inventories
of oil and meal below analysts' expectations.
   ``The census crush showed record domestic use for October for
both oil and meal,'' said Dan Cekander, an analyst in Chicago with
Rodman &amp; Renshaw Inc.
   Soy oil inventories were put at 1.222 billion pounds and soy
meal at 302,550 tons.
   Cekander noted there was growing pressure, from farm groups and
others, to extend credit to the Soviet Union for U.S. farm goods.
He said, however, the pressure did not add much to the market's
sensitivity to the huge export potential.
   At the close, wheat was 1} cents to 5 cents higher with the

<TEXT>
   Guinness PLC, the British beer and liquor group,
said today it has agreed to make an offer of 518 million pounds, or
$1.02 billion, for La Cruz del Campo, Spain's largest brewer.
   The deal would be one of the largest ever foreign buyouts in
Spain.
   Guinness said it has the backing of shareholders in control of
more than half the ordinary shares of Seville-based La Cruz del
Campo, which controls 22 percent of the Spanish market.
   But the Spanish firm's board insisted all shareholders receive
the same opportunity to sell shares, meaning the board-recommended
offer hinges on a vote planned at an extraordinary Cruz del Campo
shareholders meeting set for the first half of December.
   The takeover would make Guinness the world's 12th largest brewer
by volume, up from its current position as 17th.
   ``The acquisition of Cruzcampo provides Guinness with a key
strategic base'' in the fast-growing Spanish beer market, now the
second-largest in Europe, Guinness Chairman Anthony Tennant said.
   The Spanish company, whose shares are not traded publicly, had
been up for sale for more than a year drawing offers from the
world's premier brewing firms, including the Netherlands' Heineken
N.V., Denmark's Carlsberg and Elders IXL Ltd. of Australia.
   The Guinness purchase could be completed as early as the end of
next January, Cruz del Campo said.
   Talk of a Cruz del Campo sale emerged after the U.S.'s Stroh
Brewery Co. of Detroit sought to sell its 28 percent share in Cruz
del Campo.
   Guinness said it had reached an agreement with Stroh not only to
purchase its Cruz del Campo shares, but Stroh's 30 percent stake in
the Cruz del Campo unit, Henninger Espanola SA. It will pay 18
million pounds, or $35.28 million, for the Henninger stake.
   Cruz del Campo owns all or part of five other smaller Spanish
brewers.
   Guinness said it also planned to offer to buy those minority
shares not owned by Cruz del Campo in its subsidiaries for an
estimated price of 15 million pounds, or $29.4 million.
   Cruz del Campo currently holds a 22 percent share of the
fast-growing Spanish market, up from 17 percent a decade ago.
   Net profit last last year rose 18 percent to 10.59 billion
pesetas, or $98 million, and in the five years prior to last year
rose an average 26 per cent per year, the company said.
   ``The decision to sell the group has not been an easy one, but
we reached the conclusion in 1989 that (Cruz del Campo) had reached
the limits of what it could achieve on its own,'' Cruz del Campo
chairman Ignacio Ybarra Mendaro said in a statement.
   ``To continue development and profitable expansion, we needed
the resources and experience of an important and solvent
international group,'' he added.

   Guinness PLC said Wednesday it has agreed to buy
Spain's largest brewer, La Cruz del Campo, for $1.02 billion, in a
deal that will make the British company the world's 12th largest
brewer.
   The acquisition would be one of the biggest foreign takeovers in
Spain, where closely held Cruz del Campo commands a 22 percent
share of the fast-growing beer market.
   Guinness, which ranks 17th among the world's brewers, said it
already had the backing of shareholders who control more than half
the Seville-based company's stock.
   Guinness said it also has reached an agreement with the Stroh
Brewery Co. of Detroit to buy both its 28 percent holding in Cruz
del Campo and its 30 percent holding in Henninger Espanola SA, a
Cruz del Campo subsidiary. The purchase price of the Henninger
stake is 18 million pounds, or $35.5 million.
   ``The acquisition of Cruzcampo provides Guinness with a key
strategic base'' in Spain, said Guinness Chairman Anthony Tennant.
   ``The decision to sell the group has not been an easy one, but
we reached the conclusion earlier this year that (Cruz del Campo)
had reached the limits of what it could achieve on its own,'' said
Cruz del Campo Chairman Ignacio Ybarra Mendaro.
   The Spanish brewer, whose shares are not publicly traded, was on
the block for nearly a year and had attracted interest from a
variety of foreign brewers.
   Guinness said it would pay for the acquisition with cash and
existing credit lines. It said the purchase was not expected to
dilute its earnings per share in the first year after the deal is
completed. The purchase subsequently should enhance earnings,
Guinness said.
   The deal is expected to be completed in January 1991.
   Philip Morrisey, an analyst with the London investment firm
Kleinwort Benson Securities, said the acquisition would help
balance Guinness' income from brewing and distilling. Morrisey
estimated that adding Cruz del Campo would raise brewing results
from 17 percent to about 21 percent of Guinness' pre-tax profit.
   But analysts questioned whether Cruz del Campo would be able to
continue expanding at its current rate. Industry projections called
for a slowdown in the growth of Spanish beer sales to about 1
percent this year, from the 4 percent average of the 1980s.
   Analysts said nationwide expansion could be difficult because of
strongholds that other brewers have in regions outside Andalucia,
where Cruz del Campo dominates.
   ``Spaniards are loyal to regional brands and it won't be easy to
convince them to change,'' said Carlos de la Serna, an analyst with
Iberagentes SA in Madrid.
   Cruz del Campo's after-tax profit jumped 14 percent last year to
$81 million dollars. Sales rose 12 percent to $467 million.
   Guinness had after-tax profit of 472 million pounds, or $930
million, last year on revenue of 3.07 billion pounds, or $6.05
billion.

   Michael R. Milken climbed quietly to the
pinnacle of high-finance in the 1980s. He descended with a
shattering crash into disgrace and prison, where he'll likely spend
a good chunk of the 1990s.
   Born and raised in California, Milken was a math whiz helping
his father's accounting business by age 10. He studied arcane
business tracts while others marched for civil rights and peace
during the 1960s. In his early years on Wall Street, Milken
digested financial documents during a two-hour commute.
   With the same passion, Milken avoided the limelight after
gaining market prowess, shunning interviews and refusing to pose
alone for the annual report of his employer, Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc.
   Milken became a familiar figure only after speculator Ivan
Boesky fingered him in the government's fraud investigation in late
1986. The most prominent financier in the securities industry in
the booming 1980s, Milken became prosecutors' main target.
   After insisting he was innocent, Milken changed his mind in
April. Under a plea bargain, he pleaded guilty to six felony counts
and agreed to pay $600 million in penalties and restitution to
defrauded investors.
   The 44-year-old former head of Drexel's junk-bond department was
sentenced Wednesday to a 10-year imprisonment and three years of
probation. He must serve at least a third of the prison term.
   ``To some it might sound ironic, but I have spent a lifetime
trying to avoid publicity,'' Milken wrote in letter to U.S.
District Judge Kimba Wood prior to sentencing. ``My parents taught
me if you worked hard and knew you did a good job, you should not
need recognition from others.''
   Milken was born on the Fourth of July in 1946. As a child he was
a star student, and said he was embarrassed when his fourth-grade
teacher singled out his perfect scores.
   He graduated the University of California at Berkeley in 1968
and went on to the University of Pennsylvania's prestigious Wharton
School. In between, he married Lori Anne Hackel, his high school
sweetheart.
   In 1970, at age 24, Milken joined Drexel's New York office as
head of fixed-income research, commuting from his southern New
Jersey home by bus. By 1973, he was head of high-yield bonds. His
compensation was set in a 1975 formula - and never altered - that
gave him a portion of the department's profits.
   Milken was to become infamous for the $1.1 billion he earned
from 1983-87, $550 million in 1987 alone. Milken has said the
wealth was a byproduct of his work raising money for companies.
   ``I went to Wall Street with the desire to help change society
for the better, not to find a fortune,'' Milken told the judge.
   ``I felt that working in the financial community created the
best opportunity for social change: making capital available where
it hadn't been before,'' he wrote.
   Prompted by his father's illness, Milken was allowed to move
Drexel's high-yield bond department to Beverly Hills, Calif., in
1978. As the economy prospered in the mid-1980s, Wall Street and
junk bonds developed into a $200 billion market by the decade's
end.
   They were used in the biggest takeover deals ever, helping to
reshape American business and creating an inner circle of corporate
raiders. Milken became linked to the mock title of Drexel's annual
junk bond conference, ``the predator's ball.''
   He worked 18 hour days and scheduled 4 a.m. meetings with
corporate executives soliciting his financial acumen. He and his
lawyers maintain Milken still had time for a quiet home life with
his wife and three children in a modest house 10 blocks from the
Encino, Calif., home his parents bought in 1954.
   In his letter to the judge, Milken said of his ordeal: ``I have
been forced to face the challenge that not only am I portrayed as a
fraud, but everything my life stood for is called a fraud and all
the principles I have spoken about my whole life are hollow.''

   Here are short profiles of some of the major
figures in Wall Street's financial scandals besides Michael Milken:
   -MICHAEL R. MILKEN, former head of junk-bond trading at Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., sentenced to a 10 year imprisonment and three
years probation on six counts of violating federal securities and
tax laws. He also agreed to pay $600 million in penalties. Four of
the six charges involved dealings with chief accuser Ivan F.
Boesky, though none in insider trading or racketeering. Milken is
widely regarded as the most powerful financier of the 1980s.
   -IVAN BOESKY, former speculator in takeover stocks, paid $100
million and pleaded guilty to one count of lying to federal
regulators in a broad insider trading network. He was released from
federal custody in April after completing two years of a three-year
prison term. His confessions in late 1986 led investigators to
Milken.
   -DENNIS LEVINE, paroled last year after serving 17 months of a
two-year prison term for securities fraud, tax evasion and perjury.
Levine's confessions about a broad insider trading ring led
prosecutors to Boesky. The former Drexel managing director, who
accepted satchels of money and arranged deals from pay phones,
pleaded guilty to four felonies and returned $11.6 million in
alleged illegal profits. In a first-person article in a business
magazine this year, Levine said he started an investment advisory
firm.
   -MARTIN SIEGEL, pleaded guilty in 1987 to illegal stock trading
and tax evasion while head of mergers and acquisitions at Kidder,
Peabody &amp; Co. He also agreed to return $9 million in cash and
securities to settle civil charges for his role in illegal dealings
with Boesky. Siegel, a former Drexel managing director, was
sentenced in June to a two-month prison term, which he has
completed.
   -BOYD L. JEFFERIES, a Los Angeles stockbroker snared in the
Boesky web, was placed on probation and fined $250,000 after two
years of helping the government. He pleaded guilty to two felony
counts in 1987 and then testified in the trials of GAF Corp. and
corporate raider Paul Bilzerian. He is living and working in Palm
Springs, Calif., and Aspen, Colo.
   -PAUL A. BILZERIAN, the Florida investor, last year received
four years in prison for his conviction on nine counts of
securities fraud, conspiracy and making false statements, and fined
$1.5 million. The sentence for the former Singer Co. chairman was
the stiffest in the Wall Street scandals. Bilzerian is is free
pending appeal.
   -ROBERT FREEMAN, former head of arbitrage for Goldman, Sachs &amp;
Co., was arrested along with two other executives for insider
trading in the most dramatic of the government's string of cases.
Implicated by Siegel, Freeman pleaded guilty to one felony count
and in April was sentenced to four months in prison and fined $1
million. He completed the term Aug. 30.
   -BRUCE NEWBERG, a former Drexel trader, was indicted along with
Milken and convicted with five others in the Princeton-Newport
Partners racketeering and fraud trial. He was sentenced to three
months in prison in the Princeton-Newport case. Newberg was
Milken's assistant at Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif., high-yield
bond division. His status in the Milken case is unresolved.
   -JOHN A. MULHEREN JR., a former wunderkind stock speculator, was
convicted earlier this year of conspiracy and securities fraud in
connection for manipulating Gulf &amp; Western Inc. stock at Boesky's
behest in 1985. Mulheren was sentenced this month to one year and
one day in prison and fined $1.86 million. He's free pending
appeal.

<HEAD>German Unification Creates New Ground For Coke and Pepsi Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A flash point of the Cold War has become a focus
of the cola wars.
   Since the Berlin Wall opened last year, Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola
have spent millions of dollars trying to establish a presence in
what was formerly East Germany.
   Pepsico Inc. representatives, with television cameras rolling,
handed out cans of Pepsi when the wall was dismantled. And when
East Germany allowed advertising on national TV for the first time
this spring, a Coca-Cola Co. spot was among the first to air.
   ``The first unification of Germany was soft drink unification,''
said Emanuel Goldman, an industry analyst for PaineWebber Inc. in
San Francisco.
   The cola makers are concentrating now on building a distribution
system and inching toward full-scale manufacturing in the region,
which for nearly half a century was closed to most Western
products.
   The companies also are moving along with the type of aggressive
public relations and advertising that have characterized soft drink
competition elsewhere for decades.
   Already, Coke says it is outselling its nearest competitor
10-to-1, a contention which Pepsi dismisses.
   Atlanta-based Coke, which has a bottling operation running in
what was East Berlin, says it has sold 7 million cases of Coca-Cola
products since entering the former Communist country in February.
Pepsi, a division of Purchase, N.Y.-based Pepsico, entered the new
German market in January, but says it does not yet have reliable
sales figures.
   ``Either sideis guessing. It's a little too early in the
game,'' said Tod MacKenzie, a Pepsi-Cola spokesman. ``There's no
independent measurement (in the eastern sector) to represent what
your share of the market is.
   ``We can say we shipped so much, but that's not a measure of
consumer take ... just how much we sent out the door.''
   The soft drink makers say they're expecting great things in the
newly united Germany. That assessment is shared by analyst Goldman.
   ``It's good for both companies,'' Goldman said, adding that Coke
begins with a head start because of the commanding presence it had
in West Germany and most of Europe.
   ``We think East Germany ... will reach the consumption levels of
West Germany in the next few years.'' Ralph Cooper, president of
Coke's European Community Group, said in a recent interview. ``We
think that's a very achievable target.''
   ``Nearly 70 percent of the people have tried Coca-Cola in the
first months,'' said Cooper, whose division accounts for about
one-quarter of Coke's international sales.
   According to Coke, East German soft drink consumption in 1989
was 315 eight-ounce servings per person, compared with 334 in West
Germany. West German consumption of Coke products was 167
eight-ounce servings per person in 1989, and company officials
estimate that East German per capita Coke consumption is now about
30.
   In the United States - the world leader in soft drink
consumption - the per capita rate for Coca-Cola products was 283.
Coke is the No. 1 soft drink company in the United States, with
about 41 percent of the domestic market, though most of the
company's recent growth has come overseas.
   Pepsi's per capita figures were unavailable.
   Goldman said it is easier for Coke to get established in the new
market because it literally can move its West German operations
next door. Pepsi has a much smaller operation there, about
one-fifth the size of Coke's, he said.
   ``For Pepsi, it's good,'' he said. ``For Coke, it's spectacular.
They know how to sell it there. They know the whole market there.''
   Pepsi, however, says its strong presence for nearly 20 years in
such Eastern bloc nations as the Soviet Union, Poland, Yugoslavia
and Czechloslovakia gives it an advantage.
   ``Pepsi's historical leadership position throughout the Eastern
bloc has provided significant leverage to power us into the East
German market as well,'' said MacKenzie.
   Pepsi's initial activity in eastern Germany has involved
building a distribution system across the key southern commercial
belt, which includes Leipzig and Dresden. Manufacturing is still
down the road for Pepsi, MacKenzie said.
   Coke has concentrated its efforts on distribution, but it also
is creating an infrastructure for manufacturing, bottling and
sales, Cooper said.
   ``We want to be a part of everyday life there,'' he said.
   Cooper said the company tapped into its West German operation
for help on the other side of the border once the wall opened.
   Coke has plastered cities with advertising posters and has
sponsored a number of local events. Pepsi put up a 40-foot
permanent billboard on a major thoroughfare in East Berlin and
advertises on public transportation.
   ``It's amazing how quickly a consumer open goods market has
taken over there,'' MacKenzie said.
   MacKenzie said Pepsi also has tried to respond to the Germans'
heightened environmental awareness by offering its products in
recyclable plastic bottles.

<HEAD>Employee Group Announces Buyout Bid For Georgia-Pacific; Company
Dismisses It</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An employee group said Wednesday it planned to
launch a bid to buy Georgia-Pacific Corp., a move the giant forest
products company dismissed as the work of a disgruntled former
worker.
   The employees group, in conjunction with International Business
Consultants, a Dallas consulting and management firm, announced
through a press release that it was trying to recruit workers to
participate in an employee stock ownership plan to buy
Georgia-Pacific's mills and subsidiaries.
   Joe Greer, a spokesman for IBC, said it would be the largest
ESOP buyout of a public company in U.S. history. The group did not
put a dollar figure on the bid.
   Georgia-Pacific immediately dismissed an employee buyout as
having ``absolutely no chance of success.''
   ``Georgia-Pacific does not take seriously the possibility that
the group in question, IBC, could affect the buyout of the company
using an employee stock ownership plan,'' Georgia-Pacific Chairman
T. Marshall Hahn said in a statement.
   He said Georgia-Pacific has identified the people behind the
move as two Arkansas realtors and a disgruntled former employee of
Great Northern Nekoosa Corp.
   Georgia-Pacific this year concluded a $5 billion buyout of Great
Northern after a long and bitter struggle, creating the world's
largest forest products company.
   Hahn added that G-P has not been presented with a proposal, and
said the company planned to ask the Securities and Exchange
Commission to investigate for possible stock manipulation.
   Trading of Georgia-Pacific stock was halted on the New York
Stock Exchange around the time the press release was issued. The
stock resumed trading and closed down 87{ cents at $34.50 per
share.

   Bond prices climbed Wednesday in light,
pre-holiday dealings as speculation grew that interest rates are
headed lower.
   The Treasury's key 30-year bond rose 7-16 point, or $4.40 per
$1,000 in face amount, while its yield to 8.42 percent from 8.46
percent late Tuesday. Trading was sluggish on the day before the
Thanskgiving holiday, with the market closed at 2 p.m. An early
close is also slated for Friday.
   Elliott Platt, who follows the bond markets for the investment
firm Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities, said weak economic
reports are contributing to speculation that interest rates may be
headed lower.
   On Wednesday, a government report said initial jobless claims
rose 39,000 to 488,000 in the latest week.
   ``It indicates the economy is in a recession and the recession
is deepening,'' he said. He said many traders expect the Federal
Reserve will take more steps to lower interest rates before the end
of the year.
   When interest rates fall, the prices of bonds already in the
hands of investors rise.
   It is widely believed that the central bank relaxed its monetary
policy last week amid mounting evidence of economic deterioration.
The Fed does not announce such actions, but it is believed that it
demonstrated its intentions by allowing a quarter-point drop in the
federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other for overnight
loans.
   That rate stood at 7{ percent Wednesday, unchanged from late
Tuesday.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-term
maturities rose 5-32 point to \ point, intermediate maturities
advanced 11-32 point point and long-term issues rose as much as
7-16 point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial information
service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, added 3.15 to 1,174.99.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose 3-32 point. The average yield to
maturity fell to 7.48 percent down from 7.49 percent late Tuesday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.23 percent as the
discount lost 7 basis points to 7.02 percent. Yields on six-month
bills fell to 7.31 percent as the discount fell 8 basis points to
6.97 percent. Yields on one-year bills dropped to 7.23 percent as
the discount lost 8 basis points to 6.77 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.

<HEAD>Oil Up In Light Trading Before Thanksgiving</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices rose moderately Wednesday, as the
futures market turned bullish over a drop in the crude supply and
France's prediction that the U.N. Security Council will authorize
military action against Iraq.
   Light sweet crude oil moved up 72 cents to $29.63 per barrel for
January delivery contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
erasing much of Tuesday's fall of $1.81 per barrel.
   Volume was about as light as it has been for any session since
Iraq invaded Kuwait in August, as traders prepared to take off for
the Thanksgiving holiday. The oil market reopens Friday, but some
traders planned to take a four-day weekend.
   ``I suppose we're having one of the dullest days we've had in
several weeks around here,'' said Bob Baker, an oil analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Traders were generally unwilling to enter into new oil contracts
because of the possibility of unexpected developments in the
Persian Gulf, where President Bush was spending the holiday with
U.S. troops.
   ``In the back of people's minds, they're thinking anything could
happen with him over there,'' said Peter Beutel, an analyst with
Pegasus Econometric Group Inc., in Hoboken, N.J.
   Oil opened higher in response to an American Petroleum Institute
report issued that night before that showed stocks of crude oil and
refined products dropped in the previous week.
   Crude then hit its high for the day of $30.20 per barrel after
French President Francois Mitterrand said he had told Bush that a
U.N. resolution authorizing force against Iraq was needed. The
French leader said such a resolution would likely be passed within
three weeks.
   Adding to the market's bullish mood were perceptions that the
United States and the Soviet Union had become closer in their views
on the Gulf crisis.
   ``The Soviets, who were talking about being against military
intervention earlier in the week, have kind of backpedaled,'' said
Brian Tagler, a broker with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ``Each
day, we find they agree more and more with President Bush.''
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Wednesday urged the
U.N. Security Council to meet immediately on the Gulf crisis.
   As oil moved ahead, refined petroleum products tagged along.
   Unleaded gasoline rose 1.48 cents to 78.95 cents a gallon on
December contracts, with later contract months moving higher as
well. Home heating oil was higher for all delivery months, with the
December contract up .79 cent at 85.24 cents a gallon.
   Baker said heating oil's relatively weaker performance reflected
a belief among traders that no supply problems seem likely this
winter.
   Natural gas futures traded lower, with the January delivery
contract falling 2 cents to $2.61 per 1,000 cubic feet.

   The stock market struggled to a mixed showing
Wednesday in a quiet, uninspired preholiday session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.16 to 2,539.36.
   But declining issues slightly outnumbered advances in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 719 up, 746
down and 516 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 140.66 million
shares, down from 161.17 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 172.42 million shares.
   Trading tapered off through the session as traders got an early
start on the Thanksgiving holiday.
   Stock prices have rallied briskly in recent weeks as hopes have
mounted for lower interest rates.
   But analysts said traders seem reluctant to join too
enthusiastically in the upswing until they can get a better fix on
the likely extent of the recession.
   Bond prices rose and interest rates fell Wednesday in the
government-securities market on new evidence of economic weakness.
   The Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment
insurance increased 39,000 in the week ended Nov. 10, to a
seven-year high of 488,000.
   That prompted expectations of negative news in the employment
statistics for November, which are due out Dec. 7 as one of the
first readings on the performance of the economy this month.
   Gainers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, up } at 114&lsqb;; General Electric, up { at 53}; Boeing, up
1| at 44\; Eli Lilly, up 2{ at 68{, and Philip Morris, up &lsqb; at 48}.
   Bank stocks were broadly lower. BankAmerica dropped { to 22{;
C&amp;S-Sovran } to 16|; NCNB 1 to 24; Citicorp &lsqb; to 12|; Chase
Manhattan &lsqb; to 10{, and Manufacturers Hanover &lsqb; to 18&rsqb;.
   In the mortgage sector, Federal National Mortgage lost 1 to 30|
and Federal Home Loan Mortgage was down &rsqb; at 37&rsqb;.
   Federal National Mortgage warrants, which give their holders the
right to buy Fannie Mae stock for $14.75 a share, fell ~ to 16 in
active trading.
   On the plus side, Systems Center Inc. climbed 1\ to 9~. The
company said it expects to post 1990 earnings ``somewhere in the
middle'' of analyst estimates ranging from about 70 cents a share
to $1.20 a share.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $3.95 billion, or 0.13
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .25 to 172.73.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.02 to 370.68, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up .72 at 316.03.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market edged
up .48 to 348.77. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 295.58, down .43.

<HEAD>Money Funds Rose $6.36 Billion in Latest Week to Record $423.52
Billion</HEAD>

Investment Company Institute are for week ended Tuesday. Bank Rate
Monitor figures are for the week ended Wednesday.</NOTE>

   Assets of the nation's 524 money market mutual
funds rose $6.36 billion in the latest week to an all time high as
investors reacted to a lower interest rate target by the Federal
Reserve, the Investment Company Institute said Wednesday.
   The rise, to $423.52 billion in the six-day period ended
Tuesday, broke the record of $418.33 billion set in the week ended
Nov. 7. The most recent period was shortened by the Thanksgiving
holiday.
   The surge followed a revised $1.17 billion drop in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group.
   Jacob Dreyer, chief economist at the institute, said the rise
came as investors, particularly insitutions, shifted from money
market securities to mutual funds as the Fed allowed short-term
interest rates to fall slightly.
   The biggest weekly rise in the funds' assets - $9.64 billion in
the week ended Oct. 21, 1987 - came during the stock market
collapse as investors sought safe havens for their money.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 260 general purpose funds rose $1.3 billion to $149.9
billion, assets of 104 broker-dealer funds increased $1.32 billion
to $166.29 billion, and assets of 160 institutional funds rose
$3.74 billion to $107.24 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.35 percent from 7.34 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 7.38 percent from 7.40 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
51 days, up from 49 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts fell to
6.00 percent as of Wednesday from 6.01 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged from the previous week at 5.08 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.55
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 7.58 the
previous week. Yields were 7.66 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
7.71 percent; 7.77 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 7.80 percent;
and 8.01 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.03 percent.

<HEAD>Jury Finds Mobil Unjustly Fired Environmental Officer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TODD RICHISSIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mobil Chemical Co. unjustly fired a top
executive after he refused to go along with a company cover-up of
environmental problems, a federal jury found Wednesday.
   The jury awarded the employee, Valcar Bowman, $375,000 in
compensatory damages and $1 million in punitive damages. It also
found in favor of his wife, Pamela, for loss of spousal support,
but awarded her no money. The jury rejected two counter-claims
filed by Mobil against Bowman.
   The panel was asked to decide whether the oil giant fired Bowman
in 1986 because he would not go along with company attorneys who
wanted to sanitize reports that documented Mobil's environmental
problems.
   Valcar also claimed he was fired because he objected to plans to
remove records from a company plant when attorneys realized a raid
by law enforcement officials was imminent.
   ``Justice prevails,'' Bowman said after the verdict was read.
``Of course the money is important, but the fact that the jury
recognized that something wrong was happening here was also very
important.''
   Mobil attorneys had argued that Bowman's job as the No. 2
environmental officer at Mobil Chemical Co. was eliminated as part
of a cost-cutting program.
   ``It's a bad decision and Mobil plans to appeal,'' said Mobil
attorney Richard Ribstein. ``There was no evidence to support any
of the claims.''
   Company attorneys attacked Bowman in closing arguments as a
``fraud'' and a ``liar,'' intent on starting his own business by
getting money from Mobil, the nation's second largest oil company
behind Exxon Corp.
   Bowman's attorneys responded that Mobil was trying to distract
the jury from the evidence with a well-funded smear campaign.
   In his closing arguments, attorney Stephen Wiley produced a
series of memos that indicated Mobil planned to abolish the
position of the manager of environmental affairs as a way to get
rid of Bowman.
   ``We should be prepared to live without the position of
environmental manager for some time, e.g. up to two years,'' said a
company memo dated six weeks before Bowman's dismissal.
   Wiley scoffed at Mobil's contention that Bowman was dismissed in
a cost-cutting move. He noted that in 1986, the year Bowman lost
his job, Mobil's chemical division earned a record $140 million, up
164 percent from 1985.
   Mobil attorneys spent most of their closing arguments trying to
shred Bowman's personal credibility with a parade of resumes,
applications and affidavits that showed Bowman had lied in the
past.
   In one case highlighted by Mobil attorneys, Bowman swore on an
affidavit about 10 years ago that his wife's daughter from a
previous partner was his.
   The jury also witnessed a parade of excerpts from the dictionary
- blown up and highlighted on 2-by-4-foot cards - of the
definitions of the words ``bogus,'' ``swindle,'' ``hypocrite'' and
``heist.''

<HEAD>Domestic Usage, Soviet Potential Push Soy Complex Futures Higher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean traders, eyeing both domestic usage and the potential
for exports to the Soviet Union, sent prices higher Wednesday at
the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybeans were up to 9 cents higher while soy oil more than
recovered losses suffered Tuesday. Wheat also was higher, while
corn lost a penny or so.
   On other markets, livestock and meat futures were mostly higher,
as were precious metals and petroleum futures.
   The U.S. Census Bureau's soybean crush report for October,
released after the close of trading on Tuesday, showed inventories
of oil and meal below analysts' expectations.
   ``The census crush showed record domestic use for October for
both oil and meal,'' said Dan Cekander, an analyst in Chicago with
Rodman &amp; Renshaw Inc.
   Soy oil inventories were put at 1.222 billion pounds and soy
meal at 302,550 tons.
   The soybean and grain markets derived initial firmness from
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's remarks Tuesday about the need
for the U.N. Security Council to address the crisis in the Persian
Gulf.
   ``If Bush get's Gorbachev's support in the Persian Gulf, then
we're more likely to give him food aid or export credits,'' said
Victor Lespinasse, assistant vice president of grains for Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Cekander noted that there was growing pressure, from farm groups
and others, to extend credit to the Soviet Union for U.S. farm
goods. He said, however, that the pressure didn't add much to the
market's extreme sensitivity to this huge export potential.
   Wheat settled 3{ cents to 5} cents higher with the contract for
delivery in December at $2.49 a bushel; corn was \ cent to 1{ cents
lower with December at $2.20{ a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1
cent lower with December at $1.07{ a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents
ot 9 cents higher with January at $5.77\ a bushel; soybean oil was
10 cents to 36 cents higher with December at $20.21 per 100 pounds;
and soybean meal was 50 cents to $2.60 higher with December at
$174.50 a ton.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, with frozen pork bellies regaining most of
their limit losses of the previous session.
   The firmness in cattle futures was mostly a consolidation after
Tuesday's losses that reflected the largest Nov. 1 cattle-on-feed
inventories in a dozen years.
   Live cattle settled .15 cent lower to .15 cent higher with the
December ontract at 79.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were
unchanged to .17 cent higher, live hogs were unchanged to .55 cent
higher with December at 53.65 cents a pound; and frozen pork
bellies were 1 cent to 1.45 cents higher with February at 71.65
cents a pound.
   Precious metals futures advanced on the Commodity Exchange in
New York.
   The markets got support early in the session from a decline in
the Dow Jones industrial average and a softer U.S. dollar.
   Gold settled 50 cents to $1.30 higher with the December contract
at $379.80 a troy ounce; silver was 1.2 cents to 1.8 cents higher
with November at $4.12 a troy ounce.
   Petroleum futures moved moderately higher at the New York
Mercantile Exchange, responding to a decline in the supply of crude
oil and France's prediction that the U.N. Security Council will
authorize military action against Iraq.
   Light sweet crude oil settled 35 cents to 72 cents higher with
January at $29.63 a barrel; heating oil was .31 cent to .86 cent
higher with December at 85.24 a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was
.50 cent to 1.77 cent higher with December at 78.95 cents a gallon.

   The dollar ended mixed in lackluster,
pre-holiday trading Wednesday, with little news to affect the
currency, traders said.
   Gold prices rose. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled
at $378.90 a troy ounce, up $1.30 from Tuesday. Republic National
Bank quoted a late bid of $379.15, up $1.55.
   David Ethridge, a vice president and currency trader at Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co., said most activity in the thin market appeared to be
``mopping-up operations'' ahead of Thanksgiving.
   However, he said, some long-term investors continued to sell
dollars to buy the Japanese yen, in part due to a belief that
Japanese interest rates were headed higher while U.S. rates could
drop.
   Higher interest rates tend to support a nation's currency by
making securities denominated in those currencies more valuable.
   The dollar rose against the German mark but fell against the yen
and the British pound.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 127.68 yen from 128.93
yen Tuesday. Later in London, it rose to 128.90 yen. But in New
York, one dollar bought 127.17 yen, down from 128.85 yen late
Tuesday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.9680 from $1.9695 late
Tuesday. But in New York, one pound cost $1.9670, more expensive
than $1.9660 Tuesday.
   The mark traded at 1.4815 to the dollar in Europe, up from
1.4760 Tuesday. In New York, one dollar fetched 1.4770 marks, up
from 1.4740 marks the day before.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's rates, included: 1.2472 Swiss francs, up from 1.2450;
4.9800 French francs, up from 4.9760; 1,109 Italian lire,
unchanged; and 1.1582 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1593.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday,
included: 1.2505 Swiss francs, up from 1.2470; 5.0000 French
francs, up from 4.9780; 1.6717 Dutch guilders, up from 1.6650;
1,112.75 Italian lire, up from 1,110.50; and 1.1587 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1598.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $378.25 a troy ounce,
up from $377.75 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, the metal rose to a
closing bid of $378.50, up from $377.50 bid late Tuesday. Earlier,
in Hong Kong, gold fell $8.17 to close at a bid $372.13.
   Silver prices rose. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery settled at $4.125 a troy ounce, up from $4.11 late
Tuesday. In London, silver rose to a late bid of $4.11 a troy
ounce, up from $4.10 late Tuesday.

<HEAD>Judge OKs Reorganization For Sharon Steel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FARRELL, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Wednesday confirmed a
plan to spin off financially ailing Sharon Steel Corp.'s steel
division to a New York merchant bank and sell brass, railroad and
mining interests to unsecured creditors.
   The reorganization plan brings the nation's 18th largest
steelmaker out of Chapter 11 proceedings in U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
said merchant banker Castle Harlan Inc. and Quantum Overseas N.V.,
the company's largest unsecured creditor.
   U.S. District Judge Warren Bentz approved the plan the day after
confirmation hearings in his Erie courtroom.
   Castle Harlan will pay $300 million to acquire Sharon Steel's
Mercer County steel mill, which employs 2,500 people, and assume
some of the company's steel debt, according to Castle Harlan and
Quantum Overseas.
   They said Quantum Overseas would pay $50 million for a 30
percent share of a company formed from Sharon Steel-owned Mueller
Brass Co. and Arava Natural Resource Co., with the rest of the new
company going to other unsecured creditors.
   The brass, railroad and mining divisions, to be renamed Mueller
Industries Inc., employs 2,500 and posted income of more than $500
million in 1989, Castle Harlan and Quantum Overseas said.
   The firms said outstanding shares of Sharon Steel stock would be
canceled, with holders of those shares receiving no compensation
for their holdings.
   Fifty-eight percent of United Steelworkers union members at
Sharon Steel approved a new contract for the steel spinoff, said
Castle Harlan and Quantum Overseas.

   Kimba M. Wood, the rookie federal judge who gave
Michael R. Milken a 10-year prison term Wednesday, lived up to her
reputation.
   Friends and acquaintances of Wood said the judge's handling of
the most explosive case in her short tenure on the Manhattan
federal bench was characteristically thorough and precise.
   ``I think she went through the most searching, careful and
methodical and thoughtful process,'' said Lloyd Constantine, head
of antitrust enforcement for New York state and a friend of Wood.
   ``She did not treat the matter lightly,'' Constantine said. ``I
can't recall a sentencing where a judge invested so much time and
effort.''
   Wood was besieged with hundreds of letters from Milken
supporters and critics alike. She blazed through mountains of legal
documents from thedefense and prosecution, one portraying Milken
as a gentle philanthropist, the other painting him as an arrogant
crook. It was clear she believed neither.
   Perhaps most important, acquaintances said, was the
extraordinary hearing Wood convened last month into unproven
allegations of Milken's wrongdoing beyond the six felonies he
admitted. It showed both her skepticism and desire to leave no
question unresolved in her final reckoning of Milken's fate.
   Laura Handman, a Manhattan attorney and another friend of Wood,
said she felt confident the judge ``reviewed all the evidence and
weighed all the considerations very closely in reaching her
decision.''
   Wood, 46, is the youngest judge on the Manhattan federal bench,
one of the busiest in the nation. She was appointed two years ago
and received Milken's case through the court's random assignment
system.
   She had no prior sentencing history in major criminal cases,
leaving legal experts little on which to speculate. Few anticipated
she'd give Milken 10 years of the maximum 28 he faced.
   The severity of the term, more than triple the time given
Milken's chief accuser Ivan F. Boesky, was seen as a strong message
to the financial community that securities-law abusers will be
dealt with severely.
   People familiar with Wood have described her as a sensitive,
hard-working judge whose quiet demeanor and dark good looks belie a
sharp mind and a gift for remembering detail. Even her husband,
Time magazine journalist Michael Kramer, recently described Wood's
appearance as misleading to the unwary.
   ``She's always had this very calm exterior and yet she's very
tough,'' Kramer said. ``I mean in the judicial sense, in a
steel-trap mind way.''
   The few nationally prominent cases Wood handled prior to the
Milken case suggested she was willing to be bold.
   In October 1988, she reversed a ruling by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service that had denied refugee status to a Ghanian
soldier who plotted a coup against his government. Last year, she
upheld the right of a 76-year-old New York state judge to seek
reappointment although he had passed retirement age.
   Wood was born Jan. 2, 1944, in Port Townsend, Wash. Her parents
decided to name her Kimba after a small town in South Australia's
Eyre Peninsula they'd found on a map.
   She attended the Sorbonne in Paris, got her B.A. from
Connecticut College, master's degree from the London School of
Economics and law degree from Harvard University. Before she became
a federal judge she practiced antitrust law in Washington and New
York.

   A Pittsburgh-based drug maker sued
American Cyanamid Co. for allegedly violating a marketing agreement
on a drug used to treat high blood pressure.
   Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. is seeking $239 million from American
Cyanamid for allegedly failing to ``exercise its best efforts ...
to advertise, promote and market'' the drug Maxzide from 1987
through this year.
   The suit also seeks at least $176 million from American Cyanamid
for failing to try hard enough to launch an improved version of
Maxzide.
   In addition, the suit seeks $100 million for American Cyanamid's
alleged promotion of its other hypertensive products, as well as
royalties, $500 million in punitive damages and the exclusive right
to market the drug and the bow-tie shape of Maxzide tablets.
   The suit says American Cyanamid agreed to introduce and sell
Maxzide through its Lederle Laboratories Division in March 1984 on
Mylan's request.
   Mylan, a major generic drug manufacturer, developed the drug in
the early 1980s to compete with other potassium-saving,
hypertensive medications, the company said in the suit filed
Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Clarksburg.
   American Cyanamid, based in Wayne, N.J., has paid Mylan $36.1
million in royalties on Maxzide products since 1988 on net sales of
$212.4 million, the lawsuit said.
   Jeff Hoyak, a Lederle spokesman, said the company hadn't seen
the lawsuit and declined comment.

   Law enforcers praised the 10-year prison term
given to Michael R. Milken on Wednesday, but some legal experts
said it was unusually stiff and the financier's supporters called
the punishment excessively brutal.
   From Washington to Wall Street to the West Coast where Milken
made his home, the sentence provoked the kind of mixed reaction
that underscored the widely divergent public opinion of the famous
junk-bond pioneer.
   Milken, former head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s high-yield
bond division, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood for
six felonies stemming from his role as a powerful investment banker
of the past decade.
   ``Outstanding. Richly deserved,'' said Bruce Baird, a former
assistant U.S. attorney who led the initial stages of the
prosecution. ``I think Judge Wood is sending a message to Wall
Street that it's time to stop mewing about technical offenses and
time to start obeying the law.''
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh praised the sentence Milken
received as ``both fair and appropriate to the circumstances.''
   Former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman David S.
Ruder said he was pleased and surprised. ``I did not expect it to
be that severe but I think the penalty is quite in accord with the
severity of his conduct.''
   Some lawmakers, though, said that the sentence, no matter how
severe, could not undo what they called the damage brought by
Milken's crimes.
   ``The harsh fact of the matter is that it will take the American
public much longer than 10 years and much more than $600 million to
pay for the mess these financial engineering schemes have left
behind,'' said Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees the SEC.
   On the other hand some legal experts said the sentence's
severity, while justified, seemed to outstrip the nature of
Milken's crimes.
   ``I think the sentence is all symbolic - it's got nothing to do
with the need to protect society from any future threats from
Milken,'' said Arthur Mathews, the lawyer for takeover speculator
Paul A. Bilzerian, who received what had been the stiffest sentence
in the Wall Street fraud scandal - four years - before Wood
announced Milken's fate.
   ``Implicit in the sentence is that this was more than an
aberration in her view and this was systemic,'' he said.
   There was also little sympathy on Wall Street, where nearly
everyone has a friend who has been laid off as a result of the
downturn in the financial markets since the stock market crash
three years ago.
   When th sentence was handed down shortly before noon, a loud
commotion could be heard for about five seconds on the floor of the
New York Stock Exchange, brokers said - similar to the reaction
when a stock price takes a quick dive.
   ``It was nothing like a wild panic. The damage is done already
and we've all got to go on from here,'' said Steven Schaeffer, a
floor broker with Lawrence Helfant. ``Hopefully he's the last of
the yuppies to go.''
   Frank Kettles, 31, a Wall Street telecommunications worker,
learned of Milken's sentence while drinking with a friend at
Houlihans bar in Manhattan's downtown financial district.
   ``Yeah!'' he shouted, raising his fist. ``Wall Street got a bad
name because of people like him.''
   Down the block, Kecia Montgomery, 25, a former Drexel worker who
quit two years to become a nurse because the profession ``is about
caring not taking,'' took time out from chatting with a hot-dog
vendor to say that Milken's sentence inspires little sympathy with
her.
   ``If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,'' said
Montgomery. ``It's not fair that he did his dirty work and hurt a
lot of people.''
   But in greater Los Angeles, where Milken lives and used to work,
many of his friends reacted with dismay and outrage.
   ``It's like they hit me over the head with a sledgehammer. What
a waste of talent,'' said Richard Riordan, a prominent lawyer and
philanthropist who has been an ally of Milken in many business and
charitable activities.

   Ailing Midway Airlines said Wednesday it had
reached a tentative agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association
on a three-year contract to replace a pact that expired in May.
   The Chicago-based airline did not provide details about the
proposed contract, which is subject to ratification by the 681
Midway cockpit crew members represented by ALPA.
   Midway recently decided to sell its year-old hub at Philadelphia
International Airport and cut its workforce by 10 percent, blaming
high jet fuel costs. The company has posted losses in the last five
quarters.
   Chairman David R. Hinson recently said the carrier plans to add
new service from Chicago.

   National Semiconductor Corp.
announced Wednesday it would sell its Puyallup, Wash., chip plant
to Matsushita Electronic Corp.
   The deal, expected to close early next year, calls for payment
of about $86 million for two buildings and 92 acres where
Matsushita plans to make DRAMS and MOS logic components.
   No technology will be transfered in the deal, National said in a
statement.
   ``The sale of the Puyallup facility allows National to reduce
the excess manufacturing capacity that results from the company's
decision to exit the high-end SRAM business,'' said Charles E.
Sporck, National Semiconductor president and chief executive
officer.
   National, which reported a net loss of $165.5 million or $1.63
per share for its most recent quarter, ceased development of the
very high-speed, high-density SRAMS as part of a restructuring. The
losses included a restructuring charge of $143 million.
   The high-tech company announced in August that it would stop
making computer chips at the Washington plant and was laying off
300 people, leaving about 550 workers at the facility.

<HEAD>Nutrasweet Loses Bid To Trademark Blue Packets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   NutraSweet Co. officials were singing the blues
Wednesday about a federal appeals court decision that the pastel
blue color of the company's Equal brand sweetener packets is not a
trademark.
   NutraSweet, based in north suburban Deerfield, went to court in
February 1989 seeking to halt Stadt Corp. and Cumberland Packing
Corp.'s use of blue packets for their low-calorie Sweet One brand
sweetener.
   The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois
denied NutraSweet's motion for an injunction in the fall of 1989.
NutraSweet, a division of Monsanto Co. of St. Louis, appealed the
case to the Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the
lower court ruling in a decision issued earlier this month.
   NutraSweet spokesman Rich Nelson said the company is considering
appealing the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``We believe the use of color alone can be used as a tredemark,
just as other courts have found,'' Nelson said Wednesday.
   NutraSweet's lawsuit contended that the blue packets in which it
has packaged Equal since 1982 distinguish the aspartame sweetener
from other sugar substitutes such as Sweet 'N Low, which comes in
pink packets, and Sugar Twin, which is packaged in yellow.
   NutraSweet conceded the Sweet One's packets are not the same
shade of blue as Equal's, but said the color is ``confusingly
similar'' to Equal's.
   NutraSweet based its argument mainly on a 1985 federal appeals
court ruling from another circuit in a case involving Owens-Corning
Fiberglas Corp., maker of pink fiberglass insulation. In that case,
the court established a limited rule that in certain situations a
particular color could be registered as a trademark.
   In the NutraSweet decision, Senior District Judge John W.
Reynolds wrote that the general rule prohibiting registration of
color as a trademark ``should continue to be the law in this
circuit,'' partly because changing the law would result in
infringement actions ``that could soon degenerate into questions of
shade confusion'' similar to the NutraSweet case.
   ``How different do the colors have to be?'' Reynolds wrote.
``Under NutraSweet's proposed test, the only way to answer that
question is through litigation.''
   Officials of Stadt and Cumberland could not be reached Wednesday
for comment.
