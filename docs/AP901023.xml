<HEAD>Chief Fusion Research Nowhere To Be Found As Critical Review
Deadline Nears</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The University of Utah has another week to
persuade the state that it invested wisely in nuclear fusion but is
facing an unexpected snag: Its chief researcher, electrochemist B.
Stanley Pons, has vanished.
   Pons and British colleague Martin Fleischmann announced in March
1989 tat they had achieved a sustained nuclear fusion reaction in
a tabletop experiment. The announcement held out the prospect of a
cheap, safe and virtually inexhaustible source of energy.
   Despite extreme scientific skepticism that continues today, the
Legislature appropriated $5 million last fall to establish the
National Cold Fusion Institute at the school and to protect the
state's patent rights.
   University officials need to persuade the Fusion Energy Advisory
Council, which oversees the state's investment, by Nov. 1 that the
institute should be allowed to continue operating.
   Pons, a tenured professor and former chairman of the chemistry
department, has put his house in Salt Lake up for sale and his
telephone was disconnected Tuesday. The Deseret News quoted an
unidentified university source as saying Pons' family has moved out
of town.
   Hugo Rossi, dean of the university's College of Science, said he
doesn't know where Pons is, or what his plans are.
   ``Our understanding is that he has made satisfactory
arrangements for his teaching obligation this fall, and he will be
here to meet his obligation for winter quarter,'' Rossi said.
   James Brophy, the university's vice president of research, said
officials are expecting a formal letter outlining Pons' plans for
winter quarter. Last week, Brophy said Pons was visiting foreign
laboratories, a common practice for senior researchers.
   The state council is meeting Thursday to review the status of
the Pons-Fleischmann experiments and fusion patents over the last
year.
   Pons and Fleischmann said their experiments - involving
electrically charged platinum coils containing rods of palladium
immersed in deuterium-rich heavy water - produced 100 times the
energy needed to produce a reaction.
   ``We want to know where we stand on the program and what we have
to do in the future to preserve our position in this science,''
said council chairman Raymond L. Hixson. ``We have gone this far
with it. We had better be sure we are protected for future
developments.''
   Hixson said there is much information Pons and Fleischmann have
not released about their experiments, but he is sure they have
reasons for doing so. That information, however, will be critical
to the scientific review of the fusion institute, which was
supposed to get under way in August.
   Hixson said Pons' disappearance ``kind of muddles everything.''

   Leftist rebels on Tuesday
killed two children and wounded two other civilians in a botched
homemade mortar attack on the Defense Ministry compound.
   Two powerful mortar-type bombs fell at dusk about 175 yards
short of the sprawling military compound on a house in the
neighborhood of San Francisco.
   The bodies of Natalie Salazar, 9, and her brother Gerardo, an
adolescent about 16 years old, were found in the rubble of the big
house in the affluent neighborhood.
   Magdalena Salazar, identified by the authorities as the dead
children's mother, and Vilma Molina, their aunt, were taken from
the home in ambulances.
   Some neighbors said they believed the children had been visiting
from the United States and could have been U.S. citizens, but
embassy authorities said both the fatalities were Salvadorans.
   The attack came six days after similar homemade mortars were
used in an attack on the main air force base on the capital's
eastern edge.
   In that attack, rebels of the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front hit their target with the powerful homemade
artillery dubbed ``tepezcuintles,'' a native wild pig.
   The bombs are made of refillable propane gas containers filled
with explosive. Each one weighs about 40 pounds.
   Col. Mauricio Vargas, sub-chief of the joint chiefs of staff
that shares the compound with the Defense Ministry, was asked if
the target of the attack was the ministry.
   ``What should concern us is not what was the target, but the
result, the deaths of these children and the destruction,'' he
said.
   The bombs almost completely destroyed the home where the
casualties occurred and damaged the one next to it. Some walls were
left standing, but roof was collapsed in a pile of rubble, glass
and twisted reinforcement rods.

   The FBI's long-running probe of state
Capitol corruption resulted in indictments Tuesday against a
legislative aide and a former aide, and prosecutors cleared a
lawmaker of any involvement in the case.
   U.S. Attorney David Levi said no charges would be filed against
Assemblywoman Gwen Moore, D-Los Angeles, the author of
special-interest bills that figured prominently in the probe.
   Levi said the evidence, ``when viewed in its entirety,'' didn't
warrant any charges against Moore, who chairs the Assembly
Utilities and Commerce Committee.
   So far, eight people, including two former state senators, have
been charged in connection with the 5-year-old FBI probe, which
Levi said is continuing. In the sting, FBI agents posed as
businessmen offering money for legislative favors.
   A federal grand jury on Tuesday indicted Moore's former top
aide, Tyrone Netters, on nine counts, accusing him of racketeering,
bribery, extortion, conspiracy, money laundering and filing a false
income tax return, prosecutors said. Netters, who now works for the
Assembly Rules Committee, was placed on administrative leave
Tuesday, said Bob Connelly, the Assembly's chief administrative
officer.
   Darryl Freeman, a former Assembly aide and lobbyist, was
indicted on conspiracy and extortion charges.
   Moore, who has represented a Los Angeles area district since
1978, said Levi's announcement made Tuesday a ``happy day for me
and my family.''
   ``For more than two years I have fully and completely cooperated
with the FBI in its investigations,'' Moore said. ``I knew I had
done absolutely nothing wrong and today that was confirmed by the
U.S. attorney.''
   If convicted, Netters, 36, faces up to 163 years in prison and a
$3.2 million fine and Freeman, 43, up to 40 years in prison and a
$500,000 fine.
   The indictment also seeks repayment of nearly $15,000 that
Netters received from FBI undercover agents.
   So far, eight people, including two former state senators, have
been charged in connection with the 5-year-old FBI probe, which
Levi said is continuing. In the sting, FBI agents posed as
businessmen offering money for legislative favors.
   The investigation was revealed in August 1988 when about 30 FBI
agents raided the state Capitol, searching the offices of four
lawmakers - including Moore - and their aides.
   The former senators, Democrats Joseph Montoya of Whittier and
Paul Carpenter of Cypress, were convicted of corruption charges
earlier this year. Montoya is serving a 6{-year prison sentence.
Carpenter, now a member of a state tax board, is awaiting
sentencing.

   A convicted murderer apparently killed two
people Tuesday before traveling to a park where he fatally shot his
former girlfriend and himself over their broken relationship,
police said.
   ``We believe the suicide victim may be responsible for all the
deaths,'' Lt. Jack Putman said. ``We're working on tying all these
people together.''
   Lt. Ray Nelson identified the man who wielded the weapon as
Robert Lee Asberry, 39, of Tulsa.
   Police were investigating separately the park shootings and the
stabbing death of Cheryl Ann Butler, 27, when a detective heard one
witness describe a car seen at both slayings.
   Putman said Ms. Butler apparently was a friend of Brenda Joyce
Parks, 31, who died at an east Tulsa park of a gunshot wound as her
18-month-old son watched. Police later found Columbus Dumas, 38,
the boy's father, slain in his north Tulsa home.
   Lt. John Bowman said Asberry died of a gunshot wound to the
chest.
   Asberry was out on parole for a 1976 second-degree murder
conviction. He was convicted of killing Brenda Joyce Nelson, the
sister of the police lieutenant who described Tuesday's killings to
reporters.
   ``The bastard was the one who killed my sister in '75,'' Lt.
Nelson said.
   Ms. Nelson and Ms. Parks, who have the same first and middle
names, apparently didn't know each other, police said.
   At the park, witnesses and police said Ms. Parks and Asberry
talked briefly at a picnic table just yards from a nature trail and
tennis courts. Asberry then walked to his car and returned with an
automatic shotgun.
   ``I was over here playing tennis. The man just got the gun and
started shooting,'' said witness Thomas Park. ``The man shot the
lady first. I saw the lady drop onto the table. I just kind of
ducked.''
   The toddler was taken unharmed to a county shelter. He played
with a stuffed bear police provided while detectives investigated
the scene.

   Baseball made CBS No. 1 in the latest
ratings, but the short World Series cost the network millions in
lost advertising revenue.
   The Cincinnati Reds' four-game sweep of the Oakland A's last
week captured first, second, fifth and sixth place in television's
top 10, the A.C. Nielsen Co. reported Tuesday.
   But the World Series' failure to reach five, six or seven games
resulted in a loss that CBS would estimate only as ``less than $100
million.''
   CBS' average rating for the week was 15.9. NBC had a 13.9 and
ABC a 12.6. Each ratings point represents 931,000 homes.
   It was the second time in the 5-week-old season that CBS was in
first place.
   NBC continued to fare well by pitting female-oriented
programming against baseball. ``Danielle Steel's `Fine Things' ''
missed tying with Tuesday's opening game of the World Series by a
little more than two points.
   During the National League playoffs, NBC's ``Jackie Collins'
`Lucky-Chances' '' buried the game between the Reds and the
Pittsburgh Pirates on CBS.
   NBC's ``Cheers,'' which had been the No. 1 show since the season
began, fell to third place last week.
   Fox Broadcasting's ``The Simpsons'' fell 12 percent in its
ratings battle against ``The Cosby Show.'' The animated Fox family
received a 16.2. ``The Cosby Show'' got an 18.5 and was eighth for
the week.
   In the network news, ABC and Peter Jennings won again with a
9.9. NBC and Tom Brokaw and CBS and Dan Rather tied at 8.7.
   Here are the top 10 shows, their network and rating: ``World
Series Game 2,'' CBS, 21.8; ``World Series Game 4,'' CBS, 21.4;
``Cheers,'' NBC, 21.1; ``Monday Night Movies, `Danielle Steel's
`Kaleidoscope,' '' NBC, 20.3; ``World Series Game 1,'' CBS, 20.2;
``World Series Game 3,'' CBS, 19.4; ``A Different World,'' NBC,
19.3; ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC 18.5; ``America's Funniest People,''
ABC, 18.3; ``Movie of the Week, `Danielle Steel's `Fine Things,' ''
18.

   A man shot and killed a lawyer Tuesday in a
downtown office building and wounded two police officers, who then
returned fire and killed the gunman, police said.
   ``He was confronted by officers, who told him to drop the
weapon. He returned fire - he elected to do so for some unknown
reason - and the officers had no recourse but to return the fire,''
said Police Chief Frank Jordan.
   The shootings occurred on the sixth and third floors of te
James Flood Building on Market Street at about 1 p.m., police said.
   ``We don't know the motive at this time,'' said Deputy Police
Chief Frank Reed.
   The attorney was shot dead on the sixth floor. The others, all
shot on the third floor, were taken to Mission Emergency Hospital,
where the gunman died shortly before 2 p.m., Jordan said. The
identities of the dead weren't released.
   Officer Jim Jean was struck in the face by bullet fragments and
was expected to be released from the hospital Tuesday. Acting Lt.
John Madden was shot in the left knee and will need surgery, police
said.
   Kiersta Burke, who teaches Russian emigres at Jewish Vocational
Services on the sixth floor, said she and her students were
frightened by the gunfire and locked and then barricaded the door
of their office.
   ``We were very afraid that someone would break in and shoot us.
We were thinking about climbing down the fire escape, but most of
my students are elderly so I ruled that out,'' Burke said.
   ``I couldn't believe how many shots were heard.''

   Stacy McIntire and her visitors wanted
something with cheese and sauce, so they did the obvious thing at a
not-so-obvious place.
   They went out for pizza - at McDonald's.
   ``We had company over and we fed four people on two pizzas for
something like $12,'' she said. ``We went to the drive-through and
didn't even have to get out of the car. We got it in five
minutes.''
   Pizza, in the land of all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce,
cheese, pickles, onions and sesame-seed buns? Is this a fast-food
induced nightmare?
   Not at all. McDonald's, which for years counted its hamburger
sales in the billions, may soon be counting pizza, pasta and other
non-traditional offerings in an attempt to boost sluggish U.S.
dinner sales.
   Owensboro's four Golden Arches and 10 others across the Ohio
River in Evansville, Ind., are among 240 restaurants nationwide
which are test-marketing tomato pies. The 12-inch pies also are
being tested in Las Vegas; Hartford, Conn.; Fresno, Calif.; and
suburbs of Chicago.
   Fresh carrots and celery sticks are being test marketed in
Pennsylvania and California, and McDonald's also is experimenting
with fresh fruit and soups.
   ``Our customers are interested in a little more variety and more
choices,'' said Melissa Oakley, spokeswoman at McDonald's Corp.'s
Oak Brook, Ill., headquarters. ``But we have to be very careful in
what we choose. We're still committed to serving a limited menu.''
   McDonald's, held up by many as a model American corporation, has
long been committed to test marketing. Salads, the McDLT and
Chicken McNuggets made the grade; the Hulaburger, two slices of
cheese with a slice of grilled pineapple on a toasted bun, did not.
   Ms. Oakley noted that McDonald's tested salads for 10 years
before introducing them in all of its 8,500 U.S. restaurants.
   But Michael Mueller, a Montgomery Securities Inc. analyst who
specializes in restaurants, says McDonald's has reasons to press
ahead with pizza now - investors' complaints about the company's
recent U.S. sales growth.
   A pattern of progressively weaker domestic sales growth began in
1988 after peaking at 11.6 percent in 1987. A selloff of the
company's stock followed release of second quarter results showing
domestic sales of $6 billion for the first half of 1990, a
3.3-percent increase from the irst half of 1989.
   ``From their standpoint they have to do something to boost
dinner sales,'' Mueller said. ``This (pizza) is better than
nothing.''
   But is it better than Tony's, or Vito's, or Sal's?
   ``If you like pizza, it's just not right,'' said Elaine Lillpop
of Rockport, Ind. ``It's a hurry-up job.''
   She complained that the pepperoni pizza she bought in Owensboro
tasted burned and didn't have enough cheese. Her 8-year-old
daughter, Kari, said she didn't like it either.
   Gail Thompson of Owensboro said she won a free pizza and liked
it, but wouldn't buy another.
   ``I love pizza but I don't particularly like eating it in this
atmosphere,'' she said between bites of a burger. ``It's not fast
food to me.''
   That, says Mueller, is the problem. Pizza doesn't follow the
rules that helped make McDonald's the world's largest restaurant
chain.
   ``In the past they've been successful introducing products that
are cheap, easy to eat, and come with quick service at the
drive-through window,'' said the San Francisco-based analyst.
``Pizza is expensive, hard to eat in the car, and takes five
minutes or more to get.''
   Pizza also requires special ovens and is more difficult to make.
And there are lots of competitors already established in the pizza
market, Mueller said.
   Another restaurant analyst, Roy Burry of Kidder Peabody in New
York, acknowledged the problems. But he expressed confidence that
McDonald's would find a fast-food pizza that works.
   ``They've been on track for five or six years with this,'' he
said. ``It takes a long time to get it right, which of course they
will.''
   Pizza was a logical choice, Burry said. The demand for more
traditional fast food is not keeping pace with the number of new
restaurants, he said.
   ``Pizza is the only fast food product that's growing,'' he said.
``It's a mammoth market. It offers major potential for them.''
   Burry predicted the pizza might be ready for a national rollout
within two years. The test likely will be expanded to more markets
next year, he said.
   Ms. Oakley said McDonald's has not yet decided the product's
fate.
   She said pizza is doing ``very well,'' although the company
won't discuss sales figures. Pizza Hut, the largest pizza chain,
maintains that McDonald's holds only 2 percent of sales in the
Owensboro-Evansville market.
   Evansville workers said sales have been sporadic. A cheese pizza
recently sold there for $4.99. The Deluxe, with cheese, sausage,
pepperoni, green peppers, onion, tomato and mushrooms, sold for
$7.99. Some restaurants sell pizza only after 4 p.m.; some offer
quarter-pie slices for lunch.
   The Owensboro restaurants lure pizza buyers with glass windows
that allow customer to watch sausage and pepperoni being spread by
hand. But they don't see dough lovingly kneaded and tossed.
   McDonald's sacrificed fresh dough for frozen in its attempt to
make pizza a fast food. Some customers say the dough will be the
pizza's downfall.
   ``It tastes like cardboard,'' said 16-year-old Josh Hamburg of
Owensboro.

   More than 800 Saudi women volunteers
have graduated from first aid courses as part of the country's
Persian Gulf crisis mobilization.
   The graduates at Tuesday's ceremony donned the white coat. But
many had their heads covered with a veil, according to women
reporters who were allowed to attend the women-only ceremony.
   The course was conducted under a volunteer program, which has
drawn thousands of Saudi women since Iraq invaded neighboring
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Opening the door to women volunteers was a dramatic event in the
conservative Islamic society of Saudi Arabia.
   Princess Sultana al-Sudairi, the wife of Riyadh Governor Prince
Salman, was among those completing the course.
   The women wore abayas, or long cloaks, and veils over evening
dresses. They filed on stage to the tempo of Arabic music and the
cheers of relatives and friends.

<TEXT>
   The liberation of Eastern Europe has
stripped police of their greatest weapon - fear - and crime is
booming.
   People seldom tested police authority in the old days. They knew
every officer was empowered by the Communist authorities to
intimidate, beat or arrest anyone.
   Crime existed, but the streets were generally safe for all
except dissidents.
   When Communist parties fell from power, the prestige and
authority of police fell with them. Without the advantage of fear,
the forces of law and order seem unequal to high-tech criminals
emboldened by the new climate of freedom and the high profits of
dishonesty.
   ``When I started walking a beat a couple of years ago, all I had
to do was look hard at any suspicious character,'' said Joska, an
officer in his late 20s.
   ``When I'm off duty and walking around here now, I have be extra
sharp to make sure nobody picks my pocket.'' Joska, whose beat is
fashionable Vaci Street, would not give his full name.
   Hungarian police recorded a 38.8 percent increase in crime
during the first six months of 1990 compared with the same period
last year. In Budapest, 48,279 criminal cases were under
investigation, up 79.5 percent from a year earlier.
   Police in the predominantly rural Slovak republic of
Czechoslovakia reported a relatively modest 17 percent increase in
crime, but the growth rate was 52 percent among the urbanized
Czechs, with muggings up 250 percent in the first half of the year.
In Prague, crime went up 138 percent.
   One reason Bulgaria began rationing some goods was that black
marketeers were hijacking 70 percent of the shipments bound for
stores, the newspaper Duma reported in September.
   Poland reported a 69 percent increase in crime during the first
half of 1990 and a 12 percent higher murder rate - to 236 killings
in a nation of 37 million.
   In Romania, with a population of 23 million people, 886 murders
had been committed by the end of August, nearly double the number
in the first eight months of 1989.
   Both street and white-collar crime have increased in the Soviet
Union, where democratic change has been slowest.
   Embezzlement cases are twice as numerous as last year, said
Vyacheslav I. Runyshkov of the Interior Ministry, and investigators
found corruption in half the 160,000 state firms checked between
January and August.
   Sometimes, lack of respect leads to the humiliation of police.
   About 20 pickpockets routed Polish officers at Warsaw's huge
main railroad station in August.
   They sprayed some with a paralyzing gas and attacked others with
planks ripped from benches. One patrolman was hospitalized and
police managed to arrest only one person.
   Among recent victims of Bulgaria's brazen pickpockets was a
Greek police general relieved of his wallet in a Sofia department
store.
   In Prague, citizens conditioned by the image of police as the
enemy ganged up on several pursuing officers when a pickpocket
yelled: ``The police are after me.'' The suspect escaped.
   ``People must realize that, in a democracy, the police force
functions as a protective force and not an abuser of its powers,''
Vladimir Nikl, a Prague criminologist, told reporters. ``It must
not be treated as an enemy.''
   Technology is another problem. Criminals often have better
equipment than the police.
   Old Soviet-made Lada squad cars and walkie-talkies from the
early 1960s are no match for Mercedes, BMWs and the latest
electronics.
   Krokodil, the Soviet satirical weekly, devoted a cover page to
the unequal contest. It depicted policemen on bicycles, armed with
slingshots, pursuing gangsters firing submachine guns from a
Mercedes.
   Lt. Col. Janos Bodracka, head of the criminal investigations
unit in Budapest, said police could not expect financial help while
East European governments are trying to modernize their economies.
   ``If I gave you one of our radios, you couldn't talk to someone
10 meters away,'' he said. ``If one cop tries to warn another that
the suspect is about to leave, the damn thing is so lod it scares
the suspect away.
   ``I have 20 cars for 100 detectives and most of them cannot do
over 120 kilometers (70 miles) an hour. Western criminals can walk
in here and get away with murder.''
   Low pay exacerbates the grievances of bad image and outdated
equipment.
   Junior police officers in Warsaw are paid the equivalent of
about $115 a month, the pay in Hungary is $150 and the rates
elsewhere are no better. With inflation rapidly outstripping wages,
corruption is growing.
   Bright young people avoid the profession. In Warsaw, where the
police force has 9,500 officers and needs 4,000 more, only about
150 of this summer's 2,000 applicants met the requirements.
   Bodracka said the Budapest force of approximately 4,000 needs at
least 500 more officers, and even that would leave the city of 2
million understaffed by Western standards.
   ``Our strength is nearing an end, but the criminals are growing
more and more active,'' he said. ``Citizens have to realize that
the quiet days are over.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush's veto of civil rights
legislation hurts him with a constituency he yearns to attract, but
it helps him with voters who put him in the White House.
   That was the assessment Monday of Republican political
operatives who emphasized the importance of making it clear that
the president's opposition was to quotas, not to civil rights.
   ``The temptation to support a bill - any bill - simply because
its title includes the words `civil rights' is very strong,'' Bush
said in his veto message.
   ``But when our efforts, however well-intentioned, result in
quotas, equal opportunity is not advanced but thwarted,'' the
president added.
   ``I don't think it's going to play very well in the black
community,'' Republican former Gov. Thomas Kean of New Jersey said
of the quota argument.
   Kean, who got more than 60 percent of the black vote in his
landslide 1985 re-election campaign, said he believed Bush did what
he thought was right, ``although I'd like to have seen him sign
it.''
   The way the legislation was described by its proponents and
opponents defined the political issues.
   To supporters, it was civil rights legislation needed to nullify
six Supreme Court decisions that made it more difficult for women
and minorities to prove and win job discrimination suits. The
measure banned racial harassment in the workplace and allowed
punitive damages in the most serious discrimination cases.
   To opponents, the issue was quotas, not civil rights, and quotas
is a potent issue in American politics.
   ``Republicans are trying not to call it a civil rights bill,''
said Michele Davis, executive director of the Republican Governors'
Association. ``We've got to do a lot better job explaining what
this legislation does.''
   The key for Republicans is convincing people it is quota
legislation.
   The strength of that issue was seen in the race for governor of
California, where Republican Pete Wilson succeeded in portraying
Democrat Dianne Feinstein as advocating quotas in state hiring.
   ``It brought some Republicans home,'' said Davis.
   There were reports that Bush got conflicting advice from White
House aides, some arguing he should continue negotiations until he
could find a compromise, others urging a quick veto.
   Kean said he wished the president had found a way to negotiate a
compromise.
   ``What bothers me is, while the disagreements loomed large, they
are only over at most 10 to 20 percent of the bill,'' he said. At
the same time, Kean said, ``certain people in the political world
wanted a presidential veto more than they wanted a civil rights
bill.''
   Proponents of a veto argued that the president needed to avoid
furthering the image of indecisiveness created when he shifted his
position on whether he would accept a tax increase to help reduce
the federal budget deficit.
   ``Given where he is on the budget battle, the president is wise
to stick to his guns on quotas,'' said Roger Stone, a Republican
consultant who has been a strong advocate of the need for the GOP
to reach out to black voters.
   ``It (the veto) will anger a certain constituency,'' said Stone.
``It will also, if Bush continues to push his opposition to quotas,
help him with his base constituency.''
   Robert Teeter, a Republican pollster and adviser to Bush, said
it was essential that the president make it clear ``he's in favor
of civil rights.''
   Teeter noted that in recent polls Bush has received high marks
from more than 40 percent of blacks, a ranking that was far higher
than the 10 percent approval ratings President Reagan generally had
in the black community.
   But will a veto of civil rights legislation cause blacks to view
Bush as not that much different than Reagan?
   Teeter insisted that wouldn't happen.
   ``He is not, has not been, will not be perceived the same as
Reagan,'' said the pollster.
   As part of the Republican outreach effort, the GOP has three
blacks running for the House this year, all considered credible
candidates and all opposed to the bill on the ground it would
encourage establishment of quotas.
   During a debate Sunday night in Connecticut, Democratic former
Rep. Toby Moffett said it was a disgrace that his congressional
campaign opponent, Republican Gary Franks, opposed the bill.
   ``Do not talk to me about civil rights,'' said Franks, who is
black. ``I had a cross burned in front of my house'' when he was 9
years old.

<TEXT>
   A tough, new clean air bill is expected to
breeze through the House and Senate this week and be signed into
law by President Bush.
   A House-Senate conference committee approved the legislation
with only one dissenting voice on Monday. Democratic and Republican
leaders expressed confidence the measure will clear Congress,
probably Wednesday.
   The legislation, which is expected to cost the economy more than
$22 billion a year when all its provisions are in force, requires
new pollution controls on factories, thousands of businesses,
automobiles and electric power plants.
   Bush noted that it has been 13 years since federal air pollution
laws were revised and said, ``This Congress, this week, should send
me a clean air bill that I can sign.'' White House sources said
there did not appear to be anything in the measure that would keep
the president from signing it.
   A provision calling for $250 million in assistance to workers
who lose their jobs because of new air pollution controls had been
of concern to the administration. But modifications in the plan
during final negotiations early Monday appeared to have made the
measure acceptable to the White House.
   ``While we have to take a look at the final language, we are
encouraged by the agreement reached on (the jobs assistance)
amendment,'' said White House spokesman Steve Hart.
   The new pollution controls will affect not only huge
petrochemical plants, but also smaller businesses such as dry
cleaners, paint shops, furniture refinishers and operators of
fleets of automobiles. Automakers will have to intensify their push
to develop alternative-fuel cars and the oil companies must produce
cleaner burning fuels.
   In some regions, especially the indusrial Midwest, utilities
will have to find ways to cut sulfur dioxide emissions, which
causes acid rain, and may decide to do so by either switching to
low-sulfur coal or installing expensive ``scrubbers.'' Either way,
the costs likely will be passed on in form of higher electric
rates.
   As plants turn away from high-sulfur coal to fuel their
generators, it is expected that miners in such states as West
Virginia will be thrown out of work. That is why Rep. Robert Wise,
D-W.Va., pushed for the job-loss assistance provision in the bill.
   ``This bill touches virtually all Americans from and
environmental point of view and from an economic point of view,''
said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of the conference that
crafted the legislation.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., who headed the House negotiating
team, called the new legislation ``fair and reasonable.''
   Among the major requirements in the 700-page legislation:
   -Utilities must cut annual sulfur dioxide emissions by 10
million tons by the year 2001 to reduce acid rain, which kills
trees and aquatic life.
   -Automakers must slash tailpipe emissions by 30 to 60 percent
and provide more alternative-fuel cars for fleet operators and for
a limited pilot program for passenger cars in California.
   -Businesses such as dry cleaners must cut smog-producing
emissions.
   -Cleaner-burning gasoline, including ethanol blends, must be
sold in cities with the worst smog problems.
   -For the first time, industry must install control technology to
cut toxic chemical releases by 90 percent. Additional pollution
controls may be required to reduce cancer risks near plants in some
cases.
   House and Senate negotiators worked out agreement on the
legislation before dawn Monday and the conference committee
formally approved the measure in a voice vote later in the day.
Only Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif., opposed it.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, called the
legislation ``historic in its significance'' and said he expected
both the Senate and House to endorse it and Bush to sign it into
law.
   Republican members of the clean air conference, including Rep.
Norman Lent of New York and Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, also
predicted presidential approval.
   The White House estimates the legislation will cost the economy
$11 billion a year by 1995 and $22 billion to $25 billion annually
by 2005, when the bill's provisions take full effect.
   Industry estimates have put the annual cost in the $30
billion-$50 billion range toward the end of the decade, while
environmentalists maintain that any costs would be largely offset
by saving $50 billion now spent yearly for health care because of
dirty air.

   Congressional and White House budget
bargainers moved to the verge of a compromise late Monday on a
$250-billion deficit-reduction bill raising taxes on the wealthy
and cutting Medicare, participants said.
   Party leaders planned to present rank-and-file members Tuesday
with options for resolving remaining disputes over taxing the rich,
raising the gasoline tax and constraining Medicare spending, said
one Democrat who asked to not be identified.
   Democratic and Republican congressional leaders met privately
with Bush administration officials until after 11 p.m. Monday in
the Capitol. Afterward, none would say a bargain had been struck,
but many said good progress had been made.
   Asked if the two sides were on the brink of a budget deal, House
Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said ``I think so.''
   ``We're making progress,'' said Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine.
   Democrats were strongly considering dropping their call for a
surtax on millionaires. In the face of adamant opposition by
President Bush and Republican senators to a surtax on the rich,
Democrats were weighing a GOP alternative that would limit the
deductions millionaires can itemize on their income taxes.
   House Democratic leaders were sounding out their rank and file
to see how much support there was for that idea.
   With the two sides advancing otherwise similar proposals to
raise taxes on the wealthy, agreement on this matter would be a
major step toward completion of a $250 billion deficit-reduction
pact. Leaders would like to bring a compromise bill to the House
and Senate floors by midweek.
   Early in the day, Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., of the
tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee said he believed
Republicans and Democrats could work out a plan to raise taxes on
the wealthy.
   Later, he said some House Democrats were against the GOP plan to
limit deductions on the rich. Lawmakers from states with high local
taxes or where charitable contributions are high - suc as New York
and California - fear that the measure would hurt them
disproportionately.
   ``The question is can I pass it,'' Rostenkowski said. ``I don't
know. I lose too many (state) delegations.''
   On a day in which weary lawmakers spent hours waiting for
computers to analyze various tax proposals, gallows humor
prevailed.
   ``So far it's been very productive,'' Senate Minority Leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan., said early. ``We haven't met.''
   The legislation is aimed at cutting the federal deficit over
five years by taking action on two fronts:
   -Raising taxes, including levies on tobacco, alcohol, airline
tickets and such luxuries as furs and yachts.
   -Restraining spending, including money for student loans,
benefits for veterans and retired civil servants, agricultural
programs and dozens of other areas.
   Both sides have suggested raising the income-tax rate to 31
percent on the richest Americans, up from its current 28 percent.
They have also proposed limiting the deductions available to people
earning more than $100,000.
   Democrats want to also impose a 7.5 percent surtax on people
earning more than $1 million yearly.
   ``Ninety-five percent of this package essentially is demanding
serious sacrifice from everyone else, veterans, government
employees, working families,'' said House Budget Committee Chairman
Leon Panetta, D-Calif. ``We think it's fair to let millionaires pay
their fair share.''
   But GOP senators were ardently against the idea, arguing that
imposing a surtax on some taxpayers would invite boosts later on
for everyone. After days of bargaining, Democrats were considering
other plans, which House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.,
described as ``infinitely changeable.''
   The two sides were entertaining similar offers in other
unresolved areas.
   They seemed near agreeing that the 9-cent-per-gallon gasoline
tax would increase by a nickel or perhaps slightly more. And while
Democrats wanted to reduce the growth of Medicare by about $44
billion over the next five years, Republicans wanted to slash to be
about $3 billion deeper.
   But participants emphasized that nothing had been settled in
either of those areas. Democrats were saying the more taxes they
could raise from the wealthy, the milder the Medicare reductions
would be.
   ``M and M is still the problem, millionaires and Medicare,''
Panetta said.
   There were even hints that the gasoline tax might not be raised
at all.
   Rep. Dale Kildee, D-Mich., said Gephardt told him it would be
difficult for Democrats to achieve the 10 percent surtax on the
wealthy, but indicated it might be possible to leave the gasoline
tax alone.
   Last year, 65,000 families reported earning more than $1 million
on their income-tax returns. Boosting tax rates on the wealthiest
people would mean an increase for 600,000 families.
   Bargaining was also continuing over raising the $51,300 ceiling
below which the 1.45 percent Medicare tax is deducted from
paychecks. Democrats want to boost the cap to $125,000, Republicans
to $98,000.
   The bill, when completed, would be the cornerstone of $500
billion worth of savings over the next five years. The rest of the
deficit-cutting would come from restraining the defense budget in a
separate bill and from savings from projected payments on the
national debt.
   White House budget chief Richard Darman was in the Capitol
Monday participating in the talks. On Sunday, White House Chief of
Staff John Sununu and other administration officials left the
meetings, complaining that Democrats were not responding to GOP
offers. The meetings went on without them.

<HEAD>Bush Campaigns for GOP Candidates in New England</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: First event at 9 a.m. EDT; GOP breakfast in Burlington, Vt.;

   President Bush is escaping the battle of the
budget for a day to stump for Republican candidates in New England,
one of the most economically hard-pressed regions of the country.
   Bush planned to speak at fund-raisers for GOP candidates in
Burlington, Vt., Manchester, N.H., and in the Connecticut cities of
Waterbury and Stamford.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush's speeches
``will deal primarily with budgetary matters, but (will be) also
heavily aimed toward the local election that the president's
working for.''
   Bush likes to tell audiences that a good budget deal is the best
antidote to a lagging economy. New England's economy has lagged
more than most.
   After being the strongest during the Reagan years, the region's
economy is now one of the nation's weakest.
   Of the six New England states, the Democratic governors of
Vermont, Massachusetts and Connecticut all opted not to seek
re-election. The Republican governor of Rhode Island was running
far behind his Democratic challenger in the polls and the GOP
governor of Maine was in a tight race with his predecessor.
   Some economists have questioned the wisdom of a budget deal that
cuts spending and increases taxes - as both House and Senate
versions would do - just as the nation seems to be sliding into a
recession.
   Conventional economic wisdom is that the government should
stimulate the economy when it's weak.
   But the administration argues that a sound budget deal will help
the economy by driving interest rates down.
   ``We've got to put this nation back on the path to long-term
economic growth. And the way to do that is to get a budget through,
and that will bring the interest rates down and that will put more
and more Americans back to work where they belong,'' Bush said in a
recent political speech.
   Gone from either version of the $500 billion, five-year deficit
cutting package now before a House-Senate conference committee is
an earlier proposal that generated strong opposition in New
England.
   That was a 2-cent-a-gallon tax on heating oil that was part of
the package negotiated by the White House and congressional leaders
but rejected by the House.
   Bush's New England tour was postponed from two weeks ago, when
he canceled it to remain in Washington during an earlier stage of
the budget crisis.
   The president's first stop was a fund-raising breakfast for the
state GOP in Burlington, Vt. Former Gov. Richard Snelling is
favored to regain the office he gave up six years ago, which would
return Vermont to Republican control.
   Bush also was expected to put in a plug for Rep. Peter Smith,
the Republican incumbent, whose re-election bid is being challenged
by former Burlington Mayor Bernie Sanders, a Socialist.
   Bush also planned to speak at a fund-raising lunch for GOP
Senate candidate Rep. Robert C. Smith in Manchester, N.H.
   Smith was heavily favored to capture the Senate seat being
vacated by fellow conservative Gordon Humphrey. He is challenged by
former Democratic Sen. John Durkin.
   The president planned two campaign appearances in Connecticut.
The first was a reception in Waterbury for GOP House candidate Gary
Franks, who is running for the congressional seat being vacated by
GOP gubernatorial candidate John Rowland. The Democratic challenger
is former Rep. Toby Moffett.
   Moffett gave up his House seat to run unsuccessfully for the
Senate in 1982; he ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1986.
   Bush also was to speak at a fund-raising dinner for Rowland in
Stamford. Rowland is in a three-way race for governor. Former
Republican Sen. Lowell Weicker, running as an independent, is
leading in the polls while Democratic Rep. Bruce Morrison has been
trailing.

   Droves of Republican candidates are shunning
television ads of themselves with President Bush, and they've got
their reasons.
   They couldn't get to the White House for a taping. The quality
of the footage is bad. They don't have money to buy the TV time.
Endorsements don't work in their race.
   And, well, maybe it's not such a good idea to latch onto a guy
whose ratings are slipping. Who promoted a wildly unpopular budget
plan. Who's part of the Washington establishment that this year's
candidates love to hate.
   ``If something is radioactive, your natural inclination is to
stay away from it,'' said Craig Tufty, a spokesman for Rep. Fred
Grandy, R-Iowa. Is there a Bush endorsement in Grandy's future?
``We don't have one,'' said Tufty, ``and we don't plan on getting
one.''
   Bush has taped about 100 endorsement spots for Republican House,
Senate and gubernatorial candidates. But an Associated Press spot
check of campaigns across the country indicates few are finding
their way onto the airwaves.
   Many candidates seem to be taking their cue from freshman Rep.
Jim McCrery of Louisiana. He scrapped plans to show his ad with
Bush before the state's unique open primary on Oct. 6. Instead, he
ran ads against Bush's budget compromise.
   McCrery coasted to re-election 10 points ahead of a Democrat who
had been expected to give him trouble, and a winning strategy was
born.
   Bush has been welcomed and feted all over the country as a
cheerleader and fund-raiser for the same candidates who have vetoed
his on-air presence. The decision most often is explained
diplomatically.
   ``We've chosen to push John's agenda with our television ads,
rather than having the president do it for us,'' said John
Truscott, a spokesman for Michigan gubernatorial candidate John
Engler.
   ``We're concentrating on Wyoming issues rather than
Washington,'' was a comment typical of many campaigns.
   ``We'd like to keep our advertising focused on the candidate,''
was another.
   Some had other reasons. A spokesman for Wisconsin Gov. Tommy G.
Thompson said video footage of Bush's June trip there was of such
poor quality that it won't be aired. And Michigan state Rep. Dave
Camp, trying for an open House seat, couldn't make a taping
session. ``They wanted us in Washington the next day,'' said his
campaign manager, John Guzik.
   Several campaigns said they still don't know if they'll play
their Bush cards but they denied the president's ratings would
influence their decisions. John Hudgens, campaign manager for
Arkansas gubernatorial candidate Sheffield Nelson, was more blunt.
   ``If he's ranking high in the polls and very popular, that's one
thing,'' Hudgens said of Bush. ``But if he's dropping in the polls
it would be silly for us to throw him up there. His popularity is
an issue.''
   A couple of politicians have figured out how to exploit Bush's
support while at the same declaring their independence from him.
   Sen. Larry Pressler, for example, ran an ad incorporating film
of Bush complimenting the South Dakota senator during a Washington
fund-raiser. But the ad also includes Bush's comments that Pressler
doesn't always go along with the White House.
   And Rep. Al McCandless, running against Ralph ``Pa Walton''
Waite near Los Angeles, made an ad that says Bush supports him even
though he didn't support the president's budget deal. That's
followed by a White House tape of Bush saying nice things about
McCandless.
   That particular ad has not aired yet and may never, but
spokesman James Moore said any McCandless TV in the heavily
Republican district will include Bush's comments and the same type
of disclaimer. ``Unfortunately,'' he said, ``I think we have to.''
   Some candidates apparently feel Bush still is popular enough to
help them. Senate challenger Allen Kolstad of Montana and Nevada
gubernatorial candidate Jim Gallaway are using endorsement spots
with no caveats. The president has been on TV in Maine, site of his
beloved summer home, for Sen. William Cohen and House hopeful David
Emery.
   He's on the air in Nebraska, too.
   ``Sen. Jim Exon ... President Bush,'' says the announcer as the
screen shows photographs of the two men. ``Putting politics aside
and standing together and protecting our national security in the
Middle East and at home.''
   Exon certainly transcended politics in that ad. He's a Democrat.

<HEAD>Mensa, the IQ Society, Expands Behind the Iron Curtain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE RULE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The increasing intellectual freedom enjoyed
by Eastern Europeans has created a rush to join Mensa
International, the high IQ society, according to the group's
officials.
   After years of running into bureaucratic roadblocks, Mensa has
made inroads in several communist countries.
   Yugoslavia now has 950 Mensa members, Poland 900 and
Czechoslovakia 750, said Ed Vincent, executive director of Mensa.
The group also is evaluating tests taken by 350 Muscovites and
plans on testing several hundred people in Bucharest next week.
   Worldwide, the group has 97,000 members.
   Only people who test in the top two percent of the population
can join the society.
   Mensa's principles of free thinking and open exchange of ideas,
once considered unwelcome behind the Iron Curtain, has received a
warm welcome in the past two years, said Vincent, in Philadelphia
for Mensa's annual board of directors meeting.
   ``They examined us carefully,'' he said. ``Once they found we
were about intellectual pursuits and we were not politically
affiliated, they welcomed us.''
   For years, Mensa was unable to break through the many
bureaucratic layers set up by communist leaders, Vincent said.
   ``A lot of correspondence was mostly one way,'' he said.
Sometimes it would take six months to get a response from the
government in Moscow, and more often than not it was just a
referral to another government agency.
   ``But once the (political) changes began, the new governments
found little difficulty with us,'' he said.
   Most Eastern Europeans interested in joining Mensa are in their
20s, usually working at universities or training academies.
   ``They are more psychologically capable'' than older eastern
Europeans in seeking out Mensa, Vincent said.
   ``The past three generations have been restricted in making
choices all their lives,'' he said. ``A 52-year-old might be
interested in joining, but he might find it difficult to express
his desires.''
   Internationally, membership has grown from 72,000 in 1986 to
97,000 this year.

   George Romero, director of ``Night of the
Living Dead'' and other cult classics, has started shooting ``The
Dark Half,'' a film adapted from the Stephen King novel of the same
name.
   Shooting began last week at Washington &amp; Jefferson College in
western Pennsylvania, an area the director has favored in making
low-budget flicks.
   The $15 million Jekyll-and-Hyde story will be Romero's most
expensive film.
   In ``The Dark Half,'' Oscar-winner Timothy Hutton plays a
professor who can't sell his books under his own name but whose
horror novels written under a pseudonym become best sellers. The
pseudonym becomes a separate personality.
   The plot was inspired by King's own career. King has had success
under the name Richard Bachman, a pseudonym he adopted because his
publisher feared a glut of his material on the market would hurt
sales.

   LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) - Dudley Moore had to contend with a
piano that went clunk and another that wandered across the stage
during a benefit.
   The concert Sunday at California State University at Long Beach
was to help pay for $3,000 in repairs on a Steinway grand piano
and replace another valued at $50,000 that was destroyed when a
concert hall roof collapsed July 2.
   ``Hmmm. A broken string. This is actually a true Steinway,'' the
comic actor said of the piano borrowed for the benefit. ``I want
you all to think about this when you buy that new Steinway.''
   The star of such films as ``10'' and ``Arthur'' got another
piano from the wings, but it began to glide across the stage as he
played. He gazed at the crowd and said, ``I love playing on moments
of sheer panic and desperation.''
   The concert was expected to raise $15,000.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Athlete Bo Jackson, recording artists Heavy
D. and Al B. Sure! and ``Cosby'' star Malcolm-Jamal Warner will
make cameo appearances during a fantasy scene in Monday's episode
of the NBC series ``Fresh Prince.''
   The celebrities will appear at a Halloween party rapper Fresh
Prince fantasizes inviting them to. The show's producer, Quincy
Jones, and Kadeem Hardison of ``A Different World'' also will
appear.
   Guests on the one-hour special will donate their fees to the
dropout prevention program Cities in Schools.

   PADUCAH, Ky. (AP) - Sheriff Howard Walker Jr. could have sworn
he marched through Army basic training in 1969 with Vice President
Dan Quayle's cousin.
   But Quayle set the sheriff straight Monday.
   ``That cousin's me,'' the vice president told Walker at a
Republican fund-raiser.
   Walker said Quayle was a good friend in his platoon at Fort
Bragg, N.C., where Quayle trained before serving in the National
Guard.
   Through the years, Walker forgot Quayle's first name. When the
politician became famous, Walker assumed the vice president was a
relative of the Quayle he knew.
   ``When I went through the line, he recognized me, and it blew my
mind,'' Walker said.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - The woman whose voice sent police officers on
calls in the Martin Milner-Kent McCord TV series ``Adam-12'' has
retired from her job as a real-life dispatcher.
   Shaaron Cooper, 52, spent her last day at the Los Angeles Police
Department on Sunday after 30 years on the force.
   Ms. Cooper provided the voiceover introduction and radio calls
for the police drama during its 1968-75 run. She also worked on
``Dragnet,'' which ran from 1952 to 1970. Both series were created
by Jack Webb.
   Ms. Cooper was one of the best dispatchers in the department,
said Officer Don Lawrence. ``Officers were sending her messages all
day Sunday,'' he said.
   ---
   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Diana Muldaur of ``L.A. Law'' says the
wickedly insensitive lawyer she plays draws attention mainly
because she's a woman.
   ``If it were a man doing the same things, no one would blink,''
she said about the character, Rosalind Shays, in a recent
interview.
   ``In fact, it wouldn't even be good copy,'' said Muldaur, who
was nominated for an Emmy for best supporting actress. ``It goes on
every day.''
   Shays was ousted from the ``L.A. Law'' firm at the end of last
season. She resurfaced in the NBC series' season opener last week,
filing a $500,000 sex discrimination suit.

   The Persian Gulf crisis is putting
a severe strain on the tiny nations of the Caribbean, whose frail
economies and scant natural resources make them highly vulnerable
to higher oil prices.
   Except for Trinidad and Tobago, which produces just under 1
percent of the world's oil and stands to benefit from higher
prices, most of the developing nations of the region are heavily
dependent on foreign oil. Suriname and Barbados also produce some
oil but not enough for domestic demand.
   When the price of crude doubled to about $40 a barrel after Iraq
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, the ripple effects in the Caribbean
included higher food, utility and transportation costs.
   Dollars to pay interest on foreign debt also became more scarce.
   ``The prices have gone up at a time when we are struggling to
deal with very difficult economic problems,'' said Frank Abdulah,
deputy secretary-general of the 13-nation Caribbean Economic
Community, or Caricom. ``It has clearly taken its toll on the
Caribbean community.''
   Oil prices tumbled Monday below $29, but the long-term direction
remains unclear, analysts said.
   ``The current situation reminds us of how extremely vulnerable
our small nation is,'' Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley told
reporters recently. ``This has grave implications for the Jamaican
economy since we are completely dependent on imported oil.''
   Manley said the gulf crisis would affect all Jamaican economic
projections, including discussions with the International Monetary
Fund on Jamaica's $4.5 billion foreign debt.
   Another hard-hit country is the Dominican Republic, where
consumer prices were sharply raised in August under a government
plan to control runaway inflation. The program touched off
nationwide strikes and clashes between protesters and security
forces in which at least 60 people were killed.
   Unable to pay higher oil prices, the Dominican government cut
imports by 40 percent and introduced rationing, causing long gas
lines.
   The deteriorating situation prompted a flurry of media reports
about rumors of a possible coup against President Joaquin Balaguer,
the nation's blind, 84-year-old leader. Both the military and
Balaguer's Cabinet have strongly denied the existence of any
movement to overthrow the government.
   Balaguer told the nation recently ``there is a delicate
situation, not only in the Dominican Republic but all over the
world ... The only countries enjoying stability today are
oil-producing nations.''
   ``None of these mini-countries are politically strong enough ...
to weather serious economic adversity without remarkable
consequences,'' said Larry Birns, director of the Council on
Hemispheric Affairs, a Washington-based think tank.
   ``And these (consequences) could include replacement of
governments with opposition parties and, at the very worse,
military regimes.''
   In Guyana, one of the hemisphere's poorest nations, Prime
Minister Hamilton Green said higher fuel prices could exhaust
earnings from the country's main exports - sugar, rice and bauxite.
   ``For the bauxite industry we use a lot of ... fuel and diesel
for those huge kilns and this has had a very bad effect on the
economy,'' Green said in an interview. ``This whole thing has gone
out of kilter.''
   Elsewhere, Antigua has raised electricity rates and, according
to the monthly news magazine Caribbean Insight, at least one
shipping line operating in the British Virgin Islands has raised
cargo rates.
   Concern also has been raised about the possibility of higher air
fares, which could hurt tourism, the economic lifeblood of many
Caribbean islands.
   ``One would hope the duration of the Middle East crisis is
short-lived,'' said Luther Miller of the Barbados-based Caribbean
Tourism Organization. ``But hopefully it will be more expensive to
drive than to fly.''
   With substantial oil reserves, the twin-island nation of
Trinidad and Tobago, could reap a windfall. Industry Minister Bhoe
Tewarie said a sustained price increase of just $1 would pump $50
million a year into the treasury.
   But he said the government wanted to reduce its dependency on
oil wealth and had no plan to significantly increase production.
   Widespread poverty in Trinidad since the collapse of oil prices
in the early 1980s was cited by Moslem rebels who stormed
Parliament in August and staged an abortive coup and six-day
hostage siege.
   Rafeeuddin Ahmed, the U.N. undersecretary-general for
international economic and social affairs, said Monday that higher
oil prices ``will be an unbearable additional burden'' for some
Third World and Eastern European nations.
   The IMF is said to be studying ways to help developing nations
caught in the gulf squeeze, but is not expected to produce a new
round of lending.
   ``In the 1970s, the energy crisis caused over-borrowing and that
resulted in the debt crisis,'' said one financial source in
Washington, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``But borrowing
should not be a way out of this crisis. These countries are going
to have to bite the bullet and adjust their policies to reflect the
high cost of oil.''

<HEAD>Tower's `Boozer' Comment Livens Exon-Daub Race</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED HOWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It took a Texan to spice up Nebraska's
lackluster U.S. Senate campaign.
   The race between two-term Democratic Sen. Jim Exon and
Republican Hal Daub came to life when John Tower came to town.
   Tower, a former Texas senator, arrived to campaign for Daub
still nursing a grudge over the Senate's 1989 vote to reject his
nomination to be secretary of defense. Exon had opposed Tower's
nomination.
   ``Sen. Exon bore down on me heavily on the drinking thing when
he's got the reputation in Washington of being one of the two or
three biggest boozers in the Senate,'' Tower said.
   Exon denied the innuendo that he was a heavy drinker and said it
was typical of Daub's ``desperate, dirty tactics.'' But Daub's camp
said it had nothing to do with Tower's comments.
   ``If my opponent continues to harp on this so much I think he'll
be making it into an issue when in fact it is not our intention,
nor has it ever been our intention, that it be an issue,'' Daub
said.
   Democratic leaders said Tower's comments created a backlash
against Daub.
   And once the rumors about Exon had been raised, Daub's personal
life also came under scrutiny.
   Daub was asked about a 1978 incident in which he suffered a stab
wound in his home. Daub had said he fell and stabbed himself in the
arm but rumors of a domestic incident persisted.
   Daub, who served four terms in the U.S. House and ran
unsuccessfully for the Senate in 1988, was visibly miffed and
walked out of a news conference when the 1978 incident was raised.
   Exon, who insists he has never been drunk, said medication he
had taken years ago for gall bladder problems may have made him
appear tipsy.
   That prompted Daub to call on Exon to release his medical
records.
   Which prompted Exon to suggest that Daub should release his
``family records,'' a veiled reference to the domestic rumors.
   Democrats see the Tower incident as a sign of desperation on the
part of Daub, who trailed Exon in polls published before the Tower
remarks.
   ``Hal Daub is in the tenth round of a fight and he has lost nine
rounds, so he decided to bet everything on one of his patented low
blows,'' said Democratic State Chairman Mike Dugan.
   Daub refused to give the apology demanded by Exon, but said he
did regret Tower's remarks. If anything, Daub said, Exon should be
the one to apologize for his previous treatment of Tower. In
opposing Tower's nomination, Exon had cited Tower's past drinking
habits.
   ``Hal Daub didn't initiate this and, in a way, John Tower
didn't, either,'' said Daub spokesman Al Meyer.
   Before the Tower incident,Exon and Daub had campaigned on
issues such as agriculture, taxes and defense.
   Exon cited his congressional seniority and committee
assignments, including his chairmanship of an Armed Services
subcommittee important to the Bellevue-based Strategic Air Command.
He also stressed his role in stopping Denver's Two Forks Dam
project, work helping to keep rural air service for Nebraska and a
voting record that he said reflected Nebraska's values.
   Daub said President Bush needs Republican support in the Senate,
and Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle have visited Nebraska to
campaign for him. He depicts Exon as part of the old politics of
the Democratic Party, which Daub blames for the federal deficit and
other problems.
   Daub also has stressed his decision to refuse contributions from
political action committees, although he took more than $1 million
in PAC money in earlier campaigns. Daub said his brief political
layoff after being defeated by Sen. David Karnes in 1988 convinced
him that the PAC system was corrupting politics.
   Exon campaign manager Chuck Pallesen said Daub accepted money
from out-of-state Republican organizations that use loopholes to
get around the PAC laws while acting as PACs. Daub denied that and
said Exon's acceptance of PAC contributions was evidence of his
politics-of-the-past mentality.
   Each candidate's campaign reported spending about $1 million
this year as of Oct. 1. However, Daub entered the final weeks of
the campaign $32,000 in debt while Exon had $670,000 available.

<HEAD>Naval Investigators Said to Mishandle SexProbes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Navy investigators of rape and sexual assault
cases at a naval training center in Florida may have sexually
harassed the victims whose allegations they were investigating,
according to an internal report.
   The report by the Navy's inspector general said it appeared that
agents of the Naval Investigative Service, or NIS, needed better
training in how to interrogate sex crime victims.
   The NIS said in response that it was arranging more
``sensitivity training.''
   The report released Monday by the Department of the Navy said
investigations of sex crimes at the Orlando Naval Training Center
could be improved if the NIS used more women agents there. NIS said
it would do so, despite its fear of ``creating the perception that
certain assignments are `women's work.'''
   Navy inspectors who compiled the report on Orlando said they
were told by the company commanders of some rape and sexual assault
victims that the women were ``revictimized'' during questioning by
NIS agents. It did not elaborate on that point except to say that
the agents questioned the veracity of statements made by the
victims.
   ``There is a possibility ... that some victims may have recanted
statements to avoid further contact with NIS,'' the report said.
   Rep. Beverly Byron, D-Md., chairwoman of the House Armed
Services subcommittee on military personnel and compensation, said
the sheer number of cases at the Orlando center - 13 in a year and
a half - reflects a serious problem.
   ``Eight rape cases and no prosecution, five sexual assaults -
there's got to be a breakdown in leadership and oversight,'' she
said. ``If you had one case, maybe two - which are intolerable - it
wouldn't be as blatant as this many cases.''
   The report, written last July, said many company commanders at
the Orlando center use sexual harassment to intimidate recruits, a
condition that ``sends a strong signal to developing sailors that
such behavior is acceptable.''
   The Navy, which has come under fire on many fronts recently for
its treatment of women recruits and sailors, said it acted swiftly
to correct the problems at Orlando.
   The Navy inspector general's report said that eight rape and
five indecent assault cases were ``substantiated or resolved'' at
the Orlando training center in the 18 months ended June 30. None of
the rape cases was prosecuted.
   The Navy public affairs office at the Pentagon declined to
release an accompanying document explaining how each of the rape
and indecent assault cases was concluded. The inspector general's
report mentioned the outcome of just four cases: two were dropped
because the victims made false statements; one was dropped because
the victim refused to be cross-examined in a Navy investigation,
and another was dropped because the suspect was transferred from
Orlando.
   The office of Rear Admiral Louise Wilmot, commander of the
training center, released a statement saying, ``Every report of an
alleged incident is immediately investigated, but if there is
insufficient evidence the accused cannot be prosecuted.''
   The base statement said no instructors or supervisors were
involved in the alleged rape cases. ``In all cases, they were
classmates, acquaintances or peers,'' it said.
   The chief of education and training for the Navy, Vice Adm. John
S. Disher, wrote in a letter accompanying the inspector general's
report that the Orlando center had managed to cut down on incidents
of sexual harassment. ``Nevertheless ... this report indicates that
much more must be done in Orlando, within the Naval Education and
Training Center, and, presumably, throughout the entire Navy,''
Disher rote.
   The inspectors said they discovered that NIS agents are given
only a one-time training session on conducting interrogations of
sex crime victims, although they also receive ``rape awareness
training.''
   In response to the criticism of his agents, Rear Adm. Thomas
Brooks, director of NIS, wrote in a letter to Disher that his
office is trying to arrange for additional ``sensitivity training''
for interrogators. He pledged to personally assure that ``the
sensitivity issue'' is central to agents' training.

   A U.S. Marine with a fondness for
rock 'n' roll on the firing line isn't referring to a song. It's
the boom-boom-boom of cannon and rat-tat-tat of machine guns that
gets things moving.
   ``This is music to our ears, although other people get very
nervous when they hear it,'' said Col. James Fulks, operations and
training officer of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force.
   ``Anytime there's live fire, the Marines are going to be
excited. These guys are going to be so pumped, it'll take a week
for them to come back down,'' said Fulks, 44, peering through his
binoculars at targets down range.
   Marines did their shooting Monday on a practice range cleared on
the desolate wasteland in northeastern Saudi Arabia.
   After bulldozers carved out a line in the sand, Marines shooed
away Bedouins, camels and goats from their target zone and fired
the 25mm cannon and M-60 machine guns that are mounted on their
light armored vehicles.
   ``This is what we get paid for,'' said Cpl. Hugh Roop, 25. ``If
we're just sitting around, it doesn't make us feel that we're
earning our money.''
   The range this day belonged to Alpha Co. of the 1st Light
Infantry Battalion, which is based at Camp Pendleton, Calif.
Soldiers let loose barrage after barrage at 55-gallon drums and
other targets as far as 3,000 feet away.
   It was the first live-fire exercise for this company since it
arrived in August as part of Operation Desert Shield.
   The Marines routinely train in the desert back home, but the
harshness of Saudi sand takes some getting used to. Whenever
possible, soldiers sought shade under their vehicles and drank
copious amounts of water.
   At midday, the temperature hit 106 degrees. Inside the belly of
their armored scout vehicles, it was 20-30 degrees hotter for
soldiers outfitted with mandatory flak jackets.
   ``It's like an oven,'' said Cpl. Craig Smith, 22 of Lafayette,
Ind. ``But it's a lot better than walking, doing the humping
regular grunts do. I'd rather be riding.''
   Smith relished the action, even if it was practice.
   ``It breaks the monotony. We finally got a chance to go out and
bust some caps, break the pressure a little bit and release some
frustration,'' Smith said.
   As one way to battle the boredom, Marines with canteen cups
captured the little black scorpions that thrive in the Saudi
desert. Recently, they've been getting some recreation time at rear
areas: movies on VCRs, pool tables, reading material.
   They're also getting two hot meals a day and plenty of mail.
They take about three showers a week, including those jury-rigged
from water bottles.
   One enterprising sergeant even produced a container of Tang to
mix drinks for reporters.
   Marines who have been out in the desert for months had questions
of their own for the media:
   Are there Vietnam-type demonstrations back home? Does the public
support them? How long will they be here? What college football
team is number one? What are Saudi cities like? (All they see is
sand).
   ``It's important for us to know that people support us.
Otherwise, we'd feel like we were all alone,'' Roop said.

<HEAD>Long-Term Gain Outweighs Short-Term Pain, Economists Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Maynard Keynes might not approve, but
many private economists believe the Bush administration and
Congress are right in backing budget cuts and tax increases even in
the face of a possible recession.
   That view flies in the face of a major economic tenet advanced
by Keynes, who argued that cutting government spending and
increasing taxes is the wrong thing to do in economic hard times.
   Instead, the late British economist contended the government
should run deficits during recessions to prime the pump and
encourage a shrinking economy to start growing again.
   In the emerging budget deal, Congress would cut spending
throughout government, raise income taxes on the wealthy and hike
the federal gasoline tax - all in the name of shrinking the deficit
by $40 billion in the current budget year and by $500 billion over
the next five years.
   Economists who support this shock therapy concede that economic
growth, at least in the short-term, will be hurt by the tax hikes
and spending cuts, perhaps even making a mild recession slightly
worse.
   But they argue that the long-term benefits outweigh the
short-term pain.
   ``When things are this far out of kilter (with the budget
deficit soaring), the benefits of solving the underlying structural
problem outweigh the short-term damage,'' said David Wyss, senior
financial economist at DRI-McGraw Hill.
   However, supply-side critics of the effort charge that George
Bush is in danger of becoming a modern-day Herbert Hoover. That
Republican president preached the need for budgetary restraint as a
response to the worsening economic situation of the early 1930s.
   ``The deficit-cutters have a simplistic notion that if the
medicine doesn't taste good, then just swallow hard and you will
feel better in the morning. I don't think that is true,'' said John
Makin, an economist with the conservative American Enterprise
Institute.
   Supporters of the deficit package contend that the loss in
purchasing power from higher taxes and lower government spending
can be offset by lower interest rates engineered by the Federal
Reserve, whose chairman, Alan Greenspan, has given his blessing to
the deficit-cutting deal.
   In addition, supporters say the deficit deal has been crafted so
that the biggest tax and spending changes will occur in later
years, presumably when the economy will be better able to withstand
the changes.
   In the current budget year, the administration and Congress are
looking for only $40 billion in tax increases and spending cuts.
   This total likely will reduce economic growth, as measured by
the gross national product, by less than one-half percentage point
over the next year, analysts said.
   ``To the extent that it is contractionary, it is fairly easy for
the Fed to offset that and the longer term results of the package
will be expansionary,'' said Harvard economist Martin Feldstein,
who fell out of favor as President Reagan's chief economist when he
advocated tax increases to narrow the deficit.
   With economic growth already slowed to a near-standstill, even
analysts who support the deficit package believe it will worsen any
recession in the next year.
   ``There is no question that the deficit-cutting package will
slow the economy further, but that is the price we are paying for
letting the deficits reach these levels and not dealing with the
problem when the economy was stronger,'' said Lawrence Chimerine,
president of Radnor Consulting Services, an economic forecasting
firm.
   ``We are risking some economic pain and difficulty in the short
run, but our country needs to make the sacrifice in order to get
these deficits down,'' added Allen Sinai, chief economist of the
Boston Co.
   David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a
government securities dealer, said he believed it was a mistake to
count on the Fed's power to bail out the economy quickly with lower
interest rates, given the long lag times between changes in Fed
credit policies and their impact on spending and borrowing
decisions.
   Jones said he believed a recession, the first one in eight
years, began in August and could end up being fairly severe,
lasting until the end of 1991.

<HEAD>Welk's Home Town Getting Tourism Money From Farm Spending Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The birthplace of retired bandleader Lawrence
Welk is getting $500,000 in rural development money for tourism
from the $52.2 billion approved by the House for agriculture
appropriations this fiscal year.
   The spending bill, worked out by a House-Senate conference
committee and approved by voice vote Monday in the House, covers
most of the operations of the Agriculture Department and the Food
and Drug Administration.
   But special attention was given to the appropriation for Welk's
birthplace - Strasburg, N.D. - by Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass., who
opposed the spending.
   ``That's right, `Ah one, ah two, ah three, ah four, ah half a
million dollars,'' said Conte, mimicking the way Welk used to
direct his orchestra. ``What will they do for an encore? Earmark
funds to renovate Guy Lombardo's speedboat? Or restore Artie Shaw's
wedding tuxedo?''
   The money was included in the bill by the Senate to help
revitalize Strasburg, a 700-person community in south-central North
Dakota. But Conte and Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., both conference
committee members, went on record as opposing the Strasburg
appropriation before signing the compromise bill.
   The money is to be used by Welk Heritage Inc. and the Strasburg
Economic Development Corp. to renovate the Welk family home and
help build a motel and other facilities to accommodate the tourist
trade that is beginning to develop around the bandleader's former
residence.
   Many rural communities where farms have been consolidated over
the years, causing a loss of economic base, are looking to the
government for help to develop other businesses.
   About half the money in the bill, $27.6 billion, goes to feeding
programs, including $19 billion for food stamps and $2.5 billion
for the Women, Infant and Children program.
   Food donations, the special milk program and child nutrition
programs also are covered by the bill.
   The bill appropriates $5 billion for farm subsidies this year
and continues the crop insurance program, which had been stripped
from the original House bill.
   ``Since 1980, the (crop insurance) program has lost over $2.6
billion in indemnity payments,'' said Rep. Jamie Whitten, D-Miss.,
chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. ``The
administration in the past 10 years increased over $2 billion, an
increase of over 450 percent''
   But, at the urging of the Senate, Whitten agreed to allow the
program to continue if it is at least 75 percent actuarially sound
and if USDA's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service
takes control over policy sales and loss adjustments.
   The ASCS had controlled the program until 1980, when it was
expanded to allow private insurance companies to issue policies to
farmers. The practice became costly because the private companies
were reimbursed by the government for administrative expenses and
operating losses.
   Specific agencies and their appropriations are:
   -Farmers Home Administration, $11.5 billion
   -Rural Electrification Administration, $334.6 million.
   -Soil Conservation Service, $771.3 million.
   -Agriculture Stabilization and Conservation Service, $1.5
billion.
   -International programs, including food giveaways, $1.1 billion.
   -FDA, $824 million.

   Cattle being fed for the slaughter market as
of Oct. 1 in the seven major beef states totaled 7.68 million head,
up 10 percent from a year ago and 4 percent more than two years
ago, according to the Agriculture Department.
   Marketings of ``fed'' cattle in September totaled 1.45 million
head, down 8 percent from a year ago and 14 percent fewer than two
years ago, USDA said Monday.
   The placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last
month was reported at 2.21 million head, up 13 percent from a year
ago and slightly above the same month in 1988, the report said.
   State feedlot cttle inventories are listed here for the seven
states, which account for about three-fourths of the nation's beef.
The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as of Oct.
1, and the second number is the percentage of a year earlier.

   Two House Agriculture subcommittee chairmen
are opposing a Chicago Board of Trade plan to double the number of
grain and soybean futures contracts available to speculators.
   Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., said Monday that such changes should
not be made until the effects of the 1990 farm bill are known.
   The bill, which establishes new planting options as part of
government budget cutting, will dramatically change the commodities
market, said Glickman, chairman of the wheat, soybeans and feed
grains subcommittee.
   He and Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., whose subcommittee oversees
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, have asked the CFTC to
withhold approval of the Chicago Board of Trade plan until next
year.
   The farm bill has been approved by a House-Senate conference
committee, but awaits final votes in both chambers and the
president's signature.
   In a letter to CFTC Chairman Wendy Gramm, the chairmen said the
Chicago Board of Trade plan appears to be response to pressure from
big commodity trading fund managers.
   The funds ``have little interest in the price discovery or
legitimate hedging functions of these markets and view them simply
as another speculative venture to market to their customers,'' the
lawmakers wrote.
   ``We do not believe the commission should approve the proposal
until its proponents can verify with certainty that it will enhance
the performance of these markets and allay fears that it will
simply subject grain producers, marketers, and users to
unnecessary, damaging price fluctuations,'' they added.

   A white supremacist says a $12.5 million
verdict against himself and his followers over the slaying of a
black man will leave him broke - but free to preach violence
without fear of being sued again.
   A jury Monday found that Tom Metzger, a former grand dragon of
the Ku Klux Klan, and his White Aryan Resistance incited the
slaying by skinhead toughs.
   The jury ordered Metzger and his followers to pay the family of
Mulugeta Seraw the entire $12.5 million sought on its behalf by the
Southern Poverty Law Center of Montgomery, Ala.
   ``Back home, we say it cleans his plow,'' said Morris Dees, an
attorney for the law center. ``The first thing we're going to do is
send a moving van to his house so we can take it over.''
   Metzger, a 52-year-old TV repairman from Fallbrook, Calif., said
those responsible for the wrongful-death lawsuit made a ``fatal
mistake.''
   ``I'll be broke, and under the Constitution I can advocate
violence now and nobody can sue me anymore. So all the things I'm
accused of that I didn't do I can do now,'' he said.
   Seraw, a 27-year-old Ethiopian who planned to attend school in
Oregon, was attacked on the street in 1988. His head was split open
with a softball bat.
   The Multnomah County jury deliberated about five hours before
reaching the verdict on an 11-1 vote. Ten whites, a
Japanese-American and a Hawaiian served on the panel.
   The jury found that Metzger incited the slaying by sending a
follower to Portland to teach skinheads to commit violence against
minorities. Metzger, who was in California at the time, faced no
criminal charges in the case.
   Metzger was ordered to pay at least $5 million, his group $3
million, and his son John, 22, $1 million. Two skinheads who
pleaded guilty were assessed $500,000 each. It wasn't immediately
clear how the remaining $2.5 million was to be apportioned among
the defendants.
   ``This jury, I believe, has said there will be a new season for
justice in the Northwest and the hate and violence as preached by
Tom Metzger hopefully will be shut down forever,'' said Dees, who
had made no secret of his intent to bankrupt Metzger.
   Three years ago, Dees won a $7 million verdict that bankrupted a
Klan faction in Alabama. He had sued on behalf of the mother of a
19-year-old black man slain by two Klansmen.
   Metzger and his son represented themselves in the lawsuit.
   Dees and Metzger said Metzger doesn't have nearly enough money
to pay the judgment. Metzger said earlier that his family lives on
$1,200 a month.
   He said he probably will appeal.
   ``The white racist movement will not be stopped in a puny town
like Portland,'' he said. ``I think they (the plaintiffs) shot
themselves in the foot and as conditions change in the country, I
think you're going to see it.''
   Seraw's father, Seraw Tekuneh, who flew in from Ethiopia for the
trial, said through an interpreter, ``This is the happiest I feel
since my son died because I know he has not died in vain.''

   Increasing numbers of immigrants from Ireland,
Poland and Italy will be among 2.1 million people permitted to
enter the United States over the next three years under legislation
nearing final approval.
   Staff members in the Senate and House said Monday there were no
further obstacles and the bill was expected to pass in a few days.
   ``We have reached overall agreement on a substantial increase in
employment-sponsored immigration, expanded family-based
immigration, including an emphasis on immediate families, and a
permanent diversity program,'' said Rep. Bruce A. Morrison,
D-Conn., chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on
immigration.
   There will be a minimum of 48,000 immigrants from Ireland. An
additional 72,000 will come from 33 other countries which have been
able to send comparatively few people to the United States in
recent years. There were no specific numbers for Poland or Italy.
   This movement toward diversity will also favor people from
southern Asia. Additional immigrants are expected from South Korea
and Japan, although these countries are not specifically named in
the bill.
   The new law will also encourage Africans to come to the United
States for the first time of their own free will.
   Some 420,000 workers, professionals and members of their
immediate families will be admitted in the next three years because
they possess needed skills. Of these, 36,000 will be employees of
American companies in Hong Kong. Pressure for emigration is
increasing in the British colony as the time nears for it to be
turned over to China in 1997.
   Under present U.S. law, the total admitted on the basis of
skills would be only 162,000 for the three years. The increase was
due to pressure within the United States to compete with Australia,
Canada and other countries that have sought immigrants who would
boost their economies.
   The number of visas for non-refugees would be 700,000 a year for
three years. Of these, 465,000 would be relatives of people already
in the United States - the basis for nine of every 10 foreigners
recently admitted to live here.
   In 1995 and afterwards there would be 675,000 visas, including
480,000 for relatives. The number admitted to bring in additional
skills would continue at 140,000 a year.
   An annual 55,000 would be allowed in to maintain diversity of
origin, with no specific countries named. The new law would keep
the present annual limit of 20,000 per country of origin for
non-refugees. In recent years China, Mexico, the Philippines and
India have regularly reached this limit.
   Under a different provision, President Bush sets an annual
figure for the additional admittance of refugees: 131,000 for the
year that began Oct. 1, including 52,000 from East Asia and 50,000
from the Soviet Union.
   Last year, 1,090,000 foreigners were legally admitted to the
United States, according to the Immigration and Naturalization
Service. The figure was abnormally large because it included many
Mexicans and Central Americans who were already living here
illegally and were granted amnesty under a new law.

<HEAD>AIDS Money Bill Falls Short of Authorized Amount</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House is backing a spending bill that
provides money for new programs to combat AIDS but falls short of
the hefty amount approved earlier this year as the deadly disease
claimed the life of Ryan White.
   By a vote of 335-74 Monday, the House approved a $182 billion
appropriations bill for the departments of Labor, Education and
Health and Human Services for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
   The measure includes $226 million to partially fund a newly
authorized program to help cities and local governments deal with
the AIDS epidemic. But that was far less than the $875 million
authorized by a separate bill enacted earlier this year.
   That emergency AIDS treatment bill was dedicated in memory of
White, an Indiana teen-ager whose fight against the disease, which
he contracted from a blood transfusion, gained national attention.
   Overall, the bill is the second-largest appropriations measure
before Congress, behind only the Defense Department spending bill.
It must be approved by the Senate before being sent to President
Bush.
   The bill, $7 billion more than requested by the administration,
represents an increase of $22.6 billion in spending for the three
departments and related independent agencies.
   The measure retains the prohibition on the use of federal money
for abortions for poor women, except when the mother's life is in
danger.
   Abortion-rights advocates had hoped to add language expanding
that exception to include cases of rape and incest - a move that
prompted Bush to veto the bill a year ago when it passed the House
and Senate.
   But they were stymied when the Senate added language to that
provision that would have required parental notification before a
teen-age girl could obtain an abortion at any hospital or clinic
receiving federal money.
   Supporters of legal abortions decided to drop efforts to add the
money for rape-and-incest abortions rather than accept the parental
notification provision. Both provisions were removed in the
conference committee.
   In other action Monday, the House:
   -Voted to spend $52.2 billion on farming, nutrition and rural
development programs. By voice vote, the House accepted compromises
worked out by conferees on the appropriations bill that pays for
farm subsidies and most Agriculture Department functions, as well
as the Food and Drug Administration.
   -Approved, 343-67, a bill providing $20.9 billion for the
Treasury Department, U.S. Postal Service and offices of the
president. The bill provides all federal civilian employees -
except members of Congress, federal judges and the highest-ranking
officials in the executive branch - with a 4.1 percent pay raise.
   It also includes an overhaul of the federal pay system,
including provisions aimed at adjusting salaries to take into
account geographic differences in pay for private employees.
   In the Senate, meanwhile, a $15.5 billion foreign aid bill
became snagged in a dispute over whether the United States should
continue a policy that bars aid to international population
agencies that offer abortion as an option.
   Earlier, the Senate voted to give Israel at least $700 million
worth of U.S. weaponry. The aid was added to legislation that
already includes $3 billion in cash for Israel and several other
non-cash benefits worth hundreds of million more. Israel is the
largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid.

   In summer ready-to-wear shows by a raft of big
names from Chanel to Dior, loose jackets were emphasized over what
has become the obligatory tight body stocking.
   Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel put the house's old image to rest in
his show Monday. Except for piping, the quilt bag and pearls,
Coco's old standbys are gone. But Lagerfeld's quilted bags are made
of flashy leather, and he spruced the pearls up with colored beads.
   He topped hot pants, minis, bicycle tights and leggings with
every imaginable jacket, showing scoop necks or various lapels and
making it all work in hot shades and black-and-white.
   Lagerfeld found a new kind of piping in little squares - very
attractive in a cream shade of yellow leather on a jacket worn with
a circle-link gold belt and inevitable black stretch suit.
   Looser jackets almost floated in shades of peach or red over
tiny, knife-pleated skirts. And the loosening up was wonderful in
silly tucked nightshirt tunics over different-shaded leggings.
   Jean-Louis Scherrer again proved himself a master of wild-animal
prints. His tiny shorts, duster-style coats, lean pants and fitted
suits had the African imprint that he dressed up for evening wear
in sequins.
   The well-cut clothes had terrific cachet for all ages. Even the
fitted glen plaid jacket with its unmatched black-and-white fish
print crepe short skit could be worn around town by anybody.
   Gianfranco Ferre's collection for Dior looked both body-hugging
and loose, with floaty toppers over slim sheaths. Leading off with
a line of ochre prints, Ferre put plenty of care into the
collection, though it didn't always look quite on the mark.
   However, his billowy organza blouses were beautiful. And loose
silky tunics with split sides in appealing shades of pink and
apricot would be easy to wear at home, while the multicolored
lame-and-brocade figured silks had a certain Oriental splendor.
   Hanae Mori won praise for a young and sweet collection, starting
with wide trapeze beach coats printed with Japanese motifs. Her
leather suits revealing a bit of bosom with no blouse underneath
were daring for the Japanese doyenne of French fashion.
   Scottish-born Alistair Blair's first ready-to-wear collection
for the house of Balmain made little splash, though he showed a few
good ideas.
   Blair concentrated on classic casual looks in big pearl-buttoned
tunics and shirtwaist-style jackets, sometimes with sleeves
buttoned off or on.
   Sonia Rykiel offered a calm for the stressed-out fashion psyche
as she turned out her usual sophisticated line of wonderful knits
and sophisticated trouser-suit outfits.
   The favorite skirt line was a loose pullover and perhaps a
tunic, fitted around the little skirts. All were hip-hugging and
slightly bunched or draped.
   Meanwhile, Kenzo celebrated the 20th year of his house Sunday as
the first Japanese to set up shop here with a sensational show and
party in the School of Fine Arts.
   About halfway through the show, the stage was set up to look
like a Neapolitan street scene - complete with guitarists, an
ice-cream stand and cafe drinks for the models.
   Peppy innovations for women featured swirly, long-skirted
outfits worn with easy contrasting shirts, harking back to the late
1950s.
   A party lasting until the wee hours of Monday morning numbered
among its guests Paloma Picasso, model Ines de la Fressange on the
arm of Christian Lacroix, Angelo Tarlazzi and Issey Miyake.

<HEAD>Ethics Panel Considering Post-Election `Keating Five' Hearing</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Lead prospects uncertain</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Ethics Committee, already under
Republican fire for foot-dragging, is considering a mid-November
public hearing in the ``Keating Five'' cases that would delay any
decision until well after the Nov. 6 elections.
   If the committee took that course at a meeting today, one
Republican and four Democratic senators would remain under
investigation at election time for their assistance to savings and
loan figure Charles H. Keating Jr.
   Republicans on Monday demanded a swift, pre-election decision on
a special counsel's proposal that two of the five, including lone
Republican John McCain of Arizona, be dropped from the
investigation.
   Congressional sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the committee members have discussed the public hearing idea and
could decide on that course when the committee deliberates today.
It takes four votes to advance the investigation from the current
preliminary stage.
   Special counsel Robert S. Bennett has recommended that the
investigation continue against Democratic Sens. Alan Cranston of
California, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and Donald W. Riegle Jr. of
Michigan. He proposed that probes of McCain and Sen. John Glenn,
D-Ohio, be dropped.
   The committee is trying to determine whether there is a
connection between the five senators' intervention with banking
regulators for Keating, the former owner of the failed Lincoln
Savings and Loan Association, and the $1.3 million in political
donations they received from him and his associates.
   The Irvine, Calif.-based thrift was seized by the federal
government in April 1989 and it may cost taxpayers more than $2
billion to cover the losses.
   One source noted that senators will return in mid-November for
party organizational meetings and predicted a hearing would be held
at that time without any decision this week to advance or drop the
probe among any senator.
   The investigation took on partisan overtones on the Senate floor
Monday. Republicans complained bitterly that there were inexcusable
delays. Democrats countered that the GOP was selectively leaking
material that damaged Cranston, DeConcini and Riegle.
   McCain began the round of Republican complaints Monday,
contending that ``the process has a credibility problem'' because
the special counsel's report has been ``gathering dust ... for six
weeks.''
   He said there is a ``continued suspicion'' of an intentional
failure to act on the recommendation before the election. ``There
is far more at stake here than just my reputation; it is the
reputation of the United States Senate,'' he said.
   McCain made clear that he blamed Ethics Committee Chairman
Howell Heflin, D-Ala. and said the panel's vice chairman, Sen.
Warren Rudman, R-N.H., has tried unsuccessfully to move the
investigation along.
   But Heflin countered that senators had work conflicts that
delayed a ruling last week, and he charged there was ``an organized
campaign of leaks'' damaging to three Democratic senators, whom he
did not identify.
   Documents obtained last week by The Associated Press and others
showed that Cranston, DeConcini and Riegle had a much closer
relationship with Keating than they had previously acknowledged.
   Heflin said, ``It is interesting to note that the leak of
documents has been confined to three senators and that there has
been no leak of documents about the two other.''
   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, added, ``It
is ... particularly disturbing that the leaks have been limited to
accusations against members of the Democratic Party, although the
preliminary investigation now under way involves members of both
parties.''
   But Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas said, ``Here we are the
week of adjournment and two of our colleagues (McCain and Glenn)
have sort of been hung out to dry. I simply believe that it is time
to take action.''

   Republican Jim Edgar and Democrat Neil Hartigan
were neck and neck in fund-raising over the past three months in
their race for Illinois governor.
   Hartigan raised $2.2 million between July 1 and Oct. 7,
according to reports filed Monday with the State Board of Elections
by two Hartigan campaign finance committees.
   Edgar raised $2.3 million during the same period, according to a
report filed by his finance committee.
   Hartigan and Edgar have made this the most expensive Illinois
governor's contest. Outgoing Gov. James R. Thompson and his
opponent, former U.S. Sen. Adlai Stevenson, raised a total of about
$8.8 million in 1986.
   Hartigan had raised a total of $7.7 million as of Monday, and
Edgar had brought in more than $10 million, according to their

   Gov. Bob Martinez is calling ``blatantly
political'' a report that the Bush administration intervened to
delay a court motion on an Everglades pollution suit.
   Martinez said Monday he did not know of any attempt by the White
House to hold back a U.S. Justice Department motion that would ask
a federal judge to declare Florida in violation of its own
water-quality laws and hold the state responsible for damage to the
Everglades.
   Unidentified sources say the motion has been ready for five
weeks but was delayed because it could hurt Martinez's re-election
bid, the Orlando Sentinel said in a story published Sunday.
   ``The fact that nobody wants to step forward and give their name
clearly shows it's a political statement by someone who wants to
make a living out of lawsuits,'' said Martinez.
   ``My function as governor is to clean up the Everglades,
Okeechobee and Kissimmee. That's what I've been doing,'' said
Martinez, who has sought to portray himself as an environmentalist
in a tight re-election battle with Democrat Lawton Chiles.

   Sheriff Howard Walker Jr. could have sworn
he marched through basic training in 1969 with Vice President Dan
Quayle's cousin. Quayle set him straight Monday.
   ``That cousin's me,'' the vice president told Walker at a
Republican fund-raiser.
   Walker said Quayle was ``a good friend'' in his platoon at Fort
Bragg, N.C., where Quayle trained before serving in the National
Guard.
   Through the years, Walker forgot Quayle's first name. When the
politician became famous, Walker assumed he was a relative of the
Quayle he knew.
   ``When I went through the line, he recognized me, and it blew my
mind,'' Walker said.
   Quayle got a laugh when he told the story to workers at the
gaseous diffusion plant in Paducah.
   He said he figured it out after Walker mentioned serving with
his cousin.
   ``I said, `Well when did you serve?''' Quayle said. ``He said
`in the summer of 1969.
   ``I said, `Did you have Sgt. Maj. Davidson as a drill
instructor?''' That cinched it.
   Reporters quickly clamored for details of any Quayle high-jinks
during leave from the Army post.
   According to Walker, he and Quayle used their one weekend pass

<HEAD>Brady Joins Push Behind Amendment For Waiting Period</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Handgun control activist Sarah Brady
urged Florida voters to approve a constitutional amendment
requiring a three-day waiting period for the sale of handguns.
   Voters will decide on Nov. 6 if they want to add the provision
to the state constitution, which would make Florida the first state
with a constitutionally mandated waiting period.
   Mrs. Brady, the wife of former presidential press secretary
James Brady, has campaigned nationally for stricter gun control
laws since her husband was critically wounded in the 1981
assassination attempt on President Reagan.
   Supporters of Amendment Two said the provision would block the
sale of handguns to angry or depressed people. Coupled with the
immediate background check on handgun purchases the Florida
Department of Law Enforcement should have in place by early next
year, they said the amendment would also help limit the exportation
of weapons.

<HEAD>Advanced Fighter Program Restored by Conferees</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators on a military spending bill are at
odds with Congress' armed services committees over President Bush's
plan for full-scale development of the Air Force's Advanced
Tactical Fighter.
   House and Senate bargainers were still working out final aspects
of a $268 billion package for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1,
with hopes of formally submitting the legislation today.
   Earlier in the process, negotiators from the congressional
appropriations committees adopted several provisions that vastly
differ from a separate defense authorization bill worked out last
week by members of the Senate and House Armed Services committees.
   In that bill, lawmakers agreed to Bush's fiscal 1991 budget
request for full-scale development of the Advanced Tactical
Fighter, the aircraft intended to replace the Air Force's F-15.
   The administration sought $283 million for full-scale
development and $763 million to complete the demonstration and
validation phase of the prototype aircraft.
   The defense blueprint approved by House and Senate negotiators
last week provides $964 million for the program but prohibits
full-scale development this fiscal year. The bargainers stressed
the need for the Air Force to finish demonstrating several
technologies before beginning full-scale development.
   Negotiators on the spending bill agreed to the administration's
request for full-scale development, one year after expressing
concerns about the program.
   In his major aircraft review, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
announced his revised plans for the new fighter, which included
delaying purchases from 1994 to 1996. The Pentagon plans to buy 750
of the planes.
   Among the measures in the spending bill are a troop cut of
78,500 from the 2.1 million men and women in uniform worldwide,
just over $900 million for the MILSTAR communications satellite and
no restrictive language on the Strategic Defense Initiative
program.
   In the authorization bill that sets ceilings for military
spending, conferees last week approved a troop cut of 100,000 and
agreed to $600 million for MILSTAR. The negotiators also adopted
language that limits spending on accounts within the SDI program,
thus delaying early deployment of the antimissile system.
   Congress is expected to approve the spending and authorization
bills this week and send them to Bush.
   However, the authorization bill faces a veto threat.
   Shortly after the package was announced, Cheney signaled he
would recommend that Bush veto the bill. Pentagon officials
complained about the size of the troop cut, the restrictive
language on SDI and the wording on a base-closure measure.
   Congressional aides and Pentagon officials worked throughout the
weekend and Monday to modify the provisions to make them more
acceptable to the administration.
   A Defense Department official, who requested anonymity, said
that some of the issues ``are moving toward resolution in a ay we
would like. We're still leaning out there with a possibility of a
veto.''

<HEAD>Killer Bee Invasion Believed Thwarted Until the Spring</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARLINGEN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists believe they have turned back
the first U.S. invasion of killer bees but expect a new offensive
in the spring.
   Authorities Monday had not confirmed any new swarms in the week
since they trapped the first of the Africanized killer bees that
crossed into the United States from Mexico.
   ``I'm going on the assumption that we won't find another swarm''
until spring, said Elba Quintero, area honey bee program manager
for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service.
   ``The weather is getting colder and bees do not normally move in
winter time.''
   USDA teams on Friday started a search for bees within two miles
of where the first swarm of 3,000 was found and destroyed, near the
city of Hidalgo. They are taking samples of all managed and wild
bee colonies in the area.
   U.S. and Mexican officials in the past three years had placed
hundreds of traps baited with a sex lure to track the bees, which
have been moving slowly north since 1957, when they escaped from a
breeding experiment in Brazil.
   Killer bees earned their nickname because of their habit of
attacking intruders in swarms and chasing their prey for long
distances.
   Beekeepers and farmers fear the killer bees will take over
domestic hives and reduce honey production and pollination of
important crops.
   The swarm last week prompted a quarantine on movement of bees
out of the two-mile radius where the killer variety was found. The
quarantine also prohibits movement of bees from Texas' eight
southernmost counties.
   USDA trapped two swarms during the weekend along the Rio Grande
less than a mile from where the Africanized swarm was caught, but
the bees probably are not Africanized, Ms. Quintero said. Test
results were expected today.
   To the naked eye, Africanized bees are impossible to distinguish
from the more docile European bees commonly raised in the Americas.

   Conrail has demanded that an arbitrator decide
whether the Delaware &amp; Hudson Railway has the right to use its own
trains and crews on a brief stretch of Conrail tracks between
Buffalo and Niagara Falls, N.Y.
   The Consolidated Rail Corp. called for binding arbitration in
legal papers served late Monday. The action came hours after a
special regional rail reorganization court denied Conrail's request
to hear the trackage case.
   In the meantime, the issue will be reviewed by the bankruptcy
judge in Wilmington, Del., who has been overseeing the D&amp;H
reorganization.
   The approximately 15-mile stretch is key to a $25 million offer
by Canadian Pacific Ltd. to buy the ailing D&amp;H. Without access to
the Buffalo-Niagara Gateway, CP would be unable to connect the D&amp;H
with its own lines in southern Ontario.
   Canadian Pacific hopes to use the D&amp;H system to connect the
ports of Philadelphia and New York with the Canadian interior. If
CP can put the pieces together, it will be compete directly with
Conrail for freight in the Northeast.

   The group wants each of the nation's 175 accredited law schools

<HEAD>Senate Votes $700 Million in New Weaponry for Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel, already the top recipient of U.S.
foreign aid, would be given at least $700 million worth of American
arms under an addition approved by the Senate with only a single
dissenting vote.
   The Senate voted 97-1 Monday to add the weaponry to a $15.5
billion foreign aid bill that already includes $3 billion in cash
for Israel and several other non-cash benefits worth hundreds of
millions more.
   However, the overall bill is subject to further debate in the
Senate and its provisions also would have to be agreed to by the
House before going to President Bush.
   The aid would come primarily from equipment being withdrawn from
Europe as East-West tensions ease, and must be committed within
nine months unless doing so would jeopardize the readiness of U.S.
forces.
   The sponsors, Sens. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, and Robert Kasten,
R-Wis., contended that the help was needed to counter the threat of
an attack on Israel by Iraq.
   ``The best interest of this country is served by assuring the
viability of Israel,'' Inouye said, citing that country's free
sharing of Middle Eastern intelligence with the United States. ``It
is the best ally we have.''
   But Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., the only senator to oppose the
aid, countered that ``the United States is not a bottomless pit of
aid money.''
   ``No one can say this amendment should be passed because we have
not done enough for Israel,'' said Byrd, who chairs the Senate
Appropriations Committee.
   Byrd criticized what he said was the ``fake psychology'' that
any lawmaker who votes against a new benefit for Tel Aviv is an
enemy of Israel. ``That attitude has been used to considerable
advantage around here for years,'' he complained.
   The new Israeli aid, which Inouye characterized as a message of
support, was an apparent attempt to counterbalance new aid to two
Arab countries: $6.7 billion in debt forgiveness for Egypt and a
$7.5 billion weapons sale to Saudi Arabia.
   In addition to Israel's $1.8 billion in military and $1.2
billion in economic aid, the bill earmarks $2.1 billion for Egypt,
$72 million for Morocco, $382 million for Greece and $545 million
for Turkey.
   The measure became snagged later Monday in a dispute over
whether the United States should continue a policy that bars aid to
international population agencies that offer abortion as an option.
   Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., pressed an amendment that would remove
the United States from a list of countries that signed the policy
in 1984. Sens. William Armstrong, R-Colo., and Gordon Humphrey,
R-N.H., threatened a filibuster over the proposal.

<HEAD>Lab Study Shows Cocaine Increases Growth of AIDS Virus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers say cocaine has been found to speed
the growth of the AIDS virus in the test tube, prompting concern it
could do the same in drug users.
   Researchers with the University of Minnesota Medical School at
Minneapolis took peripheral blood mononuclear cells and exposed
them to doses of cocaine. The cells are a primary target for the
AIDS virus.
   The virus was found to grow as much as three times faster in the
cocaine-laced tests.
   ``In persons who are infected, if they continue to abuse this
drug it may have a significant impact on the development of
clinical AIDS,'' said Dr. Ronald Schut.
   Schut presented the findings at the Interscience Conference on
Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, sponsored by the American
Society for Microbiology.
   While about 150,000 AIDS cases have been reported in the United
States, researchers say an additional million or more Americans are
infected and at risk of developing AIDS.
   The question now for researchers is whether drug use somehow
modifies the immune system to enhance growth of the AIDS, or HIV,
virus.
   ``The initial in-vitro (test-tube) studies suggest that it's
possible,'' Schut said.
   Dr. James Curran, director of the Division of HIV-AIDS at the
Centers for Disease Control, said little if any solid information
is available on the risk AIDS poses cocaine users. He said drug
users are notoriously difficult to study.
   However, as far as cocaine is concerned, Curran said, ``I think
it's safe to recommend don't do it.''
   Further studies are under way using immune cells from drug users
in a methadone program, where cocaine use is high, to see if the
virus grows more easily, Schut said.
   Also at the conference, doctors from Los Angeles' Kaiser
Permanente Medical Center reported that low doses of a common
antibiotic can prevent a life-threatening complication in AIDS
patients, pneumocystis pneumonia, at much lower cost than the
widely recommended aerosol pentamidine.
   Thrice weekly tablets of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, which is
used frequently for mild bacterial infections, prevented
pneumocystis pneumonia in 116 high-risk patients for two years, Dr.
Joel Ruskin reported.
   That drug can cost as little as $12 a year, while aerosol
pentamidine can cost hundreds, the doctors said.

   The fifth game of the world championship chess
match between Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov ended in a draw,
enabling Kasparov to keep his one-point lead in the series.
   The game ended Monday night with Karpov offering the defending
champion a draw after his 36th move. Each player got a half point,
leaving the score 3 to 2. Game 6 will be Wednesday.
   The first player to reach 12{ points in the 24-game series will
win the championship. Kasparov, who dethroned Karpov in 1985, got a
full point for his victory in the second game. The three other
games were draws.
   On the 10th move, Karpov forced the exchange of his queen for
Kasparov's queen, which many grandmasters thought was an attempt by
Karpov to play for a draw rather than a win.
   When queens are traded off early in a game, this often reduces
the chances of an overwhelming attack by either player. It also
increases the boredom.
   ``This is the most boring game they ever played,'' said
grandmaster Roman Dzindzichashvili of New York City.
   International master Vitaly Zaltsman of New York City said of
Karpov, ``This guy is chicken. He has no fighting spirit.''
   The first 12 games are being played in New York and the rest
will be played in Lyon, France. The winner will receive $1.7
million and the loser $1.3 million.

25,070.86-point close. Trading volume was moderately heavy at 550
million shares after the market opened higher at 25,279.10 points.
   The price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year government bonds rose
to 84.92 points from their previous close of 84.75 points on
Monday. Their yield dropped to 7.710 percent from 7.750 percent.
   Tuesday's higher stock market close was the seventh consecutive
rise in a recovery that began after an extended bear market. The
Nikkei average fell to a two-year low of 20,221.86 points on Oct.
1.
   The cheaper yen was one strong influence, said Yoshiro Inoue, an
analyst for Nomura Securities.
   Traders also said lower interest rates, falling crude oil prices
and hope for a negotiated settlement in the Middle East helped buoy
stock trading.
   ``The market has changed in the last two weeks,'' said Hidetada
Yoshida, a trader for Kidder Peabody International Corp. ``Japanese
investors and foreign investors have found the bottom of the Tokyo
market.''
   But profit-taking might depress any dramatic market rise, he
said.
   The dollar has been edging up slowly against the yen since
Friday. On Monday, the dollar gained 1.0 yen after falling 13.55
yen in the 13 previous trading days.
   But market observers foresee no radical move toward dollar
buying.
   ``There are very few elements in the market to cause big
changes,'' said a dealer at Sanwa Bank, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The dollar has gained back some lost ground partly because its
drop had been too rapid, he said.

<TEXT>
   The conservatives retained control of
Greece's second-largest city in weekend mayoral elections, but a
socialist-communist coalition captured major provincial centers.
   In the northern city of Salonica, Mayor Constantine Cosmopoulos
of the conservative New Democracy party edged out Dimitris
Fatouros, candidate of the socialists and communist-dominated
Coalition of the Left and Progress.
   Final results released Monday by the Interior Ministry showed
that Cosmopoulos received 50.91 percent of the vote to 49.09
percent for Fatouros.
   The hard-fought race in the key industrial city was considered a
gauge of political sentiment for the national New Democracy-led
administration, which was buffeted by five nationwide walkouts in
September.
   The strikes were in protest of tough austerity measures
implemented by the 6-month-old government to slash state spending
and offset $10 billion in debts.
   The first round of mayoral elections was held on Oct. 14, with
215 towns and cities involved. On Sunday, runoffs were held in 143
municipalties.
   Final results indicated that many leftist voters failed to toe
the party line, especially in Athens, Salonica and in provincial
areas considered socialist-leftist strongholds.
   But candidates supported by the socialist-communist coalition
took the next three biggest cities in the country - Piraeus near
the capital, Patras in the southwest and Iraklion, on the island of
Crete.
   On Oct. 14, the New Democracy-supported candidate in Athens,
former socialist minister Antonis Tritsis, edged out popular
socialist parliamentarian Melina Mercouri.
   Former Premier Andreas Papandreou, who heads the socialist
Panhellenic Socialist Movement, claimed the conservatives lost 4
percent of their strength overall and called on his party to
prepare for new general elections.
   Premier Constantine Mitsotakis dismissed the claims. He said New
Democracy-backed candidates made major inroads by unseating 20
leftist mayors on Oct. 14 and significant gains in some provincial
areas on Sunday.

   Carrying a child does not make a woman
a parent, a judge ruled in awarding a test-tube baby to the boy's
genetic parents instead of the surrogate they hired for $10,000.
   Civil rights advocates and ethicists charged that the ruling
Monday by Superior Court Judge Richard Parslow ignores the law and
creates a ``breeder class'' of women.
   ``The judge is saying gestation doesn't count, it counts for
nothing, and I think that is a very disturbing outcome,'' said
Susan M. Wolf, an associate for law at the Hastings Center, an
ethics research institute in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.
   In giving custody of the 5-week-old boy to Mark and Crispina
Calvert instead of surrogate mother Anna Johnson, the judge said,
``A surrogate carrying a genetic child for a couple does not
acquire parental rights.''
   Parslow said Ms. Johnson made a ``substantial contribution'' in
giving birth to the child. But her relationship to the baby was
like a foster parent who takes a child in when the parent can't,
the judge said.
   ``I think a three-parent, two-natural mom claim in a situation
is ripe for crazy-making,'' he said. ``I decline to split this
child emotionally between two mothers.''
   The decision upholds a contract under which the Calverts agreed
to pay Ms. Johnson to carry an embryo created from the couple's
sperm and egg. A hysterectomy prevents Mrs. Calvert, 36, from
carrying a baby.
   ``We are entering into very dangerous times if we allow the
creation of a breeder class of women whose parental rights can be
signed away in a business deal,'' said Ramona Ripston, executive
director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern
California. The ACLU had urged the judge to rule all three adults
were legitimate parents.
   The ruling is a ``radical departure from the pre-existing law,''
said Ms. Wolf said.
   Attorneys had said the dispute could break legal ground because
a genetically unrelated surrogate never had sought custody. New
Jersey's Baby M case involved a surrogate who was also the baby's
genetic mother.
   In that case, a New Jersey court awarded custody to the father
and his wife but ruled that surrogate mother Mary Beth Whitehead
also had parental rights.
   Ms. Johnson, 29, of Mission Viejo, described herself as
``heartbroken'' over the ruling and said she would appeal to the
Supreme Court, if necessary, to gain shared custody.
   ``I'm in a deep state of mourning for my son. He's going to be
very confused. He's going to be looking for me,'' she said.
   Ms. Johnson was ordered to stop her twice-a-week visits to the
baby, who was in the Calverts' care since shortly after his Sept.
19 birth.
   ``I just held him close to me, let him nuzzle up into my
shoulder and whispered in his ear that mommy's trying her hardest
to get him back,'' she said.
   ``This is a glorious day,'' said Calvert, 34. Referring to Ms.
Johnson's argument that she had developed a bond with the infant,
he said, ``The only bonding Anna Johnson has is with your
television cameras.''
   Christopher Michael Calvert will be the name entered on the
child's birth certificate, which was held up by the dispute, the
father said.
   The judge said that Ms. Johnson signed the $10,000 contract
knowing she was to give the child to the Calverts. They have paid
her $5,000 so far.
   He also found that surrogate contracts in in-vitro fertilization
cases ``are not void or in violation or public policy,'' and he
predicted the ``hunger'' by childless couples for their own
children would spur more people to pursue similar arrangements.

<HEAD>Lincoln's Cracked Sidewalks - Who Shall Pay?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By J.L. SCHMIDT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Across the country, voters are said to be
on the brink of revolt over rising taxs, politicians who don't
lead, schools that don't teach.
   Here in Lincoln, it's cracked sidewalks.
   Residents of this city, which is in the midst of a six-year
crackdown on cracks, go to the polls Nov. 6 to consider two
proposed city charter amendments dealing with who should pay for
city-ordered repairs: the city, or homeowners.
   One ballot question asks voters whether the city should pay. A
second seeks reimbursement to property owners for repairs made
since April 10, 1989, when the sidewalk improvement campaign began.
   The questions got on the ballot after Allen Boettcher, a retired
extension agent, and 150 other volunteers collected the 3,000
signatures needed to give voters a say in who pays.
   ``Everybody uses the sidewalks, but only property owners have to
pay for the repairs,'' said Boettcher. ``That's the great
injustice.''
   Sidewalk inspectors fanned out through the capital city's
neighborhoods in April 1989, armed with cans of orange spray paint
to circle cracks and raised edges.
   The goal was to inspect and require repairs on all unsafe and
broken sidewalks over a six-year period. To date, the city has
ordered repairs on about 7,800 properties and new sidewalks for an
additional 300.
   The City Council hoped to make sidewalks safer for people in
wheelchairs, the elderly, children, runners and walkers.
   But Boettcher said some homeowners have been forced to pay two
or three times their city property taxes to have the sidewalks
fixed.
   Refunds could cost the city between $800,000 and $900,000, city
engineer Rich Robinson said.
   He said that the city has to pay $40 to $48 to hire a contractor
to build a 4-by-4-foot sidewalk section and that property owners
may be able to get the work done cheaper.
   City Attorney Bill Austin has suggested he will recommend legal
challenges if voters approve the measures.
   Regardless of the outcome at the ballot box, Boettcher has
caught the attention of Mayor Bill Harris, who has formed a
committee of public officials and residents, including Boettcher,
to review the sidewalk repair campaign.
   The campaign replaced a random program that required the filing
of complaints about unsafe sidewalks to the Public Works
Department.
   ``People think we have a new sidewalk policy and they have to
pay for their sidewalks,'' said Linda Wilson, a City Council
member. ``But that's always been the case.''
   Councilman Ken Haar said passage of the measures could force the
city to back down on its policy of requiring repairs.
   Boettcher, who has had to repair one sidewalk section near his
home, said he supports repairs, as long as the city pays for them.
   ``It's the most basic part of the city's transportation
system,'' he said, adding that the city pays for streets, trails
and parks.

<HEAD>Defection Of Hindu Fundamentalist Party Threatens Singh Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARLEEN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A right-wing Hindu party withdrew its
support for Prime Minister V.P. Singh's government today,
threatening to bring down the fragile coalition that has governed
India for the past 10 months.
   Singh refused to resign and said he would take the battle to
floor of Parliament, where his centrist National Front government
had relied on the votes of the Hindu fundamentalist Bharatiya
Janata Party to survive.
   The crisis was precipitated by the arrest earlier Tuesday of
Bharatiya Janata's president, Lal Krishna Advani, as he led a
cross-country march to muster support for building a new Hindu
temple on the site of a 16th century Moslem mosque.
   About six hours later, party leaders submitted a letter to
Indian President Ramaswamy Venkataraman withdrawing support for
Singh's National Front government.
   The prime minister told reporters at the presidential palace
that the loss of Bharatiya Janata support ``doesn't mean that all
support is gone.'' However, it was unclear how he could avoid
calling new elections.
   With the defection of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Singh's
centrist government loses the fragile majority it cobbled together
from across the political spectrum after November general
elections.
   No single party had won enough seats to take power unilaterally.
   The next steps are up to Singh and the president.
   Under the constitution, the options include Singh's resignation
as prime minister and elections for a new Parliament.
   President Venkataraman could also ask Singh to try to muster a
new majority in Parliament, which appears mathematically and
politically improbable.
   Or, the president can turn to the opposition leader, former
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, and ask if Gandhi's Congress Party
could form a coalition government.
   That also appears unlikely.
   The crisis was precipitated by Advani's determination to go
ahead with his march to bolster support for the campaign to replace
a Moslem mosque with a temple to the Hindu god Lord Rama.
   Singh had urged Hindu fundamentalists to postpone the temple
plan. At least 80 people died this month in Hindu-Moslem clashes
spurred by the dispute.
   In a nationally televised address Monday night, Singh renewed
his appeal and said he was prepared to face the fact that his stand
could bring down the government.
   ``Religious fanaticism is the first step towards the foundation
for a theocratic state,'' Singh said in his 20-minute TV speech.
``It will be the death of India as a secular state.''
   The prime minister added: ``Hundreds of governments can come and
go, but the nation should remain one.''
   Advani was arrested about sunrise in a remote part of Bihar
state near the village of Samastipur, about 450 miles southeast of
New Delhi.
   He had been leading a caravan of supporters across the Hindu
heartland to demonstrate and bolster support for plans to build a
temple on a site now occupied by a 16th century mosque in the holy
Hindu town of Ayodhya. Ayodhya is in Uttar Pradesh state, which
lies between New Delhi and Bihar state.
   Advani's planned path through Bihar and Uttar Pradesh en route
to Ayodhya would have taken him through poor villages populated by
both Moslems and Hindus. In Bihar especially, these villages have
been recurring flashpoints for Hindu-Moslem violence.
   Hindu fundamentalists have vowed to start building the temple in
one week on the spot where they say the Hindu god Lord Rama was
born. Moslem activists and religious leaders have vowed to prevent
any encroachment on the mosque.
   The outcry has torn at the social and political fabric of
officially secular India, where 82 percent of the 880 million
people are Hindus. Moslems form 12 percent of the population.
   Singh took office in December after ousting Gandhi and his
Congress Party in the November general election. Although the
Congress Party and its allies hold 210 of Parliament's 522 seats,
it lacked the majority to govern.
   Singh's National Front coalition holds just 141 seats, but it
won the tacit support of the two extremes of India's political
spectrum: Advani's right-wing Hindu party and the Left Front
alliance of several communist parties.
   With that support, Singh could draw on enough votes to give him
the majority needed to pass legislation and stay in power.
   Bharatiya Janata has 88 members of Parliament, the Left Front
51.

<HEAD>Scientists Release Rare Shark</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Scientists set free a rare megamouth
shark, only one of five ever seen, after deciding the 15-foot,
2,000-pound behemoth with a gaping, silvery maw could not survive
in captivity.
   Biologists attached a radio transmitter to the shark Monday so
they can track it for three days until the device's batteries run
out.
   The shark ``is a fabulous opportunity for us, but the animal
comes first,'' said Dennis Kelly, an Orange Coast College marine
biologist. ``You hate to see something like this die.''
   It was apparently the first member of its species to be brought
ashore alive and only the fifth such creature ever seen. ``This is
like an alien coming out of the depths. It's one in a million,''
Kelly said.
   With its large, bulbous snout and mouth that can open as wide as
two feet, the plankton-eating megamouth is one of the largest
sharks in the world. Its mouth is lined with silvery tissue that
scientists believe may generate light to attract plankton in dark
ocean water.
   The shark was accidentally snared in a 1,200-foot-wide drift net
Sunday in shallow water offshore, then towed here by a 38-foot
commercial fishing boat and tethered by its tail to the vessel.
   After trying without success to find an aquarium big enough to
hold the shark, scientists decided to release it, said Robert
Lavenberg, curator of fishes at the Los Angeles County Museum of
Natural History.
   The fishing boat towed the shark out of the harbor so scientists
could videotape it underwater and attach the transmitter.
   ``It will show the depth, which is the most significant thing we
can find out,'' said Rocky Strong, a researcher for the Cousteau
Society.
   Scientists wondered why the shark was swimming in less than 100
feet of water when caught by the net. The sharks are known to swim
at depths of 700 feet to several thousand feet.
   The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society in Redondo Beach had urged
that the shark be released immediately.
   ``It's as if we found a dinosaur and chained it to a tree until
it dies,'' Sea Shepherd president Scott Trimingham said. ``One
animal left alive in the wild is worth more than 1,000 dead
specimens.''
   The first megamouth shark ever discovered was caught off Hawaii
in 1976 after it swallowed a Navy anchor. It died before biologists
could see it.
   A megamouth was caught off California's Santa Catalina Island in
1984, but died en route to port. It is on display at Lavenberg's
museum.
   Another washed ashore south of Perth, Australia, and died within
hours. The decomposed carcass of a fourth megamouth washed ashore
in Japan.
   All four megamouths seen previously measured about 14{ feet.

   There was a lot of clowning around at the
funeral, but everybody knew that's how the departed would have
wanted it. In fact, Patches the Clown had insisted on it.
   Patches, also known as Richard Eugene ``Dick'' Brunner, was
buried Monday in his trademark black derby, patched suit and
polka-dot tie. His nose was covered with bright red clown paint.
   Brunner, 69, was laid to rest in a casket festooned with balloon
animals. He was carried to his grave in a hearse painted with
pictures of clowns and balloons.
   Brunner, who died Saturday in a Nashville, Tenn., hospital, had
told a friend of his funeral plans in June after learning he was
dying of leukemia.
   ``I said, `If that's what you want, have at it,' '' said Marvin
Melhiser, a fellow member of the Shriners organization for which
Brunner performed as a clown.
   So Brunner's funeral opened with a recording of ``Send in the
Clowns,'' a cue that brought 17 clowns into the chapel. They handed
out balloon animals to mourners.
   ``He always had a joke, always had a smile,'' recalled fellow
clown Al Arnold.

<TEXT>
   The U.S.-backed drug war in Colombia has
diverted attention from unprecendented human rights abuses,
including those committed by army-sponsored death squads, a rights
group says.
   The independent group Americas Watch said Monday that
disappearances, massacres and assassinations have soared since the
government cracked down on the drug trade in August 1989.
   Americas Watch did not accuse the central government of directly
violating human rights but said it had refused to acknowledge the
high degree of military involvement, only making matters worse.
   The report said army troops repeatedly violate the laws of war
in trying to eradicate leftist guerrillas and have formed
``unholy'' alliances with drug traffickers and paramilitary death
squads.
   It also documented human rights violations by left-wing rebels
and traffickers. Traffickers, who have acquired vast land holdings,
often share the fanatical right-wing ideologies of the death
squads, the report said.
   It said the Bush administration did not escape responsibility
since it pours in millions of dollars of military aid without
demanding human rights safeguards.
   U.S. anti-drug aid often ends up in the hands of unscrupulous
army officers who use the money to terrorize local populations, the
report says.
   The government of President Cesar Gaviria, in office for three
months, is preparing an official response to the report.
   A senior government official, speaking to reporters on condition
of anonymity, denied that the government lacks the will to
prosecute army officers who violate human rights.
   ``Between 2,000 and 2,200 members of the armed forces have been
removed from their posts for various disciplinary reasons since
1987,'' he said.
   The former administration of President Virgilio Barco began a
major crackdown on drug traffickers after the Medellin cocaine
cartel assassinated a leading presidential candidate in August
1989.
   Since then, the government has blamed most political killings on
the cartel, all but ignoring army involvement, Americas Watch said.
   ``The government's insistence that the Medellin cartel leaders
are responsible for all violent abuses has become a serious
obstacle to efforts to halt the violence, since it has left other
paramilitary groups largely free to assassinate leftist leaders and
massacre their perceived supporters,'' the report says.
   It says political violence claimed the lives of 4,000 people in
1988 and 3,200 in 1989, adding, ``These figures as noted are the
highest in the hemisphere during those years.''
   Some senior army officers have joined forces with paramilitary
death squads and drug traffickers in a common battle to defeat the
left at any cost, the study says.
   While recognizing the ``courageous efforts'' of many officials
who tried to curb abuses, Americas Watch said government security
personnel have tortured or murdered some suspected drug
traffickers.
   ``Suspects `disappeared' after their arrest, many detainees were
tortured and in neighborhoods of Medellin the police arrested young
people indiscriminately and at times opened fire in crowded public
places,'' the report says.
   Medellin, Colombia's second largest city, is home to the world's
most notorious cocaine cartel.
   The government official acknowledged that ``problems of this
nature'' could exist, but said security forces who commit abuses
act on their own.
   Americas Watch said the Bush administration is expected to send
$382 million in military and police aid to Colombia between 1990
and 1994, ``without any effort to ensure that these funds do not
reach abusive forces.''

   After a half century of avoiding commitment as
if it were kryptonite, Superman has popped the question to Lois
Lane, and she said yes.
   ``They've played games long enough,'' ``Superman'' editor
Michael Carlin said Monday. ``This story HAD to happen.''
   No wedding date was announced, and complications can be
expected: The Man of Steel proposes as mild-mannered Clark Kent,
and Miss Lane, who accepts in the Nov. 1 issue of ``Superman''
comics, is unaware of his true identity.
   Superman asks for Miss Lane's hand after he is exposed to red
kryptonite, loses his super powers and becomes convinced he can
finally lead a normal life.
   ``It's not a gag, not a one-issue trick story,'' according to an
announcement from DC Comics. ``This time, for the first time since
the characters were created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, it's
for real.''
   A fist-size, plastic engagement ring came in the announcement,
along with a newspaper-style notification that gives the lovebirds'
backgrounds.
   For example, Kent, a native of Smallville, Kan., and Miss Lane
of Queensland Park, Metropolis, are both Pulitzer Prize winners and
published novelists. Kent writes a syndicated column.
   Miss Lane, who for years barely tolerated Clark and had a crush
on Superman, has recently come to see that he is the one ``who is
always there when she needs him,'' DC Comics said.
   Not every proposal becomes a wedding, of course, and when
Superman regains his super powers he must again decide whether to
reveal his secret identity to Miss Lane.
   To be continued, as they say.

   In the 1940s, he produced ``Commandos Strike at Dawn,''
``Tomorrow the World'' and ``The Story of G.I. Joe.''
   Cowan originated the first college course in film studies in

   Singing cowboy star Roy Rogers was

   Rogers, 79, underwent four hours of surgery Monday at St. Mary
Desert Valley Hospital, said Roy ``Dusty'' Rogers Jr.

Evans, who wrote their theme song, ``Happy Trails.'' His horse,
Trigger, is on display at the Roy Rogers-Dale Evans Museum in
Victorville.
   Rogers checked into the hospital Sunday after complaining of
stomach pain during church services in this town about 75 miles
from Los Angeles. His wife drove him to the hospital.
   Doctors had monitored an aneurysm, or weak spot, in his aorta
for several months, and found that it had bled in one spot, his son
said. The aorta is the body's main artery.
   Rogers underwent open heart surgery in 1978.
   Earlier this month, he joined Randy Travis at the Country Music
Awards in Nashville, Tenn., to sing Travis' ``Heroes and Friends,''
a tribute to Western movie stars.
   Born Leonard Slye in Cincinnati, Rogers came to California in
1929 as a migrant fruit picker. He appeared as a singer on a Los
Angeles radio show called ``Midnight Frolic'' in the early 1930s,
and his first bit film role came in 1935.
   He launched several business ventures, including the Roy Rogers
chain of fast food restaurants.

   Jerry Van Dyke, in his role as dimwitted Luther
Van Dam from ``Coach,'' apologized on the air for having knocked
Cleveland two weeks ago in an promotional spot for the ABC comedy,
and the mayor accepted.
   The apology came in a promo as well. It was aired during the
Monday night football game between the Cleveland Browns and the
Cincinnati Bengals.
   ``I just want to say that I'm sorry, Cleveland, and I love
Cleveland and I love the people in it,'' Van Dam said.
   Mayor Michael R. White replied: ``The Cleveland of today and the
Cleveland of 15 years ago are vastly different places. I think the
apology frankly recognizes that there has been a major
improvement.''
   The joke that got Cleveland so mad was broadcast Oct. 8 during a
Monday night football game between Cleveland and Denver.
   Van Dam, a football coach in ``Coach,'' said in the promo, ``I
think the problem with Cleveland is, even if you win, you lose. You
still got to go home to Cleveland.''
   Dale R. Finley, president of the Cleveland Convention and
Visitors Bureau, said the joke reflected an image created when the
city's oil-slicked Cuyahoga River caught fire 20 years ago and the
city went into default in 1978.
   The city has since changed, he said.

<TEXT>
   The two Koreas met on the soccer field
at Olympic Stadium today before more than 80,000 South Koreans, who
cheered for both teams and roared approval for unification.
   South Korea's national team won 1-0, but the score was
insignificant beside the diplomatic coup in having two enemy
nations share a playing field for only the second time since World
War II.
   The first time was two weeks ago in North Korea, when the
northern team beat the south 2-1.
   Today's crowd was the largest to see a South Korean sports event
since the 1988 Olympic Games.
   At the end of the game, spectators rose for a standing ovation
as the athletes jogged around the stadium holding hands and waving.
The teams exchanged shirts and waved them in the air.
   ``Our wish is unification,'' blared a unification song over the
loudspeakers.
   The game, called North-South Unification Soccer, is the high
point of a five-day visit by a 78-member North Korean sports
delegation, the first from the Communist north to visit the south
since the 1945 division of the peninsula.
   South Korean soccer players visited the north earlier this
month. That visit was only the second civilian exchange between the
countries in more than four decades.
   The soccer delegation returns to North Korea on Friday after
rounds of sightseeing, dinners and talks on future sports
exchanges.
   South Korean Sports Minister Chung Dong Sung and his North
Korean counterpart, Kim Yu Sun, agreed in principle to form a joint
single team for the 1992 Olympic Games and other international
sports events at talks in Pyongyang. They said further discussions
would be held in Seoul.
   About 5,000 plainclothes police were positioned inside and
outside the stadium. Spectators were searched twice and passed
through metal detectors to get to their seats. Scalpers were asking
$140 for tickets, 10 times the highest face value price.
   The teams of the rival Koreas entered the stadium side by side,
holding hands and waving to thunderous applause.
   ``This is not purely sports festival,'' Kim said before the
match began. ``It should lead to a unification festival.''
   ``I hope this soccer match will be a spring board for national
unification,'' Chung.
   Thousands roared in approval and waved colorful pompons.
Spectators had been asked not to bring national flags, decorative
placards or other paraphernalia which would be identified only with
South Korea.
   A drum and bugle corps played and a gigantic electric signboard
flashed the pictures of the ministers. The North Korean team threw
half a dozen soccer balls signed with their signatures into the
grandstand and screaming spectators raced to retrieve them.
   During the game, the South Korean crowd cheered wildly for plays
by both teams. Radical students, who had said they would root for
the North Korean visitors, were not visible.
   News reports said tickets were sold on an individual basis
apparently to avoid large radical or dissident groups sitting
together.
   The sports exchange comes at a time when South Korea and North
Korea are seeking to find ways to ease tensions and work together
for unification.
   The prime ministers of both Koreas met for the second time last
week in Pyongyang, the north's capital, and have agreed to meet
again in Seoul in December. A South Korean musicians' delegation
returns Wednesday from a 10-day visit to the north.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into the Communist North and
capitalist South in 1945 at the end of the World War II. The two
nations fought a war in the early 1950s and a peace treaty was
never signed.
   The border between the Koreas remains tightly sealed and is one
of the most heavily fortified demarcations in the world with more
than 1.5 million troops on either side.

   A Palestinian truck driver stabbed two women
soldiers in northern Israel today in a third straight day of Arab
knifing attacks in the country, Arab reports and Israel radio said.
   The wounded soldiers were rushed to Rambam Hospital in the port
city of Haifa, the radio said. Their condition was not immediately
known.
   The attack occurred as the soldiers waited for a ride to their
base at a hitchhiking post at a major intersection, the radio and
Arab reports said.
   A truck with blue license plates, indicating ownership by a
Palestinian from the occupied West Bank, stopped and the driver got
out, the radio said.
   ``He took out a knife and started to stab the soldiers,'' the
radio said. Other soldiers at the site fired on the assailant as he
fled, it said.
   Police said the man later was captured.
   Israel radio said the man was from Jenin in the West Bank. The
town of about 20,000 people and surrounding camps were torn by
anti-Israeli protests on Monday. At least nine Palestinians were
shot and wounded by Israeli troops in the clashes, Arab hospitals
reported.
   One of the Palestinian youths, 14-year-old Mahmoud Lahlouh, died
of his wounds on Monday. He had been hit in the chest by a bullet,
the army said.
   The first knife attack occurred on Sunday morning in Jerusalem,
when a Palestinian killed three people in a quiet neighborhood.
   Seeking to prevent further violence, security forces closed
Jerusalem to Arabs from the occupied territories on Monday and
thousands of extra police patrolled its streets.
   Nevertheless, a Palestinian stabbed a Jew in the city, slightly
injuring him. Police searched a nearby village for the assailant.
   After Monday's violence, national police headquarters announced
the ban on Palestinians entering Jerusalem would continue for at
least a second day ``in view of the present tension in the city.''
   Serious clashes in Jerusalem began on Oct. 8, when police fired
on Moslems on the Temple Mount after they stoned Jewish worshipers
at the nearby Western Wall. At least 19 Palestinians were killed
and 140 wounded.
   On Sunday, a knife-wielding Palestinian apparently sought to
avenge the killings on the Temple Mount.
   The motive in Monday's knife attack was not clear.
   The death of Lahlouh raised to 763 the number of Palestinians
killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians in the 34-month uprising
against Israeli occupation.
   An additional 28 were slain by fellow Arabs, most for allegedly
collaborating with Israel. Fifty-one Israelis have died in the
violence.

<HEAD>Finder of Lyme Disease Says it's Overdiagnosed Now</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The doctor who first identified Lyme disease 15
years ago says doctors are overdiagnosing the tick-borne illness.
   ``It's being used to cause a number of conditions it is not
causing,'' Dr. Allen Steere of the Tufts University School of
Medicine said Monday.
   The bacterial disease, which causes a distinctive bulls-eye
rash, fever and arthritis and is carried by tiny ticks that are
often found on deer, is being blamed for conditions ranging from
chronic fatigue to stress, Steere said.
   The danger, he said at the Interscience Conference on
Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, occurs when misdiagnosed
patients are put on antibiotics for up to two years and run the
risk of complications from the drugs.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported 7,402 cases of
Lyme disease in the United States in 1989, up from 4,574 in 1988.
   No one's quite sure exactly how many of the reported cases are
not properly diagnosed or how many actual cases never get reported,
Steere said.
   ``But the idea that thousands of cases (misdiagnosed as Lyme
disease) are occurring each year - I think that's in the ballpark
of what we're dealing with,'' he said.
   Steere was at Yale University when he identified the first cases
of Lyme disease in 1975 in patients from Old Lyme, Conn.

<HEAD>Optimisim About Gulf Crisis Boosts Dollar, Stocks Up Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Optimism about the Persian Gulf crisis boosted the
dollar against the Japanese yen today, and prices on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange gained for the seventh consecutive trading day.
   ``People think the situation has eased, so that is why the
dollar is going up,'' said Masahiro Ishikawa, assistant manager of
the treasury department for Deutsche Bank's Tokyo office.
   The dollar closed at 127.13 yen, up 0.88 yen from Monday's close
of 126.25 yen. It opened at 126.40 yen, and traded between 126.30
yen and 127.37 yen.
   The dollar now has climbed 2.73 yen in three trading days, after
a 13-day slide that totaled 13.55 yen.
   Some traders feel that the market has hit bottom, ``and if the
(gulf) war finishes, the dollar will go up,'' Ishikawa said.
   The dollar's rise forced investors who last week thought the
dollar would slide further to cover their short dollar positions
this week, said Masakazu Kimura, a manager in the foreign exchange
group of the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank.
   Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno told a meeting of central
bank branch managers that he welcomed the yen's strengthening
because it would offset the inflationary effect of higher crude oil
prices.
   But he warned against a plunge in the dollar's value, and urged
cuts in the U.S. fiscal deficit to help keep up confidence in the
markets and support the dollar.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average closed
at 25,298.30, up 227.44 points, or 0.91 percent, from Monday's
close. Trading volume was down from Monday's 600 million shares,
but still moderately heavy at 550 million.
   Rumors that Saudi Arabian monetary authorities were unloading
Japanese bonds dampened a strong early morning rally, traders said.
   The more comprehensive TOPIX index of all issues listed on the
first section rose only to 1,859.56 points from Monday's close of
1,858.30, said Pelham Smithers, an analyst for Shearson Lehman
Hutton Asia Ltd.
   ``On Friday, we downweighted our portfolios to 40 percent stocks
from 45 percent, reflecting (our feeling that) the stock market was
out of line with other financial instruments,'' he said.
   Including today's gains, the Nikkei index has advanced 2,908.14
points, or 13 percent, over the last seven trading days. The index
is up 25.1 percent from its low for the year - 20,221.86 on Oct. 1.
   ``Japanese equities seem to be developing a powerful upside
trend,'' Andrzej Tojek, senior international market analyst for
Merrill Lynch Japan Inc., said in a newsletter distributed Monday.
   ``There are a lot of bullish people out there still,'' Smithers
said.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
government bonds rose to 84.81 points from their close of 84.75 on
Monday. Their yield dropped to 7.735 percent from 7.750 percent.

<HEAD>Heart-Transplant Patient Dies After Blood Type Mix-Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A transplant patient died a week after being
given a heart of the wrong blood type, hospital officials say.
   The 47-year-old man's blood type had been incorrectly listed on
a transplant-matching computer, said Dr. Robert Emery, director of
heart transplantation for Abbott Northwestern Hospital and the
Minneapolis Heart Institute.
   The unidentified patient, who died after undergoing organ
rejection Friday, had type-O blood but received a heart from
someone with type A, Emery said.
   Emery said the hospital and heart institute were investigating
how the mistake occurred. He said a check revealed no other errors
involving patients on the institute's waiting list.
   Had the patient been given a matched heart, Emery said, his
chances of survival would have been close to 100 percent. He said
the survival rate for type-O patients receiving transplants from
type-A donors is about 60 percent.
   Shortly after the new heart began functioning in the man's
chest, laboratory personnel discovered the mistake.
   Doctors put out a call for a second, matched heart but none
became available. The man had waited about six months for the first
heart.
   It looked like the patient, who was put on anti-rejection drugs,
might survive despite the mistake, but his body rejected the organ
Friday, Emery said.
   The patient's own heart was nearly destroyed by cardiomyopathy,
a deterioration of the heart muscle. He also suffered from lung
problems and kidney failure.
   Because of his kidney trouble, he was not eligible for an
artificial heart to carry him until a matched heart became
available.

   A member of 2 Live Crew pleaded guilty to
obscenity and was fined $1,000 for simulating sex during a show by
the rap group in 1987.
   The plea, entered Monday by a lawyer for Mark ``Brother
Marquis'' Ross, came two days after he and two other members of the
group were acquitted in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., of obscenity for an
adults-only show at a nightclub in June.
   In addition to fining Ross, State District Judge Byron Hebert
placed him on six months' unsupervised probation.
   District Attorney Nathan Stansbury said Ross simulated sex on
stage with a woman from the audience.
   The group has not been back to Louisiana since but is scheduled
for another Lafayette nightclub appearance in late November.
   ``I heard that the promoter said they have a new show - a PG
version. That remains to be seen,'' the district attorney said.

   A woman who said she couldn't find a baby
sitter she could trust locked her 5-year-old daughter in the trunk
of her car while she worked at a shopping mall, police said.
   Chante Fernandez, 24, of Elizabeth, was charged with criminal
restraint and freed on $5,000 bail.
   Her daughter, who was not hurt, was placed in protective
custody.
   The woman, who could get up to five years in prison and a $7,500
fine if convicted, was arrested Saturday after shoppers at the
Woodbridge Center mall parking lot heard sounds coming from the car
trunk.
   Officers said they found the girl inside with a blanket, a coat,
a flashlight, a book, a stuffed animal and a doughnut.
   Police said Ms. Fernandez told them she had been keeping the
child in the car for the past month while she worked weekends as a
sales clerk.
   Ms. Fernandez said she had gone through three baby sitters but
fired them because they stole from her, brought boyfriends into her
home or left the child alone for long periods.
   She said a fold-down rear seat allowed the girl to climb out of
the trunk if she needed to.

<HEAD>Dollar and Gold Rise Slightly in Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Concern about the cost of German reunification
paved the way for a temporary rebound of the dollar against the
mark today, but currency traders predicted the downward trend of
the dollar would resume soon.
   Gold rose slightly.
   On Monday, five respected German think tanks said they foresaw
slower than expected growth in the German economy.
   In addition to the German concerns, the dollar was helped by
signs that a negotiated solution might be possible to the
confrontation in the Persian Gulf. This triggered a sharp drop in
oil prices to under $30 a barrel.
   Hussam Kharbotli, a vice president of First Chicago in London,
said the dollar might continue consolidating today, but that it
would resume its downward trend later this week because of the
continued lack of any solution to the U.S. budget deficit talks.
   ``I can understand the dollar having a breather after falling
down through 1.50 marks, but there is no fundamental change,'' said
Paul Darmody, a senior dealer at Nikko Bank Ltd. in London.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.88 yen to a closing 127.13 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 127.83 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   -1.5225 German marks, up from 1.5135
   -1.2845 Swiss francs, up from 1.2800
   -5.0960 French francs, up from 5.0662
   -1.7150 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7655
   -1,139.00 Italian lire, up from 1,134.25
   -1.1740 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1725
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9430, compared
with $1.9495 late Monday.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$370.75 per ounce at midmorning, from $367.75 bid per ounce late
Monday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $370.75, up from $369.00 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 23 cents to close at a bid
$371.59.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $4.23 a troy ounce,
from Monday's $4.21.

   Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent has
thrown his support behind a plan to move the San Francisco Giants
40 miles south to Silicon Valley.
   Vincent said Monday the ``Santa Clara Giants'' had a certain
ring to it, referring to the name that makes skin crawl in San
Francisco, the Giants' home for 33 years.
   ``If you get the vote, it will be a big-league name. I guarantee
it,'' he said.
   Voters in Santa Clara County will decide next month whether to
build a $153 million stadium in Santa Clara.
   Vincent said the move was the best solution to the ``dire''
situation San Francisco voters created last fall when they narrowly
defeated a measure to build a new ballpark to replace aging
Candlestick Park.
   The alternatives are keeping the Giants at Candlestick, famouse
for icy wind blasts and fog, or moving out of the San Francisco Bay
area, Vincent said.
   ``I don't think there are many communities in the United States
who get a chance at a team and turn it down. San Francisco seems to
be the exception,'' he said.
   Giants owner Bob Lurie wants out of Candlestick, and has cited
surveys showing that fans don't support the team enough because
they don't like the ballpark.

<TEXT>
   Missouri's Supreme Court threw an
initiative off the November ballot that, if approved, would have
cut the number of state lawmakers, created an ethics commission and
shortened legislative sessions.
   The court Monday agreed with a lower court that Amendment 5
unconstitutionally dealt with too many subjects.
   Curtis Wilkerson, a supporter of the measure, charged that
legislative leaders, by sitting up front at the hearing on the
issue, had intimidated the court ``with unspoken threats of no more
pay raises'' if they upheld the measure.
   The measure would have reduced the Statehouse from 160
legislators to 103 in 2003 and would have barred lawmakers from
tacking pay raises for themselves onto other bills. The ethics
commission would have governed lawmakers and other officials.
   It would have shortened the legislative session by two weeks.
   ``It's a shame the court decided to block the people's right to
vote on this issue. Never before has the will of hundreds of
thousands of Missourians been so plainly disregarded by politicians
and the courts,'' said Gov. John Ascroft, a Republican who strongly
backed the initiative.
   The court did not say whether any of the seven judges dissented.
The one-paragraph ruling said a written opinion would be issued
later.

<HEAD>Man Arraigned in Theft of GM Pictures</HEAD>

   A photo technician who had access to confidential
photographs of future General Motors Corp. car models was arrested
for trying to sell them back to GM for $75,000, the FBI said.
   Gregory C. Hooper, 36, of Royal Oak was charged with mail fraud
at his arraignment Monday in U.S. District Court and released on a
$10,000 personal bond.
   He faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine.
   GM offered a $30,000 reward last November for the arrest of
whoever was responsible for leaking pictures, slides and drawings
of several future GM products to auto enthusiast magazines. Among
them were photos of what was described as the 1991 Saturn model.
   Hooper allegedly collected $40,000 by selling the material to
Autoweek, Automobile, and Car and Driver magazines.
   ``He stole the photos in 1988 and into last year,'' FBI agent
John Anthony said. ``After that, he started selling them to
magazines.''
   He said Hooper contacted GM after a magazine ran an article
about the reward. ``That is also when we got involved.''
   The FBI seized the stolen material Friday after identifying
Hooper through telephone calls he allegedly made to GM last week.
   Hooper worked as a photographic technician in a GM department
where the photos were stored, Anthony said.
   U.S. Attorney Stephen Markman said the publication of some of
the stolen material, including pictures of clay models, has cost GM
millions of dollars.
   ``Such a crime has a profound impact on GM's future competitive
position,'' said GM spokesman Don Postma.
   He said Monday the $30,000 reward money had not been paid.

<HEAD>Colorado Bar Association, Business Groups Try Resolution Before
Lawsuits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HILLIARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Too many people who file lawsuits could have
talked their differences out and saved money, say lawyers and
business people with a plan to promote more talking and less suing.
   ``Ninety-five percent of cases settle without trial, but often
settlement happens on the eve of trial,'' said Colorado Bar
Association President Jerry Conover.
   Lawyers' and business association officials introduced a program
Monday called Colorado Pledge, which they believe is the first of
its kind. Participating businesses promise not to sue each other
until they've tried to resolve disputes through negotiations or
other alternatives.
   The Bar Association will supervise the resolution efforts.
   ``We hope it will show to you a side of lawyers that is not
frequently enough publicized - a side of lawyers that solves
problems and helps clients solve problems not in the courtroom
arena,'' Conover said.
   The Bar Association, the Greater Denver Chamber of Commerce, the
Colorado Association of Commerce and Industry, and the National
Federation of Independent Business are participating.
   But absent from Monday's news conference announcing Colorado
Pledge was a representative of another lawyers' group, the Colorado
Trial Lawyers Association.
   Companies that have signed the pledge so far include Adolph
Coors Co., Pepsi Cola Bottling Co. of Colorado Springs and United
Banks of Colorado Inc.
   Staying out of court will save businesses money and avoiding
litigation will save their executives time, said those putting the
program together.
   Art Shenkin, whose accounting company signed the pledge, said he
once served as an expert witness in a case ``where the legal fees
on both sides turned out to be more than the total amount being
sued for.''
   ``Had the parties been able to get together for a solution
amicable to both sides, it would have saved a lot of money and a
lot of time and both businesses would have been better off,''
Shenkin said.

<HEAD>Fahd Says Saddam Won't Lose Face if He Pulls Out of Kuwait</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   King Fahd today urged Saddam Hussein
to withdraw from Kuwait and said the Iraqi president would not lose
face if he did, according to news reports.
   The statement appeared to be Saudi Arabia's most conciliatory
message yet to the Iraqi leader since his forces seized Kuwait on
Aug. 2 and subsequently massed on the Saudi border.
   ``It would be nothing to cause anxiety or pain,'' Fahd told the
Saudi Press Agency. ``But to the contrary if President Saddam
thought seriously about the matter, he will find that it is in the
interest of Iraq, in his interest, and in the interest of the Arab
nation, that he pull out from Kuwait.''
   ``If a blunder was committed, there is no reason to follow the
mistake with another mistake. The correct reply is to remedy the
mistake.''
   The Saudi Press Agency distributed Fahd's statements hours after
a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. The two also met
Monday to discuss the nearly 3-month-old gulf crisis. Fahd made the
statements to the reporters accompanying the Egyptian leader, the
agency said.
   If Saddam acted on this advice, ``we would be thankful,'' Fahd
said. ``If he thinks he will get another reaction, I think he will
get thanks.''
   Egypt has 14,000 troops deployed in the mostly U.S.
multinational force of 300,000 men and women that was rushed to the
region to confront Saddam.
   At the start of his Saudi visit Monday, Mubarak met with his
troops deployed at the northeastern region of Hafr al-Batin and
told them their presence was meant to ``force him who lost his
reason to return to it.''
   He also expressed Egypt's hope that the gulf crisis will ``end
without bloodshed.''
   Mubarak departed today for the United Arab Emirates, another
gulf ally of Kuwait where Egyptian forces are also deployed.
   Diplomatic sources said Monday that Fahd and Mubarak agreed the
Iraqi withdrawal and the restoration of the al-Sabah family to the
rule in Kuwait could be followed by negotiations on disputes that
caused the invasion.
   On Sunday, Saudi Defense Minister Prince Sultan, third in the
leadership after Fahd and Crown Prince Abdullah, said ``rights,
whether valid or doubtful'' could always be discussed, but only
after a Iraqi withdrawal.
   Some quarters took the prince's remarks as a sign that the
Saudis were ready to agree to territorial concessions by Kuwait.
This was a factor in oil prices plunging $5.14 a barrel in New York
and closing at $28.38.
   The Saudi defense minister subsequently issued a statement ``to
clarify ... wrong interpretations'' of his words and reaffirmed
that ``the kingdom categorically rejects the Iraqi aggression on
sister Kuwait.''
   The statement distributed today by the Saudi Press Agency said
the kingdom ``reaffirms its full committment to all Arab and
international resolutions demanding Iraq unconditionally
withdraw...from Kuwait, and the restoration of legitimacy to Kuwait
under the leadership of the Emir.''

<HEAD>Arbitrator Upholds Non-Alcoholic Lunch for Water and Sewer Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An arbitrator has upheld a Water and Sewer
Commission edict that prohibits workers from having lunchtime
cocktails, but says workers accustomed to the practice should be
given time to adapt.
   Arbitrator Timothy J. Buckalew agreed with commission director
Robert Ciolek's no-alcohol rule, which was imposed last January.
   Union officials contended workers have the right to do whatever
they please during their unpaid lunch breaks. The union said it
would accept the ban only if workers got a raise or a shorter work
day.
   In his decision released Monday, Buckalew said the commission
had the right to impose the ban for safety.
   ``The commission clearly has an interest in insuring not only
that the employee reports to work sober, but that he maintains
sobriety throughout his work day,'' he wrote.
   Buckalew added, however, that workers who do drink at lunch be
given ``ample grace time'' to change their habits.
   As a footnote to the decision, Buckalew quoted from the Bible:
``Go, eat your bread with enjoyment, and drink your wine with a
merry heart; for God has already approved of what you do.''
   Ciolek said drinking at lunch was dangerous for the workers, who
sometimes must drive and operate jackhammers on the job.
   ``There is no constitutional right to have a few pops at
lunch,'' Ciolek said.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet and U.S. television executives will
examine coverage of politics and government in both countries in a
commission established at The Carter Center of Emory University.
   Former President Carter announced the formation of the
U.S.-U.S.S.R Commission on Television Policy. He said he will be
the host at the group's first meeting, scheduled for February 1991.
   ``The impact of television in both the Soviet Union and in the
United States cannot be overestimated, and the commission will
focus on concrete policy issues of importance to both countries,''
Carter said Monday in a written statement.
   The U.S. membership on the commission will include the
presidents of the three major networks and Ted Turner, chairman of
the Turner Broadcasting System. Government officials, educators and
public opinion experts from both countries also will serve on the
commission.
   The group will study policies and regulations relating to
televised coverage of elections and electoral campaigns, referenda,
and the activities of legislatures.
   About 97 percent of the Soviet population watches TV across 11
time zones and the average prime time audience consists of 150
million viewers, based on estimates from The Carter Center's Soviet
Media and International Communications Program.
   ``There, as here, the era of television politics has arrived,''
said Ellen Mickiewicz, director of the Soviet Media Program.
   Eduard Sagalaev, director of News Broadcasting for Soviet
National Television, said the creation of the commission is more
than another sign of cooperation between the United States and the
Soviet Union.
   ``Our commission can in many ways support a permanent space
bridge between different continents, countries and peoples,'' he
said.

   An earthquake shook up parts of northern
Delaware, but was not strong enough to cause major damage,
officials said.
   Dr. Robert Jordan, director of the Delaware Geological Survey,
said the Monday night quake lasted about 20 seconds. It measured
between 3.3 and 3.4 on the Richter scale, a measure of ground
motion as recorded on seismographs.
   The U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., put the magnitude
at 2.9, said spokeswoman Pat Jorgenson. The quake was centered 15
miles south of Wilmington in the Delaware River Valley and was felt
in that area and in southern New Jersey, she said.
   Jordan said the earthquake was just about strong enough to cause
minor damage, such as cracked plaster. Since 1972, the state has
recorded 40 earthquakes, all minor, Jordan said. The worst occurred
on Feb. 28, 1973, measuring 3.8 on the Richter scale.

   Navajo Chairman Peter MacDonald drew
nearly six years in a tribal jail and an $11,000 fine for taking
cash, loans, plane rides and use of an car from businessmen trying
to curry favor with him.
   ``You have not admitted to any wrongdoing and shown no
remorse,'' Judge Robert Yazzie told him Monday. But he added, ``I
truly say you were a great leader and made valuable contributions
to the Navajo people.''
   The 61-year-old MacDonald, who was suspended from office last
year during his fourth term as leader of the 180,000-member tribe
in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, was convicted Wednesday of
bribery, conspiracy and ethics charges.
   His son, Peter ``Rocky'' MacDonald Jr., 36, was convicted of
similar charges and drew a 1{-year jail term and a $2,500 fine
Monday.
   MacDonald was sentenced to five years, 11 months in jail
followed by nearly five years of labor, which could be fulfilled by
community service. His son was sentenced to a year of labor.
   MacDonald was seeking election to the new position of tribal
president, but election law says no person convicted of ethics
violations may hold tribal office for four years.
   The tribal council Friday authorized the election board to
postpone the Nov. 6 election for two months.
   MacDonald's second trial was postponed from today until Nov. 27.
That case involves conspiracy charges stemming from the tribe's
purchase of a ranch for $33.4 million from a company that paid
$26.2 million for the property five minutes earlier.
   MacDonald also awaits trial on 93 fraud counts stemming from the
tribe's 1986 elections.

   China's guardians of Marxist ideology announced a
new campaign today against pornography and Western liberalism and
said they would press on with an anti-crime drive in which hundreds
have been executed.
   The announcements, made in headlines in the Communist Party
newspaper, the People's Daily, contradicted widespread expectations
that the party would relax its tight social controls after the
Asian Games ended Oct. 7 in Beijing.
   Hong Kong newspapers, many of which have close ties to Chinese
officials, had predicted that more participants in last year's
failed democracy movement would be released from jail if the games
went off smoothly.
   But Zhou Chengkui, spokesman for the National People's Congress,
said on Monday he had no word of forthcoming releases.
   Today's announcements further indicated the hard-liners who have
dominated Chinese politics since June 1989 have no intention of
relaxing their hold. Their speeches said that China's current
stability is fragile and called for vigilence against alleged
anti-party forces.
   ``At present, our country is politically, economically and
socially stable,'' Qiao Shi, the party official in charge of police
matters, said in giving the order to continue China's 6-month-old
crackdown on crime.
   ``But we must see clearly that the relatively smooth public
order of these few months was achieved through the might of the
(crackdown on crime),'' he said. ``In ideology and in work, we
cannot relax one whit.''
   The international human rights group Amnesty International said
last month that more than 720 people were given death sentences in
China from January through mid-August, including more than 350 in
June and July alone.
   Official newspapers have reported thousands of arrests since the
anti-crime campaign began in May, causing cities to expand their
police forces and in some cases form civilian patrols.
   The party also held an anti-pornography campaign for about six
months beginning in June 1989, when the army crushed a student-led
movement for democratic reforms. Not only pornographic but
pro-democratic publications were seized and burned.
   Liu Zhongde, who headed that drive, said a new campaign to last
through next spring will clean up remaining ``spiritual pollution
and cultural garbage.''
   The People's Daily quoted him as saying that 12 percent of the
country's newspapers, 13 percent of its social science periodicals
and more than 7 percent of its publishing houses had been closed
since June 1989.
   He said 32 million books and magazines were destroyed and nearly
80,000 people were convicted for involvement in illegal publising
activity.
   ``This is still just a good beginning,'' he said. ``Some obscene
publications that have been explicitly banned have reappeared in
new form. Illegal publishing activities have reared their heads.''
   He blamed this on ``the bourgeois liberal tide,'' the party's
phrase for Western-style democratic ideas such as free speech and
multiparty rule.
   ``People who support bourgeois liberalism ... advocate complete
Westernization,'' he said. ``But complete Westernization
necessarily opens the door to corrupt and degenerate capitalist
things, and thus obscene things are spread.''

   James Tucker was just dozing off
after a hard night of Marine guard duty in Beirut seven years ago
when a bomb blast demolished a nearby barracks and jolted him from
bed.
   The Oct. 23, 1983, truck bombing killed 241 Americans, mostly
Marines.
   Tucker, now 26 years old and a sergeant, is dug into another
defensive position in Saudi Arabia today, but his Marine outfit is
far more cautious.
   ``We're more terrorist-oriented, we are more terrorist-aware,''
said Capt. John Gauthier, 30, of Caldwell, N.J., a company
commander with the 1st Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment.
   In the aftermath of the truck bombing by a Shiite Moslem suicide
driver opposed to the U.S. involvement in Lebanon, the Marines
changed everything about the way they defend themselves.
   Since deploying in Saudi Arabia in the wake of Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait, these Marines have had at least four heightened
security alerts for terrorist attacks.
   Most of these Marines were in high school at the time of the
Beirut bombing and have little memory of it. But the threat is
emphasized in their training and even the smallest incident can
provoke a response.
   A civilian car flashing its lights near a camp was sufficient to
trigger one alert.
   The threat has also been used to try to cover at least one
embarrassing incident - when a soldier with a self-inflicted wound
first claimed he was shot during a gunfight with terrorists.
   Marine officers and enlisted men say the main lessons drawn from
Beirut are that they cannot let their guard down, and the United
States has to stick to clear-cut policy goals.
   The approximately 900 Marines sent into Beirut as a peacekeeping
force in the aftermath of the Israeli invasion were gradually
pulled into a sniping war with the Shiite militias in the
neighborhoods around their main airport barracks.
   But they simultaneously maintained the peacekeeping policy of
leaving ammunition clips out of their guns while on regular duty.
   ``We're all walking around with loaded weapons right now and if
the need comes to use them we won't hesitate,'' said Sgt. Richard
Hall, 27, of Jacksonville, N.C.
   Security precautions include not billeting Marines in large
buildings, not entering civilian stores, watching out for any
speeding vehicles on nearby roads and only stopping on highways for
police or other military vehicles.
   The Marines in Beirut were ``too lax. Their defenses were
down,'' said Lance Cpl. Peter Delgado, 27, of Buffalo, N.Y.
   Soldiers out in the desert are keeping their weapons close by
whether in the chow line, showers or on morning exercises.
   ``It helps you keep your guard up,'' Delgado added.
   The Marines feel confident that their scattered desert positions
have lessened the threat to a great extent.
   ``I don't think a truck loaded with dynamite could make it out
here. We have enough trouble with our own trucks,'' said Lt. David
Gurfein, 25, a mortar platoon leader from Great Neck, N.Y.
   Having Iraq as a clearly defined enemy and the Saudi commitment
to their involvement also gives confidence.
   ``Here you see all Arab countries pulling together to get one
person ousted from Kuwait,'' Gauthier said.
   But the fact that they are dug into defensive positions causes
some concern.
   ``I'm not real happy with static positions,'' Gauthier said.
``I'd rather be moving.''
   The actual anniversary of the Marine barracks explosion did not
prompt a security alert, Saudi officials and diplomats said.
   But for Beirut veterans like Sgt. Tucker, the anniversary brings
to mind the huge black cloud he saw over the barracks from his
billet at a nearby university the day of the attack.
   ``It makes me feel a little light in the stomach,'' he said,
thinking about the friends he lost.

<TEXT>
   Minnesota's Republican auditor has jumped
into the governor's race, taking advantage of allegations the
regular GOP nominee invited teen-age girls to take a nude dip with
him nine years ago.
   Auditor Arne Carlson announced a write-in campaign Monday
against Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich and Perpich's embattled
Republican challenger, business executive Jon Grunseth.
   Two women have charged in sworn statements that Grunseth
encouraged them to join him in a nude swim in 1981, when they were
13 and 14. Grunseth, 44, denied the allegation but has been under
increasing pressure from his party to quit the race.
   An internal GOP poll last week indicated that five Republicans,
including Carlson, could beat Perpich in the Nov. 6 election but
that Grunseth could not. Carlson, auditor since 1979, finished
second to Grunseth in last month's GOP primary.
   Grunseth welcomed Carlson's decision to get back in the race,
saying Carlson is ``liberal enough'' to pull Democratic votes from
Perpich.
   Grunseth also said he would stay in the race. ``The road to
victory over Rudy Perpich has been paved with my reputation and the
tears of my family, and I've got a right to drive down that road,''
he said.
   Perpich, seeking a fourth term, said of the development, ``This
has to be solved by the Republicans themselves.''
   Republicans began the year with high hopes of unseating Perpich,
who had been derided as eccentric and put on the defensive about
living in too grand a style, with a luxury car and bodyguard.
   Carlson acknowledged that a run-in campaign ``has a very slim
chance of success.''
   But he told supporters, ``I'm convinced that regardless of how
difficult the mechanical barriers of a write-in campaign may be, I
think with your help all throughout the state of Minnesota, we can
do something that is unprecedented. We can win.''
   According to the sworn statements by the two women, Grunseth
urged them, his 13-year-old daughter and a 16-year-old girl to swim
naked with him at a 1981 party at his house. The women said they
refused but that Grunseth, his daughter, Nina, and the 16-year-old
took off their clothes.
   One of the women said Grunseth also tried to pull down the strap
of her bathing suit and touch her breast.
   Grunseth's daughter denied the allegations, and Grunseth said
that if any skinny-dipping occurred, it was after he went to bed.
``Have I ever been skinny-dipping in my life?'' he said Sunday.
``Yeah. So what?''
   Carlson's action ``kind of took the wind out'' of a move by some
lawmakers to pressure Grunseth to resign, Senate GOP Minority
Leader Duane Benson said.
   ``A lot of people are kind of comfortable with two (Republican)
people in it,'' Benson said. ``But it would have really boiled had
Arne waited another day.''
   House Republican Leader Bill Schreiber said the Carlson
candidacy could boost GOP turnout and help the party capture more
seats in the Legislature. Democrats control both houses, but all
201 seats are up for re-election.
   John Stanoch, Perpich's campaign chairman, said Grunseth's
popularity and support have been declining over the past week. ``I
would suppose the majority of that support is going to go to Arne
Carlson,'' he said.

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rebels bombed the headquarters of two
oil companies today and set fire to a bus near the capital, one day
before militant labor unions planned a nationwide general strike.
   No casualties were reported in any of the attacks, police said.
   Maj. Gen. Cesar Nazareno, chief of the Philippine Constabulary,
blamed the bombings on Communist rebels and leftist labor groups
seeking to heighten unrest in advance of Wednesday's planned
strike.
   The first explosion occurred early today at a building housing
the power generator of the head office of Caltex Inc. in Manila.
The attackers threw a homemade explosive from outside the fence
that punctured the roof and a nearby wall with shrapnel, said
police Lt. Col. Pacifico Villalino.
   Ten minutes later, another explosion ripped through the
emergency generator building of the head office of Shell Companies
of the Philippines, also in the capital, police said. The bomb
damaged the roof and shattered glass panels in nearby buildings,
said police Lt. Col. Remy Macaspac.
   Both Shell and Caltex have asked for government approval to
raise fuel prices to make up for cost increases brought about in
part by the Persian Gulf crisis. The proposed increases have been
widely criticized.
   In the third incident, police said rebels flagged down a bus
headed for Manila from Cavite, 15 miles south, and set it on fire
after allowing passengers to get off. A motive for the attack was
not immediately clear.
   The 150,000-member military was placed on maximum alert for the
walkout, which is open-ended. Unions want a $1.50 per day increase
in the minimum wage.
   In the Manila area alone, trade union officials said strikers
will include up to 485 trade unions with more than 322,000 workers,
29 drivers associations with 150,000 members and four unions of
government employees.
   Nick Elman, spokesman for the militant labor alliance, the May
First Movement, said protesters will demonstrate in 48 areas in the
capital.
   But the nation's largest labor federation, the Trade Union
Congress of the Philippines, said it would not join the strike
until the government rules on a wage demand.
   President Corazon Aquino, in a statement, today urged workers
not to support the strike.
   ``I appeal to labor to settle their demands peacefully at the
forum provided for by law - the regional wage boards,'' Mrs. Aquino
said. ``All parties - labor, business and government - are duly
represented in that body and it has all the facilities and
mechanisms for dialogue and give and take.''
   In Angeles City, 50 miles north of Manila, the military said
Communist rebels threatened to bomb at least 10 gas stations if
they opened Wednesday.
   Angeles is home to the U.S.-run Clark Air Base, one of the
largest American military facilities overseas. Additional military
checkpoints were set up today in streets near the sprawling
American base.
   ``Information gathered showed that both leftist and rightist
rebels are to launch tactical offensives such as bombings,
kidnappings, killings,'' said police Lt. Col. Julius Yarcia.
   Renegade soldiers are believed to have been involved in at least
38 bombing attacks in the Manila area since August.

   An 80-year-old state legislator arrested
during a protest has pledged to remain behind bars on misdemeanor
charges until gasoline prices drop or he's thrown out of jail,
activists said.
   Avery Alexander, a state representative from New Orleans, was
one of 16 demonstrators arrested for trespassing Sunday after they
linked hands around the gas pumps at an Exxon station.
   All were booked and told they could go free without bond, but
Alexander refused to leave. The charges carry maximum penalties of
a $500 fine and six months in jail.
   Parish jail authorities refused to comment on what they would do
about Alexander, a longtime civil rights activist who was arrested
in 1960 in New Orleans for sitting at a whites-only lunch counter.
   Alexander planned to stay in the parish prison ``until there is
a change in the situation with the gas prices,'' Pat Bryant,
executive director of the Gulf Coast Tenants Organization, said at
a Monday news conference.
   ``Or until they throw him out,'' added John Zippert, head of the
Federation of Southern Cooperatives, based in Epps, Alabama.
   Zippert, Bryant and others have traveled to 30 cities from
Huntsville, Ala., to Baton Rouge, trying to drum up support for a
national protest including picketing at gasoline pumps just prior
to the Nov. 6 elections.
   ``People are fed up with the gas companies. A lot of folks are
fed up with the war. Everybody's fed up with gas prices,'' Bryant
said.
   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2, world oil prices have
fluctuated wildly, soaring at one point to more than $40 a barrel.
Crude oil prices Monday plunged $5.41 a barrel to $28.38 in
reaction to Middle East peace hopes, but analysts said it may take
from three to 14 days for lower prices to show up at the pumps.
   The price of a gallon of gasoline rose 2{ cents in the past two
weeks, reaching a national average of $1.47, according to a survey
released Sunday. The biweekly Lundberg Survey of 13,500 gas
stations indicated prices have risen more than 40 cents a gallon
since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Louis Althusser, one of Europe's most prominent
Marxist philosophers, has died, family friends said today. He was
72.
   Althusser died Monday at La Verriere au Mesnil-Saint-Denis
Hospital south of Paris. No cause of death was given.
   Althusser, who had a history of emotional instability in later
years, was the object of sensationalistic news coverage after he
strangled his wife in 1980 on the premises of the Ecole Normale
Superieur, where he taught.
   In 1981 he was judged mentally incompetent to stand trial and
was hospitalized at a Paris psychiatric facility. He was released
in 1984.
   Althusser was best known for his provocative interpretations of
the works of Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud and Mao Tse-tung.
   He underlined the importance of Marx's view of class struggle as
determining the course of history.
   In ``For Marx,'' published in 1965, he argued that Marx did not
become truly revolutionary until later in life.
   In ``Lenin and Philosophy'' in 1969, Althusser said adopting a
philosophical position was never without political repercussions.
   Philosophy, he once said, was ``the class struggle of the
mind.''
   Althusser joined the French Communist Party in 1948, and though
he never quit, was one of its most outspoken critics. In 1978 he
published a series of articles in the newspaper Le Monde outlining
the party's failings.
   He was born Oct. 16, 1918 in Algiers, and went on to earn
France's highest degree in philosophy.
   The funeral was scheduled for Thursday in Viroflay.

   President Bush, campaigning for
Republican candidates in New England, today defended his support
for unpopular higher taxes and spending cuts. He said the days of
``damn the deficit must come to an end.''
   ``We're hanging tough for a good agreement,'' Bush said,
speaking in one of the most economically hard-pressed regions of
the country. He said he hoped a budget package he can support would
be crafted by congressional negotiators by Wednesday's midnight
deadline.
   ``We've got a sluggish economy out there nationally,'' Bush
said, claiming that a $500-billion, five-year deficit-reduction
plan could help the economy by driving down interest rates.
   He called on Republicans, many of whom oppose his budget stand,
to put ``self interest'' aside and stand with him in support of a
budget plan.
   The ``days of tax and spend and damn the deficit must come to an
end,'' Bush said at the Vermont fundraising breakfast.
   He was introduced by Rep. Peter Smith, R-Vt., who is running for
re-election and who is one of the few Republicans in the House to
have voiced support for a Democratic-drafted deficit-cutting plan
opposed by the administration.
   For his part, Smith said, ``My differences with the
administration are a matter of record.'' He noted his support for
the civil rights bill Bush vetoed on Monday as well as their
differences on the budget.
   However, he praised Bush's support for a package combining tax
increases with spending cuts and said Vermont voters were willing
to pay higher taxes to get the nation out of deficit spending.
   Smith originally supported the tax-increase and spending-cut
plan assembled by the White House and congressional leaders but
later repudiated by the House. When the original bill failed, Smith
announced support for a Democratic-designed bill, which boosted the
tax rate on the highest-income earners and added a surtax for
millionaires. That bill was condemned by the White House.
   ``I wish he'd stop reminding me that we have a few differences
out there,'' Bush said, praising Smith for having an ``independent
mind.''
   Smith's re-election bid is being challenged by former Burlington
Mayor Bernie Sanders, a Socialist.
   Bush claimed Democratic control of both houses of Congress was
to blame for the current budget mess.
   Bush traveled through New England on a small two-engine jet. The
runways at some of his stops were too small to accommodate the
large jumbo jet that he usually uses as Air Force One.
   Outside Bush's first stop, several dozen protesters stood in the
rain carrying banners and shouted at Bush's motorcade urging him
not to go to war over oil in the Persian Gulf.
   ``I saw some of those signs saying no war for oil,'' Bush noted.
He said he could understand the frustrations of the demonstrators.
   But, Bush said, the ``starving of embassies,'' the holding of
hostages and the occupation by Iraq of Kuwait were ``crimes against
humanity.''
   ``There can never be any compromise against this type of
aggression,'' Bush said.
   He compared Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait to Hitler's
occupation of Poland.
   ``It isn't oil we're concerned about. It's aggression. And this
aggression is not going to stand,'' he declared to a sustained
round of applause.
   New England's economy, after being the strongest during the
Reagan years, is now one of the nation's weakest.
   Of the six New England states, the Democratic governors of
Vermont, Massachusetts and Connecticut all opted not to seek
re-election. The Republican governor of Rhode Island was running
far behind his Democratic challenger in the polls and the GOP
governor of Maine was in a tight race with his predecessor.
   The president's first stop was a fund-raising breakfast for the
state GOP in Burlington, Vt. Former Gov. Richard Snelling is
favored to regain the office he gave up six years ago, which would
return Vermont to Republican control.
   Bush also planned to speak at a fund-raising lunch for GOP
Senate candidate Rep. Robert C. Smith in Manchester, N.H.
   Smith was heavily favored to capture the Senate seat being
vacated by fellow conservative Gordon Humphrey. He is challenged by
former Democratic Sen. John Durkin.
   The president planned two campaign appearances in Connecticut.
The first was a reception in Waterbury for GOP House candidate Gary
Franks, who is running for the congressional seat being vacated by
GOP gubernatorial candidate John Rowland. The Democratic challenger
is former Rep. Toby Moffett.
   Moffett gave up his House seat to run unsuccessfully for the
Senate in 1982; he ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1986.
   Bush also was to speak at a fund-raising dinner for Rowland in
Stamford. Rowland is in a three-way race for governor. Former
Republican Sen. Lowell Weicker, running as an independent, is
leading in the polls while Democratic Rep. Bruce Morrison has been
trailing.

   Congressional negotiators struggled today to
resolve their differences over how to raise taxes on the wealthy.
President Bush appealed to Republicans to put aside their
``self-interest'' and line up behind the deficit-cutting plan
taking shape.
   After months of effort, lawmakers appeared to be building toward
agreement on a plan that would raise the gasoline tax, tax the
wealthy and cut programs as diverse as Medicare and farm subsidies.
   Asked if agreement were near, House Democratic Whip Bill Gray
said, ``Who knows, lightning might strike at any moment.''
   Bush's top aides were involved in the talks while the president
campaigned in New England - both for GOP congressional candidates
and for the deficit-cutting deal.
   Bush called on House Republicans, many of whom opposed his
budget stand, to put ``self-interest'' aside and stand with him in
support of a plan. ``We're hanging tough for a good agreement,''
Bush said at a Burlington, Vt., fund-raiser for Republican Rep.
Peter Smith.
   At the Capitol, House Democratic leaders met with their rank and
file to discuss the proposals to raise taxes on the richest
Americans. ``We want to talk to them about how to bring the wealthy
in, what the administration says it wants to do,'' Gray said.
   A dispute over how to raise taxes on Americans with incomes over
$100,000 a year is blocking agreement on the $250 billion
deficit-reduction plan.
   After a full day of on-and-off talks, House Speaker Thomas S.
Foley, D-Wash., said Monday night that bargainers were on the brink
of agreement.
   ``Not yet,'' Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,
replied when asked whether a tentative agreement had been reached.
   Time is short. The government will run out of money at midnight
Wednesday and there are doubts President Bush will sign a third
stopgap spending bill unless a deficit agreement is ready. In
addition, Congress is eager to adjourn this week for the year.
   By all accounts, the biggest obstacle to signing a pact was
choosing between Democrats' insistence on a surtax on high-income
taxpayers and a Republican proposal to limit their itemized
deductions.
   Whatever option is chosen would be added to a plan that
tentatively would raise the top tax rate on the nation's wealthiest
from the current 28 percent to 31 percent. That would represent a
major concession for Bush.
   Part of the money drawn from the wealthy would be used to scale
down the 9{-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax increase passed by the
Senate and to moderate proposed increases in Medicare patient
costs.
   The deficit bill would raise taxes on tobacco, alcoholic
beverages and airplane tickets and levy a new luxury tax on part of
the price of expensive cars, boats, planes, furs and jewels. The
measure would considerably reduce Medicare reimbursement of
physicians and hospitals.
   People whose wages exceed $51,300 a year would pay a higher tax
for Medicare. Farm subsidies would be reduced; some fees for
federal services would go up. The tax and Medicare package would,
when added to spending restraints on most government programs and
reduced interest payments, reduce the budget deficit by about $500
billion over the next five years.
   Both the Senate bill and the House version would require
upper-income people to pay a heavy share of the tax increase.
   The administration is adamantly opposed to the surtax, saying it
would amount to another tax-rate increase on those with higher
incomes. Bush's negotiators and Senate Republicans say a limitation
on deductions would be much fairer.
   House Democratic leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri said after
the session Monday night that the surtax was still on the table.
Others involved in the discussions, including Sen. Bob Packwood of
Oregon, senior Republican on the Finance Committee, said that
option was all but dead.
   The Democrats' surtax would require the 35,000 people with
taxable incomes - after deductions and exemptions - above $1
million a year to pay an additional levy of as much as 10 percent.
A person who pays $300,000 in tax, for example, would have to pay
an extra $30,000.
   The Republican substitute would limit itemized deductions
available to the 2.2 million couples and individuals with adjusted
gross incomes over $100,000. One version would permit a person to
write off only 95 percent of otherwise allowable deductions against
that portion of income over $100,000.
   Thus, a person would give up $500 of deductions for each $10,000
that his or her income exceeds $100,000. The limit would not apply
to deductions for medical expenses, investment interest or casualty
or theft losses.
   Democrats from populous states, especially California and New
York, have criticized the limitation on the ground it discriminates
against states with high taxes.
   The House Ways and Means Committee staff, in an explanation
prepared for the Democratic Caucus, said the limitation is based
solely on the taxpayer's income - not deductions - and thus would
not place an unfair burden on residents of any state.
   Nevertheless, the proposal is being fought by organized
charities and the housing industry on the assumption that limiting
deductions would cut incentives for giving and home buying.

<HEAD>U.S. Supreme Court Intervenes in Cook County Battle over Third
Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nov. 6 election for Cook County offices is in
limbo while the U.S. Supreme Court decides whether to allow
candidates from the Harold Washington Party to run.
   ``We ain't running this election anymore,'' Cook County Clerk
Stanley Kusper said at a news conference Monday. ``The Supreme
Court of the United States is running it, and all we can do is wait
until they tell us what to do.''
   With just two weeks until the election, Justice John Paul
Stevens on Monday halted further printing and distribution of
ballots, saying the full court should hear a dispute over
candidates from the third-party named for Chicago's first black
mayor.
   Justices may take up the issue Friday.
   The ballots were being printed without the names of 19
candidates on the Washington Party, representing some blacks
disenchanted with the Democratic Party. The county includes Chicago
and some suburban areas.
   The Illinois Supreme Court voted 4-3 on Oct. 12 that the party
was not entitled to appear on the ballot because of insufficient
nominating petitions. The court majority was made up of Democratic
justices.
   Stevens stayed that Illinois Supreme Court order and allowed
election preparations to proceed. But ballots already had been
printed without the Washington Party slate.
   ``Our people tell us if they have to start from scratch doing
the ballot it would be impossible to hold the election on Nov. 6,''
said Tom Leach, a spokesman for the Chicago Board of Elections.
   Election officials from the city and suburban Cook County said
they stopped further ballot printing and delivery of voting
equipment and suspended absentee voting, which officially began
Monday.
   Jim Hutchinson, the party's vice chairman, said members won't
commen on Stevens' order because they haven't discussed it with
their lawyers.
   ``We don't know what all this means, and we don't want to offend
the court by saying anything,'' Hutchinson said.
   The legal action challenging the candidates was begun by five
petitioners who Washington Party officials contend were acting for
the county Democratic Party. George Leighton, the attorney for that
group, said he would seek to have Stevens' stay overturned.
   Harold Washington, the city's first black mayor, died Nov. 25,
1987, after suffering a heart attack.

   A disabled federal official who left
in a huff when an ambulance met him at the airport on his last
visit to Jacksonville returned to an apology and a key to the city.
   Evan Kemp, chairman of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, was to speak to a national human rights conference in
July but never left the airport.
   Kemp, who has muscular dystrophy and uses an electric-powered
wheelchair to get around, promptly returned to Washington when an
ambulance, instead of a wheelchair-accessible van was sent to pick
him up.
   His aides said he didn't want to endure the pain and humiliation
of lying in an ambulance for the trip downtown.
   Monday, on his second trip to Jacksonville, Kemp was the keynote
speaker at a conference on disabilities. This time, a van met him
at the airport. Once at the conference, he was given apologies and
the key to the city by Mayor Tommy Hazouri.
   Kemp said he found downtown Jacksonville to be ``very, very
accessible'' to wheelchairs.

<TEXT>
   In a conciliatory move aimed
at ending black factional fighting, the African National Congress
has proposed a meeting between Nelson Mandela and rival black
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
   In its statement Monday, the ANC backed down from months of
resistance to a Mandela-Buthelezi meeting. It did not say when the
two should meet, only that such a meeting should take place in the
``near future.''
   Zulus loyal to Buthelezi's conservative Inkatha Freedom Party
have been involved in bloody battles with ANC supporters since the
mid-1980s.
   Buthelezi said he welcomed the invitation for a meeting, which
he said Inkatha had been pursuing ``for some time now.''
   Mandela, who is visiting Australia, said today he hoped the
meeting would ease tensions. Violence between ANC and Inkatha in
black townships around Johannesburg has claimed about 800 lives
since early August.
   ``Future meetings are important,'' Mandela told a news
conference in Canberra. ``You create a new atmosphere, an
atmosphere of hope. The meeting raises the hope of a peaceful
resolution.''
   Mandela said he had presented evidence of government complicity
in the violence to the Australian Cabinet that included affidavits
from witnesses. But such evidence has not been shown to his
government because people who have spoken out in the past ``have
been harassed,'' he said.
   Later, Mandela became angry when Australian radio attempted to
set up a surprise live telephone conversation between him and
Buthelezi. Mandela was sitting in the studio after finishing a
radio interview when Buthelezi was introduced via a telephone
hookup.
   ``In fairness, you should have told me,'' Mandela said before
returning to his hotel. He did not speak to Buthelezi.
   If a meeting takes place, it would be the first between Mandela
and Buthelezi since Mandela's release in February from 27 years in
prison.
   The two were scheduled to meet earlier this year but Mandela
canceled under pressure from the ANC, which felt the talks would
enhance Buthelezi's stature.
   The ANC later proposed that Buthelezi attend a meeting with
other black homeland leaders, but Buthelezi turned down the
invitation because he wanted to attend as the Inkatha leader rather
than in his capacity as head of the KwaZulu homeland.
   The ANC opposes the homeland system, saying it is part of the
apartheid system. But Inkatha sees the homeland system as an
interim step to black rule in South Africa.
   Both groups oppose apartheid, but Inkatha disagrees with ANC
support of boycotts, strikes and other protests to fight it.
Inkatha has also accssed the ANC of trying to speak for all blacks
in South Africa.
   Under apartheid, the black majority has no voice in national
affairs.
   Inkatha and the ANC have held periodic talks, but Mandela and
Buthelezi have not attended, and each side has blamed the other for
the surge in factional fighting.
   Until August, the violence had been limited mainly to Natal
Province, where about 5,000 blacks have died since 1986.
   The ANC had accused Buthelezi of orchestrating the latest
violence to force a meeting with Mandela and enhance his stature.
   Almost all Inkatha supporters are Zulus, while the ANC draws
support across tribal lines.

<TEXT>
   Iowa and Nebraska were the only states to post
declines in personal incomes in the second quarter of 1990,
although income growth slowed throughout the nation, the Commerce
Department said today.
   A study by the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis showed
personal income for the nation grew only 1.3 percent, down from 2.1
percent in the first quarter.
   The slowdown in income growth mirrored the economy as a whole.
The department reported earlier the gross national product - the
nation's total output of goods and eervices - slowed from 1.7
percent in the first quarter to just 0.4 percent in the second.
   Personal incomes dropped 2.3 percent in Iowa and 0.4 percent in
Nebraska. By region, the Plains states - including both states -
posted the slowest growth, just 0.3 percent compared to 1.9 percent
in the first quarter.
   The Far West, Great Lakes and Rocky Mountain regions each
recorded 1.6 percent gains. But the Far West growth was down from
3.2 percent in the January-March period; the Great Lakes was
unchanged and the Rocky Mountain region up from 1.4 percent.
   Personal incomes grew 1.3 percent in both the Mideast and the
Southwest, both of which had advanced 1.7 percent in the first
quarter. They increased 1.2 percent in the Southeast, down from 2.7
percent from January through March. New England's income growth was
unchanged at a 0.9 percent.
   Both declines in construction payrolls and farm incomes
contributed to the drop in personal income in the Plains states and
slower increases in each of the Southeastern states.
   The Far West experienced a decline in durables manufacturing and
a slowdown in payroll gains in transportation, communications and
public utilities. All area states had slowdowns in income growth.
   In the Southwest, the slower income growth reflected declines in
durables manufacturing and farm income. Personal income slowed
throughout the region except for New Mexico.
   In the Mideast, declining payrolls in the construction,
transportation, communications and public utilities payrolls
contributed to the slower growth. All Mideast states except New
Jersey had second-quarter income growth slowdowns.

<HEAD>Former General Accuses KGB of `Legal Gangsterism'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former KGB general accused the spy agency of
``legal gangsterism'' today as he battled in court to regain his
rank and pension, which were stripped after he publicly criticized
the KGB.
   Oleg Kalugin, whose 32-year career with the KGB included 12
years as an agent in the United States, is suing KGB Chairman
Vladimir Kryuchkov in a landmark case for Soviet citizens aggrieved
by government actions.
   Kalugin's fight has made him a popular hero and helped him win a
seat in the national legislature.
   The three-judge panel in Moscow City Court repeatedl had to
call for order as spectators applauded Kalugin's lawyer and heckled
a KGB attorney.
   ``Oh my, we've hurt the KGBs feelings, isn't that too bad,'' an
elderly woman called out sarcastically after the KGB lawyer, Victor
I. Alexeyev, complained about the crowd.
   Kalugin's suit contends that Kryuchkov issued secret orders
depriving him of his rank and pension in retaliation for his
comments in June. In those remarks, Kalugin said the KGB was
resisting democratic reforms and continuing to spy on trade unions,
clergymen and other possible opponents of the Communist Party.
   After listening to his arguments today, the judges adjourned the
case until Nov. 11. They said they were waiting for answers to
questions sent last month to the Council of Ministers, or national
Cabinet, and military prosecutor's office.
   The court had asked the Council of Ministers to provide
documents about how, when and why the decision was made to strip
Kalugin of his rank, which led to loss of his pension.
   The military prosecutor was asked to describe the status of a
possible criminal lawsuit against Kalugin. Soviet newspapers have
said the prosecutor was investigating Kalugin on a potential charge
of revealing state secrets.
   The 55-year-old Kalugin has said he once headed the KGB's
section on foreign counterintelligence. He has denied revealing any
national secrets.
   ``I think Kryuchkov's actions represent not only arbitrary rule
against me, personally, but also a form of legal gangsterism, and I
can't call it anything else,'' Kalugin told the court.
   The KGB attorney and the head of the agency's financial planning
office said at the hearing the decision to deprive Kalugin of his
rank was made by the Council of Ministers, and the loss of his
pension followed automatically.
   Kalugin's attorney, Boris A. Kuznetsov, argued that the
13-member Council of Ministers never met to consider Kalugin's
case. He said the order was signed by Prime Minister Nikolai I.
Ryzhkov, at the behest of Kryuchkov.
   He said documents later were fabricated to make it look as
though the full council had approved the decision.
   Kalugin has filed a related separate suit against Ryzhkov.

   A company that supplies animals for
scientific research today denied an ABC News report that it
inhumanely kills cats.
   ABC reported Monday that Carolina Biological Supply Co. falsely
tells customers it acquires only dead cats from animal shelters.
The network said the company actually operates gas chambers in
which it kills nearly 200 cats a week.
   The network aired videotape shot by People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals that showed cats being pushed into a gas
chamber. The report quoted an employee whose identity was disguised
as saying that some cats survive the gas, only to be drowned or to
die on an embalming table.
   ``The allegations made last night on ABC's `World News Tonight'
against Carolina Biological Supply Company are unfair distortions
of the company's practices in dealing with animal specimens which
have been taken out of context to suggest cruel treatment of
animals,'' company spokesman Ron Field said.
   Field said the company in the past allowed licensed animal
dealers to use its euthanasia chamber to kill cats it then bought,
but the U.S. Department of Agriculture told the company it would
have to change its procedures.
   Carolina Biological Supply no longer allows live animals on its
property, he said.
   The company is one of the world's largest suppliers of animals
for scientific research.

<TEXT>
   NASA astronauts had three close calls while
flying jet aircraft since May of 1989 and the National
Transportation Safety Board said today the agency should correct
problems ``before other dangerous situations are created.''
   The NTSB said at a hearing that an astronaut passed close to a
Pan Am World Airways airbus flying from Dulles International
Airport near Washington in May of 1989.
   In September of 1989 a NASA T-38 jet passed within 3.1 miles of
a small civilian aircraft.
   And last May another NASA jet passed within three miles of an
Eastern Airlines DC-9 near Paducah, Ky.
   NASA pilots in all three instances were astronauts, but the NTSB
did not immediately identify them.
   In the recommendations, the board stated that ``NASA must
implement changes to its T-38 flight program to reduce the
potential for human error. NASA should also recognize and correct
factors that contribute to the cause of such errors before other
dangerous situations are created.''
   The board recommended that NASA astronauts fly with an
additional crew member aboard the jets when landing or taking off
in busy airport areas. The board also recommended that NASA
instruct its pilots to write down instructions given by civilian
flight controllers.
   And the board recommended that the equipment on board the jets
be modernized to include more safety features.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Ray Mabus has ordered the Mississippi
National Guard to convene a court-martial of its top officer for
buying land in the path of a training area expansion.
   The military trial, the first against a Mississippi National
Guard officer, will decide if Adjutant General Arthur Farmer should
be disciplined for his participation in the August 1989 purchase of
5 acres of land near Camp Shelby.
   The governor's office contends Farmer got inside information on
expansion plans fo the large National Guard training facility and
purchased the land in order to make a profit.
   The land deal was an ``apparent conflict of interest which
should have been avoided'' a military investigator concluded in a
just-released report.
   In a telephone interview Monday from his home in Crystal
Springs, Farmer said a hearing could take place as early as this
weekend.
   ``I think I will be cleared if I get a fair trial ... once they
see all the evidence,'' he said. ``It's some more harassment. I'm
not going to quit. The more they push me in the corner, the more
I'm going to buck up.''
   Mabus stripped Farmer of day-to-day control of the National
Guard in February after reports surfaced that Farmer and two
partners purchased the land next to the base south of Hattiesburg.
   The purchase came eight months after the military proposed to
expand Camp Shelby into the DeSoto National Forest.
   In his 15-page report, military investigator and Gulfport lawyer
Wade Baine said Farmer ``took great pains to show that he resold
the property to the other co-purchasers at a loss. The loss was
$1.''
   The investigator's report, based on three summertime hearings,
noted the individuals named by Farmer as the co-purchasers were
``subordinates of the adjutant general.'' Farmer's partners were
not identified in the report.
   Farmer, who continues to draw his $50,400 annual salary, said he
was served the court-martial document Monday.
   ``The governor sets the judge, jury and the rules to play by,''
Farmer said. ``My attorney will go down to Camp Shelby ... to meet
with the judge, prosecutor and others to see what rules we are
going to play by.''
   Farmer, 57, said the allegations against him are not covered by
specific penalties in the Mississippi Code of Military Justice and
``I have no idea what they are looking at ... a fine or whatever.''
   ``I am still the adjutant general and I can be removed only by
the Senate. Really, the proper way to have done it is to bring me
before the Senate on the charges and I don't think he (Mabus) had
anything that would stand up there.''

   Rain fell across parts of the East today, and thunderstorms in
North Carolina spawned at least one tornado that overturned a
mobile home and uprooted trees.
   In South Carolina, a man was killed today when his car fell off
a collapsed bridge span.
   The storm system is the same one that brought a foot of snow to
the Rockies last week.
   High wind and heavy rain in South Carolina forced the evacuation
of 20 families from a mobile home park, injured at least five
people and flooded roads under several feet of water across the
state, authorities said.
   The tornado touched down in a mobile home park in Newport, N.C.,
officials said. ``Nobody was hurt or anything. They were just shook
up,'' said a dispatcher with the Newport police department.
   Wind damage was reported elsewhere in North Carolina, including
a roof blown off a frame house and two mobile homes shifted off
their foundations in Hoke County northeast of Raeford, the
sheriff's department reported.
   Heavy rain flooded some low-lying areas. In McAdenville in
Gaston County, 4{ inches of rain fell over 18 hours in the Catawba
River basin. In Rowan County, several bridges and portions of roads
were under water. In Yadkin County, water opened a 4-foot-wide,
20-foot-deep hole in U.S. 421.
   Twenty-four-hour rainfall totals in South Carolina included 4.85
inches at Chesterfield, 3.53 at Johnston, 3.82 at Lockhart and 3.98
at Sumter, the weather service said.
   Temperatures were expected to reach the 50s in the northern
Plains and Upper Great Lakes; the 60s in the East, Midwest and
Pacific Northwest, and the 70s and 80s in the South and Southwest.
   The high temperature for the nation Monday was 93 degrees at
Fort Myers, Fla.

<HEAD>Mayor Cuts His Salary, Other Managers 5 Percent</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor David Dinkins has slashed salaries for the
top brass at City Hall by 5 percent because of the city's fiscal
crisis and is calling on other elected officials and agency heads
to follow suit.
   The top officials also will no longer be able to count on
automatic annual raises. Beginning July 1, managerial-level raises
will be tied to individual performance, rather than the rate of
inflation or increases granted to city unions.
   ``It's further evidence of the dire fiscal circumstances in
which we find ourselves,'' Dinkins said Monday in announcing the
pay cut for himself and nearly 700 other bureaucrats. He is paid
$130,000 a year and is taking a $6,500 pay cut.
   Dinkins expects to save more than $4 million through the cuts
and by freezing salaries for 4,000 other managerial employees. The
reductions and freeze will remain in effect at least until June 30,
the end of the current fiscal year.
   Falling revenues - mostly lower tax collections blamed on
economic recession - created a $1.8 billion gap in the current
fiscal year, which started July 1990. The current budget is $28
billion. A $1.4 billion gap looms in the next fiscal year.
   City Council Speaker Peter Vallone and Council President Andrew
Stein said they also will take 5 percent pay cuts. Vallone makes
$90,000 annually and Stein makes $105,000.
   ``In this time of fiscal constraint, it is important that all
New Yorkers are willing to accept some sacrifice and to pull
together for the good of the city,'' Vallone said.
   City employees covered by union contracts will not be affected.
   Dinkins said he also was asking the city's district attorneys,
borough presidents, special narcotics prosecutor and mayoral
appointees on various boards to impose similar reductions on
themselves.
   Dinkins' reduction would apply to 44 senior level managers in
City Hall including the five deputy mayors, the corporation
counsel, his press secretary and all other mayoral managerial
employees earning at least $70,000. The cuts also would apply to 60
commissioners, 140 deputy commissioners and 202 assistant
commissioners.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T To Raise Long-Distance Rates.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph is raising its
basic night and weekend long-distance telephone rates by 2.2
percent effective Nov. 2.
   The company said Monday that overall its out-of-state
direct-dialed long-distance rates have gone down about 42 percent
since the breakup of the Bell System in 1984.
   An official of the Consumer Federation of America, however, said
today that while daytime rates used heavily by businesses have gone
down, the night and weekend rates used more often by householders
have increased.
   ``Something is wrong. This is not supposed to happen,'' said
Gene Kimmelman, legislative director and telephone analyst for the
federation. ``It may be just a couple percent but it shows that the
policy is messed up.''
   Kimmelman said the consumer group may petition the Federal
Communications Commission for review of its relaxed regulatory
procedures, adopted 15 months ago, under which approval of the
increase is expected.
   The company said the increase will result in about $39.4 million
in increased annual revenue - about five cents on an average $16
monthly long-distance bill.
   AT&amp;T said the increase applies only to out-of-state,
direct-dialed long distance calls made during night and weekend
hours.
   These are after 11 p.m. Sunday through Friday and all weekend
until 5 p.m. Sunday.
   ``This indicates, I think, that the long distance market is not
uniformly competitive, at least in this area, and At&amp;T thinks it
can raise prices without losing business,'' Kimmelman said.
``Obviously they also think this isn't the most profitable business
to have or they wouldn't take a risk of raising prices.''
   ``Rather than seeing everybody benefit from relaxed regulation,
the consumers are going to be paying the price,'' Kimmelman said.

<HEAD>Regulators Seeking $30 Million From Former CenTrust Chief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators are seeking $30.8 million
in restitution from the former chairman of the failed CenTrust Bank
of Miami, but a lawyer says the executive doesn't have the money
and will fight the government's action.
   Officials of the Office of Thrift Supervision on Monday accused
David L. Paul of ``insatiable vanity and greed'' contributing to
the collapse of CenTrust, once the biggest savings and loan
institution in the Southeast. The failure will cost taxpayers an
estimated $1.7 billion.
   Paul will ``vigorously contest'' the regulators' demand for
restitution, his attorney, Aubrey Harwell, said in a telephone
interview.
   ``I would find it hard to believe'' that Paul would be able to
put up the money, Harwell said. He said he hadn't yet seen the
government's order against Paul.
   The attorney said Paul is in Israel but he is not there to evade
regulatory action and is expected to return soon.
   ``He will be back and we will respond on his behalf,'' Harwell
said.
   Earlier, at a news conference, the OTS officials said they would
go to a federal court in Miami to compel Paul to pay the money if
he refused to do so by Nov. 1.
   Paul used CenTrust depositors' funds for such excesses as $29
million in paintings, a yacht costing $233,000, 24-karat gold leaf
ceilings and gold-plated bathroom plumbing, the officials said.
Many of the assets were later sold at significant losses by the
government, which took over CenTrust last February.
   The OTS officials said the $30.8 million sought from Paul ranks
second only to the government's $40 million case against Charles H.
Keating Jr., the former owner of the failed Lincoln Savings and
Loan Association of Irvine, Calif.
   Like Keating, Paul was a heavy contributor to political
candidates. He contributed to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee while Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., was its chairman.
   The contributions have become a key issue in the election race
between Kerry and his Republican challenger, Jim Rappaport. A
spokesman for Kerry, Michael Meehan, said today that Kerry's
campaign has not received any money from Paul directly.
   ``Initiation of this case represents another milestone in this
agency's efforts to bring to justice those believed to have
contributed directly through fraud to the failure of S&amp;Ls in this
country,'' said OTS Director Timothy Ryan. ``The days of high
living at taxpayer expense have ended.''
   Ryan and other OTS officials said their order also bars Paul
from selling or transferring any assets of more than $5,000. In
addition, Paul is required to submit within five days a statement
identifying all his assets outside the United States and detailing
his net worth.
   ``Evidence exists that Paul diverted millions of dollars (of
CenTrust funds) offshore and that he personally engaged in
securities and commodities trading overseas,'' the OTS said.
   The agency, which is part of the Treasury Department, also is
seeking an order that would prohibit Paul from working for any
savings and loan.
   Among the items regulators are seeking in restitution:
   -$15 million from a fund set up by CenTrust to pay legal fees in
lawsuits filed against Paul and other directors.
   -$4.9 million diverted to a special retirement plan created
mainly for Paul. The assets of the plan were transferred out of the
country and managed by Edward D.G. Davies, a British financier and
former CenTrust director who also is named in the OTS order.
   -$515,000 in premiums paid by CenTrust on Paul's $6 million life
insurance policies. The beneficiary was Paul's wife rather than
CenTrust, the beneficiary authorized by CenTrust's board of
directors.
   -$456,900 paid by CenTrust for a security system and guards at
Paul's home from January 1987 through February 1990.
   -A bonus and salary increase of $393,000 paid to Paul in October
1989 following a fiscal year when CenTrust had a $119 million net
loss and had been ordered by regulators to stop paying dividends to
shareholders.
   -Design consulting services costing $300,000 and diverted to
Paul for the design of his home and $233,000 yacht, the
``Bodacious.'' The government lost $100,000 when it later sold the
yacht.

   Humphrey the wandering humpback whale is
back, this time stuck in shallows about 200 feet from shore, where
rescuers tossed water to keep his skin moist and waited for high
tide today to free him.
   The 40-foot whale, who captured the hearts of millions in 1985
when he spent 25 days lost in the bay and Sacramento Delta before
swimming back to the Pacific, beached himself Monday. Scientists
recognized him from his tail markings.
   The whale was still stranded near a rock this morning after
rescuers tried for three hours to free him.
   Volunteers used 12-foot boards and a rope to try to get the
whale back into the water. They even used a boat to try to tow him
back into chilly San Francisco Bay - all to no avail.
   Amid whipping wind, volunteers from the Marine Mammal Center
worked to keep the wrong-way whale safe.
   ``He's immobilized,'' said Marc Webber, the center's science
administrator. ``We're using pumps, buckets and towels to keep him
wet. His body heats up when its out of the water. And there's his
great weight. The great mass could crush his bones and organs.''
   Denize Springer, a center spokeswoman, said as the tide starting
rising early today, ``He still seems to be in very good shape. He
made it through the worst time of the night real well.''
   But a problem faced by volunteers was that Humphrey was not
going along with rescue efforts.
   ``The fact is the animal didn't help us at all. He's not
budging,'' Springer said.
   Volunteers plan to mount another rescue effort, this time
possibly using a crane, at high tide this afternoon, she said.
   Humphrey's troubles began Monday morning when he blundered onto
mud flats near Candlestick Park. Traffic on a highway nearby was
snarled for hours as commuters stopped to gawk. Humphrey finally
floated off at high tide, only to get stuck again close to a nearby
rock.
   Peigin Barrett, another mammal center spokeswoman, said it
didn't appear that Humphrey was injured by the rocks. She said
illness might have led the whale to beach himself.
   Those keeping watch overnight included Sharnel Jackson, 14, who
recalled the whale's visit in October 1985.
   ``We had a big banner in class with Humphrey's name on it,'' she
said as she lifted the collar of her jacket against the cold. ``I
know Humphrey. I want to see him get free.''
   ``I thought the chance of seeing him again in the bay would be
real slim,'' said Kenneth Belcomb of the Center for Whale Research
in Washington. Belcomb, who was on the scene Monday, has followed
Humphrey's exploits since 1985.
   Scientists speculated that the whale made a wrong turn that year
on his annual migration through the bay.
   Rescuers used everything from underwater explosives to recorded
whale sounds to try to get Humphrey to turn around, spending about
$50,000 in state and federal money.
   During that visit, Humphrey was watched by legions of joyful
fans. The whale became the subject of songs, poems, books and, of
course, a T-shirt.
   Since then, Humphrey has been spotted in the ocean near San
Francisco every August or September.

<HEAD>Daughter's Sex-Abuse Suit Jeopardized by Lawyers Copying Notebook</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGOR, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for a woman suing her parents over
alleged physical and sexual abuse during her childhood have
admitted copying a notebook containing the defense lawyers' trial
strategy.
   ``The ramifications of this situation are of great proportions
and great seriousness,'' Superior Court Justice Herbert T. Silsby
II said Monday as he scheduled a hearing next week to determine if
the trial should proceed.
   The trial has consumed three weeks and was expected to last two
more.
   Joanne Goldman, 28, of Brewer, sued for $10 million in damages
for alleged physical and sexual abuse by her father, Sol I.
Goldman, throughout her childhood and early adulthood at their home
in New York City and their vacation home in Eastbrook, Maine.
   The lawsuit alleges her mother, Gladys L. Goldman, failed to
meet her responsibility to stop the alleged abuse.
   Both parents have denied the allegations.
   Silsby abruptly halted testimony in the case Friday, but the
reason did not become clear until the lawyers returned for a
hearing Monday. One of the plaintiff's lawyers, Elizabeth Kelly
Ebitz, said she had inadvertently picked up the defense lawyers'
notebook after it was left on the plaintiff's table. She admitted
copying it.
   ``We did engage in improper conduct,'' said Ebitz's associate,
Judith Thornton.
   One of the team of attorneys representing the parents, Jules
Mogul, said today he plans to call four or five witnesses at the
hearing on whether the trial should continue.
   ``The whole story should come out,'' Mogul said, adding that he
was confident the judge would stop the trial.
   ``I doubt that the case could continue under the
circumstances,'' he said.
   Ebitz did not immediately return a telephone message at her
Bangor law office this morning.

<TEXT>
   Government leaders said today that a
deep pessimism has taken hold in Hungary because of economic
problems that have overshadowed the democratic reforms the nation
has implemented.
   The leaders spoke at a ceremonial meeting of Parliament
commemorating the 34th anniverary of Hungary's 1956 revolution, the
bloodiest in the Soviet bloc.
   Speakers at the session drew parallels between the mood of
apathy now and after the uprising was crushed by Soviet tanks.
   ``We are fighting against a lack of self-confidence,'' said
Parliament Speaker Gyoergy Szabad.
   ``Today, when the country is living through difficult hours,
when Hungary is not only suffering from its legacy but new pains
and disappointments ... let us remember 1956,'' Prime Minister
Jozsef Antall told the assembly.
   He called on all parties to ``fight poverty and keep the germ of
apathy from contaminating our people.''
   The revolt was the most violent of several uprisings across
Eastern Europe during the four decades of Soviet domination.
   On Oct. 23, 1956, mass student demonstrations calling for
greater democracy, a multiparrawal of Soviet
troops quickly escalated into armed clashes with Hungarian secret
police and Soviet troops.
   The revolt ended 12 days later after Soviet tanks rumbled into
the Hungarian capital and suppressed the resistance.
   Official figures put the dead at 5,000 to 6,000, with 12,000
wounded. Western estimates said up to 32,000 people died and
200,000 fled the country.
   This spring Hungarian voters realized the dreams of the
revolutionaries of 1956 and elected a free government that was
directed to replace Hungary's Soviet-style command economy with a
free-market system.
   Last year - their spirits lifted with the prospects of
approaching democracy - more than 100,000 people held an emotional
torchlight rally to mark the uprising.
   But the optimism that marked that rally appeared to be absent
this year.
   Burdened by a debt of more than $20 billion  the highest per
capita in the former Soviet bloc - Hungarians see their economy in
disarray.
   Inadequate social services, mounting unemployment, a daunting
housing crisis and an infrastructure at least 20 years behind that
in Western societies have added to the gloom.
   Pessimism prevails despite the fulfillment in the last two years
of most demands voiced by the 1956 demonstrators. They include:
   -The withdrawal of all Soviet troops, which is scheduled for
completion by June 1991.
   -Free elections held in March and April.
   -The right to strike, granted two years ago by reform Communists
who engineered the nation's peaceful transformation into a
democracy.
   -Freedom of expression and of the media, which is now
guaranteed.
   -Economic reform, which presently is taking place.
   -A thorough review of ties with Moscow. Relations with the
Soviet Union have been redefined on the basis of equality.
   Those attending the parliamentary session included Vytautas
Landsbergis, president of the independent-minded Soviet republic of
Lithuania. He was invited to Hungary by the Federation of Hungarian
Political Prisoners.
   His presence in the legislature was an indirect reminder of the
value Budapest places on maintaining some distance to Moscow.
   ``I work as an accountant, and I can tell you that my firm's
situation ... is shaky, indeed almost hopeless,'' Karoly Petrovics
told a reporter.
   ``I just don't know how I am going to keep the family going next
year,'' said Petrovics, a 27-year-old father of two.
   Relatively few people attended wreath-laying ceremonies to
fallen revolutionaries at several different venues, in a further
indication of the general mood of resignation.

   A boat carrying about 100 passengers,
mostly women and children, capsized over the weekend and
authorities fear more than 50 people drowned, Lagos newspapers
reported Tuesday.
   The accident occurred Sunday during a rainstorm in the oil-rich
midwestern coastal region, the papers said.
   Police said they were investigating reports the boat was
overloaded. No other details were immediately available.
   Several similar mishaps have been reported on Nigeria's coast in
recent years. Authorities say over-crowding has contributed to most
of them.

   Sweden's bureaucrats will start

   ``A bureaucrat works a lot with laws and contracts and is very
much controlled, which stops him from really opening up,'' said
Ulla-Christin Svensson, whose humor courses will be offered through
the Federation of Civil Servants.
   She said the courses will start in November and several

   Two limestone pits collapsed and buried 10
peasants who were sent inside to retrieve tools, and officials held
out little hope Tuesday for their survival after a week
underground.
   The Nanfang Daily newspaper in the southeastern city of Canton
said the 195-foot-deep pits collapsed Oct. 16. It said rescuers
were unable to help the buried peasants because the collapse
triggered a landslide from a nearby hill that was continuing to
pile dirt on the site a week later.
   The newspaper, contacted by telephone, said the pits had been
shut down because the owner, Liu Yumin, was operating without a
license. However, when he detected that the walls were about to
collapse, he hired 10 local peasants to go in and remove the mining
tools.
   Most mines in China are state-owned and operated. Some local
governments have tolerated private mining but such operations often
are relatively primitive.
   Thousands of Chinese are killed in accidents at state and
private mines each year.

   At least 16 people have died in
flooding from rains that devastated areas of central Vietnam, the
official Vietnam News Agency reported Tuesday.
   The provinces of Quang Nam-Danang and Thua Thien-Hue were
especially hard hit by tropical storm Lola from Oct. 12-16, said
the report, monitored in Bangkok.
   It said total rainfall reached 31.5 inches in some areas of
Quang Nam-Danang, ``where all rivers swelled to the highest levels
ever seen in the past 10 years and many areas were submerged.''
   Hardest hit was the province's Hoi An town, which was two yards
under water.
   The report said nine people died in Quang Nam-Danang, where
damage to property and crops was widespread.
   It said seven people died in Thua Thien-Hue, where 110,200
houses were submerged.

<HEAD>Bailout Plan Pushes Disputes Into Single Federal Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Confusion over the wording of last year's
thrift industry bailout plan has resulted in a small flood of
lawsuits into a single federal court in Washington.
   The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act
mandated that any lawsuit involving a financially troubled savings
and loan firm must be handled in federal court.
   One paragraph of the law said federal courts - plural - have
jurisdiction over those lawsuits. But two paragraphs later, another
provision says the Resolution Trust Corp., which handles the
thrifts, must move the lawsuits to U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia.
   Michael Tucci, the RTC senior counsel, said a half-dozen federal
judges across the country have interpreted the law to say that any
time the agency wants to move a case into federal court, it has to
go to Washington.
   So far, 72 lawsuits have been transferred. But there are
thousands of suits nationwide involving defunct thrifts.
   Tucci said the number of cases in the court now ``is pretty
small, considering what's coming.''
   The additional cases could have a significant impact on the
civil court docket, because judges said they already are busy
handling a dramatic increase in criminal cases arising from the
district's drug problems.
   ``I'd be a fool to think (judges and litigants) are happy,'' he
said. ``But we've been given a law to work with, and we work with
it the best way we can.''
   Barbara Timmer, general counsel for the House Banking Committee,
who helped draft the law, said she was surprised the paragraphs
were an issue. The clauses were intended to give RTC lawyers a
choice of which federal court to move a case to, not to limit them
to federal court in Washington, she said.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley S. Harris has asked the
Administrative Office of the Courts to consider asking the law's
sponsors to amend its wording. A spokeswoman for the administrative
office, Cathy Ball, said the office was sympathetic, but it was
unclear what can be done. Timmer said she knew of no such pending
legislation.
   Tucci said his agency was happy in many instances to have cases
heard in federal courts elsewhere, but that the 1989 law requires
the agency to move the cases to federal court here before that can
be done. In other instances, he said, the RTC would rather try a
case here.
   ``In some cases that's terribly inconvenient, and in some cases
it's not,'' he said. ``We look at each one on a case-by-case
basis.''

<HEAD>14 Americans Leave Baghdad For Jordan</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Saudi diplomat summoned to State
Department, says Kuwait calls the shots in the crisis. TRIMS. No

<BYLINE>By ANDREA HAMILTON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Fourteen Americans left the Iraqi capital for Jordan today after
being freed by Saddam Hussein's government. They departed as
Britain worked to gain the release of 50 sick or elderly Britons.
   ``I was waiting for this moment. I am extremely happy, but sad
at the same time because I am leaving many of my friends and
colleagues,'' Jack Fraser, one of the freed Americans, told an
Associated Press reporter in Baghdad.
   Fraser, 53, of Santa Ana, Calif., worked for a construction
company and had been held in a diplomatic compound in Baghdad.
   Another freed American, 44-year-old John Thompson, said: ``I was
in Iraq for the last four years, working on a Baghdad city master
plan.''
   Thompson said he was eager to see his 68-year-old mother, Lilo
Thompson of Frankfurt, Germany, because she is going blind. ``She
had a retinal separation and the stress that I'm stuck in Iraq had
caused her a heart attack,'' he said. ``I'm her only child and she
wanted to see me badly.''
   Also leaving Iraq today aboard a regularly scheduled Iraqi
Airways flight were William Hollingsworth of Huntsville, Ala., and
Lloyd Graham of Houston.
   No list of all 14 Americans was released by officials, and no
other names were immediately available.
   About 1,000 Americans remain trapped in Iraq and Kuwait.
   Salim Mansoor, an Iraqi-American who met with Saddam, said on
Monday that 14 ailing or elderly Americans would be freed.
   Several of the American men who left Iraq today appeared to be
very young and two were reportedly dependents of U.S. diplomats. It
was not known why Iraq decided to free the younger Americans
instead of sick and elderly people.
   Also today, Saudi Arabia's ambassador was summoned to the State
Department in Washington, where he denied the kingdom wants Kuwait
to yield territory to Iraq in order to defuse the crisis in the
Persian Gulf.
   Saddam ``should not be under any disillusion,'' Prince Bandar
said before meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
``This is a decision for the Kuwaitis, not for us. But we don't
think aggression should be rewarded.''
   There have been indications that the Arab world was softening
its hard line in dealing with Iraq - including a statement by Saudi
King Fahd that Saddam would not lose face if he were to withdraw
his troops.
   If Iraq took that step and restored the al-Sabah family as
Kuwait's rulers, Saudi Arabia and Egypt said there could be talks
on the disputes that led to the invasion of the oil-rich emirate.
   In other developments, former British Prime Minister Edward
Heath met with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz today to arrange
freedom for 50 or more Britons. There are an estimated 1,400
Britons in Kuwait and Iraq.
   Kuwait's emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, met in London
today with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to discuss the
future of his nation. Mrs. Thatcher reportedly stressed that
Britain stands behind the United States in demanding that Saddam
withdraw all his troops unconditionally.
   Oil prices dropped by more than $5 a barrel Monday amid reports
the Saudis might agree to let Iraq keep some Kuwaiti territory, but
recovered somewhat in trading in London today. Since the invasion,
when the world oil price was $22 a barrel, oil prices have
fluctuated wildly, at one point topping $40 a barrel.
   A Kuwaiti newspaper in Saudi Arabia reported on Monday that
Saddam had dreamed the Prophet Mohammed appeared before him and
said Iraq's missiles ``were pointed in the wrong direction.''
   The missiles are aimed toward Saudi Arabia, where a U.S.-led
multinational force is assembled.
   Middle East observers said the dream report indicated Saddam
could be preparing his people for a withdrawal from Kuwait.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, with President Bush in
Burlington, Vt., said today of Saddam's reported dream: ``No
comment on dreams. I have enough problem dealing with reality.''
   Oil prices plunged Monday following reported remarks made on
Sunday by Saudi Arabia's defense minister, Prince Sultan, that Arab
nations are willing to grant Iraq ``all its rights.'' That was
interpreted as a sign the Saudis are prepared to agree to
territorial concessions by Kuwait.
   The same day, however, Prince Sultan reiterated that ``any
solution must provide for an unconditional Iraqi pullout from
Kuwait and the return of the rule of the al-Sabah family.''
   A reporter who covered the speech for The Associated Press said
the prince declared ``rights, whether valid or doubtful'' could
always be discussed, but only after Iraqi withdrawal - with no
mention of ``all rights.''
   King Fahd and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt met today in
Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, and the monarch later said ``we would be
thankful'' if Iraq gave up Kuwait. Fahd's statements were
distributed by the official Saudi Press Agency.
   ``It would be nothing to cause anxiety or pain, but to the
contrary if President Saddam thought seriously about the matter he
will find that it is in the interest of Iraq, in his personal
interest, and in the interest of the Arab nation, that he pull out
from Kuwait,'' Fahd said.
   Diplomatic sources said Fahd and Mubarak agreed Iraq's
withdrawal could be followed by negotiations on the disputes that
preceded the invasion.
   Iraq had demanded territorial and financial concessions from
Kuwait, including the islands of Warba and Bubiyan in the Persian
Gulf and the Kuwaiti section of the Rumailah oilfield.

   Trying to bribe a police officer is not
original but Alfonso Marinello made an offer that was a cut above

   Marinello, 43, was pulled over for alleged drunken driving late
Monday after police spotted him driving erratically and gave chase.
   Police said Marinello first offered each of the officers $2,000.
They called their supervisor to the scene and Marinello repeated
his monetary offer to her, officials said.
   When the three refused, Marinello made a last ditch attempt and
offered them free haircuts for the rest of their lives, police
said.
   Marinello, who owns a unisex barber shop in Copiague, was
charged with first-degree attempted bribery and driving while
intoxicated.

<HEAD>Hard-Liners Announce New Campaign Against Western Influence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLENE L. FU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The hard-line leadership on Tuesday dashed
expectations it would ease its grip on society, announcing a new
campaign against Western influences such as pornography and
cracking down on crime.
   Hundreds of people have been executed in the 6-month-old
anti-crime campaign, which has been widely criticized by human
rights groups.
   A front-page announcement in the Communist Party newspaper, the
People's Daily, contradicted widespread expectations that the party
would relax its tight social controls after the Asian Games ended
Oct. 7 in Beijing.
   Hong Kong newspapers had predicted that more participants in
last year's failed democracy movement would be released from jail
if the games went off smoothly.
   But Zhou Chengkui, spokesman for the National People's Congress,
said on Monday he had no word of forthcoming releases.
   Tuesday's announcement indicated that China's hard-line
leadership, which has dominated Chinese politics since crushing
last year's student protests, has no plans to relax its hold.
   In speeches carried in the People's Daily, they called for
vigilance against alleged anti-party forces.
   ``At present, our country is politically, economically and
socially stable,'' said Qiao Shi, the party official in charge of
police matters.
   ``But we must see clearly that the relatively smooth public
order of these few months was achieved through the might of the
(anti-crime) struggle. In ideology and in work, we cannot relax one
bit.''
   More than 720 people were sentenced to death from January to
mid-August, including more than 350 in June and July, according to
the international human rights group Amnesty International. Most
executions in China are carried out within a few days.
   Thousands of people have been arrested since the anti-crime
campaign began in May, with some cities expanding their police
forces and even forming civilian patrols.
   In June 1989, the party launched a six-month anti-pornography
campaign that also saw the seizure and destruction of pro-democracy
publications.
   Liu Zhongde, who headed the campaign, said a new drive to last
through next spring will clean up remaining ``spiritual pollution
and cultural garbage.''
   Twelve percent of China's newspapers, 13 percent of its social
science periodicals and more than 7 percent of its publishing
houses have been closed down since June 1989, Liu said.
   Thirty-two million books and magazines were destroyed and nearly
80,000 people convicted for involvement in illegal publishing
activity, Liu said.
   ``This is still just a good beginning,'' he said. ``Some obscene
publications that have been explicitly banned have reappeared in
new form.''
   He blamed this on ``the bourgeois liberal tide,'' the party's
phrase for Western-style democratic ideas such as free speech and
multiparty rule.
   ``People who support bourgeois liberalism ... advocate complete
Westernization,'' he said. ``But complete Westernization
necessarily opens the door to corrupt and degenerate capitalist
things, and thus obscene things are spread.''

<HEAD>Mich. to Pay $1,000-Per-Day Fine for Delay on Prison Psychiatric
Hospital</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA PERLMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state has agreed to pay a
$1,000-per-day fine imposed by a federal judge for moving too
slowly on plans to build a $50 million psychiatric hospital for
prison inmates.
   The state Department of Corrections will pay the fine on a
weekly basis beginning Friday, spokeswoman Gail Light said.
   On Oct. 12, U.S. District Judge Richard Enslen found the state
in contempt of court for delaying the hospital project and ordered
the fine to start Monday.
   The hospital was directed two years ago as part of an ongoing
court-monitored agreement between corrections officials and the
U.S. Justice Department to improve prison conditions in Michigan.
   Under the agreement, the Legislature was supposed to provide
full funding for the project by last July, construction was to
begin next April and the hospital was to be completed by April
1993.
   ``I don't think there was ever a dispute over whether we needed
to build a psychiatric hospital,'' Light said Monday. ``We were
just tring to explain to the judge that it's been very difficult
because the Legislature hasn't provided funding and because the
local communities are very recalcitrant about it being in their
areas.''
   The hospital is proposed for the Lansing area, so that it could
take advantage of Michigan State University medical school programs
and personnel. But communities targeted by the department balked at
the prospect.
   To date, the Legislature has authorized only $50,000 to study
renovating or expanding existing psychiatric units.
   State Attorney General Frank Kelley said last week there was no
basis for appealing the fine.
   Enslen also has warned the fine will increase to $10,000 a day
if the state does not get back on track with the project by March
15. The Legislature resumes deliberations in mid-November.

   Saddam Hussein's government granted exit
visas to 14 Americans today, then put them on a flight to Jordan.
   ``I'm just thrilled that I'm going,'' William Hollingsworth, 64,
said at Baghdad's international airport.
   ``It's a strange coincidence, but I'm leaving the gulf and my
son is in Saudi Arabia,'' the Huntsville, Ala., man said,
explaining his son is with the U.S. Army.
   ``I was waiting for this moment. I am extremely happy, but sad
at the same time because I am leaving many of my friends and
colleagues,'' Jack Fraser, another of the Americans who left the
Iraqi capital today.
   Fraser, 53, of Santa Ana, Calif., like the other Americans, had
been unable to leave Iraq since Saddam's troops invaded Kuwait in
August.
   Also freed were John Thompson, 44, an American who lives in
Germany, and Lloyd Graham, 48, of Houston.
   Officials issued no list of the 14 Americans, and the names of
the other Americans could not be determined immediately. Several of
the Americans appeared to be very young and two were reportedly
dependents of U.S. diplomats.
   Earlier, Salim Mansoor, an Iraqi-American who met with Saddam,
said 14 ailing or elderly Americans would be freed today. It was
not known why the Iraqi government decided to free other men
instead of sick and elderly people.
   ``President Saddam Hussein, as a gesture of good will, is
allowing a certain number of Americans to go home,'' said Mansoor,
the head of the U.S.-based American-Iraqi Foundation.
   Mansoor also said Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz told him that
Iraqi officials were willing to discuss the Persian Gulf crisis.
The United States has said Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait before
negotiations take place.
   Mansoor's seven-member delegation arrived in Baghdad on Oct. 14
to attempt to obtain the release of Americans held in Baghdad and
Kuwait. Mansoor's U.S.-based foundation claims to represent 150,000
Iraqi-Americans.
   Also today, former British Prime Minister Edward Heath met with
Iraq's foreign minister to arrange freedom for 50 or more Britons.
   A Virgin Atlantic airline jumbo jet left London's Gatwick
Airport today for Baghdad to rescue sick and elderly Britons,
airline officials said. It is not known exactly how many Britons
will be allowed to return.
   Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic Airways, said today
in London that he had spoken to Heath. Branson said he expected to
bring about 50 sick and elderly Britons back to Gatwick.
   About 1,000 Americans and 1,400 Britons are trapped in Kuwait
and Iraq, many held at key installations to deter possible attack
by the multinational forces deployed in the region after Saddam's
invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2.
   A relief official at the United Nations, meanwhile, said 1,000
Vietnamese workers who were stranded in Iraq were leaving today for
home.
   The Vietnamese are the first of 17,000 who were trapped in Iraq,
said James Purcell, head of the International Organization for
Migration, a 36-nation group helping to repatriate and resettle
people uprooted by the gulf crisis.
   Vietnam has applied for another 5,000 exit visas for more
workers, but they have not yet been processed by Baghdad, he said.
   Also today, five Finnish men who had been trapped in the country
since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait flew to Jordan for a
connecting flight home.
   Two opposition Greek politicians left for Baghdad today to win
the release of 25 Greeks held hostage there. Carolos Papoulias, a
former foreign minister in Greece's 1981-89 socialist
administration, and Akis Tsochatzopoulos were accompanied by the
chairman of the Committee of Relations of Greeks in Iraq.

   What's bad for the goose is good for this
northern North Dakota community that has more geese than people,
according to organizers of this week's GooseFest.
   Former Minnesota Vikings football coach Bud Grant will be the
first person inducted Wednesday night into the ``Goose Hunters Hall
of Fame.' He came to Kenmare last year to hunt and liked it so much
he wanted to come back, business leaders said.
   They're hoping others will do the same.
   ``If we get too many people for the motel, we've got farmers
that'll house them. We'll take all we can get. We'll find places
for them,'' Archie Kress promised.
   Whyagoosefest?
   Kenmare, with a population of about 1,200, bills itself as the
``Snow Goose Capital of North Dakota.'' Surrounded by three
wildlife refuges, it is home to thousands of snow geese for several
weeks during the birds' fall migration.
   `I've talked to people from the refuges last Wednesday and there
were about 350,000,'' Kress said Monday.
   The hunters wait for the geese to wander off refuge land into
nearby fields to catch grain stubble left after harvest. State law
allows hunters to kill seven geese a day from sunrise until noon.
   ``It's not that easy to go out there and shoot seven geee,''
Kress said. ``They seem to know when it's noon. We've even thought
about trying to sound the noon siren at another time to get them to
come out earlier.''

as the nation returns to standard time Sunday.
   That's when most folks will have an extra hour to sleep, carouse
or whatever they like to do in the wee hours of the morning.
   Of course, this is also the weekend some people will get stuck
working an extra hour - factory workers and convenience store
clerks, bartenders and police officers among them.
   For most people, though, the time change simply means
remembering to set the clock back an hour - that's right, back -
before retiring Saturday night or upon arising Sunday morning.
   The official changeover will come at 2 a.m. Sunday, ending more
than a half-year on daylight-saving time.
   In the words of the Uniform Time Act, which set up the system of
switching between daylight and standard times, clocks are
``retarded'' an hour at 2 a.m. on the last Sunday in October.
   The swap shifts an hour of sunlight from evening to morning,
making life a bit easier for youngsters waiting for school buses
and for farmers working their fields.
   Safety experts are urging Americans to use the time-change
weekend as a reminder to put new batteries in their smoke
detectors.
   ``Change Your Clock: Change Your Battery,'' is the slogan of the
effort, which aims to make replacing these batteries an annual
event.
   It was during World War I that Americans first tried
daylight-saving time, just 35 years after agreeing to a national
time system.
   The summertime shift, begun in 1918, was designed to save fuel
by reducing the need for lights in the evening, allowing that
energy to be turned to the war effort.
   Daylight-saving time was again in place in 1919 but was dropped
nationally as a deluge of protests demanded that the system be
abandoned in peacetime.
   Some states and localities kept the practice going, however,
making the United States a summertime patchwork of daylight and
standard time.
   Congress did away with most of the patchwork with the Uniform
Time Act of 1966.
   Actually, daylight time is still not national, as the law allows
states to exempt themselves. Hawaii promptly opted out in 1967,
Arizona in 1968 and Indiana in 1972.
   Indiana isn't a complete exception, though. Parts of the state
observe daylight time, parts don't.

   Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the
U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Tuesday he has seen no evidence to
support reports of Iraqi troops pulling back from forward positions
in Kuwait.
   Powell, who is on an official visit to confer with top
commanders in Operation Desert Shield, said he was aware of recent
reports from refugees fleeing the occupied country.
   ``I have no evidence to substantiate them,'' Powell said. ``The
Iraqi forces still remain very solidly in Kuwait in the numbers we
have been reporting all along.
   ``And frankly, I have not seen any evidence of withdrawal.''
   U.S. officials say more than 400,000 Iraqi troops are deployed
in and near Kuwait, many of them in forward defense positions
against possible attack along the Saudi Arabian border and the
Persian Gulf coast.
   Reports by Kuwait refugees recently leaving the country have
indicated that some of the forces were being repositioned to the
north, closer to Iraq.
   Powell agreed to talk briefly with reporters in Riyadh following
meetings with Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander in chief of
U.S. Forces in the region.
   He also visited with some U.S. troops and was to meet in Jiddah
with senior Saudi onificant competition for the U.S. Postal Service.

   TOKYO - Japan's economy, dizzied by a $2 trillion loss on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange over nine months, seems to have landed
squarely on its feet. By most accounts, consumers have shrugged off
the vanished assets as easy come-easy go. But it has put a strain
on some corporations, who have had to cope with a drop in the value
of their bonds as well as big paper losses.

<HEAD>Civil Rights Veto Could Mobilize Blacks on Election Day</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blacks were a key element in Democratic
election victories in the two midterm elections of Ronald Reagan's
presidency.
   Now, President Bush has vetoed a civil rights bill and raised
the possibility of another outpouring of black votes this year.
   ``There are places where if the black turnout is extraordinary,
as it was against Reagan in '82, it could make a difference,'' said
William Schneider, a political analyst at Boston College.
   With Election Day only two weeks away, the political question
was whether the Bush veto would arouse large numbers of people to
go to the polls on Nov. 6.
   Does the veto boost black turnout in North Carolina, Illinois,
Ohio and other key states?
   How much more motivation do blacks need in North Carolina, where
conservative Republican Sen. Jesse Helms is challenged by former
Charlotte mayor Harvey Gantt, who is black?
   But new motivation could make a difference in Illinois, where
Democrat Neil Hartigan and Republican Jim Edgar are battling neck
and neck to succeed Jim Thompson as governor. Thompson got the
political scare of his life in 1982 when a huge black turnout
nearly gave the governorship to Democratic challenger Adlai
Stevenson III.
   Comparable conditions are easy to cite: in that race the economy
was in a recession that hit blacks hardest and the Republican
president was perceived as anti-civil rights.
   Most independent polls in Ohio have shown Democrat Anthony
Celebrezze trailing Republican George Voinovich in the governor's
race. But this is another state where an unusually high black
turnout could result in an Election Night surprise.
   Civil rights is a potent issue in American politics. So are
quotas. Bush acknowledged the potential conflict between those two
issues in his veto message on Monday.
   He said the ``temptation to support a bill - any bill - simply
because its title includes the words `civil rights' is very strong.
   ``But when our efforts, however well-intentioned, result in
quotas, equal opportunity is not advanced but thwarted.''
   ``When the chips are down, the White House is against civil
rights,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. He called the action
``tragic and disgraceful.''
   On the political battlefields of the final two weeks of the 1990
campaign, Democrats will sound that cry repeatedly. They will tell
black voters that Bush is no different than Reagan, a president who
never got more than 10 percent support from blacks. By contrast, in
the 18 months of his presidency, Bush's approval ratings from
blacks have been in the mid 40s.
   On the other hand, aversion to quotas - a strong strain in the
American electorate - is unlikely to send people flocking to the
polls to back Republicans as a way of thanking Bush for his veto.
   That veto appeared certain to stand. Even sponsors of the
legislation said there was virtually no chance of getting the
two-thirds margins in the House and Senate to override.
   The measure was the civil rights community's top priority in
Congress. It would overturn six job bias decisions handed down by
the Supreme Court last year. Provisions range from a ban on racial
harassment in the workplace to punitive damages in the most extreme
cases of discrimination.
   The sharpest clashes, however, have come over provisions that
would make it easier to win discrimination cases against employers.
Bush contended those provisions would force employers to set quotas
to avoid lawsuits.
   But the Washington debate over the details of complex
legislation is now a political debate, what Schneider called ``a
contest in public relations.''
   During the budget negotiations in recent weeks, the president
lost the communications contest and was tagged with the perception
of wanting to protect the rich from having to pay more taxes.
   Selling voters, particularly blacks, on the idea that he vetoed
a civil rights bill to protect the country from quotas may prove
even more difficult.

<HEAD>Judges, Prison Guards, Transit Workers Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Judges left their chambers to march in their robes
and prison guards refused to escort inmates Tuesday as Justice
Ministry employees staged a nationwide strike for better pay and
conditions.
   In Paris, court clerks said they were short of basic equipment
such as telephones and typewriters. In Bordeaux, the chief judge of
the children's court said child abuse victims had to wait six weeks
for cases to be heard.
   In an unrelated strike, public transit workers nationwide also
walked off the job, disrupting bus, subway, rail and trolley
service in several major cities. They were striking for better pay
and administrative reform.
   At several prisons, guards refused to escort prisoners, whether
arriving for admission or leaving for transfers or court hearings.
In some cases, guards also refused to allow visitors to enter.
   In Nancy, a police squad was summoned to escort inmates through
a picket line of guards.
   In Bordeaux, where court activity was at a standstill, the chief
judge of the juvenile court said insufficient funding had created a
crisis.
   ``A minor who is in danger, who has been raped or physically
mistreated, cannot obtain an appointment with a judge for at least
a month and a half after the deed,'' said Judge Denis Hubert. ``If
tomorrow, a child died, I think the ministry would bear some
responsibility.''
   In Paris, 1,000 judges, lawyers and court personnel rallied
outside the Palace of Justice, then marched to the office of
Premier Michel Rocard.
   Jean-Luc Sauon, leader of a judges' union, said the
demonstrators wanted the government to draw up a multiyear plan for
the judicial budget. He threatened ``paralysis of the judicial
system'' unless Rocard acted.
   Rocard told leaders of the judicial unions he did not plan to
meet them and said they should address their demands to Justice
Minister Henri Nallet.
   The daylong transit walkout was most effective in Bordeaux,
where striking drivers halted bus service by blocking the three bus
depots. The Atlantic Coast city's normal daily bus ridership is
220,000.
   Bus service also was disrupted extensively in Lyon. Commuters
forced to take their cars encountered huge traffic jams, and even
illegal parking places were hard to find.
   In Paris, the daylong transit disruptions were less severe than
anticipated. The morning rush hour passed with few problems, but
service on most of the 13 subway lines was cut by at least half
during the middle of the day as about 1,500 transit employees
joined a protest march.
   Unions organizing the transit strike were seeking a base salary
of $1,300 a month, compared to $1,060.

   Grenades, ammunition and a rifle were found
in luggage apparently abandoned today in a baggage claim area after
arriving aboard a jetliner at Los Angeles International Airport, a
spokesman said.
   The Police Department bomb squad was called to Terminal 7
shortly after 9 a.m. to remove the bag and explosives, said Tom
Winfrey of the Department of Airports. There was no explosion or
disruption of service, he said.
   ``There was an unclaimed bag at the United Airlines terminal and
when they opened it up they found two live grenades inside and a
quantity of .50-caliber ammunition and a disassembled rifle,'' said
Winfrey.
   The type of bag carrying the explosives and weapon, and
identification of the flight the bag arrived on wasn't immediately
disclosed. Winfrey also had no idea how the explosives apparently
passed airport security checks.
   The baggage claim area on the airport's street level was
cordoned off, but Winfrey said ``it isn't affecting our
operation.''

   An exiled Iranian opposition leader died in a hail
of bullets Tuesday at his home, police said. His supporters accused
Iranian agents of carrying out an assasination.
   Cyrus Elahi, 46, died from several bullets to the head after one
or more gunmen opened fire on him in the hallway of his apartment
building in the chic 15th arrondissement, police said.
   The assassins fled and have not been captured. They appeared
familiar with Elahi's habits, police said.
   Elahi was a director of the Flag of Freedom Organization of Iran
and a supporter of the late Shah of Iran. The organization is
opposed to the Islamic regime that has ruled Iran since 1979.
   The organization issued a communique accusing ``the terrorists
of the Islamic Republic of Iran'' of carrying out the attack.
   A member of the group, founded in 1986, claimed that other
members have been targeted by Iranian assassination squads. He
offered no proof.
   Elahi was a former professor of political sciences at Tehran
University before fleeing to France in the wake of the Islamic
revolution.
   The Flag of Freedom Organization of Iran bills itself as the
``sole democratic organization active inside Iran.''

   Saudi Arabia's ambassador denied today that
his country wants Kuwait to yield territory to Iraq to settle the
Persian Gulf crisis. ``This is a decision for the Kuwaitis, not for
us,'' Prince Bandar said.
   The Saudi ambassador was summoned to the State Department after
reports quoting the Saudi Defense Minister, Prince Sultan, had
raised the possibility of giving Iraq some Kuwaiti territory to end
its 2{-month occupation.
   ``Saudi Arabia has not suggested there should be concessions
made to anyone,'' Bandar said after meeting for more than an hour
with Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   ``You cannot make aggression pay,'' the Saudi envoy said. ``If
you make aggression pay, that's the law of the jungle.''
   At the same time, Bandar gave a downbeat assessment of the
crisis. ``There is nothing encouraging for me,'' he said of various
reports that a negotiated way out of Iraq's occupation of Kuwait
might be looming.
   ``We have not heard from anyone that Iraq is willing to withdraw
from Kuwait,'' he said.
   Later, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said that
Bandar, in his meeting with Baker, confirmed that the Saudis had
not changed their policy.
   During their 85-minute meeting, no more than four minutes were
devoted to press reports about a policy shift, she said. The
remainder of the meeting, she said, involved a discussion of the
overall situation in the gulf.
   Ms. Tutwiler added that the meeting was not called in response
to the reports on Prince Sultan's remarks.
   Bandar spoke to reporters both before and after his meeting with
Baker in an apparent attempt to erase any impression that the Saudi
defense minister, who is his father, was proposing Kuwait cut a
deal with Iraq.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein ``should not be under any
disillusion,'' Bandar said on his arrival at the State Department.
   ``This is a decision for the Kuwaitis, not for us,'' the
ambassador said. ``But we don't think aggression should be
rewarded.''
   Of Sultan's comments, Bandar said, ``He was not implying Kuwait
should do one thing or another. He was talking about what we have
doe with other countries, negotiating as friends. Saddam did not
choose that route.''
   In the past, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates
have concluded territorial settlements.
   Bandar said the defense minister ``was talking about how
disputes can be solved not by aggression, which Iraq had committed,
but by dialogue, which Iraq did not choose.''
   The ambassador, responding to questions before seeing Baker,
insisted there had been no softening of Saudi Arabia's position in
the 2{-month-old crisis.
   ``Saudi Arabia has not changed its position at all,'' he said.
``We believe there should be unconditional implementation of the
United Nations resolutions.''
   The key resolution approved by the Security Council calls on
Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, which it seized Aug. 2 and
subsequently incorporated as a province.
   Baker has publicly ruled out ``partial solutions'' to the crisis
and said Saddam should not be permitted to benefit from ``the
rape'' of a neighboring nation.
   More than 200,000 U.S. troops are in Saudi Arabia in case Iraq
moves against that nation as well.

<HEAD>Personal Income Growth Slows In Second Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. personal income growth slowed during the
second quarter, and incomes declined in Iowa and Nebraska, the
Commerce Department reported Tuesday.
   A study by the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis showed
national income growth decelerating from 2.1 percent in the first
quarter to 1.3 percent from April through June. It weakened in five
of the nation's eight regions.
   The report was a reflection of the sluggish growth of the
general economy which dipped from 1.7 percent in the January-March
quarter to 0.4 percent in the next. Many economists believe the
nation is headed for a recession, if it is not already in one.
   Personal incomes fell 2.3 percent in Iowa and 0.4 percent in
Nebraska. For the Plains region as a whole, income growth dropped
from 1.9 percent in the first quarter to just 0.3 percent in the
second.
   Other regions posting slower growth were the Far West,
Southeast, Southwest and Mideast.
   The Rocky Mountain region showed the only improvement, up
slightly from 1.4 percent in the first quarter to 1.6 percent in
the second. Personal ncomes in both the Great Lakes and New
England states were unchanged.
   The department defines personal income as income received by
persons from all sources, less Social Security payments.
   The slowdown in personal income growth in the Plains region
``reflected declines in farm income and in construction payrolls,''
the report said. ``In addition, the payroll increase in retail
trade was smaller in the second quarter than in the first.''
   Income growth in the Far West was cut in half, from 3.2 percent
in the first quarter to 1.6 percent in the second. Nevertheless,
three of the four states - California, Oregon and Nevada - ranked
among the top 10 in income growth.
   ``A decline in durables manufacturing payrolls contributed to
the slowdown,'' the department said. ``In addition, payroll
increases in the transportation-communication-public utilities
group and in wholesale and retail trade were smaller in the second
quarter than in the first.
   In the Southeast, personal income increased 1.2 percent after a
2.7 percent gain in the first quarter.
   ``Declines in construction payrolls and in farm income
contributed to the slowdown,'' the report said. ``Moreover, payroll
increases in both durables and non-durables manufacturing and in
retail trade were smaller in the second quarter ...''
   The slowdown in the Southwest, from 1.7 percent in the first
quarter to 1.3 percent in the second, ``reflected declines in
durables manufacturing payrolls and in farm incomes.'' the study
said. ``In addition, payroll increases in construction and in
wholesale and retail trade were smaller ...''
   Personal income also dipped from 1.7 to 1.3 percent in the
Mideast because of declines in construction payrolls and in the
transportation-communication-public utilities group.
   Alaska and Hawaii, which are not included in a region, ranked
among the top 10 states in income growth. Alaska was first with a
2.4 percent increase and Hawaii ninth, with a 1.6 percent gain.
   Others in the top 10 were Michigan, second, with a 2.2 percent
increase; Ohio, third, 2.2 percent; Utah, fourth, 2.0 percent;
Colorado, fifth, 1.9 percent; Florida, sixth, 1.8 percent;
California, seventh, and Oregon, eighth, both up 1.7 percent, and
Nevada, tenth, 1.6 percent.

   Two grade school girls, touched by the
plight of children in Kuwait, sent $1 to the Kuwaiti embassy in
Washington, but it was returned with the ambassador's thanks.
   Melissa Davidson, 7, and her 6-year-old sister, Jessica, sent
their dollar to the embassy hoping to help children made refugees
by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   ``I would like to express my profound gratitude for your
generous gesture, which I must decline,'' wrote Ambassador Saud
Nasir Al-Shabah.
   Al-Shabah went on to explain he was returning the dollar because
``no fund has been set up for this crisis.''
   Nevertheless, he wrote, ``It is your support that strengthens
our hope and faith in regaining Kuwait.''
   The girls chipped in 50 cents each, Melissa said.
   Zionsville is in central Indiana, about 10 miles northwest of
Indianapolis.

<HEAD>Secession: Staten Islanders Slicing Away?</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: recasts 15th graf, `To many ...'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JUDIE GLAVE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Talk of secession has been in the air on Staten
Island ever since it became the Big Apple's smallest borough 92
years ago. On Nov. 6, voters may take a step toward making it
reality.
   Fed up with what they see as inequities in services and a
dwindling voice in local government, voters in the city's most
bucolic borough will finally get to vent their opinion on seceding
from New York City.
   A yes vote, however, would not send the island and its 350,000
residents floating swiftly toward independence. It would simply
authorize a three-year, state-financed study of the fiscal and
political ramifications of breaking away.
   ``This is our chance, our way of saying, `Hey, don't treat us
this way.' We're tired of being the Cinderella of New York City,''
said Dennis Papperman, the Secession Party candidate for City
Council who would lose his job if Staten Island broke away.
   ``Nothing would please me more than to lose my job if we
secede,'' said the beauty supply store owner.
   If the referendum passes, a commission of 18 Staten Islanders
would be chosen to study secession. In three years a new charter
would be submitted to voters, although the Legislature and governor
would have final say.
   Secession talk has been around since 1898 when residents voted -
by the slimmest of margins - to join the incorporated city of New
York.
   But for most of the century, talk is all it's been.
   ``Now it's time to see if people really mean it,'' said Les
Trautmann, an island native and editor of the Staten Island
Advance, which has held forums and hung billboards urging voters to
pass the issue.
   Many others, led by Borough President Guy Molinari, dismiss the
idea as financial suicide.
   Opponents warn that property taxes would quadruple after
secession. Police, fire and sanitation costs would increase and
repairing a long-neglected infrastructure would cost taxpayers
dearly, they believe.
   ``If that thing passes, that's it, I'm outta here. There's no
way I'll be able to afford living here,'' said John Liotta, an
apprentice carpenter.
   Other residents think the high cost of New York City living
makes the proposed study appealing.
   ``Like we're not paying through the nose for that stuff
already,'' Anthony Quinnela said while waiting for the ferry to
Manhattan.
   To many outsiders, Staten Island is the least known of the
city's five boroughs. Many know it merely as the turnaround point
for the Staten Island ferry, or as home of the world's largest
garbage dump, the 2,000 acre, 20-story-high Fresh Kills landfill.
   But to residents, it's a tree-lined refuge. As recently as the
1960s there were working farms and horse stables. The crime rate
remains comparatively low and public schools rank with the city's
best.
   The oft-heard secession cry grew more urgent in 1989 when the
U.S. Supreme Court ruled the city's Board of Estimate
unconstitutional under the one-man, one-vote rule. The board, which
awarded city contracts, was the only corner of government where
Staten Islanders enjoyed as much political muscle as the more
populated boroughs.
   With the board's demise, Staten Island was left with just two of
31 City Council seats. A third will be added when the more powerful
council expands to 51 members in 1991.
   ``That's less representation than we have now,'' said Papperman.
   At first, many joked about Staten Island seceding.
   The laughing stopped when a bill permitting the referendum
passed the Legislature and city attorneys failed to block the
referendum vote in court.
   The question of cost won't be the only consideration for some
voters. Michele Troy said she'd simply miss the cachet of a New
York City address.
   ``I like telling people I'm from New York. They think glamour,
excitement,'' she said.
   She tried out the alternative, but wrinkled her nose: ``I'm from
Staten Island City. Sorry, it just doesn't sound as good.''

<HEAD>Reward for Finding School Bond Proposition Offered</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supporters of a school bond measure are so
worried the initiative has been lost in California's election
avalanche that they are offering cash to schools that can find the
measure in the voter booklet.
   A $500 reward will go to four elementary or secondary schools
that can name the page number in the 224-page, two-part ballot
booklet where the argument in favor of Proposition 146 is located.
   The four schools will be picked by a drawing of the correct
responses received by Nov. 1, with the money coming from the Yes on
146 campaign, said campaign manager Peter Birdsall.
   With 28 measures on the ballot, the search may not be too easy,
he said.
   ``We are concerned that people are not even aware that the
school bond measure is on the ballot,'' Birdsall said.
   Proposition 146 would raise $800 million for construction and
renovation of elementary and secondary schools in California.

   Here, at a glance, are the latest developments in the Persian
Gulf crisis:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   Fourteen Americans left the Iraqi capital for Jordan today after
being freed by Saddam Hussein's government. They departed as
Britain said 33 British hostages would leave Iraq within hours.
About 1,000 Americans remain trapped in Iraq and Kuwait.
   ---
   Saudi Arabia's ambassador denied on Tuesday that his country
wants Kuwait to yield territory to Iraq to settle the Persian Gulf
crisis. ``This is a decision for the Kuwaitis, not for us,'' Prince
Bandar said. He was summoned to the State Department after reports
quoting the Saudi Defense Minister raised the possibility of giving
Iraq some Kuwaiti territory to end its occupation.
   ---
   The Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Seyassah reported that Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein told top aides that he dreamed Mohammed appeared
before him and told him: ``I see your rockets deployed wrongly.''
The dream could be an attempt to prepare Iraqis psychologically for
a pullout from Kuwait, which Iraq invaded Aug. 2.
   ---
   Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said Tuesday he has seen no evidence to support reports of Iraqi
troops pulling back from forward positions in Kuwait. Powell is on
an official visit to Saudi Arabia to confer with top commanders. On
his return to Washington on Thursday, he's expected to recommend
whether to extend the U.S. buildup in the region.
   ---
   Oil prices were mixed on the futures market Tuesday as uncertain
traders tried to figure out which way crude would move after
Monday's record drop.
   ---
   The Persian Gulf crisis is putting a severe strain on the tiny
nations of the Caribbean. Their frail economies and scant natural
resources make them highly vulnerable to higher oil prices. The
ripple effects in the Caribbean include higher food, utility and
transportation costs.

   NASA crews Tuesday prepared for
crucial fuel-tank loading tests that will determine if the space
shuttles Atlantis and Columbia are leak-free and ready to fly.
   Work on the shuttles has been marred by mistakes, including two
accidents in three days involving metal beams. One beam was left to
bang around Atlantis' engine compartment when the shuttle was
hoisted to an upright position earlier this month. Another crashed
to the floor while being moved by a forklift.
   ``I hate to say it, but I think some of it has to do with the
fact we're not flying and we're not paying as close attention as we
should be,'' said Conrad Nagel, who is responsible for Atlantis'
prelaunch operations.
   Discovery's trip this month with a sun-exploring satellite was
the first shuttle flight in 5{ months.
   ``With so many delays, that has a negative affect on the
workforce,'' Nagel said. ``When things are moving along, and people
are doing their jobs and they're active, it's a little different
attitude.''
   Getting through Atlantis' fueling test Wednesday, and Columbia's
test Monday, should help, Nagel said. Atlantis has been grounded by
hydrogen leaks since June, Columbia since May.
   ``I think we need Atlantis and Columbia back up, is the bottom
line, to be back on track,'' said Keith Hudkins, chief of the
shuttle orbiter program.
   Even NASA's astronauts have come under criticism. The National
Transportation Board said Tuesday the space agency should take
steps to prevent air accidents involving astronauts. Astronauts
flying jets have had three close calls with other planes during the
past 1{ years, the board said.
   Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
hoped to vindicate at least Atlantis on Wednesday.
   Shortly before sunrise, NASA was to begin loading liquid
hydrogen into Atlantis' external tank at the launch pad. The tank
and fuel lines leading to it are new, as are seals in a
17-inch-diameter valve.
   Liquid oxygen also will be pumped into Atlantis' main propulsion
system to make sure there is no damage from the 9-foot-long,
47{-pound beam that was left in the engine compartment.
   Technicians forgot to remove the aluminum beam after using it
for a platform, and the piece crashed into about 25 spots as the
orbiter was being raised into an upright position in the assembly
building on Oct. 3. A small section of an overboard vent line for
liquid oxygen had to be replaced.
   An investigative team for Lockheed Space Operations Co., NASA's
prime contractor for shuttle processing, concluded Friday the
accident was the result of human error.
   Failure to follow procedures was responsible for the Oct. 5
accident involving a beam that is part of a steel sling used to
raise the orbiter, Lockheed spokesman J.B. Kump said Tuesday.
Workers failed to secure the 60- to 70-foot-long beam to a
forklift, and the beam fell about 8 inches to the floor of the
assembly building. No injuries or damage were reported.
   Kump said ``appropriate disciplinary actions'' are being taken
against workers in both cases.
   Forrest McCartney, director of Kennedy Space Center, said he's
``very unhappy'' about the mishaps. He met with workers in the
assembly building last week and urged them to ``be a little bit
more aware of what we're doing.''
   Columbia's hydrogen leakage, which is much more extensive than
that of Atlantis, is at least partly due to worker error. Two seals
were crushed when they were installed improperly after the
shuttle's last flight in January.
   Workers have since replaced the damaged seals, part of valves on
hydrogen lines leading to the shuttle's main rocket engines.
   If Atlantis passes Wednesday's test, NASA hopes to send it on a
classified Pentagon mission around Nov. 9 or 10. Mission managers
will set a launch date following a flight readiness review that
begins Monday.
   The mission originally was scheduled for July, but was delayed
when hydrogen leaks were detected during a fueling test in June.
   NASA officials said they will try to launch Columbia by the end
of the year if Monday's fueling test goes well or if any remaining
leaks can be corrected quickly. The shuttle's astronomy mission
already has endured four postponements.

<HEAD>Syria's Vice President Visits Beirut To Discuss Demilitarization</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syria's vice president made a surprise
visit to Lebanon Tuesday to try to boost government efforts to
disarm rival militias in battle-torn Beirut, officials said.
   The visit followed weekend talks in Damascus between President
Elias Hrawi and Syrian President Hafez Assad, who renewed a pledge
to support efforts to end Lebanon's 15-year-old civil war and
reunify the capital.
   Government sources said Tuesday's talks dealt specifically with
details of the withdrawal of the various militias from the Beirut
area.
   Tens of thousands of fighters belong to a dozen major militias,
both Christian and Moslem, which are blamed for most of the 150,000
deaths in the civil war.
   One source said Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam's talk with
Lebanese officials was ``a message to all the militias that Syria
is serious in supporting government plans to achieve the withdrawal
of militias from Beirut and its suburbs.''
   The government source said Hrawi wants Beirut and its suburbs
free of the militias by Nov. 22 to coincide with the 47th
anniversary of Lebanon's independence from France.
   ``The whole world supports the government decision to disband
the militias,'' the source said. ``Greater Beirut will be the first
step toward spreading state authority over all of Lebanon.''
   Hrawi has been re-establishing his government's authority since
Oct. 13, when his army and Syrian troops crushed the mutiny of
Christian Gen. Michel Aoun.
   Aoun, who has taken refuge in the French Embassy, had opposed an
Arab League-brokered peace pact because it did not guarantee the
complete withdrawal of 40,000 Syrian troops, who have been in
Lebanon since 1976. The pact also grants equal rights to the
country's Moslems and Christians.
   On his surprise visit, Khaddam met with Hrawi, a Maronite
Catholic; Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, and Parliament
Speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite Moslem.
   Hrawi has assigned Agriculture Minister Mohsen Dalloul, a Shiite
Moslem, and Defense Minister Albert Mansour, a Greek Catholic, to
begin talks with the militia leaders.
   Involved in the talks would be leaders of the right-wing
Christian Lebanese Forces militia; the pro-Iranian Hezbollah; the
mainstream Shiite Amal militia; and Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's
Progressive Socialist Party.
   The Beirut newspaper An-Nahar said the Syrians also would
discuss Hezbollah's control of the south Beirut slums when Iranian
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati visits Damascus this week.
   Hezbollah is the umbrella for pro-Iranian extremists holding
most of the 13 missing Westerners, including six Americans. The
longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of
The Associated Press, who was abducted March 16, 1985.

   Marine Gunnery Sgt. Leroy Ford is
sweating it out in the desert by his own choice. He was close
enough to retirement to stay back in the States, but he volunteered
to stay with his unit.
   ``This is my last hurrah. I didn't want to miss out,'' he said.
``I didn't want to read about this in the papers and say, `I should
have been there.'''
   Ford, 39, known as ``Gunny'' by his troops, is in the 1st Marine
Expeditionary Force stationed in eastern Saudi Arabia as part of
Operation Desert Shield.
   A 19-year veteran of the Marine Corps, he is due to retire in
March. Ford served a year in Da Nang, Vietnam, and was part of the
Marine force in Lebanon whose barracks was destroyed by a suicide
bomber seven years ago Tuesday.
   Ford's unit was reassigned from Lebanon to the Philippines two
days before the Oct. 23, 1983 bombing by a Shiite Moslem, which
killed 241 Americans, mostly Marines.
   ``When I heard the news, I wanted to go back and get them,'' he
said.
   This is his first assignment to the Middle East since.
   With his combat experience, he's sort of a father figure for a
new breed of Marines preparing for action in the blistering desert.
He remembers what it's like to be a scared, 18-year-old private.
   ``I talk with the guys all the time. I joke with them. They ask
me what it's like,'' said Ford, a native of Alexandria, La., who
now lives in Camp Pendleton, Calif.
   Asked about the readiness of today's troops, Ford said: ``They
know what a bullet sounds like. I'm not worried.''
   But in the next breath, he noted that combat changes fresh-faced
volunteers into grizzled veterans in a hurry. ``It makes you grow
up faster,'' Ford said.
   A gunny's job and part of his mystique is making sure his outfit
has everything it needs, from chow to spare parts, even if it means
bartering with other units or scrounging for gear.
   His desert-hardened troops enjoy having Ford around. They kid
him about his sweat-stained floppy hat. And when he sang ``I'll Be
Home for Christmas,'' another Marine needled him. ``You'll have a
white Christmas, Gunny. White sand.''
   ``It's good to have him around,'' said Navy Corpsman Jeff
Pruitt, 24, seeking relief from the relentless desert sun in the
shade of an armored vehicle. ``He keeps us loose. He tells us
stories.''
   Earlier this week, Ford's Alpha Company got its first crack at
the practice firing range, zeroing in on targets with its 25mm
cannons and M-60 machine guns.
   ``It gets the blood flowing. You hear that bam-bam-bam,'' said
Ford, the father of four children.
   When Ford retires, he wants to get into hotel management and
perhaps open a restaurant back in Louisiana.
   ``The party's almost over,'' Ford said. ``Like my father said,
I'm going to have to get out of the Marine Corps and get a real
job.''

   CPR by paramedics saves almost as many elderly
heart-attack victims as it does younger ones, and should not be
abandoned for older people in an effort to eliminate useless
procedures, a study concludes.
   Some previous research of cardiopulmonary resuscitation has
suggested the elderly may derive negligible benefit from attempts
to revive them after out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. Survival
rates in those studies were as low as 1 percent.
   But a five-year study in Seattle showed that 10 percent of
cardiac-arrest patients over age 70 who received CPR from
paramedics survived not only long enough to get into the hospital,
but also long enough to go home. That compared with a 14 percent
survival rate in younger victims.
   In the study period, which ended in March 1988, paramedics
treated 1,407 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests among people age 70
or older, and 27 percent of the victims lived long enough to get
admitted to a hospital.
   During the same period, paramedics treated 1,624 younger
patients for out-of-hospital arrests, and the survival rate to
admission was 29 percent, said researchers led by Dr. W.T.
Longstreth Jr. of Harborview Medical Center in Seattle.
   A total of 140 elderly patients survived after being released,
as did 223 younger patients, the researchers reported in
Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   Paramedic CPR worked best on heart attacks marked by ventricular
fibrillation, a rapid, uncoordinated and ineffective heartbeat
caused by haywire electrical impulses in the lower heart chambers,
the researchers said.
   The study's conclusions don't apply to patients who have heart
attacks inside hospitals because those patients are much more
likely to have other illnesses that reduce survival.

   Comedian Bob Hope has decided after
all that he will travel to the Persian Gulf to stage Christmas
shows for U.S. troops, but he'll change his act to make it
acceptable to Arab censors.
   ``How am I going to go without the girls? I'd hate to think I
was the only pretty face there,'' Hope said Monday night at
dedication ceremonies for the downtown Long Beach-Bob Hope USO.
   For decades, Hope has been accompanied on his Christmas season
tours by a platoon of starlets and Hollywood beauty queens. In
Saudi Arabia, the 87-year-old comedian will be forced to change the
routine.
   The announcement Monday reversed Hope's earlier position on a
performance in the Middle East. Hope wouldn't say Monday why he
changed his mind, but he was sharply criticized for saying in
August he had no plans to travel to Saudi Arabia.
   ``Palm Springs is my desert,'' he had said. ``The only way I'm
going to the desert is going to Palm Springs.''
   During the dedication ceremony, Hope poked fun at military
spending and the radar-evading B-2 stealth bomber.
   ``The U.S. government paid $70 billion for something that fles
in, bombs undetected and flies out. I've been doing that for
years,'' Hope quipped.

   NEW ORLEANS (AP) - Actor John Goodman has agreed to become the
first celebrity Santa Claus in a Christmas parade down Canal
Street.
   ``We hope this will be the beginning of celebrity Santas every
year,'' said Mickey Barthelemy, wife of Mayor Sidney Barthelemy and
president of Christmas in New Orleans Inc., the non-profit group
sponsoring the Dec. 9 parade.
   The blue-collar husband on the hit sitcom ``Roseanne'' has been
in and out of New Orleans since first visiting on a fraternity
junket in 1972. He says he hopes to own a home in the city one day.
   Goodman met his wife, Annabeth, in New Orleans while he was
working on the movie ``Everybody's All-American'' in 1987. The
couple married there about a year ago.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Two singers and three pianists took turns
rendering ``All of Me,'' Gerald Marks' most famous composition,
during the composer's 90th birthday party.
   Maxene Andrews sang first, then Gogi Grant sang a version with
lyrics written especially for the party Monday night.
   Cy Coleman, Marty Napoleon and Billy Taylor each played the song
separately before all three took the bench to finish with a
six-handed version.
   When Marks took the stage, he spoke of the foibles and triumphs
of his 75-year songwriting career and sang some of his little-known
works, including ``North Dakota,'' the first song he ever wrote.
   Marks also sang a comedy song he claimed lyricist Mitchell
Parish wrote during the War of 1812, but Parish actually was born
in 1900 - only a couple of months before Marks.

   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A chance encounter in a dry cleaning shop
landed a starring role in ABC-TV's ``Who's The Boss?'' for a
5-year-old New Jersey boy.
   ``When I found out I got the role, I was so excited that I could
have exploded,'' Jonathan Halyalkar said.
   Jonathan, from the town of Ramsey, has been filming episodes in
Los Angeles since July.
   He plays Billy, a foster child of TV characters Tony Micelli and
Angela Bower, played by Tony Danza and Judith Light.
   A man married to a Teaneck talent agent discovered Jonathan 1{
years ago.
   Jonathan's mother, Carolyn, was dropping off clothes at a dry
cleaner when her son struck up a conversation with the man, who was
impressed and told his wife.
   Jonathan's character was written into the show after Alyssa
Milano - who has played Danza's TV daughter since the show went on
the air in 1984 - announced she was leaving at the end of the
season.
   ``Working with Tony Danza is a piece of cake,'' Jonathan said.

<HEAD>White House Offere Compromise That Saved Clean Air Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After months of tortured negotiations, a
massive rewrite of the nation's clean air laws came down to a
dispute over helping coal miners whose jobs might be threatened by
the bill.
   Congressional Democrats were demanding a $250 million plan to
give retraining and other benefits to workers who'd lose their jobs
because of stringent new environmental regulations. One key
lawmaker vowed to use a filibuster to kill any bill that was
stripped of the worker benefit plan.
   But for months the administration was opposed to the addition,
claiming it would lead to a costly new program the nation could ill
afford.
   Then, in the pre-dawn hours Monday, the administration floated a
compromise that softened key provisions of the plan. It won swift
acceptance, clearing the way for final votes this week in the House
and Senate and the president's likely approval.
   The compromise had little to do with the overall bill, which
calls for tighter pollution controls on industry, automobiles and
utilities to reduce smog, acid rain and toxic chemical releases.
   But the resolution of this disagreement was like many other
tradeoffs that marked months of closed-door bargaining on the
700-page clean-air legislation.
   ``They were looking to be accommodating,'' said Rep. Robert
Wise, D-W.Va., of the White House.
   Members of Congress were just as eager, not wanting to see
months of effort go for nothing.
   The worker benefit program had been incorporated into the House
bill at the urging of Wise, whose district includes both coal mines
and large chemical plants.
   An estimated 5,000 to 15,000 jobs are at risk because the bill
calls for sharp reductions in acid rain pollutants, which are
likely to cause Midwest utilities to shift away from using
high-sulfur coal.
   But the Bush administration for months has feared the program
could easily get out of control and soar in costs. Senior
administration officials made clear the president might veto the
massive bill - and scuttle the first comprehensive clean air
changes in 13 years - if the measure were included.
   The final break came after midnight Sunday, when all
pollution-control issues had been worked out by negotiators for the
House and Senate under the watchful eye of the administration.
   Sources involved in the talks said Roger Porter, the president's
domestic policy adviser, floated the a compromise through Sen. John
Chafee, R.I.
   Workers who lose their jobs because of the new clean air
requirements would get six months of additional financial
assistance after unemployment compensation runs out, similar to
Wise's original proposal.
   But rather than go to all workers, benefits would be restricted
to those who could show financial need.
   This accord met with agreement by Wise and the White House - and
eliminated another potential threat to the bill, as well.
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia had threatened to try and
block the bill with a filibuster in the closing days of the
congressional session if the worker provision were eliminated.
   The Byrd threat became more ominous when a group of disgruntled
Western senators, including Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, said they were
ready to filibuster if the bill imposed new clean air requirements
to assure visibility in federal parks.
   In the end, when Byrd's objections were met, a compromise was
worked out to merely study the park visibility issue rather than
impose new requirements.
   Like all compromises, this one permitted both sides to claim
victory.
   White House officials pointed out that with worker assistance no
longer an automaticbenefit, costs can be contained.
   Although yet to endorse the completed bill publicly, White House
sources said the program for worker assistance is no longer a
problem.
   That shouldn't be surprising, said a congressional source
involved in the discussion. ``They wrote it. We watched them use
the typewriter.''
   ``We got substantially what we wanted,'' said Wise, noting that
the dollar amount remained at $250 million over five years.

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney will support a
$288 billion defense bill despite a wholesale cut in President
Bush's 1991 budget request for the Strategic Defense Initiative,
the Pentagon said Tuesday.
   ``The secretary did decide last night he would pose no
objection'' to the military blueprint crafted by House and Senate
negotiators from the two chanbers' differing bills, said Pentagon
spokesman Pete Williams.
   The legislation calls for slashing $1.8 billion from Bush's
proposal of $4.7 billion for SDI, commonly known as Star Wars,
barely keeping alive the B-2 bomber and sharply reducing spending
on land-based, nuclear missiles.
   Although Cheney was disappointed with the amount of money
earmarked for SDI, he believes ``it's a pretty good deal. We got
what we wanted in terms of strategic programs, which we felt was
essential,'' Williams told reporters.
   The House and Senate are expected to vote on the legislation
within the next three days before sending it to the president for
his signature.
   Shortly after negotiators announced an agreement on the bill
last Wednesday, Cheney signaled he would recommend a presidential
veto of the legislation that sets spending ceilings for the fiscal
year that began Oct. 1.
   The Pentagon opposed language restricting the spending on the
SDI program, provisions on base closings, a troop cut of 100,000
and a plan to aid defense employees forced out of work by
diminishing military budgets.
   Congressional staff and Pentagon officials worked throughout the
weekend to reach a compromise, finally settling on changes that in
some cases make minor alterations in language but in others give
Cheney more leeway.
   The reduction in SDI remains the same but language limiting how
the money can be spent has been modified. ``It's not as rigid'' in
terms of preventing the SDI office from transferring money from one
category to another, Willilams said.
   The legislation provides Cheney with added flexibility on troop
cuts. Negotiators agreed on a reduction of 100,000 from the 2.1
million troops worldwide. Added to the bill was authority for the
defense secretary to limit the cut to 80,000 based on the U.S.
military buildup in the Persian Gulf.
   Pentagon officials and congressional staff also changed details
in the provision setting up an independent commission to recommend
military bases for closing or realignment. The revisions have no
impact on the overall concept.
   The bill makes no change on the issue of the B-2 stealth bomber,
providing $4.1 billion for the Air Force program in fiscal 1991.
   ``There is no restriction in the legislation that would prevent
us from pursuing the next aircraft,'' Williams said, referring to
the administration's plan to purchase bombers No. 16 and No. 17.
   While the Pentagon was issuing its interpretation, Rep. Les
Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, was
telling lawmakers that schedule delays and cost overruns on the
first 15 planes will consume most of the money.
   ``The fix is in on the B-2,'' Aspin said in an appearance before
the House Rules Committee.

<HEAD>Defiant Harvard Professor Imparts Different Lesson to Students</HEAD>

   Six months after Harvard Law School's
first tenured black professor took an unpaid leave to protest the
lack of black women on the faculty, that goal hasn't been realized.
But there are other effects of his action.
   Derrick Bell says he also wanted to show students, many who
might be eyeing high-flying careers, that they need to take risks
for what they believe in. It's a principle Bell has lived by for
years.
   ``I think it's important that they understand the difference
between talking a good game and actually doing something, actually
being able to stand up when everyone else is sitting down, to take
a stand when everybody else is keeping silent,'' he said.
   Bell's decision in April to take a leave of absence received
great publicity, although he now says he is a bit embarrassed by
the attention.
   This weekend, dozens of Bell's former students returned to
Harvard to praise him for his protest.
   The issue of appointing a black female professor was raised last
month at the first faculty meeting of the academic year.
   Afterward, Law School Dean Robert C. Clark sent a letter to
students, saying: ``Diversity is clearly an issue that the faculty
takes seriously and it will be one of its central concerns over the
course of this year.''
   Detlev Vagts, a professor on the appointments committee, said he
thought the impact of Bell's protest would be ``marginal.''
   ``It keeps us from forgetting the question, but we weren't on
the point of forgetting,'' Vagts said. He said the school has a
relatively small pool of candidates to choose from in seeking a
black female professor, and ``one has to be in the top plateau.''
   The law school has 62 tenured professors, including three black
males. The school this year also has 18 visiting professors, and
one is a black woman.
   Of the 1,611 students, 183 are black and 106 of those students
are women, according to figures from the school.
   Bell said he sent letters to the dean and other faculty, saying
he felt he could not be a role model for black female students. But
he saw little action.
   ``My response to frustration is to do something,'' said Bell,
who turns 60 next month. ``It's particularly my response when I'm
thwarted by people who say, `I've got the power ... you can't do
anything.' ''
   Bell points out that he has acted this way before.
   In the late 1950s, Bell had a job with the U.S. Justice
Department. But his superiors ordered him to give up his membership
in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
claiming there was a conflict of interest.
   Bell disagreed and quit his job. After working a year for the
NAACP in Pittsburgh, Bell was asked by Thurgood Marshall to join
the staff of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.
   Bell says he has been ``rewarded by confronting.''
   While Bell has lost his salary, he makes money by accepting
invitations to lecture.
   Bell still holds his tenured position. He continues to work out
of his law school office, and he even decided to teach his regular
fall seminar on civil rights, although this year the 25 students
enrolled are not receiving any credit.
   Bell will continue his leave until a black woman receives tenure
at the law school. And he doesn't appear concerned about the
automatic loss of tenure if he remains on leave for two years.
   ``It's a no loss situation,'' he said. ``I've done what I want
to do. If the students get encouraged, fine. If not, at least I
tried.''

<HEAD>Former IRS Worker Pleads Guilty to Tax Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Internal Revenue Service employee has
pleaded guilty to tax fraud and theft in a scheme that involved
more than $1 million in fraudulent refunds.
   Patrick Smith, 29, faces up to 15 years in prison and a $500,000
fine. U.S. District Judge Kenneth M. Hoyt scheduled sentencing for
Jan. 14.
   Smith pleaded guilty Monday to two counts of an eight-count
indictment returned in May. The other counts were dropped.
   He was accused of filing five false returns in the names of
local taxpayers, each claiming a refund of slightly more than
$193,000, said Mike Schofield, an IRS spokesman. Smith pleaded
guilty to fraud and theft for cashing another tax refund check
valued at $151,784.
   The original indictment charged Smith established accounts in
three cities with a national stock brokerage firm, rented two post
office boxes in Houston to receive the refunds and deposited the
checks into the brokerage accounts.
   The government said it recovered nearly all the money.

<HEAD>Territories Sealed After Palestinian Stabs Two Women Soldiers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The occupied territories were sealed off today
on the orders of Defense Minister Moshe Arens after a rash of
revenge attacks by Jews and Arabs left one man dead and at least
seven injured.
   Under Arens' order, the 1.7 million Palestinian residents of the
occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip will be banned from entering
Israel beginning Wednesday morning. The military command said those
staying in Israel are ordered to return home immediately.
   The travel ban will remain in effect for ``several days'' until
tensions are reduced, Israel television said.
   Arens' order came hours after Israeli civilians fired on an Arab
car in the southern Negev desert, killing one Palestinian laborer
and wounding his three cousins.
   Doctors at Nasser Hospital in the Gaza Strip town of Khan Yunis
identified the victim as Maher Al Shaher, 30. One of the wounded
was in serious condition with a gunshot wound to the back and the
others were wounded in their arms and legs, they said.
   Palestinian reporters said the four were returning from work in
Israel when they came under fire from a red U.S.-made jeep in
Mivtahim, near Gaza. The Israeli news agency Itim said the injured
Palestinians managed to get to an army roadblock and reported the
attack to soldiers there.
   The army confirmed the Palestinians were apparently shot by
Jewish civilians firing from a car and said the attack was being
investigated by police.
   Earlier today, a West Bank Palestinian knifed two unarmed women
soldiers in Ashkelon and another Arab bludgeoned two Israelis in
the head with a hammer in a wave of attacks on Jews in Israel,
police said.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir assured Israelis that steps were
being taken to protect them.
   ``We are increasing security measures and security forces in all
parts of the country,'' Shamir told reporters after a speech in Tel
Aviv.
   Arens accused Palestinian groups of escalating violence in
Israel to divert world attention from the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Police spokesman Yehoshua Butbul said the wounded women soldiers
were rushed to Rambam Hospital in the nearby port of Haifa and that
the assailant was caught by other soldiers.
   One of the women was in serious condition with a knife wound in
the chest that punctured a lung, said Dr. Albert Suttinger, deputy
director of Rambam.
   The other suffered a superficial back wound, Suttinger said. The
victims' names were not immediately released.
   The attack occurred this morning as the soldiers waited for a
ride near the Kiryat Tivon, Butbul said.
   A truck with blue license plates, indicating ownership by a
Palestinian from the occupied West Bank, stopped and the driver got
out, Israel radio reported from the scene.
   ``He took out a knife and started to stab the soldiers,'' the
radio said, adding that the women were not armed.
   Radio reports said civilians assisted in the capture.
   ``We chased him and then he threw down the knife and we grabbed
him,'' one Israeli civilian, Eli Koman, told Israel radio. ``We
held him down and shouted at the soldiers to shoot and kill him.
They wouldn't. I asked one of them to give me his rifle, he
refused.''
   An off-duty bus driver identified as Albert Ben-Ezra told army
radio he pursued the assailant as he ran towrd farm fields. ``I
saw him throw the knife and then I grabbed him,'' the driver said.
``Then I heard shots fired in the air, and the soldiers came and
helped me grab him.''
   The bus driver, who said he had two daughters serving in the
army, said he and the assailant exchanged punches. Israel radio
said both were hospitalized with beating wounds.
   Israel radio said the suspect, who was taken to a hospital for
treatment, told police he had driven into Israel with the intent of
attacking Jews.
   The suspect was identified only as a 39-year-old Palestinian
from the Jenin area, about 20 miles southeast of the crime scene.
   In Jenin, a town of 20,000 people surrounded by refugee camps,
soldiers shot and killed a 14-year-old Arab youth during
stone-throwing protests on Monday. Eight others were wounded.
   There was no immediate indication of whether the suspect was
avenging the teen-ager's death.
   In Ashkelon, the two victims of the hammer attack were
identified as Israelis in their late 40s, army radio said. The
Palestinian was apprehended after a brief chase, the radio said.
   The attacks came as police blocked Arabs from the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip from entering Jerusalem for a second day.
   The ban was aimed at preventing clashes following the stabbing
deaths of three Israelis by a Palestinian man in Jerusalem on
Sunday.
   A 19-year-old Arab construction worker was arrested in the
Sunday stabbings, which resulted in the deaths of an unarmed woman
soldier, a gardener and a policeman.
   On Monday, an Israeli delivery man was stabbed and slightly
wounded by a Palestinian in Jerusalem. Two other stabbing attacks
by Palestinians against Israeli soldiers occurred in the Gaza
Strip. Neither was fatal.
   Serious clashes in Jerusalem began Oct. 8, when police fired on
Moslems on the sacred Temple Mount after they stoned Jewish
worshipers at the nearby Western Wall. At least 19 Palestinians
were killed and 140 wounded.
   The death of the 14-year-old on Monday raised to 763 the number
of Palestinians killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians in the
34-month-old uprising against Israeli occupation.
   An additional 284 were slain by fellow Arabs, most for allegedly
collaborating with Israel. Fifty-one Israelis have died in the
violence.

<HEAD>Saudi Envoy Denies Urging Kuwait Yield Territory To Iraq</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia's ambassador sought Tuesday to
puncture reports that the Persian Gulf crisis is easing or that his
government proposes allowing Iraq to hold on to some Kuwaiti
territory in exchange for an end to Iraq's occupation.
   ``There is nothing that is encouraging for me,'' Prince Bandar
said after reviewing the situation for 85 minutes with Secretary of
State James A. Baker III.
   ``We have not heard from anyone that Saddam Hussein is willing
to withdraw from Kuwait,'' the envoy said, referring to the Iraq
president's Aug. 2 invasion of the oil-rich emirate that prompted
President Bush to send more than 200,000 U.S. troops to defend
Saudi Arabia.
   Some of the speculation of a peaceful resolution was based on
reports in The New York Times and elsewhere that Prince Sultan, the
Saudi defense minister who is Bandar's father, had raised the
possibility of allowing Iraq to have some Kuwaiti territory as an
outlet to the gulf.
   But Bandar, in two sessions with reporters in the doorway of the
State Department, insisted the reports were off the mark.
   ``This is a decision for the Kuwaitis, not for us,'' Bandar
said.
   ``Saudi Arabia has not suggested there should be concesions
made to anyone,'' the ambassador added.
   According to the reports, Sultan said: ``We in Saudi Arabia have
given parts of our land and parts of our territorial waters
willingly. But this came through good will, noble manners and
brotherhood.''
   He referred apparently to territorial settlements concluded in
the past by Saudi Arabia, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates.
   The Iraqi ambassador, Mohamed al-Mashat, responded on ABC-TV's
``Good Morning America that ``this speaks of a readiness to
negotiate, which was always the case with us.''
   But Bandar ruled out any dividends for Saddam Hussein, a
position strongly stressed by Baker in Congressional testimony last
week.
   ``You cannot make aggression pay,'' the Saudi envoy said. ``If
you make aggression pay, that's the law of the jungle.''
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Bandar had
confirmed to Baker that the Saudis had not changed their policy.
   Bandar said Saddam ``should not be under any disillusion.''
   The ambassador said his father, the defense minister, ``was not
implying Kuwait should do one thing or another. He was talking
about what we have done with other countries, negotiating as
friends. Saddam did not choose that route.''
   Asked if Saudi Arabia, which with Egypt forms the backbone of
the Arab alliance against Iraq, had softened its stand, Bandar
replied: ``No, absolutely not.''

<HEAD>U.S. Conditions On Military Aid Seen as Spur to Peace Process</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Senate's decision to
slash military aid to El Salvador was a defeat for President
Alfredo Cristiani, but some Salvadoran leaders say the vote may get
peace talks moving.
   Justice Minister Oscar Santamaria called Friday's vote to halve
the $85 million in previously alloted military aid the result of
``successful incursions by the FMLN in Washington.''
   He was referring to the Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front, the leftist rebel army that for 11 years has waged a civil
war against a succession of U.S.-backed governments.
   ``It's not as if we don't need the aid. Because those fighting
the system, those in the FMLN, are still waging their battle,''
Santamaria said Monday.
   But Santamaria, head of the government delegation to peace talks
with the rebels, also emphasized that the U.S. move provides an
incentive to the FMLN to contribute more to the success of the
peace process.
   According to the aid bill, the slashed $42.5 million would be
restored if the guerrillas launch a major offensive or if they fail
to demonstrate good faith in the negotiations.
   All military aid would be cut off if the government withdraws
from the peace negotiations.
   Peace talks have bogged down on the issue of the future role of
the armed forces.
   The rebels demand a drastic purge and reduction of security
forces that would culminate in the ``demilitarization'' of
Salvadoran society.
   The government says it is in favor of weeding out negative
elements from the army. But it rejects a wholesale purge.
   Monsignor Gregorio Rosa Chavez, Roman Catholic auxiliary bishop
of San Salvador, told a news conference Sunday that the aid cut
``gives rise to signs of hope because it is a recognition that
peace cannot be constructed with arms.''
   He said the congressional move ``makes the peace process more
viable.''
   Rebel and government negotiators are scheduled to resume peace
talks Nov. 4 in Mexico.
   Juan Jose Martell, a leader of the leftist Popular Social
Christian Movement, said the reduction and conditioning of the aid
``is a positive message to both sides in the conflict.
   ``The legislators are saying to the government, `If you behave
badly, we cut it all' and they're saying to the FMLN, `If you
launch an offensive or negotiate in bad faith you'll be
contributing to the restoration of all the aid.' This is a way of
saying the negotiation must progress and peace must come soon,''
said Martell.
   But the defense minister, Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, said the cut
in aid constituted ``a negative signal to everything that
represents the country's institutionality and a positive signal to
the belligerent adventure planned by the FMLN. It would prolong the
conflict.''
   He said the cut ``would mean limits on the logistical and
operational fields. But the armed forces have been preparing to
face this situation for some time.''
   More than 70,000 people have been killed in the civil war, and
many of the deaths have been blamed on right-wing death squads
operating in cooperation with the military. Several military
officials have been charged in the murders last year of six Jesuit
priests, their housekeeper and her daughter.
   ``People are just fed up with this thing,'' Sen. Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn., said after the Friday vote, referring to the
millions of dollars in U.S. aid sent to El Salvador over the past
decade.

   Twelve years after toxic waste bubbling out
of the ground forced the evacuation of Love Canal, the government
and the company that dumped the waste are going to court Wednesday
to begin dividing up the bill.
   As much as $700 million is at stake for Occidental Chemical
Corp. and four levels of government: the city of Niagara Falls, its
school board, New York state and the federal government.
   The two-phase, non-jury trial is expected to last more than two
years.
   After toxic waste began seeping into basements and backyards in
the middle-class Niagara Falls neighborhood, Love Canal quickly
became a symbol of the nation's hazardous waste problems.
   President Carter declared a state of emergency in the
neighborhood in the summer of 1978, and about 2,500 people left
their homes. Nearly 300 houses were bulldozed; hundreds more remain
boarded up despite a state agency's efforts to resettle part of the
area.
   Occidental already has been found liable for at least some of
the cleanup costs because a company it purchased in 1968, Hooker
Chemicals and Plastics Co., created the dump in 1942. Dallas-based
Occidental paid $20 million in 1984 to settle a separate lawsuit
brought by 1,345 former Love Canal residents.
   Occidental attorney Thomas H. Truitt said Tuesday the company
does not dispute that Hooker dumped 21,800 tons of dioxin,
pesticide byproducts and other highly toxic chemicals in an
abandoned canal bed dug in the 1890s by an entrepreneur named
William Love.
   Truitt said Occidental expects it will have to pay most of the
actual cleanup costs, which the state and federal governments have
estimated at $140 million.
   ``We put the stuff in the canal,'' Truitt said. ``It's our
stuff.''
   The state is also seeking $310 million for damages to the
environment, for creating a public nuisance and for interest, and
$250 million in punitive damages for what it claims was Hooker's
reckless conduct at the dump.
   Lawyers for both sides said it is unprecedented for a state to
seek punitive damages in a toxic-dumping case. The first two months
of the trial are expected to focus on that claim.
   Occidental argues the dump was well-built by the standards of
the 1940s and would not have leaked had the school board and,
later, the city and a private developer not dug it up to build
roads, houses and an elementary school.
   A warning about the buried wastes was written into the deed when
the company sold the dump to the school board in 1953, and the
company says it sent lawyers to a school board meeting in 1957 to
repeat the warning when the board first began thinking of selling
off part of the property.
   The state concedes the warnings were made but contends they were
innocuously worded compared to what Hooker knew at the time was
going on at the dump.
   ``The deed refers only to `waste products resulting from the
manufacturing of chemicals by the grantor at its plants,' which
could have meant harmless rubbish,'' Eugene Martin-Leff, the top
state lawyer in the case, wrote in a pretrial brief.
   After deciding the punitive-damage issue, Judge John T. Curtin
will take two to four months more to hear Occidental's arguments
that the federal, state and city governments and the school board
should share the responsibility because they either dumped on the
property or owned it after Hooker.
   Once the judge has ruled who is liable, the trial will recess
for about 18 months while the lawyers prepare arguments over how
much each party should pay.

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with three grafs to UPDATE with where hospitalized,

   Zephania Mothopeng, who broke
away from the African National Congress to help form and lead the
militant Pan Africanist Congress, died Tuesday. He was 77.
   He had been suffering from cancer and pneumonia, and was listed
in critical condition the past week by doctors at Johannesburg
Hospital. Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, another major
anti-apartheid figure, visited the PAC president earlier Tuesday.
   Mothopeng lived his last years a few blocks from the Soweto
homes of fellow black nationalists Nelson Mandela and Walter
Sisulu, but his militant stance kept him far from the more moderate
ANC leaders.
   Like Mandela and Sisulu, Mothopeng spent years in prison for his
political activities. Like his neighbors, the imprisoned Mothopeng
became a symbol of the black struggle against the government.
   His release from Johannesburg's Diepkloof Prison in November
1988 preceded reforms that included freedom for the ANC leaders and
government promises to include blacks in a new constitution.
   In their first public statements after being freed, both
Mothopeng and Mandela urged the continuation of the armed struggle
against the government. But unlike Mandela and other ANC leaders,
Mothopeng opposed talks with the government intended to pave the
way for a new constitution.
   The Pan Africanist Congress refuses to recognize the white-led
government and opposes sharing power.
   Power should be returned to the indigenous Africans, Mothopeng
said.
   ``The question is one of the repossession of our land from
foreign colonial oppressors,'' he said in an interview this year.
   ``Our liberation will be brought about by the Africans
themselves, by having to struggle for it. They will not achieve it
at the negotiating tables,'' he said.
   Mothopeng was born Sept. 10, 1913, in South Africa's Orange Free
State and became involved in politics in 1940, when he joined the
ANC's Youth Wing. In 1959, unhappy with the ANC's contact with
activists of other races, Mothopeng and others broke away from the
ANC and formed the Pan Africanist Congress.
   It is a militant group compared to the ANC, urging black
self-reliance in the land Mothopeng calls Azania. The PAC contends
blacks must struggle for their freedom and find dignity in the
process, rather than gaining equality through white concession or
compromise.
   Mothopeng was jailed three times for his political activities,
the longest stretch beginning in 1976 after his conviction on
terrorism charges. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison and
elected president of the Pan Africanist Congress in 1986 while
imprisoned.
   Mothopeng was diagnosed with throat cancer while in prison, and
the disease spread to other parts of his body. The government
released him after 12 years.

   King Fahd said Tuesday that Saddam
Hussein would not lose face if he withdrew from Kuwait, and Egypt's
Hosni Mubarak expressed hope the Persian Gulf crisis would end
without bloodshed.
   The remarks, taken together with earlier comments by Defense
Minister Prince Sultan, appeared to be the most conciliatory
messages to the Iraqi leader since the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   But Saudi Arabia also insisted that Prince Sultan had been
misquoted, and denied it wants Kuwait to yield territory to Iraq in
order to defuse the crisis. Those reports had helped push oil
prices down more than $5 a barrel Monday.
   The Saudis reasserted Tuesday that Saddam must pull out his
troops from Kuwait unconditionally.
   ``The correct reply is to remedy the mistake (of invading
Kuwait),'' Fahd told reporters in remarks distributed by the
official Saudi Press Agency.
   ``It would be nothing to cause anxiety or pain, but to the
contrary, if President Saddam thought seriously about the matter,
he would find that it is in the interest of Iraq, in his personal
interest, and in the interest of the Arab nation, that he pull out
from Kuwait,'' Fahd said in Jiddah, the Saudi summer capital.
   In Arab culture, losing face is considered a major dishonor.
Arab conflicts traditionally are handed over to a respected
mediator trusted by both sides. If his decision is accepted by both
sides, ``face'' can be preserved.
   So far, apart from early efforts by King Hussein of Jordan, no
such mediator has emerged.
   Mubarak, the Egyptian president, visited Saudi Arabia to meet
with some of his 14,000 troops deployed at the northeastern region
of Hafr al-Batin and told them their presence was meant to ``force
him who lost his reason to return to it.''
   He also expressed Egypt's hope that the gulf crisis ``end
without bloodshed or war.''
   Addressing his soldiers, Mubarak warned against any settlement
of the Kuwait crisis that does not provide for reinstating the
deposed al-Sabah family.
   ``Only the people (of Kuwait) have the right to choose their
government and regime,'' Mubarak said.
   On Sunday, Prince Sultan, the Saudi defense minister, insisted
on an unconditional Iraqi pullout from Kuwait and suggested that
after such a withdrawal, negotiations could be held to consider
Iraq's long-standing border dispute with Kuwait.
   Prince Sultan, third in the Saudi leadership after King Fahd and
Crown Prince Abdullah, said that ``rights, whether valid or
doubtful'' could always be discussed, but only after Iraqi
withdrawal.
   Some took the prince's remarks as a sign that the Saudis were
ready to agree to territorial concessions by Kuwait. This was a
factor in a plunge in oil prices on Monday.
   Prince Sultan subsequently issued a statement ``to clarify ...
wrong interpretations'' of his words, reaffirming that ``the
kingdom categorically rejects the Iraqi aggression on sister
Kuwait.''
   In Washington, meanwhile, Prince Bandar, the Saudi ambassador
and Prince Sultan's son, also denied his kingdom wants Kuwait to
concede territory.
   Prince Bandar was summoned to the State Department to clarify
Saudi policy. He spoke after meeting with Secretary of State James
A. Baker III.
   In the Saudi resort town of Taif, a spokesman for the Kuwaiti
government in exile stressed that Prince Sultan had been
``misquoted.''
   The spokesman, who by custom was not identified by name, said
the exiled government's view was ``that there can be no
negotiations and no conditions'' regarding an Iraqi withdrawal from
Kuwait.
   He said the exiled government believed there had been no change
in Saudi policy.

   The State Department accused the Burmese
military Tuesday of ``a total disregard for human rights'' in the
reported raids on Buddhist monasteries.
   Troops in the Southeast Asian country arrested 20 monks at one
Buddhist monastery Tuesday and surrounded 11 other monasteries in
Burma's religious center of Mandalay as part of a crackdown on
dissent, according to sources in Rangoon.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Burmese
government radio reports said 133 monasteries were raided on
Monday. She said department officials could not determine how many
monks had been arrested.
   Burmese monks have been refusing to provide religious services
for soldiers or their families, which in the Buddhist religion is
the equivalent of excommunication.
   The monks' actions followed the Aug. 8 suppression of a protest
in Mandalay. Western diplomats said two monks and two other people
were killed in the confrontation.
   ``The United States views these raids as one more proof of the
regime's total disregard for human rights,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
``Its object seems to be the suppression of even token opposition
in Burma. We strongly condemn this latest action by the Burmese
military.''
   Ms. Tutwiler also reiterated the U.S. call for the Burmese
military government to transfer power to a civilian government and
release all political prisoners.
   The government of Gen. Saw Maung has refused to turn over power
despite the overwhelming victory in May elections of the opposition
National League for Democracy. Opposition leaders have been jailed,
and human rights groups accuse the military government of
widespread abuses.

<HEAD>Governing Party Loses Parliamentary Majority With Key Defection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A right-wing Hindu party deserted Prime
Minister V.P. Singh's coalition Tuesday, depriving the government
of a parliamentary majority. But Singh pledged to hang on to power.
   The walkout was prompted by the arrest Tuesday of the rightist
party's leader, who had stirred tension between Hindus and Moslems
by campaigning for a new Hindu temple on the site of a Moslem
mosque.
   Singh went on national television to appeal for calm, fearing
the political turmoil arising from a conflict between Hindus and
Moslems could provoke violence.
   ``At this moment, and it is a very tense moment, my heart goes
out to the innocent children, men, women who today are under
tension and under fear,'' he said.
   Initial reports said scattered violence erupted around the
country. United News of India said three people were stabbed to
death during rioting in Ahmedabad in western India.
   At least 80 people died this month in riots between Hindus and
Moslems. They usually were set off by minor squabbles, but were
attributed to the Hindu temple dispute.
   Despite the defection, Singh said he was not quitting and will
command enough support to maintain his 10-month-old government when
Parliament reconvenes. Privately, his aides said it was unlikely
the government would complete its four-year term and an early
election was probable next year.
   The legislature is in recess for another three weeks, although
President Ramaswamy Venkataraman has the power to convene it early.
   Venkataraman could let events in Parliament take their course
when it begins its session next month. He also could ask the
opposition Congress Party, the largest in Parliament, to try to
form a new government, or he could call early elections.
   ``The government has been transferred from intensive care to the
terminal ward,'' said V.N. Gadgil, a Congress Party spokesman. His
party was ousted in last year's election.
   Officials in Singh's Janata Dal Party said they believed the
Hindu party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, would stop short of voting
against the government, since there was no viable alternative.
   The Hindu party's leaders said they would consider rejoining
Singh's coalition if Singh were replaced.
   Singh's minority National Front government relied on the Hindu
party and on the Communist-led Left Front to stay in office.
Neither was formally part of the government.
   The political crisis was prompted by the arrest of the Hindu
party's president, Lal Krishna Advani, during his cross-country
crusade for building a Hindu temple where a mosque now stands in
the Hindu holy town of Ayodhya.
   Advani was detained at dawn near the village of Samastipur, 450
miles southeast of New Delhi.
   Charges against Advani were not published. But up to 20,000 of
his supporters were put under preventative arrest to stop what
authorities feared could become a bloodbath between the two
communities. The Hindu party claimed the figure was closer to
50,000.
   Hindus say the 16th century mosque was built on the ruins of an
earlier temple on the site where the Hindu god Lord Rama was born.
A fundamentalist Hindu group says it will begin building a new
temple there Oct. 30, defying a court injunction.
   Thousands of Moslems and Hindus have died in the long history of
communal bloodshed in the Indian subcontinent. Violence prompted
the partition of colonial India into Moslem Pakistan and
predominantly Hindu India when Britain granted independence in
1947.

<HEAD>Pentagon May Start New Wave of Troop Deployments to Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-US-Gulf, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon is considering a new wave of
troop deployments to the Persian Gulf, officials said Tuesday. Such
a move would take the gulf buildup beyond the 240,000-troop force
now planned.
   The decision is important because the deployment of more
American ground units to Saudi Arabia could transform Operation
Desert Shield from a force capable only of defending against a
possible Iraqi attack to one tailored to launching an offensive.
   Officials also said evidence is emerging that U.N. economic
sanctions against Iraq for its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait are
beginning to hamper Iraqi military operations.
   Pete Williams, a spokesman for Defense Secretary Dick Cheney,
said more than 210,000 U.S. forces now are in and around Saudi
Arabia as part of Operation Desert Shield to defend the desert
kingdom against a possible Iraqi attack. That's 10,000 more than
the last official count issued by Cheney on Oct. 13.
   Williams said Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, was in Saudi Arabia this week to consult with U.S. and
Saudi officials on the possible need to expand Desert Shield
deployments, which President Bush ordered Aug. 7.
   Powell will report his recommendations to Cheney after returning
to Washington on Thursday, Williams said.
   ``Then those decisions will be made on whether additional forces
need to be sent or not,'' Williams said. ``So I don't want to ...
signal that the deployment is nearly complete - that's a decision
that will be made in part this week by Gen. Powell's visit.''
   In comments to reporters in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, Powell
said Tuesday that he and Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander of
all U.S. forces in the gulf area, had ``explored all options'' for
Desert Shield. Powell declined to comment specifically on
additional troop deployments.
   Williams said it had been planned all along that U.S. troop
requirements in the gulf would be reassessed once the initial round
of deployments was nearing completion.
   U.S. ground forces in Saudi Arabia now include four Army
divisions, three Marine Corps expeditionary brigades, an air
defense artillery brigade, a mechanized infantry brigade and an
armored cavalry regiment. Also in the gulf area are more than 500
aircraft and 55 ships, including aircraft carriers and a
battleship.
   An Army source, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said it
was also possible that Powell would recommend reducing the number
of American forces in the region, depending on military estimates
of Iraq's troop strength and other factors.
   Bush repeatedly has said he has not ruled out the use of force
to push Iraqi troops from occupied Kuwait.
   Williams said U.S. intelligence estimates put Iraqi troop
strength in Kuwait and southern Iraq at 430,000 - unchanged over
the last month. He added that American authorities have no evidence
to substantiate recent news reports that Iraqi forces are pulling
back from the Saudi border to fortify defenses to the north.
   The Iraqi military remains capable of launching an offensive
strike with little warning, Williams said, although its operations
are starting to be hurt by the effects of the U.N. sanctions, which
have cut off most trade with Iraq.
   Williams cited Iraq's recent announcement of rationing civilian
gasoline supplies as a sign that even the military is threatened by
the economic embargo. He said the Iraqi military is short of tires,
spare parts and other supplies and has been forced to make ``some
adjustments'' in its operations in Kuwait.
   He did not elaborate, but said of the Iraqis:
   ``As time goes by, the sanctions continue to have effect. It
becomes harder and harder to support that (military) force as the
embargo restricts the shipment of spare parts and supplies.''

<TEXT>
   A deposed KGB general accused his former bosses in
court Tuesday of stripping his rank, honors and pension to punish
him for publicly criticizing the intelligence agency.
   If he wins reinstatement, Oleg Kalugin's civil lawsuit against
the KGB could become a landmark for Soviet citizens seeking
protection for free speech and challenging the secrecy of
government decisions.
   The 55-year-old former general, who was an intelligence agent in
the United States from 1958 to 1970, contends in the suit that KGB
Chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov secretly ordered his demotion in June.
   Kalugin claims the order was in retaliation for comments he made
to the Soviet press and on television that the KGB was resisting
reform and continuing to spy on citizens opposed to the Communist
Party.
   ``I think Kryuchkov's actions represent not only arbitrary rule
against me, personally, but also a form of legal gangsterism, and I
can't call it anything else,'' he told the three-judge panel in
Moscow City Court.
   Kryuchkov has denied the allegations. He did not attend the
hearing, the second since the trial opened Oct. 2. The KGB has
alleged the orders for Kalugin's dismissal were received from the
Council of Ministers, or national Cabinet, and no specific reasons
have been given for his firing.
   Kalugin's fight with the KGB has made him a popular hero and
helped him win a seat in the 2,250-member Soviet Congress,
representing the southern Russian city of Krasnodar. The judges
repeatedly had to call for order as the room full of spectators
applauded Kalugin's lawyer and heckled the KGB's attorney.
   ``Oh my, we've hurt the KGB's feelings, isn't that too bad,'' an
elderly woman called out sarcastically after the KGB lawyer, Viktor
Alexeyev, complained about the outbursts.
   Kalugin's attorney, Boris A. Kuznetsov, argued that the
13-member Council of Ministers never met to consider Kalugin's
case. He said the order was signed by Prime Minister Nikolai I.
Ryzhkov, at Kryuchkov's behest, and that documents later were
fabricated to make it look as though the full council approved.
   After listening to both sides, the judges adjourned the case
until mid-November. Chief Judge Nikolai Romanenkov said they were
waiting for answers to questions they sent last month to the
Council of Ministers and military prosecutor's office.
   The court asked the Council of Ministers to provide documents
about how, when and why the decision was made to strip Kalugin of
his rank. The military prosecutor was asked to describe the status
of a possible criminal lawsuit against Kalugin.
   Soviet newspapers have said the prosecutor was investigating
Kalugin on a potential charge of revealing state secrets.
   The former general has said he once headed the KGB's section on
counterintelligence. He has denied revealing any national secrets.
   The KGB's efforts to disgrace him ``are illegal, they are not
based on any laws of the Soviet state, they contradict common
sense, and they violate the human rights of a person who served in
the armed forces for more than 30 years,'' Kalugin told the court.
   At the Oct. 2 hearing, Viktor Alexeyev, chief of the KGB legal
department, told the court that the agency revoked Kalugin's
military pension after he was demoted, in accordance with a Soviet
law. Alexeyev told said the KGB decision was based on an order the
Council of Ministers issued June 29.
   The KGB is considered a branch of the armed forces, responsible
for guarding borders, protecting top officials, collecting
intelligence abroad and combatting both foreign spies and Soviet
criminals.
   Kalugin's accusations hit the KGB particularly hard last summer,
because the agency had just begun a public relations campaign to
change its image
   Through interviews, films and television shows, the agency has
sought to convince Soviets it is concerned with counterespionage
and fighting corruption, and has given up harassing dissidents and
tapping telephones.

   Tamil rebels shot and hacked to death
10 Sinhalese villagers in an attack early Tuesday in north-central
Sri Lanka, military officials said.
   The militants crept inside the village of Kadecholai, 60 miles
southeast of Jaffna, and killed the villagers as they slept, Brig.
Jaliya Nammune said. He said the victims included women and
children.
   Military officials blamed the attack on the separatist
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam militia.
   More than 14,000 people have been killed since the Tamil militia
launched the separatist war in 1983.
   The attack came as the Sinhalese-dominated military pressed on
with a week-old campaign to widen perimeters around five key
military installations in the Jaffna peninsula, a Tamil stronghold.
   The 410-square-mile peninsula forms the northern-most part of
the island.
   Jaffna has been a major battleground in the insurrection for a
separate homeland for the Tamil minority. The latest round of
fighting flared in August, ending a 13-month cease-fire called to
negotiate peace.
   Reporters were flown into Jaffna on Tuesday and taken around
areas captured from the rebels. Almost every house had been
converted into a bunker, linked to each other with tunnels.
   Less than a half-mile from Kankesanthurai town, which was
captured Sunday night, soldiers fired mortars and automatic weapons
at rebels in bunkers.
   Lt. Gen. Dezil Kobbekaduwa said 119 rebels and 20 soldiers have
been killed in the week-old military offensive.
   The rebels claim they killed 50 soldiers and lost only 15 of
their fighters. They had denied losing any village or town.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of the island's 16 million people and
the Sinhalese comprise 75 percent. The Sinhalese control the
military and the government. The Tamils complain of discrimation by
the Sinhalese in jobs and education.

<HEAD>Presidential Scholar Defends Role Of Nancy Reagan In White House</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Grafs 10-15 new with Neustadt comments on other first ladies</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Presidential scholar Richard Neustadt, no fan
of former President Reagan, emerges as a defender of Reagan's wife,
Nancy, in a new edition of his classic study, ``Presidential
Power.''
   ``Never let your Nancy be immobilized, could be a rule of thumb
for future presidents,'' Neustadt writes.
   The Harvard professor argues that Reagan could have saved
himself a lot of trouble if the first lady had been able to advise
him on the Iran-Contra affair.
   She could not, he says, because Reagan relied on the late
William J. Casey, the secretive director of the Central
Intelligence Agency, ``in such a way as to cut Nancy off'' from
knowledge of the arms-for-hostages deal.
   Neustadt's description of Mrs. Reagan's role as an adviser
contrasts with that of fired White House chief of staff Donald T.
Regan, who revealed in his memoirs that some of her advice, on
matters of the president's schedule, depended on astrology.
   This, Neustadt concedes, was ``silly, to be sure, though
possibly no more so than the whims of staff, or press, or
partisans, or family quite traditional in such decisions.''
   ``But when it came to people, her reported targets seem well
chosen, aim unerring and timing right for someone who must wait for
someone else to pull the trigger,'' he writes.
   Mrs. Reagan was widely reported to have pressed for the removal
of Regan, who was dismissed in 1987 after criticism of his handling
of the Iran-Contra affair, and Attorney General Edwin Meese III,
who resigned in 1988 after a special prosecutor completed an
investigation of him without seeking an indictment.
   ``Nancy Reagan was perhaps that rarity, a disinterested
adviser,'' Neustadt says. ``Alternatively, perhaps she was
neurotically obsessed, as her detractors hint. Either way, her
husband's close associates, however valuable or liked or even
loved, were to be sacrificed, in her view, from the moment their
continuation on the scene could compromise the president's public
relations.''
   In a telephone interview, Neustadt said, ``I must say I was
offended by some of the attacks on her, which it seemed to me took
no account either of her loyalty or the position she was in. But I
wasn't trying to cheer or jeer or anything. That's the best I could
understand, so that's the way I put it.''
   Neustadt said former President Carter's wife, Rosalynn,
``apparently was in her way as close to her husband as Mrs. Reagan
seems to have been to Ronald Reagan. But Mrs. Carter, as best I
understand it, was ... someone he was interested in consulting
about all his affairs, and interested in substance and politics.
That's not my impression of Mrs. Reagan. She was interested in him
and in his reputation and his place in history.''
   The author said the role of President Eisenhower's wife, Mamie,
``was much more that of a conventional wife.''
   He said Bess Truman, who had been an assistant in President
Truman's office when he was a senator, ``was in her public demeanor
totally self-effacing, but in private had felt herself to be a
private counselor to her husband on everything.''
   In his book, Neustadt writes that President Franklin D.
Roosevelt's wife, Eleanor, ``was a substitute for legs, hence eyes
and ears, outside her husband's physical confines. She also was an
inescapable (and often useful) hairshirt on social issues. But she
was not an intimate. Nancy Reagan, on the other hand, specialized
in intimacy.''
   He describes her as ``the president's closest, perhaps only,
friend.''
   The author portrays Reagan as inexperienced in foreign affairs
and strikingly lacking in intellectual curiosity.
   ``Personally, I prefer presidents of the other sort, more
skeptical than trustful, more curious than committed, more nearly
Roosevelts than Reagans,'' he says.
   ``Still, it may be that his greatest lack was not experience,
direct or indirect ... but rather anything to activate the aide in
charge of warning him when threats appeared against his public
standing or historical appeal.
   ``That special staff role, of immense importance to someone
habitually incurious about detail, had been assigned his wife. More
precisely, she had made it hers since Sacramento.'' Reagan began
his political career as governor of California.
   ``Presidential Power'' was first published in 1960 and has been
updated several times. The new edition, entitled ``Presidential
Power and the Modern Presidents,'' is scheduled for publication
Oct. 29 by The Free Press, a division of Macmillan, Inc. Neustadt
is a professor emeritus at the John F. Kennedy School of
Government, Harvard University.
   Neustadt says the Iran-Contra episode will not dominate the
history of the Reagan administration because Reagan recovered from
it. Nevertheless, he says, it is a textbook case of a president
failing to guard his prospective influence and making himself
vulnerable to personal misjudgments and dubious advice.
   ``The crucial issue of the president's use of prospective
influence lies in wait for every incumbent,'' writes Neustadt.
``Bush cannot escape it any more than Reagan could. But possibly to
see it with an Iran-Contra sharpness is to see it plainer than
before. That might conduce to dealing with it better, better at
least than in my judgment Reagan did.''

<HEAD>Researchers: Toxic Shock Effect on Rise From Strep Bacteria</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bacterial infection that may be as serious as
toxic shock syndrome is on the rise and is targeting children as
well as adults, researchers reported Tuesday.
   New research points to significant changes in the pattern of
severe streptococcal infections, Dr. Charles Hoge of the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control reported Tuesday at an American Society
for Microbiology conference.
   Strep is a common microbe, most frequently thought of as the
cause of strep throat. But in rare cases, it can cause extremely
serious infections - such as the pneumonia that killed Muppets
creator Jim Henson in May.
   Three years ago, researchers began to talk of toxic shock
syndrome caused by streptococcal infections, not the staph bacteria
implicated in the much-publicized illness linked to tampon use.
   Now, researchers from the CDC and in Pima County, Ariz., have
studied 128 cases of group-A streptococcal infections in 10
hospitals in the Tucson area to determine the prevalence of the
most severe cases.
   The study involved records between January 1985 and March 1990.
   Fifty-four cases occurred from 1985 to 1987. None of those met a
series of conditions similar to toxic shock syndrome: low blood
pressure, rash, peeling skin, multi-organ involvement. But six of
the 74 infections studied from 1988 to 1990 did.
   One of those six patients died, Hoge said. For all the county's
severe group-A strep infection patients, the death rate was 20
percent.
   Laboratory tests on the bacterial isolates from Pima County
found a propensity toward production of a specific toxin, and that
toxin was present in at least two of the six toxic-shock-like
cases. Toxic shock syndrome gets its name from the toxins produced
by the bacteria at fault.
   The exact case definition of ``strep toxic shock'' is yet to be
determined. But based on the cluster of symptoms in the Arizona
study and the laboratory findings, that toxin may be the culprit,
Hoge said.
   While the study was limited to the one populous county, the
pattern is clear, Hoge said: Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome was
significantly more likely to occur after 1988.
   More studies are needed to characterize the exact toxins present
in the Arizona cases, which would provide more clues as to the
exact nature of the illnesses, Hoge said. But he and his colleagues
reported that changes in the strains of the strep bacteria may be
responsible for the changing seriousness of strep infections.
   As in Henson's case, severe strep complications have been seen
most frequently in adults.
   But three of the Arizona cases occurred in children. And other
researchers at the conference reported new outbreaks of serious
strep infections in children.
   Doctors at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Mo.,
reported that eight of their 29 cases of group-A strep infections
between 1971-90 had the pattern of feverish illness, tender skin,
multisystem involvement - ``reminiscent of ... toxic shock
syndrome.''
   One of the eight cases occurred earlier this year, and three
more this year have followed the study. ``We have not had four
children previously in one year with multisystemic streptococcal
syndrome,'' said Dr. Mary Anne Jackson.
   And doctors at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia,
reported 16 such cases over a 10-year period.
   That remains rare, given hundreds of strep cultures a year in a
large hospital, said Dr. Scott Halperin, an associate professor at
Dalhousie.
   ``But for 16 kids it's an important issue - tremendously
important,'' he said. ``And as a scientific issue, we wonder why
the organism has had changes in its pathogenesis over time.''
   Neither the Kansas City study nor the Halifax study included
specific toxin tests.
   ``But it certainly is a multisystemic disease,'' Jackson said.
``We're trying to draw the attention of clinicians to this entity
... tell them to think of this.''
   When group-A strep infections proceed to the bloodstream, the
fatality rate is 20 percent to 30 percent. Strep was once the
frequent cause of serious illnesses such as scarlet fever and
rheumatic fever, but the most dangerous strains, for the most part,
faded from view around the 1940s.
   Henson was the most famous recent victim of streptococcal
illness; he died of a severe and rapidly spreading pneumonia.

<HEAD>Nevis Leader Urges Secession from St. Kitts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BASSETERRE, St. Kitts (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The premier of the Caribbean island
of Nevis has urged secession from its larger neighbor St. Kitts
through a change in the tiny nation's constitution.
   But Simeon Daniel did not elaborate on what steps are being
taken toward independence for Nevis, which has about 20 percent of
the twin-island nation's 43,700 residents.
   Daniel, who made the comments Monday during an assembly of his
Nevis Reformation Party, predicted secession could come before the
next local elections in Nevis in December 1992.
   St. Kitts and Nevis, one of the world's smallest nations, became
independent from Britain in 1983. St. Kitts is 68 square miles, and
Nevis is 36 square miles.
   Under the 1983 constitution, Nevis has extensive local powers as
well as its own premier and assembly. But Daniel has complained of
neglect by the central government in Basseterre.
   The convention was held in Charlestown on Nevis, about 200 miles
southeast of Puerto Rico. The two islands are two miles apart.
   Daniel's party has a coalition with the ruling People's Action
Movement led by Prime Minister Kennedy Simmonds.

<HEAD>Preliminary Tests Encouraging On Killer Cotton Plants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Preliminary tests of cotton plants genetically
engineered to kill bugs themselves have been encouraging, the
Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   The department's Agricultural Research Service this summer
conducted the first field tests of the cotton plants developed by
Monsanto Co. of St. Louis, Mo.
   Test plants, called transgenic, were inserted with a gene from a
different organism, Bacillus thuringiensis, or Bt, a commercially
available natural bacterium.
   The gene enables Bt to make a protein toxic to many caterpillar
species. And the transgenic plants make a similar protein.
   Department scientists said the transgenic plants caused
caterpillars to have ``a fatal case of indigestion, often after
eating only a bite or two'' of the leaves or bolls.
   The engineered cotton plants still must undergo extensive
testing, but officials said the new technology could help reduce
the use of chemical pesticides, reducing production costs for
cotton farmers.

<HEAD>Psychological Report Says Rocky Flats Workers Hit Hard By Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN K. PAULSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employee morale at Rocky Flats nuclear
weapons plant has fallen because of the plant's chronic problems,
and now many workers have an indifferent attitude that jeopardizes
safety, a psychological report says.
   A Rocky Flats spokesman said plant officials disagreed with some
of the report's conclusions, but acknowledged that there has been
turmoil among the work force because of a large number of recently
hired employees.
   The report said continuing criticism from the media, community
groups and friends have made employees ``fearful of declaring that
they work here. Many have reported feeling embarrassed to mention
to people that they are employed at Rocky Flats.''
   The Aug. 30 report is from J.N. Thistel, administrator of the
employee assistance program, to F.J. Furman, director of the
plant's occupational health department. Thistel wrote that sweeping
changes have had an intense impact on employees and that the
problems are causing employees severe stress at home and on the
job.
   Sources at the plant provided copies of the report to The
Associated Press on condition they not be identified.
   Thistel said the problems have taken a toll on employees, and
interviews with the plant psychologist have ``skyrocketed from a
low of 22 face-to-face interviews for the month of March to a high
of 145 in August.''
   ``Particularly in the last three years, change at the plant has
been prolonged, arduous and capricious,'' Thistel warned.
   ``Consequently, employee morale has suffered because individuals
no longer know what is expected of them, why the changes are
occurring, and are unable to have the time to recuperate before
another crisis confronts them,'' he wrote.
   ``This eventually causes employees to simply wear out and go
into a survival mode by adopting an indifferent attitude,'' he
added.
   The report helps show that serious problems continue to plague
the Denver-area plant, which makes plutonium triggers for nuclear
weapons.
   A consulting firm, Cermak Fletcher Associates Inc. of
Gaithersburg, Md., has done a study for EG&amp;G Inc., the plant
contractor, citing serious management problems at the plant during
the last five months.
   That report, released Monday by plant officials, said EG&amp;G
relied too heavily on the U.S. Department of Energy to identify
problems at the plant. It also said upper management failed to
develop a comprehensive plan for restarting the plant.
   Operations at the plant have been suspended since November 1989
because of safety and environmental concerns.
   In June 1989, FBI and Environmental Protection Agency
investigators raided the plant, looking for evidence of improper
disposal of hazardous wastes. A federal grand jury was convened in
August 1989 to investigate, but has not issued any indictments.
   Thistel acknowledges that workers' attitudes pose potential
safety problems. He said employees are getting mixed messages to
restore the plant to safe operating conditions and to complete work
quickly so the plant can resume operations.
   ``This has been reported to have placed many supervisors at odds
with employees, with the supervisors pushing workers to meet
deadlines and the workers complaining that they are being asked to
perform operations that aren't safe,'' Thistel wrote.
   Francis Allhoff, assistant general manager for administration
and planning, said EG&amp;G's top management disagreed with some of
Thistel's conclusions, especially that workers are being pushed to
resume operations at the cost of safety.
   ``Any push we have has to do with safety improvements, not
towards resumption,'' he said.
   But he said management is having a problem conveying that idea
to workers.
   The report said staff members are suffering from burnout because
of overuse and underuse of personnel.
   ``While on one hand we have people working massive amounts of
overtime, many without adequate compensation, on the other, we have
highly qualified people that have nothing to do. The latter is
closely akin to a prison environment, where individuals are
punished by sensory deprivation,'' he wrote.
   Allhoff acknowledged that there were some delays in getting
workers to their assigned jobs because it could take up to a year
for new employees to get security clearances. He said more than
1,100 employees have been hired during the past year.
   He said other jobs are being found for people to do in the
meantime, and any delays in putting them to work are temporary.

<HEAD>Caretaker Government Attempts to Stem Sympathy Wave</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHARON HERBAUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army-backed caretaker government
made a last-ditch attempt Tuesday to stem the sympathy wave that
many feel puts Benazir Bhutto within striking distance of returning
to power.
   As the ballot boxes were being readied, the caretaker government
filed a seventh corruption charge against the 37-year-old former
prime minister before a special one-judge tribunal in the eastern
city of Lahore.
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan used his constitutional powers on
Aug. 6 to oust Ms. Bhutto and install a hand-picked caretaker
government comprised of her most outspoken critics.
   The latest charge alleges Ms. Bhutto abused her power by making
illegal appointments in some 10,000 government jobs. A hearing was
set for Nov. 5.
   Later Tuesday, the president issued a blistering speech on
nationwide TV and radio in which he recounted the charges against
Ms. Bhutto and her former administration.
   He urged the estimated 50 million eligible voters not re-elect
her party when they vote Wednesday.
   ``You need not fear anyone but God Almighty for his fear alone
will give you courage to make the right decision,'' said the
73-year-old bureaucrat and stalwart of Pakistan's last military
dictator, Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq.
   Ishaq Khan was once considered the standardbearer of Pakistan's
infant democracy. But that image has been largely tarnished by the
special tribunals set up to try Ms. Bhutto and her government.
   More than 100,000 soldiers in full combat gear fanned out across
the country Tuesday to prevent what many have predicted will be
Pakistan's most violent election.
   At stake in Wednesday's poll are 217 seats in the National
Assembly, the law-making lower house of Parliament that will choose
Pakistan's next prime minister. Polls open at 8:00 a.m. local time
(11 p.m. EDT) and close at 5:00 p.m. (8:00 a.m. EDT)
   Ms. Bhutto's populist Pakistan People's Party and three smaller
allied parties are pitted against the Islamic Democratic Alliance,
a loose-knit coalition of 18 parties with little in common but
contempt for Ms. Bhutto.
   Most analysts say the election is too close to call, but her
opponents insist the People's Party will win no more than 75 seats,
far from an outright majority.
   Despite a host of economic and social problems, Wednesday's poll
is seen as a referendum on the dismissal of Ms. Bhutto's popularly
elected government after only 20 months in power, and on the future
course of a democracy struggling to emerge for the past 43 years.
   Even before the first votes were cast, Ms. Bhutto's loyalists
were accusing the caretaker government of cheating. They said the
tactics included moving polling stations, impounding vehicles
designated to take Ms. Bhutto's ssupporters to vote and buying
identity cards from the poor, her support base.
   ``The allegations being made are not unique,'' said Ken Wollack,
executive vice president of the Washington-based National
Democratic Institute. The group sent 40 international poll watchers
from 18 countries to monitor the election.
   Their assessment could determine whether Pakistan continues to
receive hundreds of millions of dollars in crucial economic and
military assistance. Nawaz Sharif, Ms. Bhutto's chief nemesis and
leader of the Islamic Democratic Alliance, dismissed the
allegations.
   ``She's trying to project the idea of rigged elections because
she is preparing the ground for defeat,'' said Sharif, considered
the leading contender for prime minister if the alliance forms the
next government.
   When Ishaq Khan fired Ms. Bhutto, he alleged her largely
inexperienced government had plundered the national treasury and
used government funds to buy political favors.
   He said it had handed out government jobs to friends and their
families and failed to curb lawlessness and ethnic violence in Ms.
Bhutto's home province of Sindh.
   Ms. Bhutto has insisted her government was clean and competent.
   In an effort to politically destroy Ms. Bhutto, the caretaker
government dragged her and a half-dozen former Cabinet ministers
before special tribunals dismissed across the board as ``kangaroo
courts.''
   But instead of discrediting her left-leaning party, the
caretaker government only helped unify the leadership and
rank-and-file, and halt Ms. Bhutto's declining popularity.
   The caretaker government then arrested her flamboyant and
controversial husband, Asif Ali Zardari, a 38-year-old Karachi
businessman blamed for much of Ms. Bhutto's troubles.
   Zardari was arrested Oct. 10 and held without bail in the April
kidnapping of a Pakistani-born British citizen and extortion of
$800,000.
   Zardari has used his arrest as a badge of honor and portrayed
himself in newspaper advertisements as a martyr for democracy. He
also is a candidate for two seats in Parliament.

<HEAD>House Approves More Money for S&amp;L Probe, Drug War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House voted Tuesday to spend $19.3 billion
this fiscal year to operate the Commerce, Justice and State
departments, including more money for savings and loan prosecutions
and the drug war.
   The legislation, approved 377-40, contains provisions agreed to
in negotiations with the Senate to comply with deficit-reduction
requirements and to compromise differences between the two
chambers' versions of the bill.
   Before sending the measure to the Senate, however, the House
discarded Senate language, accepted by House negotiators, that
would have required the U.S. trade representative to wait five
years after leaving the government before accepting a private
sector job representing a foreign country.
   Opponents of that provision said it was inappropriate in an
appropriations bill.
   The total spending in the bill is $529 million less than the
amount appropriated for the three departments last year and $681
million less than requested by President Bush.
   The bill calls for $8.5 billion for the Justice Department,
including $105 million in various divisions for savings and loan
investigations.
   Money specifically for activities related to S&amp;L crimes
includes:
   -$47 million in the FBI budget.
   -$45 million in the budget for U.S. attorneys.
   -$6 million in the budget for the Justice Department's criminal
division.
   -$5 million in the budget for the civil division.
   -$3 million in the budget for the tax division.
   The bill appropriates $694 million for the Drug Enforcement
Administration, $146 million more than last year but $6 million
less than requested by the president.
   It also earmarks $328 million for interagency law enforcement
efforts against organized drug crime, an increase of $113 million
over last year but $2 million less than requested by Bush.
   Japanese-Americans who were put in prison camps in the United
States during World War II would get $500 million. Nearly 50 years
after the internment, Congress voted last year to make the
payments.
   The State Department section of the bill includes $788 million
to cover overdue U.S. payments for membership in the United Nations
and its affiliate international organizations.
   The appropriation reflects Bush's plan to bring the United
States up to date in dues payments in recognition of the United
Nations' work in gathering international support for action against
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait.
   The United States is five years behind in payments. The
appropriation in the bill covers full 1991 membership in the
organizations and 20 percent of the back payments.
   Another provision in the bill prohibits export licenses to ship
supercomputers to any country helping Iraq improve its warfare
capabilities or whose nationals are helping Iraq improve its
military operations.

   A multinational group of doctors hoping to prevent
a war in the Middle East wants to sail a hospital ship into the
region to provide free medical care, a spokesman said Tuesday.
   ``We're writing to world leaders in hopes that the ancient
responsibility we have as physicians to prevent war could be
realized,'' said Edward G. Toomey, an internist at Emerson Hospital
in Concord, Mass. ``We're just hoping that something will come of
it.''
   The Baltimore-based physician's group, Life International, has
also planned a meeting in Geneva on Nov. 2 to show solidarity
against a possible war in the Persian Gulf.
   The organization first had planned to use the former Navy ship,
the Sanctuary, as a roaming medical facility for Third World
nations, but Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 changed its
priorities.
   ``We plan to go to one place and stay long enough to make a
major difference in the way medical care is delivered and affect
the quality of life of people,'' said Bob Mead, Life
International's executive director. ``Ideally we'd like to have
(the ship) be in some place for a year and a half or two years and
do some medical training as well.''
   Two Navy hospital ships are already in the Persian Gulf, Toomey
said.
   The Sanctuary first sailed after World War II when it brought
American war prisoners home from Japan. It was also used in the
Korean and Vietnam wars.
   Life International tried for two decades to buy the ship and
finally succeeded in 1988 when Congress sold it for $10. It is now
being renovated in Baltimore Harbor by volunteers.
   About 150 doctors from Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia,
Turkey, India, Pakistan, Egypt, the Soviet Union, Great Britain and
the United States have said they would attend the Geneva meeting,
Toomey said.
   The group plans a resolution to urge President Bush, Iraqi
president Saddam Hussein and other players in the Persian Gulf
crisis to avoid war at all costs.

   A high school senior on Tuesday had a
chance to display her poise immediately after she was named the
1991 Tournament of Roses queen, when a member of her court fainted
in her arms.
   Cara Payton Rullman, 17, stumbled when her classmate fainted,
but she quickly regained her composure and stepped forward to
accept the crown and a bouquet of roses from 1990 Queen Yasmine
Delawari.
   ``I was really shocked. I did trip a little bit. I guess I'm
human,'' Rullman said after the ceremony.
   Rullman said the excitement of the announcement was too much for
Tisha Mei-Ling Kong, with whom she attends San Marino High School.
   Kong was quickly revived, said Julie Sakamoto, a tournament
spokeswoman.
   The queen and her six attendants were chosen from about 700
applicants, based on their public speaking ability, poise, academic
achievement and personality.
   Rullman is a varsity cheerleader and a member of National
Charity League. She said she plans to attend college and someday
work with children suffering from Down's syndrome.
   The queen and her court will make about 100 appearances to
promote the annual Tournament of Roses parade and Rose Bowl
football game, held on New Year's Day.
   Actor Bob Newhart will serve as the 1991 parade's grand marshal.

<HEAD>Iraq Claims Captive Iranian Ex-Oil Minister Committed Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq said Tuesday that a former oil
minister of Iran who was captured by Iraqi forces early in the
1980-88 Iran-Iraq war committed suicide two years later.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said its information came from an
``official source'' who was commenting on press reports that Iraq
was still holding former Cabinet member Mohammad Javad Tondguyan.
   INA, monitored in Nicosia, did not say exactly when or how he
died.
   The agency said President Turgut Ozal of Turkey, then prime
minister, sought to gain Tondguyan's release on March 22, 1986,
during a visit to Baghdad, and that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
told him Tondguyan had committed suicide.
   On Monday, Iran accused Iraq of holding Tondguyan in a ``secret
prison'' and demanded his immediate release.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said Iran had
``live and documented evidence'' Tondguyan was alive and that Iraq
should show good will by releasing him at once.
   Tondguyan was captured while on a tour of the fronts in October
1980, a month after the Iran-Iraq war broke out. A cease-fire ended
hostilities in August 1988.
   Saddam recently agreed to Iran's terms for a formal peace
settlement of their border dispute as he tried to break out of the
international isolation that followed his Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   Saddam subsequently withdrew his troops from sections of Iranian
territory occupied during the conflict. The two Persian Gulf
neighbors also have exchanged tens of thousands of prisoners of
war.
   The Iraqi agency said Iraq formally informed Iran of Tondguyan's
suicide through the International Committee of the Red Cross. It
said Iraq also handed over to Iran all papers related to the
investigation, a medical report and a death certificate in
accordance with provisions of the 1949 Geneva Convention.

<HEAD>Another Courtroom Victory Makes Dees Two for Two Against Racists</HEAD>

   Attorney Morris Dees is two for two in
multimillion-dollar court battles against racists, making him enemy
No. 1 of violent white supremacists in the United States.
   ``I'm sure, for the time being, anyway, that these guys see me
as the problem. They ought to be looking at themselves,'' Dees, 52,
said Tuesday.
   A state jury late Monday awarded $12.5 million to relatives of a
black man beaten to death by racist ``skinheads,'' giving Dees a
big victory over White Aryan Resistance leader Tom Metzger.
   Three years ago, Dees won a $7 million verdict against the
United Klans of America after two Klansmen from Mobile, Ala.,
killed a 19-year-old black man.
   ``I think this verdict is much more important than the one
against the United Klan for the lynching of Michael Donald, because
that Klan group was on the decline,'' said Dees, head of the
Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala.
   ``This is an ascending group. It's gaining membership, gaining
power, dealing with the young, aggressive, violent-prone segment of
society, the skinheads.''
   Dees said steps will be taken immediately to attach the assets
of Metzger, a 52-year-old television repairman from Fallbrook,
Calif.
   Defendants in the latest case included Metzger, his son John,
Kenneth Mieske and Kyle Brewster. Mieske and Brewster are Portland
skinheads who pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the death of
Mulugeta Seraw, 27, an Ethiopian man who was attacked with a
baseball bat in November 1988.
   The Portland jury agreed 11-1 that the Metzgers sent agents to
the city to organize skinheads and incite them to commit violence
against minorities.
   Metzger, who represented himself in court, contended that his
activities were protected by free speech provisions of the
Constitution.
   An attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, Michael
Simon, said his group had no problem with the verdict.
   ``In light of the findings that there was an intentional
incitement, which is not protected by the First Amendment, there is
no threat to First Amendment liberties by holding a defendant
liable for the consequence of his actions,'' Simon said.
   The Rev. Richard Butler, pastor of the Church of Jesus
Christ-Christian Aryan Nations in Hayden Lake, Idaho, said the
monetary verdict will help the white supremacist movement by
serving as a wake-up call.
   ``I think it's terrible,'' he said. ``It's theft. It's actually
the theft of his property, the theft of his business and everything
else. They're going to steal all the property they can of every
white man.''
   Metzger said after the verdict he was prepared to do whatever
was necessary for the white racist cause.
   ``My wife and I made a pact in 1971, when we went against the
Vietnam War and quit paying taxes, that if we had to leave our home
in Fallbrook, California, with only the clothes on our back, so be
it,'' Metzger said.
   The judgment assessed Metzger $5 million, the White Aryan
Resistance $3 million, John Metzger $1 million and Mieske and
Brewster $500,000 apiece. Jurors also awarded $2 million in
non-economic damages and $500,000 for loss of income, to be divided
equally among the five defendants.
   Elden Rosenthal, a Portland attorney who had Jewish relatives
die in German concentration camps, helped represent the Seraw
family. He praised the work of Ancer Haggerty, the black Multnomah
County circuit judge who presided over the civil trial.
   ``He called this right down the middle,'' Rosenthal said. ``He
did not let his personal biases influence the way he handled
himself in this courtroom.''
   Dees, who has an autobiography, ``A Season For Justice,'' coming
out in April, said he has no other big cases looming.
   But he doesn't think the country has heard the last from
Metzger.
   ``I don't think there's any question that Metzger has been
driven up against the wall,'' Dees said. ``I think he sincerely
believes the things that his paranoid mind tells him about how the
Aryan race is doomed to be consumed by the `mud people,' as he
calls them, and that he sees some Holy Grail purpose to stop this
from happening.
   ``If a man is willing to die for his race, what else would he be
willing to do for his race?''

<HEAD>Right-Wing Party Group Invited to Iraq to Discuss Hostages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK McDOWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Right-wing leader Jean-Marie Le Pen said Tuesday
his party has been invited to Iraq to discuss hostages and he would
personally accompany French citizens home if they are freed under a
plan by Saddam Hussein.
   The Iraqi National Assembly earlier Tuesday overwhelmingly
endorsed the Iraqi president's proposal to release all French
nationals held in Iraq and Kuwait.
   Le Pen, who has urged expulsion of Moslem immigrants in France,
has been highly critical of France's role in the multinational
force amassed following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. He began
private contacts with Baghdad to seek a peaceful solution to the
conflict.
   There have been no reports of when or if French hostages could
be released. About 330 French citizens are held in Iraq or Kuwait,
including 67 at strategic sites as a deterrent against military
attack, according to the French Foreign Ministry.
   Saddam made the proposal to free French hostages Monday ``in
appreciation to liberal French people's rejection'' of U.S.
policies toward Iraq, and in support of President Francois
Mitterrand's desire for a peaceful resolution to the gulf crisis,
the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
   A statement from Le Pen's National Front party indicated a
high-level party delegation would shortly leave for Iraq ``at the
invitation of Iraqi authorities.''
   ``A National Front delegation ... will occupy itself first of
all with the fate of the French who find themselves there as well
as the other Europeans,'' Le Pen told the French television network
La Cinq.
   But Le Pen said he will only go to Iraq if all the hostages are
freed.
   Iraqi's French Ambassador Abdul Razzak Rachid al-Hachimi refused
to confirm whether the delegation would take home hostages.
   ``We prefer and we hope that a French government official will
go to Baghdad to bring the French nationals back, that's for
sure,'' al-Hachimi said in a La Cinq interview.
   Hubert Vedrine, a spokesman for Mitterrand, declined comment on
the Iraqi decision. The Iraqi assembly endorsed Saddam's
hostage-release proposal in a 248-2 vote, Iraqi officials said.
   Earlier Tuesday, Premier Michel Rocard and some legislators held
a meeting dedicated to the French hostages.
   Bernard Stasi, a centrist member of the National Assembly,
quoted Rocard as saying the release would be ``a unilateral
decision taken by Iraq.''
   ``The taking of hostages is odious,'' the Foreign Ministry said
in a communique. ``Their release is no more than an atonement for
an unacceptable act. France cannot accept any sort of negotiation
on the subject.''
   But the ministry said France would take measures to repatriate
the hostages if they are freed.
   Saddam's proposal has been viewed as an attempt to split the
West's anti-Iraq alliance by creating the impression that France
was negotiating its own deal.
   France, with 13,000 troops deployed in the gulf region,
represents the second largest Western military force after the
United States.

<TEXT>
   On the anniversary of the East bloc's
bloodiest uprising, Hungary's leaders on Tuesday urged their
countrymen to fight fear of the future in the spirit of their
battle against Soviet tanks 34 years ago.
   Commemorations of the 1956 revolt were modest compared to last
year, when they were combined with other events marking Hungary's
transition to democracy.
   Economic worries and political disenchantment have spread since
then. Budapest wreath-laying ceremonies that attracted thousands
last year drww hundreds Tuesday.
   Speakers at a ceremonial meeting of Parliament drew parallels
between disenchantment now and that which followed crushing of the
uprising by Soviet armor.
   ``Today, when the country is living through difficult hours,
when Hungary is not only suffering from its legacy but new pains
and disappointments . . .. let us remember 1956,'' Prime Minister
Jozsef Antall told the assembly.
   He asked all parties to ``fight poverty and keep the germ of
apathy from contaminating our people.''
   Antall and other dignitaries later placed wreaths at the grave
site of revolutionary Premier Imre Nagy and associates executed
after the failed uprising.
   Vytautas Landsbergis, president of the independence-minded
Soviet republic of Lithuania and a guest of Hungarian Federation of
Political Prisoners, suggested Lithuanians emulate the 1956
struggle.
   He said it served as an example to his republic as it seeks to
break away from the Soviet Union.
   ``Fifty-six served as a very good example for our cause,'' he
told state radio. ``If we want to be free we have to do the same as
what you did in `56.''
   It was not clear what Landsbergis meant by the statement, which
was carried in voiced-over Hungarian translation on the radio.
   Lithuania's attempt to regain its independence has been almost
totally peaceful. In later comments, he emphasized that Lithuania
was using only nonviolent means.
   Daylong commemorative rallies were arranged, as well as a march
retracing the steps of the 200,000 demonstrators who gathered 34
years ago.
   The revolt began on Oct. 23, 1956, with student demonstrations
calling for greater democracy, a multiparty system and withdrawal
of Soviet troops. Protests grew into armed clashes with Hungarian
secret police and Soviet troops before Soviet tanks suppressed all
resistance 12 days later.
   Official figures put the dead at 5,000 to 6,000, with 12,000
wounded. Western estimates said up to 32,000 people died and
200,000 fled the country.
   Last year, their spirits lifted with the prospects of
approaching democracy, more than 100,000 people marked the uprising
with an emotional torchlight rally. Less than six months later
Hungarians elected a free government that pledged to replace the
Soviet-style centralized economy with a free market system.
   In the last two years most demands voiced by the 1956
demonstrators have been fulfilled, including withdrawal of all
Soviet troops, now in progress; free elections; freedom of
expression, and economic reforms.
   But spirits this year were dampened by worrisome economic
indicators that include a debt of more than $20 billion and
mounting unemployment.
   ``I work as an accountant, and I can tell you that my firm's
situation . . . is shaky, indeed almost hopeless,'' Karoly
Petrovics, a 27-year-old father of two, told a reporter.
   ``I just don't know how I am going to keep the family going next
year.'' Still, the anniversary evoked strong emotions from some
people.
   A ceremony outside the national radio building, the site of 1956
fighting, was briefly disrupted when about 20 men forced their way
into the lobby.
   They demanded removal of a black marble plaque set up by the
former Communist government in memory of secret police officers who
died defending the station against revolutionaries.
   The men withdrew after a cloth was placed over the plaque.

<TEXT>
   Amnesty International on Wednesday reported a
significant upsurge in the number of killings by army-supported
death squads this year in El Salvador.
   The London-based human rights group reported more people were
killed in the first seven months of 1990 than in all of last year.
Between January and early August, 45 people had reportedly been
killed by death squads. Forty were reportedly killed by death
squads in 1989, it said.
   Amnesty said killings, torture and ``disappearances'' have
continued despite a U.N. Agreement on Human Rights signed July 26
by the government of President Alfredo Cristiani and the guerrilla
group Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN).
   ``Bodies of victims have been found mutilated, some with their
faces completely destroyed and others with signs of having been
brutally tortured. Victims have been shot dead on the streets or in
their homes,'' the Amnesty report said.
   The Nobel Peace Prize-winning group detailed several killings,
including an agricultural cooperative member slain Aug. 1 at work,
and a union member who was taken from his home by two men in
civilian clothes July 23. His body was found the following day.
   Amnesty said its information on the death squad killings came
from former members of the security forces, among other sources.
   Amnesty said its sources and other information ``including
testimonies by former members of the military, suggests that those
responsible for these actions (death squad killings) are linked to
the armed forces.''
   It said four apparent death squad killings that occurred in the
days following the U.N. accord ``suggest that those responsible are
continuing to operate with the confidence that they will not be
punished.''
   Amnesty said Cristiani's government had acknowledged reforms
were needed and that the security forces sometimes committed
``excesses.'' But the government has denied involvement.
   ``However, the extent and nature of the abuses and the fact that
human rights violations have been committed with almost total
impunity under this and previous government has left little doubt
of official complicity,'' Amnesty said.
   The rights organization said it was also concerned about reports
of rights abuses linked to the FMLN.
   The report on El Salvador is based on findings by Amnesty
delegates who visited the country in April.
   The report contains 34 recommendations, including making full
investigations into violations; strengthening the office of the
Attorney General and ensuring its independence, and protection for
judges and witnesses involved in human rights cases.
   About 72,000 people have been killed in the 11-year-old civil
war between the government and the FMLN.
   The two sides began cease-fire talks in May and are scheduled to
meet Nov. 4 in Mexico.
   After the U.N. agreement, the government spoke out publicly
against torture and established rights training courses, Amnesty
said. The government revised detention guidelines and established a
24-hour office to provide information on detainees, the report
said.

<HEAD>Scottish Legislator Norman Buchan Dead at 67</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Norman Buchan, an outspoken Scottish legislator
and writer of folk songs, died after a long illness, his family
announced Tuesday. He was 67.
   Nature of his illness was not announced.
   Buchan represented the Scottish constituency of Paisley South
for the opposition Labor Party.
   Two byelections are now pending in Paisley, near Glasgow. Allen
Adams, 44, the Labor representative for Paisley North, died Sept.
5.
   Born in Helmsdale in northeastern Scotland on Oct. 27, 1922,
Buchan was educated at Glasgow University and served with the Royal
Tank Regiment in North Africa and Italy in World War II. After the
war he took up teaching.
   Buchan was first elected to Parliament in 1964. From 1967 to
1970 Buchan served in the Scottish Office, which runs Scotland's
affairs from Westminster. He was an agriculture minister for seven
months in 1974.
   Always on the left of the Labor Party, Buchan was a vociferous
member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, which favors
unilateral disarmament by Britain, and a staunch supporter of state
ownership of enterprise.
   Buchan was also one of Scotland's best-known folk songwriters
and edited a book of songs.
   He is survived by his wife Janey, a member of the European
Parliament, and their son.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

   Rain fell across the Atlantic states Tuesday, and thunderstorms
in the Carolinas caused flooding and spun off tornadoes.
   In South Carolina, strong wind and heavy rain forced the
evacuation of 20 families from a mobile home park, injured at least
five people and flooded some roads under several feet of water,
authorities said.
   North Carolina had at least two tornadoes and record amounts of
rain that swelled rivers to flood stage. The tornadoes caused no
injuries but one man was killed when his car went off a bridge that
was knocked out by a train derailed by flood-damaged track.
   Flooding also was reported at Dover, Pa., where Conewago Creek
was out of its banks, the National Weather Service said. Six roads
were closed by flooding in Carroll County, Md., and local flooding
was reported in Washington.
   In addition to the Atlantic states, rain and occasional
thunderstorms also spread over the upper Ohio Valley and the
northern and central Appalachians.
   Light rain was scattered across south-central Iowa, northwest
Missouri, southeast Nebraska and northeast Kansas.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT was 1.78
inches at Cape Hatteras, N.C.; 1.30 inches at Williamsport, Pa.;
1.28 inches at Virginia Beach, Va.; and 1.24 inches at New Bern,

   Relatives of political prisoners briefly

transmission of a communique drawing attention to their plight.
   The three men and four women were unarmed and carried a
statement criticizing the civilian government for failing to free
all leftists imprisoned under the former military regime of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet.
   Oton Gutierrez, who heads the news agency's bureau in the
Chilean capital, said the group ``left the office peacefully after
talking to me and to police.''
   He said full text of the group's statement was not transmitted
by the Washington-based news agency, though a report on the
incident would move on the wire.
   The group initially insisted they would not leave the office
unless their communique was moved in full on UPI's international
wire and the agency's Chilean news service.
   After succeeding Pinochet last March, President Patricio Aylwin
pardoned a number of prisoners who had not committed violent
crimes.
   But he has refused to free those charged with violence or
terrorism, and is legally prohibited from pardoning suspects whose
trials are in progress.
   An estimated 260 prisoners jailed for political reasons remain
behind bars in Chile.

<HEAD>Albania Drafts Mild Reform of Election Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TIRANA, Albania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Albania published a draft election law
Tuesday that for the first time permits secret ballots and multiple
candidacies. But Albania, the lone defender of Stalinism in Europe,
would remain a one-party state.
   The Communist-controlled legislature will discuss the measure in
November.
   The draft allows several candidates to contest each of
Parliament's 250 seats and permits a broader range of official
organizations to propose candidates than in the past.
   Besides the ruling Albanian Labor Party (Communist Party), the
Communist-run Democratic Front, the youth organization and trade
unions also could field candidates.
   No date for elections has been set.
   The draft, which appeared on the front page Tuesday of the party
daily Zeri I Popullit, was publicly outlined Oct. 9. Its
publication seemed timed to coincide with the arrival of
journalists and diplomats for a meeting of Balkan foreign
ministers, the first such high-level international here in decades.
   Following East Europe's anti-Communist revolutions, Albania has
been taking steps this year to modify its hard-line Communist
system and has emerged from its self-imposed international
isolation.
   Coupled with a lack of freedom, Albania's 3 million citizens
endure the lowest living standards in Europe.
   Last July, discontent led an estimated 4,000 Albanians to
besiege embassies in Tirana before being allowed to emigrate.
   The public show of unrest was unprecedented, but President Ramiz
Alia has kept to his line of cautious reform, opening up the
economy for the first time to foreign investment and allowing some
Albanians to travel abroad.
   A legal expert who met with journalists Tuesday made clear,
however, that Albania's Communist hierarchy is not considering
following other East European leaders in abandoning one-party rule.
   ``There won't be any party pluralism,'' said Aleks Luarasi,
deputy dean of Tirana University's political science faculty.
   ``There will be pluralism of opinion. The people are free to
express their opinions in the mass organizations, in the party and
in other ways. But there won't be any party pluralism.''
   Luarasi said Parliament will appoint a committee to oversee
reform of the constitution, and that he expected further legal
changes.
   One such change will concern religious practice, outlawed under
Communist Albania's founder Enver Hoxha, who ruled from 1944 until
his death in 1985.
   Religious matter was dropped last May from a list of activities
deemed anti-state propaganda. Luarasi said Albanians now can gather
undisturbed at holy places. However, churches and mosques have not
been reopened.
   Traditionally, roughly 70 percent of Albanians were Moslems, 20
percent Orthodox and 10 percent Roman Catholic.
   Luarasi noted that laws guaranteeing free operation of religious
institutions in addition to freedom of belief probably would have
to be passed if Albania wants to realize its goal of joining the
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   Albania was the only European nation that did not sign the 1975
Helsinki Accord, also known as the Final Act, that launched the
Conference as a body stipulating and monitoring human rights in
Europe.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Tuesday invalidated a
Federal Communications Commission decision that allows American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. to discount long-distance packages for
large corporations.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here held that the FCC did not
fully examine whether the customized long-distance services AT&amp;T
offers its larger corporate clients violated the Communications
Act.
   The appellate court ordered the FCC to review its 1989 decision
on the so-called Tariff 12 services offered by AT&amp;T, whose
long-distance operations are subject to government regulation.
   AT&amp;T started offering the long-distance packages to companies
such as General Electric Co., Ford Motor Co. and DuPont in 1988.
   The service packages enable large companies to hire AT&amp;T to set
up an integrated long-distance network to transmit voice, data and
visual communications and manage the system.
   The tariffs filed with the FCC for each service contain the
specifications that AT&amp;T provided the customer during contract
negotiations.
   Several of AT&amp;T's long-distance competitors, including MCI
Telecommunications Inc., and US Sprint, argued that these tariffs
violated the Communications Act because they were so narrowly
tailored that the services were not generally available to all
potential customers.
   The three-judge appellate panel held that the FCC used
impermissible criteria in determining whether a package of services
offered to one large corporate customer was different from an
aggregate of the same long-distance options sold individually to
other customers.
   The FCC must also determine if there is a ``neutral, rational
basis'' for the price differences between the two sets of services,
the court said.
   The FCC's 1989 order ``gives us no confidence that this analysis
has yet been done,'' the court said in an opinion by Circuit Judge
Laurence Silberman that was joined by Judges Abner Mikva and Harry
Edwards.
   ``We have the impression that there is a certain air of
unreality about this case,'' Silberman wrote. ``The FCC (one way or
another) will undoubtedly permit AT&amp;T to compete effectively
against its competitors in the large user market if that is what is
really involved here.''
   ``But we are obliged to insist that it do so by turning square
corners of administrative law,'' Silberman wrote.
   MCI spokesman John Houser said the court's ruling put ``in legal
limbo'' Tariff 12 arrangements that the company contends are
``anti-competitive and unlawful.''
   But AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said the telecommunications giant
was ``confident that issues raised by the court's opinion can be
easily remedied by the FCC.''
   ``The decision today doesn't in any measure pull the plug on
customers that AT&amp;T is now servicing and we are confident that the
concerns raised by the court can be easily remedied by the
commission,'' Linnen said. ``We will continue to offer these

   King Fahd on Tuesday said Saddam
Hussein would not lose face if Iraq withdrew from Kuwait, and
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak expressed hope the Persian Gulf
crisis would end without bloodshed.
   The remarks, taken together with earlier comments by Defense
Minister Prince Sultan, appeared to be the most conciliatory
message to the Iraqi president since his troops invaded Kuwait on
Aug. 2.
   But Saudi Arabia also said Prince Sultan was misquoted and
denied it wants Kuwait to yield territory to Iraq to defuse the
crisis. Those reports helped push oil prices down more than $5 a
barrel Monday.
   The Saudis said again Tuesday that Saddam must withdraw his
troops from Kuwait unconditionally.
   ``I do not see that if a blunder were committed that we correct
the mistake with another mistake. The correct reply is to remedy
the mistake,'' Fahd told reporters in remarks distributed by the
official Saudi Press Agency.
   ``It would be nothing to cause anxiety or pain, but to the
contrary if President Saddam thought seriously about the matter he
would find that it is in the interest of Iraq, in his personal
interest, and in the interest of the Arab nation, that he pull out
from Kuwait.''
   Losing face is considered a major dishonor in Arab culture. Arab
conflicts traditionally are handed over to a mediator trusted by
both sides. If both sides accept his decision, face can be
preserved.
   Apart from early efforts by King Hussein of Jordan, no such
mediator has emerged so far.
   Mubarak visited Saudi Arabia to meet with some of his 14,000
troops deployed at the northeastern region of Hafr al-Batin and
told them their presence was meant to ``force him who lost his
reason to return to it.''
   He expressed Egypt's hope the crisis ``end without bloodshed or
war.''
   Mubarak then traveled to the United Arab Emirates to meet with
officials there and check on a 2,000-strong Egyptian force based
185 miles from Abu Dhabi, the Emirates' capital.
   Addressing his soldiers, Mubarak cautioned against a settlement
that does not provide for reinstating Kuwait's deposed Al-Sabah
family.
   Emirates President Sheik Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan, who
accompanied Mubarak, said he hoped the issue would be settled soon
``either by peace or by war.''
   Rejecting conciliatory statements, Zayed said the emir of
Kuwait, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, must be reinstated.
   ``Is it our duty to save an aggressor's face?'' Zayed said.
``No. He put himself in an awkward situation and he must get out of
it.''

   Emanuel Ungaro carried the day Tuesday with a
sumptuous festival of color in summer ready-to-wear.
   The show marked a triumph of all Ungaro stands for among his
fans: fabulous mixes of silk prints and leather - even patent
leather - clothes both tailored and feminine.
   As Ungaro has eased up on skintight silhouettes, the most
welcome innovation is in his new, flowing smock tops of silk in
beautiful shades like pink, yellow and raspberry, often over narrow
skirts.
   One could call his blouson dresses sacks. But whether one or two
piece, they flow gently around the body in a medley of flower
prints or solid, bright crepe de chines, sometimes sashed at a low
hip above a narrow hem.
   Add to this floaty new shirt-jackets, flounced babydoll and
trapeze dresses in airy fabrics, full-sleeved V-necked print or
silk crepe blouses cut like gypsy shirts.
   Even the fitted suits or dresses with easy jackets look softer.
The luscious pastel plaid jackets paired with flowered outfits
underneath are great fun, as are belted blouse and skirt outfits.
   Lame print dresses with low waists and flounced hems, flowered
shifts under multicolored striped blazers, flared evening dresses
with full tulle crinolines peeping underneath and sensational
fringed taffeta stoles complete the festive Ungaro line.
   The fashion words elsewhere were also easy and soft. Guy
Douvier's offering for Guy Laroche embodied wisdom itself.
   Like Ungaro, Douvier did a version of the blouson dress with
bold jacquard pastille dots, flowers or striped prints.
   The wearable classics included short and boxy coats or long
shirt-jackets, cashmere trench coats in navy or hot pink, and
double-breasted coat dresses in soft poplin wool.
   Some good bicolor poplin shirtwaist dresses with drawstrings at
hemlines or hips in shades like poppy and grey or khaki green were
typical of the casual dressing advocated at Laroche.
   Casual beachwear included bright ethnic prints, long white
wrapped skirts and plenty of shorts. One striking outfit was topped
by a large black-and-white diamond-printed silk twill shirt-jacket.
   Best in the dressier line here were a couple of sequined minis
topped by a draped bustier top and raw silk shirt-jacket in hot
shades of gold, fuchsia and rust or combinations of blue and green.
   Philip Wagon, the new English-born ready-to-wear designer for
Nina Ricci, showed a line sometimes so soft it almost went limp.
   There were plenty of long and floaty shirt jackets, slim pants
and shirtdresses, often in white or ivory fluid fabrics and pique.
Wagon also opted for his version of the flowery blouson look.
   It was all in good taste, from the bicolored navy-and-white
crepe dress cut to look like a white blouse with a dark apron to
the flounced crepe de chine, the sacks, tent dresses and shifts.
   A typical simple shift in deep turquoise had slightly puffy,
cuffed long sleeves, big buttoned-down patch pockets and was worn
with a flowing carnation red chiffon scarf.
   As a saddlemaker, Hermes trotted out a jockey line featuring
bicolored leather jackets looking like jockey silks over white
stretch riding pants. The wide rider's raincoat in off-white was a
handsome look, along with blazers and stretch jodphurs.
   The design team headed by Claude Brouet, a fashion specialist
and former editor of the magazine Marie-Claire, turned out some
dashing new silks, also a specialty of the famed saddlemaker.

<HEAD>Namibia Names as Army Boss Ex-Guerrilla Chief Accused of Torture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HEIDI VON EGIDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Namibia named as its army chief Tuesday
a former SWAPO guerrilla commander accused of torturing suspected
spies and dissidents.
   The Defense Forces announced in a one-line statement that Maj.
Gen. Solomon Dumeni Hawala was appointed army commander, effective
immediately.
   The position had been vacant since Namibia, formerly South-West
Africa, became independent on March 21.
   An opposition party, the Namibian Patriotic Front, condemned
Tuesday's appointment.
   Hawala was a fighter in the South-West Africa People's
Organization, or SWAPO, which waged a 23-year battle for
independence against South Africa.
   Hawala, commonly called Jesus Hawala, also has been called the
Butcher of Lubango, a town in southern Angola where SWAPO had a
camp during the war.
   People formerly held in SWAPO camps in Angola on suspicion of
being spies or dissidents have accused Hawala of supervising
widespread torture.
   The Namibian Society for Human Rights, a private group, accuses
SWAPO of failing to account for an estimated 1,500 people detained
during the war. A U.N. commmission of inquiry last year put the
figure at just over 300.
   SWAPO official Theo-Ben Gurirab, who became Namibian foreign
minister after independence, acknowledged in August 1989 that some
detainees were tortured, but said all were released.
   Under an independence plan, Namibia wrote a constitution and
held democratic elections last year that were won by SWAPO.
   SWAPO President Sam Nujoma became Namibia's first president.
   Namibia's infant democracy has been widely praised for its
fairness and moves toward reconciliation, but Hawala's appointment
could reopen old wounds.
   The SWAPO Youth League has demanded removal of opposition
members of Parliament it accuses of being puppets for South Africa.
   SWAPO party leader Moses Garoeb has attacked the Democratic
Turnhalle Alliance, the largest opposition party, as disrupting
national unity.

   Defense Minister Moshe Arens on Tuesday
barred Palestinians in the occupied territories from traveling to
Israel following a series of revenge attacks by Jews and Arabs.
   Under Arens' order, the 1.7 million Palestinian residents of the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip will be banned from entering
Israel beginning Wednesday morning, the military command said.
Those staying in Israel, where many work, were ordered to return
home.
   Israel television said the travel ban will remain in effect for
``several days'' until tensions are reduced.
   The army usually erects barriers on main roads leading to the
territories to enforce such orders.
   The last closure of the occupied areas in response to violence
was after the May 20 slaying of seven Arabs by a Jewish civilian
near Tel Aviv. The territories also have been blocked in recent
years during the Jewish Yom Kippur, or the Day of Atonement,
holiday.
   Arens' order was issued hours after Israeli civilians fired on
an Arab car in the southern Negev desert, killing one Palestinian
laborer and wounding his three cousins.
   Doctors at Nasser Hospital in the Gaza Strip town of Khan Yunis
identified the victim as Maher Al Shaher, 30. One of the ounded
was in serious condition with a gunshot to the back, they said.
   Palestinian reporters said the four were returning from work in
Israel when they came under fire from a red Jeep in the area of
Mivtahim, near Gaza.
   The army confirmed the Palestinians were apparently shot by
Jewish civilians and said the attack was being investigated.
   Earlier Tuesday, a West Bank Palestinian knifed two unarmed
women soldiers and another Arab bludgeoned two Israelis with a
hammer.
   The knife-wielding Arab was chased and captured by soldiers and
civilians, police said. There were reports he was beaten, and
hospital officials said he was in critical condition with head
injuries.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said the recent wave of attacks on
Israelis, which began Sunday with three stabbing deaths in
Jerusalem, resulted from ``unusual hysterical incitement'' of
Arabs.
   Tension has risen since Oct. 8, when police fired on
stone-throwing Palestinians at Jerusalem's hallowed Temple Mount,
killing at least 19 Arabs.
   Clandestine leaflets have urged Arabs to step up attacks on
Jews, and the violence since Sunday's killings raised fears that
the 34-month Palestinian uprising may be entering a more dangerous
phase.
   A leaflet distributed Tuesday by Hamas, a Moslem fundamentalist
group, praised as a ``hero'' the Palestinian laborer who killed an
unarmed woman soldier, a gardener and an off-duty policeman Sunday
in Jerusalem.
   It said the laborer had killed ``three enemy soldiers'' and
added: ``This is only the beginning.''
   The daily Yedioth Ahronoth reported a rush by Israelis on gun
shops, and reporters pressed Shamir to say what his government was
doing to protect the public.
   Shamir said security was being increased ``in all parts of the
country,'' but he insisted the violence would die down in a matter
of days.
   Tuesday's trouble began at about 9:30 a.m. when an Arab shouting
``Allahu Akbar!'' (God is great) stabbed two women soldiers
hitchhiking near Kiryat Tivon in northern Israel.
   Naama Yekutiel, a youth instructor, was in serious condition
with a punctured lung, said Dr. Albert Suttinger, deputy director
of Rambam Hospital in Haifa.
   The other, Cpl. Limor Ben-Shaul, suffered a superficial back
wound, Suttinger said.
   Radio reports said several citizens helped capture the
assailant.
   ``We chased him and then he threw down the knife and we grabbed
him,'' civilian Eli Koman told Israel radio. ``We held him down and
shouted at the soldiers to shoot and kill him. They wouldn't. I
asked one of them to give me his rifle. He refused.''
   An unidentified civilian speaking on Israel television said he
participated in a beating of the alleged attacker.
   ``He shouted `Ai, ai!' and we began beating him. We kicked him.
We tried to beat him as hard as possible,'' said the man.
   Off-duty bus driver Albert Ben-Ezra told army radio that he
pursued the assailant and exchanged punches with him.
   ``I saw him throw the knife and then I grabbed him. Then I heard
shots fired in the air, and the soldiers came and helped me,'' said
the bus driver, who added that he has two daughters in the army.
   The suspect was identified as a 39-year-old Palestinian from the
West bank town of Jenin, where a 14-year-old boy was killed and
eight other people injured in a clash with soldiers Monday.
   He was taken to Afula Hospital in central Israel, and then to
Rambam, where Suttinger said he was in critical condition.
   Later Tuesday, in the southern coastal city of Ashkelon, an Arab
wielding an 11-pound hammer battered two Israelis in their 40s as
they worked in a machine shop, police said.
   Both were hospitalized, and details of their conition were not
immediately available. The 23-year-old Arab, who worked at the
shop, was arrested, police said. They said he claimed to be
avenging a friend who was killed in Gaza.
   The attacks came as police blocked Arabs from the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip from entering Jerusalem for a second day in an
effort to prevent violence between Arabs and Jews.
   Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek said tension in his city was
decreasing, but would not disappear ``until negotiations begin on
peace. ... When no progress is seen, or any small light at the end
of the tunnel, there is despair.''
   Also Tuesday, two Palestinian men were found dead in the Gaza
Strip town of Rafah after being shot by fellow Arabs for allegedly
collaborating with Israel, Arab reports said.
   Police were investigating the deaths.
   Internal feuding has killed 286 Palestinians since the uprising
began in December 1987. Most were accused of collaboration.
   At least 763 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
or civilians, and 51 Israelis have died in the violence.

   Humphrey the wandering whale, freed from
one spot in the mudflats of San Francisco Bay, spent most of
Tuesday stuck in another spot before he began wandering again.
   Five years after the 40-foot humpback's much publicized voyage
through the bay to the Sacramento River, he drew a crowd of
thousands to a cove near Candlestick Park, where he lay beached by
rocks bearing a ``No Trespassing'' sign.
   A team of marine biologists, veterinarians and the Coast Guard
nudged the 45-ton whale with their hands, splashed him with buckets
of water, towed him with a harness and used an air compressor to
suck mud from below him.
   ``Essentially we were trying to tease him off that mud rock,''
Frank Griffith of the California Marine Mammal Center said during
the effort. ``There's no amount of human beings that you could put
out there to push him off like you'd push a car down the street. If
he's stuck on the bottom by mud suction, you couldn't move him
unless he puts some effort into moving himself.''
   As afternoon high tide rolled in, Humphrey budged a bit from the
mud at 2:20 p.m., flipping his fins, raising his tail and blowing
water through his spout. The crowd cheered.
   A short while later, Humphrey got stuck again, but with more
work he freed himself and swam out into the bay while volunteers
banged pipes to direct him away from land.
   Once Humphrey reached deep water a quarter to a half mile away,
rescuers hoped to used recorded whale sounds to lure him out under
the Golden Gate Bridge to the ocean where he belongs.
   ``I think the guy likes attention. I think he likes people,''
said Frank Boyd of San Francisco, who was in the crowd watching
Humphrey.
   Humphrey became something of an aquatic celebrity in the fall of
1985, when he spent 25 days swimming in San Francisco Bay and the
Sacramento River Delta before being guided and cajoled back to the
Pacific.
   His legions of fans heralded him with songs, poems, books and,
of course, a T-shirt. The state and federal governments spent
$50,000 on the effort to coax him out to sea.
   Biologists recognize Humphrey through tail markings with a
unique pattern, like a fingerprint. They've spotted him in the
ocean near San Francisco every year since in August or September.
   Nearly 200 children from five grades in the nearby Bret Harte
Elementary School walked out to the edge of the bay Tuesday to
watch Humphrey.
   ``We are studying about whales,'' said Mrs. Swaraj Gujral, a
fifth-grade teacher. ``The children are very worried. They wonder
how he can survive. They said we should all get together and push
him. I think he likes it here. He went away but he left his heart
in San Francisco.''
   Efforts to move him using boards and a tow rope during the early
morning high tide failed. For most of the day, Humphrey's
white-striped dorsal hump poked only about three feet above the
surface while his head and tail remained under water.
   ``The fact is the animal didn't help us at all,'' said Denize
Springer, spokeswoman for the Marine Mammal Center. ``In 1985 when
he was stuck, then he helped us.''
   Humphrey beached himself twice Monday - the first time
blundering onto mud flats near Candlestick Park, snarling traffic
for hours as commuters slowed to gawk. The mammal finally floated
off on a rising tide but then worked himself into a real jam when
he became stranded again north of the stadium.
   He was completely out of the water as the tide went out Monday
night and again after sunrise. Volunteers from the Marine Mammal
Center then worked to keep him from becoming dehydrated.
   Another fear, Springer said, was that the whale's weight would
crush vital organs.
   ``He's literally lying on his lungs,'' she said.
   Springer said a blood test taken Monday and completed early this
morning showed nothing abnormal about Humphrey's condition ``other
than he has been under stress and hadn't eaten.''
   Although humpback whales aren't known to attack humans, the
volunteers trying to help the stranded mammal face the danger of
being hit by the whale's strong fluke, or tail, which could cause
serious injury or death.
   Those keeping watch included Sharnel Jackson, 14, who recalled
the whale's first visit.
   ``We had a big banner in class with Humphrey's name on it,'' she
said as she lifted the collar of her jacket to ward off the cold.
``I know Humphrey. I want to see him get free.''

<HEAD>Police Shoot to Death First Cousin of Drug Cartel Leader</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police on Tuesday shot to death the
first cousin of cocaine baron Pablo Escobar.
   A police report said the cousin was Luis Gaviria, also a drug
trafficker. He was the second close relative of Escobar's to be
fatally shot by police in three months.
   Authorities did not reveal Gaviria's role with the cartel.
   Police said Gaviria died in an armed confrontation with security
forces in a suburb of Medellin, Colombia's second largest city and
home base to the cartel.
   In August, police killed Gustavo de Jesus Gaviria, another
Escobar cousin. That cousin reportedly had taken over the cartel's
daily operations since Escobar was forced into hiding because of a
government crackdown.
   Officials blame the Medellin gang for killing about 550
Colombians in attacks since August 1989, when the government and
drug traffickers declared war on each other.
   Meanwhile, the cartel's second in command said in a letter
published Tuesday that he is willing to help gain the release of
seven journalists recently kidnapped by drug traffickers if the
government grants him the right to move about the country.
   In the last two months, officials say the Medellin cartel has
abducted seven journalists, including Diana Turbay, the daughter of
a former president, and Francisco Santos, news editor of Colombia's
leading newspaper, El Tiempo.
   Also kidnapped is Marina Montoya, sister of Colombia's
ambassador to Canada, German Montoya. Montoya's son was kidnapped
by the cartel earlier this year but was freed after church leaders
appealed for his release.
   Jorge Luis Ochoa's letter was a response to an appeal by Ramiro
Andrade, former Colombian ambassador to Spain. Andrade, who helped
Ochoa avoid extradition from Spain to the United States in 1986,
asked Ochoa to mediate in the kidnapping crisis.
   Observers say the cartel abducted the journalists to pressure
the government to grant drug traffickers a pardon.

   A Warsaw Pact summit scheduled for
November to plan the future of the disintegrating Soviet-led
military alliance has been postponed, according to reports Tuesday.
   A Hungarian diplomat said the three-day meeting, scheduled to
begin Nov. 3 ``will likely be held later this year,'' but that no
firm date had been set.
   Hungarian radio also reported the meeting would be held later.
In Moscow, the Foreign Ministry said it had no information on a
postponement.
   The Hungarian diplomat suggested the meeting had been moved back
to await the results of a Nov. 19 summit in Paris of heads of state
of the 34 nations participating in the European security process.
   At that summit, a key East-West arms reduction agreement on the
reduction of conventional forces in Europe is to be signed by the
leaders of the 16 NATO and six Warsaw Pact nations.
   Negotiators in Vienna from the 22 nations participating in the
conventional arms talks are under pressure to finalize the
agreement before the Paris summit. Washington has repeatedly said
President Bush would not go to Paris if the treaty were not ready.
   A main barrier in Vienna is disagreeent on how many tanks and
other weapons each East European pact member may maintain within
overall East-West ceiling already agreed on.
   Pact experts are to hold a fourth meeting in Prague,
Czechoslovakia, this weekend to try and solve the deadlock.

   The government presented a Parliament
reform bill Tuesday that makes it easier for parties to achieve a
majority of seats but presents obstacles for small political
groups.
   Under the proposal, parties must secure at least 3 percent of
the vote in national elections to be represented in 300-member
single-chamber Parliament. Advocates say the minimum requirement
would force small groups to unite under one banner.
   The plan would also reduce the requirement to form a government
to 43 percent of the vote. Presently, a party needs at least 47
percent for a majority.
   The proposal, presented to Parliament on Tuesday, is expected to
be hotly debated before it comes up for a vote Nov. 8.
   The present proportional representation law was adopted prior to
the June 1989 general elections by the then-ruling Panhellenic
Socialist Movement.
   Greeks have gone to the polls three times the past 16 months for
national elections after parties failed to achieve the 47 percent
majority.
   In April, the conservative New Democracy party won 46.88 percent
of the vote, but it gained a one-seat majority after it was joined
by a deputy from a small conservative party.

   IRA gunmen ambushed a taxi
driver Tuesday outside a hospital in Belfast, fatally shooting him
before escaping into the traffic of a busy road, police said.
   The victim, William Aiken, 33, of Templepatrick, had just
dropped off a passenger at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick
Children.
   He underwent emergency surgery for head wounds suffered when he
was shot at point-blank range but died a short time later,
according to a hospital spokesman who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Witnesses gave police descriptions of the gunmen, who fled from
the hospital grounds to an adjacent road.
   The shooting took place in a fiercely republican area of
Belfast. The victim worked for a taxi company based in the
Protestant part of the city, police said.
   The slaying was claimed by the mainly Catholic Irish Republican
Army, which is fighting to end British rule in the mainly
Protestant province and unite it with the overwhelmingly Catholic
Irish Republic.
   The taxi driver was the fifth person to die the past eight days
as a result of sectarian strife in Northern Ireland.

   Retired store clerk Milburn
McKenzie passed an extraordinary anniversary this month.
   The 65-year-old from Miniota, Manitoba, received a life-saving
kidney transplant 25 years ago. According to an international
transplant registry at the University of California, that makes
McKenzie the longest living single-kidney transplant recipient in
the world.
   ``I think I have been very lucky,'' McKenzie said. ``But I never
celebrate (the anniversary) or anything. This year, I think I was
helping my son build his deck.''
   McKenzie received his transplant at Saskatoon's Royal University
Hospital in 1965, when the procedure was still in its infancy.
   McKenzie was born with a hereditary condition that caused tumors
to grow on the kidneys, ultimately destroying them. When he was 21,
one kidney was removed. Twenty years later, the other deteriorated
and also had to be taken out.
   He was on dialysis for about six weeks before a donor kidney
became available.

   Hooded Maoist Shining Path guerrillas shot to
death a Peruvian television reporter in a northern Andean city,
police said Tuesday.
   Police said three guerrillas wearing hoods shot and killed Pedro
Macedo Figueroa late Monday in the doorway of his home in Huaraz, a
city 175 miles north of Lima.
   Macedo, 53, was a reporter for the Lima television station
America Television.
   He was well-known in the Huaraz region for waging a campaign
against the guerrilla movement in local newspapers and on radio, a
local journalist said.
   Violence in the Huaraz region, an area popular with mountain
climbers and trekkers, has increased steadily since the Shining
Path killed a British tourist in the region in May 1989.
   More than 20,000 people have died in political violence since
the Shining Path took up arms in 1980. The majority of the victims
were civilians, according to human rights groups.

<HEAD>Poll Shows Hatfield Trailing in Oregon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Republican Sen. Mark Hatfield trails
Democratic challenger Harry Lonsdale in the latest poll on Oregon's
U.S. Senate race.
   Fifty percent of those surveyed said they favored Lonsdale and
44 percent backed Hatfield, according to the poll for KATU-TV in
Portland. Six percent were undecided.
   The poll surveyed 608 registered voters statewide Oct. 17
through Sunday and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4
percentage points.
   Hatfield, whose environmental record has been repeatedly
attacked, said he's ``depending on the common sense of the
people.''
   ``I think they'll find as they become acquainted with the
Lonsdale record that he is neither a friend of the working people
nor of the environment.''
   Dan Walters, a spokesman for Lonsdale, said the poll shows that
``Hatfield's negative campaign tactics have backfired.''
   Hatfield recently accused Lonsdale's company, Bend Research, of
dumping toxic chemicals into the ground at the plant site near
Bend. Lonsdale says the company has handled all chemicals properly
and the state has found no problems at the plant.

<HEAD>No Live Televising Of Florida Governor's Debate On One Station</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Miami's CBS affiliate reversed itself
Tuesday and agreed to show the only scheduled gubernatorial debate
live, but a station in the capital refused despite a plea from
Democrat Lawton Chiles.
   Polls have shown the contest a dead heat, giving added
importance to the candidates' face-to-face confrontation.
   WCIX-TV in Miami had initially said it was sticking with Dan
Rather's CBS Evening News at 7 p.m. on Oct. 30, while WCTV-TV in
Tallahassee opted for ``Wheel of Fortune'' and ``Jeopardy'' instead
of the debate between Chiles and Republican Gov. Bob Martinez.
   Both stations planned to show the hour-long debate on
tape-delay: Miami at 11:30 p.m., Tallahassee at midnight.
   The Miami station initially indicated it had too many
contractual obligations to create time for the debate, but Tuesday
afternoon announced it would show Chiles-Martinez after all.
   ``It is clear from viewer feedback we're getting today that
there is a heightened interest in seeing the debate live,'' said
Jerry Birdwell, director of broadcast operations at WCIX. ``We will
air the debate.'' The CBS Evening News will simply be shifted to
6:30 p.m. on Oct. 30, he said.
   But the Tallahassee station was sticking by its decision to
delay the debate and air the game shows instead, prompting an angry
complaint from Chiles in a telephone call to WCTV General Manager
Jim Caruthers.
   Chiles, in a tight race and with less money than Republican Gov.
Bob Martinez, has been pressing for more debates. The Martinez
campaign says one is enough.

<HEAD>Group issues Voter `Self-Defense' Manual</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A free telephone information service and a
voters' self-defense manual are two ways a non-partisan group is
trying to counter what it calls ``the issueless mudslinging'' of
modern political campaigns.
   Richard Kimball, board president of the Center for National
Independence in Politics, said members of Congress are ``the hired
help of our democracy'' and voters need factual information in
order to hire wisely.
   He said the center has come up with a few ways for voters ``to
break through the hype and glitz'' and get facts unvarnished by
campaigns or interest groups:
   -The Voter's Self-Defense Manual, ``practical suggestions and
unfiltered information'' about candidates in each state. It is
available in all 50 states by calling 1-900-820-CNIP (2647). The
call costs $3. The money covers the , a manual for
the caller and another one for a library or school in the state.
   -A National Political Awareness Test involving written and
telephone interviews with Senacost of the callte and House candidates.
Available in
19 states and scheduled to expand nationwide by 1992, the test
allows voters to compare their positions with those of the
candidates.
   -``1-800 Voter Information Service'' telephone lines, operating
this year in North Carolina and Nebraska. Kimball said thousands of
calls have come in and the service will be available to voters in
all 50 states by 1992.
   The toll-free lines provide information about the lives,
campaign contrthin three hours after a
terrorist incident.

<HEAD>Serbia Slaps Duties on Goods from Two Other Yugoslav Republics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUSAN STOJANOVIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist-ruled Serbia, largest of
the nation's six republics, all but abolished Yugoslavia's internal
common market Tuesday by imposing duties on goods from
reform-minded Slovenia and Croatia.
   Measures approved by Serbia's Parliament undermined the liberal
economic reforms of federal Prime Minister Ante Markovic and
appeared to push the troubled Balkan nation one step closer to
political disintegration.
   Prime Minister Stanko Radmilovic said his 15-point economic
program would protect Serbia's economy from ``disloyal domestic and
foreign competition'' and from Markovic's ``destructive policies.''
   It imposes duties on Serbia's foreign imports and on goods from
the western republics of Slovenia and Croatia, where center-right
governments replaced Communists after free elections this year.
   Radmilovic said Croatia and Slovenia, Yugoslavia's most
developed regions, could no longer ``count on free access to the
Serbian market.''
   Goods from the two republics are more expensive but generally of
higher quality than Serbian-made goods.
   Deputies passed seven points of the program Tuesday, including
the one imposing import tariffs. The other points will be voted on
later.
   No details were available on the size of the duties.
   Croatia and Slovenia seek greater independence by transforming
Yugoslavia into a loose confederation and applying for European
Community membership. They would keep the common Yugoslav market,
however, where most of their products are sold.
   Serbia remains Communist, with elections set for December. Its
government wants power to remain in Belgrade, the federal and
Serbian capital.
   Under Radmilovic's program, Serbia no longer will sell raw
materials and electricity at subsidized prices to Slovenia and
Croatia.
   Serbia also would ban or impose heavy taxes on many foreign
goods, to protect its own producers. Serbia has refused to
eliminate some key price controls and close down money-losing
enterprises.
   Serbian Parliament spokesman Ivan Cumic said Tuesday's vote was
``virtually unanimous,'' but refused to give specifics.
   Markovic, a Croatian technocrat, has opened Yugoslavia's borders
to cheap foreign goods, hoping to force home firms to lower their
prices and raise productivity to compete.
   Radmilovic slammed Markovic's privatization plans and
tight-money policies, saying they harmed Serbia's economy.
   He acknowledged some of his program conflicted with federal
laws, but said that was justified, to keep Serbia on par with
Slovenia and Croatia.
   Markovic, prime minister since March 1988, introduced reforms
last December that have throttled runaway inflation and pulled
Yugoslavia from the brink of bankruptcy.
   The reforms won praise from Western creditors, but side-effects
include a sharp drop in industrial production and closure of many
unprofitable firms. That threatens to push up unemployment, already
a hefty 19 percent.
   Initial optimism that Markovic's popularity could overcome the
growing political crisis evaporated in the face of continued
feuding between politicians and ethnic groups.

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors Tuesday portrayed Ramon
Salcido as a calculating killer who stepped over the bodies of his
mother-in-law and her daughters to find a bandage for a finger he
cut during a wine country rampage that left seven dead.
   In closing arguments, defense attorney Marteen Miller conceded
that Salcido killed the seven, including his wife and two children,
but claimed Salcido was crazed and incapable of planning the
murders.
   If convicted of first-degree murder, Salcido faces the death
penalty. The jury was scheduled to begin deliberations Wednesday.
The trial began Sept. 14.
   Salcido, 29, is being tried in San Mateo Superior Court for the
April 14, 1989, murder of his wife, Angela, two of his daughters,
his mother-in-law and her two daughters and a co-worker at the
Grand Cru winery. He also faces three counts of attempted murder
for attacks on a third daughter, another co-worker and the
co-worker's wife.
   Prosecutor Peter Bumerts disputed the defense contention that
anger and drugs sparked the rage and that Salcido was suicidal.
   ``Here is a man who wants to kill himself, stepping over dead
bodies to get to a bandage to bandage his finger... which he cut
while killing people,'' Bumerts said.
   Investigators say a trail of blood from Salcido's cut finger
indicated he stepped over the bodies of his mother-in-law, Marian
Richards, 47, and her daughters, Ruth, 12, and Marie, 8, after
fatally slashing them.
   Blood was found on a box of bandages in the Richards house and
Salcido was wearing a bandage on his finger when he was arrested in
his native Mexico four days after the slayings in Sonoma County,
the prosecution said.
   The trial was moved here because of extensive pre-trial media
coverage. Bumerts maintained Salcido was lucid when he earlier
killed his wife and slashed the throats of his daughters at a dump,
and said he then pondered killing more of his family.
   ``Before he even leaves the dump, he's thinking about his next
victims,'' Bumerts said. He produced a photo of the dump, saying,
``That is hell. That is not heaven.''
   The prosecution said that while being returned to California,
Salcido said in a taped statement that he was angry with his wife
because she had married him while pregnant with another man's
child. He said he was angry at his mother-in-law for not telling
him about the child's parentage and angry at his supervisor because
he thought the man tried to have him fired.
   Miller said Salcido showed up at the Richards home with no
intention of killing the woman and her two girls. ``He went there
with no idea in the world to do anything to those children,''
Miller said.
   Miller suggested that someone can be psychotic and kill in an
organized fashion. ``Someone can be crazy as a toad, negotiate
their way into a courtroom... wait for the judge and kill him,''
Miller said.
   He said Salcido was an atypical Mexican immigrant who did not
socialize much with other Mexicans, was ``at odds with himself''
and was overwhelmed by financial and legal problems.
   Jurors, he said, should put aside their fears of being called
``baby killers at cocktail parties'' and ignore what he described
as people whispering ``you should've sent him to the gas chamber.''
   Miller asked jurors to convict Salcido of less than first-degree
murder. Second-degree murder carries a basic penalty of 15 years to
life, while terms for manslaughter can range from two to 11 years.

<HEAD>Czech Leader Says Prague Spring Paid Off in the End</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Czechoslovak leader Alexander Dubcek
said his appearance Tuesday before the Swedish parliament proved
the 1968 ``Prague Spring'' revolt succeeded in the end.
   Although he was isolated and harassed for the next 21 years,
Dubcek said he believed Czechs were right to use passive resistance
against the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact tanks in 1968.
   ``They told us we'd lost, but we didn't lose. The proof is that
I now stand here,'' said Dubcek, now the country's assembly leader.
``We decided then not to use weapons. If we had resisted, maybe the
peace in all Europe would have been threatened.''
   Dubcek is one of only a handful of foreigners to address the
Riksdag, Sweden's parliament. The chamber was not full, but Dubcek
received two standing ovations from those who attended.
   After the speech, he flew to Norway, where he was to meet
Wednesday with the king and government leaders.
   In the speech and at a news conference, Dubcek said he favors a
strong federation in Czechoslovakia and believes the country's
ethnic problems can be resolved through democratic principles. ``It
will be hard work,'' he said.
   He also said the only way for Czechoslovakia to proceed with
development and economic reform was through a market system that
includes privatizing most of the state sector, and open the economy
to foreign investment and joint ventures.

<TEXT>
   A president who shows up at a fund-raiser
for a freshman congressman usually hears his praises sung in
accolades that would do justice to a canonization.
   But when Rep. Peter Smith brought on President Bush Tuesday as
the guest of honor after the $125-a-plate apple pancakes, the
lawmaker took pains to emphasize his ``specific disagreements''
with Bush on civil rights and deficit reduction.
   It may have been the most halfhearted introduction Bush has
heard in 21 months as president, and it dramatized the discomfort
many Republicans feel with the tax-raising, deficit-lowering deal
Bush hopes to nail down with the leaders of Congress.
   Something unusual also happened at Bush's next campaign stop in
Manchester, N.H., for another GOP congressman named Smith - Bo
Smith - who is running for the Senate.
   Bob Smith skipped his own fund-raising event, sending his wife
Mary Jo instead to introduce the president. She said her husband
stayed in Washington because of key votes pending in the House.
   Back in Washington, an aide said Smith prides himself on his
near-perfect attendance record and wanted to be on hand to support
the president in any attempt to override his controversial veto of
the civil rights bill. The aide asked not to be identified.
   Peter Smith is a former college president trying to hang onto
his seat against a tough challenge from independent Bernard
Sanders, the iconoclastic, socialist ex-mayor of Burlington.
   ``He is a man of independent mind. I wish he'd stop reminding me
that we do have a few differences out there,'' remarked Bush.
``But, hey, listen: nobody is going to do it exactly my way. ...
There are 435 of these people in the United States Congress.''
   Smith, unlike most Republicans, voted for the original,
controversial budget deal that Bush and the leaders struck last
month, then turned around and voted with the House Democrats on an
alternative raising taxes steeply on the rich. Sanders has skewered
him for both.
   ``My specific disagreements with this administration are a
matter of record - most recently on the civil rights bill, but
(also) some of the elements of our deficit reduction,'' said Smith.
   ``Let me just tell you, Mr. President, I think the people of
Vermont are ready and willing to support higher taxes on the
wealthy as an important part of any package to get this country out
of deficit,'' said Smith.
   Smith said Bush ``had run on and won on'' a pledge not to raise
taxes, but agreed to do it ``because he understood that the good of
this country had to come first.''
   Bush has seen his own personal popularity rating plummet amid
his turnaround on taxes and the budget stalemate of the past month.
With two weeks until election day, Republicans are worried that
Bush's problems could jeopardize their chances.
   On a rainy, dismal day, Bush also was campaigning in Waterbury,
Conn., for Gary Franks, a black Republican congressional candidate,
and in Stamford, Conn., for the party's gubernatorial candidate,
Rep. John Rowland.
   The fund-raiser for Franks was closed. At a $500 a plate dinner
for Rowland, Bush drew applause when he noted the Republican's
promise not to impose a state income tax on Connecticut residents.
   Although the president seemed put out by the lukewarm
introduction in Burlington, he praised Peter Smith as a congressman
who ``votes his conscience'' and ``puts the good of the country
first.''
   ``When he voted for the early compromise it wasn't an easy
vote,'' said Bush. ``He knew he was going to get sniped at from
people way on the right or way on the left. ... I, perhaps in a
different perspective, had to do exactly the same thing.''
   ``We're hanging tough for a good agreement,'' Bush assured the
crowd of 700 Vermont Republicans, some of whom paid up to $500 to
have their pictures taken with the president. The event was
expected to net $40,000 to $50,000 for Smith's campaign.
   ``The days of tax and spend and damn the deficit must come to an
end,'' declared Bush.
   He also made a spirited defense of his stand in the Persian Gulf
against Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.
   Seventy-five anti-war demonstrators stood in the rain outside
the conference hall in Burlington to decry Bush's policies with
banners reading ``Talks Not Troops'' and ``No War for Natural
Resources.''
   ``I saw some signs coming in here today: `no war for oil.' I can
understand the sentiment by some of those young people,'' he said.
   But he said the United Staes and its allies were standing up
for morality against Saddam Hussein, whom he likened to Hitler.
   ``The holding of hostages, innocent men and women .... goes
against the conscience of the entire world,'' said Bush. ``The
starving of embassies - good God! This is 1990. ... These are
crimes against humanity. There can never be compromise, any
compromise, with this kind of aggression.
   ``It isn't oil that we are concerned about, it is aggression and
this aggression is not going to stand,'' declared Bush.
   It was Peter Smith who led the crowd then in giving Bush a
standing ovation.

<HEAD>Third Party Ballot Challenge Makes For Election Confusion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES WEBB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Preparations for local elections were at a
standstill Tuesday after the U.S. Supreme Court intervened in a
third-party ballot dispute in the hotly contested gubernatorial
contest.
   At issue was whether the all-black slate of county candidates
from the Harold Washington Party, named for the city's first black
mayor, should be included on the ballot. Washington died in 1987.
   Justice John Paul Stevens on Monday halted further printing and
distribution of ballots in Cook County, saying the full Supreme
Court should hear the dispute. Most of the ballots already have
been printed, without the Washington Party candidates.
   The Supreme Court was expected to consider Stevens' action
Friday and possibly hear the Washington Party's challenge to an
Illinois Supreme Court ruling keeping its candidates off the
ballot.
   The Illinois Supreme Court ruled Oct. 12 that Washington Party
candidates weren't entitled to appear on the ballot because they
didn't have enough nominating petitions.
   The legal challenge was filed by five petitioners, who
Washington Party officials contend acted for the county Democratic
Party.
   It was not immediately clear if county or state elections would
be postponed if the high court rules in the Washington Party's
favor.
   City and county election officials said it would be nearly
impossible to retool election ballots and computers to include the
third party's slate of 19 county candidates within two weeks.
   Cook County Republican Party Chairman Richard Seibel, said ``the
urgency of the election is in question. (Voters) don't know if it's
going to be November 6 or December 6 at this point.''

<HEAD>Shamir: Soviet Immigrants Have Buried Jews' Demographic Fears</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Israel, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said
Tuesday the influx of Soviet Jews means Israel no longer needs to
fear being submerged by a growing Arab population.
   In a speech to Latin American immigrants, Shamir said the debate
in the Jewish state over the demographic issue, ``which was very
widespread and disturbed many people,'' had vanished in recent
months.
   ``Many among us took masochistic pleasure in playing with the
comparative numbers of Jews and Arabs, and searched the statistics
for the date on which the number of Arabs would equal and perhaps
exceed the number of Jews,'' he said.
   ``And wonder of wonders: lately this sport is disappearing. No
one will miss it.''
   ``In a few years we will not recognize the land of Israel.
Everything will have changed - society, the economy, the culture,''
he said.
   ``Our people will grow, it will fill our little country with
Jews, and thus the country will be bigger in content, human
strength, potential.''
   Speaking from a prepared text, Shamir was careful not to suggest
his government might violate its undertakings to friendly
governments and send the Soviet Jews to live in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   But Shamir boasted the Soviet influx had handed his nationalist
doctrine a victory over those who have argued that both for the
sake of peace and for demographic reasons, Israel should give up
the occupied territories with their 1.7 million Arab inhabitants.
   ``I remember the days, not long ago, when arguments such as
these were heard in public debate: `If I knew that the gates of
Russia would open and hundreds of thousands of Jews would come out,
I would think differently about the problem of the borders of the
land of Israel','' he said.
   ``And now the gates have opened and the immigration flows and
those voices and those arguments are no longer heard.''
   Israeli officials say they expect 1 million Soviet Jews to come
here by 1992. The country's population is 4.7 million, of whom 3.9
million are Jewish and 800,000 are Arab.
   Shamir added that the Soviet exodus used to be ``the most talked
about issue in the Arab political world.''
   Today, he said, ``You hardly hear any of them talk about it.
They have realized that they cannot persuade their great ally, the
Soviet Union, to shut the gates. Russia won't shut the gates, and
they (the Arabs) have accepted... that that is the way the world
goes.''
   Shamir said the Soviet Union was no longer the Arabs' major
military backer. ``We are grateful to the nations of the Soviet
Union and their leaders for this turning point,'' he said. ``We
won't forget it.''

   A propane tank exploded on the roof of the
main post office building south of downtown Tuesday, sparking a
blaze that prompted the evacuation of about 300 people, fire
officials said.
   No injuries were reported fire that began when the tank exploded
and tar being applied for a new roof burst into flames, said the
fire officials. The cause was under investigation.
   Some of the estimated 300 people who were inside the three-story
brick building when the blaze broke out were allowed back in later,
said post office spokesman Dave Failor.
   No delay or interruption in the mail delivery was expected, he
said.
   About 60 firefighters brought the blaze under control within a
half hour, said Assistant Fire Chief Denver Schmadeke. The fire was
confined to the roof.

<HEAD>Patient Dies After Blood Type Mix-Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hospital has appointed a committee to
investigate the death of a heart-transplant patient whose blood
type was listed incorrectly in a transplant matching computer.
   ``We aren't pointing a finger at anyone,'' Dr. Robert Emery,
director of heart transplantation for Abbot Northwestern Hospital
and the Minneapolis Heart Institute, said Monday.
   The 47-year-old patient, who had type O blood, received a heart
from a type A donor because his blood type was erroneously listed
as type A.
   He died when his body rejected the heart.
   The survival rate is more than 60 percent when hearts from type
A donors are transplanted into type O patients. That survival rate
jumps almost to 100 percent when hearts from type O donors are
transplanted into type O patients, Emery said.
   The patient, whose name was withheld, suffered from
cardiomyopathy - deterioration of the heart muscle - and from lung
and kidney problems.
   The blood-type mix-up was discovered shortly after the
transplant. Doctors controlled the mismatch with anti-rejection
drugs for about seven days before the patient's body rejected the
heart, Emery said.
   Abbott Northwestern officials rechecked the blood type
classifications for all patients on its transplant waiting list and
no other errors were found, Emery said.

<HEAD>BP Oil Fined $2.3 Million For Polluting Delaware River</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL STIEG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   BP Oil Corp. agreed Tuesday to pay $2.3
million for dumping waste from its Marcus Hook refinery into the
Delaware River, federal authorities said.
   The fine, part of a legal settlement, was the second largest the
government has ever assessed for water pollution, federal officials
said. U.S. Steel was fined $2.9 million in 1977 for pollution from
its plant in Gary, Ind.
   ``I think you'll see a trend toward increases in the size of
fines for water pollution'' predicted Cynthia Giles, an assistant
regional counsel for the Environmental Protection Agency.
   The government sued BP Oil under the Clean Water Act in 1986,
prompting the company to replace its wastewater treatment plant
with a new $25 million plant, which began operating last year.
   BP Oil's old plant was discharging excess oil and grease,
ammonia, solids, sulfides and various chemicals that reduced the
amount of oxygen in the water, changed its acidity and sickened and
killed fish, authorities said.
   The company violated its wastewater discharge permit 6,500 times
from 1979 until the present, said the EPA. All the charges
concerned the old plant.
   Discharges from the BP Oil plant were ``a major contributor to
the pollution problem in the river,'' the EPA said.
   The refinery is on the river about 2 miles north of the Delaware
state border. It produces gasoline, jet fuel, diesel oil and other
petroleum products.
   Joann Elser, BP Oil's human resources manager, said the new
plant was operating at 99.6 percent efficiency.
   ``We've been here a long time, we're firmly entrenched in the
community,'' she said. ``We're concerned about the quality of water
going into the river.''
   The settlement includes the $109,000 BP oil already has paid the
state of Pennsylvania to settle a separate suit by the Department
of Environmental Resources.

<TEXT>
   Young women are as safe from sexual assault
at the nation's only training center for female Navy recruits as
they are anywhere in society, the base commander said Tuesday.
   ``We have nothing to hide,'' Rear Admiral Louise C. Wilmot said
at a news conference. She was responding to news reports about 24
allegations of rape, sexual assault and fraternization at the Naval
Training Center in Orlando over the past 18 months.
   The sex crimes and fraternization problems at the base had been
previously reported, but Navy officials in Washington recently made
copies of internal investigative records available to reporters.
   The Navy's inspector general suggested that Navy investigators
of sex crimes are inadequately trained. He indicated that more
female investigators should be assigned to the Orlando training
center.
   The report said base officials had failed to seek appropriate
punishment for offenders.
   ``We just reject that out of hand ...,'' Wilmot said. ``There is
a lot of misinformation out about that (inspector general's)
report. We helped write that report.''
   Six rape cases never went to trial because of insufficient
evidence, Wilmot told reporters, but 13 cases of fraternization and
five of sexual assault were prosecuted and the offenders punished.
   The six reported rape cases aren't a large percentage in a
command where 15,000 women were trained during that time, the
admiral sad.
   ``We can assure young women and their parents that they have
nothing to fear'' at this base, she said.
   Three of the alleged rapes were reported on the base and three
outside, she said, ``and none involved instructors or officers.''
Each case was investigated but none was prosecuted, for lack of
sufficient evidence.
   The admiral said that in some cases there were problems with the
credibility of the witnesses, in others excessive alcohol was
involved, and ``we have had cases where people have made false
accusations of rape.''
   She personally reviewed all the decisions against bringing cases
to trial, and they were then reviewed by higher authorities in
Washington, ``and no one disagrees with us,'' the admiral said.
   In the wake of the report, the base is creating a centralized
computer list of all such allegations and crimes, expanding a
rape-awareness course for recruits, conducting seminars and
strengthening other counseling and assistance programs for women,
she said.
   The training center has seven major commands, each headed by a
captain.
   ``If anything, they're very protective about the female members
of their command,'' the admiral said. ``I stand for equal treatment
for men and women.''
   The Navy has strict fraternization rules, and the base prohibits
any social contact between training-company commanders, who are
usually noncommissioned officers, and female students. This applies
even when the recruits finish training and are transferred.
   Violators are subject to non-judicial punishment and are usually
fined, removed from their positions and transferred out of Orlando.
   With some 18,000 Navy and civilian employees, the training
center is the Orlando area's second largest employer, next to Walt
Disney World. It has an annual payroll of $300 million.

   Democratic congressional leaders said Tuesday
they will reserve the right to call lawmakers back into session if
needed for any emergency in the Persian Gulf.
   The leaders also are establishing a smaller group that will be
available to consult with President Bush on the Middle East as a
way of maintaining the role Congress claims in the exercise of war
powers.
   A joint statement by House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., and
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, noted that
``presidential consultation with Congress is required by law under
certain circumstances.
   ``We believe that regular consultation is necessary and useful,
particularly given recent developments in the Persian Gulf.''
   Normally, once Congress adjourns for the year it can be recalled
only by the president. But this year's adjournment resolution -
expected later this week - will provide that power to the top
Democrat in each chamber as well, in consultation with the House
and Senate Republican leaders.
   The smaller consultative group will include from the House,
Foley; Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.; Minority Leader
Robert Michel, R-Ill., Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., chairman of the
Foreign Affairs Committee and senior committee Republican William
Broomfield of Michigan; Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the
Armed Services Committee and top GOP member William Dickinson of
Alabama; and Intelligence Committee Chairman Anthony Beilenson,
D-Calif., and ranking Republican Henry Hyde of Illinois.
   From the Senate, the group will include Mitchell; Minority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.; Foreign Relations Chairman Claiborne Pell,
D-R.I., and ranking GOP member Jesse Helms of North Carolina; Armed
Services Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and John Warner, R-Va., the
ranking minority member; and Intelligence Chairman David Boren,
D-Okla., and senior GOP member William Cohen of Maine.
   The Constitution of the United States makes the president
commander-in-chief of the armed forces but in Article 1, Section 8
says: ``The Congress shall have power ... to declare war.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has testified to Congress
the administration would try to consult Congress on activity in the
Persian Gulf, but he refused to commit the administration to
consultation or to a request for a declaration of war.

<HEAD>Company Says it Doesn't Kill Cats, Disputes ABC Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURLINGTON, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture and
the Alamance district attorney are investigating animal cruelty
allegations involving a biological supply firm, officials said
Tuesday.
   ABC News reported Monday that Carolina Biological Supply Co. has
been killing nearly 200 cats a week with poison gas to be sold for
science education or research. The report said customers were told
that all of the cats had been killed at animal shelters.
   The investigations were prompted by complaints by People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals and began prior to the ABC report,
officials said.
   Cats have been killed at the company's gas chamber, but not by
Carolina Biological, company spokesman Ron Field said Tuesday.
   Licensed animal dealers were allowed to use Carolina
Biological's chamber to kill animals in the past, but Field said
that practice was recently halted.
   ``For a number of years the company has openly permitted
federally licensed animal collectors to use the company's
euthanasia chamber, understanding that the practice was approved by
the USDA. Animals were put to sleep by collectors and purchased by
the company only after the animals were sacrificed,'' Field said.
   District Attorney Steve Balog said his investigation should be
completed in a week or so.
   USDA Regional Animal Care Division Supervisor Joe Walker,
contacted at his office in Tampa, Fla., told the Burlington
Times-News that inspectors on his staff began an investigation of
Carolina Biological Supply Co. earlier this year.
   ``We won't have any comment on the investigation until it is
completed,'' Walker said.
   Carolina Biological is one of the world's largest suppliers of
animals for scientific research.
   ``Just recently the USDA said that if we wish to allow live cats
on our property in the future we would have to modify these
procedures,'' he added. ``Instead, we decided not to allow dealers
to use our facilities any longer and as a consequence now permit
only euthanized cats on its property.''
   Field said Carolina Biological Supply has never bought live
cats.
   ``The allegations made last night on ABC's World News Tonight
against Carolina Biological Supply Co. are unfair distortions of
the company's practices in dealing with animal specimens which have
been taken out of context to suggest cruel treatment of animals,''
Field said.
   The ABC report included videotape shot by People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals showing live cats being pushed into a gas
chamber and an unidentified former employee saying overcrowding in
the chambers sometimes meant some cats did not die immediately.

<HEAD>Church Tells General to Stop Roiling Guatemala's Political Waters</HEAD>

   A church leader on Tuesday urged former
dictator Jose Efrain Rios Montt, banned from running in the
presidential race, to retract accusations the government plans to
cheat in the Nov. 11 national elections.
   Otherwise, Archbishop Prospero Penados del Barrio warned at a
news conference, this could destabilize Guatemala and lead to a
military coup against outgoing President Vinicio Cerezo.
   Cerezo's government denied Rios Montt's allegations, as did a
representative for the military.
   ``In the name of peace ... I ask that Gen. Efrain Rios desist
from his attitude which is polarizing our people and causing
confrontation, and this can lead to destabilization and a coup,''
Penados said.
   Rios Montt has been resisting a constitutional provision barring
him as a candidate because he became president through a military
coup 7{ years ago.
   Speaking at a political rally last weekend in Chiquimula, 104
miles east of Guatemala City, Rios Montt accused Cerezo of planning
to fix the elections in favor Alfonso Cabrera Hidalgo, the
presidential nominee of Cerezo's centrist Christian Democrats.
   Rios Montt also urged his supporters to fight the ban by writing
in his name on ballots ``to show that it is you who want me in
power.'' By law, this would automatically invalidate the ballot,
and enough invalid ballots could scuttle the elections.
   ``This could cause confrontations, because his call for
resistance is not as passive as it seems,'' Penados said. ``He is
being pigheaded. He has run the legal course - from the Supreme
Electoral Tribunal, the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court
- with negative results for his aspirations.''
   A born-again Protestant, Rios Montt claims he was robbed of
victory when he ran for president on the Christian Democratic
ticket in 1974, with the election fixed to put conservative Gen.
Eugenio Kjell Laugerud in power.
   In March 1983, he headed a junta of three officers that
overthrew Laugerud's successor, President Fernando Romeo Lucas
Garcia, an elected army general. But three months later, he forced
out the other two generals and stayed on as president.
   While in power, Rios Montt built up his image as an
administrator who was equally tough on common criminals and leftist
guerrillas. He had more than a dozen suspected rebel leaders
summarily executed by firing squads, ignoring an appeal from Pope
John Paul II to spare their lives.
   Rios Montt was overthrown in 1983 by a military coup led by Gen.
Oscar Humberto Mejia Victores, who then had an elected convention
reform the constitution and called elections, which Cerezo won in
1984.
   Cerezo completes his five-year term Jan. 14, the first civilian
elected president in 17 years, in a country convulsed by a
three-decade-old leftist guerrilla insurrection. All the rest have
been military men.
   ``He (Rios Montt) has been dead politically since Aug. 8, 1983,
when I relieved him (of power) on the decision of the army high
command,'' Mejia Victores told reporters Tuesday.
   Rios Montt, who broke with the Christian Democrats, has been
trying to run at the head of a ticket by a three-party conservative
coalition. In public opinion polls, he was leading 12 other
candidates on a law-and-order platform that was appealing to
Guatemalans tired of a three-year crime wave.
   Presidential spokesman Carlos Anleu reiterated government
promises that the ``elections will be free and clean.''
   On Nov. 11, Guatemalans will also vote for a new legislature,
municipal authorities representatives to a Central American
parliament that will soon be formed by Guatemala, Honduras, Costa
Rica, El Salvador, and Nicaragua.
   If none of the candidates get a majority of half-plus one of the
votes cast for president, the two top contenders will go into a
runoff.

<HEAD>House Passes Fish Net Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House passed and sent to President Bush a
bill that would ban the use of large-scale drift nets in U.S.
waters up to 200 miles offshore and their use by American fishing
fleets anywhere in the world.
   On a voice vote, the House dropped its own version of the
legislation and agreed to adopt a bill approved earlier this month
by the Senate that also would require Bush to seek an international
ban on drift-net fishing.
   The nets, which can extend up to 40 miles around, have been
blamed for the deaths of thousands of dolphins, other sea mammals
and birds caught in their paths as they are dragged through the
water to trap commercial fish.
   The bill expands the 1976 Magnuson Fishery and Conservation Act
to include previously exempted tuna in government controls over
commercial and sport fishing within 200 miles of the U.S.
coastline.
   The legislation also requires the government to develop
standards that tuna canners would have to adopt in order to label
their product ``dolphin safe.''
   Some companies, according to lawmakers, have adopted the
``dolphin safe'' label in response to boycotts by environmentalists
even though they continue to purchase tuna known to have been
caught in nets responsible for dolphin deaths.

<HEAD>Afflicted Long Island Boy Gets Wish; Meets Bush in Connecticut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 8-year-old New York boy afflicted with
brain tumors got his wish Thursday: he finally met President Bush.
   Jimmy Kilanowski of Lake Ronkonkoma on New York's Long Island
was in the front row of the audience with his parents at a
Republican fundraiser where Bush was speaking.
   Bush had invited the family after reading news accounts that
Jimmy's hopes of meeting him had been frustrated by a bureacratic
snarl at the White House.
   After Bush's speech for Connecticut GOP gubernatorial candidate
John Rowland, Bush hugged the boy, who put his arms around the
president's neck and whispered something to him.
   When the president left, the boy turned to his parents and said,
``He still cares.''
   The White House invited the Kilanowski family to come to the
event because it was relatively close to their New York home.
   Jimmy was given a year and a half to live in April 1989 because
of the brain tumors.
   He had expressed his desire to meet Bush through a local
organization which grants wishes to terminally ill children.
   However, the White House initially denied the request,
apparently on the grounds that the request had not been made
through the proper channels.
   Bush himself decided to see the boy after reading a news account
in the New York Post suggesting that he was too busy to see the ill
child, said White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen.

   A judge Tuesday ordered Penthouse magazine and
its publisher Robert Guccione to pay $4.06 million to a former Pet
of the Year who charged that he used her as a virtual sex slave.
   State Judge Elliott Wilk ruled that Guccione made sexual demands
on Marjorie Thoreson as a condition of employment at Penthouse,
where she worked from 1973 to 1980.
   ``Sexual slavery was not part of her job description,'' Wilk
said.
   Guccione's ``cold and calculating ... use of sexual coercion
forced her to safeguard her employment by sacrificing her body,''
which is a violation of state law, Wilk said.
   Thoreson, now 37, sued Guccione for $10 million, alleging breach
of contract, sexual harassment and fraud.
   She testified during the March 1989 trial that Guccione forced
her to perform hard-core sex acts in a pornographic movie and used
her sexual favors as partial payment to furnish a hotel-casino he
owned in Atlantic City.
   She said Guccione also ordered her to carry on a sex affair with
his financial adviser so he would move from England to the United
States. She said she severed the relationship because it appeared
the adviser was going to leave his wife and four children.
   Her attorney, Murray Schwartz, said the ruling is ``for all the
women like her who may have suffered at the hands of Guccione. He
has finally been held accountable.''
   Penthouse lawyer Jeffrey Daichman labeled Thoreson a liar and
said an appeal was expected. The ruling ``read more like a
political manifesto about the women's movement than an objective
analysis of the evidence,'' he said.
   Guccione said in a statement that Penthouse presented evidence
to the judge showing that Thoreson ``was a former prostitute,
drug-abuser and three-time felon who had violated her probation.''
   He said Thoresen allegedly began an affair with the financial
adviser ``at a time when she was not even employed by Penthouse.''
   At the trial, Guccione testified that Thoreson was a potential
Marilyn Monroe whom he had rescued from a life of crime.
   The judge, who heard the case with no jury, said Guccione's only
evidence to contradict Thoreson was his word, and added, ``I do not
believe him.''
   Wilk awarded Thoreson $4 million in punitive damages and $60,000
in compensatory damages. The amounts were based on Guccione's $150
million personal worth and Penthouse's market value of about $200
million, he said.
   Thoreson, a native of St. Paul, Minn., was working as a topless
dancer and a cocktail waitress in California in 1973 when she sent
Guccione nude photos and asked if he could help her become an
actress.
   Guccione began by signing her to a personal management contract
and changing her name to Anika di Lorenzo. He made her Penthouse
Pet of the Year in 1975 and invited her to move into his New York
townhouse, which she did.
   In 1976, Guccione cast her in his sexually explicit movie
``Caligula,'' which Thoreson now says was a pornographic film that
ruined her career. For her role, Guccione paid for surgery to have
her breasts enlarged.
   Guccione testified during the trial that he cast her in Caligula
because she was sexually ``and perfect for the part.''
   ``I thought it was a leg-up on prostitution in Las Vegas,
stealing cars, writing bum checks, and building up a life of
crime,'' he said, referring to her checkered past.
   Thoreson sued Guccione after he fired her in 1980 because she
refused to accompany him on a trip to the Far East. She said she
feared he would pass her around to the businessmen he was meeting.

<HEAD>Yeshiva Task Force Formed After Flier Threat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Fliers threatening the lives of Jewish children
here in retaliation for the slayings of Palestinians have been
turned up in Brooklyn and police are trying to calm worried
parents.
   Investigators are unsure if the threat is in earnest, and of how
many of the fliers actually were distributed.
   ``In light of what's been happening in Jerusalem, we have to
take this seriously,'' said Deputy Police Chief Kenneth Gussman, a
ranking police commander in the borough of Brooklyn.
   A 25-officer task force will focus on six precincts with
sizeable Jewish populations in Brooklyn, Gussman said, and ``visit
every yeshiva (Jewish school), ask them if they have received a
copy of the flier, alert them to the fact the flier had been found
and assure them of increased police attention to ally their
fears.''
   The investigators also are seeking the writer of the flier,
which is signed, ``Moslem from New York'' and bears a photo of a
wounded Palestinian shot by Israeli troops in Jerusalem on Temple
Mount earlier this month. Nineteen Palestinians were killed in a
melee that Jews said began when Palestinians threw stones on them.
   The flier says the writer will kill Jewish children, beginning
Monday.
   ``I think it's a prank,'' said Rabbi Bernard Freilich, director
of the Council of Jewish Organizations of Boro Park. ``This does
not look professional, but there's a lot of concern due to what's
going on in the Middle East.''
   The flier was found on a sidewalk on Oct. 17 by a woman who gave
it to a rabbi, Frelich said.
   Copies of the flier reportedly appeared in different sections of
Brooklyn, but police and Frelich said it was not clear whether the
copies were being circulated by alarmed members of the Jewish
community or by others.
   Sixty Jewish religious leaders and school administrators met
with police officials on Monday to discuss the situation.

   Saddam Hussein allowed a trickle of foreigners - including 14
Americans - to leave Iraq on Tuesday, and Iraqi authorities said
all 930 French and Bulgarians held in Iraq and occupied Kuwait will
likely soon be released.
   Many have been held as part of the ``human shield'' strategy
employed by Saddam to protect against attack from multinational
forces massed in the Persian Gulf since Iraq overran Kuwait on Aug.
2.
   More than 1,000 Americans and thousands of other foreigners
still are denied permission to leave Iraq or occupied Kuwait.
   Said President Bush, ``I'm always pleased when Americans might
be released, or if anybody's released. But it just reminds me of
the brutality of the policy, the total brutality, holding people
against their will and parceling them out as though to look
generous. It is brutal and it is unacceptable.''
   The 14 Americans who arrived Tuesday night in Amman, Jordan, on
a regularly scheduled Iraqi Airways flight from Baghdad included
two employees of the besieged U.S. Embassy in occupied Kuwait and
two sons of diplomats stranded there.
   The 14 were taken to a VIP lounge at Queen Alia airport, then
were escorted by embassy officials to an Amman hotel to spend the
night before flying Wednesday morning to Frankfurt, Germany, en
route to the United States.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman at Amman's airport said the group
included ``officials who worked with U.S. government offices in
Iraq and Kuwait.''
   The spokesman, Jonathan Owens, refused to elaborate on their
roles. When asked if the officials were diplomats from the embassy
in Kuwait, he said: ``No, they're not.''
   A member of the American-Iraqi Foundation that assisted in the
release told reporters the group included ``two U.S. embassy
staffers who worked at the embassy in Kuwait, but were released
because they are sick.''
   Hussaini Arabo refused to elaborate on their ailment or disclose
their names and exact functions at the embassy.
   Arabo also said Iraq will free all Western hostages in return
for international assurances that the country will not be attacked
by U.S.-led forces assembled in Saudi Arabia.
   ``President Saddam will release all hostages in one hour if he
gets guarantees from the U.S. or from any other member of the
(U.N.) Security Council that there would be no offensive against
Iraq,'' Arabo said.
   Salim Mansour, head of the foundation, said: ``When we met with
Saddam, we had the impression he genuinely wanted peace. He wants a
peaceful solution to the crisis.'' Mansour gave no date of their
meeting with Saddam.
   Five Finnish men also left Iraq on for home, and 33 ailing or
elderly Britons were scheduled to depart with former British Prime
Minister Edward Heath.
   In Stockholm, Sweden, Iraq's charge d'affaires, Mohammed Said
Hani, announced Tuesday night Iraq will release five Swedes it
holds hostage. He said more would have been freed if Sweden had
sent a higher-ranking official than a Foreign Ministry department
chief to Baghdad last week to try to secure freedom for the 90
Swedes still there.
   Also Tuesday, the Iraqi parliament endorsed Saddam's proposal to
allow all 330 French citizens to leave Iraq. Saddam's move was seen
in Paris as an attempt to divide the West's anti-Iraqi alliance,
and the French government called on Iraq to free all foreign
hostages.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said Saddam also wants to free
all 600 Bulgarians in Iraq and Kuwait. It said he told Parliament
to vote on this issue after a meeting Tuesday with visiting
Bulgarian Vice President Atanas Semerdzhiev.
   In Washington, meanwhile, the Saudi ambassador denied his
kingdom wants Kuwait to concede territory to bring about a peaceful
settlement to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``You cannot make aggression pay,'' Prince Bandar said. ``If you
make aggression pay, that's the law of the jungle.''
   He was summoned to the State Department after reports quoting
the Saudi defense minister, Prince Sultan, had raised the
possibility Iraq might gain territory in return for ending its
occupation.
   Prince Sultan is Prince Bandar's father.
   Bush, speaking in Waterbury, Conn., said he adamantly opposed
any ``territorial compromise'' and said he felt assured that was
the position of the Saudi government.
   ``There is no give on it. If you reward the man with one iota of
territory, you've rewarded aggression. And that is not the position
of the United States nor of our coalition.''
   None of the Americans who left Iraq Tuesday had been part of
Saddam's ``human shield'' against attack.
   ``I'm just thrilled that I'm going,'' William Hollingsworth, 64,
said in Baghdad before boarding the Iraqi Airways flight.
   ``It's a strange coincidence, but I'm leaving the gulf and my
son is in Saudi Arabia,'' said Hollingsworth, of Huntsville, Ala.
He explained that his son is with the multinational force assembled
after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   ``I was waiting for this moment. I am extremely happy, but sad
at the same time because I am leaving many of my friends and
colleagues,'' said 53-year-old Jack Fraser of Santa Ana, Calif.
   Another American, 44-year-old John Thompson, said he was eager
to see his 68-year-old mother in Germany because she is going
blind. ``I'm her only child and she wanted to see me badly,'' he
said.
   Also leaving Iraq was Lloyd Graham, 48, who said he was going
home to his wife, three daughters and son in Houston.
   One evacuee identified himself as Gerald Scognn. He said he is
the son of an American diplomat holed up at the embassy in Kuwait.
   ``I don't know if I will see him again,'' Scognn, 21, of
Fairfax, Va., said of his father.
   ``I am very pleased to be free but I am sad to leave behind a
lot of very good friends,'' he said.
   ``I know why I was freed, but I'd better not discuss that,''
Scognn said in response to a question, adding, ``I want to return
to Fairfax, Virginia, and see my mum and my girlfriend who are very
worried about me.''
   Craig Turlay, 21, of Phoenix, said the situation in Iraq was
``pretty monotonous.''
   ``We just stayed at the embassy headquarters and carried on as
best as we could,'' Turlay said.
   Turlay was moved several weeks ago to Iraq from Kuwait, where
his dad also worked at the embassy. He, too, left his father
behind.
   Neither of the evacuees would identify his father by name or
give other details. No other identities of the freed Americans were
immediately available.
   The Americans left Baghdad with a seven-member delegation from
the American-Iraqi Foundation.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said of the release of
the 14 Americans: ``We always hope that there will be more, and the
history is that when it suits him (Saddam) he lets people go.''
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said that of the
14 Americans, six are ailing, two have critically ill relatives and
six are students. She said 63 Americans with health problems have
not been allowed to leave.
   Prince Bandar, the Saudi envoy, spoke in Washington after
meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   ``Saudi Arabia has not suggested there should be concessions
made to anyone,'' Bandar said.
   His remarks were an apparent attempt to erase any impression
that the Saudi defense minister was proposing that Kuwait make a
deal with Iraq.
   Of his father's comments, Bandar said, ``He was not implying
Kuwait should do one thing or another. He was talking about what we
have done with other countries, negotiating as friends. Saddam did
not choose that route.''
   In other developments, Saudi King Fahd met with President Hosni
Mubarak of Egypt. The monarch later said ``we would be thankful''
if Iraq withdrew from Kuwait.
   Diplomatic sources said Fahd and Mubarak agreed that Iraq's
withdrawal could be followed by negotiations on Iraq's demand for
territorial and financial concessions from Kuwait, including the
islands of Warba and Bubiyan in the gulf and the Kuwaiti section of
the Rumailah oilfield.

   Militants burned six buses early
Wednesday and two workers were slain as unions launched a
nationwide general strike to demand a $1.50 raise in the daily
minimum wage.
   One policeman was also wounded during violence that erupted in
the early hours of the strike called by the leftist May First
Movement.
   The 150,000-member military went on high alert for the strike.
Public transport appeared to be significantly affected by the
walkout, and the military said soldiers would be used as drivers to
prevent a breakdown in service.
   President Corazon Aquino had urged workers against joining the
strike, saying the nation's fragile economy could not afford the
wage increase.
   Unidentified attackers burned buses in the Manila districts of
Santa Mesa and Marikina and in the provinces of Tarlac, Batangas
and two in Cavite.
   In one of the Cavite incidents, the driver and conductor were
stabbed to death after five men boarded the bus, ordered passengers
to disembark and set the vehicle on fire.
   Police arrested eight people in Manila's Marikina district after
authorities found explosives in their shanty.
   Many bus and passenger jeepney drivers refused to ply their
routes out of fear of attacks. Brig. Gen. Emiliano Templo, a
military spokesman, said armed troops were riding in the few buses
still operating.
   Few jeepneys, the main mode of transport, were seen operating
during the morning rush hour in Manila. Schools and colleges in
Manila and surrounding provinces were closed.
   In the capital's Kalookan district, strikers burned tires in the
streets and fled, firing pistols in the air as police approached.
One policeman was wounded, officials said. There were no arrests.
   Bus service north of Manila was virtually paralyzed as strikers
commandeered three buses and barricaded them on a narrow bridge in
Tarlac, home province of Mrs. Aquino.
   In Angeles City, 50 miles north of Manila, the military said
Communist rebels threatened to bomb at least 10 gas stations if
they opened Wednesday.
   Angeles is home to the U.S.-run Clark Air Base, one of the
largest American military facilities overseas. Additional military
checkpoints were set up Wednesday in streets near the sprawling
American base.
   Sen. Ernesto Maceda, chairman of the Senate defense committee,
said the bus attacks appeared to have been carried out by Communist
rebels who endorsed the strike.
   The Cabinet security committee met early Wednesday to assess the
strike but there was no report on any decisions.
   On the eve of the strike, suspected Communist rebels bombed the
headquarters of Shell Philippines and Caltex oil companies and set
fire to a bus near the capital.
   No casualties were reported in any of the attacks, police said.

<TEXT>
   Imagine a mixture of ``Father Knows Best,''
``The Seven Samurai'' and a bit of ``Blue Velvet'' and you may have
some idea of what director David Greenspan has done in ``Gonza the
Lancer.''
   The early 18th-century play, which opened Tuesday at the New
York Shakespeare Festival, was written by Chikamatsu Monzaemon who
is often called ``the Japanese Shakespeare.''
   But Chikamatsu might have a hard time recognizing his bloody
tale of domestic tragedy transposed to a 1950s never-never land
where the characters dress like Ozzie and Harriet but engage in
enough sex and violence to put David Lynch to shame.
   Greenspan is one of three young directors given producer Joseph
Papp's blessing this year at the Public Theater. They have been
allowed to create their own seasons of plays, and Greenspan has
started with this rarely produced work.
   The evening starts on a wildly self-indulgent note when the
director himself steps forward to babble a prologue he wrote in
1982 called ``The Long Flat Plane.'' Greenspan loses a good deal of
the audience with this existential hooey about the meaning of life
and where we are in relationship to it.
   Once it's out of the way, the play can begin. There's a
narrator, here played by two different actors, one for each act.
Greenspan borrows freely - and often to good effect - from story
theater as well as Charles Ludlum's Ridiculous Theater Company.
   When Gonza gets on a horse to ride, actor Koji Okamura mounts a
metal stool. When the heroine's little children appear, they are
doll-like puppets carried by other performers. And there is some
gender-bending in the casting, with several male actors playing
female characters and women cast in men's roles.
   Actor Tim Perez - looking uncomfortably like Harvey Fierstein in
drag - dons a babushka, a floral print blouse and purple slacks to
play a governess. Actress Fanni Green sports a mustache to portray
a warlord.
   On a mostly bare stage, Greenspan gets most of his laughs out of
his props. There are some amusing 1950s artifacts - a pink vacuum
sweeper being among the more interesting.
   The acting is rudimentary, but at least Mary Shultz, who
projects a Marilyn Monroe sultriness, manages to convey some
emotion as the doomed Osai. The rest of the cast seem like stick
figures.
   The production's oddness doesn't necessarily make the evening
any more interesting. In fact, that's all you remember. This
version of ``Gonza the Lancer'' sticks in the memory more for its
weirdness than anything Greenspan and company have to say about the
play.

<HEAD>Attorney General Goes on Trial for Credit Card Misuse</HEAD>

   Arkansas' attorney general cheated the
taxpayers out of more than $8,000 for his own use while serving as
the state's top legal officer, a prosecutor alleged Tuesday at his
theft trial.
   A defense attorney responded that the state gave Attorney
General Steve Clark authority to use his state-issued Visa credit
card any way he pleased and so he cannot be convicted of misusing
it.
   The 43-year-old Democrat is charged with one count of felony
theft by deception. If convicted, he could be sentenced to 20 years
in prison and could be fined $15,000.
   In opening arguments, prosecutor Chris Piazza accused Clark of
improperly billing taxpayers at least $8,448.27 on his credit card
for meals 56 times from 1986 to 1989 with family, friends and
political supporters.
   ``You'll see a transformation. You'll see a side you didn't know
existed, a transformation much like that of Jekyll and Hyde,''
Piazza said, referring to author Robert Louis Stevenson's
double-sided character.
   ``When you're finished with this evidence - I hate to tell you
this - you'll see a transformation from attorney general of the
state of Arkansas to a convicted felon,'' Piazza told the jury,
which was seated Monday on the opening day of the trial.
   After the allegations arose in February, Clark reimbursed the
state $3,951.29. He blamed poor record-keeping and said records of
his meetings were reconstructed from notes, his calendar, receipts
or memory every two to three months.
   The allegations also forced Clark to give up his candidacy for
the Democratic nomination for governor, improving Gov. Bill
Clinton's re-election chances.
   Dozens of people Clark listed on his expense account as dinner
guests either say they didn't eat with him or they didn't discuss
state business.
   Defense attorney Bill Bristow maintained that Clark ``can use
that credit card from the state of Arkansas anyway he wants to. If
he wants to, he can buy a car with it. A house with it. He is not
forbidden by law from doing that.''
   ``You may say to Steve, `You were sloppy, you were vain, you
used bad judgment, you ruined your political career, but, Steve,
you didn't commit a crime,''' Bristow said.
   Bristow said Clark is not the only elected official who spends
state money for personal use.
   ``You know who spent money on entertainment? Spent money for
postage and spent money for laundry? The governor,'' Bristow said.
   Clinton gets an allowance for the governor's mansion, which pays
for food and entertainment. The state receipts for $25,960 in
mansion expenses in 1989 come under the heading ``Food,'' Bristow
said.
   Clark, in office since 1979, earns $26,500 a year. His salary is
among the lowest among state attorneys general.

<TEXT>
   A jury was seated Tuesday to decide a
$757 million lawsuit that accuses PTL founder Jim Bakker and others
working for the TV ministry of diverting contributors' money to
their own use.
   Opening arguments in the civil action filed by thousands of
former followers of the former TV evangelist were scheduled for
Wednesday morning.
   Bakker, 50, is in a Minnesota prison, serving a 45-year sentence
for his conviction last October on charges of fraud and conspiracy
in connection with PTL. He is appealing the conviction.
   The lawsuit was filed in 1987 on behalf of 145,000 so-called
``lifetime partners,'' several months after Bakker resigned from
the PTL in the wake of a sex and money scandal.
   Most of Bakker's ``lifetime partners'' sent him $1,000 in
exchange for lodging at the Heritage U.S.A., a Christian retreat
south of Charlotte that once was connected to the PTL.
   The lawsuit alleges that Bakker and other PTL officials,
accountants and others, conspired to fraudulently raise million of
dollars for the ministry, then launder it so Bakker and his top
aides could spend it on themselves.
   The jury in the civil action was chosen from about 120 potential
jurors over four days.
   The eight primary jurors were selected on Monday. Attorneys
negotiated more than nine hours on Tuesday before agreeing to go to
trial with four alternate jurors instead of six.

   Indian fishermen on Tuesday sued private
contractors who ran the Hanford nuclear reservation for nearly five
decades, alleging that radioactive contamination from the complex
damaged their livelihood.
   The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court is the third class
action that claims plutonium and uranium processing at Hanford
damaged local residents' health or ability to make a living.
   Two similar suits were filed this summer on behalf of
potentially thousands of people living or working downwind from
Hanford. The legal actions followed a government panel's conclusion
that emissions from Hanford during the 1940s and 1950s were large
enough to cause illness to nearby residents.
   A study by The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta is
underway to determine past effects of Hanford emissions on those
living nearby.
   The latest case filed in U.S. District Court case seeks
unspecified amounts for lost income and earning capacity,
diminished property values and property damage.
   It also asks that further releases of radioactivity and toxic
chemicals be barred and that exising radioactive and other
contamination be cleaned up.
   The seven Yakima Indians filing the lawsuit claim radioactivy
and other contamination has damaged the Columbia River fishery
since the 560-square-mile reservation was established during World
War II.
   The suit said the class eventually could include more than 700
Indians who fish along the river.
   The Indians' attorney, Fred Sayre of Santa Monica, Calif., said
the Yakimas do not fish some river areas because they fear
radioactive contamination.
   Lawyers for the current main contractor, Westinghouse Hanford
Co., would not comment on the lawsuit, said spokesman Bill Klink.
   Also named as defendants were several major corporations and
their Hanford subsidiaries, which were hired to run reactors,
chemical plants and waste storage operations on the federal
reservation over the past 50 years.
   Telephone calls placed after hours to the offices of the
following former contractors went unanswered on Tuesday: E.I. du
Pont de Nemours, of Wilmington, Del., which built Hanford during
the Manhattan Project and operated it until 1946; General Electric
Co., of Fairfield, Conn.; Atlantic Richfield Co., of Los Angeles;
and Rockwell International Co., of El Segundo, Calif.

<HEAD>Factions in Liberian Civil War Hold Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANJUL, Gambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Liberia's three warring factions met
together for the first time in months Tuesday to discuss a
cease-fire plan for the troubled West African nation.
   At the session, a general in a five-nation force in Liberia said
it was safe for a caretaker government to move into the capital
city of Monrovia.
   Rebel leader Charles Taylor has for months refused to send a
representative to the talks, called by a West African regional
mediation group. Taylor said his aides were in Banjul only to
listen and report back, but some officials said their presence
suggested Taylor has not completely rejected negotiations.
   The last attempt at a cease-fire broke down in late September.
The West African military force sent to oversee the truce later
began attacking Taylor's men when they resisted relinquishing
control of Monrovia.
   Taylor is opposed by remnants of slain President Samuel Doe's
forces, who still hold the executive mansion in Monrovia, and a
splinter rebel group led by Prince Johnson.
   Johnson's troops on Sept. 9 captured and killed Doe, who was
visiting the headquarters of the 6,000-member West African force.
   Troops for Johnson and Doe have been cooperating with the
multinational force from Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone and
Gambia.
   At least 5,000 civilians have died in the civil war since Taylor
invaded from Ivory Coast on Christmas Eve.
   The regional force has driven Taylor's soldiers from Morovia's
suburbs and field commander Gen. Joshua Dongonyaro of Nigeria told
the meeting the interim government could take power.
   The government, headed by political scientist Amos Sawyer, was
created by the five West African nations to rule until elections
can be held.
   Taylor has opposed creation of the government, saying his men
control the majority of the country and he should be president.
   Taylor has set up headquarters in the central city of Gbargna,
which he has declared is the country's new capital. He said he
plans to hold elections within the year.
   Representatives of Doe's remaining forces accused the regional
force's former field commander of being responsible for the
president's death. They claimed Ghanaian Lt. Gen. Arnold Quainoo
ordered Doe's security guards disarmed when they arrived at the
headquarters, but let Johnson's men keep their weapons.
   Johnson's soldiers slaughtered Doe's men, said Gen. Hezekiah
Bowen, who represented Doe's forces at Tuesday's meetings.
   Quainoo has denied any responsibility for Doe's capture and
death, saying his men could not have intervened without breaking
their pledge of neutrality. He was replaced as field commander
shortly after Doe's death.
   Meanwhile, Sierra Leone is reviewing its position on welcoming
Liberian refugees because of a disagreement about how many there
are in the country.
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimates there are
60,000, but the government in Sierra Leone says the number is more
than three times higher.

<HEAD>Mexico Wants U.S. Officers on Illegal Extradition Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico is demanding extradition of two Texas
lawmen on charges of illegally bringing two Mexican men to the
United States to face murder charges, the attorney general's office
announced Tuesday.
   It said prosecution against the two has already begun in their
absence.
   The allegations are similar to those of an April case that
damaged U.S.-Mexican relations: Mexico charged U.S. officials with
arranging the kidnapping of a Mexican doctor accused of helping
murder a U.S. drug agent.
   A news release said the former chief of Coahuila state judicial
police, Angel Joaquin Lugo Castaneda, was arrested Saturday in the
case and was jailed, and that two lower-ranking Mexican police were
charged.
   The news release Tuesday said the Foreign Ministry ``is seeking
the immediate extradition of the U.S. policemen,'' identified as
Mitch Woods and Frank Collazo of Beaumont, Texas.
   Woods is an investigator with the Jefferson County district
attorney's office and Collazo is a policeman in Port Arthur.
   Contacted Tuesday, Collazo said he is involved in the case, but
his first name is not Frank; it is Luis.
   Efforts to reach Woods for comment were unavailing.
   The news release said murder suspects Hector Javier Morales
Villa and Omar Ayala Mendoza were arrested by Coahuila state
policemen Hector Galindo Lopez and Federico Rivera Balderas ``and
turned over to the U.S. police in the middle of International
Bridge between Piedras Negras and Eagle Pass, Texas.''
   Piedras Negras is in Coahuila state, across the border from
Eagle Pass.
   The Mexico City daily Excelsior said the two are charged with
killing an elderly woman. It gave Morales' age as 24 and Ayala's as
21.
   Excelsior said Galindo and Rivera were being sought.
   The Mexico City daily El Universal said the parents of the two
murder suspects accused Lugo of accepting $80,000 from U.S. police
to hand the two over. Both suspects lived in Palau, 85 miles
southwest of the Eagle Pass border crossing.
   The newspaper said officials failed to act on the parents'
complaint until they appealed to President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari. It said state officials fired Lugo on his incentive.
   A spokeswoman for the attorney general's office said she could
not elaborate on details of the case, and was unsure of the penalty
for illegal extradition because Mexico is in the process of
revising criminal penalties.
   Excelsior ran a front-page story Tuesday accusing the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration of protecting two of the six Mexicans
accused in Mexico of kidnapping Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain in
April and spiriting him across the border.
   U.S. officials are trying to prosecute Alvarez Machain on
charges of aiding in the 1985 torture-murder of DEA agent Enrique
Camarena. They are appealing a court decision that his arrest was
illegal.
   Mexico has demanded the extradition of Antonio Garate Bustamante
and Hector Berrellez.

   Floodwaters caused a strange chain-reaction accident Tuesday in
South Carolina when water washed out railroad tracks, causing a
train to derail and knock down a highway overpass. Two automobiles
fell into the gap left by the overpass, and one motorist was
killed.
   The accident was among several caused by thunderstorms that
doused the Carolinas and spun off tornadoes. Rain fell through much
of the Atlantic states.
   The railroad accident took place near St. Matthews in central
South Carolina.
   Flooding washed out supports under railroad tracks, causing a
freight train loaded with coal to derail, said Sam McCuen, a state
Highway Department spokesman. The train hit an overpass carrying
U.S. Highway 176, collapsing the span and sending automobiles
plunging through the open space, he said.
   One man was killed and two others were injured, authorities
said.
   Elsewhere in South Carolina, strong wind and heavy rain forced
the evacuation of 20 families from a mobile home park, injured at
least five people and flooded roads under several feet of water
across the state, authorities said.
   North Carolina had at least two tornadoes and record amounts of
rain that swelled rivers to flood stage, the National Weather
Service said.
   ``Nobody was hurt or anything. They were just shook up,'' said a
dispatcher with the Newport police department after a twister
touched down in a mobile home park in the eastern Carteret County
town.
   In Alamance County, N.C., a state Department of Transportation
worker's car was swept down a flooded roadway while the man was
checking flooding near the Graham waste treatment plant.
   ``The water just swept me down the bank and pretty soon the car
was completely submerged,'' said 47-year-old Sammy Barnes. ``I
rolled the window down, but the water was coming in so fast I
didn't think I would ever get out.''
   Barnes climbed out of the car and clung to a low-lying branch
for more than an hour before a fellow transportation worker saw the
lights of his car and pulled him to safety. He was not injured.
   The storm nearly doubled the record amount of rain in the
Wilmington area for Tuesday's date. According to the National
Weather Service, 4.23 inches of rain fell in about six hours. The
previous high for the date was 2.23 inches in 1914. The old record
for any day in October was 4.2 inches on Oct. 11, 1882.

   The murder trial of Marlon Brando's
son can begin even if Brando's daughter, who is the victim's lover
and a potential witness, can't be brought back from Tahiti,
prosecutors indicated Tuesday.
   The daughter, Cheyenne Brando, was at the actor's mansion May 16
when her brother, Christian, allegedly shot and killed her Tahitian
lover.
   Superior Court Judge Robert Thomas ordered 255 prospective
jurors to court Nov. 5 for the start of Christian Brando's trial.
   Deputy District Attorney Steven Barshop said he is continuing to
negotiate with French authorities for the return of Miss Brando
from Tahiti, where she took refuge shortly after the shooting. But
the approaching trial date makes it unlikely that the complicated
legal agreement can be reached, he said.
   The assistant prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney William
Clark, said the State Department has been contacted about the case
and has requested documents from the prosecution for use in
negotiations with French authorities. The authorities have been
preventing Miss Brando's departure from the French colony.
   Miss Brando, 20, has been charged in Tahiti as an accessory to
the murder of her lover, Dag Drollet, 26. Although he died in the
United States, the French consider his death a crime against one of
their citizens.
   ``We are not optimistic,'' Clark said of the prospects of Miss
Brando's return. ``The French are telling her she is not free to
leave.''
   Miss Brando went to Tahiti in June and recently gave birth to
Drollet's child there.
   The prosecution has a strong case even without Miss Brando's
testimony, Clark said.
   ``We're pretty sure we know what happened that night ... But
when it comes to murder, that's always the hardest to prove,''
Clark said. ``We would like to have Cheyenne. She's one of the most
important witnesses.''
   Clark said the key issue will be whether Christian Brando is
guilty of murder or the lesser charge of manslaughter. The
defendant claims the shooting was accidental.
   Clark said he anticipates calling other witnesses to describe
the events of the murder night, adding he hoped the defendant would
take the stand.
   Asked whether the prosecution would call Marlon Brando as a
witness or leave that to the defense, Clark said, ``We're sure he's
going to take the stand. Who calls him first is part of the
gamesmanship.''

   The Security Council on Tuesday postponed
for 24 hours a vote on a resolution criticizing Israel for not
cooperating with a U.N. probe of the killing of 19 Palestinians.
The council thinks Israel will change its mind.
   U.S., British, Arab and non-aligned nation diplomats all said
later they thought Israel may release its own inquest into the Oct.
8 killings on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem and allow a U.N. envoy
to visit the scene.
   At least 19 Palestinians died when Israeli security forces fired
on protesters throwing rocks on Jews praying at the Western Wall,
also known as the Wailing Wall.
   Israel has said letting in a U.N. investigating commission would
infringe on its sovereignty over Jerusalem, which it has annexed.
   Yemeni Ambassador Abdalla Saleh al-Ashtal said the United States
would be trying to persuade Israel to cooperate before the vote is
taken on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Police arrested 21 people
Tuesday and recovered food and aid items believed looted by former
Indian Contra rebels and others upset over worsening conditions on
Nicaragua's isolated Atlantic Coast.
   Three people were wounded in a spate of looting last week in
Puerto Cabezas, where friction remains strong between ex-Contra
rebels and Sandinista loyalists on the police force.
   The tension is also seen as a reflection of increasingly hard
times in Nicaragua's economy.
   Flooding this year destroyed many crops in the region and an
austerity program by President Violeta Chamorro has meant less
money and jobs for the Atlantic Coast. Ms. Chamorro defeated
Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega in February elections.
   Samuel Cepeda, a Miskito Indian who allegedly led the looting,
accused government officials of stealing donations intended for the
Indians.
   Cepeda is a leader of Kisan For Peace, an umbrella group of
three Indian organizations that signed peace accords with the
former Sandinista government in 1988.
   Kisan seeks assistance similar to the aid given about 2,300
Yatama Indian rebels that demobilized last June. The Yatama and
other former Contras got offers of land and other help.
   Both Kisan and Yatama are made up of Miskito, Sumo and Rama
Indians who generally opposed the leftist Sandinista government.
   Cepeda said Leonel Panting, head of the regional government,
assured Kisan it would receive part of a boatload of donations from
Managua that arrived in Puerto Cabezas Oct. 12.
   ``They promised us a third of the cargo, but we could see them
at night stealing from the warehouses,'' Cepeda said.
   About 300 Kisan members and relatives raided a warehouse
belonging to the Moravian Church on Oct. 18 as goods were being
loaded onto trucks. The looters took tools, cooking oil, rice,
flour and powdered milk.
   Five police guards fired into the air, witnesses said. Two
officers and a civilian were wounded by ricocheting bullets, police
said.
   A day later, a smaller group looted a government warehouse
containing donated clothes. Police were not present at the
incident.
   Puerto Cabezas police chief Dean Dixon said the items recovered
in the raids are a small part of what was stolen.
   Briceno Ortega, 37, one of those arrested in the pre-dawn raids,
admitted he stole food but claimed Indians sought to divert aid for
themselves.

   Rebels seeking to overthrow the
government of Rwanda are prepared to accept a cease-fire, Uganda's
President Yoweri Museveni said.
   Museveni made the announcement following a second round of talks
with Belgium's Prime Minister Wilfried Martens and Defense Minister
Guy Coeme.
   ``I have just received word from them which indicated that they
were ready to observe a cease-fire,'' said Museveni's statement on
Monday.
   Rebel officials, however, could not immediately be reached for
comment.
   Martens initiated efforts last week to negotiate an end to the
fighting between government troops and a Tutsi rebel force
comprised mostly of Rwandese refugees.
   The rebels, which invaded Sept. 30 from Uganda, accuse Rwanda's
Hutu-dominated government of corruption, human rights abuses and
failing to repatriate refugees. Many of the rebels are former
Ugandan army troops. As many as 10,000 Tutsis were massacred and
hundreds of thousands driven into exile in the 1960s.
   Rwanda's President Juvenal Habyarimana agreed to a cease-fire
and a condition for peace talks during a meeting in Tanzania last
week with Museveni and Tanzania's President Ali Hassan Mwinyi. A
large number of Rwandan refugees also live in Tanzania.
   The leaders also agreed that neutral troops acceptable to both
sides should monitor the truce in the former Belgian colony in
south-central Africa.

   A woman who told police she locked her child
in the trunk of a car every weekend for a month while she was at
work has been charged with criminal restraint.
   Chante Fernandez, 24, of Elizabeth, told police and reporters
she did it out of desperation. She said she'd been abandoned by her
husband and was unable to find any one responsible to care for her
5-year-old daughter while Ms. Fernendez worked weekends at a
shopping mall.
   Her arrest Saturday has focused attention on day care options as
legislators and some state welfare officials criticized the system
for failing poor families.
   If convicted of criminal restraint, Ms. Fernandez faces a
maximum penalty of five years in prison and $7,500 fine.
   According to police, Ms. Fernandez said she had kept the child
in the car during weekends for the past month while she worked as a
salesclerk in the Fortunoff store in the Woodbridge Center mall.
   Ms. Fernendez reportedly told police she kept the child in the
car after firing three babysitters because they had stolen her
food, invited guests to her home and left her daughter unattended.
   Roberta Francis, director of the division on women for the state
Department of Community Affairs said she disapproved of the action,
but noted Ms. Fernendez felt she had little choice.
   The mother ``had no other option but to do that,'' Ms. Francis
said. ``It was a Catch-22. Society shouldn't put people into a
Catch-22 situation and our reaction should not be to completely
blame the mother for what she did.''
   Ms. Fernandez, who is free on $5,000 bail, was arrested Saturday
after police found the pajama-clad child in the trunk of a 1987
Toyota Celica in the mall parking lot. The child, who was in good
condition, was taken into custody by the state Division of Youth
and Family Services pending an investigation into the charges.
   In a telephone interview, Ms. Fernandez said she was notified
Tuesday that she was fired from her $300-a-week secretarial job at
the Central Lumber Management Co. in Elizabeth.
   A woman who answered the company's telephone Tuesday refused to
discuss the case or refer the call to someone who would.
   Ms. Fernandez said she earned $160 on weekends as a saleswoman
at the Fortunoff store at the mall. Fortunoff officials on Tuesday
confirmed that she had worked at the store but refused to say
whether she remained with the company.
   Ms. Fernandez said her husband abandoned her, her father died in
January and her house had been robbed three times.
   ``I don't have anything now,'' Ms. Fernandez said. ``I've lost
everything.''
   Legislators and social service officials say the case
demonstrates the lack of child care for poor working families. A
bill that would provide $75,000 in grants toward the construction
and expansion of child-care centers was introduced in 1988, said
state Sen. Wynona Lipman, D-Essex, the bill's sponsor.
   The legislation is pending.
   ``We realize that facilities are lacking,'' said Ms. Lipman. ``I
think we're working hard to correct that, but still, low-income
children are rapidly being left on the landing and their mothers
have no child care because they can't afford it. It's hard to
correct the issue.''
   She said there are 300,000 children under the age of six
competing for about 100,000 day-care slots across the state.
   However, Linda Moroses of the Community Coordinated Child Care
of Union County said there is day care for those who seek it. The
agency is a day-care referral service.
   ``If a person were really looking, they would find us,'' she
said. ``Yu can find our number in advertising in the paper, flyers
in the public school systems, word of mouth, in corporate
buildings, in the phone book.''

<HEAD>Sheriff's Deputy Shot Over Campaign Signs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sheriff's deputy was shot and critically
wounded Tuesday while hanging up campaign posters for the
Democratic opponent of Cook County Sheriff James O'Grady, police
said.
   Sheriff's Deputy Irving Bell and at least three other people
were posting signs for Alderman Michael Sheahan when another
sheriff's deputy who apparently supports the Republican incumbent
emerged from a nearby bar and shouted at them to remove the signs,
said police Cmdr Ronnie Watson.
   The deputy then called inside the bar for about 10 acquaintances
to help him and ordered one of them to kill the Sheahan supporters,
Watson alleged. A man pulled out a gun and fired at Bell, hitting
him in the back, the stomach and the buttocks, he said.
   Bell, 34, was in critical condition Tuesday night at Christ
Hospital and Medical Center, said hospital spokeswoman Jan Barnett.
His colleagues escaped unharmed.
   The 3 a.m. shooting on the South Side left both candidates in
the sheriff's race accusing each other of allowing thugs to work on
the campaign.
   O'Grady contended that the wounded deputy was not putting up
Sheahan posters but was instead pulling down O'Grady posters.
   Police were questioning an O'Grady campaign worker about the
shooting, the Chicago Sun-Times reported in its early Wednesday
editions. Watson said two men were being questioned but that no
charges had been filed.
   ``For something like this to happen to one of our workers is
absolutely shocking,'' Sheahan said. ``I'm interested in winning
this election, but I'm not interested in anyone getting hurt.''
   ``I'm asking Mr. O'Grady to call off these people, these thugs
and goons. This is the worst thing I've ever seen in politics.''
   O'Grady said Sheahan workers had provoked the confrontation by
tearing down his campaign signs and vandalizing his campaign
office.
   ``This incident is the unfortunate outgrowth of a rising tide of
street-level hooliganism, vandalism, and intimidation directed
against our campaign by the Sheahan campaign,'' O'Grady said in a
statement.
   O'Grady said the Sheahan supporters outside the bar are part of
an ``ongoing night crew'' assigned to steal or damage his
campaign's property.
   O'Grady said Bell has been suspended from the sheriff's office
while unrelated allegations are investigated.

   Carrying a child does not make a woman
a parent, a judge ruled in awarding a test-tube baby to the boy's
genetic parents instead of the surrogate they hired for $10,000.
   Civil rights advocates and ethicists charged that the ruling
Monday by Superior Court Judge Richard Parslow ignores the law and
creates a ``breeder class'' of women.
   ``The judge is saying gestation doesn't count, it counts for
nothing, and I think that is a very disturbing outcome,'' said
Susan M. Wolf, an associate for law at the Hastings Center, an
ethics research institute in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.
   In giving custody of the 5-week-old boy to Mark and Crispina
Calvert instead of surrogate mother Anna Johnson, the judge said,
``A surrogate carrying a genetic child for a couple does not
acquire parental rights.''

   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - A white supremacist says a $12.5 million
verdict against himself and his followers over the slaying of a
black man will leave him broke - but free to preach violence
without fear of being sued again.
   A jury Monday found that Tom Metzger, a former grand dragon of
the Ku Klux Klan, and his White Aryan Resistance incited the
slaying by skinhead toughs.
   The jury ordered Metzger and his followers to pay the family of
Mulugeta Seraw the entire $12.5 million sought on its behalf by the
Southern Poverty Law Center of Montgomery, Ala.
   ``Back home, we say it cleans his plow,'' said Morris Dees, an
attorney for the law center. ``The first thing we're going to do is
send a moving van to his house so we can take it over.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The House ethics committee is opening an
urgent investigation of whether Rep. Donald E. Lukens, R-Ohio, made
improper sexual advances toward a Capitol employee.
   Lukens, convicted in Ohio last year of a misdemeanor sex
offense, was ordered to testify under oath today about the new
allegation.
   ``The committee has received additional evidence indicating that
Rep. Lukens may have made unwanted and unsolicited sexual advances
to a congressional employee,'' the committee said in a statement
issued Monday evening.
   Sources close to the case said Lukens recently fondled and
propositioned a young elevator operator in the Capitol, and gave
her his business card. She reported the incident to her
supervisors, and one source said there was a witness to corroborate
her story.

   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani is
intensifying his purge of anti-Western radical rivals in a power
struggle that looks to be heating up against the backdrop of the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   The outcome, at this stage, does not seem to be in doubt:
Rafsanjani is gradually consolidating his power.
   But he needs to force the pace to maintain the momentum of his
effort to liberalize Iran's economy and society after the June 1989
death of revolutionary patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Rafsanjani, leader of the so-called pragmatists, is seeking to
improve the quality of life for Iran's 55 million people to cement
his popularity. He also seeks to rebuild bridges with the West and
the Arabs.

   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) - Minnesota's Republican auditor has jumped
into the governor's race, taking advantage of allegations the
regular GOP nominee invited teen-age girls to take a nude dip with
him nine years ago.
   Auditor Arne Carlson announced a write-in campaign Monday
against Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich and Perpich's embattled
Republican challenger, business executive John Grunseth.
   Two women have charged in sworn statements that Grunseth
encouraged them to join him in a nude swim in 1981, when they were
13 and 14. Grunseth, 44, denied the allegation but has been under
increasing pressure from his party to quit the race.
   An internal GOP poll last week indicated that five Republicans,
including Carlson, could beat Perpich in the Nov. 6 election but
that Grunseth could not. Carlson, auditor since 1979, finished
second to Grunseth in last month's GOP primary.

<HEAD>Nome Merchants Take Rubles But Can't Dish 'Em Out</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sign posted on the doors of a
half-dozen Nome businesses depicts a handshake and reads, in
English and Russian, ``We accept many rubles.''
   The problem so far has been getting rid of them.
   ``There's been no monetary benefit so far - it's like Monopoly
money,'' said Nome Liquor and Grocery owner Greg Higashi, who has
accepted more than 5,000 rubles in about nine months from visitors
from across the Bering Strait.
   ``But we did it for good will, not profits. And we're hoping
that maybe when it does open up in Russia that we can exchange them
for merchandise or whatever.''
   Soviet officials have said the ruble could become convertible on
the international market within a couple of years as part of the
nation's transition to a market economy. But for many Nome
merchants, the pace of Soviet reform has been frustratingly slow.
   In the first nine months of their neighborly grass-roots
experiment in monetary exchange, Nome merchants have sold thousands
of dollars in goods and services to Soviet visitors.
   In return, they have gotten 30,000 virtually worthless rubles
they can neither spend nor invest. Some shopkeepers have found only
one use for the Soviet bills: They sell them to American tourists
as souvenirs.
   The merchants hope that by accepting rubles they will encourage
freer trade and travel across the Bering Strait, forming new
friendships and eventually new markets for Alaskans.
   ``The whole intent of the project was a goodwill public
relations campaign to convince the Soviets to make the ruble
convertible or allow us to use it,'' said Nome city manager Jim
Stimpfle.
   The Soviet government sets the ruble's value artificially, apart
from the market fluctuations that determine other currencies'
values. It is illegal in most cases to take rubles out of the
Soviet Union. But many Soviet travelers to Nome do bring rubles
with them, merchants say.
   Since the ``ice curtain'' between Alaska and the Soviet Far East
began thawing in the late 1980s, Nome has seen an influx of Soviet
visitors on cultural, scientific and other exchanges. Soviet
Eskimos are allowed to visit their Alaska counterparts without
visas.
   Many Nome residents likewise have visited Soviet cities like
Magadan, Anadyr and the closest city, Provideniya, about 230 miles
west of Nome.
   A year ago, Nome-based Bering Air began allowing Soviet citizens
to pay for trips to Alaska with rubles, and the Nome Chamber of
Commerce followed suit early this year, urging businesses to accept
the Soviet money.
   Bering Air has an average of two charter flights weekly between
Provideniya and Nome, resulting in a fairly steady stream of Soviet
visitors.
   Stimpfle said he has visited the Soviet Far East seven times and
sees many opportunities for trade.
   ``We can make it work if they'll let us use their currency. We
can start a market system much faster, and we don't have to wait
for a convertible ruble,'' he said. ``But the Soviets just want
dollars - dollars, dollars, dollars.''
   Bering Air President Jim Rowe is paid in rubles by customers in
Provideniya, and puts the rubles in a Soviet bank. But Soviet
authorities require that he use dollars - or even barter items like
calculators and typewriters - to pay landing fees, so he has
nothing to spend the rubles on.
   In January, he gave 80,000 rubles to Soviet schools and
hospitals rather then let them be taxed in the bank, said Chris
Rowe, his wife and the company's vice president.
   The carrier, which also flies to 25 northwest Alaska villages,
is able to cover its expenses but isn't profiting from the
Provideniya runs, she said.
   ``It's not fair,'' she said. ``If they want to pay us in rubles,
they'll have to come up with something we can do with them.''
   But Rowe also said Nome residents are investing in the future
and making it more affordable for ordinary Soviet citizens to visit
the United States. Bering Air offers an exchange rate of one ruble
to one dollar - compared to the official Soviet rate for tourists
of about six rubles to the dollar.
   Nome businesses offer varying exchange rates. Nome Checker Cab
offers one-to-one, charging four rubles for the $4 ride from the
airport to town, said owner Gary Hart. Hart even has ``Checker''
written in Russian letters on his cabs.
   ``We're all willing to take this gamble in hopes we'll encourage
national leaders to maybe look at one little northwest Alaska
community that's willing to develop international trade,'' Hart
said.
   Marty James, owner of Maruskiya's of Nome gift shop, said he has
collected about 1,000 rubles, mainly selling T-shirts and souvenir
pins.
   He wants to buy more products from the Soviet Far East
eventually, particularly Eskimo crafts.
   On a recent trip to Provideniya, James' family met a Soviet
family who later sent gifts.
   ``They make very lovely things there - lead crystal, cups and
saucers, a silver ring they sent my wife,'' he said. ``They're
great people - they're our neighbors. I'd like someday to be able
to travel over there like you would do here and go to a co-op or
some kind of organization that would have goods available.
   ``Everything cannot go through governments. That's a lesson they
have to learn and have not learned yet. If we're part of that in a
small way, I'd be happy.''

<HEAD>CBS' `WIOU' Brings Television Newsroom to Television</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Imagine the newsroom of ``The Mary Tyler Moore
Show,'' seduced by the dark side of The Force, and you have
``WIOU.''
   It's the same people in different bodies, acting out a premise
gone wrong. At its best, tonight's premiere is a bleak, black
comedy of television manners, rich with the irony that what happens
in front of the camera rarely corresponds with what goes on behind
it.
   At its worst, it strains to introduce a raft of characters,
establish their relationships and tell a story. A fine cast,
horribly wasted, is under orders to create caricatures instead of
characters.
   They struggle heroically to create dramatic tension out of a
fundamentally flawed script.
   ``WIOU'' is WNDY, a financially ailing Chicago TV station at the
bottom of the ratings.
   John Shea plays Hank Zaret, newly named the station's third news
director inside a year. Exiled from New York by network brass over
a career-threatening screwup, his mandate is to turn the station
around.
   This displeases his immediate subordinate, executive producer
Liz McVay (Mariette Hartley), who's been passed over for his job.
And it re-introduces him to an old flame, Kelby Robinson (Helen
Shaver), an ambitious reporter angling for a shot at anchoring the
news.
   Shea, Hartley and Shaver give ``WIOU'' its only semblance of
rational adult behavior and professionalism. Otherwise, it's a
newsroom filled with outlandish characters conforming to our worst
expectations of stereotypes:
   Harris Yulin (who has moments of magnificence) plays the
reptilian, sexist, Pompous Anchor who's pulling down a
million-three and can't keep his hands to himself;
   Dick Van Patten, portraying a Shameless Ham of a Weatherman, can
expect a bill for royalties from Willard Scott; Joe Grifasi plays
the Cynical Flack, a P.R. hustler obsessed with ratings;
   Phil Morris plays the shallow, shameless, Nakedly Ambitious
Reporter out to make a name for himself;
   Jayne Brook plays the Earnest Young Producer getting her shot as
a reporter; and Wallace Langham is the Eager Young Intern who
worships her.
   As the show's publicity says: ``The personal and professional
lives of these men and women in front of the cameras and behind the
scenes are brought sharply into focus as they confront the
harrowing deadlines, newsroom politics, ratings battles and ethical
dilemmas which are literally all in a day's work.''
   'Nuff said?
   Nah.
   Here's a taste of what's to come:
   The Shameless, Nakedly Ambitious Reporter arrives at the scene
of the fire:
   ``If this is a two-alarm fire, I'm Mrs. O'Leary's cow!'' quoth
he.
   Then the Earnest Young Producer interviews a fire victim, the
father of a missing child. Agonized, she cuts off the Pompous
Anchor's really dreadful questions when they intrude on the
father's grief.
   She stops the interview but lets the cameraman continue his
tight shot on the weeping man's face for about five minutes.
   Sensitive, eh?
   What's genuinely incredible about this program is that two of
its executive producers, its co-creators and the pilot's
co-writers, John Eisendrath and Kathryn Pratt, actually worked at
Chicago's WBBM-TV, owned and operated by CBS.
   Given the opportunity to say something about their former craft,
its horrors, absurdities and the vast majority of hard-working news
professionals, they give us cliches.

<HEAD>Yes, Homeowner, There is A Future to Housing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When housing prices are falling and investment
analysts are frothing about a collapse of the real estate market,
there still is no safer place for your money than the home in which
you live.
   The truth of the statement lies in the historical evidence. It
shows that while price declines do occur they are rare and
relatively short-lived, and that housing prices recover with the
economy and often grow faster than it.
   Still, you would have to be hard of hearing not to detect the
shrieking of the sirens, the screeching of the alarmists, the blare
of the headlines. Houses unsold after 12 months on the market!
Sellers cutting prices $50,000!
   So what? Homeowners know that no matter what the market analysts
say, they do not lose money on their houses until they choose to
sell or have to sell.
   Some of the bearish comments come from academe, some from
writers seeking to cash in on homeowner fears, some from brokerage
house analysts who tend to view a house solely as an investment
rather than a place in which to live.
   This week a brokerage house analyst commented sagely that
thousands of people who purchased houses three years ago have a
loss on their investment, a statement that bears little resemblance
to facts or reality.
   Most of the people who live in those homes would, in fact, be
surprised and mystified to hear that they had lost money, since
nowhere in their checking accounts or tax records is there any
evidence of such losses.
   The tendency to view housing solely as an investment, and to
measure its value by the month and year rather than by the decade,
is reflective more of a Wall Street trader's mentality than that of
a homeowner.
   Traders constantly price their portfolios, homeowners do not.
Traders live day to day, homeowners live for long-term goals.
Traders can do little to improve the value of their shares,
homeowners constantly make improvements.
   Moreover, homeowners are constantly paying down the mortgage,
obtaining tax benefits and enjoying the kind of physical protection
for one's head that no stock, bond or other security can provide.
   After examining the claims of housing doomsayers, Harvard
University's Joint Center for Housing Studies, an impartial
assessor, offered this reassurance:
   ``Contrary to popular reports about the impending home price
crash, today's homeowners have little reason to worry.'' They
backed it with statistics showing that except for brief periods,
housing keeps pace with the economy.
   ``While it may be necessary to ride out a short-term down cycle,
over time home prices tend to rise at or above the general rate of
inflation, making housing a solid investment and key component in
the financial security of the current and future generations of
elderly Americans.''
   They offered the hypothetical example of a household that in
1974 bought a typical single-family home in Boston for $89,144
(1989 dollars).
   Assuming the buyers had a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage and sill
owned the home in 1989, the paydown of the mortgage principal and
appreciation in prices would have boosted equity in the home by
$140,192.
   At that price they would have had an inflation-adjusted compound
annual growth rate of 15.1 percent.
   Had they purchased the house in 1980, paying a higher price but
enjoying greater inflation during the 1980s, real equity would have
grown at 24.6 percent annually.
   And even if the house had been purchased in 1986, when the
explosive Boston market was near its peak, the homeowner would have
realized equity gains of 16.9 percent in each of the following
three years.
   Let the doomsayers shout, let them denounce housing as an
investment, let them try to frighten you with predictions of doom.
Safe in your own home, you can ride out the storm, knowing better
times lie ahead.

<TEXT>
   European countries preparing for a U.N. conference
on global warming have forged a consensus on the need for action,
breaking with the go-slow policy of the United States.
   The U.S. policy, however, may threaten the outcome of the 10-day
Second World Climate Conference, which begins Monday in Geneva.
   Optimists had hoped it would set an agenda for hard negotiations
on details of a climate convention. Now it seems the United States
will block any move to set targets for reducing emissions of carbon
dioxide, a key ``greenhouse'' gas.
   Global warming from the ``greenhouse effect'' occurs when carbon
dioxide, methane and other pollutants build up in the atmosphere,
trapping the sun's heat like a greenhouse.
   Of 100 nations attending the conference, only Egypt,
oil-producer Saudi Arabia and perhaps the Soviet Union, which fears
the economic consequences of a treaty, are likely to support the
U.S. position.
   In April, at a global warming conference in Washington,
Environment Minister Hans Topfer of West Germany disputed President
Bush's claim that more research was needed ``to sort out the
science.''
   Speaking for near
Chrysalis House, a residential substance abuse program in Maryland.
   ``The first is you're an addict. The second strike is you're a
female. If a female addict happens to be pregnant, in the eyes of
most of the country, you're at the bottom of the heap.''
   In fact, some prosecutors, citing concerns for the children,
have charged pregnant drug users with crimes, sometimes jailing
them.
   Since 1987, more than 50 criminal cases have been filed against
women for drug abuse during pregnancy, about 80 percent of them
minorities, the American Civil Liberties Union says.
   Civil libertarians argue that this drives addicts away from
prenatal care.
   ``Prosecutors are telling them to get clean or be arrested and
they'll take away their kids,'' said the ACLU's Isabelle Pinzler.
``There aren't the places for drug treatment and the places that
exist frequently won't take them.''
   ``It forces them to make a Sophie's choice - either getting
healthy or abandoning the child in foster care or a dysfunctional
family from which they themselves came,'' said her colleague, Lynn
Paltrow.
   More than 5 million women of childbearing age use illegal drugs,
including more than 1 million who take cocaine, the National
Institute on Drug Abuse said in 1988. Up to 375,000 babies may be
exposed to drugs annually, according to the National Association
for Perinatal Addiction Research and Education.
   While those numbers indicate the scope of a problem exacerbated
by the crack epidemic, others suggest glaring inadequacies in
treatment. Consider:
   -Some 280,000 pregnant women nationwide needed drug treatment,
yet less than 30,000 received care, according to a 1990 survey by
the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors.
   -Two-thirds of 18 big-city hospitals surveyed last year by a
U.S. House committee had no place to send pregnant women for drug
treatment.
   -A New York study found 54 percent of treatment programs
excluded expectant women; 87 percent rejected pregnant Medicaid
recipients addicted to crack.
   ``They think there will be a terrible malpractice problem,''
because of potential pregnancy complications, speculates Dr. Wendy
Chavkin, the author and an associate professor at the Columbia
School of Public Health.
   All of this is especially frustrating, experts say, because
pregnancy often motivates women to seek help.
   ``If they don't find a program out there, chances are we've lost
them,'' Mrs. Hudicek said. ``Some die. Some end up in hospital
emergency rooms giving birth to crack-addicted babies.''
   ``Part of the American way is motherhood and apple pie,'' she
added. ``The stigma that women face ... admitting they're addicted
to drugs is incredible.''
   Cynthia, a Chrysalis House resident and new mother, knows the
feeling.
   ``You already have low self-esteem,'' said the recovering
cocaine-heroin addict, who asked that her last name not be used.
``Finally you do humble yourself to say ... `I have a problem,' and
there's a bunch of excuses. ... They say, `We can't help you now.
Come back in 30 days.' You may die, you may get incarcerated.''
   Or you may get sick. Cocaine, doctors say, increases the risk of
premature delivery and life-threatening hemorrhages and can cause
physical and neurological damage to babies.
   Pregnant addicts often ignore their health. One Michigan woman
said it was easier to walk four houses to buy crack than take a bus
four miles for prenatal care. Others sell furniture, food stamps,
even themselves for drugs.
   About 180 addicts are in Hutzel's 21-year-old program; about
half are pregnant and 50 percent of those women take methadone to
prevent miscarriages.
   Hutzel provides counseling, child care, lunch, transportation
and prenatal care. The residential recovery program houses women
and their young children in a former convent.
   Many have long histories of addiction. Wanda Kaigler, now 37,
says her drug use began at age 16. She nearly died six years ago
from bad heroin, and though she survived and even quit once, her
habit has stripped her bare.
   ``It makes you lose your friends, your family, your furniture,
your home, your respect for yourself,'' she said. ``You feel
terrible afterwards. As long as you do it, you feel good.''
   A widow for three years, Miss Kaigler also lost her six
children, ages 2 to 17, when they were removed by authorities. She
wants them back, proudly noting two are honors students.
   ``I love my kids,'' she said. ``They don't think so. Sometimes,
I don't think so.''
   Kelly Barrington's concern for her baby, coupled with the threat
of losing her 9-year-old daughter, led her to Hutzel.
   ``God knew the only way I was going to stop is if I got
pregnant,'' said Miss Barrington, a drug abuser for 15 of her 31
years who switched to crack from heroin after her veins collapsed.
``I couldn't live with the fact that I hurt an innocent baby.''
   She, too, had hit bottom. She was jailed briefly, lost
everything and was so desperate she'd drag her daughter to dope
houses, explaining she was sick and ``that was the medicine I
needed.''
   Her daughter responded by repeatedly breaking her crack pipes.
   ``I try to forgive myself and say I was a sick person,'' said
Miss Barrington, her purse adorned with badges for every month she
has been drug-free. ``I feel great that God gave me another chance
to turn things around.''

   Eighty percent to 85 percent of the women complete Hutzel's
pregnancy program, which serves about 250 females a year. About a
quarter continue in recovery, but more than half of those who
inquire never show up.
   Some fear prosecutions will deter even more.
   A Massachusetts judge this month threw out an indictment
charging a 24-year-old mother with drug distribution for cocaine
found in her infant son.
   ``By imposing criminal sanctions, a woman may turn away from
seeking prenatal care for fear of being discovered, thereby
undermining the state's asserted interests,'' Boston Superior Court
Judge Suzanne V. DelVecchio said in her ruling.
   But some prosecutors say they must help the children - even if
means charging and jailing pregnant women.
   ``Innocent children are horribly damaged by the use of cocaine.
If that's not child abuse, I don't know what is,'' said Charles
Condon, a South Carolina solicitor who helps run a program in which
pregnant users must enroll in treatment or risk arrest.
   ``We don't want them to be prosecuted,'' he said, but ``you
really have to give them consequences for their behavior.''
   At Hutzel, Wanda Kaigler knows all about consequences. But she
plans to stay clean and dreams of living with her kids ``away from
drugs.''
   ``Anything you have faith in and believe in,'' she said, ``you
can have.''

   When Traci Jackson gave birth to a stillborn child, Texas
authorities say, she had with her a deadly weapon. It wasn't a gun
or a knife, but cocaine - in her body.
   That's what Houston prosecutors will argue when the 20-year-old
woman faces trial Nov. 12 on a cocaine possession charge that could
send her to prison for up to 20 years.
   The trial is among more than 50 cases in 20 states and the
District of Columbia in which pregnant drug abusers have been
charged with crimes ranging from child abuse or neglect to drug
delivery, homicide and assault with a deadly weapon.
   In Alaska, a woman pleaded no contest in 1989 to criminally
negligent homicide in the death of her 2-week-old son, which was
tied to maternal cocaine use before birth.
   In Florida, a woman was convicted last year of delivering drugs
through the umbilical cord and sentenced to 15 years probation. And
in Kentucky, a 33-year-old mother addicted to drugs and pills for
half her life was sentenced this spring to five years in prison for
child abuse.
   These actions ``are all illegal extensions of the state statutes
by prosecutors who want to get their names in the paper,'' argues
Lynn Paltrow, an ACLU attorney in New York.
   Some courts, too, have been troubled by this approach. A Boston
judge this month dismissed a drug charge against a woman whose baby
was born with cocaine in its system.
   ``There is no familiar bond more intimate and more fundamental
than that between the mother and the fetus she carries in her
woman,'' Judge Suzanne DelVecchio wrote. ``This court will not
permit the destruction of this relationship by the prosecution.''
   But prosecutors say the threat of legal action is a strong
incentive to seek treatment and an appropriate way to protect
children.
   ``It's about time we notified those who would use cocaine while
pregnant that they'd better stop it,'' said Casey O'Brien, a
Houston prosecutor in the Jackson case. ``It's just not fair to
others. It's not fair to their children. It's not fair to society
that ... (takes on the responsibility) for their children who
survive or are damaged irreparably by cocaine.''
   In the Houston case, the state claims Miss Jackson - her
attorney says her real name is Beverly Amos - entered a bathroom in
an apartment and shortly thereafter gave birth to a stillborn baby,
later found inside a plastic bag in a closet.
   The government says Miss Jackson used crack that day; an autopsy
found the baby had large quantities of cocaine in its liver.
Prosecutors say DNA testing provides circumstantial evidence she
was the infant's mother.
   Defense attorney Alex Bunin doesn't acknowledge the woman had a
child and says the charge violates equal protection. ``A man cannot
be prosecuted for that crime,'' he said.
   Bunin also says the state is unfairly attempting to punish the
woman twice - for possession and for the use of cocaine as a deadly
weapon.
   O'Brien said prosecutors don't have to prove the deadly weapon
kills, only that the manner in which it was used was capable of
causing serious bodily injury or death.
   ``The baby never had a chance,'' O'Brien said. ``The cocaine
killed it in the womb. Whether it killed it legally or practically,
the result is the same.''

   The cost of America's failure to ensure that
pregnant women receive proper care can be calculated in the
millions of dollars. But it also can be measured in the tortured
body of an infant born too soon and too small, as Mitchell
Landsberg finds in the last of a three-part series, ``Surviving
Year One.''

   Eric could almost fit in his father's hand,
if his father were there to hold him. He is so small, so weak, so
sick - a little boy pushed into the world far before his time.
   He is kept alive by machines. Machines make Eric breathe, and
machines keep Eric warm. Machines feed him and machines record his
heartbeat, his pulse rate, his temperature.
   He lives in a sterile glass crib, surrounded by banks of
blinking lights, tangled in a webbing of tubes and splints and
bandages. His eyes and his mouth open and shut, and he writhes
gently. For all the machinery, it is human suffering that contorts
his face and a human will that keeps his tiny heart beating.
   It shouldn't have been this way. Eric was born six months into
his mother's pregnancy, without benefit of meaningful prenatal care
or decent nutrition, and most likely with the damaging effects of
drugs.
   Now Eric, like his sister before him, is in the neonatal
intensive care unit at the Children's Hospital of New Jersey. Here,
in the corroded core of one of America's poorest cities, doctors
and nurses struggle daily to save babies who enter life too soon,
too sick and too small.
   ``This is so typical,'' says social worker Debbie Beacher, who
has just finished listening to Eric's mother recite her story of
drug abuse and homelessness. ``An unwed mother, young, a drug
abuser, has a baby born prematurely that ends up in this unit.''
   It is like this around the nation, in cities big and small, in
places like the Hospital for Sick Children in Washington, D.C., and
Valley Children's Hospital in Fresno, Calif.
   ``We're seeing a growing need for our kind of hospital in just
the past few years,'' said Dr. Edna Leung, a pediatrician at the
Hospital for Sick Children. ``It's sad. We enjoy what we do ... but
we just wish we could make some of these problems go away.''
   The problems won't go away, and their legacy is children like
Eric. Society pays, and the costs are enormous.
   It costs about $600 to administer prenatal care to a woman
during the nine months of a normal pregnancy. Drug treatment for a
crack addict costs about $5,000.
   Without prenatal care, without drug treatment, the risks of a
woman delivering a premature, low birthweight child increase
dramatically. And so do the costs.
   It costs an average of about $25,000 to treat a low birthweight
infant - one under 5.5 pounds. For extremely low birthweight
babies, under 1.65 pounds, the average is more than $100,000.
That's an average. Some cost far more.
   Once, the point would have been moot - such tiny babies would
have died at birth. But medicine has made tremendous strides in
saving them.
   Between 1980 and 1987, the infant mortality rate in the United
States dropped by about 20 percent. During the same period, the
percentage of infants born to mothers who had no early prenatal
care scarcely changed, and the percentage of low birthweight
infants actually increased.
   Since birthweight is the single most important indicator of
infant health, the meaning is clear: Children are being born sicker
than ever, and medicine is using superior technology to keep them
alive.
   In Fresno, Dr. Nadarasa Visveshwara has been treating a baby
that weighed exactly 1 pound at birth. The child's mother, who is
on Medicaid, had received very little prenatal care.
   The baby is now six months old. The medical bills have topped
$750,000 and probably will be around $1 million by the time the
child is released from the hospital.
   The prospects for the child ever enjoying a productive life,
Visveshwara said, ``are very poor.''
   Does he ever ask, is it wise to save such children?
   ``Almost all the time,'' he said, ``because we hesitate to
produce an infant who will be a burden to the parents and to
society, and who won't be able to lead a productive life. ... But
the baby always gets the benefit of the doubt.''
   Eric, whose real name is being kept confidential, weighed
slightly more than 2 pounds at birth. In 1960, his odds of
surviving infancy would have been about one in 10. Today, they are
better than 50-50.
   His medical bills are around $100,000 and climbing, and his
parents have no ability to pay. His birth was costly, but not in
financial terms alone. There is an incalculable cost in pain and
suffering, in emotional distress and social disruption.
   These are statistics for extremely low birthweight infants,
those somewhat smaller than Eric:
   -90 percent will suffer respiratory problems.
   -70 percent will have brain hemorrhages.
   -80 percent will have heart problems.
   -50 percent will have liver problems.
   -5 percent to 10 percent will be blind.
   -2 percent to 3 percent will die of Sudden Infant Death
Syndrome.
   Of those who survive, 40 percent will be mildly handicapped, 40
percent will be severely handicapped and 20 percent will be normal.
   There's more. Premature infants are much more likely than other
children to have cerebral palsy. They are much more likely to have
learning disabilities later in life. And children who spend their
infancy in a hospital will have difficulty bonding with their
families, a trait also widely attributed to children exposed to
drugs in the womb. The longterm emotional costs are yet unknown.
   ``There's just not that closeness, and these kids have more
difficulty when we get them home,'' said Dr. John H. Niles Jr.,
president of the Medical Society of the District of Columbia.
``They're just not the joy that a baby should be.''
   ``It's like a Vietnam kind of thing,'' Niles added. ``These kids
have been in a battle, and there are going to be some scars. And
society is going to pay for those scars.''
   The easiest way to avoid the scars, most people believe, is to
make prenatal care widely available and do whatever it takes to get
women to take advantage of it.
   The most commonly repeated statistic about prenatal care is that
every $1 spent on it will save $3.30 in future medical costs.
   Dr. Shyan Sun, director of neonatology at the Children's
Hospital of New Jersey, is a skeptic. He shuffles through a file
drawer to pull out a list of everything his patients have going
against them. They are poor, they are young, they are unmarried,
uneducated; they abuse drugs, they drink, they smoke.
   ``One cannot naively believe that prenatal care alone will solve
the problem,'' Sun insisted. ``I am not optimistic that we will
make a difference in the near future. We still have to take care of
all these social problems.''

   It is a daunting prospect, as Eric and his mother illustrate.
Eric's mother, who asked that she be called Jane, is 25 years old.
She was born prematurely herself, and says her mother, her brothers
and sisters all were born prematurely too. She is a small woman,
with sharp features and a dull stare. Eric is her fifth child - all
have been born prematurely and small.
   ``My 2-year-old, he came home on a heart monitor, so I dealt
with that,'' she says matter-of-factly. ``And my 6 year-old, when
he came home he was having seizures. ... My oldest one, he was the
biggest of everybody. He was 4 pounds, 13 ounces.''
   Jane was living in a homeless shelter during her pregnancy says she
tried to get prenatal care, but the doctor ``had
an attitude'' and lectured her about eating corn chipwith
Eric. She s. She didn't
go back.
   She insists she stopped doing drugs before her pregnancy; her
social worker says that's a lie. Since Eric was born, the hospital
has had to ask the police to pick up Jane every time it needs her
consent to perform surgery.
   ``I hate to come here,'' Jane says. ``It gets depressing, seeing
all those babies like that. God forbid I get attached to him and he
dies, then I've got a real emotional problem there. I'm not saying
I don't love him, ly home and
help build a motel and other facilities to accommodate the tourist
trade that is beginning to develop around the bandleader's former
residence.
   Many rural communities where farms have been consolidated over
the years, causing a loss of economic base, are looking to the
government for help to develop other businesses.
   About half the money in the bill, $27.6 billion, goes to feeding
programs, including $19 billion for food stamps and $2.5 billion
for the Women, Infant and Children program.
   Food donations, the special milk program and child nutrition
programs also are covered by the bill.
   The bill appropriates $5 billion for farm subsidies this year
and continues the crop insurance program, which had been stripped
from the original House bill.
   ``Since 1980, the (crop insurance) program has lost over $2.6
billion in indemnity payments,'' said Rep. Jamie Whitten, D-Miss.,
chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. ``The
administration in the past 10 years increased over $2 billion, an
increase of over 450 percent''
   But, at the urging of the Senate, Whitten agreed to allow the
program to continue if it is at least 75 percent actuarially sound
and if USDA's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service
takes control over policy sales and loss adjustments.
   The ASCS had controlled the program until 1980, when it was
expanded to allow private insurance companies to issue policies to
farmers. The practice became costly because the private companies
were reimbursed by the government for administrative expenses and
operating losses.
   Specific agencies and their appropriations are:
   - Farmers Home Administration, $11.5 billion
   - Rural Electrification Administration, $334.6 million.
   - Soil Conservation Service, $771.3 million.
   - Agriculture Stabilization and Conservation Service, $1.5
billion.
   - International programs, including food giveaways, $1.1
billion.
   - FDA, $824 million.

   Cattle being fed for the slaughter market as
of Oct. 1 in the seven major beef states totaled 7.68 million head,
up 10 percent from a year ago and 4 percent more than two years
ago, according to the Agriculture Department.
   Marketings of ``fed'' cattle in September totaled 1.45 million
head, down 8 percent from a year ago and 14 percent fewer than two
years ago, USDA said Monday.
   The placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last
month was reported at 2.21 million head, up 13 percent from a year
ago and slightly above the same month in 1988, the report said.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven
states, which account for about three-fourths of the nation's beef.
The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as of Oct.
1, and the second number is the percentage of a year earlier.

   Two House Agriculture subcommittee chairmen
are opposing a Chicago Board of Trade plan to double the number of
grain and soybean futures contracts available to speculators.
   Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., said Monday that such changes should
not be made until the effects of the 1990 farm bill are known.
   The bill, which establishes new planting options as part of
government budget cutting, will dramatically change the commodities
market, said Glickman, chairman of the wheat, soybeans and feed
grains subcommittee.
   He and Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., whose subcommittee oversees
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, have asked the CFTC to
withhold approval of the Chicago Board of Trade plan until next
year.
   The farm bill has been approved by a House-Senate conference
committee, but awaits final votes in both chambers and the
president's signature.
   In a letter to CFTC Chairman Wendy Gramm, the chairmen said the
Chicago Board of Trade plan appears to be response to pressure from
big commodity trading fund managers.
   The funds ``have little interest in the price discovery or
legitimate hedging functions of these markets and view them simply
as another speculative venture to market to their customers,'' the
lawmakers wrote.
   ``We do not believe the commission should approve the proposal
until its proponents can verify with certainty that it will enhance
the performance of these markets and allay fears that it will
simply subject grain producers, marketers, and users to
unnecessary, damaging price fluctuations,'' they added.

   Joseph Kelly Crockett snuggled next to his
mother, too young to do much of anything except eat, sleep and cry.
Too young to know that he is starting life a step behind most other
babies.
   Despite city-wide efforts to improve health care services and
lower Indianapolis' sky-high infant mortality rate, Joseph's mother
struggled to get caseworkers at the Marion County Welfare
Department to extend Medicaid to her fourth child.
   ``They don't care, or they don't want to care,'' said Lisa
Carter, 24. ``It's too much of a headache for them. It's almost as
if you're asking them for $20 out of their pocket.''
   Joseph was born prematurely; he was delivered at 36 weeks by
emergency Caesarian, and weighed 5 pounds. And it took seven weeks
before Joseph was added to the welfare rolls, before he could
receive Medicaid, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, food
stamps.
   In the interim, the pediatrician and hospital didn't press for
payment, but Miss Carter had to pay for his food and transportation
to the doctor herself.
   Joseph's father tried to help, but judging from the support he
gave Lisa during her pregnancy, she knows she couldn't count on
him.
   Nor could she count on the welfare department. The conscientious
caseworker who handled her file for two years recently quit. With
her departure returned the threats that the family's Medicaid and
Aid to Families With Dependent Children would be cut off because of
improper paperwork.
   But then, Miss Carter says her Medicaid coverage has been taken
away twice -both times unjustly, she believes.
   Miss Carter was 5 when her mother was murdered, but she overcame
that to become an A student in school.
   At 16, her first child, Taron Smith, was born, but she overcame
that to graduate from high school.
   Two years later, she was working toward an associate's degree in
secretarial sciences when her grandmother became ill. She quit
school to care for her and never returned.
   At 19, her daughter Shenika was born, weighing just 4 pounds, 12
ounces. Miss Carter had become a single, teen-age mother with two
young children, and she couldn't find a way out.
   ``I'm not stupid, but I have had plenty of tragic situations in
my life,'' she said. ``But I can't use that as a crutch.''
   In Indiana, a family of four must be living below 32.7 percent
of the federal poverty level, bringing in less than $385 a month,
to be eligible for Medicaid and AFDC. Only Alabama, Arkansas,
Louisiana, New Mexico, North Carolina, Texas and West Virginia have
stricter standards.
   For pregnant women and children under 6 years old, the picture
is brighter because of federal mandates.
   In April, Congress required all states to provide Medicaid
coverage to pregnant women and young children with family incomes
below 133 percent of the federal poverty level, $1,972 per month
for a family of four.
   Miss Carter feeds, clothes and shelters her family on child
support she receives from the children's fathers and on her $405 in
monthly AFDC payments, the state's maximum payment for a family of
five. Thirty-six states have higher payments.
   Even a part-time job at minumum wage would boost her income
above the state's limits. She and her oldest child would be
ineligible for Medicaid and the whole family would lose its AFDC
and food stamps.
   Still, Miss Carter has goals. She's looking for a job that pays
enough to take care of her four children. She wants to return to
school.
   ``My situation is not something that's good for my baby or my
other three babies,'' she said. ``I want to help myself, but I need
support. And I don't have any.''

   The world's wealthiest nation has a monumental
infant mortality rate. Behind that wretched statistic are 40,000
tragedies - the number of American children under the age of 1 who
die each year, many victimized by their mothers' poverty, ignorance
or drug use. In the first of a three-part series, ``Surviving Year
One,'' National Writer Lisa Levitt Ryckman visits Indianapolis -
once the city where a newborn was least likely to reach its first
birthday, now a town that is fighting back.

   Carol Sanders' baby was born in an infant
mortality disaster area, a neighborhood where community health
workers measure success in newborn ounces and weeks in the womb.
   In this urban death zone, Tyrone Lamont Payton survives with a
vengeance.
   He arrived in triumph two days shy of his due date, a strapping
8 pounds, 14 ounces. Nineteen-year-old Carol's fourth child, he was
the first who wasn't born too soon and too small.
   More babies die each year in Carol Sanders' impoverished
neighborhood than any other in Indianapolis. Until recently, black
babies died at a higher rate in Indianapolis than any big city in
America. And more babies die in America than any other Western
industrialized nation.
   Babies born in Hungary or Poland had a better chance of
celebrating their first birthdays than any baby Carol Sanders
carried.
   Enter Wafiyyah Harrison, a mountain of a woman with enough
compassion, wit and strength of purpose to wring a little happiness
from the hopelessness in the violent inner-city neighborhood
nicknamed ``Little Detroit.''
   Harrison helped Sanders help herself, and the result was the
vigorous good health of Tyrone Lamont Payton.
   ``I tell them, `You've got to meet me halfway. It comes down to,
do you want a healthy baby or do you not?' '' said Harrison, one of
four community health workers with the Maternity Outreach Mobile
Project care coordination team. ``If you're below the poverty line,
you cannot afford to have a special-needs baby. So you need to do
what it is you need to do.''
   Across the nation, health workers haunt inner-city housing
projects and rural shacks, staging a frontal assault on the forces
that feed infant mortality statistics. The savings in lives and
money recently persuaded the General Accounting Office to recommend
that Congress fund home-visiting through Medicaid.
   ``Myself, I didn't have the best life coming up,'' Sanders said,
hugging her youngest daughter against a swollen belly just before
Tyrone's birth. ``But I'm going to give them the best that I can.''
   Not all women who need help having healthy babies are as ready
to cooperate as Sanders; a hand offered is not always accepted, the
outreach workers have been dismayed to learn.
   Carol Sanders' sister was five months pregnant with her second
child and already in pre-term labor when Harrison began visiting.
Unhappy about her pregnancy, the 18-year-old ignored most of the
health worker's advice about rest and diet. The result was 2-pound,
5-ounce Antonette, born at 28 weeks and lingering in the hospital
intensive care nursery weeks after her full-term cousin had gone
home with his mother.
   ``There's one group that all we need to do is get them hooked up
with prenatal care, improve their nutrition, teach them basic
parenting,'' MOM Project Director Joanne Martin said. ``But there's
another reservoir of people for whom that's not enough. They have a
lot of problems in their lives, and being pregnant is only one of
them. For that group, we need to be more creative and not throw up
our hands in despair.''
   Despair runs deep in Indianapolis' inner-city neighborhoods,
where toddlers play in dirt shiny with broken glass and houses sag
and rot behind boarded windows. In the worst of these areas, where
the Sanders sisters live, 37 of every 1,000 babies die before age
1.
   But city officials were unaware of the deaths in the shadows of
their new downtown skyscrapers and sports facilities until the fact
was splashed across the front pages of local papers.
   The news was bleak. In 1986 and 1987, more black infants died in
Indianapolis than any other major city in America, at a rate of
more than 23 per thousand. Stunned city leaders hastily did their
own calculations. There was no mistake.
   ``It's a shock when you see these headlines and wonder who's not
doing their job,'' said Dave Arland, spokesman for Mayor William
Hudnut. ``But it's been a situation of not addressing it, not
addressing it, not addressing it over the years, and then we wind
up at the top of the heap.''
   A city-county commission that studied the problem discovered a
horribly overburdened health care system. Clinics didn't exist in
the neighborhoods with the highest infant death rates, and a woman
could wait weeks for an appointment at existing facilities. And the
seemingly simple task of riding a bus to the hospital or clinic was
arduous and time-consuming.
   Indianapolis' problems are endemic to big-city - and rural -
America, and are reflected by the dismal U.S. infant mortality
rate.
   Improvement in the rate stalled in 1985 for the first time in 20
years. That same year, there were increases in the number of babies
born with a low birthweight and born prematurely, under 5{ pounds
and before 37 weeks gestation.
   Low birthweight babies are 40 times more likely to die during
the first month of life. A very low birthweight baby like
Antonette, who weighs less than 3\ pounds, is 200 times more likely
to die in her first month of life than her normal weight cousin,
Tyrone.
   About 40,000 babies younger than 12 months die annually in the
United States, two-thirds of those in the first 28 days of life.
Two black infants die for every white one, the worst racial
disparity in 50 years.
   Health officials say infant death hits the black community
disproportionately because black women and their babies suffer more
from the ravages of poverty: lack of education, inadequate prenatal
care, lower maternal age, a high number of previous and unwanted
births, poor nutrition, smoking and substance abuse.
   Alter those factors and save lives, said the National Commission
to Prevent Infant Mortality, which called in 1988 for universal
access to health care for pregnant women and their infants as a
crucial first step.
   ``There is an answer,'' said commission Executive Director Rae
Grad, adding that half of all U.S. infant deaths are preventable.
``It's basic, boring, straightforward. It's feeding women, making
sure they have health care. Making sure their babies have health
care. This isn't glamorous stuff that makes the cover of Time
magazine. But it works. It saves money. And it saves lives.''

   Indianapolis officials reached the same conclusion. Since then,
four new clinics have opened in the city. A computer netork helps
track patients when they move from one clinic to another. A motor
coach equipped with a state-of-the-art ultrasound machine, part of
the March of Dimes-funded MOM Project, travels to different county
clinic sites to serve those patients.
   This fall, four care-coordination teams are fanning out across
the city. The black infant mortality rate is falling; the rate for
1988, the most recent year available, is 20.3 per 1,000, down from
23.7 in 1987.
   So far, the MOM Project team has taken 270 referrals and opened
183 cases. Sixty-eight babies have been born, only five of them
under 5{ pounds, a low birthweight rate half that of the area they
serve.
   The infant mortality commission estimates that every
low-birthweight birth the workers avert represents an instant
savings of $14,000 to $30,000. At most, the team has only to
prevent 14 such births to equal its own annual operating costs.
   The four MOM Project health workers try to spend at least eight
hours a week doing outreach, haunting Medicaid lines and welfare
offices, jumping out of cars to talk to women on city streets.
``Are you pregnant?'' they ask. ``Do you know anyone who is?''
   That's how Harrison found Tracy Kersey, 17 and already the
mother of one, who settled her bulk uncomfortably in a chair and
proudly announced she no longer smokes. Harrison's support made it
possible.
   ``You feel like it's somebody there for you when you don't have
nobody there,'' Kersey said. ``She's someone you can talk to when
you're down and have troubles.''
   Food and housing are scarce, but trouble is something these
women have in abundance. Among the project's client list are an
anorexic chain-smoker in hiding from an abusive partner, a
13-year-old girl with an alcoholic mother, and a woman who boasted
of getting drunk every weekend during her pregnancy. Now her fetal
alcohol syndrome baby is on their rounds, too.
   ``Being a mother yourself, you feel all mothers want the best
for their babies,'' MOM outreach worker Claudia Thompson said.
``Then you'll run into situations where you begin to wonder, `Now,
are they concerned at all about this child?' But I understand it,
because they've got all these other problems.''
   The MOM Project workers deal in basics first, assessing each
woman's health and educating about nutrition, pre-term labor and
other problems. They provide referrals for food, housing, Medicaid
and WIC, the federal supplemental food program that provides free
food, nutrition education, prenatal care and counseling to mothers
and children. Visits continue until the baby turns 1.
   Less than half of women and children entitled to Medicaid and
WIC are actually enrolled in the programs in the United States;
many women don't realize they are eligible. Some simply don't know
what resources are available, and they make no effort to find out,
the health workers say.
   ``A lot of these people are in denial. They deny they have five
or six babies and are on welfare. I look at pregnant women who
don't want to do anything for themselves as people who are in
denial,'' Harrison said.
   ``Until you accept that you have a problem, there's nothing I
can do. And that's the way I look at it. You have to accept you
have a problem, whether it's poverty, no food, pregnancy.
   ``Then there's always something we can do.''

   Reed Tuckson remembers his mother, the nurse, donning her hat
and climbing into a little blue car to visit poor families in their
homes and teach other mothers how to plan their pregnancies and
care for their babies.
   By the time Tuckson became Washington, D.C., health commissioner
decades later, the system that had supported visiting nurses like
his mother had collapsed under budget constraints and desperate
nursing shortages. In 1989, Tuckson had just eight community health
nurses for the entire city.
   Such nurses remain in short supply, but home visitation programs
using lay workers have begun to proliferate as government officials
recognize the health benefits and cost-effectiveness.
   Basic prenatal care can cost as little as $500; the lifetime
costs of caring for a low-birthweight baby can hit $500,000.
   About 4,500 home visiting programs exist nationwide, although
fewer than one-third address the problems of pregnant women and
their babies.
   At least 10 European countries, all of which have lower infant
mortality rates than the United States, use home visiting to some
extent, and some programs are universal. Virtually every British
and Danish newborn is seen by a home visitor who is a nurse or
midwife.
   American programs, which date back 100 years, usually target
disadvantaged families, and home visitors are likely to be women
from the community who have overcome the same problems their
clients face.
   ``In many home visiting programs, it's not uncommon to find
households with no plumbing, no cooking facilities, households
overrun by vermin, substantial family dysfunction with drug use and
violence. Many families lack the basics for survival,'' said Dr.
David Olds, who began a home-visiting program in 1978 in Elmira,
N.Y.
   Olds' program tracked babies until they were 2, and found that
they were heavier at birth and less likely to be abused or
neglected. Four years later, the home-visited mothers had more
months of employment and fewer subsequent pregnancies and were more
likely to have postponed the birth of a second child.
   In Norfolk, Va., the Resource Mothers Program targets pregnant
teen-agers by linking them with trained community workers who help
them get prenatal care and educate them about health during
pregnancy. Since the program began in 1985, the low birthweight
rate for home-visited teen mothers has dropped to 6 percent,
compared with 9.4 percent for teen-agers nationwide.
   The General Accounting Office in July recommended that Congress
extend Medicaid coverage to home visitation programs, although it
also recommended more research to determine exactly which kinds of
programs work best. Congress recently approved but failed to fund a
network of home healthcare workers.

   Women who might otherwise never see a
doctor are being drawn into prenatal care by coupon books good for
pickles, college courses and lotteries that pay cash for seeking
medical treatment early in pregnancy.
   South Carolina's coupon program, called ``Caring for Tomorrow's
Children,'' is one of a number of such giveaways nationwide aimed
at reducing low birthweight and infant mortality.
   Free coupon books like South Carolina's are offered in Chicago
and Washington, D.C., and several states and health plans are in
the process of organizing their own, including Blue Cross of
California, the Hawaii Medical Service Association, New Hampshire,
New Jersey and the New York cities of Rochester and Syracuse.
   In Pawtucket, R.I., Memorial Hospital and two other health
centers that make up the Blackstone Valley Perinatal Network run a
Healthy Baby Lottery, funded by the March of Dimes. It awards six
monthly prizes from $25 to $100 for women who seek prenatal care in
their first 12 weeks of pregnancy, plus a $50 bonus for women who
come in before their 10th week. Every six months, a $500 drawing is
held for women who complete their doctor's recommended prenatal
care.
   In the six months before the lottery began in February, 73
percent of the women who came to the centers had delayed prenatal
care until their second trimester. Since the lottery began,
however, that figure has dropped to less than 59 percent, said
network director Noreen Mattis.
   Mattis said Broward County, Fla., has begun its own lottery
based on the Rhode Island program, and other states have expressed
interest.
   ``If we prevent one low birthweight baby, or one handicapped
child, which I think it is likely to do, then I think it's worth
it,'' said Dr. Larry Culpepper of Memorial's department of family
medicine.
   Coupons in South Carolina's book, worth more than $550, include
free pickles, a ride on a Medicaid van to a prenatal check-up, and
a free personal interest course at a state technical college. The
400-page book also provides women with health tips and a guide
through the social service maze.
   To encourage women to get medical attention, each coupon in
their book must be stamped by a doctor before it can be redeemed.
About 44 percent of pregnant women in South Carolina received
inadequate prenatal care in 1988.
   In 1987, South Carolina had a higher percentage of low
birthweight babies - those weighing less than 5{ pounds - than all
other states except Louisiana and Mississippi.
   The state's infant mortality rate was among the nation's lowest,
12.2 per 1,000 lives births in 1988, compared with a national
average of 9.9.
   Catherine Bagnal, high-risk maternity coordinator at a Columbia
clinic, said many young pregnant woman have the attitude, ```My
mother had 13 children and she stayed at home and she didn't go to
the doctor. Why do I need to go?' And that was kind of hard to come
up against.''

   Crude oil prices plunged a record $5.41 a barrel
in heavy trading on a combination of Middle East peace hopes,
technical trading factors and a report of an apparition appearing

   Monday's drop in the November contract for light, sweet crude
oil to $28.38 per barrel marked the biggest single-day drop since
futures contracts began trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange

   But the sudden erosion of the so-called ``war premium'' may not

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Resolution Trust Corp., faced with a
limited pool of outside talent to help clean up the savings and
loan mess, has bent its ethics rules to do business with some
companies.
   The RTC, the federal agency responsible for disposing of
hundreds of collapsed S&amp;Ls, is signing on about 1,000 new
contractors a week and could soon rival the Defense Department as a
lucrative source of government contracts.
   At the same time, there is a limited number of outside
companies, such as accounting firms, with the expertise the RTC
needs. Because the $500 billion savings and loan scandal is so
far-reaching, many of the companies with the know-how needed to
resolve it have been touched by it in some way.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp. has joined the move
toward ``open'' computer standards, planning an announcment for
later this week about modifications to its flagship line.
   The world's second-largest computer maker plans will announce
Thursday that it is changing its VAX computers so they can run
software designed for the popular Unix operating system.
   That means companies equipped with both VAX and Unix-based
computers could run the same software on all, saving the cost of
buying or writing a second version of the software.
   Analysts said Digital was pushed into the change by a slumping
market for its proprietary machines, which cannot easily be
connected with computers made by other companies or operate
software designed for those machines.
   An operating system is the base layer of software than controls
a computer's internal housekeeping functions. Applications
software, such as word processing programs, provide specific
functions for the computers and run on top of an operating system.
   Digital said it will release a new version of its VAX operating
system next year that will adhere to an open-system standard called
Posix. Posix, in turn, is compatible with Unix.
   Digital also said it intends to have the operating system
certified by an international group called X-Open Ltd., which
promotes open-system computing.
   Analysts said Digital, based in Maynard, Mass., needs to make
its VAX computer line more attractive.
   ``There is clearly a slowdown in orders for VAX,'' said Jay
Stevens, who follows the computer industry for Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc.
   Part of that sluggishness is due to the desire for open systems,
but it also is due to a delay by customers in ordering new Digital
computers while they await promised new models, analysts said.
   One such model, also to be announced Thursday, is a new top-end
version of the VAX 6000 midrange computer line. The VAX 6000 model
500 will offer 85 percent more processing power than the current
top-end 6000, but only cost 18 percent more, said Stephen
Blanchette, the line's marketing manager.
   Digital officials admit the move to open systems is driven by
the marketplace.
   ``It is apparent that open-systems computing is the way of the
future and Digital intends to address that market,'' said Phil
Auberg, marketing manager for the VAX software line.
   While Digital's move is important for a company that has
relentlessly promoted a proprietary computer line, it isn't unique.
NCR Corp. made perhaps the most dramatic move into open systems of
any old-line computer maker with an announcement last month that it
will replace the company's entire product range with open-system
machines.
   Digital also will announce Thursday that it will phase into the
VAX line over the next two to three years a more powerful processor
based on reduced-instruction set computing, or RISC, Auberg said.
   RISC technology speeds up computers by reducing the number of
instructions they must complete to perform a task. RISC chips are
used in speedy computer workstations, including those made by
Digital, that offer performance approaching levels of the largest
mainframes at a fraction of the price.
   The VAX announcements follow Digital's unveiling last week of a
computer system aimed at small and midsize businesses. The
computers, based on industry-standard Intel Corp. microprocessors,
have been praised by analysts as a strong move into a market where
Digital has not put much effort in recent years.
   Digital hopes the flurry of announcements will give a kick to
sales, which have suffered in the past few quarters.
   Last week, Digital reported both revenue and profit fell in the
quarter ended Sept. 30 compared with the same period last year.
Digital earned $26.2 million, down sharply from $150.8 million a
year earlier, while revenue slipped to $3.09 billion, from $3.13
billion.
   But the results were a vast improvement over the second quarter,
when it reported a loss of $256 million, its first ever.
   The red ink resulted from a $400 million charge to pay for a
major scaleback that included the elimination of thousands of jobs
and plant consolidations to contend with the computer industry
slowdown.

   Here is a summary of the major provisions of
the clean air legislation approved by House and Senate negotiators.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Urban Smog</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   -Smog-causing pollution would have to be cut by 15 percent
within six years and 3 percent annually after that until federal
air quality standards are met. About 100 cities would have to
achieve federal standards within five to 15 years, depending on the
severity of the problem. The Los Angeles area would be given 20
years.
   -Factories and businesses would have to install new
pollution-control equipment to cut smog-causing emissions. Large
factories and small polluters such as dry cleaners, gas stations
and paint refinishers would be affected in cities with significant
smog.
   -New pollution control requirements would be established for
offshore oil rigs, although rigs off the Gulf Coast would be
exempt.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Motor Vehicles</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   -Automobilettailpipe emissions would have to be reduced by 30
percent to 60 percent by 1998. On-board canisters would be required
to capture fuel vapors. A second round of tailpipe controls would
be required if the Environmental Protection Agency considers them
necessary after 2003.
   -Alternative-fuel vehicles would have to be phased in for taxi
and other fleets and a pilot program would be created in California
to introduce up to 300,000 alternative-fuel cars for private use by
1999.
   -The bill would require the sale of cleaner gasoline blends in
nine cities with the worst smog problems. Compliance likely would
come through ethanol blends or other ``reformulated'' gasoline. The
cities are Los Angeles, Houston, New York, Milwaukee, Baltimore,
Philadelphia, Hartford, Conn., San Diego and Chicago.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Toxic Pollution</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   -Factories would have to install ``maximum achievable control
technology'' to reduce the release of 189 toxic chemicals, many of
them carcinogens, by 90 percent by 2000.
   -Additional emission controls may be required by the EPA to
ensure ``an ample margin of safety'' from exposure to
cancer-causing industrial emissions. The EPA would develop an urban
air toxic chemicals program to reduce cancer risks by 75 percent
over five years.
   -Requirements would be established for industry including new
monitoring and response requirements for chemical accidents. Also
would set up a chemical safety board to investigate accidents.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Acid Rain</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   -Electric utilities would be required to reduce annual sulfur
dioxide emissions by 10 million tons in two stages by the year
2000; emissions would be capped after that. Releases of nitrogen
oxides, also a precursor of acid rain, would be cut by 4 million
tons.
   -Utilities would be allowed to buy and sell ``pollution
credits'' to reduce the cost of emission controls at dirty plants.
Utilities that already operate clean plants could use the credits
for emissions in new plants to allow for growth.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Estimated Costs</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   -The White House estimates the measure's cost at $11 billion a
year by 1995 and $22 billion to $25 billion a year by 2005.
   -Industry estimates $35 billion to $50 billion a year by 2005,
when all pollution controls would go into effect.
   -The American Lung Association puts cost benefits from healthier
air at $50 billion a year in reduced health care expenses.
   -The EPA estimates the cost of current pollution controls to the
economy at $32 billion a year.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Jobs</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   -Provides a five-year, $250 million program to help workers who
lose their jobs because of tougher pollution controls. Funds
require worker to be in a retraining program to become eligible.

<HEAD>Unusual Defense Wins Traders More Time, At Least</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two commodity traders who contend trading rules
were broken routinely at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange have won
more time, at least, with their unusual defense against federal
fraud charges.
   Ray Pace's lawyer thinks it will be late spring before Pace and
Sam A. Cali return to court after U.S. District Judge William T.
Hart ruled they should be tried separately from 12 other Japanese
yen futures traders.
   The decision Monday came about six weeks into the yen traders'
trial. Hart did not set a date for the separate trial of Cali and
Pace.
   Hart said evidence presented by Cali and Pace might prejudice
the jury against the other defendants, who have denied breaking
rules.
   All 14 defendants had sought to have Cali and Pace severed from
the trial.
   Cali's lawyer, Thomas Durkin, said he was ``tremendously
encouraged'' by Hart's decision.
   ``I read his opinion as a validation of the defense,'' Durkin
said. ``We intend to vigorously pursue it when we get the
opportunity.''
   Pace's lawyer, Steve Rosenberg, was less enthusiastic. ``I think
the decision is a fair one, but how this all ends up remains to be
seen,'' he said.
   Durkin and Rosenberg suggested in their opening arguments last
month that almost every trader at the Merc violates trading rules
almost daily and that exchange officials are aware of the problem.
   The Merc has denied that its officials knew about or condoned
rule violations.
   Durkin and Rosenberg contend any rule violations their clients
may have committed do not constitute fraud or racketeering, the
crimes with which they are charged.
   Hart denied motions for a mistrial by several defendants who
contended the opening statement already had prejudiced the jury
against them.
   The case resulted from an FBI investigation of corruption at the
Merc and the larger Chicago Board of Trade, the world's two biggest
commodity exchanges.
   The defendants are accused of cheating customers by executing
their orders outside the trading pit or at less-than-optimal
prices.
   A similar trial involving 10 soybean futures traders from the
Chicago Board of Trade is continuing.
   In the first of the three scheduled trials, one Swiss franc
futures trader from the Merc was acquitted and two others were
convicted July 9 of minor trading violations, leaving the jury
deadlocked on fraud and racketeering charges.
   A retrial on the unresolved charges from that trial is to begin
March 5.

<HEAD>Pathe Moves Toward Buyout of MGM-UA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Entertainment Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pathe Communications Corp. has the money it
needs to finish its $1.3 billion buyout of MGM-UA Communications
Co., the studio behind the Oscar-winning ``Rain Man'' and the James
Bond and Rocky films.
   Pathe and MGM-UA announced Monday that the Beverly Hills-based
entertainment conglomerate had delivered the $967 million balance
of the purchase price.
   MGM-UA's board of directors scheduled a meeting for today on a
sale of the historic studio.
   Pathe, headed by Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti, said it
hopes to close the deal by week's end.
   Combined with previous installments totalling $353 million, the
payments fulfill the purchase price of $1.3 billion.
   Of the additional $967 million, Pathe said almost $600 million
was raised through a private placement of stock in the new company.
   Pathe spokesman Craig Parsons said details of the offering would
be revealed in Securities and Exchange Commission filings later
this week. He did not identify the new investors, but said Pathe
would maintain a majority interest in the new company.
   MGM-UA executives declined to comment further on Monday's
announcement. Over the last two years, production at the studio has
slowed to a crawl as MGM-UA has gone through a variety of aborted
takeovers.
   Pathe on Sunday sold English-language television rights for
nearly 1,000 MGM-UA films to Turner Broadcasting System Inc. as
part of a deal under which MGM-UA will help finance its own
purchase.
   That transaction was valued at a reported $200 million.
   The MGM-UA-Pathe deal has been delayed by Parretti's financial
difficulties and an acrimonious split between Pathe and Time Warner
Inc.
   Time Warner was to have contributed $650 million toward the
purchase price in exchange for a lien on the valuable United
Artists film library and extensive distribution rights to Pathe and
UA movies.
   Time Warner dropped out of the deal and sued Pathe for $100
million, claiming Pathe double-sold some distribution rights.
   Ever since Kirk Kerkorian placed MGM-UA on the blocks in April
1988, the sale has been a spectacular odyssey of failed financing,
lawsuits and juicy gossip.
   Kerkorian, who owns 80 percent of the company, has been
approached by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., Australia's Qintex
Entertainment Inc., PolyGram N.V., MCA Inc., Japan's C. Itoh and
Co., Barris Industries Inc., several unidentified foreign investors
and the Walt Disney Co.
   A 1989 deal with Qintex appeared to be one of the most likely to
be completed. But the $1.5 billion transaction fell apart when
Qintex was unable to raise the money.
   Parretti is an elusive figure. The son of an olive merchant, he
made his fortune, he says, by buying, restructuring and selling
troubled European companies. He has predicted that one day he will
preside over ``the biggest film group in the world.''
   Parretti bought the financially strapped Cannon Group movie
studio, purveyors of exploitation titles like ``River of Death,''
in 1988 for $200 million.

<HEAD>Canadian Union Near Agreement with Chrysler; Bode Well for UAW?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor analysts say a move by Chrysler Corp.
toward a contract with the Canadian Auto Workers may bode well for
talks with the United Auto Workers union in the United States.
   Canadian union President Bob White on Monday received a new
economic proposal from Chrysler Canada Ltd. and called it ``a great
relief.''
   ``It's clear that we're not going to have to fight to get a
basic economic agreement,'' he said. ``They've clearly indicated
that they're ready to meet the pattern.''
   White said dozens of issues remained unresolved, but he was
confident a contract could be reached by the midnight Thursday
deadline the union has set.
   The UAW and the Canadian union are pressing Chrysler to accept
pattern agreements reached with General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor
Co.
   UAW workers at Ford plants in the United States ratified by a
4-to-1 vote a new national agreement mirroring the GM-UAW
agreement, the union said Monday. UAW and Ford executives are to
sign the new contract Friday.
   Before the Canadian union received Chrysler Canada's economic
proposal, there had been speculation that bargaining with the
smallest of the Big Three automakers on both sides of the border
would be tough.
   But after White's comments, analysts said that may not be the
case.
   Since the UAW and Chrysler began bargaining in the United States
in mid-July, company officials have said Chrysler faced severe
economic problems. After the UAW pattern agreement was reached,
Chrysler said the deal was too expensive.
   ``It indicates that the negotiations could very well proceed
more smoothly in the United States despite Chrysler's rhetoric to
date,'' said Harley Shaiken, a labor professor at the University of
California in San Diego.
   There was no immediate comment from UAW officials bargaining at
Chrysler headquarters in Highland Park.
   Chrysler spokesman Lee Sechler said Monday he couldn't comment
on the Canadian talks or their significance on talks with the UAW.
   ``It's two separate sets of negotiations,'' he said.
   Despite that, Shaiken and Harry Katz, a labor professor at
Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., said it was likely Chrysler
would accept the pattern agreement with the UAW.
   ``I all along have thought that Chrysler was going to have to
conform to the pattern because the union was not about to give them
a major exception,'' Katz said.
   There are differences between the UAW and the Canadian union
pattern contracts.
   The UAW contract calls for a 3 percent wage increase in the
first year and lump-sum payments of 3 percent in each of the next
two years. The Canadian union contract calls for wage increases of
7.5 percent in the first year, 6.7 percent in the second and 4.8
percent in the third.
   Before wage increases in the new contracts, UAW workers were
getting about $15.70 an hour, including cost-of-living allowances.
Canadian union workers received about $15.50 hourly.
   One of the big differences is health care. The UAW agreement
calls for no change in the system for providing health care to GM
and Ford employees. The Big Three spent about $4.5 billion for
health care last year, $684 million of that by Chrysler.
   A national health-care system in Canada covers much of the
health-care cost for Canadian workers.

<HEAD>Judge Reserves Decision on Pension Obligation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has reserved judgement on
whether the LTV Corp. must reassume liability for more than $2
billion in employee pension plans it stopped funding in 1987.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet of Manhattan heard arguments
Monday on a request by the Federal Pension Guaranty Corp. to make
the Dallas steel, aerospace and energy concern take back
responsibility for the pension plans.
   FPGC general counsel Carol Connor Flowe said Sweet had to shift
liability in light of a recent Supreme Court ruling.
   The high court's June ruling upheld the federal pension agency's
decision to force LTV's Cleveland-based steel unit, LTV Steel
Corp., to reassume pension obligations for three underfunded plans,
which were to provide for more than 60,000 LTV retirees and active
employees.
   ``It's time now to enter judgement and to let the workers and
retirees in these pension funds get their benefits,'' Flowe said.
   But LTV attorney Lewis B. Kaden said the high court had decided
only legal issues and had not taken into account the company's
current financial situation.
   ``The issue that has to be decided is the legality of the order
here today, not three years ago,'' Kaden said.
   He said LTV, which is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization,
would not have assets to fund the pension plans.
   Kaden, however, said Sweet had authority to consider certain
legal issues, among them whether LTV could be compelled to make
contributions into the pension plans and whether plans that had no
assets could be restored.
   ``You can't engage in a futile act,'' he said.
   Flowe claimed LTV was merely arguing positions already rejected
by the Supreme Court.
   The judge indicated that he thought the issues raised by Kaden
could be resolved in bankruptcy court.
   ``I really intuitively adopt Miss Flowe's thought on the changed
circumstance argument that this is not the place for that to be
worked out,'' he told Kaden.
   At a later point, Sweet said, ``The question is how much of this
poison dish am I going to be able to pass on.''
   Lawyers for LTV's various creditors also urged the judge against
returning liability to the company, arguing that the move could
disrupt LTV's attempts to reorganize.
   LTV filed for protection from its creditors in July 1986.
   The litigation stems back to 1987 when LTV stopped funding the
pension plans and the FPGC assumed liability.
   A few months later, a new LTV labor contract with the United
Steelworkers of America restored some retirement benefits similar
to those in the terminated plans.
   The FPGC claimed that the company was taking unfair advantage of
federal funds to cut costs and ordered LTV to reassume liability
for the three terminated plans.
   When LTV challenged the order, FPGC went to court.
   In June 1988, Sweet ruled that the agency improperly ordered LTV
to reassume the plans' operations. A year later, a federal appeals
court agreed that FPGC had exceeded its legal authority.
   But the Supreme Court reversed the lower courts and sided with
the FPGC in its June ruling, which said LTV had to take back
liability for the plans.

<HEAD>News Corp. Boss Says Earnings Will Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rupert Murdoch, chief executive of
News Corp. Ltd., said Tuesday that he expects his debt-laden
international media company will increase earnings this fiscal
year.
   Murdoch told the annual meeting of shareholders that despite
uncertainties in some of the company's major markets, he expects
News Corp. to ``trade on ahead of last year.''
   He did not estimate earnings and would not comment on the
company's short-term debt problems that helped depress News Corp.'s
stock price in recent weeks.
   News Corp.'s short-term debt soared last fiscal year to $2.30
billion from $396 million.
   Total debt rose to $8.21 billion from $6.13 billion.
   News Corp. stock closed Tuesday up about 50 cents to $4.75 in
Australian stock market trading.
   In an interview Monday, Murdoch said his empire will
increasingly concentrate on film and electronic media, rather than
the newspapers and magazines with which he built News Corp.
   Newspapers and magazines now account for about 70 percent of
News Corp. profits.
   His international holdings include interests in the Fox
Television network in the United States and a 51 percent holding in
the Suth China Morning Post in Hong Kong.
   In the last fiscal year ended June 30, News Corp. reported
earnings that earnings dropped 75.5 percent to $267 million,
largely because of losses at Murdoch's Sky-TV satellite
broadcasting business in Britain and a pilots strike at the
half-owned Ansett Australia airline.
   Shareholders approved Tuesday a resolution allowing directors to
issue limited-voting shares. Murdoch wants to be able to issue such
shares so the company can raise funds without diluting his 45
percent stake in the company.
   On Oct. 3, Murdoch merged four of his Australian newspapers into
two around-the-clock productions, a move that reflected
increasingly tough times in the Australian media business.
   The morning Melbourne Sun and afternoon Herald became the
Herald-Sun on Oct. 8, the same day that the Daily Telegraph-Mirror
was formed from the merger of the morning Sydney Daily Telegraph
and the afternoon Mirror.

   The stock market fell in the early going today
as investors continued to siphon off profits.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials declined 17.33 points to
2,498.76 in the first half hour of trading.
   But losing issues barely outpaced gainers in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 485 down, 486 up and
429 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 19.72 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The market opened on a soft note following a mixed performance
in the previous session. Analysts had expected additional selling
as investors took profits following the sharp run-up last week.
   Crude oil prices, which lost more than $5 a barrel on Monday,
were drifing downward, but the decline had minimal impact on
equities even though it signaled an easing of inflationary
pressures.
   Oil prices ``are beginning to fade into the background as a
barometer of market sentiment,'' said Hildegarde Zagorski, a vice
president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``They're beginning
to take on the flavor of another commodity,'' rather than an
indicator of whether there will be a war in the Middle East, she
said.
   A number of negative factors continue to hang over the market,
particularly the lack of a budget resolution in Washington and
lower corporate earnings.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris was down \ at
48\; General Electric was up \ at 54; Pan Am was off &lsqb; at 1{, and
American Express was up \ at 20&lsqb;.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped 0.67 to 170.86. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was at 293.05, up 0.87.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 4.70 to
2,516.09.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 6 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
860 up, 719 down and 422 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 152.65 million
shares, down from 221.48 million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Say Disney Getting $600 Million From Japanese Investors to Make
Movies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Walt Disney Co. is close to arranging a
film-production financing package worth at least $600 million
backed largely by Japanese investors, the Wall Street Journal
reported today.
   The financing would pay for nearly all of Disney's motion
picture output for part of 1991 and at least part of 1992, and
would mark the largest infusion yet of Japanese money into a major
Hollwywood studio short of acquisition, the Journal account said.
   It quoted some industry observers as saying the transaction
would be the largest single such financing in Hollywood history and
that the final figure could be closer to $1 billion.
   The Journal said financing would be backed by two Japanese
banks, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. and Fuji Bank Ltd,
and two U.S. banking companies, Citicorp and Manufacturers Hanover
Corp.
   Officials from Disney and the banks declined to comment on the
Journal account, which apparently was based on industry sources.
   The reported transaction reflects the allure of Hollywood
investments for the Japanese. Sony Corp. bought Columbia Pictures
Entertainment Inc. in 1989 for $5 billion, and MCA Inc. has been
talking with Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. about a possible
acquisition worth as much as $8.6 billion.
   The newspaper said the Japanese financing package for Disney
would replace the Silver Screen limited partnerships that have
financed the company's film-making efforts over the past five years
with more than $1 billion.
   It said Disney and Silver Screen have been far apart in recent
talks about extending their relationship, and that was one reason
that Disney sought alternative financing from Japanese investors.
   Disney has three separate film labels - Disney, Touchstone and
Hollywood Pictures, which plan to produce about 25 films a year.
The average film costs about $25 millin to produce and nearly that
much to promote and distribute.

   The stock market held at lower levels early
today as investors sold off blue-chips issues.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 11.14 points to
2,504.95 in the first hour and a half of trading.
   But the broader market showed more resiliency. Advancing issues
narrowly outpaced losers in nationwide trading of New York Stock
Exchange-listed issues, with 643 up, 588 down and 458 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 45.16 million shares as of 11
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The market opened on a soft note following a mixed performance
in the previous session. Analysts had expected additional selling
as investors took profits following the sharp run-up last week.
   The lack of a resolution to the budget crisis in Washington and
continued reports of lower corporate earnings for the third quarter
and higher interest rates in the credit markets weighed on the
market.
   Crude oil prices, which lost more than $5 a barrel on Monday,
were drifting lower, but the decline had minimal impact on equities
even though it signaled an easing of inflationary pressures.
   Oil prices ``are beginning to fade into the background as a
barometer of market sentiment,'' said Hildegarde Zagorski, a vice
president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``They're beginning
to take on the flavor of another commodity,'' rather than an
indicator of whether there will be a war in the Middle East, she
said.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were slightly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade as the
advancing corn and soybean harvest pressured the markets.
   A weekly Agriculture Department report released late Monday
showed the corn harvest was 47 percent complete and the soybean
harvest 57 percent complete as of Sunday.
   The corn harvest remains far behind the average pace of 58
percent for that date, although soybean producers have nearly
caught up to the norm after planting the crop late due to heavy
spring rains.
   Harvest progress could speed up considerably next week if a
National Weather Service forecast for warm, dry weather in the
Midwest pans out, analysts said.
   In early trading, wheat futures prices were { cent to } cent
lower with the contract for delivery in December at $2.62{ a
bushel; corn was } cent to 1 cent lower with December at $2.29{ a
bushel; oats were \ cent lower across the board with December at
$1.24 a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents to 2\ cents lower with
November at $6.08{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were narrowly mixed while pork futures were
higher in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
following USDA reports Monday that showed more cattle on feedlots
and fewer pork bellies in commercial freezers than traders had
expected.
   Live cattle futures were .15 cent lower to .05 cent higher with
December at 76.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to
.25 cent lower with October at 86.80 cents a pound; live hogs were
unchanged to .52 cent higher with December at 54.27 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were 1.15 cents to 1.28 cents higher with
February at 66.95 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled lower on Monday.

<HEAD>UPS Takes On Federal Express, Guarantees Morning Delivery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Parcel Service has announced it
will match the delivery and pickup times of overnight delivery
competitor Federal Express Corp.
   UPS has pushed back its guaranteed overnight delivery time to
10:30 a.m. and is offering same-day pickup. The company used to
guarantee delivery by noon, and would pick u packages the day
after a customer called.
   Both features have helped Federal Express dominate the $8
billion overnight delivery market and limit UPS's customer reach.
   ``We knew that this is what we needed to compete in this
market,'' said UPS spokesman Alan Caminiti.
   Now, Caminiti said, the Greenwich-based package delivery company
can compete with Federal Express in both service and price.
   ``We think when somebody's making a decision and they look at
all of these factors ... it's going to make the decision for UPS
clear,'' Caminiti said.
   UPS, the world's largest package delivery company, sends more
than 700,000 packages a day by air, both overnight and second-day
delivery, he said.
   Paul Schlesinger, a transportation analyst with Donaldson Lufkin
&amp; Jenrette in New York, said UPS's announcement could take the
competitive edge away from Federal Express.
   ``Federal will either see an erosion in their volume or may have
to do something on price - or both,'' Schlesinger said.
   UPS charges $11 for a same-day, overnight letter pickup to
non-regular customers, Caminiti said. Regular customers who receive
UPS's $4.50-per-week daily pickup service pay $9 for overnight
delivery, and customers who drop off their overnight letters pay
$8.50.
   Federal Express, based in Memphis, Tenn., charges $13 for
drop-off service and a $2.50 surcharge for pickups.
   A Federal Express spokeswoman, Shirlee Finley, downplayed the
threat, saying the announcment was ``another question of them
playing catch-up.''

<HEAD>Oil Prices Mixed in Confused Trading</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices were mixed on the futures market this
morning as uncertain traders tried to figure out which way crude
would move after Monday's record drop.
   ``We're having a little bit of confusion down there today,''
said Thomas Blakeslee, an energy analyst with Pegasus Econometric
Group Inc., in Hoboken N.J. ``They're not exactly sure where they
want to take the market.''
   Light sweet crude oil for December delivery was down 81 cents to
$29.60 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange in early
trading. January and February delivery contracts were also lower,
but later months were higher.
   Today's mixed prices appeared to put at least a temporary halt
to oil's recent rapid decline, which resulted in a record fall of
$5.41 per barrel on Monday. The big drop came as November contracts
were traded for the last time and pushed those contracts to $28.38
at the close.
   December contracts had not fallen that far on Monday because of
trading limits imposed by the exchange, so the spot price of oil
was actually higher this morning.
   The big falls have come as traders determined a peaceful
solution in the Persian Gulf seemed more likely than war. They have
stripped away more than half of the ``war premium'' that sharply
pushed up prices to the $40-per-barrel range in the weeks following
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Refined petroleum products were also moving in different
directions today amid the confused trading.
   Home heating oil was up 3.37 cents to 79.35 cents per gallon on
November contracts. Winter and early spring delivery contracts were
all lower, while late spring and summer contracts were higher.
   Unleaded gasoline was up 4.20 cents to 80.70 cents per gallon on
November contracts. Winter and spring delivery contracts were
trading lower, while contracts for next fall were moving up.
   Earlier today, oil prices had moved up more than $1 per barrel
in London, where European traders said some doubts had arisen about
the market's perception on Monday that a negotiated peaceful
solution was close in the Gulf crisis.
   The London market's rebound appeared to be a combination of a
correction from drop on Monday of more than $5 a barrel and a
reassessment of how likely the Gulf crisis is to be resolved
peacefully.
   ``Prices just went down too fast'' over the past couple of
trading sessions, one London trader said.
   Traders said that comments by Saudi Arabian government
officials, including King Fahd, suggesting that the kingdom hasn't
abandoned its hard-line position against Iraq helped turn the
market around. Oil's big plunge on Monday was largely attributed to
comments from another ranking Saudi official that were seen as an
indication Iraq might be able to keep some Kuwaiti territory in a
negotiated settlement.
   Traders in New York said that despite the later Saudi
statements, it would likely take a renewed threat of war to push
prices up very far.

   Eastman Kodak Co. is bringing its new
photographic compact disc to desktop computer publishing with hopes
the new technology will catch on with those who want to produce
splashy documents with full color pictures and graphics.
   Kodak announced today a line of products and standards that will
tie the CDs to the desktop publishing systems that have mushroomed
in popularity in recent years. The announcement came a month after
Kodak unveiled a system that stores photographs electronically on
CDs and displays them on television screens.
   Kodak said it is teaming with a number of leading computer and
software companies, including International Business Machines
Corp., Apple Computer Inc. and Adobe Systems Inc., to help
popularize the system.
   Kodak also announced a $1,500 color printer to be used to make
paper copies of the photographs and text from IBM and Apple
computers and compatible models.
   ``We see desktop color imaging to be a whole new industry,''
said John P. White, an executive at the Rochester-based company who
is in charge of the new products.
   White said Monday the new desktop publishing system is the
commercial version of the photo CD system announced in September.
In that, amateur photographers would have their film developed and
the images put on CDs by professional photo finishers.
   The photo CD system won't be available until 1992. Kodak
apparently wanted to announce the software and other aspects of the
commercial system in advance to get the computer industry prepared
for the technology, said David Nelson, an analyst at Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Kodak also announced it has developed a standard for how colors
are represented in digital form, or the ones and zeros of computer
language. That is how photos and other data are stored on CDs and
in computer memory. The standard is a mathematical representation
of the colors.
   Establishing a standard is necessary step to ensure that an
electronically stored photograph will have the same colors no
matter what printer is used or on what computer screen it is
displayed, experts say.
   ``It's something that's technical, but having the right colors
is very, very important,'' Nelson said.
   With current technology, color reproduction varies so greatly
from printer to printer that what appears as yellow on one machine
could look more like brown on another, said John Warnock, chairman
and chief executive of Adobe.
   ``This has been a huge problem,'' said Warnock, whose company's
PostScript software established an industry standard for how
printers print out pages of documents.
   By providing a standard for how colors are represented
electronically, Kodak should help lower costs in the electronic use
of color photographs, Nelson said.
   ``And lower cost attracts new products and new software, which
makes color publishing easier to perform,'' he said.
   Kodak said the standard, along with software it will offer
called color management tools, also will ensure that the color
shown on a computer screen will be identical to the one printed out
on a printer. Under today's technology that is not always the case.
   Kodak said its color-standard system is the first such
specification for high-resolution color than spans the computer,
broadcast and print media.
   Digitized color photographs require vast amounts of computer
storage space. By putting this digital data on CDs, which have a
large storage capacity, Kodak says it has eliminated another
roadblock to greater use of color photos in computer software.
   In addition, it says, the photo CD technology provides
higher-resolution images than traditional scanning devices used to
change photographs into computer code.
   Kodak developed the photo CD technology in conjunction with N.V.
Philips, the Dutch electronics giant.
   Kodak estimates the market for desktop color imaging will reach
$5 billion by 1995, including hardware and software products.

<HEAD>Senate in Long-Shot Bid to Override Bush Civil Rights Veto</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Subs 6th graf to say vote not likely today. Also moving on

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate sponsors are launching a long-shot
effort to override President Bush's veto of a major civil rights
bill, which he says would encourage hiring quotas.
   But the bill's House sponsor, Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins,
D-Calif., acknowledged Monday that a new push for civil rights
legislation likely will have to wait until next year.
   ``When the chips are down, the White House is against civil
rights,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said following the veto.
He called the action ``tragic and disgraceful.''
   ``I deeply regret having to take this action,'' Bush said in his
veto message. However, he said the measure would leave employers so
vulnerable to discrimination suits they would hire by quota in
self-defense.
   ``We think we'll win an override vote,'' White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said today. He said he hoped Congress would
consider Bush's alternate civil rights proposal. ``If not, we'll do
it next session,'' he said.
   Senate sponsors were shooting for a vote as early as Wednesday
to override the president's veto and pass the bill over his
objections. The timing of the vote still was uncertain.
   Hawkins said he would not seek a House override vote unless he
was certain it would succeed. ``I'm just not going to waste any
more time,'' he said, noting, ``I've been assured the bill will be
introduced as soon as Congress meets next year.''
   The bill was passed by the Senate, 62-34, and by the House,
273-154 - strong majorities, but not reaching the two-thirds
required to override a veto.
   The measure, the civil rights community's top priority in
Congress, would overturn six job bias decisions handed down by the
Supreme Court last year.
   Provisions range from a ban on racial harassment in the
workplace to punitive damages in the most extreme cases of
discrimination.
   The sharpest clashes, however, have come over provisions that
would make it easier to win discrimination cases against employers.
   Bush said the ``temptation to support a bill - any bill - simply
because its title includes the words `civil rights' is very strong.
   ``But when our efforts, however well-intentioned, result in
quotas, equal opportunity is not advanced but thwarted,'' he said
in his veto message. ``The very commitment to justice and equality
that is offered as the reason why this bill should be signed
requires me to veto it.''
   The president said the ``bill actually employs a maze of highly
legalistic language to introduce the destructive force of quotas
into our nation's employment system.'' Under the measure, he said,
``employers will be driven to adopt quotas in order to avoid
liability.''
   Civil rights supporters scoffed at that argument. ``It's pure
poppycock,'' said Ralph G. Neas, executive director of the
Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. ``The bill has nothing to do
with quotas.''
   ``The president's veto ... and his repeated efforts to pin the
false label of quotas on this legislation are part of a
disreputable tactic to appeal to public resentment and prejudice,''
Neas said.
   Bush called on lawmakers to enact his version of the measure
before they quit for the year, probably later this week. However,
that appeared unlikely, as Bush's critics said his proposal would
weaken current law.
   Civil rights advocates denounced the president's proposal as a
sham for permitting challenged hiring practices to stand if they
could be justified on such grounds as ``customer relations.'' Such
justifications, they said, were used to support the
separate-but-equal ``Jim Crow'' laws of the first half of the 20th
century that kept blacks in segregation.
   The White House plan would cap at $150,000 the total damages an
employee could win in a job discrimination suit. As passed, the
bill would allow unlimited compensatory damages in some cases and
cap punitive damages at $150,000 or the total of compensatory
damages plus back pay, whichever is greater.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said, ``The president's decision is
disturbing and difficult to understand.'' He added that during
negotiations on the measure, ``we often got the impression the
White House staff was looking for excuses not to support this bill,
rather than for ways to achieve a fair bill and a meaningful bill.
Today that impression is all the stronger.''

<HEAD>Italian Auto Giant To Lay Off 70,000 Workers For a Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TURIN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italy's auto giant Fiat, faced with a sales
slump, will lay off 70,000 workers for a week in late November,
twice the number originally planned, the company said Tuesday.
   A spokesman for the Turin-based group said the temporary layoffs
were designed to cut car production by 90,000 units by the end of
1990.
   Auto sales in Italy dropped 7.5 percent in September from a year
earlier.
   But Fiat sources indicated that despite a recent slowdown in the
domestic market, 1990 is expected to be a positive year for Fiat,
with more than 2 million cars produced.
   The layoffs were announced for the plants at Mirafiori, Atese,
Termini Imerese, Chivasso, Pomigliano D'Arco and Cassino.
   The highly automated Cassino plant produces the Tipo and Tempra
models.
   Workers laid off will get about 90 percent of their salaries
through a special state fund.
   Despite the announcement, Fiat shares closed higher on the Milan
market, at 6,609 lire Tuesday from 6,544 the previous day.
   Some brokers speculated that the strength was mostly due to
expectations that a long-expected announcement of a joint venture
or commercial agreement with the U.S. group Chrysler may be coming
soon.

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The only satisfactory outcome of world
trade-liberalizing talks is major cuts in government farm supports,
the official overseeing the crisis-ridden talks said on Tuesday.
   Arthur Dunkel, director general of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, told a German audience that pressures for reform
``are growing from all sides and will not be held back by
fine-tuning current policies or by tinkering at the margins of the
problem.''
   Dunkel urged ``a comprehensive reform program, extended over a
reasonable period of time,'' including cuts in border restrictions
and in domestic supports and export subsidies.
   His speech seemed designed to put pressure on the European
Community, the only major group failing to meet an Oct. 15 deadline
for offering farm support cuts in GATT, and on Germany, which most
strongly opposes concessions.
   Divided European ministers have failed several times to agree on
a proposed common position, and the rift over agriculture supports
is threatening to derail the wide-ranging 4-year-old talks.
Ministers from some 100 nations are scheduled to sign a package
deal cutting trade barriers in 15 areas in early December.
   Dunkel, at a gathering of the Uebersee-Club in Hamburg, appealed
to newly unified Germany to shoulder ``its responsibilities,''
saying its economic power depends on an open world trade system.
   Also Monday, a U.S. negotiator reiterated Washington's stand
that only substantial farm trade reform can save the entire GATT
talks from collapse.
   Deputy Trade Representative Julius Katz said on a satellite
interview program with European journalists that the farm talks are
stalled and ``we have not yet had one serious day of negotiations
on agriculture.''

   Martin Marietta Corp. on Tuesday reported a
25 percent gain in net income for the third quarter, with higher
sales and earnings in every division but one.
   Third-quarter net income totaled $108.8 million, or $2.16 per
share, up from $87.3 million or $1.65 in the same quarter last
year. The per-share earnings reflect a reduction of 2.7 million
outstanding shares as a result of a buyback program.
   Net sales rose 5 percent, from $1.42 billion to $1.49 billion.
   Martin Marietta said each of its operating groups had higher
sales and income except the Electronic and Missiles division, whose
projects include the Copperhead anti-tank projectile program and
the Hellfire anti-armor missile.
   The company also said its quarterly income included one-time
gains on the sale of Florida real estate, as well as a favorable
court ruling involving the 1989 sale of a cement plant. Those gains
amounted to 25 cents per share.
   For the year to date, net income rose 16 percent to $270
million, or $5.33 per share, compared to $233 million and $4.41 per
share last year.
   Net sales for the nine-month period totaled $4.57 billion, up
from $4.17 billion.

   Former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. chief
Frederick Joseph testified against Michael Milken for the first
time today and said a key 1985 investment by the junk-bond
executive may have violated Drexel policies.
   Joseph took the stand as a government witness in Milken's
pre-sentencing hearing on charges that the financier repeatedly
broke the law as head of Drexel's high-yield bond department.
   The testimony focused on the $2.5 billion Drexel-financed
leveraged buyout of Storer Communications Inc. by Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co. in late 1985. Prosecutors claim Milken
misappropriated valuable Storer equity warrants, or rights to
purchase Storer stock, and used them to bribe clients.
   According to the government, five Drexel-affiliated investment
partnerships acquired 82 percent of the Storer warrants without
legally disclosing the interests.
   A large block of preferred stock and warrants was repurchased by
Drexel from a customer, Atlantic Capital, shortly after the Storer
deal was completed. The block was, in turn, sold to one of the
Drexel-formed investment partnerships.
   The partnership consisted of important Drexel clients, money

   Northwest Airlines will cut 28 of its 1,380
daily departures beginning Nov. 1 as part of an effort to offset
the increase in jet fuel prices, the nation's fourth-largest
carrier said Tuesday.
   The airline will eliminate its flight from Memphis to San Diego,
spokesman Bob Gibbons said.
   The rest of the changes will reduce the number of flights
between two locations. Northwest will cut flights from
Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport to Memphis, Chicago's
Midway Airport, Omaha, Neb, Fargo, N.D., and Louisville, Ky.
   The airline will also reduce flights from Detroit Metropolitan
Airport to Milwaukee, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Boston, San Diego,
Seattle, Kalamazoo and Lansing, Mich., and Columbus, Ohio.
   A number of airlines are cutting employees and services to
reduce costs in the wake of increased jet fuel prices.
   Northwest Chairman Alfred Checchi has said there will be layoffs
at the Eagan-based carrier because of the fuel hikes, but no
layoffs have been announced.

   The stock market was mixed today despite losses
among selected blue-chip issues.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had slipped about
20 points in the early going, was down 8.17 to 2,507.92 an hour
before the closing bell.
   The broader market showed significant resilience even while blue
chips were fading. Advancing issues were ahead of losers in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues by
about 7 to 5, with 865 up, 614 down and 455 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 118.24 million shares as of 3
p.m. on Wall Street.
   As expected, the market opened on a soft note. ``You're bound to
get a little profit-taking'' after such a sharp runup, said Alfred
E. Goldman, a vice president with A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St.
Louis.
   ``A day of consolidation is natural after the big jump up last
week,'' he said referring to the 120-point advance in the Dow for
the week ended Friday.
   Crude oil prices, which lost more than $5 a barrel on Monday,
were mixed to lower today, but the decline had limited impact on
equities even though cheaper energy prices signal an easing of
inflationary pressures.
   Oil prices ``are still higher than four months ago,'' Goldman
noted.
   Among actively traded Big Board issues, Citicorp was down { at
12{; Philip Morris was off &rsqb; at 48&lsqb;; General Electric was up } at
54{, and Boeing was down 1 at 47{. Disney, which said it will
receive $600 million in Japanese-backed financing, jumped 1} to
97|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped 0.16 to 171.37. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index stood at 293.38, up 1.15.

   The Quaker Oats Co. on Tuesday reported a 40
percent drop in net income for the first quarter of its fiscal
year, noting the costs of spinning off its Fisher-Price toy
division.
   Quaker's net income for the three months ended Sept. 30 fell to
$33.2 million, or 42 cents a share, compared with $55.7 million, or
70 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Quaker is in the process of spinning Fisher Price off to
shareholders. Fisher-Price accounted for $16.1 million of Quaker's
net income in the first quarter of 1989.
   Excluding fiscal 1989 earnings from the toy company, Quaker's
net income fell about 16 percent. The company blamed the weaker
performance on lower sales in Brazil and increased spending for
international marketing of its Gatorade drink.
   First-quarter sales rose 9 percent to $1.33 billion from $1.21
billion, the Chicago-based company said in a statement.

   Soybean futures prices closed higher Tuesday on
the Chicago Board of Trade in a late, technically inspired rally
that helped boost corn prices. Wheat futures finished narrowly
mixed.
   Soybean futures bounced back after the November contract failed
to penetrate a three-week low of $6.05 a bushel.
   ``The fact that it held there spurred short-covering toward the

   Short-covering occurs when traders buy back contracts that they
previously sold on expectations the market would fall.
   Corn futures drew additional support from indications the Soviet
Union is preparing to buy more foreign grain.
   Analysts said harvest pressure on the corn and soybean markets
is beginning to ease now that the harvest has passed the halfway
point.
   At the close, wheat futures settled 1 cent lower to { cent

<HEAD>Most Japanese Shrug Off Stock Plunge, But Corporate Strains
Surface</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL HIRSH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's economy, dizzied by a $2 trillion loss on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange over nine months, seems to have landed
squarely on its feet.
   By most accounts, consumers have shrugged off the vanished
assets as easy come-easy go.
   A leading think tank's Gross National Product projection for
fiscal 1990 actually was revised upward earlier this month, to 4.8
percent economic growth from 4.6 percent. Retail sales in Septembr
rose from a year ago, with luxury purchases leading the list.
   And Tokyo's notoriously high land prices, the bellwether most
look to for recessionary signs, show little slippage.
   ``The average Japanese family has over 11 million yen (about
$85,000) in the bank,'' said Mark Yim, senior analyst at Baring
Securities. ``They have so much wealth anyway, the decline doesn't
matter that much.''
   However, the selling spree that nearly halved the 225-share
Nikkei Stock Average from a peak of 38,915.87 in December to above
25,000 this fall has put a strain on some corporations, who have
had to cope with big paper losses.
   Most of the market's stock is held by large Japanese
corporations and banks. Businesses with huge cash surpluses had fed
the five-year stock boom preceding the fall.
   But higher interest rates, the primary cause of the slump, and
corporate paper losses is putting a crimp in investment. Some
economic slowdown is expected, although not a recession.
   By early last week, the Nikkei index stood at around 25,300
points following several consecutive gains. Some analysts, however,
have said it could sink as low as 16,000 before the growth
``bubble'' swelled by Japan's liquid wealth finally deflates
completely.
   Whatever the bottom, the slump's suddenness has helped mark
Tokyo's rite of passage from a clubby, protected market designed to
engineer Japan's postwar regrowth to more of a Western-style
financial free-for-all, analysts say.
   One sign has been a fraying of the tight corporate ties and
rigid government control that as recently as a decade ago made
Japan's financial markets nearly impenetrable to foreigners.
   The Tokyo stock market was once considered stable partly because
a majority of stocks were never traded. Corporate shares were
``cross-held'' by large institutional investors such as banks,
whose stocks in turn sat in the permanent accounts of other huge
corporations. All had an unspoken agreement to weather the
volatilities of the market.
   But banks, battered by high interest rates, were forced to sell
corporate stock to maintain income levels. The companies
reciprocated by dumping the bank stock.
   As a result, since the beginning of the year, the share prices
of Japan's top 21 regional banks have fallen by more than 50
percent, according to Paul Heaton, senior research analyst at W. I.
Carr.
   ``It's a case of enough is enough,'' Heaton said. ``You don't
mind holding stock if it falls 15 percent . . . but if other
companies with which you've maintained a business relationship sell
your stock you're going to wonder what's the purpose of holding
theirs, especially in an era when bonds are better.''
   Many such relationships, nurtured in postwar years when capital
was scarce, had become inefficient and unprofitable anyway,
analysts say.
   ``This kind of slump gives banks and large companies a
convenient excuse to really go for globalization,'' said Kuniko
Inoguchi, a political economist at Sophia University. ``Now they
can try what they have had in mind for the last two years or so, to
go beyond the traditional structure of cross-shareholding and
closed business practices.''
   With the growth of Japan into the world's premier banking
nation, ``there's greater opportunity abroad than in traditional
commitments,'' she said. ``And they've discovered they can win the
global competition.''
   Encouraging these changes have been the twin levers of financial
deregulation and foreign participation. Since the mid-1980s, new
instruments such as futures trading in government bonds and stock
indexes, as well as a loosening of notoriously low, uniform
interest rates on some deposits and money funds, have helped pry
oen the black box of Japanese finance.
   The number of foreign members on the exchange has grown to more
than 20 since 1986, when they were first allowed.
   ``The Tokyo stock market has grown transparent,'' said Warwick
Jones, a vice president at Merrill Lynch Japan. ``In the future it
may look a lot more like other markets.''
   Analysts say deregulation, particularly in interest rates, was
largely responsible for the unprecedented price fluctuations seen
during the market slide. The recent drop in U.S. stock prices had
been precipitated by panic selling, spurred by daily reports of the
Persian Gulf crisis or economic worries.
   Higher interest rates tend to make bonds and money market
instruments more attractive, triggering a flight from stocks.
   The rate increases are themselves a symptom of Japan's
continuing economic expansion - now in its fourth year - and the
government's need to tamp down the resulting inflationary
pressures.
   The Bank of Japan has raised its benchmark discount rate, or the
interest charged to member banks, five times since last May to the
current 6 percent. That touched off higher market rates already
aggravated by a worldwide capital shortage stemming from investment
demand in Eastern Europe and the U.S. budget deficit.
   ``It's quite rational,'' said Toshio Suzuki, a top executive at
Nomura Research Institute.
   The Ministry of Finance, traditionally as protective of the
market as a finicky mother hen, plans no further stablization
measures beyond several that produced a record one-day surge Oct.
2, said an official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``What we see at the moment is a gradual stabilization,'' he
said.

<HEAD>UPS Heats Up Competition on Overnight Deliveries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET L. CAPPIELLO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Parcel Service said Tuesday it's moving
head-first into the overnight delivery market, bringing heavy
competition to overnight leader Federal Express Corp.
   UPS, the world's largest package delivery company, announced
this week two services that match Federal Express - guaranteed
10:30 a.m. delivery of overnight packages and same-day pickup.
   With both companies touting their reliability and delivery
expertise, the big difference appears to be price.
   The average shipper pays $11 for UPS to pick up and deliver an
overnight envelope; Federal Express charges $15.50 for the same
service. If a customer drops off the envelope a UPS facility, it
costs $8.50 for overnight delivery; at Federal Express, it's $13.
   The UPS move is aimed directly at those customers who took their
overnight business to Federal Express because it was faster, said
Alan Caminiti, a spokesman for the Greenwich, Conn.-based company.
UPS used to offer delivery by noon and couldn't pick up a package
until the day after a customer called.
   ``We knew that this is what we needed to compete in this
market,'' Caminiti said.
   So far, Federal Express is unfazed.
   ``They're basically playing catch-up,'' said spokeswoman Shirlee
Finley, whose Memphis, Tenn.-based company opened the doors to
overnight delivery in 1979 and added 10:30 a.m. delivery in 1983.
   ``We founded the market and pretty well set the industry
standards,'' she said. ``It's not surprising that once again our
competitors have followed the lead.''
   Federal Express doesn't plan to lower its prices, she said, and
isn't worried about losing customers to UPS.
   But analysts said that might just be wishful thinking.
   ``Federal will either see an erosion in their volume or may have
to do something on price - or both,'' said Paul Schlesinger, a
transportation analyst with Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
   ``Any competition will have some impact on Federal Express'
results,'' said John E. Hilton, an analyst with Argus Research
Corp. ``While at this point the impact is not quantifiable, we do
expect it to crimp Federal Express' earnings growth rate
slightly.''
   Finley said Federal Express, which delivers about 1.5 million
packages a day, commands 40 percent to 50 percent of the $8 billion
overnight delivery market. UPS, which began overnight delivery
service in 1982, delivers about half that number of parcels through
air delivery, Caminiti said.
   Caminiti said UPS has hired hundreds of part-time drivers to
handle the extra load from the 10:30 a.m. deliveries. The company's
shaky contract talks with the Teamster's union in August centered
on the issue of hiring the extra part-time drivers for the new
service, he said.

   GE Transportation Systems of Erie has received
a three-year, $200 million contract from CSX Transportation Inc. to
build 150 locomotives, officials said Tuesday.
   The agreement calls for the delivery of 50 locomotives each year
from 1991 to 1993, said Jerry R. Davis, president of CSX Rail
Transport, the operating arm of CSX Transportation. The order is
for GE's newest 4,000 horsepower, six-axle Dash 8-40C locomotive.
   The new units, expected to haul general merchandise and coal,
will be added to the railroad's fleet of 147 GE Dash 8 locomotives.
CSX Transportation already has the largest fleet of GE locomotives
operating in the United States.
   CSX Transportation provides rail transportation and distribution

   Walt Disney Co. said Tuesday it formed a
film production financing partnership worth at least $600 million,
backed largely by Japanese investors.
   For five years, Disney has limited its filmmaking risk - along
with its potential profits - by raising about $1 billion through
limited partnerships mainly with U.S. investors.
   The last of those, Silver Screen IV, will conclude as planned,
Disney said. Then the new partnership, Touchwood Pacific Partners
I, will become the main source of finance for all live-action films
at Disney's three studios, Disney, Touchstone and Hollywood
Pictures.
   ``The whole film business has been becoming more global,'' said
Disney spokesman Erwin Okun. ``And, frankly, the Japanese provided
better terms.''
   The deal is another example of Hollywood's allure for the
Japanese. Last year, Sony Corp. bought Columbia Pictures
Entertainment Inc. for $3.4 billion and Victor Co. of Japan agreed
to invest $100 million in Largo Entertainment, a film company
headed by former 20th Century Fox President Lawrence Gordon.
   Recently, MCA Inc. has been talking with Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co. about a buyout worth as much as $8.6 billion.
   And just last month, Disney reached an agreement for a unit of
Nomura Securities to provide up to $200 million in financing over
four years for movies made for Disney by Interscope, an independent
production company.
   The latest Disney deal marks the largest infusion yet of
Japanese money into a major Hollywood studio short of acquisition.
   Touchwood Pacific is a U.S. partnership. Its $600 million
financing, however, will be based on $180 million raised from
Japanese investors who buy limited partnerships through an
affiliate of Yamaichi Securities, a leading Japanese securities
firm.
   In addition to that equity, another $420 million will take the
form of a line of credit from a consortium of banks led by
Citicorp's Citibank. Banks involved include The Fuji Bank Ltd., The
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. and Manufacturers Hanover Trust
Co.
   Disney, Touchstone and Hollywood Pictures together plan to
produce about 25 films a year. The average film costs about $25
million to produce and nearly that much to promote and distribute.
   The Wall Street Journal, in a report on the financing Tuesday,
quoted some industry observers as saying the transaction would be
the largest single such financing in Hollywood history and that the
final figure could be closer to $1 billion.

<HEAD>East Europe And Third World Battered By Oil Price Hike From Gulf
Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. official Tuesday proposed a
moratorium on debt ollection from those countries hit hardest by
the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``Prospects for the developing countries as a whole are
worsening because of the slowdown in the growth of industrial
countries' economies, the increase in interest rates and the rise
in the price of oil,'' said Bettino Craxi, the former Italian
premier and U.N. special representative on debt.
   The Gulf conflict, he told the General Assembly's Second
Committee, which deals with economics, ``is likely to produce
increased poverty and environmental degradation.''
   The rise in oil prices caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait will
cripple the weak economies of Eastern Europe and the
non-oil-producing Third World countries, according to a U.N. study.
   Craxi said the oil price hike will cause a stagnating or
negative growth rate for many African countries, and will produce
major new debtors among low-income South Asian nations, which so
far have escaped serious debt problems.
   Eastern European nations will suffer severe balance-of-payment
problems, and foreign aid will be reduced to highly indebted
countries that export oil, such as Mexico and Nigeria.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar appointed Craxi last
December as his special representative on the debt problem, which
is retarding development in almost half the countries of the world.
   ``It is estimated that if prices vary between $30 and $40 a
barrel in 1991, the oil-importing developing countries will be
facing an oil import bill ranging between $45 billion to $60
billion,'' said Rafeeuddin Ahmed, the undersecretary-general for
international economic and social affairs.
   ``For many of these countries, this will be an unbearable
additional burden,'' he said.
   Some developing countries - those that produce oil - will reap
additional billions from the price hikes, Ahmed's report says.
   Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
excluding Iraq and Kuwait, which are under a U.N. economic embargo,
will gain $88 billion in windfall revenues if the price stays at
$30 per barrel. The OPEC winners are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon,
Indonesia, Iran, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United
Arab Emirates and Venezuela.
   Iran alone would gain $9.8 billion in additional revenues.
   Non-OPEC oil-exporting countries would gain $14.6 billion. Those
countries are Angola, Brunei, China, Colombia, Egypt, Malaysia,
Mexico, Oman, Syria, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Yemen, and a
handful of minor exporters.
   The poor Third World countries without oil resources hoped the
oil producers would share some of their wealth, but so far no
formal steps toward that goal have been taken.
   Kuwait's government-in-exile and Egypt, however, are considering
asking the General Assembly to urge wealthy nations to share their
windfall with the impoverished countries.
   Sub-Saharan Africa will be one of the regions ``devastated'' by
the oil price hike, U.N. officials say.
   Consumption of oil in the region is expected to fall by about 30
percent, smashing an economy that is 70 percent dependent on oil
for its productive output.
   The oil cutbacks will cause power stations, factories and mines
to close, slowing growth and further eroding living standards.
   Eastern Europe once depended on cheap oil from the Soviet Union,
but with the breakup of the Eastern Bloc, the Soviets now sell
their oil at market prices, even to their former client states.
   U.S. President George Bush has said he will push the World Bank
to arrange loans worth $5 billion to assist Eastern Europe.
   But several nations there have already appealed to the Security
Council's sanctions committee for relief, citing cumulative losses
that nerly equal that amount.
   Most Latin American nations, already burdened by a crushing
foreign debt, will also see their economies staggered by the oil
price shock. Among the South American countries with significant
extra costs are Brazil and Chile.

   In a break with the dogged optimism of the
American Bankers Association convention, Comptroller of the
Currency Robert L. Clarke Tuesday chastised the industry fr
bringing upon itself a decline in public confidence.
   Clarke, the nation's top bank regulator, told the ABA the
industry's reputation is at its lowest level in 50 years.
   ``Bankers don't have a reservoir of public goodwill from which
to draw,'' Clarke said. ``This is a harsh assessment ... but this
is not a time to be kidding ourselves.''
   The ABA meeting is taking place as the industry grapples with a
slumping economy, anxiety over loan losses and political fallout
from the savings and loan crisis. But banking leaders have
maintained that the industry overall is strong and able to
withstand the current downslide.
   Clarke suggested the industry will have further difficulties if
it does not shore up its standing with the general public and
legislators.
   ``Your public image is likely to determine the outcome of
legislative debates next year on the future of banking,'' he said.
   Clarke said many bankers have lost sight of basics such as sound
lending practices, diversification of risks and long-term vision.
   ``Recent experience has again brought home the lesson that there
is no substitute for following the fundamentals,'' Clarke said.
``But, as banking's current reputation proves, profound damage
occurs from the failure to follow it.''
   Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman, who
followed Clarke on the ABA agenda, gave the convention a somewhat
more hopeful view.
   But Seidman told reporters later he agreed with Clarke.
   ``I think everything Mr. Clarke said was true,'' Seidman said.
``I cannot erase from my mind President Carter's `malaise' speech.
The question to me is whether too much emphasis on the down side
doesn't tend to depress us all. But I don't disagree with anything
he said.''
   In his speech, Seidman said the federal deposit insurance fund
is capable now of covering any forseeable bank losses and remaining
solvent.
   But further erosion of the economy could change that, he said.
   ``Your bank insurance fund is under stress and unfortunately I
cannot report that any improvement is likely in the near future,''
said Seidman, who is in the final year of his term as FDIC
chairman.
   ``You may think that we at the FDIC have the most pressing
interest in seeing the insurance fund remain sound, but that's not
true. It is you, the good bankers who will pay if we can't succeed
in dealing with our losses,'' Seidman said.
   The Bush administration has predicted that bank failures will
reduce the FDIC's commercial bank fund by more than $6 billion over
the next three years.
   Clarke said banking is at a crucial crossroads, and is dealing
from a position of weakness.
   He said there are those in Washington who feel there is nothing
sacred about banking and would not hesitate to let the industry
fall by the wayside.
   That element, Clarke said, argues that with the exception of
federal deposit insurance, other financial institutions now offer
every service that once was the exclusive province of banking.
   To maintain the existing banking system, he said, the industry
needs a combination of legislation making it more competitive and
regulations that provide less opportunity for banks to get into
trouble.

<HEAD>General Cinema To Scale Back Operations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Cinema Corp., one of the nation's largest
movie theater chains, announced plans Tuesday to scale back its
operations.
   The company will sell or close about 20 theaters, consolidate
several field offices and eliminate 85 jobs, a company official
said.
   General Cinema estimates the theater division will lose $11
million in the fiscal year ending Oct. 31, said Peter Farwell, vice
president for corporate relations.
   ``Our goal with this program is to return it to profitability by
1991,'' Farwell said. He said no decision has been made as to which
theaters will be sold or closed, but most would be in the South.
   General Cinema operates 1,498 movie screens at 313 locations in
32 states. Its payroll includes 2,500 full-time employees,
including 200 at its headquarters in the Boston suburb of Chestnut
Hill.
   General Cinema also owns 60 percent of The Neiman Marcus Group,
whose specialty retail holdings include the Neiman Marcus and
Bergdorf Goodman department stores, as well as Contempo Casuals.
Restructuring in the theater division will not affect those
operations, company officials said.
   Earlier this month, General Cinema sold its investment in
Cadbury Schweppes, resulting in an after-tax gain of more than $80
million, or $1.10 per share, in its fourth quarter.
   With the restructuring and the sale of the Cadbury Schweppes
shares, General Cinema expects to report net fourth-quarter
earnings of more than $50 million, or about 70 cents per share.
   For the fourth quarter of fiscal 1989, General Cinema had
earnings of $7.9 million, or 10 cents per share.

<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonnell Douglas Corp. reported a
third-quarter profit of $248 million or $6.46 a share on Tuesday,
with nearly all of it due to a one-time $234 million gain from a
pension-fund change.
   The company also reversed all of its earnings on the C-17
transport aircraft program, which resulted in a one-time charge of
$93 million to cover the elimination of previously reported
earnings dating back to 1985.
   McDonnell Douglas, the nation's largest defense contractor, now
estimates it won't make any money on the $6 billion C-17 project,
which is scheduled for a first flight in June of next year and
completion in 1994.
   ``Backing out the unusual items, these earnings were
surprisingly stronger than expected,'' said Howard Rubel, a stock
analyst for C.J. Lawrence in New York. ``The C-17 is a
disappointment, but hopefully this is a clear-the-decks approach
and let's go from here.''
   The big gain involving the pension fund came after McDonnell
Douglas executives decided to dissolve the company's plan covering
14,000 retired salaried employees and replace it with an annuity
sold by Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.
   Without the two unusual items, the company would have reported a
profit of $72 million, or $1.87 a share, in the quarter. In last
year's third quarter, McDonnell Douglas had a profit of $38
million, or 98 cents a share.
   Sales in the quarter were $4.17 billion, up 12 percent from
$3.70 billion for the same period a year ago.
   McDonnell Douglas, headquartered in St. Louis, makes aircraft
for the Air Force, the Navy and the Marines, as well as missiles
and space systems. The company is also the second-biggest maker of
commercial aircraft.
   ``There was continued improvement in the operation of all of our
businesses,'' said John McDonnell, chairman and chief executive
officer. ``For most of them, the third quarter was better than the
second and the second was better than the first. And our results to
date this year are far better than last year.''
   All of the company's businesses had improved profits during the
quarter ended Sept. 30, except the transport aircraft division
based in Long Beach, Calif., which is still racking up losses.
   Last year, the transport division underwent a major
reorganization, but still ended up with a loss of $222 million for
the year. In the most recent quarter, the transport segment had a
loss of $98 million.
   For the first nine months, McDonnell Douglas had a profit of
$307 million, or $8.00 a share, compared with $159 million, or
$4.16 a share, for the same period in 1989.
   Sales were $12.12 billion vs. $10.29 billion for the same period
last year.

<HEAD>Bank Seeks to Force Polly Peck Into Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bank has moved to force the troubled British
congomerate Polly Peck International PLC into bankruptcy
proceedings, the bankruptcy court said Tuesday.
   The National Bank of Canada filed a petition with the London
court on Monday against the food and electronics conglomerate,
which has been suffering a severe liquidity freeze, the court said.
   The petition effectively asked the court to place the company in
receivership so that its assets can be liquidated to meet debt
payments.
   A hearing was scheduled for Dec. 12.
   Bankers speculated that the National Bank of Canada's move was
designed to set out its claims against Polly Peck in the event of a
rush by creditors. The hearing falls more than a month after a
debt-payment standstill agreement between Polly Peck and its key
lenders expires Nov. 9.
   A Polly Peck spokesman declined to comment on the filing, and
officials at National Bank of Canada's London branch office weren't
immediately available to comment.
   Polly Peck needs about 100 million pounds, the equivalent of
$194 million, in short-term financing to get it through its
liquidity squeeze, sources have said.
   Asil Nadir, Polly Peck's chairman and chief executive, has been
visiting Turkey and northern Cyprus in search of financial support.
   Polly Peck's troubles began Sept. 20 when it suspended trading
in its shares on London's Stock Exchange after the collapse of its
stock price.
   The collapse followed news of a British fraud office raid of a
company associated with Nadir. British press reports have said the
office is investigating allegations of a share support scheme in
Polly Peck stock.

<HEAD>Texas Company Seeking Permission For Iraqi Oil</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coastal Corp. has received
permission from the U.S. government to import as much as 2.6
million barrels of Iraqi crude oil.
   But the company must obtain permission from the Saudi Arabian
government to bring the light-grade oil to Corpus Christi, said
company spokesman Jim Bailey.
   The Saudi government opposes the release of the oil, worth about
$75 million, and is hesitant to make exceptions to the United
Nations embargo, which prohibits trade with Iraq and Kuwait, Bailey
said Monday.
   Coastal claims it should be allowed to purchase the oil because
it was exported from Iraq to Saudi Arabia through a pipeline in
July, before Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   The company must reach an agreement with the Saudis by the end
of the month because the Treasury Department permit requires the
oil to be delivered to the United States by Dec. 15 and oil
shipments from the Middle East take about 45 days to reach the Gulf
Coast.
   The company would pay for the oil through an escrow account that
would allow access by the U.S. government but not the Iraqis,
Bailey said.
   ``None of (the money) would go to the Iraqis,'' he said. ``It is
in the best interest of the United States because we could use the
crude.''
   The light crude would allow his company to make fuel for the
military, Bailey said.
   ``It is really in the best interest of Saudi Arabia as well,''
he added.
   The U.S. Customs Service seized a shipload of Iraqi crude at the
Port of Corpus Christi only two days after the Aug. 2 invasion. The
479,000 barrels were to be refined at Coastal's refinery here.
   Customs officials released the oil the next day after
determining it was bought before the embargo was implemented.
   Britain has granted Coastal a waiver to import the oil because
Coastal's trading subsidiary is headquartered in Bermuda, a British
colony, Bailey said.

<HEAD>Third-Quarter Earnings Up for Northern Telecom</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northern Telecom reported an increase in
third-quarter net earnings Tuesday and predicted continued strong
growth for the rest of 1990.
   The telecommunications company said net earnings rose to $97.7
million in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared to $80.1 million in
the 1989 period. Earnings per share rose to 38 cents, up 23 percent
from 31 cents in the same period last year.
   Third-quarter revenues increased 14 percent to $1.62 billion vs.
$1.41 billion reported for the same three months of 1989.
   Northern Telecom Inc. is the Nashville-based U.S. subsidiary of
Northern Telecom Limited, which is headquartered in Toronto.
   The company said revenues from all geographic areas increased in
both the quarter and first nine months, with international revenues
continuing to lead in year-over-year percentage gains.
   Central office switching remained Northern Telecom's most
profitable product line, and revenues from transmission products
showed the largest percentage increase overall.
   ``The strong results for the third quarter and first nine months
lead us to remain optimistic that 1990 will be a year of record
performance for Northern Telecom,'' said Paul G. Stern, company
chairman, president and chief executive officer.
   Net earnings for the first nine months were $272.5 million or
$1.05 per share, up from $208 million or 80 cents per share in the
1989 period.
   Revenues for the first nine months were $4.89 billion, up 13
percent from $4.32 billion last year.
   Northern Telecom sells digital telecommunications systems and
provides products and services to telephone operating companies and
other institutions. It has more than 49,000 employees worldwide.

   The stock market lost ground Tuesday after
struggling to hold onto spotty gains for most of the session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 22.03 points to
close at 2,494.06.
   Advancing issues narrowly outnumbered losers by about 7 to 6 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
821 up, 695 down and 455 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 146.30 million
shares, down from 152.65 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 177.02 million shares.
   As expected, the market opened on a soft note as traders
continued to take selective profits following the 122-point runup
in the Dow late last week. The key index flirted with postive
territory before taking a decisive move lower in the final half
hour of trading.
   Continued haggling over the federal budget continued to weigh on
the market. Shortly before the market closed, New Mexico Sen. Pete
Domenici, the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, said that
an ``understanding'' on a deficit-reduction package appeared lost.
   Other lawmakers also commented that much remains to be resolved
on the tax portion of the bill.
   Without a budget agreement, the Federal Reserve is unlikely to
lower interest rates. The stock market generally benefits when the
Fed eases credit because costs for businesses are reduced.
   Separately, investors were uninspired by a further decline in
the price of crude oil. The December contract for light, sweet
crude lost more than $1 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, settling at $29.37.
   But analysts said that since the Middle East crisis remains
unresolved, market players are keenly aware that prices could spike
higher at a moment's notice.
   Among investors, there is a ``recalcitrance, a tentativeness
because they just want to feel more comfortable that we've gotten
some of these problems behind us,'' said Hugh Johnson, a senior
vice president at First Albany Corp.
   He said that ``any move upward in (stock) prices will be very
labored as long as these problems are not resolved.''
   Among atively traded Big Board issues, Citicorp was down &rsqb; at
12| a day after the banking concern had difficulty selling an issue
of preferred stock. Also in the financial sector, C&amp;S Sovran
plummeted 2&rsqb; to 16\; an investment firm downgraded the stock and
lowered its earnings estimates for the concern.
   Elsewhere, Philip Morris was down { at 48; Bristol-Myers Squibb
was off &lsqb; at 62|; MCA was up 1| at 58~, and IBM was down 1 at 106}.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $10.99 billion, or 0.38
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.03 to 170.50.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index lost 2.70 to 367.19, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index closed at 312.36, down 2.40.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market lost
0.03 to 341.09. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 292.97, up 0.74.

   General Dynamics Corp. and Westinghouse Electric

design and manufacture magnets for the superconducting super
collider.
   Roy F. Schwitters, director of the Super Collider Laboratory,
said the General Dynamics' Space Systems Division in San Diego,
Calif., has been chosen as the leader for the project.
   Also chosen was Westinghouse's Collider Dipole Division of
Orlando, Fla., Schwitters said in a statement released Tuesday.
   General Dynamics will produce prototype magnets for test and
evaluation. Each firm will then produce 35 preproduction magnets,
which the Super Collider Laboratory will start testing and
evaluating in 1993.
   Both companies will later produce 251 magnets each to be
installed in the super collider's particle accelerator.
   The firms will then compete for a production order for the
remaining 8,200 superconducting magnets, each of which will be
about 52 feet long and weigh about 25,000 pounds.
   The magnets will guide beams of high energy protons around the
accelerator's rings at the speed of light and bring them into
collisions where detectors will record the results, enabling
scientists to learn more about the nature of energy and matter.
   The super collider is to be built 30 miles south of Dallas.

   Oil prices stabilized Tuesday after a record
drop the day before took futures prices below $30 per barrel.
   Light sweet crude for December delivery settled at $29.37 per
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, down $1.04 from the
previous day's December bid.
   But that price was about $1 higher than the mark set by the
expired November contract, which plummeted a record $5.41 to $28.38
on its last day of trading Monday.
   December contracts did not fall as far as November on Monday
because of daily limits imposed by the exchange on contracts beyond
the near month. The December contract was pressured lower Tuesday
to narrow that gap, butanalysts were not sure whether to
characterize the move as an increase or a decrease.
   ``It's tricky,'' said Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst
with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ``Stabilization is the best
word.''
   January and February crude contracts fell along with December,
but later contract months were higher.
   ``We're having a little bit of confusion,'' said Thomas
Blakeslee, an energy analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc.,
in Hoboken, N.J. ``They're not exactly sure where they want to take
the market.''
   Those following crude prices said the market was definitely
viewing peace in the Persian Gulf as more likely than war.
   Crude's record fall Monday occurred as traders responded to news
of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein having a dream in which a prophet
told him his rockets were pointed in the wrong direction. Prices
also had fallen on statements from a ranking Saudi official that
were construed as indicating Iraq might be able to keep some
Kuwaiti territory in a negotiated settlement to the crisis.
   Refined petroleum products recovered some ground from Monday's
plunge, moving higher for next month delivery, with later months
mixed.
   Home heating oil was 5.08 cents higher at 81.06 cents per gallon
for November delivery. Contracts for subsequent months were mixed.
   Unleaded gasoline was 3.40 cents higher at 79.90 cents per
gallon for November delivery, with later months trading mostly
lower.
   Natural gas prices were higher Tuesday, rising 1.5 cents to
$2.52 per 1,000 cubic feet for December delivery. Other contract
months moved up as well.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar traded mostly higher against other
major currencies Tuesday, rising most strongly against the Japanese
yen after the Federal Reserve sold yen to buy dollars, traders
said.
   Gold prices rose. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold
climbed $1.60 to close at $371.20 an ounce. Later, Republic
National Bank in New York quoted gold at $371.25 an ounce, up
$1.75, at 4 p.m. EDT.
   Traders said the Fed sold an undetermined amount of yen for
dollars, apparently at the request of a customer such as another
central bank. Traders said the sale was not believed to be an
attempt by the Fed to affect the value of the dollar against the
yen.
   However, Greg Scarola, a trader with PaineWebber International
Ltd., said the sale apparently contributed to the dollar's strong
showing against the Japanese currency.
   But John McCarthy, chief currency dealer for Amsterdam Rotterdam
Bank in New York, said the dollar had firmed against the yen in
overseas trading before the New York market opened, and the Fed's
purchase of dollars with yen might have had little effect on the
market.
   To boost the value of the dollar the Fed often buys the currency
with other currencies in order to decrease the amount of dollars in
circulation.
   The dollar rose against several other major currencies as well.
McCarthy said the dollar managed to shrug off what otherwise might
have been bad news for the currency, including growing signs of a
peaceful resolution to the Iraqi standoff. He said the dollar was
boosted by technical factors.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 127.13 Japanese yen from
126.25 yen Monday. Later, in London, it rose to 127.45 yen. In New
York, the dollar settled at 128.15 yen, up from 126.02 late Monday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.9461 from $1.9495 late
Monday. In New York, one pound cost $1.9435, cheaper than $1.9455
late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late quotes
Monday, included: 1.5180 German marks, down from 1.5182; 1.2817
Swiss francs, down from 1.2835; 5.0820 French francs, up from
5.0815; 1,137.25 Italian lire, up from 1,137.00; and 1.1721
Canadian dollars, down from 1.17605.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday:
1.5175 German marks, up from 1.5135; 1.2810 Swiss francs, up from
1.2800; 5.0700 French francs, up from 5.0662; 1.7098 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.7060; 1,136.50 Italian lire, up from 1,134.25;
1.1708 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1725.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $371.75 troy ounce,
up from $367.75 bid late Monday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing
bid of $371.40, from $369.00 late Monday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, it
was up 23 cents to $371.59.
   Silver bullion settled at $4.219 a troy ounce on the Comex, up
from $4.194 late Monday. Earlier, silver rose in London to a late
bid price of $4.24 a troy ounce, from $4.21.

<TEXT>
   RJR Nabisco Inc. reported improved third-quarter
results Tuesday showing reduced losses following the food and
tobacco conglomerate's $25 billion leveraged buyout.
   RJR Nabisco recorded a loss of $86 million, down 81 percent from
a $447 million loss in the same period a year earlier.
   The company said its operating income rose 56 percent to $706
million from $452 million in the third quarter of 1989, while its
revenue rose to $3.53 billion from nearly $3 billion the previous
year.
   The firm also reported its cash flow - the key figure for
companies paying down high debt levels - at $886 million for the
quarter.
   The company's interest expenses fell to $845 million from $983
million.
   RJR Nabisco went private in early 1989 in the largest
debt-financed buyout and corporate acquisition ever. Since then,
the company, like other firms saddled with billions of dollars in
liabilities, has been watched closely to see whether it could
generate enough earnings to pay down its debts.
   Analysts said Tuesday they were pleased with the company's
performance, although some of the numbers were skewed by several
one-time items.
   For instance, the company's results in the latest quarter were
boosted by a $108 million gain from RJR Nabisco's purchase of junk
bonds. The buyback is part of a recapitalization announced earlier
this year.
   RJR Nabisco's tobacco operating income rose more than 51 percent
to $683 million from $451 million in the third quarter of 1989. The
gain was due in part to an inventory reduction program that
depressed third-quarter 1989 tobacco sales.
   Tobacco revenue rose to $2.11 billion in the latest quarter from
$1.55 billion in the 1989 period.
   Despite such extraordinary items, RJR Nabisco's results were
very good and slightly better than expected, said Becky Barfield,
an analyst with First Boston Corp. who described RJR Nabisco as
``on track to slightly ahead'' of itsggoals.
   Jack Maxwell, an analyst with Wheat, First Securities Inc. in
Richmond, Va., called RJR Nabisco's results excellent and said of
its cash flow for the quarter, ``That's really fantastic.''
   RJR Nabisco said earnings from its food business rose nearly 6
percent to $197 million from $186 million a year earlier.
   Food revenue fell to $1.42 billion from $1.45 billion in
third-quarter 1989. The year-earlier results included sales from
RJR Nabisco's Baby Ruth and Butterfinger candy business and its
Chun King oriental foods business, which were later sold.
   For the first nine months of the year, RJR Nabisco reported a
loss of $416 million, down from $1.01 billion in the same period of
1989.
   Operating income during the period was up 46 percent to $2.04
billion from $1.40 billion, and revenue rose to $10.19 billion from
$9.23 billion.
   Under the recapitalization announced last summer, RJR Nabisco is
retiring a large part of the $6 billion in junk bonds used to take
the firm private. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., which arranged the
buyout, gave the food and tobacco a $1.7 billion equity infusion
and negotiated bank loans to pay for the repurchase of the bonds.
   By lowering its debt, RJR Nabisco is reducing its interest
expenses and making itself less vulnerable to the problems that
have handicapped other highly-leveraged firms in recent years.
   RJR Nabisco's tobacco brands, produced by its R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco units, include Winston, Salem and Camel. Its food products
are manufactured by Nabisco Brands Inc. and Planters LifeSavers Co.
and include Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers and Planters nuts.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Surge on Reduced Recession Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices surged Tuesday on New York's Commodity
Exchange in a powerful rally ignited by fading recession fears and
fanned by computer-generated buying.
   On other commodity markets, platinum led the precious metals
higher; oil futures were mixed; grains and soybeans were mixed; and
livestock and meat futures were mostly higher.
   Copper futures settled 3.55 cents to 5.2 cents higher with the
contract for spot delivery at $1.322 a pound.
   The rally marked copper's fourth straight daily advance after
the spot price touched a three-month low of $1.2315 last Wednesday.
   Analysts said the recent decline reflected pessimism about the
economy and perceptions that industrial demand for copper would
slacken in a recession.
   But recession fears have eased as oil prices have fallen, and
many speculators who sold copper futures in anticipation of a
further decline bought back those contracts Tuesday after signs of
trade buying surfaced, analysts said.
   ``People started thinking the slowdown might not be as bad as
formerly thought and demand for copper might not be as adversely
impacted,'' said Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst with
PaineWebber Inc.
   Analysts said buying interest also was fueled by the London
Metal Exchange's weekly report on warehouse stocks of copper, which
showed an unexpectedly large decline of 5,075 metric tons to
192,424.
   The rise in prices triggered large-scale buying by speculative
funds whose trading decisions are based on computerized analysis of
price charts and other market information, analysts said.
   Platinum futures rose sharply for the fifth straight day on the
New York Mercantile Exchange. Like copper, platinum prices fell
dramatically when recession fears were on the rise.
   In addition to a letup in recession worries, ``some people are
thinking that with oil prices breaking like they have recently, we
could see some moderation of interest rates, which might be
supportive,'' said William O'Neill of Merrill Lynch.
   Platinum settled $9.90 to $10.10 higher with October at $422.40
a troy ounce.
   On the Commodity Exchange, gold futures ended $1.50 to $1.60
higher with October at $371.20 a troy ounce; silver was 2.4 cents
to 2.5 cents higher with October at $4.219 a troy ounce.
   Near-term crude oil futures remained below $30 a barrel on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The selling was prompted in part by the release of 14 Americans
in Iraq, prompting further speculation that a peaceful resolution
to the Persian Gulf crisis is near.
   Futures prices of refined products finished broadly mixed with
near-term deliveries up sharply after Monday's dramatic plunge in
gasoline and heating oil.
   Light sweet crude oil futures settled $1.04 lower to 72 cents
higher with December at $29.37 a barrel; heating oil was 3.83 cents
lower to 5.08 cents higher with November at 81.06 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was 3.13 cents lower to 3.4 cents higher with
November at 79.90 cents a gallon.
   Soybean futures rose moderately on the Chicago Board of Trade in
a late, technicaly inspired rally that helped boost corn prices.
Wheat futures finished narrowly mixed.
   Soybean futures bounced back after the November contract failed
to penetrate a three-week low of $6.05 a bushel.
   Wheat futures settled 1 cent lower to { cent higher with
December at $2.63 a bushel; corn was } cent to 1{ cents higher with
December at $2.31{ a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1} cents lower
with December at $1.24 a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents to 8 cents
higher with November at $6.14 a bushel.
   Strong cash markets took precedence over Monday's bearish
government cattle-on-feed report to lift most cattle futures prices
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   The buying interest spilled over into pork complex, which also
drew support from a bullish government report on frozen pork-belly
stocks.
   Live cattle futures settled .10 cent lower to .57 cent higher
with December at 77.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged
to .43 cent higher with October at 87.17 cents a pound; live hogs
were .10 cent to .45 cent higher with December at 54.20 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were .85 cent to 1.23 cents higher with
February at 66.85 cents a pound.

<HEAD>House Committee Holds Administration Bailout on Short Leash</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The House Banking Committee voted Tuesday to
trim the Bush administration's request for as much as $57 billion
more for the savings and loan bailout to $10 billion.
   Both Democrats and Republicans on the panel suggested that
Congress should deny more money for the bailout in view of
President Bush's assertion a year ago that ``never again'' would
taxpayers be tapped for it and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady's
refusal to testify why that has changed.
   But warned by regulators the bailout's total costs might swell
another $250 million to $300 million in the next three months
without the funds, the committee approved just enough money to keep
the program going through February.
   The approval, by voice vote, sets a spending ceiling for money
that must be provided in a separate appropriations bill.
   Administration officials had warned for months the $50 billion
that Bush sought and got from Congress a year ago would not be
enough, and Brady suggested over the summer another $40 billion to
$80 billion might be needed.
   However, the administration never submitted a formal request for
the money until Brady wrote the chthe 11th hour subjected to the
old squeeze play.''
   The committee's chairman, Rep. Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas, said
further money to keep the bailout going beyond February will not
occur ``until Secretary Brady and other officials of the
administration appear in full-dress oversight hearings.''
   Gonzalez said he had a commitment from House leaders to speed
the short-term bill to the House floor, where it was expected to
pass with little debate.
   Congressional and administration sources, speaking on the
condition of anonymity, said they do not expect the Senate Banking
Committee's bill to ever get a vote.
   Instead, they said, the Senate is expected to attach the House
version to another bill, possibly one toughening penalties for S&amp;L
fraud, through a parliamentary maneuver that would allow senators
to avoid a recorded roll-call vote on the issue.

<HEAD>Infotechnology Inc. Sued by Shareholders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Infotechnology Inc., which owns 47 percent of
Financial News Network, was sued Tuesday by shareholders, who
claimed executives issued false and misleading information about
the companies' finances.
   The suit filed in Manhattan's federal court represents all
persons and entities who bought Infotech stock between Sept. 28,
1989, and Oct. 1, when both FNN and Infotech announced they were
unable to meet a deadline for completing financial statements for
the fiscal year that ended June 30.
   The lawsuit said the price of Infotech stock fell to $3 on Oct.
1 from its previous close of $5.75.
   ``Had plaintiff and the members of the class known of the
materially adverse information not disclosed by defendants, they
would not have purchased Infotech common stock at the artificially
inflated prices that were paid,'' the lawsuit said.
   In its Oct. 1 announcement, FNN said it was seeking an extension
for filing a financial statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission because of a dispute with auditors involving the
company's investment in FNN:PRO, a video news and information
market service for professional investors.
   FNN said the dispute could lead to a bank loan default and a
``very substantial non-cash loss'' for the fourth quarter,
according to the lawsuit.
   Infotech announced it also was seeking an extension because it
needed FNN's completed statement to complete its own. The company
also said was considering restructuring $20 million in loans, which
were secured by its shares in FNN.
   The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for shareholders.

<HEAD>Employees Gain Majority Ownership in Textile Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 26,000 employees and managers of
Burlington Industries have acquired a majority ownership and voting
control of the textile giant, the company said Tuesday.
   ``Burlington is now the largest manufacturing company in the
United States controlled by its employees and management,'' said
Frank S. Greenberg, Burlington's chairman and chief executive
officer.
   The company established an employee stock ownership plan, or
ESOP, last year. The transaction announced Tuesday gave employees
and management all of the voting stock and 51 percent of the
company's common equity.
   The transaction changes the ownership status of the financial
investors that helped Burlington repel a hostile takeover attempt
in 1987 by Asher Edelman and Dominion Textile of Canada.
   The investors were The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the
United States and its affiliates, Morgan Stanley Group Inc. and
Bankers Trust New York Corporation.
   Morgan Stanley and Bankers Trust, which purchased 62 percent of
Burlington's common equity in 1987, reduced their ownership to 43
percent when the Burlington ESOP was created last year. They have
further reduced their common equity stake to 13 percent.
   Equitable has retained its original investment, and its common
equity has increased proportionately to 36 percent from 24 percent
as a result of the transaction, the company said.
   Equitable also continues to hold a significant amount of
Burlington's subordinated debt.
   As part of the change, Burlington's board of directors will be
enlarged. Representatives of Burlington management will comprise a
majority of the board to reflect the increased ownership of
management and employees.
   Burlington is one of the world's largest makers of textiles for
apparel, home furnishings and industrial products. It has 51
manufacturing plants in nine states, Canada and Mexico.

<HEAD>Computer Industry Consortium Unveils ``Open'' Software</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A consortium of leading computer companies
oncluding IBM and Digital Equipment Corp. unveiled a computer
software system Tuesday they say will make it vastly easier to
connect various brands of computers.
   The group, called the Open Software Foundation, announced the
release of its first operating system, or the base layer of
software that controls a computer's internal functions.
   By agreeing to offer the same operating system on some or all of
their computers, the OSF members hope to answer pleas from computer
users that different brands and types of computers work together
more easily.
   The computer industry is overburdened with operating systems,
some unique to one brand of computer, others tied to specific
computer chips. But there is no single operating system that can be
used on every computer in the market.
   That means applications software, such as a word-processing
program, designed for one type of computer usually cannot be used
on another type of computer. This often forces computer users to
buy or write different programs for each type of machine they own.
   ``Many of our customers have told us that open systems is what
they want and what they expect,'' said Jack Kuehler, president of
International Business Machines Corp.
   Kuehler, as well as executives of Digital, Hewlett-Packard Co.,
France's Groupe Bull, Simens-Nixdorf Information Systems of Germany
and Japan's Hitachi Ltd., said at an OSF news conference that their
companies would offer the consortium's operating system as an
option on a number of models.
   But however noble the OSF's goals, its formation was sparked by
a less magnanimous reason - an industry battle over control of
Unix, a popular operating system that is the core of OSF's new
software.
   Unix was developed 21 years ago by American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co., but other companies later devised incompatible
versions of it.
   OSF, a non-profit group based in Cambridge, Mass., was founded
two years ago by a group of AT&amp;T competitors after they became
concerned that the phone and computer company was trying to retain
control of Unix development rather than allow it to evolve into
industry standard.
   In response to OSF, AT&amp;T formed a rival industry group called
Unix International Inc., which includes the nation's third-largest
computer maker, Unisys Corp., as well as Data General Corp. and Sun
Microsystems Inc., which is 20 percent owned by AT&amp;T.
   The split over Unix obscures the future of OSF's operating
system.
   OSF and AT&amp;T's Unix operations said last November they were
discussing a merger to end their division. But the talks broke off
in April after the two sides apparently could not agree on a plan
to make Unix development independent of any manufacturer.

<HEAD>Wang Returns to Profitability, But Earnings Fall at Control Data,
Tandy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wang Laboratories Inc. said Tuesday it returned to profitability
in its most-recent quarter, but two other computer makers, Control
Data Corp. and Tandy Corp., said their earnings slipped.
   Wang said it earned $2.6 million, or 2 cents a share, in the
quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $62.1 million, or
38 cents a share, in the same quarter last year.
   Revenue in the period, which is Wang's first fiscal quarter,
totaled $571.5 million, down from $604.8 million a year earlier.
   ``Given an extremely difficult industry situation and an adverse
economic environment, we are pleased with these results as further
evidence that our turnaround programs are working,'' said Richard
W. Miller, chairman and chief executive officer of the Lowell,
Mass.-based company.
   Wang has been attempting to pull out of a slump that has caused
it to report a string of quarterly losses.
   ``During the (most recent) quarter, the company achieved another
important milestone by totally eliminating debt to its bank
group,'' he said. ``This debt was $575 million in August 1989, and
it is zero today.''
   Wang said it recorded a gain of $11.8 million during the quarter
from the transfer of an interest in a real estate subsidiary in
Brussels, Belgium.
   Control Data Corp. said it earned $8.5 million, or 20 cents a
share, in the third quarter, down 13.2 percent from $9.8 million,
or 23 cents a share, in 1989's third quarter.
   Revenue fell 43 percent to $434.1 million, from $763 million.
   Last year's third-quarter results included revenue and earnings
from Imprimis, a disk drive subsidiary that since has been sold,
and a pre-tax restructuring gain of $8.5 million, the company said.
   The Bloomington, Minn.-based company will take ``decisive
steps'' in the fourth quarter to deal with problems at its energy
management and automated wagering operations, according to a
statement from Lawrence Perlman, president and chief executive
officer.
   Empros, the energy management division, is faced with cost
overruns on fixed-priced contracts, said Nancy Foltz, a company
spokeswoman. The automated wagering unit is considering a write-off
in connection with the suspension in the United Kingdom of a
betting game operated by one of its customers, Foltz said.
   Control Data did not estimate the size of a potential write-off
or say how much the overruns at Empros will cost.
   The effects ``could be substantial in relation to earnings
generated by the rest of the company's operations,'' the company
said.
   For the first nine months of the year, Control Data said it
earned $26.5 million, or 62 cents a share, compared with a loss of
$484 million, or $11.51 a share, in the same period last year.
Revenue totaled $1.26 billion, down from $2.41 billion.
   Tandy said it earned $52.2 million, or 65 cents a share, in the
quarter ended Sept. 30, down from $62.8 million, or 73 cents a
share, in the same quarter last year.
   Revenue at the Fort Worth, Texas, company totaled $1.09 billion,
up 11 percent over $986 million in the same period last year, which
is Tandy's first fiscal quarter.
   Tandy, a computer manufacturer and operator of the Radio Shack
electronics stores, blamed the lower earnings on price cuts of its
products.
   ``Given the uncertain retail environment in the wake of the
Middle East crisis, we began to clear Radio Shack's inventories of
certain discontinued consumer items and computer models prior to
the holiday selling season,'' said John V. Roach, chairman and
chief executive.
   ``Clearance sales of these discontinued items were strong and
negatively influenced gross margin and earnings,'' he said in a
statement.

   McDonald's Corp. on Tuesday reported
record sales, revenue and net income for the 102nd consecutive
quarter, citing sound business fundamentals amid a slackening
economy.
   For the third quarter ended Sept. 30, net income was $242.2
million, or 67 cents a share, compared to $217.9 million, or 59
cents a share, a year ago.
   Systemwide sales were $4.99 billion, compared to $4.6 billion a
year ago, while total revenues were $1.8 billion, compared to $1.6
billion a year ago.
   Michael R. Quinlan, chairman and chief executive officer of
McDonald's, said 1990 will be another good year for the company
despite a weakening U.S. economy.
   ``The fundamentals of our business remain sound and we will meet
investor expectations for this quarter and for the year,'' he said.
   During the third quarter, McDonald's passed the 3,000 restaurant
milestone in international growth, said James R. Cantalupo,
president and chief operating officer.
   ``With new opportunities in Eastern Europe and the USSR, and the
acceleration of profitability in other markets, Europe has become
important to the growth strategy of McDonald's,'' he said.
   A total of 317 outlets were added in the first nine months of
1990, including 159 outside the United States. An additional 342
restaurants were under construction as of Sept. 30, including 163
outside the United States.
   For the first nine months of 1990, McDonald's had net income of
$616.1 million or $1.69 a share, up from $555.6 million or $1.49 a
share in the 1989 period.
   Revenues increased to $5.05 billion vs. $4.56 billion last year.

   Salomon's profit fell 55.4 percent to $79 million, or 55 cents a

   Salomon's results include a $200 million pre-tax charge for
reducing the size of its Philipp Brothers commodities unit. Without

<HEAD>Persian Gulf Crisis Walloped Some in Third Quarter, Helped Others</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Three of the largest oil companies blamed Persian Gulf turmoil
Tuesday for depressing third-quarter earnings, while another said
the resulting oil-price jump gave it mixed results and two more
said profits rose five-fold.
   The decreased earnings reported by Mobil Corp., Shell Oil Co.
and Sun Co. and the mixed performance by Texaco Inc. contradicted
what they called the popular belief that big oil companies have
cynically exploited the spectacular jump in crude prices stemming
from Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   ``It is ironic that at the time the public perceived the oil
industry was profiteering and price gouging, our oil products
business lost $64 million in net income in the two months following
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait,'' said Shell President Frank H.
Richardson.
   Conversely, Amerada Hess Corp. profited immensely from trading
in oil-price futures, and Diamond Shamrock Inc. benefited from a
major revaluation of its crude oil and refined product inventories,
which rose enormously in value because of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Oil prices went from about $21 a barrel before Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait to as high as $41 on a U.S.-led embargo of Iraqi crude
and fears that a war would disrupt supplies from a crucial
production region.
   At the same time, prices for gasoline and other refined products
shot up, but not nearly as much as crude.
   This means companies primarily involved in extracting petroleum
or speculating in petroleum have done well. But companies heavily
reliant on the ``downstream'' refining end of the business have
been hurt because they've had to absorb some of the higher crude
costs without passing them on to consumers.

   Mobil earned $379 million or 89 cents a share in the three
months ended Sept. 30, down 29 percent from the $532 million or
$1.30 a share earned a year earlier. Third-quarter revenue totaled
$16.31 billion vs. $13.46 billion, a 21.2 percent increase.
   ``During the third quarter of 1990, results in our marketing and
refining operations declined substantially, reflecting our
inability to recover the rapid run-up in crude oil and purchased
product costs,'' Mobil Chairman Allen E. Murray said.
   The company, based in Fairfax, Va., said it earned $5 million on
marketing and refining operations in the third quarter, vs. $366
million a year earlier. In the United States, marketing and
refining operations ended the quarter with a $22 million loss.
   For the nine month period, Mobil earned $1.28 billion or $3.02 a
share, down 5.8 percent from the $1.36 billion or $3.32 a share
earned in the comparable 1989 period. Nine-month revenues totaled

from $305 million or $1.10 a share a year earlier. Revenues totaled
$10.95 billion vs. $8.36 billion, up 31 percent.
   James W. Kinnear, president and chief executive, said the
results showed that Texaco's exploration and drilling businesses
did well from the oil-price jump but much of that gain was blunted
by lower profit margins on refined gasoline and petrochemical
products.
   For the nine months, Texaco earned $1.06 billion or $3.78 a
share, down from $2.13 billion or $8.19 a share a year earlier when
earnings were inflated by a large one-time gain from the sale of
its Canadian subsidiary. Nine-month revenues totaled $28.83 billion

   Warner Bros. will pay $125 million
for video rights to many MGM-UA films, with the money helping to
fund Pathe Communications Corp.'s buyout of MGM-UA Communications
Co., the companies announced Tuesday.
   The deal puts into place another piece of the complex sale of
MGM-UA to Pathe, headed by Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti.
   The MGM-UA board voted on Tuesday to extend the deadline for the
sale's closing to Friday. ``There are no snags and no problems,''
company spokeswoman Mary Hardy said.
   Included in the Warner Bros. purchase are more than 1,000 United
Artists titles, 650 Cannon releases, about 40 MGM films made after
1986 and about a dozen Pathe films.
   In buying the video rights, Warner Bros., an arm of Time Warner
Inc., said it will drop a $100 million lawsuit it had filed against
Pathe June 29 following an attempt by Warner Bros. to help finance
Pathe's purchase of MGM-UA.
   On Monday, Pathe and MGM-UA announced that Pathe had delivered
the $967 million balance of the $1.3 billion purchase price.
   The new enterprise already sold English-language television
rights for nearly 1,000 MGM-UA films to Turner Broadcasting System
Inc. on Sunday. That transaction was valued at a reported $200
million.
   Beverly Hills-based Pathe is a film producer with a variety of
movie-related holdings in Europe. As part of the transaction,
MGM-UA will buy for $700 million the bulk of Pathe's assets. That
$700 million is being raised in part through the Warner Bros. and
Turner transactions.
   Of the remaining $1.3 billion purchase price, $600 million came
from a private sale of stock in the new company, mostly from
European concerns affiliated with Giancarlo Parretti, Pathe's
majority owner.
   Pathe spokesman Craig Parsons said details of the stock sale
would be revealed in Securities and Exchange Commission filings
later this week. He did not identify the new investors, but said
Pathe would maintain a majority interest in the new company.
   It remains unclear what will be left of MGM-UA when Pathe takes
control of the historic studio as early as Friday. Over the last
two decades, MGM-UA majority owner Kirk Kerkorian has parceled off
many of the company's assets, including almost all rights to older
MGM movie titles and the MGM studio real estate itself.
   At the very least, Pathe will still control domestic theatrical
rights to the combined studios' films and MGM-UA's television arm,
which makes ``thirtysomething'' and other shows.
   Wall Street analysts have said it will take at least $500
million in capital expenditures over several years to revive
MGM-UA.
   In Tuesday's 12{-year deal with Warner Bros., the companies said
Time Warner will receive worldwide video rights to the libraries of
MGM, UA, Pathe and Cannon. Cannon was bought by Pathe last year.
   In addition, Warner Bros.' home video arm will have worldwide
rights to 11 current and upcoming Pathe releases. They include
``Quigley Down Under,'' ``The Russia House,'' ``Shattered,'' ``Not
Without My Daughter'' and ``Thelma and Louise,'' among others.

Earnings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Johnson &amp; Johnson's earnings for the
third quarter rose 18.5 percent, in part because of the weaker
dollar, the pharmaceutical company said Tuesday.
   For the third quarter, earnings were $314 million, or 94 cents
per share, up from $265 million, or 80 cents per share during the
same period in 1989.
   Sales for the quarter increased 17.1 percent to $2.87 billion
from $2.45 billion last year.
   More than half of the pharmaceutical and health care giant's
revenues are generated abroad, with international sales accounting
for $1.47 billion of total worldwide sales, said Ralph S. Larson,
chairman and chief executive officer.
   International sales, from which Johnson &amp; Johnson generates more
than 50 percent of its revenues, increased 22.1 percent during the
third quarter.
   The weaker dollar increased third quarter sales by 5.3 percent,
the company said.
   Earnings for the first nine months of 1990 rose 3.6 percent to
$911, or $2.73 per share, compared with $879 million, or $2.64 per
share, in the same period in 1989.
   Sales for the first three quarters of 1990 were $8.53 billion, a
17.1 percent increase from 1989 figure of $7.29 billion.

<TEXT>
   Castle &amp; Cooke Inc., Dole Food Co.'s parent
company, said Tuesday that earnings rose 88 percent, with the
opening of markets in Eastern Europe increasing demand for fresh
fruit and vegetables.
   ``Our food business is reporting record profits,'' Chief
Executive David H. Murdock said in a statement. ``As a low-cost
producer, we are well positioned to take advantage of the increased
worldwide demand for fresh produce.''
   Castle &amp; Cooke is in the process of trying to sell Dole, which
dominates the worldwide production and distribution of fresh
produce, to concentrate on its other business, real estate. Several
big international food companies are reported to have considered
buying Dole.
   Castle &amp; Cooke said its third-quarter profits were $44 million,
or 74 cents per share, on revenue of $879 million. That compares
with the 1989 third quarter's profit of $23.4 million, or 39 cents
per share, on revenue of $762 million.
   Profits would have been higher except for a $12.6 million
after-tax charge from Dole giving up on pineapple production on the
Hawaiian island of Lanai. Castle &amp; Cooke said in September it would
switch to more diversified agriculture and begin developing resort
hotels on the island.
   The first part of that development is a 102-room English country
manor-styled hotel, The Lodge at Koele.

<TEXT>
   A team of lawyers spent the weekend preparing a
Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing for Continental Airlines, but the
carrier's board is split on how to deal with its financial
troubles, according to a published report.
   In its early Wednesday edition, The New York Times quotes an
attorney, who spoke on condition of anonymity, as saying the papers
were ready to be filed in bankruptcy court Monday morning.
   The airline denied the report.
   ``The company has no intention of filing for bankruptcy
protection,'' said Art Kent, a spokesman for Continental.
   Continental suffered losses during the normally busy summer
travel season and has been hurt by higher fuel prices since the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the newspaper said.
   Frank Lorenzo, who recently stepped down as chairman of
Continental but remains on the board, opposes a Chapter 11 filing
by the airline, the Times said. Also, Jan Carlzon, chairman of
Scandavian Airlines System, which owns 16.8 percent of Continental
stock, opposes filing for bankruptcy, the newspaper quoted the
lawyer as saying.
   A filing would reduce the value of SAS's holdings.
   The newspaper said it was not clear which board members support
filing for bankruptcy protection.
   On Tuesday, Continental said it has moved to cut costs by
restructuring its senior management team, cutting five top
executives.
   The board of directors for the Houston-based airline approved
the restructuring plan on Monday.
   ``With radically higher fuel costs, Continental must become a
stronger competitor in the global marketplace,'' said Hollis
Harris, Continental's chairman and chief executive officer. ``We
have reaffirmed our intention to become a preferred airline among
frequent travelers around the world.''
   Harris was given the additional role of president, replacing
Mickey Foret, who is leaving the company to pursue other interests,
officials said.
   Also leaving the carrier will be Neal Neehan, senior vice
president-customer services; Clark Omstad, senior vice
president-properties and government affairs; Jim Arpey, senior vice
president-aircraft programs; and Elliott Seiden, vice president and
associate general counsel for Continental Airlines Holdings, Inc.
   Continental named Thomas Kalil senior vice president-customer
service and announced Lewis Jordan, executive vice president and
system general manager, was given the additional responsibility for
managing the company's international division.
   ``These actions position Continental with a lean and efficient
management structure that reflects the realities of operating
during this fuel crisis,'' Harris said.
