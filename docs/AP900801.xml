   Texas on Wednesday banned all fishing in
Galveston Bay because of a 500,000-gallon oil spill threatening
public health as well as miles of shoreline and environmentally
sensitive estuaries.
   In another development, the captain and helmsman of a Greek
tanker whose collision with two barges caused the spill blamed the
accident on a state pilot at a federal hearing.
   And federal officials approved the use of oil-eating microbes to
help clean up the spill, which threatens birds and other wildlife
in nesting grounds around the bay.
   The Greek tanker Shinoussa collided Saturday with two of three
barges towed by the tug Chandy N in the Houston Ship Channel, which
passes through the bay. Heavy black oil spewed from the barges
until Tuesday. The double-hulled tanker didn't leak.
   The state Health Department banned fishing as of midnight
Wednesday because the spill presents a health threat, according to
Neil Travis, chief of the agency's consumer health protection
bureau in Austin.
   ``It's as much a precautionary measure as anything else,''
Travis said, adding that officials grew concerned after seeing
shrimpers pull trawls through an oil slick. Some oil-tainted shrimp
have been caught.
   The indefinite ban for all of Galveston Bay and connecting
waters covers all aquatic organisms, including fish, crabs, oysters
and shrimp, said biologist Don Pitts of the state Parks and
Wildlife Department, which will enforce the ban.
   ``Everybody's just kind of taken by surprise,'' said John
Collins, secretary of the Texas Live Bait Dealers Association.
``There's really not too much you can say _ just do it. It's for
people's health.''
   Coast Guard officials said less of the 17-mile slick was visible
Wednesday, indicating the oil either had begun dissipating or had
sunk.
   But environmentalists said if the oil has reached the bays
bottom, it may present an even more serious threat to wildlife.
   ``I think it's a worse situation than if it was floating on the
surface,'' said Larry McKinney of the state Parks and Wildlife
Department. He said oil on the bottom could kill small aquatic
life, breaking a crucial link in the food chain.
   The bay is protected from the Gulf of Mexico by barrier islands
that contain nesting grounds for dozens of species of birds and
other wildlife. Environmentalists fear that the proximity of the
islands and the oil's thickness would make it difficult to
dissipate.
   Two seabirds have died and oily birds were spotted, but there
were no new reports of dead wildlife.
   Cleanup crews used six skimmer vessels and a vacuum truck to
scoop up the oil, which already has tainted several beaches around
the bay. More than 50,000 gallons of oil had been retrieved by
Wednesday, Coast Guard officials said.
   Salvage crews slid a sling under the crippled barge to help
refloat it, said Coast Guard spokesman Dennis Schaefer.
   The tanker's captain and helmsman testified at the opening
session of a hearing by the Coast Guard and the National
Transportation Safety Board.
   Capt. Nikolos Fioratos of Greece and helmsman Mohammad S. Haque,
33, of Bangladesh claimed pilot Raymond Fincher of the Houston
Pilots Association misdirected the Shinoussa into the path of the
barges.
   Haque said the Shinoussa, headed out to the Gulf of Mexico, had
been traveling alongside a Liberian tanker headed into the ship
channel just before the accident occurred. The barges also were
heading in, behind the Liberian ship Hellespont Faith.
   Fioratos, 44, said he thought Fincher had been directing the
tanker to travel too fast _ at 14 knots _ and too close to the
Liberian ship.
   ``It was very close _ my estimate is about 10 meters,'' Fioratos
said. ``We almost greeted the other ship by hand.''
   Fioratos said he didn't express his concerns because he didn't
want to make trouble for his crew.
   Haque said the pilot ordered him to go left, then quickly
ordered him to go right after realizing the tanker was headed for
the barges.
   Haque said he responded immediately, but it was too late. The
experienced helmsman hadn't steered through the channel before.
   Fincher, who has yet to testify, disputed Haque's account. ``He
put the rudder the wrong way at a critical time,'' the pilot said.
   A home video shot by a Timothy Hanes, of Spring, who was on a
sailboat during the accident, could provide some answers, officials
said.
   Hanes said the Shinoussa passed a vessel on the left, then
collided with the Apex Towing Co. barges.
   Hanes is to testify and the videotape is to be aired during the
three-day hearing.
   A federal-state task force said oil-eating microbes could be
spread Thursday on the spill, which extends in patches for 17 miles.
   In a process called bioremediation, the microbes convert the oil
into a fatty substance fish can eat.
   The Coast Guard continued to direct traffic through the channel,
opening one lane at a time. The shipping disruption costs about
$1.5 million a day, said Ted Thorjunssen, president of the West
Gulf Maritime Association.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf CLARIFY that Marino was nation's highest
ranking black Roman Catholic. </NOTE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The resignation last month of Atlanta's Roman
Catholic archbishop was prompted by the discovery of his two-year
relationship with a woman, his successor said Wednesday.
   Archbishop Eugene A. Marino, 56, who was the nation's highest
ranking black Roman Catholic, resigned July 10 for what he said
were health reasons and the need for ``spiritual renewal,
psychological therapy and medical supervision.'' He had
relinquished his duties in May because of severe stress and a near
heart attack.
   But Atlanta television station WAGA reported Wednesday that
Marino's resignation followed the church's discovery of a
relationship between the archbishop and a lay minister, Vicki R.
Long.
   Marino's temporary successor, Bishop James P. Lyke, said the
former archbishop gave permission Wednesday to confirm the
relationship after the television station's report.
   Neither the television station nor Lyke said if the relationship
was sexual.
   Lyke told The Atlanta Constitution that church officials were
told in March that Marino was involved with a woman. He defended
the decision of the archdiocese to withhold the details of Marino's
resignation. He said Marino was the only one who could ``call the
shots.''
   The Rev. Peter Dora, Atlanta Archdiocese spokesman, said church
officials wouldn't comment further until a news conference Thursday.
   In 1987, Ms. Long filed a $2.3 million paternity suit against a
priest, Donal Keohane of Columbus, alleging that he fathered her
child. The church is paying child support, but denies that Keohane
is the father of child. A blood test later concluded that Keohane
was not the father of the child.
   Ms. Long declined to comment about the allegations involving
Marino.
   The television station reported it had obtained photographs of
Marino and Ms. Long attending various functions together and a
flight insurance policy for a trip to Mexico taken by Marino. Ms.
Long was listed as the archbishop's beneficiary on the policy.
   Church officials refused to say where Marino was.
   Marino was ordained in 1962 and consecrated as a bishop in 1974.
He was named archbishop of Atlanta in May 1988, the nation's first
black archbishop.
   He came to Atlanta coming from Washington, D.C., where he was
auxiliary bishop to Cardinal James Hickey.
   The pope appointed Lyke, auxiliary bishop of Cleveland, to be
administrator of the Archdiocese of Atlanta, which covers 69
counties in northern Georgia with Catholic population of more than
150,000, until a new archbishop is appointed.

<TEXT>
   The president of the American Bar Association
reported that $55,000 cash given him by a client was stolen from a
hotel safe deposit box.
   Stanley Chauvin, a Louisville, Ky., lawyer who heads the ABA,
said he had put the money in a rented box at the Hyatt Regency
Hotel, where he is staying during the group's annual convention.
   Chauvin, 55, said he discovered the money missing when he
checked the box Tuesday night. He declined to say how much money
disappeared.
   But hotel spokeswoman Nancy Ruth said Chauvin reported $55,000
missing and added that the money was in $100 bills, stashed in a
cloth bag.
   Chauvin told police ``he had picked the money up from a client
on the way from Louisville,'' Lt. Kenneth Bringe said Wednesday.
   ``He didn't want to go back to Louisville to put the money in
the bank,'' so he brought it to Chicago and stored it in the
deposit box, he said.
   Bringe said there was no obvious evidence that the box had been
tampered with, but police questioned employees, took fingerprints
and checked the box's lock.
   Ms. Ruth said there are only two keys to the box, a guard key
for employees and one for the guest. Both keys must be used to open
the boxes behind the hotel's front desk.
   She said an employee had unlocked the box Tuesday night and left
the room before Chauvin realized the money was missing.

   Iraqi troops have launched an offensive
against Kuwait, the Kuwaiti embassy said Wednesday night.
   Faleh Bader, director of the ambassador's office, said, ``We
confirm there is an offensive at Kuwait border and we have no
comment.''
   The attack started about midnight, Kuwaiti time (5 p.m. EDT),
Bader said.
   Earlier in the day, the Iraqi ambassador, Mohamed Al-Mashat, was
summoned to the State Department afternoon for a meeting with
Assistant Secretary John Kelly.
   Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Kelly repeated to the
Iraqi envoy the U.S. desire for a peaceful solution to the tensions
with Kuwait and urged Iraq to respect to sovereignty of all nations
in the region.
   Kelly told a House subcommittee Tuesday that while the United
States has no treaty obligations that would mandate military
support for Kuwait, the United States does believe strongly in
respect for territories of all states in the region.
   The United States, whose Persian Gulf naval patrols helped Iraq
defeat Iran in the 1980-1988 war, has six warships in the area.
They have been conducting exercises since July 23 with forces of
the United Arab Emirates, some 700 miles southest of Kuwait.
   Iraq had moved about 100,000 troops to its border with Kuwait
after claiming that Kuwait's production of oil beyond quotas of the
OPEC cartel had depressed the world price, thus diminishing Iraq's
revenue, and that Kuwait had been stealing oil from a field that
straddles the border.
   Iraqi officials on Wednesday walked out on talks in Jiddah,
Saudia Arabia aimed at resolving the 2-week-old crisis with
neighboring Kuwait and complained that Kuwait was not negotiating
seriously.
   Iraq threatened to invade once before, in 1961 after Britain
ended its protectorate over Kuwait. Iraq then claimed Kuwait as
part of its territory, but the appearance on the Kuwaiti side of
the border of troops from Britain and other Arab states deterred
further action by Iraq.

<HEAD>Controllers Declare a Fuel Emergency</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   New York air traffic controllers declared a fuel
emergency aboard an Avianca jet from Colombia after the pilot said
he only had 15 minutes of fuel, a Federal Aviation Administration
spokeswoman said Wednesday.
   The Tuesday night incident was a chilling reminder of January's
Avianca Flight 52, which crashed into a hillside in Cove Neck, Long
Island, killing 73 people on board after it ran out of fuel en
route to Kennedy International Airport.
   Air traffic controllers declared a fuel emergency Tuesday on
board Avianca Flight 20, also heading for Kennedy Airport.
Controllers made the declaration after they detected some
reluctance by the plane's pilot to call a fuel emergency, according
to Joseph Fuscella, an air traffic controller.
   The controllers immediately put all other planes in the area on
hold and gave the 767 jetliner a straight-in pattern to Kennedy
where it landed safely at 9:24 p.m., said Diane Spitaliere, the FAA
spokeswoman.
   The jet reportedly had only 5 minutes of fuel left on board when
it landed, according to Fuscella and Spitaliere.
   Spitaliere said that the FAA is ``looking into'' the incident.
   Fuscella said Avianca 20, en route from Cali and Bogota, had
followed the same flight path up the East Coast as Flight 52.
   Flight 20 apparently was placed in an undetermined holding
pattern in the Washington area.
   The incident developed about 30 miles south of Kennedy Airport
when the pilot told New York regional controllers he had only 15
minutes of fuel left.
   The air traffic controllers alerted controllers at the local
control station known as TRACON, or New York Terminal Radar
Control, based in Garden City on Long Island.
   ``There was some confusion as to whether the pilot had said 15
minutes or 51 minutes,'' said Fuscella.
   TRACON controllers contacted the pilot, who confirmed that he
had only 15 minutes of fuel on board.
   ``He was asked if he wanted to declare a fuel emergency,'' said
Fuscella.
   ``When they detected some reluctance in his voice, the
controllers _ mindful of the Avianca crash _ decided to declare an
emergency and bring him right in,'' said Fuscella.
   Avianca Flight 52 crashed after being placed in holding patterns
for 90 minutes. The crew apparently failed to properly alert
controllers of a fuel emergency.
   If an emrgency hadn't been declared Tuesday, the plane would
have been instructed to take its position at the end of a line of
aircraft waiting in a pattern to land at Kennedy.
   The final landing flight then would have taken approximately 25
minutes, according to Fuscella.
   By putting Flight 20 at the head of the line, it took the plane
12 minutes to land, he said.
   Fuscella said there were numerous planes in a holding pattern
Tuesday because of severe thunderstorms in the area and normal
evening congestion.
   The flight, scheduled to land at 8:24 p.m., was an hour late but
it was not clear where the delay occurred or what caused it.
   ``The controllers proceeded on the side of caution in light of
the other crash,'' said Spitaliere.
   Fuscella agreed, saying, ``this certainly was a deja vu
situation.''

<TEXT>
   Voluntary ceilings would be set for Senate campaigns, with the
total for both primary and general elections ranging from $1.9
million in the smallest states to $9.5 million in the largest,
California.
   However, $243,000 of that amount in the smallest state up to
$1,125,000 in California would have to come from in-state
contributions of $100 or less.

   Because the Supreme Court has ruled that mandated spending
ceilings would violate First Amendment rights of free speech, the
bill offers incentives for voluntary compliance.
   Complying candidates would be provided a total of $20 million in

through a voluntary checkoff on individual income tax returns.
Candidates would qualify for additional public financing if their
opponents exceed the caps.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>MAIL</BYLINE>

   Complying candidates would get a 75 percent discount on
first-class mail rates for the campaign material up to 5 percent of
the spending ceiling. Incumbent senators and House members would be
prohibited from using their franking privileges to make mass
mailings at government expense in the calendar years they are up
for re-election.

executives of the same employer would be limited to a total of
$5,000 per candidate.
   If the PAC ban is declared unconstitutional, the maximum
allowable PAC contribution to a single candidate would be cut from
$10,000 to $2,000 for both primary and general elections. Total PAC
contributions in that event would be limited to $375,000 for
candidates in the smallest state up to $825,000 in California.

   The new director of a Bulgarian weapons company
whose arms have been linked to terrorists plans to share
information with western governments, The New York Times reported.
   The newly appointed general director of the Kintex arms company,
Anton Saldjiski, said an interview published in the paper's
Thursday editions that the company had records of all weapons and
ammunition exported to Warsaw Pact nations and to countries like
Libya, Syria and Iraq.
   Some of these nations are suspected by Western governments of
having transferred arms to the Palestinian Liberation Organization,
the Irish Reublican Army and other groups.
   If Western governments obtain weapons used by terrorists and
trace them to Bulgaria, Kintex will tell them what country the arms
were orginally shipped to, Saldjiski said.
   He said Kintex had just joined Interpol, the international law
enforcement group.
   He said Kintex's customers must sign contracts stipulating that
they won't deliver the weapons to a third country.
   ``To my knowledge we have not been involved in the direct supply
of arms to terrorists, but it is possible that these arms have
reached such groups via governments we have supplied legally,'' he
said.
   He said he had been told that Kintex equipment has reached the
PLO.
   Kintex was linked by some investigators to the 1981
assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II.

<TEXT>
   The Iron Curtain that bisected Europe
has been lifted, but it remains in place above the Arctic Circle.
   An electrified fence runs along the Soviet side of the 120-mile
frontier, said Hugo Overgaard, the Norwegian border commissioner.
   Norwegian and Soviet scouts exchange salutes, still without
speaking, but the Norwegians say they no longer crouch into firing
position when they see each other.
   Soviet officials require at least two weeks notice of a visit
from Norway. Soviet civilians are allowed within 18 miles of the
frontier only if they live in the area, Overgaard told reporters.
   The border joins Norway with the Kola Peninsula, home of the
Soviet nuclear submarine fleet. The Gulf Stream keeps the Barents
Sea free of ice, allowing the Soviets to operate naval bases and
the port of Murmansk through the winter.
   To the north is a vast sea area without defined national
boundaries. Spokesmen for Statoil, Norway's national oil company,
say its petroleum reserves may surpass those of the North Sea.
   ``Central Europe is being disarmed, while in the north there is
continued strong dynamics with naval forces,'' said Sverre Lodgaard
of the Peace Research Institute in Oslo. ``The Nordic area does not
get its share of the detente in other regions.''
   Soviet border guards held a Norwegian man briefly in July and
said he was captured on their side of Grens Jakobselv, a stream
marking the border.
   A week before, Soviet guards chased and shot at a Norwegian
fisherman, who denied violating the frontier. Norway protested the
shooting, but Foreign Ministry spokesman Vegard Ellefsen said the
Soviets did not provide an explanation.
   There are signs of change. Border guards from the two countries
plan a soccer match this month at Kirkenes, on the Norwegian side,
and the possibility of providing visas in two days is being
discussed.
   Norway's territory on the frontier is bleak _ low hills, forests
and rocks _ and relatively unfortified.
   Juri Kosereff, son of Soviet refugees, lives on the Norwegian
side of the Grens Jakobselv, which runs through a sandy beach into
the sea.
   ``In the old days there was no border here,'' he said. ``We went
over the river, back and forth as we wanted. On the other side were
a store and an inn.'' He and an old woman are the only remaining
inhabitants of what once was a village straddling the border.
   When Kosereff was young, the other side of the river and part of
the village was in Finland. The Soviet Union claimed the territory
after World War II and sealed the border.
   Fewer than 30 people a year crossed the line in the late 1940s.
Norwegian officials said the traffic gradually increased, to 3,000
last year.
   Soviet officials require two weeks to process applications by
visitors planning day trips by sea ferry or airplane from Kirkenes
to Murmansk. A travel agent said those taking organized bus tours
must apply three weeks ahead and visas for private land trips take
four to five weeks.
   All land travelers pass through a Norwegian border post at
Storskog, 7 miles south of Kirkenes.
   Frontier conditions ``have been affected very little by
variations in East-West relations,'' said Overgaard, the border
commissioner.
   Yellow signs and border poles along the Grens Jakobselv make
clear that off-limits Soviet territory starts about 11 yards away.
   Kosereff plans to visit the Soviet Union for the first time, on
a bus trip to see an aunt in Murmansk. The straight-line distance
is about 110 miles, but his bus will have to go hundreds of miles
out of its way through Finland to avoid Soviet military areas.

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eugene L. Roberts Jr., who led The
Philadelphia Inquirer to 17 Pulitzer Prizes in 16 years, announced
Tuesday he would retire as executive editor and president effective
Sept. 1.
   He will be succeeded by Maxwell E.P. King, an Inquirer editor
for 15 years before his promotion in 1987 to vice president for
consumer marketing and distribution. The changes were announced by
Robert J. Hall, chairman and publisher.
   Roberts, 58, joined the Knight-Ridder newspaper in 1972. He told
the staff Tuesday afternoon that he had at one time talked of
retiring at 55.
   ``But then when 55 came, there were family responsibilities that
made it seem the wrong time,'' he said. ``Now the time has come.
I've been here in this job for 18 years and that's a long time.''
   Roberts will remain with the Knight-Ridder newspaper group as a
consultant and said he plans to enter discussions at the end of the
week about a university teaching position.
   King, 46, became a senior vice president in 1988. His title will
be editor of the Inquirer and executive vice president of
Philadelphia Newspapers Inc.
   An award-winning journalist and son of a weekly newspaper
editor, Roberts joined the Inquirer in 1972.
   Roberts covered the civil rights movement in the 1960s and the
Vietnam War for The New York Times, and later became its national
editor.
   He began his career as a farm reporter for the Goldsboro (N.C.)
News-Argus. He also worked at The Virginian-Pilot of Norfolk, Va.;
The News and Observer of Raleigh, N.C.; and the Detroit Free Press
before he joined The New York Times.
   King joined the Inquirer as a reporter in 1972. Two years later
he became city editor and left in 1976 for just over a year to
write for Forbes magazine. He returned to the Inquirer, eventually
becoming associate managing editor before moving to the business
side of the operation in 1987.

<HEAD>Soviets Producing Record Grain Harvest But Much Expected to Rot</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is piling up a record harvest,
but much of the grains and vegetables are expected to rot rather
than ease the country's worsening shortage of food.
   The centrally planned economy has been unable to adjust to the
bounty, and the stunning yields reported by the news media are
threatened by shortages of fuel, storage space and transport.
   While consumers face barren shelves in city grocery stores and
officials warn of critical shortages by winter, Soviet television
shows mounds of fresh wheat dumped in rural parking lots because
grain elevators are full.
   The Soviet Union annually loses 20 to 30 percent of its food
harvest on the way to market. Grain and vegetables pour from leaky
trucks, rutted highways slow food convoys, railroad schedules
become scrambled and air transport for produce is rare.
   Last week, Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin ordered
emergency incentives in his republic to prevent a ``catastrophe''
in the food supply. Other officials have warned of civil strife if
the food shortages are not solved.
   ``This is the moment when it is necessary to move from words to
deeds, or Moscow could face winter without vegetables or
potatoes,'' food producers warned in a letter printed Saturday on
the front page of Moskovskaya Pravda.
   It said much of the Moscow-area vegetable crop was endangered by
a shortage of hands for the harvest.
   Preliminary estimates indicate the grain crop in this critical
year for Soviet reform could top 230 million tons, Soviet
television reported Monday. That would surpass last year's record
211 million tons and swamp 1988's mediocre tally of 195 million
tons.
   U.S. experts predict the Soviets will harvest 215 million tons
of grain.
   ``This year, food grain harvests are enormous,'' Tass said,
reporting Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov's visit to a farming area
Tuesday.
   As one example, Tass said the Saratov region is producing 44 to
66 bushels per acre instead of the usual 6.6 to 8.8 bushels for the
same range.
   U.S. wheat yields this year are running at 38.6 bushels per
acre, according to the Department of Agriculture.
   Ryzhkov also visited neighboring northern Kazakhstan, where one
collective farm is producing three times as much grain as last
year, television news reported. But 250 railcars a day are needed
to haul it away, and officials are able to provide only half that
number.
   Farmers shown on Soviet television suggested the radical step of
allowing anyone to buy grain and store it themselves. Under Soviet
central planning, collective farms grow grain and sell it to the
state.
   Yeltsin's emergency measures permit farmers in Russia to sell on
the open market 30 percent of the grain they are under contract to
sell to the state at fixed prices, according to the government
newspaper Izvestia.
   Yeltsin also promised that anyone who works on the harvest would
be give special coupons allowing them to buy scarce consumer items.
   Soviet farms previously relied on temporary labor drafted from
urban factories to help with the harvest. But now that President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms call for factories to turn a profit,
they are refusing to send employees to the fields.
   Regional officials in Yaroslavl declared a state of emergency
and ordered local factories to provide labor to the farms, Izvestia
reported.
   In the southern republics of Georgia and Armenia, a blockade of
the railways has cut fuel deliveries to the farming areas that
produce much of the Soviet Union's fresh fruits and vegetables,
Tass news agency reported Tuesday.
   The blockade is aimed at enforcing promised multiparty reforms
in Georgia, Interfax said. It has cut all train routes into Georgia
and Armenia except those through Azerbaijan. Armenia is locked in a
deadly territorial dispute with Azerbaijan.
   Meanwhile, Tass reported Tuesday that Yeltsin, who is pushing
his republic to more radical reforms than those approved by
Gorbachev, has called a session of the Russian Congress for the end
of October. That session would consider the right to own land, to
inherit, purchase and sell it, Tass reported Tuesday.
   Gorbachev has called for long-term leasing of farmland but not
outright ownership with the inherent right to earn a profit on
buying and selling it, which is abhorrent to die-hard Communists.
   However, Gorbachev may be changing his views. Former Politburo
member Yegor Ligachev told reporters several weeks ago that he
split with Gorbachev because he could not agree with the Soviet
president's new support for private property.

<HEAD>Souter Resists Commenting on Abortion, Steinbrenner</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS grafs 8-10: ``Also while,'' report on Souter
opposition to EEOC rule.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Supreme Court nominee David H. Souter renewed
his low-profile tour of Senate offices Tuesday, even ducking a
reporter's question about exiled New York Yankee owner George
Steinbrenner.
   While chatting briefly with journalists outside one senator's
office, the New Hampshire judge was asked, ``Any kind words for
George Steinbrenner?''
   After laughing heartily, Souter resolutely skirted controversy
yet again. ``I wouldn't touch anything that hot,'' he replied.
   Steinbrenner was banned by the commissioner of baseball Monday
from any further involvement in the management or day-to-day
operations of the Yankees.
   Most of the questions thrown at Souter focused on Monday's
release by People for the American Way, a liberal group that
supports abortion rights, of a 1976 brief in which the New
Hampshire attorney general's office referred to abortion as ``the
killing of unborn children.''
   Souter, who was the state attorney general at the time, did not
author the brief. And the lawyer who did said Tuesday, ``I don't
recall him looking at the language, talking to me about the
argument or approving any line of argument.''
   Souter declined Tuesday to comment on the brief. Asked if he
thought it would play a role in his confirmation hearings set to
begin Sept. 13 before the Senate Judiciary Committee, he answered,
``You'll have to tell me.''
   Also while Souter was state attorney general he opposed a
federal civil rights regulation in 1976 that eventually was upheld
by the Supreme Court and was defended by the then-U.S. solicitor
general, Robert Bork, The Washington Post said in Wednesday
editions.
   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission rule required the
state to submit a racial breakdown of its employees, and Souter
argued that it treated ``every employer as if he were a suspected
bigot.''
   The rule made the state ``color conscious rather than
colorblind,'' Spouter argued, according to the newspaper report.
   Senators on both sides of the issue say Souter will be asked
about abortion during the September hearings.
   The Supreme Court is closely divided over the issue. Four of the
court's current eight members appear ready to overturn the 1973
decision in Roe vs. Wade that legalized abortion. That makes
Souter's potential vote a critical one.
   Souter paid courtesy visits Tuesday to four senators _
Republican Charles Grassley of Iowa and Democrats Dennis DeConcini
of Arizona, Tim Wirth of Colorado and Patrick Moynihan of New York.
   He was accompanied by Fred McClure, President Bush's
congressional liaison.
   Asked at one stop whether he had any criticism of the news
coverage seeking to discern his views on abortion and other issues,
Souter said, ``There's nothing I'd wish to say.... That's not an
endorsement.''
   Souter declined to predict how much time he would be spending in
the nation's capital in advance of the confirmation hearings. ``I
haven't worked out a schedule,'' he said.

   New Yorkers may not have heard the news over the
screech of subway trains, the boom of oversize car stereos and the
wail of firetruck sirens, but the nation's noisiest city is getting
even LOUDER.
   ``We're losing our hearing and we don't even know it!'' says
anti-noise activist Arline Bronzaft, a Lehman College psychology
professor who's conducted research on the effects of noise.
   On a recent morning she stood at an Upper East Side
intersection, decibel meter in hand, trying to be heard over the
rumble of trucks and buses.
   ``We're getting 90 decibels, and this isn't even Broadway,'' she
shouted.
   She crossed the street to where a jackhammer was pounding a
sidewalk. The meter hit 100.
   ``Noise is where cigarette smoking was 30 years ago,'' Bronzaft
says. ``Everybody knows it's bad for you, but a lot of people don't
do anything about it.''
   Prolonged exposure to 85 decibels or more can damage your inner
ear and cause permanent hearing loss, increase your blood pressure
and cholesterol, give you ulcers and indigestion.
   Even on a side street with no traffic Bronzaft's noise meter
ranged between 70 and 75, like a room with an loud air conditioner
or a quiet vacuum cleaner.
   Although there is no scientific evidence that New Yorkers are
particularly hard of hearing, studies have indicated that people
living in rural settings tend to lose less hearing over a lifetime
than those who live in cities.
   Samuel Stempler, director of the city's Bureau of Air Resources,
says New York is considered the nation's noisiest because of its
population density _ fourteen times that of any other city. And
it's getting noisier because of increased traffic and construction.
   Such increases and new sources of noise boost the average noise
level in the city by as much as a decibel a year, according to some
experts.
   ``If you want to put up a building you need an environmental
impact statement that says it will increase the noise level by no
more than two decibels,'' explains Bronzaft. ``But no one checks
after the building is built, and no one figures out the overall
affect of a lot of new buildings.''
   Noise seems to beget noise. Dr. Thomas Fay of Columbia
Presbyterian Medical Center says that as the city gets louder, so
must fire engine sirens to be heard over the din. Firefighters lose
more of their hearing, and demand even louder sirens.
   And there's always a new earache, such as ``boom cars'' _
vehicles equipped with huge speakers, sometimes filling the rear
floor space of hatchback cars.
   Bronzaft was visiting her mother the other day when one drove
past. ``Suddenly the whole house shook,'' she recalls. ``I thought
someone had turned on the radio full blast in the next room.''
   However, boom cars still rank behind the three airports, rush
hour traffic, air conditioners, discos, car alarms and horns,
construction and elevated subway tracks.
   The city's noise code, which prohibits casual honking and
construction noise between 6 p.m. and 7 a.m., is one of the
nation's strictest; the problem is enforcing it.
   New Yorkers file more than 16,000 noise complaints a year.
Bronzaft notes that last year the city Department of Environmental
Protection issued citations in response to only about 20 percent of
complaints.
   Stempler says his office has only 42 agents to cover noise and
air pollution complaints seven days a week, and police have other
things to do.
   Besides, he says, noise is ``a relative thing. What I perceive
as noise might be music to your ears.''

<HEAD>Furnace Export OK'd Despite Manufacturer's Warning, Documents Show</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Commerce Department approved the sale of
industrial furnaces to Iraq even though the manufacturer told U.S.
officials the items could be used to produce nuclear weapons
material, documents show.
   The White House intervened to block the sale of the furnaces
this month, effectively reversing the Commerce Department's earlier
decision.
   The action came as Congress passed sanctions against Iraq and
the administration weighed whether to restore Iraq to a list of
countries that support terrorism. U.S. officials believe that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein is seeking to develop nuclear weapons
technology.
   A senior State Department official said Tuesday that the United
States is placing new restrictions on exports of items to Iraq that
could be used for the Middle Eastern country's development of
missiles or chemical and biological weapons.
   Iraq's threats against neighboring Kuwait and its massing of
troops along the two countries' disputed border are just the latest
moves that are causing the administration ``grave concern,''
Assistant Secretary John H. Kelly told a House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee.
   Commerce Department officials had discussed the industrial
furnaces with officials of Consarc Corp., the Rancocas, N.J.-based
furnace manufacturer, several times in 1989, according to minutes
of the conversations obtained by The Associated Press.
   For instance, on Feb. 22, 1989, Consarc's president, Raymond
Roberts, and Tina Olnick, a company employee, held a meeting with
Alan C. Stoddart, a special agent from Commerce's Office of Export
Enforcement.
   ``Mr. Stoddart said the department's main concern is nuclear
non-proliferation,'' according to the minutes.
   The minutes continued: ``Mr. Roberts again stated that the
customer tells us they will be making titanium castings for making
medical prostheses.
   ``However, the equipment can be used (without modification) on
zirconium, for which the principal end use is nuclear.''
   Gary Milhollin, executive director of the Wisconsin Project on
Nuclear Arms Control, said the high-performance furnaces such as
the ones Iraq sought can be used for a number of purposes,
including melting plutonium for bomb cores and titanium for missile
nose cones.
   The Iraqis said the titanium, a lightweight metal, would be used
for artificial hip and knee joints for victims of the Persian Gulf
war with Iran.
   In a Feb. 15, 1989, conversation, Roberts told Jeff Tripp of the
Commerce Department that despite the Iraqi statement, ``there is
nothing to stop them from melting zirconium, the main use of which
is cladding material for nuclear fuel.''
   On March 15, 1989, Ms. Olnick, Consarc's contract administrator,
asked the Commerce Department whether the company needed a
``validated export license'' to ship the furnaces.
   An individual validated export license is generally needed to
export items like the furnaces that would appear to have a direct
nuclear capability, said a Commerce Department official who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   In the letter, Ms. Olnick said Consarc did not believe a
validated license was necessary but, ``We would appreciate an
assessment of the Department of Commerce.''
   She added: ``We have informed the customer that we will not
proceed with the project until we have received approval to export
the equipment in either the form of an assessment that an export
license is not required or an approved export license.''
   Roberts could not be reached by telephone Tuesday to discuss the
documents, but he said earlier his company had received permission
to ship furnaces to Iraq. Ms. Olnick said she could not talk about
the matter.
   Commerce Department officials have refused to talk about the
Consarc case.
   But after a furnace was seized by the Customs Service on a dock
in Philadelphia last month, U.S. officials said it would require
Consarc to obtain a validated license. It is unlikely such a
license will be granted, they said.
   The State Department has asked the Commerce Department to place
restrictions on export of items with potential weapons uses that
are much like the curbs already in place for nuclear technology,
according to Kelly's testimony Tuesday and congressional sources
briefed on the moves.
   The change would mean a license is required for any item that
could be destined for a program of chemical or biological weapons
development, or for use in developing missile delivery systems for
weapons, Kelly said.
   The restrictions should be put in place within the next month,
the State Department official said.

   Stripping away centuries of damask, marble and paint
in the apartment where Ignatius of Loyola worked and died,
restorers have discovered the simple way the saint lived his final
years.
   Today, his Jesuits opened the rooms to the public.
   To inaugurate the restored rooms on Tuesday, the 434th
anniversary of the Spaniard's death, the order chose a brief
ceremony of prayer led by Peter-Hans Kolvenbach, a Dutch priest who
is head of the Society of Jesus, the formal name of the Roman
Catholic order whose members began missions and universities
worldwide.
   Tourists will now be allowed to visit the four, small rooms in
what is now a Jesuit residence attached to the Church of Jesus,
where the saint is buried, in the heart of downtown.
   They'll be able to see the crudely finished poplar-and-fir desk
where Ignatius worked on the constitution for the order he founded
and stroll through the dining room where he chatted with his
missionaries before they headed for distant India or Central
America.
   There is even a pair of leather slippers believed to be the
saint's slippers.
   Visitors will discover that the man who traded nobility for
avowed poverty and chastity ``was a tired old man who shuffled
along in his bedroom slippers,'' trying to continue his religious
work while suffering badly from gallstones in his last years, said
the Rev. Thomas Lucas, a Jesuit from California who directed the
14-month-long restoration.
   Lucas lived in the residence in the early 1980s while a student.
   ``I was always embarrassed when friends came and asked to see
the rooms,'' whose walls were covered in the 19th and early 20th
century with red damask drapes and blocked by marble altars, said
Lucas.
   Before beginning the restoration, Lucas said, he read all 7,000
letters the saint had written while working in the apartment from
1544-1556.
   Now the walls are whitewashed, a wooden cabinet used by Ignatius
in his bedroom serves as a simple altar, and six layers of paint
were removed from the ceiling by a team of restorers headed by an
expert from the Vatican Museums.
   The $500,000 restoration was paid for by donations solicited by
Jesuits and grants from foundations, Lucas said. It is part of
preparations for the order's celebration of the 500th anniversary
next year of the saint's birth.
   The Jesuits, 25,000 strong, make up the church's largest order.
   Ignatius' apartment is across the street from Venezia Palace,
one of the residences of Pope Paul III, who approved the order's
constitution in 1540.
   Ignatius chose to live downtown to be where the action was,
Lucas said. The followers of Ignatius ``served the prostitutes,
daughters of prostitutes, taught the catechism on the streets.''
   His philosphy was ``go anywhere, do anything in service to the
church,'' Lucas said.
   Ignatius was aware of a deep faith in 1521 while reading about
the life of Jesus. The work was one of the few books in his house,
where he was recovering from a wound.
   He was imprisoned briefly during the Inquisition. He also tried
to go with his small band of followers to the Holy Land to convert
Moslems to Christianity, but warfare thwarted that plan and he
headed to Rome instead.
   In contrast to his austere final years, Ignatius is buried in a
golden tomb imbedded in a bronze-and-marble decorated altar in the
church, itself lighted by chandeliers and studded with precious
stones.

<HEAD>Experts Say Gene Therapy Could Cure Many Now Thought Incurable</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gene therapy, a new medical magic bullet in
the war on cancer, diabetes and many inherited disorders, could be
used on patients for the first time this fall.
   A federal panel approved the use of gene therapy for two
disorders on Tuesday and a National Institutes of Health scientist
said that if the technique works, it gives medicine a powerful new
way to cure the incurable.
   ``This is the first step in what probably will be a revolution
in medicine over the next two decades,'' said Dr. W. French
Anderson, an NIH researcher.
   A proposal by Anderson to use gene therapy to treat an inherited
immune system disorder and one by Dr. Steven Rosenberg to treat a
lethal skin cancer were approved by the Recombinant DNA Advisory
Committee at NIH.
   The proposals still must be approved by the Food and Drug
Administration, but experts said the NIH panel's OK is the most
crucial.
   Anderson said the plans by his team and by the Rosenberg team
were considered experimental models for the eventual widespread use
of gene therapy.
   ``These two proposals are the best ways to demonstrate that gene
therapy works,'' Anderson said. ``From here it should open up into
a broad range of therapies for cancer, AIDS, genetic disease and
cardiovascular disease.''
   Anderson said that if he and Rosenberg can prove the concept of
using curative genes to treat disease, there already are plans to
use similar systems to treat leukemia, hemophilia, diabetes,
aplastic anemia and cancers of the colon and the kidney.
   Rosenberg, also an NIH scientist, said his system of using genes
to make tumor-fighting blood cells could be adapted to treat nearly
every type of cancer. But first, he cautioned, it has to be proven
effective in the medical trials approved Tuesday.
   ``This is only important if it works,'' he said. ``This is very
new and one can never be sure what could happen.''
   Gerard J. McGarrity, chairman of the NIH panel, called the
approval ``historic.''
   ``What we're doing today is adding gene therapy to vaccines,
antibiotics and radiation in the medical arsenal,'' he said.
``Medicine has been waiting thousands of years for this.''
   Rosenberg said researchers should know within six months after
the treatments start whether or not the gene therapy works.
   Both Rosenberg nd Anderson said they expect FDA approval of
their proposals soon and will start treating patients by this fall.
   The therapies approved by the committee both involve
manipulating the fundamental genetic pattern within cells by
inserting genes that instruct the cells to produce new proteins.
These proteins can fight the disease directly, such as with cancer.
Or the proteins could combat disorders by restoring normal hormones
or enzymes that were missing.
   To create the cells used in gene therapy, scientists first
splice the desired gene into the genetic pattern of a harmless
virus. Target cells, such as lymphocyte blood cells, are cultured
so they multiply into billions. The cells then are exposed in test
tubes to the genetically altered virus.
   The virus infects the cells and inserts its genetic pattern,
which includes the transplanted gene, into the gene structure of
the cell. The target cells and their offspring will then contain
the new gene.
   Rosenberg plans to add a gene to a blood cell called the
tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte, or TIL.
   This cell will normally seek out and attack a cancerous tumor,
but it is not strong enough by itself to control the tumor.
   Rosenberg earlier developed a way to remove TIL cells from a
patient, multiply them in a test tube and then return the cells to
the patient's blood stream.
   This procedure has been used in patients with malignant
melanoma, a lethal skin cancer, and about half have improved. It is
the half who died that led Rosenberg to turn to gene therapy to
improve the technique.
   Rosenberg plans to insert into the TIL cells a gene that will
command the cells to produce a protein called tumor necrosis
factor. This protein kills tumor cells by blocking them from
establishing a blood supply.
   In effect, the genetically altered TIL cell will be turned into
a factory making a tumor-killing protein inside the tumor itself.
   Anderson and his team will use a slightly different technique to
correct a condition called severe combined immunodeficiency disease.
   This rare, inherited disorder occurs in children who are born
lacking a key gene in their white blood cells. Without this gene,
the cells cannot produce called adenosine deaminase, or ADA, which
is essential for a healthy immune system.
   Anderson plans to insert into white blood cells a gene that will
make ADA. The altered cells will then cause the patient's body to
build resistance to disease.

   An Army commando described as extremely
dangerous was at large Tuesday after escaping from marshals who
were taking him to court for an appearance in a rape case.
   Master Sgt. Marshall L. Brown, 37, has been a Green Beret, a
Ranger and most recently a member of the elite anti-terrorist Delta
Force. He took part in the failed raid to free U.S. hostages from
Iran.
   Brown, who escaped Monday, is considered ``very, very
dangerous,'' said Police Maj. Augustine Comella in Cranston, where
Brown is accused of raping two woman.
   Brown is charged with raping two Cranston women last year. He
also is charged with two rapes in North Carolina, where he was a
member of the Army Special Forces stationed at Fort Bragg.
   He escaped from two armed marshals as they took him and two
other prisoners from a station wagon to the Providence courthouse.
   Brown, who police described as an expert locksmith, was able to
free himself from his handcuffs while being taken to the courthouse
from jail, said Joseph DiNitto, a Corrections Department spokesman.
He broke away from marshals and ran. No shots were fired.
   The marshals report indicates they did not know with whom they
were dealing, according to officials at the Adult Correctional
Institution. Cranston police, however, said they informed both the
marshals and the Corrections Department of Brown's background.
   Brown, who faces life in prison if convicted, had been held at
the ACI without bail pending a pretrial hearing Monday.
   Brown, of Spring Lake, N.C., was attending a nine-week course at
the Naval Education and Training Center in Newport when Cranston
police arrested him on June 11, 1989.
   Following his arrest in Rhode Island, Brown was charged in North
Carolina with raping two Wake County women whose assailant had
scaled balconies to reach their second-floor apartments.
   He became a suspect in the North Carolina rapes based on the
accounts of the attacks the Rhode Island women gave. Brown was then
linked to the rapes through a DNA analysis performed by the FBI.
   ``He is still receiving military pay as a master sergeant in the
army,'' said Sgt. Jerry Hansen, of Fort Bragg. ``And depending on
the outcome of the civil case the military will decide what
jurisdiction it is going to have over him.''

<TEXT>
   The most sensitive issue of
Secretary of State James A. Baker III's trip to Mongolia this week
will be not policy or protocol, but prey.
   More than half of his three-day visit, which begins Thursday,
will be spent on a private hunting trip to the Gobi Desert in
southern Mongolia, which is rich in animal life, some of it rare
and endangered.
   Mongolian officials say Baker, as an honored guest, can hunt any
animal he wants. But a small brouhaha developed in Washington over
reports that he sought a rare animal.
   The Washington Post said Baker, an avid hunter, originally
wanted to go to the Altai Mountains of southwestern Mongolia to
hunt an argali sheep, famed for its curly horns and a difficult
target.
   D. Baatar, in charge of the safari department at Mongolia's
state tourism agency, Zhuulchin, said the government allows 25
argali sheep to be killed each year in the Altai. The cost per
hunter is $25,000, including transportation, guides, meals, and a
license to kill a second animal, an ibex.
   Argali are not endangered, according to George Schaller, science
director of the New York-based organization Wildlife Conservation
International, and a leading field biologist. Schaller, who
recently spent several months in the Gobi studying rare bears, said
argali are merely over-hunted in some areas.
   But the issue was sensitive enough that Baker decided instead to
head for the Gobi and seek a wild goat, the Post said. U.S.
officials in Ulan Bator say they don't know his target, or how much
the license will cost. Baker, not the U.S. government, will pay for
the hunting trip, they say.
   Baker's hunting plans appear to have caused no stir in Mongolian
conservation circles, which are divided on the ethics of allowing
foreign hunters to kill rare animals for much-needed hard currency.
   Every year, about 300 foreigners come to this little-developed
nation to hunt, providing the government with about $2 million,
Baatar said. Most are Americans, and some hunt animals Mongolians
themselves are not allowed to kill.
   Badam, an inspector at the Ministry of Nature and Environmental
Protection, and who like many Mongolians uses just one name, said
any citizen who kills a rare snow leopard except to defend himelf
or his herd faces a $500 fine. That represents nearly two year's
income for the average Mongolian.
   But the Communist Party newspaper Unen said last week the
Cabinet gave permission for three snow leopards to be killed by
foreign hunters, and an Austrian hunter had already killed one. The
report said the hunter had tried unsuccessfully last year and
returned this spring with three dogs and two assistants. The price
for the license was $16,000, it said.
   Goidyn Dembereldorj, the nature ministry's chief of
international scientific and technical cooperation, said he and
others at the ministry were taken by surprise.
   ``We should not continue it, I think,'' he said. But he said
Mongolian herdsmen complained recently that snow leopards are
becoming more numerous and are attacking their horses and cattle.
   There is no reliable count of snow leopards, which are nocturnal
and elusive. Estimates vary from 400 to 4,000.
   Tserendeleg, vice president of the Union for the Conservation of
Nature and the Environment, refused to comment on the snow leopard
killing. But he said he has asked the Swiss-based International
Union for the Conservation of Nature, which favors protecting snow
leopards, to help compensate herdsmen whose livestock are killed by
the leopards.
   So far, the union has not responded, he said.

   Imagine Las Vegas with snow at 30 below.
Or Atlantic City with moose and spruce.
   Alaska voters Aug. 28 consider a measure to legalize casino
gambling, including blackjack, roulette, poker, craps, slot
machines and horse and dog racing.
   Alaska's history is rich with tales of gamblers during the wild
and woolly Gold Rush years of the late 1800s. Later, during the
territorial years, gambling was largely tolerated even where it was
illegal.
   But times have changed. Support is said to be weak for turning
Alaska into a Vegas North, and the measure has received little
promotion. Its backers have taken no contributions and plan no
media campaign, sponsor Jeffrey Macktaz said.
   Gov. Steve Cowper, a Democrat, has argued gambling would lead to
more crime, corruption and other social ills.
   ``My guess is not one voter in 10 in Alaska sees this coming,''
he said last week. ``The initiative, if it's passed, threatens to
change Alaska into something radically different from what it is
today.''
   The measure would allow gambling in a community only if local
voters authorized it. A five-member board would regulate the
industry. Licenses would be granted only to municipalities, state
agencies or people holding a liquor license.
   Supporters say gambling would provide jobs and a stable source
of income as oil revenues decline. The measure provides for set
percentages of gambling profits to go to the state and
municipalities where the gaming takes place.
   ``We just feel there is some merit to having legalized gambling
in Alaska to attract tourism and using the proceeds of that to help
the economy,'' Macktaz said.
   Cowper said any economic benefits would be offset by increases
in crime, the costs of regulating the industry and damage to the
state's image as a wilderness vacation destination.
   ``Legalized gambling imposes social problems of a massive nature
wherever it's conducted,'' the governor said. Those problems
include child neglect, drug and alcohol abuse, property crimes and
political corruption, Cowper said.
   He said Alaska ``would have to hire a massive number of
regulators and auditors. We would have to have a fully staffed
gambling board. We would have to hire a lot of new police officers.
We would have to build new jail space.''
   An anti-gambling group, the Alaskan ``No Dice'' Organizing
Committee, said in a pamphlet: ``Most of us came here because we
were attracted to the spectacular scenery, the opportunity to live
off the abundant natural resources, the hunting and fishing, the
wilderness and down-home people. Bringing people here to herd them
into 24-hour neon jungle will not bring our type of people.''
   Macktaz said gaming in Alaska would not lead to Las Vegas-style
casino developments. ``Big-time casinos wouldn't be that interested
in Alaska, considering our population and the difficulty in getting
here,'' he said.
   The casinos probably would be smaller developments competing
with Lake Tahoe, Nev., where tourists can enjoy outdoor activities
by day and take in floor shows at night, said Macktaz, who runs a
concert production company.

<HEAD>Rubber Tapper Says Plotters of Chico Mendes Killing Still at Large
^By PETER MUELLO
^Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A successor to slain Amazon
environmentalist Chico Mendes says the men who planned that killing
continue to threaten witnesses and rubber tappers.
   Osmarino Amancio Rodrigues, 33, said Tuesday that rubber tappers
believe a group of businessmen and ranchers masterminded the Mendes
shooting but were never called to testify in the case.
   ``The head of the snake was not hit,'' Rodrigues told a group of
foreign journalists. ``Those who planned it are still at large.''
   Mendes, a rubber tapper who led a movement to stop destruction
of the rain forest, was shot to death on Dec. 22, 1988, at his home
in the western Amazon town of Xapuri.
   A cattle rancher and his sons were arrested for the shooting.
They have not yet been brought to trial.
   Rodrigues said four rubber tappers have been shot to death in
the region since Mendes was slain. One victim, Jose Brito, had been
slated to testify in the trial.
   ``He was going to testify how Chico Mendes' death was planned,''
Rodrigues said. ``But two guys on a motorcycle shot him down right
on the street.''
   Those who oppose the ranchers get frequent anonymous death
threats, he said: ``They call up and say, `Is Chico Mendes OK?
How'd you like to be ``OK'' like Chico?'''
   A prime target is Rodrigues himself, he said. As president of
the rubber tappers union in Brasileia, near Xapuri, he has emerged
as a leader of conservationist movement, carrying on Mendes'
struggle to save the Amazon jungle from destruction.
   Rodrigues is constantly accompanied by four union bodyguards
plus a police escort but said he still doesn't feel safe.
   He sharply criticized the Amazon policy of President Fernando
Collor de Mello, who took office in March.
   Collor got high marks from conservationists for nominating
renowned ecologist Jose Lutzenberger as Environment Secretary and
ordering the expulsion of gold miners from Indian reservations.
   But Rodrigues said there have been few practical results.
   Rodrigues said the government must learn that the rain forest
can be profitably developed without destroying it. Slash-and-burn
clearing by ranchers and farmers has destroyed an estimated 8
percent of the 2 million-square-mile Amazon wilderness.
   Rubber, Brazil nuts, cocoa and tropical fruits are abundant in
the Amazon but often rot for lack of processing or transportation,
he said.
   Rodrigues has toured Europe and the United States to raise money
for the conservation movement. Despite many pledges of funds, not a
cent has reached Brazil yet, he said.
   Foreign aid will help environmentalists stand up to ranchers,
mining interests and loggers who buy the votes of the poor and
control local politics, Rodrigues said.

   A fogbank as thick as those that blanket
President Bush's oceanside home in Maine on summer mornings is
rolling in to obscure his planned fall campaign offensive. And this
time he won't have radar to help guide him.
   Bush was enveloped in a thick fog, the real kind, early last
Sunday when he went out for an early-morning spin in his speedboat
in the Atlantic and soon lost sight of land.
   A small orange Coast Guard boat laden with radar and other
sophisticated navigation equipment helped to escort the president
and his briefly disoriented Secret Service escorts back to safety.
   Aghast at fast-growing rumors _ fed by confusing radio traffic
overheard by local boaters _ that the president had been
temporarily lost at sea, the White House quickly issued a statement
asserting that the chief executive had never been in danger. Nor
lost.
   But navigating the political waters without losing his way is
likely to be even more challenging.
   With traditional Republican rallying beacons blurred by
international and fiscal realities, Bush may find himself wandering
around the country in September and October praising Democratic
leaders, backing new taxes and defending cuts in defense spending.
   That's not exactly the kind of red-meat rhetoric that inspires
Republicans to jump to their feet and open their wallets.
   But much has happened since Bush in 1988 told audiences ``read
my lips _ no new taxes,'' asserted that the Cold War still raged
and called for maintaining the defense buildup of the Reagan years.
   Faced with an annual budget deficit of $169 billion, the
president abandoned his campaign vow against new taxes and
initiated a search for a bipartisan package of $50 billion in new
taxes and spending cuts. But in so doing, he immediately lost the
Republicans' favorite perennial issue _ portraying Democrats as the
party of higher taxes.
   Bush even toned down his GOP speeches last week after Democrats
complained that they were too partisan and threatened to undermine
yet-to-materialize progress in budget talks.
   He even started praising a onetime nemesis, House Majority
Leader Richard Gephardt, for the Missouri Democrat's role in the
budget negotiations.
   The dismantling of the Berlin Wall and the crumbling of the
Soviet empire have taken away defense spending as a key 1990 issue.
   Even as Bush toured an MX missile site in Wyoming and praised
nuclear readiness, his own Pentagon was charting a wide array of
defense cuts.
   Bush also will likely steer away from the emotional abortion
issue _ even though he mentioned his own anti-abortion stance
frequently in 1988.
   The less he says about the subject the better it will be for
confirmation chances of his Supreme Court nominee, David Souter,
whose lack of a record on abortion may be his biggest selling point.
   Furthermore, Republican strategists are mindful of the drubbing
that anti-abortion GOP candidates took in gubernatorial races last
year in New Jersey and Virginia.
   The savings and loan crisis _ which touches both Democrats and
Republicans _ is certainly a no-win issue for the president if
there ever was one, particularly in light of the role of his son
Neil in the collapse of a Denver S&amp;L.
   So what's left for Bush to talk about?
   Well, for one thing _ there's TV actress Roseanne Barr's
shrieking rendition of the national anthem last week in San Diego.
   ``My reaction is, it was disgraceful,'' Bush declared.
   And there's always broccoli. He told a GOP audience in
Philadelphia last week that he wasn't about to change his
opposition to the dreaded green vegetable.
   Bush hasn't done much to lift the political fog.
   ``We all know that the Democrats have a long track record on
spending,'' he told a Republican gathering. ``But if the Berlin
Wall could come down in the same year that America goes nuts over
the Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles, who knows who could happen
next?''
   Actually, Bush may end up reconsidering his decision to spend
almost all September and much of October on the campaign trail.
   Efforts to reach a bipartisan budget accord will go into
high-gear in September, given the near-certainty that one won't be
forged before the August congressional recess.
   Bush may find himself out talking about Ninja Turtles and
broccoli to less-than-enthusiastic audiences as major defense cuts
and new taxes are being decided back in Washington.

<HEAD>Farm Prices Have Leveled Off, But Still Up From Last Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices of commodities at the farm have leveled
off this summer, but the Agriculture Department says the overall
index is still up from a year ago.
   Moreover, a department analyst said Tuesday, consumers are
seeing food prices rise faster than had been predicted earlier in
the year.
   Prices at the farm were unchanged from June to July, the USDA
said Tuesday. The index was 2.7 percent above a year ago, however.
   Prices were higher during the month for lettuce, apples and
milk, but declines were reported for cattle, wheat and eggs, the
department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its preliminary
report.
   Most prices are mid-July averages which will be revised this
month. For example, the latest report showed June prices dropped 2
percent instead of the 1.3 percent decline indicated a month ago.
   The report also showed prices farmers pay to meet expenses were
up 0.5 percent from April, when the previous estimate was made, and
3.4 percent above July 1989. The ``prices paid'' index is computed
quarterly.
   Ralph L. Parlett Jr. of the department's Economic Research
Service said a new 1990 forecast due out this month will ``put us
right back to the early 1980s'' when retail food prices were
climbing sharply.
   Earlier, the agency had forecast retail food prices would
probably go up 3 percent to 5 percent this year. And some have
recently talked about a rise of 4 percent to 6 percent.
   According to USDA records, annual food price increases were 8.6
percent in 1980 and 7.9 percent in 1981 before slowing their upward
rise in the next few years.
   Parlett did not disclose the new forecast but indicated the 1990
increase would probably exceed 6 percent. Food prices rose 5.8
percent in 1989, the most since 1981.
   ``It's obvious that 3-to-5 percent forecast is out in left
field,'' he said. ``Beef and pork, that's what's doing it; pork,
particularly.''
   Recent forecasts show the net cash income of farmers in the
range of $55 billion to $59 billion, compared with about $54
billion in 1989. The record was $57.2 billion in 1988.
   Net cash income is the money nationally that farmers have left
from gross cash income during a calendar year after deducting cash
expenses. It includes government payments and proceeds from crops
grown previously but sold during the year.
   In another method taking into account changes in inventories,
depreciation and other allowances during a calendar year shows that
1990 net farm income may be in a range of $47 billion to $51
billion, compared with $49 billion last year.
   Based on the preliminary figures, the July price index for
livestock and poultry dropped 1.2 percent from June but still
averaged 8.9 percent more than a year ago. Meat animals were down
1.5 percent from June but averaged 11 percent more than in June
1989.
   Milk prices rose 30 cents in July to an average of $14.10 per
l00 pounds. That was up $1.50 from July 1989. The farm price of
milk rose to a record $16 per hundredweight in December before
easing down.
   Crop prices, overall, rose 1.6 percent from June but averaged
4.4 percent below the year-earlier level.
   Vegetable prices rose 20 percent from June but were down 14
percent from a year earlier. Lettuce, tomatoes and sweet corn led
the July increase.
   Fruit prices were up 7.9 percent from June and 13 percent above
a year ago. Apples, grapefruit and peaches rose in July, while
oranges, pears and lemons were down.
   Wheat prices, pressured by a bumper harvest, dropped 27 cents
during the month to $2.81 per bushel.
   Feed grains declined, with corn prices down two cents from June
to $2.61 per bushel.
   The report said:
   _Cattle averaged $97 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally,
down from $98.10 in June but up from $94.60 in July 1989. Those are
averages for all types of cattle sold as beef.
   _Hogs averaged $60.10 per 100 pounds, unchanged from June but up
from $45.90 in July 1989.
   _Corn, at $2.61 a bushel, was down from $2.63 in June but up
from $2.47 a year earlier.
   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $2.81 per bushel, compared with $3.08 in June and $3.78 a
year earlier.
   _Rice averaged $7.10 per 100 pounds, compared with $7.08 in June
and $7.45 in July 1989.
   _Soybeans were $5.88 per bushel, unchanged from June but down
from $6.83 a year earlier.
   _Upland cotton was reported at 63.7 cents per pound, compared
with 62.3 in June and 59.5 a year earlier.
   _Eggs were 55.6 cents per dozen, compared with 62.7 in June and
64.9 in July 1989.
   _Milk was $14.10 per 100 pounds, up from $13.80 in June and the
average of $12.60 a year ago.
   _Broilers were 36.9 cents per pound, live weight, compared with
34.1 cents in June and 38.7 cents a year earlier.

<HEAD>Republicans Say Levin Too Liberal for Michigan Mainstream</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF HOLYFIELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two Republicans out to oust Sen. Carl
Levin are trying to paint the two-term Democrat as too liberal for
mainstream Michigan.
   But first, each challenger wants to convince voters he's the
right Republican to consider as a replacement for Levin.
   So far, the Michigan Senate race has been a three-man parade in
which Levin leads the lineup without bothering to glance back at
the two Republicans.
   Next in line is three-term Rep. Bill Schuette, who has made
heavy use of the liberal label as he shores up his position as the
heavy favorite in Tuesday's GOP primary.
   Bringing up the rear is the other GOP contender, attorney Clark
Durant, who sees both Levin and Schuette as part of the same
problem.
   Durant casts both men as Washington insiders who don't have the
political courage to fight the establishment and seek innovative
solutions to the nation's woes.
   Levin doesn't have a primary opponent and has raked in $5
million so far to defend his seat.
   Durant and Schuette say Levin is vulnerable because his liberal
views are out of step with Michigan.
   Levin's backers counter that his views haven't changed since
voters sent him to the Senate 12 years ago. On top of that, the GOP
hasn't won a Senate race in Michigan since 1972.
   The Durant-Schuette race has been a low-key contest, waged
mainly in the party trenches, but both campaigns hope to change
that with television ads in the final week.
   Schuette has been running ads for more than a month, and
Durant's campaign said their ads would begin today and run through
the election.
   Durant tried to engage Schuette into a series of debates across
of the state. But Schuette said he'd debate only if Durant would
release his income tax returns and pledge to follow a ``no negative
attack'' course.
   As set out by Schuette's campaign, that would bar Durant from
mentioning Schuette's name or record in his ads.
   ``What am I running against here, a ghost?'' Durant responded.
   ``The question Republicans have to ask themselves is whose ideas
are best going to offer a contrast to Carl Levin and who's best
equipped to take on Carl Levin,'' Durant said. ``I want the people
to decide and Bill won't engage in that.''
   Schuette insists Durant isn't his focus and shouldn't be.
   ``I'm running against Carl Levin,'' he said. ``Beating Carl
Levin is the goal here, not beating up on other Republicans.''
   Schuette is a boyish-looking 36-year-old with the husky voice of
a late-night disc jockey. He established himself as a rising GOP
star in 1984 when he did the near impossible and ousted incumbent
Democratic Rep. Don Albosta.
   He's the favorite of the Republican establishment and has close
ties to President Bush that began when he served as a top operative
for Bush's 1980 campaign.
   Yet Schuette broke with the president when Bush broke his ``read
my lips, no new taxes'' pledge.
   ``We have a difference of opinion,'' Schuette said. ``I'm
nobody's boy.''
   He plays up his experience in Congress, in unseating Albosta and
hits hard on the conservative Republican line of keeping taxes low,
a strong defense, and easing government regulation to let the
economy grow.
   He also focuses on what he calls ``defining issues'' _ crime,
drugs, and Levin's opposition to capital punishment _ to support
his contention that the senator's views are out of step with
Michigan voters.
   Durant lumps Schuette and Levin together as part of the
Washington establishment that he says is paralyzed by special
interests and their campaign contributions.
   Durant says that as a rock-solid conservative outsider, he'd be
a stronger GOP opponent for Levin. He emphasizes cutting taxes and
government regulation to give people more control over their lives
and wallets.
   The campaign carries faint echoes of the 1988 presidential wars
that nearly shredded the Michigan Republican Party. That fight
pitted the GOP establishment backing George Bush against the more
conservative and populist-oriented factions led by Jack Kemp and
Pat Robertson.
   Durant, a national co-chairman for Kemp, helped lead the
``Anybody But Bush'' drive of Kemp and Robertson supporters that
eventually lost.
   Some Bush backers held a grudge against Durant, but that has
faded as he's campaigned hard to win support in all three camps,
his campaign says.
   Schuette campaign director Douglas McAuliffe said his campaign
has done its best to forget about 1988 and unite the party.
   ``Bill Schuette has been saying this over and over: There's a
new level of maturity in the Michigan Republican Party. They
haven't won a U.S. Senate race since 1972 and they're tired of
losing,'' he said.

   Nolan Ryan won his 300th game Tuesday night,
pitching the Texas Rangers to an 11-3 victory over the Brewers and
adding to the legend of the man who's still throwing fastballs at
age 43.
   Ryan, who is the game's all-time strikeout leader and has a
record six no-hitters, became the 20th major leaguer to get 300
victories. Except for spitballer Gaylord Perry, every pitcher to
win that many games has been elected to the Hall of Fame after
becoming eligible five years after retirement.
   Ryan, who has won 11 games and lost four this season, allowed
six hits in 7 2-3 innings. He struck out eight, increasing his
career total to 5,219, walked two and threw 146 pitches.
   It was not the overpowering, classic Ryan, but it counted. And
it also served to bring baseball's focus back to the field, one day
after New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner was disciplined.
In fact, commissioner Fay Vincent stayed away from County Stadium,
perhaps not wanting to steal attention from Ryan.
   The crowd of 51,533, largest of the season in Milwaukee,
included 15 of Ryan's family and friends and Rangers owner George
Bush, son of the president. They gave a standing ovation when he
walked to the dugout before the game and loudly cheered him
throughout the evening.
   Flash bulbs popped all during the night and ``300'' signs dotted
the ballpark. At Ryan's home field in Texas, there were 7,828
people in the stands to watch the game on the scoreboard at
Arlington Stadium, and fans across the country tuned in the game on
TV.
   With Texas leading 5-1 in the eighth, two errors by second
baseman Julio Franco and two singles led to two unearned runs,
sabotaging Ryan's chance to finish with the complete game he wanted
so much.
   Brad Arnsberg relieved, preserving a 5-3 lead and the win for
Ryan.

<HEAD>Experts Say Events in Liberia and Trinidad Show Gadhafi Unchanged</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although he is more discreet nowadays, Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi is still promoting revolutionary movements
around the world _ as recent events in both Liberia and Trinidad
demonstrate, U.S. officials and private analysts say.
   ``I don't think they (the Libyans) have been less active,
they've been less conspicuous,'' said Robert Kuppermann, a
terrorism specialist at the Washington-based Center for Strategic
and International Studies.
   Charles Lichenstein, a distinguished fellow at the Heritage
Foundation, also a Washington think tank, said Gadhafi is more
prudent than he was during the early 1980s but otherwise hasn't
changed much.
   He is still ``one of the great security threats that we have to
contend with,'' Lichenstein said.
   A State Department official, asking not to be identified, said
the Trinidad government rejected a request months ago for the
import of ``medical supplies'' from Libya, suspecting that the
shipment actually consisted of weapons.
   Over the past several days, Gadhafi's long reach has been
demonstrated by the bloody upheavals under way in both Liberia and
Trinidad _ two countries where rebel leaders have acknowledged
receiving assistance from the North African leader.
   The Bush administration has sought to minimize the extent of
Gadhafi's involvement in the two countries.
   Officials described Charles Taylor, a Liberian rebel leader and
Gadhafi ally, as an opportunist with no particular philosophical
underpinning. He appears to have sought out Gadhafi for help
because he had nowhere else to turn, they said.
   As for the revolt in Trinidad, the State Department has said
that although Gadhafi has provided training to the insurgents,
there is no indication of a direct Libyan involvement in the
seizure last Friday night of Trinidad's prime minister and dozens
of other officials.
   Why Liberia and Trinidad?
   Lichenstein suggested that Liberia is an attractive target for
Gadhafi because of the large array of U.S. military and
communications facilities in the West African country.
   He added that in the event of a rebel success in Trinidad,
Gadhafi could use that country as a ``launching pad'' for
destabilizing other Caribbean countries.
   Gadhafi seems less of a preoccupation for the United States now
than he was in 1986 after U.S. authorities concluded that he was
behind the bombing of a West Berlin discotheque frequented by
Americans. A U.S. Army sergeant was killed in the incident.
   President Reagan retaliated by ordering U.S. jet fighters to
bomb Tripoli and Benghazi.
   Apparently chastened, Gadhafi virtually disappeared for an
extended period but he eventually ``shook it off,'' Lichenstein
said.
   Lichenstein said Gadhafi, nurtured by oil revenues, is
continuing to support dozens of other rebel organizations,
particularly radical Palestinian groups.
   ``His hand is still involved in various groups we don't know
about,'' Lichenstein said.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Approves Proposal for Airline Child Safety Seats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Infants and toddlers would be required to sit
in child safety seats on airline flights under legislation heading
to the Senate floor.
   The measure, approved Tuesday by the Commerce Committee, would
order the Federal Aviation Administration to require the seats on
domestic airline flights. It would be left to the FAA to decide a
height and weight limit for children needing the seats.
   The committee approved the bill on a voice vote and sent it to
the full Senate. No date has been scheduled for its consideration.
   ``This is a great step forward for this bill. We cannot continue
to treat our youngest airline passengers like second-class citizens
when it comes to airline safety,'' said Sen. Christopher Bond,
R-Mo., who sponsored the legislation.
   Currently, infants under 2 can fly free by traveling on the laps
of a parent or guardian.
   All of the major airlines permit infants to travel in safety
seats, which are attached to a regular airline seat, and generally
charge a reduced fare comparable to that for children between ages
2 and 12. Unticketed infants usually can use a vacant seat at no
cost.
   The airlines' Air Transport Association, airline unions and
consumer groups have advocated mandatory safety restraints,
generally for children under age 2.
   The legislation stemmed from the death of a 23-month-old child
in a crash-landing of an airliner last year at Sioux City, Iowa.
The accident killed 112 people. Three other children under age 2
were injured.
   A similar proposal by Rep. Jim Lightfoot, R-Iowa, is pending in
the House.
   The National Transportation Safety Board has recommended that
approved safety seats be required for children under 40 inches in
height or weighing less than 40 pounds.
   The FAA has said it would consider mandatory restraints but has
proposed a regulation only to require that airlines allow child
seats on board if passengers want to use them _ the practice
already followed by the industry.
   The FAA, in testimony before a House panel in mid-July, said
requiring child seats would end up costing more lives than it would
save. It estimated that the expense of buying tickets for infants
would cause more families to travel by automobile and lead to
increased numbers of traffic deaths and injuries.
   The Senate bill also calls for the United States to seek a
similar child safety seat requirement for international flights
from the International Civil Aviation Organization.

<HEAD>Energy Department Seeks to Reassure Congress on Nuclear Waste Site</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department says it's putting some
of the best scientific minds to work on the problem, but a senator
compares the effort to three witches chanting over a bubbling
caldron.
   The subject: highly radioactive wastes that have been stored for
decades at the Hanford nuclear weapons facility in Washington state.
   There is increasing concern some of the tanks might explode and
no one seems to know exactly what chemicals are inside _ or what
years of radiation have done to them.
   ``The Hanford tanks present a serious situation, if not an
imminent hazard,'' cautions the Energy Department's Advisory
Committee on Nuclear Facility Safety.
   John Ahearne, a physicist and the panel's chairman, told a
Senate hearing Tuesday that he's not ready to accept Energy
Department officials' assurances that the dangers of an explosion
are low. ``There's too much uncertainty,'' he said. ``There is an
urgent need to determine what is in the tanks.''
   For decades highly radioactive wastes were poured into
underground tanks on the Hanford atomic weapons reservation, a
560-square-mile complex in south-central Washington where plutonium
was processed for years for the nation's weapons program.
   ``We're trying to find out what's in the existing tanks,'' Leo
Duffy, the Energy Department official in charge of cleanup
activities at atomic waste sites, told the senators. He said some
of the best scientists were trying to close ``a huge gap'' in
information.
   Nevertheless, Duffy called the situation under control.
   But several senators were not as certain.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, chairman of the Governmental Affairs
Committee, likened it to ``trying to manage a potential bomb''
without knowing exactly what you're dealing with.
   And Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., calling for a more scientific
approach, said the effort to date reminded him of ``three witches
with a bubbling caldron, saying `bubble, bubble, toil and trouble.'
They're stirring it and don't seem to know what's in there.''
   Last March the Energy Department for the first time disclosed
that it was worried about a chemical explosion in some of the
tanks. There was concern that secondary chemical reactions might
burst the tanks and release large amounts of radioactive materials.
   That concern was expressed even more strongly by the advisory
board headed by Ahearne in a letter July 23 to Energy Secretary
James Watkins. The letter was made public by Glenn's committee
Tuesday.
   ``The technical basis for the analysis from which the (Hanford)
operator draws comfort about the safety of the tanks is weak,
considering the potential consequences,'' the advisory panel said.
``Each successive review of the Hanford tanks indicates that the
situation is a little worse.''
   Plant operators and senior DOE officials have ``only sketchy
information on conditions in the tanks'' with no clear knowledge of
the chemical reactions going on in the tanks and unreliable
temperature sensors, the panel continued.
   ``There is an urgent need to determine what is in the tanks,
what are the risks and what actions should be taken to ameliorate
the hazards,'' the letter said.
   An accident involving similarly stored wastes in the Soviet
Union in 1957 released huge amounts of radiation and contaminated
an area covering hundreds of square miles, forcing the evacuation
of 10,000 people.
   To this day, children are not allowed near the areas that were
heavily contaminated, and agricultural crops from the region are
not allowed to be sold elsewhere, officials said.
   But Duffy said the Soviet site is not the same as the Hanford
plant.
   Highly radioactive wastes also are stored in tanks at the
Savannah River weapons plant near Aiken, S.C., and at a plant near
West Valley, N.Y., but those tanks contain different chemicals and
do not pose the same risks as the tanks at Hanford, officials have
said.

<HEAD>FDIC Chairman Sounds Alarm on Shrinking Reserves in Bank Fund</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto WX7</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amid growing congressional furor over the cost
of the savings and loan bailout, a top federal regulator is
sounding an alarm over shrinking reserves in the fund backing
commercial bank deposits.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., told the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday that ``it would
not be unreasonable'' to predict a $2 billion loss in the bank fund
this year.
   Meanwhile, at the Capitol, the House voted 424-4 Tuesday to
toughen criminal penalties for rip-offs by savings and loan
officials and to create a special prosecutor and a national
commission on the S&amp;L debacle.
   Seidman said the bank fund lost $851 million in 1989 and $4.24
billion in 1988 as bank failures soared to post-Depression highs.
   Nevertheless, Seidman said the fund, which is maintained through
an insurance premium paid by banks, should be able to pay for any
foreseeable bank failures without help from taxpayers.
   ``At this point, (looking at) the banks we can actually count on
failing, we believe we have the resources to handle them, but that
still would put us in a very much stressed position,'' he said.
   The 1989 and 1988 losses reduced insurance backing $2.5 trillion
in deposits at the nation's 12,500 banks to 70 cents per $100 of
deposits, ``the lowest point in modern history,'' Seidman said.
   With another loss this year, coverage could slip to 50 cents or
60 cents per $100, less than half the agency's target of $1.25 per
$100, he said.
   Seidman's comments were his most pessimistic yet concerning the
bank fund. Only two months ago, he said the fund could post a small
profit absent major bank failures in 1990.
   Seidman indicated the FDIC board may consider an emergency hike
in insurance premiums paid by banks. Those premiums, as provided by
last year's savings and loan bill, are already increasing, from 8.3
cents per $100 of deposits in 1989 to 12 cents this year and 15
cents next year.
   However, the board has the power to raise them as high as 22.5
cents next year. Each 1 cent increase brings the fund about $250
million.
   ``Our board will be monitoring this very carefully and obviously
that is an action they will be looking at,'' he said.
   Seidman said his revised assessment of the insurance fund was
based on a general deterioration of the value of commercial real
estate held by banks, not on any new projection of a major bank
failure.
   So far this year, 113 banks have failed. Last year, 207 banks
failed or required federal assistance to stay open, down slightly
from a post-Depression record of 221 in 1988.
   ``Very frankly we have probably the weakest real estate markets
overall that we've had for quite a few years,'' he said, adding
that the weakness has spread from regional pockets in the Southwest
and New England to include most areas of the country.
   However, Kenneth Guenther of the Independent Bankers Association
of America, a trade group, said Seidman's reassessment indicates
``there are shoals under the water'' and the agency is planning for
a major bank failure.
   ``I wonder where the big bank hits are going to come from. ...
Are some of the major Texas deals going sour?'' Guenther said.
   The legislation that passed the House would increase the maximum
prison terms _ up to life in prison for the worst offenders _ and
boost fines that could be levied against individuals and
institutions convicted of savings and loan crimes.
   It would also create new felony categories to close loopholes
for those who conceal assets from the government or who try to
obstruct government inquiries into financial institutions, and give
the government new authority to go after the assets of failed S&amp;Ls.
   The bill would authorize adding $153 million to the federal
government's law enforcement efforts, and create a ``special
counsel'' within the Justice Department to oversee a new Financial
Institutions Fraud Unit.
   Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas, one of the
few to vote against the measure, said proponents hoped the measure
would ``fool the American people'' that the crisis was being solved.
   The Senate passed its version of a savings and loan crackdown as
part of an overall crime bill. The two chambers must reconcile
their differences before a bill can be sent to the president.

<HEAD>Did Pesticide Attack Stop Locusts, or Just Weather?</HEAD>

   Five years after a plague of locusts hit
Africa, a congressional report says it's still unclear whether the
plague was stopped by a four-year, $275 million international
pesticide attack or just by the weather.
   A 130-page report released Tuesday by Congress' Office of
Technology Assessment failed to resolve whether the weather, or the
massive pesticide effort, should get credit for stopping the plague.
   In 1985, locusts and grasshoppers attacked 23 countries from
Portugal to Tanzania, and from Iran to the Atlantic. In 1988,
Hurricane Gilbert blew fragments of locust swarms to the Yucatan
coast of Mexico, though apparently they did little damage there.
   ``Some claim this is the first time a desert locust plague has
been stopped in its tracks and that the control program deserves
full credit ... They seem to be right,'' the report said.
   ``Yet, others contend that the weather contributed more than
control to the insects' decline ... They also seem to be right.''
   Of the 46 governments and 12 international organizations that
joined in the attack, the United States contributed the largest
amount, giving nearly $59 million from the Agency for International
Development.
   Andrew Natsios, who heads the agency's Office of Foreign
Disaster Assistance, said the control program was a success, though
he acknowledged weather may have had something to do with the
fading of the threat. He called the report self-contradictory.
   ``None of the people on the survey ever went to Africa,'' he
said.
   The report praised the agency for coordinating efforts of other
U.S. agencies, international donors and African officials. But it
suggested that too much pesticide was used _ about 3.4 million
gallons _ and that there ought to be more research on how to use
the pests' own habits against them.
   So far, scientists have not found ways to do that.

<HEAD>Justice Department Studying Wider Impact Of North Decision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department is concerned that
Oliver North's victory before an appeals court could have a wider
impact affecting other cases involving defendants who testify under
a similar promise of immunity.
   Officials are reviewing the decision, which held that the trial
judge did not take proper steps to determine if North's
congressional testimony influenced his trial, said Justice
Department spokesman Dan Eramian.
   The department does not have a direct interest in the North case
because the former White House aide was prosecuted by independent
counsel Lawrence E. Walsh.
   In a 2-1 decision last month, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in Washington ordered a ``witness-by-witness'' and review of the
evidence presented at North's trial to determine if it was
``tainted'' by references to the testimony the former White House
aide gave under a limited grant of immunity from prosecution.
   That ``use immunity'' barred Walsh from using any of North's
testimony or information derived from it to prosecute the former
Marine lieutenant colonel.
   Eramian said Justice Department prosecutors were concerned about
the case's impact in a limited number of cases in which a defendant
is prosecuted after testifying before Congress amidst widespread
publicity.
   Justice Department officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the decision could have more widespread
applications, as in case where courts or grand juries grant ``use
immunity.'' The procedural requirements set down by the court could
be impossible for prosecutors to meet, the officials said.
   Eramian stressed that the department was not necessarily
considering participating in any appeal that Walsh might undertake.
But if Walsh appeals the decision, the Justice Department could
file a brief stating its legal position.
   Walsh has more than a month to decide whether to appeal the
ruling to the full appellate court or ask the Supreme Court to
review the issue.
   North's week-long appearance on Capitol Hill in 1987 received
widespread television and newspaper coverage, which his lawyers
contend affected the memories of witnesses in the case.
   The former National Security Council aide was placed on
probation and ordered to perform 1,500 hours of community service
for his three felony convictions.
   Some legal experts say the decision by two appellate judges
appointed by President Reagan radically extended a 1972 Supreme
Court decision that prohibits prosecutors from introducing a
defendant's compelled testimony as evidence.
   ``What they did in this case was to virtually change use
immunity into transactional immunity,'' under which the government
agrees not to prosecute someone in return for their cooperation,
said G. Robert Blakey, a Notre Dame law professor who drafted the
1970 use immunity statute.
   The court, in effect, created a rule that ``once anything was
disseminated as widely as North's testimony, it necessarily
affected the trial,'' Blakey said. ``There was nothing particularly
unusual about the North testimony that it would irretrievably taint
anybody who read it.''
   The two circuit judges who joined in the ruling, Laurence H.
Silberman, and David Sentelle, were both appointed by Reagan and
are generally regarded as members of the court's conservative wing.
   Patricia Wald, the appellate court's chief judge and the
dissenter in the North case, was appointed by President Carter.
   ``The two majority judges simply let North off,'' Blakey said.
``If that sort of solicitude was paid to criminal defendants
generally, we wouldn't be talking about Reagan judges.''

<HEAD>Bush Administration Urges Congress to Hold Down Clean Air Costs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's top economic adviser says no
matter what additional clean air controls are approved by Congress
it will be expensive to the economy and result in job losses for
some workers.
   Michael Boskin, chairman of the president's Council of Economic
Advisers, urged Senate and House negotiators to hold down the cost
of compromise clean air legislation and reiterated that Bush
opposes any bill that is substantially more expensive than the $20
billion a year proposals he made last year.
   ``The president is not prepared to see American firms, workers
and consumers overcharged or to see economic growth slowed
needlessly,'' Boskin said in a letter to Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.
   Dingell, who heads the House negotiating team trying to work out
a compromise clean air bill with the Senate, had asked for an
economic assessment of the air pollution controls being considered
on Capitol Hill.
   House and Senate staff members, meanwhile, met most of Tuesday
and were expected to continue discussions through the week as the
two chambers work out differences in clean air bills approved
earlier this year.
   A compromise bill is unlikely to emerge from conference before
late September.
   In his letter to Dingell, Boskin belittled suggestions that most
of the additional costs to the economy of tougher air pollution
controls could be offset by savings elsewhere. Instead, he said,
the tighter controls will result in reduced productivity and hamper
U.S. industry's ability to compete with foreign industries.
   Environmentalists, congressional supporters of tough new
pollution controls as well as some senior officials of the
Environmental Protection Agency have argued that the substantial
costs imposed on industry by the new clean air requirements would
be offset by reduced health care spending and growth in new
industries spawned by the need for pollution controls.
   EPA Administrator William Reilly has been among those who have
argued that while some industries may suffer from the new
requirements, other businesses dealing in pollution control
activities may prosper and provide new jobs as well as new exports.
   ``The assertion ... that expanded clean air programs would on
balance create jobs, increase productivity and make the U.S.
economy more competitive in world markets are at best wishful
thinking,'' Boskin wrote.
   A spokesman for Reilly said the EPA chief agrees with Boskin's
analysis. ``Reilly and Boskin are eye to eye on this,'' said EPA
spokesman Dave Cohen.
   Boskin said the administration proposal to Congress would have
added about $20 billion a year in new pollution control costs to
the economy by the time all the new requirements go into effect in
the year 2005. He said the bills approved by both the House and
Senate would cost $25 billion, somewhat higher than previous
administration estimates for the Senate bill of $21.5 billion.
   There was no explanation for the difference.
   But Boskin said if the most costly features of both the House
and Senate bills are kept in a final bill the cost could increase
to $35 billion a year. President Bush has threatened to veto any
clean air legislation he considers too costly or a threat to
economic growth.
   But Boskin said that Bush all along has known that tougher air
pollution controls will be costly. ``He is fully aware that any
environmentally strong clean air bill will reduce real income
growth and cause some temporary unemployment. ... The president
believes that our nation is able and should be willing to pay a
reasonable price to clean its air.''

<HEAD>America Heading Toward Record-Breaking Murder Toll, Panel Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   America is heading toward a record-breaking
murder toll this year as a result of increasing quantities of
assault weapons and drying up supplies of cocaine, according to a
Senate committee.
   ``We are in the midst of a growing epidemic of homicide,''
Senate Judiciary Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., said Tuesday
in releasing the committee's grisly forecast.
   The report predicted that there would be 23,220 murders across
the nation this year, about 2,000 more than the figure for 1989 and
ahead of the previous record of 23,040, which was set in 1980.
   America's murder rate of 10.5 per 100,000 people makes it ``the
most murderous industrialized nation'' in the world, the panel
said. In Great Britain, the rate is 0.8 per 100,000; in Japan, 1.0;
in West Germany, 1.2.
   The report said the upsurge can partially be traced to dwindling
supplies of cocaine in major cities that have escalated the drug
wars.
   In addition, the report pinned increased murders on a growing
arsenal of assault rifles it called ``the weapons of choice for
drug dealers and the weapons of doom for law enforcement
personnel.''
   The National Rifle Association, however, scoffed at that
statement.
   ``Every study done by law enforcement agencies, including the
FBI, the New York Police Department and the Florida Assault Weapons
Commission, demonstrates the minuscule involvement of such weapons
in criminal violence,'' said NRA federal liaison David Conover.
   The Judiciary Committee also cited a fresh wave of jobless,
crime-prone teen-agers as a reason for the increase in killings.
   The committee said ``cocaine prices are up and purity levels are
down.
   ``This means supplies are scarce. And that, in turn, means that
drug dealers are going to be fighting for their turf and customers.
   ``The more they fight, the higher the death toll, a tragic
consequence of winning the `war on drugs.'''
   The report said that since 1985, ``a new crop of 18- to 24
year-olds with all of their attendant violence has become an
abnormally large segment of the population.''
   The nation's murder total fell 18 percent from 1980 to 1985 but
has risen 22 percent since then.
   Dr. Lynn Richardson, associate chief of emergency services at
New York's Harlem Hospital Center, told lawmakers of a young woman
rushed in several weeks ago. The right side of her head had been
blown away by a rifle in an apparent drug shootout. She said
doctors saved a 6{-month fetus and that the child is clinging to
life.
   Philadelphia Police Commissioner Willie L. Williams said 35
percent of his city's killings last year were related to drugs.
   ``We now have drug dealers who shoot it out with semiautomatic
weapons on our streets, murdering innocent children,'' Williams
added.
   Professor James A. Fox of the College of Criminal Justice at
Northeastern University in Boston said crime might get worse as
unemployment and pregnancy among youths now just becoming
teen-agers rises as well.
   ``In fact, the forecasting model developed 15 years ago
indicates a resurgence in violence in the 1990s,'' Fox said. ``The
worst may be yet to come.''
   Drawing on FBI figures, the committee said California led the
nation in murders last year with 3,158. The panel projected violent
deaths this year in the nation's most-populous state at 3,442, a 9
percent increase.
   The largest percentage increase projected by the committee was
in Idaho, which had 26 murders last year. The panel projected a 50
percent increase to 39 this year.
   The greatest percentage decrease predicted was 67 percent in
both New Hampshire and North Dakota. New Hampshire had 36 murders
last year; the forecast is for 12 this year. North Dakota had four
murders last year, the lowest in the nation; the projection is for
one this year.

<HEAD>Debate Over Damages in Civil Rights Bill Intensifies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women's groups are fighting moves to cap job
discrimination damages allowed under a major civil rights bill,
while the White House supports such a plan as a way to head off a
``bonanza'' for trial lawyers.
   ``Women are at risk of being sacrificed once again on the altar
of business interests,'' Patricia Ireland, vice president of the
National Organization for Women, told a news conference Tuesday.
   The debate over job discrimination damages for women, members of
religious minorities and the physically handicapped intensified as
the House prepared to debate the civil rights bill.
   The measure, similar to a bill already passed by the Senate,
appears likely to come to the House floor later this week.
   The Bush administration says the bill would lead to the use of
hiring quotas and has been threatening a presidential veto unless
it is changed.
   Major provisions range from a ban on harassment in the workplace
to barriers to reopening court-approved fair-hiring agreements.
   The bill provides for open-ended damages for women who are
victims of intentional discrimination, such as sexual harassment or
refusal to hire based on gender.
   Critics say it will encourage discrimination suits because
lawyers will be hungry to share in sizeable damages awards.
   Opponents are hoping to insert limits on damages when the bill
comes to the House floor.
   Women's groups and bill sponsors dislike the idea of limits
because a 1981 law allows open-ended damages for racial bias in the
workplace. They envision cases in which black women _ alleging
racial discrimination _ could collect more than white women in
lawsuits against the same employer.
   ``While we strongly support the elimination of discrimination in
the workplace, it is impossible for us to condone secondary status
based on gender, religion or physical ability,'' said Joan Bronk,
president of the National Council of Jewish Women.
   ``It is totally unacceptable to write into law, for the first
time so clearly and consciously, that sex discrimination on the job
is someone less offensive than race discrimination,'' Ireland said.
   There has been speculation, however, that support for the
measure among conservative southern Democrats could wither if a cap
on damages is not added at some point before the measure is sent to
President Bush's desk.
   At the White House, deputy press secretary Alixe Glen praised a
measure sponsored by Rep. John J. LaFalce, D-N.Y. The proposal
would allow compensatory payments of up to $100,000 in
discrimination cases in which the court felt it were necessary to
deter the employer from persisting in bias.
   The plan would also soften provisions that would make it easier
for those filing discrimination suits to win cases based on
statistics.
   Glen said the LaFalce plan ``represents a bipartisan consensus
in the House'' that would lessen the likelihood of quota hiring and
``constrains the potential litigation bonanza for trial lawyers by
limiting damages to appropriate cases.''
   ``We hope and expect the Democratic leadership to allow a vote
on the LaFalce substitute,'' said Ms. Glen, who acknowledged the
LaFalce amendment was similar to a plan defeated in the Senate.

   ``Souvenirs,'' which also stars Mariel Hemingway, Claude Akins
and Kay Lenz, is based on a story by Mellencamp. Larry McMurtry,
whose credits include ``The Last Picture Show'' and ``Terms of
Endearment,'' wrote the screenplay.
   Mellencamp plays a country singer who returns to Indiana to
celebrate his grandfather's birthday. Once back, the singer is
confronted by family issues he neglected during his climb to fame,
Mellencamp manager Harry Sandler and publicist Kathy Schenker said.
   Mellencamp's hits include ``Jack and Diane,'' ``Pink Houses''
``Small Town'' and ``Hurts So Good.''

   The House is completing work on a
comprehensive housing bill that is under a veto threat because it
disregards a presidential demand for higher down payments on
mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration.
   The legislation, expected to pass today, must be reconciled with
a different Senate version that includes the tougher administration
down payment requirements.
   President Bush threatened to veto any bill that would not keep
the FHA insurance fund solvent at a time of escalating defaults.
   Even before the House voted overwhelmingly Tuesday night to
require roughly the same cash down payments as under current law,
Bush warned that such a requirement would be unacceptable.
   The FHA language was the main focus of debate Tuesday night, but
it is only a portion of legislation that would authorize about $28
billion for the government's housing and home ownership programs
for fiscal 1991.
   The comprehensive legislation would establish new programs to
help first-time home buyers, permit low-income Americans receiving
public housing assistance to own their homes, and encourage
production of new rental housing.
   Both the administration and House members agreed to an annual
fee to be charged home buyers in order to keep the FHA insurance
fund solvent _ with the administration's proposed charge slightly
smaller.
   But the House plan, adopted 418-2, also requires the lower down
payment requirements. It was sponsored by Reps. Bruce Vento,
D-Minn., and Thomas Ridge, R-Pa.
   The administration maintains that Americans qualifying for FHA
mortgages should pay more up front than under current regulations
because those who put up more cash will be less likely to default.
   Vento and Ridge argued the administration's down payment
requirements would make it impossible for thousands of Americans to
buy a home.
   The FHA payments at settlement would vary with the price of the
house. Under the Vento-Ridge language, Americans buying a $65,000
home would pay up-front charges of $4,115.
   The administration would require payments of $4,939 on the same
house.
   The higher cost proposed by the administration would result from
a requirement that buyers pay two-thirds of the closing cost at
settlement. The Vento-Ridge language would allow the closing costs
to be financed through monthly mortgage payments.
   The FHA changes were a reaction to an analysis by the Price
Waterhouse accounting firm, which said the insurance fund is
currently solvent, but is losing money at an alarmingly fast rate.
   The administration contends the savings and loan crisis has
demonstrated the dangers of allowing an undercapitalized federal
insurance program to operate on an unsound basis.
   Supporters of the Vento-Ridge provision said the administration
plan would exclude up to 100,000 potential home buyers. The
administration has maintained that no more than 35,000 people would
be shut out.
   Voting against Vento-Ridge were Reps. Thomas Petri, R-Wis. and
Jim Cooper, D-Tenn.

<TEXT>
   Grossinger's Hotel and Country Club, the
Borscht Belt retreat that launched Eddie Fisher's career and helped
Jack Dempsey develop his punch, will soon be little more than a
summer memory.
   The Catskills hotel, which entertained 100,000 guests a year in
its heyday in the 1940s and '50s, probably will be sold off
piecemeal to end years of financial trouble, said Barbara
Balliber-Strauss, its bankruptcy trustee.
   The 812-acre resort in the town of Liberty has been empty since
1986, when it was closed for a $30 million renovation and expansion
project that never was completed.
   Before air conditioning and convenient air travel, a getaway for
hot, tired New Yorkers meant a two-hour drive to the Catskill
Mountains.
   But like many resort areas close to big cities, the Catskills
faded as other parts of the world became more accessible and an
extended summer siesta became unfashionable. Grossinger's went into
a slide with other hotels in the region.
   Joe Risitano, 60, who has vacationed in the Catskills since
1948, was hired as a security guard at Grossinger's and said he
spent Tuesday turning away people curious to see the hotel.
   ``A lot of people are saying their grandparents stayed here and
always talked about it,'' he said. ``Now they want to see it. It's
nostalgia, you know.''
   Fisher, who made his debut at Grossinger's 41 years ago and was
discovered there _ as legend has it _ by Eddie Cantor, returned to
help kick off the facelift in 1986, which was halted in 1989. More
than a dozen contractors filed liens of more than $8.7 million
against the owners, contending they had not been paid.
   The owners, a group of New York City investors, had bought the
resort from the Grossinger family in 1985.
   The financial trouble is a far cry from the heydy of
Grossinger's and other resorts in the Catskills, known as the
Borscht Belt for the Jewish crowd that vacationed there and the
Jewish singers and comics who entertained them.
   Grossinger's had it all _ a 27-hole golf course, ski slope,
indoor and outdoor pools and tennis courts, post office, shopping
arcade, two kosher kitchens and a 1,500-seat dining room.
   Dempsey, Rocky Marciano, Ken Norton and Michael Spinks trained
there. Lucille Ball performed at the resort's two nightclubs. Joel
Grey and Leslie Uggams advanced their careers at Grossinger's.
   Mamie Eisenhower was one of many political figures who regularly
vacationed at the 600-room resort, famous for its all-you-can-eat
meals three times a day, including a breakfast menu that included
seven styles of herring.
   The resort was opened in 1914 by Austrian immigrants, Selig and
Mahlke Grossinger. Losing money, the family sold it for $9 million
in 1985 to Grossinger's Associates, an unrelated group of investors.
   Last December, the owners filed for protection from creditors in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code.
Balliber-Strauss said the hotel and its contents likely will be
liquidated under Chapter 7.
   ``What we plan to do is meet with lenders in order to determine
the best approach to take,'' Balliber-Strauss said.
   In his ``The Glory and the Dream,'' William Manchester listed
the first ``Singles Only'' weekend held at Grossinger's among the
greater events of 1962, followed by John Glenn's spaceflight and
the Cuban missile crisis.

<HEAD>Baker's Visit Tame In Annals of US-Mongolia Relations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the annals of U.S.-Mongolia
relations, Secretary of State James A. Baker III's visit starting
Thursday will rank as relatively tame.
   American adverturer-businessmen were running car services
between the Chinese border and Ulan Bator, then called Urga, as
early as 1916, and were embroiled in smuggling, kidnappings and
shootouts.
   Their Cadillacs and Dodges were the first cars in this
landlocked Central Asian nation, whose very name for many Americans
epitomizes things remote, exotic and dangerous.
   The first official U.S. envoy came in 1920 from Beijing to
evaluate a plea from Mongolian princes for help in ousting their
Chinese overlords.
   But when Mongolian revolutionaries made their move in 1921, it
was the Soviet Red Army that helped, starting a seven-decade
alliance that sealed off Mongolia from the West more effectively
than geography.
   One brief contact came in July 1944, the Communist Party
newspaper Unen recently reported, when U.S. Vice President Henry
Wallace stopped in Ulan Bator while traveling between China and the
Soviet city of Irkutsk.
   The United States and Soviet Union were World War II allies, and
Mongolian soldiers also were fighting the Japanese.
   Unen said reporters were keen for their first look at an
American.
   But ``he was very ordinary,'' the paper said. ``He emerged
without any hat, dressed in a very light suit and without any tie.''
   Wallace, who like Baker stayed three days, met with
then-dictator Marshal Horloogiyn Choybalsan, visited museums, took
in a play and met Mongolian horsemen, whom he surprised with his
knowledge of racehorses.
   Another contact came in the early 1960s, after the United States
stopped blocking Mongolian entry into the United Nations. Mongolia
invited U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas to visit, and
he gave lectures on the U.S. legal system.
   American hunters began arriving in 1967, starting up what has
become a multimillion-dollar safari industry for Mongolia.
   Negotiations on establishing diplomatic relations failed,
however, both in the early 1960s and in the late 1970s. Finally, as
the Cold War thawed, relations were established in 1987.
   The United States sent its first resident ambassador in June,
even as the Soviet Union continued pulling its troops out. A
complete Soviet troop withdrawal is scheduled for 1992.
   But Americans are still relatively rare in Ulan Bator, which
bears a heavy Soviet stamp in its architecture, food and consumer
goods. The Cadillacs and Dodges are long gone, replaced by official
fleets of boxy black Berras from the Soviet Union.
   Ordinary Mongolians said they were surprised to hear of Baker's
visit. Many people in Washington were, too; despite its location
between China and the Soviet Union, Mongolia is not key to American
strategic planning.
   One motive appears to be Baker's interest in hunting. He will
spend two days on a private hunting and fishing expedition in the
Gobi Desert.
   U.S. officials say Baker also will sign a consular agreement and
an agreement to send Peace Corps volunteers. They are expected to
start teaching English next year.
   The two sides also are negotiating a general trade agreement.
Mongolia is seeking most-favored-nation trade status from the
United States, which would entitle it to the lowest tariffs on its
exports. Total trade between the countries last year was $1.6
million.
   Baker also will meet with Mongolia's Communist leaders and
representatives of new opposition parties that contended in the
country's first free elections Sunday.
   Nyamdoo, the Mongolian ambassador to Washington, said Baker did
not confirm his trip until the opposition dropped its threat to
boycott the elections. The State Department said the visit ``serves
to demonstrate our support for Mongolia's peaceful democratic
reform process.''
   It is a subtle slap at neighboring China, with whom the
Washington has halted most high-level visits since the Chinese army
attacked pro-democracy protesters in Beijing in June 1989. It would
have been natural for Baker to stop in Beijing, which is a main
gateway to Mongolia.
   Opposition activists say they hope to learn from the U.S.
democratic system. They want U.S. investment and development aid to
reduce Mongolia's dependence on the Soviets.
   The Mongolian government also wants trade, investment and
technology.
   ``Mongolia is ready to get anything he can give to us,'' Deputy
Foreign Minister Choinhor said jokingly Monday.
   American businessmen are slowly starting contacts.
   The New York-based textile company Amicale Industries recently
started a joint venture in Mongolia to process camel hair.
Exploration Associates of Houston is searching for oil, and
Ringling Brothers' circus has signed up Mongolian circus acts.
   Mongolian vodka is expected to appear in U.S. stores next year.
   One measure of Mongolian interest in the United States came when
a group of scholars founded the Mongolia-U.S. Association in May.
Gonchigdorj, a founding member, said 500 people showed up for the
first meeting.

   Here, at a glance, are the major issues in
campaign finance legislation before the Senate:
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>SPENDING CEILINGS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats want to set voluntary limits on how much Senate
candidates can spend in primary and general elections. Overall, the
ceilings would range from just under $2 million for a candidate
from a small state to $10.3 million in California. Candidates could
exceed the general election caps by 25 percent with contributions
of $100 or less from in-state voters.
   Republicans oppose absolute ceilings, saying they inhibit the
ability of challengers to raise enough money to overcome
incumbents. They offer ``flexible'' ceilings that would exempt
money from in-state donors and out-of-state contributions of $250
or less.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>PUBLIC FINANCING</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats offer a variety of incentives to encourage candidates
to abide by voluntary spending limits. They would offer Senate
candidates a total of $20 million in government vouchers every
two-year election cycle to help pay for certain TV and radio ads.
   Republicans offer no public financing proposals.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>CONTRIBUTION LIMITS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats would retain the current $1,000 limit that an
individual can contribute for each primary and general election.
The $25,000 annual limit on what an individual can give to all
candidates and party committees would be raised to $30,000.
   Republicans would halve the $1,000 ceiling on individual
contributions from non-state residents. But they would exempt gifts
to national and state party committees from the ceiling, allowing
individuals to give up to $340,000 a year.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>PACs</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Both parties have agreed to a proposal by President Bush to ban
corporate, union and trade association political action committees.
They doubt the ban could be extended to ideological PACs, keyed to
issues such as abortion or gun control, because of constitutional
questions.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>``SOFT'' MONEY</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats would put new limits on spending by state party
organizations for voter registration, education and turnout
activities.
   Republicans have no fixed ceiling on such spending. But they
would require state parties to subject a third of such expenses to
federal limits on contributions.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>PERSONAL FUNDS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats would limit a candidate's contributions to his own
campaign to $250,000 and bar candidates from repaying the money
with contributions received after an election.
   Republicans would do the same. They also would let the opponents
of candidates who use more than $250,000 of their own money raise
contributions of up to $5,000 from individuals, up from $1,000
otherwise.&equals;
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MAIL</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Democrats would use public funds to subsidize three-fourths of
the cost of first-class campaign mail, up to a certain limit.
   Republicans would forbid members of Congress from using their
franking privilege for mass mailings during an election year.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>TELEVISION</BYLINE>

   Both parties would require broadcasters to make their best
advertising slots available to candidates 45 days before a primary
and 60 days before a general election, at lower-than standard rates.

<BYLINE>City Opera Season Opens With ``Marriage of Figaro''
^By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opening night at the New York City Opera
revealed many of the reasons why sometimes it's worth going there
rather than to the nation's leading opera house next door.
   It's not too often that the neighboring Metropolitan Opera
engages a cast of relatively unknown American singers to render a
well-acted, appealing performance without the distractions of star
turns.
   The City Opera did it Tuesday with ``The Marriage of Figaro'' _
not sublime Mozart and not a transcendent musical experience, but
yet a satisfying theatrical one.
   City Opera had to cancel much of its last season because of a
strike, settled early this year. And Tuesday's was its first
performance under new director Christopher Keene.
   The singers responded well to each other and the action was
completely in harmony with the notes, conducted by Scott Bergeson.
   There was some heaviness in moving passages and the singers at
times seemed to produce blocks of notes rather than lines, but
generally Bergeson kept things moving. The ensembles _ really the
glories of ``Figaro'' _ were well-balanced. Intonation problems
surfaced occasionally in the orchestra.
   The sets and costumes of Carl Toms were straightforwardly 18th
century, spare and unencumbered by Rococco ornament, but warm with
wood paneling and ochre colors.
   John Copley's direction of this 1977-production was completely
engaging, but most engaging of all was Maureen O'Flynn's Susanna.
She showed that a small voice spinning focused lines with dramatic
feeling conveyed through the notes is better than any prima donna
display.
   ``Figaro'' is really a work about love and all its handmaidens:
jealousy, lust, marital fidelity, ardor and trust. O'Flynn, with
agility, displayed all of these. Her interplay with Dean Peterson's
Figaro was completely convincing.
   O'Flynn was full of charming touches: the saucy curtsy when the
Count discovers it is her, not a lover, in his wife's closet, her
prompting of Figaro when the Count questions him about a letter,
her demure (feigned) acquiescence to the Count's advances.
   Peterson was a fine match for the pert O'Flynn _ tall, athletic,
graceful and able to move quick from smiling cockiness to
bewilderment as his fortunes changed moment to moment in the battle
of wits with the Count.
   Peterson sang well, but his voice had a gruff quality that's not
really suited to Figaro's character. It is perfect for Masetto, the
rough peasant hot-head in ``Don Giovanni.'' He showed great aplomb
in the opening scene when a mannikin holding the Count's cloak and
wig fell over. He picked it up, put back the dummy's head and even
gave it a pat, all the while continuing his part unfazed.
   William Stone was a fine Count Almaviva, a character much like
Don Giovanni confined to his house (and servants). He brought the
fierceness necessary to make us believe the fear of his jealousy by
the Countess, sung by Renee Fleming.
   Fleming, who's won a good many awards and seems to be on her
way, evoked a mixed reaction. Her voice is creamy and she too is no
wig-carrying manikin as an actress. Her third act aria ``Dove
sono'' had a breathtaking soft section.
   But at times, particularly in the ``Porgi, amor'' cavatina that
opens Act II, Fleming tended to eat words and add so much
expression to each note that the melody's sense of direction was
lost. She also had to zero in a few times on the right pitch,
though her entrance in ``Porgi, amor'' was perfect.
   The only real disappointment of the night was Cynthia Rose in
the pants role of Cherubino, the hopeless adolescent wooer of older
women. She blared out loud notes and struck only false ones in her
stage business, often smiling inappropriately, capering awkwardly
and showing none of the sensuality this role needs.
   John Calvin West made his debut as Dr. Bartolo and bellowed a
little in his ``Vendetta'' aria, but was an amusing presence. Even
more so was the dried up, quavering Don Basilio of Jerold Siena,
down to his sagging left sock.

<HEAD>Drug Trafficking Trial of Sacramento Man Begins</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARI S. MANIAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The trial began today of the first
American to be charged under Malaysia's strict drug laws, which
carry a mandatory death sentence for those convicted of drug
trafficking.
   Kerry Lane Wiley, 38, of Sacramento, Calif., is being tried on
charges he had 16.85 ounces of marijuana in his possession in
November.
   Under Malaysian law, sale need not be proven for trafficking.
Mere possession of 100 grams or more of marijuana or 100 grams of
heroin is deemed to be trafficking.
   Customs officials said Wiley, a lecturer in computers at a
college in Hawaii, entered Malaysia from Bangkok and was staying at
a friend's house when police raided it and found the drugs among
Wiley's belongings.
   Police said they were tipped off about the drugs.
   Since 1975, when Parliament allowed the death penalty for drug
trafficking, 340 people have been sentenced to death. Of these, 112
have been hanged, including about 30 foreigners.
   Wiley is the first American charged under the tough laws.
   At today's proceedings, Judge Shaik Daud Ismail granted defense
counsel Mohamad Shafee Abdullah's request that Wiley's trial be
conducted in English.
   Malaysia recently made the native Malay language the official
language of the court system, replacing English. Malaysia is a
former British colony that won independence in 1957.
   The court agreed to dispense with the new policy since it said
Wiley would not be able to understand the trial.
   The trial is scheduled to run until Aug. 11, then resume again
Aug. 20. Those charged with drug trafficking do not qualify for
bail, and Wiley has been confined to Kuala Lumpur's Pudu Prison.

<TEXT>
   An Israeli navy patrol boat attacked and sank a
rubber guerrilla boat off southern Lebanon early today, killing the
two men aboard, the army command said.
   It said in a communique that a Dvora patrol boat opened fire on
the boat after identifying it as hostile. The army said no one on
the Israeli boat was injured. The affiliation of the slain
guerrillas was not immediately known.
   A Lebanese police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with
regulations, said an Israeli gunboat and a helicopter gunship
spotted the motorized rubber dinghy north of the Lebanese port city
of Tyre at about 4 a.m.
   Witnesses watched the 30-minute clash from rooftops and the
city's coast.
   One witness, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: ``The
gunboat and helicopter exchanged fire with the guerrillas in the
dinghy. The dinghy was zigzaging at high speed in an effort to
escape the Israeli fire.
   ``Suddenly, the dinghy blew up. There was a circle of fire in
the sea for five minutes.''
   It was the first seaborne attempt to infiltrate into Israel
since June.
   On June 23, a Dvora patrol boat ran down a speedboat heading
toward the Israeli border settlement of Rosh Haniqra and killed the
two guerrillas aboard, who were armed with rocket-propelled
grenades and automatic rifles.
   Responsibility for that attack was claimed by a fundamentalist
faction of Lebanese Sunni Moslems, traditional PLO allies in
Lebanon.
   On the Jewish holiday of Shavuot in May, powerboats carrying
heavily armed Palestinians from Abul Abbas' Palestine Liberation
Front outran slower Dvora patrols and landed near a crowded beach
before four Arabs were killed and seven captured.

<HEAD>Cargo Ship in Danger of Sinking Off Cape Cod</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Greek cargo ship caught off Cape Cod in
Hurricane Bertha was in danger of sinking early today, the Coast
Guard said.
   The Corazon, with a crew of 27, lost part of its bow and its
midsection buckled, causing one end to lift up, said Coast Guard
Petty Officer Lionel Bryant. The ship was about 340 miles
east-southeast of Cape Cod, he said.
   The 593-foot vessel loaded with concrete was buffeted by 80 mph
winds and 20- to 25-foot seas, Bryant said.
   Bertha was about 60 miles from the ship and ``headed right
toward them,'' Bryan said. The hurricane was expected to reach the
ship by noon.
   ``The keel is broken at midship and waves are crashing over the
middle,'' Bryant said. ``That's lifting the stern out of the
water.''
   Bryant said a Coast Guard cutter headed for the Corazon to help.
A Liberian merchant ship was about two miles from the Corazon and a
Coast Guard aircraft circled above, but a rescue was not
immediately attempted, Bryant said.
   ``Any type of rescue could be quite hazardous,'' Bryant said.
   The cargo ship was headed for New York when it reported trouble
Tuesday afternoon, Bryant said.
   It was unclear whether the damage to the ship was caused by the
storm, he said.

<TEXT>
   Motorists in car-crazy Southern California
would have to leave their wheels at home every other day under
proposals offered by the Environmental Protection Agency for
cleaning up the nation's dirtiest air.
   The plan offered Tuesday is aimed at cutting ozone _ a major
component of smog _ by 86 percent by early next century.
   It is a backup to a clean-air plan approved in 1989 by the South
Coast Air Quality Management District. The EPA plan would take
effect only if state and regional governments in the district's
area fail to reduce smog significantly.
   The EPA proposals were prompted by a lawsuit filed by
environmentalists in 1982.
   ``We have been very concerned that the local district has been
backsliding,'' said Jan Chatten-Brown, president of the Coalition
for Clean Air. ``This plan will send a clear message ... if the
district won't do the job, the EPA will step in.''
   The EPA guidelines include a proposal for no-drive days if other
methods fail to reduce ozone. Such a plan would use odd or even
numbers on license plates to assign alternate driving days for the
area's 12 million motorists.
   ``It is in the spirit of presenting all possibilities that we
are presenting the no-drive day. ... It is not one we are
endorsing,'' said Daniel W. McGovern, EPA Western regional
administrative director.
   ``State and local authorities have been engaged in an
extraordinary effort to address this problem themselves, which we
all hope will render a federal plan as unnecessary.''
   Other features of the EPA plan include reduction of emissions by
6 percent a year from pollution sources such as household products,
industrial solvents and pesticides; extending pollution control
standards to construction equipment, pleasure boats and off-road
vehicles, and a requirement that new motor vehicles are 85 percent
to 90 percent cleaner than current vehicles.
   The current three-step AQMD plan affects everything from lawn
mowers to refineries, at an estimated cost of $2.62 billion a year.
   But later steps of that plan include the use of technology not
yet developed, making its effectiveness a guessing game.
   In 1988, the most recent year available, Los Angeles exceeded
the national standard for ozone 150 times, compared with 20 times
for New York and Chicago.
   The federal plan takes longer to achieve goals set by the
regional agency. The AQMD plan calls for reducing current ozone
averages by 86 percent in 2007; the EPA by 2010.

<HEAD>Stocks Fall, Dollar At Five-Month Low</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key indicator erased its
morning gains and fell back today, while the dollar closed at the
lowest level against the Japanese yen in five months.
   The dollar ended at 146.65 yen, down 0.85 yen from Tuesday's
147.50-yen finish. It opened lower at 146.00 yen and ranged between
145.60 yen and 146.65 yen.
   The dollar has lost 4.1 yen from last Friday and is at its
lowest since its 146.47-yen close on February 23.
   Dealers said the dollar, which also was sold in New York over
the narrowing interest rate gap between Japan and the United
States, fell below the 146-yen level when institutional investors
dumped the dollar as soon as Tokyo's morning session started.
   ``Under the current situation with little difference in (both
country's) interest rates, there's no reason to buy the currency
(dollar),'' said a dealer with Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank.
   Lower interest rates tend to make a country's currency less
attractive to foreign investors.
   But the currency soon rose and ended higher than the opening
because ``there was a greater than expected demand for the dollar
below the 146-yen line,'' said Yutaka Hayashi, a dealer with the
Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank.
   About $13.55 billion changed hands in spot trading, up from
Tuesday's $12.97 billion.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average shed
197.67 points, or 0.64 percent, ending the day at 30,837.99. The
index rose 592.71 points on Tuesday, breaking its fall over the
last seven consecutive days.
   The Nikkei was up 236.20 points at the end of morning trading
because of confidence from stability in the bond market, traders
said. It then fell back in the afternoon mainly because of
arbitrage selling for profit-taking before Aug. 9, the final day of
trading of August options, they said.
   ``The market is still very weak, and any news can easily affect
trading, and (negative news) can discourage market players' buying
interest so easily,'' said Masaki Wakabayashi, a trader with
Yamaichi Securities Co.
   He said traders were pessimistic about upcoming statistics on
the performance of the U.S. manufacturing industry.

   A Roman Catholic man was shot
to death by two gunmen as he stood talking with friends outside his
home in Belfast, police said today.
   Police headquarters in Belfast said the attackers were believed
to be Protestant extremists. It said the shooting occurred Tuesday
night in the Catholic stronghold Springfield Road area.
   The victim was identified a John Judge, a 34-year-old father of
three.
   Police said they were treating the attack as sectarian.
   They said the gunmen arrived on the scene in a taxi, which was
later found to have been hijacked.
   The gunmen escaped after the attack and the vehicle was later
discovered abandoned near the staunchly Protestant Shankill Road

   A Northwest Airlines pilot on trial with two
crewmates on charges of flying while intoxicated was an alcoholic
who had 17 rum and Cokes the night before the flight, attorneys and
witnesses say.
   The two other crew members shared seven pitchers of beer, a
waitress said Tuesday, the opening day of their trial in federal
court.
   She said the captain, Norman Lyle Prouse, fell on the floor
before leaving the bar.
   The three had gone to the restaurant and bar to take the chill
off their icy cockpit relationship, attorneys said. They had worked
together less than a week.
   William Mauzy, representing 1st Officer Robert Kirchner, said
Kirchner played the peacemaker between Prouse and flight engineer
Joseph Balzer. Prouse had been critical of Balzer's performance,
Mauzy said.
   Kirchner ``felt there was something lacking in the three of them
getting along,'' Mauzy said. ``He tried to smooth over the
situation.''
   Shortly before 4 p.m. on March 7, the three met for drinks,
according to testimony. They flew the next day about 6 a.m. from
Fargo, N.D., to Minneapolis-St. Paul.
   Waitress Kathryn Litch testified that the bar poured about 17
rum and Diet Cokes for Prouse and seven pitchers of beer for Balzer
and Kirchner. About half the beer in the last pitcher remained when
Balzer and Kirchner left, she said.
   Ms. Litch testified Kirchner and Balzer left about 10:30 p.m.
Prouse left later, after falling on the floor, she said.
   All three pilots had blood-alcohol levels higher than .04
percent, the FAA limit, according to test results admitted as
evidence. Prouse had the highest reading, .131 percent.
   Prouse's attorney, Peter Wold, said in his opening statement
that Prouse is an alcoholic and thus has a high tolerance for
alcohol. The pilot had no trouble flying the Boeing 727 with 91
passengers, his lawyer said.
   The pilots were arrested when the plane landed in the Twin
Cities by officials who had been tipped about their drinking. All
three were fired, and the Federal Aviation Administration revoked
their licenses.
   Les Stenerson, a lumber salesman, testified he anonymously
tipped the FAA about the pilots' drinking after seeing them in the
bar.
   FAA safety inspector Verle Addison testified he met the pilots
at the departure gate in Fargo. He said the pilots were late,
smelled of alcohol and had bloodshot eyes.
   Prouse, from Conyers, Ga.; Kirchner, from Highland Ranch, Colo.,
and Balzer, from Antioch, Tenn., are charged with operating the
aircraft while under the influence of alcohol. The offense carries
up to 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

   The lead singer for Judas Priest says the
heavy metal group once recorded a phrase backwards but didn't bury
subliminal messages promoting suicide in an album blamed for the
deaths of two young fans.
   Rob Halford was the first of four band members to testify in a
lawsuit brought by the parents of the two fans.
   ``There are no subliminals of any nature'' on the 1978 album
``Stained Glass,'' he said Tuesday.
   Halford testified he recorded a backward phrase in the song
``Love Bites'' on the British band's album ``Defenders of the
Faith'' in the mid-1980s.
   Halford said he recorded the phrase ``in the dead of the night,
love bites'' backwards and played it simultaneously with the same
words recorded forwards. He said the backward version sounded like
garbled speech.
   District Judge Jerry Carr Whitehead, who is hearing the case
against the band and CBS Records without a jury, asked Halford why
he did it.
   ``When you're composing songs, you're always looking for new
ideas, new sounds ... just as an artist would add another piece of
paint to a canvas,'' Halford said.
   He said it was the only time he could recall deliberately using
the technique on any of the group's 14 albums.
   Halford earlier gave a 10-second a cappella demonstration of his
vocal style, using ``Better by You, Better Than Me,'' a song the
families claim contains subliminal messages that led their sons to
shoot themselves in a suicide pact.
   Halford sang, ``Better by you better than me; You can tell her
what I want it to be,'' accenting the end of each line with a huff
of breath.
   The families of Raymond Belknap and James Vance claim those
lines contain the subliminal message ``do it.''
   The youths shot themselves in a deserted church playground in
1985. Belknap, 18, died immediately. Vance, then 20, blew away the
bottom half of his face. He died in 1988 of complications from his
injuries and the various medications.
   The band and CBS Records deny any hidden messages exist. They
contend the supposed ``do it'' sounds are an exhalation of breath
and a combination of drums, guitars and vocals.

<HEAD>Government To Allow Competing Parties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Joaquim Chissano has
announced that, for the first time in Mozambique's history,
opposition parties will be allowed to compete for power.
   The move, reported Tuesday by the national news agency AIM, was
considered a major concession that could help end the nation's
13-year-old civil war.
   The conflict has claimed about 100,000 lives, most of them
civilians.
   ``For those who want to form parties, as long as they obey the
law, as long as they behave peacefully, we have no right to prevent
them from doing so,'' AIM quoted Chissano quoted as saying.
   Chissano said the political bureau of the ruling FRELIMO party
had voted unanimously to adopt a multiparty system and that it
should be in place for parliamentary and presidential elections
next year.
   FRELIMO has ruled Mozambique as the sole legal political party
since independence from Portugal in 1975. The party was Marxist,
but has undergone reforms in recent years and officially dropped
its Marxist label last year.
   Rebels of the Mozambique National Resistance began their
insurgency in 1977, and the war has made this southeast African
nation one of the poorest countries in the world.
   Almost half of Mozambique's 15 million people require food aid.
More than 1 million people have been displaced, and the annual per
capita income is under $200.
   The rebels, known by their Portuguese acronym, RENAMO, demand a
multiparty system and free elections.
   The government and rebels held their first direct talks three
weeks ago in Rome. No major breakthroughs emerged, but more talks
are considered likely.
   Asked if RENAMO could become a legal political party, Chissano
said, ``I don't imagine that RENAMO will have any difficulty in
fulfilling the criteria.
   ``RENAMO knows the country, they have people in all the
provinces and districts. They have the possibility of creating a
base, though how big it would be, I don't know.''
   The rebels have no clear political program. They have devastated
the country with hit-and-run attacks and have been accused of
widespread civilian atrocities by the U.S. State Department and
others.
   The government controls the major cities, but the rebels are
active throughout the country in rural areas.
   No government acknowledges supporting the rebels, although South
Africa openly backed them before signing a 1984 mutual
non-aggression pact with Mozambique.
   Mozambique still receives most of its military help from the
Soviet Union. But the government has developed close ties with the
United States and other Western countries in recent years.
   Britain helps train the army and the United States is the
leading donor of food aid.

<HEAD>Arafat Guerrillas Crush Base of Iranian-Backed Fighters</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SIDON, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's guerrillas
crushed the main base of an Iranian-backed breakaway Palestinian
faction outside this port city today, then clashed with its
fighters in a nearby refugee camp.
   Police said at least six guerrillas were killed and 30 wounded.
   The fighting, beginning with a 90-minute lightning assault on
the base, was part of a Fatah crackdown on followers of renegade
Maj. Jamal Suleiman.
   It spread to Ein el-Hilweh, the largest Palestinian refugee camp
in Lebanon, after Arafat's guerrillas crushed Suleiman's main base
in Jabal al-Haleeb, or the milk mountain, on the camp's eastern
edge.
   Suleiman, 35, and about 30 of 150 fighters escaped the attack on
the milk mountain base and took refuge at the Nour, or light,
mosque in Ein el-Hilweh, where they were joined by other Sunni
Moslem fundamentalist Palestinians.
   Col. Wajih Abu Ali, commander of the Palestine Liberation
Organization's military police in the Sidon region, said the
fundamentalists fired on Fatah forces from the mosque and a nearby
alley that is their stronghold in the camp.
   He said Sheik Hisham Shreidi, a cleric connected with the
fundamentalist Hamas movement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and
Gaza, was supporting Suleiman in the fight against mainstream Fatah.
   Witnesses in Ein el-Hilweh said Shreidi and a dozen other
bearded clergymen were using the mosque's louspeakers to blare
calls for jihad, or holy war, against Arafat.
   Arafat's men, according to Col. Abu Ali, were ``responding to
the shooting.''
   One witness, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a fierce
clash was under way with automatic rifles and rocket-propelled
grenade launchers.
   ``It's a sensitive situation,'' Abu Ali said. ``Fatah cannot
easily attack a mosque to evict them. Other anti-Arafat groups
might suppport them too. The situation in the camp is very tense.''
   However, he said, by finishing off Suleiman's base at Jabal
al-Haleeb, Fatah ``eliminated a major threat to its rear guard in
the area.''
   Suleiman, who heads Ein el-Hilweh's Martyrs Battalion, has sided
with the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, in its
confrontation with the Syrian-backed Amal militia that broke out
July 16. Both militias are comprised of Shiite Moslems, Lebanon's
dominant sect.
   At least 186 people have been killed and 560 wounded in the
current round of Amal-Hezbollah clashes for control of southern
Lebanon's Iqlim al-Tuffah, or apple province, southeast of Ein
el-Hilweh.
   Fatah guerrillas joined forces with Amal against Hezbollah
because they fear a fundamentalist expansion would threaten PLO
bases in Ein el-Hilweh and the nearby Mieh Mieh camp on the
outskirts of Sidon.
   Sidon, provincial capital of southern Lebanon, is 10 miles
northwest of Iqlim al-Tuffah.
   Suleiman, who has been getting support from Hezbollah and the
Sunni Moslem Islamic Grouping extremist faction for the past year,
fired 40 rockets on Fatah's positions in Iqlim al-Tuffah on Monday,
wounding at least seven guerrillas, PLO sources said.
   They said Fatah guerrillas launched their three-pronged attack
with grenades and machine guns against Suleiman behind heavy
artillery fire, circling his 50-man garrison in Jabal al-Haleeb.
   Arafat has at least 5,000 hard-core fighters in the Sidon region.
   Representatives of the Red Cross, Amal, Hezbollah and a
1,000-strong PLO disengagement force deployed in the apple province
met behind closed doors at the headquarters of Sidon's militia
leader, Mustafa Saad, to try to enforce a cease-fire, originally
called for Sunday.

   The Social Security Administration will
schedule no more hearings for disability benefit appeals in
September if they involve travel or other outside expenses.
   However, an agency spokesman said Tuesday the decision does not
affect thousands of hearings already scheduled and does not mean
additional hearings cannot be booked.
   Philip Gambino said the hold on additional travel or outside
expenses is temporary and happens annually as the agency approaches
the end of its fiscal year in September, Gambino said.
   He denied a report published in the today's editions of the New

September because of the year-end financial crunch.
   ``We haven't canceled any hearings,'' he said.
   ``We're still going to do hearings during September,'' Gambino
said. ``I can't even tell you if we're going to do less in
September than we are in August.''
   He estimated that the agency holds some 20,000 hearings a month
at more 200 locations around the country for people who are
appealing decisions that deny or reduce the Social Security
disability benefits they receive.

   The loan to the Higher Education Assistance Fund, HEAF, buys

   A Food and Drug Administration advisory

as the first treatment shown to be effective against hepatitis C.
   Interferon alpha, a substance produced naturally in the body

already been approved for treatment of hairy-cell leukemia,
Kaposi's sarcoma and genital warts.
   The drug does not cure hepatitis C, also known as non-A, non-B
hepatitis and is not universally effective, but studies have shown
that it can alleviate some effects of the disease.
   FDA spokeswoman Faye Peterson said the advisory panel's
recommendation Tuesday included a suggestion for long-term followup
of hepatitis patients who receive the drug after it receives formal
approval.
   The advisory panel also recommended against FDA approval of
granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, or GM-CSF, one of
a new family of complex proteins that regulate production of blood

   A computerized databank of actions taken
against incompetent physicians and dentists will start operating
Sept. 1.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan said Tuesday
that the National Practitioner Databank is intended to prevent
physicians and dentists who have been disciplined from moving to
another state and setting up new practices without detection.
   The databank will store reports of malpractice actions,
licensure disciplinary actions by state medical and dental boards
and actions by professional societies, hospitals and other health
care entities after a formal peer review process.
   The reports must be made beginning Sept. 1. Actions taken before
then do not have to be reported.
   Hospitals will be required to check the databank when a
physician or dentist applies to join the medical staff or receive
clinical privileges, Sullivan said.
   Also, hospitals will be required to check the databank every two
years concerning physicians and dentists on their medical staffs or
those who have clinical privileges.
   State licensing boards also will have access to the information,
and individual physicians, dentists and other health care
professionals will be able to see their own records. Attorneys
representing a physician or dentist may have access under limited
conditions.
   Some have been critical of the data bank because members of the
public will not have access to the information and retroactive
reporting will not be required.

   A grand jury refused to indict a white
policeman who fatally shot a black teen-ager in the back, but New
Jersey's attorney general said the probe was tainted by autopsy
errors and a new panel will be convened.
   The slaying of Phillip Pannell Jr., 16, on April 10 touched off
a night of rioting in Teaneck, a New York City suburb once called a
model integrated community.
   After word of the grand jury action spread on Tuesday, officers
with riot sticks in hand milled around the Teaneck police station,
but the evening passed without incident.
   The grand jury refused to indict Officer Gary Spath, 29, who
faced charges of manslaughter and improperly using deadly force.
   Attorney General Robert Del Tufo said a serious mistake in
Pannell's autopsy by Medical Examiner Lawrence J. Denson ``led to
an incorrect conclusion concerning the possible actions of Mr.
Pannell at the time he was shot.''
   ``The mistake permeated and distorted the investigation and the
grand jury presentation. The medical examiner has admitted his
error,'' Del Tufo said.
   The attorney refused to answer questions and left the news
conference.
   Robert Galantucci, Spath's lawyer, accused Gov. Jim Florio and
Del Tufo of ``attempting to buy an indictment'' and said the call
for a new panel was unscrupulous.
   ``They shouldn't be playing politics with the grand jury
system,'' he said.
   The victim's father said he was disappointed but hopeful.
   ``This is a sad day. It's three and a half months since my son
was shot in the back for no reason,'' Pannell said.
   But he said he had a message for the youth of Teaneck: ``Chill
out.''
   ``I'm willing to give America another chance for justice,'' he
said. ``I feel justice will be served.''
   Late Tuesday, community leaders counseled Teaneck youths
gathering behind the police station not to resort to violence.
   ``Try to be calm, talk it out over the next few days,'' said Ted
Wells of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People. He urged the gathering to trust the judicial process,
calling the empaneling of a second grand jury an extraordinary step.
   ``If there was a scam they'd give no indictment, shut up and
bite the bullet,'' he said.
   A key question before the panel was whether Pannell had raised
his hands in the air and pleaded with police not to shoot, as some
witnesses said, or whether he twice stopped and turned in a
threatening way toward the officers.
   Officials close to the case say one crucial question is whether
Pannell was frisked by Officer Wayne Blanco moments before he was
shot, according to The Record of Hackensack.
   Blanco said he frisked the teen-ager and warned Spath about a
gun he felt in Pannell's jacket, according to the newspaper.
   But teen-agers with Pannell said there was no frisking before
the youngster ran, and the man whose telephone call alerted police
about a youth with a gun said he backed the youths' accounts when
he testified before the grand jury, the paper said.
   Police said they recovered from Pannell's clothing a
chrome-plated athletic starter pistol that had been modified to
fire live ammunition.
   ``We've been praying for the Pannell family all along and will
continue to pray for the Pannell family,'' Spath said at a news
conference.
   Black leaders had demanded that a special prosecutor handle the
case, but instead it was transferred from Bergen County to a state
grand jury sitting in the state capital, and a deputy attorney
general handled the case.

<TEXT>
   Reconciliation talks between Iraq
and Kuwait in their dispute over oil, borders and money apparently
collapsed today and the Iraqi delegation left for Baghdad, sources
said.
   Senior officials from the two Persian Gulf nations failed to
hold a scheduled second round of talks despite intensive
behind-the-scenes efforts by host Saudi Arabia, the sources said.
   Iraq maintained a hard-line on the two-week-old disagreement,
they said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The sources said Saudi King Fahd was expected to try to arrange
a meeting between President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and Kuwait's
emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, in an attempt to break the
impasse.
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and other Arab leaders also
were trying to defuse the tension and bring the two sides back
together.
   The most important issue on the table in Jiddah is the dispute
over the countries' joint border, which has been undemarcated since
Kuwait won independence in 1961.
   Iraq accuses Kuwait of encroaching upon the frontier and
building oil installations, military posts and farms. It has in the
past few weeks moved an estimated 100,000 troops and hundreds of
tanks on the Kuwaiti border.
   Iraq is demanding that Kuwait compensate it for $2.4 billion
worth of oil drilled from a border oilfield it claims. Iraq also
insists that Kuwait write off loans of billions of dollars Kuwait
made to it during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war.
   Iraq's had also complained about an oil glut that cost it $14
billion being caused by overproduction on the part of Kuwait and
United Arab Emirates.
   But that dispute appeared to have been settled by firm pledges
of discipline by the two countries at last week's Geneva meeting of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   On Tuesday, Kuwait had sent Crown Prince and Deputy Premier
Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah and Iraq its No. 2 leader, Izzat
Ibrahim, to Jiddah. The Saudi monarch succeeded in getting the two
leaders to kiss and embrace.
   Sheik Saad and Ibrahim, along with their delegations, met for
two hours in the presence of the Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah and
separately.
   They were feted at a dinner banquet by the Saudi monarch and had
been set to resume their peace parley this morning.

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed, Gold Regains Lost Ground</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar firmed against European currencies this
morning but dropped against the Japanese yen.
   Spot gold prices regained some of the ground lost in Tuesday's
trading in New York.
   In Tokyo, the dollar sank to its lowest level since February 23.
It closed at 146.65 yen, down 0.85 yen from Tuesday. Later in
London, the dollar was quoted at 146.12 yen.
   Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.5889 German marks, up from 1.5875
   _1.3514 Swiss francs, up from 1.3475
   _5.3315 French francs, up from 5.3210
   _1.7905 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7880
   _1,163.25 Italian lire, up from 1,162.00
   _1.1511 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1523
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8572, down from late
Tuesday's $1.8595.
   Dealers in Tokyo said institutional investors, noting the
narrowing gap between U.S. and Japanese interest rates, began
dumping dollars as soon as the Tokyo market opened and the U.S.
unit fell below 146 yen.
   Once that happened, ``there was a greater than expected demand
for the dollar below the 146-yen line,'' said Yutaka Hayashi, a
dealer with the Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank.
   Several analysts believe the dollar will sink as low as 140 yen
this summer, and perhaps dip below 1.5620 Deutsche marks, the
lowest level since World War II.
   ``There is not a lot of reason why the market should start
buying the dollar,'' said Jim O'Neil, international economist at
Swiss Bank Corp in London.
   The dollar's weakness in the foreign exchanges is helping
support gold prices, although dealers are debating whether gold has
sufficient support to move convincingly into a technical chart
resistance area between $373.00 and $375.00 an ounce.
   Gold rebounded this morning from an earlier retreat in New York,
where it was quoted at $370.20 bid late Tuesday.
   In London, gold was quoted at $371.10 per ounce at the morning
fixing, compared to $372.05 a troy ounce late Tuesday.
   The Zurich market was closed for a national holiday.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose $2.04 per ounce to close at $371.46 per
ounce.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid price of $4.83 a
troy ounce, down from $4.85.

   Cloudy skies covered much of the eastern third of the nation
early today, while the remainder of the country had mostly dry
weather.
   Showers fell early today in northern New Mexico, and scattered
rain and thunderstorms were likely across much of the South and
Texas.
   Today's forecast called for unseasonably cool temperatures in
the Northeast and Great Lakes region, with highs in the 70s.
   Skies were mostly cloudy east of the Mississippi this morning
after showers and thundershowers in the South on Tuesday caused
flooding in Odessa, Texas, and tree damage in Tupelo, Miss.
   Rain continued into the evening, falling across the Rockies and
from Delaware across eastern New York into New England.
   Thunderstorms were expected in the Dakotas, Montana, Utah and
Colorado.
   Sunshine and mild weather were forecast for the West coast, but
temperatures were to soar into the 100s in Arizona.
   The nation's high for Tuesday was 115 degrees at Borrego
Springs, Calif., and Bullhead City, Ariz.

<HEAD>Leaders To Allow Foreign Investment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In yet another move to end years of
isolation as an orthodox Communist state, Albania has announced its
intention to permit joint ventures and other forms of foreign
investment.
   The presidium of the People's Assembly, or Parliament, also
approved a decree granting limited rights to stage public
demonstrations and proposed setting up a special commission to
consider constitutional changes.
   The presidium's decisions were reported Tuesday by the state
news agency ATA in a dispatch monitored in Vienna. It did not
elaborate on the constitutional questions.
   The moves come just weeks after about 5,000 Albanians flooded
embassies in Tirana, the capital, and received permission to leave
their homeland.
   Many of the refugees complained of bleak economic prospects as
well as the lack of political freedom. Albania is Europe's poorest
country and last hard-line Communist state.
   The new economic reforms apparently are designed to help
alleviate the country's economic backwardness and provide technical
know-how.
   The decree on foreign investments stated that ``foreign
embassies, firms or individuals or Albanians residing abroad can
make investments or carry out related economic activities.''
   While the official announcement did not specifically mention
joint ventures, it said that ``enterprises with participation of
foreign capital can carry out their economic activity in various
sectors of the economy.''
   ATA said the aim of such enterprises is ``the modernization of
existing projects or the setting up of new projects with advanced
technology.''
   It said joint ventures could help in extracting and processing
raw materials, increasing exports and decreasing dependence on
imports, producing more consumer goods and creating new jobs.
   Most contracts would require government approval, ATA said.
   The presidium's decree ``on meetings, gatherings and
manifestations'' would grant Albanians only limited freedom of
assembly.
   The decree, as reported by ATA, apparently would continue to ban
most anti-government demonstrations, including protests similar to
those at embassies earlier this month.
   Such gatherings where ``appeals against the constitutional order
are launched, where calls are made for committing ... violations of
the law, where violations of relations with other countries are
aimed at, are banned,'' the ATA report said.

   Federal regulators say they were unaware that
one of an Arizona insurance executive's corporations had pleaded
guilty to a felony when they allowed him to buy 15 savings and loan
associations.
   The sale of what now is known as Bluebonnet Savings Bank of
Dallas was underwritten by taxpayers to the tune of at least $1.85
billion and perhaps $3 billion, congressional investigators say.
Bluebonnet now is among the nation's most profitable savings
institutions.
   The sale of the faltering S&amp;Ls to James M. Fail, who has
insurance operations in 47 states, was approved by the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board in December 1988, a few days before a lucrative tax
break for S&amp;L investors was to expire.
   ``While I certainly had misgivings about Mr. Fail's background,
he did not, to my knowledge at that time, fail to qualify'' to
purchase the S&amp;Ls, George M. Barclay, president of the Federal Home
Loan Bank of Dallas, told a Senate Judiciary subcommittee Tuesday.
   Barclay said he was aware that in 1976, Fail has entered into a
plea bargain that resulted in dismissal of a fraud indictment in
Alabama. The law says an indictment within the past 10 years should
serve as ``a presumptive disqualifier'' to own an S&amp;L.
   Barclay said he did not know, however, that Fail at the same
time had pleaded guilty to a felony fraud indictment on behalf of a
corporation he controlled. That plea, amounting to a conviction,
could have disqualified him.
   ``Had I understood on Dec. 22, 1988, the facts as I believe them
to be today, I certainly would have objected to Mr. Fail's
acquisition of Bluebonnet,'' Barclay testified.
   Critics in Congress are citing Bluebonnet as the worst example
of the S&amp;L mess, which now is conceded to be the biggest financial
scandal in the nation's history.
   M. Danny Wall, who at the time of the sale headed the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board, defended the choice of Fail as a buyer.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, chairman of the antitrust
subcommittee, said that if the rival group had been allowed to buy
Bluebonnet, it would have saved taxpayers $97 million.
   ``That's not true at all,'' Wall said. If the two bids were
compared on the same basis, ``the final terms of the (Bluebonnet)
negotiations were significantly better'' than those offered by
rival bidders, he said.
   Fail put up $1,000 cash to make the purchase and borrowed the
remainder of the required $70 million capital contribution,
including $10 million that was paid several weeks later than had
been agreed.
   Metzenbaum has questioned the role in the Bluebonnet affair
played by Robert J. Thompson, who was a congressional liaison for
then-Vice President Bush. Thompson refused to answer a subpoena to
testify Tuesday, and Metzenbaum said he will ask the full Judiciary
Committee to compel Thompson to comply.
   ``We believe that Mr. Thompson made good use of ... (his) access
at key junctures in the (Bluebonnet) acquisition process,''
Metzenbaum said.
   Thompson's lawyer, Stanley Brand, told reporters outside the
subcommittee hearing room that Thompson did nothing wrong and
scrupulously followed federal regulations in acting on behalf of
Fail.
   The New York Times reported in today's editions that Thompson
was able to review a 1989 draft report by the inspector general of
the bank board that found Fail should have been precluded from
buying the Texas thrifts.
   The newspaper said Thompson's lobbying firm helped regulators
prepare a response to the report.
   Thompson said in an interview in The Washington Post on Tuesday
that in exchange for helping Fail, he was paid a lobbying fee,
given a $150,000 loan and promised 2 percent of profits from
Bluebonnet. Metzenbaum said that percentage could be worth tens of
millions of dollars.
   Thompson contends the subcommittee has no jurisdiction over
banking matters and accused the panel of systematically turning
over his private documents to the Times.
   Wall, who was the top regulator of S&amp;Ls, denied any impropriety
and said he had met with Thompson only three times _ never to
discuss Bluebonnet.

   A man convicted of murdering his
2-year-old stepson after dunking him headfirst in a toilet for
breaking potty training ``doesn't know what the world's about,''
his mother says.
   A jury that convicted Thomas Coe on Monday of murder and child
abuse was to return today to decide whether to recommend death in
the electric chair or a life sentence.
   Circuit Judge Randall McDonald was to make the final decision on
Coe's sentence.
   Prosecutors requested the death penalty for Coe in Bradley
McGee's slaying July 27, 1989. A life sentence would mean 25 years
in prison with no possibility of parole.
   Coe testified that he was ``irate,'' ``steamed'' and ``out of
control'' when he plunged Bradley in a toilet as punishment for
soiling his pants. Bradley died the next day of massive injuries.
   Mary Rae Coe Anders, Coe's mother, said he should be sent to
prison because he can't cope with the pressures of life on the
outside.
   ``He feels he can't cope with society and we've even talked
about the fact that he's better off where he is,'' he said. ``He
can't cope. He doesn't know what the world's about.''
   Bradley's death came two months after he was ordered returned
from foster care to his mother and stepfather.
   Coe said he never meant to harm the child, but the state argued
the death was the culmination of weeks of torture. Medical experts
testified that Bradley's body was covered with bruises up to two
weeks old.
   Coe's wife, Sheryl McGee Coe, 21, pleaded no contest to
second-degree murder and aggravated child abuse in her son's death
and is serving a 30-year prison term.

   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
and Secretary of State James A. Baker III tried today to build on
fast-moving developments in Afghanistan to end the bloodiest
conflict dividing the superpowers.
   The diplomats began two days of talks whose centerpiece was
expected to be Afghanistan's 12-year-old civil war, which has
claimed more than 1.5 million lives and left the country in ruins.
   ``We will be able to help solve the Afghanistan question,''
Shevardnadze told reporters before his first meeting with Baker, in
an official guest house in this eastern Siberian city. He did not
elaborate.
   He also said he and Baker would complete plans for a third
summit between President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Bush,
who are to meet in Moscow by year's end. Shevardnadze said he and
Baker would try to set a date.
   Bush and Gorbachev last met in June in Washington.
   A Soviet source close to the talks said that during their
four-hour initial meeting, Shevardnadze gave Baker a 15-page
outline of areas in which the Soviet Union and the United States
could cooperate economically.
   It mentioned capital investment, elimination of double taxation
and joint work on ecology, space research and medicine, said the
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The document was in response to Baker's July 18 offer at a
meeting with Shevardnadze in Paris of U.S. technical advice to help
the Soviets salvage their failing economy.
   With democratic changes sweeping Eastern Europe and disputes
over German reunification largely settled, Washington and Moscow
are eager to end regional conflicts in Asia, such as those in
Cambodia and Afghanistan. The Afghan war is costing the superpowers
billions of dollars in weapons and economic aid.
   Baker arrived in Irkutsk early today from Singapore and goes to
Mongolia on Thursday. The Soviets invited him to the Siberian
wilderness of cedar, birch and pine trees to reciprocate for
Shevardnadze's trip to Wyoming last fall.
   The two envoys sampled nature after hopping aboard a white and
blue hydrofoil later today for a 43-mile cruise along the
tree-lined Angara River to a fishing lodge near Lake Baikal, which
contains one-sixth of the world's fresh water.
   From the log cabin, set in the forest, they boarded a small boat
to go fishing before sitting down for dinner and a second round of
talks.
   Shevardnadze and Baker are believed to be working on a formula
for a cease-fire in Afghanistan and an interim government to rule
the country.
   The Soviet-supported Afghan president, Najibullah, has been
unable to bring the U.S.-backed rebels fighting his government to
the bargaining table and Washington has been pressing for him to
step down.
   Najibullah flew to Moscow on Sunday for what Soviet officials
said was medical care, but Shevardnadze told reporters today he was
vacationing in a location other than Moscow. He would not say where.
   The Soviet source said it was a ``pure coincidence'' that
Najibullah's visit coincided with the Baker-Shevardnadze talks and
expressed confidence he would return to Afghanistan as president.
   The source said Najibullah was likely to meet during his visit
with Gorbachev, who began a vacation this week on Russia's Crimean
Peninsula.
   Aside from wanting to reduce tensions, both superpowers are
trying to end the Afghan war for economic reasons.
   The Soviet Union is anxious to reduce foreign aid so it can put
more resources into solving a domestic economic crisis that is
keeping food and consumer goods off store shelves, fueling a budget
deficit and crumbling the country's infrastructure. The $300
million a month the Kremlin reportedly spends to maintain the
Najibullah government is a likely target.
   The United States would like to trim its budget, and the Senate
Intelligence Committee has voted to cut secret aid for the Afghan
rebels from $300 million to $200 million a year.
   Soviet troops fought Moslem guerrillas in Afghanistan for nine
years after a 1978 coup that installed a Communist government.
Moscow withdrew the last of its soldiers in February 1989 under a
U.N.-brokered peace agreement, but the war continues and is at a
stalemate.
   Baker told reporters he and Shevardnadze also would discuss a
treaty to reduce strategic nuclear weapons and cuts in conventional
arms. Both sides are trying to agree on the nuclear treaty so Bush
and Gorbachev can sign it at their Moscow summit.

   African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela said he and President F.W. de Klerk had a cordial
meeting today to discuss the Communist Party's representation in
talks with the government.
   Mandela said he would comment later on Communist Party leader
Joe Slovo's standing as an ANC delegate in talks that are to begin
Monday.
   At a meeting last week, de Klerk suggested to Mandela that Slovo
be dropped from the ANC negotiating team because of police
allegations that the Communist Party was plotting a secret revolt.
   Since that meeting and today's, questions have been raised about
the accuracy of the police information given to de Klerk.
   Mandela and other ANC leaders believe significant progress could
be made at next week's talks with the government on ending
guerrilla activity, returning exiles and freeing prisoners
convicted of politically motivated crimes.
   Mandela and Slovo have denied any plot existed for a secret
revolt, and they appeared together at a Communist Party rally on
Sunday. The ANC and the Communist Party are longtime allies because
of their common opposition to apartheid. The two groups share
several top officials.
   Police have backed off their contention that Slovo was at a
meeting at which Communist Party members allegedly discussed
continuing the armed revolt while a new constitution is negotiated.
   The Communist Party released a transcript of the meeting which
does not match the one police leaked to newspapers.
   Scores of ANC and Communist Party guerrillas have been detained
without charge in the past few weeks, including Mac Maharaj, a
member of the ANC executive committee who returned to South Africa
in June under de Klerk's promise of indemnity from prosecution.
   Police contend the indemnity for past actions does not exempt
ANC leaders from prosecution for crimes they may commit while in
the country for negotiations. Police say guerrillas are continuing
to cross the border illegally, store weapons, and plan and train
for military actions.
   ANC leaders have given conflicting statements on guerrilla
activity but have generally noted that there is no cease-fire with
the government.

<HEAD>Kenyan Lawyer Says Government Held Him in Psychiatric Wing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer charged with sedition and freed
on bond accused the government today of ``extreme cruelty'' for
holding him and others similarly charged incommunicado in a prison
psychiatric wing.
   Gitobu Imanyara, who edits a monthly magazine often critical of
the government, was charged with sedition Thursday and released
Tuesday on $8,700 bond. The charge stems from the most recent issue
of The Nairobi Law Monthly, which was devoted entirely to
multiparty politics, law and democracy.
   President Daniel arap Moi and other government leaders
vehemently have rejected calls for multiparty democracy in Kenya,
claiming more than one party could lead to tribal-based political
groups and even warfare between the country's approximately 40
ethnic groups.
   Imanyara and two other lawyers were picked up in early July in a
wave of arrests that netted Kenya's most vocal proponents of
political change, including two former Cabinet ministers and the
son of Keya's first vice president.
   The three were held for 20 days without charge before being
released on July 25. But Imanyara was immediately arrested again
and charged with sedition the following day.
   Imanyara said that during his six days in jail, he was held
incommunicado in the psychiatric wing of Kamiti prison on Nairobi's
outskirts.
   He said he found others similarly charged also being held there,
including a Presbyterian minister, the Rev. Lawford Ndege Imunde,
who was sentenced in March to six years imprisonment for having
been found with allegdly seditious entries in his desk diary.
   Imanyara, who was imprisoned from 1982 to 1985 after defending
120 air force officers charged in a coup attempt, described the
conditions a Kamiti as ``extreme cruelty.''
   He said he and the others were kept in solitary confinment and
never allowed to leave their unlighted cells.
   He said toilet paper and tooth brushes were not provided, and a
single chamber pot per prisoner was supposed to serve as wash basin
and toilet.
   Imanyara said they were given two blankets and fed cornmeal mush
for breakfast and beans at night.
   ``The conditions are about 20 times worse than detention,'' he
said. ``I am really concerned about the people in that place.''
   He said that in addition to Imunde, the others he found in the
psychiatric wing were former detainees George Anyona, Edward Oyugi
and Isaiah Ngotho Kariuki, and a rural ruling party official,
Augustine Gathangu. They also were arrested in the government
crackdown and were charged last week with sedition.
   Attorneys for Anyona, Oyugi, Kariuki and Gathangu charged at a
bail hearing Tuesday that their clients had been tortured. The
judge refused to set bail and adjourned the hearing until Aug. 7 to
give the government time to respond.

   A small crowd threw several rocks and bottles
toward television crews after a police cruiser struck and killed a
man who stepped into its path, police said.
   The officer was chasing a ``traffic violator'' when the accident
occurred shortly before 10 p.m. Tuesday in the impoverished Liberty
City neighborhood, said Metro-Dade police spokeswoman Miriam Royle.
   The cruiser was traveling at normal speed with its emergency
lights off when the unidentified man stepped into the road and was
killed instantly, Royle said.
   The police officer, whose name was not released, was treated and
released at a nearby hospital. The cruiser's windshield was smashed
by the man's body.
   Police brought in more than a dozen additional units and blocked
off the road after more than 100 people gathered at the scene.
Officers calmed down the crowd, which dwindled after 11:30 p.m.,
and made no arrests.

   Filipino miners recovered nine bodies
today from the ruins of a luxury hotel, and doctors said at least
one of them apparently lived for a week after a massive earthquake
destroyed the building July 16.
   More than 45 people, including 30 guests, remain unaccounted for
in the rubble of the Hyatt Terraces Hotel, said Gus Baloy, a hotel
official.
   The U.S. Embassy said 12 of those missing at the Hyatt were
Americans of Filipino descent.
   In Manila, Jose de Jesus, the government official in charge of
relief and rescue operations in Baguio, said there were 1,500
families living in evacuation centers in the resort.
   Baguio, 130 miles north of Manila, was one of the cities hit
hardest by the quake. It registered 7.7 on the Richter scale and
killed more than 1,600 people. In Baguio, at least 400 people died.
   Foreign rescue teams abandoned hope of finding survivors in
Baguio more than a week ago, but local miners and volunteers
stepped up their search after the discovery Friday of two people
alive in the ruins of the Hyatt. On Monday, another person was
found alive in the hotel.
   The nine victims found today were all hotel employees.
   A doctor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said one of them
may have lived for a week after the quake. He said the body, that
of a woman, bore no life-threatening injuries.
   Mining engineer Alex Santiago said miners' hopes were raised
after Pedrito Dy, 27, a hotel cook and part-time gym instructor,
was rescued Monday. Dy said he survived 14 days under the rubble by
drinking rainwater and his own urine.
   Two days earlier, miners alerted by cries of ``Help us!''
rescued Luisa Mallorca, 20, and security guard Arnel Calabia, 26.
   The three are recovering in hospitals.
   Santiago said miners will continue searching the rubble. They
have recovered 40 bodies from the Hyatt.
   Pablo Binwag, another miner, said he believes there are still
survivors to be found. ``As long as those people trapped inside
believe and have faith in God, they will survive,'' he said.
   The official death toll from the quake is 1,653. Another 1,000
people are missing and presumed dead, and 3,000 were seriously
injured. About 110,000 people were left homeless.

<HEAD>Inquiry Finds Pilot, Airport Error, Led to Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pilot error and lack of routine guidance
from air traffic controllers led to the 1988 crash of an Indian
Airlines plane that killed all but two of the 135 people on board,
an inquiry published today said.
   Press Trust of India quoted the report from the
government-appointed inquiry as saying there was no structural or
mechanical failure involved in the crash of the 17-year-old jet.
   The Boeing 737, on a flight from Bombay to the western state of
Gujarat, crashed in fog while approaching the airport.
   The report, which was submitted to the Civil Aviation Ministry
in January 1989, was published today in keeping with the
government's decision to make public reports on air accidents, the
press agency said.
   The inquiry report charged authorities at Ahmedabad airport with
failing to provide proper navigational aids and meteorological
information to the aircraft.
   At the time of the accident, news reports said that approach
lights at the airport were unserviceable and there was no proper
firefighting services.
   The report also attributed the crash to pilot error, but did not
give details. The report did, however, say co-pilot Deepak Nagpal
was ``not experienced enough to effectively assist'' the pilot.
   Both Nagpal and the pilot were killed.
   Indian Airlines operates an average of 240 flights per day. It
flies to 73 Indian cities and nine neighboring countries.

<HEAD>Georgia Second Republic to Disobey Decree to Turn in Weapons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The republic of Georgia followed neighboring
Armenia today in at least temporarily rejecting a presidential
order to confiscate weapons from illegal groups.
   The Tass news agency quoted Communist Party chief Givi
Gumbaridze as saying the decree would not be implemented before the
republic's parliament resumes work Aug. 17.
   Lawmakers in Armenia voted Monday night to defy President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's order that illegal groups throughout the
Soviet Union turn in their weapons and disband, the Armenian
National Movement said. The order was issued July 25 and gave
groups 15 days to comply.
   The Soviet interior minister, Vadim A. Bakatin, said military
force might be used if necessary to restore law and order when the
15 days are up.
   A spokesman for the Armenian parliament, Ovanes Muradian, said
the parliament decided the decree ``contradicts the natural right
of the Armenian people for self-defense.''
   The decree was Gorbachev's latest attempt to control ethnic
unrest in the southern Caucasus and Central Asian republics. The
violence has killed more than 400 people in the last two years and
caused widespread damage.

<HEAD>Newspaper Links Four East German Government Ministers to Secret
Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper today linked four
ministers in East Germany's coalition government to the now-defunct
secret police.
   The Bonn-based newspaper Die Welt did not name the four
officials but said they were suspected of having been ``informal or
full-time employees of the Ministry for State Security'' _ the
secret police.
   It said two of the ministers were from Prime Minister Lothar de
Maiziere's Christian Democratic Union and one each from the Social
Democrats and the Liberal faction in Parliament.
   The newspaper, without citing sources, said the information was
discovered in background checks of all 400 members of Parliament
and eight government ministers. It said de Maiziere was not
implicated.
   Over the weekend, two newspapers reported that 24 members of de
Maiziere's party in Parliament had once worked for the secret
police, called the Stasi.
   The East Berlin Der Morgen newspaper said it based its
information on a letter reportedly sent to the 24 by a party
leader, Guenther Krause, who asked them not to take on any
``important political mandate'' in a future all-German Parliament.
Krause has denied there was such a letter.
   The Christian Democrats are the largest party in East Germany
and govern in a large coalition. Their Western counterpart, West
Germany's Christian Democrats, are the leading party in Bonn.
   The parties plan to merge before the planned December elections
and are expected to fare strongly in the balloting.

<HEAD>Kin of Former Mexican President Found Guilty in DEA Slaying</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. government's drive to avenge the
torture-slaying of drug agent Enrique Camarena scored another
victory with the conviction of the brother-in-law of a former
Mexican president.
   Ruben Zuno Arce, 59, was found guilty Tuesday of racketeering,
kidnapping and conspiracy in the 1985 slaying and could receive
life in prison at sentencing Sept. 18.
   Two co-defendants were convicted earlier in the federal court
trial. The jury was to return today to continue deliberating the
fate of a fourth defendant.
   Zuno, a Guadalajara businessman, was not charged with murder.
Prosecutors portrayed him as a man with ties to drug barons seeking
revenge for U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration raids in Mexico
that cost them $5 billion in profits.
   The Camarena case has strained relations between the United
States and Mexico because of U.S. allegations of complicity between
Mexican officials and drug dealers.
   The DEA has vowed to capture every person involved in the
slaying. Twenty-two people have been charged in the United States.
In a 1988 trial in Los Angeles, three defendants were convicted for
their part in the case.
   Zuno is one of the most prominent defendants convicted so far.
Prosecutors claimed he wielded enormous political clout because of
his sister's marriage to Luis Echeverria, president of Mexico from
1970 to 1976.
   Two paid government informants who were former Mexican policemen
testified against Zuno. One told of seeing him at a meeting in
which drug traffickers discussed the need to kidnap a drug agent.
   Zuno's lawyers said he merely had the bad luck to sell his
Guadalajara home to drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, who used it as
Camarena's torture chamber.
   The 31-year-old Camarena was kidnapped off a Guadalajara street
in 1985. Testimony and a gruesome tape recording showed the agent
was interrogated and tortured before being slain.

   Two British Rail passenger trains
collided today when an arriving train was switched to the wrong
platform, and 29 people were taken to a hospital for treatment.
   The driver of one train was the most seriously injured. He
suffered leg, head and back injuries and was trapped in his crushed
cab for more than two hours.
   He was given four units of blood as firemen struggled to cut him
free. ``He was conscious throughout, talking to staff and lucid,''
said Peter Taylor, the ambulance incident officer.
   A Berkshire Royal Hospital spokesman confirmed that 29 injured
people had been received there, and 15 had been discharged by
mid-afternoon.
   Thames Valley police said an unknown number of other passenger
were less seriously injured and not taken to the hospital. A
preliminary police report had said that a total of 34 people were
injured in the crash.
   Four doctors and 11 ambulances went to the scene of the crash
which British Rail said was reported at 9:24 a.m. at the station 35
miles west of London.
   A British Rail spokesman said a three-car train from Tonbridge,
traveling at 20 mph hit the Reading to London-Waterloo train, which
was about to depart.
   Knowles Mitchell, British Rail Western Region public affairs
manager, said the railway was investigating why the Tonbridge train
was switched to the wrong platform.
   British Rail said there were 100 to 150 passengers on the
Tonbridge train, but offered no estimate of the number aboard the
Waterloo train.
   ``Everyone was thrown forward, and we were all just sitting
there, wondering what had happened,'' said Debra Whitehead, a
passenger on the Tonbridge train. ``I was in the third carriage
from the front, but there was no panic, just confusion.
   Bernadette Currie said she had just stood up, preparing to leave
the train, when she was ``jolted forward and hit the wood of the
sliding door. Some of my teeth were knocked out.''
   In July 1989, two British rail workers were killed when two
trains carrying track maintenance workers collided in west London.
   In March 1989, five died and 94 were injured when two passenger
trains collided near Purley station on London's southern outskirts.
   On Dec. 12, 1988, there were 35 deaths and more than 100 other
people were injured in a three-train collision during the morning
rush hour at Clapham Junction in south London. That crash was
blamed on faulty wiring in a signal.

<TEXT>
   Fifteen years after the last U.S. troops
pulled out of Vietnam, Save the Children hopes to become the first
American service organization to return to the Southeast Asian
country.
   The Westport-based international child assistance agency reached
agreement last month with the government of Vietnam's poorest
province, Thanh Hoa, to start a long-term program aimed at
increasing food production, improving education and curbing
malnutrition.
   ``It's a special opportunity,'' Joy Carol, director of the
organization's Asia Pacific programs, said Tuesday. ``We were
working in Vietnam from 1963 to 1975. Now we are returning because
we know the need is so great there.''
   Carol also called the program, which is scheduled to begin in
November, a ``project of reconciliation and healing.''
   The program, which has the endorsement of the Vietnamese Mission
to the United Nations and the Vietnam Veterans of America
Foundation, is a pilot project which, if successful, may be
extended to other areas of Vietnam.
   It represents the first time Save the Children will provide
long-term service to a country that does not have diplomatic
relations with the United States.

<HEAD>Construction Spending Flat in June</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction spending was flat in June after
two consecutive monthly declines, the government said today in a
report pointing to further evidence of weakness in the building
industry.
   The Commerce Department reported that residential,
non-residential and government construction spending totaled a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $447.5 billion.
   But it also said the declines in April and May were not as
severe as first reported. The April decline was revised from 2.2
percent to 1.9 percent and the May drop was changed from 0.4
percent to 0.3 percent. Spending had risen 0.4 percent in March.
   Despite the recent weakness, construction spending in June was
3.7 percent above that of the same month in 1989, when it totaled
$431.6 billion.
   Spending in January and February posted large gains which
analysts attributed to unseasonably warm weather that prompted some
builders to steal activity scheduled for later in the year.
   In addition, high interest rates and tighter lending
requirements have held back construction projects in some areas.
   The industry weakness was suggested in the Labor Department's
recent report showing a loss of 14,000 construction jobs in June on
top of a 179,000 decline during the three previous months.
   Residential spending declined 2.2 percent to $196.1 billion at
an annual rate after falling an identical 2.2 percent the previous
month.
   Single-family spending was off 3.5 percent to $111.3 billion at
an annual rate following a 4.0 percent decline in May.
   Apartment construction was unchanged at $30.8 billion after
rising 1.5 percent the previous month.
   Non-residential spending jumped 3.9 percent to $107.1 billion
after falling 0.9 percent in May. Leading the increase was a 10.2
percent gain in spending on office buildings.
   The often-volatile government sector edged down 0.1 percent to
$108.4 billion after advancing 3.8 percent in May.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Christians, led by
white-robed nuns, marched to Prime Minister V.P. Singh's house
today to protest the alleged rape of two nuns last month.
   India's 10,000 Christian-run private schools and colleges closed
to protest the alleged rapes on July 13 at a Roman Catholic convent
in a small town in the northern Uttar Pradesh state.
   Seven nuns holding hands led the demonstrators who chanted, ``We
want justice!'' as they marched the two miles from India Gate, a
British-built war memorial, to Singh's house.
   Police estimated that 15,000 people took part in the protest.
That would make it the largest demonstration outside the prime
minister's residence since Singh took office in December.
   ``We want assurances that what has happened will not happen
again. We want protection for every single woman,'' Shruti Sinha,
19, said in a speech at the rally. Miss Sinha is a student at a
college attached to the convent.
   The alleged rapes at St. Mary's Convent at Gajraula, 75 miles
east of New Delhi, triggered widespread criticism of the state
police.
   Christians organizations accused the police of ``inaction'' and
a ``callous attitude'' toward the victims.
   The Sunday Observer newspaper said it was the first time since
1948 that a nun had been raped in India.
   Convent authorities allege that three men broke into the Roman
Catholic convent, slipped into the nuns' quarters through a
ventilator and ransacked several rooms. The convent authorities say
the men then raped two nuns and stole $7,000.
   Two men have been arrested in connection with the reported
crimes, but no date has been set for the trial. The two men
admitted to stealing the money, but have denied raping the women.
   Protest organizers said many non-Christian social organizations,
women's groups and a Sikh political party attended the rally.
   A 13-member delegation from the rally also gave a memorandum to
Singh. The demonstrators then sat on the road near his home singing
protest songs and waving placards that read ``Rape is a stain on
the soul of a woman.''
   There are about 23 million Christians, including 13 million
Roman Catholics, living in India, a nation of 880 million people.

<TEXT>
   A day after hundreds of refugees were
massacred in a church sanctuary, government troops staged a
surprise counterattack and recaptured parts of the city center from
rebels in heavy fighting.
   One area touched by the intense combat Tuesday was the
diplomatic enclave.
   At the height of the fighting, bullets ricocheted off several
U.S. Embassy buildings, but no one was hurt, Assistant Secretary of
State Herman Cohen said in Washington.
   ``None of the combatants have targeted our people,'' he said.
   The United States said it was considering calling for a U.N.
peacekeeping force to intervene in the West African nation's
7-month-old tribal war.
   State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said there
were no plans to evacuate the 400 Americans remaining in Liberia. A
U.S. naval flotilla has been offshore for weeks in case evacuation
is required.
   President Samuel Doe, who rebels accuse of corruption and
suppression of opposition, made his first public statement since
rebels reached the city's suburbs more than a month ago. Doe
reiterated he does not intend to surrender.
   He said he would ``fight until the last soldiers in the Liberian
army die.''
   He spoke from the fortified Israeli-built presidential mansion,
under siege by rebel forces led by Prince Johnson.
   The battles came a day after up to 600 civilian refugees were
killed in a suburban St. Peter's Lutheran church compound.
Witnesses said government troops, who used cutlasses and bayonets
in addition to bullets, were to blame
   Doe said rebels dressed as soldiers were responsible for the
massacre.
   ``I do not want to believe that the armed forces of Liberia
would just walk into a church and kill innocent people,'' he said
Tuesday in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.
   The victims were members of the Gio and Mano tribes, from which
the rebels get most of their support. Soldiers accused of the
massacre were said by witnesses to belong to Doe's Krahn tribe.
   In Rome, Pope John Paul II today decried the massacres of
civilians in Liberia and appealed for an end to the ``fratricidal
struggle'' in the African nation. The appeal was the pope's third
since the fighting escalated.
   In Tuesday's government attack, about 500 soldiers emerged from
Barclay Training Center, the main barracks in the capital, and took
scattered rebel troops by surprise, witnesses said.
   Doe's soldiers advanced behind their sole remaining tank toward
two strategic bridges leading from downtown Monrovia north to
Bushrod Island, site of the capital's port and launching point of
the rebel invasion of the city.
   In seesaw battles with rebels led by Johnson, government forces
recaptured the finance and defense ministries and fought their way
through the main shopping district.
   The counterattack led to heavy fighting in the embassy enclave
of Mamba Point, which the rebels took Monday. Overall control of
the area remained unclear.
   Two bullets landed in the garden of the French Embassy, which
backs onto the Atlantic Ocean and neighbors the U.S. Embassy. No
one was hurt.
   A high-rise building in the city center suspected of being a
rebel observation point was set afire with a salvo from the
government's multibarrel rocket-launcher, witnesses reported.
   The streets of downtown, filled for several days with civilians
searching for food, suddenly emptied. Shops, offices and ministries
remained closed.
   Most of Monrovia's 500,000 inhabitants have been without food,
running water or electricity since last month.
   Doe said he was ``not prepared to hand Liberia over to
criminals.'' This apparently referred to embezzlement charges
against another rebel leader, Charles Taylor, who fled Liberia
after he was accused of stealing $1 million from state coffers
while he headed the government procurement agency.
   Government troops have kept Taylor's forces at bay just outside
the city to the east.
   About 5,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in the war,
which began when the rebels invaded from neighboring Ivory Coast in
December.
   Doe has admitted his troops attacked refugees at the U.N.
compound on May 30, killing an unarmed security guard and abducting
30 people who were later killed. The United Nations withdrew its
personnel in protest.
   St. Peter's remained inaccessible to most foreign reporters and
doctors on Tuesday. Volunteer nurses tending to the nearly 100
wounded at the church were hampered by lack of equipment and
vehicles, diplomats said.
   The European humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders said
government troops fired on doctors who rushed to aid the massacre
victims. In a communique, the group said its team performed more
than 30 operations despite threats against the doctors' lives by
soldiers.
   Witnesses who managed to penetrate government lines said the
soldiers again attacked civilian refugees Monday at the nearby J.J.
Roberts Memorial School, killing at least four people.
   Relief workers and diplomats for weeks have expressed fears of
such attacks on the city's 15 refugee centers and embassies
sheltering people who fear tribal reprisals from both government
troops and rebels.

   Dynamite exploded while being
transported inside a coal mine, killing three men and injuring two
others and hurling a 5-ton mine vehicle 60 feet, officials said.
   ``She always wished he didn't have to work in the mines, that he
could find a better job,'' Penny Simpson said of her cousin
Willette, whose husband, Robert Cox, was one of those killed. Mrs.
Cox, 20, has three small children.
   Investigators have not determined how much dynamite was being
carried in the coal-hauling scoop on the front of the mine vehicle
or how it was detonated.
   ``One stick would have killed them, and we're talking cases,''
Knox County Coroner Jerry Garland said.
   The explosion occurred Tuesday about 500 feet underground in Big
Mama Coal Co.'s Mine No. 1 in Granny Rose Hollow about 10 miles
southwest of Barbourville in southeastern Kentucky.
   A preliminary investigation indicated the explosives might not
have been transported in the correct containers, said Willard
Stanley, commissioner of the state Department of Mines and Minerals.
   The explosion blew the half-inch-thick steel scoop to bits and
hurled the 5-ton vehicle more than 60 feet down the shaft, said
Leroy Gross, district supervisor for the department.
   The mine was a non-union operation working a coal seam 24 inches
thick, said Kathy Snyder, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Mine Safety
and Health Administration.
   The mine had received seven citations since it opened in
mid-March, according to a spokesman for the federal agency. The
agency said none of the seven citations involved handling of
explosives or ventilation.
   State mine-safety records show the mine had recurrent problems
controlling loose coal and coal dust _ which is explosive in
certain conditions _ and supporting the mine roof properly.
   The company, owned by Robert Hembree of Barbourville, reported
one mining fatality in 1987, its only death in the last five years,
state records show.
   Eight men have died in mining accidents in Kentucky so far this
year.

   A man who claims to have
helped eight fellow AIDS patients commit suicide says he has made
arrangements to take his own life rather than face the most
agonizing stages of the disease.
   ``I have people in my life who will help me end my life if I get
too uncomfortable,'' David Lewis said in an interview Tuesday after
his release from St. Paul's Hospital. He spent two weeks in the
hospital with an AIDS-related illness.
   ``I'm terrified. I am not interested at all in getting
Alzheimer's or AIDS dementia. If I get that far, I have instructed
several people to say, `That's it, no more medication.'''
   The 38-year-old director of the Vancouver Persons With AIDS
Society says he has been diagnosed as having lymphoma and
toxoplasmosis in his brain, ``and it doesn't speak well for the
future.''
   ``They won't say how long I've got, but I've worked with people
with AIDS for years and I know it's a couple of months _ if you're
lucky,'' he said.
   Lewis recently announced that he had helped eight people
suffering from acquired immune deficiency syndrome to commit
suicide by getting them fatal doses of prescription drugs.
   In an interview at the time, he described euthanasia _ the
termination of life when a person is terminally ill and wants to
die _ as ``dignified, compassionate and respectful.''

<HEAD>Sudan to Ask U.N. for More Relief for Government-Held Areas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sudan will ask the United Nations to give
more relief supplies to government-held areas in the embattled
south and less to rebel-controlled regions, a cabinet minister said
today.
   Peter Orat, minister of relief and displaced people, was quoted
by the government-owned al-Inkaz al-Watany newspaper as saying that
a U.N. team of experts would survey areas in western and southern
Sudan next week to verify government claims that displaced
inhabitants have returned home.
   The government has claimed that some rebel-held areas had been
recaptured by government forces leading to the repatriation of
refugees to those areas.
   Orat said a previous agreement with the United Nations set the
ratio of relief distribution at 33 percent for rebel-held areas and
67 percent to government-controlled areas. He said the government
will ask the United Nations to change those ratios to reflect the
repatriation of the refugees.
   Also today, the military government freed 18 trade unionists who
were in custody on suspicion of instigating strikes, the official
Sudan News Agency reported. SUNA said the releases were ``a good
gesture from the revolution and a move to allow them to open a new
page.''
   Sudan's powerful trade and professional unions played an
important role in overthrowing President Gaafar Nimeiri in 1985.
They were active in Sudanese politics until Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan
el-Bashir dissolved the unions shortly after taking power in a
military coup in June 1989.
   After coming to power, el-Bashir's government arrested scores of
unionists and made strikes illegal.
   The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army took up arms against
the government in 1983, demanding greater autonomy and economic
reforms in southern Sudan. The fighting created famines that killed
hundreds of thousands of civilians.
   In 1989, a U.N.-coordinated relief operation dubbed Operation
Lifeline Sudan was successful in averting a repeat of the 1988
starvation which U.N. officials said killed 260,000 people.
   The U.N. operation has continued in 1990 at a smaller scale, and
is facing political and logistical problems from the government and
the rebels.

<TEXT>
   South Pacific nations today criticized
a U.S. plan to burn chemical weapons on a remote Pacific atoll and
said they would not allow the region to become ``the toxic waste
disposal center of the world.''
   But the communique, issued by the 15-nation South Pacific Forum
at the end of a two-day meeting, stopped short of condemning the
United States.
   The chemical weapons, which were stockpiled in West Germany and
elsewhere, are to be destroyed at an incinerator now being tested
on the Johnson Atoll.
   The United States has agreed to move its entire stockpile of
chemical weapons out of West Germany by the end of the year.
   Also to be destroyed are 1,200 tons of weapons already on
Johnston Atoll, which are so badly corroded by sea air they cannot
be moved. In addition, a leaking stockpile of about 100 U.S.
mustard-gas rounds dating from World War II recently was found in
the Solomon Islands.
   Despite assurances from Washington, the Pacific leaders said
they ``remained concerned by the substantial potential risks to the
environment'' of the incineration of the chemical weapons.
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke of Australia argued in favor of the
plan, saying scientific evidence indicated the incineration was
safe. He said the project was in the interests of worldwide
disarmament.
   The communique called for the incinerator to stop operating when
the current project is completed.
   The Pacific leaders, whose governments represent about 25
million people, will discuss the issue Friday with a U.S.
delegation.
   Also on hand for discussions will be representatives of Canada,
China, Britain, Japan and France.
   On a related matter, many Pacific leaders also strongly object
to French nuclear testing in Polynesia.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze has
invited his Israeli counterpart, David Levy, to talks on resolving
the Middle East conflict, an Israeli official said today.
   The official from Israel's Foreign Ministry, who briefed
reporters on condition of anonymity, said Shevardnadze's invitation
was given verbally by the leading Soviet consular delegate in
Israel, Alexei Chestakov.
   The Soviet Union severed diplomatic relations with Israeli
following the 1967 Middle East war but has been gradually improving
ties since stationing consular representatives in Tel Aviv three
years ago.
   A Shevardnadze-Levy meeting would not be the first between the
Soviet foreign minister and a high-ranking Israeli official.
   Shevardnadze met last year with former Foreign Minister Moshe
Arens, like Levy a member of the right-wing Likud bloc, and also
met with former Science Minister Ezer Weizman, a leading dove in
the left-leaning Labor Party.
   Chestakov told Levy in a meeting Tuesday that Shevardnadze
believes the Soviet Union should ``give high priority to doing
something immediate to lessen tensions in the Middle East,'' the
Foreign Ministry official said.
   No date was set for the meeting, but it was likely the two would
meet in New York City in September, when foreign ministers
customarily attend the opening sessions of the U.N. General
Assembly.
   Repeated efforts by the United States to initiate talks between
Israel and representatives of the Palestinians have repeatedly
stalled. Israel has refused to meet with members of the PLO, which
Palestinians, who have been waging an uprising in the occupied
territories, say is their sole representative.
   The Soviet Union is the key military supplier of Syria, Israel's
most implacable foe in the Middle East.
   In the meeting with Chestakov, Levy urged the Soviets to quickly
resume full diplomatic ties with Israel. The lack of such ties
``legitimizes the Arab hostile position toward Israel,'' Levy was
quoted as saying.
   The Soviet Union has refused to resume diplomatic ties until
Israel moves toward making peace with Palestinians.
   The Moroccan-born Levy, 52, holds the No. 2 spot in Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc.
   He took office when Shamir's coalition was installed on June 11.
His August trip to Washington will be his first as foreign minister.

   The Chinese army celebrated its 63rd anniversary
today with little fanfare but with renewed calls for strengthening
the political and moral fiber of the nation's fighting force.
   Last year a media barrage surrounded the Aug. 1 anniversary
designed to repair the army's image after the military crackdown on
the pro-democracy movement in Beijing. But this year, the even got
little publicity.
   Tiananmen Square, closed last year for a military awards
ceremony, was open today and filled with tourists. Neither the
square nor adjoining Chang'an Avenue were decorated for Army Day.
   The Communist Party People's Daily carried a speech by party
chief Jiang Zemin on its front page, but there were no red
headlines, a tradition on major holidays.
   In the days prior to Aug. 1, speeches and newspaper commentaries
emphasized that the army is subordinate to the Communist Party and
that political education must be strengthened.
   Jiang told the nation in a televised speech Tuesday night that
``the basic factor in strengthening army construction is to persist
in the party's absolute leadership over the army.''
   ``Only by upholding the party's leadership can the army maintain
its proletariat nature ... And maintain its correct political
direction,'' he said.
   Jiang urged soldiers to ``enthusiastically study
Marxist-Leninist theory, vigorously improve the quality of their
ideolgocial thought ... And strengthen (their) ability to resist
bourgeois liberalization and other corrosive, decadent influences.''
   Bourgeois liberalization refers to Western ideas.
   Marshal Nie Rongzhen, one of the last surviving of China's 10
marshals, said in an interview published earlier this week that
``political integrity'' was just as important as ability in
selecting officers.
   Alluding to a well-known saying by revolutionary leader Mao
Tse-tung that power comes from the barrel of a gun, Nie said: ``The
barrels of guns are very important (but) even more important is
whose hand the barrels of guns are in.''
   His words were echoed in a commentary in the army newspaper, the
PLA Daily, which called on educational facilities, particularly
military academies, to ``firmly place moral (or political)
education in the number one position.''
   ``Whether army school graduates are politically up to standard
is in direct relation to who has control of the barrel of the
gun,'' the unsigned commentary said.

<HEAD>House Speaker Denounces Murder of British MP</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Thomas Foley today denounced the
Irish Republican Army for the murder of British Parliament member
Ian Gow and said the bombing would not stifle political efforts to
make peace.
   ``The clear and despicable purpose of this callous act was
intimidation through terror,'' Foley said in an unusual speech on
the House floor. Traditionally, House speakers do not take to the
floor to speak about non-legislative matters.
   ``Reconciliation and necessary economic change cannot be
purchased with the gun and the bomb,'' he said.
   Gow, a Conservative and a close friend of Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, was killed Monday when a bomb detonated in his
car at his home. Gow was an outspoken foe of the IRA.
   ``The IRA's guns and bombs have not brought independence for
Northern Ireland, nor will they. They haven't brought jobs or the
elimination of sectarian discrimination, nor will they. What they
have bought, in the years since British troops were sent to
Northern Ireland in 1972, is the deaths of many more civilian
bystanders than of soldiers or policemen,'' Foley said.
   ``The IRA pretend to be the protector of the Catholic minority,
but the IRA is responsible for the deaths of many more Catholics
than protestants _ in fact, many more deaths than can be attributed
to the British forces or the police.''
   Neither, Foley added, will violence deter ``open discourse and
the pursuit of peaceful political agreement among freely elected
governments and legislatures.''
   He expressed ``strong solidarity with our sister House in
Westminster in its time of duress and sorrow,'' and concluded by
urging that ``whatever the governments of Ireland and of the United
Kingdom may resolve with respect to Northern Ireland, they do so
without any reference, and in common defiance, to the terror
tactics of the IRA.''

<HEAD>Newspaper: Company Got $368,000 From Cashiers Who Confessed to

<TEXT>
   A convenience store chain, some of whose
employees say they were forced to sign false admissions of theft,
collected $368,000 from cashiers who confessed, The Philadelphia
Inquirer reported today.
   The newspaper said it obtained internal documents from
Cumberland Farms Inc. that say the company obtained confessions
from 57 percent of the 2,600 cashiers it questioned about theft
during a six-month period.
   In recent weeks, the Inquirer has reported that 154 Cumberland
Farms cashiers said they were falsely accused of stealing money and
goods, then coerced to make restitution.
   The latest report was based on documents reporting on the
performance of 15 ``loss prevention'' specialists at Cumberland
Farms. They covered the first six months of 1986.
   The reports had been sent to the company's president at the
time, Demetrios B. Haseotes, by James M. Mumma, director of loss
prevention, and also went to the loss-prevention specialists, the
newspaper said.
   Twelve former Cumberland Farms cashiers claimed in a 1986
lawsuit that the company had a longstanding policy to recover
legitimate inventory losses by obtaining false confessions from
employees. The lawsuit is awaiting trial in U.S. District Court in
Camden, N.J.
   Foster G. Macrides, vice president for human resources, has said
the Canton, Mass.-based convenience store and petroleum
distribution company ``categorically denies'' the allegations in
the lawsuit. He has said he could not comment on the other claims
raised in recent Inquirer articles.
   He declined to comment on the documents disclosed today by the
newspaper.
   Cumberland Farms has 1,100 stores and more than 9,000 employees
in New England, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Florida.
   It was listed by Forbes magazine last December as the nation's
35th largest privately held U.S. company with an estimated $3
billion in revenue.

<TEXT>
   The military filed murder charges
today against three American drug agents and 13 Filipino policemen
in the slaying of three soldiers killed during an alleged drug bust
last month.
   Officials in Washington said today that the charges against the
three American agents ``have no merit,'' that the men have been
removed from the Philippines, and that they will not return to
stand trial.
   The charges were filed with the provincial prosecutor against
Philip Needham, Andrew Fenrich and Jake Fernandez, agents of the
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, according to Brig. Gen.
Gerardo Flores, chief of staff of the Philippine Constabulary.
   Flores said 10 of the 16 were charged before a military court.
Under Philippine law, prosecutors decide whether to indict those
charged by police.
   The U.S. Embassy said the three Americans have left the country
and ``have no immediate plans to return.'' Needham was assigned to
the DEA office in Bangkok, Thailand, and the others were posted in
Manila.
   In Bangkok, Needham said he had no comment on the incident and
referred all further inquiries to the Drug Enforcement
Administration in Washington.
   ``These charges have no merit,'' DEA Administrator Terrence
Burke said in a statement issued in Washington today.
   DEA spokesman Joe Keefe, who confirmed the three agents have
left the Philippines, said in Washington that the men didn't even
use their firearms on the day the shooting incident occurred.
   ``We would like to emphasize that the DEA agents were working at
the request of the Philippines government in cooperation with the
National Bureau of Investigation,'' he said.
   ``We're cooperating with the Philippine government on this
situation,'' Keefe said, but he added that there are no plans to
return the three DEA agents to the Philippines to face the murder
charges.
   The charges stem from a July 10 incident in which Col. Rolando
de Guzman, deputy chief of the Northern Luzon Command; his
intelligence officer, Maj. Frank Calanog; and another soldier were
slain in what police said was a shootout during a drug bust.
   According to the National Bureau of Investigation, de Guzman and
the others tried to sell $10 million worth of heroin to Needham,
who was posing as a buyer. Shooting broke out when the three
resisted arrest, the bureau claims.
   But Flores said his investigation showed the three were slain
``under the control'' of police and ``could not have fired their
weapons.''
   Brig. Gen. Virgilio David, chief of the military's Narcotics
Command, called the slayings ``cold-blooded murder.''
   ``The high values in law enforcement are taken into
consideration and to prevent crimes,'' Flores said. ``We arrest
suspects, not kill them.''
   Embassy officials have not given a detailed account of what they
believe transpired.
   Ten of the Filipinos ordered arrested are members of the Manila
police department detailed to the National Bureau of Investigation
during the case. They include Capt. Reynaldo Jaylo, cited by
President Corazon Aquino last month as one of the country's
outstanding police officers.
   The three others are assigned to the National Bureau of
Investigation and include Epimaco Velasco, assistant to Bureau
Director Alfredo Lim.
   When Lim announced the shootout last month, he told reporters
that an American, later identified as Needham, ``escaped.''
   The next day, however, the Philippine Daily Inquirer quoted
unidentified military sources as saying Needham was a DEA agent
from Bangkok.
   Military sources said on condition of anonymity that senior
officers suspect the killing was a plot by the CIA to drive a wedge
between the military and the police and encourage a coup attempt
against Mrs. Aquino.
   The U.S. Embassy for years has denied repeated speculation that
Washington was secretly supporting coup plots to force the
Philippines into extending the lease on the six U.S. military
bases. The lease expires next year.
   Senior officers, speaking on condition of anonymity, expressed
outrage that National Bureau of Investigation agents had
``murdered'' their comrades ``on orders of the Americans.''
   Mrs. Aquino has faced six coup attempts since she took office in
1986 after a ``People power'' revolt that ousted longtime dictator
Ferdinand Marcos.
   The DEA says the Philippines is a transshipment point for heroin
and a new form of methamphetamine called ``ice,'' and a main source
of marijuana.

<HEAD>Democrats Laud, Republicans Rap Defense Bill That Cuts SDI,
Stealth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats on the House Armed Services
Committee today hailed their $283 billion defense bill for
reflecting the ``new threat, the new challenges'' with deep budget
cuts in the Strategic Defense Initiative and a halt to the stealth
bomber program.
   ``I think it's a combination of the changes in the Soviet threat
and the changes in the budget deficit,'' Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.,
chairman of the panel, said of the bill that was approved by the
committee overwhelmingly, 40-12.
   Acknowledging the end of the Cold War, the legislation makes
wholesale reductions in several major strategic programs and for
the first time ever kills a major weapons system _ the B-2 bomber,
Aspin said.
   The committee realized that ``you've got to take something out
and one candidate with the lowest priority was the B-2,'' the
chairman told reporters at a news conference.
   The Air Force's chief of staff, Gen. Michael Dugan, predicted
that in the end Congress will not kill the B-2, saying in an
interview on Fox television today that ``thoughtful men and women
... will come to the conclusion that if you want peace, you have to
prepare for war.''
   But Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., said that the bill ``very
much fits the new threat, the new challenges.''
   Some Republicans gave the legislation low marks on Tuesday.
   ``It stinks,'' said Rep. William Dickinson of Alabama, ranking
Republican on the committee. ``I voted against it and I will
strongly urge the president to veto it.''
   The legislation, which the full House will consider in early
September, slashes $24 billion from Bush's proposal of $307 billion
in military spending for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. It also
marks a drop from this year's $305 billion defense.
   The Senate is expected to take up its $289 billion version of
the defense bill later this week.
   Among major provisions of the House bill is an end to the
radar-evading, B-2 stealth bomber at the 15 planes currently in
development, a cut of $2.9 billion for the Strategic Defense
Initiative, elimination of all money for two land-based nuclear
missile systems and a cut of 129,500 military personnel.
   President Bush had called for two stealth aircraft in fiscal
1991, $4.7 billion for SDI, commonly known as Star Wars; more than
$2 billion for the MX and Midgetman missiles and a troop reduction
of 38,000.
   While chopping money from strategic programs, the panel rejected
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's second attempt in two years to kill
the V-22 Osprey, a tilt-rotor aircraft that has widespread support
in Congress.
   The Armed Services Committee added $403 million for the Marine
Corps' hybrid plane, which is manufactured in Texas and
Pennsylvania.
   ``If you like to smell the pork, you'd love this bill,''
Dickinson quipped.
   Although support for the B-2 bomber remains in the Senate, the
panel dealt a serious blow to Bush's plan to build a 75-plane
fleet. At nearly $865 million apiece, the aircraft are the
costliest planes ever built.
   On Monday, the panel's procurement subcommittee eliminated funds
for the bomber in the new fiscal year, thus cutting off purchases
after the first 15. The full committee voted 34-20 Tuesday to
reject an amendment by Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., to reverse the
subcommittee's action.
   ``People were surprised the Berlin Wall fell down,'' said Rep.
John Kasich, R-Ohio, co-sponsor of legislation to cancel the B-2
program. ``It's surprising the Armed Services panel killed a major
weapons program.''
   Nine Republicans voted to terminate the stealth bomber, Kasich
said.
   Bush had sought $4.6 billion in the budget for two of the
bat-winged planes next year and advanced procurement of parts for
six more in the following year.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee, in its version of the
defense bill approved earlier this month, adopted the
administration's request.
   On another major strategic system, Bush had called for $2.1
billion for the multiple-warhead MX missile and for moving the
missiles from fixed underground silos to railroad cars. He also
sought $202 million in research money for the single-warhead
Midgetman.
   The House committee eliminated all that money and, instead,
created a $600 million pot for developing the next generation of
intercontinental missiles.
   The panel also called on Bush to report to the panel in 90 days
on which new missile the administration wants _ a mobile MX or the
new Midgetman _ and end the long-running debate over which project
to back.
   The committee also approved:
   _One of two Seawolf attack submarines Bush had sought; five

   _A ban on spending any money to move the 401st Tactical Fighter

   The provision touched off a lengthy debate in the committee,
with Republicans criticizing the amendment as detrimental to the

<TEXT>
   Radio Free Europe began
broadcasting directly from Prague on Wednesday after 40 years of
transmitting news to Czechoslovakia from abroad.
   ``For the first time in history, RFE is broadcasting directly
from within a country about that country instead of from abroad,''
said Pavel Pechacek, director of Czechoslovak broadcasting for
Radio Free Europe.
   For 40 years, RFE broadcasts were jammed in Czechoslovakia and
the rest of Eastern Europe to prevent the flow of uncensored
information about the Soviet bloc and news from the West.
   ``The fact that we are now able to transmit over Czechoslovak
radio is really the best proof of the progress and development
which has taken place in this country in the short period of eight
months,'' Pechacek said.
   He was referring to the period following the peaceful revolution
last fall that toppled the Communist regime in Czechoslovakia.

   More than 3,000 people joined the
president and prime minister Wednesday in a wreath-laying ceremony
commemorating the outbreak of the Warsaw uprising against the Nazis
in World War II.
   President Wojciech Jaruzelski and Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki laid a wreath of red and white carnations at the Tomb of
the Unknown Soldier to honor the 63-day struggle of the underground
Home Army to free Poland's capital from German occupation.
   More than 20,000 Home Army soldiers and about 225,000 civilians
were killed in the uprising before the insurgents surrendered.
   The leaders of the uprising hoped for assistance from the Soviet
Army, which was approaching Warsaw from the east during the summer
of 1944. But the Soviets stopped at the eastern bank of the Vistula
River, within sight of Warsaw, until January 1945.
   Warsaw residents commemorate the insurgents each August by
laying flowers and wreaths and lighting candles at monuments and
graves around the city.

   The government Wednesday accused Libya
and Sudan of assembling an army of dissidents and mercenaries to
launch a ``total war'' against Chad.
   Neither Libya nor Sudan issued any immediate response to the
allegations.
   A large-scale offensive would be mounted from the Sudanese
province of Darfur, according to an official communique drafted at
an emergency meeting of the Cabinet and the ruling party's top
leaders.
   The invasion force consists of ``hundreds and hundreds of
mercenaries'' recruited from Sudan, Mali and Mauritania, as well as
Chadian rebels, the communique alleged. It said the attackers would
be backed by Soviet- and Brazilian-made armored vehicles driven or
airlifted from Libya.
   The communique accused Libya of trying to torpedo talks aimed at
resolving longstanding differences between the neighboring
countries.
   Libya and Chad have been feuding since 1973 over a section of
territory along their border called the Aouzou Strip. In 1984,
Libyan troops and Chadian rebels took control of much of northern
Chad. They were defeated by government forces in 1987.
   A one-year accord proposing efforts to find a peaceful
settlement expires Aug. 31, and delegations from the two countries
are to meet in Algeria in two weeks for what has been described as
``last chance'' negotiations.
   By issuing the communique, Chadian officials appeared to be
suggesting they had little hope for a negotiated settlement.
   Sudan's military government has acknowledged that fighting
between Chadian government forces and rebels in Darfur has spread
into Sudanese territory.

   The almost 12 million residents of Tokyo were urged Wednesday to

   Tadao Sahoda, a spokesman for the Tokyo Waterworks Bureau, said
water pressure would be cut by up to 10 percent at night starting

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his main
political rival, Boris N. Yeltsin, have formed a joint committee to
revamp the Soviet economy, in a sign that Gorbachev is willing to
move faster toward market reforms.
   The 12-member committee, which held its first meeting Wednesday,
brought together moderate reformers loyal to Gorbachev and more
radical reformers supporting Yeltsin, the president of the huge
Russian republic who recently quit Gorbachev's Communist Party.
   A Western diplomat termed the move ``rather important'' because
the national government was in danger of falling far behind
economic changes introduced in Russia, the largest of the Soviet
Union's 15 republics.
   ``If they don't do something like this, they are going to be
left behind,'' the diplomat said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``Russia is going to move ahead fast.''
   More rapid reform of the Soviet economy also could increase the
chances for obtaining Western aid, which Gorbachev says is
necessary to reform the economy.
   Gorbachev's top economic adviser, Nikolai Y. Petrakov, said in
an interview that the decision to form the committee was ``the most
important information of 1990'' in Soviet domestic politics. He
said Gorbachev and Yeltsin signed the agreement Saturday after
several days of talks.
   The economists appointed to it will develop a common economic
policy for the nation. Petrakov said it was too early to say what
they might recommend, but their work should be done by Sept. 1,
when the national and Russian parliaments reconvene. Economic
reforms will be of top priority at the sessions.
   The committee includes such proponents of reform as Petrakov,
Deputy Premier Leonid A. Abalkin, Presidential Council member
Stanislav Shatalin, economist and writer Nikolai Shmelev, Yeltsin
deputy Grigory Yavlinsky and Russian Finance Minister Boris
Fyodorov.
   The Interfax news service identifed Yavlinsky as the author of
Yeltsin's ``500 Days'' economic program to move Russia to a market
economy.
   Over Gorbachev's objections, Yeltsin was elected in May to head
Russia, which contains three-fourths of the Soviet Union's land and
more than half its people. Since then, he has slowly outlined plans
to overhaul the republic's economy.
   He has shown tolerance toward private property and in recent
weeks indicated he intends to radically reform land ownership and
seize control of banking. That brought a sharp response from
Gorbachev, who on Sunday urged Soviet republics not to try to break
away from the central money and banking system.
   Gorbachev and his premier, Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, have moved more
slowly on the economy and are facing sharp criticism for its
failures. Yeltsin and other reformers have urged Ryzhkov to resign.
Yeltsin also quit the Communist Party last month, starting an
exodus of leading reformers.
   The independent Postfactum news service reported that Gorbachev
and Yeltsin froze Ryzhkov out of their agreement and that the
premier refused to sign it for several days.
   A January-June economic report released Sunday indicated the
Soviet economy continued to deteriorate in the first half of the
year. The gross national product _ the value of retail prices of
all goods and services produced _ dropped 1 percent. Labor
productivity dropped 1.5 percent.
   The Postfactum news service reported that the committee will not
recommend immediate price increases, which is something Ryzhkov
recommended.
   Under his proposal, bread prices would have increased in stages
beginning July 1, but the national parliament rejected the idea. It
told the government to return with a better plan in the fall.
   Yeltsin also opposed the plan, saying it would hit Soviet
consumers too hard.
   A top Russian republic official, deputy parliamentary chairman
Boris Isayev, told a briefing Tuesday that a special parliamentary
session of the Russian republic would be called in late October to
reform farm policy.
   The government intends to submit measures that would allow
farmers to own land for life, to inherit it, and buy and sell it,
Tass quoted Isayev as saying.

<DATELINE>BAGUIO, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirteen bodies were recovered
Wednesday from the rubble of a hotel that collapsed in an
earthquake July 16, and a doctor said one of the victims may have
lived a week before dying in the debris.
   More than 40 people, including 30 guests, remain unaccounted for
at the Hyatt Terraces Hotel, one of nearly 30 buildings that
collapsed in Baguio during the earthquake.
   The quake killed more than 1,600 people throughout Luzon island
and left more than 110,000 homeless. About 1,000 people remain
missing. The U.S. Embassy said 12 of those missing at the Hyatt are
Americans of Filipino origin.
   Gus Baloy, a hotel employee, said the 13 bodies were recovered
during a seven-hour period beginning Wednesday morning. All were
employees of the hotel, he said.
   A doctor who spoke on condition of anonymity said that based on
an examination of the body, it appeared one of the victims may have
lived for a week after the earthquake. He said the body, that of a
woman, bore no life-threatening injuries.
   Hopes of finding more survivors were raised after Pedrito Dy,
27, a hotel cook and part-time gym instructor, was rescued Monday
from the ruins of the Hyatt. Dy survived 14 days under the rubble
by drinking rainwater and his own urine.
   Two other hotel employees _ a man and a woman _ were rescued
Friday after being trapped for 11 days. All three are recovering in
hospitals.
   Foreign rescue teams in Baguio abandoned the search for
survivors more than a week ago, but Filipino rescuers, mostly
miners, have continued.
   ``As long as those people trapped inside believe and have faith
in God, they will survive,'' said miner Pablo Binwag. ``The search
will continue.''
   Baguio, a mountain resort, was one of the cities hit hardest by
the quake, which registered 7.7 on the Richter scale.
   Jose de Jesus, the government official in charge of relief and
rescue in Baguio, said there were still 1,500 families living in
evacuation centers in the city. He said emergency measures were
needed to help them recover.
   With tourism in the resort at a ``zero level,'' de Jesus said
business will stop and many people will become jobless.
   ``This is something that we need to address immediately,'' he
said. ``We need to have some kind of emergency employment for these
people in Baguio.''

<HEAD>Press Freedom Law Takes Effect in Soviet Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first press freedom law went into effect in
the Soviet Union Wednesday, guaranteeing broad rights for
journalists and potential publishers.
   The law, unanimously approved by the Supreme Soviet legislature
in June after months of debate, promises: ``The press and other
mass media are free,'' and ``censorship of the mass media is
forbidden.''
   Censorship by the Communist Party, the government and a special
censorship agency kept the Soviet news media under tight control
before President Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in 1985.
   Political pressure on the media began to lighten under
Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, but until now they
still lacked legal protection from interference.
   Technically, freedom of the press was guaranteed by a
declaration in the Soviet Constitution, but the new law is the
first to spell out detailed guarantees of press freedoms.
   Soviet journalists' new freedoms include the right to attend
meetings and be present at the scene of disasters, the right to
refuse to prepare reports that are against a journalist's
convictions and the right to hold interviews with officials. They
now can withdraw their byline if the contents of a story are
distorted by editing.
   To establish a new publication or news organization, the new law
says Soviets need only provide their name, address, frequency of
publication, circulation figures and source of financing.
   All publications will be permitted except those calling for the
violent overthrow of the government, promoting racial or religious
intolerance, or publishing propaganda for war, violence or cruelty.
   But a bigger barrier is the shortage of newsprint and its
increasing costs. Distribution of paper and printing plants will
remain part of the state economy.
   ``The law goes into effect at a time when there is an acute
shortage of newsprint and printing services,'' Tass reported
Wednesday.
   ``Just when subscriptions are to be received, the U.S.S.R.
Ministry of Communications announced the establishment of higher
tariffs for the delivery of printing matter to subscribers. As a
result, the price of most newspapers and magazines will at least
double, wiping out many publications.''

   The Register-Guard, Eugene, Ore., on the income gap:
   Resentment of the rich is a recurrent theme of American
politics. It has fueled populist sentiment that rises angrily and
then lies dormant for a while.
   A new wave of such feeling may be sweeping toward the electoral
beach today. The reason is that during the 1980s in the United
States, the rich got considerably richer, the poor got poorer, and
the majority in the middle treaded water.
   A report confirming that common impression was issued ... by the
Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, based on data released by
the Congressional Budget Office. ...
   (T)he center concluded, ``the combined incomes of the richest
2.5 million Americans now nearly equal the combined incomes of the
100 million Americans with the lowest incomes.''
   These developments have powerful implications for public policy
and politics. The clearest example of the former is the capital
gains tax cut advocated by the Bush administration.
   The center says the data show clearly that the rich gained the
most from the tax cuts approved during the Reagan years. And it
calculates that 94 percent of the benefit from the proposed capital
gains tax cut would go to the richest 20 percent of Americans,
making the gap between the rich and the not-rich wider than ever.
...
   (T)he facts of national income disparity cannot be glossed. They
represent a disturbing problem that needs to be addressed by all
parties and factions, not disguised or ignored.

   Philadelphia Daily News, on military spending:
   It's hard not to laugh at the Pentagon's idiocy.
   Consider the $999.20 pair of pliers Pratt and Whitney managed to
foist on the blue-suited dopes of the Air Force. Paying almost a
grand for a pair of pliers, after all, is something Curly, Larry
and Moe might do with their inheritance. When Pratt and Whitney
explains, ``They're multipurpose; not only do they put the clips on
but they take them off,'' it goes somewhere Pee-Wee Herman's
imagination could not follow.
   It's funny, that is, until you realize who's been had, until you
realize that Pratt and Whitney set the price just 80 cents under
the $1,000 limit that would have required the Air Force to buy the
damn thing from the people who actually made it, instead of a
greedy middleman. Take away that big score motive, and the Air
Force might have shlepped down to Sears and bought it for $2.49 and
gotten a lifetime warranty to boot.
   You paid the difference. Funny, huh?

   The Parkersburg (W.Va.) News on the congressional mailing
privileges:
   One of the worst abuses of office regularly perpetrated on
Capitol Hill is the use of taxpayer-supported ``free''
congressional mailing privileges to send de facto campaign
brochures to constituents. Among the worst offenders are freshman
members of the House, who use the franking privilege to put their
names (and usually their pictures) before the voters. This helps
them build name recognition, which is crucial to any election
effort, but is especially important to those seeking reelection.
   An informal study by The Washington Post found that members of
the House are urging some inventive ways to get around the few
restrictions on franked mail. Members are limited to three
mass-mailed newsletters, but there is no limit on the number of
notices for meetings that may be sent out, nor is there any limit
on mailings of less than 500 pieces.
   Well (surprise, surprise), freshman House members (and many of
their more senior brethren as well) have found an easy way around
that one. Hold lots of meetings. Meetings that just happen to take
place during the six months prior to elections. And, by all means,
don't rely on the local media to publicize these purely
nonpolitical meetings with constituents. No siree. Better tell them
about it by postcard.
   Several times.
   ``At a cost of about 13 cents per piece of bulk mail, each
mass-mailed town meeting notice newsletter to 225,000 households in
an average congressional district would cost the taxpayers
$29,250,'' the Post notes.
   No wonder the House has a 98 percent reelection rate. When an
incumbent sends out three or four mass mailings a year, he is
taking a de facto $100,000-plus campaign contribution straight from
taxpayers, many of whom would not give him a dime if openly
solicited. It is difficult, if not impossible, for any challenger
to overcome the bottomless and unprincipled pockets of incumbents
who abuse their mailing privileges.

   Long Beach (Calif.) Press Telegram on the Louisiana abortion law
veto:
   Anti-abortionists in Louisiana are helping to shape the future
of international family planning more directly than you might ever
imagine. In France, the maker of the abortion pill RU-486 admits
that drug's distribution has been slowed by fears of American
opinion. The result is that RU-486, which has the promise of saving
hundreds of thousands of women's lives each year, has been kept
away from countries desperate to have it.
   In Louisiana, Gov. Buddy Roemer ... vetoed two excessively
restrictive anti-abortion bills passed by the state Legislature
this year. The first, long since gone, permitted abortion only to
save the mother's life. The second expanded abortion to victims of
incest and aggravated rape, as long as the crime was reported to
police and medical attention was sought within seven days. Such
cruel and unusual conditions prompted Roemer's second veto.
   In such a process, an erroneous message is sent around the world
_ that most Americans are rabidly opposed to abortion. Indeed the
German conglomerate that owns the French pharmaceutical firm that
makes RU-486 is so afraid of an American boycott that it has
relegated international control of RU-486 to the World Health
Organization. ...
   The feeble sensitivities of European industrialists no doubt
give pleasure to many anti-abortionists. Yet when 200,000 women
worldwide die for lack of a reliable, low-cost, low-risk abortion
procedure, the efforts to make RU-486 unavailable are in themselves
inhumane.

   President Bush promised today to turn up the
political heat on Democrats unless they produce a deficit-reduction
plan by the end of the week, Republican lawmakers said.
   However, the White House said Bush was not imposing any
deadlines and expected that budget talks would intensify in
September when Congress returns from its summer recess.
   Congressional Democrats gave no indication they were ready to
offer a budget proposal.
   Noting that Republicans have been hit with tough criticism for
their package, House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta said,
``We didn't pledge that every time the Republicans slit their
wrists that we would slit ours.''
   The Republican plan calls for increasing taxes on alcohol and
limiting tax deductions on state and local taxes.
   Bush discusssed the budget impasse over coffee and donuts this
morning with about 150 Republican members of the House and Senate.
   Bush vowed to veto spending bills and force Congress to live
with a sequester, or deep automatic cuts, if the lawmakers fail to
come to terms on a plan to slash $500 billion from the deficit over
the next five years, GOP leaders said.
   GOP lawmakers left the session declaring that Bush was getting
ready to go on the offensive unless the Democrats offer their own
version of a deficit-reduction plan within 48 hours.
   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich said, ``The first phase of
the summit has collapsed.''
   Indeed, it appeared unlikely that serious bargaining would
happen before September, when the vacationing Bush and Congress
both return to Washington.
   Gingrich said Bush indicated he was willing to stay in
Washington to get a budget agreement, even though he is under
pressure from his wife to join her at their Kennebunkport retreat.
   Gingrich quoted Bush as saying, ``You know, Barbara's up at
Kennebunkport with two dogs, one of them sick, and with six
grandkids and she needs me.''
   White House deputy press secretary Roman Popadiuk said Bush, in
his meeting with Republicans, said, ``We have been dealing with the
Democrats in good faith and we have a plan we are prepared to share
with them when they present theirs. They have not yet done so.''
   In contrast with GOP lawmakers' predictions that Bush would get
tough with the Democrats, Popadiuk said merely that it was
``obvious that we are frustrated by this process, that there's very
little progress and, of course the American people (can) judge for
themselves on this issue.
   ``I can expect the president to speak out but in what degree or
in what shape, form or manner, I do not know,'' Popadiuk said.
   Lawmakers said Bush told them he wants a budget plan from
Democrats by Friday.
   If that doesn't happen, said House Republican Whip Newt
Gingrich, ``I think he may start getting tough in August. ... I
think the White House has been far more patient than I would be.''
   White House deputy press secretary Alixe Glen said, ``You can
assume that when the GOP lawmakers go home they won't be shy about
the foot-dragging we've seen by the Democrats about finding a
credible solution to the budget deficit.''
   ``We're not going anyplace until (the Democrats) get some
numbers on the table,'' said House Minority Leader Bob Michel of
Illinois. Bush is ``certainly not going to keep his trap shut all
during August.''
   ``I think that the first phase of the summit has collapsed,''
said Gingrich.
   Congressional Democrats, while not flatly ruling out that they
would present a budget proposal before the August recess, gave no
indication they would do so. Instead, they said the goal now was to
work out a schedule with the administration for reaching a
deficit-reduction pact in September.
   ``Getting involved in partisan recriminations isn't going to
help that process,'' said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.
   Bush and the Republicans held out hopes of reviving the budget
negotiations in early September after Congress returns from its
summer vacation.
   But unless the Democrats put a plan on the table by Friday,
there will be no agreement before Congress takes its recess next
week, they said.
   ``The president said he hoped the Democrats would submit a plan
by Friday,'' said Gingrich. But if they don't, then ``obviously any
agreement to not talk in public has no meaning,'' he said.
   ``He hopes to bring everybody back in early September and have
serious negotiations,'' said Gingrich. But ``he'll veto spending
bills across the board if they're above his spending request. He
will sustain a sequester until Congress passes a five-year
agreement and not let the Congress get out of sequester.''
   The White House previously has estimated that without a budget
agreement, the Gramm-Rudman law could inflict automatic cuts of
$100 billion or more on many federal programs in October.
   About 150 of the 176 House Republicans and 45 GOP senators
attended the strategy session with Bush over coffee at the White
House, participants said.
   Michel said, ``He's a very kind, gentle individual, but,
brother, he's got fire in his belly over ... the summit
negotiations, where we're getting nowhere and he takes all the
brunt of the criticism.''
   Republicans have been furious with Democrats for not offering a
deficit-reduction plan at the 12-week-old budget talks. The
bargaining is aimed at shrinking a budget shortfall expected to
reach $169 billion next year, not including the $100 billion cost
of rescuing failed savings and loans.
   Details of a Bush administration plan surfaced last week
containing $54 billion in spending cuts and new taxes for fiscal
1991, which starts Oct. 1. It included higher alcohol levies and a
limit to the deductibility of state and local income taxes,
proposals that drew widespread criticism, including from the GOP.
   Some Republicans criticized White House chief of staff John
Sununu and White House budget chief Richard Darman last week for
not keeping them informed about the administration's ideas about
cutting the deficit.
   Democrats have not even tried to put their own budget plan
together in recent private meetings among themselves, according to
participants. Instead, they and administration officials are trying
to hammer out a schedule for completing a pact when lawmakers
return to the capital in September.
   Budget talks will continue intermittently during the August
break, Democrats have said.

   The Asbury Park Press, Neptune, N.J., on David Souter:
   Reporters, lobbyists and the staff of the Senate Judiciary
Committee are furiously combing through musty files while David
Hackett Souter, a 50-year-old bachelor who lives on his family's
New Hampshire farm, meets informally with Republican senators on
the committee.
   Souter is being touted as a wise choice to become as associate
justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, primarily because he has not
left an easily discernible paper trail on the controversial issues
_ chiefly abortion rights _ the high court must confront.
   No one can predict what ... Souter would do in all instances as
a justice. Senators and presidents know that members of the high
court often take surprising turns of thought after they are
confirmed for life.
   But the senators should attempt to discover what kind of jurist
Souter is. Let's hope the confirmation hearings are probing and
thoughtful.

   The Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin on Barney Frank:
   The House Ethics Committee has voted to reprimand Rep. Barney
Frank, D- Mass., for his dealings with a prostitute named Stephen
Gobie. This strikes us as the appropriate punishment for ... Frank.
...
   The fact that ... Frank's relationship with ... Gobie was a
private matter and did not involve his duties as a member of
Congress, suggests to us that a reprimand is sufficient discipline
under the circumstances. ...
   Frank's political future now rests where it belongs: With his
constituents. The voters of the Fourth Congressional District of
Massachusetts know all they need to know about the Gobie affair,
and may cast their ballots accordingly.
   In our view, it is not the proper function of the House to judge
members on their personal lives _ unless, of course, those personal
lives interfere with public responsibilities. ... Frank's
transgressions were not criminal ... nor did they involve his
duties as a congressman.

   Grand Forks (N.D.) Herald on the federal farm bill:
   Farm country politicians have been wringing their hands all week
about the fate of the farm bill. What if the president were to veto
it?
   A farm bill veto would not be such a bad thing. Certainly it is
better than five more years of confused and haphazard farm policy.
Certainly it is better than international confrontation about
agricultural trade. And certainly it is better than more
bellyaching about the high cost of farm programs.
   A presidential veto only means that the current farm bill would
be extended for a year. Congress could use that extension to begin
a realistic overhaul of farm programs.

   Chicago Tribune on children's TV:
   Last week the House of Representatives voted to protect children
from the dangerous effects of unwholesome television. No, it didn't
outlaw live coverage of the House of Representatives, part of what
Mark Twain once called the only distinctly native American criminal
class. Instead it placed new burdens on broadcasters, who are
accused of neglecting the interests of children.
   The House, which would never presume to tell Dr. Seuss what to
write, nevertheless feels perfectly justified in trying to dictate
what children's TV programmers should offer. Members have detected
the smell of commerce and their nostrils are offended.
   Their remedy is a limit of 10{ minutes of commercials per half
hour on weekends and 12 minutes on weekdays, and a new requirement
that the Federal Communications Commission consider the amount and
type of kids' programs when it rules on the renewal of
broadcasters' licenses. ...
   President Reagan killed a similar bill shortly before leaving
office. If the latest version gets through the Senate, President
Bush should do the same. ...
   If there is a problem, it lies well within the authority of
parents. Those who prefer more elevating fare than ``Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles'' can direct their kids to plenty of options:
watching ``Sesame Street'' and ``Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,''
picking up a Disney feature at the video store or curling up with a
good book. They don't need the interference of Congress.

   When dentist Lance Lindenmuth doesn't have
his hand in someone's mouth, he thinks it's fun to be thrown from
the back of a 2,000-pound bucking bull, or from a mechanical bull
in his backyard.
   He also skydives.
   ``I'm the type of person that sees a lot of action in life,''
said Lindenmuth, 29.
   ``If you haven't experienced life, if you haven't gotten into it
and done some things, you really haven't lived,'' he said.
   He took up bullriding a few months ago just for the thrill of it.
   He's ridden 11 bulls so far, and has yet to stay on the required
eight seconds.
   ``I've heard it takes 50 bulls before you get the hang of it.''
   He's competing against guys who started riding calves when they
were 6, but Lindenmuth is ready for the challenge.
   ``I figure I'm very capable physically, and mentally I'm very
tough. It takes a desire, and if you have a desire you can
accomplish what you want in life.''
   Dentistry will remain his vocation and rodeo a committed
sideline.
   ``It's intense and it's physical and it's very fun,'' Lindenmuth
said.

   Dozens of supporters and a handful of protesters
greeted patrons arriving today for the opening of an exhibit of
Robert Mapplethorpe photographs that incensed Sen. Jesse Helms and
got a museum director arrested in Cincinnati.
   The crowd of about 150 people, largely made up of those
supporting the show, was orderly, and no incidents were reported.
   An estimated 200 visitors were lined up outside less than an
hour after the museum opened its doors, said Denise Spencer, a
marketing assistant at the Institute for Contemporary Art, which is
showing the exhibit. The small museum is allowing just 75 people at
a time to view the exhibit.
   ``These people are trying to force their morality on the rest of
us,'' said Jim Edgerley, of the conservative American Freedom
Coalition, as he stood among a crowd of demonstrators, patrons,
police and reporters on the museum steps.
   As Edgerley spoke, two men stood in front of him locked in a
deep, passionate kiss. ``See, this is the kind of behavior this is
promoting,'' Edgerley said.
   Others praised the show.
   ``I'd read a lot about it and I was curious. I went to see what
was objectionable, but I didn't find it objectionable. I thought it
was interesting,'' said 70-year-old Eleanor Bleakie.
   Meanwhile, a public television station that had broadcast the
most sexually explicit, homoerotic photographs from the so-called
``X Portfolio'' on its newscast Tuesday night said this morning
that it got about 100 calls in reaction to the newscast, most of
them supportive. But several people said they were swearing off
public television forever, a station official said.
   Producers of WGBH's 10 p.m. newscast said they aired the ``X
Portfolio'' pictures Tuesday to let viewers decide for themselves
how they feel about them.
   ``The coverage thus far never shows you this. All you get is
what is in the mind of the writer. And we want our coverage to let
the viewer decide, with both sides presented,'' said John
VanScoyoc, the station's managing editor.
   The photos have stirred a national debate over federal funding
of work deemed offensive. The station, which like other public TV
outlets receives federal funding, devoted 24 minutes of the
half-hour newscast to the exhibit and the outcry over its explicit
homosexual and sadomasochistic images.
   Despite efforts by protesters to have the photos banned, support
for the show has been strong in Boston, once known as a city of
bluenoses for banning books and movies.
   A Mapplethorpe supporter was arrested Tuesday after disrupting
the news conference of a coalition opposed to the showing. Artists
and playwrights gave speeches in support of the exhibit, and
marches and rallies were planned for today.
   First Amendment Common Sense, a coalition opposed to the
exhibit, pressed public officials to halt it as obscene.
   ``We're calling for a revival of common sense,'' said an
opponent, Evelyn Dubel. ``We're concerned about the well-being of
our neighbors, especially our children.''
   David Ross, director of the art institute, said he was proud to
have the show of 124 photographs taken by Mapplethorpe from 1969
until shortly before he died of AIDS last year in Boston at age 42.
   ``What we have to fear is the suppression of these ideas. We're
talking about art,'' Ross said. ``This is not a pornography
exhibit. ... This show is a celebration of beauty.''
   Alan Foster, WGBH news director, said the station received at
least 63 calls within 15 minutes of the program's conclusion. The
line was attached to an answering machine, and it was not
immediately known how callers felt, he said.
   Twenty callers dialed the newsroom directly. ``Those have been
universally positive,'' Foster said. ``One guy said, `Brilliant
show, terrific journalism.'''
   Mary Catherine Kilday, enforcement chief of the Federal
Communications Commission in Washington, said the agency does not
monitor TV or radio programming and has no authority to enforce
indecency complaints after 8 p.m.
   A Mapplethorpe exhibit scheduled in June 1989 at the Corcoran
Gallery of Art in Washington was canceled after Helms, the
arch-conservative Republican from North Carolina, branded the work
obscene.
   Helms' objections prompted Congress to limit National Endowment
for the Arts grants. Before those limits, the Mapplethorpe tour had
received about $30,000 from the NEA, about 10 percent of the cost.
   A showing in Cincinnati led to obscenity charges against the
director of The Contemporary Arts Center, but a federal judge
barred police from confiscating photos from the exhibit.
   The show in Boston was expected to draw at least 50,000 people.
It runs through Oct. 4.

   NRC Handelsblad, Rotterdam, Netherlands, on David Souter:
   The nine judges of the American Supreme Court are the final
guardians of morals, habits and the spirit of the time of the
American nation. Every time when one of them drops out due to old
age, illness or death, a president will grab his chance to extend
his political signature with an appointment. ...
   What would (President) Bush do? Nervousness about this was big
because on the one hand the candidacy of a judge is sort of a
president's confession of faith towards the ideologically tinted
part of the supporters. On the other hand, the relations aren't
such that one could become a lot wiser on this terrain of
polarisation. ...
   From a moral point of view the nation finds itself in a foggy
zone. The pre-eminent litmus test is the abortion issue. ...
   With the departure of a (Supreme Court justice) ... and the
inevitable discussion about a new candidate the embarrassment about
this litmus test was threatening to escalate. Therefore the fearful
question that many had: What would Bush do?
   The ... president has done something genial, at least that is
what it looks like now. With the candidacy of (David) Souter he has
pushed forward a judge who is generally known as very capable and
possessing great integrity and who, after 20 years of legal
practice, has not left a trace from which something could be
deducted. The bachelor from New Hampshire has no political or
ideological past and that, for the time being, contents all
parties. ...
   But up to now the choice of Souter is a find. His knowledge is
not doubted and the power of his nomination lies in the continuous
question: Who is Souter?

   The seizure of the prime minister and other members of the

black Moslem radicals underlines the chronic vulnerability of very
small states to extremist movements. Small communities are easily
ignited by strange sparks. ...
   The calm response of the Trinidadian military, political and
religious establishments to the militants' blackmail is a tribute
to the maturity of the country's democratic institutions. ...
   The unpopularity of the government led by Arthur Robinson, only
30 months after winning a landslide victory with the promise of
rescuing the country's tottering economy, is such that the rebels'
demand for his resignation and for elections within 90 days may be
so widely supported as to be irresistible. ...
   The economic woes would have been more readily borne had the
government kept an important part of its bargain with the
electorate: the promise to eliminate Trinidad's endemic corruption

   Bangkok (Thailand) Post on aid to terrorism given by the former
Eastern European governments:
   Hollywood, novelists and even the right-wing propagandists, it
turns out, were right all along. For the past 40 years, the Soviets
and their satellite states in Eastern Europe aided terrorism,
hatched outlandish plots to expand power, and routinely pitted
families and neighbors against each other to maintain secret police
files.
   Since the fall of the communist dictatorships in Europe last
year, files have been uncovered with tales of intrigue so
outlandish and devious a fiction writer would have been hard
pressed to imagine them.
   The new regime in Czechoslovakia has discovered its communist
predecessor was the world's major illegal supplier of the most
powerful and difficult-to-detect explosive, Semtex. In effect, the
former Czech leaders helped blow up several planes in terrorist
attacks which killed hundreds.
   Hungary, Czechoslovakia and East Germany not only provided a
safe haven for the infamous Carlos, but showered the notorious
terrorist with luxuries, including call girls. ...
   What next? Will details emerge from Bulgaria providing the
long-suspected assassination attempts on the Pope? Will proof come
from Romania that Nicolae Ceausescu and his clique did indeed help
narcotics dealing by North Korean diplomats? ...
   The supreme power of the former dictatorships of Eastern Europe
proved irresistible to the men who held it. Whether the power
warped the men or vice versa hardly matters. As story after story
from Eastern Europe proves, total power corrupts totally.
   Convinced by their own constant propaganda of the infallibility
of the ``dictator of the proletariat,'' the old men who ran Eastern
Europe for so long proved as politically perverted by power as any
Latin American tinhorn despot.

   El Mercurio, Santiago, Chile, on Cubans seeking asylum at
embassies in Havana:
   The stubborness with which Fidel Castro rows against the current
of ``perestroika'' is worsening living conditions in Cuba and
encourages people to seek political asylum to leave their country.
   It is useless for Castro to insult the asylum-seekers, calling
them ``bums with fat criminal records,'' because, as the tyrant
gets more annoyed, the population shows a greater desire of
emigrating. ...
   The first seven asylum seekers picked the Czechoslovak embassy,
creating for Castro a serious problem with his former allies.
Others entered the Spanish embassy, and Foreign Minister Francisco
Hernandez Ordonez of Spain has said, ``There is a situation of
nervousness in Havana, resulting from the isolation of Cuba from
the international community, and from its extremely serious
economic situation.''

   The woman who brought a queen's comfort to the
bomb-shattered East End during World War II returned to the rebuilt
district Wednesday to celebrate her 90th birthday.
   Nearly 50 years after the German blitz, the presence of Queen
Elizabeth the Queen Mother rekindled warm memories of a bitter time.
   During the war years, the then-Queen Elizabeth picked her way
through the rubble in high heels and the pastel dresses she still
favors today, offering words of ecouragement to East Enders. They
still remember.
   ``She really did cheer us up. People were down in their depths
at the time,'' said Myrtle Lester, who as an 11-year-old spent long
hours in a damp backyard bomb shelter.
   The visit to the East End was a sentimental high point in four
months of parades and pageants leading up to the birthday on
Saturday of the ``Queen Mum,'' as she is fondly known.
   She arrived in the riverside district aboard the royal yacht
Britannia, wearing a light blue dress and matching hat with a wispy
veil, a string of pearls and a beaming smile.
   Elderly East Enders mingled with youngsters waving Union Jacks
who turned out to greet her. Alice Poyser, 69, said she remembered
well the wartime visits of the queen and King George VI.
   ``We were pleased to see her. It felt like a mother talking to
us,'' she said. Mrs. Poyser said her family was bombed out of three
successive homes.
   Several people in the crowd recalled the queen's words after
Buckingham Palace was hit by a bomb: ``I'm glad we've been bombed.
It makes me feel I can look the East End in the face.''
   During the war, Prime Minister Winston Churchill advised her to
go to Canada for safety. She ignored him, and took lessons at
Buckingham Palace on how to use a rifle.
   Her daughters _ Elizabeth, now the queen, and Princess Margaret
_ stayed at Windsor Castle, 21 miles west of London, during the
conflict.
   The East End's shattered docks and factories have been replaced
by a huge redevelopment project that has brought new homes, shops
and offices.
   The Queen Mother unveiled a plaque honoring 76 people killed by
a bomb and revisited the shelters underneath All Saints' Church,
itself a bombing casualty in 1945. She also saw some of those she
met during wartime.
   Wednesday night, she was to be guest of honor at a birthday
dinner on the Britannia given by the queen and Prince Philip,
followed by fireworks over the Tower of London.
   The Queen Mother was born Aug. 4, 1900. Lady Elizabeth Angela
Marguerite Bowes-Lyon was the ninth child of the Earl and Countess
of Strathmore, whose family home was Glamis Castle in Scotland.
   In 1923 she married the Duke of York, second of four surviving
sons of King George V.
   She became queen, quite unexpectedly, when the duke's elder
brother, Edward, abdicated in 1936 to marry American divorcee
Wallis Warfield Simpson.
   Biographers say the Queen Mother never recovered from her
husband's early death from lung cancer in 1952. She still refers to
him as ``the king'' and declines public appearances on the
anniversaries of his birth, marriage and death.
   Despite her age, the Queen Mother is still one of the most
active royals. Only the queen and Princess Anne make more public
appearances.

   Crew members abandoned a Greek cargo ship
battered off Cape Cod by Hurricane Bertha today. At least one
seaman died and six were unaccounted for as other merchant ships
rushed to help, the Coast Guard said.
   Eighteen crew members were rescued from a lifeboat and a life
raft after four or more hours in heavy seas. Three were in a
lifeboat and one was still in the water this morning, said Coast
Guard Coast Guard Lt. j.g. Rodney Gadsden.
   Soviet, Hong Kong and Norwegian fishing and merchant ships
joined efforts to pluck the sailors from 10- to 15-foot seas. An
Air Force communications plane was directing their efforts and a
Coast Guard ship was en route.
   The 593-foot Greek-registered freighter Corazon, with a crew of
29, lost part of its bow and its midsection buckled, said Coast
Guard Petty Officer Lionel Bryant. The ship was about 340 miles
east-southeast of Cape Cod, he said.
   Crew members abandoned ship at 4:20 a.m., Coast Guard Petty
Officer Anthony L. Whitehead said, and by midmorning the Corazon's
bow was submerged and its stern was standing clear of the water.
``You can see the screw,'' Whitehead said.
   One crew member apparently fell into the water as the crew
members boarded the lifeboat and life raft, Whitehead said. That
sailor was pulled from the water by the Russian trawler Vympel
shortly after 7 a.m. but was dead.
   At about 8 a.m., the Vympel attempted to rescue what had been
reported to be 12 sailors aboard the life raft. But the raft was
pulled into the trawler's screw and rudder area, and six or seven
sailors were pitched into the ocean, Coast Guard spokesmen said.
   The five remaining aboard the life raft were later pulled to
safety by the Russian merchant ship Leonid Leonidov, Gadsden said.
   Two more life rafts were put out, and three people were seen,
apparently in one of them, he said. Another was seen in the water
and a total of six were missing, Gadsden said. More precise
accounting was unavailable, he said.
   The Leonid Leonidov also took aboard the 13 crew members on the
lifeboat, rescuing them at 8:30 a.m., Whitehead said.
   The Hong Kong vessel, Nova Europa, was assisting, and the
Norwegian vessel, Hual Angelita, was standing by, Gadsden said.
   Of all the survivors rescued by 10:30 a.m., 17 were in good
condition and one was hurt, with unknown injuries, Whitehead said.
   At the height of the storm the ship was buffeted by 80 mph wind
and 20- to 25-foot seas, Bryant said.
   The Corazon was carrying cement from Greece to New York.

   Students at Marshall High School will
learn their geography this year, or else _ or else they might have
trouble finding their classroom.
   Each classroom has been transformed into a country, using paint
and decor reflecting the culture of the assigned country.
   And buildings at the school in southeastern Portland now
represent continents.
   ``I'm going to force the staff and kids to find their way round
geographically,'' principal Colin Karr-Morse said.
   Teachers will post daily news articles and other country facts.
Country flags and products will also be on display.
   Karr-Morse said the idea came after the results of a Gallup poll
released last year showed that U.S. residents between the ages of
18 and 24 could only identify seven of 16 countries on the globe.
People in the same age group from countries such as Mexico, Italy,
Canada, Japan and Sweden all scored higher.
   Gail Ludwig, geographer in residence at the National Geographic
Society, said she has never heard of another school using the
Marshall concept.

<TEXT>
   Zhelyu Zhelev, who led the democratic
opposition in June's free elections, became president today, the
first non-Communist to gain any leading post in the Balkan country
in more than 40 years.
   Zhelev's election by Parliament ended almost a month of
political stalemate following the resignation July 6 of President
Petar Mladenov, a member of the ruling former Communist party, now
known as the Socialists.
   Mladenov stepped down after it was confirmed he had called for
the use of tanks against anti-government demonstrators last
December.
   Zhelev, 55, was a compromise candidate backed by all parties _
including Socialist leaders _ after five unsuccessful attempts to
get a president elected by the 400-member parliament.
   Zhelev won 284 of the 389 votes cast today.
   In a surprise move, he immediately made a proposed former
Socialist Interior Minister Atanas Semerdzhiev as vice president.
Deputies greeted the suggestion with applause and voted
overwhelmingly for Semerdzhiev in a show of hands. Only two
deputies opposed the choice, while seven abstained.
   Semerdzhiev had resigned as Interior Minister last week when a
furor erupted over the proposed parliamentary appearance of Todor
Zhivkov, the Stalinist leader ousted last fall after 35 years in
power.
   Zhelev triumphed in the presidential race after none of the
three original candidates proved able to secure the two-thirds
majority needed to win election in Parliament.
   Although the Socialists won June's free elections with 211
parliamentary seats, their incumbent premier, Andrei Lukanov,
repeatedly has said he does not want to head a one-party government.
   Spreading street protests against the Socialists since the
elections also have made clear that the ruling party's support is
dwindling rapidly, necessitating some sort of cooperation with the
opposition Union of Democratic Forces.
   Zhelev led the UDF in the June elections, in which the 16-party
coalition won 144 parliamentary seats.
   Before today's vote, both Zhelev and Lukanov indicated that the
Socialists and opposition are willing to work together to ease
Bulgaria's social tensions and rapidly deepening economic crisis.
   Answering questions from the floor, Zhelev said he wants to see
Bulgaria make a ``peaceful evolution to democracy with the direct
participation of the political opposition.''
   While he did not directly retract previous opposition rejection
of participation in a Lukanov-led coalition government, he stressed
the most important task of any president is now to work for the
creation of ''a strong, active and competent government.''
   Observers in Sofia took the remark as a sign the opposition is
no longer excluding participation in government with the Socialists.
   For his part, Lukanov said his party had agreed to Zhelev's
candidacy as president in the interests of national welfare and
noted this marked the effective end to one-party monopoly of power
in Bulgaria.
   The Balkan nation was dominated by the Communists since just
after World War II, when the Communists executed, imprisoned and
repressed their political opponents.

   A major women's rights organization announced
Wednesday a drive to enlist 1 million young women on college and
high school campuses to fight restrictive state abortion laws,
particularly those requiring parental consent.
   The Feminist Majority's ``Becky Bell Campaign,'' named for a
17-year-old Indianapolis girl who died in 1988 from complications
suffered in a back-alley abortion, will be concentrated in Indiana,
Massachusetts, Minnesota, Ohio, California, Pennsylvania and Rhode
Island, sponsors said.
   The parents of the dead girl, Bill and Karen Bell, endorsed the
project in an emotional appearance at a news conference with
Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority.
   ``Our daughter died because she happened to live in the wrong
state ... she died because of a parental consent law that I had
never even heard of,'' said the father, a 47-year-old office
products salesman in Indianapolis.
   As the parents explained it, their daughter, who normally shared
her problems freely with them, was afraid to tell them about her
pregnancy for fear of disappointing them. And she heard from
friends that the Indiana courts rarely granted an exception to the
parental consent requirement, so, in desperation, she went to an
unqualified practitioner.
   ``When Becky died, I died with her,'' said Karen Bell. ``Becky
didn't want an abortion. But she wanted to save dad and I the shame
of knowing she had fallen in love, had sex and became pregnant.
This could happen to anybody. Kids are going to do these things....
Now all I have is the graveyard.''
   ``Don't you think we wanted to know Becky was in trouble, that
we wanted to help her?'' asked the father. ``But Becky confided to
her friends `I can't tell Mom and Dad _ I love them too much.' Our
hope is that in speaking out we can spare other families the
nightmare we now live. These laws are punitive. They are deadly.''
   The campaign will feature the distribution of memorial bracelets
carrying the names of Becky Bell or Rosie Jimenez, a 27-year-old
McAllen, Texas woman said by the Feminist Majority to be the first
to die as a consequence of the Hyde Amendment, named for Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., which bars Medicaid abortion funding for poor women.
Jimenez died Oct. 3, 1977, the same year the Hyde Amendment was
passed.
   Smeal, formerly head of the National Organization for Women,
said the campaign will move this fall into Oregon, Michigan and
Texas, where parental consent laws are pending. In all states, she
said, the drive will focus on voter registration and
get-out-the-vote projects in behalf of sympathetic state
legislators. It also will promote bringing the European abortion
pill, RU-486, to the United States.
   The Feminist Majority is not a membership organization but
currently has more than 50,000 contributors and more than 100,000
active supporters, according to press secretary Tamar Raphael.

<HEAD>So Far, 1990 An Average Year for Earthquakes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   So far, 1990 is just an average year for
earthquakes, the government said Wednesday, although the Iranian
quake in June was the deadliest in 14 years.
   The U.S. Geological Survey said the death toll in Iran,
estimated at 50,000 or more, is the highest since a 1976 quake in
China killed more than 250,000 people.
   Overall, there were 34 significant quakes in the first six
months of 1990. That would be close to normal, since there are, on
average, 60 significant quakes in a typical year, the agency said.
   A significant quake is defined as one reaching 6.5 or higher on
the Richter scale or a lesser temblor causing significant
casualties or damage.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released in an
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   Every increase of one whole number, say from 5.5 to 6.5,
indicates a tenfold increase in ground motion.
   The quake that struck Iran measured 7.7 on the scale, according
to Waverly Person, chief of the agency's National Earthquake
Information Service in Golden, Colo.
   That was the same magnitude as the deadly quake that hit the
Philippines on July 16. The death toll in that quake is still being
calculated.
   On Feb. 8, a quake measured at 6.6 injured at least 15 people in
the Philippines; 1 died there in a quake on March 26, and a tremor
on June 14 killed 4 people.
   Only one significant quake was recorded in the United States
from January through June, a magnitude 5.5 tremor that injured 38
people and caused $10 million in damage in Southern California on
Feb. 28.
   After Iran, the next deadliest quake in the first half of 1990
was a magnitude 6.4 tremor in Peru on May 30, which claimed 135
lives.
   On April 26, 126 people were killed in a quake in China that
measured 6.9 on the Richter scale.
   A tremor measured at 7.2 occurred May 20 in southern Sudan.
Because of the remoteness of the area, casualty figures have not
been confirmed. Survey officials said that is believed to be the
strongest quake ever recorded in that country.
   There were nine deaths reported in a May 30 quake in Romania.
Two people died in a May 5 quake in Italy.
   No injuries were reported, but buildings were damaged, when a
quake shook parts of southern England on April 2.
   Overall, Person estimated that there are probably several
million earthquakes annually, most so small they are unnoticed.

   Federal authorities are investigating
corruption and bribery at the U.S. Naval Academy, where a
contractor has admitted handing out more than $20,000 in illegal
gratuities.
   Carroll R. Dunton pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court on
Tuesday to charges that he gave bribes and illegal gratuities to a
Navy public works officer and an Annapolis Housing Authority
official.
   Dunton, 65, is a general contractor in Annapolis, where the
Naval Academy is located.
   He admitted giving $20,307 worth of gratutities, including cash
and household appliances, to James Weston, who was the Naval
Academy's public works officer from July 1985 until his retirement
in October 1989.
   In return, Dunton allegedly received $3.7 million in Navy
contracts.
   Weston, reached by telephone at his home in Nevada, declined to
comment on the allegation. He has not been charged.
   Dunton also pleaded guilty to one count of giving $13,351 worth
of plumbing work to Arthur Strissel Jr., who was the executive
director of the Annapolis Housing Authority.
   In return for the bribe to Strissel, Weston awarded Dunton's
company a $559,330 contract to install gas meters at Annapolis
housing projects, according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Jane F.
Barret.
   Dunton made a profit of $249,568 on the contract, which was
financed with U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
funds, prosecutors said.
   Strissel is serving a 10-year prison term on unrelated
racketeering and bribery convictions.
   Academy spokesman Noel Milan confirmed that the FBI and Naval
Investigative Services began an investigation in March 1989 into
procurement irregularities during Weston's tenure at the academy.
   ``The academy is cooperating fully in the probe,'' Milan said.
   Dunton, the owner of Dunton Contracting Inc., faces a maximum
sentence of 12 years in prison and $500,000 in fines if found
guilty.
   Sentencing was set for Oct. 26.

<TEXT>
   A small airliner carrying 30 people from Armenia
to the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh crashed in Azerbaijan
today, Soviet media reported. No casualty report was immediately
available.
   The accident occurred in an area blanketed by dense fog, but the
cause of the crash was not known.
   The wreckage of the Aeroflot Yakovlev-40 was found in the Agdam
region of Azerbaijan, just east of Nagorno-Karabakh and its
capital, Stepanakert, said the Interfax news agency, quoting a
report to the Armenian parliament.
   The area is not on the plane's route from the Armenian capital,
Yerevan, to Stepanakert, but it could have been circling to enter
its landing pattern.
   Air controllers lost contact with the plane this morning as it
entered airspace controlled by Stepanakert, Tass quoted the Soviet
state Committee for Air Safety as saying. Stepanakert is 120 miles
east of Yerevan.
   Armenia and Azerbaijan are locked in a bitter dispute over
Nagorno-Karabakh, a remote, mountainous area of Azerbaijan
populated largely by Armenians. Hundreds of people have died in
ethnic clashes in the past two years, and thousands of Armenians
have organized into armed paramilitary units.
   In this volatile atmosphere, accidental deaths have spawned
unfounded rumors of sabotage.
   For example, an explosion in a bus station in Azerbaijan caused
by leaking natural gas was reported widely as the result of a
terrorist bomb.
   The Armenian parliament formed a five-person commission to
investigate the catastrophe, Interfax said.
   The search for the plane was hampered by thick fog, the Civil
Aviation Ministry in Moscow told Tass. Civilian helicopters from
Azerbaijan were being used in the search, the news agency said.

<HEAD>Leading Economic Indicators Post No Change in June</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's main economic forecasting
gauge failed to budge in June, the Commerce Department said
Wednesday in a report analysts said portended a listless economy in
the months ahead.
   The department's Index of Leading Economic Indicators, designed
to forecast economic activity six to nine months in advance, was
unchanged for the second month this year. It had risen in March and
May and fallen in February and April.
   Many economists had expected a small increase in June. If the
index were to fall for three straight months, it could signal a
forthcoming recession.
   ``This meandering is consistent with what is happening in the
economy,'' said economist Darryl Delano of Cahners Economics in
Newton, Mass., ``It all nets out to basically nothing.''
   David Berson, chief economist with the Federal National Mortgage
Association, agreed.
   ``Basically, what we've seen over this year is small increases,
small decreases, with everything averaging around zero,'' Berson
said. ``The economy is going to continue in its slow-growth path.''
   But other analysts such as David Jones, an economist with the
New York securities dealer Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., expressed
deeper concern.
   ``What we have got is an economy that is slowly sinking into
possibly a mild recession by either late this year or early next,''
Jones contended.
   The Bush administration predicted earlier this month the
nation's economy would grow 2 percent this year.
   But the growth rate as measured by the gross national product
was just 1.7 percent in the first quarter and 1.2 percent in the
second, meaning the economy would have to expand at an annual rate
of 2.9 percent during the second half of the year to meet the
administration's prediction.
   Few economists expect that amount of growth.
   Indeed, the National Association of Purchasing Management
released its latest survey on Wednesday showing the manufacturing
economy slumped in July for the first time in three months.
   And the Commerce Department, in another report Wednesday, said
construction spending in June was flat after falling during the
previous two months.
   Both the building and manufacturing sectors have borne the brunt
of high interest rates as the Federal Reserve attempted to stem
inflation by slowing the economy.
   ``The June leading indicators report dashes almost all hope that
the economy will pick up steam later this year,'' said Richard W.
Rahn, chief economist with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   ``The weak industrial sector will get even weaker by year's end
as manufacturers' new orders fall and growth in unfilled orders
wanes,'' Rahn added. ``It would take only a mild amount of order
cancellations to stop growth in industrial production and turn a
weak economy into recession.''
   Both manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods and unfilled
orders were among the negative statistics in the June report.
Others were a decline in the money supply, a drop in an index
measuring consumer confidence, a decrease in orders for new plants
and equipment and an increase in weekly unemployment claims.
   The consumer confidence index also was negative in May, leading
some analysts to fear consumers were retrenching. Consumers account
for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
   However, Commerce eased these fears Monday when it reported that
personal consumption jumped 1.0 percent in June, suggesting
consumers would keep the weak economy alive.
   Nevertheless, only four of June's leading indicators were
positive: an increase in the price of raw materials, higher stock
prices, an increase in building permits and slower business
delivery times. The length of the average workweek was unchanged.
   The various changes left the index at 146.0 percent of its 1982
base of 100 and up 1.4 percent from its level a year ago.

<TEXT>
   Israel's Mossad spy agency ordered an analysis
of Saddam Hussein's handwriting and got back a recommendation that
the Iraqi president needed psychiatric care, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
   The report in the daily Yediot Ahronot said the graphologist who
examined Saddam's handwriting several months ago did not know the
identity of his subject.
   The report gave no further details of the handwriting analysis.
Israeli officials routinely refuse to comment on activities of the
Mossad.
   The newspaper said the results of the handwriting analysis were
shown to Israeli leaders to help them ``assess the degree of
severity and importance that should be attributed to Saddam's
threats and declarations.''
   In April, Saddam threatened to respond with binary chemical
weapons if Israel staged a nuclear attack on an Arab country.
   The newspaper quoted the handwriting expert's report as saying
the subject ``should be hospitalized immediately.''
   ``He is a hasty decision maker, and has a tendency for radical
mood swings, is ready to take extreme decisions and carry them out,
has violent tendencies and is dangerous to his environment,'' it
said.

   The Senate voted today to ban outside speaking

   The 77-23 vote on an amendment by Sen. Christopher Dodd,

bill. The ban would take effect next January. At present, senators
are allowed to accept up to $27,337 a year in honoraria.
   ``When a significant part of our salaries comes from hustling,
and that's what it amounts to, we denigrate ourselves,'' Dodd said.
``As public servants, our salaries should come from the public
alone.''
   The House voted last year to give up honoraria effective Jan. 1,
1991, but also boosted the salaries of its members from $98,400 to
$124,000 then. Reluctant to vote themselves a 25 percent pay boost,
the Senate had skirted the honoraria issue up until today.
   ``The scandals of the past two years have put a black mark on
public service and raised public cynicism to an all-time high,''
Byrd said, citing $9 million in honoraria senators have accepted
over the past decade. ``We're about at the level of used car
salesmen'' in the public's esteem.
   The Senate voted last week to denounce Sen. David Durenberger,
R-Minn., for violating several ethics standards, including skirting
the limits on honoraria in a book-publishing deal. Six other
senators are under investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee for
alleged actions involving savings and loan institutions and
Department of Housing and Urban Development programs.
   Dodd's amendment won the support of 53 of the Senate's 55
Democrats and 24 of it 45 Republicans.
   In 1989, senators accepted nearly $3 million in honoraria and
kept more than $2.1 milion, with the balance donated to charity,
according to their financial disclosure forms. Dodd, the sponsor of
the ban, reported accepting $15,000 in 1989.
   GOP Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, one of the largest recipients of
honoraria, said he agreed with Dodd on the need to eliminate
senators' honoraria income but not on the strategy of doing it
without a pay raise.
   ``In January, House members will be getting paid about $22,000
more than senators ... and we could be getting about $22,000 less
for years to come,'' he said.
   Dole said he had considered trying to amend Dodd's measure to
include a raise that would return Senate and House salaries to
parity but acknowledged he lacked the votes to win its passage this
close to the November election.
   Despite the vote, several lawmakers doubted that the honoraria
ban will be enacted because of its attachment to what Republicans
claim has become a highly Democratic partisan campaign finance
reform bill.
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said White House Chief of Staff
John Sununu told him Wednesday morning that President Bush would
veto the current version with its Democratic-proposed ceilings on
how much candidates can spend in an election.
   Byrd said members of the Senate, himself among them, have
supplemented their salaries with a total of more than $9 million in
honoraria from special interest groups over the past decade.

   He said it would be hypocritical for the Senate to ``leave the
back door open'' for its members to supplement their $98,400
salaries with up to $27,300 in speaking fees while claiming to
remove special interest money from campaigns.
   ``The pay system that has evolved _ with the public paying the
bulk of a senator's salary and a handful of interest groups picking
up the rest _ is untenable,'' Dodd said. ``Our salaries should come
from the public alone.''
   Meanwhile, outnumbered Republicans are complaining that it is
only their traditional sources of political money that are being
singled out for ``reform'' in the bill to clean up the way
elections are financed.
   ``All of the bipartisanship has completely broken down,'' Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., said after losing a 49-49 tie vote on his
measure to make candidates turn surpluses in their campaign
accounts over to the government instead of keeping them for use in
future elections.
   On largely party-line votes Tuesday, Democrats defeated
amendments to strip unions of their tax-exempt status if they
engage in politics and to allow union members to demand refunds of
any dues spent on elections or lobbying.
   Republicans claimed the votes demonstrate that the Democrats'
campaign finance reform bill and its spending ceilings is a
``partisan charade'' that will assure a veto by President Bush.
   Democrats contended they did their compromising last week,
agreeing to Bush's proposal to abolish labor, corporate and trade
association political action committees in an effort to get
Republicans to accept some form of aggregate lid on how much
candidates can spend.
   The population-based Democratic spending ceilings would range
from $2 million for Senate candidates in small states to slightly
over $10 million in the largest one, California.

<TEXT>
   Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder told fellow
black leaders today that they are role models for a struggling
generation.
   ``There has never been placed any greater responsibility on any
groups of people anywhere in the history of the world than that
which is presently placed on this generation of black people,''
Wilder said at a National Urban League conference.
   Wilder cited statistics that one-fourth of all black American
males between ages 18 and 25 are in prison or on parole. He said
the public school dropout rate is diminishing the workforce and
future leadership prospects.
   Youngsters also face the problems of drug abuse, infant
mortality and teen-age pregnancies. But nonetheless, Wilder said,
he remains optimistic.
   The governor said conference members must instill black children
with the attitude: ``I was not delivered into this world in
defeat.''
   ``We must insist upon excellence in education and a willingness
to prepare our youngsters: not only to make passing grades, but to
be acceptable to institutions of higher learning at graduate
levels,'' he said.
   The nation's first black elected governor recalled that when he
decided to run for the state Senate, he was told, ``That hasn't
been done.'' Then, 16 years later, he wanted to become lieutenant
governor, and was told, ``You've got to understand, this is
Virginia.''
   He ignored the nay-sayers.
   ``The Declaration of Independence was written by a Virginian,''
said Wilder. And when it endowed citizens with ``certain
inalienable rights, I knew it meant me.''
   Now, Wilder said, when boys and girls visit the governor's
office, he tells them: ``Why don't you sit in my chair a while?''

   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter has sold
his interests in a number of companies as promised at his Senate
confirmation early last year, financial disclosure reports showed
Wednesday.
   The sales included stocks in RJR Nabisco, Philip Morris, IBM,
Caterpillar, 3M, ConAgra, Emhart, Upjohn and several others, as
part of Yeutter's pledge to avoid conflicts of interest or
appearances of conflict.
   David L. Spradlin of the Agriculture Department's personnel
office said Yeutter had filed the annual disclosure on May 5, but
it was returned for additional information and clarification.
   Yeutter joined the Reagan administration in 1985 as U.S. trade
representative. Previously he was head of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange and had extensive business and farming interests, as well
as careers in law and economics.
   President Bush named him as secretary of agriculture with an eye
on 1990 farm legislation and to help in agricultural negotiations
during the current trade talks under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
   The company interests sold by Yeutter made up a fraction of the
total assets listed in his financial statement. No exact figures
were listed in the disclosure forms, but Yeutter's assets totaled
more than $800,000 and possibly much more.
   Selling prices of the stocks sold varied from $15,000 to $50,000
in the case of ConAgra and Philip Morris, for example, to $5,000 to
$15,000 for Caterpillar and Upjohn.
   Chief among his assets are two farms shared with other family
members. One of 2,000 acres in Dawson County, Neb., was valued at
``over $250,000'' in the report. The other, 200 acres, is in
Lancaster County, Neb., and was also listed among Yeutter's assets
at ``over $250,000.''
   Yeutter reported a 1989 salary as secretary of agriculture at
$107,300. Outside income was indicated at more than his federal
salary, including at least $55,000 from the two Nebraska farms,
$15,000-plus from a condominium in Keystone, Colo., and $40,000 or
more from other investments.
   Liabilities, mostly mortgages, were put at between approximately
$830,000 and $1.35 million.
   Under gifts, reimbursements and gratuities, Yeutter listed a
$150 silver dish from John MacGregor, the United Kingdom's
agriculture minister; a $150 miniature clock from Gerhard Weiser of
West Germany; and a $130 silver plate from Galal Abu El Dahak,
Egypt's trade minister.
   A reviewer's comment said all gifts were ``under the threshold''
allowed for such gifts and that Yeutter could keep them.
   Free honorary membership in the Army-Navy Club, valued at $250,
and $456 in air fare for Mrs. Yeutter provided by the American
Enterprise Institute to participate in a world economic forum also
was allowed.

<HEAD>Jury Acquits Man of Murder After 2-year-old Burrito Found in

<TEXT>
   A man charged with murder was acquitted by a
jury persuaded in part by the discovery of a 2-year-old burrito in
the defendant's jacket pocket.
   The burrito was hurriedly introduced as evidence at the trial's
close to support Edward Vasquez' alibi that he was buying the
burrito at a canteen truck when security guard Israel Martinez was
shot to death in 1988.
   Vasquez was freed after his arrest on $10,000 bail but his
jacket was seized as evidence and held in police custody until the
trial.
   Then Vasquez, 23, put it on to display it for the jury and told
his attorney it felt ``like there was something heavy in the right
pocket.''
   The jury had already begun deliberations last week when defense
attorney Jay Jaffe asked to re-examine the jacket and discovered
the foil-wrapped burrito.
   Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg allowed Jaffe to reopen
his final arguments, citing the new evidence.
   ``He didn't shoot the security guard, and this proves it,''
Jaffe told jurors as he unwrapped the well-preserved burrito.
   Jurors acquitted Vasquez on Tuesday. They said they had been
split 8-4 for acquittal before the burrito defense came into play.
   Vasquez insisted he was across a parking lot when Martinez, 42,
was killed in a September 1988 gun battle at the California State
University Los Angeles campus.
   ``I'm just happy that the jury saw through what never should
have been a prosecution. He endured a nightmare for two years just
because he was at the wrong place at the wrong time,'' said Jaffe.

   Magic Johnson helped Michigan State
University win a college basketball title 11 years ago. Now, he
would like to help run the school.
   Michigan Democratic Party officials suggested Johnson run for a
seat on the board of trustees for the East Lansing school.
   Johnson, who led the Los Angeles Lakers to five National
Basketball Assocaiton championships, said in a statement Tuesday
that he was ``very interested.''
   Johnson, 30, would return next week to his hometown of Lansing
to re-establish residency and register to vote, said Joel Ferguson,
a Democratic Party activist.
   To run for the board, Johnson must be a resident for at least 30
days and be nominated by the Democratic Party at its state
convention Sept. 8-9 in Flint.
   Gov. James Blanchard hopes Johnson's candidacy would attract
voters to the polls for the Nov. 6 election, in which Blanchard is
seeking his third term.

   Actor Emilio Estevez agrees the movie western
``Young Guns,'' dismissed by critics as a Brat Pack-on-horseback
charade, was a career misstep.
   So why the sequel ``Young Guns 2'' opening this week?
   ``I have been a fan of the western movies since I was a little
kid and I did `Young Guns' in the hope that it would help bring
back the western,'' Estevez, 27, said in an interview this week.
   ``John Fusco wrote a magnificent script, but then it was turned
into what I call Hollywood's first heavy-metal western. It was just
an excuse for a personality piece featuring all these young actors,
and I was very disappointed.''
   Fusco also wrote the script for the sequel, but this time
there's a different director and a bigger scope, Estevez said.
   ``This one has a wide-screen look with a big, glorious musical
score, and the most accurate depiction of Billy the Kid of any film
ever made on him,'' he said.
   ``Young Guns 2'' is the 43rd movie about the legendary gunman.

   Former comedian Dick Gregory has told a federal
court he can't afford to repay an old friend $105,000 because he
has other debts totaling more than $1 million.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Harrington ordered Gregory to submit
a financial affidavit by Friday.
   Gregory, 58, of Plymouth, borrowed $40,000 in 1979 from Frank
Nicholas II. Nicholas sued Gregory in 1987 to recover the loan plus
interest, bringing the debt to $105,000.
   Nicholas urged the court to find Gregory in contempt. However,
Gregory said in court Monday that he can't repay the debt because
he also owes more than $1.2 million to the Internal Revenue
Service, American Express, banks and other creditors.

<HEAD>Five European Countries Expand Regional Alliance</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VENICE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five European countries, meeting for the
first time as a new regional alliance, agreed Wednesday to step up
political and economic cooperation to promote stability on the
changing continent.
   The leaders of Italy, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary and
Yugoslavia reached a wide range of accords aimed at strengthening
democracy and spurring economic development in eastern and central
Europe.
   The agreements came at the first summit of the so-called
Pentagonal Initiative, a regional alliance founded in Budapest in
November 1989.
   All the delegations except Italy's were led by heads of
government. The host country was represented by Deputy Premier
Claudio Martelli because Premier Giulio Andreotti was forced to
stay in Rome to ensure passage of a bill in the Chamber of Deputies.
   The leaders said the initiative should play a vital role in
consolidating the political upheavals that have swept away
Communist regimes across Eastern Europe, including in Hungary and
Czechoslovakia.
   ``Shifting from ideological rivalry to the implementation of
joint programs in the economic field and other sectors will be the
most effective way of avoiding any temptation to revert to the
past,'' they said in a joint declaration.
   The leaders said the new Europe should be based on parliamentary
and pluralistic democracy and a free market economy.
   ``The choice is no longer the continuation of the classic game
of balances but the construction of new forms of collaboration and
integration,'' Martelli said in a speech. ``In a period of such
tumultuous change, it is necessary to strengthen dialogue and
reciprocal consultation.''
   Officials said the alliance could help bring East European
countries closer to the European Community and act as a possible
counterweight to the political and economic strength of a unified
Germany.
   The bulk of the accords involved projects for improving
transportation links between the countries. The leaders agreed to
establish four main road corridors and six railway lines and to
expand air and maritime networks.
   It is not yet known, however, where the funds for these projects
will come. Among the observers at the summit were officials of the
World Bank and the European Investment Bank.
   Other agreements were reached in the fields of
telecommunications, the environment, small- and medium-size
enterprises, scientific and technical research, culture, tourism
and information.
   A point of contention appeared to be the question of admitting
Poland to the group.
   At a news conference, Hungarian Premier Jozsef Antall said he
supported the idea of including Poland. Martelli, however, said no
such request has been made and there were no immediate plans to
expand the alliance.
   Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitsky said he proposed that the
group study the possibility of abolishing nuclear power, as his
country has done.
   ``This must be accepted by the majority,'' he said. ``It can't
be implemented in a fortnight.''
   The leaders also took up the question of minorities, a
potentially explosive issue in several countries, especially
Yugoslavia. No specific decisions were made, although Hungary will
chair a technical committee studying the problem.

<HEAD>Investigators Say IRS Losing Fight to Collect Overdue Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service is losing its
battle against overdue taxes, which are growing faster than tax
collections, government auditors said Wednesday.
   ``Each year IRS falls farther and farther behind in its efforts
to reduce the accounts-receivable balance,'' Paul L. Posner,
associate director of the General Accounting Office, told the
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. Unless the problem is
reduced, he said, it ``could have a serious negative impact on
voluntary taxpayer compliance.''
   Accounts receivable _ which the IRS estimates grew from $30
billion in 1984 to $66 billion last year _ represent taxes that
have been assessed but not paid, such as when a taxpayer files a
return but fails to remit what is owed. The IRS says 13 million
couples, individuals and businesses are involved.
   The IRS, the GAO and other experts agree that accounts
receivable may be exaggerated by as much as 50 percent. Accounts
receivable are the total of unpaid income, payroll and other taxes
due over the last six years, generally the legal maximum the IRS
can go back to in collecting taxes.
   Over the last six years, Posner said, accounts receivable ``grew
three times faster than collections of delinquent taxes and twice
as fast as total net tax receipts.'' He said it is especially
disturbing that the average age of accounts is getting older,
meaning the debts are less likely to be collected.
   ``This rapid, out-of-control growth in unpaid taxes threatens to
overwhelm the IRS and is absolutely unacceptable at a time when the
administration and Congress are grappling with painful revenue and
spending choices,'' said Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, chairman of the
committee.
   Accounts receivable are different from the ``tax gap,'' which is
the difference in income taxes that are collected and what would be
collected if individuals and businesses correctly reported their
income and deductions. The gap is expected to be about $100 billion
this year alone.
   IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg Jr. acknowledged that accounts
receivable are a worrisome problem but said the agency is making
progress.
   For example, he said, the IRS this year is collecting $472,000
in delinquencies for each staff member in the collections division,
up from $388,000 two years ago. The division is expected to collect
$26.5 billion this year, compared with $23.3 billion in 1988.
   Goldberg said there has been a slow but steady increase in
accounts the IRS believes will never be collected because of death,
bankruptcy or inability to locate the debtor. That $27 billion is
in addition to the $66 billion.
   Goldberg said there will be dramatic reductions in accounts
receivables only when IRS's 30-year-old computer system is
modernized; when the agency's budget is stabilized so that staffer
hiring and training can be improved, and when tax laws are
simplified.
   President Bush's budget for the IRS for next year would allow
hiring 1,050 new collection personnel. ``This represents the growth
we can prudently manage and absorb during 1991. No more, no less,''
he said.
   Goldberg said that in February, the IRS had nearly 800,000
accounts totaling $1.8 billion that could not be worked because of
lack of personnel. That shortage was a result of a two-year hiring
freeze that was imposed on the IRS, he said.
   John Pepping, an IRS collections officer in the Laguna Niguel,
Calif., district, said the personnel shortage there is so severe
that as a rule no account under $50,000 is sent to the field for
collection. He testified on behalf of the National Treasury
Employees Union, which represents most IRS workers.
   Robert M. Tobias, president of the union, urged Congress to
boost the IRS budget sufficiently to hire 5,000 new collectors over
the next three years. That would boost collections by $6.1 billion
over five years, he said.

<TEXT>
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's guerrillas
attacked the main base of a pro-Iranian Palestinian faction
Wednesday and then clashed with its fighters barricaded inside a
mosque in a refugee camp.
   Fifteen people were killed and 95 wounded in clashes between the
two Palestinian forces.
   The confrontations were an offshoot of a three-week battle
between Iranian-backed fundamentalists and their more secular
rivals for control of Iqlim al-Tuffah, or Apple Province, which is
next to the border strip Israel occupies in south Lebanon.
   The inter-Palestinian fighting rekindled the battles between the
Iranian-backed fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the
Syrian-backed Amal militia in the Apple Province.
   Police said three combatants were killed and 10 wounded in that
fighting, raising the overall toll in the three-week battle to 189
dead and 570 injured.
   The inter-Palestinian fighting started when guerrillas from
Arafat's Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization
launched an assault on the main base of Maj. Jamal Suleiman, a
Fatah renegade.
   Fatah fighters have fought alongside the Amal militiamen, while
Suleiman supports Hezbollah. On Monday, Suleiman's fighters fired
40 rockets at Fatah positions in the Apple Province, wounding at
least seven guerrillas, PLO officials said.
   The inter-Palestinian fighting spread to the Ein el-Hilweh
refuge camp after Arafat's guerrillas crushed Suleiman's base in
Jabal al-Haleeb, or the Milk Mountain, on the camp's eastern edge.
   Suleiman and about 30 of his 150 followers escaped the first
attack and barricaded themselves inside the Nour mosque in Ein
el-Hilweh.
   Other Moslem fundamentalist Palestinians soon joined them there.
   Col. Wajih Abu Ali, commander of the PLO's military police in
the Sidon region, where the camp is located, said the
fundamentalists opened fire at Fatah forces from the mosque and a
nearby alley.
   Arafat's men ringed the mosque and were ``responding to the
shooting,'' Abu Ali said.
   Witnesses in Ein el-Hilweh said about a dozen clergymen were
using the mosque's loudspeakers to blare calls for a jihad, or holy
war, against Arafat.
   ``It's a sensitive situation. Fatah cannot easily attack a
mosque to evict them. Other anti-Arafat groups might suppport them
too. The situation in the camp is very tense,'' Abu Ali said.
   At nightfall, guerrillas from terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal's
Fatah Revolutionary Council joined Suleiman's fighters around the
mosque and mounted a counterattack on Milk Mountain, police said.
   ``They have managed to recapture many of their positions in the
mountain,'' the police spokesman said.
   Arafat has at least 5,000 hardcore fighters in the Sidon region.
   Also Wednesday, police said intermittent exchanges of machine
gun and rocket-propelled grenade fire between Amal and Hezbollah
fighters in the Apple Province prevented rescuers from the
International Committee of the Red Cross from evacuating dozens of
decomposing bodies.

   Efforts to develop drugs for AIDS-related
diseases are hindered by federal rules which bar hospital insurance
coverage for people receiving novel treatments, the government's
chief AIDS researcher said Wednesday.
   Dr. Anthony S. Fauci and other witnesses told a House Government
Operations subcommittee that the lack of public and private
insurance for hospital care in clinical trials prevents thousands
of people from receiving potentially life-prolonging treatment.
   Insurers, including the public Medicare and Medicaid programs,
do not regularly reimburse for treatments that are considered to be
experimental. A person with an AIDS-related infection who does not
receive experimental treatment would be reimbursed, according to
Fauci and others.
   Both AIDS research and the health-care reimbursement programs
fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Health and Human
Services.
   AIDS and the particularly virulent ``opportunistic infections''
that follow it strike largely at people least able to afford
hospital care, witnesses said.
   The infections strike all organs, including the eyes, lungs and
intestines, and, along with tumors, cause most AIDS deaths. AIDS
weakens the body's ability to resist ordinary bacteria, fungi,
parasites and viruses.
   Fauci told the subcommittee on human resources and
intergovernmental relations that he has brought up the gap in
biweekly meetings of the interagency HIV Leadership Group.
   The response within the department is that ``they were very
sympathetic with the difficulties this is posing for us in the
conduct of our trials, but a solution is not readily at hand,''
Fauci said.
   He said the problem is an unwillingness to spend more money on
reimbursements that are already stretching the government for
non-experimental hospitalizations.
   ``We do not agree from the biomedical, research and health care
delivery standpoint with that philosophy,'' said Fauci, director of
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the
National Institutes of Health.
   Hospitalization is required for AIDS patients with opportunistic
infections because the infection is usually acute and patients must
be monitored around the clock, said Dr. Fred R. Sattler of the
University of Southern California's School of Medicine.
   The hearing was called to examine the status of research into
drugs used to prevent or treat opportunistic infections, and the
priority given by the NIH to research into those drugs rather than
an overall cure for AIDS.
   The institutes have recently indicated they would spend a larger
share on the drugs against opportunistic infections. And on Tuesday
evening, the NIH announced it would give $2.8 million to six teams
of scientists for research on such drugs.

   The United States will provide 30,000 bags of
rice to help feed victims of the civil war in Liberia, the State
Department said Wednesday.
   Catholic Relief Services will use commercial channels to sell
the rice at a subsidized price to enable poor Liberians to buy it,
deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said.
   The proceeds will be used for relief-related activities.
   The United States also is providing 29,200 metric tons of rice

   Mariners were securing their vessels in Halifax,
Nova Scotia, today as Hurricane Bertha continued on an expected
collision course with Canada's maritime provinces.
   Crew members aboard the damaged Greek cargo ship Corazon, caught
in the hurricane 340 miles off Cape Cod, abandoned ship early
today. At least one seaman died and six were missing early today.
   Eighteen crew members were rescued from a lifeboat and a life
raft after four or more hours in heavy seas. Three were in a
lifeboat and one was still in the water this morning, said Coast
Guard Coast Guard Lt. j.g. Rodney Gadsden.
   At noon, Bertha was centered near latitude 41.8 north and
longitude 62.0 west, or about 185 miles south southwest of Sable
Island, Nova Scotia. The hurricane was moving northeast at about 12
mph, with top sustained winds near 75 mph.
   Little change in strength or direction was expected through
Thursday morning, according to forecasters at the National
Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   The government of Canada has issued a heavy rainfall and wind
warning for the eastern Canadian maritime provinces, and tropical
storm force winds of at least 39 mph were beginning to reach land
early today, forecasters said.
   Rough waters attributed to the hurricane created havoc Tuesday
with swimmers in Florida, where one man drowned and nearly 200 had
to be rescued from Volusia County waters, according to chief
lifeguard, Tom Rennick.
   Nelson Lejune, 59, drowned trying to rescue his 18-year-old
foster son, Robert Perry, at New Smyrna Beach, about 15 miles south
of Daytona Beach. Perry survived.

   Because it's a cartoon, ``The Simpsons'' is
not allowed to compete for an Emmy in the category of outstanding
comedy series.
   But Nancy Cartwright can be nominated for lead actress in a
comedy series for providing the voice of animated Bart Simpson.
   How can a female be nominated for playing an imaginary boy?
   This is television. Anything is possible, if you understand the
rules of the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences.
   Actress Dana Delany of ``China Beach'' and actor Louis Gossett
Jr. will help announce this year's primetime Emmy nominees during a
news conference Thursday morning.
   Because ``The Simpsons'' is animated, it must compete in the
category of ``outstanding animated program of one hour or less,''
said John Leverence, the academy's award director.
   There are no categories for actors and actresses who provide the
voices for animated primetime shows, Leverence said.
   As a result, Julie Kavner, whose gravelly voice doubles as mom
Marge Simpson, could be nominated for outstanding lead actress in a
comedy series, as could Cartwright. Daniel Castellaneta, the
grumbling voice of baldheaded dad Homer Simpson, could be nominated
as lead actor in a comedy series.
   The phenomenally successful Simpsons are likely to be part of a
Fox Broadcasting Co. nomination list that could also include ``In
Living Color,'' a black, saucier version of ``Saturday Night Live''
that has received rave reviews.
   The now-retired ``Tracey Ullman Show,'' which won Fox its first
Emmy, may also be on the list for outstanding variety series.
   In the category of outstanding comedy series, Emmy favorites are
``Cheers'' and ``The Golden Girls'' on NBC, ``The Wonder Years'' on
ABC, and ``Murphy Brown'' and ``Designing Women'' on CBS.
   Roseanne Barr and her top-rated ABC comedy series ``Roseanne''
will likely be snubbed again this year, the actress and network
sources said.
   Cult hit ``Twin Peaks'' on ABC is favored for a nomination for
best drama series. Past ABC Emmy winners ``China Beach'' and
``thirtysomething,'' as well as ``In the Heat of the Night'' on
NBC, also are favored.
   ``Twin Peaks'' lead actors Kyle MacLachlan and Michael Ontkean,
as coffee- and pie-loving law enforcement officers, may get
nominated, as may female stars Piper Laurie, Peggy Lipton and Joan
Chen.
   Emmy winner Patricia Wettig's portrayal of a young mother
suffering from ovarian cancer on ``thirtysomething'' may nab her
another nomination. Delany of ``China Beach,'' who won last year
for outstanding lead actress in a drama series, also could get
another nod this year.
   In the movies and miniseries categories, favorite choices are
``Small Sacrifices'' starring Farrah Fawcett on ABC, ``The Kennedys
of Massachusetts'' on ABC, ``Murder in Mississippi'' on NBC and
``Phantom of the Opera'' on NBC.
   The NBC movie about the murders of three young civil rights'
workers in Mississippi also could get nominations for stars Blair
Underwood and Tom Hulce.
   The winners will be selected Aug. 26-27 by panels of directors,
actors and writers who vote only in their professional categories.
   The 42nd annual primetime Emmy awards ceremony will be broadcast
live on Fox on Sunday, Sept. 16.

<TEXT>
   Some victims of the tornadoes that
devastated Petersburg in June feel insults have been added to their
injuries after receiving bills up to $200 for ambulance services.
   ``It just hasn't set right with some of the people,'' said the
Rev. Jeffrey Stratton, Petersburg's volunteer coordinator.
   More than a dozen people have received the bills, Stratton said.
   ``What I have told the people is that an ambulance service is
still a business,'' Stratton said. ``Although I doubt if that
(billing) was the first thing on their minds, it still cost them
money.''
   Jess Roberts, director of Alexander Ambulance Services in
Evansville, said 23 ambulances from throughout southern Indiana
helped with disaster relief following the tornadoes June 2 that
killed seven residents.
   Roberts said Alexander billed four tornado victims and later
regretted it. The company sent letters on July 17 to people who had
received the bills advising that no collection would be attempted
because the service was voluntary.
   ``We had discussed it but decided it was just a cost of doing
business,'' he said Tuesday.
   It cost Alexander $6,000 to $7,000 to send five ambulances, two
wheelchair vans and 20 workers to Petersburg, Roberts said. Much of
the equipment was used to transport 99 residents of the Petersburg
Health Care Center to other area nursing homes.
   Other ambulance services said they planned to bill patients that
had been transported.
   Janet Hunt, director of the Pike County Emergency Medical
Services, said six people would be billed, but all were covered by
insurance.
   Rick Shephard, director of Ziemer-Bassemier Ambulance Service in
Evansville, said he planned to bill the insurance companies of two
people transported.

<TEXT>
   One out of every five businesses seeking
credit in the last six months had trouble borrowing funds,
according to a survey released Wednesday by the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce.
   ``The credit crunch on business is more serious and more
widespread than previously has been acknowledged,'' said chamber
Vice President Richard W. Rahn in releasing the poll of 8,190
responding businesses.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan noted July 12 that
credit had become tight and said the central bank would lower
short-term interest rates to ease the situation.
   The federal funds rate, which is what banks charge each other
for overnight loans, subsequently dropped from 8.25 per cent to 8
percent.
   The Fed had kept the rate relatively high for more than a year
in an attempt to slow the economy and thus lessen inflationary
pressures.
   Rahn attributed the credit situation to the ``economic slowdown,
increased bank regulation and the effects of the thrift-industry
bailout.''
   Small businesses especially are feeling the impact, he said. Of
firms with sales of less than $1 million, 27.4 percent seeking
credit reported trouble.
   Only 19.2 percent of firms with sales between $1 million and
$9.9 million reported problems, while just 12.3 percent of
businesses with sales of more than $10 million expressed complaints.
   Hardest hit were real estate firms, with 33.3 percent of those
seeking credit having trouble obtaining it. But at least one in
four construction, communications and transportation companies and
small services-oriented businesses also reported trouble in the
survey.
   Least affected, the poll showed, were businesses in the finance
or banking fields.
   By region, the worst crunch appeared to be in the Northeast
where 26.2 percent of the respondents reported having trouble
obtaining credit. Trouble also was experienced by 24.6 percent of
the businesses in the West, 23.1 percent in the South and 15.6
percent in the Midwest.

<TEXT>
   Federal officials today approved the use
of oil-eating microbes to help clean up a 17-mile oil slick in
Galveston Bay that has stained beaches and threatened wildlife in
delicate marshlands.
   Crews in Galveston Bay used booms to hold the 500,000-gallon
spill in check as the Coast Guard opened an inquiry in Houston
today into the cause of Saturday's barge-tanker collision.
   Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Robert Douville, chief of investigations
for the Marine Safety Office at New Orleans, said officials had
subpoenaed four tanker crewmen for questioning.
   Douville said the hearings will take up to three days.
   Thousands of feet of booms, five skimmers and a vacuum truck
were used Tuesday in the cleanup. The vessels were to return at
daylight.
   ``The oil is significantly disappearing and is being picked
up,'' said Coast Guard Petty Officer Dennis Schaefer. Salvage crews
had retrieved about 48,400 gallons of the spill by Tuesday night,
he said.
   Heavy black oil was reported on bathing beaches near San Leon.
Oil also washed up at Texas City, Bolivar Peninsula and Pelican
Island off Galveston, and two sea bird deaths have been blamed on
the spill, the Coast Guard said.
   Environmentalists feared more damage because the oil is thick
and unlikely to dissipate in the bay, which is protected from the
Gulf of Mexico by barrier islands that contain nesting grounds for
birds and other wildlife.
   ``The worst kind of spill you can have is one behind these
barrier islands, which is what we've got,'' said Larry McKinney,
director of resource protection for the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department.
   ``With the quantity of the oil reported, the location of the
spill and the sheen that is 17 miles long, that's setting us up for
a worst-case scenario.''
   At least 100 species of birds, including the endangered brown
pelican, and at least 75 types of fish inhabit the bay area,
McKinney said.
   The spill occurred after a Greek tanker collided with two barges
in the Houston Ship Channel, sinking one barge and damaging the
other. Both leaked oil. The double-hull tanker did not lose any of
its 29,400 metric tons of jet fuel.
   Coast Guard Rear Adm. Jim Loy, who flew over the slick Tuesday,
said he recommended contractors bring in about five more skimmers.
But he added, ``I think we have a pretty good handle on the
environmentally sensitive areas.''
   The Coast Guard said today that surface oil has dissipated but
the crude may have sunk.
   After a two-hour meeting, a 14-member federal and state team
overseeing the cleanup approved using oil-eating microbes on parts
of the spill, said Texas General Land Office spokesman Blanton
Moore.
   He expected the microbes to be spread over sensitive marshlands
and shallow areas that skimmers can't reach. The organisms convert
the oil into a fatty substance fish can eat, and die when the oil
runs out.
   The process was first tested on open waters after the
supertanker Mega Borg spilled 3.9 million gallons of oil into the
Gulf of Mexico in June, and state officials had pronounced the
experiment a success.
   ``Our concern is not to introduce something into the water that
we're not very sure about,'' Loy said Tuesday.
   But Texas Land Commissioner Garry Mauro said the microorganisms
used in June already are EPA-approved. ``If there were questions
about the side effects of this procedure, they should have been
answered at that time,'' he said.
   The busy Houston Ship Channel closed after the accident but
reopened to incoming barge traffic Tuesday.
   About 100 barges were waiting to enter, and as many as 60 ships
were waiting to get in and about the same number were waiting to
leave, the Coast Guard said.
   The disruption costs shippers a total of about $1.5 million a
day, said Ted Thorjunssen, president of the West Gulf Maritime
Association.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
and Soviet Foreign Minister dnadze discussed
conventional arms control and U.S.-Soviet coopEduard A. Shevareration in
a marathon
meeting Wednesday, Soviet sources said.
   But in talks that lasted into the night in a remote fishing
lodge, the envoys did not discuss the 12-year-old civil war in
Afghanistan, expected to mark the highlight of the two-day talks.
   There has been speculation of a settlement in the conflict since
Baker arrived in Irkutsk Wednesday. Expectations were heightened
after a sudden visit by Afghan President Najibullah to Moscow on
Sunday.
   But on Wednesday, a source close to the negotiations said no
breakthrough was expected to end the war, which has claimed more
than 1.5 million lives and left Afghanistan in ruins.
   ``Exaggerated expectations were created,'' he said on condition
of anonymissed a busy schedule
of meetings for the rest of this year.
   Baker will meet Shevardnadze again when he travels to Moscow
Sept. 12 for talks on German unification among the two Germanys and
the four World War II allies _ France, England, the United States
and the Soviet Union. The two meet in New York Oct. 1-2 during
international talks on conventional arms.
   During a three-hour talk Wednesday morning, Shevardnadze gave
Baker a 15-page outline of areas for economic and scientific
cooperation, the source said.
   The outline mentioned capital investment, U.S.-Soviet space
projects and joint work on ecology and medical research, the source
said. Tass said one space project would be a joint flight to Mars.
   The document was a response to Baker's July 18 offer at a
meeting with Shevardnadze in Paris of U.S. technical advice on the
failing Soviet economy.
   Another Soviet source, quoting a draft of a four-page
U.S.-Soviet communique, said that under an economic cooperation
package, Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher and leading
American businessmen will join Baker in Moscow in September to meet
with Soviet counterparts.
   Resolution of the Afghan conflict appears hung up on the role to
be played in Afghanistan by Najibullah, the 43-year-old former
security chief who uses only one name.
   The United States has reportedly softened its demand that
Najibullah step down before elections can be held. But the
U.S.-backed Afghan resistance wants Najibullah to relinquish power
before it comes to the negotiating table.
   A compromise in which Najibullah would remain president but give
up control over his country's military and security forces is being
considered, the first Soviet source said.
   Wednesday's talks occurred against a backdrop of water sports
and sightseeing. Baker and Shevardnadze rode a hydrofoil on the
Angara River and fished for an hour. Shevardnadze caught a trout
but Baker came away empty handed.
   At one point as the two envoys walked among a crowd of 200
well-wishers, Baker mussed the hair of a sullen 6-year-old Siberian
boy and said, ``I love Siberia. I love Siberia.''
   ``They don't recognize their own minister but they certainly
recognize you, sir,'' Shevardnadze mused to Baker.
   Shevardnadze and Baker were interviewed as they returned from
the fishing lodge tucked into a forest on the banks of the Angara
River, to Irkutsk, a tree-lined city filled with log cabins and
known as the ``Paris of Siberia.''

<TEXT>
   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Moslem militants surrendered
today and began freeing their 42 hostages, ending a six-day coup
attempt that seriously threatened the government and reportedly
left at least 20 people dead.
   The 25 people who had been held hostage since Friday at the
government television station left the building one by one, were
searched in the middle of the street by soldiers, then taken away
on an army bus, state radio said.
   A short time later, the leader of the coup attempt, Abu Bakr,
and about 50 rebels left the building, dropped their weapons in the
street, put their hands behind their heads, and surrendered to
soldiers, witnesses said.
   Government spokesman Gregory Shaw said another group of soldiers
was heading over to the Parliament building, about a mile away, to
take the remaining rebels into custody and evacuate their 17
hostages, who included seven Cabinet ministers and other officials.
   Shaw said it was his understanding that Bakr and his group of
about 100 Moslem extremists had surrendered unconditionally.
   The hostages initially included the prime minister, Arthur N.R.
Robinson, but he was freed on Tuesday after offering to step down,
call new elections and grant the rebels amnesty. It was not
immediately clear whether the government would fulfill that pledge
since it was made while Robinson was held captive.
   Details of the final negotiations that produced the rebel
agreement to surrender and free all their hostages were not
immediately available.
   Earlier today, Bakr had described the coup attempt as a ``small
family squabble'' and said that an accord had been reached to end
the standoff.
   Speaking in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.
from the Caribbean nation, Bakr had indicated that the hostages
would be freed soon.
   ``The negotiations are over. We already have a signed
agreement,'' he told the BBC. ``We are making preparations now for
the evacuation of all the people, all the people at the television
house and the people who are at the Parliament building.''
   At least 20 people were reportedly killed in fighting and
looting associated with the coup attempt. The capital was reported
quiet today, but a government spokesman said there were explosions
overnight.
   ``It's very calm,'' said the spokesman, Bernard Pantin. He said
he did not know the cause of the explosions but said they were not
near the Parliament or the television station, where the captives
were being held.
   Bakr had blamed Robinson for widespread poverty in the once
oil-rich nation of 1.3 million people near Venezuela. He said in
today's interview he was seeking a ``new beginning in Trinidad.''
   Bakr's Jamaat al-Muslimeen group, which means the Moslem Group
in Arabic, was founded in 1984 and is believed to have 250 to 300
members. It is also believed to have received financing from Libya.
   The U.S. Ambassador, Charles Gargano, said no sign of popular
support surfaced for Bakr's extremist sect.
   ``This is not a revolution,'' he said. ``It is a hostage
situation.''
   Although Bakr said in the BBC interview that everyone being held
by his followers would be freed, he also denied that the people
were in fact hostages.
   ``We don't have any hostages, sir. We never had any hostages,''
he told the BBC interviewer. ``You'll have to rephrase that
question.''
   Asked whether the people in question were then free to leave,
Bakr responded: ``There's a curfew. They can't walk about in a
curfew.''
   A 6 p.m.-to-noon curfew remained in effect throughout most of
Trinidad following earlier widespread looting.
   When the interviewer expressed disbelief that only the curfew
was stopping the prisoners from leaving, Bakr also mentioned that
bus service had been disrupted.
   He said of the coup attempt, ``It was a small family squabble...
I'm saying that emphatically.''
   Robinson was allowed Tuesday to leave the besieged Parliament
building. It was not clear whether he would continue as prime
minister.
   Fifteen government officials were held hostage in the Parliament
building and 25 others in the government TV station.
   At least nine people were killed when Bakr and his followers
took over both buildings on Friday. Robinson, 63, was hospitalized
for treatment of a leg wound suffered in the takeover, as well as
for exhaustion and glaucoma.
   The government had said earlier that Robinson was shot in both
feet. There was no explanation for the discrepancy.
   Smart would not discuss the conditions under which Robinson was
freed, or say whether his health was a factor. Bakr said in today's
interview that Robinson was freed as a ``humanitarian gesture.''
   Gargano, interviewed before Robinson's release, said the
government remained united and in control. He said Robinson's
deputy, Winston Dookeran, and eight other ministers who escaped
rebel capture were running Trinidad.
   Smart said the government continued to enjoy the ``complete
loyalty'' of the 1,500-member military and 5,000-member police
force.
   In a joint telephone call Monday night from inside Parliament,
Robinson, Bakr's chief negotiator, Bilal Abdullah, and Minister of
Justice and National Security Selwyn Richardson all said a
settlement had been reached.
   Richardson said the agreement called for Robinson to resign and
for elections to be held within 90 days. But government spokesman
Gregory Shaw said there was no agreement: ``These are statements of
people being held at gunpoint. People are made to make statements.''

<HEAD>29 Hurt in Crash When Train Goes Wrong Way</HEAD>
<DATELINE>READING, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rush-hour passenger train smashed
head-on into a stationary commuter train at a station west of
London Wednesday, injuring 29 people.
   British Rail said a three-car train entering Reading station
from Tonbridge at 20 mph was switched to the wrong platform and hit
the front of a stationary eight-car commuter train from Reading to
London.
   The driver of the Tonbridge train was in critical condition at
Royal Berkshire Hospital with leg, head and back injuries. One
passenger with leg injuries was also hospitalized. The others were
released after treatment.
   Investigators said they were puzzled by the crash. Automatic
equipment should have prevented a train from running into an
occupied platform.
   They said human error or faults with signals or points were
believed to have caused the morning crash at the station, 35 miles
from London. The Tonbridge train should have stopped alongside the
London-bound train.
   Both trains were crowded but all injuries were on the Tonbridge
train, whose passengers were standing ready to get off and were
thrown forward, most suffering bruises and cuts.
   Bernadette Currie said she had just stood up, preparing to leave
the train, when she was ``jolted forward and hit the wood of the
sliding door. Some of my teeth were knocked out.''
   The Tonbridge driver was trapped by his legs in the crushed cab
for more than two hours while firefighters cut him free. He was
conscious throughout and talked to his rescuers as he received
painkillers and blood transfusions.
   ``His feet were twisted, so it was impossible to free him
immediately. We used hydraulic equipment to bend back the metal,
like opening a tin,'' said senior fire officer Lyn Ashfield.
   ``He had lost a lot of blood, but we kept talking to him to take
his mind off the pain,'' he said.
   Debra Whitehead, 23, a passenger on the Tonbridge train who
suffered a sprained neck, said: ``Everyone was thrown forward and
we were all just sitting there, wondering what had happened.
   ``I was in the third carriage from the front, but there was no
panic, just confusion,'' she said.
   British Rail has had two serious crashes in the past two years.
   Faulty wiring in a signal led to 35 people being killed and more
than 100 injured in a three-train crash at Clapham Junction in
south London during rush hour on Dec. 12, 1988.
   Driver error was blamed for a two-train crash in March 1989 near
Purley station on London's southern outskirts in which five people
died and 94 were injured.

<HEAD>Woman Says Blocking Phone Numbers from Caller ID Would Help
Harassers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman subjected to two years of obscene
phone calls, vandalism and threats from a ``telephone terrorist''
urged a Senate panel Wednesday not to restrict the new Caller I.D.
devices that display the phone numbers of incoming calls.
   Mrs. Stacey Blazer of Olney, Md., said she opposed a bill by
Sen. Herbert Kohl, D-Wis., that would require phone companies to
offer selective blocking of Caller I.D. for those customers who
don't want to reveal their phone numbers.
   In the case of harassing calls, she said, blocking would
``protect the perpetrator of the crime at the expense of their
victims.''
   Telephone companies such as Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic are
promoting Caller I.D., which displays incoming numbers on a small
video device, as a way to thwart unwanted callers. They cite
statistics in New Jersey showing a dramatic decline in the number
of obscene phone calls after Caller I.D. began there two years ago.
   But privacy advocates say callers should not be required to give
away their phone numbers to car salesmen, mail order houses and the
like whenever they make a phone inquiry. Law enforcement officials
and operators of battered women centers say blocking is essential.
   Six areas of the country now have Caller I.D., and as many as 22
states are debating whether to allow it. California requires
blocking, while a Pennsylvania court has outlawed it as a violation
of wiretaps laws. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. has offered a
similar long-distance service to businesses for several years.
   Wednesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on
technology and the law primarily focused on the issue of whose
privacy should be paramount: the caller or the called?
   ``We should not sacrifice everyone's privacy to catch a small
minority of phone terrorists,'' Kohl told the hearing.
   But Mrs. Blazer, who said Caller I.D. worked for her after
repeated cries for help to the police did not, was equally adamant:
``My right to privacy is more important than a potential harasser's
right to violate my privacy.''
   She said Caller I.D. is more effective than services such as
Call Trace, which allows a victim of a harassing call, by pushing
three numbers on the telephone, to tell phone company computers to
record the caller's phone number. Only police can gain access to
those numbers, however.
   ``I wanted to know if he lived next door or if he was one of my
husband's business associates,'' Mrs. Blazer said of a man who
called her repeatedly, threatened to rape her, banged on her door
and windows and vandalized her house. ``Call Trace wouldn't reveal
that.''
   Phone company wiretaps eventually led to the man's arrest and
conviction, she said, but only after repeated delays and red tape.
His calls resumed while he was on probation and stopped only when
she signed up for Caller I.D. earlier this year.
   ``If I had Caller I.D. two years ago, I could have prevented all
this before it began,'' she said.
   She agreed with a New Jersey Bell President James G. Cullen, who
testified that Caller I.D. would not be as effective if blocking
were allowed, particularly for harassing calls. Cullen also said
customers prefer Caller I.D. to Call Trace.
   ``Customers say they want to deal with the situation
themselves,'' Cullen said.
   But Janlori Goldman, an attorney with the American Civil
Liberties Union, said it could be dangerous for women to call back
an obscene caller and confront him.

<HEAD>Senate Asserts Role on US-Soviet Chemical Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senators warned the State Department's
designated legal adviser Wednesday about a looming confrontation
with the Bush administration over the parliamentary form of the
recent U.S.-Soviet agreement banning chemical weapons.
   President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signed the
accord at their summit in June. The measure calls for the two
countries to destroy most of existing stockpiles and end the
production of new weapons.
   At issue is whether the proposal should be an executive
agreement, which the Bush administration wants, or a treaty, which
the Senate wants.
   A treaty must be ratified by the president with the approval of
two-thirds of the Senate; an executive agreement such as the one on
chemical weapons requires a majority vote in the House and Senate.
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-N.Y., said 18 of the 19 members of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee ``think it should be a treaty.''
   He told Edwin D. Williamson, who has been nominated as the
department's legal adviser that ``at a minimum, I would hope to
elicit the constitutional basis for the administration's current
view that this accord should be an executive agreement _ not a
treaty.''
   Williamson said he needed to study the issue further because his
``initial impression'' was that the measure should be a treaty.
   If approved by the Senate, Williamson will succeed Abraham
Sofaer. A South Carolina native, Williamson, 50, has spent most of
his career with the New York law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell.

   In their ever-widening pursuit of crime, police
are patrolling their beats with cars, motorcycles, horses and
bicycles. Now add jet skis.
   The Metropolitan Police on Wednesday showed off their new
vehicle _ which looks like a waterbound snowmobile _ for tracking
down hoodlums at sea. Police touted the jet skis as unique weapons
against crime, allowing officers to nab boaters and other jet
skiers who endanger swimmers or break other rules.
   ``They're interesting and good for morale, but they're also very
effective,'' said Kathleen O'Toole, superintendent of the
Metropolitan Police.
   Officer Jim Cullinane said he needed only about five minutes of
instruction before he was ready to skim along the water. ``If
you've got the touch, you've got the touch,'' he said with a laugh.
   Cullinane and two other officers were eager to try out their new
crafts, which will patrol the Charles River and beaches along the
Atlantic Ocean. Under a warm sun, they treated onlookers to a brief
water show, making hairpin turns and weaving between other boats in
the river.
   Besides Boston, Florida's Broward County has jet ski police.
Broward County began its own jet ski patrols to catch reckless jet
ski operators. Los Angeles County police experimented with a jet
skis several years ago, but decided they weren't very effective for
rescues.
   Metropolitan Police officers, who monitor waterways around
Boston, said their primary targets would be jet ski menaces. But in
addition, they would use the department's three craft to catch
speeders and drunken boaters, and to help make rescues.
   The jet ski can make tight turns and skim along waters that
would be too shallow for motor boat patrols. It's top speed is 31
mph.
   Unlike early models, the department's jet skis allow the driver
to sit down and can carry more than one person. They are painted
blue and white _ like squad cars _ and might get flashing blue
lights.
   Police uniforms have been adapted for the conditions. Jet ski
officers will wear dark blue, short-sleeve shirts and shorts, plus
orange life jackets.
   Just like any other officers, they'll carry radios, handcuffs
and guns.
   But Officer Armand Ouellette said the jet ski's novelty would
wear off.
   ``Anything can be fun for 20 minutes,'' he said. ``When you're
out there in the 90s and cooking your brains, it ceases to be fun
real quick.''

<HEAD>Zhelev Elected First Non-Communist President in Decades</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers on Wednesday elected democratic
opposition leader Zhelyu Zhelev as Bulgaria's first non-Communist
president in more than four decades. Thousands poured into the
streets in a spontaneous celebration.
   The election of Zhelev, a 55-year-old philosopher turned
politician, ended a nearly 4-week-old political standoff after the
July 6 resignation of President Petar Mladenov, a member of the
ruling Communist party, now known as the Socialists.
   Mladenov had been popular for steering Bulgaria toward June's
free elections, but resigned after it was proved he had urged the
use of tanks in December against anti-government demonstrators.
   Thousands of supporters of Zhelev's opposition alliance, the
Union of Democratic Forces, celebrated in the streets of Sofia, a
UDF stronghold. They chanted: ``Victory!'' ``UDF!'' and ``Zhelyu!''
   ``It is a great day today,'' said one supporter, Nadia
Mihailova, 55. ``The balance (of power) has been achieved, and
hopefully things will quiet down.''
   Zhelev, who led the UDF in the June elections that the
Socialists won, became president after the 400-seat legislature
failed in five previous attempts to elect a new head of state. He
is the first non-Communist to gain any leading post in the Balkan
nation in more than 40 years.
   Zhelev was a compromise candidate backed by all parties _
including Socialist leaders _ and won 284 of the 389 votes cast. He
ran uncontested after all parties withdrew their initial candidates.
   Incumbent Socialist Premier Andrei Lukanov told the house before
the vote that Zhelev's election would mean ``a final rejection of
the factual monopoly over power.''
   His remarks indicated a commitment to pluralism in the Socialist
Party, the only former Communist Party in Eastern Europe to win
free elections. The Socialists won 211 seats in the June elections
while the UDF took 144.
   Lukanov had repeatedly said that despite his party's victory in
the June elections he did not want to lead a one-party government.
   Spreading street protests against the Socialists have also made
clear that the ruling party's support is dwindling rapidly,
necessitating some sort of cooperation with the opposition.
   Students and intellectuals have staged protests and strikes
since the June elections to demand democratic reforms.
   Before Wednesday's vote, both Zheev and Lukanov indicated that
the Socialists and opposition were willing to work together to ease
Bulgaria's social tensions and rapidly deepening economic crisis.
   In his comments before the vote, Zhelev said he wanted to see
Bulgaria make a ``peaceful evolution to democracy with the direct
participation of the political opposition.''
   Immediately following his victory, Zhelev made a surprise move
and proposed former Socialist Interior Minister Atanas Semerdzhiev
as vice president.
   Deputies greeted the suggestion with applause and voted
overwhelmingly for Semerdzhiev in a show of hands. Only two
deputies opposed the choice and seven abstained.
   Semerdzhiev resigned as Interior Minister last Friday when a
furor erupted over the proposed appearance in Parliament of Todor
Zhivkov, the Stalinist leader ousted last fall after 35 years in
power.
   The appointment of Semerdzhiev was seen as a move to narrow the
widening rift between the Socialists and the opposition.

   An 81-year-old man convicted in the
``mercy killing'' of his wife will be freed from prison Thursday
for humanitarian reasons, Gov. Bob Martinez said Wednesday.
   Roswell Gilbert, whose case focused national attention on the
killing of an ailing loved one, suffers from lung and heart disease
and physicians say he could die at any time.
   ``I think it's in the best interest of all parties concerned.''
said Martinez, a law-and-order Republican who has signed more than
120 death warrants since taking office in 1987 and previously
opposed clemency for Gilbert.
   The retired engineer was the subject of a 1987 television movie
that dramatized his decision in 1985 to kill his wife of 51 years,
who suffered from Alzheimer's disease and osteoporosis.
   ``Mr. Gilbert's declining health, and the likelihood that his
condition will continue to deteriorate if he remains in prison,
leads me to the conclusion that he should be granted clemency,''
Martinez said.
   Three of the six Cabinet members _ Comptroller Gerald Lewis,
Education Commissioner Betty Castor and Attorney General Bob
Butterworth _ signed the governor's petition, clearing the way for
Gilbert's freedom.
   ``Oh Lord, it's just such wonderful news,'' said Gilbert's
daughter, Martha Moran, in Baltimore. ``It's just wonderful.''
   Mrs. Moran said she would return to Florida immediately to help
her father resettle, probably back at a Fort Lauderdale condominium
where many of his friends reside.
   ``I think the first thing we're going to do is go out and have a
good meal, and then let daddy have a little bourbon and branch
water _ which he hasn't had in five-and-a-half years,'' she said.
   Gilbert was examined in January and a medical report showed he
suffered from heart and lung disease and was considered ``at high
risk of death at any time,'' because of his age and physical
condition.
   ``Daddy has very bad emphysema and one of the main things I'm
going to do is really insist he quit smoking,'' said Mrs. Moran,
the Gilberts' only child.
   Gilbert, who was held at the North Florida Reception Center in
Lake Butler, was sentenced to a mandatory minimum prison term of 25
years to life after being convicted of first-degree murder in the
March 1985 shooting death of his wife, Emily.
   The prosecution claimed Gilbert killed his 72-year-old wife
because she had become a burden to him.
   Kelly Hancock, the former prosecutor who put Gilbert behind
bars, visited him in prison recently and then called for his early
release. His change of heart set off a chain reaction of comment
from Cabinet members, followed by Martinez's call for clemency
Wednesday.
   Former Gov. Bob Graham and the Cabinet rejected Gilbert's
clemency request in 1985 and Martinez repeated that action as late
as January 1987, following the NBC television movie ``Mercy or
Murder.''
   Gilbert had hoped the movie would gain him support in his bid
for clemency.
   ``I would like to be vindicated,'' he said after watching the
movie in prison. ``I'm not the kind of bastard that deserves a life
sentence. That's about the same sentence that the most miserable
guy in the world would get.''

   Got a hankering for some Exxon Valdez
Halibut? A craving for Beach Crew Chili?
   If Baked Alaska sounds old-fashioned, perhaps Alaska Crude
chocolate cake will satisfy.
   These and other culinary concoctions were submitted by Exxon
Corp. workers, elected officials and others involved in the cleanup
of the nation's biggest oil spill. The recipes are collected in
``The Two Billion Dollar Cookbook.''
   The title refers to the amount Exxon reported spending to clean
up nearly 11 million gallons of crude spilled from the Exxon Valdez
in March 1989.
   A few fanciful names aside, there is little in the cookbook to
remind readers it was an oil spill that brought the contributors of
the recipes to Prince William Sound.
   ``We wanted to show some of the good story and the good news of
what's happened, with all of those people that got together to work
on the cleanup,'' said Kay Harrington, one of four women who put
together the cookbook while their Exxon-employed husbands worked on
the spill.
   ``The oil spill was the proverbial lemon, and this was an effort
to make some lemonade.''
   According to its foreword, the cookbook aims to celebrate ``the
richness of friendships and the priceless feeling of accomplishment
of a job well done.''
   ``But perhaps more importantly,'' it adds, ``our hope is that
you will find our book a recipe for healing.''
   Healing and humor are welcome in the aftermath of the spill,
said Alaska Environmental Commissioner Dennis Kelso, who hadn't
seen the cookbook.
   He cautioned against treating the cleanup as if it were over and
done with, or forgetting the damage the spill did.
   The cookbook, financed by 31 corporations and individuals,
including Exxon, went on the shelves of stores in Alaska and
Houston last week. Exxon also has the book on sale at its Anchorage
offices.
   The book's pages are sprinkled with upbeat bits of information.
It includes photos of a clean Prince William Sound. There are
anecdotes about people who met, married or had babies while working
on the spill.
   First lady Barbara Bush sent a recipe for All-American Clam
Chowder. Gov. Steve Cowper added one for Buttermilk Pie. Sen. Ted
Stevens, R-Alaska, contributed one for Salmonburgers.
   Exxon Valdez Halibut, a mix of halibut, mayonnaise, mustard and
seasoning ``invented in an Exxon trailer in Valdez,'' was submitted
by Mona Cadoret of Lafayette, La.
   Texas and Cajun cuisine are well represented, reflecting Exxon's
Houston roots.
   The last recipe in the book is for soap.
   Proceeds from the $16.95 book will be donated to an Anchorage
shelter.
   Kelso said he was sorry he didn't contribute a recipe.
   ``Blackened redfish comes to mind,'' he said with a laugh.
   ``I don't begrudge this kind of thing _ there's no reason we
can't acknowledge each other's humanity and a sense that ... we
each experienced this in a way that's appropriate to acknowledge,''
he said.

<HEAD>At Least Three Dead as Cargo Ship Founders in Hurricane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Merchant ships plucked 20 sailors from heavy
waves Wednesday after their cargo ship began to break up under the
battering of Hurricane Bertha 350 miles off Cape Cod.
   Three crew members died and four were missing.
   The crew of 27 abandoned the 593-foot Maltese-registered
freighter Corazon at 4:20 a.m., 11 hours after reporting the ship
was breaking up. Thirty-foot waves whipped by wind gusting to 90
mph had snapped its keel, the equivalent of breaking its back.
   Soviet, Hong Kong and Norwegian merchant ships steamed to the
stricken vessel to rescue crew members crowded in a lifeboat and a
life raft. U.S. military aircraft coordinated from above.
   ``She had fairly calm passage coming across the Atlantic and
Bertha just swung right into her,'' said Charles Aitcheson,
president of Asca Marine Inc. the ship's New York agent.
``Obviously, they've tried to save as many as they could. They're
all out there working hard to do it.''
   Authorities did not know if the ship was leaking fuel or how
much fuel was aboard.
   Hurricane Bertha churned on toward Canada's Maritime Provinces
carrying 75 mph wind, but was expected to weaken. A swimmer in
Florida drowned Tuesday in rough water attributed to the hurricane.
   The Corazon was carrying more than 25,000 tons of cement bound
from Greece to New York, and the load likely contributed to its
damage, said Coast Guard Lt. j.g. Rodney Gadsden.
   ``We know it came apart in heavy seas,'' he said. ``We don't
know if it was a structural problem or not. It just happened
because of the weather conditions.''
   By midmorning the Corazon's bow was submerged and its stern was
standing clear of the water 350 miles south-southwest of Cape Cod,
said Coast Guard Petty Officer Anthony L. Whitehead.
   One crew member apparently fell into the water when the crew
members boarded the lifeboat and life raft, Whitehead said. That
sailor was pulled from the water dead by the Russian trawler Vympel.
   Four hours after they left their ship, the 13 crew members on
the lifeboat were taken aboard the Soviet merchant ship Leonid
Leonidov, Whitehead said.
   But efforts to save the life raft's occupants went less
smoothly. The Vympel attempted to rescue what was reported to be 12
sailors aboard the raft, Whitehead said. But the raft was pulled
into the trawler's screw propeller and rudder area, and six or
seven sailors were pitched into the ocean.
   The five remaining aboard the life raft were later pulled to
safety. Two more life rafts were put out, and three people were
seen, apparently in one of them, Gadsden said.
   More precise accounting was unavailable, but by afternoon the
Coast Guard reported 20 sailors recovered alive, three dead and
four unaccounted for. One survivor was reported injured.
   The Hong Kong vessel Nova Europa assisted and the Norwegian
vessel Hual Angelita stood by. An Air Force C-130 flew overhead to
direct communications, and a Coast Guard C-130 flew in to help.
   Aitcheson, the ship's agent, said the crew included Greek,
Filipino, Polish and Maldivian sailors. He identified its captain
as Georgios Tsibirlos, of Chios, Greece.
   The Corazon, displacing 15,892 gross tons, was built in Japan in
1972 and previously was operated under the Philippine flag as the
Dona Corazon II, Aitcheson said. He identified the owner as Good
Faith Shipping in Piraeus, Greece.

<HEAD>Outlawed Extremist Group Claims Slaying of Catholic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An outlawed Protestant
extremist group claimed responsibility Wednesday for slaying a
Roman Catholic man during his son's fifth birthday party.
   The Ulster Freedom Fighters said in a message to Belfast media
that they killed John Judge, a 34-year-old father of three, as he
chatted to friends at his garden gate Tuesday night while the party
was underway inside his house.
   The Freedom Fighters claimed Judge was a member of the Irish
Republican Army, but the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, said he
had no connection to the organization or other paramilitary groups.
   Two gunmen riding in a taxi drove up to Judge's house in the
Springfield Road area, a West Belfast Catholic stronghold, opened
fire and escaped. The stolen taxi was later found abandoned near
the staunchly Protestant Shankill Road area of west Belfast.
   The killing was the second this year by the Freedom Fighters.
The banned group claimed it shot to death another Catholic on July
15 in Lisburn.
   Judge was the 37th person to die in political and sectarian
violence in Northern Ireland this year and the 2,811th since the
start of the so-called ``troubles'' in 1969.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite the mainly Protestant province with the overwhelmingly Roman
Catholic Irish Republic under a socialist government.

   A ``yes'' vote is a vote to pass the bill.
   Voting yes were 246 Democrats and 132 Republicans.
   Voting no were 1 Democrat and 42 Republicans.
   X denotes those not voting.
   Present denotes those who voted they were ``present'' at the
time of the vote but did not vote ``yes'' or ``no'' on the issue.

<HEAD>Plant Owners Will Ask Customers to Pay Accident Costs Until The
Year 2014</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The owners of the crippled Three Mile Island
nuclear reactor will seek to have customers pay costs associated
with the 1979 accident until the year 2014, according to plant
officials.
   The unit operated only about four months before it was
permanently disabled in the nation's worst commercial nuclear
accident on March 31, 1979. Its twin, Unit 1, was unharmed and was
given permission to resume operations in 1985. The owners hope to
operate the healthy unit until 2014.
   ``It's wrong to ask our children to pay for a nuclear reactor
that only was in operation for four months,'' Eric Epstein,
spokesman for Three Mile Island Alert, an anti-nuclear group, said
in an interview Wednesday.
   The costs are the result of the reactor's ``unique,
post-accident condition,'' plant officials said in a July 26 report
filed with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   Because of the accident, the report says it will cost $195.6
million to safely get rid of the damaged unit _ about $70 million
more than for a comparable reactor that did not suffer an accident.
   The plant's Pennsylvania owners intend to ask state utility
regulators to permit them to start billing customers for the full
amount when they make their next rate filings, probably in 1992 or
1993, said Mary Wells, a spokeswoman for General Public Utilities
Nuclear, the plant operator.
   It is standard practice for utilities to ask ratepayers to fund
decommissioning, the formal term for mothballing or dismantling a
plant at the end of its energy-producing life.
   But Three Mile Island poses ``a more difficult question,''
Pennsylvania Consumer Advocate Irwin Popowsky said in an interview
Wednesday.
   ``We have not opposed reasonable decommissioning costs for other
units on the theory that ratepayers who receive service ought to be
accumulating money to decommission it later,'' Popowski said.
   ``But TMI-2 is unique because it only provided service for a
short time. It's certainly going to be an issue,'' he said.
   Rates for the 426,000 customers of Metropolitan Edison Co.,
which owns 50 percent of the plant, could increase as much as 4
percent, plant officials said last month. Meanwhile, rates for
customers of Pennsylvania Electric Co. and Jersey Central Power &amp;
Light Co., which each own 25 percent of both units, could see rates
rise 1 percent to 2 percent, the officials said.
   In the accident, Unit 2 was allowed to lose vital cooling water
that normally covers the nuclear fuel rods.
   Financed partly by ratepayers, the subsequent $1 billion cleanup
has focused on removal of fuel from the damaged radioactive core,
waste shipment and water decontamination.
   Plant officials hope to finish the cleanup by the end of 1991,
then place Unit 2 in storage for anywhere between 20 years and 60
years while radiation decays inside. The decommissioning money
would then be recalled, and the plant could either be dismantled or
sealed.

<TEXT>
   Zhelyu Zhelev, the new Bulgarian
president, was a man of letters rather than politics before last
year's Politburo coup that toppled the hard-line Communist
leadership.
   As in other East European countries abandoning Stalinism,
Bulgaria's Parliament on Wednesday chose for the presidency an
intellectual untainted by a Communist past.
   Zhelev, an opposition leader, was the first non-Communist to
gain a top post in Bulgaria, where the former Communists, now
called Socialists, still hold an absolute majority in the Grand
National Assembly.
   But his election to the highest office illustrated the swift and
unrelenting decline of the Socialists, who now admit that despite
their June election victory they are not strong enough to govern
alone.
   Zhelev, practically unknown in Bulgaria just over a year ago,
gained prominence as chairman of the Union of Democratic Forces,
the main opposition alliance comprising 16 diverse political
parties.
   He was the only candidate in Wednesday's presidential balloting.
The ruling Socialists, the mainstream Agrarians and the Union had
withdrawn their candidates in an effort to break a deadlock in
Parliament.
   Last spring, Zhelev led the opposition in talks with the former
Communists that forced the ruling party to move toward a multiparty
system and Bulgaria's first free elections in 58 years.
   While lacking charisma and political experience at the outset,
Zhelev became a respected leader and gained considerable popularity
in Sofia and other urban centers _ mainly among intellectuals and
the country's youth.
   It was the slightly built Zhelev who stepped into an angry crowd
of students and other protesters who had blocked traffic in
downtown Sofia to demonstrate against alleged manipulations in the
June parliamentary elections.
   Days earlier, on June 7, Zhelev was the main speaker at a rally
of 500,000 Union supporters in downtown Sofia, the biggest such
event ever in modern Bulgarian times.
   Before last year's changes, Zhelev was known only to a small
group of intellectuals who managed to get a copy of his book
``Fascism,'' published in 1981. A searching analysis of
totalitarianism, the book was soon banned and has become a
bestseller only with its re-publication this year.
   In other East European nations, democratic changes that began
last fall are also being led by dissident intellectuals.
   In Czechoslovakia, Vaclav Havel rose to the presidency as a
dissident playwright who had been jailed and harassed for years.
His ideas and plays had won acclaim abroad but were banned at home.
   Similarly, Hungary's interim president, Arpad Goencz, spent
seven years in jail after the 1956 revolution and then was active
as a writer and translater of English and French literature.
   Born March 3, 1935, Zhelev studied philosophy at Sofia
University. From 1958-61 he worked in the House of Culture in
Veselinovo near Shumen in northern Bulgaria.
   In 1961-64 he engaged in postgraduate studies but failed to
complete them with a dissertation because he had criticized Lenin's
theory of matter. He was expelled from the Communist Party in 1964.
   For the next eight years, Zhelev was either jobless or worked in
casual jobs in agriculture in his wife's hometown.
   Starting in 1972, he worked for two years as a sociologist and
joined the Institute of Culture in Sofia in 1975, where he has been
active since, except for a period when he was expelled.
   Also in 1975, Zhelev's thesis was finally accepted and he
graduated as a doctor of philosophy.

<HEAD>Senate Accepts Ban on Speaking Fees _ Maybe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate, told its public esteem is ``at the
level of used-car salesmen,'' voted 77-23 on Wednesday to bar its
members from accepting fees for speeches to special-interest
groups, but immediate skepticism was raised as to whether the
decision will hold.
   The vote approved an amendment by Sen. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn., to a campaign finance overhaul bill. It requires senators
to quit giving speeches for profit as of next Jan. 1.
   But later action by the Senate and a renewed veto threat by the
Bush administration regarding the overall bill raised doubts that
the honoraria ban will make its way into the books anytime soon.
   ``This bill clearly will not become law,'' said Sen. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky. He said White House Chief of Staff John Sununu had
told him earlier Wednesday that Bush would veto it.
   The measure's chances also were complicated as the Senate began
piling other amendments onto it _ some of them likely to virtually
eliminate any chance of two-thirds, veto-proof support for the
package.
   For example, the Senate barely approved, 51-49, New York Sen.
Daniel Moynihan's proposal requiring members to forgo unearned
income of more than 15 percent of their regular salaries. That
would be a hard blow to the Senate's many millionaires, whose stock
and interest incomes far exceed their government paychecks.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, one of those millionaires, said
``It looks like a little bit of class warfare going on.'' He said
he wouldn't stay in the Senate if the Moynihan provision became law.
   Also approved was on a 59-41 vote was an amendment by Sen. Pete
Wilson, R-Calif., that would prohibit Senate candidates from
tapping earmarked funds to help pay for television ads _ until
Congress first sets aside $100 million for drug prevention centers.
   ``I don't know whether this bill is going anywhere,'' said
Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas. ``Unless there's some
changes, that's not going to be possible.''
   Senators can now pocket up to $27,337 in outside speaking fees
to supplement their annual salary of $98,400.
   ``When a significant part of our salaries comes from hustling,
and that's what it amounts to, we denigrate ourselves,'' said Dodd.
``As public servants, our salaries should come from the public
alone.''
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said members of the Senate,
himself among them, had supplemented their salaries with more than
$9 million in honoraria over the past decade.
   ``The scandals of the past two years have put a black mark on
public service and raised public cynicism to an all-time high,''
Byrd said. ``We're about at the level of used car salesmen'' in the
public's esteem.
   The Senate voted last week to denounce Sen. David Durenberger,
R-Minn., for violating several ethics standards, including skirting
the limits on honoraria in a book-publishing deal.
   Six other senators are under investigation by the Senate Ethics
Committee for alleged actions involving savings and loan
institutions and Department of Housing and Urban Development
programs.
   The House voted last year to give up honoraria effective Jan. 1,
1991, but also boosted the salaries of its members to $124,000.
Reluctant to vote itself the same 25 percent pay boost, the Senate
instead retained the opportunity for its members to accept
special-interest fees.
   Republicans, who particularly oppose the campaign bill's
provisions for aggregate spending ceilings and government vouchers
for buying TV advertising, have lost several party-line votes in
their attempts to amend it.
   Dodd, who reported $15,000 in honoraria income in 1989, called
the vote on his amendment significant, regardless of Bush's veto
threat, saying it puts the Senate on record for the first time in
favor of abolishing honoraria. He said he will add it to other
legislation if the campaign finance bill falters.
   In 1989, senators accepted nearly $3 million in honoraria and
kept more than $2.1 million, with the balance donated to charity,
according to their financial disclosure forms.
   Dole, who kept $35,750 in honoraria in 1989, said he agreed with
Dodd on the need to eliminate such income but not on the strategy
of doing it without a pay raise.
   ``In January, House members will be getting paid about $22,000
more than senators ... and we could be getting about $22,000 less
for years to come,'' he said.
   Dole said he had considered trying to amend Dodd's measure to
include a raise that would return Senate and House salaries to
parity, but acknowledged he lacked the votes to win its passage
this close to the November election.
   Dodd's amendment also would limit Senate members' earned outside
income to 15 percent of their salaries, a policy that the House
also adopted a year ago.

<TEXT>
   A defendant in the so-called Central Park jogger
trial testified Wednesday he never admitted to police that he took
part in a gang-rape and near-fatal beating.
   Testifying for the second day, Yusef Salaam, 16, admitted he was
in the park April 19, 1989, the night the female jogger was nearly
killed. But he said he never saw her.
   His testimony contradicted that of Detective Thomas McKenna.
McKenna last week said he tricked Salaam into admitting he had
attacked the jogger and others in the park. McKenna said he made
notes of those admissions.
   Salaam also denied that he saw his two codefendants, Antron
McCray, 16, and Raymond Santana, 15, in the park that night, and
denied he told McKenna most of the things in his notes.
   Salaam said he did tell McKenna that, on the day after the
rampage through the park, others told him people had been attacked
there the night before.
   Salaam, McCray and Santana are on trial on charges of attempted
murder, rape, sexual abuse, assault, robbery and riot for allegedly
attacking the woman and two male joggers. McCray and Santana
admitted taking part in the attack in videotape statements shown to
the jury; there is no videotape of Salaam.
   The defendants are being tried in an adult court, but if
convicted they will be sentenced as juvenile offenders to up to 10
years in prison.
   The jogger, nearly dead when found and suffering brain injuries,
underwent rehabilitation and has returned to Salomon Brothers Inc.
where she is a vice president in corporate finance. She still has
difficulty walking and does not remember the attack.
   Three other youths, Steven Lopez and Kevin Richardson, both 15,
and Kharey Wise, 17, are to stand trial on the same charges later
this year.
   On Tuesday, Salaam testified that he told detectives that he was
15 almost immediately when they came to his home to pick him up. It
is illegal for police to question anyone under 16 without a parent
present.
   Defense attorney Robert Burns says police knowingly questioned
Salaam illegally and therefore any alleged incriminating statements
by him should be discounted.
   On cross-examination, Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth
Lederer suggested Salaam was lying when he said he told police he
was 15.
   She suggested he knew he could be questioned alone if police
thought he was 16, and that he thought he could submit to
interrogation and return home without his mother finding out.
   He admitted he knew other teen-agers had been questioned by
police about the previous night's events and released, but he
denied telling police he was 16 and hoping to be questioned without
his mother knowing.

<HEAD>Intellectuals Call for Jailed Student Leader's Release</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN PETREANU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 100 Romanian intellectuals
appealed Wednesday for the release of jailed student leader Marian
Munteanu, and protesters gathered for the second straight day in a
downtown square to demand his freedom.
   The intellectuals' appeal, published in the independent daily
Romania Libera, said Munteanu's ``only crime was believing in
democracy.''
   Meanwhile, President Ion Iliescu issued a statement urging the
government ``to propose ways of eliminating tension and
confrontation ... and calming the political climate.''
   Iliescu, a former high-ranking Communist official who broke with
ousted dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, reiterated that he has
``completely disassociated'' himself from Communist ideology.
Iliescu and his National Salvation Front won May's multiparty
elections.
   He did not mention Munteanu and dozens of other government
opponents who have been jailed since mid-June.
   Munteanu was one of the primary leaders of a 53-day
anti-Communist rally in downtown University Square that blocked the
capital's main thoroughfare until it was violently broken up by
police in mid-June.
   Munteanu was badly beaten by pro-government miners who,
responding to an appeal for help from Iliescu, rampaged through the
capital for several days, beating intellectuals and others deemed
government opponents. Munteanu was hospitalized and then detained.
   The intellectuals' statement charged that Romania continues to
be ruled by Communists ``who have abandoned the ideology of
Communism but not its methods ... using terror and lies'' and
``hunting down intellectuals who oppose them.''
   The statement appealed for international support for the jailed
activists.
   Its signatories included expatriate playwright Eugene Ionesco,
honorary Writers' Union President Stefan Augustin Doinas, honorary
Romania Libera editor-in-chief Octavian Paler, and other members of
the opposition intellectual Group for Social Dialogue.
   Also Wednesday, several dozen protesters gathered in University
Square, where they roped off an area and declared it a
``Neo-Communist Free Zone.''
   Opposition activists use the term ``neo-Communist'' to refer to
Iliescu and other National Salvation Front members who belonged to
the now-disbanded Communist Party. The National Salvation Front
emerged during the December revolution that overthrew Ceausescu, a
Communist hard-liner.
   The protesters held a placard demanding the release of Munteanu
and other jailed government opponents.
   Several policemen looked on but did not interfere. On Tuesday, a
scuffle broke out between demonstrators and a police officer after
police tried to remove the ropes put up by the protesters.

<TEXT>
   A stockbroker who killed a client he
had defrauded and then fabricated clues to throw off police has
been sentenced to 40 years in prison.
   Frank A. Vandever, 36, fatally shot Ronald W. Hiiri in his
Stonington home in 1988, then created phony clues suggesting the
killing was connected to drugs and sex.
   Vandever, who pleaded guilty May 25, murdered Hiiri to prevent
him from reporting that Vandever had embezzled money from him, the
prosecution said.
   ``I am really and sincerely sorry, your honor,'' Vandever said
Tuesday before being sentenced by Superior Court Judge Joseph
Koletsky.
   Four days before the slaying, Vandever was fired from a New
Haven brokerage firm after company officials discovered he had
taken $43,000 from a woman's account and deposited it in his own
savings account, prosecutors said.
   Vandever had promised to make restitution and assured company
officials he had not embezzled money from any other clients. He
decided to kill Hiiri because he was worried Hiiri would report
that he, too, was missing money, said Assistant State's Attorney
Kevin T. Kane.
   He said Vandever once told a traveling companion he was writing
a book on the perfect murder.
   ``In some ways, this murder could have been perfect,'' Kane said.
   After shooting Hiiri, first in the back and then at point-blank
range in the heart, Vandever left newspapers and books around
Hiiri's house to make police believe he was a transvestite or
homosexual. Hiiri's wallet showed up in an area of Bridgeport known
for drug trafficking.
   Despite Vandever's efforts, he was immediately a suspect.
Hiiri's family knew he was to meet with his stockbroker the day he
was killed, and Vandever was videotaped by a suspicious jeweler
while trying to buy a ring with Hiiri's credit card.

Communists of `breach of trust.' No pickup</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk on
Wednesday accused Nelson Mandela's African National Congress of a
``breach of trust'' that has jeopardized black-white talks on
ending apartheid.
   De Klerk met Mandela for three hours in Pretoria and then issued
a strongly worded statement criticizing the ANC and its close ally,
the South African Communist Party.
   A dispute over official assertions that militants in both groups
are planning for an insurrection has eroded good will developed in
recent months between the government and the ANC. Mandela's group
is the leading black opposition movement.
   Earlier Wednesday, Mandela issued a conciliatory statement after
the talks with de Klerk. But de Klerk's remarks showed that deep
divisions persist over the alliance between the ANC and the
Communists.
   ``Statements and actions by prominent ANC members, as well as by
(Communist Party) members ... seriously jeopardize the continuation
of discussions aimed at the creation of a climate for
negotiation,'' de Klerk said in his statement Wednesday.
   The president said his meeting with Mandela took place in a
``constructive spirit.'' He said Aug. 6 talks between the
government and the ANC on ending white-minority rule would proceed
as planned.
   However, in accusing the ANC and Communists of a ``breach of
trust,'' he apparently referred to the recent police allegations
that militants from those organizations have been plotting to seize
power by force if negotiations break down.
   De Klerk said Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok would issue
statements about ``important information'' obtained by police and
the recent arrests of dozens of ANC and Communist Party members.
   In his earlier remarks Wednesday, Mandela had said, ``I am
positive that the talks on the 6th of August will go ahead in good
spirit.''
   Mandela said he told de Klerk that the ANC and the Communist
Party were committed to peaceful negotiations, not violent
revolution.
   He also indicated the two men had cleared up a
``misunderstanding'' about the presence of Communist Party leader
Joe Slovo on the ANC negotiating team.
   After a de Klerk-Mandela meeting last week, the ANC said the
government wanted Slovo dropped from the ANC delegation.
   ``I thought that the state president had demanded that Joe Slovo
be excluded from the delegation of the ANC,'' Mandela said.
   ``The correct position is that the state president was disturbed
by evidence placed before him,'' Mandela said in a reference to the
police allegations.
   The statement gave no indication that Slovo would be dropped
from the negotiating team.
   Slovo is one of several Communists who also hold top posts in
the ANC. Mandela is not a member of the Communist Party and says
the ANC is not a Communist organization, despite the
cross-membership.
   Mandela and Slovo appeared together at a Communist Party rally
on Sunday and again denied the existence of a plot to seize power.
However, ANC leaders have said that guerrillas will continue to
infiltrate the country until a cease-fire is negotiated with the
government.
   The ANC and the government held their first talks in May, three
months after de Klerk legalized the group and freed Mandela from a
life prison term for plotting against the government. Mandela,
deputy president of the ANC, had spent 27 years in prison.
   The talks Aug. 6 will be aimed at eliminating obstacles to
full-scale negotiations on a new constitution to give the black
majority a voice in national affairs.
   Before the ANC enters negotiations, it wants the government to
release prisoners convicted of political crimes and allow the
return without punishment of about 20,000 South African exiles.
   Under apartheid, the 5 million whites dominate politics and the
economy and the 30-million black majority has no voice in national
affairs.
   The ANC's guerrilla campaign, launched in 1961, has never posed
a serious threat to the government's powerful security forces. The
ANC has not carried out any major attacks in recent months.

   President Bush and congressional budget
negotiators appeared to abandon hope Wednesday of reaching a
deficit-cutting agreement before fall, setting the stage for
election-season finger-pointing over which side is to blame.
   Republicans suggested Bush would make a political issue of
Democratic refusal to offer detailed proposals for tax increases
and spending cuts.
   But House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif.,
countered, ``We didn't pledge that every time the Republicans slit
their wrists that we would slit ours.''
   He referred to an administration plan _ criticized even by
Republicans _ that includes higher taxes on alcohol and a limit on
deductibility of state tax payments.
   White House deputy press secretary Roman Popadiuk said Bush, in
a meeting with House and Senate Republicans, ``expressed his
concerns, frustration ... that the Democrats have not been able to
come up with a plan, details, that meet the ones that the
Republicans have already put together and are willing to put on the
table.''
   Bush plans to verbally attack Democrats during Congress' August
recess and to veto spending bills he considers too expensive, thus
leaving potentially huge automatic spending cuts in place this fall
until a budget deal is reached, according to White House officials
and Republican lawmakers who met with the president Wednesday.
   Bush is ``certainly not going to keep his trap shut all during
August,'' said House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill.
   But Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., said Republican plans to bash
Democrats for not offering a deficit-cutting plan would backfire.
He said the public realizes it is the president's responsibility to
offer a budget.
   ``The Republicans are going to look like a congregation of
jackasses,'' Dingell told reporters.
   With the start of the new fiscal year exactly two months away,
the White House adopted a carrot-and-stick approach to the
deadlocked, 12-week-old budget talks.
   Administration officials expressed optimism that the bargaining
_ aimed at paring next year's expected $169 billion budget gap _
will succeed after Congress' month-long recess.
   White House spokesman Popadiuk said that at a morning White
House meeting with 150 GOP House and Senate members, Bush ``stated
his expectation that the talks will intensify in September.''
   And House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said Democrats and
White House officials have ``an agreement in principle'' to work
out a schedule for completing an agreement in September.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said negotiators were considering
that when talks resume they would be in seclusion ``where we can
work together without interruption.'' One location mentioned was a
plantation on Maryland's Eastern Shore, he said.
   But at the same time, Bush appeared ready to adopt tougher
tactics. The Gramm-Rudman law will trigger more than $100 billion
in spending cuts on Oct. 1 _ a process known as sequester _ unless
a deal emerges.
   ``The sequester is a reality he will enforce if no agreement is
reached,'' Popadiuk said of Bush.
   Even so, the administration emitted different signals about just
how tough Bush planned to be. White House officials initially said
Bush was giving Democrats until Friday to make a budget offer, a
statement that was echoed by Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., the No. 2
House Republican.
   But shortly afterward, Popadiuk said, ``The president didn't
impose any deadlines.''
   Republican lawmakers clearly remained angry over the political
embarrassment they have faced ever since details of the
administration's $54 billion package of spending cuts and tax
increases emerged last week.
   Included in the plan are higher taxes on alcohol and a reduction
in the deductibility of state and local income taxes _ both of
which have drawn GOP fire.
   ``You can assume that when the GOP lawmakers go home they won't
be shy about the foot-dragging we've seen by the Democrats about
finding a credible solution to the budget deficit,'' said White
House spokeswoman Alixe Glen.
   But Democrats argued that a month of partisan warfare would
accomplish little.
   ``If we want to beat each other around politically, we're not
going to come to an agreement, and the public will take it out on
both of us,'' said Panetta.
   Panetta expressed a willingness to give the Republicans a
Democratic budget plan as soon as the GOP produced a complete
proposal of its own. The Republicans have never formally submitted
their plan to Democrats, though details have been described in
published reports.
   But other Democrats expressed no willingness to publicize their
own deficit-cutting ideas shortly before the August break. Their
fear is that it would make them a target of the same pummeling the
GOP plan is now taking.
   ``I don't think it's generally helpful,'' Foley said of
immediately producing a Democratic package.
   The maneuvering of the negotiators has begun to wear thin on at
least some rank-and-file members of Congress.
   ``I have news for you summiteers, both Republican and
Democrat,'' Rep. Robin Tallon, D-S.C., said on the House floor.
``The rest of America thinks you're acting like a bunch of
children.''

<HEAD>Two Cosmonauts Launched to Replace Crew in Mir</HEAD>

   Two cosmonauts soared into space Wednesday on a
mission to continue the manufacture of ultra-pure crystals for
profit in what has become the centerpiece of the Soviet space
program.
   A Soyuz TM-10 capsule carrying flight commander Gennady Manakov
and engineer Gennady Strekalov rose into a hazy sky atop a column
of orange and white flames from the Baikonur Space Center in
Kazakhstan.
   The capsule blasted off as scheduled at 1:32 p.m.
   Watching the launch in the 109-degree heat were two Japanese
broadcasters, one of whom will be a paying passenger on a Dec. 2
mission that could bring the Soviet space program an estimated $16
million.
   On Friday, Manakov and Strekalov will rendezvous with the Mir
space station to replace Anatoly Solovyev and Alexander Balandin,
cosmonauts who have been working in orbit since Feb. 11.
   During their 4{-month mission, Manakov and Strekalov will
continue the work Solovyev and Balandin began: ``growing''
super-pure crystals for use in semiconductors and computer chips.
   The program is designed to bring profits of more than $40
million.
   Solovyev and Balandin, who return to Earth on Aug. 9, grew 23
such crystals in the weightlessness of space using the special
Kristall module attached to the Mir complex. Each is worth about $1
million, the Tass news agency reported.
   Producing such crystals and other space manufacturing ``is
clearly the centerpiece'' of the Soviet space program, said James
Oberg, author of several books on the Soviet space program, in an
interview from his Texas home.
   ``It's the key to their commercialization of space,'' he said.
   Such importance is given to the crystals, Oberg said, that the
past two Soyuz flights to the Mir have had only two cosmonauts
aboard so the canister of crystals could ride home in the capsule's
empty third seat.
   Starting in December and continuing into 1992, however, the
third seat will be occupied by foreign passengers paying the
Soviets hard currency, perhaps as much as $16 million, Oberg said.
   Sitting in the Soyuz capsule's third seat in December will be
either Tokyo Broadcasting System camerawoman Ryoko Kikuchi, 26, or
Toyohiro Akiyama, 48, the former Washington bureau chief for the
network. The Japanese chosen will spend eight days in space, Tass
said.
   The launch of the seventh main mission to the Mir was not
broadcast live on Soviet television, as previous launches have
been. A taped report was shown two hours later.
   Before the cosmonauts got into a bus that took them to the
launch pad, Manakov saluted Vladimir Ivanov, chairman of the state
commission on spaceflight, and said: ``The crew of the spaceship is
ready for the flight.''
   ``I wish you a successful flight and happy return to the native
land,'' replied Ivanov.
   When the cosmonauts reached the launch pad, each was kissed on
the cheek by an unidentified man wearing a military uniform. In a
brief exchange with journalists, Manakov, 40, wisecracked that
``the older one'' _ meaning 49-year-old Strekalov _ would be
filling them in on the mission's progress in space.
   A journalist shouted a traditional Russian colloquial expression
for luck before a risky venture: ``Neither feathers nor fluff!''
and a smiling Manakov gave the appropriate response: ``To hell with
you!''
   Manakov, a test pilot, is making his first space flight.
Strekalov is a veteran cosmonaut on his fourth flight, having
worked aboard the Salyut space station.
   Tass said they are expected to make at least two spacewalks,
during which they will conduct further unspecified repairs to a
hatch on the Kvant-2 module attached to the Mir complex.
   During a July 17 excursion outside the space station to repair
torn thermal insulation on their Soyuz TM-9 capsule, Solovyev and
Balandin discovered they could not close a hatch at the end of
their space walk. They were, however, able to close it on a
subsequent, July 26 space walk.

   The House Foreign Affairs Committee approved
on Wednesday new restrictions on trade with Iraq, as Democrats on
the panel chastised President Bush for not taking such action on
his own.
   The legislation, approved on a voice vote without dissent, calls
for an end to the $200 million line of credit Iraq now enjoys
through the Export-Import Bank and for U.S. opposition to loans
from international institutions like the World Bank.
   It also would require that any U.S. exporter wishing to sell
items to Iraq first prove that they will not be used for any
program to develop chemical or biological weapons or ballistic
missiles, or enhance Iraq's ability to support terrorism.
   The bill's author, Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., said the United
States must register its disapproval of human rights violations by
Iraq and the belligerent rhetoric of its president, Saddam Hussein.
Iraq has massed 100,000 troops on its border with Kuwait in a
dispute over oil production.
   ``The lesson of Iraq is clear,'' Berman said. ``You win nothing
by appeasing a bully. He merely becomes a bolder and more dangerous
bully.''
   A day earlier, assistant Secretary of State John Kelly testified
before a House subcommittee that the administration is developing
new curbs on so-called ``dual use'' exports, goods like computers
and aircraft parts that can have either a civilian or military
purpose.
   But Berman said his legislation goes farther because it puts the
burden on exporters to show that their products will not be used in
weapons programs.
   ``I regret that the administration has long been unwilling to
take a stance and consider sanctions,'' Berman said.
   And Rep. William Broomfield of Michigan, the panel's senior
Republican, said he hoped the committee action would spur the
administration to complete its review of policy toward Iraq and
``recommend a policy we all can support.''
   The action came after the near-sale to Iraq last month of
industrial furnaces that could be used to make nuclear weapons
material. The sale was aborted by the White House at the last
minute.
   Documents obtained by The Associated Press show that officials
at the Commerce Department who had previously approved the sale
knew that the furnaces had a potential nuclear use.
   The documents are the minutes of the department's discussions in
1989 with Consarc Corp., the Rancocas, N.J.,-based furnace
manufacturer.
   They show that officials of the company that made the furnaces,
Consarc Corp. of Rancocas, N.J., held a meeting on Feb. 22, 1989
with Alan C. Stoddart, a special agent from Commerce's Office of
Export Enforcement.
   ``Mr. Stoddart said the department's main concern is nuclear
non-proliferation,'' according to the minutes of the meeting with
Consarc's president, Raymond Roberts, and Tina Olnick, a company
employee.
   The minutes continued: ``Mr. Roberts again stated that the
customer tells us they will be making titanium castings for making
medical prostheses.
   ``However, the equipment can be used (without modification) on
zirconium, for which the principal end use is nuclear.''
   In an earlier Feb. 15, 1989, conversation, Roberts told Jeff
Tripp of the Commerce Department that ``there is nothing to stop
them (the Iraqis) from melting zirconium, the main use of which is
cladding material for nuclear fuel.''
   Gary Milhollin, executive director of the Wisconsin Project on
Nuclear Arms Control, said the high-performance furnaces such as
the ones Iraq sought can be used for a number of purposes,
including melting plutonium for bomb cores and titanium for missile
nose cones.
   The Iraqis said the titanium, a lightweight metal, would be used
for artificial hip and knee joints for victims of the Persian Gulf
war with Iran.
   On March 15, 1989, Ms. Olnick, Consarc's contract administrator,
asked the Commerce Department whether the company needed a
``validated export license'' to ship the furnaces.
   Such a license is generally needed to export items that would
appear to have a direct nuclear capability.
   In the letter, Ms. Olnick said Consarc did not believe a
validated license was necessary but, ``We would appreciate an
assessment of the Department of Commerce.''
   She added: ``We have informed the customer that we will not
proceed with the project until we have received approval to export
the equipment in either the form of an assessment that an export
license is not required or an approved export license.''
   Roberts did not return a telephone call Wednesday to discuss the
documents, but he said earlier his company had received permission
to ship furnaces to Iraq. Ms. Olnick said she could not talk about
the matter.
   Commerce Department officials have refused to talk about the
Consarc case.
   But after a furnace was seized by the Customs Service on a dock
in Philadelphia last month, U.S. officials said Consarc would be
required to obtain a validated license. It is unlikely such a
license will be granted, they said.

   Marguerite Martin, like a lot of other
business executives, has a passion for golf.
   But she has a problem. She works during the week, and her club,
the Longmeadow Country Club, has a rule banning women from the
course on weekend mornings.
   So Ms. Martin filed a complaint with the Massachusetts
Commission Against Discrimination.
   ``Most country clubs discriminate against women and restrict
when they can play,'' Ms. Martin said Wednesday. ``As hard as it is
to understand, it's really very simple. To many men, golf isn't a
game. It's a disease that doesn't incorporate women.''
   Ms. Martin, who launched her own financial management firm after
retiring from the insurance business, said she smarted under the
Longmeadow Country Club's restrictions for 25 years. She filed the
complaint only after trying unsuccessfully for six years to get the
club's Board of Governors to ease its restrictions on women.
   ``As a younger woman you rationalize that making a squawk could
hurt your business and back off,'' she said. ``I'm 65. I've lived a
good life and gotten though a lot of different types of
discrimination. At this time in my life I have to face up to facts.
And the fact is that I can't stand this any longer.''
   Donald R. Dupre, president of the 350-member club, was on
vacation and could not be reached for comment on the complaint,
which was filed last month. Two other officers, Vice President John
M. Naughton and Secretary Norman J. Van Tassel, declined comment on
the action.
   Ms. Martin suggested that the rules stemmed from the country
club's beginnings in 1922 when most women did not work outside the
home and could more easily golf on weekdays.
   ``Most of the women in the Longmeadow Club still fall into that
category,'' she said. ``And in truth when you get beyond the
hysteria there would probably be only a couple of women who would
play on Saturday mornings and it wouldn't bother anybody.''
   Alan Cassella, a compliance officer for the discrimination
commission, said her complaint was filed under a section of the law
covering private organizations that solicit the patronage of the
general public.
   Earlier this year in Hermitage, Pa., protests led officials at
the Hickory VFW Golf Course to roll back a rule requiring women to
wait until 11 a.m. to tee off.

   Chairman John E. Frohnmayer of the National
Endowment for the Arts says he might appoint local panels to help
determine whether federally financed works of art violate community
anti-obscenity standards.
   Frohnmayer said the need for such a move had never arisen
because an NEA grant had never been denied or challenged under the
congressional ban on federal support for works that might be
considered obscene.
   ``If we were required to at some point determine local
standards, that's how we would go about it, or that is one of the
ways one might go about it,'' he said.
   The NEA chairman expressed his views during a three-hour
deposition taken Tuesday by New York lawyer Floyd Abrams, who is
representing the New School for Social Research in a lawsuit
against the endowment. A transcript of the 100-page deposition was
released Wednesday.
   The New School is challenging the endowment's requirement that
grant recipients sign a pledge they will not use federal funds to
create obscene art. The lawsuit charges that the pledge is
unconstitutionally vague and violates guarantees of free speech and
due process.
   The New School's application for a $45,000 grant to redesign its
main courtyard in New York was approved by the endowment last March.
   But when informed of the NEA's anti-obscenity restrictions, New
School president Jonathan F. Fanton wrote Frohnmayer that the
university could not accept the endowment grant ``under a condition
that undermines our society's deep commitment to intellectual and
artistic freedom.''
   Frohnmayer responded in a May 2 letter to Fanton which expressed
``severe questions about the constitutionality of the law.''
   Frohnmayer's deposition will be used by Abrams, a noted First
Amendment lawyer, when the case is heard before U.S. District Judge
Louis Stanton in Manhattan on Aug. 13.
   The NEA chairman's proposal to appoint local panels to judge
whether endowment-supported works might be obscene follows a
formula prescribed by the Supreme Court in its landmark 1973
obscenity ruling.
   The high court said determinations of obscenity must take into
account ``contemporary community standards.'' The court said works
may be considered obscene if they depict sex in a patently
offensive way, appeal to the prurient interest and lack serious
literary, artistic, political or scientific value.
   Under questioning by Abrams, Frohnmayer said he might find it
necessary to consider ``impaneling a group within a locality in
which that grant was going to take place to advise the endowment on
community standards.''
   But so far, he said, ``we have not been confronted with that
issue because ... there has been no grant that has been denied or
challenged under this statute.''
   He denied that the endowment had rejected any grant application
on the grounds that it was ``considered too controversial or
troublesome,'' since the anti-obscenity ban was imposed by Congress
last October.
   The NEA was plunged into controversy more than a year ago when
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and other political and religious
conservatives criticized endowment support for exhibitions of
controversial works by photographer Robert Mapplethorpe and artist
Andres Serrano.
   At Helms' urging, Congress amended the endowment's current $171
million budget to include a ban on using federal funds for artworks
that include ``depictions of sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the
sexual exploitation of children or individuals engaged in sex acts,
and which, when taken as a whole, do not have serious literary,
artistic, political or scientific works.''

   The Drug Enforcement Administration suggested
Wednesday that murder charges filed in the Philippines against
three U.S. agents could have been intended to prevent them from
testifying about drug trafficking by Filipino military officials.
   DEA spokesman Cornelius Dougherty said the agency had been
invited to testify before a commission formed by Philippines
President Corazon Aquino to investigate allegations of drug
trafficking by members of her armed forces.
   Andrew Fenrich, the head of the DEA's two-man office in the
Philippines, had planned to testify until the charges were filed
Wednesday, Dougherty said.
   The charges ``rather effectively put the kibosh on any testimony
about the facts concerning the armed forces,'' Dougherty said.
   ``I'm suggesting there's probably a cause-and-effect situation
there,'' he added.
   Fenrich was one of three DEA agents and 13 Filipino policemen
charged Wednesday by the Philippines' military in the July 10
killings of two officers and a soldier during what police said was
a shootout during a drug bust last month.
   According to the National Bureau of Investigation, the soldiers
tried to sell $10 million worth of heroin to Needham, who was
posing as a buyer. Shooting broke out when the three resisted
arrest, the bureau claims.
   But Brig. Gen. Gerardo Flores, chief of staff of the Philippine
Constabulary, said his investigation showed the three were shot in
the head at close range.
   ``We're cooperating with the Philippine government on this
situation,'' said Joe Keefe, another DEA spokesman. However, he
noted that there are no plans to return the three DEA agents to
that country to face the murder charges. The United States and the
Philippines do not have an extradition treaty.
   The DEA is deciding whether to submit testimony to the
commission in writing or whether depositions will be taken outside
the Philippines and sent to the panel, Dougherty said.
   Acting DEA Administrator Terrence Burke rejected the allegations
of murder, saying in a statement: ``These charges have no merit.''
   The Philippines government allows DEA agents to carry firearms,
Keefe said, but he added, ``None of the weapons was fired on that
day.''
   Two DEA agents are normally assigned to the Philippines, but
Fenrich and his colleague Jake Fernandez were taken out of the
country because of the July 10 events and no agents have been
assigned to replace them, Keefe said. The third agent, Philip
Needham, was from the DEA's Bangkok office,
   ``We would like to emphasize that the DEA agents were working at
the request of the Philippines government in cooperation with the
National Bureau of Investigation,'' Keefe said.
   The DEA is in the Philippines ``as guests of the host
government. We work under the conditions of that government that
allows what we can do and can't do,'' Keefe said.
   The Philippines is considered a trans-shipment point for heroin
as well as a new form of methamphetamine called ice, and it is a
source country for marijuana, he said.

   The price of the best bargain in town doubled
Wednesday. The roundtrip fare on the Staten Island ferry jumped to
50 cents.
   ``It's worth 50 cents. I think it's a romantic ride,'' said
Staten Island resident Stanley Harrington, one of the ferry's
75,000 daily commuters. ``This is the best ride ... (of) all the
transit operations in New York.''
   The half-hour excursion across busy New York Harbor connects
Staten Island and the southern tip of Manhattan, passing in front
of the Statue of Liberty.
   It was only the second time the city has raised the fare since
taking the ferry over from the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad in 1905 _
when the trip cost five cents each way. In 1975, the fare went up
to a quarter for a round trip, paid in Manhattan.
   The city estimates the fare increase will bring in an extra $2.6
million in revenues. Each round trip costs the city $3.48 per
passenger, said Department of Transportation spokesman Joe DePlasco.
   The cost of ferrying a car remains $1.75 each way. The driver
and any passengers each pay the 50-cent round trip fare.

<HEAD>FCC Proposing Easing Amateur Radio License Rules For Handicapped</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission on
Wednesday proposed to make it easier for handicapped people to gain
advanced amateur radio licenses.
   The commission, by a 5-0 vote, proposed that examiners be able
to exempt mentally or physically impaired individuals who have
``extraordinary difficulty'' in passing high-speed Morse code
telegraphy proficiency tests.
   Currently, amateur licensees must pass a written exam and
demonstrate proficiency of five words per minute in Morse code in
order to gain a novice or technician's license; 13 wpm for the
general or advanced classes; and 20 wpm for the amateur extra class.
   The FCC proposed that applicants for higher classes could be
exempted from the 13 wpm or 20 wpm exams if they have a doctor's
certificate stating they cannot pass the telegraphy exams and if
they hold a current or renewable novice, technician, general or
advanced class operator's license.
   International radio rules require a proficiency of 5 wpm or more.
   In other 5-0 votes Wednesday, the FCC:
   _Proposed establishing standards for conducting comparative
renewal proceedings between cellular radio licensees and license
challengers when existing lottery-awarded licenses begin to expire
in 1993. The commission proposed weighting the process in favor of
incumbents in the booming, $3 billion cellular business.
   _Opened an inquiry into setting standards for the possible
introduction of digital audio radio services, which would provide a
compact disc quality sound better than today's AM and FM
broadcasts. Three applications are pending for such service.
   _Extended its inquiry into possible changes in rules governing
so-called television satellite stations, which rebroadcast to small
communities all or most of the programming of a parent station.

<HEAD>Police Block Albanians Seeking Visas at U.S. Embassy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOURMELON, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security forces Wednesday blocked about
90 Albanian refugees who wanted to march on the U.S. Embassy in
Paris to demand permission to go to the United States.
   Carrying personal belongings in plastic bags, the Albanians
marched from the military camp at Mourmelon where they have been
staying since arriving in France two weeks ago.
   ``We never had the intention of staying here,'' said one
refugee, a 32-year-old who identified himself only as Arden.
   ``We've already been in France too long. We've asked, in vain,
that a representative of the United States come see us,'' he said.
``Now, we're going to Paris.''
   The refugees were among 543 Albanians who arrived in France by
ferry July 15 after occupying embassies in the Albanian capital of
Tirana. Thousands more went to Italy, West Germany and other
nations.
   The refugees who marched Wednesday included about 20 women and a
handful of children. They had hoped to walk 12 miles to the town of
Chalons-sur-Marne, 90 miles east of Paris, and board a train to the
capital.
   But they were stopped after about four miles by soldiers from
the military camp and about 15 police officers.
   The soldiers passed out mineral water to the refugees under the
crushing mid-afternoon sun as Daniel Rouhier, a local official,
explained that the Albanians could not expect to emigrate just by
marching to the U.S. Embassy off the Champs-Elysees.
   The refugees eventually boarded military buses and returned to
the camp. Rouhier said they will be moved from the camp by Aug. 15
to other shelters around France.
   About 230 refugees are staying at the Mourmelon camp.
   ``To my knowledge, none of these particular Albanians has
applied for a visa,'' said U.S. Embassy spokesman Paul Kozelka in
Paris. ``If they marched up to the gates, I guess we'd hand out
application forms.''
   He said U.S. officials have received no request through French
officials to meet with the Albanians.
   Washington would likely grant visas to Albanians with immediate
family members in the United States or to those who have studied
there or worked for the U.S. government, Kozelka said.
   The refugees who arrived in France last month have been housed
at three camps near Paris and two in the southwest. There, they are
supposed to learn French, undergo medical tests and adjust to
Western life.

<HEAD>Alleged Mexican Cult Priestess Given Six-Year Term</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The alleged high priestess of a
drug-trafficking cult accused of sacrificing 15 people, including a
University of Texas student, was sentenced to six years in prison
for criminal association, her attorney said Wednesday.
   Attorney Victor Fernandez Perez Salas said the six-year sentence
imposed Tuesday against Sara Aldrete Villareal was the maximum
allowed by law.
   Peres said the defense team would appeal the sentencing by Judge
Bernardo Tirado.
   Miss Aldrete, a former honor student at Texas Southmost College
in Brownsville, is one of 10 people still facing charges involving
a cult of drug traffickers that alleged sacrificed 15 people near
Matamoros, a Mexican city on the U.S. border. Mark Kilroy, 21, of
the University of Texas, was among those slain.
   Authorities began finding bodies in April 1989.
   Prosecutors claim Miss Aldrete was the high priestess of the
cult led by Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, who allegedly told his
followers that human sacrifices would give them immunity from
police.
   Miss Aldrete has admitted knowing Constanzo, but denies all
involvement in smuggling, murder or witchcraft.
   Last month, Tirado dismissed charges against Miss Alderete of
homicide, concealment and resisting arrest. The charges were filed
in Mexico City.
   Those charges stemmed from the May 6, 1989, shootout with police
in which Constanzo and a bodyguard died. Police said they either
committed suicide or were killed by followers as part of a pact to
avoid falling into police custody.

   Rural development councils will be started in
eight states this summer as forerunners of a nationwide project to
boost development in rural America, Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter said Wednesday.
   The councils will be started in Kansas, Maine, Mississippi,
Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas and Washington, he said.
   Existing resources will be used to form the councils, which will
have fulltime coordinators, he said. A goal will be to form
state-level partnerships between federal and state governments and
the private sector.
   ``The participants will create a long-term strategy for applying
federal rural development resources and will carry out joint
actions to implement the strategy,'' Yeutter said.
   Councils will be made up of federal officials representing
various departments and agencies that have significant rural
development roles. Such agencies would include the Extension
Service and the Farmers Home Administration, for example.

<HEAD>Board Rejects Mass Murderer Juan Corona's Third Bid For Parole</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELISABETH DUNHAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SOLEDAD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twice-convicted mass murderer Juan
Corona's third bid for freedom was rejected Wednesday after he told
a parole board he doesn't remember committing 25 brutal machete
slayings almost 20 years ago.
   ``Few crimes in the history of the United States have been as
shocking to the public conscience,'' said Ron Koenig, chairman of
the state Board of Prison Terms panel, in announcing the decision.
   A psychological report prepared for the board said Corona, 56,
didn't appear to understand the motive for his crimes and
``therefore remains a danger to society.''
   The report, said Koenig, indicates Corona ``seems to be living
in a world of his own and is extremely dangerous in an unstructured
environment.''
   Sutter County District Attorney Carl Adams told the panel the
report makes clear that ``Mr. Corona is unpredictable and presents
an unknown threat if released.''
   Corona's lawyer had previously suggested the Corona would use
the hearing to take responsibility for the killings for the first
time.
   He was convicted of 25 murder counts for hacking, slashing and
clubbing farm laborers to death in 1971 and burying their bodies in
Sutter County orchards about 125 miles northeast of San Francisco.
   Last week, attorney Don Condren told The Associated Press his
client might be planning to admit his role in the case. Corona has
been criticized at past hearings for declining to speak in his own
behalf.
   Lately, Corona has ``indicated he is going to be willing to talk
about it,'' Condren said in an interview from his home, while
warning his client still might change his mind.
   On Wednesday, when asked if he planned to confess, Corona said
simply, ``No, I don't remember.''
   Koenig asked Corona how it felt ``to be convicted of something
you say you did not do.''
   ``Very bad,'' Corona said.
   When the murders occurred, they were the worst mass slaying in
U.S. history.
   John Wayne Gacy Jr., on death row in Illinois, was convicted of
more murders than anyone in the nation's history. He was sentenced
to death for the murder of 33 young men and boys in 1980.
   All but one of the corpses had the heads chopped open. A search
of Corona's home turned up a machete with an 18-inch blade, a meat
cleaver, a double-bladed ax and a wooden club.
   Corona, a farm labor contractor who preyed on itinerant workers
and derelicts, was first convicted in 1973. The conviction was
overturned five years later when an appellate court ruled his
defense had been inadequate.
   The second trial, in 1982, also ended in conviction at a cost of
$5 million. His defense was based on a denial of his guilt and an
attempt to blame the killings on a half-brother, now dead. Corona
is serving 25 years to life on each murder count.

   Israeli officials warmly greeted the wife of
convicted spy Jonathan Pollard as she arrived Wednesday on a
10-week parole from a U.S. prison to seek medical treatment in
Israel.
   Anne Henderson Pollard, wearing a brown checked suit and
clutching a bouquet of flowers at Ben Gurion airport, appeared pale
and tired as she thanked Israelis who supported her while she was
serving 2{ years in a U.S. prison.
   Authorities told her to maintain a low profile while in Israel.
But the plight of the Pollards has touched some Israelis, who have
established the Public Committee for the Pollards to work for their
release.
   Committee chairman Amnon Dror said Wednesday, ``We think that a
state which endangered a man who had helped them cannot abandon him
when he gets caught.''
   Deputy Minister Geula Cohen of the right-wing Tehiya Party and
Edna Solodar, a legislator from the left-of-center Labor Party,
were among those welcoming her.
   Ms. Pollard, 30, was arrested with her husband Jonathan, a
36-year-old former U.S. Navy analyst, in November 1985 on suspicion
of spying for Israel.
   He was sentenced to life in prison in June 1987 after he pleaded
guilty to providing Israel with documents about the military
strengths of countries in the Middle East.
   Ms. Pollard pleaded guilty to conspiracy to receive embezzled
government property and being an accessory to possession of
national defense doucments. She was sentenced to five years in
prison and was released this year.
   Israeli leaders said the Pollards were part of an unauthorized
renegade spy ring and refused to help them, despite their pleas.
   Jonathan Pollard, who is in solitary confinement in a maximum
security federal prison in Marion, Ill. filed for divorce last
month citing ``irreconcilable differences.''
   Ms. Pollard, who is suffering from a gastrointestinal disorder,
said she hoped her marriage would be salvaged.
   She was taken to Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, where she will
receive treatment at no cost.
   ``I am glad to be here in my natural homeland. I thank you from
the bottom of my heart for your emotional support over all these
years,'' Ms. Pollard said in a short statement at the airport.
   ``Our history teaches us to learn from tragedy and to look for a
brighter future. I hope the day will come when both my husband and
I will be free and back here in Israel.''

<HEAD>Likud Nearly Toppled From Power By Oversight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Israeli Communist Party nearly toppled
Israel's governing coalition Wednesday on a technicality of
parliamentary rules.
   It took an impromptu filibuster and a scurry by hall messengers
to save Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing governing
coalition.
   The vote was called unexpectedly by the Communists to protest
budget cuts that slashed basic food subsidies.
   Once the motion was read and the house speaker stood up to begin
the vote, Likud legislators realized they were a minority in the
room and liable to lose.
   The 6-week-old coalition commands only a narrow majority in the
120-member Parliament, and many of its supporters were absent.
   ``They simply didn't notice that a vote was going to be taken so
early,'' one parliamentary aide said on condition of anonymity.
   Hall monitors were sent running to get absent legislators from
the Parliament dining rooms. Then, to delay the vote, Finance
Minister Yitzhak Modai of Likud got up to make an unscheduled
speech in defense of his budget, witnesses said.
   When the vote was taken 10 minutes later, Shamir survived
comfortably by a 63 to 48 showing, with seven absent and two
abstentions.
   Shamir's coalition government also easily defeated four other
no-confidence motions that came to a vote later Wednesday.
   Those left-wing motions were to protest the government's
handling of a housing shortage fueled by an influx of Soviet
immigrants. More than 2,000 Israeli families, many evicted from
apartments after rents were raised, have pitched tent camps in
parks around the country in the past month.
   It is the second time Shamir has faced no-confidence measures
since his Cabinet was installed on June 11.

   The Social Security Administration said
Wednesday it has obtained the money needed to permit a full
schedule of hearings on disability benefit appeals this fall and
has cancelled plans to curtail some of them.
   The agency said the Office of Management and Budget has agreed
to release about $5 million from a contingency fund to pay for all
of the approximately 20,000 appeals hearings conducted each month.
   The hearings are held for people appealing decisions to deny or
reduce Social Security disability benefits.
   The Social Security Administration had said Tuesday it would
schedule no new hearings involving expenses for travel or for
medical or occupational experts for the rest of the fiscal year,
which ends September 30.
   Gwendolyn S. King, the commissioner of Social Security, said no
hearings would have been cancelled.
   But she said she was ``disturbed at the unnecessary alarm that
has been generated among some of the nation's most vulnerable
citizens'' because of incorrect reports that all appeals hearings
had been suspended.
   ``Today's action should serve to once again assure the nearly 40
million Americans who receive Social Security benefits that this
agency ... will continue to serve the public with great measures of
both responsibility and compassion,'' she said.

   A judge pounded the final gavel in
the McMartin preschool case Wednesday, dismissing child molestation
charges in the nation's longest, costliest criminal prosecution.
   Defendant Raymond Buckey promptly filed a multimillion dollar
malicious prosecution suit.
   ``The case of the People vs. Raymond Buckey is hereby dismissed
and the defendant is discharged,'' said Los Angeles County Superior
Court Judge Stanley Weisberg. ``That completes this case.''
   The ruling came after jurors deadlocked Friday in Buckey's
retrial on eight charges and the judge declared a mistrial.
   Later Wednesday, Buckey and his civil attorney summoned
reporters to Beverly Hills to annouce the suit against Los Angeles
County, the city of Manhattan Beach and a former district attorney.
Also named were a therapist and therapy center that elicited
damaging testimony from children, and KABC-TV and its reporter
Wayne Satz, who carried many early stories about the case.
   Buckey said he wanted to recoup some of the money his family
lost in fighting the marathon case.
   ``What else can I do?'' asked Buckey. ``Do we just walk out of
the criminal system and they're not even going to say they're
sorry? Money is something that hopefully can get my family back
together.''
   The suit, filed in Superior Court in Los Angeles, claims
malicious prosecution, conspiracy and defamation, as well as
violation of Buckey's civil rights. Buckey's mother, who was a
defendant, filed a separate suit in federal court after her
acquittal in January.
   The district attorney's office sought the dismissal of charges,
and prosecutor Joseph Martinez said he thought it was ``for the
best'' to end the seven-year ordeal that had shattered lives and
strained the legal system.
   ``We can't change the evidence,'' Martinez said. ``There were
two juries, objective people who felt there wasn't the evidence to
convict.''
   The McMartin case consumed seven years of court time and cost
Los Angeles County more than $13.5 million, making it the longest,
most expensive criminal court case in U.S. history.
   ``He's a free man,'' Buckey's attorney, Danny Davis, said as he
emerged from the last court hearing in the criminal case. ``Please
treat my client as not only a free man but an innocent man.''
   He stressed that Buckey, like other defendants, was presumed
innocent unless convicted, and that Buckey was convicted of nothing.
   ``This man spent five years in jail, seven years of his life,''
Davis said. ``He is a symbol of the presumption of innocence.''
   The attorney likened his client to Rocky Balboa, the boxing hero
of the movie ``Rocky.''
   ``He's a young man who went through a test and came out a hero
at the end,'' he said. ``He slayed his dragon.''
   Buckey said the case seemed to last ``a lifetime'' but made him
a stronger person. ``I now know how deep I can go into my soul.
I've been there and survived.
   ``I feel scarred by this case and I need to heal,'' Buckey said.
He added he now feels in control of his life. ``I no longer have 12
jurors deciding my fate. I'm deciding it.''
   Buckey's mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, was in court for the
dismissal along with his sister, Peggy Ann. Both women were former
defendants.
   ``I still can't believe it,'' said Mrs. Buckey, who was
acquitted of all charges against her. ``We've been through seven
years of hell and it still hasn't hit me _ it's over.''
   The case started with dozens of molestation charges and seven
defendants, but only Buckey and his mother ever stood trial.
Charges against five other teachers or employees at the Manhattan
Beach preschool were dismissed for lack of evidence.
   When the first trial ended Jan. 18, Buckey's mother was
acquitted on all counts and Buckey was acquitted on 40 counts. The
jury deadlocked on 13 counts and Buckey was retried on eight.
   Buckey spent five years in jail, before being released on bail.
He took the witness stand at both trials to deny he ever molested
any child.

<HEAD>Roseanne Barr's Ratings Drop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tuesday's rerun of a ``Roseanne'' episode _ the
first since Roseanne Barr's screeched version of the national
anthem _ had an 11 percent smaller audience than the show did the
previous week.
   An ABC executive blamed the drop of nearly 1.5 million homes
more on strong CBS competition than to viewer reaction to the
star's national anthem antics at a San Diego Padres game last week.
   ``I think it has more to do with the CBS movie doing a 22
(audience) share share ... than a backlash against Roseanne,''
Larry Hyams, ABC's director of prime-time audience research, said
after the ratings were released Wednesday.
   The national Nielsen ratings for NBC's competing ``In the Heat
of the Night'' also were down from the previous Tuesday, he said.
   Barr's antics, in which she also grabbed at her crotch and spit
on the ground, drew the wrath of baseball fans and President Bush
alike.
   Her Tuesday show averaged a 13.0 rating, down from last
Tuesday's 14.6. Still, that was enough for the show to win its
half-hour time period against other reruns on second-place CBS and
third-place NBC.
   CBS' repeat of a the second part of its 1987 miniseries,
``Murder Ordained,'' averaged an 11.4 rating against ``Roseanne.''
NBC's ``In the Head of the Night'' had a 9.6. Each ratings point
represents 921,000 homes.

   Marion Barry has occasionally used cocaine,
his lawyer admitted Wednesday during dramatic closing arguments in
the mayor's drug and perjury trial. But he argued against
conviction, saying prosecutors had not proved Barry used drugs at
the specific times charged.
   The prosecution portrayed a far different Barry, calling him a
general in the war on drugs who betrayed the cause and ``was
working with the other side.''
   The evidence is ``overwhelming'' that Barry relied on friends
who brought him cocaine because they wanted city jobs, city
contracts and the power that comes with knowing the mayor, said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith Retchin.
   Barry's lawyer accused federal authorities of usin the
equivalent of an illegal war weapon to catch him in the act of
smoking crack cocaine in an FBI operation at a downtown hotel.
   ``The danger of mustard gas _ which was the sting at the Vista _
is that it cuts at the very fabric of our society,'' said lawyer R.
Kenneth Mundy. ``It might be Mr. Barry today, someone else
tomorrow.''
   ``We do not intend to give you the impression for one moment
that there was not occasional drug use by Mr. Barry,'' Mundy said.
But he added that ``that's not what the case is about. ... He's
being tried for specific instances of alleged misconduct.''
   After court adjourned for the day, Mundy said he made the
admission to show jurors ``the honesty of the defense, the
intelligence of the defense.'' Mundy will continue his closing
argument Thursday.
   Prosecutor Retchin, summarizing six weeks of trial testimony,
told the jury that Barry used drugs in ``every quadrant of this
city for years'' and wrapped himself in a ``web of deception'' to
cover it up,
   Retchin said the FBI sting operation at the Vista Hotel was
necessary in order to expose Barry's drug use. It resulted in the
mayor's arrest Jan. 18 after he was videotaped smoking FBI-supplied
crack cocaine in a hotel room.
   ``Some of you might question why there was an undercover
operation like this,'' Retchin said to the jury. She told them to
``imagine you were at war'' and ``heard allegations that the
general was helping the other side.''
   Barry denied he was involved with drugs in grand jury testimony
and in public statements, but the sting operation ``breaks the
shield of secrecy,'' said Retchin.
   ``The general was working with the other side, that is what it
comes down to,'' she told the jury.
   Defense attorney Mundy told the jurors, ``I will start right
from the beginning by telling you that Mr. Barry used cocaine.''
   But he said the government's case was built around imprecise,
uncorroborated statements from witnesses persuaded to testify in
order to ease their own legal difficulties.
   ``The defense doesn't carry immunity in its briefcase,'' said
Mundy. ``We can't forgive people for things they have done. Only
the government has that prerogative, so we're not playing on a
level field.''
   Retchin recounted testimony from 10 friends and associates of
the mayor who said they saw Barry use cocaine some 200 times from
1983 through Jan. 18.
   Barry sat at the defense table looking pensive as Retchin argued
that he should be convicted on all 14 of the criminal charges
against him. His wife, Effi, and his mother watched from the first
row of spectators.
   The jurors could look at three oversized prosecution charts
displayed in the courtroom, listing occasions, places and times
that witnesses said they sold or used drugs with Barry.
   Barry's web of deception ``began to unravel'' when police
investigated the mayor's visits in December 1988 to the hotel room
of Barry associate Charles Lewis, said Retchin.
   Barry and Lewis conspired to conceal their use of crack cocaine
in Lewis's hotel room and the mayor then waged ``the ultimate
cover-up'' by denying in front of a federal grand jury that he and
Lewis had exchanged drugs, she said.
   The mayor has pleaded innocent to 10 counts of cocaine
possession, three felony charges of lying to the grand jury and one
count of conspiracy. Each perjury count carries a maximum five-year
prison term.
   ``Our government cannot work when the chief executive officer
charged with enforcing the laws shows utter contempt and disdain
for the process and goes into the grand jury and he lies,'' said
Retchin.
   She noted that Barry had told the grand jury, ``I really respect
this process. ... This is as important as going to visit the
president of the United States.''
   When Barry was asked in front of the grand jury whether he had
given anything of value to Lewis, the mayor said he hadn't given
his friend any cocaine or other drugs.
   ``Mr. Barry anticipated the question ... Mr. Barry couldn't even
keep the lie inside himself _ it had to jump out of him,'' said
Retchin.
   Barry's own security guards, who are city police officers,
``assisted him in his web of protection,'' said Retchin.
   One guard brought an envelope to Lewis containing money used to
buy crack cocaine, said the prosecutor. Another baby-sat the
children of ex-model Rasheeda Moore while she went out to buy drugs
on Barry's instructions, said Retchin. On a boat ride in the Virgin
Islands, another guard ``kept his head down so he didn't have to
see the chief law enforcement officer of our city (Barry) using
drugs,'' she said.
   Barry's lawyers had attacked the government's witnesses as being
from the ``inner recesses of humanity,'' said Retchin.
   But ``Mr. Barry is right with them.... It was Mr. Barry who gave
us our witness list,'' she said.

<HEAD>Supporters Overwhelm Protesters at Robert Mapplethorpe Opening</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A controversial exhibit including explicit
photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe opened Wednesday as scores of
placard-toting supporters and a handful of vastly outnumbered
opponents staged competing demonstrations.
   About 200 supporters, chanting and carrying signs with such
messages as ``No Censorship,'' began gathering at the Institute for
Contemporary Art around 8:30 a.m.
   As dozens of patrons lined up to buy tickets, an angry crowd of
supporters surrounded one of six protesters opposing the exhibit
that helped spark a nationwide debate on freedom of expression.
   ``These people are trying to force their morality on the rest of
us,'' Jim Edgerley of the conservative American Freedom Coalition
said as he stood among demonstrators, patrons, police and reporters
on te museum steps.
   While Edgerley spoke, two men deliberately stood in front of him
locked in a deep, passionate kiss.
   ``See, this is the kind of behavior this is promoting,''
Edgerley said.
   Beside them stood a man who identified himself as Abe Rybeck of
the United Fruit Co. theater group, dressed in a black beehive wig,
leopard striped tights, red tap shoes, garter and short black
camisole dress.
   Brandishing a fake microphone of tinsel and silver, Rybeck told
the crowd, ``Robert Mapplethorpe is exhibiting what is really going
on in his community. He is celebrating his life, his friends, his
sex.''
   Later, the crowd drove Edgerley away by surrounding him and
chanting so loud reporters couldn't hear him.
   Less than an hour after the museum doors opened, an estimated
200 visitors were lined up outside, said museum marketing assistant
Denise Spencer.
   Some held tickets purchased in advance. The small museum allowed
just 75 people every half hour to view the 124 photographs taken by
Mapplethorpe from 1969 until shortly before he died of AIDS last
year in Boston at age 42.
   Eleanor Bleakie, 70, of Cohasset and her friend, Margaret
Mooney, 41, of Chicago were among the first to get a look at the
show.
   ``I'd read a lot about it and I was curious,'' said Bleakie. ``I
went to see what was objectionable, but I didn't find it
objectionable. I thought it was interesting.''
   ``I knew he was a good photographer but I didn't know he was
that good,'' said Mooney. ``I wanted to see how his talent measured
up against all the hype.''
   She said she didn't mind the sexually explicit, homoerotic
pictures included in the exhibition. ``They were off to the side so
if you didn't want to look at them, you didn't have to,'' she said.
They're part of life.''
   Public television station WGBH _ which telecast the most
explicit photographs on its newscast Tuesday night _ said Wednesday
morning it had received 100 calls about the broadcast, most of them
supportive. However, several people said they were swearing off
public television forever.
   A coalition of 13 pro-Mapplethorpe groups promised not to
demonstrate at the museum on Tuesday, but gay rights groups and
individual activists were out in force Wednesday.
   The demonstrators included about 100 people from the gay rights
group ACT-UP and the group Freedom of Expression who walked a
picket line across from the museum.
   Many carried elaborate creations protesting Sen. Jesse Helms,
N.C., who has led the fight to restrict federal funds for art he
branded obscene.
   The creations included a twin bed with the faces of Helms and
Adolf Hitler nestled on the pillows and a fake coffin labeled
``Casualties of Censorship'' which contained such books as
``Lolita'' by Vladimir Nabokov.
   Museum Director David Ross stood at the entrance, wearing a
button reading ``Fear No Art.'' Ross said he was unafraid of the
controversy surrounding the show. The show, which runs through Oct.
4 and is expected to draw at least 50,000 people, is the last of a
six-city tour.
   A Mapplethorpe exhibit scheduled in June 1989 at the Corcoran
Gallery of Art in Washington was canceled after Helms objected.
   Helms' protests prompted Congress to limit National Endowment
for the Arts grants. Before those limits, the Mapplethorpe tour had
received about $30,000 from the NEA, about 10 percent of the cost.
   A showing in Cincinnati led to obscenity charges against the
director of The Contemporary Arts Center, but a federal judge
barred police from confiscating photos from the exhibit.

   A digestive tract ailment has caused an
epidemic in this Himalayan kingdom, killing 331 people in the past
six weeks, a Health Ministry spokesman said Wednesday.
   At least 10,000 people were stricken by gastroenteritis in 24 of
the country's 75 districts, said the spokesman, who cannot be
identified under briefing rules.
   Gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the stomach and the
intestines, is caused by drinking contaminated water.
   The spokesman said medical teams were traveling through remote
areas to treat victims. People were being warned to drink only
boiled water, he said.

   Two young women sunbathing alongside the
Potomac River didn't bat an eye Wednesday when President Bush and
his entourage jogged right by them.
   Bush appreciatively eyed the women, smiled and apologized,
``You're on national television, ladies. Sorry about that!''
   Bikini-clad Dana Habeck, 22, of San Luis Obispo, Calif., and
Linda Kreider, 33, of Philadelphia, who wore a one-piece suit,
laughed and told reporters they didn't mind the attention.
   ``It's great,'' said Ms. Kreider.
   The pair was soaking up the sun at the isolated eastern end of
Hain's Point in East Potomac Park on the banks of the Potomac River
when Bush came jogging by with Secret Service agents and several
running partners, including Rep. Larry Hopkins, R-Ky., and Brit
Hume, a White House correspondent for ABC News.
   The president, wearing shorts and a Houston Police Department
T-shirt, got in 2{ miles on a sunny afternoon.
   Hopkins told reporters later that he had already jogged four
miles Wednesday morning when he got the invitation to run with the
president. He decided not to pass up the opportunity.

   The two Germanys on Wednesday settled
a fight on how to elect a united Parliament but continued
squabbling over whether East Germany has enough money to pull its
moribund economy into the capitalist arena.
   West German government spokesman Hans Klein said the opposition
Social Democrats agreed to an election plan allowing small East
German parties to run on tickets with larger parties with which
they are allied.
   For example, the German Social Union, which is allied with the
larger Christian Democrats, could run on the same ticket.
   This could improve the small parties' chances of winning
representation in Parliament, because each ticket will have to win
at least 5 percent of the total vote to be represented in the
united Parliament.
   East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere told reporters
late Wednesday that his coalition parties had also approved the
plan.
   The issue at one point threatened to derail the timetable of
German unification as parties jockeyed for the most favorable
conditions to improve their chances in the all-German election Dec.
2.
   De Maiziere said he expected the election law to be signed
Friday.
   Meanwhile, East German Finance Minister Walter Romberg said
Wednesday his country needs a supplementary budget of $6.25 billion
to $7.5 billion plus increased unemployment insurance.
   More than 250,000 East Germans are unemployed and experts say
that number could climb as high as 3 million as companies and
factories succumb in the transition to a free market.
   West Germany has budgeted nearly $15.6 billion this year to
cover East Germany's deficit.
   Manfred Carstens, a top West German Finance Ministry official,
criticized East Germany's request for more money as ``unserious and
politically dishonest.''
   On Tuesday, East German Labor Minister Regine Hildebrandt said
``the country is burning'' and called for billions more in West
German marks to help prop up the economy.
   De Maiziere went to Austria on Tuesday to meet with Chancellor
Helmut Kohl at his vacation retreat and discuss the economic crisis.
   The mass-circulation Bild newspaper reported Thursday that Kohl
pressed de Maiziere to find more savings in his budget.

<HEAD>Business People Complain Mohawk Standoff Threatens Bankruptcy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Local business people complained to Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa on
Wednesday that the long standoff between Mohawks and police
threatens them with bankruptcy.
   The Chateauguay Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to Mulroney
and Bourassa telling them to get personally involved in a speedy
solution to the 3-week-old impasse or face serious problems.
   Neither leader has taken a public role in dealing with the
confrontation that arose from a land dispute, leaving matters in
the hands of aides.
   ``Does it take monster demonstrations, effigy burnings or social
unrest to get you to intervene?'' the letter asked. ``If it takes
threats to get you to do your job, consider this.''
   The letter said businesses and industries in this suburb are on
the verge of bankruptcy because of Mohawk barricades blocking
highways and the Mercier Bridge connecting the region to Montreal.
   In Oka, 18 miles northwest of Montreal, a provincial policemen
was killed three weeks ago in a police raid on a Mohawk roadblock
following a municipal request for police to enforce a court order.
Blame has not been established in the death. Mohawks say Oka wants
to expand a golf course onto ancestral land.
   Oka village council scuttled a federal plan to ease tensions
when it decided Tuesday night not to sell the federl government
part of the disputed property. The land would have become part of a
new Mohawk reserve.
   ``We won't sign until the blockades come down,'' Mayor Jean
Ouellette said after the conclusion of a stormy town meeting called
to discuss the deal.
   The federal government offered to pay for land that was slated
for the golf course expansion and to pay compensation to the town
for economic loss. It earlier bought from a Frenchman land marked
for residential development.
   Ouellette initially recommended that the deal be accepted.
Several residents at the meeting objected, however, when told that
removal of the barricades would not be part of the deal.
   ``If we're ready to make a concession by selling the land, why
don't (the Mohawks) put down the barricades and the guns?'' said
businessman Bernard Boivin, 51, who led the attack on the proposal.
   Another local man, Guy Dube, added: ``The people from Oka are
standing together and saying that to let the natives have the land
without any concession on their part is something nobody will agree
to.''
   In Montreal, a human rights expert said violations have been
committed on both sides during the standoff.
   Jean-Claude Fouque, general secretary of the International
Federation of Human Rights, said he won't lay blame in his
preliminary report for the United Nations. A final report is
expected in a month or two.
   The federation, based in Paris, is an independent coalition of
human rights groups which investigates allegations of human rights
abuses.
   Fouque said Tuesday that the federation is mobilizing a task
force of 24 international observers to help end the dispute.

<TEXT>
   Archeologists have unearthed a 2,000-year-old
burial site containing 40,000 pottery figurines in the ancient
capital of Xian, said a report seen Wednesday in Beijing.
   The site is estimated to contain more than five times the number
of terracotta figurines found buried with the first Chinese
emperor, Qin Shi Huang Di, whose tomb is also in Xian, the Xinmin
Evening News of Shanghai reported Tuesday.
   The discovery of the ancient army of terracotta warriors
guarding Qin's tomb was one of the great archaeological finds of
modern times. It has turned Xian, in western China, into one of the
country's major tourist attractions.
   The newly discovered burial site dates to the Han dynasty, or
between 206 A.D. and 220 B.C.
   Archaeologists have uncovered 11 pits the past two months, the
newspaper said. Each pit measures an average of 13 feet wide, 23
feet deep, and dozens of yards long, the newspaper said.
   The more than 300 figurines excavated so far are all male, naked
and about 24 inches tall, it said. Each was exquisitely crafted
with smooth, flowing lines and attention paid to such details as
eyes, eyebrows, nose, lips, ears, hairstyle and muscles, it said.
   Experts believe that bits of silk cloth that were also found at
the site indicate the figurines originally were clothed in silk,
but their costumes have disintegrated over 2,000 years, the
newspaper said.
   Qin's terracotta army was discovered by peasants from a local
commune who were digging a new well to irrigate their parched soil
in March 1974 following a winter drought.
   Hundreds of thousands of foreign tourists visit Xian each year
to see the museum built around the pits containing the colorfully
dressed, life-size terracotta figures of archers, infantrymen and
cavalry, which guard the emperor's tomb, about two miles away.
   The terracotta warriors have yielded invaluable clues to the
dress, weaponry, military organization and physical appearance of
the era.
   Pieced together by experts, the armored warriors and their
horses, stand in formation, rank by rank. Each of the sand-colored
statues has a different facial expression and hair style.
   The finds over the years have included bronze and wooden
chariots, a variety of weapons, as well as drums and gongs used to
give command signals to troops in battle.
   The museum is about 20 miles east of Xian, now the capital of
Shaanxi Province, a city of 2.9 million people, about 660 miles
southwest of Beijing.
   Starting point of the ancient Silk Road to the West, Xian and
its environs was the cradle of Chinese civilization under 11
dynasties from the 11 century B.C. to 907 A.D., when the city was
the largest in the world with more than 1 million people.
   Qin unified scattered Chinese kingdoms into a single nation in
221 B.C. and died a year later.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Humberto Ortega, the Sandinista
who was to serve only temporarily under Nicaragua's new government,
said Wednesday he will remain at his post for at least two more
years.
   However, he pledged loyalty to President Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro and vowed to depoliticize the army.
   Some conservatives have claimed Mrs. Chamorro's failure to
replace the general, brother of former President Daniel Ortega,
signals that the U.S.-backed government has entered into a secret
power-sharing pact with the leftist Sandinistas.
   Ortega spoke in Costa Rica the day after he and other Central
American officials met here and agreed to make efforts to
proportionally equalize the size of their armed forces. Ortega said
in the past three months, the Nicaraguan army has already been
reduced from 96,000 to 46,000 men.
   In pledging loyalty to Mrs. Chamorro, Ortega said Wednesday,
``Now that she is supreme head of the army and acts within the
frame of the constitution, she will have the support of the
military.''
   He said he would remain in power to oversee the reduction and
professionalization of the armed forces and to make sure it becomes
an institution independent of any party.
   He said he would then enter civilian life, and he ruled out
running for president.
   Supporters of Mrs. Chamorro have been worried about Ortega's
position as head of the army.
   He was appointed to that post in April, when Mrs. Chamorro's
government took office after winning popular elections. The new
government then reached an accord to end the country's 9-year-old
civil war with U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   When she named Ortega to lead the army, Mrs. Chamorro said the
general, who was the defense minister under the Sandinistas, would
serve only temporarily.
   The Sandinistas are still the largest single party in the
country. They control key labor unions and the police, in addition
to the army. Sandinista-inspired labor unrest has been one of the
new government's biggest problems.
   Mrs. Chamorro's own forces has been hobbled by defections. Many
of her closest advisers, members of the National Opposition Union
that carried her to power, have withdrawn from the government.

<HEAD>Thousands of Romanians Turn to Yoga to Seek Inner Peace</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With their outer world beset by
economic hardships and political turmoil, several thousand
Romanians turned to yoga Wednesday in an effort to seek inner peace.
   More than 2,000 people gathered in the capital's Polivalenta
Hall _ once used for government-organized rallies in support of
deposed Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu _ for a yoga
convention.
   The gathering was organized by a group of yoga specialists from
different European countries.
   Ceausescu, ousted in December's revolution, banned yoga in the
early 1980s after a group of prominent intellectuals held a
``transcendental meeting'' at the Institute of Psychiatry.
Participants were later demoted from their posts and the institute
was closed down.
   As Oriental music played in the background and the scent of
burning incense filled the air, Romanians of all ages kicked off
their shoes and sought inspiration through yoga.
   Antonio Nazare, a French assistant to the Indian guru Shri
Mataji, exhorted the crowd to ``regain their inner peace,''
instructing them to reach out with their hands a huge framed
photograph of the Shri ``to absorb her energy.''
   ``I'm asking you to experience the peace of the self ... here
where comfort is more difficult to attain than in other places in
the world,'' Nazare said.
   Most of those attending the yoga meeting said they wanted to
seek refuge from the tension and confusion that have gripped
Romania since December's bloody revolution.
   ``I am happy to discover that I can find peace and calm in the
general political pandemonium with yoga,'' said 31-year-old
engineer Sandu Bidan. ``I can also find liberty.''
   Romania is suffering a severe economic crisis, marked by
shortages of many basic consumer goods. Political tensions have
been on the rise since June when the government of President Ion
Iliescu broke up a demonstration by anti-Communist activists and
jailed dozens of opponents.
   Nazare said he expected even more people to attend a second
Bucharest yoga meeting scheduled for Thursday.
   He also announced that Shri Mataji planned to visit Romania in
October. Mataji has been touring Eastern Europe, and recently
appeared before 15,000 people in Bulgaria, Nazare said.

<TEXT>
   A major forest fire raged out of control
for a third day on the island of Evvoia off eastern Greece on
Wednesday, and a brush fire threatened the ancient sanctuary at
Delphi in central Greece, officials said.
   No casualties or evacuations were reported.
   The Evvoia fire has burned more than 10,000 acres of pine forest
and olive groves, forestry officials estimated.
   ``It has destroyed our most beautiful forest and will stop soon
when it has nothing left to burn,'' said a police officer contacted
in Khalkis, the regional capital of Evvoia.
   Strong winds fanned the blaze, he said.
   A forestry department communique said other major fires were
burning near the towns of Navpaktos, Thebes, Kastoria, Krestaina
and Ioannina.
   A police official contacted at Amfissa near Delphi said a brush
fire reached within 325 feet of the marble antiquities Wednesday
before wind drove the flames in another direction. He said the fire
was still out of control on the cliffs above the sanctuary.
   Both police officers spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Delphi, near Mount Parnassus, was the seat of the most famous
and powerful oracle of ancient Greece. The prophecies were
pronounced in a temple dedicated to the god Apollo that was built
in the 6th century B.C.
   It is the most famous ancient site in Greece after the Acropolis
in Athens.
   Last week a fire near Olympia, the sanctuary to Zeus that played
host to the first Olympic Games in the eighth century B.C.,
destroyed a pine forest and killed two firefighters.
   Wildfires have also raged across the tourist islands of Samos,
Chios and Zakynthos in recent days as Greece experiences its driest
year in 100 years.

   President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia said Wednesday
he has nominated Princess Anne for the Nobel Peace Prize in
recognition of her work on behalf of helpless children around the
world.
   The 39-year-old daughter of Queen Elizabeth II has traveled to
26 countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East
since she became president of the Save the Children Fund 20 years
ago.
   ``She loves people,'' Kaunda said in a BBC interview. ``She has
extended that love to working for helpless children in many parts
of the world. That is love in action.''
   Nicholas Hinton of Save the Children told the BBC the princess
was ``universally admired for her ability to get messages across''
and to cut through bureaucratic red tape in countries where the
charity operates.

<HEAD>Two Mauled by Bear in Surprise Encounter on Trail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GLACIER NATIONAL PARK, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two hikers were mauled by a
bear they encountered on a trail in the dark, officials said.
   The couple, both summer workers for a park concessionnaire, were
in stable condition at Columbus Hospital in Great Falls recovering
from bite wounds and lacerations Wednesday. Rangers were trying to
track down the bear.
   The attack took place Tuesday night, as Matt Alonzo, 23, of New
Orleans, and Diana McCrory, 22, of Dyersburg, Tenn., were returning
from a hike on the Iceberg-Ptarmigan Lake Trail and were about a
mile from a motel, said park spokeswoman Amy Vanderbilt.
   They weren't wearing bells _ sometimes carried by hikers in the
park to deter the park's many bears _ Ms. Vanderbilt said. When
they were attacked, they fell to the ground and played dead to
discourage the bear.
   Rangers couldn't tell from tracks if the it was a black bear or
a grizzly. They hoped to find the bear and determine if it had
previous run-ins with people, Ms. Vanderbilt said.
   Indications were the animal wasn't what rangers call a ``bad
bear,'' prone to attack.
   ``It appears to be a surprise encounter, with a natural reaction
by the bear,'' she said.
   Vanderbilt said it was unlikely any action would be taken
against the bear unless the animal has a history of problems, or if
it gets into trouble in the future.
   It was the first bear attack this year in the park.
   Alonzo suffered bites and lacerations the length of his right
leg and bites on his upper right arm, Ms. Vanderbilt said. Ms
McCrory's injuries included bite wounds to her upper right arm and
arm pit, her right chest and right side, as well as her right leg
and hip, the spokeswoman said.
   Both work for Glacier Park Inc., the lodging concessionaire in
Glacier Park, and work at Glacier Park Lodge in East Glacier.
   Neither McCrory nor Alonzo wanted to talk about the ordeal
Wednesday, said the spokeswoman for Columbus Hospital.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's son Neil continues to
disagree with regulators on key points in his savings and loan
case, in which he has been accused of conflict of interest,
documents released Wednesday show.
   Bush, 35, was a director of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan
Association, a Denver-based thrift which failed in December 1988 at
a cost to taxpayers of $1 billion.
   In the two documents, made public by the Office of Thrift
Supervision, Bush and the regulators said they disagreed on a
number of significant points. The key point of contention is
whether Bush adequately disclosed to Silverado his business
relationships with Kenneth M. Good and Bill L. Walters, two big
borrowers from the thrift.
   On Monday, the OTS released a document setting out the areas of
agreement between Bush and the regulators.
   All of the documents contain information that was previously
made public. They have been submitted to Administrative Law Judge
Daniel J. Davidson as part of the proceeding in the Bush case. Bush
has been ordered to appear at a public hearing on Sept. 25 in
Denver before Davidson, who will then make a recommendation to OTS
Director Timothy Ryan.
   In addition to the OTS case, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
is considering filing a negligence lawsuit against Bush and other
Silverado directors.
   Bush's attorneys and the OTS each submitted one of the two
latest documents, called statements of contested facts. In his
seven-page paper, Bush contends that before he joined the Silverado
board, he disclosed his relationships with Good and Walters to
former Silverado chairman Michael Wise, other Silverado managers,
the board of directors and the thrift's attorneys.
   Good and Walters invested millions of dollars in Bush's oil
partnership, JNB Exploration Co., which drilled a number of dry
holes in Wyoming over two years and failed to become profitable. As
a director, Bush voted to approve some loans by Silverado to Good
and Walters but did not vote on others.
   Bush also asserts in his document that he made no agreement to
abstain from votes involving loans to Good or Walters.
   In its nine-page submission, the OTS says ``there is no
evidence'' that a letter prepared by Wise about Bush's business
dealings with the two men was actually sent. The letter was
addressed to Silverado's preferred shareholders and was accompanied
by a cover memo to the directors, the OTS notes.
   The document alleges that Bush breached his duty to Silverado
shareholders when he voted to approve certain loans to Good and
Walters. Five of those loans resulted in a combined loss to
Silverado of at least $46 million, the OTS says.
   ``Generally accepted standards of prudent operation require the
disclosure of a thrift director's relationships with major
customers of the institution when further transactions are under
consideration,'' the agency's document says.

<HEAD>Kids Of Migrant Farm Families Plan For College</HEAD>

   A generation ago, the children of migrant
farm workers rarely finished high school. Now, many are part of an
education program aimed at getting them to college.
   ``We saw some of these kids that are talented, they have the
desire, but college for them is another planet,'' sai Paula Stoup,
a research specialist with the state's Migrant Education Program.
   Thirty-two migrant students gathered for four days of workshops
at Allegheny College in northwestern Pennsylvania this week to
discuss career goals, brush up on their writing and computer skills
and improve their study habits.
   The program reaches about 6,000 migrant students in about 800
schools across the state, said director Manuel Recio. It helps
children who switch from school to school as their parents travel
looking for work in the agriculture and fishing industries.
   The students receive tutoring to help them catch up and can get
help with language problems and cultural differences, he said.
   Marilyn Agosto, 16, attended the program last year and returned
this year to help other students. For the past four years, she has
lived in Toughkenamon, a town about 20 miles west of Philadelphia.
But before that, she moved 14 times because her mother works in
health care for migrants.
   ``You get in a school and stay there a couple months and then
you move to another school,'' she said. ``You get behind and your
grades drop. It's hard to get caught up.''
   When the program began in the 1960s, more than 95 percent of
migrant students dropped out of high school, Recio said. Now, about
60 percent fail to graduate.
   ``That's still very high, but we never would have thought so
many of them would get near to college,'' he said.
   State lawmakers heard from migrant students during an education
hearing Wednesday at the college to discuss increasing the
program's budget.
   ``When my father was growing up, he had no hope in life. He was
on his own and there was no one to push him on to do anything,''
said Sandra Ramos, 16, from Toughkenamon. ``When I started four
months ago to talk about college it shocked my family.''

<HEAD>Researchers Say Gene May Increase Risk Of Lung Cancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gene that may be carried by one out of 10
people could make them more susceptible to lung cancer, according
to a study published Wednesday.
   ``There's only a suggestion that this gene exists,'' said Joan
Bailey-Wilson. ``If it does and a person with this gene smoked, the
risk of getting lung cancer would be increased tremendously.
   ``It doesn't mean a person with this gene would automatically
get lung cancer,'' Bailey-Wilson said. ``It would mean they are
much more susceptible to environmental factors.''
   The scientists at Louisiana State University Medical Center in
New Orleans have yet to confirm the gene's existence, but their
survey of 4,357 people strongly supported their theory the gene
exists, Bailey-Wilson said.
   ``It's not a wild theory or a guess pulled out of the air,''
said the associate professor of biometry and genetics. ``At this
point, it's an educated hunch.''
   The findings were published in Wednesday's Journal of the
National Cancer Institute.
   The LSU research team was investigating why Louisiana's
lung-cancer death rates are among the highest in the nation and why
lung cancer appears to cluster in some families.
   The findings don't lessen the role environmental factors, such
as smoking, are believed to play, Bailey-Wilson said.
   ``Lifestyle is still a major factor,'' she said. ``If the gene
is found, it would still mean that 80 percent of the people who get
lung cancer do so because of environmental factors.''
   The study predicts that most people who get cancer, whether they
have the gene or not, are smokers, Bailey-Wilson said. ``Gene
carriers are more susceptible, but it doesn't say at all that those
who are carriers will get it, or all of those who aren't won't get
it,'' she said.
   Among the people interviewed who had lung cancer by the age of
50, 22 percent appeared to carry the gene, Bailey-Wilson said.
   The figure dropped to 10 percent among people who developed lung
cancer before age 70, she said, but by that time other cancer
causers would have had more time to play a part.
   Once further research tracks down the gene to its spot on the
chromosomes that determine heredity and determines how it works,
scientists should be able to develop tests to determine who carries
it, said Robert C. Elston, a professor of biometry and genetics who
took part in the study.
   If the research pans out, physicians would be able to identify
people at extremely high risk of developing lung cancer, advise
them and monitor them more closely, Bailey-Wilson said.
   Success could also lead to more information on cancers and
treating them, she said.
   Positive identification of the gene is still years away, she
said. The researchers are seeking federal funding to continue their
work.
   The scientists in 1976 began going over autopsies and death
certificates in 10 south Louisiana parishes to find lung-cancer
victims. They then interviewed the 337 families of victims, and
found patterns of lung cancer, said Dr. Henry Rothschild, professor
of medicine.
   Such clusters of cancer ``could be explained on the basis of a
gene being passed down,'' Elston said.
   The scientists have not gone beyond Louisiana to determine how
widespread the gene might be, but there is no reason to think the
figures would not be about the same nationally, Bailey-Wilson said.
   Louisiana has a lung-cancer rate 25 percent rate higher than the
rest of the United States, according to the Louisiana Cancer and
Lung Trust Fund.
   About 3,000 cases of lung cancer will be diagnosed in Louisiana
this year, and 2,700 Louisianians will die of it, the American
Cancer Society estimates. Nationally, about 157,000 cases will be
diagnosed in 1990, and about 142,000 Americans will die.
   Lung cancer is the top killer among men and women, the
organization says, with only a 5 percent survival rate.

<HEAD>Hurricane Bertha Menaces Canada, Kills Six Aboard Ship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Bertha and its 75-mph
winds swirled north off the East Coast and Canada's Maritime
Provinces on Wednesday, breaking apart a freighter and fraying the
nerves of coastal residents.
   Six people were killed aboard the Maltese-registered freighter
that foundered off Cape Cod early in the day. The storm also killed
a swimmer Tuesday when it churned up seas while passing Florida.
   At least six people were injured Wedesday in Nova Scotia during
the high seas, though the hurricane skirted the mainland. Earlier
in the day, forecasters had predicted it would hit here with full
force.
   At 6 p.m. EDT, the National Weather Service in Miami said the
storm was about 60 miles southwest of Sable Island, a narrow
sandspit about 130 miles east of Halifax. The storm was racing
northeast at 16 mph and expected to weaken.
   Nova Scotians awoke Wednesday morning expecting the worst but
saw only the usual gray skies with some rain and light breezes.
   At sea, though, Bertha was deadly.
   A crew of 27 abandoned the 593-foot Maltese-registered freighter
Corazon early Wednesday 11 hours after reporting the ship was
breaking up. Thirty-foot seas whipped by winds gusting to 90 mph
had snapped its keel.
   Merchant ships plucked 21 sailors from the heavy seas, but six
crewmen were killed, according to Lt. Cmdr. Paul Milligan, a U.S.
Coast Guard spokesman.
   The Corazon was carrying 22,989 metric tons of cement bound from
Greece to New York, and the load likely contributed to its damage,
said Coast Guard Lt. j.g. Rodney Gadsden.

   A man convicted of murdering his four children by
driving the family station wagon into a river was sentenced to life
in prison Wednesday by a judge who suggested he might have
preferred conviction on lesser charges.
   Lawrence DeLisle was convicted by a jury of four counts of
first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder, the last
because his wife, Suzanne, also was in the car.
   Wayne County Circuit Judge Robert Colombo Jr. said he had no
choice but to impose five life terms, to be served concurrently. He
said the evidence proved beyond doubt the act was premeditated, but
suggested he would have preferred conviction of lesser charges.
   ``I don't know if the defendant is guilty of the crimes of which
he was convicted,'' the judge said. The jury could have convicted
DeLisle of second-degree murder, negligent homicide or involuntary
manslaughter.
   Witnesses testified DeLisle had complained that his family was a
financial burden and once, several years ago, left the house with a
candle burning by a leaky gas dryer.
   Frank Eaman, DeLisle's court-appointed lawyer, said he would
seek a new trial and, if that motion was rejected, would ask the
Michigan Court of Appeals to overturn the convictions.
   DeLisle was accused of deliberately driving his station wagon
into the Detroit River on Aug 3, a989. Supported by testimony from
his wife, DeLisle claimed a leg cramp and a faulty accelerator left
him unable to control the car as it raced down a dead-end street
and through a barricade at the river's edge.
   Jurors deliberated three days before convicting DeLisle on June
21 of four counts of first-degree murder and one of attempted
murder.
   DeLisle read a brief statement again proclaiming his innocence.
   ``A father's job is to protect his children, and I failed,'' he
told Colombo. ``I panicked. I froze. That is my guilt, not murder.''
   Suzanne DeLisle told Colombo she believed her husband was
innocent. As the survivor of an attempted murder, she was allowed
to address the judge under Michigan's victims'-rights law.
   ``The police weren't there. I was,'' said Mrs. DeLisle, who
along with her husband was rescued by passing boaters after their
car plunged into the river. ``I know Larry is innocent. ... We will
be together again.''
   Judge Colombo said he questioned his earlier rulings denying a
change of venue in the highly publicized case. The jury ``may have
been subconsciously influenced by what they already knew about the
case through the media,'' he said.
   Deputies returned DeLisle to the Wayne County Jail, where he
would stay until being transferred, probably Thursday, to the State
Prison of Southern Michigan near Jackson, sheriff's spokeswoman
Nancy Mouradian said.
   Mrs. DeLisle, confronted outside the Frank Murphy Hall of
Justice by a swarm of reporters and photographers, shouted ``Leave
me alone! Enough is enough!'' as two companions led her to a
waiting car.
   Eaman told reporters he would ask for a new trial within six
weeks. He said he was surprised by the candor expressed by Colombo
before the sentencing and was encouraged by the doubts raised by
the judge.
   ``I don't think this case is over by a long shot,'' Eaman said.
   Wayne County Prosecutor John O'Hair said he couldn't fault
Colombo for expressing anxiety over the case. But he also said that
most key rulings on evidence and the jury-screening process were
heavily weighted in DeLisle's favor.
   ``From all reports I've had on the trial, I believe the record
made in the case is virtually unimpeachable,'' O'Hair said. ``I
believe we have had as fair a trial as is possible in the criminal
justice system.''
   The children, Bryan, 8; Melissa, 4; Kathryn, 2; and Emily, 8
months, drowned as the family station wagon sank in 27 feet of
water.

   A U.N. conference to promote
breast-feeding denounced on Wednesday the practice of distributing
baby formula free to new mothers, particularly those in developing
nations.
   The conference urged closer regulation of the marketing of baby
formula to encourage breast-feeding, which is considered a key to
lowering infant mortality. Doctors said even mothers who have
tested positive for the AIDS virus should breast-feed.
   ``Attainment of the goal demands ... vigorously defending
against a bottle-feeding culture,'' said a declaration on the third
and final day of the conference. The conference was led by the
World Health Organization and UNICEF.
   Mother's milk helps boost a baby's immunity and eliminates the
need to use possibly contaminated water to prepare formula or other
food.
   U.N. officials estimate that 4 million to 5 million children
could be saved each year if they had been breast-fed. Many deaths
are caused by severe diarrhea infections.
   An assistant director-general of WHO, Hu Ching-Li, decried the
situation in some poor countries in which companies provide baby
formula free to new mothers who are capable of breast-feeding.
After beginning to bottle-feed her child in the hospital or clinic,
the mother continues to do so after going home but often does not
have the money to buy the proper formula, Hu said.
   Such marketing violates a marketing code adopted by WHO in 1979.
U.N. officials say only a few countries adhere to the code.
   UNICEF's executive director, James P. Grant, said he hopes more
nations will pledge to adopt the code when their leaders attend the
World Summit for Children at the United Nations in New York in
September.
   Two formula makers _ Carnation Co., a subsidiary of Nestle; and
Gerber, which is producing a formula with Bristol-Myers _ have
marketed their products directly to the public despite the
objections of the Academy, which represents 39,000 pediatricians.
   However, a spokesman said Carnation's marketing campaign, which
involved a few weeks of ``general consumer ads'' in the United
States, had been discontinued about 18 months ago.
   He said the company did not consider that campaign to be direct
marketing, because the company was not identified in publicity
promoting the use of infant formula. ``We do not now nor have we
direct-marketed,'' said Dick Curd, a spokesman at Carnation
headquarters in Los Angeles.
   Nestle has been the target of a U.S. consumer boycott for a
decade because of its marketing of infant formulas in developing
nations. American Home Products, another formula-maker marketing in
developing nations, also is being boycotted, said Howard Bozich,
executive director of Action for Corporate Accountability, which
monitors infant-formula abuses.
   Eighteen other companies, some from Western Europe and Japan,
also sell formula in poor nations in violation of the WHO code, he
said.
   The boycott against Nestle ended after the company agreed in
1984 to follow U.N. marketing guidelines. But it was renewed in
1988, when consumer activists accused Nestle of skirting the intent
of the guidelines by encouraging some new mothers in developing
countries to use formula, even if they could breast-feed. The
company denied that charge.
   WHO officials said the benefits of breast-feeding are so great
that even mothers who tested positive during pregnancy for the HIV
virus should nurse their children.
   Hu, a Chinese physician, said the recommendation was based on
research in many countries, including those where there is a ``very
high prevalence of AIDS.'' When pressed, he declined to elaborate,
saying the research included unpublished studies.
   There have been cases of mothers apparently transmitting the HIV
virus, which causes AIDS, to children through breast milk, but it
is rare and has not been used as a reason to discourage
breast-feeding.
   A study in June 1989 in the New England Journal of Medicine
presented circumstantial evidence that breast-feeding may increase
the AIDS risk for newborns. The study, directed by Dr. Stephane
Blanche of Necker Hospital in Paris, found that among infected
mothers, AIDS infections were found in five of six infants who were
breast-fed, compared with 25 of 99 who were not.
   It cautioned that further studies are necessary ``before infants
at risk in developing countries are deprived of the advantages of
breast-feeding.''
   In the United States, breast-feeding has declined about 1
percent a year the past decade, said Dr. Antoinette Eaton, vice
president of the American Academy of Pediatrics. She said
statistics show less than half of all mothers are still nursing
their babies one month after birth.

   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher ran
into soggy, London-like weather when she arrived at this mountain
resort Wednesday to address an international symposium.
   Mrs. Thatcher, coatless in a driving wind and chilly rain,
hurried from her Colorado Air National Guard twin-jet to a waiting
four-wheel drive vehicle. She did not pause to wave at the small
crowd but did shake hands briefly with a group of visiting
dignataries, including U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Henry F. Catto,
and Aspen Mayor Bill Stirling, among others.
   The prime minister came to Colorado to begin a combined
business-pleasure trip during which she is scheduled to give a
speech at the Aspen Institute.
   She arrived in the country at Peterson Air Force Base in
Colorado Springs and changed planes for the hop to this Rocky
Mountain ski resort.
   She was greeted in Colorado Springs by Gov. Roy Romer and Gen.
Donald Kutyna, head of the U.S. Space Command and North American
Aerospace Defense Command. Kutyna's wife, Lucy, gave the prime
minister roses when she stepped from the plane onto a red carpet.
   During her flight to Colorado Springs, Thatcher told reporters
she was cutting short her planned 10-day visit by three days to
attend the funeral of Ian Gow, the conservative member of
Parliament killed by a car bomb on Monday. Gow's funeral is Aug. 8.
   In Aspen, Thatcher will be joined Thursday by President George
Bush in a celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Aspen
Institute. Bush is scheduled to open the symposium with a keynote
address Thursday.
   The two heads of state also will meet Thursday to discuss
issues. It will be their fourth meeting in three months.
   The institute, founded by Chicago industrialist Walter Paepcke
in 1950, is designed to help global leaders focus on critical
issues. The theme for its 40th anniversary gathering is: ``Renewal:
Leadership and Values for the 21st Century.''
   The symposium begins Thursday and runs through Sunday, when
Thatcher will give her closing address and receive the Statesman
Award.
   Nearly 1,000 people are expected to participate in the
institute's seminars, which will range from health care to the
environment.
   The Statesman Award recognizes outstanding contributions by
world leaders. The two previous recipients were Jean Monnet, who
spearheaded European economic integration, and former West German
Chancellor Willy Brandt.
   This is Thatcher's first trip to Colorado, and she plans to
squeeze in visits to the National Center for Atmospheric Research
in Boulder and the Strategic Defense Initiative National Test
Facility and NORAD in Colorado Springs on Friday.
   Thatcher, 64, also will take time to visit with her son, Mark,
36, and his wife, Diane, and her grandson, Michael.

   President Bush prepared Wednesday to defend
his 1991 defense budget as House Democrats savored the cuts they
inflicted on the B-2 bomber program and the Strategic Defense
Initiative.
   ``I was out running at six this morning just because I was
exhilarated,'' Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., told reporters a few
hours after the House Armed Services Committee cut $24 billion from
the $307 billion the president had requested for defense spending
in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   The administration began lobbying Senate Republicans to restore
the cuts as the White House said Bush would speak Thursday on ``how
he perceives the U.S. defense budget.''
   The president is expected to call for a 25 percent reduction in
military forces by the mid 1990s but wants to maintain support for
the B-2 and the Strategic Defense Initiative, according to
administration and Pentagon sources.
   ``The president wants a rational build-down,'' one source said.
   Bush was to make his remarks Thursday in a speech in Aspen, Colo.
   On Tuesday, the House Armed Services Committee voted to halt
production of the B-2 stealth bomber at the 15 planes under
construction, not the 75 Bush had asked for. At nearly $865 million
each, it is the costliest airplane ever built.
   The committee, on a bipartisan vote of 40-12, also stripped
nearly $2 billion from Bush's request of $4.7 billion for the
Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars; cut military personnel
by 129,500; and scaled back on two nuclear missile programs.
   The vote left Democrats on the panel with a heady feeling.
   ``There was an image that we never met a weapons system we
didn't like and that we would fund anything that they would bring
over'' from the Pentagon, Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., said.
   Bush, meanwhile, went on the offensive.
   Spokesman Roman Popadiuk said the president will speak Thursday
in Aspen, Colo., where he will be meeting with British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Bush ``will address how he perceives the U.S. defense budget and
U.S. force structure in meeting the changing demands,'' Popadiuk
said.
   The speech, to be delivered at the Aspen Institute, will deal
with ``defense aspects of U.S. foreign policy,'' the spokesman said.
   Meanwhile, the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on military
construction approved an $8 billion spending bill for fiscal 1991
that slashes $210 million from Bush's request for $420 million for
the NATO Infrastructure Fund.
   The panel, following the lead of the House on Monday and the
House Armed Services Committee on Tuesday, also prohibited the use
of U.S. money from the fund for building a new base at Crotone,
Italy, for the 401st Tactical Wing unless authorized by Congress.
   The wing of 72 F-16 jet fighters must leave their current base
in Torrejon de Ardoz, Spain.
   Acknowledging the House tradition of wholesale cuts in the
defense budget, the administration looked to the Senate to salvage
its major weapons programs.
   The Senate has approved a higher Pentagon budget target for the
new fiscal year _ $289 billion as compared to the House's $283
billion. The chamber moved late Wednesday to bring to the floor the
bill that emerged from its Armed Services Committee.
   The Air Force chief of staff, Gen. Michael Dugan, told a
television interviewer, ``I think that thoughtful men and women ...
will come to the conclusion that if you want peace, you have to
prepare for war.''
   He predicted that Congress will not stop the B-2 program at the
15 planes.
   Support for the plane is higher in the Senate than in the House.
One staunch backer is the Armed Services chairman, Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga.
   In anticipation of Senate action, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
met with the chamber's Republicans on Tuesday.
   At the same time, a July 26 letter from Cheney began circulating
on Capitol Hill. In the letter, to the ranking Republican on the
Senate Armed Services Committee, John Warner of Virginia, the
secretary said the Senate bill ``provides substantial resources for
the B-2 stealth bomber, Trident ballistic missile submarine, small
intercontinental ballistic missile and peacekeeper-rail garrison
programs.''
   His comments amounted to an endorsement of the committee's
decision to slash $1.6 billion the administration had sought to
move the MX missile arsenal from silos to rail cars.
   The panel left intact the $548 million the Pentagon had
requested for research and development on the multiple-warhead MX
missile as well as $202 million for the single-warhead Midgetman
missile.
   In its bill, the House panel eliminated all of the request for
the MX and Midgetman missiles and, instead, set up a $610 million
strategic pot for the two weapons. The panel also called on Bush to
decide in 90 days which missile he wants.
   At the same time, Cheney noted the ``major ... shortcomings'' in
the Senate bill, including a $1 billion cut in Bush's request for
SDI, elimination of all funds for the MILSTAR program of
communications in the event of a nuclear war and cuts in the Navy's
A-12 aircraft.
   ``I urge the Senate to amend the bill to remove these concerns,
so that the final bill advances substantially the national
interest,'' Cheney said.

   A cult leader's wife was convicted
Wednesday of participating in the 1989 ritual slayings of a family
of five. It was the first verdict in the case.
   A Common Pleas Court jury found Alice Lundgren, 39, guilty of
five counts of kidnapping and five counts each of complicity and
conspiracy to commit aggravated murder after three days of
deliberations.
   Mrs. Lundgren, who could draw a life sentence, stood calmly
beside her attorney, Joseph Gibson, as the verdict was read. She
said nothing, frowning slightly as a deputy sheriff led her away.
   ``No one was prepared for that verdict,'' Gibson said. He said
he would appeal the decision.
   Assistant Lake County Prosecutor Karen Lawson said the verdict
in this city about 30 miles northeast of Cleveland would set the
tone for the trials of other cult members charged in the case.
   ``I don't believe Alice Lundgren's testimony was credible,'' Ms.
Lawson said. ``She hedged. She split hairs. She lied.''
   Eight people remain to be tried, including Mrs. Lundgren's
40-year-old husband, Jeffrey, and their son, Damon, 19. Four others
have pleaded guilty to charges in the case.
   Lundgren was defrocked in 1988 as a lay minister of the
Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Kirtland
for inappropriate conduct. He formed his own splinter sect, whose
members lived commune-style with the Lundgrens on a farm.
   Judge Paul Mitrovich did not set a sentencing date for Mrs.
Lundgren.
   Mrs. Lundgren was among 13 cult members from Kirtland who were
arrested around the country last January in the April 17, 1989,
shootings of Dennis Avery, his wife Cheryl and their three
daughters of nearby Madison Township.
   Their bodies were found buried under a barn on a Kirtland farm
about 30 miles east of Cleveland where the group lived. All five
were bound with duct tape, gagged and shot, then dumped in a common
grave.
   Authorities said the Averys also belonged to the group, but were
not considered as steadfast in its beliefs as the others.
   During Mrs. Lundgren's trial, three of the cult members who
pleaded guilty testified against Mrs. Lundgren. They said she'd
known her husband had targeted the Averys for death as a
spirit-cleansing ritual before treks in West Virginia and Missouri
in search of God.
   One cult member, Deborah Olivarez, testified that Mrs. Lundgren
portrayed her husband to others as a prophet who must be obeyed.
   Mrs. Lundgren testified that she'd heard of a plan by her
husband to sacrifice some cult members but that she disregarded it
``because he'd come up with these wild-haired plans all the time
and he didn't carry through.''
   She said she wasn't at the farm during the killings _ she had
been told by her husband to take her three other children shopping
_ and that she was told about the slayings afterward by other cult
members.
   Mrs. Lundgren also said her husband sometimes hit her and
threatened her with a gun when she argued with him.
   She said testified that she was afraid of her husband, who based
his ideas on his interpretation of Scriptures.
   Jeffrey Lundgren faces trial Aug. 13 on five counts of
aggravated murder and five counts of kidnapping. If convicted, he
could get the death penalty.

   A judge's ruling that forbade a woman
from changing her last name without her husband's permission has
been overturned.
   However, the Superior Court decision stopped short of barring
the probate judge who issued the original ruling from doing so in
the future.
   ``The reversal ... is not surprising,'' said Steve Brown,
executive director of Rhode Island's American Civil Liberties
Union. Superior Court Judge Antonio Almeida ``has simply recognized
the very basic, if obvious, principle that women are no longer the
chattel of their husbands.''
   ``I'm happy in one way, but I'm uphappy, because if another
woman goes into his courtroom ... it's possible that he could do
this again,'' Lucille Ann Riccitelli said Wednesday.
   Riccitelli, 41, decided to resume using her maiden name when her
father died suddenly with no sons. Her sister uses a hyphenated
name, she said.
   She changed the name on her driver's license, Social Security
card and a bank account.
   But Fleet National Bank refused to change the name on the bank
account Riccitelli held jointly with her mother without a court
document substantiating the name change, she said.
   When Probate Court Judge Anthony B. Sciarretta learned
Riccitelli was married, he told her to get her husband's consent.
She refused and he denied the name-change petition.
   In March, Riccitelli, represented by an ACLU attorney, appealed
the ruling and also asked that Sciarretta be forbidden from
requiring a husband's permission in any future cases.
   Almeida, in a brief opinion written Friday and released
Wednesday, formally changed Riccitelli's name.
   ``Under common law, individuals have a right to change their
name provided they do so with a nonfraudulent purpose,'' Almeida
wrote. ``Since no fraudulent purpose exists on the part of the
appellant, the Probate Court's denial of said petition was in error
and is hereby reversed.''
   He denied the motion preventing Sciarretta from requiring a
husband's consent in the future.
   ``We are disappointed the judge did not go further,'' Brown
said. ``However, I am hopeful that this will prompt Judge
Sciarretta to rethink his anachronistic ways. Otherwise, we will
find ourselves back in court seeking future remedies.''
   Sciarretta could not be reached for comment Wednesday. He was
not at his home or office.
   He said previously that he has ``a firm policy when there are
family situations.''
   He said he feels spousal consent is needed ``if there is to be
any integrity in the family unit.''
   Riccitelli said the experience, in which she was made to feel
``like a little girl,'' has made her more aware of discrimination
against women.
   ``It's a form of harassment that happened that opened my eyes in
some ways,'' she said. ``I am really definitely more aware of
things like that and I am willing to stand up for things much more
easily.''
   Riccitelli said she has started volunteering at the Women's
Center of Rhode Island, a shelter for abused women and their
children.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Campaign Reforms, Honoraria Ban</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate, warned that its public esteem had
fallen to ``the level of used car dealers,'' voted Wednesday to
hobble the money chase for campaign funds and to ban outside
speaking fees.
   Democrats overrode longstanding Republican objections to
limiting how much candidates can spend to win office to pass by a
59-40 vote, largely along party lines, the first wholesale
revamping of election laws since the Watergate era 16 years ago.
   ``The public is rapidly losing confidence in the federal
election process,'' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine. ``It is clear we have gotten to the point that the worst
alternative is to do nothing.''
   South Carolina Sen. Ernest Hollings, who maintains a
constitutional amendment is needed to address campaign reform, was
the only Democrat to vote against the bill. Five Republicans _
Sens. John McCain of Arizona, James Jeffords of Vermont, William
Cohen of Maine, David Durenberger of Minnesota and Larry Pressler
of South Dakota _ supported the bill. Sen. William Armstrong,
R-Colo., absent with a heart ailment, did not vote.

<TEXT>
   Immediate skepticism was raised as to whether the campaign
reforms or the accompanying elimination of honoraria that now
allows senators to keep thousands of dollars in speaking fees each
year will clear several remaining hurdles, including the renewed
promise of a veto by President Bush.
   ``This bill clearly will not become law,'' said Sen. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky. McConnell said he was told by White House Chief of
Staff John Sununu earlier Wednedsday that Bush would veto it. ``It
will be vetoed, there's no doubt about it,'' added Sen. Don
Nickles, R-Okla.
   By a 77-23 vote earlier Wednesday, the Senate had voted to
include in the bill Sen. Christopher Dodd's amendment to ban
pocketing of honoraria after Jan. 1, 1990 and limit any other
outside earned income to 15 percent of Senate salaries. The House
voted a similar ban for its members last year.
   ``When a significant part of our salaries comes from hustling,
and that's what it amounts to, we denigrate ourselves,'' said Dodd,
D-Conn. ``As public servants, our salaries should come from the
public alone.''
   In addition to the spending caps, the reforms in the bill would
abolish union, corporate and trade association political action
committees that accounted for one-fourth of the $185 million spent
on Senate elections in 1988.
   House leaders said they hoped to vote Friday, before lawmakers
begin a five-week vacation, on campaign finance reforms. But they
acknowledged that it might not happen because of widespread discord
among Democrats over its measures.
   Unlike their party colleagues in the Senate, House Democrasts
rejected calls to ban PACs, which have overwhelmingly favored them
over Republicans in recent elections. Many also have voiced
opposition that the proposed $550,000 spending cap for House races
is to low to cover both primary and general election challenges.
   The Senate bill would establish population-based spending caps
ranging from just under $2 million for Senate candidates in the
smallest states up to nearly $10 million for the largest,
California.
   Republicans called it a ``partisan charade'' to prevent
Republican challengers from raising enough money to overcome
Democratic incumbents' name recognition advantage and deny the GOP
a chance to gain control of Congress.
   ``In my view the die is cast on this bill,'' said Senate GOP
Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, expressing only scant optimism ``that
maybe something will come out of all this. Unless there's some
changes, that's not going to be possible.''
   The bill would represent the first major change in election laws
since congress passed the 1974 Federal Election Campaign Act in
response to the Watergate scandal and the resignation of President
Nixon because of it.
   That law established both a taxpayer checkoff public financing
mechanism and voluntary spending ceilings for presidential
elections. It also set spending ceilings on congressional races but
they were overturned two years later by the Supreme Court as
unconstitutional.
   The Senate bill would close loopholes in the 1974 law that
allowed millionaires to make contributions in blocks of $100,000
through unregulated state party organizations to the campaigns of
both Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis in the last presidential
election.
   Republicans, after losing party-line votes to stop the practice,
said it still allows unions to spend millions of dollars of their
members' dues on voter registration and turnout, 90 percent of it
on behalf of Democrats.
   ``This campaign reform bill only reforms Republicans,''
complained Dole. ``We like reform but we don't want all of it _
it's got to be shared.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The measure's chances also were complicated as the Senate began
piling other amendments onto it _ some of them likely to virtually
eliminate any chance of two-thirds, veto-proof support.
   For example, after voting to give up the $27,337 in honoraria
they can now pocket, the Senate barely approved, 51-49, New York
Sen. Daniel Moynihan's proposal requiring members to forgo unearned
income of more than 15 percent of their regular salaries.
   That would be a hard blow to the Senate's many millionaires,
whose stock and interest incomes far exceed their government
paychecks and had little problem voting to ban honoraria.
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said members of the Senate,
himself among them, had supplemented their salaries with more than
$9 million in honoraria over the past decade.
   ``The scandals of the past two years have put a black mark on
public service and raised public cynicism to an all-time high,''
Byrd said. ``We're about at the level of used car salesmen'' in the
public's esteem.
   The Senate voted last week to denounce Sen. David Durenberger,
R-Minn., for violating several ethics standards, including skirting
the limits on honoraria in a book-publishing deal.
   The House vote last year to give up its members' honoraria also
boosted their salaries to $124,000. Reluctant to vote itself the
same 25 percent pay boost, the Senate instead retained the
opportunity for its members to accept special-interest fees.
   In 1989, senators accepted nearly $3 million in honoraria and
kept more than $2.1 million, with the balance donated to charity,
according to their financial disclosure forms.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Wednesday rejected the
county's plan to redraw voting districts, calling it illogical and
insensitive to minorities.
   The ruling was issued by U.S. District Judge David Kenyon, who
previously ruled that the layout of districts for the Board of
Supervisors improperly deprived Hispanics of political power in the
nation's most populous county.
   Kenyon ruled the Board of Supervisors' conservative majority
failed to redraw district boundaries.
   He said the plan constitutes ``a nonsensical distortion of
existing supervisorial districts, a calloused interpretation of the
Voting Rights Act, and is insensitive to the needs of Hispanic and
black residents.''
   The judge set a hearing for Thursday to consider alternative
plans proposed by civil rights groups and the U.S. Justice
Department, the winners in a voting rights case against the county.
   Kenyon ruled June 7 the supervisors violated the federal Voting
Rights Act by conspiring in 1981 to draw district lines that
preserved their incumbencies while diluting Hispanic voting
strength.
   The lawsuit, filed in August 1988, accused the supervisors of
deliberately spreading the county's Hispanic population across
several districts when they changed voting boundaries after the
1980 federal census.
   Though Hispanics make up an estimated 35 percent of the county's
8.7 million residents, the five-member board has not had an elected
Hispanic member in 115 years.
   The board's conservatives responded to the ruling by drafting a
plan that created a Hispanic majority in one of the liberal board
member's districts, while also preserving the conservative majority.
   It was this plan that Kenyon rejected Wednesday.
   Attorney Marc Rosenbaum of the American Civil Liberties Union,
one of the plaintiffs, said the judge's ruling sends a strong
message to governments that think they can gerrymander away
minority political clout.
   ``Their day is over,'' said Rosenbaum. ``But ... those
governmental bodies that respect the law, adhere to the
Constitution and to the rights of minorities ... have nothing to
fear.''
   The next redistricting plans, to be submitted by the ACLU, the
government and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational
Fund, are aimed at creating a Hispanic majority district but
without an incumbent.
   The plans could greatly increase Hispanic political clout and
overturn the conservative majority, with possibly profound
implications on future funding for such areas as health and social
services programs.
   Conservative Supervisor Mike Antonovich denounced the judge's
decision and vowed to fight it on appeal. Antonovich said the
plaintiffs were simply trying to use the courts to upset the
board's ideological complexion.
   ``They're doing that outside of the electoral process,'' he said.
   In defense of the current district boundaries, Antonovich
pointed to the June election.
   Sarah Flores, a Hispanic backed by conservative supervisors, got
the most votes for a seat opened by outgoing conservative
Supervisor Peter Schabarum and forced a runoff with Superior Court
Judge Gregory O'Brien.
   But plaintiffs have rejected Antonovich's reasoning, saying the
ethnicity of a supervisor is not as important as who elects the
supervisor. Kenyon's decisions have put the outcome of the election
in doubt.

<HEAD>Unclad `Doonesbury' Character Becomes Controversial</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Contents of 4th graf may offend some readers.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOSH LEMIEUX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some editors are taking a close look at
a ``Doonesbury'' comic strip due out next week in which a character
clad in nothing but rope utters provocative language.
   ``Frankly, it didn't offend me, but I'm thinking of all the
people out there,'' said Jim Hughes, executive editor of the Baton
Rouge Morning Advocate and State Times.
   The strip by G.B. Trudeau features the character J.J. giving her
rendition of ``performance art'' with a bucket over her head and
nothing but rope covering her privates.
   She speaks in fragmented sentences laced with words with sexual
connotations such as ``lubricate'' and ``hot juices,'' but doesn't
make any direct reference to sex acts.
   ``The way I read it, it's an attempt to show the lengths that
the art community will go to thumb their noses at government
grants,'' said Jack Morrissey, an associate editor at Universal
Press Syndicate. The Kansas City area-based company distributes the
``Doonesbury'' strip to about 1,000 newspapers.
   Trudeau appeared to be referring to controversy over National
Endowment of the Arts funding. Some conservative politicians have
tried to block government money going to artwork they consider
obscene, and several performance artists have lost their grants.
   Morrissey said several editors had called with questions about
taste and the reason behind releasing the strip. But no paper
indicated that it would pull the comic next week, he said.
   Hughes said he had his staff call other papers around the
country Wednesday to see whether they would run the strip, which
papers received this week and is scheduled for release from Aug. 6
to Aug. 11.
   Hughes said his paper had yet to make a decision.
   Three of the papers contacted by Hughes' staff _ The Kansas City
Star, The Los Angeles Times and The Philadelphia Inquirer _ said
they examined the strip closely and decided to run it without
alteration.
   ``If you held it out, the Doonesbury people would get mad. And
if you run it, I imagine some other people will get mad,'' said Joe
McGuff, vice president and editor of the Star. ``I just take that
as a given.''
   Bob Duffy, vice president of Universal Press, said newspapers
could choose to withhold the strip. But he strongly discouraged
editors from altering it for reasons of taste, as papers have done
to Trudeau's comics in the past.
   ``We'd rather have them drop the strip than alter it,'' he said.
``That's always been our position, but you can't police 1,000
newspapers.''

   U.S. factory productivity lagged behind all
but one of the world's major industrial countries last year, and
analysts blame the poor showing largely on the nation's weak
savings and investment rate that in turn holds down plant
investment.
   A Labor Department survey on the 11 richest industrial countries
is a worrisome sign that Americans' standard of living won't
increase dramatically any time soon, private economists said
Tuesday.
   In addition, they said, it shows that the nation's economic
clout may be slipping, compared with such nations as Japan and West
Germany.
   ``It isn't the worst thing in the world if someone else is
richer than you, but since power tends to go with wealth, this
hurts our standing on the power curve,'' said Robert Dederick,
chief economist at the Northern Trust Co. of Chicago.

   Outnumbered Republicans are complaining that
it is only their traditional sources of money being singled out for
``reform'' in a Senate campaign finance bill.
   The furor erupted Tuesday after Democrats beat back efforts to
weaken unions' influence in elections.
   ``All of the bipartisanship has completely broken down,'' Sen.
John McClain, R-Ariz., said after losing a 49-49 tie vote on his
measure to make candidates turn surpluses in their campaign
accounts over to the government instead of keeping them for use in
future elections.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said he would attempt
to amend the bill today to ban senators from accepting up to
$27,100 a year in speaking fees ``honoraria'' to supplement their
current $98,200 salaries.

   The Commerce Department approved the sale of
industrial furnaces to Iraq even though the manufacturer told U.S.
officials the items could be used to produce nuclear weapons
material, documents show.
   The White House intervened to block the sale of the furnaces
this month, effectively reversing the Commerce Department's earlier
decision.
   The action came as Congress passed sanctions against Iraq and
the administration weighed whether to restore Iraq to a list of
countries that support terrorism. U.S. officials believe that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein is seeking to develop nuclear weapons
technology.
   A senior State Department official said Tuesday the United
States is placing new restrictions on exports of items to Iraq that
could be used for the Middle Eastern country's development of
missiles or chemical and biological weapons.

   Gene therapy, a new medical magic bullet in
the war on cancer, diabetes and many inherited disorders, could be
used on patients for the first time this fall.
   A federal panel approved the use of gene therapy for two
disorders on Tuesday and a National Institutes of Health scientist
said that if the technique works, it gives medicine a powerful new
way to cure the incurable.
   ``This is the first step in what probably will be a revolution
in medicine over the next two decades,'' said Dr. W. French
Anderson, an NIH researcher.
   A proposal by Anderson to use gene therapy to treat an inherited
immune system disorder and one by Dr. Steven Rosenberg to treat a
lethal skin cancer were approved by the Recombinant DNA Advisory
Committee at NIH.

   Bowing to pressure from civil rights
groups and corporate sponsors of this month's Professional Golfers'
Association championship, the host country club has agreed to admit
black members.
   Shoal Creek Country Club announced Tuesday that an insurance
company president is its first black member. It said more blacks
are under consideration.
   The action halted plans by the NAACP and the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference to protest the tournament Aug. 9-12.
   Six companies, including IBM and Spalding, had decided not to
run TV commercials during the championship because Shoal Creek had
no blacks. An NBC-owned TV station in Los Angeles had said it would
not air highlights of the tournament.

<HEAD>Modern Lombard League Seeks Autonomy from Rome</HEAD>
<BYLINE>LaserPhoto planned

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERGAMO, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Winds of independence, blown from the
north by an 800-year-old ghost incarnate, are giving Rome a few
shivers.
   Northern politicians have revived the Lombard League, a 12th
century alliance of autonomy-loving cities that fought the
oppression of the Holy Roman Empire.
   They want to remove Lombardy, the most productive part of Italy,
from the grasp of a slow-moving, tax-eating, notoriously
inefficient central government.
   Rome was stunned this spring by the league's strong showing in
local elections. It became the second-ranked party in the region,
behind Premier Giulio Andreotti's Christian Democrats.
   Part of the Lombard League's popularity stems from northern
resentment of Rome for sending workers from the underdeveloped
south for the past 40 years to deliver their mail, teach their
children and police their streets.
   Northerners have disdained some of those jobs, particularly
police work, because of the low pay and high risk. Others jobs,
such as teaching, are based on national competitions the
northerners claim are weighted in favor of people from the south.
   In addition, many bureaucratic posts are political appointments,
and northerners say southerners get most of them.
   The league wants to end a virtual open-door policy that is
bringing a tide of poor immigrants to Italy. Most of the latest
arrivals are poor, from North Africa and Asia.
   On a wall of the league headquarters, in a working-class
district of Milan, is a poster showing a plump chicken whose golden
eggs tumble into a basket held by a fat farmer's wife. As the
league sees it, the chicken is productive Lombardy and the peasant
woman a parasitic south.
   Lombard League newspapers denounce Rome for, they say, using
money from the north for wasteful development programs in the south.
   Hundreds of millions of dollars were poured into construction
projects in the Naples area after the 1980 earthquake there, for
example, but thousands of people made homeless by the disaster
still live in makeshift housing.
   Sen. Umberto Bossi said in an interview the party wants Italy to
become a federalist state with the central government's role
limited to defense, foreign policy, taxes and some judicial matters.
   Bossi, league president and its only member of Parliament, looks
to Switzerland, Lombardy's neighbor across the Alps, as a model.
   Many Lombards say they identify more with the rest of Europe
than with Italy, whose international image often is that of the
south.
   Soccer may well be country's strongest bond, but north-south
bitterness emerged even during the World Cup competition Italy
hosted this summer.
   Argentine soccer star Diego Maradona, who plays for Naples
during the regular season, was booed for trying to get his fans to
root for Argentina when it played the Italian national team in
Naples. He was accused of exploiting north-south hatreds.
   ``I never said that the Neapolitans should root for Argentina,''
he said later. ``I just made a few observations ... like the
banners in Verona,'' when Naples played there, ``that said `Wash
yourselves' and `Welcome to Italy'.''
   Charges that the League is racist make some northerners cautious
in expressing sympathy for the party. Bossi rejects the racist
label.
   ``I didn't vote for the league, but some of my friends did,''
said Claudio Tarini on the train ride home to Milan from Rome,
where he had spent two days dealing with the bureaucracy to obtain
the necessary permits for a business trip to Nigeria.
   While racism undoubtedly motivated some to vote for the league,
Tarini said, public disgust with Rome was the principal reason for
the election success.
   As a newspaper columnist wrote in describing the average
citizen's entanglements with clerks and paperwork to meet ordinary
requirements of daily life: ``Will I have to vote for the league to
get a driver's license?''
   The column appeared in La Stampa, a national daily based in
Turin, capital of the Piedmont, which borders Lombardy and has its
own regional party.
   Bossi says the League will begin collecting signatures in
September to force a referendum on a law that allowed tens of
thousands of Third World immigrants to stay in Italy.
   After his election to the Senate in 1987, Bossi sponsored a bill
that stopped the practice of sending convicted Mafiosi from the
south to internal exile in northern towns.

   At a park that was twice the World's Fair
grounds, amid softball games and bicycles, under the vapor trails
of thundering airliners, hundreds convene each week to seek the
Virgin Mary.
   They are certain she is here, in Flushing Meadows Park. They
have assembled for 20 years _ since June 18, 1970, when Veronica
Lueken, a housewife and mother of five, first said she saw Mary at
a church in Bayside, Queens.
   The Roman Catholic Church is not convinced. But believers insist
they are witnesses to a continuing miracle.
   ``It increases our faith,'' said Kathy Anderson, a Long Island
mother of four who attends with her husband, a computer consultant.
``We truly believe that Jesus and the blessed mother are here. This
is the most important Marian shrine of our day.''
   Linda Bonas, 30, a Brooklyn teacher, looked around at the 500 or
so worshippers reciting the rosary on a recent Sunday and said:
``If everything was happy and was doing well around the world, you
wouldn't have too many people here. Most of them realize there's
something missing.''
   Mrs. Lueken claims the apparitions tell her that unless we mend
our sinning ways, the world will be destroyed by comets,
earthquakes, World War III and other disasters.
   But she rarely attends services. She has had heart and
gallbladder surgery and suffers from high blood pressure, back pain
and ringing in the ears. Her followers call her a ``victim soul,''
one who suffers in exchange for blessings.
   Word of her first vision at St. Robert Bellarmine Roman Catholic
Church spread quickly. In 1975, she was barred from holding vigils
there _ the crowds were too big.
   Police offered to let them meet at Flushing Meadows, where the
Vatican pavilion stood during the 1964-65 World's Fair. Pope Paul
VI had blessed the site, marked by a stone wall on a grassy field.
   Mrs. Lueken says the visions moved there from the church.
   It seems an unlikely place for a miracle, amid soccer and
softball games, joggers and bicyclists. Traffic drones from nearby
expressways and jets roar overhead to and from La Guardia Airport,
sometimes drowning out the prayers.
   Worshippers bring a statue of the Madonna each week and adorn it
with roses. The flowers, believed blessed by the Virgin during
services, are then given to the crowd.
   Frank DeRosa, spokesman for the Roman Catholic Diocese of
Brooklyn, which oversees Queens, said ``no credibility can be given
to the claims of apparitions at the site of the vigils. The diocese
does not believe that anything of an incredible or miraculous
nature is happening there. We discourage people from coming to
attend the vigils.''
   Michael Mangan, director of Our Lady of the Roses, Mary Help of
Mothers _ the official name for Mrs. Lueken's followers _ says the
diocese's failure to certify the miracle is ``par for the course
when it comes to the church and their involvement and assessment of
apparitions.''
   He said the group's name came to Mrs. Lueken in a message from
Mary.
   ``Roses, as Our Lady explained, is nature's purest flower, a
symbol of perfection,'' said Mangan. ``Mary, help of mothers, is
because many mothers are worried about their children today.''
   The group claims 60,000 believers worldwide.
   On a recent Sunday, Peter Livsack, 63, came on a chartered bus
from Philadelphia. Like many others, he brought a Polaroid camera
and snapped pictures of the Madonna he said would become
``miraculous photos.'' Livsack says he often notices squiggles,
shadows and patches of light on the pictures when he gets home.
   He believes these are messages from God resembling doves,
initials and faces of saints. ``See the mouth, see the eye, right
in the branches of the trees?'' he asks.
   Many of the messages Mrs. Lueken receives are predictions of
doom _ ``God's punishment for man's rejection of him,'' Mangan
says. ``Civilization has always been punished or ended when the
moral decadence and sins has reached its peak.''
   But he added: ``The Virgin Mary, like a true mother, has love
for her children and she's coming to warn us to mend our ways and
turn back to pray the holy rosary and practice the Roman Catholic
faith.''
   Mangan, one of 15 full-time employees, says bills are paid
``through unsolicited donations.'' Requests for money are never
made at the services and are not common in the group's literature.
   ``Our Lady just gives enough to provide for her work,'' he said.
   The organization describes its history and Mrs. Lueken's
messages in booklets, videotapes, radio and cable television shows
aired around the country, and even in advertisements on the subway.
   ``We're using the latest technology and modern means to
propagate this message,'' said Mangan. ``Anything to inform these
desperate souls out there.''

<HEAD>Governors See GOP Plan as Adding to Tax Woes</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It used to be an article of Republican faith:
the more taxing and spending that can be shifted out of Washington
to local and state governments, the better.
   That tenet now seems subject to revision to fit the federal
deficit crunch. As governors and local officials see it, the new
version shifts spending all right, but then proposes tax changes
that would undercut their ability to raise their own revenues.
   At the long, lagging negotiations on an elusive deal to trim the
$169 projected budget deficit, Republicans produced a plan that
included a new ceiling on federal tax deductions for state and
local income taxes. It also would sharply increase the federal tax
on beer and wine, as part of a package of $54 billion in spending
cuts and revenue increases.
   The federal tax deduction for state income taxes would be
limited to $10,000 a year, and most of the estimated $3 billion it
would produce would come from taxpayers making $100,000 a year or
more.
   So some congressional Republicans said the plan the
administration floated _ but never really disclosed _ should
satisfy Democrats who insist that upper income Americans pay most
of the tax cost of deficit control.
   It didn't. And it ran head-on into the opposition of governors
of both political parties, in Mobile, Ala., for their annual
conference, which ended Tuesday after raising the volume of their
usually scattered protests.
   The governors already are facing tax woes of their own; 36
states are electing governors this year and where incumbents are in
jeopardy, it's usually over increased taxes.
   State taxes generally have increased during the past decade,
under a conservative Republican administration that has trimmed
federal aid. That worked in boom times, but it is a worsening
problem in a slowing economy.
   Democratic governors circulated a letter demanding that
President Bush drop the tax idea. They said it would impose a
double tax in the states that have done the most to deal with their
own financial problems, and would make it tougher for the states to
increase their own revenues.
   There are income taxes in 44 states, and local income taxes are
levied in 11 of them.
   Along with the impact, governors feared the precedent.
   Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina, a Republican
usually allied with the administration, said the idea of a
deduction limit was ominous.
   Once that ceiling was in place, lowering it would be a tempting
way to come up with future federal tax increases. About one-third
of all the itemized deductions on federal tax returns are for state
and local income taxes.
   Deductions for state sales taxes were phased out as part of the
1986 tax overhaul.
   Bush has not acknowledged administration authorship of the tax
plan; the refrain at the White House is that everything is still on
the table. That's what John H. Sununu, the chief of staff, told the
governors on Sunday. He also said the proposal wasn't what the
president would prefer.
   But it was put together by Bush's budget director, and it
appears that the president would prefer it to a straight increase
in the federal income tax rate for the wealthiest taxpayers. Under
current law, middle and upper income taxpayers pay 33 percent; on
family incomes over about $186,000, the rate dips back to 28
percent.
   Despite that White House wariness, Senate Republican Leader Bob
Dole, said, ``We've laid out a specific plan and we're still
waiting to hear from the Democrats.''
   But the Democrats were in no hurry to talk taxes. They always
wanted the Republicans to go first.
   And congressional Republicans, looking toward the Nov. 6
elections, complained they were taking a beating.

<HEAD>Corpus Christi Becoming Focus of Anti-Abortion Activism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In just nine months, the Roman
Catholic bishop has excommunicated two abortion clinic employees,
the sheriff has prayed on the sidewalk while police pulled his wife
and other anti-abortion protesters from a clinic doorway, and
petitioners succeeded in forcing a vote on a city charter amendment
that would declare human life begins at conception.
   ``The Holy Spirit is doing something in Corpus Christi,'' says
Rex Moses, the man inspiring much of the anti-abortion activity.
``I think it's happening because God has picked Corpus Christi as a
beachhead.''
   His opponents say it's Moses, not God, who picked Corpus
Christi, which is Latin for ``body of Christ.''
   ``I think Rex Moses targeted the city,'' said Amanda Stukenberg,
president of South Texans for Choice, an abortion rights group. ``I
think the name itself helped make it a battleground.''
   Moses might agree. ``All names are significant,'' he said,
noting that reporters often ask him if Moses really is his name
``because it all seems to improbable.''
   ``God matched this person with that name,'' he said.
   It was in November that Moses, 35, brought his anti-abortion
crusade from Austin to this Gulf Coast city of nearly 300,000,
which is predominantly Catholic and Hispanic.
   Moses said he formed Body of Christ Rescue after losing the
support of religious leaders in Austin. He was convicted three
times there of criminal trespassing for blocking access to women's
services clinics with his Austin Rescue group.
   Moses has appealed a year's worth of jail sentences, but said he
expects he'll eventually have to serve the time. He asserts that
trespassing is not illegal if the trespasser is trying to save the
unborn from ``imminent harm.''
   One of Moses' first actions upon arriving in Corpus Christi was
a ``rescue.'' Twelve people were arrested for trying to keep
patients and staff out of one of the city's two clinics, where a
total of about 3,000 abortions were performed last year.
   But Moses wasn't arrested then, nor in the other 18 local clinic
blockades in which he has participated. And police have arrested
only a handful of his protesters.
   Police Chief Henry Garrett said only those who assault police
officers or force their way into the clinics will be taken into
custody. Mass arrests would only give the protesters more
publicity, he said.
   The police chief said he does not foresee having to arrest
Sheriff Jim Hickey or Hickey's wife, Jan, two staunch Moses allies.
   Hickey surprised visitors to the sheriff's department earlier
this year with Moses posters featuring a photograph of a
decapitated fetus and the caption, ``Legal Abortion Kills Baby
Boy.''
   Hickey won't send deputies to help police clear access to the
clinics, saying, ``I would be aiding in murder of babies if I did.''
   The Catholic sheriff credits Moses with inspiring him and others
in the city to get more involved in the anti-abortion movement.
   Tracy Cassidy, chairwoman of the Human Family Committee, which
sponsored the petition drive to force the vote next Jan. 19 on the
city charter amendment, is another Moses ally. She said she knows
adding a preamble to the charter would have no legal weight, but
``we will be making a statement as a community that we respect
human life in all stages.''
   The declaration states, in part, that ``Human life begins at
conception and extends to the moment of natural death.''
   South Texans for Choice will fight it.
   ``Statements about one's philosophies or religious beliefs do
not belong in the city charter,'' Ms. Stukenberg said.
   Moses helped promote ``a religious coalition that is directing
its congregations how to vote on a secular political document,''
she said.
   Rachel Vargas, one of the Corpus Christi residents
excommunicated by Bishop Rene Gracida, also blames Moses for the
stepped-up anti-abortion activism.
   Ms. Vargas links her excommunication to a statement she gave
last December during a Moses-organized ``rescue,'' when she told a
local Catholic newspaper that she was a ``pro-choice Catholic.''
   She said she believes more contraception would reduce the number
of abortions and that ``God breathes life into a baby at the moment
of birth.'' Moses and many of his followers oppose all forms of
artificial birth control.
   Gracida ``certainly had to make an example out of me, since I
publicly stated that I am a pro-choice Catholic,'' said Ms. Vargas,
who cried during an interview six weeks after her June
excommunication, which deprives her of church sacraments, including
Communion.
   ``Someone had to be a scapegoat,'' she said.
   Dr. Eduardo Aquino, an obstetrician, also received an
excommunication decree from the bishop earlier this year.
   Elva Bustamante, director of the New Women's clinic where Aquino
performs abortions twice a week, has received two warning letters
from the bishop, but no final decree. She sent the bishop a letter
last month telling him she would not quit her job, as he had
demanded.
   Church law states that those participating in abortions
automatically excommunicate themselves, with or without an official
decree from a bishop.
   Moses devoted his life to the anti-abortion cause shortly after
converting from what he calls ``fundamentalist quasi-Pentecostal''
beliefs to Catholicism in 1988.
   He gave away most of his possessions, he said, quit his
$200,000-a-year job designing pension plans, and sold his share of
the company for $1. He got rid of his assets in anticipation of the
lawsuits he believed would follow his protests, he said.
   He now owes more than $1 million in judgments to an Austin
clinic and an Austin police officer injured while trying to lift a
300-pound protester.
   He said he, his wife and their four children survive on
occasional cash and food donations, and his office space and duplex
are leased from former City Councilman Cliff Zarsky, a longtime
abortion foe.
   Moses contends his activities here have left the city with far
fewer doctors willing to perform abortions, and Ms. Vargas also
believes that many local prominent pro-choice figures now are
afraid to speak out.
   But not all members of the religious community, even those
opposed to abortion, support his tactics, Moses concedes. They cite
the biblical instruction to obey the laws of the land.
   ``The guy who wrote that was in jail when he wrote that,'' Moses
responds, referring to Apostle Paul. ``If a lot of people agreed
with what I am doing, I wouldn't have to be doing it.''

<HEAD>Vietnam Photographer Goes Down Memory Lane</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Philip Jones Griffiths, a photographer who spent
three years covering the Vietnam War, took a trip down memory lane
last year. But he did it the hard way _ on remnants of the Ho Chi
Minh trail.
   When he first saw what once had been North Vietnam's famous,
much-bombed main supply route south, he suffered a bit of
photographer's regret:
   ``I suppose what I was thinking is that I should have been here
20 years ago. The photographer's instinct is to say, `I've been
cheated. I should have been here.' ''
   His ``Ho Chi Minh Trail'' expedition, filmed for the BBC's
``Great Journeys'' series bought by 61 public TV stations, will
start airing later this month _ Aug. 11 here and from Aug. 13 to 16
in other cities.
   The Ho Chi Minh trail was far more than a trail. It was a
network of trails, dirt roads and river crossings, mostly covered
by jungle, that stretched south for 200 to 300 miles into Laos,
Cambodia and South Vietnam.
   It was heavily bombed by U.S. warplanes and periodically
infiltrated by U.S. Army Special Forces troops, but few Western
journalists ever traveled it during the war.
   No doubt puzzled, officials in Hanoi last year gave Griffiths
and his camera crew permission to film what it looks like now _ at
least those portions still passable in the Soviet-made jeep they
loaned him, along with a guide.
   As you'd expect, it was tough trip, says the 54-year-old
photographer.
   Large chunks of the once-bustling trail have been reclaimed by
the jungle, ``and once you stop upkeeping a road like that it
disappears very quickly. So our biggest task was actually finding
it.''
   ``Occasionally, you'd find what looked like a hopeful bit of
road. But after half a mile, there would be so many old bomb
craters that no vehicle on earth could traverse them. They were too
close together.''
   Griffiths got to travel only the trail's Vietnam side. His
attempt to follow it through Laos, starting at what once was a
major wartime entry point called the Mu Gia Pass, was blocked by
guards.
   It wasn't just because the trail was washed out, he says.
   ``The Laotians wouldn't let us go in. They try to maintain a
little independence from the Vietnamese, so they were anxious that
it wouldn't seem they were being ordered to let us in.''
   But he doubts that the trail network through Laos exists
anymore, although he concedes ``there's no real way of finding
out'' without Laotian permission.
   The Welsh-born Griffiths, whose documentary is liberally filled
with North Vietnamese wartime footage of the trail, only got as far
as Vietnam's Central Highlands before his expedition ended.
   The reason: the continuing war in Cambodia in which soldiers who
include the Khmer Rouge are fighting those of the Vietnam-backed
government.
   ``We couldn't get too close to the border at times, because when
you start coming around the edge of Cambodia, the Vietnamese began
getting worried about the Khmer Rouge,'' he says.
   Griffiths took a philosophical attitude about the possibility
that the Cambodian communist forces might have crossed the border
and mined parts of the road on which he was able to travel.
   ``My feeling is that the bits the Vietnamese kept in repair were
pretty well-traveled, and if the Khmer Rouge had ever booby-trapped
them, they certainly weren't going to tell me about it,'' he says.
   The early part of his tour took him through what once was the
so-called demilitarized zone between North and South Vietnam, then
past two famous battlefields _ Khe Sanh and the A Shau Valley.
   He spent one night in the latter, which in May 1969 was the
scene of the bloody, controversial battle for what U.S. troops
called Hamburger Hill.
   ``There's sort of a people's committee building on the valley
floor right opposite Hamburger Hill,'' Griffiths says. ``You sit on
the balcony in the evening, and you look at Hamburger Hill.
   ``It just looks so peaceful and green now. That's one of the
disappointing things about old battlefields. They don't look like
old battlefields.''

<HEAD>Social Security Harvest Sometimes Better Than Soybeans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In much of rural America, a boost in monthly
Social Security checks is more important than an increase in
soybean prices or a few new jobs at the local broom factory.
   ``Transfer payments, such as Social Security, are a large and
growing source of income in non-metro areas,'' says a report by the
Agriculture Department. ``From 1969 to 1987, transfers grew from
11.6 percent to 18.7 percent of non-metro income.''
   Transfer payments also include retirement and disability
benefits, medical benefits, welfare, food stamps, unemployment
insurance, veterans' benefits and various other benefits.
   ``Such transfers have a stabilizing effect on rural economies,''
the report said. ``Recipients continue to receive income from the
programs, even when employment and earnings fall during
recessions.''
   In 1987, when transfer payments made up 18.7 percent or $18.70
of every $100 in rural income, the urban rate was only 13.7 percent.
   The report was written by Robert A. Hoppe and Linda M. Ghelfi of
the department's Economic Research Service and was included in a
recent issue of Rural Development Perspectives magazine.
   Big development programs to boost business and industrial
enterprises have had a lot of attention over the years. Federal
grants, loan guarantees and similar aid are staple fare when
Congress talks about rural development.
   A financially healthy agricultural sector also is looked upon as
one way of enhancing the rural economy.
   While all of these are important, the study by Hoppe and Ghelfi
shows that Social Security and the other transfer payments are
making a valuable imprint of their own.
   Since 1969, the report said, wider eligibility and increased
payment levels occurred in a number of programs. In 1973, for
example, Medicare began to cover disabled people under the Social
Security and railroad retirement programs.
   Food stamps existed in less than half the nation's 3,000
counties in 1969. By July 1974, all counties were required to offer
them to low-income families.
   ``Finally, people 65 and older are a growing proportion of the
total population, particularly in non-metro areas,'' the report
said.
   The report said 475 rural counties have a ``high share'' of
their incomes from transfer payments. Those range from 12.3 percent
in Clay County, Ill., to 25.8 percent in McDowell County, W.Va.
   High-share counties were said to be concentrated in:
   _Appalachia, including West Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky and
Tennessee.
   _Ozark-Ouachita area of Missouri, Arkansas and Oklahoma.
   _Other scattered areas of the South.
   _Upper Great Lakes region of northern Michigan, Wisconsin and
Minnesota.
   _Various areas scattered throughout the West.
   ``These counties are highly dependent upon retirement and
disability income because earnings per job are generally low or
because elderly residents constitute a high proportion of total
population,'' the report said.
   In 1986, for example, earnings per job averaged $13,668 in the
high-share counties, compared with $15,188 in all the non-metro
counties.
   Not only do transfer payments help buffer against the effects of
recession on local economies, the elderly and welfare recipients
tend to spend their money at home.
   ``This spending provides local retailers with a stable consumer
base that helps them survive recessions when the newly unemployed
reduce their purchases,'' the report said.
   ``Some rural development specialists even advocate attracting
older (people) because retirees can bring large amounts of transfer
income with them and tend to spend their income locally.''
   There are practical limits to all this, however. Building a
local economy on Social Security checks and other benefits can have
some pitfalls.
   ``Local business and government leaders in areas heavily
dependent on transfers should try to keep abreast of proposed
program changes that could alter transfer payments,'' the report
said. ``Retirement and disability programs, in particular, should
be monitored closely.''
   The analysis said a continued commitment by society to support
Social Security will be especially important, since it alone pays
about three-quarters of all retirement and disability benefits.
   ``Relying on the transfer income of the elderly, then, can be a
viable short-run development strategy,'' the report said. ``But in
the long-run, the transfer income of the elderly may not be a rural
development panacea.''

20 years to completely clean up hazardous residues.
   ``I think people should be concerned that we're operating
safely,'' said Phil Warner, the plant's new general manager. ``This
plant is no more dangerous than any other large manufacturing
operation, but the materials are dangerous stuff unless you do a
good job.
   ``People ought to make sure we're doing a good job,'' he said.
``I would.''
   Federal officials ordered the halt in plutonium processing last
November after being shocked by the unsafe conditions they found.
EG&amp;G Inc. was named the new manager of the government-owned plant
at the beginning of the year, and its executives say things were
even worse than they expected.
   Among the most serious problems cited:
   _ Many alarms do not work, and wiring of the system was not
documented properly. The alarm system is tied to the public address
system, which often does not work. The problem is so serious that
in the event of a runaway nuclear reaction, the proper emergency
teams might not be alerted.
   _ Crucial equipment, especially pipes and holding tanks, is more
than 30 years old, and workers fear gaskets will leak when
production resumes. Dams are being built inside the plant to
contain any leaks.
   _ Glove boxes in which the warhead triggers are fabricated have
cracked glass that could release plutonium into the air. Other
glove boxes lack drains for water. If water builds up over a few
inches, it could cause an uncontrolled fission reaction; the
resulting flash of radiation would kill anyone within 15 feet
instantly and injure people up to 70 feet away.
   _ Monitoring devices have failed, allowing plutonium to be
tracked from the plant on workers' shoes. Decontamination teams had
to trace workers' routes off the grounds, including into Denver, to
determine where they tracked the toxic metal.
   Other problems included the lack of a single on-site
environmental executive and the need for paving a parking lot,
apparently to reduce wind-blown dust that potentially could carry
radioactivity off the grounds.
   In addition, investigators said soil, groundwater and a sewage
treatment plant are contaminated with hazardous waste. Residents of
the area fear contaminated water has seeped into their groundwater
supplies.
   Then this summer, federal investigators found they could breach
part of the security system intended to prevent theft of highly
radioactive plutonium. The government suspended the handling of all
radioactive materials, although officials said other security
measures prevented any plutonium being smuggled off the grounds.
   In late July, the Department of Energy announced the $150
million price tag for the partial cleanup at the 130-building
complex in the foothills of the Rockies. Officials said it will be
at least several months before EG&amp;G can meet conditions for
resuming plutonium production.
   The plant, which was hit by near disastrous fires in 1957 and
1969 and blamed for radioactive contamination outside the site
because of improper dumping, is the nation's sole producer of
plutonium triggers. Without the triggers, the deployment of missile
submarines and land-based missiles could be affected, because
warheads have to be replaced periodically.
   Executives, government officials and plant workers say the
problems of the facility, which opened in 1951, are serious.
However, they say EG&amp;G and Energy Secretary James Watkins are
serious about cleaning them up.
   Dave Simonson, deputy plant manager for the Energy Department,
says 60 percent of the production problems should be fixed by the
end of the year and the rest within five years.
   Critics say they welcome EG&amp;G as manager, but they are
withholding judgment on its promises to devote more effort to
safety.
   ``We've had these changes of heart repeatedly. I take it with a
grain of salt,'' said Dr. Edward A. Martell, a scientist
specializing in cell radiation damage at the National Center for
Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.
   Rockwell International Corp., which operated the plant from 1975
through last year, defends its stewardship. Jeff Charney, a
Rockwell spokesman, blamed the federal government for not providing
enough money to deal with the problems.
   But Rep. David Skaggs, D-Colo., who represents the district in
which Rocky Flats is located, said more than 100 safety problems
were identified before plutonium processing was halted, including
some so serious they had ``a potential for causing a severe injury
or fatality, potentially fatal occupational illness or loss of the
facility.''
   Safety inspectors called in by the federal government said the
plant had been lucky no major nuclear accident occurred.
   ``It's pretty sad when we're reduced to relying on luck while
running a major nuclear facility,'' Skaggs said.
   Gov. Roy Romer, who often had a stormy relationship with the
plant over safety and nuclear waste storage, praises EG&amp;G, but says
the plant should be moved from the populous Denver region.
   ``I have to believe there is no way you can allow something to
exist on the metropolitan borders that will endanger its
citizens,'' he said.
   Warner thinks the plant will be here 20 to 30 years more and
says the important thing is to get it working safely.
   EG&amp;G launched an extensive effort to retrain all 5,990 employees
at the plant. Gary Francis, director of performance based training,
said many of the workers handling plutonium didn't even know what
they were working with.
   ``What we found was a variety of training,'' he said. ``We had
to go back to some of the basics, to give them an understanding of
radiation and the principles involved, a lot of basic things they
were not presented. They were taught what, but not why.''
   Ted Tegler, who helped clean up after a 1969 fire that nearly
resulted in a runaway nuclear reaction and whose body now is
contaminated with 13 percent of the lifetime allowable dose of
plutonium, said production often took precedence over safety at the
plant. But the attitude of managers has changed, he said, and
workers are pleased.
   ``They're taking a strong line on safety. They want to know
about problems,'' he said. ``Before, people were harassed and
labeled a troublemaker, but that has changed significantly.''
   As a result, employees flooded a hot line set up for workers'
safety complaints, alerting officials to the vast array of problems.
   ``When EG&amp;G moved in, we weren't pleased with what we saw. Minor
levels of contamination were accepted as routine,'' said Joe
Majestic, director of health and safety at the plant.
   That has all changed, he said: ``If we find contamination from a
routine survey above the level allowed for free access by anyone to
that area, we now report that as an occurrence, and we work to find
it and fix it.
   ``We need to learn from our past and do a better job in the
future,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The products of the Rocky Flats nuclear
weapons plant are euphemistically called ``triggers'' or ``pits.''
   But actually, they're the components for softball-size atomic
bombs used to jump-start the fusion reaction in a nuclear warhead.
   Rocky Flats' triggers go into the 25,000 nuclear warheads in the
United States' arsenal. The warheads, which must be replaced
periodically because plutonium decays, are assembled at the Pantex
nuclear weapons plant in Amarillo, Texas.
   Some of the plutonium used at Rocky Flats comes from aging
nuclear warheads. Other plutonium comes from nuclear reactors.
   At Rocky Flats, high amounts of electricity or acid baths are
used to melt or separate the plutonium from other elements. The
metal is packaged into disks, which then are machined and formed
into balls that become the heart of a nuclear weapon.
   The actual shape of the trigger is a secret, because some
geometric shapes produce better explosions than others.
   The triggers are shipped to Texas, where Pantex workers attach
high-speed explosives designed to detonate instantaneously, causing
an inward blast. Without simultaneous detonation, the plutonium
would simply explode, scattering radiation but causing no atomic
reaction.
   The plutonium and explosives are placed near a core of hydrogen.
In an atomic explosion, the plutonium undergoes fission, its atoms
splitting in a chain reaction that creates extremely high
temperatures which ignite a source of neturons, such as
plutonium-beryllium. The neutron source then sets off a combination
of deuterium and tritium, fusing hydrogen and setting off a
reaction similar to that which powers the sun.
   The power of a hydrogen warhead is measured in megatons _ the
explosive force of a million tons of TNT.
   The most modern U.S. missiles carry several warheads of about a
quarter to a half megaton each, and some B-52 bombs range up to 9
megatons. By contrast, the total power of the bombs dropped on
Germany during World War II totaled 1.3 megatons.

   Since it opened in 1951, the Rocky Flats
nuclear weapons plant has been the scene of two major fires that
allowed radioactivity to escape into the surrounding region.
   No one knows how much, but officials say they don't think the
contamination was serious.
   The most recent fire was on Mother's Day in 1969.
   It began in a glove box, used to handle highly radioactive
plutonium, and quickly spread to plutonium in other boxes.
Firefighters contained the blaze, but damage totaled $70 million.
   The building in which it occurred is ``contaminated to
infinity,'' meaning radiation levels inside the building could not
be calculated.
   Contamination outside the building was small, officials say, but
the threat of widespread contamination was immense. Federal
investigators concluded that only the heroic efforts of the
firefighters prevented a complete loss of the building and its
contents, and a major release of plutonium into the environment,
with the city of Denver only 16 miles away.
   The investigation found heat detectors had been mistakenly
insulated during remodeling and did not detect the fire until it
was out of control.
   A similar problem had occurred 12 years earlier, when plant
workers covered up heat detectors because they were frustrated by
too many false alarms.
   According to a report compiled by plant managers, that fire, on
Sept. 11, 1957, began in molds used to make plutonium detonators.
An explosion blew out 620 air filters, allowing a cloud of
radioactive waste to escape and drift toward Denver.
   The report said the radiation released was minimal, although no
determination ever was made on how much plutonium was missing.
   Officials say documentation on both fires is skimpy, and they
have no idea how much radiation was released. The plant's new
manager, EG&amp;G Inc., has set up teams to study records and try to
determine how much radioactive material escaped.

   The Downey-Stark proposal would cost more than $5 billion over
five years and would provide extra unemployment and health benefits
to about 200,000 workers _ far fewer, Downey noted, than the number
expected to be displaced.
   ``I think it's inadequate. It should cover more people,'' Downey
said. ``But we don't have the votes.''
   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., called the measure to ``a domestic
Marshall plan,'' akin to the post-war European reconstruction
program financed by the United States.
   Republicans, even some from states that would benefit from the
proposal, immediately criticized the legislation as unfair to
unemployed workers who lose their jobs for reasons unrelated to
federal policy but who are no less needy.
   Republican Rep. Rod Chandler, whose home state of Washington
faces job losses due to the new spotted owl policy, called the
legislation an ``ill-conceived, hastily slapped together proposal''
that would burden the Medicaid system with the extra health
benefits.
   ``It leaves out those who have lost their jobs due to other
causes,'' Chandler said. ``Are they not worthy too?''
   Republicans on the subcommittee also made clear their concern
that the program would drain scarce federal revenue. Downey and
Stark proposed financing the measure through continuance of a 0.2
percent federal unemployment tax which is due to expire this year.
   The Bush administration also piled on, saying that existing
programs already provide adequate job retraining and jobless
benefits.
   Labor Department administrator James Van Erden said the Bush
administration ``believes that singling out certain groups of
workers for special treatment based on the cause of their
dislocation is inequitable and inappropriate.''
   Despite the GOP criticism, the idea of helping workers hurt by
government policies has gained considerable support on Capitol Hill
since last March when the Senate narrowly rejected a proposal by
Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. Byrd's plan would have provided hefty
unemployment benefits to coal miners laid off if tougher clean air
standards led to reduced coal burning.
   Since then, new and increasingly elaborate measures have been
proposed to provide extra jobless benefits but to a larger pool of
workers than West Virginia's coal miners.
   ``The Byrd amendment was a much bigger entitlement and a much
smaller population _ which was the problem,'' said William
Cunningham, a lobbyist for the AFL-CIO and a supporter of the
Downey-Stark proposal. ``This is not geographic. ``It is actually
governmental actions that are causing these job dislocations. The
number of regions involved have to be taken into account.''
   Sens. Joseph Lieberman and Christopher Dodd, both Connecticut
Democrats, proposed legislation last week that would cost about $1
billion a year and would include a provision ensuring that laid-off
defense workers get at least a substantial fraction of their former
salaries while unemployed.
   A separate House proposal designed to ease the burden of defense
cuts would cost an estimated $200 million a year.

   Sales of new homes surged 8 percent in June,
the sharpest increase since November, the government said. Many
analysts said the government report indicates the sluggish housing
industry has bottomed out.
   The Commerce Department said Tuesday new home sales totaled a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 581,000 units after posting a
revised 2.3 percent gain in May. May sales first were reported last
month to have risen just 0.4 percent, the first advance in five
months.
   Despite the increase in June, new homes sales for the first six
months of 1990 have fallen 9.7 percent below sales of the first
half of 1989 when they totaled 340,000 units.

   As the Federal Reserve's anti-inflation policy
slows the economy to a crawl, even a standstill and maybe a
reversal, the questions are becoming more numerous.
   Why, for example, do supporters of the Fed's go-slow policy
believe that growth beyond 2.5 percent a year is inflationary, when
it averaged nearly 4 percent a year with only 2.5 percent inflation
in the 1950s and 1960s?
   And when, more recently, Japan's economy has consistently grown
by 4.5 percent to 5 percent a year without severe inflationary side
effects?
   Why do they believe that inflation threatens when the factory
operating rate approaches 84 percent of capacity, when that was the
norm in that same 20- year period?
   Why shouldn't growth be seen as the solution to economic
problems, rather than a creator of them? Doesn't experience show
that sustained growth would reduce indebtedness at all levels,
raise exports, increase income?
   John Wright has been among those questioners, not just of recent
policy, but of the Fed's policies over many years. He has written
and lectured on the subject and has personally carried his views
directly to the Fed officials.
   Growth, he says, is not a dirty word. ``This nation's policy
makers need to realize that growth is not only good, it is also
inherently non-inflationary,'' he says, adding but one
qualification:
   ``So long as a reasonable share of it can be and is reinvested
at reasonable capital costs in productive capacity.''
   That is, so long as we the producers don't become just greedy
consumers and eat up everything we grow but instead, like good
potato farmers, put away some of the crop to continue seeding the
farm.
   Wright is the founder of Wright Investors' Service, a
Bridgeport, Conn., firm operating internationally in money
management, financial advice and corporate and financial
information.
   In an address prepared for the American Banker and Bond Buyer
publications, Wright stated that again and again in the 1970s and
'80s the Fed misread the causes of inflation, and then tried
remedies that badly damaged the economy.
   Inflation during those years was largely ``cost-push,'' Wright
said. It was ``imported'' inflation; price-factors such as OPEC oil
were its cause. But the Fed, he said, misread it as domestic
``demand-pull'' inflation.
   The latter inflation, caused by demand that exceeded the
economy's capacity to produce, is correctible by restricting the
domestic money supply. The Fed did that _ for an inflation that
simply didn't exist.
   The result of these restrictions, said Wright, were soaring
interest rates and reduced production, which further exacerbated
rising product costs.
   ``During this period, the Federal Reserve Board's failure to
recognize the non-inflationary growth potential of the U.S. economy
caused three significant recessions in the space of the 10 years
1973-1982,'' he stated.
   And with this result: ``The lost national income and foregone
federal tax revenues which resulted produced the $100 billion
federal budget deficits which have plagued the U.S. annually since
1982.''
   Wright's message to the Fed: Please recognize that recession,
not inflation, is the greater risk to the U.S. economy. Ease
monetary policy. Do so quickly and significantly, breaking with the
too-little-too-late Fed tradition.
   ``My prescription for the ailing U.S. economy is much lower
interest rates,'' Wright said. Lower rates, he said, would spur
growth, particularly for capital investments in plants and
equipment.
   The Fed fears lower rates would spur inflationary demand. Wright
says they underestimate the economy's potential.
   Increased investment, he reminds the Fed, could mean expanded
supply as well as expanded demand. The production-consumption
balance could be maintained, and inflation restrained.
   The economy could grow, jobs could be created, exports spurred,
the balance of payments improved, tax revenues enhanced and debts
repaid.

   The computer industry's shift away from mid-sized
machines to more powerful and popular small machines has led to
dismal financial reports from computer companies here and cost
thousands of jobs, analysts say.
   Nationally, computer sales have been in a slump, and the
downturn has particularly damaged sales of companies that make
mid-size computers.
   Massachusetts has suffered heavily by the new industry trends,
especially several large manufacturers that focused on mid-size
computers. Each company has tried to make adjustments, but the news
of the last week reflects how difficult this transition can be.
   _Digital Equipment Corp. announced its first-ever quarterly loss
last Wednesday and said it plans to cut up to 6,000 jobs in
addition to a previous cutback of 3,000.
   _Data General Corp. reported its fifth consecutive quarterly
loss Thursday. The company already has cut its workforce from a
high of 18,000 employees several years ago to 11,710. A company
spokesman said more reductions cannot be ruled out, although there
are no such immediate plans.
   _Wang Laboratories Inc., which has been bleeding red ink for
months, announced another losing quarter on Monday and said it
expects to cut about 1,000 jobs. Overall, the company will have cut
its payroll by more than 8,000 jobs since July 1, 1989, when Wang
employed more than 28,000 people.
   Overall, Massachusetts has lost more than 23,000 high-tech
manufacturing jobs since May 1988, according to state figures. As
of May 1990, there were 215,300 high-tech jobs.
   Marc Schulman, a stock analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said the
underlying cause of each company's trouble is the same _ the shift
away from mid-size computers.
   ``But the position of the various companies is quite
different,'' he said.
   For example, Digital has a strong presence as the world's second
largest computer company, and has come out with many new products
to be more consistent with the market.
   But Wang, which has slashed its costs and does not have as
strong a presence, needs to boost its revenues, analysts said.
   ``Once you get behind the eight ball, it's hard to get out in
front of it,'' Schulman said of Wang's future, adding that the
company needs to find new markets.
   Wang is betting part of its future on image processing, a system
allowing computers to store the actual images of documents. This
technology can be used, for example, by insurance companies that
want to keep copies of police reports on record.
   ``We view it as an emerging technology,'' said Frank Ryan, a
Wang spokesman. ``We would hope it would explode, but I'm not sure
it will. In actuality it will build.''
   Wang officials believe they have ``turned the corner,'' and hope
to show profits in the new fiscal year that began July 1.
   At Data General, officials have moved aggressively to shrink the
company and market products to conform with industry standards _ a
growing segment of the computer industry, said spokesman Ray Thomas.
   ``In a world of standards, you can achieve differentiation by
being most attuned to the standards ... by being the most standard
among standards,'' Thomas said.
   ``We believe we've taken the right steps toward structuring the
company for the long term,'' he said.
   Digital has had a multi-faceted strategy, with a big push on
making products that link together computers from other companies.
   ``All of our product lines have been refreshed,'' said Mark
Steinkrauss, a Digital spokesman.
   Yet aside from adapting to changes within the computer market,
companies must also contend with a soft national economy, which has
made customers more apprehensive about making expensive purchases,
Steinkrauss said.
   Eventually, the result of this transformation should be further
consolidation within the industry, he said.
   ``Invariably, as there is growth, it attracts more players,'' he
said. ``But demand is satisfied, and then a shakeout occurs.''

   Watch people play in the sand. Get your picture
taken with Minnie Mouse. Knock the eight ball into the pocket with
a billiards champ.
   In the frantic competition to lure convention business, the
pitches are anything but conventional.
   Everything from a 9-ton sand castle to women in harem costumes
from the Trump Taj Mahal are on display through today at the 70th
annual meeting of the American Society of Association Executives,
the people who decide where associations hold their annual meetings.
   At stake is $30 billion a year in business.
   Hundreds of convention bureaus, hotels, airlines and tourist
attractions from around the world are wooing the meeting planners
at Chicago's McCormick Place.
   San Diego's exhibit drew a small crowd of executives who watched
two people mold 9 tons of sand into a huge castle, with a koala
bear and elephant sculpted on one side to represent the San Diego
Zoo.
   The exhibit succeeds at what seems to be the main point of many
of the exhibits _ keeping a captive audience.
   ``We have people coming back four, five and six times to see how
the sand sculpture is progressing. It's a real draw,'' said Kelly
Nelson, national sales manager for the San Diego Convention and
Visitors Bureau.
   At the Miami exhibit, meeting planners were drawn by eels and
rays and colorful fish in two huge aquariums. The fish tanks were
set amid lush tropical greenery and posh furniture in a small
building set up within the convention center. A tuxedo-clad piano
player performed in a corner while executives relaxed on couches or
wandered to the fish tanks.
   The building alone cost $180,000, said Merret Stierheim,
president of the Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau.
   ``It is not an inexpensive sales method,'' Stierheim said. But
given that visitors spend $5.7 billion in Miami each year, he said,
``This is worth it.''
   A few rows over, the lobby of a Hilton Hotel was partly
recreated in a two-story exhibit complete with two curved
staircases. A uniformed maid rushed out periodically to wipe
fingerprints off the brass handrails.
   ``We wanted to make a statement,'' said Bob Moore, senior vice
president of sales at Hilton Hotels Corp., which has been toting
the $125,000 display around the country for four years.
   The Milwaukee Convention and Visitors Bureau lured executives
with the chance to challenge Steve Mizerak, Billiard Hall of Fame
member and former world pocket billiards champion.
   Crowds gathered as one executive after another challenged
Mizerak and lost, only to be replaced by another.
   ``Then, while the customers are waiting, we start talking to
them,'' said Dave Nolan, Milwaukee bureau president.
   Many meeting planners said they decided their convention sites
before seeing the exhibits. And few of the exhibitors were sure how
many gawkers would actually sign up for a meeting.
   But that didn't cool the warmth of their welcomes.
   Executives visiting the Birmingham, England, booth were invited
to sit down for tea and scones.
   At the Walt Disney Co. exhibit, convention-goers stopped and
smiled for souvenir pictures with Minnie and Mickey Mouse.
   And there were smiles, too, at the Pittsburgh booth, as meeting
planners were handed 2-ounce bottles of Heinz Ketchup.
   Debra Smucker, national sales director for the Greater
Pittsburgh Convention and Visitors Bureau, said she touts the
city's compact downtown and central location.
   But first she warms up her audience with gifts of ketchup and
tiny, green pickle-shaped pins bearing the logo of Pittsburgh-based
H.J. Heinz Co.
   ``Its a good opportunity to stop people as they go by,'' she
said.

<HEAD>Scientists Change Pigs' Diet, Reduce Saturated Fat Ratio in Meat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists say they have taken another
step toward ``designer pigs'' for health-conscious consumers by
creating lean pork with less saturated fat than today's cuts.
   The key is the diet of hogs, who are fed whole soybeans cooked
in a special processor known as an extruder, said scientists at the
University of Illinois and the Harlan E. Moore Heart Research
Foundation.
   The unusual feed ingredient produced pork with a significantly
higher ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fat: a 50 percent
improvement in pork chops and a 100 percent improvement in bacon.
   ``We can produce healthier pork and do it in an economical
way,'' said Dennis Leszczynski, a dietician and food scientist at
the heart foundation in Champaign. ``And there are no important
differences in animal performance, meat taste, texture, processing
or storage.''
   Peter Bechtel, a University of Illinois meat scientist who
worked with Leszczynski on the project, prepared a report on the
findings for today's meeting of the American Society of Animal
Science in Ames, Iowa.
   ``Pigs are like humans. We're all a product of the kind of fat
we eat,'' Bechtel said. ``So, we change the ratio of
polyunsaturated fat in the pork by altering the fat that goes in
the hogs.''
   Because the final product may cost more to produce, the
researchers said, farmers must sell processors and consumers on the
health value of their new pork to justify a higher price.
   Leszczynski said farmers have had few incentives to deliver a
leaner hog to market. The price often has been based only on live
weight. Bechtel said some processors now are paying a premium to
farmers who deliver lean pigs.
   ``The key is testing the market to see how much the consumer is
willing to pay for healthier pork,'' said Leszczynski.
   The American Heart Association says the ratio of polyunsaturated
fat to saturated fat should be 1-to-1, said Leszczynski. He said
feeding extruded soybeans improved the ratio from .28-to-1 to
.43-to-1 in pork chops and from .25-to-1 to .50-to-1 in bacon.
   Though the pork ration improved, it still is not the .83-to-1
ratio found in a lean chicken breast.
   ``We're getting closer,'' Leszczynski said. ``The challenge now
is to see how much higher we can go without adversely affecting the
meat quality or the economics.''
   The study involved 160 pigs. Some had a diet that included 20
percent extruded soubeans for the six weeks before slaughter.
   Conventional hog rations contain corn and soybean meal. The
scientists substituted the extruded whole soybeans for the meal in
an effort to retain soy oil which is relatively high in
polyunsaturated fat.
   Research at the International Soybean Program at the University
of Illinois has shown that extrusion not only leaves the oil in the
final product but that it also destroys the natural digestive
inhibitors in soybeans.
   Bechtel said most Illinois farmers already have soybeans. An
extruder could cost about $8,000 and could be shared by a group of
farmers.
   ``Why couldn't a farmer take his soybeans, have a little
extruder and feed them directly to his pigs instead of selling the
beans to a processor and buying back the meal?'' Bechtel said.
``Producing this kind of pork is an economic possibility.''
   Some pork producers already deliver leaner animals to market by
selecting breeds with less fat and by slaughtering them before they
get too heavy. That process has created pork cuts that are 97
percent lean.
   Bechtel said his project indicated the composition of the
remaining fat could be improved.
   ``Now we're talking about custom-made pork _ designer pigs,'' he
said. ``They won't all be alike anymore.''

<HEAD>Safety Board Spreads Out Blame For Biggest Spill</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Recasts grafs 1-4. Also moving on general news wires.</NOTE>

   Federal safety officials insist that the Exxon
Valdez captain was drunk at the time of the Alaskan oil spill. They
also blame his third mate, the company that hired them, the Coast
Guard and port authorities for the disaster.
   Despite Capt. Joseph Hazelwood's acquittal by an Alaskan jury
and the Coast Guard's dismissal last week of drunkenness charges
against him, the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday
that his drinking was part of the probable cause of the nation's
worst oil spill.
   Board members said the Coast Guard needs to develop a more
efficient system to monitor and control boat traffic in critical
areas.
   ``One of the lessons of this accident is that if we had a good
vessel traffic system, it probably would not have happened,'' said
board member Jim Burnett. ``The same or worse results are possible
in one of our other ports. I think it's a tragedy that we've had
this wholesale neglect of the vessel traffic system.''
   But the board also cited Exxon Corp. for failing to provide its
biggest oil tanker with ``a fit master and a rested and sufficient
crew.''
   And it said third mate Gregory Cousins failed to properly
maneuver the vessel after he was left at the helm, the Coast Guard
failed to control traffic in the ice-clogged sound and the state of
Alaska failed to provide an effective pilot's service to guide
ships out of the sound.
   The board voted 4-0 to adopt the five-part probable cause and a
long list of conclusions and recommendations resulting from the
March 29, 1989, spill of 11 million gallons into Prince William
Sound.
   ``The probable cause reflects the decision of the board that in
addition to the alcohol impairment of the ship's master, there are
safety issues of equal importance,'' said Burnett.
   Board Chairman James Kolstad said the NTSB hopes its report,
which included 36 safety recommendations, will help prevent future
spills.
   The board's analyses carry no force of law and, by statute,
cannot be used in court cases. But they often serves as guidelines
for congressional, administrative and private action.
   Hazelwood's lawyer, Thomas Russo, said the safety board members
acted ``like they dropped off the moon'' in again accusing
Hazelwood of being drunk. Twenty-one witnesses at Hazelwood's trial
testified that he was sober, Russo said, and authorities botched
the blood tests showing alcohol in his system more than 10 hours
after the accident.
   ``Their conclusions are not founded in the evidence,'' Russo
said.
   The board said eyewitnesses, medical tests and an unusual study
of Hazelwood's speech indicated he was drunk when the ship ran
aground.
   Medical investigator Merritt Birky said calculations based on
blood tests of Hazelwood show that he would have had a blood
alcohol content of .2 percent at the time of the grounding, which
is five times the legal intoxication level under Coast Guard rules.
   Birky said he believes Hazelwood's alcohol level shows he
probably was drinking on board, which is against Exxon rules.
Hazelwood denies drinking on board, although he has admitted
drinking prior to boarding the vessel.
   He is appealing a conviction in Alaska of one misdemeanor charge
of negligent discharge of oil for which he was fined $50,000 and
ordered to spend 1,000 hours cleaning Alaskan beaches.
   Last week, the Coast Guard dismissed charges of drunkenness and
misconduct against Hazelwood but suspended his license as a ship's
master for nine months after he pleaded no contest to breaking
rules involving drinking alcohol prior to duty and leaving the
bridge.
   ``This is the largest and costliest accident the safety board
has ever investigated,'' Kolstad said in opening the meeting. He
said $2 billion had been spent cleaning up the spill.
   Investigators also raised concerns about Hazelwood's attempts to
move the vessel off the reef as it was spilling oil, saying it
could have caused greater problems.
   ``He was going into an unknown area where he couldn't have known
whether it would remain upright or capsize,'' said chief
investigator William Woody.

<HEAD>Entertainment Giant Unveils Plans for Ocean Theme Park</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Walt Disney Co. has unveiled its
master plan for a 350-acre, $2-billion oceanside resort and theme
park in Long Beach with everything from five luxury hotels to the
world's biggest aquarium.
   The Port Disney resort would also lure travelers to a pair of
transportation relics owned by the entertainment giant _ the Queen
Mary and the Spruce Goose museum pieces.
   Burbank-based Disney wants to build another theme park either in
Long Beach or adjacent to Disneyland in Anaheim.
   ``Disney is committed to building a second major theme park in
Southern California,'' Alan Epstein, vice president of Disney
Development Co., said Tuesday.
   The 70-page preliminary plan was submitted to Long Beach
officials in compliance with existing agreements. There are also
discussions with the city of Anaheim and a location decision isn't
expected until next year.
   Epstein said a final decision will be ``based on community
support, government approvals, public sector participation, and
theme park and resort economics.''
   Some Long Beach residents expressed unhappiness over the
proposal, citing transportation woes and the potential for
overbearing political and economic clout on the part of Disney.
They also object to spending taxpayer dollars to help Disney.
   ``Why in the world would we want to give money to a company that
has more money than they know what to do with?'' said Karen
Pilcher, president of the Rose Park Neighborhood Group.
   But city officials say Long Beach needs the money Disney will
bring. ``The residents should take an active part, and I applaud
their concern. But we should be careful to keep our eye on the
bull's-eye,'' said Councilman Wallace Edgerton. ``To solve problems
like crime, traffic or the needs of the poor, it takes money. And
that's the bottom line: Disney will bring money to this city.''

   Share prices were higher at midday Wednesday on
London's Stock Exchange, helped by gains in oil shares.
   Much of the gains could be attributed to the oil sector, which
has been active amid the increasing tension on the border between
Iraq and Kuwait, dealers said.
   The market was generally quiet, however, with little news to
spark interest, traders said.
   At midday, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 13.3 points, or 0.6 percent, at 2,339.5.
   Volume came to 237.8 million shares at midday, compared with
176.7 million shares at the same time Tuesday.

   In these days of sluggish real estate markets,
the always-dicey process of selling one home and buying another can
be especially hard on one's peace of mind.
   Even under the best of circumstances this kind of deal takes
fast footwork, a bit like trying to step from one moving boat to
the other without falling into the water.
   Now, thanks to gluts in many local markets around the country,
it may be easier than ever to get stuck with two properties and two
mortgage commitments _the new one you just acquired and the old one
you can't unload.
   The risk is compounded by the tax laws, which let you defer
capital gains tax on any profit from your old home only if you
reinvest the money in your new place within a specified time.
   The rule, as summed up by the accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Young
in the 1990 Arthur Young Tax Guide: ``You must buy, or build, and
live in another house within two years before or two years after
the date of sale of your old home to postpone the tax.''
   As they are wont to do in such matters, the authorities have
construed this language strictly, rejecting virtually all pleas for
exceptions no matter how good the excuse.
   Was construction of the new home unavoidably delayed by fire,
bad weather, zoning dispute or other circumstance beyond your
control? Sorry.
   ``What is more, the house must be substantially complete when
you move in,'' points out the Personal Tax Adviser published by
another big accounting firm, Price Waterhouse. ``You cannot pitch a
tent on the foundation and claim you occupy your new home.''
   In view of this, Price Waterhouse recommends, ``include a clause
in your construction contract that calls for your contractor to pay
any taxes you owe if construction is delayed beyond the 24-month
limit.''
   On the other hand, if the new house is bought and occupied but
the old one won't sell, it may be hard to find anybody to take the
tax burden off your shoulders.
   As Deloitte &amp; Touche accountants put it in a current report on
the subject: ``in a slow real estate market a timing problem may
develop.''
   One way to try to forestall this problem is to get a solid buyer
signed up for the old home before you commit yourself to buy a new
one, if it's possible to manage the sequence that way.
   If you can't follow that script, the experts say you still may
have a couple of fallback positions when an old home goes begging
for buyers.
   Maybe, suggests Deloitte &amp; Touche, you can sell it to a friendly
but separate entity such as an incorporated business you own or an
employer that is transferring you.
   ``The sale must be bona fide and entered into on an arm's-length
basis,'' the firm cautions.
   Alternatively, suppose you must rent your old house for a while
until you sell it, in order to keep your cash flow from running
dry. Have you converted the home into a rental property that isn't
eligible for tax deferral when you sell it?
   No, you may still get the break, the experts say, as long as you
meet the other requirements.
   Says Price Waterhouse: ``The courts have ruled that temporarily
renting out your old house because of a depressed real estate
market will not prevent you from deferring your gain.''

<HEAD>More Manufacturers Selling Their Own Stuff, So Who Needs
Department Stores?</HEAD>
<HEAD>Graphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Vacationers bound for summer getaways will notice something has
happened to out-of-the-way tourist spots. Many have become
miniature shopping meccas catering to devoted bargain seekers.
   Clusters of shops carrying discounted designer duds have
sprouted up all over the country. More manufacturers whose wares
are normally peddled by mainstream retailers are striking out on
their own.
   Outlet complexes are thriving in areas frequented by tourists,
who have the time to browse for good buys. Busloads of pricewise
shoppers regularly pour in. Elsewhere, outlets grouped near major
thoroughfares are catching the attention of passers-by.
   The trend has ominous implications for traditional retailing. It
won't run all regular stores out of business. But it does mean more
competition in a saturated industry already fraught with fierce
battling for market share.
   Sales at outlets are growing faster than general retail
revenues, although they still account for a small portion of
retailing.
   Outlets generated nearly $6 billion in sales last year,
according to Value Retail News, a Clearwater, Fla.-based
publication that tracks the industry. By contrast, a single
retailer, industry biggie Sears, Roebuck and Co., alone had 1989
sales of over $30 billion.
   ``People like the excitement of shopping in a factory outlet.
They like the prices,'' says Lynn Ellsworth, president of Company
Stores Development Corp., a Brentwood, Tenn.-based builder of
outlet malls and a pioneer in the field.
   Manufacturers have several incentives to sell directly to
consumers. It allows them to control the process of getting rid of
leftovers rather than risk problems that can crop up when they
unload merchandise on liquidators.
   Close-out chains and off-price merchants _ which absorb excess
apparel and sell it at discount _ often compete for customers with
nearby department stores and other regular retailers.
   Manufacturers usually make sure their own outlets are far away
from major shopping hubs so they don't jeopardize sales of their
labels selling at full-price stores or upset relations with
retailers, their primary customers.
   ``We purposely stay away from traditional retailers,'' notes
Benard Holtzman, president of apparel designer Harve Benard Ltd.
   Clothing companies, accessory makers and others that go into
retailing must tred carefully. The last thing they want is for
outlet customers to return home gloating to their local retailer
about the great deal they got.
   Women's apparel powerhouse Liz Claiborne Inc. has located its 22
outlet stores 45 minutes to an hour away from regular retailers
selling its label.
   Ritzy Ralph Lauren's lines are sold at discount outlets
deliberately situated 90 miles to 120 miles away from places where
the Polo collection is sold in full-price, company-owned boutiques
and department stores.
   Nevertheless, the issue is so touchy that manufacturers don't
exactly go out of their way to publicize their involvement in the
outlet business. Some even disguise their name, meaning customers
can't tell who owns an outlet. Pricy Izod-Lacoste sportswear is
sold at outlets called Fashion Flair, for instance.
   Irked by the trend, the National Shoe Retailers Association
recently adopted a resolution expressing disapproval of the
proliferation of company-owned factory outlets. Independent shoe
retailers are up in arms because, they say, manufacturers are
bypassing them in channeling merchandise to outlets.
   Association President Bill Boettge said the group believes
independent shoe sellers are being treated unfairly. He said the
group isn't trying to start a national boycott but some association
members are refusing to carry merchandise of manufacturers that
operate their own outlets.
   From a manufacturer's point of view, it makes good business
sense to look for new channels of distribution. Upheaval in the
retail industry, intensifed by the bankruptcy filings of big name
chains, including the parent companies of Bloomingdale's, The Bon
Marche, Lazarus and others, has made manufacturers nervous about
depending on department stores to market merchandise.
   No longer mere havens for fashion has-beens, manufacturers
increasingly use their factory outlets to showcase merchandise.
   Phillips-Van Heusen Corp. reportedly does half its business in
its own outlets, marketing Van Heusen Shirts and shoes from its
G.H. Bass &amp; Co. division.
   Commercial developers say projects involving outlets tend to get
financial backing more easily in these tight money days than
construction of traditional retail centers.
   Although lenders have tightened up their practices after the
savings and loan debacle, they're still willing to support sound
deals. Conventional retailers may be on the ropes but factory
outlets look like they're on stable ground, according to Richard
Echikson, chairman of Millburn, N.J.-based Retail Consultants Inc.,
which helps clients assess potential retail investments.
   ``There is an increasing interest in the financial community and
development community in true factory outlet malls,'' says Echikson.
   With financial backing, an increasing number of outlets has gone
upscale, offering entertainment and other amenities. The Woodbury
Common in Central Valley, N.Y., for instance, recreates a village
setting.
   Malls are growing bigger, too. Benderson Development Co., out of
Buffalo, N.Y., plans to open what it claims will be the world's
largest manufacturers' outlet mall late next year in downtown
Niagara Falls.
   Not all outlets are in the middle of nowhere or even near prime
tourist attractions. Many outlets have been moving closer to
metropolitan areas as more manufacturers get into the act.
   According to Value Retail News, the number of outlet chains has
mushroomed, and last year more were opened than ever before in a
single year. By the middle of this year, there were about 350
chains in operation, up from 264 at the start of 1989.
   The popularity is expected to continue as consumers save more of
their incomes than they did during the free-spending '80s. Aging
baby boomers are keen on bargains now that they are tucking away
spare dollars for their tots' educations.
   Charles Bloom, chairman of the Chelsea Group, a New Jersey-based
developer, owner and operator of factory outlet shopping centers,
says the concept complements traditional retailing and will never
supplant it.
   ``Without retail, there is no wholesale,'' he notes. ``You
couldn't buy a bargain if it wasn't selling for a higher price
somewhere else.''

   They call him ``Mr. Turnaround,'' a
wonderboy who rescues sinking retailers, then moves on to the next
hopeless case.
   But as the new chief executive officer of Ames Department Stores
Inc., Stephen L. Pistner faces his most formidable challenge yet:
leading the nation's fourth largest retailer out of a Chapter 11
bankruptcy filing.
   If he pulls it off, his reward could amount to a tidy $9 million
_ $1.5 million a year in salary for three years, plus incentives
worth $4.5 million.
   Pistner (pronounced pize-ner), a man known as much for his
robust ego as for his retail savvy, says he's worth every penny.
   ``I know that I'm highly paid and I know people can't really
relate to that, but for those of us who can save a $5 billion
company, for those stockholders and banks, this is a bargain,''
said the 58-year-old Pistner, his voice and face becoming animated.
   Pistner already has engineered remarkable recoveries at both
Target Stores and Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., analysts said. There's
also the McCrory Corp. of New York, operator of a large chain of
variety stores, where he's credited with interjecting new
merchandising ideas into an already successful formula.
   Pistner's taste for adventure extends to off-hour hobbies like
flying, sailing and white-water canoeing. His more refined
interests include collecting art, ancient glass and antique cars.
   He took the helm at Ames April 30, five days after the retailer,
listing $1.4 billion in liabilities and cut off by its major
suppliers, filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11
of federal bankruptcy laws. Much of the chain's troubles have been
blamed on its $778 million acquisition of 392 Zayre stores in 1988.
   Pistner's first three months on the job have shown a
true-to-form Pistner doing what he does best: mercilessly shedding
unprofitable operations and replacing top managers with new blood.
   He is now in the process of closing 221 stores _ about one-third
of the chain's 679 stores _ a move that will cut 18,000 workers and
streamline the now-rambling Ames into a Northeast corridor chain.
   Pistner pioneered the concept of ``power departments'' _ stores
within stores that specialize in specific kinds of merchandise,
like clothing or major appliances.
   For all of his salesmanship finesse, Pistner also has a
reputation for a brash, impersonal management style that has
alienated both top brass and sales clerks.
   At Ames, he already has named a ``chairman's shopper'' to rove
around Ames stores incognito and snitch on employees who are not
treating customers well.
   ``He's in a hurry. He doesn't have time or much tolerance for
ignorance,'' said Norman McMillan, a Chicago retail consultant who
worked with Pistner at both Target and Montgomery Ward.
   Another consultant who has known Pistner for years said, ``His
attitude is, if you're not with him, you're against him, and he'll
trample right over you.''
   Pistner's roots in retailing go back to 1953, when he started as
a salesman in St. Paul, Minn., for a small electronics company. He
worked his way up and eventually bought the company.
   In 1970, Pistner sold the business to Dayton-Hudson Corp., the
Minneapolis-based retailer. Three years later, Dayton-Hudson picked
Pistner to take over the helm at its Target stores, which had been
a big money-loser for years.
   Under Pistner, Target's profits soared within a few years as the
chain became the first so-called ``upscale discounter,'' stores
with well-known brand names and trendy interior designs to compete
with department stores. Target is now the nation's third-largest
discounter, after K mart and Wal-Mart.
   After his success with the Target chain, Pistner was named
president and chief operating officer of Dayton-Hudson in 1977. He
left four years later to take on another daunting task _ rescuing
Montgomery Ward, a struggling unit of Mobil Oil Corp. Mobil had
lost about $600 million on the retailer in its 10 years as owner.
   Under Pistner, Montgomery Ward closed 50 stores, upgraded the
quality of the remaining 375 outlets, and focused on its
more-successful products.
   Within two years, Mobil turned a $40 million profit, its first
since 1979.
   Pistner left Montgomery Ward in 1985 to become chairman of
McCrory. He left the company in 1988 for undisclosed reasons. Some
analysts say he and owner Meshulam Riklis _ both forceful men with
powerful egos _ were unable to work together well.
   Pistner has never tackled a company in bankruptcy proceedings
and some analysts give him only a 50-50 chance of saving Ames.
   ``He's highly regarded in the field, but the question is, is the
situation so far gone that it would be impossible for any human
being to fix this scrambled egg?'' said Alan Millstein, a New York
publisher of a monthly newsletter for retailers.
   Pistner doesn't share such doubts.
   ``I have rebuilt, reconstructed and redefined almost every
retail business,'' he said. ``When there's a problem, I know how to
repair it.''

   The stock market was mixed today as investors
studied new signs of sluggishness in business activity.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 14.35 to 2,919.55
in the first half hour of trading.
   Other, broader indicators were mixed to slightly lower, however.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 22.55 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that the index of
leading economic indicators was unchanged in June, rather than
posting the small increase many analysts had been expecting.
   That reinforced expectations in the financial world that
economic growth was likely to remain meager at best in the near
future.
   In that environment, hopes have flagged on Wall Street for any
impending improvement in corporate earnings.
   But at the same time, interest rates have moved lower of late.
In today's credit market activity, prices of long-term government
bonds rose about $5 for each $1,000 in face value, lowering their
yields to the 8.36 percent-8.37 percent range.
   Eastman Kodak was a standout gainer, jumping 3 to 41\. The
company reported second-quarter earnings of $1.19 a share, up from
24 cents in the corresponding period last year.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks stood
at 194.60, unchanged from Tuesday. At the American Stock Exchange,
the market value index was down .07 at 353.53.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 12.13 to
2,905.20.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 10 to 9 on the NYSE,
with 800 up, 720 down and 469 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 173.81 million shares, against 146.47
million in the previous session.

   Computer giant IBM today said it will form a new
subsidiary for its U.S. typewriter, keyboard and some printer
businesses and intends the buyout firm Clayton &amp; Dubilier Inc. to
become the unit's majority owner.
   An announcement released from the Armonk, N.Y. headquarters of
International Business Machines Corp. said a plan is being studied
to include the remainder of its worldwide information products
business in the alliance with Clayton &amp; Dubilier.
   The announcement didn't contain any financial details of the
planned arrangements with Clayton &amp; Dubilier. Published reports
have estimated that a buyout of the IBM businesses could cost about
$2.5 billion.
   IBM spokesman Glenn Rossman said negotiations on a final
agreement are expected to conclude by the end of the year. Until
then, no information will be disclosed on how much Clayton &amp;
Dubilier will pay IBM or what size stake it will acquire, he said.
   Wall Street took the announcement in stride because there has
been widespread publicity about IBM's possible intention to
reconfigure itself. IBM stock gained 12{ cents to $111.87{ in early
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The new U.S. company, made up mainly of IBM's information
products business operations in Lexington, Ky., and Boulder, Colo.,
is expected to reduce the current work force by 1,200. By the end
of the year, the company will have 3,500 to 4,000 employees, IBM
said.
   IBM Vice President Marvin L. Mann will become the chief
executive officer of the new company.
   Mann said making the information products operation a
stand-alone business will enable it to concentrate its resources on
expanding sales.
   ``We intend to increase our investment on advertising and
promotion, greatly improve our dealer support programs and
incorporate a sales force with information products as its only
priority,'' he said.
   Steps are being taken to assure that employees are treated
fairly, he said.
   Clayton &amp; Dubilier Chairman Martin H. Dubilier said: ``Our
intention would be to build on IBM's reputation for quality and
performance, while developing more aggressive long-term growth
strategies for new business.''
   Clayton &amp; Dubilier has had experience in businesses at the low
end of technology. Since the firm was formed in 1978, it has made
15 acquisitions with combined sales of $7.5 billion.
   The New York-based buyout firm has made it a policy to avoid
unfriendly maneuvers, preferring to work in partnership with the
management of the businesses it acquires.
   IBM said it will maintain an equity holding in the new company.
The corporation will continue to market selected printer products
made by the new company under the IBM name and will provide service
for all printers.
   The new company will provide typewriters, intermediate and
personal printers and supplies with the IBM logo through authorized
dealers and other channels in the United States.
   The work force reductions envisioned for the new company will be
accomplished through a program of voluntary resignation and early
retirement.
   Eligible employees in Lexington will be offered the opportunity
to resign, retire or begin a five-year pre-retirement leave with
incentive payments, IBM said.
   Rossman said the program will be consistent with IBM's
long-standing policies regarding work force reduction.
   The formation of the new company is part of IBM's strategy to
sharpen its focus to concentrate on its computer and software
business.
   IBM Chairman John F. Akers said the action ``further advances
IBM's transformation'' and puts the information products division
into a better position to grow in the future.
   ``The new company will enable us to reduce overhead and more
efficiently allocate our resources to strengthen both the
subsidiary and IBM as a whole,'' Akers said.

   Karsten Mahlmann, chairman of the Chicago Board
of Trade, said today he has resigned as head of a financially
battered commodities firm that operates a subsidiary accused of
violating the Commodity Exchange Act.
   In a letter to members of the Board of Trade, Mahlmann said his
resignation as chairman of Stotler Group and Stotler and Co. was
effective at noon Tuesday.
   Mahlmann said he has no plans to step down as chairman of the
Board of Trade.
   In the letter, he said he ``simply was not a party to the
financial decisions (at Stotler) which are now being scrutinized by
the exchange and the regulators.''
   ``I have had no day-to-day management responsibilities (at
Stotler) since early 1988, and my position at Stotler was
constantly eroded,'' Mahlmann said.
   Mahlmann said had he been aware of Stotler's recent financial
decisions, ``I would not have condoned them, and I would have taken
action to reverse them.''
   He said he remains Stotler Group's largest shareholder.
   His resignation comes a day after federal regulators filed a
civil complaint accusing a Stotler subsidiary of violating the
Commodity Exchange Act.
   Filed in U.S. District Court by the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, the complaint names Stotler Funds Inc., a commodity
pool operator owned by Stotler Group.
   Stotler and Co., a futures brokerage and the group's principal
subsidiary, has withdrawn from the futures business because of
shaky finances.
   In its complaint, the government said Stotler Funds improperly
used pools of clients' money which had been set up for investing in
commodity futures contracts.
   The CFTC said Stotler Funds instead used about 80 percent of one
pool's assets _ about $4.55 million _ to invest in Stotler Group.
In addition, Stotler Funds lent $1 million from another pool to its
parent company.
   Stotler Funds' use of pool assets in this way ``operated as a
fraud or deceit on clients or participants ... in violation of the
Commodity Exchange Act,'' the regulators contended.
   The complaint seeks a court order to stop these practices and
the appointment of a temporary equity receiver.
   The Chicago Tribune reported that hundreds of investors in the
pools _ called Compass and Advanced Portfolio Management _ were
notified Monday in a letter from Stotler that the holding company
had defaulted on the two deals and that henceforth, the two pools
no longer would do business with the parent.
   In a letter from Thomas Kolter, Stotler Group's general counsel,
participants in APM and Compass also were told that because of the
defaults, the investors wouldn't be allowed to redeem their shares
in the pools for the time being, the Tribune reported.
   Mahlmann and Stotler officials did not return telephone calls
today.
   Meanwhile, the Board of Trade announced that its board of
directors had voted to give Mahlmann a vote of confidence as
chairman of the exchange despite the problems with his futures
brokerage.
   ``In recognition of his commitment to the Board of Trade, the
Board of Directors fully and unanimously expressed its confidence
in Karsten Mahlmann as Chairman,'' the exchange said in a statement
outlining action take at a special meeting Monday.
   It said the special session was called so that the board could
be briefed by the exchange's Business Conduct Committee, which has
been reviewing the situation with Stotler.

   The government's main economic forecasting
gauge was unchanged in June, the Commerce Department reported
today, suggesting sluggish growth _ but no recession _ for the
remainder of the year.
   The Index of Leading Economic Indicators, designed to forecast
economic activity six to nine months in advance, had risen a
revised 0.7 percent in May, not quite as strong as the 0.8 percent
gain first reported last month.
   But while the index did not advance in June, it escaped a
decline. In the past, three consecutive declines sometimes _ but
not always _ have signaled a forthcoming recession.
   In another economic report, the government said today that
construction spending was flat in June after two consecutive
monthly declines. The report pointed to further evidence of
weakness in the building industry.
   The Commerce Department said residential, non-residential and
government construction spending totaled a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $447.5 billion.
   If the economy continues to grow through November, it will reach
its eighth year of expansion following the last recession. It
already is in the longest peacetime expansion in U.S. history, but
has slowed noticeably in recent quarters.
   In advance of today's report, a consensus of economists had
expected a 0.2 percent gain in June.
   Only four of the forward-looking components were positive. They
were an increase in the price of raw materials, higher stock
prices, an increase in building permits and slower business
delivery times.
   On the other hand, six were negative: a drop in manufacturers'
unfilled orders, a smaller amount of orders for consumer goods, a
decline in the money supply, a drop in an index measuring consumer
confidence, a decrease in orders for new plants and equipment and
an increase in weekly unemployment claims.
   One indicator, the length of the average workweek, was unchanged.
   The various changes left the index at 146.0 percent of its 1982
base of 100 and up 1.4 percent from its level a year ago.
   The index was unchanged in January and then fell twice and rose
twice in subsequent months.
   Many economists contend that such a choppy performance is
characteristic of continuing economic weakness.
   The Commerce Department reported last Friday that the gross
national product, which measures the nation's total output of goods
and services, inched ahead 1.2 percent at an annual rate in the
second quarter.
   It revised economic growth from January through March down to
1.7 percent from 1.9 percent and said the GNP edged up a barely
perceptible 0.3 percent annual rate in the last quarter of 1989.
That was far below the 1.1 percent previous estimate.
   In fact, the department said growth in all of 1989 rose just 2.5
percent, the weakest performance since a decline of 2.5 percent in
the recession year of 1982.
   ``The economy is as close to recession as possible without
formally being in one,'' economists at Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets wrote in their current Weekly Economic &amp; Financial
Commentary following the GNP report.
   Virtually every segment of the GNP showed weakness in the second
quarter, including consumer spending, which has fueled much of the
nearly eight years of economic expansion since the 1981-82
recession.
   But Commerce reported on Monday that personal consumption, which
accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity,
rose 1.0 percent in June after being flat in May and showing weak
growth in earlier months.
   This led some analysts to say consumers were continuing to keep
the economy out of recession, usually defined as two consecutive
quarters of negative growth.
   DRI-McGraw Hill, a Massachusetts forecasting firm, said in its
current summary that ``consumers shifted to a lower gear this
winter _ but not into reverse.''
   Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist for Fuji Securities Inc., noted
in the current issue of the securities dealer's Perspectives that
the leading index ``has slipped at the modest pace of 0.1 percent
per month since early 1989.
   ``Its performance foreshadows further sluggish economic growth,
but it does not portend recession,'' he wrote.
   The Bush administration revised its GNP forecast last week to 2
percent growth for the year. This would require growth to
accelerate to a 2.9 percent rate in the last half of 1990 _ a feat
some analysts doubt will occur.
   ``Economic growth has been less than 2 percent for five
consecutive quarters,'' the Merrill Lynch economists noted. ``Our
forecast calls for three more quarters of GNP growth under 2
percent.''

<HEAD>Earnings Up Sharply In Second Quarter</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Eastman Kodak Co. said Wednesday its
earnings rose nearly fivefold in the second quarter from results
that were depressed by a large restructuring charge a year ago.
   The photographic giant earned $384 million, or $1.19 per share,
for the second quarter, compared with $77 million, or 24 cents per
share, in the same quarter last year.
   The 1989 results were reduced by $227 million due to
restructuring costs. The company said excluding the charge, its
profit was up 26 percent from $304 million, or 94 cents per share,
in 1989.
   It was the first quarterly earnings increase for the company
since 1988.
   Sales for the quarter were up 2 percent to $4.87 billion from
$4.77 billion in 1989.
   The 1989 results were restated to reflect Kodak's conversion
from a 13-week to a 12-month calendar, effective Jan. 1.
   ``Despite the sluggish U.S. economy, revenues continued at high
levels and prices held firm overall,'' Kodak Chairman and Chief
Executive Kay R. Whitmore said.
   ``Costs are being carefully controlled, especially in
photosensitive manufacturing. In addition, we saw somewhat sooner
than expected the benefits of actions initiated in 1989 to sharpen
our focus on value-adding parts of the business.''
   As part of the restructuring, Kodak sold or consolidated about
20 businesses and eliminated 7,500 jobs worldwide, most through
voluntary separation and attrition.
   Whitmore said operations ran ahead of predictions for the
quarter and half year.
   ``Barring unexpected developments in the general economy or
dramatic changes in currency valuations, we look forward to
continued recovery in Kodak earnings and to a strong second-half
performance,'' he said.
   Industry analyst Brenda Landry of Morgan Stanley in New York
said, the results were better than Wall Street had expected.
   Landry said she was revising her estimate for Kodak's 1990
earnings to $3.95 per share from $3.75.
   ``The numbers came in nearly 20 percent better on the bottom
line than we forecast,'' said David Nelson of Shearson Lehman
Hutton. ``We believe that the fundamentals look better and the
margins will be higher throughout the course of the year.''
   Earnings rose in the imaging, information and health segments of
the company and dropped in the chemicals segment. Whitmore said the
chemicals earnings were ``considerably better than expected.''
   Earnings for the first half of 1990 were $583 million, or $1.80
per share, up from $289 million, or 89 cents per share, after
restructing costs. Without the restructuring charge, first-half
earnings last year were $516 million, or $1.59 per share.
   First-half revenue edged up to $8.983 billion from $8.977
billion a year earlier.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly
mixed in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   A strong cash market for soybeans continued to lend strength to
near-term soybean futures, analysts said.
   Reports of record cold temperatures overnight in the eastern
Midwest also supported soybeans. But forecasts for a warm-up in the
region prompted light selling in the corn market amid perceptions
that higher temperatures will speed up corn crop development, which
is lagging behind the normal pace.
   Trading activity is expected to grow more cautious in advance of
the Agriculture Department's Aug. 9 crop report, which will include
corn and soybean production estimates.
   In early trading, wheat futures were unchanged to 2 cents lower
with the contract for delivery in September at $2.87{ a bushel;
corn futures were } cent lower to { cent higher with September at
$2.60{ a bushel; oats were unchanged to { cent lower with September
at $1.29 a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents lower to 1{ cents higher
with August at $5.96 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were lower while pork futures were narrowly mixed
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .42 cent lower with August at 78.15
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent to .25 cent lower with
August at 89.80 cents a pound; live hogs were .27 cent lower to .08
cent higher with August at 60.95 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .02 cent lower to .95 cent higher with August at 51.20 cents a
pound.
   Livestock and meat futures advanced on Tuesday.

   The government should give special help to
workers who lost their jobs because of policies on clean air,
protecting the spotted owl and cutting defense, lawmakers said
today.
   ``As important as it is to reduce defense expenditures and to
increase our drive to protect the natural environment, it is also
important that we make every effort not to do so at the expense of
American workers and their families,'' said Rep. Pete Stark,
D-Calif.
   Stark, who spoke before the House Ways and Means human resources
subcommittee, is cosponsor with Rep. Thomas Downey, D.-N.Y., of a
proposal to provide cash benefits to workers who lost their jobs
due to new environmental or military spending policies.
   The Bush administration opposes the legislation, saying that
unemployment benefits should be the same for everyone.
   ``It is unnecessary, would duplicate existing adjustment
programs, and would be inequitable in its treatment of workers,''
said James Van Erden, a Labor Department official.
   The legislation is only the latest in a deepening pile of
proposals to help workers displaced by government actions, and the
ideas are gaining supporters from across the country.
   ``What we need is a bold new initiative on the level of a
domestic Marshall Plan for American workers and industries in
transition,'' Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., told the subcommittee.
   ``Whether it is a timber community in western Washington state,
a coal mining community in the hills of West Virginia, or a town or
city located near a military base or defense facility,'' Adams
said, ``the federal response should adequately reflect the degree
of federal responsibility for the change being inflicted on local
jobs and local workers.''
   Adams' comments came in response to one of the broadest of
several proposals designed to cushion the blow of federal policy
changes on workers.
   The Downey-Stark proposal would provide cash and health
insurance benefits to workers displaced because of military base
closings, defense procurement cuts, changes in the Clean Air Act or
enforcement of the Endangered Species Act.
   The measure would affect everyone from decommissioned military
officers to B-2 bomber technicians and from coal miners to loggers.
   Estimates are that the so-called Downey-Stark amendment could
cost more than $5 billion over five years.
   Sens. Joseph Lieberman and Christopher Dodd, both Connecticut
Democrats, proposed legislation last week that would cost about $1
billion a year and would include a provision ensuring that laid-off
defense workers get at least a substantial fraction of their former
salaries while unemployed.
   A House proposal designed to ease the burden of defense cuts
would cost an estimated $200 million a year.
   The political momentum of such bills has increased considerably
since March when the Senate narrowly rejected a proposal by Sen.
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. That plan would have provided hefty
unemployment benefits to coal miners laid off due to declining
demand for coal amid rising factory emission requirements.
   The Byrd bill would have benefited a narrow pocket of workers _
largely in West Virginia. But now, with new measures to protect
timber country inhabited by the rare spotted owl, and with defense
spending declining under congressional pressure, the number of
workers affected by federal action and the regions involved have
grown dramatically.
   ``The Byrd amendment was a much bigger entitlement and a much
smaller population _ which was the problem,'' said William
Cunningham, a lobbyist for the AFL-CIO. ``This is not geographic.
``It is actually governmental actions that are causing these job
dislocations. The number of regions involved have to be taken into
account.''

   The stock market retreated today as investors
studied new signs of sluggishness in business activity.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 15.60 to
2,889.60 by noontime on Wall Street.
   The Commerce Department reported that the index of leading
economic indicators was unchanged in June, rather than posting the
small increase many analysts had been expecting.
   Separately, a monthly report from the National Association of
Purchasing Management showed a marked dropoff in its measure of
activity in the manufacturing sector of the economy.
   Those developments reinforced expectations in the financial
world that business growth was likely to remain meager at best in
the near future.
   In that environment, hopes have flagged on Wall Street for any
impending improvement in corporate earnings.
   But at the same time, interest rates have moved lower of late.
In today's credit market activity, prices of long-term government
bonds rose about $5 for each $1,000 in face value, lowering their
yields to the 8.36 percent-8.37 percent range.
   Eastman Kodak was a standout gainer, jumping 3&rsqb; to 41|. The
company reported second-quarter earnings of $1.19 a share, up from
24 cents in the corresponding period last year.
   UAL tumbled 8{ to 131{ after taking a 16~-point drop Tuesday,
amid reports that at least three banks have withdrawn temporarily
from financing plans for a proposed buyout of the airline holding
company.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.94 to 193.66. At the American Stock Exchaange, the market value
index was down .98 at 352.62.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 89.86 million shares at

<BYLINE>Advertisers Catching on as Baby Boomers Mature?
^By KARIN MILLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   That Americans are aging should have
marketers racing to attract a huge maturing generation, but they're
slow to catch on, an author said.
   ``You've got young creators and they're working from their own
value systems,'' said David Wolfe who wrote ``Serving the Ageless
Market: Strategies for Selling to the Fifty-Plus Market.''
   ions recorded by Ray Charles, Placido Domingo, Elvis
Presley, Merle Haggard, Lawrence Welk, the Supremes, Frank Sinatra
and about 100 others.
   And it's not just on radio stations, but every time the song is
performed at trade shows, in shopping malls, on elevators and even
on airplanes, Preston said.
   Back when BMI was formed in 1939, ASCAP had a virtual monopoly
on song publishing. Broadcasters angered with the royalty rates
demanded by ASCAP and the limited number of licensed composers they
could play on the air started the company, Eliot described in his
book.
   The new company had an open-door policy for all sorts of
musicians that were essentially ignored by ASCAP, including country
music, rhythm and blues and, eventually, rock 'n' roll, Preston
said.
   ``They just became a house organ, a scab union in order to gain
representation for what ASCAP considered the garbage of the pile,''
Eliot said. ``It turned out to be the cream of the crop.''
   BMI signed artists who weren't part of the traditional Tin Pan
Alley, such as Leadbelly, Woody Guthrie and Hank Williams in the
early years. When rock 'n' roll started, it gave BMI access to a
goldmine of hits from Chuck Berry, the Everly Brothers, B.B. King,
the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.
   By the late 1950s, BMI was jokingly referred to in the industry
as Big Money Incorporated, Eliot said in ``Rockonomics.''
   Today, the two companies compete on almost an even keel, Eliot
said. BMI, because it's still more willing to take a chance on
unknown artists, still has an advantage in rock and pop music,
while ASCAP has the lead in such areas as Broadway and television,
he said.
   ``They've become more conservative, they've become less
embattled,'' he said of the two companies. ``They realize there's
room at the table for both plates. It's better to exist without a
cold war.''
   Preston said the constant advance of new technology keeps BMI
royalty hunters busy. For instance, the use of music as a
motivational tool at trade shows and corporate meetings is a
lucrative part of the business that was hardly thought of a decade
ago.
   The increased use of ``sampling'' old riffs in new songs,
particularly by rap artists, presents a fascinating new challenge
for the publishing companies, Eliot said.
   In some cases, older artists whose work is being appropriated
don't appreciate what the new musicians have done, he said.
   It's still an open question that may have to be decided by
courts. Former members of the '60s rock band the Turtles were
furious with rappers De La Soul for using part of their music
without permission. MC Hammer recently cut Rick James in on part of
the royalties for ``U Can't Touch This,'' which borrows the melody
from James' hit, ``Superfreak.''
   BMI has planned several events to celebrate its anniversary,
including giving a special achievement award to Michael Jackson.
But one anniversary commemoration may make music fans envious.
   The company has produced a three-CD set of some of its best
music, including the pop charts and television themes. It's
virtually an encyclopedic look at what's been popular for the last
50 years, from the Tommy Dorsey band's ``Opus No. 1'' to the Miami
Sound Machine's ``Rhythm Is Gonna Get You.''
   Don't look for it in stores, however _ the company is just
distributing it to people in the industry, politicians and the
media.
   ``I've had so many calls from people asking if they could buy it
somewhere,'' she said. ``But it's not for sale.''

   The stong headwind from would-be lenders
confronting the employee-led group trying to buy United Airlines'
parent for $4.38 billion is apparently blowing away investors'
confidence in the deal.
   The price of UAL Corp. stock tumbled more than 13 percent on the
New York Stock Exchange in the two days since reports surfaced that
banks were balking at lending money for the buyout.
   Stock prices retreated $6.12{ a share Monday and $16.87{
Tuesday, closing at $140. They had tumbled another $8.50 by late
morning today, to $131.50.
   The United Employee Acquisition Corp., the group formed to
accomplish the buyout, said Tuesday night that it was still trying
to work out the financing. But the group's statement lacked any
expression of hope of success.
   ``While there remain a number of significant issues to be
resolved,'' the statement said, ``we expect to continue to work
toward solutions.''
   It said the employees also are ``continuing discussions with
airframe and engine suppliers and with institutions interested in
sale-leaseback transactions.''
   With an Aug. 9 deadline for arranging its financing, the
employee group could be forced to ask UAL directors for an
extension and may have to lower its offer, analysts said.
   Stephen Dexter, an industry analyst with Kemper Financial
Services Inc., said he believes it is highly likely the deadline
would be extended.
   Dexter also said the employee group might have to lower its
offer to get banks to lend. The employees need to borrow about $4
billion to complete the deal as proposed.
   ``The very best odds you can give this deal at this point is
50-50, and that's being pretty generous,'' he said.
   An earlier proposed $6.75 billion buyout of UAL by the company's
pilots, management and British Airways PLC collapsed last October
for lack of bank financing.
   The employee group has asked UAL's aircraft and engine
suppliers, including Boeing Co. and General Electric Co., to invest
in the proposed deal. The group said Monday it was close to getting
help from its suppliers, but the banks reportedly are unhappy that
no agreement has been reached.
   The trade publication American Banker said Tuesday that Citicorp
and Chase Manhattan Corp. representatives did not attend a meeting
Friday on possible bank financing.
   The newspaper also quoted unidentified sources as saying
Citicorp had withdrawn for the time being from a bank group
negotiating with the employees over financing.
   The article followed reports Monday from various sources that
Chemical Banking Corp. had withdrawn temporarily as a possible
lender.
   The banks and the employee group refused to comment on the
report.
   Chemical, Citicorp and Chase were among five banks that
expressed interest early in July in becoming lead lenders for the
buyout.
   The other banks in the group are Bankers Trust New York Corp.
and Manufacturers Hanover Corp.

   The U.S. dollar rose marginally today against most
major currencies in trading in Europe.
   Gold prices also rose.
   Analysts said the dollar's advance appeared to be a technical
correction following sharp drops earlier in the week.
   The recent decline in the dollar followed indications that the
U.S. economy is weakening, increasing chances that the Federal
Reserve will encourage lower interest rates. Falling rates cut the
yields available to foreigners on investments denominated in
dollars.
   In Tokyo, the dollar sank to its lowest level since February 23.
It closed at 146.65 yen, down 0.85 yen from Tuesday. But it rose
later in London to 147.20 yen. At midday in New York, the dollar
was quoted at 147.155 yen.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8550, down from $1.8595
late Tuesday. At midday in New York, the pound was trading at
$1.85575.
   The dollar was quoted at 1.5920 Deutsche marks late Wednesday in
London, up from 1.5875 marks late Tuesday. The midday dollar quote
in New York was 1.59175 West German marks.
   Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Tuesday,
included: 1.3555 Swiss francs, up from 1.3475; 5.3355 French
francs, up from 5.3210; 1.7935 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7880;
1,164.75 Italian lire, up from 1,162.00, and 1.1530 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1523.
   Other selected midday dollar prices in New York included:
1.35455 Swiss francs, 1,166.45 Italian lire and 1.15275 Canadian
dollars.
   In London, gold was quoted at a late bid of $374.30 per troy
ounce, up from $372.05 late Tuesday. Zurich's market was closed for
a holiday.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose $2.04 to close at $371.46 per ounce.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid of $4.82 a troy
ounce, from $4.85 late Tuesday.

<HEAD>Pathe-Cinema Sold to French Industrial Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A French industrial group, Chargeurs SA, on
Wednesday purchased Pathe-Cinema SA, the film company which Italian
financier Giancarlo Parretti tried in vain to buy earlier this year.
   The acquisition, costing an estimated 1 billion francs, or $180
million, was announced in two stages.
   First, French stock exchange officials announced that Chargeurs
had bought 52.3 percent of Pathe-Cinema for 517 million francs, or
$93 million, from four companies within the Rivaud investment group.
   Later, Parretti's Pathe France Holding, which owned 46.5 percent
of Pathe-Cinema, announced it also was selling its shares to
Chargeurs. The sale price was not disclosed, but was believed to at
the same price per share as the transaction with Rivaud.
   Trading in Pathe-Cinema shares was suspended following the
transaction with Rivaud. There was no indication when trading would
resume.
   The was no immediate indication whether the sale of Pathe-Cinema
would affect Parretti's efforts to buy MGM-United Artists in the
United States.
   The Chargeurs deal follows Economics Minister Pierre Beregovoy's
decision in June to block Parretti's acquisition of Pathe, saying
it ``would be of a nature to disrupt public order.''
   Specifically, Beregovoy questioned the source of Parretti's
funds, which were linked to a Swiss company, Sasea. If this were
the case, he argued, Parretti's group should have sought prior
approval from the French government because Switzerland isn't a
member of the European Community.
   The case was viewed as an example of the government's desire to
keep a French cultural asset in French hands.
   Parretti's Pathe France Holding complained that French
authorities wanted to combat foreign ownership even though such an
attitude contradicted their avowed support for increased economic
integration in Western Europe.
   Pathe-Cinema owns about 150 movie theaters in France and is one
of Western Europe's major film distributors.
   Chargeurs, a diversified industrial group, already had interests
in film production and distribution.

<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Travelers Corp. reported Wednesday a
slight drop in second-quarter net income, citing competition that
has limited its ability to raise prices, regulatory pressures and
disappointing returns on real estate investments.
   For the quarter ended June 30, the insurance giant reported net
income of $102 million, or 98 cents per share, compared to $114
million, or $1.10 per share, for the same period a year ago.
   Total revenues for the second quarter were $3 billion, down from
$3.2 billion a year ago.
   Net investment income was $892 million, compared to $887 million
a year ago. Premiums were $1.9 billion, compared to $2 billion last
year.
   For the first six months of 1990, net income was $193 million,
or $1.85 per share, compared to $212 million, or $2.06 per share,
for the first half of 1989.
   Total revenues for the first six months of this year were $6.2
billion, compared to $6.3 billion a year ago.
   Premiums for the first six months were $4 billion, the same as
last year. Net investment income for the first six months was $1.8
billion, also the same as last year.
   ``Commercial lines profits improved overall as a result of
higher realized capital gains in this year's second quarter,'' said
Edward H. Budd, chairman and chief executive officer. ``However,
very competitive market conditions continue to limit price
increases needed to keep pace with loss cost increases.''
   The Travelers recently announced that it was withdrawing from
personal lines of auto and homeowners insurance in nine states
because of regulatory and pricing pressures.

   Construction spending, which had fallen for
two straight months, was flat in June, the government reported
Wednesday.
   The Commerce Department said spending on residential,
non-residential and government projects totaled a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $447.5 billion after dropping 1.9 percent
in April and 0.3 percent in May.
   The April and May declines were not as severe as first reported.
The April figure was revised from 2.2 percent while the May number
improved slightly from 0.4 percent.
   Residential spending was down 2.2 percent for the second
consecutive month, to $196.1 billion at an annual rate in June.
   Single-family building was off 3.5 percent following a 4.0
percent drop in May. Spending on apartment projects was unchanged
after rising 1.5 percent the previous month.
   Some analysts said they expect a slight pickup in residential
building but suggested other areas of the construction industry
would remain sluggish.
   David Berson, chief economist with the Federal National Mortgage
Association, said residential spending still was feeling the
effects of higher mortgage rates earlier this year.
   The rates, he said, caused sales to drop and builders to put off
projects until inventories fell.
   The average 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage, which had been in the
double digits for most of the year, dropped to the 9.98 percent
level by last Friday.
   And the Commerce Department reported on Tuesday that new home
sales had jumped 8 percent in June, their second straight increase
after five months of declines.
   Non-residential spending surged 3.9 percent to $107.1 billion at
an annual rate, paced by a huge 10.2 percent gain in construction
of office buildings. The non-residential segment had fallen 0.9
percent in the previous month.
   Both Berson and Darryl Delano, an economist with Cahners
Economics in Newton, Mass., expressed surprise at the spending on
office buildings and suggested the pace could not be sustained
because of widespread vacancies throughout much of the nation.
   The Federal Reserve estimated earlier this year that the
national vacancy rate of downtown office buildings was 16 percent.
   The often-volatile government sector was off 0.1 percent to
$108.4 billion following a 3.8 percent advance in May.
   ``Given the fiscal situation, we expect this to trend down over
the second half of the year,'' Berson said.

<DATELINE>GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paul J. Schierl, who has battled illness
since arranging a management-led buyout of Fort Howard Corp. two
years ago, resigned Wednesday as the paper giant's chief executive
after 16 years.
   Donald DeMuse, president of the Green Bay-based company since
1984, was named to succeed Schierl as chief executive. DeMuse will
also continue as president, the company said.
   DeMuse was not available for interviews Wednesday but said in a
prepared statement that Schierl was ``the driving force behind the
considerable success that Fort Howard Corp. has enjoyed for many
years.''
   ``His contribution to building the value of the company has been
immense. Everyone at Fort Howard will miss him,'' he said.
   Schierl, who was named chief executive in 1974, led the company
through unprecendented growth through the 1980s. Fort Howard's
sales grew from $296 million in 1978 to more than $1.7 billion in
1987.
   In 1988 he led a $3.7 billion management takeover of the company
and later orchestrated a partial sale of Fort Howard's profitable
paper cup division to a Massachusetts firm, which moved the
operations to Chicago.
   Although the paper cup division sale reduced the company's sales
nearly in half, Fort Howard has shown continued growth while
concentrating its manufacturing on tissue paper products.
   Its sales in fiscal 1989 exceeded $1 billion for the first time
since the takeover and sale of the paper cup division, company
spokesman Clifford A. Bowers said.
   The 55-year-old Schierl had a heart attack in April 1988 and
another one last March. He suffered a stroke while recovering from
double bypass surgery in April and has been recovering since he was
released from the hospital, the company said.
   Schierl had met with Fort Howard officials and visited the plant
since returning to his suburban Green Bay home from the Cleveland
hospital where his surgery was performed, but had not returned to
work, company officials said.
   DeMuse, who joined Fort Howard 23 years ago, was instrumental in
the 1988 buyout along with Kathleen J. Hempel, the company's first
vice president.
   Under the buyout, New York-based Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. became the
company's majority owner and appointed four members to the Fort
Howard board of directors.
   The company statement said Schierl will continue as a consultant
to Morgan Stanley, working on projects unrelated to Fort Howard.
   Schierl also will remain a member of the board of the Federal
Reserve Bank of Chicago and will be chairman of the Fort Howard
Foundation, a charitable arm of the company.
   Fort Howard employs 6,000 workers at its three plants in
Wisconsin, Georgia and Oklahoma.

<HEAD>Media Giant Forms Sports Marketing Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time Warner Inc. said Wednesday it has formed a
new company to coordinate and expand its involvement in sports
marketing.
   Time Warner Sports will be headed by Seth G. Abraham, who the
company said helped build sports programming for its pay TV
service, Home Box Office.
   Time Warner said the new sports company will coordinate and
broaden the sports rights agreements currently held by the parent
company's magazine, cable, pay television, home video, licensing
and book groups.
   The $11 billion media and entertainment giant estimated its
sports-related activities generate more than $750 million a year in
revenue.
   Time Warner publishes Sports Illustrated and SI for Kids
magazines, carries sports events on its HBO cable channel and on
HBO Video cassettes, and licenses sports properties.
   Additionally, Time Warner said its new sports company would
develop new sports businesses across the corporation by acquiring
sports rights and building on the company's products and sports
relationships.
   It is expected the new company will explore new businesses such
as developing syndicated TV programming, regional networks and
pay-per-view ventures, talent management and the creation of sports
events.
   Asked if the new company was created to buy a sports franchise
such as a major league baseball team, Abraham said that was not
part of the company's immediate plans although he would not rule it
out over the longer term.
   He said its mission was to create a corporate sports strategy
that would take advantage of the sports ventures which various Time
Warner divisions pursue on their own.
   Abraham cited the company's current affilation with heavyweight
boxer Mike Tyson as an example of the possibilities he will pursue.
   HBO owns the rights to cover several Tyson boxing matches. In
the future, Abraham said Time Warner Sports may seek to sign Tyson
for publishing, pay-per-view TV and home video deals as well as to
cover his fights on HBO.
   In a statement, the Time Warner co-chief executives, Steven J.
Ross and Nicholas J. Nicholas Jr., said Time Warner Sports will
play ``a major role in the corporation's strategy of globalization,
because sport is a universal form of entertainment.''
   Abraham, 42, joined HBO in 1978 as director of sports
operations. He most recently had overseeen sports, scheduling,
promotion, talent relations and public realtions for HBO and its
sister pay TV network Cinemax.

<HEAD>Higher Airline Revenue Helps Narrow Quarterly Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pan Am Corp. on Wednesday reported a net loss of
$49 million for the second quarter, about half the size of last
year's $101 million second-quarter shortfall from continuing
operations.
   The New York-based holding company for Pan American World
Airways attributed the narrower deficit mainly to sharply higher
airline revenue.
   Pam Am's loss for the three months ended June 30 declined to 33
cents a share from 69 cents a share a year earlier.
   Total corporate revenue rose 12.2 percent to $1.02 billion from
$909.4 million in 1989's second quarter.
   The corporation had an operating loss of $8.6 million for the
second quarter, down from $49.6 million in the second quarter of
last year.
   ``We are encouraged by our second-quarter results, not only by
the substantial improvement over last year, but by the improving
trends we recorded during the quarter,'' said Thomas G. Plaskett,
Pan Am chairman and chief executive officer.
   Revenue from scheduled air passenger services grew 16.7 percent
to $830.8 million from $711.9 million.
   ``Pan Am reported the highest scheduled passenger revenues ever
recorded by the airline in the second quarter, and in the month of
June, we showed our first net profit in any month since August of
1988,'' Plaskett said.
   For the first half of the year, Pan Am had a net loss of $239.7
million or $1.61 a share, smaller than $255.9 million or $1.76 a
share through the first two quarters of 1989.
   The corporation's operating loss amounted to $158.6 million in
the first half, down from $178.3 million a year earlier. Operating
revenue rose 13.6 percent in the first half to $1.87 billion from
$1.64 billion.

   The stock market recorded some spotty losses
today as investors studied new signs of sluggishness in business
activity.
   The Commerce Department reported that the index of leading
economic indicators was unchanged in June, rather than posting the
small increase many analysts had been expecting.
   Separately, a monthly report from the National Association of
Purchasing Management showed a marked dropoff in its measure of
activity in the manufacturing sector of the economy.
   Those developments reinforced expectations in the financial
world that business growth was likely to remain meager at best in
the near future.
   In that environment, hopes have flagged on Wall Street for any
impending improvement in corporate earnings.
   But at the same time, interest rates have moved lower of late.
In today's credit market activity, prices of long-term government
bonds rose about $5 for each $1,000 in face value, lowering their
yields to the 8.35 percent-8.37 percent range.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Tumble Amid Slack Demand; Favorable Weather</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices fell sharply
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as the market's focus
returned to bearish factors such as slack export demand and
favorable U.S. growing weather.
   The wheat market led the way down on indications that foreign
demand remains weak. Soybean futures also fell steeply, erasing the
modest gains posted in the two previous sessions.
   Strength in the cash soybean market, which recently provided
support to futures, continued on Wednesday. But that indicator of
domestic demand was overshadowed by a lack of export interest.
   ``I'm not saying there's no demand, but there's not enough to
hold beans at $6 or so,'' said Gerald Zusel, manager of floor
operations at the exchange for Balfour Maclaine Corp.
   Weather forecasts projected a continuation of beneficial
conditions for corn and soybean development in the Midwest.
   At the close, wheat futures were 3 cents to 7{ cents lower with
the contract for delivery in September at $2.81\ a bushel; corn was
4{ cents to 5{ cents lower with September at $2.55{ a bushel; oats
were 5{ cents to 6} cents lower with September at $1.23 a bushel;
soybeans were 9 cents to 15 cents lower with August at $5.84 a
bushel.

<HEAD>Two Quebec Paper Mills Still Struck</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers at two paper mills in Quebec remained on
strike Wednesday with no signs that the walkouts would end soon.
   About 1,200 workers walked off the job Saturday at Quebec and
Ontario Paper Co. in Baie-Comeau, Que., while 420 workers struck
Thursday at James MacLaren Industries in Masson, Que., after the
companies rejected a union request for 20 percent more vacation pay
and a reduction in work hours.
   The two companies belong to the four-member Eastern Canada
Newsprint Group, which has bargained jointly for more than three
decades but has become splintered lately.
   The two other companies in the 3,300-employee group _ Daishowa
Paper Mfg. Co. Ltd. in Quebec City and Domtar Inc. in Dolbeau _
have accepted the demands of locals of the Canadian Paperworkers
Union.
   However, MacLaren has said it wants to bargain separately with
its workers, while the union has said it will only bargain with the
company as part of the group, MacLaren spokesman Normand Chenail
said.
   The unions are striking over local issues. Central bargaining by
the group was expected to begin later this month on the basis of a
model settlement reached by the union with another company,
Stone-Consolidated Inc.
   The agreement, which won only 56.4 percent approval from 2,300
Stone workers in eastern Quebec, calls for annual wage increases of
5.5 per cent over three years. I return, the union agreed to let
mills operate on two holidays and allow repairmen perform a variety
of tasks on night shifts.
   Many workers were angry that the contract broke little new
ground in areas including job security and overtime.
   The two strike-bound companies and the union said they will pay
close attention to what happens during negotiations involving 4,000
workers at the larger Canadian Pacific Ltd., which begin this week.
   Neither MacLaren, which produces 180,000 tons of newsprint
annually, nor Quebec and Ontario Paper, which produces 450,000 tons
annually, said they have any stockpiles.
   Both companies supply American newspapers, but it was not
immediately known what publications might be affected by the
walkout.

<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance
Co. said Wednesday it will jointly acquire Oppenheimer Management
Corp. from British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings PLC for approximately
$150 million.
   MassMutual, the nation's 11th largest life insurance company,
said it and senior management of Oppenheimer plan to acquire the
New York-based Oppenheimer, which is one of the nation's biggest
mutual fund companies.
   The purchase is subject to approval of the mutual funds'
independent directors and the funds' shareholders, said Joseph
Mondy, MassMutual spokesman.
   Under the proposed agreement, Oppenheimer Management would
continue to operate independently and retain key management. The
change of ownership would not affect shareholders' investments in
mutual funds managed by Oppenheimer Management, MassMutual said in
a prepared statement.
   The proposed acquisition will further MassMutual's venture into
mutual funds, which the company introduced in 1988 with the
MassMutual Integrity Funds, Mondy said.
   ``What we're buying are funds with a long and well-known track
record. Because of that we want to keep it as a separate entity,''
he said.
   Both companies also are looking to increase their involvement
overseas, he said.
   MassMutual was established in 1851. Its 1989 gain before
dividends reached $612 million, a 12 percent increase over 1988.
Dividends for 1989 totaling $489 million were distributed to about
1.6 million policyholders.
   Oppenheimer manages more than 50 mutual funds with assets of
more than $14 billion and more than 1.2 million shareholder
accounts.

<TEXT>
   Transamerica Corp. on Wednesday reported a
5 percent drop in second-quarter profits, attributing the dip to an
expected lower level in capital gains.
   Transamerica reported net income of $86.5 million or $1.08 per
share for the three-month period that ended June 30, compared to
$91.2 million or $1.15 per share for the same period of 1989.
   Revenues for the second quarter were $1.67 billion, down
slightly from $1.69 billion in 1989.
   But the financial services company also said strong performances
in its life insurance, consumer lending and real estate service
businesses boosted income from operations 11 percent during the
first half of the year.
   Earnings for the first six months of the year declined 3
percent, from $162 million or $2.04 a share in the 1989 period to
$156.8 million or $1.96 a share.
   Revenues for the six months that ended June 30, 1990 were $3.3
billion, up slightly from $3.28 billion for the same period last
year.
   Last year's first-half results included $30 million, or 40 cents
per share, in investment gains, one-third of it from the sale of
warrants in the divestiture of Budget Rent a Car, Transamerica said.

<HEAD>Energy Futures Surge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices rallied Wednesday amid
buying inspired by reports of political tension in the Middle East.
   Trading was hectic on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
especially after the near-month crude contract swept past $21 a
barrel.
   The contract for September delivery of West Texas Intermediate,
the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, settled at $21.54 per 42-gallon
barrel, up 85 cents on the day and bringing its gain over the past
two sessions to $1.33. Contracts for delivery during October
through December also advanced strongly.
   Refined petroleum products traded on the New York Merc followed
the crude lead and settled sharply higher.
   Unleaded gasoline for September delivery climbed 1.81 cents to
64.27 cents a gallon, more than making up for Tuesday's loss of
0.28 cent. Later contracts also posted significant gains.
   The September home heating oil contract, which added 0.18 cent
on Wednesday, soared 2.84 cents to 61.19 a gallon. The October,
November and December contracts jumped ahead, too.
   Meanwhile, in natural gas trading, the September contract
settled at $1.402 per 1,000 cubic feet, down from $1.411 on
Wednesday. The later contracts were mixed.
   Energy analysts said unconfirmed reports of Iraqi troop
movements within Kuwaiti territory encouraged buyers. James Steel
of Refco Inc. said traders have been speculating that Iraq might
seize certain Kuwaiti oilfields because it disagrees that the
fields should be under Kuwait's ownership.
   Steel said indications that some influential OPEC members are
taking steps to abide by a new oil production agreement also
supported prices.
   The output-cutting accord reached by the 13-member Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries at a meeting last week in Geneva
has lifted oil prices on world markets in recent days.
   Other bullish supply and demand factors lent a positive tone to
the energy market. A report that South Korea's crude oil imports
rose 19 percent in the first six months of the year from 1989's
first half suggested that Asian demand may be stronger than
previously thought, Steel said.
   A moderately bearish weekly report from the American Petroleum
Institute released late Tuesday after the market closed appeared to
be largely ignored by traders. It showed virtually unchanged
refinery runs.

   Acting to free resources to focus on its main
high- technology businesses, IBM on Wednesday announced it will
place its typewriter, keyboard and certain printer operations into
a new company in which it will retain a minority interest.
   A firm specializing in buyouts, Clayton &amp; Dubilier Inc., will
acquire the majority stake in the new firm.
   Executives of International Business Machines Corp. and Clayton
&amp; Dubilier said in interviews that negotiations on a final
agreement are expected to conclude by the end of the year. Until
then, they said, no information will be disclosed on how much
Clayton &amp; Dubilier will pay IBM or what size stake it will acquire.
   Industry analysts have estimated that the businesses would be
worth $2.5 billion to $3 billion.
   The preliminary agreement calls for the new company to include
the U.S. portions of IBM's Information Products business.
Eventually, the rest of the worldwide operation will be melded into
the alliance with Clayton &amp; Dubilier, said IBM Vice President
Marvin L. Mann, who will become the company's chief executive
officer.
   Mann said in an interview that the company's businesses, made up
largely of IBM facilities in Lexington, Ky., and Boulder, Colo.,
will do better on their own than they would remaining within IBM.
   ``Under IBM, this business has not had the highest of
priorities,'' he said. ``IBM is less in the business of selling
products and more in the business of selling solutions and total
systems.''
   Traditional typewriters have been elbowed out of offices by
fancier machines capable of a broader range of functions, noted
Barbara Otto, spokeswoman for the Cleveland-based group 9 to 5,
National Association of Working Women.
   But Mann said there still is money to be made in typewriters.
Supplying products like typing elements for the vast number of IBM
Selectric and other machines already in offices is lucrative.
   ``The typewriter business is not a growing business but it's a
profitable business and it's still quite a substantial business in
size,'' he said.
   And the new company will go beyond typewriters. It will
manufacture and supply keyboards for IBM and other companies'
workstations. It will develop and market intermediate and personal
printers and supplies. Mann said the printer and keyboard business
is expanding rapidly.
   The IBM offspring would rank within the top 200 of the Fortune
500 list of the country's largest corporations based on annual
revenue, Mann said.
   Wall Street took the announcement in stride because there has
been widespread publicity about IBM's intention to reconfigure
itself. IBM stock added 12{ cents closing at $111.62{ a share on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   Steps are being taken to assure that employees are treated
fairly, Mann said.
   The new company is expected to reduce its work force by 1,200,
with 3,500 to 4,000 employees by the end of the year. Including
operations outside the United States, the company would have 5,000
employees.
   The anticipated job cuts will be accomplished through a program
of voluntary resignation and early retirement. Eligible employees
in Lexington will be offered the opportunity to resign, retire or
begin a five-year pre-retirement leave with incentive payments.
   IBM said the program will be consistent with its long-standing
``full employment policy'' of no layoffs. Since the mid-1980s when
growth in the computer industry began to slow, IBM has pared its
payroll through plant consolidations and voluntary early
retirements.
   The buyout firm figuring in IBM's plans has had experience in
lower-end technology businesses. Since it was formed in 1978,
Clayton &amp; Dubelier has acquired 15 businesses with combined sales
of $7.5 billion.
   The New York-based firm has made it a practice to avoid
unfriendly maneuvers, preferring to work in partnership with the
management of the businesses it acquires.
   Chairman Martin H. Dubilier said substantial investments will be
made in the IBM company to broaden its product line, bolster
marketing efforts and strengthen the distribution network.
   IBM will maintain an equity holding in the new company for an
indefinite period of time, said James J. Forese, IBM vice president
of finance.
   He said the deal will not have a material impact on IBM's
earnings.
   Forese said the new company will continue to use the IBM logo
for about three to five years before gradually making a transition
to its own. In seven to 10 years, its products will carry a new
logo.
   Formation of the new subsidiary is a key element of IBM's
strategy to stay on the cutting edge of the computer and software
industry, the company said.
   ``It will fundamentally let us focus on our core business,''
Forese said. ``When we looked at what's on our plate from a
competitive standpoint, we thought the information services
business would be better off on its own.''

   The Treasury tentatively plans to borrow a
quarterly record $32.25 billion from the public next week in a
series of debt auctions to replenish the government's coffers, it
announced Wednesday.
   But Undersecretary Robert Glauber emphasized the auction would
be contingent upon congressional assurance that it would enact
legislation by Monday raising the federal debt limit above the
current $3.12 trillion ceiling.
   ``We are offering $32.25 billion of notes and bonds to refund
$20.0 billion of privately held notes maturing on Aug. 15 and to
raise approximately $12.25 billion of cash,'' Glauber said.
   The $32.25 billion would surpass the previous record of $30.5
billion in notes and bonds sold last May.
   Glauber said the auctions next week would include:
   _$11.50 billion in three-year notes in minimum denominations of
$5,000 to be sold on Tuesday.
   _$10.50 billion in 10-year notes in minimum denominations of
$1,000 to be auctioned on Wednesday, and,
   _$10.25 billion in 30-year bonds in minimum denominations of
$1,000 to be offered on Thursday.
   Also on Thursday, the Treasury will auction $10 billion in
36-day cash management bills in minimum denominations of $1 million.

   The dollar regained some ground in foreign
exchange Wednesday, but traders warned that the U.S. currency
remained weak.
   Gold prices also moved higher.
   Analysts said the dollar's advance appeared to be a technical
correction as traders took profits on foreign currencies that have
surged higher against the dollar during the past week.
   The dollar has fallen sharply amid increasing signs that the
U.S. economy is weakening and amid speculation that the Federal
Reserve will be forced to lower interest rates to stimulate
business activity. The dollar is supported by higher rates, so a
move by the Fed to push rates down would also bring the U.S.
currency lower.
   Further evidence of an economic slowdown came Wednesday from the
monthly index issued by the National Association of Purchasing
Management, which fell to 47.4 in July from 51.1 in June. The
decline indicated a slowing of the manufacturing sector.
   Analysts said currencies with higher interest rates _ especially
those in Europe _ remain strong against the dollar, and they are
not expected to decline in the near future.
   The dollar recovered some ground against the British pound
Wednesday. Sterling fell to $1.8552 in New York from $1.8635 late
Tuesday. In earlier London trading, one British pound cost $1.8550,
down from $1.8595 late Tuesday. Other late dollar rates in New
York, compared with late Tuesday's prices, included: 1.58885 West
German marks, up from 1.58555; 1.3540 Swiss francs, up from
1.34475; 5.3240 French francs, up from 5.3195; 1,162.75 Italian
lire, up from 1,162.00; and 1.15275 Canadian dollars, up from
1.15165.
   Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Tuesday,

   Congressional Democrats proposed a $5 billion
program Wednesday to help workers who lose their jobs because of
defense cuts or environmental rules designed to clean the air and
protect the spotted owl.
   Touching off an immediate and heated debate with Republicans and
Bush administration officials, Reps. Thomas Downey, D-N.Y., and
Pete Stark, D-Calif., unveiled legislation to provide extra
unemployment and health benefits to families affected by the policy
changes.
   The proposal is specifically aimed at defense workers, including
military people, laid off because of Pentagon spending cuts, along
with loggers idled by the effort to preserve the spotted owl and
its forest habitat, and coal miners left above ground by tougher
clean-air laws.
   ``We owe it to them to provide the assistance they need,'' said
Downey as he convened a hearing of the House Ways and Means human
resources committee.
   The Downey-Stark proposal would cost more than $5 billion over
five years and would provide extra unemployment and health benefits
to about 200,000 workers _ far fewer, Downey noted, than the number
expected to be displaced.
   ``I think it's inadequate. It should cover more people,'' Downey
said. ``But we don't have the votes.''
   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., called the measure to ``a domestic
Marshall plan,'' akin to the post-war European reconstruction
program financed by the United States.
   Republicans, even some from states that would benefit from the
proposal, immediately criticized the legislation as unfair to
unemployed workers who lose their jobs for reasons unrelated to
federal policy but who are no less needy.
   Republican Rep. Rod Chandler, whose home state of Washington
faces job losses due to the new spotted owl policy, called the
legislation an ``ill-conceived, hastily slapped together proposal''
that would burden the Medicaid system with the extra health
benefits.
   ``It leaves out those who have lost their jobs due to other
causes,'' Chandler said. ``Are they not worthy too?''
   Republicans on the subcommittee also made clear their concern
that the program would drain scarce federal revenue. Downey and
Stark proposed financing the measure through continuance of a 0.2
percent federal unemployment tax which is due to expire this year.
   The Bush administration also piled on, saying that existing
programs already provide adequate job retraining and jobless
benefits.
   Labor Department administrator James Van Erden said the Bush
administration ``believes that singling out certain groups of
workers for special treatment based on the cause of their
dislocation is inequitable and inappropriate.''
   Despite the GOP criticism, the idea of helping workers hurt by
government policies has gained considerable support on Capitol Hill
since last March when the Senate narrowly rejected a proposal by
Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. Byrd's plan would have provided hefty
unemployment benefits to coal miners laid off if tougher clean air
standards led to reduced coal burning.
   Since then, new and increasingly elaborate measures have been
proposed to provide extra jobless benefits but to a larger pool of
workers than West Virginia's coal miners.
   ``The Byrd amendment was a much bigger entitlement and a much
smaller population _ which was the problem,'' said William
Cunningham, a lobbyist for the AFL-CIO and a supporter of the
Downey-Stark proposal. ``This is not geographic. ``It is actually
governmental actions that are causing these job dislocations. The
number of regions involved have to be taken into account.''
   Sens. Joseph Lieberman and Christopher Dodd, both Connecticut
Democrats, proposed legislation last week that would cost about $1
billion a year and would include a provision ensuring that laid-off
defense workers get at least a substantial fraction of their former
salaries while unemployed.
   A separate House proposal designed to ease the burden of defense
cuts would cost an estimated $200 million a year.

<HEAD>National Steel Corp. Reports Sharp Drop in Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Steel Corp. said Wednesday its
second-quarter earnings plunged 66 percent because of large numbers
of equipment overhauls.
   The country's fifth largest steel maker reported profits of
$13.1 million, compared with $32.4 million for the second period of
1989.
   Sales for the quarter ended June 30 were $655.9 million,
compared with $674 million in the year-ago period, the company said.
   Kokichi Hagiwara, the company's chairman and chief executive,
said the equipment shutdowns were required to modernize and
maintain key steel finishing facilities.
   ``These planned outages kept us from fully capitalizing on the
improving business climate,'' Hagiwara said in a statement.
   Ronald Doerr, National Steel's president, repeated earlier
projections that the company's markets will continue to improve
during the second half of the year.
   ``We are experiencing strengthened demand in the automotive,
can, pipe and tube markets,'' Doerr said in a statement. ``Some
softness still exists in the construction market, but this
condition should improve as the year progresses.''
   National Steel is not publicly traded. It operates as a joint
venture owned equally by National Intergroup Inc. and NKK Corp. of
Japan.
   Net income in the first half of 1990 was $8.9 million, down 79
percent from income of $42.2 million in the 1989 period.

   UAL Corp. stock continued dropping Wednesday as
investors showed more skepticism that a $4.38 billion employee-led
buyout would succeed.
   UAL, which fell a total of $23 on Monday and Tuesday, finished
down another $4 at $136 a share Wednesday on the New York Stock
Exchange. The stock traded at $131 a share at one point during the
session.
   The stock has dropped in the wake of reports that banks were
balking at loaning money for the $201 a share buyout offer, with an
Aug. 9 deadline approaching the employee group to arrange financing.
   Several airline analysts said they expected the stock price to
stay in the $130 to $140 range until there was concrete information
that the deal had fallen through, that financing had been arranged
or that the acquisition group had requested an extension of the
deadline.
   ``Once it seems to find a bottom, the price will bounce back
somewhat,'' said Robert Decker, an analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps in
Chicago. ``There's always investors willing to step up to the plate
and pick it up at what appears to be'' a low price that will rise.
   The acquisition group stated Tuesday that it was trying to
secure financing, but gave no indication of how the process was
going. Officials for the group did not immediately return a
telephone call on Wednesday.
   Citicorp, Chase Manhattan Corp. and Chemical Banking Corp. _
members of a group that had expressed interest in being the lead
bank lenders for the deal _ reportedly have balked at providing
money because of concerns that the buyout relies too heavily on
debt.
   The other banks in the group are Bankers Trust New York Corp.
and Manufacturers Hanover Corp.
   The banks and the employee group have refused to comment on the
report. Spokespeople for Citibank and Bankers Trust again refused
to comment on Wednesday, while the other banks did not immediately
return telephone calls.
   Several analysts said it appeared the acquisition group would
not be able to meet the Aug. 9 deadline, given the apparent
reluctance of banks and concerns about the use of leveraged buyouts.
   ``The timing is not right,'' said Mark Daugherty, an analyst for
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York. ``They're trying to jam
something through that the market is not ready to let through.''
   A proposed $6.75 billion buyout of UAL by the company's pilots,
management and British Airways PLC collapsed last October when
banks refused to finance the deal.

   Worries about economic growth in general and the
banking industry in particular combined to push stock prices lower
in an erratic session Wednesday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 5.94 to 2,899.26.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 6 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
733 up, 777 down and 524 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 176.81 million
shares, against 173.81 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 216.03 million shares.
   The Commerce Department reported that the index of leading
economic indicators was unchanged in June, rather than posting the
small increase many analysts had been expecting.
   Separately, a monthly report from the National Association of
Purchasing Management showed a marked dropoff in its measure of
activity in the manufacturing sector of the economy.
   Those developments reinforced expectations in the financial
world that business growth was likely to remain meager at best in
the near future.
   In that environment, hopes have flagged on Wall Street for any
impending improvement in corporate earnings.
   But at the same time, interest rates have moved lower of late.
In today's credit market activity, prices of long-term government
bonds rose about $5 for each $1,000 in face value, lowering their
yields to the 8.35 percent-8.37 percent range.
   Bank stocks were broadly lower, depressed by worries cited in a
Wall Street Journal article about continuing pressures on profits
in the industry. Citicorp fell } to 19&rsqb;; Chemical Banking 1 to 22;
Manufacturers Hanover 1 to 29{; J.P. Morgan ~ to 37&lsqb;, and
BankAmerica } to 24.
   By contrast, Eastman Kodak was a standout gainer, jumping 4\ to
42&rsqb; and ranking as the most active Big Board stock. The company
reported second-quarter earnings of $1.19 a share, up from 24 cents
in the corresponding period last year.
   UAL tumbled 4&lsqb; to 135~ after taking a 16~-point drop Tuesday,
amid reports that at least three banks have withdrawn temporarily
from financing plans for a proposed buyout of the airline holding
company.
   Energy stocks, still responding to signs of upward pressure on
oil prices, continued to dominate the list of new 52-week highs.
British Petroleum rose 1\ to 75}; Exxon \ to 52&lsqb;; Schlumberger 1&lsqb;
to 66{; Hallibuton } to 55|, and Atlantic Richfield 1&lsqb; to 130{.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $6.57 billion, or 0.19
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .22 to 194.38.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell .76 to 419.84, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was down .63 at 355.52.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 2.33 to 435.91. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 353.30, down .30.

<TEXT>
   Reports of heightened tensions in the two-week-old dispute
between Iraq and Kuwait helped boost gold and petroleum futures
prices Wednesday as fears of a crude-oil supply disruption swept
through the trading pits.
   On other commodity markets, copper futures soared; grains and
soybeans were sharply lower; and livestock and meat futures also
fell.
   In a non-trading development, Chicago Board of Trade Chairman
Karsten Mahlmann resigned amid federal allegations of wrongdoing at
the trading firm he headed.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate
crude oil futures settled 32 cents to 85 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September up 85 cents at $21.54 a barrel;
wholesale heating oil was 1.85 cents to 2.84 cents higher with
September at 61.19 cents a gallon; wholesale unleaded gasoline was
1.81 cents to 2 cents higher with September at 64.27 cents a gallon.
   Energy analysts said unconfirmed reports of Iraqi troop
movements within Kuwaiti territory encouraged buyers. James Steel
of Refco Inc. said traders have been speculating that Iraq might
seize certain Kuwaiti oilfields because it disagrees that the
fields should be under Kuwait's ownership.
   Steel said indications that some influential OPEC members are
taking steps to abide by a new oil production agreement also
supported prices.
   Gold and silver futures also rose on the Iraq-Kuwait news,
reflecting not only the inflationary effects of higher oil prices
but also the tendency among investors to seek the safety of
precious metals during times of international conflict.
   Peter Cardillo, director of commodity research at Jesup,
Josephthal &amp; Co., said gold also benefitted from strength in the
bond market Wednesday.
   ``Higher bond prices means lower interest rates. Lower interest
rates in turn are positive for the precious metals,'' he said.
   Gold futures settled $3.30 to $3.40 higher on New York's
Commodity Exchange with August at $373.30 a troy ounce; silver was
3.2 cents to 3.5 cents higher with August at $4.822 a troy ounce.
   Copper futures surged on the Commodity Exchange on buying that
some analysts linked to tight supplies of scrap copper. But others
said the move was not justified by market fundamentals and the
copper market is due for a downward correction.
   Copper settled 2.6 cents to 4.25 cents higher with August at
$1.292 a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures prices fell sharply on the Chicago
Board of Trade as the market's focus returned to bearish factors
such as slack export demand and favorable U.S. growing weather.
   The wheat market led the way down on indications that foreign
demand remains weak, despite the Agriculture Department's
announcement of a sale of nearly 248,000 metric tons to China at
subsidized prices.
   Weather forecasts projected a continuation of beneficial
conditions for corn and soybean development in the Midwest. After
the close, the National Weather Service issued a forecast for mild
temperatures and normal precipitation in the region during the
latter half of next week.
   Wheat futures settled 4 cents to 7{ cents lower with September
at $2.81\ a bushel; corn was 4} cents to 6 cents lower with
September at $2.55{ a bushel; oats were 5} cents to 6} cents lower
with September at $1.23 a bushel; soybeans were 9 cents to 15 cents
lower with August at $5.85 a bushel.
   The Board of Trade's announcement of Mahlmann's resignation
followed by one day the filing of a civil complaint in U.S.
District Court by federal regulators alleging fraudulent use by
Mahlmann's company, Stotler Group Inc., of $5.6 million in customer
funds. Mahlmann, who also has resigned from Stotler, said he played
no part in the allegedly improper transactions.
   Livestock and meat futures tumbled on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange in line with weaker cash cattle markets, large hog
slaughter numbers and expectations of weaker demand in the weeks
ahead.
   Live cattle settled .15 cent to .80 cent lower with August at
77.97 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .35 cent to .80 cent lower
with August at 89.47 cents a pound; live hogs were .42 cent to 1.17
cents lower with August at 60.05 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were 2 cents lower across the board with August at 49.22 cents a
pound.

   In another sign of sluggishness in the nation's
economy, businesses in July slashed orders for manufactured goods
and reduced inventories, the National Association of Purchasing
Management said Wednesday.
   It was the first drop in the group's measurement of the
manufacturing sector in three months and gave further weight to a
belief the nation's economy may be slipping into a recession.
   A measurement of activity by chief purchasing executives at more
than 300 industrial companies tumbled in July to its lowest rate
since January, in its sharpest monthly decline since January 1984.
   ``It reflects a weakening manufacturing sector, so the cutting
edge is getting dull,'' said Robert Brusca, chief economist for
Nikko Securities International Inc. ``Businessmen are going to
become even more cautious.''
   The association's Purchasing Managers Index fell to 47.4 percent
in July from 51.1 percent the previous month, ending three months
of increases. A reading below 50 indicates the manufacturing
economy generally is declining.
   The index, a composite of survey results on order levels,
prices, inventory and other areas, had been below 50 for 11
straight months. It averaged 48.8 percent in the first seven months
of 1990. July's reading was the lowest since 45.2 percent in
January.
   The decline was the sharpest since the index fell about nine
percentage points in early 1984, economists said.
   Orders from manufacturers tumbled to 46.2 percent from 54.9
percent in June. The rate was the lowest since January ``and will
undoubtedly weaken, if not decrease the recent modest growth in
production,'' the association said.
   The group's production index was above 50 for the sixth straight
month, but fell to 52.1 percent from 53.9 percent. It was the
lowest level in five months.
   Inventories declined for the 20th straight month, at a pace
sharper than the previous month. The group's inventories index fell
to 39.3 percent from 42.9 percent in June as purchasers cut the
volume of July orders and used existing inventories.
   ``The sharp decline in new orders apparently caused purchasers
to reduce the quantity of purchases and work off existing
inventories,'' said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the association's
business survey committee.
   ``The weakness of new orders in July now casts a shadow over the
previous expectations for continued growth in the economy in the
third quarter,'' he said.
   Bond prices, which improve on news of economic softening, surged
after the report was issued.
   The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond finished up more than $6.50
per $1,000 in face value, with its yield tumbling to 8.35 percent
from 8.41 percent late Tuesday.
   Some economists play down the significance of the purchasing
managers report because manufacturing accounts for only about 20
percent of economic activity. But others said manufacturing is a
leading indicator of overall business activity, and that even the
service sector has shown signs of weakness.
   ``I think it's telling us the economy is weak again and
businesses are making an effort to reduce inventories,'' said
Robert Chandross, chief economist with Lloyds Bank PLC in New York.
   In other segments, the report said export orders increased while
imports declined for the third consecutive month.
   Prices for manufacturing products, which include metals,
textiles, sulfur, lumber and fuels, held steady, indicating no
movement in inflation. Employment decreased for the 17th straight
month, at a slightly lesser rate than in June.

   Karsten Mahlmann resigned Wednesday as chairman
of the Chicago Board of Trade, the world's largest commodity
futures exchange, amid charges of wrongdoing at the trading company
he headed.
   Mahlmann, who is midway through an unprecedented fourth term as
the CBOT's chief, said he was stepping down ``in the overwhelming
interest of the Board of Trade and because of my deep love and
respect for the institution,'' according to a statement issued by
the exchange's board of directors.
   The board said it regretfully accepted the resignation, which
was effective immediately, ``in respect for his wishes and out of
the respect and love he has for the Board of Trade.''
   The board said it had elected CBOT Vice Chairman William F.
O'Connor to serve the remainder of Mahlmann's one-year term, which
ends Dec. 31.
   Earlier Wednesday, Mahlmann announced his resignation as head of
Stotler Group Inc., a beleaguered commodities firm that operates a
subsidiary accused of violating the Commodity Exchange Act.
   Mahlmann stressed in that announcement his ``non-involvement in
the day-to-day affairs'' of Stotler Group and its affiliates.
   ``I have had no day-to-day management responsibilities since
early 1988, and my position at Stotler was constantly eroded,''
Mahlmann said.
   ``I simply was not a party to the financial decisions which are
now being scrutinized by the exchange and the regulators,''
Mahlmann said.
   Mahlmann's resignation comes a day after federal regulators
filed a civil complaint in U.S. District Court against a Stotler
subsidiary, Stotler Funds Inc., a commodity pool operator owned by
Stotler Group.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission alleges that Stotler
Funds improperly used pools of clients' money that had been set up
for investing in commodity futures contracts.
   Stotler Funds instead used about 80 percent of one pool's assets
_ about $4.55 million _ to invest in Stotler Group, the government
said. Stotler Funds also lent $1 million from another pool to its
parent company.
   The complaint seeks a court order to stop these practices and
seeks the appointment of a temporary equity receiver.
   The complaint comes on the heels of other problems for Stotler
Group. Last week, it announced that its principal subsidiary, the
Stotler and Co. futures brokerage firm, would be shut down after
failing to meet minimum capital requirements.
   Mahlmann, who said he remains Stotler Group's largest
shareholder, said had he been aware of Stotler's recent financial
decisions, ``I would not have condoned them, and I would have taken
action to reverse them.''
   Mahlmann and other Stotler officials did not return phone calls
Wednesday for further comment.
   Mahlmann was serving his fourth one-year term as chairman. His
term would have expired in January.
   Some CBOT members believed Stotler's woes had damaged his
leadership abilities at the exchange, and they called for him to
resign, said John Frazier, director of the agricultural division at
Chicago-based Gerald Inc., an exchange member.
   Frazier said the members' concern was that the Stotler
predicament had hurt Mahlmann's ability to lead the CBOT's battle
over regulation of the futures industry.
   The exchange wants the CFTC to maintain control over stock-index
futures, but the Bush adminstration is seeking to transfer that
authority to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees
the stock market.
   Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., said Wednesday the House Energy
and Commerce Committee would look ``into the facts and
circumstances surrounding the recent collapse of Stotler &amp; Co.''
   Dingell, the committee's chairman said ``these events raise
serious questions about the adequacy of regulation and oversight in
the futures industry.''
   Dingell's comments came in a letter to the heads of the SEC and
the CFTC.
   Mahlmann began working as a runner at the exchange in 1957,
shortly after graduation from high school in his native Germany. He
became a member of the CBOT in 1963, after work in its cash grains
department had earned him the nickname ``Cash.''
   He became director of the exchange in 1983, vice chairman in
1986, and was first elected chairman in 1987. He beat Leslie
Rosenthal, a former CBOT chairman, in a close election in January.
   O'Connor has been a member of the CBT since 1955, and is a
partner in O'Connor and Co., which he founded in 1957. Elected CBOT
vice chairman in 1990, O'Connor is also vice chairman of the
MidAmerica Commodity Exchange, an affiliate of the CBOT.

   The Caribbean tourism industry
watched developments in Trinidad carefully this week, aware that
violence on one island can hurt business throughout the region.
   ``I hope they get this resolved quickly. The longer it goes on,
the worse it will look to the traveling public,'' said Clive

   The Caribbean Tourism Organization has sent telegrams to travel
agencies saying other Caribbean countries were safe.
   Barbara LeBlanc, a writer for the daily San Juan Star newspaper,
observed that even the hint of danger drives away tourists looking
for a ``fantasy'' island.
   ``The international tourist's knowledge of democracy is awfully
small. There is very little doubt that problems like this hurt the
region,'' said John Bell, executive vice president of the Caribbean
Hotel Association.
   Bell said it was fortunate the Moslem uprising and looting in
Trinidad happened during the summer slow period. The prime winter
season is five months away.
   Hotelier Jag Mehta, manager of San Juan's Radisson Normandie
Hotel, said Puerto Rico will escape the fallout from the negative
publicity and could benefit from tourists looking for safer places
to visit.
   ``It's too far from us. Fortunately, The New York Times and
other newspapers showed maps. So people know where the problem
was,'' he said.
   Airports were closed Friday evening on the twin islands of
Trinidad and Tobago and did not re-open until Sunday, and then only
during daylight hours. Some airlines canceled flights to the
islands until conditions returned to normal.
   Trinidad's 22-hour curfew, 6 p.m. to 12 noon daily, tied up
traffic between the Piarco international airport and Tobago's Crown
Point airport, said Noel Sweeney, director of the Trinidad and
Tobago Tourism Development Authority.
   Interviewed by telephone, Sweeney said a flight was leaving
Wednesday with about 100 tourists who were stranded on Tobago after
their vacations ended.
   Dallas Vonortengren of Kawana Travel in New York said the
disruptions in flight schedules made it difficult to get tourists
out of the area.
   ``The situation is much too unstable to advise travelers to go
there,'' she said.
   The violence is likely to set back Trinidad and Tobago's efforts
to develop tourism, particularly on the island of Tobago.
   The country's economy, dominated by the oil industry, is in a
slump because of low world oil prices. The government has earmarked
increased tourism as one new source of employment and foreign
exchange earnings.
   Sweeney said 218,000 people visited Trinidad and Tobago in 1989,
including about 29,000 cruise ship visitors.
   The major tourist attraction in Trinidad is the annual Carnival,
which the Caribbean Islands Handbook says some consider ``safer,
more welcoming to visitors and artistically more stimulating than
its nearest rival in Rio de Janeiro.''
   Neighboring Tobago has a world famous reef, Buccoo Reef, known
for its spectacular fish, diving and clear warm waters.
