<HEAD>Orangutan Smuggled To Paris Returns To Malaysia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ralfone, a 5-year-old orangutan
who escaped from a crate in Paris three years ago and led
authorities to a dozen other smuggled primates, is returning to the
Malaysian island of Borneo.
   The reddish ape was handed to Malaysia's science, technology and
environment minister, Stephen Yong, on Tuesday in a brief ceremony
witnessed by five Association of Southeast Asian Nations
environment ministers who had just ended a regional conference in
Kuala Lumpur.
   She will be taken to the Sepilok orangutan sanctuary in
Sandakan, 1,030 miles east of Kuala Lumpur on Borneo island, then
returned to the jungle after about six months of rehabilitation,
officials said.
   Mohamed Khir Johari, Malaysian president of the World Wide Fund
for Nature, said officials of the organization and the French
government seized Ralfone at the Paris airport in May 1987.
   The ape, with another orangutan and 11 macaque monkeys,
apparently was headed for Mexico. All the animals were in poor
health and had received little or no food and water, Khir said.
   ``How she was smuggled remains a mystery,'' Khir said.
   Ralfone's escape led to the discovery of the other animals, he
said. The second orangutan will remain in the Antwerp Zoo in
Belgium because it has become accustomed to captivity, and the
monkeys have been sent to the Paris zoo, he said.
   Orangutans live wild only in the jungles of Borneo and Sumatra,
where ther are an estimated 30,000 of them.

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   David Johnny has witnessed so many
atrocities in Liberia's war, including seeing the bullet-riddled
bodies of family members, that his eyes are blank and his face
shows no emotion as he recounts them.
   His tragedy is one of thousands in a nearly 6-month-old war
whose chief victims are civilians targeted by both sides because of
their tribal affiliations.
   The horrors for Johnny, 18, began two weeks ago when rebels
attacked the village near the Bong iron ore mine where he attended
boarding school.
   ``They start killing the soldier people there, just spraying
them with their guns. In one group they gunned, I saw at least 20
soldiers die,'' he said in an interview at a church mission here,
where he was given shelter and reunited with a brother.
   ``Then they surrounded the compound for Mandingos and Krahns and
just started cutting the people's throats with the knives from
their guns.''
   Johnny and a school friend, who also witnessed the killings, are
members of the Gio tribe. Many rebels also are Gios and have been
slaughtering civilians of President Samuel Doe's Krahn tribe, and
Mandingos, whom the rebels accuse of enriching themselves during
Doe's 10-year rule.
   There are no reports of rebels killing Gio or Mano people. But
because many of them support the guerrillas, they have become the
target of government soldiers.
   Johnny said he and his friend fled into the forest and hid there
for two days, living on nuts and leaves before making their way 30
miles south to Grimes Farm, a village near the town of Kakata where
his parents lived.
   They spent the night with Johnny's father, who is a subsistence
farmer and retired rubber plantation worker, and his mother and two
sisters.
   The next morning, June 9, the two friends were out picking pine
nuts for the family when then heard gunfire, Johnny said.
   ``We waited until the shooting stopped, then tried to creep into
the village through the bushes. But the soldiers spied us and fired
at us, touching me with a bullet,'' he said, displaying a graze on
his hip.
   ``My friend hauled me by the hand and dragged me into the
forest, and we hide there for two days in fear.''
   When they crept out and went back to the family hut, Johnny
found the bodies of his father and two sisters. His mother was
missing.
   The friends spent another two days working their way through the
bush to the village of Cowway, where Johnny's younger brother,
Joseph, 15, was staying. But before they got there, the village was
attacked.
   Joseph picked up the story. ``Men with guns came shooting, they
killed many people and hurt others. I don't know what happened to
the woman I was staying with.''
   Joseph said the attackers wore uniforms, but did not know
whether they were rebels or government soldiers. Adults who came
from the same village said only Gios lived there and that the
killers were Doe's soldiers.
   Joseph said he walked for almost three days until he got to
Monrovia, where he sought shelter at Don Bosco Polytechnic, one of
six church missions sheltering Mano and Gio people fearing attacks
by soldiers.
   When David reached Cowway, he was told his brother had gone to a
church in Monrovia. The brothers were reunited last week.
   They got some good news during the weekend. A family friend told
them their mother, Musu Johnny, was alive. She had been seriously
wounded in the Grimes Farm attack and was being treated at Kakata
Hospital.
   The town is behind rebel lines and there was no way for the
brothers to check the report.
   They are among about 250,000 people who have fled the fighting,
many to neighboring countries.
   About 600 sleep on mats in classrooms at Don Bosco, a technical
and business school run by the Salesian Roman Catholic priests, who
are based in Stockton, England.
   The school's dean, the Rev. Brian Jerstice, has been busy
organizing classroom instruction for the many refugee children,
making sure the makeshift clinic has enough staff and medication,
distributing donated clothing and worrying about food supplies and
sanitary conditions.
   ``We thought we could put up 200 people; now there are 600
crowded here and there is no more sleeping space,'' Jerstice said.
``The hardest part is having to turn people away.''

<HEAD>East-West Thaw Comes Slowly to Surviving Cold War Conflict</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LUANDA, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite the global thaw in East-West
relations, the Cold War is chilling efforts to end Angola's 15-year
civil war.
   Billions of dollars worth of Soviet and U.S. weapons have kept
the war going between the Marxist government and Jonas Savimbi's
UNITA rebels.
   Though the superpowers now want to spend less on regional
conflicts, neither seems willing to see its client lose the
struggle for power in one of Africa's potentially richest nations.
   When Portuguese colonizers pulled out in 1975 a tribal-based
conflict between northern, central and southern Angolans soon
became a surrogate war as the Kremlin battled the West for
influence in southern Africa.
   Some 50,000 Cuban soldiers and the best Red Army hardware were
sent to help the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola,
MPLA, which declared independence and became the government in
Luanda.
   Most Western nations, except the United States, Israel and South
Africa, recognized the MPLA government headed by Agostinho Neto.
South Africa allied its army with UNITA, the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola.
   South African aid to the rebels officially ended with regional
peace accords signed by Angola and Cuba in December 1988, but UNITA
still receives U.S. military assistance thought to be $50 million
this fiscal year.
   Cuba has already sent home more than 33,000 soldiers under the
agreement, but Western estimates put continuing Soviet support at
between $600 million and $1.5 billion a year.
   Despite efforts by African and European diplomats and a letter
from U.S. congressmen to President Bush urging him to raise the
Angolan issue with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at their recent
summit, there is still superpower involvement.
   ``Backing continues, although it's getting much more difficult
to support aid increases to Savimbi in the current East-West
climate,'' said one Western official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said last week that U.S.
supplies might be cut off if Luanda agrees to free and fair
elections. But the Bush administration has since asked Congress to
earmark an added $10 to $15 million a year for the rebels.
   Congressional sources say the rebels would use some of the money
to buy Hawk anti-aircraft missiles, adding to an arsenal of
shoulder-fired Stinger rockets.
   Yuri Yukalov, a leading Kremlin diplomat specializing in
southern Africa, recently pledged that arms supplies to Luanda
would go on as long as the war continues, according to Portuguese
news reports.
   An article from a recent edition of the Soviet weekly New Times
published in the Portuguese media said that between 600 and 1,000
Soviet military advisers are still in Angola, though not actively
involved in the war.
   Foreign Minister Pedro de Castro van Dunem of Angola has
criticized South Africa and the United States for continuing to
funnel UNITA aid through Zaire.
   President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire brought Savimbi and
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos together for an initial truce
last June 22 at Gbadolite, but the cease-fire collapsed days later
in confusion over peace terms.
   Government military campaigns this year have been countered by
increased rebel urban sabotage that is crippling Angola's economy.
   A second round of low-level peace talks ended Monday in Portugal
and a Portuguese official said the two sides had agreed to meet
again, probably next month. However, Savimbi recalled his
delegation for consultations after differences arose on the third
day of negotiations, and hard-liners on both sides are still
pressing for more military campaigns.
   UNITA has agreed to recognize the Angolan state and dos Santos
as its head, while the government has indicated it might agree to
free elections after peace. Neither side can agree on terms for
monitoring a cease-fire, diplomats say.
   Opposition to elections in the single-party state is strong,
especially among Marxist hard-liners pitted against the more
moderate dos Santos.
   Security Minister Kundi Payama recently told MPLA militants that
Angola would maintain its Marxist-Leninist system ``because
capitalism has never served the interests of the Angolan people.''
   Billboards around the capital proclaim 1990 ``the year for
broader democracy'' and the ruling party's third congress, slated
for December, might produce steps toward multiparty democracy if a
truce is fixed before then, Western observers say.
   Dos Santos has been edging away from Comunist economics since
1987 and has brought pragmatists such as de Castro van Dunem into
the Politburo and his inner circle. Last week, he promoted
moderates in a Cabinet reshuffle.
   Most of Angola's trade and its $5.5 billion foreign debt is with
the West.
   The United States, whose oil companies have major interests in
Angola, have withheld diplomatic recognition as an incentive to get
UNITA represented in government.

   Despite appeals for it to stop, 10-year-old Craig
Shergold receives hundreds of get-well cards daily from strangers
trying to help him win a place in the Guinness Book of World
Records.
   Craig, who suffers from a rare form of brain cancer, broke the
record months ago, but the cards keep coming. More than 16 million
have arrived.
   ``We don't want any more cards because it looks as though we're
taking cards for no reason,'' Craig's mother, Marion, said from the
family home in Carshalton, south London.
   ``Every card says `we hope you make it in the record books,' so
it seems kind of greedy to keep accepting them,'' she said.
   Donald McFarlan, the editor of the Guinness book, said he tried
to dissuade the Shergolds from their record bid and warned them
that it would spiral out of control.
   ``Our experience is that once it goes international it is
absolutely unstoppable,'' McFarlan said.
   The get-well card category was discontinued once after Mario
Morby held the record with 1,000,265 cards. McFarlan said the
13-year-old English boy is recovering from his leukemia but the
family still receives cards three years later.
   McFarlan revived the category after intense pressure, and Craig
now holds the record.
   ``I thought I had decided over a year ago that (Mario Morby)
would be the last one, but it is very difficult to hold out against
an emotive press. I couldn't do my job _ well-intentioned, very
sentimental people called me at work and I received quite a lot of
hate mail, including one that said, `if you have children I hope
they die of cancer.'''
   Craig's record will be included in the 1991 edition published in
October, he said. Guinness hasn't announced a specific figure for
their book, but the count is above 16 million.
   The editor said he was trying to protect the Shergolds ``from an
ugly situation, particularly if Craig had died. The cards would
have kept coming.''
   Craig had an operation in January 1988 that removed
three-quarters of a brain tumor. Mrs. Shergold said doctors believe
chemotherapy and radiotherapy have successfully stemmed the
disease's spread into his spinal cord.
   ``He's in wonderful spirits,'' Mrs. Shergold said.
   When Craig is feeling up to it, he visits the Wallington Post
Office, the local depot responsible for delivery of the cards.
   ``Last night we had 68 trays of about 350 letters per tray for
Craig Shergold. Those were mostly from the States and some from
South Africa,'' said Michael Wilkinson, the post office manager.
``Last week we had 51,000 items and judging by yesterday and
today's load, we'll have even more this week.''
   The crush causes extra work for the post office, Wilkinson said.
   The cards are stuffed into bags and delivered to the Sutton
United Football team club house, where 30 of Craig's family and
friends spend four hours every Thursday night counting between
50,000 and 100,000 cards.
   Teddy bears, baseball caps and Japanese origami cranes have
arrived with the truck loads of cards. Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and pop star Michael Jackson were among those who wrote,
Wilkinson said.
   The appeal started by word of mouth Sept. 24, 1989.
   ``Some well-intentioned but misguided people sent out chain
faxes, which requested the plea for cards be sent to 10 business
associates,'' McFarlan said. ``The faxes went to every country
where the fax is known, and when you look at the third generation
of faxes, the arithmetic gets frightening.''
   The used stamps have been sold and the cards recycled, raising
$34,200 for leukemia research and the Royal Marsden Hospital, where
Craig gets weekly treatments.

   Fox Broadcasting won ugly, as they say in
sports, breaking into the top five in the ratings with TV's most
boorish families, ``The Simpsons'' and the Bundys of ``Married ...
With Children.''
   ``The Simpsons'' was the No. 3 show last week, and the equally
grumpy but non-animated brood of ``Married ... With Children'' was
No. 4, the A.C. Nielsen Co. said Tuesday.
   It was the first time in Fox's four-year history that it broke
into the top five, and the proud parents were jubilant.
   ``We're extremely excited about this,'' said Fox spokesman
Michael Peikoff.
   Fox's unprecedented ratings were helped by the Big Three
networks being knee-deep in reruns.
   They also benefited from 10-year-old Bart Simpson's sawtooth
head blazoned across Rolling Stone magazine, T-shirts and the pages
of news magazines.
   But Fox's victory was far from sweeping. In overall ratings, NBC
was still the No. 1 network, receiving an average rating of 10.4.
CBS was second with 9.7 and ABC last with 9.3. Each ratings point
represents 921,000 households.
   In a top 10 where only one show _ ``The Seinfeld Chronicles'' on
NBC _ was not a rerun, ABC's ``Roseanne'' was the top-rated
program. The wisecracking bar crowd of NBC's ``Cheers'' was No. 2.
   NBC's ``The Cosby Show,'' which will face off against ``The
Simpsons'' in the fall, fell to fifth place.
   Here are the top 10 shows, their network and rating:
   ``Roseanne,'' ABC, 16.8; ``Cheers,'' NBC, 16.7; ``The
Simpsons,'' Fox, 14.7; ``Married ... With Children,'' Fox, 14.5;
``The Cosby Show,'' NBC, 14.2; ``A Different World'' and ``Empty
Nest,'' tied, NBC, 14; ``Coach,'' ABC, 13.8; ``Designing Women,''
CBS, ``The Golden Girls,'' NBC, ``The Seinfeld Chronicles,'' NBC,
tied, 13.6.
   There was no news in the network news wars. ABC remained No. 1
by a wide margin with a 9.2 average. CBS had a 7.8 and NBC a 7.5.

   After 22 years as an obsessive collector,
Peter P. Cecere is putting his Ecuadoran python skin, his Japanese
kamikaze waistband and his antique urinal from Holland _ and much,
much more _ on the auction block this weekend.
   Crated and trucked away from Cecere's home in suburban Reston,
Va., are scores of ceremonial masks and devil dolls from South
America. He's blown his last oompah on the old brass tuba from
Bohemia. He's bid adios to the Spanish butcher's shop sign,
decorated with bull, goat and ram's heads, 16 meat hooks and 58
iron flowers with light sockets.
   Frankly, he says, it's a huge relief.
   ``Your collection becomes your wife, your children, your
mistress,'' he said. ``It owns you and limits your options. In a
certain benign way, it enslaves you.''
   Cecere estimates he has spent $175,000 compulsively gobbling up
folk art, antiques, outrageous gewgaws and wondrous kitsch during
his travels as a Foreign Service officer with the U.S. Information
Agency in Bolivia, Uruguay, Mexico, Ecuador and Barcelona, Spain.
   He collected seashells, toy trains and Civil War memorabilia as
a kid in Brooklyn, N.Y., but his passion became a consuming mania
in 1968, when he visited an exhibition of Indian folk art in
Cochabamba, Bolivia.
   ``It was an apocalyptic event, like the scales falling from the
eyes of St. Paul,'' he said. ``I went ape. I was jumping up and
down with joy and unbridled happiness. I knew my life would never
be the same. I started buying stuff right there. The madness had
begun.''
   At one point, he was spending $1,400 a month on things like
ostrich eggs, walrus tusks, octopus traps and antique flatirons,
tobacco tins, patent medicine bottles, hand-forged tools and a 19th
century infant potty seat with original leather upholstery.
   He couldn't resist those fantastic pinball machine panels, the
antique wire ``turkey foot grabbers,'' a set of Spanish sheep bells
and the seven-foot papier-mache woman's skeleton _ clad in hot pink
gown and gilded spiked heels _ from a Mexican ``Day of Death''
festival.
   Ditto for the antique horse hair clipper, the 1928 Buick
radiator cap, the table lamp mounted on a Uruguayan firefighter's
helmet, and the tractor tire shoes with the words ``love'' and
``peace'' inscribed on the soles.
   Before he quit cold turkey last fall, Cecere had amassed more
than 20,000 artifacts. His five-bedroom house was overflowing. The
stuff filled the bathrooms and even hung from the ceilings. The
walls were literally buckling and cracking under the weight, he
said.
   He thought of quitting his job, buying a farm in the Virginia
countryside and building a museum to display his collection. He'd
do a little antique dealing on the side to help pay the bills.
   ``Then I began to see the oppressive side to that dream,'' he
said. ``I realized I would be a baby sitter for my collection. My
freedom would be severely limited by my things.
   ``I stood up and looked at this wall of 230 masks and said,
`I'll keep 40 and the rest of you go.' I ran around the house
sentencing everything to death. `You, you, you _ go!' Now I can get
a thrill looking at something, but I don't have to own it.''
   The bulk of his collection, which filled the equivalent of
nearly four tractor-trailers, will be sold this weekend at the Laws
auction house in Manassas, Va. Auctioneer H.L. ``Sonny'' Laws calls
it a ``little Smithsonian'' of folk and ethnic art.
   An ebullient man with a wild, salt-and-pepper beard, Cecere, 50,
is returning to Mexico City next month for another stint as a USIA
cultural officer. This time, he'll take along his chisels and
workbench to pursue his new passion as a primitive wood carver.
   He's already sculpted several Adam and Eve figures, a former
Baltimore stripper named Norma Vincent Peel, a six-foot ice cream
cone and a butcher in memory of his father, a former Brooklyn
longshoreman and meat wholesaler's clerk.
   Cecere tried carving an Abraham Lincoln, but ``the more I hit
that mother with my chisel, the less he looked like Lincoln.'' So
it became a pastry chef, modeled after Brooklyn baker Ralph
Rispoli. Cecere calls it ``Ralph Lincoln.''
   ``My carvings are whimsical fun,'' he said. ``For me, it's a
smile and a belly laugh. That's what art should be.''

   He has hugged PLO chief Yasser Arafat; he has
visited Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi; he has praised Cuba's Fidel
Castro as ``a tower of strength;'' and he has advocated government
control of South Africa's minerals and banks.
   Nelson Mandela is making some Americans feel uncomfortable, even
as thousands of others are pouring out love and adulation for the
black South African hero who spent 27 years in jail and is now
negotiating with the white government to end its monopoly on power.
   The Bush administration is emphasizing Mandela's achievement
since his prison release five months ago in giving black South
Africans hope that their racial segregation, known as apartheid,
may soon end.
   ``He is the only one with the credibility and following in both
the white and black communities who could have brought this off,''
said a State Department official, describing what President Bush
and Secretary of State James A. Baker III will talk to Mandela
about next Monday.
   But some difficult questions also will be raised.
   Baker, in fact, already brought up some questions with Mandela
when the two met at Namibia's independence celebrations last March.
Baker wanted to know whether Mandela's African National Congress
has renounced the violence that landed its leadership in jail or
exile in the 1960s.
   Mandela indicated that he favored negotiations rather than
violence to end apartheid and the white minority's domination of 28
million blacks, said a source familiar with the meeting.
   But in public comments, Mandela has been less diplomatic. ``The
only type of violence we accept is organized violence in the form
of armed action, which is properly controlled and where the targets
have been carefully selected,'' he said at a news conference
earlier this month.
   Baker and Bush also want to ask Mandela about his stated support
for government control of South Africa's major economic sectors.
   Government control of the economy has failed in Eastern Europe
and in other African countries, ``and we hope Mr. Mandela will be
cognizant of those failures and look to private enterprise, a
market economy system,'' said the State Department official.
   Conservatives in Congress, where Mandela is being accorded the
rare honor for a civilian of addressing a joint meeting of the
Senate and House next Tuesday, are uneasy but also aware that
criticizing Mandela is not a popular cause.
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., of the House Africa subcommittee, said
he recognizes that Mandela is playing a vital role in efforts to
abolish apartheid. ``But we have severe concerns about the things
Mandela has said about nationalizing industries and his open
support for the South African Communist Party,'' said an aide to
the congressman who asked not to be identified.
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., also admires Mandela, but adds, ``At
the same time, I think some caution is due so long as he fulsomely
praises Gadhafi, Castro, Arafat.''
   Hyde said Mandela might moderate his support for such leaders,
as well as his advocacy of socialism, as negotiations with the
government of President F.W. de Klerk progress and as he exposes
himself to world public opinion during his extensive travels.
   Mandela's defenders explain his support for Gadhafi, Arafat,
Castro and other Third World leaders as a tribute to their military
and political support in the long years when the ANC was banned and
exiled.
   Analysts regard Mandela's support for the South African
Communist Party, which like the ANC was banned for many years, in
the same light.
   The Communist Party was the ANC's channel for Soviet weapons and
is an integral part of the South African opposition movement, said
Pauline Baker of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
   In any case, with the demise of communism in Eastern Europe,
Mandela's support for the South African party can no longer be
viewed as a threat, analysts say.
   Mandela and the newly unbanned ANC are not locked into socialism
or other economic dogma, but they are looking for ideas that will
give blacks a share of the country's lands and wealth, Ms. Baker
said.
   ``They are open to suggestions, they are on a learning curve,''
she said.
   Mandela edged toward appeasing some critics at two recent
meetings with Jewish leaders in which he expressed support for
Israel's right to exist.

   Once upon a time in Hollywood, an actress who
wears quirky clothes went to a cable mogul. She carried two bags
full of illustrated fairy tales and said she wanted to turn them
into shows.
   Why, sure, the mogul said. And this is no fairy tale.
   It's how Shelley Duvall became a mogul herself when, fresh from
playing Olive Oyl in the movie ``Popeye,'' she got the okay in 1980
to produce ``Faerie Tale Theater'' for the Showtime cable channel.
   A friend had warned her the major networks would be wasted time,
she says, ``so I walked into Showtime and the head of the company
was laughing at me with my two cloth knitting bags full of books.''
   ``But they gave me an order for three shows right off the bat,''
she said. ``And thank goodness they had the courage to put their
faith in Olive Oyl as the producer. Otherwise, I wouldn't have
gotten here.''
   Duvall, who played Rapunzel in one ``Faerie Tale,'' since has
produced two other Showtime series, ``Tall Tales &amp; Legends'' and
``Nightmare Classics,'' and a cable remake last year of ``Dinner at
Eight.''
   Her latest effort, running tonight and Friday on the Disney
Channel, is a gently bent music special called ``Mother Goose Rock
'N Rhyme.'' Like ``Faerie Tale Theater,'' it also can be bought or
rented in video stores.
   As is the Duvall custom, the special does things differently.
Its childhood-tale characters are played by a variety of performers
you wouldn't normally see in your basic Mother Goose show _ like ZZ
Top, Debbie Harry, Little Richard and the ever-popular Pia Zadora.
   Duvall, who also appears as Little Bo Peep, started that which
led to her producing career while playing Olive Oyl to Robin
Williams' Popeye in ``Popeye,'' one of seven Robert Altman films
she's done.
   The film musical was filmed on the tiny island of Malta, and
``since I'd been told we were going to be there a while, I figured
I'd better bring a book,'' she says. ``So I brought along a book of
Grimm's fairy tales.
   ``I was reading `The Frog Prince' one day, and thought, `Oh,
God, wouldn't Robin make a hilarious frog?'''
   He wound up merrily croaking away in the first ``Faerie Tale,''
directed by former Monty Python inmate Eric Idle. She enlisted
similar top-name folk in subsequent efforts, appealing to their
desire to do the offbeat.
   This led to such pairings as Elizabeth McGovern and Vanessa
Redgrave in ``Snow White,'' Liza Minnelli and Tom Conti in ``The
Princess and the Pea,'' and, by golly, Ricky Schroder and Joan
Collins in ``Hansel and Gretel.''
   Duvall, now 40, was born in Houston, and her speech still
retains a trace of Lone Star twang. She has continued acting in
films, but not much. Her last work, in 1987, was in the Steve
Martin comedy, ``Roxanne.''
   Duvall the actress wants to emote more. But Duvall the producer
still has more things to produce, among them a new version of Jack
London's ``Call of the Wild'' for Ted Turner's new TNT cable
network.
   She also would like to tackle the Greek myths, which you don't
hardly see on TV these days.
   There also is a wild and crazy dream involving the late Jay
Ward's ``Rocky and Bullwinkle'' and ``Fractured Fairy Tales,''
those hip, literate and bad-pun cartoon series of TV's yesteryear.
   She loves them, she says, always did, and ``I would like to go
back and get the same group that made them together again, and have
them make some more. Because it's too good not to have on
television.''

   Elsewhere in television ...
   REASON NO. 397 TO CONTINUE BREATHING: Even though the long-ago
marriage of Tiny Tim to Miss Vicki on the ``Tonight'' show didn't
last, there are those who still believe in love on TV. ``The Joan
Rivers Show,'' whose topic this week is marriage, on Thursday will
tape the in-studio wedding of a New Jersey couple. Rivers will be
matron of honor, the ever-popular Pia Zadora will sing and all this
will be broadcast Friday.
   LABOR FRONT: NBC, which had said it would implement today a
four-year ``final'' contract offer made in March to a major
technicians' union at NBC, won't put the contract into effect now.
In return, officials of the National Association of Broadcast
Employees and Technicians will submit a recently modified NBC offer
to its 2,373 members at NBC. They previously rejected NBC's first
offer.

   House Democrats frustrated by a stalemate with
President Bush over budget cuts and taxes are starting to
appropriate spending for next year, beginning with $20.8 billion
for energy and water projects.
   Ignoring the absence of an overall budget accord, the House
voted 355-59 Tuesday to raise by $350 million what Bush would spend
in fiscal 1991 to clean up the nation's atomic weapons complex. The
House vote also would launch 25 water projects opposed by the
administration.
   ``What the House has done is to flaunt or doom the (budget)
summit,'' said Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., as several efforts to
cut the spending were defeated. ``This is something that is going
to get this house in great trouble.''
   The measure is the first of 13 appropriation bills for the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 to pass either the House or Senate.
Until Tuesday, congressional leaders had stalled action in hopes of
reaching an overall budget agreement with the White House.
   Negotiators have been meeting for five weeks on trying to cut
$45 billion to $60 billion from next year's deficit, which could
reach as high as $208 billion, according to administration
estimates.
   Participants in the budget talks said the administration was
ready to present its deficit-cutting plan today. An official who
spoke on condition of anonymity said the White House would offer a
plan to cut up to $50 billion.
   Democrats, admitting that cuts will have to be made later, said
one reason to start acting on spending bills is to put pressure on
the administration.
   ``If we do not proceed, that would be the worst way to deal with
the budget summit,'' said Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of
the House Budget Committee. ``In a vacuum in which we do nothing,
no pressure will be brought to get action.''
   ``If we don't pass this, we'll be here at Christmastime, and I
don't like Washington at Christmastime.''' added Rep. John Myers of
Indiana, the ranking Republican on the House energy and water
appropriations subcommittee.
   As passed, the bill would provide the Army Corps of Engineers
$3.6 billion, nearly a half-billion dollars more than it received
last year, for its 550 water projects.
   The 87 water projects run by the Interior Department's Bureau of
Reclamation would get $957 million, nearly $7 million less than
this year but still $42 million above what Bush sought.
   But the bulk of the money _ $10.9 billion _ would go to
maintaining the Energy Department's vast atomic weapons complex,
including $3.3 billion for environmental cleanups around nuclear
warhead manufacturing plants.
   That is 15 percent more than the president requested and 66
percent above what is being spent this year on cleaning up
radioactive debris around the plants. That effort is expected to
cost between $50 billion and $200 billion over the next 20 years.
   The nearly $4.5 billion in non-defense Energy Department
programs includes Bush's request of $318 million for the
superconducting super collider in Texas, of which $169 million is
devoted toward beginning construction.
   The massive atom-smasher _ consisting of an underground tunnel
54 miles in circumference _ is intended to explore subatomic
particles and allow researchers to study matter and the origin of
the universe.
   Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., deplored the super collider as the
``emergence of a scientific-industrial complex to replace the
military industrial complex,'' but he offered no amendment to scale
back spending on it.
   Officials estimate that by its anticipated completion in 1998,
the super collider will cost $8 billion, nearly double the $4.4
billion predicted three years ago.
   The bill also includes:
   _$115 million for solar energy research, $14 million more than
Bush requested and $32 million above this year's spending.
   _$310 million for nuclear power research, $48 million less than
the president's request and $38 million below current spending.
   _$315 million for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   _$135 million for the Tennessee Valley Authority, $44 million
above Bush's request and $16 million above current spending.
   _$150 million for the Appalachian Regional Commission, $2.1
million above last year and $100 million more than the
administration wanted.

   Police responding to a trouble call at a bar
Tuesday night discovered the bodies of three people who had been
shot to death and a fourth person who'd been wounded.
   The bodies were found in Pat's Old Tumbleweed Tavern around 9
p.m. shortly after the call was received from a telephone operator,
said police Capt. Dennis Madison.
   ``We know the person still alive was familiar with one of the
female victims at the bar,'' Madison said. ``There was no one else
we're aware of at the bar at the time of shootings.''
   Authorties found the bodies of two women and a man, Madison said.
   A man who was the only person alive in the bar suffered gunshot
wounds to the face, and was taken to St. Mary's Hospital. He was to
be transferred by helicopter to an Oklahoma City hospital.
   The victims' identities were not immediately available.
   Enid is a city of 50,000 people about 85 miles northwest of
Oklahoma City.

   A constitutional amendment against burning the
American flag is speeding toward a House floor vote, with critics
saying ``the momentum is with us'' and backers grumbling about too
much haste.
   ``It's going to be close,'' Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, said
Tuesday as his House Judiciary Committee sent the measure to the
full House for a vote Thursday. ``It would be close this week, it
would be close next week.''
   Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., agreed with that assessment.
   Brooks said the 19-17 vote by which the panel sent the measure
to the floor _ with no recommendation for or against _ was a sign
that the final outcome also would be by a narrow margin.
   To become part of the Constitution, the amendment must get 289
votes in the House and 67 in the Senate plus ratification by 38
state legislatures.
   President Bush is pressing for approval of the amendment, which
would allow Congress and the states to outlaw burning or other
desecration of the flag.
   House and Senate Democratic leaders oppose the measure, saying
it would undermine the Constitution's First Amendment guarantee of
free speech.
   The amendment was sidetracked last year when critics prevailed
on lawmakers to pass the 1989 Flag Protection Act. That law was
held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court last week, rekindling
debate over the amendment.
   ``The momentum is with us ... We're picking up a vote here and a
vote there,'' said Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., a leading critic.
   Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., chairman of the House Rules
Committee, scheduled a meeting of his panel today to clear the
amendment for floor action Thursday. He said he was prepared to
waive House rules if necessary to keep the measure rolling.
   But supporters said the House needed more time to weigh the
issue.
   Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., said he would object to any
waiving of a House rule under which most measures must wait three
days after committee approval before coming to a floor vote.
   ``They don't want to give time for the Veterans of Foreign Wars
and the (American) Legion and the rest of the organizations to
mount a letter-writing campaign,'' said Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill.
   He said he would prefer to see a floor vote delayed until next
week, ``although I wouldn't want it beyond next week.''
   Republicans said various veterans' groups had agreed to send out
mass mailings and buy newspaper advertisements to generate pressure
for the plan, although some ads were not scheduled to appear until
Friday.
   Uncommitted lawmakers reported no surge in lobbying on the
issue. ``I haven't seen any organized pressure,'' said Rep. Terry
Bruce, D-Ill., who has yet to reach a decision and is approaching
the amendment warily.
   ``It is the kind of issue that makes you think,'' he said. ``I
think we should do what an appeals court does in some of these
cases and take it under advisement. I think we should go nice and
slow.''
   Last week the House civil and constitutional rights subcommittee
voted 5-3 to advance the amendment to the full Judiciary Committee,
but it did so with an adverse recommendation.
   The measure comes up for a hearing in the Senate Judiciary
Committee on Thursday.
   The House Judiciary Committee acted after critics attacked the
measure in strong terms. Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., said the
description of the amendment as tailored for use on the fall
campaign trail was ``one of the things that has made me sickest
throughout this entire debate.''
   Conservative supporters of the amendment fired back, with Hyde
saying:
   ``Those who are shocked and revolted and frustrated by the
excesses of the counterculture, the pornography, the obscenities
that inundate our entertainment industry, the drugs, the AIDS
explosion, the high abortion rate, view flag burning as one more
slap in the face at the millions of veterans who found enough
values in America to give their lives in combat.''

<HEAD>Government Sets New Spelling Rules for French Language</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE GANLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The arbiters of the French language have made a few
corrections that will force all its citizens to relearn how to
spell.
   The 15 pages of spelling changes recommended Tuesday by the High
Council of the French Language have been accepted by Premier Michel
Rocard, who said he will ask National Education Minister Lionel
Jospin to assure they are taught in all schools as of next year.
   The Council said the spelling changes are fewer than those made
in the 19th century as compared to the 18th century.
   ``It was never a question that the government legislate in such
matters. The language belongs to those who use it ...'' Rocard
said. ``But it is up to the government ... to favor that usage
which appears most satisfactory.''
   Rocard called on Francophone Minister Alain Decaux to meet with
dictionary specialists, publishing houses, the press and others
dealing with the written word to find the best way to bring the
changes into normal usage.
   The five categories of spelling changes affect hyphens, accent
marks, the plural form of compound words, accordance of the past
participle in reflexive verbs and anomalies.
   The hyphen, much used in French, is going out of style,
according to the Council, which is all but discarding it. Even the
hyphen previously used in words borrowed from English such as
``cow-boy,'' ``strip-tease'' or ``week-end'' will disappear.
   More drastic changes do away with the feminine ``e'' or plural
``s'' at the end of past participles when they are used with
reflexive verbs _ but only in certain cases.
   In another change, the second half of compound words, when
plural, will always end in an ``s,'' while the first half will lose
its ``s'' if it had one.
   The changes were approved by the Academie Francaise along with
the Councils of the French Language of the French Communities of
Belgium and Quebec.
   But the association of university professors, the Societie des
Agreges, criticized the changes as confusing and unnecessary.
   ``Under the pretext of correcting fancied anomalies, new ones
are being introduced,'' the group said in a statement.
   ``Once again, the error is being made that French is no longer a
universal language because it is too difficult. English has become
a spoken language around the world,'' the group said, ``despite the
fact that its spelling is unchanged and often without logic.''

<HEAD>Puerto Rican Ship Sprayed With Pesticide, 11 Dominican Stowaways
Die</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eleven Dominican stowaways hiding
in the cargo hold of a Puerto Rican ship were killed by a pesticide
that was sprayed on the vessel's cargo of cocoa, officials say.
   The Puerto Rican government on Tuesday sent condolences to the
Dominican Republic over the deaths.
   The 11 Dominicans, all of them men, were discovered Monday
aboard the SS Humacao, owned by the Puerto Rico Maritime Shipping
Co., shortly after the vessel left the southern Dominican port of
Rio Haina.
   Company officials said the cargo of the ship, headed for
Elizabeth, N.J., had been sprayed with the pesticide methyl bromide
in compliance with U.S. Department of Agriculture regulations.
   The San Juan Star, an English-language daily, said five of the
men were found dead in the cargo hold and six others died later at
a hospital from inhaling the poisonous fumes.
   Two stowaways in the cargo hold survived. One was treated at a
Dominican hospital and released, while the other was arrested on
unspecified charges, Dominican authorities said.
   In a letter to Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer, Puerto Rico
Secretary of State Antonio Colorado said the U.S. commonwealth will
work with its Caribbean neighbor to avoid such tragedies in the
future. He did not specify any possible safeguards, however.
   In California, the United Farm Workers union has pushed for a
ban on the pesticide. Some deaths have been blamed on its use in
fumigating homes.
   Dominicans fleeing the poverty of their homeland frequently stow
away on ships bound for the United States and other foreign ports.
   In 1980, 22 Dominican stowaways died of suffocation in the
ballast tank of the Panamanian-registered Regina Express bound for
Miami.

<TEXT>
   At least 100 people, some armed with
guns or baseball bats, converged on a low-income neighborhood
Tuesday night, apparently to protest police handling of a
teen-ager's death, authorities said.
   Shots were fired, and bottles and bricks were thrown, but no
serious injuries were reported in this city of nearly 40,000 people
on Lake Michigan, police said.
   ``We've had shots going off all night,'' said policeman Mike
Elkins. `No shots have been fired by us. We're in full riot gear.''
   About 20 people had been arrested by 10:30 p.m., three hours
after the disturbance by at least 100 people began in a four-block
section of the neighborhood.
   State and county police and state prison officers were
dispatched to help city police control the crowd, Elkins said.
   ``I know there were problems up there last night,'' said LaPorte
County sheriff's Sgt. Mark Ludlow. ``I don't think its fair to call
it a riot, maybe a civil disturbance.''
   There were minor injuries, but it was not immediately known how
many people had been hurt, Ludlow said.
   The disturbance was apparently a protest of the death late
Monday of Chris Crawford, 16, and the wounding of his cousin
Michael Cain, 17.
   Cain, who was shot in the left side, said he and Crawford were
standing near a video arcade when they were approached by an
unknown man who fought with them.
   Cain said his cousin was forced into the street, then hit by a
car and killed. Cain said he was shot as the vehicle passed. He was
taken to Memorial Hospital, where he was treated and released.
   Residents of the neighborhood, which is near a housing project,
said police were less responsive to crimes in their area than in
more affluent neighborhoods.
   Police took more than an hour to reach the scene of Monday
night's violence, said resident Vince Woodard.
   ``We called them on 911 and they didn't come,'' Woodard said.
   Elkins disputed allegations that police were slow to respond
Monday. ``I'm sure in a case like that we were there right away,''
he said.
   The officer said police dispatchers received the call at 11:39
p.m. and arrived at the scene within a minute.
   ``We're only a couple of blocks away,'' Elkins said.

<HEAD>White House to Make First Offer at Budget Talks</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Lead prospects uncertain</NOTE>

   The Bush administration is ready to open
bargaining at slow-moving budget negotiations with Congress by
presenting its own plan for paring next year's deficit,
participants in the talks say.
   One official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
White House would offer a plan cutting the fiscal 1991 budget gap
by close to $50 billion at today's session.
   But Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon, a Republican negotiator, said
he believed the administration would present a plan similar to the
budget President Bush unveiled in January.
   That package proposed reducing red ink by $37 billion in the
fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. It relied largely on raising nearly
$20 billion in taxes and other new revenues and limiting the growth
of benefit programs _ such as Medicare _ by $14 billion.
   Packwood said the administration's package was a response to
Democratic demands that Bush make the first offer at the budget
talks since he is the one who sought the negotiations.
   ``It's just a way of getting things started,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, the House began appropriating spending for next year
on Tuesday, approving $20.8 billion for energy and water projects
despite the lack of agreement over budget cuts and taxes.
   Democratic and GOP negotiators have said $45 billion to $60
billion in savings are needed for the coming fiscal year.
   The official who set the administration's package as approaching
$50 billion said it would include about $20 billion in new revenue,
$17 billion to $18 billion in reductions in benefit programs and
about $4 billion in cuts to other domestic programs.
   In addition, the official said it would include perhaps $3
billion to $6 billion in defense reductions and $1.5 billion in
savings from lower-than-expected interest payments on the national
debt.
   The official said administration bargainers would offer few
details of where the savings would come.
   Today's session was to be the 10th in a series of budget talks
that began May 15. So far, the meetings have dealt with technical
issues.
   Unless action is taken, next year's budget gap could climb above
$200 billion, the administration has said. The Gramm-Rudman deficit
reduction law limits the red ink to $74 billion in fiscal 1991.
   On Tuesday, the Senate voted 96-2 for a measure that would press
lawmakers to remove the huge surpluses in the Social Security trust
fund from the government's deficit calculations.
   It was the first vote by the full Senate on the issue since it
reached prominence early this year.
   The provision was sponsored by Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa. He has
argued that the surpluses _ reaching tens of billions of dollars
annually _ make the budget gap look smaller and are a misuse of
money intended for payments to future retirees.
   The measure's fate is uncertain, however, because it was adopted
as an amendment to a bill boosting federal spending on housing that
the administration has threatened to veto. The House version of the
housing bill is dramatically different and does not mention the
Social Security surpluses.

   Actress Elizabeth Taylor, appearing frail
but impassioned after a prolonged illness, announced a new,
international AIDS outreach effort Tuesday targeting grassroots
organizations in developing countries.
   In her first public appearance since her released from the
hospital last Thursday following a nine-week battle with pneumonia
and complications, Taylor unveiled plans for the International Fund
of the American Foundation for AIDS Research.
   The fund, which Taylor said is off to a modest start, will
expand AmFAR's reach to East and Central Africa, Latin America, the
Caribbean and Southeast Asia.
   ``From tiny villages in Uganda to the teeming slums of Rio, the
International Fund for AIDS will soon sow the seeds of knowledge
and hope, potentially saving thousands of lives in the process,''
said Taylor, a co-founder of AmFAR and the organization's national
and international chairman.
   The fund, which raised $400,000 last December, will sponsor
small workshops designed to help organizations in developing
countries focus their strategies to combat AIDS. Such efforts will
aid the groups when they approach Western donors for support, said
AmFAR President Mervyn Silverman.
   ``I always like the idea of training the trainer, because then
you magnify your effort,'' he said.
   Silverman introduced Taylor, expressing delight she was able to
attend the reception.
   ``We didn't call her, trying to be sensitive to her needs,'' he
told the crowd. ``She called us. Against her doctor's orders. She
said `I must be there. It's important I be there.'''
   Taylor, on the arm of an AmFAR colleague, needed assistance to
step up to the podium platform, and smiled with relief as she
negotiated the 12-inch rise.
   Dressed in a black, tea-length dress, high heels and bold gold
accessories, Taylor appeared radiant. She waved to the cheering
crowd, smiling and clearly enjoying the enthusiastic welcome.
   But Taylor, whose publicist said she was near death at one point
during her illness, spoke slowly and with care, making minimal
departures from a prepared text.

<HEAD>Israelis Live In Tents To Protest Lack of Housing, Blame
Immigrants</HEAD>

   The influx of tens of thousands of Soviet Jews
has produced a housing crunch that is driving up rents, forcing
some longtime residents into the streets.
   These homeless Israelis have pitched tents in front of
Parliament in Jerusalem and across from municipal buildings in
remote suburban towns. Their plight has gripped a country that had
been swept by immigration euphoria.
   Officials warn of an impendent ``social explosion'' directed at
the immigrants unless the housing crisis is resolved soon.
   On Tuesday, the story of Avi Golan, a 40-year old father of four
who set his tent in front of the municipality in Kiryat Bialik, led
Israel Television's popular evening newsreel.
   Kiryat Bialik, near the northern port city of Haifa, took in 450
immigrant families in recent months _ and Golan, an invalid, has to
leave his apartment by this weekend. The rent doubled and he can no
longer afford it.
   ``I tried to find another apartment and they demanded $400 a
month, to be paid a year in advance. I cannot pay in advance, I can
hardly pay every month,'' Golan said.
   ``I don't know what to do, shall I laugh or cry? Really I don't
know. ... I don't know how to raise my kids. Even if I would want
to steal I cannot, they would catch me immediately,'' he said,
hugging two of his children in front of a small, blue-colored tent.
   Golan is not alone.
   The mayor, Dani Zack, says he knows of five or six other
homeless families who have ``apparently lost all hope. ... To my
sorrow, there is almost no solution to this in Kiryat Bialik. It
has to be a government solution.''
   Uri Gordon, head of the Absorption Department at the Jewish
agency that helps resettle immigrants, warned on Tuesday that the
crisis may lead to a ``social explosion between the Israelis and
new immigrants.''
   Rents have skyrocketed throughout Israel with the arrival of the
Soviet wave, which totaled 13,000 in 1989 and more than 43,000 so
far this year. It may exceed 150,000 by the end of 1990.
   Housing Ministry officials say Israel's estimated 20,000 vacant
rental units will be filled in four months, and three months later,
Israel would exhaust its supply of alternate housing such as
holiday flats, army camps and off-season hotel rooms.
   The ministry has called for 60,000 new housing starts this year.
So far, ground has been broken for just 7,000 new units.
   Plans to import prefabricated houses have run into trouble
following objections from local companies.
   In addition, the Union of Construction Workers on Tuesday
decided to launch a struggle against the import of prefabricated
houses. They are backed by the powerful Histadrut, Israel's largest
trade unions federation.
   The arrival of immigrants, who get a government housing subsidy
of some $237 per month, led to a housing shortage in modestly
priced units. The landlords raised the rents for cheapest
apartments to match the subsidy, causing an overall housing price
inflation.
   Many Israelis say they cannot compete with the Soviets, who also
get their subsidy a full year in advance, and are thus forced to
leave their homes. The average monthly after-tax income for an
Israeli family of four is $1,160.
   Protest groups are being organized across the country. Tents
have sprung up that are reminiscent of those set up in the early
70s by the impoverished Sephardis, or Jews of Middle Eastern and
North African origin.
   At the Kings of Israel square in downtown Tel Aviv, one can find
Mordechai Dilmuni, 27, his wife and two children on a sit-in
strike. The story is familiar: they can not afford to rent an
apartment.
   In Rishon Lezion near Tel Aviv, where rents have doubled to up
to $600 for a two-bedroom unit, 28-year-old saleswoman Kochi Nadav
is busy organizing a protest group.
   ``My husband is an engineer. We have two children, age four and
five. We earn 3,000 shekels ($1,500) a month and it is hard to pay
$500 a month in rent,'' Nadav told the daily Yediot Ahronot.
   ``Immigration is good for the state. But I blame the government
and the Jewish Agency for causing price hikes,'' she said.
   Others are less tolerant.
   ``I have nothing against immigration. Let them come. But if the
government can't at the same time help us, former soldiers and
young couples, they better stop immigration,'' Yitzhak Kovni, a
34-year-old unemployed Beersheba resident, told the paper.

   Prince Edward plans to quit serving tea to members
of composer Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group and set up a
production company of his own with five members of the theater
company.
   The 26-year-old prince, the fourth and youngest child of Queen
Elizabeth II, joined Lloyd Webber, whose hit musicals include
``Cats,'' ``Starlight Express'' and ``Aspects of Love,'' as a
production assistant in 1988.
   Production assistant is the most junior job in theaterland. The
prince's backstage work included making tea for co-workers.
   Edward said in a statement Tuesday that he was grateful to Lloyd
Webber and the Really Useful Group for the chance to work in the
theater.
   The prince and his five colleagues refused to discuss their

of Swat was born 95 years ago.
   ``We hope we can count on all of you to go to bat for the Babe.''
   The museum hopes a broadened membership will pay for a

   The museum was built in 1974 around the birthplace of George

``The Boz'' Bosworth is a cross between James Dean and Arnold

   Bosworth stars in ``The Brotherhood,'' a $10 million movie being
shot here in which he continues to play defense _ in this case, as
an FBI agent seeking to stop a political assassination by a
motorcycle gang.
   Bosworth is trying to recover from injuries that have
interrupted his football career.
   Director Bruce Malmuth called Bosworth the star of the 90s.
   ``Boz is great,'' Malmuth said Monday. ``He's just picked up
right where he left off in the sports world and he's zoomed to the
foreground.
   ``I see in him Marlon Brando, James Dean and Gary Cooper, all in
one package. He's got the same appeal of a Stallone or an Arnold
Schwarzenegger.''

   Former President Gerald Ford, an avid

practiced his swing Tuesday for the first time since a knee
operation, but only for a moment.
   ``My surgeon I'm not sure would appreciate this,'' Ford said as
he hit six balls at a driving range. The swings were largely for
the benefit of local news photographers.
   Ford stopped in Juneau during a sightseeing tour of Alaska with
his wife, Betty, and former British Prime Minister Leonard James
Callaghan.
   Callaghan watched from behind as Ford prepared to take his first
swing.
   ``Stand back, everybody,'' Callaghan joked.
   Ford looked out at the driving range. ``You're safer behind than

   ``Roger &amp; Me'' filmmaker Michael Moore once again
stalked the elusive quarry of his movie, this time to give General
Motors Corp. Chairman Roger Smith a copy of the video.
   ``He said he hasn't seen the movie yet and so I figured ... the
video comes out tomorrow, I'll give him the very first copy of the
videotape and he'll get a chance to see it,'' Moore said Tuesday,
after GM security guards refused to let him take an elevator to
Smith's office.
   GM issued a statement saying Smith was out of town and
criticizing Moore's visit as a publicity stunt.
   The film is a tongue-in-cheek documentary about Moore's attempts
to interview Smith about GM plant closings and layoffs in Flint,
Moore's hometown.

discuss the real estate mogul's failure to pay about $31 million
owed to bond holders of the Trump Castle Casino in Atlantic City.
   ``I know it's not going to be enough to help him. I know it
sounds stupid. But he's a good man and we want to support him,''
said Mancini.
   About $10 has been raised so far.
   ``When the can is full, I'm going to send the money. I don't
know what he'll do with it, maybe he'll send it to charity,'' said
Mancini.
   A spokeswoman for Trump had no comment on the fund drive.

   The future of the National Endowment for the
Arts, clouded by political furor over works of art deemed
offensive, will be fought out on the floor of the House.
   A House committee voted Tuesday to kick the issue to the full
House in a move that acknowledged the panel was unable to resolve
deep divisions over whether and how to restructure the federal arts
agency.
   At issue is a bill continuing the NEA for another five years,
without any restrictions on grants and controversial works of art.
The bill was proposed by the Bush administration, but the White
House has been negotiating with Republicans in Congress to come up
with acceptable restrictions on the agency's grant-making authority.
   Its House sponsor, Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., said he opposes
any restrictions but expects the House will add them. Even without
them, he said, the political furor has had a chilling effect on the
NEA's grant process.
   ``Chances are less than 50-50 that the bill will pass the House
as it is now written, with regard to content restrictions,''
Williams said.
   ``Regardless of what happens on the bill, the NEA may never be
the same,'' he said.
   The House Education and Labor Committee voted by voice to
approve the administration's bill, but leaders said the intent was
simply to postpone the debate.
   The full House probably will consider the bill in mid-July, said
Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash. It will also consider several
proposed amendments that would restructure the arts agency or
impose restrictions against support for pornographic, sacrilegious
or other offensive art.
   ``Every reasonable issue ought to be considered by the House,''
Foley said.
   The follows a year of political controversy inflamed by a series
of disclosures of seemingly offensive art that received federal
subsidies.
   In the latest, The Washington Times reported Tuesday that a
$9,000 NEA grant went to a non-profit group in San Francisco that
is sponsoring a homoerotic movie festival.
   Some advocates of restrictions warned that without them,
political support for the NEA would evaporate and Congress could
kill the agency entirely.
   ``There is a responsibility that comes with the expenditure of
federal dollars,'' said Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J. ``The issue is
not censorship but sponsorship.''
   Rep. Fred Grandy, R-Iowa, a former television actor, defended
the NEA and said only a few grants out of thousands turned out bad.
He said adding any restrictions could damage artistic excellence.
   ``I'm far more concerned about mediocrity than I am
pornography,'' Grandy said.
   Rep. Paul Henry, R-Mich., distributed a proposed amendment he
drafted after negotiations with NEA officials and the White House.
   It calls on the agency to ensure it supports art ``which is
sensitive to the nature of public sponsorship, and does not
deliberately denigrate the cultural heritage of the United States,
its religious traditions or racial and ethnic groups.''
   Money could not go to art that violates ``prevailing standards
against obscenity or indecency.''
   Some conservatives have proposed more restrictive language on
pornography. Another group of Republicans is proposing a
restructuring of the NEA that would send more federal money
directly to state arts agencies for distribution.

   Two masked Shining Path rebels have shot
and killed one of the local founders of President-elect Alberto
Fujimori's party in this Andean city, police say.
   Two masked men broke into the house of Elias Melgar Aliaja, 62,
on Tuesday and shot him three times in the head, police said.
   His 14-year-old daughter Jenny was shot twice in the arm and is
in stable condition at a local hospital, they said.
   Melgar was a founder of Fujimori's Change 90 party in Ayacucho,
the birthplace of the Maoist-inspired Shining Path. The party was
formed shortly before April 8 general elections in this country of
22 million people.
   Police said the rebels first asked for Melgar's son Edgar, a
police sergeant. When told that Edgar was not home, they shot the
elder Melgar, they said.
   Melgar was the first Change 90 leader to be assassinated in
Ayacucho, which is 230 miles southeast of Lima.
   Fujimori overwhelmed novelist Mario Vargas Llosa in runoff
presidential elections, June 10.
   More than 18,500 people have died in political violence since
the Shining Path began its armed insurgency 10 years ago.

   Whispers and pleas punctuated by
gunshots retold the horror of ``the darkest moment in Jacksonville
history'' as authorities released the audio tapes of calls
reporting a gunman's rampage.
   ``We're being killed!'' whispered a employee as James Edward
Pough blazed away with a clip-loaded rifle. ``Send the, send the
SWAT team now!''
   The tapes of the 911 calls from the General Motors Acceptance
Corp. office were made public Tuesday.
   Pough killed eight people and wounded five before committing
suicide at the auto loan agency Monday. A day earlier, he shot to
death two people on a street, police said.
   ``What a waste, what a damn waste,'' said Ray David, whose wife,
Janice, died in the office massacre. The couple had two sons, ages
12 and 10.
   David, a lawyer, said he will bury his wife at a cemetery near
their home so he and the boys can bicycle to the gravesite.
   Funeral services were scheduled Thursday for Mrs. David and five
other victims.
   Mayor Tommy Hazouri called the shootings ``the darkest moment in
Jacksonville history.''
   ``It is every city's and every mayor's nightmare,'' he said.
   On the tapes, the callers' voices reflected terror as the gunman
killed four of the victims as they tried to hide under office
furniture.
   ``He's still in there shooting ... shooting everybody! Come
on!'' implored Barry Kimbal, an employee who ran to a neighboring
business to call for help.
   Authorities said the 42-year-old Pough had a violent past, a
failing marriage and an arsenal of weapons because of a quirk in
Florida law.
   He had pleaded guilty to aggravated assault for shooting to
death a man in 1971, but the judge allowed his record to be erased
after five years' probation.
   Under the law, convicted felons may not own firearms. But Pough
``was not technically a convicted felon,'' Assistant State Attorney
John Delaney said.
   Police said Pough had shot and killed a man and a woman Sunday
in a prostitution-related dispute and wounded two teen-agers about
10 minutes later.
   Ballistics tests Tuesday confirmed that the .30-caliber rifle
used in the GMAC killings was used in the Sunday shootings, Sheriff
Jim McMillan said. Pough also had a 9mm machine pistol, which
authorities found in his car.
   For the past year, Pough, who went by the nickname ``Pop,'' had
been doing construction maintenance at the Anheuser-Busch brewery
for the W.W. Gay Construction Co. Separated from his wife, Pough
lived in a rundown duplex.
   GMAC president William Lovejoy and about 15 other GM and GMAC
officials from Detroit and Atlanta arrived in Jacksonville to tend
to the families and get the business operating again in a temporary
office.
   ``The first step for us is the mental health of our employees,''
said Lovejoy, who announced GMAC was contributing $100,000 to start
an assistance fund for the victims' families.
   Lovejoy said he had been with GMAC since 1962 ``and they're like
family.''

<TEXT>
   About 700,000 women, children and
elderly people die in Latin America each year from illnesses caused
by poor health conditions, the World Health Organization's regional
director says.
   The official, Carlyle Guerra de Macedo, told an international
conference on ``Democracy and Health'' on Tuesday that health
conditions in the region had worsened in the 1980s.
   Some 170 million people in Latin American are denied basic
nutrition and health care, and more than 40 million live in
critical poverty, he said.
   Although the region spent $45 billion on medical care, an
estimated 30 percent of the money was wasted or wrongly spent,
Guerra de Macedo said.
   ``This we owe to our incapacity to efficiently use health
services,'' he said. ``Disorganization in medical care centers has
predominated.''
   Government representatives from Colombia, Ecuador, Peru,
Bolivia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico and Cuba were participating
in the three-day conference.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Sets Dairy Support at $10.10, Same as House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dairy farmers would be assured $10.10 per
hundred pounds of milk for the next five years under a section of
the 1990 farm bill approved by the Senate Agriculture Committee.
   It's the same guarantee offered by the House Agriculture
Committee that completed its work on the bill last week.
   But it's less than the $13.10 per hundredweight that dairy
farmers have recently gotten in the open market. ``And that's
good,'' Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., said Tuesday as the Senate
committee wrapped up the dairy section of the legislation that sets
farm policy until 1995.
   High market prices mean dairy producers make more money selling
on the open market than to the government at the guaranteed price,
thereby saving the government money and preventing the accumulation
of surpluses.
   ``This package reflects the midpoint between divergent views on
the dairy program,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the
Agriculture Committee chairman. Most of the provisions are the same
as the House.
   ``We can keep a $10.10 price support floor without exceeding
budget, without requiring an assessment, without requiring price
cuts and without going over production,'' Leahy said.
   He said dairy production has been in line with market demands.
However, under the bill, the agriculture secretary would take steps
to reduce dairy production if government dairy surpluses reached 7
billion pounds.
   But under a provision offered by Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., the
secretary could not use dairy herd slaughtering as a method of
cutting production.
   Baucus said cattlemen lose $25 to $30 a head on beef cattle when
the government buys dairy herds to be slaughtered to reduce the
milk supply.
   ``The cleanest way not to pit one group against another is to
make sure there is no buyout,'' said Baucus.
   The committee also approved a provision that requires the
agriculture secretary to study whether an excess of milkfat is
being produced and to consider changing pricing policies if he
finds that it is a problem.
   Additionally, the bill prohibits any state from offering higher
price supports than the federal government. This provision was
opposed by Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., whose state has such a
program as an edge against higher production costs.
   The measure also authorizes a milk promotion program that would
be financed by processors.

<HEAD>Iran Drives To Boost Food Production As Population Soars</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is spending billions of
dollars to boost food production but it's an uphill battle _ Iran
already can't feed itself and its population is multiplying faster
than India's.
   Thirty years ago Iran was a food exporter. Now it has to spend
$2 billion to $4 billion a year on food imports. That's a third of
its total import bill.
   Food subsidies cost another $1.75 billion a year, straining an
economy that is in poor shape after a decade of mismanagement and
the 1980-88 war with Iraq.
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani's government has allocated $64
billion for agricultural development in its its five-year plan _
one-third invested by the government and the rest by the private
sector.
   ``The question is not whether agriculture can be boosted, but if
it can race to keep up with the population,'' a U.N. official said.
   ``Under the Shah, agricultural production did increase, but so
did the population. But since the revolution there has been a
definite downward trend in agriculture,'' said the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi launched agricultural
reforms before he was toppled in the 1979 Islamic revolution. But
agricultural production was falling behind population growth long
before the monarch's ouster.
   That trend has accelerated since the revolution, despite erratic
attempts to boost food production.
   Iran's population, about 55 million, is swelling at the alarming
rate of 3.9 percent a year, one of the highest in the world. By
comparison, India's population is growing at 2.2 percent, and
China's is increasing at 1.4 percent.
   If Iran's current birth rate continues unchecked, the population
will reach 140 million in 20 years.
   Iranian officials contend that attempts to curb the birth rate
so far have been half-hearted, partly because many Shiite Moslem
clergymen maintain that birth control is proscribed by Islam.
   The mullahs argue that a large population will help Iran become
the leader of the Islamic world and ensure its power and prosperity.
   The Iran Statistics Center reported in March that the country
has 138 million acres of arable land, but just 39 million acres are
being cultivated.
   The Statistics Center noted that wheat, barley and rice
production have increased considerably since 1982 but still lag
behind population growth.
   A lot of farmland fell into disuse during the war, when funds
were channeled to the military, and an estimated 750,000 people a
year move from the countryside to the cities.
   Former Tehran Mayor Morteza Tabatabaie noted recently that the
mass migration to the cities ``has caused irreparable damage to the
agricultural sector.''
   Until the mid-1960s, more than one-third of Iranians worked on
farms and the country was able to feed itself. Today, only
one-eighth of the population works in agriculture _ and the
government is hard pressed to keep people on the farm.
   The population of Tehran, the capital, has mushroomed from 3
million a decade ago to around 10 million. Other cities such as
Isfahan, Shiraz, Tabriz and Mashhad are bursting at the seams as
well.
   Ali, a 36-year-old construction worker in Tehran, said his
family has farmed for generations in northern Gilan province. But
he and his three brothers were forced to leave their land because
they could no longer make a living there.
   ``Shortages forced us to buy seeds, fertilizers and pesticides
at exorbitant prices,'' he said as he shared a lunch of bread and
cheese with two other workers on a Tehran construction site.
   ``But when we demanded higher prices for our products we were
forced to sell at officially designated rates _ at a loss,'' he
complained. ``After living with dignity under my father's roof, I
don't like this life.''
   To lure farmers back to their villages, a massive land reform
program, snarled in the bureacratic morass for years, is being
pushed through Parliament.
   The program aims to force large land-owning government
organizations to break up their holdings.
   Redistribution of land has been a political football since the
revolution, with radicals campaigning for breaking up the vast
estates once owned by the shah's acolytes and conservatives
insisting they should be left alone.
   Officials agree that the birth rate should have been checked
years ago and believe it will be years before it can.
   Just three years ago, the government was offering incentives to
families to produce children for the ``jihad,'' or holy war,
against Iraq, which has a population one-third Iran's.

   President Bush is heading south for the latest
in a series of road trips to boost Republican election efforts, and
to make a pitch for his moon-and-Mars exploration proposal.
   Bush was stumping in Alabama today for Gov. Guy Hunt and in
North Carolina on behalf of Sen. Jesse Helms.
   In Huntsville, Ala., he planned to attend a reception to help
Hunt's re-election bid. Tickets sold for $250, $500 and $1,000.
   While in Huntsville, Bush scheduled a stop at NASA's Marshall
Space Flight Center. Aides said he would use the occasion to urge
Congress to approve his $300 million request for the moon-Mars
program in next year's budget.
   The sum is part of Bush's 1991 budget request for $1.27 billion
in overall space exploration money, including existing programs.
The president announced last July a goal of putting a manned
spacecraft on Mars by 2019 and return manned missions to the moon.
   The plan suffered a setback in Congress last week when the House
Appropriations subcommittee that handles the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration slashed the $300 million request from its
budget draft.
   Bush's one-day Southern swing emphasized election-year
politicking, however. He has spent an increasing amount of time on
the road across the country to help raise money for his party's
Senate and gubernatorial candidates.
   Hunt, serving his first term as Alabama governor, faced minor
opposition in his primary race and is in good shape to face the
winner of the June 26 Democratic runoff race between teachers
association lobbyist Paul Hubbert and state Attorney General Don
Siegelman.
   The Democrats have been slicing one another up. Siegelman has
accused Hubbert of being a special-interest lobbyist whose efforts
hurt the cause of education. Hubbert has charged Siegelman with
fiscal irresponsibility and made veiled references to Siegelman's
admission that he smoked marijuana when he was young.
   From Alabama, Bush heads to Charlotte, N.C., to attend a
fund-raising dinner for conservative stalwart Helms, who faces a
close race against Democrat Harvey Gantt, a former mayor of
Charlotte.
   A recent Charlotte Observer poll found Helms trailing Gantt by a
few percentage points. Encouraging news for Gantt, who is black,
was in the 35 percent support he got from white voters polled.
Helms was backed by 50 percent of the whites, and Democratic
strategists calculate that Gantt needs nearly 40 percent of the
white vote to beat Helms.
   Democrats are hoping to portray Helms as a right-wing extremist
out of touch with his constituents' needs.
   Helms has sent out a fund-raising letter alleging Gantt's
campaign is backed by ``the powerful homosexual political lobby ...
the so-called arts community, the ACLU (American Civil Liberties
Union) and the union bosses.''

<HEAD>Air Force Objects to New Cuts in C-17 Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force says a further proposed cut in
purchase of C-17 transport planes will cause ``irretrievable
damage'' to a program that congressional investigators charge is
over budget and behind schedule.
   The General Accounting Office, citing delays and manufacturing
problems with the C-17 program, urged lawmakers on Tuesday to go
beyond the cuts Defense Secretary Dick Cheney proposed in April.
   Cheney called for slashing the total program from 210 to 120
planes and reducing the budget request for the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1 from six planes to two.
   Based on that cut, the Air Force said Tuesday the cost of the
wide-body C-17 plane, which will replace the current C-141
aircraft, will be $249 million each. The overall program would cost
slightly more than $30 billion.
   Officials of the GAO, an investigative arm of Congress, told a
Senate Armed Services subcommittee that Congress should consider
further reductions in the fiscal 1991 buy and advance purchase for
six planes in fiscal 1992.
   ``This could provide an opportunity to further reduce
concurrency in the program by having the Air Force limit production
commitments until the critical elements of a realistic and
achievable flight test program are completed and any identified
problems resolved,'' said Nancy R. Kingsbury of the GAO.
   She did not say whether GAO was recommending that the Air Force
purchase no C-17s or just one next year.
   The Air Force plant representative assigned to the manufacturer,
McDonnell Douglas Corp., believes the company cannot product the
aircraft to ``either budgeted cost or planned schedule,'' Ms.
Kingsbury told the projection forces subcommittee.
   The Air Force representative concluded that the absence of an
organized system at the manufacturer resulted in late designs,
shortages of parts, late deliveries and unacceptable quality, the
GAO said.
   These problems caused a delay in the first flight of the
aircraft from August 1990 to at least June 1991 and an 11 percent
increase in cost _ from the $37.5 billion to $41.8 billion for the
original plan of 210 planes.
   Air Force Maj. Gen. Stephen Croker said any additional cuts in
the program along the lines of zero production in fiscal 1991 would
cause ``irretrievable damage to the C-17 program.''
   Croker, director of strategic and airlift programs and special
operations forces, said he agreed in part with the GAO's assessment
but questioned the implications that delays on the first plane will
continue throughout the program.
   ``By the ninth aircraft, the program will be as little as two
months late. By the 12th aircraft, the program will be on
schedule,'' said Croker, who added that the manufacturer has made
significant improvements since November.
   But Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., the subcommittee chairman,
questioned whether lawmakers can accept the Air Force's assessment
that ``everything is hunky-dory'' based on recent changes by the
McDonnell Douglas.
   Croker argued that by abandoning the current plan for two planes
in fiscal 1991, the government will lose much of the project's work
force. In addition, he said, parts already under construction would
have to be stored with some likely to disintegrate.
   The GAO proposal ``does not improve employee learning. ... It
does save dollars in fiscal 1991, but those costs will be greater
in 1992,'' the general said.

   About 600,000 military and civilian workers
would be cut from the Pentagon's payroll if the armed forces are
reduced by one-fourth over the next five years, says Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney.
   Even under President Bush's military spending plan _ criticized
on Capitol Hill as far too high _ a smaller military is coming,
Cheney told reporters Tuesday as he compared several options for
military cuts.
   ``Even under the president's program, we're still going to have
to take some steps that probably will result in forcing people out
who would like to stay,'' the secretary said.
   ``We are not going to have as large a military in the future as
we have today, and somehow you've got to shrink the force to get
there.''
   Cheney, attempting to stave off even more severe budget-cutting
proposals from the House and Senate, argued at budget negotiations
that a 25 percent cut in forces could save $8.6 billion over five
years.
   This would result in retiring six active-duty Army divisions,
111 Navy ships and 11 Air Force tactical fighter wings. It would
remove 442,000 men and women from the military's 2.1 million active
duty ranks over the next five years, as well as civilian workers
and members of the National Guard and reserves, he said.
   ``The total, if you add it up ... is almost 600,0000 military
and civilian personnel,'' Cheney said.
   Cheney's proposal would reduce the fiscal 1991 defense budget
Bush submitted in January from $303.3 billion to $302 billion. Over
five years, it would cut $8.6 billion from Bush's proposal.
   The secretary charged that House and Senate plans could end up
closing up to half the U.S. military's installations around the
world and lay off more than 1 million of the Pentagon's 3.1 million
civilian and military work force.
   The House's proposal to cut Pentagon spending to $295.4 billion
would require a 35 percent cut in troop levels, while the Senate
Budget Committee plan for a $293.9 billion level would force a 50
percent slash in force strength, the defense chief said.
   Such cuts would ``do serious damage'' to the nation's military,
Cheney contended, arguing that the result would be ``unbalanced
forces ... units that are undermanned in some key areas.''
   Cheney's figures dissatisfied many congressional Democrats who
attended the budget talks. They contended that the numbers amount
to a savings of only about 10 percent.
   Rep. Les Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee,
argued that Cheney could have made different decisions in the
structure of the military that could have yielded savings of 18
percent to 27 percent.
   ``They have made a set of policy choices to get there that I
think are awfully cautious,'' Aspin, D-Wis., told reporters. ``It's
quite clear from this exercise that we are nowhere near an
agreement on the budget.''
   Cheney, for his part, insisted his numbers were meant as an
illustration, not an offer to budget negotiators.
   But he acknowledged they represent the clearest outline yet made
public of how the Pentagon can shape its forces in response to the
reduced Soviet threat and the lessened chance of a land war in
Europe amid the collapse of the Warsaw Pact.
   The defense budget is seen as a major source of savings as the
negotiators search for $45 billion to $60 billion in new taxes or
spending cuts before fiscal 1991, which starts Oct. 1.

<HEAD>Study: Vietnam Military Dogs Had Almost Twice as Many Testicular
Tumors</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Dogs exposed in Vietnam to the same chemical
sprays as U.S. soldiers developed almost twice as many tumors of
the testicles as military dogs that served only in the United
States, federal investigators report.
   In a study published today in the Journal of the National Cancer
Institute, researchers said the increased number of testicular
cancers among canine veterans of Vietnam may predict the
development of such tumors among American servicemen who served in
the same country.
   ``The dog is a sentinel model for man,'' said Howard M. Hayes, a
National Cancer Institute researcher and coauthor of the report.
``He could be used to foretell the risks for exposure to the same
chemical insults'' encountered by soldiers in Vietnam.
   Hayes and his coauthors examined autopsy records for dogs that
served with American troops in Vietnam from 1968 to 1973. They also
examined autopsy records of dogs that served in Vietnam and later
died elsewhere.
   These records then were compared with those of military dogs
that served only in the United States, Japan, Korea and Thailand.
   Hayes said the dogs serving in Vietnam had 80 percent more
testis tumors of all kinds than did dogs that served only in the
United States. The Vietnam dogs also had 90 percent more seminomas,
a malignant tumor of the testis.
   Dogs serving in Korea, Japan and Thailand had fewer of both
types of tumors than did the U.S. dogs.
   To further verify the risks, Hayes said his group examined
records of 96 male dogs that served in Vietnam and died elsewhere
between 1974 and 1978. These records were compared with those of
dogs that served only in the United States and died during the same
period.
   ``We observed the 96 Vietnam veteran military working dogs to
have significant excess risk for seminoma, which supported the
findings in the earlier period,'' the report said.
   Additionally, the study showed that dogs that served in Vietnam
had 70 percent to 100 percent more testicular dysfunction than did
dogs that served only in the United States.
   Hayes said about 99 percent of the military dogs in the study
were German shepherds, a breed that has a predisposition to
testicular tumors.
   As a result, he said, the dogs ``may be a particularly sensitive
sentinel for exposures leading to increase seminoma risk in man.''
   Dogs in Vietnam, Hayes said, served side-by-side with infantry
troops and were exposed to the same chemical sprays, such as the
herbicide Agent Orange, as were the soldiers.
   Unlike most of the humans, however, the dogs' tours in Vietnam
were not limited to one year.
   Additionally, Hayes said the dogs in Vietnam were treated
several times with tetracycline, an antibiotic used to control a
tick-borne parasitic disease. The tetracycline, the study said,
``may have contributed to the increased risk of testicular
problems.''
   Veterans' groups have contended for years that soldiers who
served in Vietnam have experienced more cancers and other ailments
as a result of their exposure to chemical sprays while in Vietnam.
Agent Orange, an herbicide widely used to defoliate the jungle, has
come under particular attack by veterans' groups as the cause of
cancers and skin ailments.
   The Department of Veterans' Affairs announced earlier this year
that it would provide compensation to Vietnam veterans who have
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or soft-tissue sarcoma, two cancers that
have been associated with chemicals in Agent Orange.
   Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., a special adviser to Veterans
Secretary Edward J. Derwinski, said in an interview that there now
is no compensation provided to Vietnam veterans who develop
testicular cancers. He said the new study may cause tumors of the
testis to be considered as possibly service-related illnesses for
Vietnam veterans.
   ``I've already recommended that testicular cancer be included
and this (the Hayes study) is powerful evidence in support of it,''
he said.
   Zumwalt had a son who served in Vietnam and later died of
cancer, which Zumwalt attributed to Agent Orange.

   A senior House Banking Committee member is
demanding that federal regulators spell out their charges against
President Bush's son, Neil, in the $1 billion collapse of Silverado
Banking, Savings and Loan Association.
   Neil Bush is a former director of the Denver thrift, which
failed in 1988.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision noted that it said in January
it was bringing administrative charges against Bush, and had since
done so. But it would not give details.
   ``No law or regulation prevents the agency from revealing the
charges,'' Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., said Tuesday during the
latest hearing by the House Banking Committee on the failure of
Silverado.
   ``Can any agency of the United States fairly and impartially
investigate the son of the president of the United States?''
Annunzio asked. ``It should make those charges public.''
   An unsigned, undated internal OTS document released by the
committee alleged that Bush ``willfully breached'' his duty as a
director and recommended that he be barred from the industry.
   But William Fulwider, a spokesman for the regulators, said the
document cited by Annunzio was a draft. After it was written, he
said, the agency found there was not sufficient evidence to support
a prohibition and a less serious cease and desist order was
proposed.
   Bush, 34, denied any wrongdoing in voluntary testimony before
the committee on May 23. The panel had been probing whether his
business interests in Colorado conflicted with his role as a
director of Silverado. He called allegations of conflict of
interest ``frivolous.''
   Fulwider said a cease and desist order against Bush had been
proposed by OTS _ which said in January it would do so _ but the
proposal of the order was not made public.
   Such an order would bar Bush from engaging in future actions
that would involve a conflict of interest, Fulwider said.
   ``There is no question that we have brought charges,'' he said.
He declined to say where the proposed order stands in the agency's
procedure. He did not say why his agency had not detailed its
accusations against Bush.
   Five other former officers and directors of Silverado, including
former chairman Michael R. Wise, have consented to orders banning
them from the financial institutions industry.
   The OTS document alleges that Bush failed to disclose his
business relationships to the other directors, including the fact
that one of his business partners, developer Kenneth Good, had
committed to invest more than $3 million in Bush's oil exploration
company.
   At the same time, it said, the directors were being told that
Good probably would not be able to fully repay his loans from
Silverado.
   Bush has said he abstained on all directors' votes involving
Good.

   Even as a free man, Nelson Mandela can't
escape the constraints of security.
   The State Department's Office of Diplomatic Security is mounting
its largest-ever protective operation for the African National
Congress leader who spent 27 years in South Africa behind bars.
   Mandela, 71, arriving in New York today, spent part of his time
in jail on Robbin Island, a notorious prison off the coast of Cape
Town. Treacherous seas make escape virtually impossible.
   Although Mandela is not an official government visitor,
taxpayers will be picking up the tab for the blanket of security,
said Meg Ravnholt, a department spokeswoman. She did not give a
cost estimate.
   The law gives Secretary of States James A. Baker III the right
to approve security for visiting dignitaries who are private
citizens, such as Mandela, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and the
Queen of England.
   ``Just the sheer number of people who are turning out for these
events would qualify him for protection,'' Ravnholt said.
   For about a month, agents _ trained in methods similar to the
Secret Service _ have fanned out across the country to arrange
security for Mandela. He will visit eight cities in 11 days.
   The agents will handle everything ``from the moment he lands
until the moment he leaves,'' Ravnholt said.
   One of the biggest security challenges comes today when
thousands turn out for a ticker-tape parade through lower Manhattan.
   A ``Mandela mobile'' _ a flatbed truck with a bulletproof
glass-enclosed area large enough for Mandela, his wife, Winnie, and
four aides _ was specially designed for the parade through lower
Manhattan.
   Undercover agents were being sent into the crowd, and rooftops
along the way were being guarded by uniformed Emergency Service
Unit sharpshooters, said police sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Mandela will also speak at public rallies in Harlem and Yonkers
during his four-day stay in New York, where authorities have
mounted ``Operation Topaz'' with 12,000 officers. The cost is
expected to be in the $2 million range.
   ``I don't think there is one worst security problem,'' said
police spokesman Capt. Robert Cividanes. ``You look at the areas
that he's going to be in; is there one worst? That's difficult to
say.''
   During his public appearances, police and federal agents will
form a 75-foot security zone around the silver-haired statesman to
keep him at a safe distance.
   After arriving at John F. Kennedy Airport, Mandela was being
escorted by 40-car motorcade from the Queens airport to Brooklyn to
meet with students at Boys and Girls High School.
   Officials said streets and roads would be closed hours before
Mandela's 40-car motorcade travels on them, and the department's
six helicopters would be used to sweep over the route.
   In Washington, Mandela's second stop, police officials refused
to give details about the security operation. But a number of
jurisdictions will be involved, including U.S. Park Police and
police officers who guard the Capitol building where Mandela will
address Congress.
   Christine Dolan, a spokeswoman for the national Mandela
welcoming committee, said the group is leaving all security to the
State Department. She said she did not know whether Mandela's
entourage would include personal bodyguards.

<HEAD>Civil Rights Heroine Joins Strikers in Renewing Call for Greyhound
Boycott</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rosa Parks, whose refusal to move to the back
of a bus started a 381-day bus boycott 35 years ago in Montgomery,
Ala., joined striking Greyhound drivers in their call for a boycott
of the nation's only coast-to-coast bus line.
   Mrs. Parks and Jesse Jackson led some 300 protesters Tuesday on
a three-block march from a Greyhound bus terminal to the capital's
historic Union Station near Capitol Hill.
   Union drivers from Detroit, Boston, Philadelphia and other
cities chanted ``Drop Dead Fred'', carried banners and signs
condemning the company's refusal to resume contract negotiations
and accused Greyhound chairman Fred Currey of trying to bust their
union in the 3{-month strike.
   Mrs. Parks, 77, clasped Jackson's arm during the march before
speaking briefly to protesters and calling for the boycott.
   Jackson said the bus drivers' battle was similar to the civil
rights struggle of the 1960s and reminded him of Martin Luther King
Jr.'s message of years ago.
   ``Better that we walk in dignity than we ride in shame ... Just
as we got social justice together, we must get economic justice
together,'' Jackson told the cheering union drivers gathered at the
station.
   Jackson, carrying a sign that read ``Support Greyhound Drivers,
Street Heat Now,'' occasionally flashed a thumps up sign to
construction workers and pedestrians watching the march.

<HEAD>Harassment Not Grounds for Retaliation, Says State Department</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI has documented at least 25 cases of
harassment and intimidation of Chinese students by their own
government in the United States, but the State Department does not
believe that is grounds for sanctions against Beijing, a department
official says.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., reacting to information given in a
closed-door FBI briefing, called the administration's position
``shocking'' and bluntly told the official: ``I'm not sure we're
living in the same universe.''
   Solarz said the briefing clearly showed a consistent pattern of
intimidation that requires sanctions under a law he wrote nine
years ago.
   The Bush administration has announced its intention to renew
most-favored-nation trading status for China, almost exactly a year
after Beijing's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in
and around Tiananmen Square.
   Kent Wiedemann, director of the State Department's office of
Chinese affairs, said the contacts with students involved
relatively few of the Chinese Embassy and consular officials in the
United States and represented ``a very sporadic pattern.''
   ``They were mostly in 1989, in the summer and fall, and have
dwindled to basically nothing by the beginning of this year,''
Wiedemann told a joint hearing of Solarz's Asia subcommittee and
the human rights subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee.
   The contacts usually involved threats or implied threats of
consequences for students when they return to China, or to their
families, if they continued pro-democracy activities, he said.
   But they were ``sufficiently few in number and sufficiently
indirect as to not be a consistent pattern'' as the law defines it,
he said.

<HEAD>EPA Chief Will Recommend Veto If Jobs Aid Provision Stands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William K. Reilly, administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency, says he will recommend that
President Bush veto clean air legislation if the final bill
contains a jobs protection amendment when it reaches the White
House.
   ``I consider it bad environmental policy, bad social policy and
bad economic policy,'' Reilly said Tuesday in discussing a
provision that would assist workers who lose their jobs because of
the tougher air pollution requirements.
   Both the Senate and House are preparing for a conference
committee to work out differences in largely similar bills to
strengthen federal clean air laws for the first time in 13 years.
   One of the differences involves an amendment in the House bill
that would allow for $250 million to be spent in added unemployment
compensation and retraining for workers if forced out of their jobs
by the new legislation.
   The administration says this could force industry spending well
above the $21 billion or so annually called for by the Senate
version, partly because it would be extremely difficult to tell
whether a job had been lost because of the provisions of the
legislation.
   Reilly said his objections to this jobs proposal, sponsored by
Rep. Bob Wise, D-W.Va., were strong enough that he would recommend
that the president veto the entire bill if that section is not
removed by the conference committee.
   The jobs issues is certain to be one of the main battles in the
conference committee debate. An aid package in the Senate sponsored
by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., lost by only one vote. Byrd's
amendment would have helped only coal miners while the less costly
Wise amendment expands the assistance to workers in all industries.

   The massacre of eight people by a man with a rifle
could undercut the powerful gun lobby at a time when Florida voters
are considering a constitutional amendment imposing a three-day
wait on handgun purchases.
   ``Anytime you have a tragedy, those people with hidden agendas
see any and every emotional opportunity to try to justify their
erroneous position and try to deprive the people of their rights,''
said Marian Hammer, spokeswoman for the National Rifle
Association's Florida branch.
   The debate over the amendment on November's ballot intensified
after James Edward Pough, 42, a day laborer, killed eight people
Monday with a semiautomatic rifle before taking his own life with a
revolver at an auto loan agency. Police said Pough also killed two
people on the street Sunday with the rifle.
   ``How many messages do we send to the Congress? How many to the
state Legislature?'' Jacksonville Mayor Tommy Hazouri said Tuesday.
``If it means seeking changes ... we're going to do that.''
   State Rep. Ron Silver, chairman of the House Criminal Justice
Committee, said the fact the waiting period is being settled by a
referendum rather than a vote in the Legislature shows many
lawmakers still fear the NRA's clout.
   But he added that polls indicate heavy support for the
amendment, and he said passage could give legislators confidence to
pass other gun-control laws.
   ``I think Florida is waking up,'' Silver said.
   California passed an assault weapons bill in 1989 in the
aftermath of the Stockton, Calif., schoolyard spree by a drifter
with an AK-47 assault rifle who killed five children and wounded 30
other people. President Bush approved an import ban on assault
weapons and a Senate bill would extend the ban to domestic
manufacture of four weapons identified as used mainly in drug
violence.
   Florida has tackled gun legislation several times in recent
years.
   A 1987 law removed gun registration from county control in favor
of statewide registration rules. A law taking effect Oct. 1
requires gun sellers to check all applicants through a crime
computer in Tallahassee.
   But lawmakers on a study commission on assault weapons failed to
agree on which weapons should be banned.
   U.S. Rep. Bill Nelson, a Democrat running for governor, has
called banning assault weapons a priority.
   ``It is harder to rent a car in Florida than it is to buy an
AK-47,'' he said during a debate Monday before he knew of the
shooting spree. A Nelson aide needed less than 10 minutes to walk
into a Miami gun shop and come out with an AK-47 and ammunition
last month.
   Gov. Bob Martinez, a Republican seeking re-election, said
Tuesday the law requiring a background check by gun dealers is a
responsible step, ``but at the same time we must maintain the
freedom to own guns which have useful sporting purposes.''
   Pough's .30-caliber semiautomatic rifle would be banned under
New Jersey's month-old law on assault weapons, considered the
nation's toughest, because its clip held more than 15 rounds.
   Nelson wants a seven-day waiting period on handgun purchases.
Democratic front-runner Lawton Chiles also supports a waiting
period.
   Now, gun purchasers are required to have some identification,
such as a driver's license, and fill out a questionnaire on
arrests, mental illness and drug use.
   But there is no way for merchants to confirm the information
other than by investigating on their own.
   It is illegal in Florida for a convicted felon to own a handgun.
But technically, Pough wasn't a convicted felon.
   In 1971, he was charged with manslaughter in the shooting death
of a man; he pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and was sentenced
to five years' probation, court records show. After probation, his
record was wiped clean.
   That made it legal for Pough to own a gun under Florida law.
   ``It's a loophole we need to plug up,'' Jacksonville Sheriff Jim
McMillan said.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Against Purported Heirs in Spindletop Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEAUMONT, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge ruled that thousands of
purported heirs to the Spindletop oilfield fortune have no claim to
the land or the estimated $200 billion generated since the first
gusher blew there in 1901.
   U.S. District Judge Howell Cobb's ruling Tuesday was the latest
in a series of lawsuits brought by would-be heirs against oil
companies that have developed the tract that brought about the
Texas oil boom at the turn of the century.
   Cobb ruled in favor of Amoco Production Inc., Mobil Oil Corp.,
Phillips Petroleum Co., Texaco Inc. and Chevron Inc.
   The lawsuit was filed by four relatives who claimed kinship to
Pelham Humphries and asked for $200 billion. The relatives had
sought to have their case declared a class-action suit on behalf of
numerous other heirs.
   Brown Peregoy, representing 3,000 members of the Humphries Heirs
Trust Association, contended Pelham Humphries received a grant to
the Spindletop property from the Mexican government in 1835 and
left no will.
   The judge ruled, however, that Humphries conveyed the grant to
William Inglish, whose heirs conveyed it to William McFaddin in
1883.
   ``This court desperately desires that the ghost of Pelham
Humphries will no longer haunt the halls of the United States court
system,'' Cobb wrote. ``The Pelham Humphries litigation is over.
... Requiescat in pace (rest in peace).''
   Spindletop, still an active oilfield, caused a boom that moved
the oil industry from the North to the Southwest. Its first six
wells produced more oil in their first year than had been produced
in the United States up to that time.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held in favor of the oil
companies in the 1950s and 1960s.
   The judge will decide later whether to order the plaintiffs to
pay legal fees as a penalty for bringing claims that the oil claims
said had been decided already.

<TEXT>
   A 9-year-old Turkish girl is going home four
years and seven operations after coming to the United States for
treatment of a birth defect that left her eyes covered with skin.
   Dilek Erdogan is still blind, but acrylic implants have made her
look more like other children and given her the confidence she
lacked when her face had just a nose and a mouth.
   ``When she coming here, you can no touch her,'' said Matt
Deletioglu, the Turkish native and former Chicago restaurateur who
has made the girl's treatment a personal crusade. ``She fill with
fear. She shaking. ... You touch her and she scream and scream.
   ``Now,'' he said, ``she look like normal human being, like other
child. She now believing in herself. She wants to walk with you.''
   Dilek, who lives in an apartment a half block from Deletioglu's
house, will rejoin her father in Istanbul with her mother, Guldane,
and her 7-year-old brother, Ozan, by the end of June, Deletioglu
said.
   ``I am very happy,'' Dilek said. ``I am going home. Miss father,
I miss grandfather, grandmother and aunt. I miss my home.''
   Dilek was born with skin covering her eyes, a condition called
cryptophthalmos, or hidden eye. Deletioglu, a native of Antioch,
Turkey, decided to help Dilek after he saw her picture in a
newspaper from his homeland.
   Two doctors at the University of Illinois Hospital, Allen
Putterman and Joel Sugar, agreed to donate their services, leaving
only hospital bills to be paid by Deletioglu or through donations.
   Putterman surgically built eye sockets and an eyelid for the
girl two years ago, but doctors were unable to restore her sight.
   The left eye was badly scarred and was replaced with an
artificial one. An operation to implant a cornea in her right eye
failed because she had no iris or pupil.
   Putterman said Tuesday that doctors had considered another
procedure that would have allowed her to see shapes and forms.
Called kerotoprosthesis, it would involve implanting something like
a little telescope into the eye.
   But he said the implant could have become infected, and that
could threaten the whole eye.
   ``Hopefully, in the future, somebody will develop something that
will allow her to see without the risk of the eye being infected
and completely lost,'' he said.
   The surgeon also said it was promising that Dilek's eye sockets
are still intact. ``That, I think, allowed her to get into the
social world ... go to school ... be accepted by her peers,'' he
said. ``That was a very big step for her.''
   Dilek is more like a normal, happy child than before the
operations, said Deletioglu. She attends special education classes
in a city school. She laughs and plays.
   Deletioglu said he was unsure of the cost of Dilek's treatments,
but he said more than $20,000 came from Armitage Baptist Church.
   On Sunday, Dilek visited the church to thank God and the 300
members present for their love and moral support.
   ``Everyone was crying over there,'' said Deletioglu.
   Dilek's family hopes to return in 10 years if doctors have
developed a procedure to implant real eyes by then.
   Meanwhile, Deletioglu said, he hopes to stay in touch with the
girl who is now like a daughter to him.
   ``At least now she has confidence with herself,'' he said. `At
least she have good start now.''

   Homeowners, a barkeep and bikers who lost
vintage Harley-Davidsons were among flood victims who reported to a
disaster relief center after a flash flood that killed at least 21
people.
   Thirteen people were still listed as missing.
   The Army Corps of Engineers today planned to begin removing
about 15 acres of debris backed up on the Ohio River at the
Hannibal Dam and Locks, about 25 miles south of here.
   Workers for various agencies handed out about 100 aid
applications Tuesday.
   Bruce Connor, 33, said he and two other members of the Sentinels
Motorcycle Club came to apply for money to replace
Harley-Davidsons. The club is in the backwoods along Pipe Creek,
which was deluged by rain Thursday.
   ``Some of those bikes were collectors' items, probably worth a
lot of money. We had Harleys from the 1920s and 30s, bikes my
father and his father had, and tools they used to work on them,''
Connor said.
   Gene Neiditch of the Federal Emergency Management Agency said
the Sentinels may qualify for relief if the motorcycles were for
transportation and work, but not if they were luxuries.
   Ken Gibbons, 41, who crawled into his attic to escape a 25-foot
wall of water, said that his losses totaled $300,000 but that he
could recover only about $10,400 in government grants.
   ``They send money freely overseas to other countries, but don't
want to do anything to help people here,'' Gibbons said. He vowed
never to work again so he wouldn't have to pay income taxes.
   His greatest loss, he said was his bar, the 3 K's Night Club.
``I've had that 15 years,'' he said, ``and everybody in this town
came down there for entertainment.''
   Neiditch said the first relief checks could be received in two
weeks. The agency estimated 700 homes were damaged or destroyed.

   Republican Pierre Rinfret, the political
neophyte challenging the re-election bid of Gov. Mario Cuomo, is
starting out on the defensive amid reports he exaggerated his
academic and political credentials.
   Rinfret, who heads an international economic consulting firm,
has presented himself as holding a doctorate and having turned down
offers to join President Nixon's Cabinet.
   But The New York Times on Tuesday reported that Rinfret never
earned a doctorate, and that some former Nixon administration
officials were unaware of any offers of Cabinet posts.
   Rinfret, 66, was nominated at the state GOP convention last
month. The millionaire economist was chosen after an 11-month
effort by the GOP to persuade better-known Republicans to run
against the popular two-term Democrat.
   Even Rinfret's political affiliation has been a source of
controversy.
   It was not until last week that he registered as a Republican.
While Rinfret had earlier told reporters and GOP leaders that he
was a Republican and had voted in Republican primaries, election
board records dating to 1976 showed Rinfret wasn't enrolled in any
party. He said he had made a mistake.
   On Tuesday, the Times reported Rinfret never earned a doctorate
even though he has used the title ``Dr. Rinfret'' on resumes, legal
documents and biographies.
   A biography Rinfret distributed at the GOP convention last month
cited him 13 times as ``Dr. Rinfret.'' However, a biography
distributed last week by Rinfret had replaced all ``Dr. Rinfret''
references with ``Mr. Rinfret.''
   Rinfret said he had been told by a French diplomatic official
that the diploma he received from the University of Dijon in France
in 1946 could be called a doctorate. University officials said it
was the equivalent of an American master's degree.
   Rinfret said that even if the Dijon diploma isn't a doctorate,
he can claim the title because he received an honorary doctor of
laws degree from Pepperdine University in 1973.
   In response to the newspaper report that several top Nixon aides
were unaware Rinfret had been seriously considered for any Cabinet
positions, the candidate Tuesday produced a statement from Nixon in
his defense.
   ``As president I had hoped that he would join my administration
as a member of the Council of Economic Advisers or later as a
member of my Cabinet,'' said the statement.
   The candidate canceled his only scheduled public appearance
Tuesday, a fund-raising dinner in Albany to benefit state Assembly
Republicans.
   Aides to Cuomo wouldn't comment on the flap.
   Other New York gubernatorial candidates did.
   ``It matters. It matters a great deal,'' said Conservative Party
candidate Herbert London. ``It's a question of character and a
question of what this person is actually bringing to the table in
the way of credentials.''
   ``He has what we euphemistically called in the Marine Corps
`hoof-in-mouth disease,''' said Louis Wein, the Right-to-Life Party
candidate.
   Wein is circulating petitions in an attempt to challenge Rinfret
in a Sept. 11 primary for the GOP nomination.
   Assemblyman John Faso, an Republican named Rinfret's campaign
manager Monday, said he wasn't certain if the newspaper report
would have any lasting impact.
   ``It doesn't help it, but it's important to get these things out
of the way in June rather than in September,'' Faso said.

<HEAD>Salvadoran Rebels Insist on Military Cuts to Bring Peace</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OAXTEPEC, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opening a new round of peace talks,
Salvadoran rebel leaders are sticking to their longstanding demands
that the rightist government slash its military and rid the ranks
of alleged death squad leaders.
   Speaking to reporters before Tuesday's opening session,
guerrilla commander Shafik Handal called the issue of a reduced
Salvadoran military ``the Gordian knot that needs cutting to bring
peace to our country.''
   Col. Mauricio Vargas, spokesman for the government of President
Alfredo Cristiani, declined comment on Handal's statement.
   The U.N.-mediated discussions, expected to last eight days, are
aimed at moving closer to a goal negotiators proposed in Caracas,
Venezuela last month _ a September cease-fire in El Salvador's
10-year-old civil war.
   Rights groups estimate 73,000 people have been killed since the
war began in October 1979, most of them suspected leftists slain by
death squads.
   Since then, the United States has been supporting a succession
of governments with military and economic aid now averaging more
than $1 million a day. El Salvador has about 55,000 military
personnel, dominated by right-wing officers.
   Alvaro de Soto, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar's
personal representative, who is mediating the talks between the
leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front and the
government in this mountain resort outside Mexico City, said the
discussion has been cordial and respectful.
   David Escobar, legal adviser for the government delegation, said
the first session ``is on a good track, where both side are
presenting their viewpoints with optimism.''
   Rebel Commander Roberto Canas described them as ``just normal.''
   Canas said the guerrilla front also demanded punishment for
those responsible for a series of political slayings by rightist
death squads during the country's decade-old civil war.
   Escobar said six issues were on the list _ armed forces, human
rights, economic problems and reforms in judicial, electoral
systems and in the constititution.
   ``I don't think that we're going to arrive at spectacular
agreements like a cease-fire or incorporation of the guerrillas
into civilian life'' at the Mexico meeting, Escobar said. ``Anyway
we have until Sept. 15 to live up to the Caracas accords.''
   During five days of talks last month in Venezuela, the two sides
agreed on an agenda and a tentative calendar to negotiate an end to
the war, committing themselves to try for a cease-fire by
mid-September.
   Talks with the Cristiani government in June and September 1989
broke off when the guerrillas mounted attacks on San Salvador in
November in which more than 2,000 people were killed.
   Three rounds of peace talks under the Christian Democratic
administration of the late President Jose Napoleon Duarte in 1984
and 1987 ended in deadlock.

<TEXT>
   Folklore holds that this village along
the Ohio River got its name from railroad conductors who suggested
that passengers get off on the shady side of the tracks.
   A pamphlet found in a library says James Leasure planted
evergreens along the road to his farm and hung a sign reading
``Shady Side'' at his gate opposite the railroad platform in the
1870s.
   ``Eventually it became known as the Shadyside stop,'' said
Belmont County coroner's investigator Chuck Vogt. ``It's just a
nice, middle-class America town.''
   But it's also a town that has seen hard times, even before last
week's flash flooding killed at least 21 people and left 13 missing.
   The southeastern Ohio county lies in the coal and steel country
of the Appalachian foothills. Its heavily wooded hills are dotted
with bedroom and retirement communities for the mills and mines of
Wheeling, W.Va., and western Pennsylvania.
   ``Because of the closing of many, many coal mines and the
reduction and closing of some steel mills, the population has been
declining,'' said Martins Ferry Library Director John W.P. Storck.
``The average age in Belmont County is increasing, too.''
   Figures from the 1980 census show Belmont County's population
grew from 80,917 in 1970 to 82,569 in 1980, but the figures are
still below the 1940 peak of 95,614.
   Figures from the 1990 census are not yet available, but are
expected to reflect a further decline, Storck said.
   Shadyside, classified as a city until the 1980 census, had to be
reincorporated as a village because its population count of 4,300
was 700 below the Ohio cutoff for a city.
   Figures in a 1989 report compiled by Washington-based Woods &amp;
Poole Economics Inc. show the average age of the county's residents
is about 32.7 years, compared with the statewide average of 29.9.
The report predicts the average will increase to 37.4 in 1995 and
41.1 by 2010.
   But there has been little change in the character of Shadyside
residents, said Sandy Wallace, who grew up in Bellaire and reports
on the area for the Martins Ferry Times-Leader.
   Everybody knows everybody else, ``and that's why this flood has
become such a devastating emotional issue,'' she said.
   ``There's this quality of giving and openness, a very close-knit
and neighborly situation,'' she said. ``And that's something that
I've noticed has really come to the fore in the past few days.''
   Donations of food, clothing, technical assistance and labor for
the backbreaking process of debris removal came from all over
southeastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia.
   So much clothing was donated that authorities ran out of storage
space.

   A tanker truck loaded with alcohol ran
the lights at a rail crossing one block from its destination and
was rammed by a freight train, exploding in a fireball that killed
three crewmen, authorities said.
   ``I would say they suffocated from the fire but I can't prove
that,'' said fire Capt. Lester Blaylock.
   The truck driver, John Gilboy, 25, of Englishtown, N.J., was
cited for failing to stop at a railroad crossing and illegal
possession of alcohol for an unopened can of beer found in the
truck cab Tuesday, authorities said.
   Gilbey, who suffered minor injuries, was freed on $280 bail.
   Paul DeFalco, president of the tanker truck's owner, Linden Bulk
Transport of Linden, N.J., said Gilboy agreed to a blood-alcohol
test.
   The tanker was carrying ethylhexanol, used for making a solvent,
to the Haywood Co. in this town of 10,000 residents 40 miles from
Memphis. The collision with the 89-car CSX Corp. train occurred in
an industrial section.
   Authorities said the train was within the 30 mph speed limit,
and the warning lights apparently were working.
   ``Apparently he didn't see the signal or something,'' said Ed
Ellington of the Haywood County Emergency Management Agency.
   Killed were John Ed Sharp Jr., 48, of Jackson; Willie Thomas
Carter, 57, of Eva, and Chesley Serl Winters, 44, of Paris.
   Eleven firefighters overcome by heat and fumes were treated at a
hospital and released.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Inventory of Stolen German Art Treasure</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ordered an inventory of
medieval artwork believed stolen by a U.S. soldier from a German
mineshaft during World War II and stashed in a small-town bank
vault in Texas.
   U.S. District Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater ordered Tuesday that the
time and place of the inspection be kept secret to protect the
inspectors and the objects, which have been valued in the millions
by German art experts.
   The Lutheran cathedral in Quedlinburg, East Germany, is suing to
recover the artwork from the First National Bank in Whitewright and
the family of Joe T. Meador.
   Meador, a former Army lieutenant, is believed to have stolen the
objects and stashed them in his hometown of Whitewright, about 60
miles north of Dallas.
   The treasure disappeared in 1945 from a mine shaft in
Quedlinburg, a castle town occupied by U.S. troops at the end of
World War II. Meador died of cancer in 1980, and his family put the
objects in the bank for safekeeping, said branch President John
Farley.
   Farley said he never knew the art had been stolen and had been
trying to mediate the dispute over its ownership. ``We wanted to do
what was right,'' he said.
   Government officials have said it is unclear whether charges can
be brought in the case because of statutes of limitations on thefts
of art.
   The judge on Tuesday dictated the circumstances of the inventory
down to the type of flash to be used in photographing the items,
the placement of the cameras and a requirement that all inspectors
wear cotton gloves.
   The lawsuit alleges at least 14 objects were taken by Meador,
including a silver, ivory and gold reliquary from the 9th or 10th
century, a 10th century Byzantine rock-crystal flask and an ivory
comb inlaid with precious stones.
   Also listed as stolen are two manuscripts, one from about 1300
and the other from 1515, bound in precious metals and encrusted
with gems.
   Meador's brother and sister, Jack Meador of Whitewright and Jane
Meador Cook of Mesquite, have refused to comment.
   Farley said the bank will ask to be dropped from the lawsuit
because First National never claimed to own the relics.

   A 2,500-year-old Greek vase and two ancient
silver coins brought record prices at a court-ordered auction of
antiquities owned by the one-time billionaire Hunt brothers.
   The 18-inch-tall vase from about 510 B.C. sold for $1.76 million
Tuesday at Sotheby's. The old record for an ancient vase sold at
auction was $493,000.
   The gleaming black vase depicts the death of Kyknos in battle
with Herakles, or Hercules. It was reconstructed from a vase
fragment signed by Euphronius, one of the most important Greek
artists of the period, said Sotheby's David Redden, an expert in
the field.
   Nelson Bunker Hunt and brother William Herbert Hunt, heirs to an
oil fortune, lost more than $1.5 billion in an alleged attempt to
corner the silver market a decade ago and sought bankruptcy
reorganization.
   The Dallas businessmen were ordered to sell off their
possessions to pay their creditors, the biggest of which is the
Internal Revenue Service.
   R. Carter Pate, the trustee in charge of liquidating Nelson
Bunker Hunt's estate, expected all the sales, which will be held
through 1991, to raise between $20 million and $25 million.
   But Tuesday's sale of 164 vases, coins and bronze figures
generated $20 million alone, Sotheby's said.
   The record-setting Greek coins were the Decadrachm of
Agrigentum, from about 465 B.C., which sold for $572,000, and an
Athenian decadrachm, circa 465 B.C., which sold for $528,000.
   The Athenian coin, with the goddess Athena on one side and an
owl on the other, had set the previous record for a coin sold at
auction in 1974 when it went for $272,000.
   The Agrigentum coin is one of eight known specimens of its kind,
Sotheby's said. It shows an eagle and four horses being driven by
sun god Helios on one side and two eagles perched over a dead hare
on the other.
   A coin struck by Brutus to commemorate the assassination of
Julius Caesar in 44 B.C. sold for $99,000. One side notes the day
of the murder, the Ides of March, and the method, daggers. The
other side bears a picture of Brutus.
   Dealers from Europe, Japan and the United States were among
those bidding. Many items sold for two and three times their
presale estimates.
   On July 21, 600 items owned by Bunker Hunt _ including bronze
sculptures of bulls, Indians and horses and porcelain birds and
waterfowl _ will be auctioned in Texas. An auction of sports
paintings formerly owned by Bunker Hunt also is planned.

<HEAD>Government Scraps Segregation Law; Rightist Calls For Open War</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's white Parliament
has repealed a segregation law that for decades allowed public and
private facilities to exclude blacks.
   The repeal of the Separate Amenities Act on Tuesday was the
latest in a series of reforms by de President F.W. de Klerk since
he came to power last year. The changes have angered conservative
whites who oppose the idea of sharing power with the black majority.
   The Separate Amenities Act, passed in 1953, gave government and
privately owned enterprises the right to reserve facilities such as
parks, hotels, swimming pools, libraries, toilets and recreation
centers for whites only.
   Not affect by the act are neighborhoods and schools, the main
institutions still segregated under the government's apartheid laws.
   Tony Leon, an anti-apartheid member of Parliament who voted to
scrap the measure, said 37 years of segregated facilities had given
the country a ``disfigured human landscape.''
   Jan Hoon of the pro-apartheid Conservative Party opposed repeal
of the measure, saying it was another step down the road to black
rule.
   In major cities such as Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban,
public facilities have been integrated for years. But in hundreds
of smaller towns and villages, there have been no public facilities
for blacks or vastly inferior segregated ones.
   At Parliament in Cape Town, de Klerk's ruling National Party and
the anti-apartheid Democratic Party outvoted the Conservative Party
to scrap the law, 105-38. The mixed-race and Indian chambers of
Parliament voted unanimously for repeal. The country's 28 million
blacks have no voice in national affairs.
   De Klerk in February promised to scrap the Separate Amenities
Act. He says he wants to end racial discrimination and negotiate a
new constitution that will bring blacks into the national
government.
   However, he opposes a one-man, one-vote, majority-rule system,
saying it would replace white domination with black domination. The
president envisions a mechanism that would give whites veto power
on major policy decisions.
   De Klerk has promised that next year the government will amend
the Group Areas Act that segregates neighborhoods by race. He
opposes full repeal of the measure and appears to favor a system
that would allow some neighborhoods to be integrated and others to
remain segregated.
   The government has given no indication it plans to integrate
public schools, although many private schools are multiracial.
   Since taking office in September, de Klerk has legalized dozens
of black opposition groups, permitted peaceful protests, freed
scores of political prisoners, suspended the death penalty, and
ended segregation on beaches and in hospitals.
   The latest change came a day before black nationalist leader
Nelson Mandela was to arrive in the United States. He is in the
midst of a foreign tour, urging countries to continue sanctions
against South Africa's government until it ends apartheid.
   Mandela, deputy president of the African National Congress, was
freed from prison in February after serving 27 years for plotting
against the South African government.
   De Klerk has argued that the reforms show that his country is
changing and he has urged foreign countries to lift economic
sanctions.

   Dmitri Baltermants, a famed Soviet photographer
best known for his pictures of World War II battlefields, has died

everything he could to help us see and understand life better.''
   Among the best-known of Baltermants' work was a 1942 photo of
Soviet women grieving over the frozen bodies of soldiers in the
Crimea. It was titled ``Searching for Loved Ones at Kerch.''
   Baltermants continued working virtually up until his death,

<HEAD>Some Progress Reported As Trump Loan Talks Continue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald Trump's major bank leaders have
tentatively agreed to give him a little breathing room, The New
York Times reported today.
   The four lead banks agreed to lend him $65 million and defer
interest and principal payments on about $850 million of the $3
billion in debt the developer ran up in building his real estate
and gambling empire, the newspaper said.
   But the package would be secured by nearly every asset in
Trump's empire, and the agreement hinges on getting other lenders,
particularly Japanese banks, to agree, the newspaper said, citing
unidentified people involved in the talks.
   Trump has about $1 billion in junk bond debt in addition to
roughly $2 billion in bank debt and is said to be in a cash crunch.
His lenders are worried his properties aren't generating enough
cash to handle his debts.
   Trump missed a roughly $43 million payment due last Friday on
junk bonds used to finance the purchase of Trump Castle, one of his
three Atlantic City hotel-casinos, but he has a grace period for
making the payment.
   The banks and Trump's spokesman, Dan Klores, refused to comment
on the talks. The four banks are Citicorp, Manufacturers Hanover
Corp., Chase Manhattan Corp. and Bankers Trust Co.
   The developer also has not yet made a $30 million debt payment
due Manufacturers Hanover Corp.
   The restructuring plan is aimed at helping Trump to keep making
debt payments while waiting for his assets to rise in value so some
could be sold.
   His assets, which include hotels and office and apartment
buildings in New York, have fallen in value because of the slumping
real estate and casino markets. His Trump Shuttle also has posted
disappointing results.

<HEAD>Accord On Open Borders Between Five European Countries</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SCHENGEN, Luxembourg (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France, West Germany, Belgium, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg have agreed to allow people to move
freely across their shared borders in a pact hailed as a model for
the entire 12-nation European Community.
   The five countries signed the agreement Tuesday, and it will
include East Germany after the expected reunification if the two
Germanys. The required ratification by the nations' parliaments may
take two years.
   The long-awaited accord was in the works sinced 1985. Its
signatories agreed to end border checks, have a common visa and
asylum policy and share data on illegal aliens, suspected criminals
and missing persons.
   ``Our agreement is a model ... for the free movement of people
in the (European) Community,'' Dutch Deputy Foreign Minister Piet
Dankert told reporters on behalf of the signatory nations.
   Yet he doubted all 12 of the European Community's nations were
ready to remove their borders after Dec. 31, 1992, when the
countries are to merge their economies to create a single
barrier-free market.
   The 12 EC states have not even reached agreement on how to
handle asylum-seekers.
   Negotiations are to open this week with Italy, which wants to
join the Schengen accord, named for this village on the
Luxembourg-German-French border where it was signed.
   Under the accord, the five signatory nations will:
   _Remove internal border checks for their citizens and legal
residents and let legally admitted people from outside the five
nations move within their boundaries for three months without a
visa.
   _Apply a joint policy to prevent ``asylum shopping,'' whereby
refugees go from one nation to the next to get residency visas.
   _Intensify cooperation between police and justice officials and
allow police to chase suspected criminals across national
boundaries.
   _Simplify extradition procedures and harmonize gun-control
legislation.
   _Share information on people wanted or missing or who are
considered dangerous. Such a databank will also keep tabs on such
items as stolen cars and passports.
   The Schengen agreement primarily benefits passenger traffic. On
road transport, the five EC nations pledged to keep border checks
``at the lowest possible level'' by removing some of the red tape
that hampers road transporters.
   The agreement allows any state to revert to full-fledged border
checks on national security grounds.
   Reflecting the sensitive nature of dropping border controls,
Tuesday's signing ceremony was three years behind schedule.
   In past negotiations, the issue has encountered several hurdles,
ranging from Luxembourg's refusal to water down its bank secrecy
laws to concerns elsewhere that the computer databank may lead to
an invasion of privacy.

   The Kansas City Evening News, a modest
new tabloid in a city that recently lost its afternoon daily, is
calling it quits today after 27 issues.
   Publisher Stephen F. Rose on Tuesday blamed the paper's demise
on city officials who refused to allow teen-agers to hawk the
tabloid on the street.
   ``We were forced to make a very painful decision, to go down in
history as perhaps the only paper to close while making money,''
Rose said. ``We simply wouldn't be making any money if we had to
convert to home delivery.''
   Rose launched The Evening News on May 14, two months after the
afternoon Kansas City Star merged with the morning Kansas City
Times to form the morning-only Star. Rose put startup costs at
$250,000.
   Analysts had predicted The Evening News would have a difficult
time in a city dominated by Star, which has a daily circulation of
about 300,000.
   The Evening News, with 10 full-time employees, averaged 32 pages
a day and used mostly wire service reports on national and
international news. Rose, president of a family-owned group of 18
suburban weekly papers, was the sole investor.
   Tuesday's announcement came only a week after Rose had said the
50-cent tabloid _ sold on the street and at newsracks and in stores
_ was selling 15,000 copies a day and making several thousand
dollars a week in profit.
   But Rose said that some suburbs had ordinances against street
sales, and that Kansas City also cracked down on the street
hawkers, ticketing one and forcing others off medians. City
officials cited safety and traffic concerns.
   ``I think the safety issue was overblown, although I understand
the concerns of city officials,'' Rose said. ``The fact is, hawkers
are utilized all over the country, successfully and safely.''
   The Evening News was the second unsuccessful attempt to start a
metropolitan newspaper in the Kansas-Missouri area in recent
months. Ralph Ingersoll II launched the St. Louis Sun in September
but closed it in April, citing low circulation.

   The United States, making its first
appearance in the World Cup soccer championships in 40 years, was
eliminated in the first round without winning a game.
   The U.S. team fell 2-1 to Austria on Tuesday, finishing with an
0-3 record and getting outscored 8-2 overall.
   ``Eventually, we'll be able to knock off a top team and surprise
some people,'' said U.S. player Eric Wynalda. ``That might be 1994
or 1998. But I thought we could do it now.''
   Argentina, the defending champion, is favored to win the cup,
the highest prize in the world's most popular sport.
   The championships begin with 24 teams divided into six groups.
The four teams in each group play each other, with the best two
advancing to the next round.
   The United States, which hasn't advanced past the first round
since 1930 and hadn't taken part in the championships since 1950,
was expected to lose all three games, and did; it fell 5-1 to
Czechoslovakia in the opener and then lost 1-0 to the Italians.
   In 1994, the United States will host the World Cup finals, which
are held every four years, alternating between Europe and the
Americas.
   After Tuesday's game, the U.S. team took half a lap around the
field, thanking the American fans with waves and shouts.
   ``If anything, we found out we're closer than we thought,''
midfielder Tab Ramos said. ``We always knew we were far behind. If
anything, we ended by a high note.''

<HEAD>Scientists Break Down `World's Most Wanted Number'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers have broken down a 155-digit
number into three numbers that cannot be further divided, raising
concerns about the safety of computer programs used by banks and
the military.
   Scientists at Bell Communications Research in Morris Township
said Tuesday they came up with three factors of the number, dubbed
``the world's most wanted number,'' after using about 1,000
computers during a five-week period. One of the factors is seven
digits, one 49 and the third is a 99-digit number.
   Arjen Lenstra, a member of Bellcore's technical staff, worked
with Mark Manasse, of Digital Equipment Corp. of Palo Alto, Calif.,
to break the number down. Lenstra says the effort shows that
tampering with certain computer messages encoded in 150-digit
numbers is possible.
   ``The fact that we are able to figure this number (shows) that
others are less safe than previously thought,'' Lenstra said.
   But the significance of the development for major institutions _
such as banks and the military _ that use large numbers to encode
computer messages was downplayed by David Kahn, author of ``The
Codebreakers.''
   Kahn said that in most code systems both the sender and receiver
of information have the same system and key.
   In the widely used cryptographic system the research applies to,
the encoding and decoding keys differ.
   The keys are related mathematically through a number that is
usually the product of two large prime numbers. The product is in
the open, but the primes are kept secret and the system depends for
its security on the difficulty of factoring large numbers,
according to Kahn.
   The lab's breaking down of the 155-digit number indicates that
the second system can be factored down more quickly than previously
believed, Kahn said. But for practical purposes, the system is
mostly used to enable one computer to recognize another.
   An official with the American Bankers Association, which
represents about 95 percent of U.S. commercial banks, said he was
not alarmed by the Bellcore breakthrough.
   Most banks use the Data Inscription Standard and ``I know of no
one who has ever broken that code,'' said Al Belisle, chairman of
the association's systems security committee.

   A thousand demonstrators drawn by today's
opening of the Sixth International Conference on AIDS marched on
immigration offices to protest a U.S. policy barring AIDS-infected
people from entering the country.
   Eight arrests were made during the protest Tuesday, in which
demonstrators unleashed a smoke bomb at the Immigration and
Naturalization Service offices.
   ``The policy has people riled up and angry,'' said Jorge
Cortinas, a member the group that organized the protest, the AIDS
Coalition to Unleash Power. The marchers shouted the group's
slogan, ``Act up, figIDS.''
   The march, which snaked through the Financial District like a
rowdy gay pride parade, preceded a five-day meeting that has
attracted 10,000 researht back, fight Achers, health-care providers and
officials
from around the world.
   The police-escorted marchers danced and kissed in same-sex
pairings as they proceeded along Market Street, the city's main
thoroughfare.
   At barriers in front of the INS building, police stood, batons
in hand. The officers donned riot helmets when a flag was burned.
   Several protesters who tried to break through police lines were
tackled, handcuffed and carted off. Eight were charged with
misdlthough some members are attending the
conference, the group plans protests throughout the meeting to call
attention to what member Arawn Eibhlyn calls the ``complete lack of
government response'' to the epidemic.
   Also Tuesday, Elizabeth Taylor made her first public appearance
since a nine-week battle with pneumonia to announce a new,
international AIDS outreach effort by the American Foundation for
AIDS Research.
   AmFAR plans to sponsor workshops to train AIDS fighters in East
and Central Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean and Southeast Asia.

   Scores of residents of a poor
neighborhood fired shots and hurled bottles and bricks at cars,
venting anger over what they said was footdragging by police in
responding to a teen-ager's hit-and-run death.
   Twelve people were arrested and six residents suffered minor
injuries during the two-hour melee Tuesday night, authorities said.
   Several shots were fired from the crowd of at least 100 people
that gathered at the intersection where 16-year-old Chris Crawford
was struck and killed by a car Monday night, said.
   The shots apparently were fired into the air, and no one was
hit, police said. Police said they fired no shots.
   State and county police and prison officers were sent to help
city police control the crowd. Police used dogs to help clear the
streets.
   The disturbance stemmed from the death of Crawford and the
wounding of his cousin Michael Cain, 17.
   Crawford's death resulted from a confrontation among some 30
youths, police said. Cain said he and Crawford were assaulted as
they stood near a video arcade. Cain said his cousin was forced
into the street, then hit by a car.
   Cain said he was shot in the side as the vehicle passed. He was
treated at a hospital and released.
   Crawford's death brought accusations from some residents who say
police respond faster to calls from more affluent neighborhoods.
   Vince Wodard, a neighborhood resident, said police took more
than an hour to reach the scene. ``We called them on 911, and they
didn't come,'' he said.
   Mayor Robert Behler said the first squad car arrived within 30
seconds after police dispatchers received a call for help.
   About two hours before the incident, Anthony T. Gooden, 20, of
Gary, was arrested on murder charges in Crawford's death, Drake
said.

<TEXT>
   Tamil rebels launched counter-attacks
today from their stronghold in northern Sri Lanka, fighting bitter
hand-to-hand battles with government troops in the third day of a
full-fledged civil war.
   Military officials said rebels bombarded a military airfield and
a naval base near the city of Jaffna but suffered heavy casualties
in a second futile attempt to seize an army garrison housed in a
200-year-old fort.
   Jaffna, about 190 miles north of Colombo, is the headquarters of
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelem, the main rebel militia.
   The military officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, had
few details of casualties, but said four rebels were killed when
the naval base at Karainagar, northwest of Jaffna, came under rebel
attack.
   At least two soldiers were killed when rebels pounded the Palali
airfield, 10 miles north of Jaffna, with mortars and rockets, they
said.
   In their attempt today to seize the Jaffna military garrison,
the rebels suffered ``heavy casualties,'' the officials said.
   The Tigers had on Tuesday launched a failed assault on the
200-year-old Dutch fort where the garrison is located.
   Tiger rebels used armor-plated bulldozers today to break down
the doors of the fort and attempted to scale its 20-foot walls, the
officials said.
   Bitter hand-to-hand fighting ensued.
   Soldiers used helicopter gunships and armored cars to repulse
the attack, officials said.
   About 1,000 people are believed to have been killed since the
Tigers repudiated a year-long cease-fire with the government on
June 10 and overran police stations in the Tamil-dominated north
and east.
   Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne has said at least 600
rebels have been killed in the fighting. Another 392 rebels,
soldiers, policemen and civilians have also died, according to
reports compiled from Tiger sources, military officers and
residents.
   In the east, government troops bombed and burned deserted rebel
bunkers around the port city of Batticaloa, military officers said.
The rebels withdrew from the city on Monday, a day before
government troops took it over.
   The troops killed a Tamil woman and her 10-year-old child while
advancing into the city, said Batticaloa residents contacted by
telephone.
   On Tuesday, the army made significant advances in the east,
dislodging rebels from several cities and freeing at least two army
camps that been under seige by rebel forces. As the attacks
intensified, rebels were seen fleeing the cities and towns into the
jungle where they were expected to prepare for what could be
another bloody guerrilla war.
   The counter-attacks today were seen as an attempt by the rebels
to kick the army out of the north and allow for the establishment
of a secure base for anti-government operations.
   The rebels took control of all major towns in the northern and
eastern provinces after Indian peackeeping troops withdrew from Sri
Lanka in March. The Indian forces had failed to disarm the Tigers
during a 32-month occupation.
   Government forces and Tiger rebels jointly patrolled the streets
of the towns while leaders of both sides held a series of meetings
to decide on the political future of the regions.
   The talks had not made much headway when the fighting resumed.
   Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
claim they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who make up
75 percent of the population. The Sri Lankan armed forces, police
and government are also dominated by the Sinhalese.
   Before this month's fighting, at least 11,000 people had been
killed since Tamil militants began fighting for an independent
nation in 1983.
   In 1987, India brokered a peace accord between the two sides and
sent its peacekeeping force. But the Tigers reneged on the accord
and turned their guns on the Indians.
   In May 1989, the government negotiated a cease-fire with the
rebels and requested that the Indians pull out.

<TEXT>
   An art gallery and its director must stand
trial in September for displaying two Robert Mapplethorpe
photographs that include nude or semi-nude children, a judge has
ruled.
   Hamilton County Municipal Judge David Albanese also said Tuesday
he plans to hear more evidence before deciding whether the
Contemporary Arts Center and director Dennis Barrie also must face
obscenity charges for displaying five sexually graphic pictures.
   ``I was hoping it wouldn't go to trial. But now that it is going
to trial, I feel very confident ... we will win,'' Barrie said
after a hearing. ``I know that what we are doing is right, and we
will be vindicated in court.''
   Albanese refused defense requests to dismiss the two misdemeanor
charges against Barrie and the gallery.
   ``This court will try to make a decision of what, in Ohio,
constitutes the definition of obscenity,'' the judge said.
``Obscene material is not protected by the First Amendment. This
case is not about the rights of the curious to view an exhibition.''
   A county grand jury indicted the gallery and Barrie on April 7,
the day the seven-week exhibition ``Robert Mapplethorpe: The
Perfect Moment'' opened to the public. If convicted, Barrie faces
up to six months in jail and $1,000 in fines on each charge. The
Arts Center faces up to $5,000 in fines on each charge.
   The indictment's first count, set for a jury trial Sept. 24,
charges Barrie and the gallery with illegal use of a minor in
material involving nudity. The charge involves a picture of a boy
with his genitals exposed and a picture of a girl with her genitals
exposed.
   On the second charge, pandering obscenity, Albanese said he
wanted to conduct an evidentiary hearing Aug. 20 before deciding
whether it should go to trial.
   The prosecution is asking Albanese to limit the case to the
pictures named in the indictment. The defense contends the court
must consider the 175-photo exhibit as a whole, including its
portraits and pictures of flowers.
   ``This court is not presumptuous enough to believe that it has
the background and information necessary to try to rationalize
whether these pictures can be taken as a whole or independently,''
Albanese said in ordering the Aug. 20 hearing.
   Barrie said more than 81,000 people saw the exhibit before it
closed May 26.
   In his ruling, Albanese said he considered the Contemporary Arts
Center to be a gallery rather than a museum, and noted that a
museum is permitted more latitude in displaying art.
   One defense request to dismiss the charges argued that Ohio
obscenity law specifically exempts material exhibited for artistic
or educational purposes.
   ``This court will not pre-try the case in pretrial motions,''
Albanese said in a written copy of his ruling.

<HEAD>Castro Said To Seek Meeting with Bush in Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading Japanese newspaper reported today that
Cuban President Fidel Castro has asked Japan to arrange for him to
meet President Bush at Emperor Akihito's coronation ceremony in
November.
   The mass-circulation Asahi Shimbun, quoting unnamed sources in
the government and governing Liberal Democratic Party, said Cuba
has asked Japan to arrange such a meeting with a view toward
improving relations between Havana and Washington.
   The paper said, however, that it was not yet known whether Bush
would attend the Akihito coronation.
   However, a Foreign Ministry official said the ministry has not
received any Cuban request for Japan to help arrange a Cuba-U.S.
summit. It also has received no official reply on who will
represent Cuba at the coronation ceremony, said the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   An official of the Cuban Embassy in Tokyo, also requesting
anonymity, said, ``We have not received any official confirmation
of whether President Custro will come to Tokyo and we have had no
confirmation about the reported request'' to Japan.
   Quoting a governing party official, the Asahi said the Cuban
government unofficially informed Japan recently that Castro would
attend the emperor's coronation, scheduled for Nov. 12.
   If confirmed, the request for a Castro-Bush meeting could signal
a major policy change by Cuba, which has held to a hard-line
position during the current East-West reconciliation.
   Cuba and the United States broke diplomatic relations in 1961.
The U.S. invasion of Panama in December and the start of
anti-Castro broadcasts in March have sharpened the chill between
them.
   Japan, which recognized the Castro government in 1959, maintains
good relations with Cuba.

   Light rain fell along the New England coastline early today and
a wave of severe thunderstorms lashed the Midwest. In the West and
much of the South, dry weather with mostly clear skies prevailed.
   Rain was expected in the Ohio and mid-Mississippi valleys. Rain
also was likely across the Great Lakes and northern Midwest regions.
   Temperatures were expected to soar today into the 100s in the
desert Southwest, from Arizona to northern Louisiana and and
southern Arkansas. Hot and muggy weather was likely across the Deep
South and east Texas.
   Much of the Plains were expected to have a respite from the
heavy rains and thunderstorms that have drenched the region
recently.
   Storms pummeled sections of Kansas late Tuesday and early today,
unleashing tornadoes, hurricane force winds and rain. The storms
overturned mobile homes, leveled trees, damaged property and left
more than 40,000 people without power.
   ``It was like a bomb went off,'' said forecaster Mark Bogner of
a wave of storm cells that exploded over the state.
   Three Wichita television stations and at least eight radio
stations lost their transmission.
   The storms followed a hot day Tuesday in Wichita, where a high
of 105 degrees was recorded.
   The nation's high on Tuesday was 111 degrees at Thermal, Calif.

<HEAD>Labor Party Heads For Peres-Rabin Showdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leadership struggle between archrivals Shimon
Peres and Yitzhak Rabin has erupted in the center-left Labor Party,
and a leading Laborite said today that Peres' continued leadership
is increasingly in doubt.
   The first step in a showdown could come at a meeting Thursday of
the party's 140-member Leadership Bureau.
   ``Tomorrow's meeting could be very important concerning the
Peres-Rabin confrontation,'' party spokesman Shmuel Elgrabli said
in a telephone interview.
   Peres, 66, and Rabin, 68, have been rivals for most of their
careers. They grew up in politics as proteges of Israel's feuding
founders, with Peres following David Ben-Gurion and Rabin following
Golda Meir.
   The latest struggle flared following Peres' failure to form a
government after toppling Labor's coalition with the right-wing
Likud bloc in March. The split between the parties stemmed from a
dispute about Middle East peace moves.
   Rabin, defense minister in the last government, has since
mustered support from disgruntled Laborites relegated to
Parliament's back benches when Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir formed
a right-wing Cabinet on June 11.
   Opinion polls show the Israeli-born Rabin the favorite choice
for prime minister. He owes much of his popularity to his
iron-fisted policies against the 30-month-old Palestinian uprising
in the occupied territories.
   Rabin, also a former army chief of staff, announced on June 12
that he sought Peres' ouster.
   Even Peres' staunchest allies have shifted support to Rabin. The
most recent is former Education Minister Yitzhak Navon, who told
Israel radio today that ``it isn't a matter of personal revenge
against Shimon Peres, but of clearly viewing which of the two in
the existing circumstances could win more public support.''
   Other party leaders also have considered challenging Peres,
according to Israeli reports. Among names that have been mentioned
are Economics Minister Gad Yaacobi and former Energy Minister Moshe
Shahal.
   The Polish-born Peres has rejected appeals to step down,
claiming he is not solely responsible for Labor's failings.
   Labor spokesman Elgrabli said Thursday's weekly bureau session
would likely set the stage for a showdown between the two leaders.
   Bureau members were expected to vote on proposals to hold a
party membership census needed before a vote for chairman, Elgrabli
said.
   An attempt to block the census could put off the contest. Rabin
also could use Thursday's meeting to further his campaign while
Peres is in the United States.
   In other developments today:
   _ Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip staged a
general strike, marking a month's passing since the massacre of
seven Arab laborers by a lone Israeli gunman outside Tel Aviv.
   _Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Israel would renew
cooperation with the United States if Washington rules out PLO
participation in the Middle East peace process.
   The remark, in a speech to a meeting of the World Zionist
Organization, came amid increasingly chilly U.S.-Israeli relations
that have followed Shamir's scuttling of a U.S.-backed peace plan.

   Bulgarian officials have met with the Scotland
Yard detective investigating the 1978 killing of a Bulgarian exile
who was stabbed with a poisoned umbrella in London, Scotland Yard
said today.
   Police Inspector Pamett Spasov and Botyo Botev, an official in
the criminal department of the Bulgarian militia, met Thursday and
Monday with Detective Chief Superintendent Derek Willison, a police
spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   He said the Bulgarians did not bring any new information, but
will examine Scotland Yard's data ``and contact us if they feel
there is any further information we could follow up on.''
   Scotland Yard said the file remains open on the bizarre murder
of Georgi Markov, a defector who worked for the BBC Radio's
Bulgarian-language service. Markov was killed by poison injected
through an umbrella tip as he waited for a bus on Sept. 29, 1978.
   Britain suspects Markov was killed by agents of Bulgaria's then
hard-line Communist government, and has pressed Sofia to take
responsibility.
   Markov's British-born widow, Annabel, claims Todor Zhivkov's
government had her husband assassinated. The government that
succeeded Zhivkov in November has offered to cooperate in an
investigation.

   Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip staged a general strike today marking a month's passing since
the massacre of seven Arab laborers by a lone Israeli gunman
outside Tel Aviv.
   ``We will never forget the heroes of Black Sunday,'' said a
slogan painted in green on a wall along the main street of Gaza
City. It referred to the victims of the May 20 attack and was
signed by the Moslem fundamentalist movement Hamas, or ``Zeal.''
   The murders in the Tel Aviv suburb of Rishon Letzion set off a
series of riots in which 18 Palestinians were killed, most in army
gunfire. Two Israelis were slain in Arab revenge attacks.
   In Gaza today, only a few hundred Palestinian workers left their
homes to go to jobs in Israel, according to Arab reports. The
victims in the Rishon Letzion killings were all Gaza laborers
waiting for day jobs in Israel.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, two Palestinian youths in the
Wad al-Tufah quarter stopped cars and levied $10 fines against
drivers who were defying the strike call.
   Witnesses said the youths were handing out receipts for the
fines on forms signed by the PLO-backed United National Leadership
of the Uprising. Soldiers arrested the two youths, the witnesses
said.
   In most areas of Gaza, the West Bank and Arab east Jerusalem,
traffic was sparse and virtually all shops were closed in response
to the strike order, according to Arab reports.
   The general strike was called by the uprising's underground
leadership. A communique issued last week ordered the 1.7 million
Palestinians in the territories to raise black flags and to turn
off lights and sound whistles for 15 minutes starting at 9 p.m.
   The communique was the 58th issued since the start of the
Palestinian uprising in December 1987. During the revolt, 717
Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers and civilians,
and 45 Israelis have been killed by Palestinians. Palestinians have
killed 224 other Palestinians believed to be collaborating with
Israel.
   On Tuesday, a court ordered Ami Popper, a 21-year-old Israeli,
held for another 10 days in jail on charges he murdered the seven
Palestinians in Rishon Letzion and wounded 10 others. A date will
be set for trial once his lawyer reviews the evidence.
   Popper was arrested the day of the slayings and charged on
Monday after a psychiatric panel found him fit to stand trial.
Authorities maintained after his arrest that he was ``deranged''
and upset by an unhappy love affair.

   Two explosions rocked the U.S. aircraft carrier
Midway today during flight operations at sea, injuring 16 crew
members and leaving one missing, the Navy said. At least seven were
seriously hurt.
   A fire that broke out at the time of the first explosion was
later extinguished and the 980-foot-long ship was steaming under
its own power about 125 miles northeast of Tokyo, the Navy said in
a statement.
   The Navy's Public Affairs Office said the ship would not return
tonight to its port at Yokosuka, near Tokyo, and a decision would
be made Thursday on whether it needs to come in.
   Yokosuka city demanded that the Midway be barred from the port
until its safety had been confirmed and the causes of the fire
clarified, city spokesman Ryutaro Koizumi said. The demand was
relayed to the Foreign Ministry.
   The fire broke out in a parts storeroom four decks below the
carrier's flight deck, and was confined to the storeroom, said
Petty Officer 2nd Class Frank Mowry of the Public Affairs Office at
the Navy base at Yokosuka.
   Mowry was unsure what caused the fire and explosions, or how
long the fire burned. But he said that 1{ hours after the first
fire broke out, firefighters were moving into the storeroom to
extinguish it.
   Among the injured, he said, five were flown to Yokosuka. One was
in critical condition, two in very serious condition, one in
guarded condition and one in stable condition.
   Four others, who were seriously burned, were taken by helicopter
to the U.S. air base at Yokota, west of Japan, and then to two
separate Japanese hospitals, Mowry said.
   He had no immediate information on the other seven injured crew
members.
   The Navy said no deaths had been reported aboard the ship, which
had 4,500 people aboard including fliers and aviation crews. The
51,000-ton carrier was launched in 1943 and was later extensively
modernized.
   The Navy statement said the first explosion occurred at 12:23
p.m., about half an hour after smoke had been reported.
Firefighters were called, and a second explosion occurred about an
hour later, it added.
   ``The cause and extent of the explosion and fire are unknown at
this time,'' it said. The Navy said the Midway was conducting
routine flight operations at the time.
   Kyodo News Service said the Japan Council Against Atomic and
Hydrogen Bombs, a private anti-nuclear organization, had demanded
that the Japanese government refuse to let the Midway enter
Yokosuka.
   Japanese news reports said there had been concern in Japan
because the Midway was capable of carrying nuclear weapons.
   Japan, the only nation ever attacked with atomic bombs, bans all
nuclear weapons from its territory. Critics contend that U.S. ships
have brought nuclear weapons into Japanese ports, but the
government says the United States would have to ask Japan's
permission and never has done so.
   As a matter of policy, the United States refuses to comment on
the location of its nuclear weapons.
   The last major blaze aboard a U.S. warship was May 8, when fire
broke out before dawn on the guided-missile destroyer USS Conyngham
during routine operations in the Atlantic about 100 miles southeast
of Norfolk, Va.
   One crewman was killed and 18 other sailors were injured in the
fire, which broke out in the engine roome, officials said. The
cause is under investigation.
   At the time, it was the worst shipboard blaze since a string of
accidents prompted the Navy to suspend operations for a two-day
safety check in November.

   An explosion ripped through a
wastewater treatment plant today, killing two workers.
   The 3:10 a.m. explosion might have been caused by a gas leak,
said William Schatz, attorney for the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer
District. Authorities were investigating.
   ``The explosion was in a rather limited area. There is extensive
damage, but it shouldn't affect the treatment process. They've got
to get in and clear some of the debris,'' Schatz said.
   The explosion caused about $1 million in damage, he said.
   Schatz identified the victims as plant operator Mark Swiger, 24,
and Robert Angiocchi, 54, a supervisor.
   The plant in suburban Cleveland is one of three wastewater
treatment plants operated by the district, which serves Cleveland
and its suburbs.

<TEXT>
   Former high-ranking Communist Ion
Iliescu, whose leadership has been tarnished by violent attacks on
opponents, took the oath of office as president today and swore to
uphold democracy and human rights.
   Iliescu's heavy-handed tactics _ especially in calling in miners
last week who beat suspected government critics _ have alienated
leaders in Western capitals. U.S. Ambassador Alan J. Green Jr.
boycotted the inauguration, although the ambassadors of all other
major Western nations attended.
   Green returned from Washington on Monday saying the democratic
process in Romania had come to a halt.
   An opposition leader, Ion Ratiu, praised the American action,
calling it ``the most eloquent way the U.S. could show its
condemnation of the vigilante tactics that Mr. Iliescu generated
last week.''
   No major protests were reported today, although some university
students and teachers were on strike. The government this week
arrested several opposition leaders but offered to talk with other
activists.
   ``I swear faithfulness to the Romanian people and to their
ideals of freedom and prosperity,'' Iliescu told Parliament and
foreign diplomats during the ceremony in the Atheneum Concert Hall
in downtown Bucharest.
   ``I swear to observe the country's laws, to defend democracy
(and) the fundamental human rights and freedoms, the sovereignty
and the territorial integrity of our homeland,'' he said.
   In his first decision as president, Iliescu appointed Petre
Roman as premier. Roman, 44, a former engineering professor, has
been interim premier since the bloody December revolution that
toppled dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Iliescu, 60, a high-ranking Communist official in the late
1960s, was formally declared president by Alexandru Birladeanu,
chairman of the Senate, the Parliament's higher chamber.
   Iliescu and his National Salvation Front took power in the
December revolution and won the May 20 election by a landslide.
   Critics say the Front, which counts many former Communists among
its leaders, is little more than the old repressive regime in
disguise.
   Last week, police attacked peaceful anti-government protesters
to break up a 53-day vigil on a central square. Rioting followed in
which government buildings were attacked and Iliescu appealed to
the miners.
   The miners attacked people suspected of being government critics
and ransacked the offices of opposition parties and their
newspapers.
   In his inauguration speech, Iliescu blamed last week's unrest on
``extremist political groups'' who he said were ``organized and
coordinated according to a scenario for destabilization.''
   But he also criticized the miners _ he had personally thanked
them on Friday _ for ``breaking into public institutions,
(opposition) party headquarters and private homes, and for roughing
up people'' who were innocent.
   ``We registered excesses, violations of some institutions ...
attacks on some citizens,'' Iliescu said. ``We uneqivocally
dissociate ourselves from the actions which transcended the legal
framework.''
   This week, the government is at once talking to opposition
groups and detaining their leaders.
   Lawmakers have authorized police action to stop any new street
demonstrations. Anti-government protesters gathered this week in
University Square. Demonstrators were forcibly removed from the
square last week.
   A communique carried by the state Rompres news agency said
Interior Minister Viorel Doru Ursu and the Romanian Information
Service _ the new intelligence agency that replaced Ceausescu's
feared Securitate _ had invited student organizations and
intellectuals to discuss ``problems of common interest.''
   Parliament's lower house on Monday gave police and soldiers the
authority to clear University Square of protesters. The upper
chamber, in a separate measure, urged police to take ``immediate
action'' against unauthorized protests.
   On Tuesday, the Interior Ministry arrested two opposition
figures, Dumitru Dinca and Nica Leon, leader of the small National
Democratic Party.
   It said Dinca had been charged with ``larceny and instigation
toward committing major crimes,'' while Leon was detained under a
warrant accusing him of ``destruction of public property.''
   The two were being held as part of an investigation into the
June 13 breakup by riot police of the University Square sit-in and
the subsequent unrest. The government has claimed ``fascists'' were
trying to overthrow it but has yet to produce any evidence.
   Some Romanians have speculated that the violence was provoked to
give the government the opportunity to silence or at least
intimidate the opposition. On Monday, authorities detained Marian
Munteanu, a student leader severely beaten by pro-government miners
last week. Munteanu was taken to a police hospital on charges of
instigating violence.
   That led his wife, Claudia, to seek refuge at the home of Dutch
Ambassador Coen F. Stork.
   Government opponents seek the ouster of Iliescu and the other
former Communists who hold top posts in the National Salvation
Front. They have also demanded an independent television station.

   The parliament of Uzbekistan began discussing a
declaration of independence today, becoming the first of the five
Soviet Central Asian republics to consider breaking with Moscow,
the official Tass news agency reported.
   The Supreme Soviet of Uzbekistan debated a measure that would
establish the republic as a separate country responsible for its
own domestic and foreign policy, Tass said.
   The arid, poverty-stricken Central Asian republics of the Soviet
south have suffered from repeated outbreaks of ethnic unrest, but
until now have not followed the parliamentary struggle for
secession waged by the three Baltic republics in the northwest.
   Moscow imposed economic sanctions and an oil and gas embargo on
Lithuania after it declared independence on March 11. Latvia and
Estonia followed suit by declaring a transition period to
independence.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has denounced Lithuania's
independence declaration as illegal and has demanded that it be
suspended.
   Uzbekistan, a cotton-growing republic of 20 million people, has
the best-organized popular movement in the region, Berlik, and is
seen as a center for activism in largely Moslem Central Asia.
   Tass said initially that Uzbekistan's declaration of
independence was approved by a majority of Supreme Soviet members,
but it later issued an advisory withdrawing the report.
   Alexander Snasten, an editor at Tass' world service, said
discussion of the measure had begun but that it had not been
approved.
   ``The declaration stipulates Uzbekistan's state sovereignty, its
independence and the supremacy of republican laws on its entire
territory,'' Tass said.
   It said the measure would put ``all issues of domestic issues of
domestic and foreign policy under the authority of Uzbekistan.''
The declaration suggests the Soviet Union would be treated like a
foreign country, saying Uzbekistan would ``determine the nature and
foundations that underlie its future economic, cultural and other
relations with the U.S.S.R. and other states.''
   Tass said many deputies had argued that the declaration should
wait until a new federal treaty is worked out among the 15 Soviet
republics, but were overruled.
   Meanwhile, the parliament of Soviet Georgia, pressed by hunger
strikers, convened a special session today to discuss legal steps
for securing independence for the Caucasus republic, Tass reported.
   On March 9, the Georgian Supreme Soviet condemned the republic's
annexation by the Soviet Union and urged negotiations on
independence, becoming the fourth of the 15 Soviet republics to
begin a parliamentary struggle for secession.
   The Supreme Soviet convened a month ahead of scheduled in
response to demands from hunger-striking university students in the
Georgian capital of Tbilisi, the Soviet news agency said.
   The dozens of students ended their hunger strikes last week
after their demands on the session and its agenda were satisfied,
said Valerian Khukhunashvili, a Moscow-based Georgian activist.
   The session that opened today was to discuss bills on the
transition to independence, elections, citizenship, economic
independence and other measures.
   Georgia, a mountainous republic of 5.3 million people, was
occupied by the Red Army in 1921 and subsequently signed treaties
incorporating it into the Soviet Union.

<TEXT>
   Florida's former top tax collector
pleaded no contest today to a charge of attempted official
misconduct and was sentenced to a year's probation.
   Katie Tucker also agreed to pay $500 in court costs. She
resigned from her job as state Revenue Department director in
February in the face of certain dismissal by Gov. Bob Martinez and
the independently elected Cabinet.
   Circuit Judge F.E. Steinmeyer III modified the probation to
allow Ms. Tucker, 46, to carry out her duties as a reserve officer
in the Coast Guard.
   Ms. Tucker had been charged with official misconduct by
falsifying documents, a third-degree felony that carries a maximum
five-year prison sentence. The misdemeanor charge to which she
pleaded no contest could have meant a year in jail.
   The charge stemmed from a state investigation into whether she
had singled out the businesses owned by Donald G. Resha for

<HEAD>Justice Clears Way for Surgery for California Boy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Supreme Court justice has cleared the way
for court-ordered corrective surgery for a 6-year-old California
boy born with clubfeet and a dislocated hip.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor refused to set aside rulings that
the surgery may be performed on Kou Xiang without the consent of
his parents, Hmong immigrants from the hill region of Laos.
   O'Connor's denial was dated Tuesday but not disclosed until
today.
   An emergency request submitted in behalf of Kou's father, Ger
Xiang of Fresno, said the surgery ordered by a state judge would
violate religious freedom and parental rights.
   Ger Xiang and his wife, Houa Vue, believe their family would be
punished by spirits for tampering with their son's deformities.
   According to court documents, they believe the boy was born with
clubfeet as punishment for some wrong committed by another relative.
   Fresno County Judge Lawrence O'Neill in February ordered the
corrective surgery after officials of the county's Department of
Social Services sought such help.
   Kou has said he does not want the surgery.
   Medical testimony during a two-day hearing before O'Neill
indicated the boy would lose movement in his legs and be
wheelchair-bound by adulthood without the surgery.
   Waiting until the boy is old enough to make his own decision
would decrease the chances of success, according to the medical
testimony.
   The judge postponed the effect of his order to let the boy's
father appeal. Two state appellate courts rejected those appeals.
   In the emergency request acted on Tuesday, lawyers for Ger Xiang
said county social services officials ``cannot demonstrate a
compelling state interest sufficient to override (the family's)
religious ... beliefs.''
   The request said the ``series of unwanted, major surgical
operations'' should not be forced on Kou and his family.
   The case is Ger Xiang vs. Superior Court, A-892.

   Under fire from Communist hard-liners, President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today that he might soon leave his post
as party leader.
   ``Tomorrow, or after 10 days or 12 days, there may be another
general secretary or chairman of the party,'' Gorbachev told the
largely anti-reform delegates at a conference of the Russian
republic's Communist Party.
   He did not say if he might resign or if he expected to be ousted
from the party job. Giving up that position legally should not
affect his five-year term as president of the Soviet Union.
   There has been speculation for months that Gorbachev's
long-range strategy is to shift the key leadership positions from
the party to the government.
   His appeal appeared to be an effort to gain support at the
fractious meeting. Conservative delegates have attacked him for
diminishing their influence.
   Politburo member Yegor Ligachev _ without mentioning Gorbachev _
criticized him indirectly for retaining the job of party general
secretary after his election earlier this year to the new post of
Soviet president.
   ``It is impossible to run the party, this guiding force, without
devoting full time to it,'' Ligachev, the most prominent Soviet
hard-liner, told the congress.
   Gorbachev did not rebut the conservative criticism, but said his
accusers were poorly informed and disrespectful.
   ``The comrades seem to suspect the general secretary of the
Communist Party of some vacillation, hesitation, and so forth,'' he
said angrily. ``Some of the comrades are being too casual with the
general secretary, with the president of the country.''
   ``Before expressing opinions, and especially accusations, you
have to know a whole lot and understand it, and not just speak off
the cuff,'' Gorbachev said.
   The delegates at this week's meeting will form the majority of
delegates at the national party congress opening July 2, which is
expected to make considerable changes in the party leadership.
   The Foreign Ministry spokesman, Gennady Gerasimov, when asked by
reporters whether Gorbachev would be elected then, said: ``We'll
see at the congress. It will add suspense to your lives.''
   Gorbachev came under heavy fire for his reforms at Tuesday's
opening session. A Siberian hard-liner speaking for his regional
Communist organization urged Gorbachev and the entire leadership to
resign for taking the party out of decision-making.
   Other delegates won applause for criticizing Gorbachev's
reforms, which have ended the Communist monopoly and transferred
its power to the government.
   The conference, considered a dress rehearsal for the key
national party congress, also voted by an overwhelming majority
today to condemn a legislative proposal that would liquidate party
cells in the army, KGB and government.
   By a 2,008-to-398 margin, the conference delegates approved a
resolution saying the decree ``would weaken Communist influence in
society,'' and strengthen ``reactionary elements.''
   The vote was described as a rebuff to Boris N. Yeltsin, who
calls for even more radical reforms than Gorbachev in his position
as the new president of the Russian republic.
   Yeltsin heads the republic's parliament, which gave preliminary
approval Monday to a ``Decree on Power'' that calls for party cells
in the government, security police and armed forces to be
liquidated.
   The vote strongly indicated that hard-liners would similarly
battle Gorbachev's liberal program at the Soviet Communist Party
Congress.
   The Russian party conference also moved today to form a separate
Communist Party of the vast Russian republic. The formal decision
to create the party, which would require a two-thirds majority from
among the 2,700 delegates, was expected to be taken later in the
day.
   The Russian Communist Party, which would remain within the
framework of the national party of more than 18 million members,
was absorbed by the central party 65 years ago.
   Of the 15 Soviet republics, only Russia has not had its own
party, in part because Russians dominated the national party.
Russia contains three-quarters of the Soviet territory.

United States and abroad.

   Bangor (Maine) Daily News on flag burning:
   The American flag, which has been shot at, set afire, sunk with
foundering ships, vilified, belittled and scorned, remains a
flawless symbol of the United States. The flag remains unscathed
not because of its material but because of the freedoms and
responsibilities it represents. By protecting the material of the
flag through a constitutional amendment, we risk weakening those
freedoms and responsibilities.
   The Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling making unconstitutional a law
that would prohibit flag burning looked beyond the emotional
support for the flag to the freedom for Americans to express
dissent and to challenge the government. Though burning the flag is
an ugly act that many would call a type of political pornography,
this is not a question of taste but of rights.

   The Keene (N.H.) Sentinel on flag burning:
   Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, the principal authors of the
Bill of Rights, believed that the key to maintaining a free society
was to cultivate a respect for liberty, but not necessarily a
respect for every manifestation of liberty. The distinction is
important. Jefferson and Madison understood that the exercise of
freedom would inevitably result in the expression of very unpopular
opinions.
   President George Bush and Reps. Chuck Douglas and Robert Smith
(both R-N.H.) are among contemporary politicians who don't seem to
understand that concept. With unbecoming arrogance, they are
proposing to improve upon the work of Jefferson and Madison. They
want to pass a constitutional amendment to amend the Bill of Rights
for the first time in the country's history.

   The Plain Dealer, Cleveland, on flag burning:
   The Constitution protects Americans' right of political dissent,
even if they express their protest in ways the majority may
deplore. With its reasoned defense of the First Amendment's
guarantee of free expression, the Supreme Court ... should have put
a stop to the demagoguery over an emotional non-issue: the phony
furor over flag burning. ...
   No other nation has an absolute guarantee of its citizens'
freedoms. If the right of free expression is to remain intact,
mainstream Americans must tolerate dissent, even in its most
eccentric or offensive forms.
   Yet a momentary scare about flag burning has incited
opportunists to cheapen the meaning of patriotism. The
more-loyal-than-thou posturing _ stage-managed by the White House
in a deplorable effort to sway votes in this election year _
foreshadows another campaign season of flag-factory rallies and
mass recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance.
   Such flag fanaticism has become worse than a mere frivolity: It
now threatens to shred the Constitution itself.

   The Free Press, Mankato, Minn., on flag burning:
   Here we go again.
   The Supreme Court again overturned a federal law prohibiting
flag burning.
   This ruling means that now we're sure to see a constitutional
amendment barreling down the Congressional pike to make flag
burning illegal. Let's hope sanity prevails on Capitol Hill, and
our representatives vote down this wrong-headed move.
   Few, if any, have ever been swayed because somebody else torched
a flag. To the contrary, such acts are found by the vast majority
of us to be repulsive.
   So why not make this exception to free speech?
   Because the right of free speech has importance and value as one
of the fundamental rights of our political system. The First
Amendment protects unpopular speech; popular speech needs no
shield. The flag has importance and value _ but only as a symbol of
our system. Free speech is the more important right in our system.
   It may be too much to hope that the demagogues of the Republican
Party will let this issue drop. But we can hope, as we do, that
Congress will reject the flag burning amendment.

   The North Jersey Herald and News, Passaic, N.J., on the legal
reaction to flag burning and rap group 2 Live Crew:
   This is scary. As eastern Europeans and Soviet citizens struggle
to emerge from an oppressed past to a democratic future, some
Americans are ready to turn back the clock more than 200 years on
our own Bill of Rights.
   In Fort Lauderdale, Fla., a federal judge declared a rap album
by the group 2 Live Crew, ``As Nasty As They Want to Be,'' obscene
and prohibited its sale.
   A grandstanding sheriff in Broward County ordered the arrest of
a store owner for selling the record, then busted band members for
performing songs from the album, even though the concert was
adults-only.
   Meanwhile, in our nation's capital, lawmakers have turned an
irrelevant non-issue into the nation's top priority. The problem? A
few jerks in Podunk might burn the American flag as a statement of
protest. So President Bush and Congress, in a cynical appeal to
patriotism, want to tamper with the U.S. Constitution.
   Short of yelling ``fire'' in a crowded theater, Americans must
not give in to the temptation of shutting up people whose
statements we may find objectionable. Those who would have
government censor the public can look to point east to see the
consequences.

   Commercial Dispatch, Columbus, Miss., on sobriety checkpoints:
   The U.S. Supreme Court was right on target the other day when it
ruled that law enforcement checkpoints are a reasonable means to
combat drunken driving.
   These checkpoints are a small inconvenience considering the more
important benefits _ helping to keep drunk drivers off our
highways. ...
   The real effectiveness of these checkpoints is deterrence.
Critics argue these programs cannot be proven to be more effective
than other techniques. But local and state law enforcement
officials were quick to note ... that checkpoints do work. They're
convinced of it. So why shouldn't local authorities have the right
to decide whether such techniques will be used on their roads.
   Pertaining to charges these interruptions are simple harassment
by government, the key word as far as Bill of Rights' protection
goes is ``unreasonable.''
   But to us it would seem far more reasonable to be concerned
about the bloodbath linked to drunken driving all across our nation
_ 23,000 deaths in 1988, according to U.S. Department of
Transportation figures. ...
   It just makes good sense that our lawmen should have among their
preventive arsenal the right to conduct sobriety checkpoints.

   The Hindustan Times, northern India, on space exploration:
   President Bush last month set the deadline for a manned mission
to Mars: 2019, the 50th anniversary of the first Apollo manned
landing on the Moon. Like President Kennedy before him, Bush is
apparently challenging the nation to spend large resources and to
risk lives to go to another world. ...
   NASA, set up by the Eisenhower administration in 1958, succeeded
magnificently by putting 12 men onto the Moon by December 1972.
   Can it repeat a far more complex and spectacular feat to the red
planet in less than 29 years? In fact, is a manned journey to Mars
even technically feasible? The red planet is hundreds of times
farther away than the Moon.
   The voyage would probably take some two to two and and a half
years to complete _ 50 times longer than the longest Apollo mission
and to achieve it would require technical advances on three fronts
which are far from being accomplished.
   First, the effects of prolonged weightlessness have yet to be
overcome; secondly, reliable closed cycle space habitats
(spaceships adequate enough for six to eight people to live and
work in without being resupplied) have to be built; and thirdly, a
giant rocket, with ten times more propulsion power than the Saturn
V Moon rocket would be required.
   Since the decommissioning of Saturn V, the U.S. has lacked a
heavylift rocket. The prohibitive cost, estimated at an additional
$15 billion a year on top of the expense of present space
activities, doubtful technical feasibility and lack of political
will all make the Mars manned journey a dream less likely to become
a reality.

   Al-Ahram, Cairo, on Israel-PLO:
   The United States is still arousing doubts around the future of
the American-Palestinian dialogue because of what the American
adminstration has repeated about the PLO not outrightly condemning
the failed Palestinian commando raid on the shore of Tel Aviv.
   The American threat arouses a number of questions:
   First: The United States brings up the subject of cutting off
the dialogue as though the dialogue was the aim resulting from the
Palestinian concesssions in 1988.
   Second: Anyone who has followed the results of the dialogue
between the two sides up to now will easily realize that there is
no positive result. The U.S. could not even obtain initial Israeli
approval of the Baker plan, which the PLO had reservations over.
   Third: American insistence on a PLO condemnation of the raid
provokes the issue of equal treatment, and specifically a request
from Israel for a condemnation of the terrorist acts it practices
against the Palestiniaian people.
   Fourth: Just as the PLO is asked to condemn an act it has not
perpetrated, so should Israel be requested to condemn violent acts
it has not perpetrated, such as those against PLO members in many
countries.
   The American threat to cut off the dialogue with the PLO has no
gravity, neither as concerns the value of the dialogue nor as
concerns the justice of the request, especially after the formation
of a government of war in Israel.

   Le Figaro, Paris, on Algeria's local elections:
   The fundamentalists' victory in the local elections marks the
second Algerian revolution. But the adversary was still France _
yesterday because it was the colonizer, today because it represents
the successful economic model of the West. In Algeria, revolution
is first of all revulsion.
   As the first expression of their identity, the Algerians
experimented with socialism. ...
   Now Algerians seem tempted by a second dead end, that of
fundamentalism. Despairing of the future that was vainly promised
them through socialism, they are turning toward the past. They want
to take refuge in a faith which, for each complicated question,
gives a simple answer.

   Kenya Times, Nairobi, Kenya, on continued civil war and famine

going.
   And still this relief food does not reach the needy people
easily due to the heavy fighting going on in some strategic areas.
   But really, can Ethiopia afford to divert its attention from
meeting the needs of the people to fighting a bloody, endless and
devastating war? Is it not time the war came to an end?

   Straits Times, Singapore, on the future of Canada:
   The threat of national disintegration leads to the larger, and
perpetual, question of a Canadian identity. Canadians are said to
have a problem defining themselves in a way that distinguishes them
sufficiently from U.S. Americans, the penetrative vigor of whose
civilization is enhanced by geographical proximity, economic logic
and ethnic links.
   Much of the problem, one suspects, stems from Canadians trying
to do something which they need not do. The existence of countries,
like that of human beings, does not need to be justified.
   The real question is to ask what would happen to Canadians'
identity complex if the country were to disappear. What would
replace it? What surer identity awaits the doubting Canadian? If
there is none, is it not better to look within the nation and
examine the links which are there, however problematic these might
be, rather than seek the sense of self either through divisiveness
at home or distinctiveness abroad?
   This sounds negative, and necessarily so, for ethnic identity in
all multicultural societies is a negative starting point. The whole
point is to move beyond that line, creating an identity in the very
act of looking for one. For countries, again like children, are not
just born but grow.

   The Independent, London, on Eastern Europe:

a revival of nationalism and the rudiments of democracy have not
yet brought back anything recognizable as the rule of law. ...
   European governments ought certainly to make plain their
disapproval to ... (Ion) Iliescu, and underline it in the most
effective way by stating that no aid will be forthcoming to
governments that send licensed bullies to beat up their citizens.

<HEAD>Flooding Sweeps Away Illinois Rescue Worker; 30 Hurt in Kansas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy rains caused flooding in Illinois, where a rescue worker
was dragged off a collapsed bridge and was missing today, and
vicious storms pummeled parts of Kansas, authorities said.
   Flooding shut down roads in several counties near Springfield
and Peoria in central Illinois. National Weather Service
meteorologists said at least 4 inches of rain had fallen in several
counties in the area since 1 a.m.
   A Washburn Fire Department rescue worker was swept away by flood
waters on state Route 26. The worker, whose identity was not
immediately known, disappeared after stepping out of an ambulance
on a collapsed bridge, according to Illinois State Police
Dispatcher Peggy Dehnbostel.
   State Emergency Services and Disaster Agency officials, whose
Springfield offices were flooded, said today they were still unable
to determine where else flooding had occurred.
   In Kansas, several counties were lashed by tornadoes and sheets
of rain. The storms overturned mobile homes, leveled trees, damaged
property and left more than 40,000 people without power.
   ``It was like a bomb went off,'' Mark Bogner of WeatherData Inc.
said of the dozens of storms cells that exploded over the prairie
from Dodge City and Pratt east to Butler County.
   The violent night followed a hot day in Wichita. A record high
of 105 a poor Dona Violeta.''
   Mrs. Chavarria's husband, Jose, is a bricklayer who brings home
$20 a month, slightly more than she earned as a grade school
teacher. Her teaching papers were lost they moved here recently
from Esteli, so they decided she should open the store.
   Many people seem to share the guarded optimism of Mrs. Chavarria
and the neighbor, but there also is a ``show me'' attitude that
good times are not just around the corner.
   Nicaraguans voted the Sandinistas out Feb. 25 and inflation
still is high nearly two months after Mrs. Chamorro's pro-American
government was inaugurated.
   Inflation reached 36,000 percent in 1988, then declined to 1,800
percent in 1989.
   Francisco Mayorga, president of the central bank, now gauges it
weekly. His figures were 47 percent for the first week of May, then
17 percent, 12 and 11 for the next three.
   Mayorga, who was educated at Yale and devised Mrs. Chamorro's
economic recovery plan, accused the Sandinistas of using the
two-month transition period to undermine the new government.
   He said they spent money wildly and printed more to cover the
deficit.
   President Bush signed a $300 million aid package May 26. The
first $60 million arrived quickly and, between May 25 and May 31,
the black market price of a dollar declined from 310,000 cordobas
to 290,000.
   ``The exchange houses are supplying dollars again; that's why it
went down,'' said Jose Gutierrez, one of two dozen currency dealers
on a street near the Mexican Embassy.
   Gutierrez and his colleagues wave wads of cordobas at passing
motorists, and police look the other way.
   Another sign of improvement is a 20 percent increase in planted
farm acreage over last year, Mayorga said. Food production fell
steadily under the Sandinistas.
   On the negative side, Nicaragua's currency has been devalued
frequently since Mrs. Chamorro took office. The parallel exchange
rate, which governs most dollar transactions, had gone from 70,800
cordobas to 226,600 by May 31.
   Some Chamorro supporters are beginning to grumble.
   ``Maybe we would have been better off under the Sandinistas,''
said Julio Gonzalez, 33, who runs an auto repair shop with his
cousin. Former President Daniel Ortega, he said, ``had the economy
more or less under control.''
   What does he expect to happen now? ``Maybe we'll see an
improvement in six months, a year, but it better happen. Just like
we knocked down Somoza, we knocked down the Sandinistas. Well, we
can knock down this government too.''
   The Sandinista revolution overthrew the late President Anastasio
Somosa in July 1979.
   Rolando Perez Sanchez, a 29-year-old Sandinista union leader,
listened with skepticism to Gonzalez, his friend and neighbor.
   ``It's not going to happen,'' he said, shaking his head. ``This
government if full of bourgeois who will hoard all the capital and
leave the workers the crumbs.
   ``What we have to do is what Daniel said _ rule from below to
defend the conquests of the revolution.''
   ``Ruling from below'' took the form of a crippling strike by
public employees in May, after which the government gave broad
concessions to unions.
   Mrs. Chamorro has had to proceed carefully because of the
militant Sandinista opposition.
   Her government plans to review confiscations of property under
the Sandinistas and continues to trim the huge bureaucracy, firing
public employees.
   Sandinista threats of more strikes if the firings continued have
not materialized, and their protest marches draw smaller crowds. If
economic improvement continues, the Sandinistas could lose the
leverage of being the defenders of worker's buying power.
   Another Sandinista rallying point, the Contra rebels, might
disappear once the guerrillas demobilize.
   ``I'm like St. Thomas; I'll have to see it to believe it,''
Gonzalez said.
   For Mrs. Chavarria, who has three small children, abolition of
the two-year draft for boys of 16 is great progress.
   ``You don't know what a relief this is for us mothers,'' she
said. ``As for the rest of it, we'll have to wait. At least we eat
every day.''

   The massacre of eight people by a man with a rifle
could undercut the powerful gun lobby at a time when Florida voters
are considering a constitutional amendment imposing a three-day
wait on handgun purchases.
   ``Anytime you have a tragedy, those people with hidden agendas
see any and every emotional opportunity to try to justify their
erroneous position and try to deprive the people of their rights,''
said Marion Hammer, spokeswoman for the National Rifle
Association's Florida branch.
   The debate over the amendment on November's ballot intensified
after James Edward Pough, 42, a day laborer, killed eight people
Monday with a semiautomatic rifle before taking his own life with a
revolver at an auto loan agency. Police said Pough also killed two
people on the street Sunday with the rifle.
   ``How many messages do we send to the Congress? How many to the
state Legislature?'' Jacksonville Mayor Tommy Hazouri said Tuesday.
``If it means seeking changes ... we're going to do that.''
   State Rep. Ron Silver, chairman of the House Criminal Justice
Committee, said the fact the waiting period is being settled by a
referendum rather than a vote in the Legislature shows many
lawmakers still fear the NRA's clout.
   But he added that polls indicate heavy support for the
amendment, and he said passage could give legislators confidence to
pass other gun-control laws.
   ``I think Florida is waking up,'' Silver said.
   California passed an assault weapons bill in 1989 in the
aftermath of the Stockton, Calif., schoolyard spree by a drifter
with an AK-47 assault rifle who killed five children and wounded 30
other people. President Bush approved an import ban on assault
weapons and a Senate bill would extend the ban to domestic
manufacture of four weapons identified as used mainly in drug
violence.
   Florida has tackled gun legislation several times in recent
years.
   A 1987 law removed gun registration from county control in favor
of statewide registration rules. A law taking effect Oct. 1
requires gun sellers to check all applicants through a crime
computer in Tallahassee.
   But lawmakers on a study commission on assault weapons failed to
agree on which weapons should be banned.
   U.S. Rep. Bill Nelson, a Democrat running for governor, has
called banning assault weapons a priority.
   ``It is harder to rent a car in Florida than it is to buy an
AK-47,'' he said during a debate Monday before he knew of the
shooting spree. A Nelson aide needed less than 10 minutes to walk
into a Miami gun shop and come out with an AK-47 and ammunition
last month.
   Gov. Bob Martinez, a Republican seeking re-election, said
Tuesday the law requiring a background check by gun dealers is a
responsible step, ``but at the same time we must maintain the
freedom to own guns which have useful sporting purposes.''
   Pough's .30-caliber semiautomatic rifle would be banned under
New Jersey's month-old law on assault weapons, considered the
nation's toughest, because its clip held more than 15 rounds.
   Nelson wants a seven-day waiting period on handgun purchases.
Democratic front-runner Lawton Chiles also supports a waiting
period.
   Now, gun purchasers are required to have some identification,
such as a driver's license, and fill out a questionnaire on
arrests, mental illness and drug use.
   But there is no way for merchants to confirm the information
other than by investigating on their own.
   It is illegal in Florida for a convicted felon to own a handgun.
But technically, Pough wasn't a convicted felon.
   In 1971, he was charged with manslaughter in the shooting death
of a man; he pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and was sentenced
to five years' probation, court records show. After probation, his
record was wiped clean.
   That made it legal for Pough to own a gun under Florida law.
   ``It's a loophole we need to plug up,'' Jacksonville Sheriff Jim
McMillan said.

   A man was jailed Wednesday until at
least the year 2014 for a bungled contract killing in which the
wrong man was shot.
   Justice Barry Beach, in imposing the stiffest sentence possible,
called Roy Anthony Pollitt an evil man. ``You have demonstrated you
are a person without pity and are quite incapable of remorse,'' the
judge said.
   Pollitt, 38, was convicted this month of the murder of Lindsay
Simpson on Sept. 18, 1984. He pleaded innocent.
   Prosecutors said Pollitt was hired by another man to kill a
confessed heroin supplier, Alan Williams. But Williams heard of the
plot and left his house, even though he was aware that Simpson, his
brother-in-law, was due to arrive there, Beach said.
   Pollitt shot Simpson after he arrived with his wife and
8-month-old daughter, according to the prosecution. Mrs. Simpson
testified that her husband got out of the car, argued with Pollitt
and insisted he was not Williams, but was shot in the back of the
head.

   A water-skiing stuntman was seriously
injured Wednesday when a stunt being filmed for a U.S. television
production went wrong.
   Geoff Carrington, 30, who holds several world records for
water-skiing, was to hit a ramp and soar over the speedboat towing
him. The boat was then to lift off from a second ramp and fly into
a specially constructed bait shop near the edge of the water.
   Several practice runs went well, but during the actual filming
the boat slowed unexpectedly as it hit the second ramp. This threw
Carrington off-course and into a pier.
   A medical team treated Carrington for more than 15 minutes
before he was airlifted to the Gold Coast Hospital, where he was
undergoing treatment for internal injuries.
   The attempted stunt, which also called for the bait shop to
explode with pyrotechnics when hit by the speedboat, was one of six
stunts planned for a Fox Television special. The speedboat driver,
Warren Chapman, was in shock after the incident.
   Police were investigating the incident.

   A male donkey separated from its mate by
its master bit the man to death Wednesday, Iran's official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said the donkey was so
incensed when its master, Bashir Khedmat, separated him from his
female companion that it went for Khedmat's throat. The animal was
clubbed to death by farm workers, the agency said.
   It said the incident occurred in the village of Owj-Tappeh in

   Two Americans were among 140 people
on assassination lists seized recently from Communist rebels,
military sources said Wednesday.
   The lists were discovered during a five-day military operation
that began Friday in Manila's suburbs of Paranaque, Las Pinas and
Taguig. Ten suspected members of the Alex Boncayao Brigade, the
Manila wing of the Communist New People's Army, were arrested
during the raids, the military said.
   Col. Ajerico Kagaoan, chief of the Philippine Constabulary's
intelligence unit, said troops found lists containing ``the
identities of foreign nationals, civilian officials and ranking
officers as liquidation targets ... in the next six months.''
   Kagaoan did not elaborate on the nationalities of the
foreigners. But intelligence officers, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said they included two American businessmen employed by
a firm in Taguig.
   Others on the list were mostly Filipino military personnel,
including at least four colonels, the sources said.
   They refused to give the Americans' names but said the U.S.
Embassy and the intended victims were notified. U.S. Embassy
spokeswoman Victoria Middleton would not comment on the report.
   Eight Americans have been slain by Communist rebels since April
1989. Six were either military or military-affiliated personnel.

   Businessmen and former government officials
asked Congress on Wednesday to provide a ``modern Marshall plan''
to help small businesses and boost U.S. exports to Eastern Europe.
   Saying the United States is losing ground to Western European
entrepreneurs, they endorsed legislation to set up centers to
develop small business in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia and a
corps of American volunteers to train individuals.
   ``The original Marshall plan primarily benefited the U.S. as the
war-devastated economies of (Western) Europe were resuscitated, and
tremendous export markets developed for U.S. companies,'' said D.
Bruce Merrifield, an assistant secretary of Commerce in the Reagan
administration.
   ``This `modern' Marshall Plan will be equally beneficial for all
concerned,'' he said.
   The Marshall plan sent billions of dollars in U.S. government
money into the industry of western Europe in the 1940s and 1950s.
   He called for passage of the bill introduced by Rep. John L.
LaFalce, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Small Business Committee.
   M. P. Kobelinski, Small Business Administrator under President
Carter, American businesses have been too slow to move into Eastern
Europe.
   ``I travel to Poland often and witness the literal invasion of
potential foreign investors, scores of Japanese, German, Italian,
Swedish, French and Korean businessmen and the very small
smattering of American business representatives,'' he told the
committee.
   He suggested the federal government's Export-Import Bank
encourage small loans in Eastern Europe to buy American equipment.

<HEAD>Woman Celebrates Her 109th Birthday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROSEBURG, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nina Rust rode an elephant and an airplane
on previous birthdays, but this year she took it easy. It was,
after all, her 109th year.
   The Roseburg woman went to the Wildlife Safari animal park in
Winston for her birthday Monday and had lunch at the White Rhino
restaurant overlooking a pond and an island providing habitat for
white gibbon apes.
   On her 99th birthday, she went to the animal park to take her
first elephant ride. She decided the ride was a bit bumpy and has
never duplicated the feat. On her 100th, she had her first airplane
flight
   In 1982, at age 101, she drove back to Lincoln, Neb., with her
daughter, Phyllis McMeekin of Roseburg, for a family gathering.
They then flew to Philadelphia and toured several Eastern states.
   When she turned 103, ``Dear Reader,'' a book about Rust's life
was published. It was written by McMeekin, with whom Rust has lived
for the past 35 years. Also in 1984, Rust's first
great-great-great-grandchild was born.
   Although not a first, Rust danced with her son-in-law and
another man on her 105th birthday during a party at the Senior
Center. Later in the year, McMeekin caught Rust crocheting and
reading at the same time. When she commented on it, Rust said, ``I
can't waste any time.''
   Her 106th year brought her first ride on a motorcycle. Her
grandson took her on the ride around the trailer park where Rust
lives. Upon dismounting the motorcycle, Rust announced, ```There,
I've done one more thing I'd never done in my life,''' McMeekin
recalled.
   While Rust was 107 years old, she had a lens implant in her
right eye, which improved her vision so she could continue
crocheting granny squares. During the 2{ years that ended June
1989, Rust crocheted nearly 1,900 granny squares.
   During the past year, a book titled ``One Hundred over 100,''
was published and included an article about Rust. The author, Jim
Heynen, interviewed Rust when she was 106 years old.
   In the interview, she and Heynen played Scrabble and Rust won by
about 20 points. In the book, Heynen describes her as the kind of
person who will hoard the ``U'' letter squares when she knows her
opponent has the ``Q.''
   Scrabble, Anagrams and Aggravation have long been Rust's
favorite games. She also enjoys word puzzles and reading.
   Her hearing has deteriorated in the last few years, so she
doesn't visit with people as much as she used to. In past years,
McMeekin said Rust and her oldest daughter would reminisce for
hours.
   Rust was born June 18, 1881, in a sod house in Hainesville, Neb.
She and her husband were married in Butte, Neb., and they had 12
children. All but one are still living.
   Daughter Emma Nelson, of Norfolk, Neb., died in 1989 at age 77.
The other children range from age 87 to 65.
   Rust has 211 descendants. Besides her children, there are 36
grandchildren, 86 great-grandchildren, 74 great-great-grandchildren
and four great-great-great-grandchildren.

   Marion Barry and Charles Lewis agreed to cover
up their crack cocaine use at a Washington hotel when police began
closing in on them, Lewis testified today at the mayor's drug and
perjury trial.
   Lewis said that he and the mayor smoked crack cocaine together
in Lewis's hotel room on three nights in December 1988.
   Police were alerted after Lewis offered cocaine to a hotel maid.
Lewis said he found out about the subsequent police investigation
from a Washington Post reporter who came to his hotel room looking
for the mayor.
   Testifying for a second day at Barry's trial, Lewis described a
telephone conversation with the mayor immediately after finding out
about the police probe.
   ``It was ... like fixing a dam,'' said Lewis. ``We have a
problem. We need to fix it. We need to get our stories straight.''
   Lewis feared the telephone was bugged, so he and the mayor spoke
in code, Lewis said.
   ``I said ... `you didn't see any drugs, did you?,''' Lewis
testified.
   The mayor replied, ``No, none,'' Lewis testified.
   Just hours before, Barry had delivered a pipe for smokingays earlier,
Lewis testified, the mayor and Lewis smoked
crack in the hotel room while watching Monday Night Football. Barry
had sent Lewis $100 to buy crack by dispatching the mayor's
security guard with the money.
   The convicted drug dealer served time in prison after pleading
guilty to conspiring to distribute cocaine to Barry and others.
   On Tuesday, Lewis testified that Barry helped assemble a
makeshift crack pipe and used cocaine and marijuana repeatedly in
the Virgin Islands and Washington, D.C.
   ``How many packets (of crack) did you and Mr. Barry smoke during
his trip to the Virgin Islands'' in March 1988, Assistant U.S.
Attorney Judith Retchin asked Lewis as testimony opened Tuesday.
   ``I would say somewhere near two dozen packets,'' Lewis replied.
   ``Who smoked more, you or Mr. Barry?'' Retchin asked.
   ``The mayor did,'' said Lewis. ``He smoked more than I do.''
   Lewis is the government's chief witness against the District of
Columbia mayor, who watched closely and gave a tight-lipped smile
several times during the testimony.
   Lewis told a U.S. District Court jury that Barry came to his
Washington hotel room on Dec. 16, 1988, and dropped rocks of crack
cocaine from a matchbox onto a table.
   The mayor said that when he ``was in the Virgin Islands, I take
care of him; when I was in D.C. he takes care of me,'' said Lewis,
who was born in the islands.
   Barry is charged with 10 misdemeanor cocaine possession charges,
one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge and three felony counts
of lying to a grand jury about his alleged drug use.
   He could face up to 26 years in prison and fines of $1.85
million if convicted on all counts at the trial, which is expected
to last several weeks.
   Barry's wife, Effi, sat in the front row of U.S. District Court
during the day.
   In opening statements earlier Tuesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Richard Roberts opened the trial charging that the three-term mayor
was ``smoking crack and using cocaine all over town for years.''
   Defense attorney R. Kenneth Mundy countered that Barry was a
victim of entrapment. He said the trial would reveal ``the depths
to which the government was willing to go and did go'' to bring
down the mayor of the nation's capital.

override Bush's veto of the Hatch Act revisions; picks up 7th graf,

   Forget President Bush's reputation for caution
and compromise. He's been wielding his veto pen more frequently and
with more success than most recent presidents.
   The score stands at Bush 11, Congress zero. But lawmakers aren't
giving up; the House voted today by a more than 3-to-1 margin to
override Bush's veto of revisions to the Hatch Act easing
restrictions on political activities by federal workers.
   Ten of Bush's 11 vetoes were in his first year in office; by
contrast, Presidents Reagan and Carter only vetoed two measures
apiece in their first years, and were sustained in each of those
instances.
   ``We've been very lucky,'' Bush recently told a White House
audience. ``We may take one on the chin. ... But generally, the
Republican side has stayed together.''
   The Bush shutout has emboldened the White House to engage in
what some critics suggest is negotiation-by-veto-threat on a range
of bills.
   Veto No. 12, on the Hatch Act prohibition, could be the first to
be overridden by Congress if the Senate goes along with today's
327-93 House vote.
   No. 13 _ a threatened veto of bill Congress passed last week
requiring companies to give employees up to 12 weeks' unpaid leave
for family emergencies _ is waiting in the wings.
   No. 14 could be the Civil Rights Act of 1990, which Bush aides
say would lead to hiring quotas. And No. 15 could be the National
Affordable Housing Construction Act, which the administration
complains would spend too much on public housing.
   Aides to Reagan rarely talked publicly about a veto in advance.
Bush aides do it all the time.
   Some Bush aides suggest the veto threats themselves are behind
Bush's successful track record.
   Fred McClure, Bush's chief lobbyist in Congress, said that
vetoes ``are not something we do haphazardly. We sort of let
everybody know up front.''
   Over the course of his eight-year term, Reagan vetoed 78 bills
and was overridden nine times. In his four years, Carter vetoed 31
bills and was overridden twice.
   While outdistancing Reagan and Carter, Bush's brisk pace doesn't
come close to that of President Ford _ who vetoed 28 bills in his
first year and 66 in his 2{ years in office. In all, Ford was
overridden 12 times.
   But the all-time record goes to Franklin D. Roosevelt. From 1933
when he took office to his death in office in 1945, Roosevelt
vetoed 635 bills. Only nine were overridden.
   Richard Nixon, president from 1969 to 1974, vetoed 43 bills;
five were overridden. Lyndon Johnson, president from 1963-69,
vetoed 29 bills _ and none was overridden.
   Bush piled up his 11-0 record even though both chambers of
Congress are in the hands of opposition Democrats.
   When the House overwhelmingly voted to override Bush's veto last
winter of a bill to extend U.S. visas of Chinese students, the odds
seemed to be that the Senate would follow suit. But, after a heavy
lobbying campaign, the Senate upheld Bush's veto _ with three votes
to spare.
   Last week the Senate upheld Bush's Amtrak veto by a scant two
votes. ``We never said it would be by a landslide,'' said Chief of
Staff John Sununu.
   It requires a two-thirds vote in both chambers to override a
veto.
   In the 100-member Senate, where Republicans have more clout than
in the House, Bush needs 34 votes to sustain a veto.
   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., Bush's chief vote counter as minority
whip, said the hardest Bush veto to sustain may be the Hatch Act
revision, which passed both chambers by more than the requisite
two-thirds majorities needed to override.
   The vote was 334 to 87 in the House; 67 to 30 in the Senate.
   The bill would allow federal employees to participate in
partisan politics for the first time in more than a half-century.
Bush said it would lead to politicizing the federal work force.
   ``We have 33 votes and a pool of four to fish in,'' said Simpson.
   But, he was reminded by a reporter, Bush doesn't have much of a
reputation for catching fish.
   ``Oh, yes he has,'' Simpson said. ``He's got 11 vetoes that have
all been sustained. So I think he's probably very successful
fishing in the great congressional pool.''
   ``Now, Islamorada (Fla.) is a different matter,'' Simpson said
of one of the president's favorite fishing haunts.

   One of three outspoken government critics who
disappeared three weeks ago said Wednesday he spent the time
``vacationing'' under police supervision _ fishing, riding horses,
and even getting a sunburn.
   ``The whole thing is all really comical,'' Gao Xin said several
times, shaking his head and laughing. He said he was unable to
explain why he was allowed to return home Tuesday night after being
taken away by police the night of May 30.
   On May 31, Gao and two other dissidents had been scheduled to
hold a news conference announcing an open letter demanding freedom
for political prisoners. Gao was the second of the three to
resurface. He was brought home late Tuesday. Zhou Duo returned
Monday morning.
   The whereabouts of Hou Dejian, a well-known folk singer born in
Taiwan, remains unknown. Taiwan's official radio station reported
that Hou arrived in Taiwan on Wednesday but did not say whether he
had been expelled from China.
   Gao, 34, told The Associated Press in an interview in his home
in Beijing that he spent the past 20 days ``resting and having
fun'' in the outskirts of Beijing accompanied by several policemen.
   He said he had not seen Hou or Zhou since the day before the
planned news conference, and had no idea what had happened to them.
   The three were the only Chinese to continue publicly appealing
for democratic reform after last year's military crackdown on the
pro-democracy movement. With police permission, they separately
gave many interviews to foreign reporters about their activities
during the movement and their hopes for China's future.
   The three men and university lecturer Liu Xiaobo staged a hunger
strike in the final days of the massive pro-democracy movement to
protest the imposition of martial law in Beijing.
   When troops moved into Tiananmen Square on the night of June
3-4, the four negotiated with soldiers for safe passage from the
square for the protesting students.
   All except Hou were arrested soon after. Gao was released in
December, Zhou in May. Liu remains in prison without charge.
   In their open letter to Chinese leaders, the three asked
specifically for Liu's release. The news conference was to coincide
with the one-year anniversary of the day they decided to stage
their hunger strike, Gao said.
   The night before the news conference, uniformed police went to
Hou's home, where Gao was spending the night, and took the two men
away separately, Gao said.
   After questioning him through the night and most of the day
about the letter and the news conference, the police suggested he
leave Beijing until after the anniversary of the June military
crackdown passed, he said.
   ``They said it was best I not be around during this sensitive
period, and I couldn't refuse them,'' Gao said, adding that the
police made it clear that he was not being investigated or detained.
   ``They were very polite and treated me as an equal,'' he said.
``I wasn't beaten or mistreated in any way.''
   They took Gao to Miyun, a suburb about 50 miles outside Beijing
where he spent so much time outdoors that he got a bad sunburn.
   ``I learned to fish and to ride horses _ things I've never had
the chance to do before,'' Gao said.
   He said he was not watched very closely, had his own room, and
was allowed to read books and newspapers and to write letters.

   The House voted overwhelmingly today to
override President Bush's veto of legislation broadening the rights
of millions of federal workers to participate in political
campaigns.
   The 327-93 vote was well over the two-thirds majority needed to
override the veto. The House action sets up an expected showdown
Thursday in the Senate, where a close vote is expected.
   Bush vetoed the bill last Friday, saying it ``would inevitably
lead to repoliticizing the federal work force'' and destroy the
neutrality of civil servants fostered by the 1939 Hatch Act.
   The Democratic-controlled Congress has failed to override any of
Bush's previous 11 vetoes.
   The bill would remove prohibitions that make it illegal for an
estimated 3 million federal and postal workers to attend political
conventions as delegates or speak at rallies on behalf of
candidates.
   It would allow them for the first time to hold party offices and
solicit contributions from co-workers on behalf of federal employee
union political action committees while off the job.
   But it would continue to bar federal workers from taking leaves
of absence to run for public elected office or solicit campaign
funds from the public on behalf of candidates.
   ``Unlike all other workers or their neighbors for that matter,
federal workers cannot legally take part in the most routine
political activities, such as displaying yard signs or a bumper
sticker, or stuffing envelopes,'' said Rep. William Ford, D-Mich.,
one of the bill's chief sponsors.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., recalled that early in her
career she resigned a job as an attorney for the National Labor
Relations Board after learning that ``I could not go to a caucus
that my husband was holding in our living room.''
   Opponents, however, echoed Bush's suggestions in his veto
message that, without the current Hatch Act protections, federal
workers will be coerced into supporting candidates of one party or
the other.
   Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., said the United States has developed the
finest non-partisan and professional civil service in the world
with the help of the law.
   ``Times have changed but the facts that made the Hatch Act
necessary have not changed,'' said Wolf. ``Human nature has not
changed. Whatever is permitted will become expected.''
   The bill originally passed the Senate 67-30. Administration
officials were lobbying to win over enough Republicans who
supported the bill to sustain the veto.
   The heaviest pressure, according to congressional sources, was
being focused on Republican Sens. Pete Domenici of New Mexico,
Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Alfonse D'Amato of New York. All
supported passage of the bill in May.
   More than half of the House's 176 Republicans, including GOP
Leader Bob Michel of Illinois, bolted from the administration to
support the veto override.
   The original law was passed in response to evidence that
enrollees in job-creating public works programs of the New Deal era
were being required to donate to Democratic campaigns.

   More than 200 U.S. Roman Catholic
bishops are meeting here this week for a private retreat.
   The gathering at Jesuit-run Santa Clara University comes as
debate escalates over what tactics the National Conference of Roman
Catholic Bishops should use to persuade Catholic politicians to
fight abortion.
   The retreat, which begins Thursday and runs through June 27, is
billed as a week of prayer, reflection and workshops around the
topic of ``Bishop as Priest, Prophet and Leader.''
   The clergy also will have time for pool-side sunbathing, golf
and a Sunday picnic at a beach, organizers say.
   But it is likely that the recent controversy over abortion in
politics will come up in the private talks. Cardinal John O'Connor
of New York last week suggested in a church newspaper column that
Catholic politicians who promote abortion rights ``must be warned
that they are at risk of excommunication.'' He later said he never
threatened to excommunicate anyone.

   The nation's mayors wrapped up their annual
meeting today with a pledge to hold Washington accountable to city
voters and signs of potential discord among their ranks.
   The talk was of bipartisanship as the U.S. Conference of Mayors
installed Republicans in the organization's No. 1 and No. 3 posts.
   But in the middle is Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn, who made it
clear that he wanted the mayors to take an aggressive stance
against the Bush administration.
   ``This is the time to rock the boat,'' Flynn said.
   Colorado Springs Mayor Robert Isaac, the new president of the
conference, said he hoped to strike a more cooperative relationship
with the administration.
   ``We want to restore the partnership,'' he said.
   Democratic and Republican mayors alike said it was time for
mayors to use their local political organizations against members
of Congress who do not support cities.
   ``We're entitled to help from the federal government,'' said
Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson.
   The mayors began their meeting five days ago with high hopes of
drafting an urban agenda that counts on billions of dollars from
the federal government.
   But they since have received word from two influential members
of Congress that cities are unlikely to receive much, if any, of
the peace dividend expected from cuts in defense.
   That message angered the mayors, who view Washington as
increasingly indifferent to urban America's needs, and many vowed
to bypass the Congress and take their case to the people.
   At the center of the populist appeal is the argument that
Washington has ignored cities and their poor residents while doling
out billions to rescue the savings and loan industry.
   After a decade of being told that the budget deficit prevented
any new help for cities, the mayors point to the S&amp;L bailout as
proof Washington can find money when it has to.
   Now, the mayors say, they must improve their lobbying to make
their voices heard in Washington. Some mayors are threatening to
cause political trouble for members of Congress who do not go to
the mat for cities.
   ``It is hard for us at times to speak with one voice,'' said
Mayor Sharpe James of Newark, N.J. ``But the bigger problem is that
mayors have allowed the Congress to become fat cats, smug, secure,
assured of their positions. They're not fighting the real fights
anymore.''
   The meeting concluded with the formal endorsement of a broad new
domestic lobbying agenda that calls for major increases in federal
funding for housing, education, anti-drug, anti-poverty and other
urban programs.
   New York's David Dinkins and Flynn believe a populist appeal can
sway voters to support the mayors' agenda.
   ``We, the mayors of urban America, must send a message to
Washington that only after we have housed our people, only after we
have educated our young people, only after we have repaired our
roads, and only after we heal our sick can we commit to the
extravagant bailout of a corrupt system,'' Dinkins said Tuesday.
   ``Never underestimate the people,' said Flynn.
   One of the newer faces among the mayors, Milwaukee's John
Norquist, said the mayors and their organization share the blame
for the declining effectiveness in Washington.
   Too often, Norquist said, the mayors' appeals sound like
requests for handouts.
   ``Pity doesn't get you much,'' he said. ``Pity usually leads to
contempt.''

   A Canadian cruise ship has come up with a new
gimmick to attract passengers _ nude dancers.
   But U.S. officials say the Wayward Princess had better not live
up to its name. If it strays onto the U.S. side of the border, the
Princess could get busted.
   Canadian owner Jacques Beauchamp said sinking business led to
his venture, which will operate six nights a week on the Detroit
River between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, and in Lakes Erie and
St. Clair.
   ``Hey, it's going to be a fun thing to do, as long as the ship
remains a clean ship,'' Beauchamp said Tuesday.
   The ship, which will serve alcohol, will feature male and female
nude dancers on two different decks, said Beauchamp, 50, a Windsor
cruise operator for the past six years.
   The cruiser, which will charge a $5 cover when anchored and $10
on the water, will be equipped with shades so passing boaters can't
peep.
   If the Wayward Princess, licensed by Canada, crosses
international waters, Beauchamp could be fined or imprisoned under
Michigan's misdemeanor obscenity laws, said Police Officer Dan
Smith of the Detroit Harbormaster's Section.
   ``Heck, this is something new,'' Smith said. ``But he'd probably
be ticketed or arrested for indecent exposure.''
   Windsor's licensing commissioner, Ronald Reaume, said the
establishment met Ontario laws. ``Personally, I'd rather not see
it. But we're not there to license the morality of the situation.''
   Canadian police fought the licensing and said it will be
difficult to enforce laws and ensure security aboard the 110-foot,
325-capacity vessel.
   ``Is our boat going to follow Jacques Beauchamp's boat just
waiting for trouble to start?'' asked Windsor police Inspector
Glenn Stannard.
   Beauchamp said he intends to run a tight ship. ``They say the
first guy to start something could be very successful.''

   When the $21 million library
documenting the life of Richard M. Nixon opens next month, the 37th
chief executive will be flanked by ex-Presidents Reagan and Ford,
and President Bush.
   The gathering will mark the first time since Bush's 1988
election that the four Republicans have joined together.
   ``This will be a truly historic occasion,'' library director
Hugh Hewitt said in describing plans for the July 19 dedication
ceremony.
   Former first lady Pat Nixon will also make her first public
appearance in more than a decade, Hewitt said Tuesday during a
media tour. The Nixons celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary on
Thursday.
   The Richard M. Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace, 30 miles southeast of
Los Angeles, will be the first of two presidential libraries to
open in Southern California. Reagan's library is set for a February
opening in Simi Valley.
   The Nixon library, completed on schedule and under budget, rises
prominently in the hilly community among homes valued up to
$700,000.
   Unlike other presidential libraries, the 52,000-square-foot
Nixon library won't be operated with taxpayer dollars.
   The sterile confines of the library offer a nostalgic look at
Nixon, offering visitors paying $3.95 apiece a glimpse into the
life of a man many consider a primary architect of domestic and
world events.
   When visitors see the tiny home where Nixon was born, included
on the library grounds, they will gaze at the piano he took lessons
on as a child, the highchair he ate in as a baby and the bed on
which he was born.
   The house is a kit-style home built in 1912 by Nixon's father,
Frank.
   Other features of the Spanish-style library:
   _A 293-seat theater, where audiences will view the 28-minute
film ``Never Give Up: Richard Nixon in the Arena.''
   _An old television set showing Nixon's ``Checkers'' speech.
   _Monitors broadcasting the Nixon-John F. Kennedy television
debates from the 1960 presidential election.
   _A world leaders room with life-size statues of Charles De
Gaulle, Winston Churchill, Leonid Brezhnev and Nikita Khrushchev,
among others.
   _The Domestic Gifts Room, showing some of the 30,000 items given
the Nixons while they were in the White House. Included in the
exhibit are Irving Berlin's original score of ``God Bless America''
and a pistol given Nixon by Elvis Presley.
   _The Watergate Hall, the second-largest display on the tour,
including the Watergate tapes with such selections as John Dean's
``cancer in the White House'' declaration. ``The president has
never shied away from a full and fair treatment of Watergate,''
Hewitt said.
   Nixon, who lives in Upper Saddle River, N.J., resigned the
presidency Aug. 9, 1974, after revelations about his role in a
botched burglary at Democratic headquarters at Washington's
Watergate building during his 1972 re-election campaign.

<HEAD>Fed Banks See Sluggish Growth, Flat Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy is continuing to grow
sluggishly although the construction sector appears to be
weakening, according to a Federal Reserve survey released Wednesday.
   ``The tone of district reports suggests continued slow growth in
the economy with little change in the underlying inflation rate,''
said a summary of the survey of the 12 Fed district banks.
   The survey, completed June 8, was similar to three polls
conducted earlier this year that found slow but continued economic
expansion with moderate inflation.
   It was conducted by the Cleveland district bank for use at the
July 2-3 meeting of the central bank's Federal Open Market
Committee, which establishes U.S. monetary policy.
   The Fed has kept a tight grip on credit to slow the economy and
lessen inflationary pressure. Some officials and economists believe
the economy has slowed too much and could slide into recession if
the Fed does not loosen its grip.
   One sign of sluggishness, the survey found, was ``very little
growth, if not a decline, in real consumer spending for durable and
non-durable goods this quarter from last.''
   Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's
economic activity and has been a driving force for the economy for
much of the last eight years since the last recession.
   ``Recent behavior in retail sales and reports from retailers in
several districts indicate that sales have been slow in recent
months and are expected to remain so in the short term,'' the
summary said.
   Retail sales, about half of consumer spending, fell in May for
the third consecutive month, the Commerce Department reported last
week. The last time retail sales declined for three straight months
was in the fall of 1981, during the last recession.
   The Fed said it was unclear how much unusual weather and other
temporary factors contributed to the sales softness.
   ``Both residential and non-residential construction have been
edging downward in recent months in most districts and indicators
of future construction suggest further softening,'' the survey
found.
   ``An underlying problem in commercial construction is an
apparent excess supply of new office space in many parts of the
country,'' particularly downtown Manhattan and in metropolitan
areas of the Dallas district, the report said.
   Credit demand appears to be easing, but real estate, consumer
and business loans are still growing, although at reduced rates, it
said.
   ``Lenders are reported to have tightened standards especially
for real estate loans, but there is still little information that
suggests credit restraint is spreading to other markets,'' the
survey found.
   It reported that manufacturing production has been relatively
flat for several months. This sector has been particularly affected
by the Fed's high-interest rate policies since many of its products
are purchased with loans.
   However, several districts reported they expect manufacturing to
strengthen despite softness in some industries including defense,
building construction machinery and apparel.
   Automobile and related industries have been a drag on
manufacturing in the Atlanta district, but Chicago and Cleveland
respondents noted some strengthening in production that should add
to total output this quarter and perhaps next.
   ``In contrast, the aerospace industry is a source of strength in
several regions of the country (Boston, Minneapolis and San
Francisco) and the energy sector is expanding (Dallas and Kansas
City),'' it added.
   The survey found indications of continued growth in capital
goods industries, another area of strength in recent months.
   ``Prospects for a good harvest this year should be improved as a
result of ample rainfall in previously drought-stricken regions of
the country,'' the survey found, ``but cool, wet weather has
delayed planting by as much as several weeks.''

   Nelson Mandela's delayed
arrival in the United States on Wednesday for lack of rest was not
surprising considering the grueling schedule he has kept since
being released from prison.
   The 71-year-old African National Congress leader is on his third
international tour in four months. Between trips, he has kept up a
non-stop routine of meetings with colleagues and opponents in South
Africa and criss-crossed the country, appearing at rallies in every
major city.
   Before leaving June 4 on the current six-week, 14-nation tour,
Mandela spent a week in the hospital, getting rest as well as a
check-up. During an extensive physical examination, a cyst was
discovered on his bladder and he underwent an operation seven days
before boarding the plane.
   As a former amateur heavyweight boxer, Mandela prides himself on
being in exceptional physical condition for his age, and he worked
hard at staying in shape during the 27 years he spent jailed for
his action against South Africa's government.
   But many of those years were spent at hard labor with inadequate
diet. Black prisoners were given one thin blanket and forced to
wear short pants through much of the winter during Mandela's first
years at Robben Island prison.
   ``I feel on top of the world,'' Mandela said at a June 2
hospital news conference. Journalists, however, said he looked
tired.
   From the moment he stepped through the prison gates Feb. 11,
Mandela has kept a schedule that leaves little time for rest.
   After a motorcade from the prison to the center of Cape Town, he
waited hours to give his first speech from a balcony at City Hall.
The next day he subjected himself to a lengthy international news
conference and hours of meetings with ANC organizers and leaders.
   On Feb. 13, he flew to Johannesburg and presented himself to
more than 100,000 people at a rally in Soweto, the black township
outside Johannesburg.
   He wanted to go home to live in the tiny brick house he had
rented in the township for 40 years. But after weeks of constant
attention from neighbors, tourists, and journalists peering over
his back wall, he moved into a hilltop mansion that his wife,
Winnie, built in 1987.
   Still, Mandela has seldom had time alone with his family. He is
constantly surrounded by bodyguards, aides and ANC officials.
   From Feb. 14 to 23, Mandela participated in all-day meetings
with journalists, diplomats, churchmen, old friends and new
anti-apartheid officials. He sat in his garden or his house and
greeted visitors from morning until late at night for 10 days
straight.
   On Feb. 25 he flew halfway across South Africa to address more
than 100,000 people in sweltering Durban, then returned to
Bloemfontein for an afternoon rally.
   Two days later, he made his first international tour since 1962,
visiting exiled ANC members and holding talks with leaders in five
African countries and in Sweden. He was elected to his old post as
deputy president of the ANC and returned home with the added duties
and expectations the title brought.
   The non-stop interviews and briefings continued until March 12,
when the ANC announced that meetings with Mandela would be granted
on a more selective basis.
   He flew to Namibia for the neighboring country's independence
celebrations on March 21. He apologized to the U.S. and Soviet
foreign ministers for making them come to him to talk because his
schedule was so tight.
   Back in South Africa, he attended rallies March 23 and 26;
visited hospitalized black marchers wounded by police March 28; and
participated in two rallies at opposite ends of the country on
March 29 and April 1.
   After three more rallies in three cities, Mandela met with
President F.W. de Klerk in Cape Town on April 5, and then flew to
Lusaka, Zambia, to consult with the ANC National Executive
Committee on April 8.
   On April 11, he gave a news conference in Johannesburg; on April
14 flew to London for a concert in his honor; and on April 17
attended Zimbabwe's independence celebrations. He returned to
Johannesburg April 21, and the next day flew to his homeland,
Transkei, for visits with relatives _ and two more rallies.
   From May 2-4, Mandela led the African National Congress in talks
with the government in Cape Town. During May, he made another tour
of African nations, held three news conferences and three more
rallies before entering the hospital.

<HEAD>Honecker, in Rare Statement, Denies His Government Harbored
Terrorists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former East German leader Erich Honecker
denied Wednesday that his government harbored terrorists and blamed
the charges on a campaign against the ``good reputation'' of his
regime.
   The 77-year-old Honecker, in a rare public statement, defended
what he said was his Communist government's pursuit of peace and
battle against terrorism.
   ``Nothing in these accusations corresponds to reality,''
Honecker said in a statement released through the East German
government news agency, ADN.
   His denial came after authorities arrested nine reputed members
of the notorious Red Army Faction, a leftist group blamed for a
series of bombings and killings in West Germany.
   All the suspects had phony identities and some said they were
aided by members of Honecker's secret police. Some had been
fugitives more than a decade.
   All were arrested during a two-week stretch beginning June 6
after West German authorities and East Germany's current democratic
government launched a hunt for terrorist suspects.
   Honecker's comments were the latest entry in the furious debate
over the terrorist ties of the old regime and the sinister
espionage war between two nations about to unify.
   Western authorities have long alleged the East German government
harbored, supported and perhaps trained terrorists.
   The West German newspaper Die Welt said Wednesday that East
Germany's secret police knew in advance and ``tolerated'' a 1986
bomb attack on a West German disco by Libyan terrorists. Two U.S.
soldiers and a Turkish woman were killed and 229 people were
injured.
   Honecker defended his Stalinist government, which used the vast
secret police network to maintain his iron-fisted rule for nearly
two decades until it was toppled in October during the peaceful
anti-Communist revolution.
   ``With the current campaign, apparently the good reputation of
the (German Democratic Republic) as a stronghold of peace and the
easing of tensions in the world is being undermined,'' the
statement said.
   He said the campaign seeks to ``negate the peaceful relations
between the German states'' that Honecker said he championed.
   East German Interior Minister Peter-Michael Diestel said Monday
that harboring West German terrorists was the ``personal hobby'' of
Honecker and his ousted security chief, Erich Mielke.
   The Red Army Faction waged a deadly terrorist war against West
German capitalism and NATO in the 1970s and 1980s. The most recent
victim, Deutsche Bank chief Alfred Herrhausen, was killed in a
bombing attack in November.
   ``Like every other citizen, I have followed the arrests of the
terrorists and their supporters in the press, radio and
television,'' Honecker's statement said.
   ``As former chief of state of the (German Democratic Republic) I
would like to declare before the German and international public
that I and the former (Communist) party and state leadership of the
GDR sharply condemned every form of terrorism on political and
humanitarian grounds, and also took part in the struggle against
international terrorism.''
   Honecker is in failing health and living in a hospital in the
town of Beelitz.
   Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere, meanwhile, chided West German
politicians for demanding that Honecker and other members of his
government be extradited to West Germany to face charges allegedly
committed during Honecker's leadership.
   He said anything that happened during Honecker's regime ``must
be cleared up here and not elsewhere.''
   ``We are still two sovereign states,'' he said in an interview
Wednesday with the West German newspaper Bild.
   The two German states are to merge their economies July 2 and
perhaps unify fully by year's end. But questions remain to be
worked out over the vast differences in the legal systems of two
countries.
   East Germany has turned down West German extradition requests
for captured terrorists suspects in an apparent tiff over
jurisdiction, and it remains unclear where they will be prosecuted.

   ``L.A. Law'' star Richard Dysart
believes everybody should be treated equally by the law, and he has
filmed two TV spots for the Oregon State Bar Association to say so.
   Dysart, who plays senior partner Leland McKenzie on the NBC-TV
series, was in Lake Oswego on Tuesday filming the pubic service
announcements.
   ``All of us, rich and poor, should receive fair treatment under
the law,'' he says in one.
   In an interview, Dysart said the justice system is ``so complex
that everyday I think thousands of people give up.'' Dysart said he
thinks the public announcements will let people know what is
available for them.
   ``You're telling somebody that justice is equal, and if they
don't have money ... there is assistance,'' he said.
   The bar's Tel-Law program is a collection of recorded legal
information messages prepared by lawyers. Each message is three to
nine minutes long and provides basic information about a wide range
of topics, including taxes, insurance and family law.

   Sen. Strom Thurmond wants a $25 refund _
even if the money might be water over the dam.
   The 87-year-old Republican from South Carolina has requested a
refund for a water deposit he paid in 1938 to the town of Lexington
for some property he sold last year.
   The senator's staff mailed a letter, including the original
receipt for the deposit, to the Lexington County treasurer seeking
a $25 refund.
   The letter arrived last week, Mayor Eli Mack said Tuesday.
Lexington is a town of 3,000, 13 miles west of Columbia.
   ``I was real amused, How in the hell can anyone save a receipt
for 52 years,'' Mack said. ``This is the first request to go back
that many years. I think it's rather cute.''
   Thurmond, whose net worth is more than $2 million, believes he
is entitled to the $25 because he sold the property, said his
spokeswoman, Pam Montgomery.
   ``He needs money like anyone else,'' she said.
   Mack said Thurmond will have to live without the $25. Water
deposits cannot be refunded, he said.

   Former President Carter was met by protesters
when he arrived at a low-income neighborhood to help build seven
homes for impoverished families.
   About a dozen pickets who spoke to Carter before he and his
wife, Rosalynn, started working on the project Tuesday objected to
the number of homes that will be built on the 1{-acre site in
southeast San Diego.
   About 200 volunteers are working on the project, which several
neighborhood residents tried to stop in court because they believe
the new homes would increase traffic congestion and lower property
values. A Superior Court judge last week declined to grant an
injunction that would have stopped the project.
   Carter said he was sympathetic to the residents' concerns, but
added that he believes the project is worthwhile.
   ``I think that within a few months these concerns ... will be
over and gone and forgotten,'' Carter said. ``They will find that
they have seven wonderful new neighbor families and the community
will accept them.''
   Habitat for Humanity, based in Americus, Ga., has sponsored
projects in more than 600 communities in 30 countries. The Carters
have been involved in the organization since 1982.

   A boy died when he was thrown from a truck that
was rammed at least eight times on three highways by another pickup
during a terrifying 25-mile chase, police said Wednesday.
   Brandon Caldwell, 7, died after his 26-year-old uncle, Jeffrey
Smith, lost control of the vehicle south of Dallas.
   Mark Dee Pluff, 31, of Dallas, has been charged with murder,
attempted murder and driving while intoxicated, Police Sgt. Jim
Chandler said.
   Police have no determined why Pluff, driving a pickup, rammed
Smith's pickup twice on Interstate 635 north of Dallas about
midnight.
   ``Smith decided that he was going to try to outrun the suspect''
and he started traveling southbound on Interstate 35, where Pluff
rammed him at least three more times, Chandler said.
   Smith got to Interstate 30, where Pluff rammed the truck another
three times. The last time, Smith lost control and the truck ran
down an embankment, Chandler said.
   ``Brandon was thrown from the vehicle as it was rolling down the
embankment,'' Chandler said.
   The boy was pronounced dead about 40 minutes later at Baylor
University Medical Center, where Smith was listed in critical
condition.
   Pluff remained at the accident scene and was arrested. He was
taken to the Lew Sterrett Justice Center.
   Chandler said there was no indication that Pluff knew the
victims or that Smith did anything that set Pluff off.
   Smith told police: ``If anything did occur, it was strictly an
unintentional act.''

<HEAD>Police Use Water Cannon on Striking Workers</HEAD>

   Police used a water cannon to
disperse hundreds of striking municipal workers Wednesday after
chasing them down the street and ordering them repeatedly to end
their illegal gathering.
   The approximately 400 workers were outside the Cape Town Civic
Center when they were ordered to leave by police. They have been on
strike for eight days, demanding higher pay.
   The water fired by police was mixed with a chemical substance
that affects the eyes and skin.
   The South African Municipal Workers Union wildcat strike had
been declared illegal by the Supreme Court. Earlier, 56 municipal
workers were arrested by police outside the court, where a judge
was considering whether to bar them from the Civic Center. Strikers
staged a sit-in at the center earlier this week.
   The judge's decision was postponed until Thursday.
   In Johannesburg, meanwhile, 27 union leaders refused to leave
the Department of Manpower regional offices they have occupied
since Tuesday. The workers, affiliated with the Congress of South
African Trade Unions and the National Council of Trade Unions, are
demanding that the government introduce changes in the labor law
before Parliament closes Friday. They want clauses in the
controversial Labor Relations Act removed or amended.
   The Labor Relations Act has been the subject of a number of work
stoppages, protests and union-initiated consumer boycotts in the
past two years.
   Unions claim it undermines their ability to strike.
   The union groups and major employer organizations agreed Monday
that it was possible to resolve conflict ``through discussion and
compromise.''
   The agreement was sent to Minister of Manpower Eli Louw with a
request that he put the changes into legislation before Friday.
   ``We intend to embark on a program that will cause major chaos
in the economy. This is an acid test of government's commitment to
negotiations, a test of their good faith,'' said Jay Naidoo,
general-secretary of the nation's largest labor federation, the
Congress of South African Trade Unions.
   The African National Congress National Executive Committee is
meeting for the first time in 30 years in South Africa. The
committee began a two-day meeting in Johannesburg Wednesday in
which it was expected to discuss the ANC's position on the process
of negotiations.
   ANC official Chris Hani said the organization's armed struggle
would continue, but it wished to contribute to a climate for a
peaceful settlement.
   ``None of us want to destroy South Africa _ we don't like
violence. I believe President (F.W.) de Klerk doesn't like
violence. But we believe that together we must sit down and create
a situation where we can say goodbye to violence,'' he said.

<HEAD>Maine Man in Hot Water After Landing Huge Sturgeon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOUTH BERWICK, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who caught an Atlantic
sturgeon roughly the size of basketball great Wilt Chamberlain had
the fish seized by the state, and could be sentenced to a year in
prison and fined $1,000.
   Roy Mann, who started out thinking Monday was his lucky day,
ended up charged with fishing without a commercial license and
illegally setting a net.
   Wildlife officials are also burned up because the sturgeon was
pregnant and lots of babies were lost.
   Mann, 24, of South Berwick, caught the 300-pound sturgeon in the
Salmon Fall River, which is overseen jointly by Maine and New
Hampshire. He described the fish as the ``catch of the day, the
year, the century.''
   But his bragging caught the ear of local officials. They
arrested him and called in the Maine Marine Patrol, who seized the
fish.
   ``I'm not happy at all,'' said Jonathan Wright, New Hampshire
Fish and Game Department Warden. ``A lot of potential sturgeons are
dead.''
   The big fish contained more than 30 pounds of eggs, officials
said.
   Mann, undaunted by getting caught himself, continued to tell his
big fish story.
   ``I started tugging. I thought it was a snapping turtle or a
good-sized fish,'' he said.
   Mann said he had to borrow a rope from a nearby sewage treatment
plant to pull the ``giant monster'' in and then hit it in the head
with a hammer to kill it.
   The fish at 7-feet-8-inches, was 6 inches longer than
Chamberlain, and outweighed him by 25 pounds during the basketball
star's playing prime.
   Louis Flagg, the division director of the Maine Department of
Marine Resources, said the fish was big by sturgeon standards,
although they have been known to grow to 12 to 14 feet and weigh
1,000 pounds.

<HEAD>Rock Star Stevie Nicks Wants to Adopt Baby</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 15 years on the road with the tumultuous
group Fleetwood Mac, singer Stevie Nicks says she has one regret:
not having a baby.
   ``I'd like to be sharing all these experiences, and that makes
me really sad. But I figure God has a plan, and if I'm meant to
have that baby, I'll have her. Or him. And, if I'm meant to adopt
one, I'll adopt it,'' Nicks, 42, says in the July 9 issue of US
magazine.
   Her 15 years with Fleetwood Mac has been a fun-filled romp that
had her romantically linked to numerous rocks stars _ including
ex-Eagles member Don Henley. One rock star she wouldn't identify
once summoned her to his side by sending a private jet to pick her
up after one of Fleetwood Mac's concerts.
   ``I didn't join Fleetwood Mac until I was 27, and I never
indulged in drugs of any kind, nothing. I didn't even drink,'' she
said. ``And then all of a sudden, bang! Overnight I was in this
gargantuan rock and roll band, of which half the members were
English and used to spending at least three hours a day at the
pub.''
   ``You know at my age, what I've been through, I should look 65
years old. I feel like I look pretty good. And, uh, the excessive
part of it no long exists in my life, and hasn't for four years.''

<HEAD>Carter's Too Busy Helping Out to Collect Award</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Carter was a no-show
Wednesday when awards for public service were handed out. He was
busy in Mexico helping build homes for poor people.
   ``I suppose that's as good a reason not to be at this little
gathering as one could have,'' said Jody Powell, who was Carter's
White House press secretary.
   Powell, in a ceremony at the Supreme Court, accepted in Carter's
behalf the American Institute for Public Service's Jefferson Award
for the former president's efforts for ``world peace, free
elections in Nicaragua, and the needs of the homeless.''
   National awards were also presented to:
   _Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
``for helping restore democracy in Panama, and for strengthening
America's image around the world.''
   _Jaime Escalante, the Los Angeles high school mathematics
teacher whose work with disadvantaged students was celebrated in a
movie, ``for his special ability to inspire students to achieve
national excellence.''
   _Anne Donahue, executive director of Covenant House in
California, ``for her tireless efforts in behalf of the homeless.''
   Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, were in Tijuana, Mexico, where
they were due on the job at 7 a.m., after spending the night in a
tent, to work on a house being built by Habitat for Humanity.
   They have donated a week of their time to such work every year
since 1984, four years after Carter, seeking a second term, was
defeated by Ronald Reagan.
   Habitat for Humanity, a nonprofit Christian-oriented enterprise
based in Americus, Ga., constructs housing for the poor and
homeless in the United States and abroad. Recipients make
interest-free mortgage payments.
   The Carters arrived Sunday in Tijuana, where Habitat is building
100 homes. They spent Tuesday in nearby San Diego, Calif., where
the organization is building seven houses.
   ``President Carter is a skilled carpenter, so he does everything
from roofing to putting up dry wall to whatever is required,''
Lloyd Mayer, press officer of the organization, said by telephone
from Americus. ``And Rosalynn has become pretty adept at carpentry
herself.''
   Trip Pomeroy, Habitat's coordinator of public relations in San
Diego, said by telephone that 1,220 construction volunteers were
working on the San Diego and Tijuana projects. The Carters will
take part in dedication of the houses on Saturday.
   ``On each site they have been assigned, like every other
volunteer, to a particular crew and a particular house,'' said
Pomeroy. ``They work extremely hard as a matter of fact.''
   The former president and first lady worked on similar projects
in New York in 1984 and 1985, Chicago in 1986, Charlotte, N.C., in
1987, Pittsburgh and Atlanta in 1988 and Milwaukee in 1989.
   Baseball Hall of Fame star Hank Aaron, a member of the
institute's board of selectors, made the presentation to Carter,
citing among other things his work for the housing group and the
conflict resolution program at his Carter Center in Atlanta.
   ``Because of him, world leaders are talking to each other,''
Aaron said. ``Because of him, there are a few less homeless people
in the world.''
   The ceremony was held before a standing room only audience in
the court's East Conference Room, lighted by crystal chandeliers
and lined with portraits of past chief justices. Justice Byron
White congratulated the winners.

<HEAD>Newest Nation Wants One-Time Grants, Not Loans, to Build Economy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's newest nation, Namibia,
joins the queue of the world's poorest countries Thursday in asking
prospective donor countries for start-up financing to build a new
economy.
   Namibia approaches the U.N.-sponsored donors' conference in New
York as a bad candidate for international aid, not because it is
too poor but because, on the surface, it appears rich.
   Grants, not loans, will be the theme of Namibia's plea.
President Sam Nujoma and other government officials want to
redirect social spending toward the vast majority of poor people
without borrowing huge amounts of foreign money.
   They want one-time grants to use as start-up funds for
self-generated development of their country, which became
independent from South Africa on March 21.
   With only 1.3 million people in a country almost as large as
western Europe, Namibia has an annual per capita income of $1,200,
making it the richest country in sub-Saharan Africa.
   But the majority of Namibia's people live in poverty, and 5
percent _ the whites _ have most of the wealth.
   Namibia has the highest number of tarred roads per capita in the
world, and the best ratio of hospital beds per person in Africa.
Water is clean in most places, the telephones work, and its public
administration is on par with the developed world.
   It's constitution had been praised by leaders throughout the
world as one of the most democratic documents ever devised, and its
government and people are _ at least for the present _ committed to
a multi-party democracy and a mixed economy.
   The United Nations, which shepherded Namibia to independence by
supervising its elections last year, and the World Bank have said
the fledgling nation has the potential to become a model for peace
and prosperity in Africa.
   But illiteracy stands at 60 percent. Housing is scares, teachers
are underqualified, and aside from commercial farmland, the rural
areas are virtually undeveloped.
   Thirty percent of the population is unemployed. Armed
ex-soldiers of the former colonial army and the guerrilla forces of
the now-ruling party are posing an increasing threat to civil order.
   The new government says it is under severe pressure to ``address
the equity problem at an acceptable pace to the hitherto
disenfranchised and neglected majority without jeopardizing
growth'' or further neglecting its highly developed infrastructure.
   Independence itself has brought new expenditures, such as United
Nations membership fees, embassies and the creation of a central
bank and new currency by 1992.
   The government also faces a severe inherited fiscal problem. To
serve its white constituency, the South African government created
an excessively overstaffed public administration. It financed the
wage bill and public debt through higher taxes. That was at the
expense of public investment, which has steadily shrunk to minimal
levels over the past decade and is partly responsible for the
current depressed economy.
   The Namibian government, together with the World Bank and the
United Nations Development Program, have devised a one-time
investment program consisting of 83 individual priority projects
totalling $400 million to set the stage for future self-sustained
development.
   The World Bank has recommended that most of the aid be given as
direct grants, so as not to give the new country a foreign debt
problem at its birth.
   But direct grants are normally allocated only to the world's
least developed nations, and so far, Namibia has failed to qualify
as one of those.

   A small group of environmentalists and
labor activists picketed today outside a logging mill, kicking off
a series of ``Redwood Summer'' protests against the cutting of
California's grand redwoods.
   About 35 to 40 environmentalists and members of the
International Workers of the World gathered at the Louisiana
Pacific plant's front gate to protest clear-cut logging and
exportation of logs to Mexico for cheaper processing.
   ``I feel strongly about this. I came up here to make a strong
statement that I support the environment,'' said one picket, David
Solnit, 26, a carpenter from San Francisco, 220 miles to the south.
   There was one pro-company demonstrator, Duane Plant of Eureka,
who was carrying a sign that read, ``Say No to Terrorist. Stop
Earth First!''
   ``They scare me,'' Plant said. ``I am afraid of getting hurt. I
am afraid of my kids getting hurt. I can't believe they're not
violent.''
   The picketing was to be followed by rallies in this tiny coastal
community near Eureka. The events are part of a Redwood Summer
series of protests planned for Northern California by the group
Earth First!
   Environmentalists say the protests were inspired by the Freedom
Summer of 1964, when civil rights activists converged on
Mississippi.
   Mainstream environmental groups have distanced themselves from
the demonstrations; the Sierra Club has refused to endorse the
plans and the Wilderness Society has denounced them.
   Both timber industry and environmental sources refused to
estimate how many protesters would participate.
   ``There will be rallies, there will be a labor picket line in
the morning, there may be some civil disobedience,'' said Mickey
Dulas, spokeswoman for the Northcoast Environmental Center in
Arcata. ``But we are committed to non-violence.''
   The protests have raised tensions along the state's rugged North
Coast, where the economy is based largely on timber and tourism.
   Tensions were heightened by a May 24 bomb blast in Oakland that
injured Earth First! leaders Judi Bari and Darryl Cherney in a car.
   It has not been determined whether they were victims of a bomber
or were transporting the explosive when it went off.

<HEAD>East German Church Determined to Recover Lost Treasures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>QUEDLINBURG, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Friedemann Gosslau
said his heart soared when he heard that medieval artworks
belonging to his church are believed to be in a Texas bank.
   He has complete faith priceless objects that disappeared in 1945
at the end of World War II will be found and restored to his
500-member parish and Quedlinburg's 12th-century cathedral.
   ``We must defend the interests of the church. When the pieces
are here again, we will show them, but this time we'll need help
with security,'' Gosslau said with a smile.
   The treasures, among Germany's most famous artworks, are the
subjects of an international struggle. The Lutheran church in
Quedlinburg has filed suit in Texas to try to recover a collection
that includes a silver, ivory and gold reliquary from the 9th or
10th century, a 10th-century Byzantine rock-crystal flask with
sides shaped like birds, and an ivory comb inlaid with precious
stones.
   It is believed the works were taken to Whitewright, Texas by the
late Joe T. Meador, a former Army lieutenant who served in
Quedlinburg in 1945.
   During the war, the objects were removed from the Romanesque
cathedral to a mine shaft to keep them safe from Allied bombing.
They disappeared in 1945.
   Gosslau came to Quedlinburg 25 years ago and learned about the
missing works by studying cathedral archives.
   ``I thought maybe we'd find traces and then convince the people
to give the pieces back peacefully. I dreamed of it, but I never
counted on it,'' Gosslau said in an interview in his home.
   The Lutheran minister said it was always thought the missing
pieces could have been taken by ordinary Germans during the chaotic
end of the Third Reich; by Nazi SS forces who seized the cathedral
at the start of the war; or by the American soldiers who occupied
the town.
   Then in May there was news that a private West German foundation
that searches for stolen artworks had recovered a 9th-century
illuminated manuscript of the Four Gospels.
   ``We had no idea where it was. It's fantastic news and it's sure
it comes from the church because it is described in the
inventory,'' Gosslau said.
   A second illuminated manuscript also noted in church archives
was recovered in June. Full details of how those works were
recovered have not been made public and they have not been returned
to the church.
   A federal judge Tuesday ordered the First National Bank of
Whitewright to open its vault for inventory by the cathedral.
   ``We were proud of what we have, and about what we didn't have
anymore,'' Gosslau said. ``The cathedral treasure is small, but it
is exquisite.''
   He would like any pieces found in Texas to join the rest of the
treasure that is kept in glass cases in the cool stone vault
constructed in the Middle Ages to hold the priceless objects.
   The part of the collection still in Quedlinburg is a dazzling
display that includes a Syrian vase brought back by crusaders, a
4th-century translation of the Bible, and a 13th-century
gem-encrusted illimunated manuscript.
   In the Middle Ages, the vault guard was a nun trained to watch
over the works, which were used in services that the royal family
attended.
   Tourists taking the cathedral's guided tour are allowed to look
at the treasure vault, a small room with tiny windows at the top of
a staircase on the edge of the nave.
   During a tour this week, the guide did not mention the lost
treasures. Nor were they mentioned in the small guidebook to the
church on sale at the entrance.
   The town had no chance to seek recovery of the lost valuables
once it became part of East Germany in 1949. Contact was limited
until the country's former Communist leaders opened the country's
borders last year.
   ``We knew the crates were broken into and some things taken
away. But we didn't know where they went,'' said Walter Gold, the
city's cultural adviser.
   ``Because the world was divided, we had no contact with the West
so we couldn't do anything about it.''
   The remains of Heinrich I, Germany's first king, and his wife
Mathilde are buried inside the cathedral. Heinrich I died in 936.
   While the cathedral is still state property, Gosslau maintains
that according to old laws the treasure belongs to the parish and
should be returned to the vault.

<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela, a freedom fighter who became one
of the world's most celebrated political prisoners, arrived in the
United States today looking for money and moral support for his
battle against apartheid.
   Mandela, accompanied by his wife Winnie, waved to a cheering
crowd as he stepped off an airplane at John F. Kennedy
International Airport. They stopped at a Brooklyn high school
before a ticker-tape parade up Broadway to City Hall.
   During a welcoming ceremony, the African National Congress
leader called for a continuation of economic sanctions against his
homeland and offered a word of thanks to his American supporters.
   ``The sanctions should be maintained,'' Mandela said. ``We are
saying so because sanctions were introduced for the purpose of
dismantling apartheid, and are making sure that every South African
_ black and white _ is able to determine his own future.''
   New York City is the first stop of Mandela's 12-day, eight-city
U.S. tour.
   He was greeted by his daughter, Zenani; Gov. Mario Cuomo, the
Rev. Jesse Jackson; Mayor David Dinkins; entertainer Harry
Belafonte; and hundreds of supporters and well-wishers.
   ``It is a great privilege for me to welcome you and Mrs.
Mandela. You honor us with your presence,'' Cuomo told Mandela.
   Mandela and his wife were given scarves in the ANC colors of
black, green and gold, which they put around their necks.
   ``I sincerely feel very strong and encouraged, because if in our
struggle we receive the support of the youth of the world, then our
cause can never fail, can never be lost,'' Mandela told the 10,000
packed into the high school's football field.
   Mandela rode along the parade route in what police called the
Mandelamobile, a flatbed truck with a bulletproof box on the back.
Thousands of police and federal and state agents protected him.
   Mandela's arrival in New York was pushed back nearly two hours
because trip organizers said the 71-year-old leader needed more
rest. Some private meetings scheduled for tonight were also
canceled.
   Mandela is in the midst of a six-week tour of 14 nations in
Africa, Europe and North America that began June 6 _ one day after
he was discharged from a Johannesburg hospital after surgery to
remove a cyst from his bladder.
   Along with the festivities celebrating the end of Mandela's
27-year imprisonment in South Africa will be meetings with
business, religious and political leaders. Mandela, making his
first U.S. visit, is scheduled to speak at the United Nations and
meet in Washington with President Bush.
   His message: keep the economic sanctions and international
pressure in place until the white South African government gives up
its monopoly on power and ends all vestiges of racial segregation.
   Mandela's release from prison Feb. 11 was part of a program of
social reforms by the government of President F.W. de Klerk that
included legalizing the ANC and other anti-apartheid groups.
   De Klerk also has opened talks with black groups on giving a
political voice to the country's 28 million blacks. South Africa's
5 million whites control the government and economy.
   In Canada on Tuesday, Mandela appealed to students at a Toronto
high school to raise funds to help black youth in his South African
homeland. He said they get an education ``far inferior to whites,''
and that those who have spoken out ``have have been crushed with
force'' by the white-minority government.
   On the eve of his arrival, about 100 protesters gathered at the
mayor's official residence to condemn Mandela's pro-Palestinian
comments.
   But the protest leader, Rabbi Avi Weiss, tempered his criticism
with kind words for Mandela's anti-apartheid leadership.
   Another controversy surrounded the concert and rally Thursday at
city-owned Yankee Stadium. Tickets to the fund-raiser for the ANC
were $5 to $500.
   Rock promoter Bill Graham pulled out as organizer, citing
disagreements with city officials. Tour organizers, in turn, blamed
Graham for poor ticket sales. About 20,000 of 45,000 tickets had
been sold by late Tuesday.
   Also planned were a street rally in Harlem on Thursday,
breakfast with business leaders Friday at the World Trade Center
and a $2,500-a-person fund-raiser Friday night, catered by actor
Robert De Niro's restaurant.
   Mandela leaves Saturday for Boston. The trip continues with
stops in Washington, Atlanta, Miami, Detroit, Los Angeles and
Oakland, Calif. He leaves the United States on July 1.

   Allen James Roughton entered the
world in a big way.
   He tipped the scales at 14 pounds, 3 ounces after being
delivered by Caesarean section at Queen of the Valley Hospital at
11:40 a.m. Tuesday.
   Allen was far less than the 22-pound babies listed in the
Guinness Book of World Records, but ``he's the largest I've ever
had in my practice,'' said Dr. Henry Moghtader, a 32-year veteran
who delivered Allen two weeks before the due date because of his
weight.
   The parents, Bryce, 32, and Laura, 31, have already nicknamed
him Pudge and say he may have already outgrown his baby garments.
   ``We have packages of (newborn size diapers) that will have to
go back to the store,'' the father said. ``We're using mediums on
him now.''

that he was born on April 1, 1934, in Omaha, Neb. It had been
carried away along with many other items from the Hook household in
a tornado that struck Fargo on June 20, 1957.
   ``We lost anything that was loose,'' said Mrs. Hook, who was out
of town at the time of the storm. ``It was just sucked out and went
sailing.''
   Last week, she received a letter from Ruth Swanson, a former
Fargo resident who now lives in Moorhead, Minn. Inside was her
son's birth certificate _ torn and dirty but still legible, even to
the baby's footprints and Mrs. Hook's thumbprints on the back.
   In the enclosed letter of explanation, Swanson said she was
cleaning out old papers recently when ``I came across an old
envelope of pieces of paper that landed in our back yard the night
of the tornado that struck Fargo some 30 years ago.
   ``It may not be of any importance at this late date, but I
thought you should be the judge.''

   ``The Simpsons'' may be the best-known, most
hyped family on television. But you won't see them on ABC or NBC.
   Both networks have refused to air commercials featuring the
animated characters selling Butterfinger candybars. Now the two
networks say they also won't show an upcoming Burger King ad
campaign starring the bug-eyed family.
   Of the Big Three, only CBS approved the advertisements.
   All three prohibit commercials featuring actors on the set of
competing shows, but CBS has issued a statement saying animated
characters are OK, as long as they don't mention the name of their

   ``The Simpsons'' show is broadcast by Fox network.

<TEXT>
   Delays at the Pentagon held up discovery of a
Mexican border drug smugglers' tunnel for six weeks, allowing
cocaine to pour through the passage into Arizona, according to a
published report.
   Just days after finding the northern end of the passage in
Douglas, Ariz., federal agents intercepted a shipment of more than
one ton of cocaine.
   ``Nobody thought there was a delay,'' Pentagon spokesman Maj.
Doug Hart said, according to today's editions of the Los Angeles
Times. ``It went through regular channels.''
   Despite a high-profile Administration effort to use the military
in drug interdiction, the Pentagon's slow response raised questions
about the effectiveness of the policy.
   ``They announce that drugs are a major national security threat
and then this takes six weeks?'' the Times quoted an unidentified
official as asking. ``What the heck is going on here?''
   Customs officials said they couldn't say how much cocaine passed
through the tunnel between mid-March, when agents in Arizona asked
for military assistance in finding the passage, and late April,
when the equipment arrived.
   The tunnel, which led to Agua Prieta, Mexico, was found in
mid-May and the shipment of more than one ton of cocaine was
stopped a few days later.
   Thomas McDermott, the U.S. Customs Service agent in charge of
the inquiry, said the tunnel was probably ``a major artery'' for
northward-bound drugs.
   The Customs Service learned of the tunnel in November but could
not find it. In March, the agency learned of a seismic detection
device being developed by the military, and asked for help from
Joint Task Force Six, a new military group for border narcotics
missions.
   The Custom Service's request, labeled urgent, was passed up the
chain of command from the task force to the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
the nation's highest military office.
   Stanley E. Morris, deputy director of the Office of National
Drug Control Policy, called the lag unfortunate, but said top-level
Defense Department review is needed to guard against missions that
might unnecessarily anger the Mexican government or deplete
military stocks.
   ``As folks become more comfortable with what we're doing, I
think it won't have to go up to Joint Chiefs of Staff level,'' said
Col. Thomas C. Carter, deputy commander of the joint task force.
   The task force may operate only on the 300 miles of the
1,900-mile U.S.-Mexico frontier that is public land. Military
patrols along the rest of the border must be conducted by the
National Guard.

   The guardians of French, who spend much of their
time defending the purity of their mother tongue, have conceded it
contains ``absurdities, uncertainties and anomalies'' and issued 15
pages of spelling corrections.
   The government-requested overhaul proved that spelling is ``a
national psychodrama,'' the daily newspaper Liberation said.
   Premier Michel Rocard, who requested the spelling review last
year, on Tuesday accepted the changes submitted by the High Council
on the French Language. He ordered that the new spellings be taught
in all schools starting next year.
   He also ordered a meeting of dictionary specialists, publishing
houses, the press and all those dealing with the written word to
find the best way to make the new spellings the norm.
   ``It was never a question that the government legislate in such
matters. The language belongs to those who use it,'' Rocard said.
``But it is up to the government ... to favor that usage which
appears most satisfactory.''
   Anticipating a collective shudder from the citizenry, the High
Council offered reassurances. The new spellings would, for example,
change no more than two words on two full pages of Proust's ``La
Pleiade.''
   Small comfort to schoolchildren, parents and teachers, said an
association of university professors, who predicted that some words
would have two different spellings for years to come.
   ``Once again, students, parents and teachers will be disoriented
and finish by accepting no rules at all,'' said the Societe des
Agreges. ``Under the pretext of correcting fancied anomalies, new
ones are being introduced.''
   The High Council said it was not reforming the language, only
making ``certain rectifications of absurdities ... uncertainties
... and anomalies'' that ``troubled the experts themselves.''
   The five categories of changes affect the hyphen, accent marks,
the plural form of compound words, accordance of the past
participle in reflexive verbs and a potpourri of anomalies.
   The hyphen, much used in French, is going out of style,
according to the sages, who are all but discarding it. Even the
hyphen used in English words like ``cow-boy,'' ``strip-tease'' or
``week-end'' will disappear.
   There will be fewer circumflexes (
</TEXT>
<HEAD>) in the new French. The</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``accent grave,'' the left to right slash above certain letters,
will be ``generalized,'' removing the many exceptions under which
it is applied.
   More drastic changes do away with the feminine ``e'' or plural
``s'' when according past participles with reflexive verbs _ in
certain cases. And the second half of compound words, when plural,
will always end in ``s,'' while the first half will lose the ``s.''
   The Academie Francaise, whose 40 ``immortals'' are the ultimate
arbiters of the French language, approved the changes, along with
the Councils of the French Language of the French Communities of
Belgium and Quebec.
   The French language has always been a reverent issue here, and
successive governments have tried to stamp out Anglicisms and other
impurities, sometimes resorting to fines for offenders.
   Last week, President Francois Mitterrand, a vociferous defender
of his mother tongue, complained that English was supplanting
French in the European Community.
   Mitterrand said ensuring the place of French as an official EC
language was a top priority of his government, and added that
France was prepared to help the EC ``enable its employees to
acquire the linguistic competence needed to perform their
missions.''
   But the university professors said the spelling changes would
defeat that cause.
   ``Once again, the error is being made that French is no longer a
universal language because it is too difficult. English has become
a spoken language around the world,'' the group said, ``despite the
fact that its spelling is unchanged and often without logic.''

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa said in an interview Wednesday
that he must become president to preserve Poland's new democracy
and prevent his former allies in Solidarity from forming a
dangerous power monopoly.
   The union leader challenged his former friends in Warsaw who now
oppose him to start a separate ``center-left'' political party, and
relinquish using the broad label of Solidarity.
   ``I do not want to be president. (But) I will have to be
president,'' Walesa said in the interview in Gazeta Wyborcza,
Poland's largest newspaper.
   As president, Walesa said, he would not oppose the government of
Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, but he would use presidential
decrees to ``put the problems of our country in order.''
Specifically, he would intervene to stop holdover Communist
officials from purloining state property they still control.
   Walesa said he is waging political war because he is in ``deadly
fear'' that a new power monopoly is being formed by his former
Solidarity allies who control the government, parliament and media.
   ``Now I will create ... a war at the top. It is a war that I
want to win,'' Walesa said.
   ``What is really needed right now is patience,'' responded
Solidarity parliamentary leader Bronislaw Geremek, one of the
former allies targeted by Walesa.
   Asked by Radio Solidarity about Walesa's comments, Geremek said
Poland's success ``is possible only when we have patience and
hope.''
   ``I think that Mr. Walesa at the moment is unaware that by means
of his way of thinking, way of talking, declarations, he creates
danger for this very weak democracy we have achieved in Poland,''
Geremek said.
   In recent months, open conflict has erupted between Walesa at
union headquarters in Gdansk and the East bloc's first
non-Communist government in Warsaw. The government was created by
Solidarity and led by Mazowiecki, who like Geremek was among
Walesa's closest advisers for nearly a decade.
   Walesa says his motive is political pluralism, the framing of
distinct parties to push the reform process faster now that a
united Solidarity no longer faces a united Communist foe.
   ``I am in deadly fear of a monopoly, not of my friends but of
their successors _ that once again I will be in prison and my
children, for sure, because every monopoly ends up like that,''
Walesa said.
   A new political group, the Center Alliance, backs Walesa for
president. On Tuesday, Walesa met with Peasant Party
representatives who could offer substantial support. Like Walesa,
the Center Alliance says it wants to speed change in Poland and
accuses Mazowiecki's government and Geremek's parliament caucus of
acting too slowly to oust former Communists from positions of power.
   Government supporters, including many long-term Solidarity
figures, are trying to form a counter-alliance out of local
Citizens Committees that ran Solidarity's parliament campaign last
year.
   The still-unnamed federation rejects political labels but
advocates stability and unity to support the government while
dramatic economic reforms are under way. It wants to calm fears
among Westerners considering investment in Poland.
   The continued presence in the government of President Wojciech
Jaruzelski, the former head of the now-dissolved Communist Party,
symbolizes the dispute. The general who declared martial law
against Solidarity was given the post to smooth the transition in
once-historic reform agreements now overtaken by the breadth of
change in Eastern Europe.
   Jaruzelski's term runs to 1995, but a new constitution could
change that date. It is widely expected that presidential elections
will occur no later than next spring.
   Although nominally in charge of the army, Jaruzelski has been a
largely ceremonial head of state and has done nothing to block the
Mazowiecki government.
   But Walesa said that ``we need a president with an axe:
decisive, sharp, forthright.''
   ``If this axe is supposed to undercut this fledgling Polish
democracy, I would be against it,'' Geremek said.
   Walesa also alluded to suggestions printed in Gazeta Wyborcza
that he is not refined enough to be president.
   ``Criticism that I do not know how to talk with presidents?''
Walesa asked. ``I have talked to them and they want to talk with
me.''

   President Bush today suspended an
18-month dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization,
saying the group had failed to forcefully condemn an unsuccessful
May 30 terrorist attack against Israel.
   Bush said the United States cannot maintain contact with the PLO
``as long as this terroristic act is sticking in our throat.'' He
called on the PLO to ``satisfy us that those who are responsible''
would be disciplined.
   Bush conceded that his decision might prompt renewed violence in
the region. He said he hoped that wouldn't be the case and added,
``I would like to see the peace process move forward.''
   ``We've given the PLO ample time to deal with this issue,'' Bush
said at a news conference at the Marshall Space Flight Center.
   Bush has called on PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat previously to
condemn the May 30 raid. He said a general PLO statement denouncing
attacks against civilians was ``not sufficient'' to meet U.S. terms
for a continuation of the diplomatic talks.
   ``At any time the PLO is prepared to take the necessary steps,
we are prepared to resume the dialogue,'' he said.
   Bush called on all parties in the Middle East to eschew violence
and said, ``I would like to see the peace process move forward.''
   Bush called the May 30 attempted attack a ``seaborne terrorist
infiltration'' and said, ``the size of the force and the geographic
target strongly indicated that civilians would have been the
target.''
   Bush had urged Arafat to disavow the assault and to discipline
those who sent two speedboats filled with Palestinian fighters
toward Tel Aviv, where they were spotted by radar and intercepted
by the Israeli navy 20 miles offshore.
   The Palestine Liberation Front, a faction of the PLO headed by
Abul Abbas, claimed responsibility for the attack, in which four
guerrillas were killed and 12 captured.
   At the same time, Bush said the dialogue begun in the final
months of the Reagan administration had contributed ``to progress
in the peace process.''
   He said the United States is prepared to resume contacts with
the PLO one day. ``We are committed to a comprehensive
settlement,''he said.
   He added that any peace process must recognize Israel's security
and Palestinian rights.
   Bush recently wrote Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who
heads a newly formed government, in an effort to revive the
process. Through an emissary, Israeli Cabinet Secretary Eliakim
Rubinstein, the government in Jerusalem has promised to pursue
peace with the Arabs.
   On other subjects, Bush:
   _ Said he does not plan a ``bold new initiative'' to help the
ailing Soviet economy. He said his administration stands ready to
talk with allies who reportedly favor a costly plan to assist
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of economic reform.
   _ Defended his press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, for his
comments on Tuesday critical of Democrats on the savings and loan
bailout issue. He said Fitzwater was ``responding to a couple of
shots across my bow'' on the subject. He said he hopes to work with
Congress to fix the difficulties, and said ``active prosecution is
under way'' of those who violated the law.
   _ Said he would tell Nelson Mandela next week that American
sanctions against South Africa will remain in place until
conditions fixed under law are met. He also paid a tribute to South
African President F.W. de Klerk ``for what he's done'' to start
dismantling apartheid. ``He's come a long way,'' Bush said.
   The Israeli Embassy issued a statement praising Bush's
suspension of the PLO talks. ``Israel believes that the
administration's decision will enhance and promote the peace
process and will encourage those Palestinians seeking peace with
Israel to seize upon this opportunity to begin a direct dialogue
with Israel,'' the embassy said.
   In New York, the PLO envoy to the United Nations said he would
reserve comment on reports the United States will sever its
dialogue with the PLO until the government makes an official
announcement.
   Zehdi Labib Terzi, permanent observer of what the United Nations
calls Palestine, said he could not respond until he reads the
official statement.
   U.N. officials said that Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar would not comment in advance of the official announcement.
The United Nations considers the PLO to be the sole legitimate
representative of the Palestinian people.
   Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich., the senior Republican on the
House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Bush's decision was ``the
only one he could have made under the circumstances.''
   ``America must let Arafat know that the PLO can't talk peace and
wage war at the same time,'' he said in a statement. ``President
Bush was wise to suspend rather than terminate the talks. Arafat
should know that the United States is still willing to cooperate in
the search for peace, but not under the barrel of a gun.''
   The dialogue with the PLO was established by the Reagan
administration in December 1988 after Arafat, at the urging of the
United States, disavowed terrorism and recognized Israel's
existence.
   Talks have been held since then outside Tunis, the PLO
headquarters, between PLO officials and Robert Pelletreau Jr., the
U.S. ambassador to Tunisia.
   The State Department, in a report to Congress in March, said the
PLO was adhering to its commitment. Palestinian groups have
launched nearly 30 border and rocket attacks against Israel since
the talks began.
   But, the report said, ``we have no evidence in those cases or
any others that the actions were authorized or approved by the PLO
Executive Committee or by Arafat personally.''
   Abbas is a member of the committee.
   A number of talks were held by Pelletreau with PLO officials
since May 30. But U.S. peacemaking efforts in the Middle East have
been stalled for months over Israeli objections to the American
formua for negotiations.
   The 1988 U.S. opening to the PLO boosted the prestige of Arafat
and his organization. In putting together a framework for
negotiations the Bush administration consulted with the PLO, mostly
through Egypt.

   Republican Gov. Guy Hunt billed
President Bush as the feature attraction at a fund-raiser
Wednesday, but for Alabama voters the real show now is the broiling
Democratic gubernatorial runoff.
   It has been a free-swinging, name-calling, political slugfest,
replete with whiffs of marijuana smoke and allusions to Adolf
Hitler and a convicted child molester.
   Beneath blazing skies, state teacher lobbyist Paul Hubbert and
Attorney General Don Siegelman have exchanged rhetorical blows
since the June 5 primary when Hubbert led Siegelman by 49,000 votes.
   The winner of Tuesday's runoff will move on to the November
election against Hunt, the first Republican governor of Alabama in
112 years.
   Siegelman struck first following the primary when he accused
Hubbert of defending incompetent teachers, including a convicted
child molester, and making ``worthless promises'' that would double
the state budget and cost $10 billion in new taxes.
   Hubbert, in turn, linked Siegelman rhetorically to Hitler and to
Jane Fonda, who is still reviled by many Alabamans for her anti-war
protests during the Vietnam War.
   He also indirectly reminded voters that the state attorney
general admitted smoking marijuana briefly in college. Hubbert
began carrying a mop and buket on the campaign trail, saying it was
time for Siegelman to clean up his act.
   On the eve of Bush's arrival in Huntsville for the Hunt
re-election fund-raiser, Hubbert and Siegelman called a truce, at
least temporarily.
   The temperature was 98 degrees at the state capital, but in
nearby Prattville the two Democratic runoff opponents talked coolly
of Democratic unity. The setting was an Autauga County Democratic
Club forum.
   ``No matter what the outcome, I pledge I'm going to get behind
the Democratic ticket,'' said Hubbert. ``I hope to lead it, but if
not I'm going to get behind it.''
   ``I know that Paul Hubbert and Don Siegelman are going to do
what we can to make sure there is a Democratic Party victory in
November,'' said Siegelman.
   Hubbert, 54, and Siegelman, 44, are depicted by Hunt as
liberals. But both have stressed their conservatism while calling
for more progressive and dynamic leadership in Montgomery.
   And both have relied heavily on negative advertising.
   Siegelman is making Bobby Sanders the Willie Horton of the
Alabama runoff. Horton is the convicted Massachusetts murderer who
unwittingly played a prominent role in the 1988 presidential race.
   Sanders, convicted of sodomizing teen-age boys in Tennessee, was
provided legal counsel by the Alabama Education Association in 1985
when he fought his firing as a teacher in Huntsville.
   Sanders was entitled to the counsel through his membership in
the teacher organization. But Siegelman repeatedly has raised the
case in ads and speeches.
   ``Many of our children are going without books, science labs and
decent facilities,'' said Siegelman. ``Yet we have to spend our
taxpayer money to keep child abusers out of classrooms. Mr.
Hubbert, that's dead wrong.''
   Hubbert said Siegelman's tactics bring to mind Hitler's ``big
lie'' tactic of boldly repeating a falsehood until it is accepted
as truth.
   In another campaign salvo, Siegelman said Hubbert's promises
would cost Alabama taxpayers $1 billion in new taxes over four
years. To that, Hubbert said, ``One must wonder what he was smoking
that may have caused him to come up with those numbers.''
   That was a thinly disguised allusion to Siegelman's marijuana
admission. Siegelman spokesman Rick Dent called it a ``cheap shot.''
   Hubbert also pointed out that Siegelman received a 1986 campaign
contribution from a group that included Ms. Fonda; Siegelman said
he sent the money back.
   Dr. William Stewart, a political science professor at the
University of Alabama who is co-author of a 1988 book on Alabama
politics, said the 1990 runoff is not unusual in its viciousness.
But he said it could hurt the Democratic nominee in the general
election.
   ``The level of rhetoric has reached the point where the main
beneficiary, in my opinion, is Guy Hunt,'' Stewart said.

<HEAD>Grave Robbery Tied to Dungeons and Dragons Game</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Five men have been charged with robbing a
grave and using the body of a suicide victim as the centerpiece for
a black-robed ceremony in a fantasy game of Dungeon and Dragons.
   The men were arrested Monday and Tuesday, and charged with
stealing the body of 20-year-old Steven Glen Morgan, Columbia
County Sheriff Tom Tramel said. Morgan's body, missing one leg, was
found last month in a wooded area in adjacent Union County.
   Morgan's mother later found the leg, propped against a tree in
the same woods, authorities said.
   Tramel said investigators do not think the leg was intentionally
separated from the body.
   Tramel said the five gathered frequently to play Dungeons and
Dragons, a fantasy game in which players pretend to be characters
with great strength or magical powers as they participate in a
quest of their own devising.
   ``We believe that the motive was due to their involvement with
Dungeons and Dragons, which they have been involved in for quite
some time and that became very serious,'' Tramel said.
   Dungeons and Dragons game was developed as a board game in 1973
and became popular in the early 1980s. Detractors say the way the
game is sometimes played is dangerous because it can blur
distinctions between fantasy and reality.
   Morgan's mother, Dorothy Morgan, said Tuesday that one of those
arrested had called her to say her son's body had been taken to a
house near Lake City where about 30 to 40 people dressed in black
robes held a ceremony. She did not identify the caller.
   ``At one point, he called me and told me to keep my mouth shut
because Glen belonged to them now,'' she said.
   ``God will see that they will pay,'' she said.
   Arrested were Leon Jody Thompson, 21; Charles Vincent Womack
Jr., 23; Thomas Christian Cox, 21; Joseph R. Pottgen, 21, and
Frederick Day, 19. All live in the Lake City area, about 60 miles
west of Jacksonville in north Florida.
   They were charged with disturbing the contents of a grave _ a
felony that carries a five-year maximum sentence _ and were being
held Wednesday in the county detention center pending court
appearances.
   The turning point in the case was when a person who witnessed
the grave robbery talked to officials, said investigator Russ
Williams. His name is being withheld, Tramel said, because he fears
for his life.
   Investigators are trying to determine whether there is a link
between the Morgan grave robbery and another grave robbery in the
area last October. That body was found in a field by a farmer
before anyone knew the grave had been disturbed.
   Authorities are not sure what the suspects did with the body or
how it got to Union County. They also do not think the five knew
Morgan before he died in December from a self-inflicted gunshot
wound.

   The parliaments of Georgia and Uzbekistan took
cautious steps toward sovereignty on Wednesday but followed a
different path than the one blazed by the Baltic republics.
   They were the latest challenges to face President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, who has been offering greater autonomy in an effort to
persuade the Soviet Union's increasingly restive republics to
remain within the fold.
   Uzbekistan's Supreme Soviet passed a ``Declaration of
Sovereignty of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic within a Renewed
Soviet Federation,'' the official Soviet news agency Tass reported.
It was the first of the five Soviet Central Asian republics to move
toward a break with Moscow.
   The ``Renewed Soviet Federation'' referred to in the declaration
does not currently exist. Gorbachev has spoken often of revamping
the relationship between the Soviet government and the republics.
Last week he offered to establish a new, looser union of
``sovereign states'' joined under a treaty.
   Some 1,240 miles away, the Georgian Supreme Soviet decided to
create a legal mechanism for restoring the republic's independence,
Tass reported.
   Neither step was as radical as the declarations of independence
approved by the Soviet Baltic republics, but they showed how the
spirit of breaking from central rule is spreading across this vast,
multi-ethnic country.
   Gorbachev imposed economic sanctions against Lithuania after it
declared its independence March 11. He called the declaration
illegal and demanded it be suspended.
   Some deputies of Uzbekistan's parliament, meeting in the
republican capital Tashkent, wanted to postpone consideration of
the sovereignty declaration until the new union treaty is
completed, Tass said. But they were overruled and the declaration
was approved by a majority.
   ``The declaration proclaims Uzbekistan's state sovereignty and
the supremacy of republican laws on its entire territory,'' Tass
said. ``The declaration puts all issues of domestic and foreign
policy under the authority of Uzbekistan.''
   The Tass report made clear Uzbekistan is not considering
seceding from the Soviet Union, but one Uzbek official said no
options were being ruled out.
   ``If it (the union) doesn't support the well-being of the
workers, doesn't get us out of the crisis, then we will be obliged
to think it over with deputies,'' Uzbek Premier Sh. Mirsaidov told
Soviet television.
   Uzbekistan, a cotton-growing republic of 20 million people, is
home of the region's best-organized grassroots political movement,
Berlik, and is a center for activism by the majority Moslem
population.
   There are many sources of discontent with Moscow.
   The economy, environment and ethnic relations among people in
the arid region have suffered from central Kremlin rule.
Unemployment is the highest in the nation, overfertilization has
polluted waterways and ruined crops and ethnic tensions are boiling
over.
   Georgia's Supreme Soviet decided to form a commission to create
a legal mechanism for restoring the independence the republic lost
after Red Army troops occupied the area in 1921.
   Tass said lawmakers in the mountainous republic of 5.3 million
people also gave preliminary approval to a law on economic
independence and appealed to the Russian federation's legislature
to establish ties with it as a sovereign government.
   On March 9, the Georgian Supreme Soviet condemned the republic's
annexation by the Soviet Union and urged negotiations on
independence, becoming the fourth of the 15 Soviet republics to
begin a parliamentary struggle for secession.
   Wednesday's session was held a month ahead of scheduled in
response to demands from hunger-striking university students in the
Georgian capital of Tbilisi, Tass said.

<HEAD>HUNTSVILLE, Ala.: few questions.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: Mr. President, about your announcement _
   Q: Mr. President _
   Bush: Yes, John. Sorry, Norm.
   Q: doesn't your announcement of today, coupled with Secretary
Baker's words that the Israelis should call the White House when
they are serious, mean that the U.S. position on the peace process
in the Middle East is dormant right now?
   Bush: John, it's not moving forward right now, and the offer
still stands. I have sent a letter to Prime Minister Shamir. I have
very specifically asked questions that relate to seriousness about
the peace process.
   But I would like to see the peace process move forward. Nothing
herein should indicate anything different, because here we are
simply taking (inaudible) shot at terrorism.
   Norm, excuse me. I forgot my protocol here.
   Q: Marlin seemed to have lit a fairly short political fuse with
his comments on the S&amp;L bailout in accusing the Democrats of having
had a big part in that mess.
   Are you ready to play that game this election year and blame the
Democrats for a problem that others have laid on years of
permissive regulation by the Reagan administration?
   Bush: Norm, you're almost getting me into the fight by the way
you ask the question. But no, I'm not going to _ (chuckles) _ no, I
want to get the savings and loan problem solved.
   And Marlin, properly, seeing a couple of shots across my bow
from certain distinguished members of the United States Senate,
decided not to acquiesce in those attacks without some response.
   What he did was appropriate. But, what I'm trying to do is not
respond to individuals and to simply keep moving forward on this _
on this process, and not try to be out there saying here's who's to
blame and here's who's not to blame.
   But, it was interesting because I think you're right _ a spark
seemed to be ignited there _ and I think more important than
continuing to pour fuel on that spark is to work cooperatively with
the Congress in trying to get this mess solved.
   And of course, that is a part of what will be discussed in the
budget process.
   I would say to the American people on this one, the obligation
is to protect the depositor _ that's what our obligation is.
   And another obligation is to prosecute those who have broken the
law, and there has been an active prosecution under way. I talked
with Dick Thornburgh at lunch yesterday. I got some impressive
numbers of the numbers of cases that are _ that are being followed
up on now, and I expect we'll see plenty more.
   So, protect the depositor, put those that are guilty into the
dock where they belong, and see that they are, you know, brought to
responsibility for what they've done.
   Q: Do you, in retrospect though, agree with the argument that
deregulation or unregulation of the savings and loan, the financial
industry, occurred too quickly, went too far in the '80s?
   Bush: Well, I think _ in looking back, I think some of the
excesses of the loan policies are rather obvious. Basically, we
made some proposals, I think, in that task force that I headed that
might have corrected some of the abuse.
   But, I don't want to _ I don't want to argue in favor of
reregulation of industries. But, I will say that I think some of
the loan policies instituted after the changes were made were
foolish and were certainly ill-advised. And the result is a
pounding for the original purpose of the S&amp;Ls, which was financing
_ primarily financing housing in this country.
   Yeah, John?
   Q: Is it true that none of our allies, with the exception, of
course, of the Israelis, wanted you to suspend these talks with the
PLO? And you said you have given the PLO enough time. I mean, why
now? I mean, is there some reason to toughen in today?
   Bush: No, I don't think of any reason today. And I didn't set
it, you know, in my mind, X numbers of days. But, John, I think
there will be a lack of agreement with what I've done here on the
part of our strongest allies.
   And I know this is true on the part of some of the most
reasonable and moderate Arab states.
   But I would simply remind them of the conditions upon which the
dialogue started in the first place. And I would also remind them
that if they look at this statement and remedial action is taken,
the dialogue, from the U.S. side, can promptly be restored.
   Jerry?

<TEXT>
   Q: Mr. President, at the same time you're having this trouble
with the PLO you've also got a new Israeli government that has an
avowed policy of settling in the West Bank more rapidly than it's
been settled in the past. How are you going to deal with that
government? What's your policy going to be on aid for that
government, specifically on housing guarantees for Soviet
immigrants?
   Bush: Well, Jerry, I think I probably _ my position on
settlement in the territories is probably as well known as
anything. And our policy is not to have new settlements, and our
policy is certainly not to finance new settlements. Is that
responsive, or was there another part to your question?
   Q: There's a specific question now, though, of whether we'll
provide housing guarantees for Soviet immigrants of ($100 million?).
   Bush: Well, but not to settle in the _ in the post _ '67
territory _ in the territories, beyond the '67 lines.
   Q: Are you going to seek specific new guarantees from this new
government that that won't happen _
   Bush: Well, I will, and I hope I'm successful. But I think they
_ they _ there is no question that the Shamir government knows my
position on this, knows the standing position of the United States.
   Here, and then Jim.
   Q: Mr. President, as you know, Nelson Mandela arrived in the
United States today, and you're going to meet with him next week.
What are you going to tell him on the sanctions question?
   And second, the second part, there have been reports, oh, some
weeks ago that the United States Central Intelligence Agency was
involved in a process that led to a rift many years ago. And there
have been suggestions that you should apologize on behalf of the
United States government and the American people. Will you do that?
   Bush: No. I will take my leadership on that question from Mr.
Mandela, who put it very well when he said, ``Let bygones be
bygones,'' and that is not to agree with or disagree with the
charge.
   On the second point _ your first, my second _ the sanctions,
under the law, cannot be lifted until certain additional steps are
taken by South Africa.
   Let me be very clear _ I salute Mr. de Klerk for what he's done.
He's come a long, long way. And I salute Mr. Mandela for his
approach to de Klerk. I think that demonstrates a willingness to
talk that few of us might have predicted a couple of years ago. But
there still are things that have to be done under our law in order
to lift the sanctions.
   And I've listed them here, but anyway, you don't want to go into
the details on it, but if you do, I'd be glad to click them off for
you.
   But in any event, there has to be progress. And I'd like to find
a way to show Mr. de Klerk that we, the United States, are grateful
for this new approach that is having South Africa evolve to a much
more open society and hopefully one day to one which is color blind
in terms of participation in the political process.
   But I can't lift the sanctions under existing U.S. law. But I'm
looking forward to talking to Mr. Mandela about this. There are
black leaders in South Africa that disagree with him on this
question of sanctions. The foremost of those that come to mind is
Mr. Buthelezi, but _ with whom I have talked about this question.
   And I historically have not felt that certainly adding to the
sanction base would help at all, and I had some original
reservations about a sanction approach. But I will say that it
seems to _ if you can credit sanctions with the evolution of _
towards democracy in South Africa, I'd have to say, well, it seems
to be, you know, there are some good things to it.
   But it's delicate, because I want to find a way to show our
appreciation to de Klerk, and yet I don't want to pull the rug out
from under Mr. Mandela.

   The changing relationship between the United States and the

including individual terrorism, group and state terrorism.''

<TEXT>
   Q: Mr. President _
   Q: Mr. President, are you _
   Bush: Oh, Jim. Sorry, we'll come back. You're standing up. I
can't see you.
   Q: Mr. President, are you planning to support a G-7 initiative
to offer economic aid to the Soviet Union at next month's economic
summit? And if so, what has caused you to change your mind on that?
   Bush: No, I'm not planning to do that, and I expect, though,
that matter may be discussed. There are _ I've tried to be very up
front with Mr. Gorbachev when he was here about difficulties in
terms of financial support. I talked to him in Malta about that.
   Indeed, we presented him with a list of things that might be
done to improve our ability to work in full cooperation with them
on that.
   But I don't plan a new _ a new initiative. And yet, I want to
see perestroika continue. I haven't changed my view that economic
reform is important, and I recognize that support from the West can
well _ can well help the economy.
   But there is an awful lot of reform that has to take place in
the market and the distribution systems. There's some political
problems that we have that I've discussed very frankly with Mr.
Gorbachev, not the least of them $5 billion a year going down to
Cuba.
   So we've still got some problems there, but discount the fact
that we are planning some bold new initiative. On the other hand,
I'm perfectly prepared to talk to our allies on any subject, and I
think that will probably be one of them.
   Q: Well there are reports that President Mitterrand would
propose such a plan. Is that _
   Bush: Well, the Germans are interested, too, and I'm not saying
we're not interested, but I am saying there are some formidable
obstacles.
   Yeah, Jim?
   Q: Back on the PLO, one of the theories passed around in your
own administration was that the intent of this terrorist attack was
to derail the peace process. Are you at all concerned that by
suspending the dialogue you're playing into the hands of the
hard-liners like Abu Abbus? And is there also a danger _
   Bush: Yes. Let me stop you there, just to respond, so I don't
get _ forget the question. Yes I am concerned about that. Go ahead.
(Scattered laughter.)
   Q: Well, if you're so concerned about it, then why did you _ why
did you take this action?
   Bush: Well, because we had to weigh the whole question and the
question was complicated by the fact that there were three specific
undertakings, one of which, a very important one in my view, has
clearly has been violated.
   So _ but _ it's not an easy call, because I know some feel that
the PLO dialogue is totally unproductive, and as I indicated in
this statement, I don't.
   And the question up here was, well, do our allies _ will they
agree with the steps that I've taken here in Huntsville today? And
the answer is, no, some of them will not agree, because they do
feel that the dialogue has kind of helped calm things in some parts
of the Middle East.
   So _ so, what the answer to it is, is for the PLO to take the
action that I've called for and to satisfactorily _ to satisfy us
that those who were responsible will be disciplined, and condemn
this specific act. It's not enough to simply reiterate one's
concern on terror.
   Q: If I may follow up?
   Bush: Please.
   Q: Is there a danger, too, that those Palestinians who would put
some hope in the dialogue between the PLO and the U.S. might now
throw up their hands in desperation and resort to violence?
   Bush: Well, I hope that's not the case, and yet _ I would refer
you to the very last page of my _ last paragraph or two of the
statement, when I did call for no violence, and I think it's fair
to say that at any time you're dealing with something as
complicated as the Middle East, you worry about that.
   But I hope that's not the case, and I hope they'll see in my
statement a rather temperate view here that, though we're specific
in calling for the condemnation of this particular terrorist act,
that once that is done, in keeping with the Arafat's _ Arafat's
undertaking, that we can resume talks.
   There has been a frustration, Jim, in the Arab world that this
dialogue has not resulted in more progress, and I understand the
frustration. I don't happen to agree with it. I think things are
better because we've had the dialogue, but Israel has strongly
objected to it and some Palestinians have been, as we can clearly
see, concerned about it. But I believe that we ought to try to find
a way to get it back at some point.

<TEXT>
   Future international AIDS meetings won't be
held in the United States and other countries that restrict the
entry of people infected with the AIDS virus, a top conference
official said Wednesday.
   ``It's not appropriate to hold the conference in countries that
have restrictions,'' said Dr. Paul Volberding of the University of
California, San Francisco.
   Volberding is the incoming president of the International AIDS
Society, which picks the sites for the annual AIDS meeting. He is
also co-chairman of this year's gathering, the Sixth International
Conference on AIDS, being held this week in San Francisco.
   Volberding said that Canada, Japan and Australia are among other
countries that will be barred from being hosts of the meeting
because of similar restrictions on travel by foreigners infected
with the AIDS virus.
   While the United States has significantly eased rules on
admitting people who carry HIV, the AIDS virus, the regulations
have emerged as a major issue at this meeting, and about 100
organizations are boycotting because of them.
   ``It isn't fair. It's discriminatory. And it won't do anything
to stop the spread of HIV infection,'' Volberding said.
   In 1987, the U.S. Senate voted 97 to 0 to add HIV infection to
the list of medical conditions for which foreigners can be denied
visas. In April, the Justice Department said it would issue special
10-day visas for people traveling to the United States to attend
specific conferences, including the AIDS meeting, without requiring
them to admit they are infected with HIV.
   Administration officials have contended they can't throw out the
HIV restriction entirely, since it was imposed by the Senate.
However, Dr. June Osborn, chairman of the National Commission on
AIDS, said federal health officials should ``regrasp'' their
authority to decide which diseases are contagious enough to be on
the list.
   The 1992 AIDS meeting is scheduled to be sponsored by Harvard
University in Boston. Last week, Harvard officials threatened to
withdraw from the meeting unless the travel rules are changed.
   On Wednesday, Alan Fein, head of the Harvard AIDS Institute,
said Harvard will pull out unless all restrictions on people with
HIV infection have been eliminated by the time Congress adjourns in
November.
   Volberding said that if the Boston meeting is abandoned, it may
be too late to find another country to be host of the 1992
gathering. The meeting is scheduled to be held in Florence, Italy,
next year and in Berlin in 1993.
   The international AIDS meetings are the principal forum for
exchanging new information on the spread and control of the
epidemic. An estimated 12,000 scientists, doctors, social workers
and other AIDS professionals are expected to attend this week's
meeting.

   Democrats collected $1.5 million for House,
Senate and statewide candidates at a fund-raiser where they were
entertained by several comedians and singers on Wednesday.
   The event was sponsored by the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the
Democratic National Committee and Democrats for the 90s.
   ``This is an evening for fun, entertainment and celebration,''
said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.
   The money raised by the $30 to $1,000-per seat tickets will give
Democratic candidates funds at ``a critical time'' as the 1990
races heat up,
   said DCCC spokesman Howard Schloss.
   Performers for the evening at the concert hall of the John F.
Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts included singers Roberta
Flack and Rodney Crowell, the rock group Crosby, Stills and Nash
and the Gypsy Kings. Also on hand were comedians and comics Dana
Carvey _ noted for his George Bush imitation _ and Al Franken from
``Saturday Night Live.''
   The event was the brainchild of Pamela Harriman, widow of
Averell Harriman, who until his death in 1986 served as a roving
ambassador and adviser for every Democratic president since
Roosevelt.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III will
sound out U.S. allies on a proposed Western aid package to boost
the faltering Soviet economy, but President Bush said Wednesday he
sees ``formidable obstacles'' to such assistance.
   U.S. officials said Baker was expected to take up the proposed
assistance package, being pushed by both West Germany and France,
at negotiating sessions in East Berlin on the question of German
unification.
   Direct aid to the Soviets is viewed as one way to overcome
Kremlin resistance to NATO membership for a unified Germany.
   Asked at a news conference in Huntsville, Ala., about the Soviet
aid proposals, Bush said he was willing to discuss the matter with
U.S. allies but cautioned against looking for any ``bold new
initiative'' coming from the upcoming seven-nation economic summit.
   ``I am not saying we are not interested, but I am saying that
there are some formidable obstacles,'' Bush said.
   Bush mentioned the need for the Soviets to do more to reform
their economy and alluded to congressional opposition because of
the crackdown on the breakaway Baltic republics and continued
Soviet assistance to Cuba.
   ``There are some political problems that we have that I have
discussed very frankly with Mr. Gorbachev, not the least of them
the $5 billion a year going down to Cuba,'' Bush said.
   The West German government several months ago took the lead in
offering to help President Mikhail S. Gorbachev cope with his
economic woes.
   The Bush administration approved the overture as part of a
nine-point package Baker discussed two weeks ago with Soviet
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze at a human rights conference in
Copenhagen.
   ``One of the goals of the discussions is to see how we can
assist the Soviet economy through some sort of economic package,''
a U.S. official said before Baker left for East Berlin. ``It's
likely they will discuss it in Berlin.''
   French President Francois Mitterrand said Tuesday he would ask
the United States and five other major industrial democracies to
consider extending financial and technical aid to the Soviets at an
economic summit meeting in Houston next month.
   Baker, officials said, also was weighing other assurances to
allay Moscow's concerns.
   Officials said those assurances included issuance of
declarations by NATO and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact designed to
reflect the lowering of East-West tension and the prospective
withdrawal of tens of thousands of U.S. and Soviet troops from
Europe.
   The monthly ``2-plus-4'' talks bring together the four victors
of World War II _ the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and
France _ and the two Germanies, who are set to merge their
currencies July 2 and may hold all-German elections in December.
   Baker also will meet separately with Shevardnadze on Friday and
on Thursday with Markus Meckel and Hans-Dietrich Genscher of East
Germany and West Germany.
   Gorbachev's economic problems are apt to be compounded when East
Germany is absorbed by West Germany. There are an estimated 380,000
Soviet troops in East Germany. Some would stay for a transitional
period under a U.S. proposal Baker took up with Shevardnadze in
Copenhagen.
   But the Soviets would be limited to no more than 195,000
soldiers in all of Central Europe, including what is now East
Germany, under a treaty being negotiated in Vienna by NATO and the
Warsaw Pact.
   The return of the troops would strain the Soviet budget both in
terms of housing them and finding jobs for those mustered out of
the service as part of a cutback of 500,000 men promised by
Gorbachev in December 1988.
   The U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
proposed aid package could include the possibility of having the
West Germans pay for housing the withdrawn soldiers in the Soviet
Union.
   But the official added: ``We'll hold off any serious decisions
until the summit.''
   Baker also is likely to discuss with Shevardnadze a renewed
Soviet threat to suspend emigration of Soviet Jews if Israel keeps
settling some of them on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   The Bush administration also opposes allowing Jews to live on
land Israel seized from Jordan and Egypt during the 1967 Mideast
war and that the Arabs hope to recover. But the threat to suspend
emigration, which Gorbachev voiced here June 3, at the end of his
Washington summit meeting with President Bush, is stiffly opposed
by the administration.
   Baker told Shevardnadze in Copenhagen that he was concerned
about Gorbachev's threat to end an exodus of Jews that has reached
20,000 people a month, a historic high.
   Shevardnadze told Baker that Soviet officials had no plan to
change their immigration policy. But a U.S. official said that
Gorbachev since then twice has raised the prospect of suspending
exit permits unless Israel gives assurances the refugees won't
settle in the territories.

   Q: Mr. President _
   Q: Follow up, sir? What about the flip side of that coin, if I
might? As you grappled with this, did you worry and are you worried
now that Israel will just take this and say, ``See, we've been
right about the PLO all along,'' and _
   Bush: I'm not so troubled on that because I think they will see
here that I am not accepting the premise that there is no good to
come from talking to the PLO. So I don't worry too much about that
point.
   Q: But do you see Mr. Shamir as too hard line, as the kind of
leader who is going to say, ``Well, we were right, and therefore,
we'll stay away from _ (inaudible).''
   Bush: Well, I am hoping that's not the case, and one of the
reasons I sent him this long, lengthy letter was to make clear to
him that it is our view the peace process ought to go forward. And
it's going to be difficult for him, but it must go forward. And it
must go forward along the original _ the lines of what originally
was the Shamir plan. And then it became Mubarak got interested, and
he played a useful role in it. Then Jim Baker got involved, and has
done a heroic job in trying to get the talks going.
   So we are _ we are _ I hope that the U.S. will have a useful
role to play, regardless of the step I have taken here in the PLO,
because, as we all know, we were not proposing that the PLO be at
the table. This was a charge made against us by some of the _ some
in Israel, and that isn't _ that doesn't happen to be the case. And
I think the government knows that.
   Yes, Rita. Excuse me. I shouldn't have gotten you earlier.
   Q: Mr. President, during the campaign, you said often that we've
got to find a way that people who have children won't be threatened
with the loss of their jobs. And now you're saying that that has to
be a voluntary provision on the part of employers to give parental
leave. How does that fulfill your campaign promise for people who
work for employers who won't give voluntary leave?
   Bush: You've got to keep working for them till they do, because
my campaign promise did not go to what they call mandated benefits.
And just to be sure I was right, we looked it up again yesterday,
and _ but my position has not changed. And I see that I must
convince some Republicans as well as many Democrats that it hasn't
changed.
   Q: Do you have any point of view on how you are going to
convince these employers? Many of them say if it's not a mandatory
requirement, why should they do it.
   Bush: Well, I have a great, great faith that collective
bargaining and market forces move towards progress. And we've seen
it in the private sector, and I want to see it faster and quicker
in the private sector without burdening every business by the same
formula of mandated benefits.
   Q: Mr. President?
   Bush: Yes, Charles. Excuse me.
   Q: You specified that the PLO dialogue has been positive and
productive, but you haven't really told us in what way. Could you
be a little more specific about that? What productivity do you see
in it?
   Bush: Well, I think the very fact we are talking can _ and
that's one of the reasons I hope that it can be restored _ can
eliminate differences. And I would like to feel that the PLO,
because of our dialogue, doesn't see us as quite the hostile
country that once they did.
   And there's all kinds of small points that are taken up by our
Ambassador Pelletreau in Tunis that I think have reduced the levels
of misunderstanding. I don't want to leave you the wrong
impression, that I think the dialogue has resulted in a more
dynamic peace process. But I do think it's _ I do think that it's
good, and I think that it encourages moderation in the Palestinian
_ within the PLO ranks.
   I think the _ we lose sight of the fact that Arafat did
something that was predicted no Palestinian leader could do when he
recognized Israel's right to exist as a state. And some might say,
``Well, it's about time,'' and I'm one of them. But that was quite
a step forward.
   It was quite a step forward when he recognized Resolution 242,
and I think that was positive. And then I think we've had a chance
to solidify those gains, modest though they might have been,
through dialogue.
   But I can't point to the fact that that has really solved the
question of Middle East peace. I just feel that talking offers more
potential than stiff-arming each other. And yet, we can't digest it
as long as this _ this terroristic act _ is sticking in our throat,
and properly so, as a country that decries international terror.

   The ticker tape parade Wednesday for Nelson
Mandela is the fifth in the last 10 years through New York's
``Canyon of Heroes'' on lower Broadway.
   There have been about twoscore such parades since Charles
Lindbergh was lionized here in 1927. Aviators, athletes and
warriors predominate.
   Among the notable parades:
   1986 _ New York Mets, after beating the Boston Red Sox in the
World Series.
   1985 _ 25,000 Vietnam veterans, led by Gen. William Westmoreland
and 26 Medal of Honor winners, in a 10-years-later welcome-home
tribute.
   1984 _ 221 athletes of the U.S. Olympic team are cheered, but
101 spectators are injured when a construction scaffold on the
parade route gives way.
   1981 _ Welcome home for the Americans hostages freed from Iran.
   1979 _ Pope John Paul II.
   1978 _ New York Yankees world champion team.
   1969 _ ``Miracle'' Mets world champion team.
   1969 _ Astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, the first men
to land on the moon, and fellow Apollo 11 astronaut Michael Collins.
   1963 _ Astronaut Gordon Cooper.
   1962 _ Astronaut John Glenn, the first American in orbit.
   1958 _ Van Cliburn, the only classical musician ever to get the
ticker-tape treatment, after winning piano competition in Moscow.
   1951 _ Gen. Douglas MacArthur, after his recall from Korea by
President Truman.
   1938 _ Douglas ``Wrong-Way'' Corrigan, for his air flight to
Ireland while claiming his destination was Los Angeles.
   1938 _ Howard Hughes and his plane crew, for breaking Wiley
Post's round-the-world flight record.
   1936 _ Beryl Markham, for the first westward trans-Atlantic solo
flight, described later in her memoir ``West With the Night.''
   1928 _ Amelia Earhart, first woman to fly the Atlantic, as
navigator, before making her own solo flight some years later.
   1927 _ Lindbergh, after returning from solo flight to Paris.
   Several of the parades were larger in scope than the traditional
route from Bowling Green to City Hall, a canyon about 16 blocks
long formed by the office towers along Broadway in the financial
district.
   Glenn's parade, which wended through midtown as well as lower
Manhattan, produced the greatest fallout of paper in any ticker
tape parade, 3,474 tons, according to Sanitation Department records.
   The most paper generated by a canyon-only parade was 1,262 for
the Iran hostage parade.
   Official estimates of spectator numbers have been extravagant.
The Mets' 1986 parade was reported as drawing 2.2 million people.
That works out to 137,000 people per block, or enough to fill Shea
Stadium 2{ times.

<TEXT>
   Q: Mr. President, a question about rafters here?
   Bush: The rafter's coming _ two rafter questions here.
   Q: A question about space. How serious are you about this
lunar-based Mars mission proposal? Would you go so far as to veto
the bill that contains NASA appropriations if Congress decides to
delete all the money _
   Bush: I haven't even contemplated any veto strategy. I'd like to
get what I want. I think it's in the national interest. I think
that the United States must remain way out front on science and
technology, and this broad program that I've outlined, seed money
that I've asked for, should be supported. But I'm not _ I think
it's way too early to discuss veto strategy. We've got to take one
_ took one on the chops in a House committee the other day. And
I've got to turn around now and fight for what I believe.
   Yeah _ and then over to Brit. Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, how far will you go to protect the NASA budget
in the future? Can you remove it from HUD and give it to _
   Bush: It's pretty hard, given the way Congress functions, and
that is a function of the Congress, not of the Executive branch, to
decide under what committees these budgets are _ budgets are worked.
   But, I think it is fair to say that I will fight for a
fully-funded space program. We've put forward what I think is a
bold one. I've taken some shots saying, ``Hey, how can you propose
something this big when we have such a large deficit?'' And I
understand the question, but we're talking about stretched out _
we're talking about stretched-out financing and we're talking about
hopefully a continued dynamic economy. And between the two, we can
accommodate this goal if we all get with it.
   Brit _ up in the attic.
   Q: Was there not a need here, sir, to not appear to be indulgent
of the PLO at a time when the administration has been tougher than
perhaps any recent administration has been to Israel?
   Bush: That's not what made my decision, and I don't know that
we've been tougher. I'm the president of the United States and the
United States has a policy and I'm supposed to, I think, go forward
with our policy.
   And one of the big problems we have had is the question between
ourselves and the Israeli government is this question of
settlements. But, I don't _ I wouldn't read my decision here to go
as follows: ``He made this decision because he's concerned about a
complicated relationship with Israel at this point.'' That's not
why I made the decision.
   But, some may read it as that. But, we are _ we are staying with
our concept on the peace process and we are staying _ and are
staying with our policy on settlements. And this action that I have
taken today is consistent with our policy on anti-terror.
   Q: Mr. President.
   Bush: Yeah?
   Q: Do you feel that Israel has committed acts of terrorism (upon
Palestinians)?
   Bush: Well, we spoke out in the _ on recent _ recent violence in
the Gaza and please note my last comment to call for _ calling for
peaceful resolution to these questions as opposed to violence and
international terror. And that's the way I would respond on that.
   Q: _ why you're here in Huntsville, sir, if you are here to help
raise money for Gov. Guy Hunt's gubernatorial campaign?
   Bush: I'm not standing right here to do that, but I was downtown
doing exactly that and I hope we were successful because I am
totally committed to his re-election. I have respected the progress
the state of Alabama has made under his leadership and, as I look
at the way my philosophy of government works, the governors are
very, very important on all this.
   I cite not just the Education Summit in which I worked closely
with Guy, but this whole concept that the states and localities
have a significant role to play not just in the money end of it,
but in the whole setting of objectives and goals.
   So I'm glad you raised it and, yes, I'm here _ that part of the
trip was strongly to support him, to support other political
leaders, too.
   Q: Mr. President, are you going to appoint an Alabamian on the
TVA Board?
   Bush: Ma'am?
   Q: You have goals for your space initiative. Do you believe
Governor Hunt can help you reach some of those by being so strong
in the Tennessee Valley?
   Bush: Well, I think he's a proponent of the space program that I
have set forth. I think he's got great credibility
   with other governors. If I'm not mistaken, I think he's hosting
the National Governors down here and that'll give him an
opportunity to make the case for space or any other initiatives
for. But he is seen by other governors to know what he is talking
about in this area and clearly to be a strong proponent. So I guess
the bottom line is, yes, I think Governor Hunt here can be helpful
to our objectives of terms of a vibrant space program.
   Q: Mr. President, are you going to nominate or appoint Governor
Hunt's nominee to the TVA Board?
   Bush: Well, I don't know that I'm going to carry my enthusiasm
that far, but _ (laughter) _ he's made a strong case for a person
that he believes in and he did it in his typical way, typical of
Guy Hunt, right direct. He told me exactly why he favored a certain
nominee, and then seemed to be saying, ``Look. I recognize that you
have a lot of factors to weigh in this decision.''
   But I leave here understanding exactly why he has taken the
position he has and I leave it _ and the position has respect and
I'm not prepared to discuss further what I might or might not do in
this TVA _ you're talking about the TVA appointment.
   Q: Can you say how long it's going to take you to make an
appointment?
   Bush: A matter of days. (Laughter.)
   Reporters: Thank you.
   Bush: Thank you all very much.

<HEAD>Fierce Fighting Around Rebel Airbase in Sri Lanka, Dozens Dead</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foot soldiers and government
helicopters destroyed rebel bunkers around a key airbase Wednesday
and naval gunboats blasted a seafront hotel housing guerrilla
artillery. Officials reported dozens killed.
   Sri Lanka's soldiers also repulsed another attack on a garrison
in Jaffna, the rebel stronghold in the north, fighting fierce
hand-to-hand battles with rebel forces, the officials said.
   Rebels used bulldozers in an attempt to knock down the walls of
the garrison, which is in a 200-year-old Dutch fort. At one point,
military officials said, a young Tamil rebel strapped with
explosives tried to scale the fort's walls but he was shot and
killed, the military said.
   At least 29 militants and four soldiers were killed in fighting
in the north, the main flashpoint of the 11-day-old war between
government forces and the Tamil militia, a Defense Ministry
statement said.
   Military officials said rebel resistance in the east, another
flashpoint, has been overcome and guerrillas have retreated into
jungles. But the officials added the retreat may be a tactical move
and that the guerrillas appear to be digging in for a protracted
jungle war.
   More than 1,000 people have been killed since the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebels repudiated a year-long cease-fire with
the government on June 10 and overran police stations in the
Tamil-dominated north and the east.
   The casualties include 278 policemen shot to death by the
rebels, said a senior military official who cannot be named under
briefing rules. He said the victims were among the 850 policemen
captured by the Tigers in the east since June 11.
   On Wednesday, the military launched a major attack from the
Palali military airfield, pounding rebel bunkers and fortifications
with helicopters gunships, armored vehicles and infantry. The
Defense Ministry statement said at least 20 militants were killed.
   Four soldiers also were killed and 20 injured, it reported.
   The airfield is outside Jaffna, the headquarters of the militia,
about 185 miles north of Colombo.
   In another attack, helicopter gunships and naval gunboats
destroyed a seafront hotel in Kankesanthurai near Jaffna from where
the rebels were pounding a vital naval port. The Defense Ministry
statement said nine rebels died in that fight.
   The military says 130 security force personnel and 600 rebels
have been killed since fighting began nine days ago.
   There has been no word on the casualties from the Tigers.
   In the east, troops were conducting mopping up operations and
consolidating their position, said the ministry statement.
   Residents in Batticaloa, the largest population center in the
east, said the town was tense and deserted and was being heavily
patrolled by troops.
   The residents, contacted by telephone, said the troops killed a
Tamil woman and her 10-year-old child while advancing into the city.
   The military official said civilian casualties in the east could
be high because initially the army had to attack from the air to
dislodge the rebels.
   There were also unconfirmed reports the rebels had killed a
number of Sinhalese civilians before withdrawing into the jungles
in the east.
   The Defense Ministry statement said 20 soldiers were critically
ill with respiratory problems after rebels hit their camp in Kiran
with mysterious chemical gas bombs.
   The military officials said this is the first time the rebels
have used chemicals in their 7-year-old war for a separate homeland
they want for the Tamil minority in the northeast.
   The rebels took control of all major towns in the northern and
eastern provinces after Indian peacekeeping troops withdrew from
Sri Lanka in March. The withdrawal, made at the request of Sri
Lankan President Ranaisnghe Premadasa, followed an unsuccessful
32-month exercise to disarm the Tigers.
   Premadasa's government at that time was holding peace talks with
the Tigers after calling a truce in May 1989. The talks had not
made much headway when the fighting broke out this week.
   Before the latest hostilities, at least 11,000 people had been
killed since Tamil militants began fighting for an independent
nation in 1983. In 1987, India brokered a peace accord between
Tamil rebels and the government and sent in peacekeeping troops.
   Sri Lanka's Tamils, who make up 18 percent of the country's 16
million people, claim they are discriminated against by the
Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the population.

<HEAD>Mayors End Meeting With Fresh Attack On Washington, Signs of
Potential Split</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's mayors on Wednesday ended their annual
meeting united in a rhetorical assault on Congress and the White
House but divided somewhat over the best way to lobby for federal
support.
   Republican mayors were installed in two of the top three posts
of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. The new president, Republican
Robert Isaac of Colorado Springs, spoke in a conciliatory tone in
offering cooperation between the mayors and the White House.
   ``We want to restore the partnership,'' Isaac said. ``We're not
going to get anywhere by continually bashing the administration and
Congress.''
   But several Democratic mayors, led by conference Vice President
Raymond Flynn of Boston, said that, unless President Bush offers
significant help to cities soon, it was no time for mayors to duck
a confrontation.
   ``This is a time to rock the boat. This is not a time to go
along to get along,'' Flynn said at a news conference after the
mayors endorsed an array of policy statements calling on the
federal government to make major new investments in city housing,
education, anti-drug and other programs.
   The mayors also took aim at Congress, saying that the virtual
lock incumbents have on their jobs has allowed the lawmakers to
ignore the plight of urban America.
   ``They don't feel much vulnerablity,'' said Kansas City Mayor
Richard Berkley, who was among the mayors who said that city
leaders need to use their political might to win back the support
of Congress.
   ``The power is in the ballot box,'' said Flynn.
   The most colorful rhetoric came from Altanta Mayor Maynard
Jackson, who chastised Congress and the White House for using the
federal deficit as an excuse to deny aid to cities.
   Jackson said programs enacted in Washington force mayors into
the trenches to deal with drugs, homelessness and other problems
but that the lack of federal money makes it a lonely fight.
   ``We get no paddles, no oars, no sails, no rudder, no nothing,''
Jackson said. ``We're entitled to help from the federal government.
... Weak leadership will have to be replaced.''
   Isaac is widely respected among the Democrats but several this
week expressed worries that partisan pressure will keep him from
forcefully pressing the mayors' agenda.
   Isaac assured his colleagues that would not be the case,
admitting he has differences with the big-city Democrats who
dominate the conference but promising to rally behind the policies
endorsed by the group.
   Democratic Charleston, S.C., Mayor Joseph Riley, a soft-spoken
but powerful voice in the conference, offered praise for Isaac, who
proved deft in addressing Democrats's concerns without directly
criticizing the Republican Bush administration.
   ``You won't see Bob Isaac being strident or overly partisan in
attacks on the administration,'' Riley said. ``But he will present
the case strongly, in a gentlemanly fashion. We have others who can
be more partisan if necessary.''
   Flynn, who aggressively courts his fellow mayors for support,
left little doubt he was happy to supply the partisanship.
   ``I will not sit idly by,'' said Flynn, who is in line to become
president of the group next year. ``We're not going to sit by idly
and allow the kind of lip service we receive from the Congress and
read-my-lips service we receive from the administration to shatter
our cities.''

   The South sweltered Wednesday while many parts of the nation got
saturated.
   Heavy rains caused flooding in Illinois, where a rescue worker
was dragged off a collapsed bridge and was missing Wednesday, and
vicious storms pummeled parts of Kansas, where 30 people were hurt,
but only one seriously.
   Authorities in Shadyside, Ohio, urged about 150 people to
evacuate because of approaching storms, and a body found in the
Ohio River brought the death toll from last week's flash flood to
22.
   Heat advisories were posted across Louisiana and western
Tennessee, and the mercury soared in Florida, where temperatures
were expected to remain high during the next several days.
   Several cities tied or set record highs for the date. Daytona
Beach, Fla., tied its 98-degree record, set in 1944; Macon, Ga.,
reached 102, breaking the 100 mark set in 1970; and Savannah, Ga.,
broke the 1984 record of 101 by one degree.
   Rainshowers and thunderstorms continued Wednesday afternoon,
extending from central and northeast Oklahoma across northern
Arkansas, much of Missouri, Illinois, southeast Wisconsin,
southwest Lower Michigan, Indiana and central through southern Ohio.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered in west-central and
southern Florida, northern and east-central New England, across
eastern Lake Ontario, from northwest Minnesota into eastern North
Dakota, and northwest Montana and the Idaho Panhandle.
   Wednesday morning's low for the nation was 32 degrees at
Gunnison, Colo.
   The nation's temperatures at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55 degrees
at Caribou, Maine, to 111 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.

<HEAD>Egg Producers To Vote On Research Program Refunds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Egg producers will vote next month on whether
to eliminate refunds permanently under a federal research and
promotion program, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   Daniel D. Haley, administrator of the department's Agricultural
Marketing Service, said ballots will be mailed by July 16 to all
producers of record.
   All commercial egg producers owning more than 30,000 laying hens
during the period Jan. 1 through March 31, 1990, except those
producing mostly hatching eggs, will be eligible to vote.
   In 1988 Congress amended the Egg Research and Consumer
Information Act to suspend refunds for 18 months beginning Jan. 1,
1989, pending results of a national referendum.
   For the new provision to be adopted, approval would have to come
from at least two-thirds of those voting this summer, or a majority
of producers representing at least two-thirds of the volume of eggs
produced by all voters.
   If adopted, producers will continue to pay mandatory,
non-refundable assessments of five cents per 30-dozen case of
commercial eggs to the American Egg Board for research, promotion
and consumer education programs.
   Exemptions would continue for producers with flocks of 30,000 or
fewer hens, and for all Alaskan and Hawaiian egg producers.
   Currently, the assessments raise about $7.2 million annually,
the agency said.

   In what could prove public TV's first cable
venture, The Discovery Channel, the Public Broadcasting Service and
two major PBS stations said Wednesday they'll study the idea of
starting a cable program service.
   The new service would be devoted to education, but show programs
of its own and not those appearing on either Discovery or PBS, said
Eric McLamb, a spokesman for Discovery.
   Discovery, based in Landover, Md., is a leading cable
programming service. It serves 50.9 million homes, McLamb said.
   The public TV stations participating in the study are WNET-TV
here and WGBH-TV in Boston. They, PBS and Discovery will make a
feasibility study of a jointly-owned cable service and may have a
report in 90 days, McLamb said.
   PBS president Bruce L. Christensen announced the study to public
TV officials meeting Wednesday at the annual PBS affiliates'
convention in Dallas.
   Discovery chairman John Hendricks, in a separate statement, said
the goal of his company and PBS is to ``develop an educational
service that complements and does not compete with the valuable
broadcast service service provided by local public television
stations.''
   PBS says it has 337 affiliates.

<HEAD>Australia, New Zealand Warn of Growing Damage to Ozone Layer</HEAD>
<HEAD>By SYDNEY RUBIN</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Australia and New Zealand on Wednesday presented
new evidence of increasing damage to the earth's protective ozone
layer at an international environmental conference.
   Scientists from the two countries have discovered a 15 percent
drop in ozone during the last three years over Macquarie Island,
800 miles southeast of Tasmania.
   The conference, attended by senior scientists and officials from
more than 100 nations, is considering a ban on ozone-depleting
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). The conference is preparing the
groundwork for a June 27-29 meeting of environment ministers from
56 countries.
   Also Wednesday, Britain's Stratospheric Ozone Review Group said
in a separate report that the fragile ozone layer is declining in
mid-latitudes over North America and Europe. The report said major
cutbacks in CFCs, which are mostly used in refrigerators and
air-conditioners, would slow the damage.
   ``Stratospheric chlorine is expected to continue to increase at
levels higher than previously experienced. There is a risk that
these might trigger disproportionately larger ozone losses,'' the
report said.
   The Australian results were released to ``inject a sense of
urgency back into the proceedings,'' a conference source said.
   Dr. Mostafa Tolba, executive director of the United Nations
Environment Program, appealed for international cooperation on the
issue.
   ``No country, no region, no group will ever be capable of
solving any of these problems alone. It is a must that north and
south, east and west cooperate,'' Tolba said. ``Failure is not an
option, success is imperative.''
   The meeting is a sequel to the 1987 Montreal Protocol
conference, which agreed to halve the world consumption of
chlorofluorocarbons by the end of the century.
   Fifty-six countries have signed the protocol, considered a
watershed in ``green diplomacy.'' It marked the first time nations
agreed to protect the global environment against future dangers. It
also committed nations to targets before the technology was
available to achieve them.
   Five months after the agreement was reached there was mounting
scientific evidence of the threat to the ozone layer and most
signatories said the protocol was inadequate.
   ``If we had known in Montreal what we know in London, we would
have then drawn up a much stronger treaty with much faster
phase-out of CFCs and halons,'' Tolba said.
   Tolba on Wednesday proposed completely eliminating CFCs and
halon by the end of the century; adding carbon tetrachloride to the
list of ozone-depleting chemicals; and cutting production and use
of methyl chloroform by the year 2000.
   Chlorine gases, used mainly in refrigeration systems and
aerosols, damage the ozone layer that protects life from
ultraviolet rays. A 1989 U.N. report confirmed ozone depletion had
started, posing significant threats to food production, ocean life
and human health.
   In addition to increasing the risk of skin cancers, exposure to
ultraviolet rays could cause suppression of the human immune system
and lead to a rise in infectious diseases, the report said.
   CFCs also are major contributors to global warming.
   But eliminating CFCs is costly for developing nations and many,
including populous China and India, have not signed the protocol. A
Chinese delegate said use of CFCs in his country was growing 12
percent yearly and would cost $42 million over three years to phase
out the chemicals.
   Last week, the Bush administration announced it was willing to
contribute $25 million to a fund to assist developing nations to
eliminate CFCs.

   Nelson Mandela's admirers stayed away from work,
skipped school and ducked out at lunch Wednesday to greet ``the
last of the black heroes'' with clenched fists and open hearts.
   From Kennedy Airport to City Hall, hundreds of thousands of
people of many races lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the
black South African leader.
   ``Just look around, it's white-black-white-black-white-black,''
businessman Tom Kellerhals said of the crowd that turned out along
Broadway in lower Manhattan. ``Sometimes the answer is in front of
us.''
   Mandela's ride through a storm of confetti in Broadway's
``Canyon of Heroes'' was the day's emotional apex. People who
waited for hours after Mandela's parade was delayed could not
contain themselves when he finally arrived in the early afternoon.
   ``The greatest freedom fighter ever!'' exulted Derrick Fuller as
Mandela rolled by in his glass-enclosed ``Mandelamobile.''
   ``We have him like a lion in a cage,'' chortled one man, as
ticker tape and other debris piled up around his ankles.
   Fathers hoisted sons on their shoulders to catch a glimpse of
the passing hero, and women thrust forward uncomprehending babies
as if they were cameras. There were cries of ``Man-del-a!'' and
``Keep the pressure on.''
   A group of elementary school children chanted ``Welcome
Mandela,'' and across the street a group of adults would answer,
``No more apartheid.''
   At City Hall, where Mandela accepted the key to the city, city
employees hung a sign out a third-floor window: ``We Shall
Conquer.''
   ``I've seen people crying and shouting, but never anything like
this,'' said Gov. Mario Cuomo. ``It was the single most memorable
thing I've ever witnessed.''
   Leslie Anderson, 27, of Plainfield, N.J., took the day off to
see the man she called ``a legend. ... I was too young to see
Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. He's the last of the great black
heroes.''
   ``We don't live in apartheid. But it's here. It's real,'' she
continued. ``New York is a prime example. Think of Bensonhurst,''
where a black youth was slain by a white mob last year.
   She wore a T-shirt which said ``Free South Africa'' with an
image of a black man with a noose around his neck pulled by a white
man. On the back her shirt said: ``It's a Black thing you wouldn't
understand.''
   But standing a few feet away was Fred Marks, a white businessman
who also had come out to see Mandela.
   ``I think any man who spent 27 years in jail deserves a look,''
Marks said. Referring to Ms. Anderson's T-shirt, he said,
``Something like this transcends color.''
   A father-and-son guitar duo sat under a tree nearby, playing the
blues.
   ``Me and my father wrote a little something about Mandela and
Dinkins meeting, about the Mandelas in New York,'' said Ted
Williams r. ``It's happy. It's nice. You can do the chicken dance
to it.''
   Most of those who skipped work declined to be interviewed for
the record, but one man agreed to appear on television. Asked what
he would tell his boss if he was spotted, he said: ``I'm gonna say
two words: `Nelson Mandela.'''
   Sean Smith, a foreign currency options broker, saw irony in the
parade's location: ``This is the biggest laughable thing that ever
happened, that Wall Street supported apartheid and turned around
and threw a ticker-tape parade.''
   Not everyone was impressed with the visit. A young black man
named Wayne Moore squatted at Broadway and Liberty Street, shining
the shoes of a well-dressed white man. ``Shine 'em up!'' he yelled
as he buffed. ``Shine em up!''
   Moore had come to this corner, he explained, because ``I heard
Mandela was coming down today, so there'd be a big crowd and I'd
make more money.''
   ``Do I think he could change my situation?'' he said, repeating
a question. ``Kinda hard to think that.''

<HEAD>Automakers, Insurers Clash On Copyrighting Auto Part Design</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Automakers and insurers traded accusations of
greed and portrayed themselves as the consumer's friend Wednesday
in a debate over copyright protection for product designs.
   The auto industry urged Congress to approve legislation that
would prohibit independent manufacturers from copying a part's
original design for a decade after it first appears on the market.
   The bills would protect consumers from shoddy imitation parts,
auto lobbyists told the House Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual
Property and Administration of Justice.
   ``Imitation sheet metal parts are often of lesser quality in
fit, finish and durability,'' said Kenneth W. Myers of Ford Motor
Co.
   He spoke on behalf of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers
Association, which represents the Big Three U.S. automakers.
   Opponents, led by insurers, said the legislation was designed to
squelch competition in the lucrative replacement parts industry,
which generated $52 billion in sales in 1988. The price of parts
will soar if the bills are passed, they said.
   ``American consumers will have to pay hundreds of millions of
dollars a year in monopoly profits to ... auto manufacturers and
they will get nothing in return,'' said C.A. Ingham, vice president
of State Farm Insurance Co.
   The subcommittee is considering three bills dealing with
intellectual property rights. But most of the testimony focused on
a bill co-sponsored by House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt,
D-Mo., and Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill.
   It would allow manufacturers to secure copyrights on their
product designs similar to the protection available to artists and
writers.
   The copyrights would be easier to obtain than design patents,
which are granted only for ``new, original and ormantental design''
after a cumbersome application process that can last years, Myers
said.
   Automakers invest heavily in designing and testing parts. ``Each
part is designed to enhance overall aesthetics and also must
function properly as part of the whole vehicle,'' Myers said.
   Competing parts manufacturers do not have to make such
investments, he said. They just copy the original design and make
imitation products that often are of poor quality, he said.

   A rescue boat carrying British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher on Wednesday dashed to the aid of a
yacht battling high seas off southwest England.
   Thatcher had just witnessed a 10-minute Royal Navy air-sea
rescue demonstration from aboard the 44-foot Faithful Forester when
the lifeboat was called into action.
   She watched from the cabin as the crew delivered a salvage pump
to the 32-foot sloop Slipshod, which was taking on water a
half-mile from the entrance to Fowey harbor, in eastern Cornwall.
   ``There was a yacht in trouble with a loose keel so we went out
to see if it was all right,'' Mrs. Thatcher said.
   Gary Heward, 24, from Southampton, one of the Slipshod's
five-man crew, said: ``We did not know anything about the prime
minister until afterwards. I did not even look in the lifeboat.''

   A House Republican accused Speaker Thomas S.
Foley on Wednesday of ``kowtowing to ilk like the Communist Youth
Brigade'' by refusing to delay until next week Thursday's showdown
vote on a constitutional amendment to prohibit flag burning.
   Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., later apologized for the remark and
it was stricken from the record. But the exchange reflected the
general bitterness and tension over the issue on the eve of the
vote. Both opponents and proponents of the amendment said the
proposal likely would not muster the necessary two-thirds margin.
   Supporters of the amendment, who since last year had been
pushing Foley to allow the vote, sought a delay to give veterans'
groups more time to organize a mass mail campaign in the
amendment's favor. They also wanted the showdown to come closer to
the Fourth of July.
   Republicans pressed the White House, meanwhile, to get President
Bush to do more private, one-on-one lobbying in behalf of the
measure, which he has repeatedly endorsed publicly.
   The Supreme Court a year ago ruled that flag burning was
protected by the constitutional guarantee of free speech. It
reaffirmed that decision last week in rejecting a congressional
attempt to overcome the earlier ruling without resorting to
changing the Constitution.
   ``We fail to see why it is so necessary to rush this legislation
to a vote on Thursday,'' complained Walter G. Hogan, national
commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars.
   Foley, D-Wash., an outspoken opponent of the amendment, said
``This bill has been before the Congress for over a year. It has
been debated and discussed as much as any other legislative
proposal in this Congress. I don't understand why that is a
problem.''
   Foley also cited a comment by Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., the
House Minority Whip, who said for a Republican campaigner the best
outcome might be to lose by one vote. That would keep the flag
issue alive and more relevant in individual races.
   ``All this talk about being concerned about the flag, they are
concerned, apparently, about the political issue and the political
opportunities,'' Foley said. ``I don't think the American people
are going to respond favorably to that.''
   But Solomon, in a speech on the House floor, said Foley and the
Democratic leadership were ``deliberately gagging 10 million
veterans through this nation'' at the same time they were
``kowtowing to ilk like the Communist Youth Brigade to allow them
to trample and desecrate the American Flag.''
   Solomon's comments drew heated protests from the Democratic side
of the aisle, forcing him to apologize and his words were struck
from the record.
   Later, in a meeting of the House Rules Committee, Solomon and
other Republicans pleaded for the scheduling panel to grant a delay
but even Democrats who support the amendment seemed eager to get
the vote done.
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said the expedited procedure ill
behooved Democrats and he warned Republicans could make hay of the
fact they ``hustled this bill through.''
   ``You don't need that burden,'' he said.
   ``Justice delayed is justice denied,'' quipped Rep. Jack Brooks,
D-Texas, chairman of The House Judiciary Committee.
   If all 433 current House members vote Thursday, 289 will be
required for passage or, conversely, 145 needed to block it.
   Leadership sources said Wednesday that Democrats were becoming
more confident they could muster the blocking votes from their
party, and between 12 and 15 Republicans might vote against the
amendment as well.
   The Senate is also expected to consider the amendment before the
end of next week, but it would be a moot point if the House rejects
the measure. A two-thirds vote from both chambers, followed by
approval by 38 states, is required for the amendment to become part
of the Constitution.
   In addition to the constitutional amendment, the House was
expected to vote Thursday on a new statute to ban flag burning.
   The statute, more narrowly drawn than the one overturned by the
Supreme Court last week, would set jail terms and fines for
destroying a flag belonging to the federal government or on federal
land, or to promote violence by destroying any flag.
   The bill, introduced Wednesday by Reps. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn.,
Rick Boucher, D-Va., and Ron Wyden, D-Ore., would attack flag
burning during the period before an amendment could take effect.
   It also fit into Foley's strategy on the amendment, giving those
who oppose tinkering with the Bill of Rights an alternative they
could support.
   Gingrich labeled the proposed statute was a ``liberal fig leaf''
which the American people would quickly see through.
   Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said if the
House rejected the constitutional amendment, he hoped the Senate
would approve it and send it back to the House for a second vote,
``to give the House one more chance to come through for Old Glory.''

   Some call it the odd couple.
   ``What are Pearl Bailey and Wynton Marsalis going to do
together?'' wonders George Wein, who paired the veteran singer and
young trumpeter for a June 27 concert during the JVC Jazz Festival.
   Wein said he was interested in the concerts' content and pleased
at ticket sales as this year's festival kicks off on Friday.
   ``I'm interested to see what Stan Getz does with a whole evening
of his quartet and sextet,'' Wein says. ``He's such a genius; we've
never presented him for a whole evening. It should be very
interesting.''
   Getz's June 29 concert is titled ``50 Years in Music.'' But Wein
expects Getz, instead of starting with early colleagues, to play in
the first half with his usual quartet and augment it with a few
veterans in the second half.
   Miles Davis and the group Hiroshima will pack Lincoln Center's
Avery Fisher Hall in two concerts on opening night, and Ella
Fitzgerald is expected to sell out her June 29th performance, even
though she gave a concert a few months ago at Radio City Music Hall.
   ``We always sell a lot of tickets the last week,'' Wein said.
``Everything seems to be going along very well. We're selling at
the same speed as last year, which was a relatively good year.
   ``It's interesting that the two shows we're doing at Town Hall,
bassist Milt Hinton celebrating his 80th birthday (June 23) and a
salute to guitarist Jim Hall (June 26) seem to be doing better than
any Town Hall shows we've ever done.''
   Most of the concerts are at Carnegie Hall and Avery Fisher Hall.
   ``Where we have trouble is whenever we try something different,
like (minimalist composer Steve) Reich is a problem,'' Wein says.
Reich and the World Saxophone Quartet share a June 23 bill.
   ``The things that sell, sell,'' Wein says. ``The things that
don't, don't.''
   Pianist Oscar Peterson canceled his June 28 evening. ``The
doctor told him he was exhausted and should take six weeks off,''
Wein says.
   Sarah Vaughan had been booked for the festival when she died
this spring. There won't be a tribute to the singer this year, Wein
said. ``We'll do something next year. I don't like to do those
tributes so fast. I like to plan and do them so they're historic
evenings.''
   The JVC Jazz Festival, sponsored by the Japanese electronics
firm for which it is named, runs in New York through June 30, then
goes to Saratoga Springs, N.Y.

   Former Communist Ion Iliescu pledged
Wednesday to be a democratic president of reconciliation, but the
United States boycotted his inauguration to protest his role in
violent attacks on opposition figures.
   The capital was generally quiet following a tumultuous week of
anti-government riots, mob rule by loyalist miners and a crackdown
on dissent.
   ``This is the happiest day of my life,'' Iliescu told reporters,
before swearing ``faithfulness to the Romanian people and to their
ideals of freedom and prosperity.''
   He pledged ``to defend democracy (and) ... fundamental human
rights and freedoms.''
   ``I shall firmly militate for the safeguarding of civic
liberties ... on our way to a genuinely free and democratic
society,'' Iliescu said, pledging to be a ``president ... of
reconciliation.''
   Pro-Iliescu supporters cheered him when he emerged from the
downtown, fin-de-siecle Atheneum music hall after his inauguration.
   Iliescu's inauguration came one week to the day after riot
police brutally dispersed a 53-day rally of his opponents demanding
that he and other former Communists be banned from politics for 10
years.
   Rioters subsequently assaulted and firebombed government
buildings, and thousands of club-wielding miners from Transylvania
descended on the capital in response to an appeal by Iliescu,
attacking opposition politicians and anyone deemed a government
critic.
   Numerous countries and international human rights groups
condemned the violence and its links to the National Salvation
Front-dominated government. Some governments have suspended
non-humanitarian aid.
   Petre Roman, who was formally appointed prime minister by
Iliescu after serving as interim premier since December, tried to
ease foreign concerns.
   He told state radio: ``We want to prove to the international
community that our way to a true democracy is irreversible.''
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
human rights violations in Romania are continuing. He said Romania
has arrested 45 opposition figures in the past two days, and said
the administration believes the purpose is to intimidate Romanians
from exercising their rights.
   Ambassadors from Canada and countries of the 12-nation European
Economic Community attended the inaugural ceremony, but echoed U.S.
criticism.
   Iliescu expressed disappointment with the U.S. stance.
   ``We want to think it is an isolated incident and that the
conclusions will be accordingly corrected following a lucid
judgment on the events,'' he said in a statement to the state
Rompres news agency.
   Ion Ratiu, the National Peasants' Party's presidential candidate
who finished a distant third to Iliescu, applauded the U.S. boycott
and called it ``the most eloquent way the U.S. could show its
condemnation of the vigilante tactics that Mr. Iliescu generated
last week.''
   Commenting at length on last week's violence, Iliescu publicly
distanced himself for the first time from the miners' subsequently
vigilante tactics.
   ``There was over-reaction in the public order restoration
process,'' he said. ``Institutions, (opposition) party headquarters
and homes were broken into, and citizens unconnected with the
earlier (violence) ... were roughed up.
   ``We unequivocally dissociate ourselves from all actions that
transcended the legal framework,'' Iliescu declared.
   However, he also asserted that the anti-government violence that
brought the miners was ``an organized coup d'etat.''
   He described the events as a ``true rebellion ... aimed at
discrediting the country's lawfully and democratically elected
leadership at home and abroad.''
   The 60-year-old Iliescu, a high-ranking Communist in the late
1960s, pledged to transform his formerly Communist nation into a
full political democracy with a market economy incorporating mixed
forms of ownership.
   He vowed to remove ``disgraced, corrupt and incompetent
persons,'' in an apparent bow to an opposition concern that people
compromised by serving deposed Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu
continue in responsible positions.
   Some critics have included in that category Iliescu and other
former Communists in the National Salvational Front who were
criticial of Ceausescu, despite their renunciation of communism and
clear victory in free elections May 20.
   The government has appeared divided on the best course of action
to quell further unrest.
   Officials were talking to opposition groups while detaining
their leaders and authorizing police action to stop renewed protest.
   Bucharest was free of demonstrations during the day Wednesday,
but about 80 protesters gathered as dusk fell at University Square.
The chanted ``Down with Iliescu!'' and knelt briefly in prayer.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev came under fire
from hard-line Communists on Wednesday and acknowledged that he
could lose his party post at a national congress in less than two
weeks.
   Critics at a party meeting castigated the national leadership.
They did not mention Gorbachev by name but said they did not think
one person should be Soviet president and general secretary of the
Communist Party. Gorbachev holds both jobs.
   ``It is impossible to run the party, this guiding force, without
devoting full time to it,'' said Yegor Ligachev, the most prominent
Soviet hard-liner. He spoke at a meeting called to found a new
Communist Party of the Russian Federation, the largest of the 15
Soviet republics.
   Another Communist leader said he expected Gorbachev to be
nominated for the national party's top job at a party congress
starting July 2, but he said he expects other candidates to surface
as well.
   In recent months, Gorbachev has transferred some of the
Communist Party's powers to elected legislative bodies, thereby
protecting himself somewhat from personal political damage that
could result if he lost the party leadership.
   Moreover, he was elected in March to a five-year term in the new
post of president and has wielded considerable power in that job.
   The 28th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party is to consider
structural changes and elect a leader when it convenes July 2.
   The 2,700 delegates to the current Russian conference will also
attend the national congress, where they will form a majority of
the 4,700 votes.
   The mood of the Russian congress was decidedly conservative and
critical of Gorbachev.
   ``Really important miscalculations and serious mistakes were
made in the tactics and methods and approaches to the
transformations'' under way in the Soviet Union, said Ligachev.
   ``The Socialist community has disintegrated, while the positions
of imperialism have been dramatically consolidated,'' said
Ligachev. His remarks were reported by the state news agency Tass.
   Gorbachev has acknowledged making mistakes, but he said in a
speech to delegates Wednesday that his accusers were poorly
informed and disrespectful.
   ``The comrades seem to suspect the general secretary of the
Communist Party of some vacillation, hesitation, and so forth,''
Gorbachev said angrily.
   ``Some of the comrades are being too casual with the general
secretary, with the president of the country,'' he said.
   ``It is not a question of me, personally,'' he said. ``Tomorrow,
or after 10 days or 12 days, there may be another general secretary
or chairman of the party. Before expressing opinions, and
especially accusations, you have to know a whole lot and understand
it, and not just speak off the cuff.''
   ``Otherwise, if that is going to be the attitude ... toward the
people that we nominate at such turning points in history, then we
will not get anywhere except to chaos,'' he said.
   One leading conservative, Ivan Polozkov, said the falling
credibility of the party stemmed not only from ``mistakes made
during the period of stagnation'' before Gorbachev came to power in
1985.
   ``There have also been mistakes made in the period of
perestroika,'' he said, using the Russian word for Gorbachev's
reforms. He singled out for criticism Alexander Yakovlev, a close
Gorbachev ally on the party's Politburo.
   ``The crisis is not just in the Communist Party, but above all
in its leading bodies,'' said Polozkov.
   Foreign reporters were not allowed to attend Wednesday's
session, but portions of it were shown on closed-circuit television
at the Foreign Ministry press center.
   The party chief for the city of Moscow, Yuri Prokofiev, told
reporters that Gorbachev likely would be one of several candidates
for the job once again of national party leader. He said he hoped
that Gorbachev's comments did not mean he would refuse to run for
the post.
   In another indication of the conservative mood of the congress,
the delegates overwhelmingly condemned a proposal before the
Russian parliament to liquidate party cells in the Armed Forces,
the KGB security police and the regular police force.
   Nikolai Boiko, head of the political department of Soviet
anti-aircraft forces, warned that such a step would ``weaken its
defense potential.''
   By a 2,008-to-398 vote, the congress passed a resolution calling
the proposed liquidation of party cells in security organs ``a step
toward the further disintegration of the party.''
   Such a step ``would lead to a sharp fall in the influence of the
party, would create an anti-communist attitude, and would heighten
the political destabilization of the country,'' it said.
   Later Wednesday, the Russian parliament rejected a proposal to
ban party membership for judges, prosecutors and officials of law
enforcement agencies, Tass reported. Deputies also rejected a call
to eliminate party cells in the Soviet army.

   Convicted drug dealer Charles Lewis testified
at Marion Barry's drug and perjury trial Wednesday that he and the
mayor agreed ``to get our stories straight'' and hide their crack
cocaine use when police began closing in on them.
   Lewis said Barry also told him to drink ``lemon juice and lots
of water'' to obscure results of a possible drug test by police.
   Defense attorney R. Kenneth Mundy swiftly sought to undermine
Lewis' effect on the jury. He displayed a notebook belonging to
Lewis and said it showed the witness was a courier for a Washington
cocaine ring.
   Then, under Mundy's cross examination, Lewis conceded he didn't
begin to cooperate with prosecutors until after he was convicted of
drug charges in the Virgin Islands, where he is awaiting sentencing.
   A key prosecution witness, Lewis has testified he and the mayor
used cocaine frequently between 1986 and 1988 in the Virgin Islands
and the nation's capital.
   Barry, 54, has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine
possession charges, one misdemeanor charge of cocaine conspiracy,
and three felony counts of lying to a grand jury about his alleged
drug use.
   The three-term mayor could face up to 26 years in prison and
fines of $1.85 million if convicted on all counts at the trial,
which is expected to last several weeks.
   Beginning his second day of testimony, Lewis said he and Barry
used crack cocaine three times together in December 1988 at Lewis'
Washington hotel room.
   He said he spoke with Barry by telephone Dec. 22, 1988, after
learning that police were investigating Lewis' actions, about how
to conceal their drug use.
   ``It was ... like fixing a dam,'' said Lewis. He said he and
Barry agreed, ``We have a problem. We need to fix it. We need to
get our stories straight.''
   Lewis destroyed a crack pipe Barry had given him and flushed the
remains down the hotel room toilet, he said.
   Lewis said that the next night Barry asked him on the telephone
to lie to authorities about their drug activity.
   ``He wanted me to tell the police the same thing I had told the
Post reporter,'' said Lewis, who earlier testified that he told a
Washington Post reporter he and Barry had never done drugs.
   Barry also coached him on how to obscure evidence of cocaine use
if police gave him a drug test. ``He told me, `Just use lemon juice
and lots of water,''' Lewis told the court, adding, ``I used a
considerable amount of lemon juice.''
   Barry leaned back in his chair at the defense table and smiled
broadly at the remark.
   Saying he had lied to police and a federal grand jury when he
denied using drugs, Lewis said, ``It was my effort to protect
myself and the mayor.''
   In the days after Barry's visits to Lewis became public, the
mayor denied in several statements to the press that he had used
drugs with Lewis or at any other time.
   Mundy took aim at Lewis' motives in cross-examination.
   ``You didn't start looking around to make deals until you were
convicted, did you,'' Mundy asked. ``You started cooperating with
the government because you wanted to help yourself, didn't you?''
   ``Yes,'' Lewis replied.
   And Mundy said Lewis' notebook showed he was involved in a
cocaine ring with James McWilliams, another potential government
witness.
   Lewis insisted he had not been coached by prosecutors and was
not testifying ``to convict the mayor.''
   Lewis, growing defensive, said he wasn't getting a free ride
from the government.
   ``This agreement that was approved, it wasn't something like a
present,'' complained Lewis, who served a seven-month prison
sentence outside Washington on federal drug charges.
   Police began investigating after Lewis is alleged to have
offered cocaine to a maid at the Washington hotel.
   Lewis said he learned from a reporter that city police had
aborted a planned undercover drug buy from him the afternoon of
Dec. 22, 1988 after they learned Barry was in the hotel room.
   Lewis testified that he and the mayor spoke in code about
sticking to the same story because Lewis feared his telephone was
bugged.
   He said he told the mayor that he had told a Washington Post
reporter ``there were no drugs in the room. He (Barry) said, `No,
that's right.'''
   Lewis then asserted he did not use drugs. ```No, none,''' Lewis
said Barry replied.
   Lewis said he then added, ``You don't use drugs either, and he
(Barry) said, `No, right, I don't.'''

<TEXT>
   A bill that could send doctors who
perform abortions to jail for 10 years was sent to the Louisiana
Senate without recommendation Wednesday after a committee
deadlocked on the measure.
   If passed, the measure would be the toughest state abortion law
in the nation.
   With only six members of the seven-member Health and Welfare
Committee present Wednesday, motions aimed at approving or killing
the bill failed on 3-3 ties.
   The full Senate later voted 35-4 to consider the bill in debate.
The debate _ and a vote on final passage _ could come as early as
next week.
   The bill has no exceptions for women who become pregnant as a
result of rape or incest. Gov. Buddy Roemer has said he will veto
the bill without those exceptions.
   The bill's author, state Rep. Woody Jenkins, said such
exceptions would jeopardize plans to use the bill to attempt to
overturn Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision establishing
women's abortion rights.
   Jenkins said Louisiana abortion law has never recognized rape or
incest as legal reasons for abortion. ``It's possible that the
court might really recognize this as an inconsistent position,'' he
told the committee.
   Much of the testimony at the committee hearing was a rehash of
arguments made in more than eight hours of previous hearings.
   A woman who said she once operated an abortion clinic in Texas
urged passage of Jenkins' bill.
   ``Abortion is not about rights, abortion is not about choices,
abortion is not about rape or incest. Abortion is about money,''
said Carol Everette, who said she could have been a millionaire had
she stayed on with the clinic.
   Dr. Diana Dell, a Baton Rouge physician, said making abortions
illegal would only drive women to seek unsafe, illegal abortions.
She said death rates from tonsillectomies and apendectomies far
exceed deaths from legal abortions.
   Dell said she abhorred the use of abortion as simple birth
control. But, she said, the health and welfare of a woman with an
unwanted pregnancy must take precedence over that of a fetus.
   ``The fetus is the future. It does not have equal rights to the
here and now,'' Dell said.

   The fire aboard the USS Midway, the Navy's
oldest active aircraft carrier, raises haunting questions for the
service about its safety record and the wisdom of keeping aging
warships at sea, defense analysts said Wednesday.
   The 45-year-old ship, extensively overhauled during its career
including a three-year renovation from 1967 to 1970, is scheduled
to be retired next year.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney announced during his visit to
Japan in February that the Midway, whose home port is Yokosuka,
would be replaced by the 31-year-old USS Independence, like the
Midway an oil-burning carrier.
   The incident on the Midway, the last of three nearly identical
sister ships still on active duty, could hurry that schedule along,
Navy sources and independent defense analysts said.
   ``There may be an adjustment to the timetable, but they'll have
to assess the damage first,'' said a senior Navy officer, who spoke
on condition he not be mentioned by name.
   Joshua Handler, a research associate with the environmental
advocacy group Greenpeace and a critic of the Navy's nuclear
weapons policies, said fires aboard carriers are a particular
concern given chances nuclear weapons are most probably aboard.
   ``They've had trouble with the Midway for so long, this may be
the straw that breaks the camel's back,'' he said. ``It's time is
well up, and I'm sorry that this sort of thing had to happen to
make the point.''
   After the 1970 overhaul, it was discovered that so much weight
had been added in high-tech equipment that the 67,000-ton vessel
rode dangerously low in the water.
   Six-hundred-foot-long compartments were added to each side to
increase buoyancy and and let the ship ride higher in the water.
This modifcation made the ship's natural roll quicker, making it
harder to operate aircraft.
   The stability of a ship is crucial when the ship's F-14 jet
fighters or A-6E attack planes slam onto its deck traveling at more
than 100 mph.
   Navy spokesman Cmdr. Jim Mitchell said the Midway fire
apparently was confined to ``a rather small area'' in compartments
that store firefighting and emergency repair equipment.
   All sailors on board ship are trained to fight fires at special
schools in Norfolk, Va., and San Diego, Calif., to help deal with
such emergencies, he said.
   ``We train our people in damage control. It's not because we
expect problems, but these things do happen given the hazardous
nature of a ship's operations. At sea, you can't call for the fire
department _ every sailor is the fire department,'' he said.
   The Navy's safety record has come under intense scrutiny in the
wake of last year's explosion aboard the USS Iowa, in which 47
sailors lost their lives.
   Following a six-week string of mishaps last fall, the Navy
ordered all ships and planes to undergo a 48-hour ``stand-down'' to
review safety procedures.
   The service maintains that its safety record has improved over
the past decade, with its best safety records compiled in 1988 and
1989.
   Five years ago there were 101 major accidents involving surface
ships, aircraft and submarines. In 1989 there were 69 and in 1990
so far there have been 23, the Navy said.
   In calender 1989, the service recorded 104 deaths in training
and operations, a number which includes the Iowa 47. So far this
year, nine fatalities have occurred, the Navy said.
   During the Reagan administration, the Navy once had plans for a
600-ship Navy, and it did grow to 585. It has 15 carrier battle
groups. Fourteen groups are deployed at any one time with one
carrier always in overhaul.
   Now, a much smaller Navy is in store amid the lessening Soviet
threat and budget pressures. One day before the Midway fire broke
out, Cheney revealed that a possible 25 percent cut in the nation's
force structure would reduce the Navy to 455 warships and an even
dozen deployed carrier groups.
   Some on Capitol Hill have pressed for even deeper cuts in the
carrier fleet.
   The influential chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., has recommended as few as 10.
   ``You hurt people by keeping men on these things,'' contended
David Isenberg, an analyst with the Center for Defense Information
who wrote a critical study of carrier battle groups for the
independent research group, the Cato Institute, which generally
advocates conservative positions.
   Isenberg argues that building new carriers at $3.3 billion each,
plus associated costs for planes and escorts, is not the most
efficient use of the Navy's funds in the post-Cold War era.
   ``Carriers have rendered enormous service to the nation and
still have a role to perform,'' he said. But he argues that the
Navy should make more use of attack submarines in order to
``achieve a mix of capabilities in which less emphasis is place on
power projection and more on sea control.''

<HEAD>Domestic Air Travel Levels Off, But Strong Growth Still Predicted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of passengers taking domestic U.S.
flights has leveled off over the last three years, after years of
increasing travel, an industry report said Wednesday.
   The report, however, predicted huge growth in air travel by the
end of the century.
   Passengers flying within the United States increased only 1
percent in 1989 while the number of passengers boarding
international flights from U.S. airports rose 11 percent, the
Airport Operators Council International said.
   ``Our traffic results for 1989 might indicate a slight weakening
in the growth rate of aviation for the year, but we foresee a 61
percent increase in passenger traffic by 2000,'' said George
Howard, AOCI president.
   An accompanying report by the Partnership for Improved Air
Travel said aviation's contribution to the economy hit nearly $600
billion in 1989, a 13.8 percent increase over the last study which
covered 1987. The most dramatic growth was in commercial aircraft
manufacturing, where jobs, payrolls and other economic factors rose
22 percent.
   Aviation's share of the gross national product remained at 5.6
percent, said the partnership, a wide-ranging group set up to
ensure that U.S. aviation meets future demands.
   Reports by the two aviation organizations were released at a
joint news conference.
   Howard blamed slow overall economic growth, higher fares and the
Eastern Airlines strike for the stalled growth in domestic
passengers. He said tight capacity at larger airports also may be
hindering growth in traffic.
   The AOCI's annual traffic report on each of the world's major
airports showed three of the highest-density airports _ New York's
Kennedy and LaGuardia and Washington's National _ actually lost
traffic in 1989.
   Chicago's O'Hare had just a 0.6 percent increase but remained
the world's busiest airport with more than 59 million passengers
boarding flights last year, the report said.
   Dallas-Fort Worth surpassed Los Angeles and Atlanta for second
place. Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport fell to fourth, primarily
because of the strike against Eastern, which uses Atlanta as a hub,
Howard said.
   The AOCI report showed New York, with three major airports,
continued to be the world's most heavily traveled market, followed
by Chicago and London.
   Altogether, six of the top 10 American airports lost traffic in
1989, while airports around the Pacific Rim reported a 13.8 percent
increase and European airports a 7 percent increase, according to
the report.
   Federal Aviation Administration figures compiled by AOCI show
415.6 million passengers for domestic flights in 1989 and 415.5
million in 1987. The figure dipped to 414.2 million in 1988.
   ``There is evidence of a shift in the growth of traffic to
smaller airports, where capacity, while still a large concern, is
still somewhat more available,'' Howard said.
   Aviation experts indicated they were surprised the growth was so
flat, but said the number of passengers was still sharply up from
the 1983 total of 290.7 million.
   And Howard said the AOCI predicts 76 percent of U.S. air
travelers will face delays if the capacity of the nation's system
of airports is not increased. The AOCI, which represents airports
throughout the world, supports a Bush administration proposal to
allow airports to charge a passenger tax to help build up the
system.
   The Partnership for Improved Air Travel has taken no position on
the passenger tax but opposes the administration's proposed
increases in other aviation taxes.
   The partnership includes airlines, travel and tourism interests,
unions, consumer groups and business organizations. It proposes
spending more of the billions of dollars in the tax-fed aviation
trust fund to help aviation.

   A senior PLO official on Wednesday called
President Bush's suspension of the U.S.-PLO dialogue ``a blow to
the peace process'' and predicted increased violence in the
Israeli-occupied territories.
   But in Jerusalem, an aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
praised the decision, saying it ``removed a major obstacle'' to
peace.
   Jamil Hilal, director of the PLO's information department, said
the U.S. move would encourage Israel's new hard-line government to
``escalate its repression against the Arab population under
occupation.''
   In Tunis, Salah Khalaf, regarded as the PLO's second-in-command,
was quoted by the French news agency AFP as saying Bush's move
would ``freeze peace efforts and reinforce extremist forces'' in
the Middle East.
   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said
he ``hopes that ways will soon be found of resuming a dialogue that
can serve the great purpose of achieving peace in the Middle East.''
   Hilal said in a telephone interview from Tunis that the
suspension of the dialogue ``can be judged only as an unfriendly
and colonial move. ... It's a blow to the peace process and a
provocation to Arabs states.''
   Hilal said he expects the Palestine Liberation Organization, in
retaliation for the suspension of talks, to call on Arab nations
``to apply economic sanctions against the United States. I expect
the uprising in the occupied territories to escalate.''
   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's chief advisor, Bassam Abu Sharif,
said in another phone interview from Tunis that ``the PLO
leadership has received the news transmitted through the media. The
leadership is studying carefully the text of his (Bush's)
statement.''
   He refused further comment.
   Avi Pazner, a top aide to Shamir, praised Bush's decision to end
the dialogue.
   It's ``an important and positive decision as far as the peace
process in the area is concerned,'' he said. ``The PLO was a major
obstacle to peace and now that obstacle is removed.''
   In the occupied West Bank, Jamil Tarifi, a pro-PLO Palestinian
leader who has been named as a possible peace negotiator, condemned
the U.S. move.
   ``We are very sorry for this position because the U.S. as a
superpower put itself under the pressure of the rightist Israeli
government instead of pressuring the Israelis to move forward for
peace,'' Tarifi said.
   ``Anyone who wants to talk to the Palestinians must talk with
the PLO,'' he added.
   Bush suspended the 18-month-old dialogue Wednesday, saying the
PLO had failed to forcefully condemn an unsuccessful May 30
terrorist attack against Israel.
   Bush had urged Arafat to disavow the assault and to discipline
the PLO faction that sent two speedboats filled with fighters
toward a Tel Aviv beach.
   Khalaf said the United States ``knows we have given all we can
in this affair.'' He added that the United States and the PLO do
not share the same ``interpretation of terrorism,'' Agence
France-Presse reported.
   The boats were intercepted by Israel and four guerrillas killed
and 12 captured.
   The dialogue began after Arafat renounced terrorism and accepted
Israel's right to exist.
   In Stockholm, Swedish Foreign Minister Sten Andersson said he
``regretted'' Bush's decision.
   Andersson was instrumental in persuading the PLO to renounce
terror and start its dialogue with the United States.
   Andersson said he was in contact with Secretary of State James
A. Baker III earlier Wednesday and that Baker had urged Sweden to
``continue its efforts to bridge the differences between the
parties'' in the Middle East conflict.

   The House voted Wednesday to give the Justice
Department an additional $75 million to use in prosecuting fraud in
the nation's savings and loan scandal in the coming year.
   With public outrage growing over the debacle that is expected
eventually cost upwards of $300 billion, lawmakers voted 420-1 to
provide money to pursue the more than 21,000 fraud cases that have
so far been referred to the Justice Department.
   Rep. Phil Crane, R-Ill., was the lone ``no'' vote.
   Rep. Neal Smith, D-Iowa, who proposed adding $75 million for the
Justice Department's S&amp;L prosecutions, said even more money will be
coming later. The amount would be an increase over the $50 million
allocated for the prosecutions this year.
   ``There's a growing feeling in this country that not enough is
being done to prosecute those who ripped off the savings and loan
industry,'' said Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, chairman of the
Judiciary Committee. ``There's no doubt these people deserve the
maximum punishment under the law.''
   The additional money was tacked onto a $10.5 billion bill
providing about half the money needed for the coming fiscal year
for the Commerce, Justice and State departments and for the federal
judiciary.
   The rest of the needed funds for those agencies will have to be
added later, after authorizing legislation is enacted by the
appropriate committees and the full Congress.
   The House was expected to continue debate on the bill next week.

<HEAD>New Combination of Drugs Approved for Advanced Colon Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday
approved a new combination drug treatment that has been shown to
prolong survival for patients with advanced stages of colon cancer.
   The therapy combines levamisole, a drug previously approved only
for eliminating intestinal parasites in animals, with fluorouracil,
already approved for treatment of several types of cancer.
   FDA officials said the combination of the two drugs in patients
who have undergone surgery for colon cancer that has spread to
nearby lymph nodes has been shown to reduce tumor reccurence and
death in some patients.
   Michael Friedman, associate director of the Cancer Therapy
Evaluation Program of the National Cancer Institute, said the
combination drug therapy is ``an important advance.'' But, he
added, studies on it must continue to improve treatment and
determine whether it is effective for other stages of the disease.
   Colon cancer that has spread to lymph nodes is classified as
stage 3, also referred to as stage Dukes' C. About 21,000 of the
110,000 Americans diagnosed with colon cancer each year are in this
stage. About 40 percent live for five years or more after surgery,
the FDA said.
   The combination therapy was tested in two clinical trials
sponsored by the National Cancer Institute that involved about
1,700 patients who had undergone surgery for stage 3 colon cancer.
   Researchers found that the treatment reduced the death rate for
these patients by about one-third and the tumor-recurrence rate by
about 40 percent.
   They don't know, however, how the five-year survival rate will
be affected since they have not followed these test patients that
long yet, said FDA spokeswoman Eva Kemper.
   More than 4,000 patients with stage 3 colon cancer have received
the combination therapy since May 1989 when it was approved under
the FDA's Treatment IND (investigative new drug) program that makes
promising experimental drugs available to patients with no other
hope, the agency said.
   The most common side effects of the treatment are nausea,
occasional vomiting, headache, diarrhea, sores in the mouth and
depressed blood count, the FDA said. Also, a blood disorder called
agranulocytosis caused one death among patients in the cancer
institute trials.
   The therapy, which lasts one year, consists of levamisole
tablets given orally for three consecutive days every other week
and fluorouracil given intravenously once a week.

   The government of El Salvador and
leftist guerrillas fighting that nation's leadership on Wednesday
discussed reforms in the armed forces during the second day of
U.N.-mediated peace talks.
   ``There is a good propect of reaching concrete accords at the
end of this round of negotiations,'' U.N. mediator Alvaro de Soto
said. ``I feel quite encouraged because the discussions are frank
and constructive.''
   Rebel leader Roberto Canas said the armed forces were a ``key
point'' in conversations Wednesday between the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front and El Salvador's rightist government,
led by President Alfredo Cristiani.
   The rebels want sharp reductions in El Salvador's 55,000-man
military. They also want the army's ranks purged of soldiers linked
to right-wing death squads and punishment of those responsible for
political slayings.
   Most of the 73,000 people killed in El Salvador's decade-old
civil war have been civilians, though thousands of those are
believed to be victims of rightist death squads.
   The rebels have said they won't discuss putting aside their
weapons until the question of the armed forces is resolved. The
government would prefer to focus on a cease-fire.
   A rebel leader, Shafik Handal, said that despite the
differences, both sides were ``working with respect and the
disposition to reach a substantive accord.''
   Salvador Samayoa, a member of the rebel delegation, said: ``It's
important that, for the first time, the government has agreed to
discuss the armed forces.''
   David Escobar, a member of the government negotiating team, said
six issues were on the agenda _ the armed forces, human rights,
economic problems, and reforms in the judicial and electoral
systems and in the constititution.
   He said the talks had been ``positive up to now,'' but played
down the prospects of a major agreement.
   ``We don't expect to sign spectacular accords,'' he said
Tuesday, after the initial session at this mountain resort outside
Mexico City. ``Anyway, we have until September 15 to comply with
the Caracas accords.''
   The talks, expected to last at least a week, are the second
round mediated by Soto, the personal envoy of U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar. Last month in Caracas,
Venezuela, both sides agreed to work toward a September cease-fire.
   Peace talks in June and September 1989 broke off after a major
guerrilla offensive in San Salvador in November. Negotiations in
1984 and 1987 under late President Jose Napoleon Duarte ended in
deadlock.
   The war has turned El Salvador into the largest recipient of
U.S. aid in the Western Hemisphere. The Central American nation
receives about $1 million a day from Washington.

   Moscow's chief negotiator in arms control talks
with the United States said Wednesday the Soviet Union will press
for Britain and France to follow the superpowers in cutting their
nuclear arms arsenals.
   ``The question of involving other nuclear states in the
bilateral process of nuclear arms reductions acquires ever greater
urgency,'' Yuri Nazarkin said in a prepared statement.
   He noted the Soviet Union in 1986 agreed not to include the
French and British nuclear forces in talks then launched with the
United States.
   ``However,'' Nazarkin said, ``it appears obvious that nuclear
arms reductions cannot proceed endlessly on a bilateral basis
only.''
   Nazarkin was speaking at a colloquium organized in preparation
for an international conference next August to review
implementation of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
   The treaty, signed in 1968, is designed to halt the spread of
atomic weapons. There are 141 countries that are parties to the
treaty.

<HEAD>U.S. to Release Radiation Exposure Records</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERICH SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Once-secret radiation exposure records for
200,000 nuclear weapons plant workers will soon be released to a
group that monitors power plant safety, a lawyer said Wednesday.
   The records will be analyzed to determine the health effects of
low-level exposure to radiation, said Daniel Berger, attorney for
the Three Mile Island Public Health Fund. The organization
represents people who live near the nuclear power plant that was
the site of nation's worst commercial nuclear accident.
   Lawyers for the U.S. Energy Department agreed a month ago to
turn over the information, but Berger said some paperwork remains
to be worked out.
   ``There has never been access to this data other than by
researchers in the Department of Energy,'' Berger said. ``It's been
tightly controlled.''
   The data, which is on computer tapes, will be analyzed by
researchers at Birmingham University in England. Alice Stewart, who
heads the the research team, took part in a project more than a
decade ago that found a startlingly high incidence of cancer among
workers at the Hanford nuclear reservation in Washington state.
   ``If the preliminary findings at Hanford are borne out, it seems
to me the occupational safety standards will have to be heightened
at nuclear facilities,'' said Berger.
   The first records are expected for 50,000 Hanford workers. The
government has also agreed to turn over records for 90,000 workers
at four more plants: the Savannah River Site in South Carolina; the
Linde plant in Tonawanda, N.Y.; and the X-10 and Y-12 plants at the
Oak Ridge reservation in Tennessee.
   The records include details about the sex and race of the
workers and their age when they were exposed to radiation, the
doses they received, and their job titles and occupational
histories.
   If the workers have died, the records also list the cause and
date of death. To protect the workers' privacy, their names are to
be withheld.
   As soon as possible, the government has promised to turn over
similar records for 60,000 workers from these plants: Rocky Flats,
Colo.; Los Alamos National Laboratory, N.M.; Mound Laboratory,
Miamisburg, Ohio, and the Pantex facility, Amarillo, Texas.
   By May 18, 1991, the Energy Department has pledged to turn over
records for 20,000 workers at the K-25 plant at Oak Ridge, the
Mallinckrodt Chemical Works in St. Louis and the Feed Material
Production Center in Fernald, Ohio.
   Stewart, the Birmingham researcher, told The Philadelphia
Inquirer she expects the new data to show three to five times as
many cancer cases as most experts expect to find among people who
have been exposed to low-level radiation.
   The Hanford study she worked on in the late 1970s found
unusually high rates of pancreatic, lung and bone-marrow cancer
among workers, even those exposed to radiation levels 30 times
lower than the government safety minimum.
   The government discontinued funding for the study, and turned
aside legal efforts to give the data to the researchers or others
on grounds it was protecting the workers' privacy.
   The TMI Public Health Fund pursued the data as a source of
information about long-term exposure to low-level radiation, Berger
said. The Energy Department agreed last year to release the records.
   The fund will be first to get the records, but they also will be
available to other researchers with the capacity to use the
computer tapes, said Jeff Sherwood, an Energy Department spokesman.
   The fund was set up in 1981 as part of a settlement of a lawsuit
brought by people living within 25 miles of the Three Mile Island
nuclear power plant against the plant and its owners, operators and
insurers.

<HEAD>Elderly and Students to Get Choice of EC Residency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUXEMBOURG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The elderly and students who are citizens of
one country in the European Community at the end of 1991 will be
able to live in any other EC nation if they wish, it was decided
Wednesday.
   The decision by the 12 EC nations gives jobless nationals in the
European Community the same rights as wage-earners.
   An elderly citizen who has dreamed of retiring in sunnier
southern climates will be able to obtain a five-year, renewable
residency permit in the EC country of his choice. The retiree must
show only proof of health insurance and that he or she will not
burden the adopted nation's social security system.
   And a student who can show proof of registration at a university
or college in another EC nation as well as sufficient income will
receive a one-year renewable residency permit.
   Those who are unemployed by choice and do not classify as being
either elderly or a student will have to prove they have sufficient
income not to need assistance from the social security system in
their new country.
   The 12 EC members are Belgium, Denmark, France, West Germany,
Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United
Kingdom, Spain and Portugal. In 1992, the nations will drop trade
barriers among themselves to create a unified Euromarket.
   In Brussels Wednesday the 18 nations of Western Europe's two
trading blocs began talks to pave the way for the so-called
European Economic Space.
   The move would bring the six nations of the European Free Trade
Association _ Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and
Switzerland _ closer to the European Community.
   Frans Andriessen, an EC commissioner, said he hoped broad
agreement would be reached near the end of this year and be fully
implemented on Jan. 1, 1993, when the EC's single market comes into
force.

<HEAD>Mitterrand: African Nations Must Move Toward Democracy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL DONNET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LA BAULE, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand told
African leaders Wednesday they must move toward democracy, then
announced new steps to ease the continent's debt burdens.
   ``Democracy is a universal principle. It's the direction that
must be taken,'' Mitterrand said in his opening address to a summit
attended by 35 African delegations, many from one-party states.
   ``Have confidence in freedom,'' Mitterrand said. He promised
French support for countries that ``took the road to democracy.''
   About 200 protesters calling for reforms in African nations
marched as the summit formally opened.
   Mamadou Diouck, spokesman for the Panafrican Forum for
Democracy, said it was necessary to ``cleanse the political morals
of Africa to permit true development.''
   King Hassan II of Morocco urged the West to help Africa's
``young democracies'' make a peaceful transition from one-party to
multiparty systems.
   ``The countries of Africa have no need to be ashamed, but they
have to learn,'' the king said. ``Time is needed, and patience even
more so.''
   Mitterrand said France would give outright grants, rather than
loans, to the poorest African nations and would limit the annual
interest charged on loans to middle-income countries to 5 percent.
   The opening speeches followed private talks late Tuesday in
which Mitterrand, according to one of his aides, advised the
African leaders to move away from one-party political systems.
   President Abdou Diouf of Senegal, speaking to a handful of
reporters, said he favored rewarding nations that move toward
pluralism. ``I think it is necessary to encourage us a bit, give us
a little push.''
   But Diouf warned: ``A democracy without development has no sense
and, in the end, is dangerous.''
   He said he would like to see an African Common Market or
political federation ``because as small states we cannot advance.
We need to be a big grouping.''
   After 30 years of independence for many African nations, ``the
illusions have disappeared,'' Diouf said. ``It is perhaps easier
now to unite our weaknesses to become an economic and political
force.''
   Of the delegations at the summit in the Brittany beach resort,
22 are led by heads of state, some facing unprecedented political
opposition at home.
   In his speech, Mitterrand said he intends to ask the heads of
state and government at the seven-nation economic summit in Houston
next month to join France in helping African countries alleviate
their heavy debt loads.
   He has depicted France as Africa's most generous supporter and
said the problems of developing countries would be eased
dramatically if Japan and the United States gave equal support.
   French officials said the decision to limit the interest rate
paid by certain middle-income African countries on their public
debt with France means loan payments will be about halved.
   The measure chiefly applies to Gabon, the Ivory Coast, Congo and
Cameroon, which collectively owe France more than $10 billion.
   Calude Arnaud, an aide to Mitterrand, said President Hissene
Habre of Chad complained during the talks late Tuesday that Western
lending institutions were making democracy more difficult by
imposing economic austerity measures.
   The summit is to conclude Thursday.

<HEAD>Antitrust Exemption Repeal Approved by the Committee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill repealing many of the industry's
exemptions from antitrust laws was approved Wednesday by the House
Judiciary Committee over unanimous Republican opposition.
   On a 19-17 vote, the panel voted to open insurance companies to
antitrust lawsuits for price-fixing, attempted monopolizing,
allocating territories among rival companies or forcing consumers
to buy insurance they do not want in order to qualify for coverage
that they do.
   Three of the committee's 22 Democrats, Reps. Dan Glickman of
Kansas, Bruce Morrison of Connecticut and Edward Feighan of Ohio,
voted with all of the 14 Republicans in opposing the bill.
   Insurance companies and their agents have enjoyed immunity from
antitrust suits since 1945 under the McCarran-Feguson Act, which
delegated regulation of the now $500 billion-a-year industry to
state governments.
   Consumer groups and others have complained since the mid-1970s
that lax oversight by some states has permitted the companies to
use anticompetitive practices to both deny coverage and raise rates
dramatically.
   ``Private individuals, local governments and businesses of all
sizes have found their premiums skyrocketing and their coverage
severely restricted,'' said Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, the
judiciary committee's chairman. ``Congress can no longer ignore the
widespread economic dislocation caused by unreasonably high
premiums or policies that are unavailable at any price.''
   The federal antitrust prohibitions would not apply in states
with ``active'' regulatory programs, thus preserving the
McCarran-Ferguson's basic policy to defer regulation to states, he
said. He did not say which states would qualify.
   The bill would allow insurance companies to continue sharing raw
data on claims. But after a five-year transition period, it would
greatly weaken companies' reliance upon the Insurance Services
Office, a New York-based industry organization that now ``advises''
what rates should be charged.
   A similar bill was approved by the panel's economic and
commerical law subcommittee two years ago but died there under an
intensive industry lobbying effort. Democrats said they hope to
bring the new version to the full House in late summer or early
fall.
   Although similar legislation has been introduced in the Senate,
industry lobbyists say they are counting on Sens. Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz., and Howell Heflin, D-Ala., both members of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, to prevent it from every reaching a floor vote
there.
   ``If this bill is enacted into law, it may prove disastrous for
consumers adn small insurance companies alike,'' said Lowell Beck,
president of the National Association of Independent Insurors.
``Every litigated claim would subject to additional antitrust
counts. Legal costs, which by necessity would be passed on to
consumers, would soar.''
   Consumer groups acknowledged they face an uphill fight, but
voiced optimism that the committee's vote Wednesday opening the way
for a fight on the House floor will put a public spotlight on the
issue.
   ``This represents an important breakthrough,'' said Robert
Brandon, vice president of Citizen Action, a grassroots consumer
organization claiming 2 million members. ``It demonstrates that an
informed and aroused public can break the insurance industry's
stranglehold over legislators.''
   Linda Lipsen, legislative counsel for Consumers Union, predicted
the bill will become a major election-year issue once it reaches
the House floor.
   ``Behind food and shelter, insurance is the single largest
expenditure of the year for the average consumer,'' she said.
``Just like the gun lobby, the insurance lobby is no longer being
perceived by Congress as invincible.''
   Lipsen disputed industry claims that premiums would rise, citing
a report by the General Accounting Office showing that rates fell
by 30 percent in Michigan after its legislature in 1982 repealed a
state antitrust exemption for workers compensation insurance.
   In addition to consumer groups, the bill has strong support from
the American Bankers Association and other bank trade groups whose
members are eager to jump into the insurance business through
subsidiaries.

   Mormon Church President Ezra Taft Benson
was in serious condition Wednesday after being hospitalized for
treatment of a ``form of infection,'' the church said.
   Benson, 90, was admitted at about 7:45 a.m. after experiencing
difficulties at his Salt Lake City apartment, according to a
statement from church headquarters here.
   ``His physicians say preliminary tests indicate a form of
infection, for which he is receiving treatment,'' the statement
said.
   Benson's condition had stabilized by late afternoon, but there
was no more information about the nature of his illness, said
spokesman Don LeFevre.
   ``The doctors say he seems to be improving from this morning,''
he said.
   A former U.S. agriculture secretary under President Dwight D.
Eisenhower, Benson has been president of the 7.3 million-member
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints since 1985.
   Benson was hospitalized briefly May 12 after experiencing a
dizzy spell, but was released a few hours later, LeFevre said.
   Benson attended virtually all sessions of the Mormon Church's
160th Annual General Conference on April 5-6, but appeared feeble
and did not speak.

   Federal prosecutors agreed Wednesday to release up
to $6 million from Manuel Noriega's European bank accounts, saying
they wanted to move quickly with the drug trafficking case against
the former Panamanian leader.
   Meanwhile, Panama's new government told the court it will file a
$5.3 billion lawsuit against Noriega, accusing him of racketeering,
including murder, theft and fraud against the Panamanian people.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler took note of the civil
lawsuit, to be filed in the next two weeks, but said he wouldn't
allow it to interfere with the criminal proceeding against Noriega.
   Assistant U.S. attorney Michael Sullivan said the agreement to
unfreeze $4.5 million to $6 million in assets solves a legal battle
that began April 29, when defense attorneys threatened to withdraw
from the case. They said the government's seizure of $20 million of
Noriega's assets deprived them of fees and expenses.
   Sullivan warned that judges both in the United States and Europe
would have to approve the releases. ``We have agreed to make our
best effort to unfreeze accounts that are currently frozen in
Europe,'' he said.
   Lead defense attorney Frank Rubino said his team of five
attorneys was satisfied with the agreement. ``We feel we now will
have the ability to go forward and give Gen. Noreiga the defense he
deserves.''
   U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said the deal will allow
prosecutors ``to focus on the true issues in the criminal case.''
   ``This avoids distracting litigation and premature presentation
of evidence that would only sidetrack us from the real issues,''
Lehtinen said in a statement released from his office.
   Rubino had vowed to fight a protracted legal battle to release
and make public payments made by the CIA and other intelligence
agencies to the former Panamanian leader. The defense has said the
payments added up to $11 million, but the government claimed the
amount was much lower.
   Hoeveler, who had warned prosecutors the government would have
to justify its seizures unless it released funds for Noriega's
defense, said he approved the deal. He added that it would allow
the case to progress more quickly toward a planned Jan. 28 trial
date.
   Noriega, who surrendered to U.S. troops Jan. 4, is being held in
the Metropolitan Correctional Center outside of Miami on a February
1988 indictment accusing him of taking $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to turn Panama into a way station
for cocaine trafficking.
   After Hoeveler's ruling, Gregory Craig, an attorney from the
Washington law firm Williams and Connolly, addressed the court,
saying he represented the new government of Panama installed after
the U.S. invasion last December.
   Craig said the Panamanian government within two weeks would file
federal and Florida racketeering lawsuits claiming $300 million in
actual damages as well as $5 billion in punitive damages against
the Panamanian people.
   Outside the courtroom, Craig said the lawsuit ``would include
allegations of murder, grand theft, extortion,'' as well as breach
of trust and other civil violations by Noriega.
   Craig said the lawsuit was being filed so that ``no irreparable
damage be done to those funds that rightfully belong to the
Panamanian people.''
   Before the hearing, attorneys for both sides met at the federal
courthouse to seek a solution, said defense attorney Jon May.
   Attorney Steven Kollin said Noriega would need as much as $5
million to counter the $37 million the defense estimates the
government is spending on the trial.
   In a sharply worded opinion issued June 15, the judge said the
government failed to give Noriega due process when it seized the 27
bank accounts around the world valued at $20 million, along with
other assets such as the deposed Panamanian leader's homes, cars
and personal property.
   During the invasion of Panama, troops also found $5.8 million in
cash in Noriega's quarters, which it turned over to the new
Panamanian government.
   Prosecutors and defense attorneys tried once before to resolve
the dispute over defense attorneys' fees, but the deal was ruled
illegal because federal law did not allow the government to pay
$300-an-hour fees or reimburse the number of attorneys Noriega says
he needs.

<TEXT>
   Charles P. Farnsley, a colorful
politician who for a time adopted Southern planter's garb and who
as Louisville mayor invited ordinary people to air their gripes at
City Hall, has died. He was 83.
   The Democrat, who died Tuesday at a nursing home here, was mayor
from 1948 to 1953 and served in the U.S. House of Representatives
from 1965 to 1967. He was a state legislator for four years in the
1930s.
   Officials at the nursing home and funeral home Wednesday evening
were unable to give a cause of death.
   As mayor, Farnsley may have been best known for the ``beef
session.'' Every Monday night he held court at City Hall, inviting
any citizen with a problem or complaint to present it directly to
him.
   He energetically attacked what he saw as the city's problems.
   Farnsley turned empty lots into parks, installed street lights,
raised city workers' salaries, improved police and firefighters'
pensions, converted old schools into community centers and replaced
old garbage trucks.
   ``Charlie was really one of the great planners and builders of
the city,'' said Frank Burke Sr., a lawyer who was mayor from 1969
to 1973.
   But he may be better remembered for his eccentricities.
   Farnsley was a history buff who went through a ``Confederate
period'' in the 1930s, when his normal dress was a broad planter's
hat, a swallow-tailed coat, a brocade vest and a black string tie.
   He published books under the Lost Cause Press label and bottled
whimsically named brands of whiskey like ``Rebel Yell.'' He tried
to name another brand ``Damyankee,'' but it was rejected by the
copyright office as being in bad taste. He submitted a new brand
name, ``Bad Taste.''
   He abandoned Confederate garb in later years, except for the
string tie, which became his trademark. But he frequently carried a
carpetbag when he traveled to northern cities.
   Television came to Louisville during his stint as mayor, and he
bought sets for the public libraries since few people had them at
home.
   ``People might as well look in a library as in a bar. It makes
business for the bar, why can't it make business for the library?''
he asked.
   Book circulation reportedly skyrocketed.
   Farnsley is survived by daughters Sally Bird of Arlington, Va.,
and Ann Farnsley of Vevay, Ind.; sons Alexander of La Jolla,
Calif., and Burrel and Douglass, both of Louisville, and six
grandchildren.
   Services were scheduled for Thursday in Louisville.

<TEXT>
   A Colombian who claimed ties to the Medellin
drug cartel has pleaded guilty to charges in what authorities say
was a plot to buy Stinger missiles to use against the Colombian
government.
   Alfredo Antonio Ramos-Tinoco, 48, pleaded Tuesday to conspiracy
to buy stolen shoulder-held anti-aircraft missiles and other
automatic weapons and trying to export them.
   Ramos-Tinoco, who faces up to 15 years in prison and a $500,000
fine, is to be sentenced Aug. 17 by U.S. District Judge William
Terrell Hodges.
   Ramos-Tinoco struck a deal that was sealed following a motion to
the court requesting secrecy.
   He was picked up May 5 in Tampa while shooting pool at a hotel
bar.
   Luis Fernando Arcila-Giraldo, 28, was arrested on identical
charges the same day in Miami. He has also agreed to a plea bargain
and is expected to enter a plea in Miami within weeks, according to
documents filed in Tampa.
   Neither Assistant U.S. Attorney Todd Foster nor Mark Pizzo, a
public defender representing Ramos-Tinoco, would provide details.
   The Colombians, claiming to work for reputed cartel kingpin
Pablo Escobar, told undercover agents during the sting that bribed
officials would help them smuggle the weapons for attacks on the
Colombian government.
   The 4-foot, 35-pound Stinger is a ground-to-air missile that
hones in on engine heat.
   Ramos-Tinoco was videotaped telling undercover agents the
weapons would be used ``to shoot down Colombian government
helicopters ... documentation would not be a problem because he had
government officials paid off in Colombia,'' FBI agent Charles A.
Salemme told a magistrate at a bond hearing last month.
   But investigators knew of no specific plan targeting planes or
helicopters of anti-drug Colombian officials, the FBI said.
   The suspects said they were willing to pay $5 million from the
planned sale of cocaine for the plane and weapons, and $1 million
to those who would steal the weapons from a U.S. military base,
Salemme testified.
   The federal sting was the result of an undercover drug
investigation in Polk County in west-central Florida.
   According to authorities, the men began negotiating in April to
buy 124 Stinger missiles, 50 light machine guns, 3,000 assault
rifles, 200 pairs of night-vision goggles and 200 pounds of plastic
explosives on behalf of Escobar, the fugitive head of the Medellin
cartel.

   The Bush administration presented the first
deficit-cutting proposal of the lagging budget summit on Wednesday,
a $51 billion package of savings for next year that produced a
lukewarm reaction from Democrats.
   ``It is a beginning,'' said House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt of Missouri, the lead Democratic at the closed-door talks.
``We have a good long way to go.''
   The significance of the proposal was not so much its contents as
its very existence. It was introduced in the tenth session of the
talks, six weeks after the meetings began and barely three months
from the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year.
   ``We today have succeeded in starting serious negotiations,''
said Gephardt.
   Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, a Republican bargainer, said
the White House package would save $51 billion in fiscal 1991, and
about $440 billion over the next five years. Others said the plan
would save $50 billion in its first year.
   ``It's a good starting point,'' said Domenici, the ranking GOP
member of the Senate Budget Committee.
   Participants in the talks said the package included $20 billion
in new taxes and other revenues, $18 billion in cuts in benefit
programs like Medicare, and $6 billion in defense reductions.
   The participants, who asked to not be identified, said the plan
also contained about $4 billion in cuts to domestic programs and $2
billion in savings from reduced interest payments.
   But Gephardt said Democrats believe that greater savings are
needed over the five years, in the range of $500 billion to $600
billion.
   ``Some had concerns, which they expressed,'' Gephardt said of
Democratic negotiators.
   The majority leader said Democrats would have to study the
proposal overnight before responding to it.
   Earlier in the day, Senate Budget Committee Chairman James
Sasser had said the White House proposal would go nowhere if it
resembled Bush's January budget. That spending plan has been
largely ignored on Capitol Hill, even by Republicans.
   ``Simply putting a new suit on that old corpse isn't going to
revive it,'' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser,
D-Tenn.
   The first real flurry of bargaining in the negotiations, which
started six weeks ago, came as White House and congressional budget
experts said the federal deficit looks even worse than it did a
month ago.
   Amid the ever-gloomier expectations about the government's
finances, White House Budget Director Richard Darman prepared to
offer congressional negotiators a package that would pare next
year's shortfall by nearly $50 billion, officials said.
   ``I assume there will be many proposals,'' Darman told reporters.
   Democrats have been pressing for about $60 billion in savings
for fiscal 1991, which starts Oct. 1, and nearly $600 billion in
budget reductions over the next five years. They have not specified
from where the savings should come.
   Republicans have said saving $45 billion next ear and $450
billion over five years should be adequate.
   The apparent size of the problem the two sides are facing
continued to grow Wednesday.
   Darman told negotiators that next year's budget gap will be $159
billion, excluding the costs of rescuing the savings and loan
industry, participants said. That's $21 billion more than he
projected last month.
   The budget director said the 1991 shortfall would reach $200
billion to $227 billion if thrift bailout costs are included. In
May, the figure he used was $199 billion.
   The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office also boosted its
deficit forecasts.
   CBO said next year's shortfall would be $164 billion without S&amp;L
costs and $232 billion with them. In May, CBO estimated those costs
at $149 billion to $159 billion, and $196 billion to $246 billion,
respectively.
   ``The problem is getting worse,'' Sasser said.
   The Gramm-Rudman law requires the president and Congress to
reduce next year's budget gap to $64 billion. If they miss that
target by more than $10 billion, the law imposes cuts in most
government programs.
   CBO officials attributed the worsening numbers to less than
expected tax collections and the growing size of the S&amp;L crisis.

<TEXT>
   Philippines Vice President Salvador Laurel
said Wednesday his government's policy on military base
negotiations with the United States is in disarray because of a
lack of leadership by President Corazon Aquino.
   Laurel said in an interview that contradictory statements by
government officials have created confusion about what Filipino
policy on the bases is.
   ``This is the time to come out definitely, take a definite
stance, and show leadership,'' Laurel said, referring to Aquino. He
said Aquino has said only that her government should not rule out
any option concerning the bases.
   The negotiations focus on U.S. operations at Subic Bay naval
base and Clark Air Base and several smaller installations.
   Laurel, a political rival of Aquino's, is in the United States
on a private visit. He met with senators and House members on
Tuesday.
   With the current base agreement scheduled to lapse next year,
the United States and the Philippines opened base talks last month
in Manila.
   Laurel said he takes seriously statements by Bush administration
officials that the United States will remove its military presence
from the Philippines if it is no longer welcome.
   He said he advocates a gradual phase out of the American
presence over a five to 10 year period. The pace of the withdrawal
would be guided by geostrategic factors, such as Soviet military
behavior in Southeast Asia, he said, adding that the Kremlin has
indicated a willingness to reduce its presence in Vietnam.
   He also said that tensions between the United States and the
Philippines could be eased if, during the course of the
negotiations, a number of irritants related to the bases are
removed.
   Among others, Laurel mentioned the lack of jurisdiction of
Filipino courts over crimes committed on the bases.
   ``If we want a real smooth relationship, we should remove these
irritants,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Loans to China by the World Bank for anything
but basic human needs would bring a cut in U.S. contributions to
the bank under a provision approved on Wednesday by a House
subcommittee.
   The sponsor of the provision, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, said a
bank loan to China of $300 million to help plant trees did not
cover a basic human need. The Bush administration considered that
it did and supported the loan.
   There is no agreement on what makes a basic human need.
Spokesmen for the bank, the biggest source of aid to the Third
World, say that is not one of its standards. The bank's charter
says it must base loans on a country's economy.
   Many in Congress want to punish China for suppressing the
movement toward democracy and want the bank and the Bush
administration to join them. One member called the loan for the
trees a ``first anniversary gift'' for the Chinese tank attack on
Tiananmen Square. It was announced May 29, less than week before
the anniversary.
   Rep. Pelosi's amendment to a bill on world financial bodies was
approved, 10-9. The subcommittee on international development sent
it to the House Banking Committee.
   An Appropriations subcommittee on foreign aid approved a similar
provision last week.
   Pelosi's amendment was opposed by Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, the
ranking Republican on the subcommittee.
   ``Trees help us all to breathe,'' he said.
   The subcommittee also adopted an amendment by Leach urging
reduction of debts owed to governments by eastern European and
southern African countries that are moving toward democracy. There
was no recorded vote.

<HEAD>Agra Diamond Fetches Record Price in London Auction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The exotic Agra diamond, once worn in a 16th
century Mogul emperor's turban, became the most expensive pink
diamond in the world Wednesday when it was auctioned for a record
$6.95 million.
   The 32.24 carat Agra, the largest pink diamond ever auctioned,
was sold to Siba Rare Jewels of Hong Kong after heated bidding at
Christie's showroom in London. Siba made their successful bid by
telephone.
   The sale of the Agra diamond easily eclipsed the previous record
sale price for a pink diamond of $6.1 million, set in May 1989.
   Raymond Sancroft-Baker, senior director of Christie's jewelry
department, said: ``I am delighted. I had expected it to fetch $4.2
million to $4.7 million. Its history obviously pushed up the
price.''
   The Agra, the world's seventh largest pink diamond, was mined in
the Golconda region of India's Hyderabad province.
   It was seized by Babur, the founder of the Mogul dynasty, in
1526 when he conquered India and took the gem after defeating the
Rajah of Gwalior.
   Along with the Agra, Babur also took the Koh-i-Noor diamond, now
one of the principle treasures in Britain's crown jewels. He gave
the Koh-i-Noor to his son Humayun, but kept the Agra for himself,
wearing it in his turban.
   The cushion-shaped Agra was the centerpiece of a jewelry auction
that brought in $22 million and broke a previous record of $9.4
million set at Christie's in June 1989.
   Other highlights of the sale included the 18.49 carat Golden
Drop, a pear-shaped yellow diamond bought by London's Graff
jewelers for $3.67 million, a record for a yellow diamond.
   Like the Agra, the stones came from the Winans Collection, and
were offered for sale by a descendant of American collector Louis
Winans.
   The Agra has also belonged to Britain's Duke of Brunswick, the
eccentric 19th century collector, who bought it in 1944.
   It weighed 41.75 carats at that time, but was cut down to its
present weight in the late 19th century to eliminate imperfections.
   It was later bought by Bram Hertz of Paris, who sold it in 1891
to the London jeweler Edwin Streeter. In 1905, the diamond was
included in a sale at Christie's and was bought by Max Meyer.
   In 1910, Winans bought the gem with money inherited from his
father, engineer William Winans, who built the railway that ran
from Moscow to St. Petersburg in the mid-19th century. The stone
was inherited by the current owner.

   President Bush lashed out Wednesday at
members of Congress who say sending Americans to Mars is less
important than other spending priorities. He likened the critics to
the ``naysayers'' of Christopher Columbus.
   Touring NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, Bush criticized the
House Appropriations subcommittee for voting last week ``to pull
the plug on this historic undertaking'' by axing $300 million in
seed money Bush had requested for the project.
   Bush wants to return Americans to the moon and to land a manned
space flight on Mars within 30 years.
   ``Some say the space program should wait, that we should only go
forward once the social problems of today are completely solved,''
Bush said at the space center. ``But history proves that attitude
is self-defeating. Had Columbus waited until all the problems of
his time were solved, the timbers of the Santa Maria would be
rotting on the Spanish coast to this day.''
   The president said American schoolchildren reading about
Columbus' doubters have ``shook their heads in disbelief that these
naysayers could have been so shortsighted.''
   ``We must not let the children of the future shake their heads
at our behavior,'' he said. ``History tells us what happens to
nations that forget how to dream. The American people want us in
space.''
   Bush, campaigning in Alabama and North Carolina for Republican
officeholders seeking reelection, took time off for the trip to the
space center.
   Bush spoke to a crowd that gathered outside the space center on
a 114-degree day after he told a news conference he was suspending
talks with the PLO.
   The president toured portions of the space center and met with a
group of seventh and eighth graders participating in NASA's ``Class
from Space'' program. They students will ask questions of
astronauts when they are in space during an August mission.
   Bush also participated in a demonstration of how starlight is
analyzed, touching liquid lithium to a flame to turn the flame red.
``It's kind of fun,'' Bush said.
   Bush stumped in Alabama for first-term Gov. Guy Hunt and in
North Carolina for Sen. Jesse Helms.
   Before several hundred contributors in Charlotte, Bush praised
Helms _ with whom he has had sharp differences _ as a man who
``isn't a trendy follower who flows with the current. He's a
visionary who alters the tide.''
   He said they agree on many issues such as a strong defense and
``value issues'' such as a right to prayer in the schools and the
need for a constitutional amendment to protect the flag.
   ``Let's face it, people don't always agree with him but they
respect him,'' Bush said of Helms.
   Spokesman Steve Hart said the Hunt even raised $450,000. He
estimated the Helms event brought in about $1 million.
   In Huntsville, the president headlined a reception to help Hunt,
who is considered in good shape as he faces the winner of a June 26
Democratic primary runoff.
   Bush used that occasion to make a pitch for the proposed
constitutional amendment to bar flag burning and for his anti-crime
package, which Congress has completely overhauled.
   Bush said that ``a carefully drawn amendment to make burning of
the American flag a crime'' is needed because the flag is a unique
symbol.
   At the Marshall space center, Bush pushed Congress to approve
the $300 million he wants in the 1991 budget to get the moon-Mars
project going.
   The sum is part of Bush's 1991 budget request for $1.27 billion
in overall space-exploration money, out of a total NASA budget of
$15.2 billion. The president has announced a goal of landing a
manned spacecraft on Mars by 2019 and returning manned missions to
the moon.
   Last week, however, the House Appropriations subcommittee that
handles the National Aeronautics and Space Administration slashed
the $300 million from its budget draft.

<HEAD>All-Night Speechmaking Again in the House</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Republicans began a marathon of
anti-crime speeches Wednesday night, touting the GOP as the
tough-on-crime party and accusing Democrats of stalling President
Bush's bill to fight the problem.
   The speechmaking began at 7:15 p.m. and the Republicans planned
to keep the House in session through 8 a.m. Thursday. The event was
scheduled intentionally to be held exactly one year after Bush's
presentation of his legislation.
   Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., earlier in the day called the
session ``total nonsense'' and a ``politically motivated activity''
because he already has agreed to bring a major crime bill to the
floor this year.
   And in another counter-attack, House Judiciary Committee
Chairman Jack Brooks, D-Texas, announced comprehensive anti-crime
legislation will be considered next week by the panel's
subcommittee on crime.
   The GOP members arranged for citizens from across the country to
call in crimes as they are reported to police, so the lawmakers
could discuss them.
   Rep. Lawrence Coughlin, R-Pa., early in the session, announced
in the first report that the Coast Guard had just made a major drug
seizure. Coughlin is ranking Republican on the Select Committee on
Narcotics Abuse.
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., ranking Republican on the crime
subcommittee, said the GOP traditionally has ``forced Democrats to
pass crime legislation.''
   ``Here we are again leading the charge,'' he said. ``There has
been no major initiative by those on the other side of the aisle.
Ninety percent of whatever product'' eventually passes, he said,
``will be based on the initiative ... that Republicans put
together.''
   Rep. Don Ritter, R-Pa., complained that ``much of the
president's plan has been stalled right here in the Congress by
partisan politics.''
   ``It's time for Congress to deal with violent crimes and with
drugs. They are priority issues,'' said Rep. Hamilton Fish, R-N.Y.,
senior minority member of the Judiciary Committee.
   The crime bill to be considered by the committee would expand
use of the death penalty for federal crimes including presidential
assassination; strengthen controls over chemicals needed to
manufacture certain drugs and toughen criminal sanctions on those
distributing anabolic steroids.
   The legislation also includes federal grants to state and local
governments to relieve prison overcrowding and improvements in
procedures for seizing criminal assets.
   Another subcommittee is considering provisions to streamline
appeals by death row inmates to avoid inordinate delays.
   Among Bush's proposals were those to expand the federal death
penalty for 30 offenses, including presidential assassination, and
streamline the habeas corpus process by which prisoners challenge
the legality of their arrests and punishment.

   Weeks of security planning and drills paid off
Wednesday, as 750,000 people welcomed Nelson Mandela to New York
without incident, police said.
   ``We did a lot of planning, put a lot of police officers on the
street, hand-picked the ranking officers on the scene and it all
came to fruition,'' said Assistant Chief Thomas Walsh, commander of
patrol officers in southern Manhattan.
   ``Things looked great. It was terrific,'' Walsh added.
   No arrests were reported during Mandela's stops at a Brooklyn
high school or during the ticker-tape parade honoring the
anti-apartheid leader.
   ``There was a point when the things got tense, a bunch of youths
in their exuberance rushed the `Mandelamobile,' but we had 70
police officers on each side (of the flatbed truck) and they held
them back,'' the chief said.
   Nobody was arrested in the incident, which took place as the
bulletproof vehicle neared City Hall, the chief said.
   Officers also moved a small group of demonstrators to a spot
near City Hall, but out of the march route.
   ``Everything went smoothly, from the beginning of the day right
through,'' said police Deputy Commissioner of Public Information
Suzanne Trazoff.
   Security for Mandela's three-day visit to New York exceeded the
protection provided for Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and
rivaled measures taken to protect Pope John Paul II during his
visit in 1979.
   Three thousand police officers were assigned to protect Mandela
on Wednesday, part of 12,000 officers slated to protect the
71-year-old civil rights leader during his New York visit.
   The elaborate security plans, code-named Operation Topaz, took
State Department officials and police six weeks to develop, and
ranged from the development of the ``Mandelamobile'' to deployment
of 6,200 sawhorses for crowd control.
   Operation Topaz was also the largest safety effort ever mounted
by the State Department's Office of Diplomatic Security, which
provides protection to dignitaries who aren't heads of state, said
spokeswoman Meg Ravnholt.
   One of the jewels of the security plan was the specially
designed, $58,000 ``Mandelamobile,'' a flatbed truck with a
bulletproof glass bubble that held Mandela, his wife Winnie, and
four aides.
   The specially outfitted vehicle included such James Bond touches
as an explosion-proof fuel tank and tires filled with
bullet-resistant material, said Trazoff.
   State Department agents used electronic devices as well as
bomb-sniffing Labrador retrievers to sweep the stops on Mandela's
schedule. During his public appearances, police and federal agents
formed a 75-foot security zone around Mandela to keep him at a safe
distance from onlookers.
   Undercover police officers and detectives were among the crowds
lining the parade route, and rooftops along the way were guarded by
uniformed sharpshooters, said police sources who spoke on condition
of anonymity.

<TEXT>
   The parents of kidnapped American gold
miner Scott Heimdal said Wednesday they have taken over
negotiations with their son's abductors so they can personally work
for his release.
   Roy and Marge Heimdal of Peoria, Ill., arrived in Quito late
Monday in the hopes of winning the release of their 27-year-old
son, who was kidnapped April 28 near the Colombia border by men
believed to be Communist guerrillas.
   In a statement released Wednesday through the U.S. Embassy, the
Heimdals said they were taking ``direct charge of all negotiations
with the persons who have our son Scott.
   ``We have relieved all other persons that represent us in these
negotiations. We're trying to establish direct contact with the
persons that have Scott to try and obtain his freedom,'' the
statement said.
   ``We're confident and optimistic that they will hear our pleas
and deal directly with us and understand the suffering we're going
through.''
   The statement did not say whether Heimdal's parents planned to
travel themselves to the jungled area along the Colombia border
where it's believed Heimdal is being held, or who would help them
with Spanish translations in the talks. The Heimdals speak no
Spanish.
   Heimdal was kidnapped by a band of armed men while traveling in
a canoe on the Bermeja River 100 miles northeast of Quito, where he
worked for the small gold mining company IMINCO. The boat's pilot
was killed.
   The company's general manager, Jeffrey Fino, has until now been
closely involved in negotiations with the guerrillas, who are
demanding a ransom of $612,000 paid in Colombian pesos.
   Attempts to reach Fino for comment Wednesday were unsuccessful.
   The Heimdals, a working-class family, scraped together $60,000,
most of it in community donations, believing that was the price the
kidnappers were asking. But they learned last week the ransom
demand was $612,000, and that the $60,000 was only to guarantee
their son's safety.
   Fino expressed in an interview last week his growing distrust of
the guerrillas. He said they have behaved erratically and
unpredictably in talks with Fino's negotiator.
   The kidnappers identified themselves as members of the People's
Liberation Army, a Communist guerrilla group operating in the
Colombian jungle.
   Wednesday's statement was the first made by the Heimdals since
they arrived in Quito. U.S. Embassy officials have warned publicity
about the negotiations could endanger Heimdal's life.
   In a four-page letter from Heimdal made public by his parents
last week, the kidnap victim said the guerrillas was under the
impression Heimdal's family was rich because they were able to see
a Cable News Network TV report about the fundraising effort in
Peoria, where the Heimdals live in a rented home.

<HEAD>Cuomo Refuses To Extradite Blue Movie Broadcasters</HEAD>

   Gov. Mario Cuomo refused Wednesday to
extradite four executives of a New York-based blue-movie satellite
broadcasting company to face obscenity charges in Alabama.
   In a letter to Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt's legal staff, Cuomo
counsel Evan Davis said state law doesn't allow the governor to
comply with such an extradition request unless the alleged offense
is a crime in New York.
   The March indictments name Home Dish Only Satellite Network
Inc., four of its executives, the giant GTE Corp. and some of its
executives. The charges resulted in Home Dish's American Exxxstasy
channel and its related Tuxxedo channel being pulled off the air.
   The charges against GTE and its executives were dropped shortly
after GTE pulled the plug on Home Dish.
   The indictments set off a debate over censorship in the
high-tech era because the action in Alabama ended up cutting off
the movies to subscribers nationwide.
   Home Dish's American Exxxstasy channel had broadcast hard-core
movies for a $20-a-month fee to about 30,000 subscribers nationwide
who owned satellite dish antennas, which often cost $2,000 or more.
   The Tuxxedo channel went to 1.2 million cable subscribers, who
paid $5 in addition to the regular cable fee.
   The charges against Home Dish were brought by Montgomery County,
Ala., District Attorney Jimmy Evans, who is running for state
attorney general in Alabama.
   Evans was on the road campaigning Wednesday night, and couldn't
be reached immediately for comment on Cuomo's decision.
   ``Our clients are very happy'' with Cuomo's move, said Paul
Sherman, a New York City lawyer representing Home Dish's four
executives. ``They do not believe they have done anything wrong.''
   Sherman said Home Dish has been out of business since the
indictments were handed up, and satellite owners refused to
transmit the X-rated and R-rated fare supplied to subscribers of
the American Exxxstasy and Tuxxedo channels.
   Sherman said he didn't expect the broadcasts to resume anytime
soon because Alabama charges remain in force against Home Dish and
GTE Spacenet, the satellite operating arm of GTE.
   Also remaining under indictment in Alabama is the U.S. Satellite
Corp. of Utah, which operates a ground station to beam
transmissions to communications satellites.
   The four Home Dish executives Cuomo refused to extradite were
company Chairman Paul Klein; his wife Janet Klein, the company's
vice president; President Jeffrey Younger; and Treasurer Robert
Kramer.
   Klein, a former executive vice president for programming at NBC,
is working as an independent producer, said Sherman.
   Evans' move against Home Dish has drawn fire from First
Amendment activists.
   ``Without proving that anything is obscene, Jimmy Evans has
succeeded in bankrupting this company (Home Dish) and keeping the
rest of the country from seeing these movies in the privacy of
their home,'' Martin McCaffery, vice president of the Civil
Liberties Union of Alabama, said recently.
   Evans, however, called the satellite transmissions, ``a national
scandal ... I know from experience that hard-core obscenity leads
to the abuse of women and children.''

<HEAD>Army Pursues Fleeing Rebels in Suriname</HEAD>

   Soldiers on Wednesday pursued Bush
Negro rebels into the jungle, where they fled a day earlier after
blowing up an aluminum company office building and a loading dock,
the army said.
   After a three-day battle with Jungle Commando rebels, government
forces on Tuesday recaptured the Suriname Aluminum Co. plant. There
were only ``a few lightly wounded'' among the soldiers, said army
spokesman Bradressein Sital.
   He said most of the rebels had fled after blowing up the plant's
main administration building and dock facilities at Moengo, about
50 miles northeast of Paramaribo, the capital. The rebels had held
the plant for two weeks.
   There was no word on rebel casualties.
   Sital said the army had ``succeeded in liberating Moengo'' and
was ``mopping up'' and chasing rebels in the jungle bush Wednesday.
   Suriname Aluminum Company spokesman Ewald Refos said there were
no injuries among the company's 330 employees at Moengo. He said a
decision on resuming production would be made by company
headquarters in Pittsburgh. The Suriname Aluminum Company is a
subsidiary of the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa).
   The plant processes bauxite, the main component in aluminum and
alumina, which together account for 75 percent of Suriname's
exports and 15 percent of the gross national product.
   The Jungle Commando, with 200 to 300 guerrillas, has fought a
four-year insurgency to improve conditions for Bush Negroes, about
10 percent of the South American nation's 415,000 mostly
Dutch-speaking population. Bush Negroes are descendants of runaway
slaves.
   Rebels had seized the bauxite plant to pressure the government
led by President Ramsewak Shankar into implementing a tentative
peace accord signed in June 1989.
   Meanwhile, Jungle Commando leader Ronnie Brunswijk, a former
army sergeant, remained in neighboring French Guiana under
administrative detention.
   Brunswijk was detained by immigration officials Monday night at
Rochambeau International Airport while trying to board a flight to
the Netherlands with false identity papers, French officials said.
The Netherlands is Suriname's former colonial ruler.
   He was quoted by French Guiana Television as saying he was tired
of fighting and wanted to give up his guerrilla campaign.

   Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, collapsed in his
office Wednesday and was admitted to Walter Reed Army Medical
Center for treatment of a kidney stone, a spokeswoman said.
   ``His legs kind of went out from under him,'' said Louise
Hilsen, Eckart's press secretary.
   Eckart was examined by a doctor and emergency medical team on
duty at the Capitol and then taken to Walter Reed, where he was
admitted around 1 p.m., Hilsen said.
   ``He is resting uncomfortably,'' she said. ``He is in a great

   Eckart, 40, had no previous kidney problems, she said.

<HEAD>Iowa Senator Calls for New Pentagon Waste Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senator said he wanted another Pentagon
investigation of procurement waste after learning the Air Force
bought jet engine pliers for $999 a pair, just under a $1,000
ceiling implemented as a reform.
   U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, has asked the Pentagon's
inspector general to take another look at acquisitions abuse over
the custom-made pliers that contractor Pratt &amp; Whitney sold to the
Air Force, The Miami Herald reported Wednesday.
   The maker of the pliers, City Tool of Florida, charged Pratt &amp;
Whitney $669 a pair for the pliers, the newspaper said. The
contractor added $330 to the price of each pair to the Air Force,
the Herald said.
   The final price fell just $1 shy of a rule that requires the
military to buy directly from manufacturers for items that cost
$1,000 or more, the newspaper said.
   Other recent military spending includes $1,868 for toilet covers
for C-5 cargo planes, $120 for cup dispensers and $117 for
soap-dish covers, the Herald said.
   An Air Force official and a Pratt &amp; Whitney spokesman defended
the amount charged for the pliers.
   Pratt &amp; Whitney, based in Palm Beach County, ``did warranty the
item. They did make sure the item was made in accordance with the
drawings, with all the necessary checks and compliance and
whatnot,'' said Cliff Goodhue, a cost analyst at the Air Force
Logistics Command headquarters in Ohio.
   ``Perhaps $999 was a bargain for this item after all,'' he said.
   A crackdown on military waste began in 1985 by then-Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger when a $435 hammer topped a list of
costly Pentagon purchases. The effort produced the $1,000 rule,
among other reforms.
   Pratt &amp; Whitney decided the performance of 20-year-old F-111
engines could be improved by installing new exhaust gas deflectors,
but unique curved pliers were needed to hold new clips in place,
the Herald said.
   ``The Air Force concurred that the price was correct and
appropriate for what they needed to do,'' said Pratt &amp; Whitney
spokesman Robert G.H. Carroll III.

   A truck carrying hazardous chemicals
was involved in a highway crash and burst into flames, killing at
least two people, authorities said.
   The flatbed truck carried 55-gallon drums containing various
flammable and explosive chemicals from Exxon Chemical Co. of
Houston, said fire Capt. Bud Gale. Firefighters decided to let the
82 drums and the vehicles burn because the blaze didn't pose a
threat to the rural area, Gale said.
   Few details were availible, but it appeared that two other
vehicles were involved in the crash, said Lincoln County sheriff's
Cpl. Mike Dye. Firefighters at the scene reported two dead, Gale
said.
   The crash took place about 5:45 p.m. on U.S. 83, 15 miles south
of North Platte in central Nebraska.
   A half-mile area was cleared, but officials didn't know how many
people in the sparsely settled area were affected by the
evacuation, Gale said.

   The spread of AIDS is slowing among some
gay men, but soaring among teen-agers, women, crack smokers and
heavy drinkers, researchers reported Wednesday on the opening day
of the international AIDS conference.
   ``In particular, the emergence of crack cocaine use as a risk
factor for the transmission of HIV is a new and disturbing
development in the epidemiology of AIDS,'' said Don C. Des Jarlais
of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. HIV is the
virus that causes AIDS.
   About 80 protesters were arrested outside Moscone Center, where
1,800 reporters and 12,000 delegates to the Sixth International
Conference on AIDS gathered for the presetation of new research.
Demonstrators contended the federal government is dragging its feet
in the search for a cure for AIDS.
   The arrests, mostly on misdemeanor charges of interfering with
police officers, came after about 300 protesters gathered outside
the center, chanting such things as, ``We're here, we're queer and
we demand access.''
   Some of those arrested hopped barricades and sat down on
sidewalks. Others were arrested for blocking streets.
   ACT UP members have scheduled a series of demonstrations
focusing on their contention that the federal government is
dragging its feet in the search for a cure for AIDS.
   Inside the convention center, the conference opened with
researchers criticizing the policies of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service that allow foreigners with AIDS virus
infections to be barred from the United States.
   More than 100 groups boycotted the meeting in opposition to that
policy, said Dr. John L. Ziegler, chairman of the conference.
   ``The conference organizers also oppose the U.S. immigration
policy in the strongest possible terms,'' Ziegler said.
   Peter Staley, an activist with the militant AIDS Coalition to
Unleash Power, or ACT UP, criticized President George Bush for
staying away from the conference.
   Staley incited some of the delegates to begin chanting, ``Three
hundred thousand dead from AIDS. Where is George?''
   Mayor Art Agos noted that after last year's earthquake Congress
gave San Francisco $4 billion and California passed a special tax
to help the city ``retrofit our physical infrastructure.''
   ``But where,'' said Agnos, ``is our retrofit for AIDS?''
   A few hours earlier, a member of ACT UP disrupted a symposium on
AIDS drugs when he stood in the audience at the Masonic Auditorium
and refused to be silenced.
   The disruption prompted doctors discussing a report on a new
AIDS drug to leave the stage. Their presentation later was
televised to the audience from a room in the rear of the Nob Hill
auditorium.
   ACT UP member G'dali Braverman of New York said afterward that
he had ``no intention of disrupting this meeting. We wanted to get
our information across'' about the drug DDC, developed by Hoffman
LaRoche, which sponsored the symposium.
   Des Jarlais is one of the authors of ``AIDS: The Second
Decade,'' an attempt to summarize all existing information on the
likely future course of the epidemic. It was prepared by experts
assembled by the National Research Council of the National Academy
of Sciences.
   The report, presented earlier in the day, offered little ground
for optimism.
   ``We believe the picture of AIDS and HIV infection in the
foreseeable future is one of a continuing toll of sickness and
death for a steadily broadening profile of individuals,'' Des
Jarlais told reporters.
   Populations not previously thought to be at special risk for
AIDS infection are suddenly becoming infected, he said.
   ``The disease is moving out of the large urban centers,'' he
said.
   Women are being more seriously affected. The proportion of AIDS
cases in women has grown from 6 percent in 1982 to 10 percent in
1989, Des Jarlais and his colleagues found.
   Younger gay men are putting themselves at risk by practicing
unsafe sex at twice the rate of older gay men, said Thomas J.
Coates of the University of California, San Francisco. Older gay
men are more likely to use condoms, a safer sexual practice that
cuts the risk of HIV being spread.
   ``New people are entering this pool and they consider themselves
invulnerable,'' Coates said.
   In New York City, 1 percent of black and Hispanic teen-age
mothers are infected with HIV, Des Jarlais said.
   Alcohol, too, is associated with the spread of AIDS because,
like crack, it often leads to unsafe sexual behavior, the
researchers said.
   The Rev. Cecil Williams of the Glide United Methodist Church in
San Francisco's drug-plagued Tenderloin district, who has worked
with crack users, said the panel's findings confirmed his
observations.
   ``Women are the prime recipients of crack cocaine,'' said
Williams, who was not connected with the report. ``It heightens
sexual intensity. It gives sick people a feeling of being
completely free.''
   The blood supply is safer than ever, said Cladd E. Stevens of
the New York Blood Center. She said infections from
AIDS-contaminated blood are occurring at the rate of one for every
50,000 to 250,000 units of blood transfused.
   Some 4 million Americans get blood transfusions each year and 80
to 400 of them are getting AIDS from the transfusions, she said.
   The National Research Council also found that female prostitutes
``do not appear to be serving as a bridge for HIV transmission into
the larger heterosexual population.''
   The explanation may be that many are using condoms or engaging
in oral sex, which could reduce the risk of transmission, Des
Jarlais said.
   The panel endorsed efforts to educate the public to the dangers
of AIDS and to tell intravenous drug users that using clean
syringes can help prevent the spread of AIDS.
   ``The fears of some that explicit sexual messages or the
availability of clean syringes may entice the uninitiated into
sexual activity or drug use is not borne out by the facts,'' Des
Jarlais said.

   About 80 AIDS activists were arrested
Wednesday on the opening day of an international conference on the
deadly disease, part of a coordinated effort to make their concerns
known to the public.
   The activists have created a polished organization for the Sixth
International Conference on AIDS, with banks of computers, media
advance people and a schedule of events complete with a theme for
the day.
   Despite some earlier calls for riot and anarchy, the AIDS
Coalition to Unleash Power, known as ACT UP, and several other
groups have joined together to coordinate an agenda of protest and
politicking before the 12,000 conference delegates and national
media.
   ``Everybody is playing off the same sheet,'' said Paul Feldman,
a member of Seattle's ACT UP chapter, one of the media coordinators
during the five-day conference.
   Protesters outside the Moscone Center on Wednesday hopped
barricades and sat down on sidewalks and streets. Most of the 80
arrested were charged with the misdemeanor of interfering with
police officers, authorities said.
   While the conference headquarters are in lush digs at the
Marriott and Moscone Center, Feldman and his crew operate out of a
room at the Best Western down the street from the bus terminal.
   The room is a smorgasbord of Apples and other computers owned by
individual activists, TV monitors and video recorders, fax machines
and telephones.
   The group has issued a schedule for the week with times and
locations for demonstrations. Each day has a theme: Wednesday was
protests over restricted access to research, treatment and the
conference itself. Thursday's activities will stress what
protesters say are instances of government inaction and corporate
profit.
   But there will be other activities not on information sheets
faxed to various media. Feldman said many actions are expected by
``affinity groups,'' clusters of a dozen or so people who may
decide on an impromptu move to disrupt a meeting or stage some show
for the cameras.
   ``Very often they will decide to do an independent action to
bring attention to their concern,'' he said.
   That happened Tuesday during a march of 1,000 people protesting
U.S. travel restrictions placed on foreigners infected with the
AIDS virus.
   Eight people broke from the crowd as it approached Immigration
and Naturalization Service offices, climbed over barricades and
were quickly arrested. Feldman said that action was not part of the
plan for the march.
   No one has a count on the number of activists who have come to
San Francisco for the conference. Feldman believes most of the 40
ACT UP U.S. chapters are already represented, along with members
from 25 foreign chapters. He said the turnout for Tuesday's march
was larger than expected.
   The degree of organization among the activists follows months of
preparations among groups at times at odds over questions of policy
and action.
   Some activists, like Larry Kramer of New York's ACT UP, called
for riots at the conference. Others have argued against disrupting
the conference and the flow of information about the disease.
   Feldman said although there is a degree of organization among
the many voices, there is still great independence.
   ``I said we're all playing off the same sheet, it's just that
there's no paper it's written on.''

<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Arch A. Moore Jr., who
faces up to 36 years in prison, wants to renege on his guilty pleas
to five federal counts involving political corruption, it was
reported Wednesday.
   Moore's attorney planned to write U.S. District Judge Walter E.
Hoffman indicating that Moore wants to back out of his plea
agreement with the Justice Department, WSAZ-TV and the
Herald-Dispatch of Huntington, reported, citing anonymous sources.
   The Charleston Gazette reported rumors of Moore's plans in its
Thursday editions.
   Moore's wife, Shelley, said he wasn't at his Glen Dale home and
wasn't available to comment Wednesday night.
   His attorney, William Hundley, didn't return a phone call to his
Washington, D.C., office.
   The prosecutor, U.S. Attorney Michael Carey in Charleston,
refused to comment, as did the judge.
   Moore, 68, pleaded guilty May 8 to extortion, mail fraud, tax
fraud and obstruction of justice.
   The three-term Republican governor is scheduled to be sentenced
July 10. He faces up to 36 years in prison and $1.2 million in
fines.
   Moore, once a political powerhouse in West Virginia, admitted
illegal acts during his 1984 campaign, his 1985-89 term and his
1988 re-election campaign.
   He admitted to extorting more than $500,000 from coal operator
H. Paul Kizer while he was in office in return for a $2.3 million
refund from the state's Black Lung Fund, which provides benefits to
coal miners.
   He also admitted he tried to block a federal grand jury
investigation into corruption in his administration.
   Under the deal with the U.S. attorney's office, Moore agreed to
cooperate with federal investigators looking into political
corruption in West Virginia.
   The federal probe so far has resulted in more than 10
convictions of former state officials and lobbyists.
   Moore was governor from 1969 to 1977. He was elected again in
1984, but was defeated in a 1988 bid for re-election by Democrat
Gaston Caperton.
   Defendants who have pleaded guilty can seek to change their plea
by petitioning the court before they are sentenced, but that is
unusual.
   It isn't uncommon for a defendant to try to pull out of a plea
bargain, but few succeed, said House Speaker Chuck Chambers, a
lawyer and a Democrat. Defendants usually argue that they were
coerced into entering the plea, or that they were inadequately
represented by their lawyers, he said.

   About 900 people said prayers, sang hymns
and hugged Wednesday night during a memorial service for 22 people
killed in a flash flood last week.
   Gov. Richard Celeste told mourners the flood demonstrated the
power of nature and the resilience of the human spirit. He offered
a prayer for the victims.
   ``We have learned again of your power. Sometimes it's a dreadful
power beyond our imagination,'' Celeste said. ``But in our shock
and pain and grief we learn of the power of the human family. And
we reach out, share a hand and warm embrace.''
   The 45-minute service was held at Shadyside High School's
football field under threatening skies.
   Earlier in the day, authorities urged about 150 people to leave
their homes in this eastern Ohio village because of the threat of
storms, but the call for an evacuation was later lifted. Only about
12 people had gone to a shelter set up at an elementary school,
volunteer Barb Geer said.
   Vice President Dan Quayle offered his condolences to Shadyside
in a letter read at the memorial service.
   Two roses, a red one for adults who died and a yellow one for
children, rested on a pulpit in the middle of the football field.
Members of the Shadyside Volunteer Fire Department received a
standing ovation from the crowd.
   One evacuee Wednesday at the elementary school, 65-year-old
James Saffle, said he was still shaken from last Thursday's flood.
   ``All these people are dead. All your friends are gone, and you
don't understand how. You can't understand it unless you go through
it,'' he said.
   A wall of water surged down the Wegee and Pipe creek valleys and
the Ohio River, washing away houses, cars and anything else in its
path. The dead have been found in debris along the creeks and in
the river.
   The National Guard, Ohio Department of Transportation officials
and volunteers have been working to clear the creek of debris that
would cause runoff from a storm to back up and cause more flooding.
   Clearing efforts have been slow in some areas where obstructions
were removed by hand in a search of victims.
   Local officials and volunteers, meanwhile, worked to reduce the
number of people reported missing since the flood. Twelve names
remained on the list Wednesday, down from 60 listed as possibly
missing the day after the storm.
   Capt. Jim Boling of the Ohio adjutant general's office said it
was questionable whether seven of the 11 still listed as missing on
Wednesday were actually missing, ``but we're not going to remove
their names until that is confirmed.''

   Nelson Mandela, a freedom fighter who became one
of the world's most celebrated political prisoners, headed for the
United States today looking for money and moral support for his
battle against apartheid.
   In New York _ the first stop on a 12-day, eight-city U.S. tour _
a hero's welcome was in store for the deputy president of the
African National Congress, including a ticker-tape parade up
Broadway and a rally at Yankee Stadium.
   Along with the festivities celebrating the end of Mandela's
27-year imprisonment in South Africa will be meetings with
business, religious and political leaders. Mandela, making his
first U.S. visit, is scheduled to speak at the United Nations and
meet in Washington with President Bush.
   His message: keep the economic sanctions and international
pressure in place until the white South African government gives up
its monopoly on power and ends all vestiges of racial segregation.

   House Democrats frustrated by a stalemate with
President Bush over budget cuts and taxes are starting to
appropriate spending for next year, beginning with $20.8 billion
for energy and water projects.
   Ignoring the absence of an overall budget accord, the House
voted 355-59 Tuesday to raise by $350 million what Bush would spend
in fiscal 1991 to clean up the nation's atomic weapons complex. The
House vote also would launch 25 water projects opposed by the
administration.
   ``What the House has done is to flaunt or doom the (budget)
summit,'' said Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., as several efforts to
cut the spending were defeated. ``This is something that is going
to get this house in great trouble.''
   The measure is the first of 13 appropriation bills for the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 to pass either the House or Senate.
Until Tuesday, congressional leaders had stalled action in hopes of
reaching an overall budget agreement with the White House.

much haste.
   ``It's going to be close,'' Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, said
Tuesday as his House Judiciary Committee sent the measure to the
full House for a vote Thursday. ``It would be close this week, it
would be close next week.''
   Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., agreed with that assessment.
   Brooks said the 19-17 vote by which the panel sent the measure
to the floor _ with no recommendation for or against _ was a sign
that the final outcome also would be by a narrow margin.

   The massacre of eight people by a man with a rifle
could undercut the powerful gun lobby at a time when Florida voters
are considering a constitutional amendment imposing a three-day
wait on handgun purchases.
   ``Anytime you have a tragedy, those people with hidden agendas
see any and every emotional opportunity to try to justify their
erroneous position and try to deprive the people of their rights,''
said Marian Hammer, spokeswoman for the National Rifle
Association's Florida branch.
   The debate over the amendment on November's ballot intensified
after James Edward Pough, 42, a day laborer, killed eight people
Monday with a semiautomatic rifle before taking his own life with a
revolver at an auto loan agency. Police said Pough also killed two
people on the street Sunday with the rifle.
   ``How many messages do we send to the Congress? How many to the

   Billions of dollars worth of Soviet and U.S. weapons have kept
the war going between the Marxist government and Jonas Savimbi's

<HEAD>Party's Over For Bride-Seeking Pyrenees Village</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN STOCKING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PLAN, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This village in the Pyrenees needs eight
brides for eight bachelors, but has decided it can't afford to pay
$50,000 for them.
   Five years ago, in an attempt to keep the village from dying,
the bachelors of Plan advertised a three-day party to which young,
single women were invited.
   The event attracted international attention, became a yearly
affair and led to more than 30 marriages, nearly all the couples
moved away. Plan still has eight bachelors looking for wives.
   It also became very expensive and the village has decided to
skip a year, said Miguel Angel Fumanal, president of the Plan
Bachelor's Association. He said it does not have the $50,000 needed
to bring in women from across Spain by bus, pay their expenses and
throw the party.
   ``We'll take a sabbatical ... and use the time to think about
what to do next year,'' he said.
   Plan is a picture-postcard town nestled among snowcapped peaks
above a rushing river, 12 miles from the French border. Old stone
houses line its narrow cobblestone streets.
   There is not much for young people to do except look at the
spectacular scenery or drink beer in the village bar. On a recent
evening, there were eight men in the bar and no women.
   The inspiration for the first party came to a similar crowd in
the bar in January 1985. While watching the American movie
``Westward the Women'' on television, the bachelors decided to do
just what the frontiersmen did: import women.
   In the movie, the goal was to create a new town. The plan in
Plan, whose population had declined from 300 to less than 200, was
to save an old one.
   ``The parties boosted morale,'' said the Rev. Jacinto Brallans,
Plan's Roman Catholic priest, who presided at the marriages of
several couples who met at the annual fiestas. ``Young men who have
to live alone in a little town like Plan get discouraged.''
   Brallans said similar problems could be found in many European
villages, where farm families had to decide whether to break up
their small holdings or pass all the land on to the eldest son.
   If the eldest gets it all, which is often the case, younger
brothers and sisters move to the cities, he said.
   ``Many people have left this town,'' said Jose Prer, a
74-year-old farmer who has spent his life in Plan. ``There's no
work here.''
   ``Something important was happening here'' with the annual
party, Brallans said. ``The people were fighting to survive.''
   When they put the ad in a newspaper in Zaragoza, the nearest big
town, Plan's bachelors thought few people would notice.
   They were wrong. The event was publicized as far away as China.
It attracted 100 eligible women, who were brought to Plan by bus
from Barcelona, Madrid and Zaragoza, and more than 1,000 other
people came to watch.
   Outside interest slackened after the first year, however, and
the donations needed to finance it began drying up.
   Of the couples married as a result of the five annual parties,
two have remained in Plan, eight live in four neighboring towns of
the Gistau Valley and the rest moved farther away, Brallans said.
   Benefits are visible. A new pharmacy, hotel-restaurant and
beauty salon have opened in Plan, and Brallans said the population
had stabilized at about 200.
   Jose Maria Fantova, a 35-year-old bachelor, feels optimistic.
He's building a market and intends to stay in the village.
   The fiestas attracted enough tourists to fill the hotel in July
and August, and a ski resort might show the way to a brighter
future for Plan, Fantova said.

<HEAD>Vanity, The Root of Evil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When highly successful business people suddenly
lose their magic touch, often at what seems the apex of their
careers, you may find vanity plays a role in the drama.
   Vanity combined with financial leverage and economic cyclicality
often drive their success. The trio are the heroes of the ascent.
Ironically, they are also the villains of the decline.
   You can find them at work in stocks, bonds and commodities, in
Las Vegas and Atlantic City, in real estate, merchandising,
banking, politics. They are eager supporters in the ascent, savage
enemies in the fall.
   You can find two or all three in the major downfalls of business
history, in the savings and loan collapses, in the bankruptcy of
the Hunt brothers who thought they could corner the silver market,
in Ivan Boesky, the investor.
   They are current in the affairs of William Farley, who tried to
expand his textile empire before he had the money to pay for it,
and of Robert Campeau, who became one of the world's biggest
retailers and then lost it all.
   The three bad actors are especially prominent in building and
real estate and are on stage in most real estate collapses. They
are visible and vocal in the affairs of several real estate gurus
who rose from nothing and returned to it.
   Decades ago they helped bring down William Zeckendorf, one of
the most famous real estate men of his time, the man who assembled
the land on which the United Nations stands. And today they are
involved in Donald Trump's problems.
   The scenario is deadly clear, whether it evolves on the smallest
of stages or the largest. An example:
   In the 1970s, inflation raged. Those who kept savings in the
bank saw them wither because interest rates earned were in the
single digits while the buying power of money shrank at double
digit rates.
   While inflation shriveled the value of money, it caused the
prices of hard assets to soar. The value of money in the bank
deteriorated; the value of money in real estate soared. Savvy
people flocked to real estate.
   Bankers took notice. Not only did they lend money to building
developers but they took a piece of the action themselves. Bankers
sought out the more daring, dramatic and successful developers and
shoveled money at them.
   Inflation continued. Developers succeeded. Lenders lent. How
could you lose? Some developers believed they couldn't, and some of
the lenders tended to agree with them. The borrowers borrowed more,
the lenders lent them more.
   Leverage became the name of the game. The squeamish warned that
it was dangerous to borrow so freely, especially with interest
rates rising, but the daring ones were convinced they had mastered
the magic formula.
   Then the economy began cooling, and as it cooled the inflation
rates began falling. The jobless rate began rising. People couldn't
buy houses and apartments, and they couldn't afford the high rents.
The game was over.
   As the economy came plunging down into the recession of the
early 1980s, it toppled those who felt they could do not wrong, who
leveraged themselves, who allowed their vanity to violate their own
good judgment.
   Looking back, almost every one of those involved in that debacle
knew that the laws of good banking, the principles of business and
the economic cycle had not been revoked. But they chose not to
think about it.
   Instead, their successes inflated their confidence and their
confidence allowed them to borrow beyond reason. In their clouded
minds they knew it had to end someday, but they chose instead to be
guided by their vanity.
   Hadn't that vanity given them the courage to build empires? Why,
then, should they not rely on it just once more? Just one more
time, they said, while they sought to put a crown on their
achievements.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's all right there in the fine print: nearly
$6 trillion worth of credit and insurance commitments held by the
federal government, potential liabilities that dwarf the savings
and loan bailout.
   Every chance he gets, Richard G. Darman, the administration's
budget director, tries to get people to pay attention to that
accumulation of contingent liabilities. He hasn't had a lot of
success so far. The commitments involved are arcane, complex and
almost invisible, until something goes wrong.
   But the price of guaranteed credit and federally backed
insurance has been going up, and not only in the savings and loan
crisis. Darman says there should be tighter control and supervision
of underwriting risks that now are outside the discipline of the
federal budget system.
   He also has suggested an overall ceiling on government loans,
guarantees and insurance. The dollar value of those commitments has
increased nearly sevenfold over the past 20 years. The biggest
single increase is in deposit insurance on accounts in banks,
savings and loans and credit unions, now covered up to $100,000 a
deposit. The total deposit insurance outstanding now runs to about
$3 trillion.
   The credit and insurance programs have little visible impact on
the budget, which has made them politically alluring in Congress,
where budgeted funds are hard to find as the government grapples
with its chronic deficits.
   There are loans and guarantees that benefit farmers, retired
workers, students, veterans, home buyers, small businesses and
other groups. In addition, there are government sponsored
enterprises, created with federal backing to make it easier to get
loans for houses, farming, and higher education.
   Those are broad and powerful constituencies.
   No president and no Congress would risk undoing the benefits
they reap. But the Bush administration wants credit reform, tighter
supervision, and a recognition of the liabilities, the risks that
weren't acknowledged when the savings and loan crisis began to take
shape.
   In the administration's budget, Darman wrote that the purposes
of federal credit support are generally worthy ones. ``But there
can be no denying that there is an enormous and increasing federal
exposure _ approaching one trillion dollars in direct and federally
guaranteed loans alone.'' He said that is virtually certain to
involve tens of billions of dollars in future claims against the
government. So are future claims against federal insurance programs.
   Darman says those costs will be manageable, so long as they are
recognized and handled on an orderly basis. ``Too little attention
was paid in the past to the scope and scale of these commitments,
and often the government's potential exposure was understated or
ignored,'' Darman said in his budget essay last winter.
   Ever since, at congressional hearings, in television appearances
and in interviews, Darman has been trying to call all that to
national attention, so that hidden liabilities do not swell into
staggering costs until it is too late to do anything except pay
them.
   While most of the guaranteed loans won't end up in default, and
most of the insurance won't lead to claims against the government,
federal losses have been increasing, largely, but not entirely
because of the savings and loan crisis.
   In 1989, there were $14.4 billion in bad loan losses, compared
with $3.7 billion in 1982. Insurance costs totaled $67.2 billion in
1989, almost all of that to cover losses at more than 400 failed
savings and loans and banks. And that was only a down payment on
the S&amp;L bailout.
   There are other trouble signals.
   _The Federal Housing Administration, which insures home
mortgages, lowering the down payment and making them available to
people who couldn't get loans otherwise, has been losing money
since 1988, for the first time in its 50 years. Facing the prospect
of continuing losses that could bankrupt the government's mutual
mortgage insurance fund by the end of the decade, the
administration has recommended tighter rules and higher fees for
borrowers.
   _Government insurance covers $1 trillion worth of pension
benefits, and while that fund has been running a deficit, a Supreme
Court decision on Monday eased the problem. The ruling broadened
the power of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. to force employers
to restore terminated pension plans, instead of leaving the cost to
the government insurance fund.
   The fund still has a $1 billion deficit, and its director told a
House hearing last week that business failures could send that up
sharply.
   In each instance, as Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, said of the FHA
mortgage insurance, losses will eventually have to be covered by
the federal government.
   ``That means the taxpayers,'' he said.

   The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) appears
ready to turn the corner on one of the largest membership losses in
the history of Christianity by the next millennium, according to a
new three-year study of the church.
   The Rev. John Mulder, president of Louisville Presbyterian
Seminary and one of the directors of the study, said a group of
people are emerging within the church to find a middle ground
between the battle lines set up by strident liberals and
conservatives.
   ``What we're seeing in the '90s is this mobilization of the
moderate middle,'' Mulder said. ``I would look toward the middle or
the late '90s as the point the Presbyterian Church would begin to
reverse some of the losses, or at least stabilize.''
   The Presbyterian Church, which reached a high of about 4.4
million in the mid-'60s, lost more than 43,000 members last year to
fall to below 2.9 million. The church adopted evangelism and church
development as its two priority goals at its General Assembly last
year.
   At the recent General Assembly meeting here, Stated Clerk James
E. Andrews, the denomination's chief executive, indicated the
effort is starting to pay off.
   Declaring ``ours is a vital denomination,'' he reported
increases in adult and infant baptisms. He also said professions of
faith increased after years of steady decline, ``a preliminary
indication that our steady loss of membership can be reversed.''
   Newly elected Moderator Price Henderson Gwynn III of Charlotte,
N.C., said the denomination could grow to 5 million members by the
year 2000 as long as it stops the internal bickering.
   ``If we shoot ourselves in the foot because of internecine
warfare or denominational myopia, we are going to have to answer
for it,'' he said.
   The study entitled ``Presbyterians in the 20th Century: A Case
Study of American Protestantism,'' involved 55 different research
projects done by 65 researchers, Mulder said. The first volume of a
projected seven-volume series on the study was released last month.
   The study was privately funded by the Lilly Endowment.
   In an interview at the General Assembly meeting, Mulder said
demographics played a large role in the denomination's decline. The
post-war baby boomers have delayed marriage and having children,
and are having fewer children overall.
   But that doesn't fully explain the disproportionate losses
endured by mainline churches, he said.
   He said the research showed many young people who grew up in
mainline churches are not leaving for other churches, but are
giving up on organized religion. Mulder said the ``porous'' kinds
of religious traditions in the churches makes it ``easy to join,
but it's also easy to leave.''
   The study found an increasing pluralism in beliefs and moral
behavior that puts the church at ``risk of losing a clear and
well-defined identity,'' Mulder said.
   In addition, he said the church dealt itself some
``self-inflicted blows'' by reducing its support for new church
development and campus ministry.
   But Mulder said there are hopeful signs within the denomination,
which has gone beyond a ``massive denial'' of membership trends to
a growing awareness of the problem.
   In the Presbyterian Church, where surveys have shown most
members take neither extreme coservative or liberal positions,
Mulder said over the last two or three years groups such as
Presbyterians for Renewal have developed that offer an alternative
to the special interest groups that he said have sapped much of the
church's energies.
   ``One of the things that I think is going on is the emergence of
a moderate middle,'' he said.
   The development of a new statement of faith is another sign the
church is trying to develop a better balance between spirituality
and social witness, and maintain its identity in a secular soceity,
he said.
   ``I think the statement of faith is a reflection of the church's
ability, even in the face of considerable diversity, we are still
capable of forming a unified statement of Christian belief that is
consistent with our tradition,'' Mulder said.
   The pessimism with which he and others approached the research
project has been replaced with a more optimistic outlook, Mulder
said.
   ``In the face of what are some obvious `problems,' this is still
a remarkably strong and vital church.''

<TEXT>
   Brandon Tartikoff, the child prodigy of
television, is approaching middle age and so, say some, is his
prime-time schedule.
   Like an admonishing father, the president of NBC entertainment
recently accused upstart Fox Broadcasting Co. of pandering. At
NBC's annual convention for affiliated stations two weeks ago, the
41-year-old former Wunderkind admitted his proud peacock had
``strayed a bit'' last season with bombs such as ``Hardball'' and
``Baywatch.''
   NBC still is the No. 1 network and Tartikoff still is credited
with bringing it from last to first place during his 10-year
tenure. But things are not the same.
   The accolades that once flowed like an open faucet have slowed
to a drip. Adjectives like ``genius'' and ``brilliant'' no longer
precede almost every mention of his name.
   In the last two years, he has been accused of playing it safe,
of introducing boring programs and relying too heavily on the
handful of mega-hits, including ``Cheers'' and ``The Cosby Show,''
that blasted NBC into first place five years ago after nearly three
decades at the bottom.
   Tartikoff knows why this is.
   ``The tired quotient has to do with columnists who are plain
tired of having to write about NBC's prime-time successes,'' he
says in his Burbank office on the behemoth NBC studio lot. ``There
isn't an adjective you can squeeze out of a thesaurus that hasn't
been applied to us.''
   He admits NBC has made mistakes, but he doesn't want to go
overboard. ``I think there were probably one or two or three more
mea culpas than should be allowed by law,'' delivered at the recent
affiliates convention, Tartikoff said.
   The upcoming fall season will be different, he promises. Nine
new series will be introduced. He is especially excited about
``Fresh Prince of Bel Air,'' starring Grammy-winning rapper Fresh
Prince, the medical series ``Signs of Life,'' brought to you by
Emmy-winning ``Hill Street Blues'' writer and producer Jeffrey
Lewis, and ``American Dreamer,'' starring Robert Urich and Carol
Kane of ``Taxi'' fame.
   ``I feel like there's been a return to the kind of development
that either got us into first place or kept us in first place,''
Tartikoff said. ``As opposed to the kind of stuff we had last
year.''
   In 1980, Tartikoff became the youngest entertainment president
in NBC's history, following in the footsteps of mentors Grant
Tinker and Fred Silverman. Seemingly, he could do no wrong.
   In a town full of executives with the depth of a puddle,
Tartikoff is a nice guy. He thanks you for accepting his call. He
doesn't wear Armani suits, call you ``babe'' or ask you to do lunch
at Le Dome. He does speak his mind, however. And over the years,
that has caused him a few problems.
   A few years back, he called Fox ``the coat hanger network.'' Two
weeks ago, he was quoted as saying Fox shows ``pander to the worst
aspects of the American TV audience. They assume people don't read
_ every reference is to other TV shows. They don't ask the audience
to aspire to anything.''
   Some TV columnists had a field day with that one. Tartikoff,
they reminded readers, was the man who brought you ``Manimal,'' a
show about a guy who could turn into a snake, a panther or a wolf,
and a Geraldo Rivera special on Satanism that included, among other
gruesome nuggets, a segment on devil worshippers who skinned human
babies.
   But back to the fall.
   With ``The Cosby Show'' beginning its seventh season in
September (or thereabouts), ``Cheers'' turning nine, and ``The
Golden Girls'' starting its sixth year, NBC has some of the oldest
shows on prime-time television.
   When the Nielsen numbers came in for the 1989 fall season, NBC
was on top, but it had won with the lowest prime-time ratings in
its history.
   Tartikoff struggles to rise above this. NBC is the defending
champ, after all, and No. 1 is No. 1, no matter how the deck is
cut. He has been doing this job far longer than counterparts Bob
Iger at ABC and Jeff Sagansky at CBS.
   In fact, no one in television history has been head of
entertainment at one network longer than Tartikoff.
   But Iger has stolen Tartikoff's thunder _ most notably with the
overwhelming success of ``America's Funniest Home Videos'' and the
critical acclaim of ``Twin Peaks.''
   Fox has been equally blessed with its runaway hits ``The
Simpsons'' and ``Married ... With Children,'' both of which made
television history this week by breaking into Nielsen's top five.
   ``I don't have a shadow of a doubt that we'll be continue to be
the No. 1 network,'' Tartikoff said. ``There's nothing that I feel
ashamed about. We played a good game last year. We've played better
games, but we still won the championship. And no one else even came
close.''

   You can't blame investors in gold and other
precious metals right now if they have trouble understanding why
the Federal Reserve is so worried about inflation.
   Traditionally, gold has been one of the most reliable ways to
bet on inflation, and thus protect the purchasing power of your
money from increases in the cost of living.
   So, by superficial logic at least, the price of gold should be
mirroring some of the same worries that have prompted the Fed to
stick with an inflation-fighting strategy licies of
late.in its credit po
   Instead, gold has fallen to its lowest levels in four years,
trading below $350 an ounce against slightly more than $400 just a
few months ago.
   For the many American savers and investors who keep a part of
their nest eggs in precious metals investments as a bulwark against
disaster, this kind of experience has become familiar in recent
years.
   After flourishing in the inflation-ridden 1970s, gold turned in
a lackluster showing in the '80s as confidence revived in competing
paper investments such as stocks and bonds. The peak gold price of
around $875 an ounce in early 1980 now seems long ago and far away.
   In the eyes of many an analyst, there is no immediate rebound in
sight. ``Given my optimistic ijor political changes in the two biggest
gold-producing nations, the Soviet Union and South Africa.
   Also, periodic waves of selling have been reported from Saudi
Arabia, apparently prompted by a need for funds that oil revenues
hasn't been able to meet.
   ``The increase in the supplies of gold coming on the markets (or
potential supplies) does not bode well for the price of gold in the
near future,'' says Gray Emerson Cardiff in his advisory letter
Sound Advice, based in Danville, Calif.
   But even with all the obstacles seemingly confronting them, the
precious metals have by no means been given up for finished by
everyone in the investment world.
   ``I believe the decade of the 1990s is going to offer
opportunities for tremendous profits in the precious metals, just
as in the 1970s,'' asserts Lawrence Heim, a Portland, Ore.,
investment advisor.
   ``I keep saying that eventually there will be a panic into gold
again. I really do believe it will happen and it will reflect the
outrageous amount of inflating (money creation) that has gone on
over the past decade.
   ``The huge annual deficits that have caused the national debt to
reach $3 trillion have not yet shown up as a corresponding gold
price rise.''
   Along with a sharp rise in gold, Heim is forecasting an even
bigger percentage increase in its poorer cousin, silver.
   Of course, it is a much different thing to speculate on
potential swings in the precious metals markets than it is to buy
and hold gold or silver as a hedge against trouble.
   For people who turn to precious metals in this manner as a kind
of insurance policy, there may be good reason to be pleased if that
investment never pays off.

<HEAD>Chelsea-BU Mark End of First Year of New Relationship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHELSEA, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All the symptoms are there: money worries,
bickering, lack of trust, poor communication and half-hearted
threats of divorce.
   After one year, the marriage between Boston University and
Chelsea's schools is a little rocky.
   The idea was to give the private university control of this
failing school district, with its high dropout rates, low grades
and even lower budgets. BU would get the prestige of operating this
unique and high-profile laboratory; Chelsea would benefit from BU's
educational and financial resources.
   But after Year One of the 10-year program, the university's goal
of stirring Chelsea's children _ as the public system could not _
is a long way off.
   Money still is short. It took more than eight tense months for
the teachers union to settle a contract with BU. The experiment is
being contested in the courts. Good intentions also have been
tangled in the knot of advisory and oversight committees, and in
the conflicting interests of the aldermen, school committee,
Hispanic community groups and parents.
   ``The biggest thing is getting through the mine fields of the
state in financial chaos, the city in chaos and all the petty
bickering,'' said Peter Greer, BU's dean of education and overseer
of the management project.
   BU installed Diane Lam as superintendent to engineer the 10-year
experiment, and she uses the marriage metaphor.
   ``Hopefully, it will be a love marriage that can develop
trust,'' she told the governor's committee appointed to watch over
the unusual relationship. ``Or it can be dissolved.''
   BU wants to remake the schools _ and attitudes about education _
in this working-class city of 26,000 people, many from Latin
American and Asia. Nearly one-third of the system's 3,500 students
come from families in which English is not the first language.
   Some programs were established this year, notably alternative
courses for kids with failing grades and after-school programs in
the elementary grades.
   Though 16-year-old Amy Sandelin endured a sometimes tumultuous
year under the new system, she's eager for her senior year, when
she will be in the new Renaissance School, which will allow her to
study what interests her most.
   The arrival of BU, Sandelin said with a smile, ``is really a
good opportunity to do something with this school. For a long time,
kids with potential, they lost them. Now a lot of kids feel there's
more opportunity.''
   Other programs are being tried on a small scale, limited only by
a lack of money. A literacy program, for example, teaches English
to two generations at once by having parents read to their children.
   BU's aim to boost teachers' low salaries and professional
opportunities was a hard-fought effort that seemed to take forever
to resolve.
   On June 13, the second to last day of school, the teachers union
finally accepted a contract that will increase their pay anywhere
from 24 percent to 28 percent over three years. The top salary for
teachers with bachelors degrees is now $27,813; with merit
increases, it will go up to $35,620.
   The contract also includes an advancement program for teachers
who are not interested in the administrative route.
   But the boldest, most expensive part of BU's plan _ to provide
health, nutrition and dental care for children from birth _ has
gone nowhere.
   Greer blames bad times in Massachusetts for a lack of money and
commitment from big foundations. Efforts to raise $3 million have
netted just $1.8 million in gifts and pledges, the biggest chunk
for computers and software.
   The city now is being asked to give the schools a $1.9 million
increase for the next school year over this year's $12 million
budget, mostly for salaries and special education, expenses that BU
donations are not allowed to pay.
   But money won't quell uncertainties among Chelsea residents and
among some teachers who feel the changes have come too fast.
   As Lorraine Ruby, an art teacher at Chelsea for 27 years put it:
``We know BU can really do good things here. We want to make sure
it's substantive. We're not a media event. We're real lives here.''
   Lam said much of this unease can be traced to the fact that,
``It's a new type of partnership, so we have not had a road map of
which direction to take. Change is always hard, and it makes people
anxious.''
   Fifty-one Chelsea residents and the Chelsea Teachers Union have
asked the state Supreme Court to declare the arrangement
unconstitutional. They say members of the Chelsea School Committee
have lost their voices in school policy since the university began
managing the school system a year ago.
   ``In all other cities and towns, the parents, voters and school
committees decide questions such as who will be superintendent or
the high school principal,'' said Juan Vega, a plaintiff. ``In
Chelsea, top educators are terminated in secret; no public
discussion is allowed, no reasons given. This is disrespectful to
the people of Chelsea.''
   Harold Raynolds, state commissioner of education, once
criticized the arrangement on those grounds _ the school committee,
he said, had abdicated its elected duty to a BU management team.
But he notes happily that the school committee and the managers now
meet monthly for a more cooperative effort.
   ``It is a major success that they are still there'' after a year
in operation, said Tom Shannon, executive director of the National
Association of School Boards in Alexandria, Va.
   ``To look for results in the first year is asking too much,''
said Shannon, whose organization represents the nation's 15,350
school districts and is closely watching the Chelsea project.
   ``What Chelsea will exemplify is what educators have known all
the time _ the growing season of education is a long, long time.
Don't look at your watch, look at your calendar.''

<TEXT>
   There is no mystery to the especially sharp
decline in building activity. The explanation is right there in the
numbers, on the record, in the pattern of past economic cycles.
   All of those indicate that the building business in its many
variations has a long history of anticipating ups and downs of the
economic cycle, and of reacting more sharply than others to changes.
   Illustration: When the economy in general weakens, as now, the
situation already is an old story to homebuilders. Their downturn
began months earlier. And, as in the past, the impact on them is
deeper than on other industries.
   May housing starts fell to their lowest since the 1982
recession, dropping to an annual rate of 1.207 million units, a
level reached after percentage declines of 1.4 in May, 6.4 in April
and 12.2 in March.
   Why should housing construction get the worst of downturns?
Simply because it often gets the best of upturns. When economic
times get better, they often get very much better in housing, and
when they get bad they get very bad.
   Conditions are poor now for many reasons, but playing a
prominent role is the inability of builders to obtain financing.
Again, as in the past, when lenders become reluctant lenders they
become especially so with builders.
   The reason lies in the nature of building, which is
entrepreneurial and speculative. The smallest and largest builders
borrow heavily to begin their projects, and all have the same grand
hopes of immediate sale on completion.
   Too often, lenders have seen builders produce a glut of product
at the very time the economy is beginning to tip into a new down
cycle. Too often they have been unable to collect their loans. Too
often they have seen bankruptcies.
   Reflecting unique conditions, loan officers are especially wary
of making bad loans these days, with regulators and their own
boards looking over their shoulders. High on their list of no-nos,
therefore, are builders.
   While housing and real estate people have long complained about
exaggerated impacts of economic policy, which periodically pushes
them into depression, they are especially upset now.
   Two headlines in Realtor News, a weekly publication, suggest the
mood. The first: ``Is unwarranted credit crunch unfairly hurting
real estate?'' The second: ``There's money _ but will they lend
it?''
   In a survey of 1,142 members of the National Association of Home
Builders, 60 percent said a credit crunch exists and that it is
hurting them, in spite of denials by bank regulators that a credit
crackdown has been imposed.
   Whatever the cause, the homebuilding industry once again has
preceded other industries into recession, and once again the depth
of the decline in housing is deeper than elsewhere.
   And because homebuilding has declined so much, you might say the
conditions are being produced that will lead to the next
exaggerated cycle.
   It goes like this: Because not enough houses were built during
the downturn a shortage looms. Because of the downturn and because,
after all, loans are what make profits for a bank, lenders begin
looking around for customers.
   Homebuilding leads the economic cycle, whether up or down.
Anticipating that the cycle will turn up, builders rush to get
their products on the market. Lenders are eager to help.
Eventually, another glut develops.
   Remember this: When it does, sometime in the future, know that
the rest of the economy soon will be headed down.

   When the Saratoga Performing Arts
Center opened 25 years ago, operators had a difficult time
persuading rock and pop artists to play at the amphitheater.
   No such problem now. This granddaddy of summer amphitheaters can
now pick and choose among the music business' biggest names to fill
out a schedule of more than 40 summer shows.
   In the last decade, outdoor amphitheaters have become a staple
of the concert business. Only this year, new outdoor arenas are
opening near Chicago and Pittsburgh, with Cher hosting the
inaugural shows in both places.
   The ``shed circuit'' has resurrected dormant careers and given
consumers such a huge array of choices that it has some industry
leaders worried about overkill.
   Among dozens of artists on the road this summer are David Bowie,
Eric Clapton, the B-52s, Sinead O'Connor, Tears For Fears, James
Taylor, Jimmy Buffett, Fleetwood Mac, Tracy Chapman, Bonnie Raitt,
Little Feat and those summer perennials, the Beach Boys.
   ``I think it will be a good musical summer _ a good mix of
styles,'' said David Hart, who books acts at amphitheaters in
Detroit, Chicago and Washington for the Nederlander Organization.
   Most amphitheaters are built the same way, with a section of
covered seats surrounded by an expanse of lawn for picnickers. In
Saratoga, for example, there are 5,300 seats protected from the
weather, but up to 25,000 people can sprawl on the lawns.
   Their growing popularity coincided with the aging of the '60s
generation. Woodstock nation still likes its rock 'n' roll
outdoors, but with a lawn chair and wine instead of mud and drugs.
   ``It's more a part of the show to be outside, sitting out on
blankets, enjoying yourself and enjoying the weather,'' said
Buffett, who's selling out sheds across the country this summer.
``The weather's definitely part of the show.''
   Amphitheaters have sprouted like mushrooms in recent years.
Along with its Pittsburgh shed, the Pace Entertainment Group has
opened facilities in Houston, Dallas, Atlanta, Nashville and
Memphis within the past five years.
   ``It's a natural setting for music,'' said Louis Messina,
president of Pace. ``They're built for music, unlike an arena that
is built for basketball and hockey.''
   From a business point of view, musicians like the combination of
covered and lawn seats. In Saratoga's opening years, their managers
worried that a rainy night would wash out all their business, until
they realized that at least some patrons would be kept dry, said
Herb Chesbrough, the arena's president.
   The sheds _ with many booking acts that appeal heavily to young
adult whites _ have helped keep alive the careers of '60s and '70s
acts that otherwise might not do much business.
   James Taylor, years from his latest hit, is a summertime
favorite. So are the Beach Boys, just as much annual fixtures in
Saratoga as the thoroughbred racehorses that trot through each
August.
   ``Their audiences feel more comfortable in a place like this
than they do in an arena,'' Chesbrough said. ``If you took an
artist like James Taylor and put him in an indoor arena, he'd
probably sell about half the tickets.''
   Buffett's taken a band on the road during the summer for 16 or
17 years now. It's reached the point where the ``Margaritaville''
man rarely performs during the other three seasons.
   Even Buffett, whose songs have been absent from the top of the
charts since the late '70s, admits he's surprised at how well his
concert tickets are selling this year.
   ``It shocks me,'' he said. ``I figured I might have two or three
more years and then reach a cap.''
   He's not alone in preferring to hit the road in the summer. Some
industry experts are worried that the concert business is getting
too reliant on the warm weather months.
   ``Because of the sheds, touring has become a four-month business
primarily,'' said Carl Freed, executive director of the North
American Concert Promoters Association. ``It's created a glut in
the marketplace. You have more acts than the public can pay to see
at the same time. Therefore, the ticket sales suffer for the
borderline acts.''
   Chesbrough said he doesn't mind having a lot of acts from which
to choose. However, Chesbrough, who used to try and entice
musicians into an area that was relatively unique, now said he's
worried that amphitheater operators will be fighting among
themselves for acts.
   A glut can be good news for consumers. To be competitive,
promoters must specifically package together acts for the sheds.
Ringo Starr, who went on the road last summer with an all-star band
of musical vets, is an example.
   This year, Bonnie Raitt is taking along John Lee Hooker, the
Jeff Healey Band, Dr. John and others on a blues extravaganza tour.
Fleetwood Mac is teaming with British popsters Squeeze; the B-52s
bring along up-and-coming reggae star Ziggy Marley; and Rickie Lee
Jones and Lyle Lovett join on an eclectic bill.
   It's too early to declare winners and losers for the summer.
Privately, promoters are especially bullish on the Stevie Ray
Vaughan and Joe Cocker double bill, Bowie, the B-52s, the Allman
Brothers and George Thorogood, Kenny G and Michael Bolton, and
O'Connor.
   Some promoters said they were worried that Chapman, Australian
rockers Midnight Oil and the Fleetwood Mac-Squeeze bill are some
that could get lost in the shuffle.
   Other acts, such as Madonna, Paul McCartney and New Kids on the
Block, are touring stadiums this summer. Amphitheater operators say
these big-name shows are more a help than a hindrance, since they
create interest in music.

   The world is a summer festival, with enough
music, dance, theater, art and crafts to fill beaches and resorts
from here to New Zealand.
   ``Meeting of the Worlds Festival,'' an annual international
celebration of music and the arts brought together writers, theater
directors, actors and musicians this week in Joensuu, Finland, near
the Soviet border.
   One scheduled event at the festival, which ends June 23, is a
live radio broadcast between three women of Finnish heritage _ one
in St. Paul, Minn., another in Joensuu and a third in Sortavala,
Soviet Union.
   The Spoleto Festival of the Arts ran in Charleston, S.C., from
May 10 to June 10, where it featured Gian Carlo Menotti's staging
of ``The Marriage of Figaro.'' The festival moves to Spoleto,
Italy, on June 27 and will run through July 15.
   Elsewhere, the Berkshire Theater Festival will open June 25 in
Stockbridge, Mass., with the musical ``She Loves Me,'' written by
Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick, the team responsible for ``Fiddler
on the Roof.'' And the Colorado Shakespeare Festival opens June 29
in Boulder with ``As You Like It.''
   The JVC Jazz Festival opens in New York June 22 with Miles Davis
and Dizzy Gillespie in separate concerts.
   There are dance festivals in Vermont, Canada, South Carolina and
Utah among other places. Pop concerts include performances by Eric
Clapton, Joe Cocker, Harry Belafonte, Whitesnake, Cher and Melissa
Etheridge.

<HEAD>Hudson Valley Apple Growers Face Their Troubles</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nine generations of Cosmans, six
generations of Clarkes and four generations of Crists have worked
the land of the Hudson River Valley. Sometimes, their apple
orchards have been bountiful; sometimes, they have not.
   But generally, they have kept their problems to themselves. It
is a measure of their fears for the future that they sought out
reporters from the city to tour their farms and hear about their
troubles.
   ``The last two or three years, apples have not made money,''
said Steve Clarke from Prospect Hills Orchard Inc. in Milton.
   Consumers, and farmers, worry about chemicals. Farmers can get
more money selling their land to developers than farming it.
Competition from the Northwest and abroad is squeezing their apples
off store shelves. And bad weather and pests, of course, never go
away.
   How do growers survive?
   ``We go from year to year and look at the future and hope we're
going to be here,'' Larry Cosman said at his Mount Airy Farm in the
hamlet of Middle Hope, where he grows 250 acres of apple trees.
   ``I think the odds are kind of against us in the sense that
progress will prevail sooner or later and push out some of the
farms,'' he added later.
   Not that the farmers are railing against progress. ``We brought
you up here to show we don't have our heads in the sand,'' said
grower Jeff Crist.
   Farmers are adapting by getting closer to consumers, like the
pick-your-own orchards at Clarke's farm, and with dwarf trees,
which can be planted more densely and pruned and picked more
easily. They also are starting sales organizations that market
fruit from a group of farms, and are selling directly to
restaurants, at farm markets and stands, and abroad.
   ``Ten years ago, it was enough to know what was going on in the
confines of your orchard. It's not enough anymore,'' said Mike
Moriello of New Paltz, trying to be heard over Joe Porpiglia's
water dump, which washes apples and sends them down to the waxer.
   Not all have adapted. Some have sold their land, lot by lot.
   ``It's like they're treading water,'' said Elizabeth Ryan, who
owns a 35-acre farm with her husband and is compiling oral
histories of valley farmers.
   ``In the '60s and '70s, farmers sold their land, but they sold
it to farmers. Now they sell it to big real estate,'' said
Porpiglia, 60, as he looked out at farms that have been redeveloped
for houses. ``For sale'' signs are interspersed among the apple
blossoms.
   Farmland preservation is fashionable, but Crist's wife, Joy,
said that just saving land is not the point. ``The emphasis needs
to be on supporting and strengthening the farm business,'' she said.
   That means more research and development, a good, steady labor
force, and enough farmers so there's competition among businesses
that support farms. ``I don't see a lot of good, active farms going
out of business,'' she said.
   From the early 1800s, growers in the Hudson Valley shipped many
fruits by sloop south to New York City and points beyond, including
to South American countries now sending apples to the United States.
   When Larry Cosman was a child, wholesale buyers from New York
City would travel the valley, haggling with each farmer on his
route.
   In a 1938 booklet prepared for an apple blossom festival,
growers noted they had ``the best market in the world close at
hand,'' partly because city consumers cherished the fruits of
upstate farms.
   Cosman's father sold Happy Bee Apples, with cheery,
old-fashioned stickers plastered on wooden boxes. Most went no
farther than metropolitan New York.
   In the 1930s, Ryan said, there were 500 farms in Ulster County,
on the Hudson's western bank. In 1990, there are fewer than 200
family farms all along the valley, from New York City to Albany, a
140-mile stretch.
   In 1986, Cosman, 43, abandoned Happy Bee, because he didn't have
the volume to market his own label. Now his apples, a dozen
varieties from 40,000 trees, are Hudson Valley apples, like his
neighbors'.
   ``Sometimes you talk about it and get a little choked up,'' he
said. ``It's a family name. ... It's part of you. Farming is not
really a job, it's a lifestyle. And most farmers live, eat and
breathe what they're doing.''
   But the bottom line must prevail over sentiment. ``It's an
international business,'' Cosman said, and the Hudson Valley
growers had to market their fruit together to compete with similar
labels for Michigan and Washington state apples.
   Though exports remain a small slice of the U.S. apple business _
13 million 42-pound bushels in 1988 _ the Cosmans sometimes export
75 percent of a crop.
   Foreign climes seem very far away during a walk along Latintown
Road in Ulster County. McIntosh and lesser-known types of apple
trees spread out on all sides, looking as if nothing could touch
the serenity.
   But Alar did.
   ``If you grow apples, that changed your life forever,'' Ryan
said.
   ``On an emotional level, it was a terrible upset. ... All those
guys in Washington told us it was safe, and we believed them. We
wanted to believe them,'' said the Cornell-trained pomologist, or
fruit specialist, who did not use Alar on her farm.
   Alar, also known as daminozide, is a growth regulator that
slowed maturation and improved color and storage, making it easier
to manage harvests. But even in February 1989, when the Natural
Resources Defense Council issued its report linking Alar and
cancer, few growers were using it, said Ulster County extension
fruit expert Warren Smith.
   Nevertheless, apple prices and sales fell. Growers still are
trying to recover from losses estimated at $100 million.
   Like consumers, Cosman said, farmers have a hard time figuring
out which experts to believe. But they respond to consumers and to
costs, Moriello said, and for chemicals, the cost has gone up 30
percent to 50 percent in recent years, even though he's using less.
   Smith said all the valley's apple growers use integrated pest
management, a system that combines ecological, non-chemical methods
and natural predators with chemicals, ideally fewer and fewer of
them.
   ``We have never recommended calendar spraying when other options
are available,'' he said. ``Would you take an aspirin if you didn't
have a headache?''
   For these growers, migranes are reserved for coping with apple
prices. Though supermarkets were selling apples for up to 99 cents
a pound, Mike Moriello said he was paid 19 cents a pound wholesale.
   Preliminary figures for 1989 show Washington state alone growing
119 million bushels for eating and processing, a glut that many
growers say combined with the Alar scare for a disastrous year.
Michigan was second with 23.8 million bushels, and New York third
with 22.9 million.
   Farmers who made it this far intend to survive.
   ``We have whittled away our farm population to 2 percent,'' Ryan
said. ``The people who are in agriculture now are the people who
really want to do it. They're very insightful. They balance an
extreme number of risk factors that they don't control, unlike a
lot of other businesses.
   ``There is one saying in the farm community: `These are the
greatest gamblers in the world.' ''

   Don Byers observed his 19th birthday
in a foxhole 6 feet long, 6 feet deep and about 2 feet wide, and
has the same plans for his 59th on Feb. 4, 1991.
   Lt. Col. Byers is the last active-duty soldier from the Korean
War still serving on the peninsula.
   The birthday foxhole on a hillside at Chipyong-ni, southeast of
Seoul, is half-filled with earth after nearly 40 years and a small
pine tree grows out of it.
   Byers said his view of surrounding hillsides as a machine gunner
was easily recognizable, although the terrain is green and forested
now.
   ``I dug many foxholes in Korea,'' said Byers, whose family lives
in Woodbridge, Va. ``This one was special. I didn't think I'd
survive it.''
   He has 42 years in the Army and is scheduled to retire next year
from the 2nd Infantry Division, the outfit he started with and
rejoined last year.
   ``I've made a complete circle, Korea and back to Korea, an
Indianhead patch on both shoulders,'' he said.

   Never mind the 12 tanks, helicopter, anti-aircraft guns and
uniforms. The biggest draw at the Korean War Museum in Seoul is a
Soviet-made olive drab limousine with jump seats.
   The car once belonged to Kim Il Sung, leader of North Korea then
and now. The South Korean army captured it during the Korean War,
which began June 25, 1950 with a North Korean invasion and lasted
37 months.
   It is driven out of a closed garage several times each day.
Visitors to the museum are allowed to take photographs, climb
inside, examine the upholstery and even check out the engine.
   About 1 million people visit the museum every year. Chi
Kap-chong, chairman of the U.N. Korean War Allies Association, said
if a car is what it takes to get people interested, he's all for it.
   Sgt. Blair Cooper of Summit, N.J., said of the old war machines:
``Lots of these relics look like they couldn't have made it. Now
the car, that's something else.''

   Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, a Democrat from Colorado, served
in Korea during the war and returned for the first time as part of
a congressional delegation.
   The members were briefed before entering the heavily fortified
demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
   ``If gunfire starts, hit the ground!'' a colonel barked at them.
   ``Cripes!'' Campbell said. ``That's just what I was told the
last time I was here, 38 years ago.''
   Other things have changed, he said, and ``Seoul is like the
phoenix itself, rising from the ashes. No one would believe it who
was here in the war. It's like coming back to a different country,
to a different place.''
   ``Seoul was a smoking rubble with burned-out hulks of tanks,
foxholes all around,'' Campbell said. ``There were hundreds of kids
_ little tykes with no arms, no legs, no eyes. The biggest
difference at first is, you don't see these kids.''

   The Seoul city hall has an anniversary signboard two stories
high.
   Thousands of school children have been invited to the Korean War
Museum to line up at a small thatched hut and receive handfuls of
free rice.
   The purpose is to remind young people of poverty and hunger
during the war, when relief workers on roadsides dished out rice to
hundreds of thousands of starving refugees and Korean soldiers.
   A new poll indicates many South Koreans know little about the
war. More than 15 percent of those questioned didn't known it had
occurred.

<TEXT>
   Aeroflot's resumption of service to
Indonesia in July is another sign of improving relations between
the Soviet Union and Southeast Asia, which were sour throughout the
1980s.
   Flights between Moscow and Jakarta were halted in 1982 after two
Soviet diplomats and the head of the Soviet airline's Jakarta
office were accused of spying and expelled.
   Malaysia had ousted three Soviet diplomats for the same reason
in 1981. Singapore expelled a Soviet diplomat and a shipyard
technician in 1982, accusing both of espionage.
   Soviet warships and planes occupied former U.S. bases in Vietnam
and military aid from Moscow sustained Vietnam's occupation of
Cambodia.
   The Red Army was fighting in Afghanistan and posted along the
border with China. Relations between the Kremlin and Japan were
strained because the Soviets still hold the Kurile Islands,
captured late in World War II.
   Suspicions remained even after President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
promised in a speech at Vladivostok in July 1986 that the Soviet
Union would mend its ways in the region.
   Mochtar Kusumaatmadja, then Indonesia's foreign minister,
expressed the general attitude with this comment: ``It is a good
beginning but there is a long way to go.''
   Old perceptions of the Soviet Union have been swept away by
recent events, however, and Abu Hassan Omar, the current foreign
minister, announced a new policy in May.
   He told the International Affairs Forum in Kuala Lumpur that
Gorbachev's reforms had changed Moscow's presence in the region
from ``offensive'' to one of no particular threat.
   Some in Southeast Asia have been encouraged by the Soviet
withdrawal from Afghanistan and its participation in diplomatic
efforts to resolve the Cambodian conflict. Particularly welcome was
the promise of reduced Soviet military presence in Vietnam.
   ``The Soviets are already in the process of unilaterally drawing
down their offensive capabilities in Danang and Cam Ranh Bay,'' Abu
Hassan said. ``My assessment is that the Soviet Union will now be
more inward looking and will require a peaceful and stable
international environment to pursue reform and economic development
at home.''
   Earlier this month, Gorbachev and President Roh Tae-woo of South
Korea met in San Francisco.
   Diplomats said attitudes in the region began changing
dramatically last year, when Gorbachev did not intervene to stop
Communist regimes from falling in Eastern Europe.
   The Soviet Union's political image has improved dramatically,
but its quest for greater trade and investment has been less
successful.
   Japan and the United States dominate commerce in the Pacific
basin. The Soviets also must overcome perceptions that they produce
shoddy goods and pay slowly.
   Moscow's application to join the United States, Japan, Canada,
Australia, New Zealand and the European Community as a ``dialogue
partner'' with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations was
rejected last year.
   ASEAN links Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore and Thailand to promote regional economic cooperation.
   Officials of the organization said the Soviet Union was told to
apply again later, when its economic presence in the region was
stronger. A Soviet request to take part in the new and larger
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum brought the same response.
   ``We look forward to the Soviet Union participating in the rapid
growth of this region,'' said Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew of
Singapore, a stalwart anti-communist.
   Within ASEAN, Western diplomats say, the Soviet Union seeks the
closest ties with President Suharto's administration in Indonesia,
also rigorously anti-communist.
   Indonesia has 178 million people and offers a large, relatively
unexploited market.
   Thirty Years ago, the late Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev also
saw Indonesia, not Vietnam, as the key to the region.
   Suharto made what Jakarta regards as a highly successful visit
to Moscow in September. Since then, Indonesian ports have been
reopened to Soviet shipping and restrictions have been eased on the
entry of Soviet citizens.
   In January, President Mirza Olim I. Ibragimov of the Soviet
republic of Uzbekistan became the highest Soviet official to visit
in 25 years.

   The Christian Reformed Church's
governing synod has voted to tentatively allow the ordination of
women as ministers and elders.
   The vote followed eight hours of debate between progressive and
conservative factions of the 314,000-member church.
   The action would allow individual congregations to ``use their
discretion in utilizing the gifts of women members in all areas of
the church,'' church spokesman Bob Meyering said.
   But the action remains subject to ratification by a 1992 meeting.
   ``It distresses me that we have damned the work of the Holy
Spirit and not allowed our mothers, our sisters, our daughters to
utilize the gifts God has given them,'' the Rev. William Buursma, a
Kalamazoo, Mich., pastor said in the debate.
   The Rev. James Cooper of Zeeland, Mich., argued that there are
``no assurances that this won't be thrust on the churches in
violation of their consciences.''

<HEAD>Multitude Rallies Around a ``Perfect'' Bible</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Standing about 20 feet tall on a platform in
the Louisiana Superdome was a huge replica of an open Bible.
   The book was the cynosure of last week's convention of Southern
Baptists, who perpetuated a leadership that insists on a singularly
defined view of the contents.
   Avowing that view is the new criterion for job security among
the thousands of staff members, missionaries, executives and
professors of the nation's largest Protestant denomination.
   The requirements elaborate details beyond any of the classic
Christian creeds, specifying that acceptable belief for
denominational personnel must include these spelled-out
affirmations:
   That the world's creation occurred as the Bible recounts it,
that Adam and Eve were real individuals, that all the biblically
related miracles happened literally as described, that Moses wrote
the first five books of the Bible, that all biblical narratives are
historically flawless.
   ``It's the equivalent of a creed,'' said the Rev. John Lee
Taylor, a Gainesville, Ga., pastor. And of an expanded kind.
   Baptists historically have shunned creeds, proclaiming ``no
creed but the Bible,'' and emphasizing the ``soul competence'' of
individuals to interpret Scripture as they understand it. But the
new yardstick enjoins precise judgments.
   ``It's another example of the exclusivism being established in a
denomination that historically has been open to diversity,'' Taylor
added.
   The new prescriptions were approved by a 1987 convention
dominated by a fundamentalist majority that has wielded influence
since 1979, and which this time increased its hegemony, winning the
powerful presidency for the 12th successive year.
   That bloc rose to power over the 14.9-million-member
denomination on the basis of political-style organization and
campaigning under the banner of biblical ``inerrancy'' and rightist
social positions.
   ``Inerrancy'' is a relatively new term in Christian annals,
meaning that the Bible is totally free of error about science,
history, geography, biology, religion and all other fields.
   Considering the typical Baptist devotion to the Bible, any talk
of threats to it is bound to set off alarm bells _ and that
evidently is what happened from fundamentalist charges that
denominational offices were infested with ``liberals'' downgrading
the Bible.
   The canonading, directed at seminary professors and various
other staffers, has brought out the troops.
   They swelled annual conventions to enormous size, with campaign
buses and chartered planes bringing in the voters, more than
doubling the numbers attending before the in-fighting began a
decade ago.
   The affairs now involve vast multitudes, kept under tight
restraints from the rostrum, this time a sea of 38,478
``messengers,'' the third highest yet, next to 40,987 in 1986 in
Atlanta, and 45,293 in 1985 in Dallas.
   Worked up by fiery oratory about internal ``enemies'' of a
``perfect'' Bible, the gigantic gathering gave the heaviest flood
of ballots yet to the fundamentalist platform, electing the Rev.
Morris Chapman of Wichita Falls, Texas, as president by a majority
of 58 percent.
   Chapman, 49, a trim 6-foot, smoothly articulate man is
personally gracious in manner but espouses a strict policy of
insuring conformity of beliefs ``within the paramaters'' of the new
specifications.
   ``What we believe about the Bible is a non-negotiable,'' he told
a news conference, saying he would appoint only those holding the
defined beliefs.
   The denomination's president, the most authoritative office in
U.S. Christianity, has appointive powers that control choice of
trustees governing the denomination's immense network of agencies
and institutions.
   ``I've never advocated any wholesale housecleaning,'' Chapman
said, adding that those ``out of line'' with requirements would be
eliminated mostly ``by attrition'' _ retiring or impelled to resign.
   He suggested those not holding ``inerrancy'' positions would
find a denominational ``home more in line with their convictions.''
   Most all Southern Baptists are theological conservatives, but a
moderate wing accepts both fundamentalist and other biblical
approaches, such as seeing some miracles as imagery, their
significance being in their meaning rather than in their literal
occurrence.
   The moderate candidate, the Rev. Daniel Vestal, 46, of Atlanta's
suburban Dunwoodie, lost this time with the weakest showing yet in
the decade-long battle, getting only 42 percent of the vote.
   But that still represents a lot of Baptists in a denomination of
nearly 15 million, and what they'll do remained uncertain under the
tightened demands for conformity and the fundamentalist sweep.
   Some moderates foresaw an erosion of support to national
denominational operations, and increased links to alternative
groups, such as the Baptist Alliance, set up to resist
fundamentalist ascendancy.
   In any case for the present, the multibillion-dollar
institution, built up by Southern Baptists over 145 years of
history, now was firmly in the hands of one side, and it saw no
room for the others in denominational responsibilities.
   A chief fundamentalist strategist, the Rev. Paige Patterson of
Dallas, an affable, mild-mannered man, eyed the now fortified
position of his forces and observed, ``I think I'll hang up my
holster and ride off into the sunset.''

   Mark Taynton was among the first Americans to
die in the Korean War. He was thrown into the breach against North
Korean invaders.
   Schuyler B. Cole was among the last. The war had bogged down
roughly along the same line where it started, when soldiers died
over map points named Pork Chop Hill and Heartbreak Ridge.
   Leslie Doyle Rader was killed at Inchon, when the Americans
gained the offensive.
   Fellow Marine William G. Windrich died a hero at the Chosin
Reservoir after Communist China entered the war. His tombstone
notes he won the Medal of Honor.
   If the war didn't end with the clear-cut results some wanted,
and if things aren't perfect in Korea today, well, nobody can fault
these men.
   Yet the only national tribute to their deeds are their white
marble headstones at Arlington National Cemetery. There is no patch
of ground, no monument of carved black granite for Korean veterans.
   Only now, 40 years later, is a memorial in the works.
   Authorized by Congress in 1986, it will adjoin the Lincoln
Memorial across the reflecting pool from the Vietnam Memorial if
$11 million in private contributions can be raised by 1991. About
$6.2 million has been raised so far.
   For the people who fought, bled or died in Korea, it's about
time.
   ``It's an overdue thank you,'' said retired Col. John F.C.
Kenney, a member of the Korean War Veterans Association and former
executive director of the Korean War Memorial Advisory Board.
   ``The nation owes some form of recognition to those who, without
all the fanfare of a war to save the world, marched off quietly to
fight for freedom for a people they never heard of because their
country asked them to do so,'' Kenney said.
   The memorial will have 38 statues of soldiers, each 8 feet tall,
walking from a copse of trees toward an American flag. There will
also be a retaining wall to honor the combat dead.
   ``We were the silent veterans of the forgotten war,'' says Frank
Kerr, a Boston public relations executive who fought with the
Marines at Chosin. ``Those who died enobled that time and place. It
was like a rock thrown in a pond and there wasn't a ripple.''
   That forgotten war began June 25, 1950, when North Korean tanks
clanked southward across the 38th parallel. It ended July 27, 1953,
not with a final peace, but an armistice. About 43,000 U.S.
soldiers are still in Korea, serving as a trip wire in case the
North invades again.
   Most Americans get their images of the Korean War from ``MASH''
reruns; 40 percent of the country is too young to remember it
firsthand.
   Korea was a nasty war. More artillery fell on it than was fired
in all of World War II. In 37 months, 54,248 Americans died _
33,629 of them in combat, the rest in accidents or from sickness.
In Vietnam, the U.S. dead reached 58,149 in more than 10 years of
fighting.
   There are 8,177 MIAs and 389 unaccounted-for POWs, all of them
presumed dead. Thirty-eight percent of American POWs died in
captivity.
   Korea was a harbinger. Almost all the ingredients of Vietnam
were present in Korea _ East Asia, an undeclared, limited war, a
conflict between northern communists and a southern republic, and
American war technology against a determined but ill-equipped foe.
   But mostly, Korea was a war unlike any the American public ever
had been asked to support. Americans watched with some fascination
as the U.S.-led United Nations troops were almost overrun, then
counterattacked all the way to North Korea, then were beaten back
by hordes of Chinese troops.
   One year after the shooting started, the lines stabilized at
roughly the 38th parallel. Peace talks dragged on for two years,
and 45 percent of the casaulties came after the stalemate on the
battlefield.
   At first, most Americans in those communist-conscious times
approved. But America soon was turned off by a no-win, stagnant
war. There were no patriotic ditties by Irving Berlin, but no
anti-war songs either. There were no parades, but no draft-card
burnings or Kent States.
   ``It fell off the front pages. It just sort of petered out in a
very negative way. Nobody wanted to think about this thing,'' said
historian Clay Blair, author of ``Korea: The Forgotten War.''
   ``When the war was over, people went back to their jobs and
didn't talk about it. When your country asked you to do something,
you do it,'' said Dick Adams, former member of the 25th Infantry
Division and now president of the Korean War Veterans Association
   Was Korea worth it?
   Veterans say just ask anybody if they'd rather live in the
North, one of the last vestiges of ironclad Stalinism, or in the
South, a bustling, industrial power that was host to the 1988
Olympic Games.
   ``My view is we accomplished our mission in full,'' said Gen.
Richard Stilwell, who commanded ground forces in Korea and now
heads the effort to build the Korean memorial. ``Korea was the
cornerstone for defense and foreign policy that provided the
bulwark of what is happening in Eastern Europe.''
   ``It was a complete victory. We did what we set out to do. We
stopped the communists. It was worth every inch of it,'' said
William Norris of Waterford, N.Y., founder of the Korean War
Veterans Association.
   The veterans group was formed in 1984. Norris' daughter wanted
to do a school paper but couldn't find any library books on Korea,
the place where her father fought and his buddies died.
   ``It irritated me. I started it so nobody would ever forget,''
Norris said.
   The group already has remembered to remember. It placed a
granite meditation bench near Arlington's Tomb of the Unknown
Soldier on July 27, 1987.
   It is carved with this quote from Herman Wouk: ``The beginning
of the end of war lies in remembrance.''

<HEAD>Vietnam Cracks Down on Dissidents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Worry about domestic economic
turmoil and the global crisis of communism is causing authorities
to get even tougher with dissidents and people they don't trust,
Vietnamese and Western sources report.
   The crackdown has included arrests, tightened surveillance and
suppression of the only legal dissident group, the Club of Former
Resistance Fighters. At least half a dozen foreigners have been
detained since April and two Americans accused of anti-government
activity were deported.
   Sources said conservatives appeared to have gained the upper
hand over those in the Communist Party leadership who favor
economic and other reforms.
   ``There is a tremendous sense of insecurity'' in top party
ranks, said a source with access to many officials. ``There is a
tightening up, and everybody is more cautious and afraid to say
anything. They don't acknowledge it, but you can see it in their
faces.''
   On June 16, Hanoi radio said the Interior Ministry
counterintelligence force and police, in coordination with the
armed forces, had ``promptly cracked down on many troublemaking and
sabotage activities.''
   Security forces ``caught 30 persons violating Vietnamese law and
discovered over 200 foreigners entering the country illegally,''
the radio reported.
   It said they ``destroyed five underground reactionary
organizations and captured tens of their members,'' and seized
publications ``with reactionary contents.''
   Many people ``have taken advantage'' of international
organizations investing in Vietnam to infiltrate and spy, according
to the broadcast. Thirty of more than 100 enterprises involved in
joint ventures with foreign companies were found to be operating
illegally, it said.
   Hanoi radio said the crackdown was connected with major
anniversaries, an apparent reference to the 15th anniversary April
30 of victory in the Vietnam war and the centenary May 19 of the
birth of independence leader Ho Chi Minh. Authorities feared
protests on both days, but none materialized.
   Sources say dissident activity in Vietnam is minimal and the
actions reflect ``paranoia'' over the possible loss of political
and economic support from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
Another factor, they said, was the bold challenge by pro-democracy
demonstrators last year in China.
   A Hanoi radio report May 23 claimed the CIA had subverted
Eastern Europe and was trying to do the same in Vietnam by
circulating leaflets and employing tourists, overseas Vietnamese,
minority ethnic groups and Catholics.
   Many non-Communist nations halted aid to Vietnam after its
invasion of Cambodia in December 1978.
   Washington also forbids commercial dealings, but businessmen
from other Western countries have flocked to Vietnam in the
increasingly open climate of the past two years.
   The crackdown appears focused on Ho Chi Minh City, a southern
commercial center that formerly was Saigon, capital of South
Vietnam.
   For the first time in numerous visits to Vietnam in recent
years, a reporter's papers were searched before his flight left, by
a uniformed man introduced as ``a cultural officer.''
   When asked the reason for the search, the man merely chuckled. A
government employee who was to help the journalist through customs
appeared nervous and left early.
   Two well-connected sources, who demanded anonymity, said they
believed the tightening was temporary and did not mean an end to
``doi moi,'' the Communist Party's 3{-year-old economic
``renovation'' program. They added, however, that it might last
until a national party congress expected in mid-1991.
   Most of those detained were either close to the party or members
of it, the sources said. The Hanoi radio report said some
``confused and utopian'' party members had aided the alleged CIA
sabotage campaign.
   An early sign of trouble in the party was Tran Xuan Bach's
expulsion in March from the ruling Politburo after he supported
greater democracy.
   Security forces also feared the decentralization of the economy
and some political affairs had increased public discontent, the
sources reported.
   Farmers demanding land reform marched in Ho Chi Minh City last
year. It was the first known street demonstrations under Communist
rule.
   Students have held campus protests of poor conditions at the
universities.
   Hundreds of people protested at the city hall, demanding
repayment of money they invested in a perfume company that used
liberalized rules to create a pyramid scheme.
   Smuggling, corruption and crime have become major issues.
   Authorities decided the presence of foreigners would complicate
matters and tightened visa rules in late April, a Vietnamese
official said privately.
   Western businessmen said officials who once pleaded for
investment had slowed things down and were preoccupied with
ideological matters.
   In interviews with The Associated Press, authorities said there
were no mass arrests.
   No more than 10 Vietnamese were arrested with businessman Mike
Morrow, one of the Americans deported, said Nguyen Son, vice
chairman of the information and ideological department in Ho Chi
Minh City.
   Gen. Tran Cong Man, vice president of the Vietnamese Journalists
Association, said there have been no mass arrests, ``but many
people were warned.''
   Morrow said his interrogators were convinced he was a spy and
that the United States was trying to ``create a Tiananmen in
Vietnam,'' a reference to the Beijing pro-democracy demonstrations
crushed a year ago.
   The American, who was held for three weeks before deportation,
said those arrested with him included Do Trung Hieu, a respected
intellectual who belongs to the Communist Party.
   Miriam Hershberger, an American teacher in the capital, Hanoi,
was deported June 5 for allegedly trying to incite student unrest.
   Both Americans were considered sympathetic to the government, as
was Chan Tin, one of two Catholic priests detained in May and
accused of preaching anti-communism. Like Hieu, he was a leader of
wartime opposition to the U.S.-backed government of South Vietnam.
   The Club of Former Resistance Fighters is made up of southern
war heroes and revolutionaries who criticize the party's postwar
performance but have not questioned its leading role.
   In March, the club's two leaders were expelled, apparently on
orders from the authorities, a source reported. He said the club
approved a resolution in January criticizing the government and
demanding more political reform.
   Nguyen Son, the Ho Chi Minh City party official, denied the
report. He said the club's executive board expelled the leaders
after they ``wrote and distributed documents calling for protests
against the government.''
   Son said one of the men, Ta Ba Tang, was under ``temporary
detention'' and the other, Nguyen Ho, was at home. He did not make
clear whether Ho was under restrictions.
   A British journalist who reported the club's actions after
interviewing Tang and other members was detained briefly and
several of his Vietnamese contacts were reported arrested.

<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
came to the United States and urged business leaders to invest in
his country, it was ``music to my ears,'' said Reynolds Metals
Co.'s William O. Bourke.
   ``We're already where he's telling them they ought to be,''
Bourke said. ``That ship has sailed.''
   More precisely, the ship is a sled gliding across icy Siberia,
where the Richmond-based Reynolds is a partner in a planned $200
million aluminum foil manufacturing plant that could make Reynolds
Wrap a household name in Eastern Europe.
   The political changes that are shaking up the Soviet Bloc are
creating vast business opportunities for American companies, said
Bourke, Reynolds' 63-year-old chairman and chief executive officer.
   But when Bourke first came to Reynolds in 1981, the company
would have been hard-pressed to jump at such a chance.
   ``We went through the most painful experience a company can go
through, and that's one of shrinking, hunkering down, laying off a
lot of people,'' Bourke said. ``I'm sure it was in the minds of a
lot of our young people as to whether or not there was any future
in our industry or in our company.''
   A decade ago Bourke asked himself similar questions. Passed over
for the presidency of Ford Motor Co., he retired in 1980 to his
Albemarle County farm.
   He tried to adjust. As executive vice president of Ford's North
American operations, he had supervised 280,000 employees; as a
farmer, he directed a 120-acre cattle and orchard operation with no
one but a farm manager to take orders.
   But after about 18 months, Reynolds Chairman David P. Reynolds
``called me out of the blue one day and invited me to lunch.''
Bourke thought Reynolds was going to offer him a seat on the
company's board of directors.
   ``I had no idea he was going to offer me a job,'' he said.
   Reynolds, who was 67 at the time, wanted Bourke to become
executive vice president for operations. ``That'll get your feet
wet in a hell of a hurry,'' he told Bourke.
   Bourke drove back to his farm, about an hour west of Richmond in
the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, to talk to his wife,
Elizabeth. She advised him to take the job because ``you're getting
to be a real pain around here,'' the chain-smoking Bourke recalled
her saying.
   Bourke came aboard in October 1981 at a time when the company
had a staggering debt load and periodically was shaken by surges in
aluminum prices and demand. In 1982, Reynolds reported a $24
million loss.
   Bourke set out to cut costs and pay off the debt, a streamlining
that meant hundreds of job losses.
   ``That's a very painful, difficult process, and it went on here
about 3{ years,'' he said.
   He remembered going to a dinner party one night and being told
``you're probably the most hated man in Richmond right now.''
   ``Well, that's difficult to hear,'' Bourke said. ``I said, `I'm
trying to save a company. The people who are still with the company
I'm sure will see the day when they're thankful that we've done
what we've done.'''
   After the debt and operating costs were brought under control,
Bourke _ elevated to chief executive officer in 1986 and chairman
in 1988 _ looked to improve efficiency by upgrading operations with
the latest technology. He also looked at acquisitions to complement
Reynolds' main consumer product, the food-packaging Reynolds Wrap
aluminum foil.
   He settled, among other buys, on Presto Products, a maker of
in-house grocery store brands of plastic food wraps.
   Last year, Reynolds set a record $6 billion in revenue and $533
million in earnings. Revenue has increased more than 50 percent
over the past two years.
   Construction of the Siberian manufacturing plant, which will
have a capacity of 47,000 tons of foil a year, is expected to begin
next spring.
   Although Reynolds will hold only a 13.5 percent stake in the
plant, it will supply the engineering and technical expertise to
the six Soviet organizations that will own 70 percent.
   The joint venture should help give Reynolds a competitive edge
in Eastern Europe, which has been steadily opening its doors to
Western goods amid striking political changes.
   Reynolds is also trying to boost industrial sales of aluminum,
primarily in automobiles.
   Once an auto industry insider, Bourke is critical of U.S.
carmakers for being slow to develop engines that use light-weight
aluminum parts. But he said the loss of cheap and plentiful
gasoline, along with competition from abroad, have been generating
``big scale'' orders from Detroit.
   Louis Hannen, a securities analyst who follows Reynolds for
Wheat First Securities Inc. in Richmond, said Bourke has done a
masterful job in turning around the company. While boosting
Reynolds' consumer line, Bourke lowered ingot production costs,
Hannen said, and ``Now they can compete.''
   Bourke said his objective is to make Reynolds ``as good as or
better than anybody else in everything we do.''
   Finishing that objective will take about 10 more years, and it
will fall to his successors to complete the task. Bourke plans to
retire in April 1992.
   ``I've often said to our people that my legacy will be written
after I leave, not while I'm here,'' Bourke said. ``Just look at
Reynolds Metals and how it performs through the balance of the
'90s. Then you can tell me whether I did a good job or not.''

   Housing starts fell in May for the fourth
consecutive month, dipping to their lowest level since the last
recession, the government said.
   Analysts, who said Tuesday's report was further evidence that
the housing market continues to weaken, attributed the 1.4 percent
fall to high mortgage rates, tight credit, a large inventory of new
and existing homes, wet weather and a sluggish economy that has
sapped consumer confidence.
   The Commerce Department said starts of new homes and apartments
totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.21 million units,
the smallest number since 1.17 million units in October 1982.

<HEAD>Analysts Say Oil Price Slide Temporary Before Prices Head Up</HEAD>

   A slump in U.S. oil prices to two-year lows has surprised
analysts by its severity, but they contend the weakness is only a
short-term blip and won't lead to much lower gasoline prices.
   Tuesday's close at $15.65 for a 42-gallon barrel of West Texas
Intermediate crude oil ``is much lower than I thought it would
go,'' said Maureen Allyn, chief economist at Scudder, Stevens &amp;
Clark Inc. in New York.
   But Ms. Allyn and other analysts don't see a repeat of the oil
market crash of the mid 1980s, which saw prices drop below $10 a
barrel. Most analysts are sticking with forecasts that predict the
price of WTI, the benchmark U.S. grade, will average around $18 a
barrel this year.
   WTI for July delivery lost 29 cents in Tuesday's trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange and has fallen $1.93 in the last week.
The price hit a four-year high at $23.68 on Jan. 3, but has lost
ground pretty steadily because of heavy production by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   The posted price, what refiners will pay for oil on the spot
market, has fallen from as high as $21 a barrel in early January to
as low as $15.
   ``We would have thought that it would not have fallen as far as
it did,'' said David Lee Smith, energy analyst at Eppler, Guerin
and Turner Inc. in Dallas. Because of the slippage, Smith has
dropped his estimate for the 1990 average price from about $19 a
barrel to $18.
   Kent Hance, chairman of the energy industry-regulating Texas
Railroad Commission, predicted the price will slip to $15 a barrel
by next month's scheduled OPEC meeting.
   ``That's not all bad news for us,'' said Hance. ``OPEC does not
do a good job in their meetings unless their backs are up against
the wall.
   ``I still stay by my prediction of $24- to $25-a-barrel oil
within the next 24 months,'' he said.
   The cartel has said it wants world oil prices around $18 a
barrel, but members have flouted their own production limits
designed to keep prices firm.
   Last week, OPEC president Sadek Boussena warned that oil prices
would collapse unless cartel members adhered to a May agreement
limiting production to between 22.1 million and 22.6 million
barrels of oil a day.
   Estimates of OPEC production generally range above 23 million
barrels daily, with several group members believed to be exceeding
their quotas.
   Production also has been strong among some non-OPEC countries
such as Norway, which announced over the weekend it would increase
its output.
   ``That will add production to the worldwide supply, but we're
seeing lower production from the United States, lower production
from the Soviet Union, so I think that the slide in oil prices is a
short-term event,'' said John Hilton, analyst for Argus Research in
New York.
   Hilton said he is holding by his prediction of $18.50 for this
year's average, but continued deterioration could change that
outlook.
   Ms. Allyn said there is little to indicate a long-term price
decline. Failure to invest in finding new reserves during the last
decade, when oil prices were weak, means declining supply and
rising prices, she said.
   ``In terms of the real things that will drive oil prices over
the next three to five years, as a consumer I would feel no sense
of security,'' she said.
   ``You can't bring new stuff on properly at these prices, there's
no incentive.''
   While the price has fallen much lower than she expected, Ms.
Allyn said she did not anticipate the slump would last long enough
to change her forecast of a 1990 average price of about $18,
reaching about $20 next year.
   Hance said non-Arab oil producers such as Mexico and Venezuela
have been using oil earnings to prop up otherwise struggling
economies and have done little to replace oil.
   ``The result is going to be that we're gong to see dramatic
declines'' in supply by 1993, he said.
   Hilton said the most recent drop could translate into retail
savings of about 4 cents per gallon of gasoline, but Ms. Allyn
doubted the price cut would find its way to the pump.
   Trilby Lundberg, publisher of The Lundberg Survey in California,
said demand for gasoline in the prime summer driving season also
should keep prices from falling much further.

   Oil gushers continue to erupt in South Texas's Pearsall Field,
where horizontal drilling has turned a played-out area into a
oilman's playground.
   The newest discovery was announced Tuesday by Winn Exploration
Co. Inc., which said its latest well tested at a potential of
19,568 barrels of oil a day. The average Texas well produces just
10 barrels a day.
   The well is the second in three weeks to come in at startling
numbers, higher than any well recorded in the last 50 years of
record-keeping at the Texas Railroad Commission. Meridian Oil Inc.
said on May 29 it had a well with a potential of 12,254 barrels a
day.
   Although far short of the 100,000-barrel Spindletop gusher that
started the Texas oil industry in 1901 and the 200,000-barrel Yates
Field finds in West Texas in 1926, the latest wells are far above
recent average finds.
   Recent wells are considered good producers at 100 to 200 barrels
a day, said Kent Hance, chairman of the Railroad Commission, which
regulates the state's petroleum industry.
   The wells are in the Austin Chalk formation of South Texas
Pearsall Field, whose fickle nature earned it the name ``Heartbreak
Field.''
   All that changed last year when Oryx Energy Co. showed that
horizontal drilling could produce high rates of success.
   Although Oryx has drilled the most wells, Winn has had the best
results.
   In November, Winn drilled a well with a 5,472-barrel potential.
In December, the company added one at 3,600 barrels. Last week,
another started producing with a daily potential of 5,388 barrels.
   ``That's not too shabby,'' said Michael Calley, Winn
Exploration's vice president and general manager.
   All the wells have been on the same 8,891-acre lease in Zavala
County, about 60 miles southwest of San Antonio.
   Wildcat oilman Charlie Winn said his latest find has produced
35,078 barrels of oil.
   The state eventually will limit the well's output to about 1,400
barrels a day, Hance said. Other Winn wells are easily meeting
their ``allowables'' of about 1,300 barrels a day, he said.
   ``With the allowable being less, that well should produce a long
time,'' Hance said.
   Texas has about 200,000 wells producing between 100 barrels and
200 barrels a day.
   The Austin Chalk contains oil in vertical fractures, narrowing
the chance a traditional vertical well would strike crude. With
horizontal drilling, wells take a 90-degree turn a mile or more
underground, allowing the wells to tap into more than one fracture
and increasing the chance of success.
   While the horizontal wells have produced startling initial flow
rates, experts are unsure how long such rates can be sustained.
   ``My personal opinion is that it's still too early to tell,''
said Winn Exploration's Calley.
   There are about 100 horizontal wells producing in the Austin
Chalk, said Railroad Commission spokesman Gary Garrison.
   ``We've just scratched the surface in that field,'' Hance said.
``It's going to be very interesting.''

<HEAD>Rumors Fly About Fiat and Chrysler; Stock Rises Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Persistent speculation that Italian automaker
Fiat SpA may link up with Chrysler Corp. has helped pump up the
U.S. company's stock price.
   Talk about possible takeover bids for or stake purchases in
Chrysler has been gaining steam as the country's No. 3 automaker
battles with shrinking market share, slumping earnings and
defections of top-ranked executives.
   Chrysler stock rose $1.12{ on Tuesday on the New York Stock
Exchange to close at $16.62{ a share. The stock rose 37{ cents on
Monday despite an overall decline in the market.
   Chrysler confirmed it was in discussions with Fiat but declined
to give details.
   ``People are buying on speculation,'' spokesman Tom Houston said.
   The Italian automaker declined to comment on the rumors,
although an official at the company's Turin headquarters called the
reports ``purely journalistic hypotheses.''
   A hookup with Fiat could provide Chrysler broader access to
European markets already penetrated by Ford Motor Co. and General
Motors Corp.
   The planned dropping of trade barriers within the 12-nation
European Community in 1992 will create the world's largest single
car market. Earnings from their European operations have helped
Ford and GM weather the slump in the U.S. auto market.
   Chrysler sold its European operations to France's Peugeot a
decade ago when it was on the brink of bankruptcy, but has begun to
export to Europe modestly in recent years.
   A Chrysler-Fiat association also could provide a doorway for
Fiat back into the U.S. market, which it left in 1983. But Fiat
first would have to convince skeptical American consumers that its
cars are of much higher quality than when the company left the U.S.
market, analysts said.
   Fiat is Italy's largest automaker with a 60 percent market
share. It was the ninth-largest automaker in the world in 1988,
according to the latest figures available from the Motor Vehicle
Manufacturers Association in Detroit. Chrysler ranked seventh.
   The companies already are involved in some component deals, and
Chrysler markets Fiat's Alfa Romeo cars in North America.
   Some analysts questioned what Fiat would gain from a full merger
with Chrysler _ a company facing severe financial pressure and no
all-new car models until 1992.
   ``I could see an equity investment, but under a traditional
definition of a merger, I just can't see it,'' analyst John Kirnan
of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. in New York.
   Some reports in Europe have speculated Fiat may be willing to
purchase up to 40 percent of Chrysler. The U.S. company has about
$4 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand, but
confidence in its financial situation has been shaken lately.
   Chrysler reported an 80 percent drop in first quarter profits to
$71 million. Last week, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. downgraded Chrysler
debt securities to its lowest investment-grade level.
   Analysts said it would be easier for Fiat and Chrysler to form
joint ventures on a project-by-project basis than for them to make
an equity agreement.
   ``Cross-shareholding would certainly cement an alliance,'' said
analyst Mary Anne Sudol of Fitch Investors Service Inc. in New
York. ``But you certainly don't need cooperation like that to make
any individual project go.''
   Last week, Chrysler and the French automaker Renault canceled a
joint project to build a small sport-utility vehicle in Europe.
Chrysler said the project was no longer economically attractive but
said it would consider seeking another European partner.
   Chrysler also needs a subcompact to sell in the United States.
It stopped making its Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon in February.
Company officials have said they are studying whether to design a
new subcompact on their own or to associate with another automaker
to build such a vehicle.
   Fiat's relies heavily on small cars, and there has been
speculation about a possible tie-up with Chrysler to build a
version of its Tipo hatchback.
   There also has been speculation about a link with Mitsubishi
Motor Corp. of Japan, of which Chrysler owns 12.1 percent.
   Chrysler operations also have been dented by the recent
departures of its vice chairman, Gerald Greenwald, and
international operations vice president, Michael Hammes. Two other
top executives have announced plans to step down.

<HEAD>Checchi Says Northwest In Search of Acquisition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines is considering expanding
by buying part or all of another carrier, Chairman Alfred Checchi
said.
   Checchi has mentioned previously that Northwest would consider
expanding by making acquisitions, but his remarks Tuesday were more
direct.
   ``It's fair to say we have our eyes open and maybe our mouths a
little bit open as we see what opportunities are there,'' Checchi
said when asked whether any talks were under way.
   He declined to specify possible targets.
   Checchi made the remarks at a news conference to introduce
Frederick B. Rentschler as Northwest's new president and chief
executive officer.
   Rentschler was president and chief executive officer of
Chicago-based Beatrice Co., where for the past three years he has
been busy dismembering that company after it was purchased for $6.1
billion in 1986 by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
   ConAgra Inc. announced June 7 that it would buy Beatrice's
remainingg businesses for $1.34 billion.
   Checchi said Northwest intends to grow as the industry continues
to consolidate. He said the number of domestic carriers has fallen
to 85 from 255 at the start of airline deregulation in the late
1970s.
   ``We are seeing, I think, some tremendous possibilities to
expand the company outside of internal growth,'' Checchi said.
``This is an industry that is in the midst of substantial change
and we like to think we have assembled an aggressive team that will
be able to take advantage of some of the opportunities being
presented in the marketplace to us.''
   Pan Am recently said it would put its Northeast shuttle service
up for sale, and Donald Trump has indicated he would consider bids
for the shuttle service he bought from Eastern Airlines last year.
   Checchi said cash flows at Northwest have exceeded expectations
since he and other investors completed their $3.65 billion takeover
of the airline last August. He also said the carrier is
``substantially ahead'' on its repayment of takeover debt.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Motorola Chip Off Market</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AUSTIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motorola has earned a temporary reprieve allowing
it to continue selling its popular computer chip, but analysts say
continuing legal battles over patent rights could shake customers'
confidence.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on Tuesday
granted the company a temporary stay of a federal judge's ruling
that would have forced it to pull the chip from the market,
Motorola spokesman Tim Kellogg said. The court is a special appeals
court for patents in Washington.
   Earlier Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton had banned
the production and sale of Motorola's MC68030 microprocessor, and
Hitachi Ltd.'s H8-532 microprocessor.
   The two companies, once partners, have been embroiled in a
longstanding patent infringement battle over the microprocessor,
the device that performs computations in a computer.
   Some analysts said Bunton's decision would pose greater problems
for Motorola. Its chip has sold better than Hitachi's in this
country, garnering 17 percent of the market for 32-bit
microprocessor's, according to one analyst's estimate.
   ``It's certainly going to shake the confidence of companies that
have been designing with Motorola's microprocessor all along,''
said Alice Leeper, associate director for Dataquest, a market
research company based in San Jose, Calif.
   ``People who were considering doing a design based around the
030 would certainly be thinking twice, and possibly looking at an
alternative product,'' said Ms. Leeper.
   Apple Computer Inc. is one of the companies that relies heavily
on the 68030, using it in a number of its Macintosh computers.
   Apple spokeswoman Yolanda Davis said before the appeals court
stay was issued that she did not expect Bunton's decision to have a
``material impact'' on the company's inventory.
   ``We are confident the two parties are working to resolve this
issue,'' said Ms. Davis.
   Analyst Jack Quinn said the judge's order would pressure Hitachi
and Motorola to settle the case. Indeed, Motorola said it would
continue negotiating with Hitachi to reach a settlement.
   ``The main motivation that Motorola has for settling is not the
immediate economic impact, but the confidence that customers in
general have in their semiconductor suppliers,'' said Quinn, a
senior analyst with In-Stat, a market research company in
Scottsdale, Ariz.
   The injunction could cause companies to reconsider designing
products around chips that can be supplied by only one company, he
said.
   ``I've got to believe this matter is going to be settled. I
can't believe that Motorola and Hitachi would stand by and see
Apple devastated,'' Quinn said.
   Jerry Solovy, an attorney for Hitachi, said the stay would allow
both companies to present arguments on Bunton's injunction to the
appeals court.
   Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., said the stay would allow
it to continue to supply customers until a verdict is reached on
its appeal of Bunton's ruling.

<HEAD>Keating Sees Judge Returning Bankrupt Thrift</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Charles H. Keating Jr. says he believes a
federal judge will return his bankrupt Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association to him, but he promises to fight any adverse decision
as long as he is alive.
   ``I think we'll get it back,'' Keating told reporters Tuesday
after lawyers for both sides summarized their arguments for U.S.
District Judge Stanley Sporkin.
   Keating is suing to overturn the government's April 1989 seizure
of the Irvine, Calif., thrift.
   ``I don't know if it will work out for me. ... (But) we have at
least gotten a trial and America has gotten a trial,'' he said.
   However, if Sporkin grants the government's motion to dismiss
the suit, Keating said, ``We'll be fighting until the day I'm dead.
I have no intention of being raped by the U.S. government.''
   Sporkin has conducted 30 days of hearings over six months. He
has about 1,000 documents and hundreds of pages of court
transcripts to review and gave no indication when he would rule.
   The judge could uphold the seizure, find it invalid or order a
full trial on the matter. He also could fashion some other
solution, including putting the thrift under court administration.
   ``I guess it's up to me. I'm going to ponder it a little bit,''
Sporkin, a former enforcement director for the Securities and
Exchange Commission, told a packed courtroom.
   Keating's attorney, Ronald Fein, suggested that a ruling in the
government's favor risks unraveling the entire S&amp;L bailout program.
He said potential buyers of rescued thrifts won't trust the
government if what he called the arbitrary and capricious takeover
of Lincoln is allowed to stand.
   ``If the private sector can't rely on the government to apply
the law in good faith ... rational businessmen are just not going
to invest their money in these kinds of institutions,'' Fein said.
   The government maintains that Keating arranged for Lincoln to
book false profits through land and stock deals. The profits, in
turn, were improperly funneled to Keating's Arizona holding
company, American Continental Corp., via a tax-sharing agreement,
said attorney James Murphy, representing the Treasury Department's
Office of Thrift Supervision.
   The agreement provided that American Continental would pay
Lincoln's taxes, but $95 million was transferred to the holding
company before the taxes were due and the company went bankrupt
before it paid the taxes, Murphy said. The transactions amounted to
a series of unrepaid, interest-free loans, he said.
   American Continental in 1988 promised the bank board it would
inject $10 million in capital into its S&amp;L, but used the
tax-sharing agreement and a series of complex transactions so that
``Lincoln's money got put into Lincoln,'' Murphy said.
   That, he said, amounted to a ``pure case of fraud.''
   Murphy noted that Lincoln's failure, perhaps the nation's
costliest thrift collapse, will cost taxpayers ``in excess of $1.5
billion.'' The government already has pumped in $1.2 billion just
to keep it afloat, he said.
   Separately, Keating is the target of a federal grand jury probe
in Los Angeles and a defendant in a $1.3 billion civil fraud suit
filed in Arizona by federal regulators.
   His case has attracted great attention because of Keating's
involvement with five senators who met with regulators on his
behalf after accepting political contributions.
   The five are Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz.; Donald W. Riegle, D-Mich.; John Glenn, D-Ohio; and John
McCain, R-Ariz.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional tax advisers are proposing a
simplified deduction for interest that would mean a smaller
write-off on many home mortgages.
   On the other hand, the recommendation by the staff of the Joint
Committee on Taxation could result in restoration of at least part
of the consumer-interest deduction, which will expire at year's end.
   A simplified interest deduction was the most significant
provision in a package of proposals by the joint committee for
removing some of the complexity from federal tax law.
   The House Ways and Means Committee, which has launched a new
simplification effort, released the proposals Tuesday, along with
some from the Treasury Department and others from the Ways and
Means staff.
   ``At the least, we will have hearings on the proposals in the
fall,'' said a Ways and Means aide, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. Those hearings will help determine whether the committee
will try to write a simplification bill.
   Members of Congress don't like to tamper with the deduction for
home mortgage interest, which generally is considered as close to a
sacred cow as can be found in the tax law. About 25 million
taxpayers claim the deduction, which will cost the treasury about
$30 billion in forgone taxes this year.
   The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation concluded that
present law, with its different rules for mortgages, investment
interest and consumer interest, is too complicated.
   The staff suggested three ways to simplify the law, two of which
would water down the mortgage deduction.
   The law allows a full deduction of interest on a loan of up to
$1 million used to acquire a principal or second home and on
home-equity loans of up to $100,000. Investment interest is
generally deductible up to the limit of income earned on
investments. After this year, no consumer interest, including
automobile loans and credit cards, can be deducted.
   The tax committee staff proposed these alternatives for writing
off interest:
   _Combine all non-business interest, including that for
mortgages, consumer debt and investment borrowing, and deduct a set
percentage of the total, perhaps 75 percent.
   _Deduct interest equal to net income on investments, plus some
additional dollar amount.
   _Retain the current law for mortgage interest and allow a
separate write-off for other interest, limited to net investment
income. The portion of other interest that could not be deducted in
the first year because of the limitation could be carried over into
future years.
   The joint committee staff said any of the recommendations would
minimize complexity of present law. In addition, the first option
would remove the ``incentive for individuals to structure loans as
home-equity debt in order to avoid the present-law limit on the
deductibility of personal interest,'' its report said.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index ended higher
today, while the dollar inched up against the Japanese yen in thin
trading.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average regained 47.38 points, or
0.15 percent, ending at 32,087.86. The index, which had lost 336.42
points on Tuesday, ended the early session with a 140.27-point gain
before easing back some in the afternoon.
   First section volume was estimated at 400 million shares, up
from Tuesday's 330 million.
   ``Trading was almost equally mixed with selling and buying,''
said Kazuyuki Suzuki, a trader with Daiwa Securities Co.
   Other traders attributed the Nikkei's afternoon slowdown to
market players' uncertainties over the foreign exchange and bond
market movements.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 153.98 yen, up 0.26
yen from Tuesday's 153.72-yen finish. It opened at 153.85 yen and
ranged narrowly between 153.85 yen and 154.05 yen.
   The dollar-yen trading was inactive because participants just
made technical adjustments, said Eiichi Seino, a dealer with Fuji
Bank.
   About $69.96 billion changed hands in spot trading.
   Many participants tried to push up the dollar beyond the 154-yen
line but the currency surpassed the line only briefly because of
selling pressure above the 154-yen mark, he said.
   But he added that the dollar is ``basically in an uptrend.''
   In bond dealings, the price of the No. 119 10-year Japanese
government bonds declined to 87.42 points at 4 p.m. from Tuesday's
87.46-point close. The yield was higher at 7.095 percent from 7.085
percent.

<HEAD>OPEC President Expected in Saudi Arabia for Talks on Oil Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC President Sadek Boussena is
expected in Saudi Arabia Sunday for consultations on overproduction
by cartel member states amid fears of an oil price crash, official
sources said Wednesday.
   The sources, who spoke on condition they not be identified, said
that Boussena will be arriving in the Saudi summer capital of
Jiddah from Iran as part of a tour of OPEC member states to seek
action to help stabilize erratic oil prices.
   Ministers of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries agreed in May to slash OPEC output by 1.4 million barrels
per day to restore the cartel's overall production to 22 million
barrels in support of the $18-a-barrel reference price.
   Saudi Arabia, the dominant party in the cartel and also one of
the member states that had been overproducing, has cut back its
excess output, but other violators have not done so and oil prices
have been sagging. They are presently fluctuating in the range of
$15 a barrel.
   Boussena recently warned of an oil price crash if all OPEC
members did not adhere to their individual production quotas. The
Saudi monarch, King Fahd, has also urged other OPEC members to
adhere to their quotas in the interest of all.
   A stream of editorials in the pro-government Saudi media have
since been lashing out at the production cheaters, with the latest
in the leading Al-Riyadh warning that the resulting ``flooding of
the market is creating chaos ... and an imbalance that will lead to
a price crash.''
   None of the overproducers have been named by either the king or
the papers. United Arab Emirates oil minister Mana Saeed Otaiba on
a recent visit to the kingdom has been pledging commitment, but the
U.A.E. on principle insists on producing at a self-imposed quota
almost double the 1.095 million barrel per day which OPEC has
prescribed for it.
   Fahd has also said in a recent press interview that he saw the
time ripe for a ``long-term agreement that would ensure a high
degree of stability'' for OPEC and the world economy.
   The Saudi king's statements have been followed by renewed talk
in some OPEC capitals, particularly Kuwait, of the 2-year-old
proposal by Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez for an OPEC
summit to discuss a fresh long-term policy for the cartel amid a
developing upsurge in world demand for OPEC oil.
   The sources said the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain _ members of the
six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council alliance _ will be meeting in
Jiddah next week to discuss various developments related to the oil
situation.
   The meeting would be held once Boussena had completed his trip
through the Gulf region, the sources said.

<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with Saturn saying door problem fixed,
schedule being met. No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A swelling-door problem on General Motors Corp.'s
new Saturn model has been fixed and the first marketable car should
roll off a Tennessee assembly line later this summer, a Saturn
spokeswoman said today.
   The Detroit Free Press reported today that the problem would
delay the scheduled start of production at the plant in Spring
Hill, Tenn. But spokeswoman Laurie Kay denied that this morning.
   ``We had a pre-production problem with the door material that
already has been corrected,'' she said.
   GM Chairman Roger Smith said as recently as May 25 that he still
was counting on driving the first production model of the Saturn
car off the assembly line before he retires July 31.
   ``Our plans still anticipate that would occur prior to his
retirement,'' Kay said today, adding, however: ``He has told us
that he will not drive the car until the Saturn team has told him
that the vehicle's high-quality standards have been met.''
   The newspaper quoted unidentified sources as saying that it's
possible that the car won't be ready before July 31
   Smith's 9{-year tenure as GM chairman has been marked by
controversy and declining market share. A success with Saturn would
reinvigorate his claim for long-term automotive greatness.
   Saturn is a $3-billion GM project aimed at marketing a car to
sell for less than $12,000 targeted specifically for import-car
owners or likely import buyers.
   Much of the technology going into building the car is new to the
auto industry, including the injection molding process for making
large body parts, including the doors.
   Kay acknowledged that testing showed doors expanded under high
temperatures, but she declined to give any details. The Free Press
said the swelling was so bad that doors wouldn't close.
   She said the problem stemmed from the material used in making
the doors rather than the injection molding process, which has been
used in the past for parts no larger than bumpers.
   ``Saturn is not experiencing any more pre-production problems
than normally encountered with the startup of an all-new vehicle,''
Kay said.
   Saturn is due to arrive in dealer showrooms on schedule this
fall, she said. The Free Press quoted a source as saying: ``It's
going to be a photo finish, there's no doubt in my mind.''

<HEAD>Judge Rules Against Purported Heirs in Oilfield Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEAUMONT, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ruled that thousands
of decendants of an early Texas resident have no claim to a share
of the Spindletop oilfield fortune or the estimated $200 billion
worth of oil pumped from it since the Lucas gusher spurted in 1901.
   U.S. District Judge Howell Cobb's ruling came in the latest of a
long series of lawsuits brought by would-be heirs against oil
companies.
   It was a summary judgment in favor of Amoco Production Inc.,
Mobil Oil Corp., Phillips Petroleum Co., Texaco Inc. and Chevron
Inc. in a suit filed by four relatives who claimed kinship to
Pelham Humphries and asked for $200 billion in oil, gas and mineral
rights from the companies.
   The suit was filed in February in Tennessee by the four
relatives who sought to have their case declared a class action
suit on behalf of numerous other heirs. The case was transferred to
Beaumont.
   ``This court desperately desires that the ghost of Pelham
Humphries will no longer haunt the halls of the United States court
system,'' Cobb wrote in his opinion. ``The Pelham Humphries
litigation is over ... requiescat in pace (rest in peace).''
   Brown Peregoy, a Tennessee resident representing 3,000 members
of the Humphries Heirs Trust Association, contended Pelham
Humphries received a grant to the Spindletop property from the
Mexican government in 1835, and left no will.
   The judge said in his ruling, however, that Humphries conveyed
the grant to William Inglish, whose heirs conveyed it to William
McFaddin in 1883.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held in favor of the oil
companies in a trilogy of Humphries' claims litigated in the 1950s
and 1960s. The appellate court last ruled on a Humphries suit in
1968, and found the ``Humphries heirs have no title in the league
of land,'' Cobb said.
   The judge will hold hearings later to determine if he will order
the plaintiffs to pay legal fees for the defendants because of
claim by the defendants that the suit was brought on which issues
which have been tried before.
   Lawyer Max Wilson said he believes his clients have a legitimate
claim.
   ``We knew we had an uphill battle,'' Wilson said. ``We took a
long look at it and really felt like we had an inside chance of
doing something with this thing.''
   Peregoy, 52, a retired pipe superintendent who devoted nine
years to researching the suit, said thousands of would-be heirs
want their day in court.
   ``We feel like it's unconstitutional that these people have not
had their say,'' he said.

   The Toyotas on American roads and the Sonys
in American rec rooms may soon be joined by Fujis in American
lunchboxes _ a Japanese-bred apple that seems to be the fruit of
the future.
   Growers say Japanese bud wood grafted onto trees in the central
Washington apple belt produces an apple that is crisper, tastier
and more durable than Red Delicious, the industry standard since
the 1920s.
   The Fujis also are bringing much higher wholesale prices _ not a
minor consideration after three consecutive years of poor prices
that have caused many growers to reassess the heart-shaped Red
Delicious.
   ``There will be more change in the apple industry in the state
of Washington in the next 10 years than in the last 30,'' said
Brooke Peterson, a Washington State University tree fruit extension
agent in Yakima County.
   He likened Washington apple growers, who produce 60 percent of
the nation's crop, to U.S. automakers who were ``so big and so
successful for so long'' that they failed to respond to the
Japanese challenge.
   ``All of a sudden they are nipping us in the heels,'' he said.
   As a result, growers must produce a better and more diversified
product, he said. Currently, 70 percent of Washington's apple crop
is Red Delicious.
   ``We're in a revolution in supplying the public with an apple
more satisfactory to their needs,'' said Grady Auvil, a legendary
grower from Orondo who pioneered Washington production of the tangy
Granny Smith a decade ago.
   Auvil, 84 and still out in his Columbia River orchard every day,
is planting only Fujis on his 500 acres now.
   ``Twenty to 30 percent of the time the Red Delicious arrives to
consumers in poor condition,'' Auvil said.
   The Fuji, first bred in Japan 35 years ago, has a longer shelf
life, and shrivels on the outside before it softens inside, Auvil
said. Too often, consumers complain of biting into a good-looking
Red Delicious that is mealy.
   Tastes in apples change just as tastes in clothing, music or
other products change, some growers say. Where consumers once
clamored for bright red colors and the heart shape, now they are
demanding better taste.
   The oblong-shaped Fuji has dull red stripes over a
greenish-yellow base.
   Red Delicious apples cover more than 120,000 of the state's
160,000 acres of apple orchards. Trees take several years to bear
fruit, so it will be some time before a flood of Fujis hits
supermarkets, said Chuck St. John, a spokesman for the Washington
Apple Commission.
   He also said it is much too early to write off the Red
Delicious. ``It is not an inherently bad apple. Otherwise consumers
wouldn't buy it,'' he said. ``We can grow Red Delicious and Golden
Delicious better than they can be grown almost anyplace else in the
world.''
   The Red Delicious first was produced in a Midwest orchard in
1870 and was transported to Washington soon after. By 1915, the
state was the nation's leading apple producer.
   But growers are struggling. Two seasons ago, the crop was
severely damaged by excessive heat, and last year's sales and
prices were hurt by the Alar scare. This year, the record crop of
78 million 42-pound boxes of eating apples has been bringing prices
beneath the cost of production.
   Where boxes of Red Delicious sell for about $10 per box
wholesale, Fujis sell for up to $40, said Jeff Main of the Market
News Service in Yakima.
   Market News Service does not officially record Fuji prices,
because there are so few available, he said. But it is likely that
will change in the next three or four years, he said.
   The Fuji craze is reminiscent of the rush to plant Granny Smiths
a decade ago. That tart apple now accounts for 5.5 percent of the
state's crop.
   When Granny Smiths debuted, they, too, brought much higher
prices. Now they are bringing about $15 per box, still better than
Red Delicious.
   Auvil predicts Red Delicious will go the way of the Winesap in
the next 30 years, and will be replaced by the Fuji.
   ``It is the one sweet apple you can always deliver with good
quality if it starts the trip in good quality,'' he said.

   Stock prices dipped slightly this morning as the

   Big Board volume totaled 134.93 million shares Tuesday, against

<HEAD>TCI Offers to Become National Cable Affiliate for NBC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tele-Communications Inc. has proposed a union with
NBC-TV that would make the cable giant a national network affiliate
and allow it to deliver NBC programming to communities that lack
hometown channels.
   ``This would serve the local issue more profoundly than any
other business arrangement we can think of,'' TCI Vice President
Robert Thomson said Tuesday.
   ``Nationwide, there might be thousands of small towns served by
TCI that, if this were allowed, we would have the economic power to
have a hometown channel,'' he said.
   The network is evaulating the proposal, NBC spokesman Richard
Cutting said Wednesday. He had no further comment. TCI released the
proposal Tuesday.
   Under the proposal, the Denver-based TCI would create a string
of NBC stations in small communities that lack the money to become
network affiliates.
   The cable company would bracket NBC programming, such as ``The
Cosby Show'' and ``L.A. Law,'' with locally produced news and
sports shows where economically feasible, John Malone, TCI
president, said in a letter to NBC President Robert Wright.
   In the letter, Malone said TCI would comply with the same terms
that an NBC affiliate must adhere to, but would not require an
affiliate fee from the network in exchange for the use of NBC's
signal.
   The firm also would continue to comply with Federal
Communication Commission regulations requiring that cable companies
carry regional networks.
   TCI would earn revenues by selling local advertising time on NBC
shows. It also could add cable subscribers by offering a new local
channel.
   ``It would be a win-win situation. Local advertisers would have
a local channel to advertise on. Local subscribers would have a
channel that emphasized local news, sports and current events,''
Thomson said. ``And the local cable operator would hopefully have
better penetration in that community.''
   A stumbling block to carrying out the proposal are network
contracts that give existing NBC affiliates exclusive rights in
regional broadcast markets.
   Thomson said TCI approached NBC because of its 23 percent market
share, which leads all broadcast networks. In contrast, each of the
most popular cable networks, CNN and ESPN, has a 2 percent share.
   NBC, a majority owner of the CNBC consumer cable channel, is
also participating in a proposed direct broadcast venture called
Sky Cable that will beam more than 100 channels to owners of small
home satellite dishes.
   John Redden, an analyst with the Connecticut-based Moran &amp;
Associates Inc., said the proposal would open the local programming
door to TCI.
   ``NBC would benefit because it would get its signal extended and
become more entrenched in that community,'' he said.
   TCI has about 8.5 million subscribers nationwide.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pathe Communications Corp.'s planned buyout
of MGM-United Artists may fall apart because a major backer says
Pathe can't rely on borrowed funds and must come up with millions
in equity.
   Time Warner Inc. is insisting that Pathe must arrange $600
million in equity, $450 million of that itself, toward the $1.2
billion bid for MGM-UA, following guidelines of an April financing
agreement.
   Pathe's ability to fund the acquisition is now in serious doubt,
and the company will almost certainly need an extension on a
Saturday deadline.
   Under the April agreement, Time Warner would loan $650 million
toward the purchase, with Pathe contributing the rest. In return
for the loan, Time Warner would receive distribution rights to the
huge United Artists film library as well as future Pathe and MGM-UA
movies, including ``Rocky V.''
   Pathe officials said earlier this month that most of its share
of the cost would come from loans, asset sales and possible resale
of some MGM-UA stock.
   Though Time Warner officials initially seemed to approve of the
plan, they later feared that Pathe was taking on too much debt.
   Money would come from companies affiliated with Pathe, said
Pathe spokesman Craig Parsons, and therefore should not be called
loans.
   ``We're paying (the money) back in shares of stock, so this is
not a loan in the conventional sense,'' he said. ``It could be
considered equity.''
   Parsons also said Pathe had already put down $200 million in
capital as a down payment.

   More than 16,000 pieces of fine china, 1,450
Baccarat crystal goblets and a serving tray large enough to hold a
roast pig are among the excesses from CenTrust Bank to be sold at
auction.
   A preview of the luxury items that supplied an exclusive dining
club set up by the bank's ex-chairman, David Paul, was held at
CenTrust in Miami Tuesday. The whole batch goes up for sale
Saturday as federal regulators try to recover at least part of the
$2 billion cost of bailing out the thrift _ the state's largest
savings and loan until it was seized in February.
   Regulators charge Paul with using the failed thrift as his
``personal piggy bank.''
   The items for sale include small silver tongs for french fries
and large silver tongs for ice cubes, a flat-slotted spoon for
serving aspargus and a racked pan for holding asparagus.
   Silver-plated grape scissors, bone holders, lemon squeezers and
pate spreaders are among the odder implements for sale.
   ``It's a bit much,'' said Eleanor Matthews, a contract
administrator for Florida's Dade County. ``I have to say I never
knew there were silver holders for paper plates and cups before.''
   Gold-rimmed, five-piece Limoges china settings sell for $600 and
each piece of crystal sells for $140, but no minumum prices have
been set for most of the items at the auction.
   A signed copy of ``The Works of H.G. Wells'' will be offered for
an undisclosed price, one of many leather-bound books that once
lined the shelves in Paul's office.

<HEAD>Enlarged Loss Linked to Writedown of Federated Goodwill</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: All dollars are U.S.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financially distressed Campeau Corp. lost $1.7
billion last year, a huge deterioration from 1988's deficit of $34
million, the Canadian company reported Wednesday.
   A large share of the loss _ $958 million _ resulted from writing
down the goodwill of one of Toronto-based Campeau's U.S. retail
divisions, Federated Department Stores Inc. Federated and its
sister retailing company Allied Stores Corp. are operating under
U.S. bankruptcy court supervision.
   Goodwill is the value placed on a company's reputation typically
due to the quality of its services or products.
   On the other side of the books, Campeau said it had revenue of
$10.4 billion from its department stores, supermarkets and real
estate operations in the 12 months ended Jan. 31, 1990. That
compares with $8.7 billion for 1988.
   Last year's revenue gain for Campeau mainly was due to a
contribution of a full year's results from Federated and Ralphs
Grocery Co., bought in May 1988.
   The 1989 results also include the $101-million sale of Allied's
Ann Taylor division and a gain of $104 million from the sale of a
number of pieces of real estate in the United States. Campeau
acquired Allied in 1986.
   Campeau's real estate operations, which are in Canada, posted
1989 revenue of $202 million compared with $169 million in 1988.
   ``Real estate revenues did seem to be very strong in the year,
suggesting that Campeau can survive without the retail
operations,'' said Janet Mangano, an analyst with Josepthal &amp; Co.
in New York.
   Earlier this month, Campeau debenture holders said they would
defer certain interest payments until next year. The company has
been struggling to cope with a cash shortage caused by heavy debts
amassed in trying to build an extensive retail empire. A planned
reorganizaion of Campeau would include asset sales.
   On Tuesday, Cincinnati-based Federated and Allied reported a
combined loss of $99.5 million in the quarter ended May 5.
   The two U.S. divisions, which cited $7.7 billion in debts in
filing for U.S. Bankruptcy Court protection from creditors in
January, operate 260 stores in 28 states.

active trading Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as crop
damage concerns continued to guide the market.
   Trading of corn futures were particularly volatile as prices
surged on reports of flooded fields in several key producing states.
   The surge in prices ignited a selloff by professionals and
commercial houses looking for profits, said William Biedermann, an
analyst with Allendale Inc. in Chicago.
   ``The people who bought into the market on Monday had more than
a dime in profits,'' Biedermann said of the sellers. ``That's a
heck of a profit to make.''
   He said reports of extensive damage to crops in some areas of
the Midwest continue to cause concern on the market.
   Thousands of acres are reported under water in Nebraska. And
heavy rains in Iowa have reportedly damaged 340,000 crop acres in
that state.
   Analysts say the crops in some areas must be replanted.
   Soybean prices also were buoyed by concern that soybean yield
could be adversely affected by heavy rains. Reports that farmers in
South America were not marketing their bean crop in hopes for
higher prices also helped boost soybean futures.
   Wheat futures were helped by strong export demand, as well as
indications of further yield reductions in the Midwest soft red
winter wheat crop due to excessive moisture.
   At the close, wheat was unchanged to 2 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.34\ a bushel; corn was 2} cents
lower to 1 cent higher with July at $2.85} a bushel; oats were }
cent to 1 cent lower wtih July at $1.40{ a bushel; soybeans were 4
cents to 8 cents higher with July at $5.98{ a bushel.

   A federal grand jury has returned a
12-count indictment against a former Jackson couple for their role
in the failure of Republic Bank For Savings, officials said
Wednesday.
   Philip K. Shunk, and his wife, Linda, are jointly charged with
one count of conspiracy to misapply Republic's funds, three counts
of making false entries in various bank reports, and one count of
converting the proceeds of stock held by Republic to their own use.
   Republic Bank For Savings, F.A., is a federally chartered
savings and loan institution.
   Philip Shunk faces a maximum penalty of $3 million in fines and
up to 65 years in prison. Linda Shunk faces up to 30 years in
prison and a $1.25 million in fine.
   ``Today's indictment is further proof that we are determined to
pursue allegations of financial fraud in the savings and loan
industry until we have punished those who have profited illegally
at the expense of the American taxpayer,'' Attorney General Dick
Thornburg said in a statement.
   Federal regulators were appointed two years ago to take over
Republic, which reportedly had a deficit of $12.3 million, said
U.S. Attorney George L. Phillips.
   ``As a result of federal investigations, we now believe that
Republic's losses may be significantly higher,'' Phillips said.
   Philip Shunk was hired Oct. 28, 1985, as president of Republic,
and Linda Shunk was named executive vice president and chief
financial officer. Both served on Republic's board of directors.
   During the time of their employment, the Shunks served on
Republic's loan committee.
   The indictment charges that one or both of them made false
statements in Republic's records concerning meetings of the loan
committee nine times in an effort to deceive S&amp;L examiners.

   The stock market dropped today in the third
straight day of light volume after the Federal Reserve predicted
continued slow economic growth.
   Although the Fed report contained few surprises, it led to a
quick drop in the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials.
   The Dow fell 15.09 to 2,878.47 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street today.
The Dow had gained 11.38 Tuesday as it rebounded from a 53.71 point
drop Monday.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 3 to 2 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 557 up, 872 down and 532 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 113.15 million shares with an
hour to go today.
   After the Fed issued its forecast for slow growth and little
change in inflation, the Dow and bond market fell. Groping for any
news available on the future of interest rates, some apparently saw
the report as a sign that rates would not fall soon.
   ``A little bit of news one way or the other can turn this
thing,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president and market
strategist at Gruntal &amp; Co.
   The week's light volume has been attributed to slowed buying
resulting from concern, particularly among institutional investors,
over interest rates and corporate earnings, analysts said.
   ``It's a period of marking time and waiting for things to
happen,'' said Edwin Kantor, chairman of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Big Board volume totaled 134.93 million shares Tuesday, against
133.47 million Monday.
   Varity Corp. was down &lsqb; at 3 as the most active stock on the
NYSE today. Among other active stocks, Canadian Pacific was
unchanged at 17~, Banc One was down } at 28} and Citicorp is down &rsqb;

   On the over-the-counter market, TW Holdings was the most active,

distance service designed to bring features normally reserved for
larger companies to smaller businesses, was down } at 41}.
   Oracle Systems was down &lsqb; at 23 and Summit Technology was up 1|

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 0.62 to 194.99. At the American Stock Exchange, the market

   General Motors Corp. has fixed the problem of a
swelling door on its new Saturn model, and the first marketable car
should roll off a Tennessee assembly line on schedule this summer,
the company said Wednesday.
   Officials from GM and its wholly owned subsidiary, Saturn Corp.,
have refused to say exactly when ``Job 1'' will be assembled. But
GM Chairman Roger Smith has said he expects to drive the first car
off the assembly line before he retires July 31.
   ``Our plans still anticipate that would occur prior to his
retirement,'' Saturn spokeswoman Laurie Kay said Wednesday.
   Saturn is a $3 billion project to build a car with a base price
of less than $12,000 to compete directly with those made by
Japanese companies. About two-thirds of the project cost is tied up
in the Spring Hill, Tenn., manufacturing complex.
   Kay acknowledged the car's plastic door panels swelled in high
temperatures, a problem traced to materials. She refused to
disclose the severity of the swelling, but said Saturn remains on
schedule.
   ``Saturn is not experiencing any more pre-production problems
than normally encountered with the startup of an all-new vehicle,''
Kay said.
   Much of the Saturn car's body panels will be made of plastics.
The panels will be formed in a process called injection molding,
which until now has been used in making automotive parts no larger
than a bumper.
   GM has said repeatedly it plans to begin commercial production
this summer with the vehicles first arriving in dealerships this
fall. The automaker won't say exactly when production startup is
scheduled at the factory south of Nashville.
   The company already has assembled some Saturn cars to test
manufacturing equipment and processes. Those cars, which do not
have vehicle identification numbers, will be used in crash tests
and other research and training programs.

<TEXT>
   The White House and congressional Democrats,
drawing their political swords for an election-year battle, are
bluntly blaming each other for the multibillion-dollar savings and
loan scandal.
   But President Bush said today he wants to stay out of that
debate.
   ``What I'm trying to do is not respond to individuals and to
simply keep moving forward on this process,'' Bush told a news
conference in Huntsville, Ala.
   The White House went on the offensive Tuesday, daring Democrats
to try to turn the crisis into a campaign issue.
   ``There are a lot of battles that can be fought on this turf,
and we're ready,'' White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
warned. He said ``the Democrats have a big role'' in the collapse
of the savings and loan industry.
   Returning the fire, Democrats accused the White House of moving
sluggishly against those who looted thrift institutions.
   ``A spark seemed to be ignited there and I think more important
than continuing to pour fuel on that spark is to work cooperatively
with the Congress in trying to get this mess solved,'' Bush said.
   Pointing to 10 years of Republican rule in the White House, Sen.
Tim Wirth, D-Colo., questioned, ``Who ran the government during
this decade of mismanagement and negligence?''
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., who was singled out for attack by the
White House, called Fitzwater ``the mean-spirited little
spokesman'' and accused him of trying to intimidate Democrats into
silence.
   Referring to another sensitive political issue, Sen. David
Pryor, D-Ark., said, ``Maybe Mr. Fitzwater has been so busy the
last two or three weeks protecting us from the flag burners that he
forgot to do his homework on the history of the last decade.''
   In an apparent attempt to blunt criticism that his
administration is not doing enough to prosecute S&amp;L crime,
President Bush is scheduled on Friday to address the nation's 93
U.S. attorneys. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh summoned the top
federal prosecutors to the meeting at the Justice Department, said
spokesman Dan Eramian.
   The charges and counter-charges did not shed any new light on
the S&amp;L scandal but put it into sharp focus as a key issue for the
fall elections.
   Estimates of how much it will cost taxpayers to clean up the
industry range anywhere from $130 billion to $500 billion and more.
   There were these other S&amp;L developments Tuesday:
   _Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., demanded that federal regulators
spell out their charges against President Bush's son, Neil, in the
$1 billion collapse of the Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan
Association of Denver.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision has brought administrative
charges against Neil Bush, a former director of Silverado, but has
not publicly outlined its case. ``No law or regulation prevents the
agency from revealing the charges,'' Annunzio said at a hearing by
the House Banking Committee. Neil Bush has denied any wrongdoing.
   _Charles H. Keating Jr. predicted that a federal judge will give
him back his Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, seized by the
government in April 1989 in perhaps the nation's costliest S&amp;L
collapse. Lawyers for Keating and the government summarized final
arguments in the case Tuesday before U.S. District Judge Stanley
Sporkin.
   Fitzwater's attack against Democrats was notable both for the
sharpness of his words and his willingness to point fingers.
   ``Take a look at Jim Wright and Tony Coelho and Mr. Kerrey and
some of his Nebraska accounts and Don Riegle and DeConcini; take a
look at all of them,'' Fitzwater said. ``I don't think you hear any
serious analysis of this problem that doesn't point to Freddy St
Germain and the changes that were made in the banking laws back at
that point.''
   Wright, the former House speaker, and Coelho, the former House
assistant Democratic leader and a principal Democratic fund-raiser,
resigned last year amid questions of ethical impropriety.
   Riegle and DeConcini are among five legislators being
investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee for allegedly
intervening with federal regulators after accepting political
contributions from Keating.
   Fernand St Germain was chairman of the House Banking Committee
during the adoption of a bill _ cosponsored by Sen. Jake Garn,
R-Utah _ to overhaul the S&amp;L industry. Fitzwater did not elaborate
on his remarks about Kerrey.
   Asked if he would say if Republicans were at fault for the
crisis, Fitzwater replied, ``No.'' He said Neil Bush was not
involved in any S&amp;L scandal.
   On Capitol Hill, Pryor said Congress' fault was one of
negligence in not requiring regulators in the last years of the
Reagan administration to take lie-detector tests. ``They simply
were not telling us the truth. The truth was that the S&amp;L crisis
was here, it was happening and we were not being told the truth,''
he said.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas applauded Fitzwater
and said he hopes he keeps it up. ``The president doesn't have to
take it lying down just because some member of Congress attacks,''
Dole said.
   As for blame for the crisis, Dole said, ``In the final analysis,
it lies everywhere.''

   Stocks prices dipped slightly today in the third
straight day of light trading.
   A midday report from the Federal Reserve that predicted slower
economic growth and little change in inflation sent prices down
quickly in the early afternoon. The report contained few surprises,
but moved the waffling market.
   ``A little bit of news one way or another can turn this thing,''
Alan Ackerman, senior vice president and market strategist at
Gruntal &amp; Co, said. Investors have been groping for the slightest
signal of where interest rates are headed, market watchers said.
   Late in the day stock prices began to recover.
   Many investors, also apparently concerned about corporate
profits, have sat out. Volume has been down to what Walter Murphy,
senior market specialist at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., called ``bordering
on abysmal.''
   Institutional investors have also apparently been sitting out,
analysts said.
   ``It's a period of marking time and waiting for things to

for the other shoe to drop.''

<HEAD>Crude Continues to Fall, Other Products Rebound</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crude oil prices continued to slide Wednesday,
remaining at levels not seen since late 1988, amid ongoing concerns
about oversupply.
   The futures price of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, for July delivery tumbled 35 cents to
settle at $15.30 a 42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Other contract months also fell.
   The last time crude traded in that range was in November 1988,
according to energy analysts.
   The July contract had fallen 29 cents on Tuesday and 68 cents
Monday.
   Market watchers said the drop was due partly to the fact that
the July contract was set to expire on Wednesday. But they said
continued concern about overproduction among the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries was also a big factor.
   ``There's concern that OPEC is not willing to take steps to
shore up the market,'' said Peter Beutel, an assistant director of
the energy group at Elders Futures Inc.
   A report released late Tuesday by the American Petroleum
Institute also didn't help. API said inventory levels of crude oil,
an important factor in pricing, fell 1.2 million barrels last week
to 384.4 billion barrels.
   But analysts said the drop was slight and, therefore, not enough
to lift prices.
   ``They (the figures) were not bad. But they were not good enough
to turn things around,'' said Beutel.
   The drop in crude oil Wednesday did help other protroleum
products, as traders used some of the proceeds from crude sales to
buy unleaded gasoline or heating oil.
   On the New York Merc, the July contract for wholesale unleaded
gasoline settled up 0.55 cent to 60.47 cents a gallon, after
tumbling 1.64 cents Tuesday largely on profit-taking.
   Wholesale home heating oil for July delivery settled 0.21 cent
higher at 47.64 cents a gallon on the exchange, after losing 0.43
cent on Tuesday.
   In natural gas trading, the July contract closed at $1.510 per
1,000 cubic feet, down from $1.536 Tuesday.

<HEAD>Kohlberg Kravis Plans Recapitalization of Food and Tobacco Giant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. said Wednesday it
planned to recapitalize its RJR Nabisco Inc., an indication the
giant company will not be broken up and eventually will return to
public ownership.
   Under the tentative plan, Kohlberg Kravis would retire a large
part of the $6 billion in junk bonds it used to buy the food and
tobacco company in a record $24.53 billion buyout last year.
   Kohlberg Kravis also would issue preferred stock convertible
into common stock in RJR Nabisco.
   By retiring some of its old junk bonds, which have fallen in
value during recent months, Kohlberg Kravis would avoid having to
pay a sharply higher interest rate on some of the securities next
year.
   The sale of stock under the plan also would counter any notions
that Kohlberg Kravis plans to systematically dismantle RJR Nabisco,
as it did after it bought the consumer products conglomerate
Beatrice Co. in 1985.
   Beatrice once owned such well-known businesses as the Avis car
rental company, Tropicana juice products, Hunt and Wesson foods,
Samsonite luggage, Swift meats, Playtex personal products and
Culligan water softeners.
   Between its $6.1 billion acquisition of Beatrice in 1985 and
this month, when the conglomerate's remaining food operations were
sold, Kohlberg Kravis divested the company piece by piece.
   Some of the businesses fetched prices of over $1 billion.
Kohlberg Kravis and its investors ended up reaping a fat 50 percent
return on their original equity investment.
   RJR Nabisco also has a variety of food lines and a separate
tobacco business. But analysts say that while Beatrice was ripe for
an unbundling of its disparate businesses, RJR Nabisco is not.
   Beatrice ``had this and that _ a lot of things that didn't make
sense to have together anyway,'' said Jack Maxwell, an analyst who
follows RJR Nabisco for Wheat, First Securities Inc. in Richmond,
Va.
   RJR Nabisco has product lines that conceivably could be pared,
but Maxwell said he doubted Kohlberg Kravis would begin unloading
food divisions and ``you can't sell bits and pieces of the tobacco
business very well.''
   Since its buyout, RJR has divested $5.66 billion in assets to
pare its debt load, which now stands at $22 billion. Its Del Monte
canned foods and fresh fruit businesses and some of its foreign
holdings were among those sold.
   But, said Maxwell, ``They've sold pretty much what they want to
sell.''
   In its announcement Wednesday, RJR Nabisco said Kohlberg Kravis
would invest an additional $1.7 billion in the company as part of
the recapitalization, another move that points away from a breakup
of the company.
   Analysts see RJR Nabisco returning to public ownership,
beginning at some point in the next few years. That is the route
taken by another Kohlberg Kravis holding, Safeway Stores Inc.
   After Safeway went private in a 1986 leveraged buyout, the
supermarket company began hammering away at its debt and
streamlined its operations. This past February, 3{ years after the
buyout, the company announced a modest initial offering of 10
million shares.
   RJR Nabisco said it was negotiating new loans with banks as part
of the recapitalization plan. The company said it expected to begin
enacting the plan by the end of July.
   The recapitalization is intended to take off the market some of
RJR Nabisco's junk bonds that have declined in value during recent
months. A buyback of the bonds would allow Kohlberg Kravis to
sidestep provisions requiring the firm to guarantee the price of
the bonds by next April.
   The plan is likely to lower the return for Kohlberg Kravis and
its investors. But without a recapitalization, RJR Nabisco would
end up paying a higher interest rate on the bonds.
   RJR Nabisco bonds rose sharply Wednesday on word of the
recapitalization, gaining as much as $6.25 per $100 in face value.
   Kohlberg Kravis' investors mostly are large pension funds that
generally do not have an active voice in the management of the
companies they own, including RJR Nabisco. Officials of several
funds declined to comment on what they'd like to see happen to RJR
Nabisco.
   But several said they were satisfied with the management of
their investments.
   David Weig, executive director of the Washington State
Investment Board, said he was ``absolutely happy,'' with the
management at RJR Nabisco and with Kohlberg Kravis.
   Oregon state pension officials also said they were happy. ``We
have had excellent returns from these kinds of investments,'' said
Sheryl Wilson, executive director of the state's retirement funds.

<HEAD>Oversupply Continues to Weigh on Crude Oil Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices were mixed in trading Wednesday on the New
York Mercantile Exchange as crude oil futures continued their
plunge in a market plagued by oversupply.
   On other markets, grain and soybean prices were mixed, precious
metals were higher, copper declined and livestock and pork futures
were mixed.
   Heavy selling of the expiring July contract for West Texas
Intermediate, the benchmark grade of crude oil, weighed on the
energy market, analysts said.
   However, gasoline and heating oil prices rose.
   The decline in crude prices came in the wake of American
Petroleum Institute figures, out Tuesday, showing U.S. crude
inventories last week declined by 1.2 million barrels to 384.4
million. But despite the decline, crude stocks remain 44.3 million
barrels above last year's level, analysts said.
   Gasoline stocks declined to 216.6 million barrels from 217
million.
   ``There is too much pumped crude for the refineries to handle,''
said James Fiedler, an analyst with E.D. &amp; F. Man International
Futures Inc. in New York.
   ``It (stocks) didn't build overnight. And it will take time for
the refineries to work through it.''
   There was some uncertainty in the market due to a shakeup in the
Kuwaiti government that resulted in the removal of longtime oil
minister Sheikh Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah.
   Named as oil minister was Rashid Salim Al-Ameeri. Sheikh Ali
Khalifa was named finance minister.
   West Texas Intermediate crude settled 35 cents lower to 14 cents
higher with the July contract at $15.30 a pound; heating oil was
.03 cent to .21 cent higher with July at 47.64 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .05 cent lower to .61 cent higher with July
at 60.47 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed on the Chicago Board
of Trade as crop damage concerns continued to guide the market.
   Trading of corn futures were particularly volatile as prices
surged on reports of flooded fields in several key producing states.
   The surge in prices ignited a selloff by professionals and
commercial houses looking for profits, said William Biedermann, an
analyst with Allendale Inc. in Chicago.
   ``The people who bought into the market on Monday had more than
a dime in profits,'' Biedermann said of the sellers. ``That's a
heck of a profit to make.''
   Thousands of acres are reported under water in Nebraska. And
heavy rains in Iowa have reportedly damaged 340,000 crop acres in
that state.
   Analysts say the crops in some areas must be replanted.
   Soybean prices also were buoyed by concern that soybean yield
could be adversely affected by heavy rains. Reports that farmers in
South America were not marketing their bean crop in hopes for
higher prices also helped boost soybean futures.
   Wheat futures were helped by strong export demand, as well as
indications of further yield reductions in the Midwest soft red
winter wheat crop due to excessive moisture.
   Wheat was unchanged to 3 cents higher with July at $3.34{ a
bushel; corn was a 2} cent lower to 1\ cent higher with July at
$2.85\ a bushel; oats were a { cent to 1 cent lower wtih July at
$1.40{ a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 7\ cents higher with July
at $5.98 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Cattle futures were lower on concerns the fed cattle supplies
will increase during the summer and reduce cash prices.
   Pork futures were higher on perceptions that the recent drops in
prices were overdone.
   Live cattle were .18 cent to .70 cent lower with June at 76.65
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent to .52 cent lower with
August at 85.30 cents a pound; hogs were .25 cent lower to .33 cent
higher with June at 60.50 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
1.30 cents lower to .70 cent higher with July at 63.40 cents a
pound.
   Precious metals futures climbed on the New York's Commodity
Exchange, although there was little news to stimulate the market,
analysts said.
   Gold was $1 to $1.40 higher with June at $350.50 a troy ounce;
silver was 1.4 cents to 1.7 cents higher wtih June at $4.832 a troy
ounce.
   Copper futures declined sharply on the Comex on the perception
that recent price gains were overdone.
   Also weighing on copper prices was a report from the Federal
Reserve Bank that points to a slowdown in the U.S. economy and a
decline in construction. Increased stocks in Comex- and London
Metals Exchange-approved warehouses also helped push prices lower.
   Copper prices were 1.85 cents to 4.15 cents lower with June at
$1.1045 a pound.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The dollar rose against most other major
currencies Wednesday in light trading, boosted by concern about
political uncertainty in the Soviet Union, traders said.
   Gold prices rose domestically after a mixed performance
overseas. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold rose $1.40 an
ounce to $350.50. Later, Republic National Bank in New York
reported a late bid of $349.60 an ounce, up $1.70 from Tuesday.
   The dollar was helped by a comment from Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev that soon he might no longer be leader of the Communist
Party, traders said.
   At a party meeting in Moscow, Gorbachev acknowledged that he
could lose his party post at a national congress in less than two
weeks.
   The news caused a flight to the dollar in the currency markets,
typical in times of uncertainty, said Andrew Hodge, vice president
of corporate treasury services at Bank Brussels Lambert in New York.
   But the dollar retreated somewhat later in the day, Hodge said.
   The mark was the currency most affected by Gorbachev's comments,
traders said. In Europe, the dollar closed at 1.6785 marks, up from
1.6712 Tuesday. Later, in New York, the dollar closed at 1.6783
marks, up from 1.6725 marks. The British pound lost ground against
the dollar in New York after rising overseas. In London, the pound
rose to $1.7225 from $1.7198 late Tuesday. In New York, the pound
was quoted at $1.7220, cheaper than the $1.7225 it cost late
Tuesday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.26 yen to a closing 153.98 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 154.00 yen, and
in New York it closed at 153.95 yen to the dollar, up from 153.485
yen late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's prices, included: 1.4130 Swiss francs, up from 1.4090;
5.6410 French francs, up from 5.6230; 1,231.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,227.25; and 1.1730 Canadian dollars, down from 1.17385.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
levels, included: 1.4155 Swiss francs, up from 1.4100; 5.6405
French francs, up from 5.6177; 1.8878 Dutch guilders, up from
1.8800; 1,231.00 Italian lire, up from 1,226.00; and 1.1723
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1738.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $349.15 a troy ounce
from $348.25 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold fell to a closing
bid of $347.25 from $347.80 late Tuesday. Gold in Hong Kong fell
$1.60 to close at a bid of $348.85.
   Silver bullion fell in London to $4.82 a troy ounce from
Tuesday's late bid of $4.84. In New York, silver closed at $4.832 a
troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange, up from $4.815 late Tuesday.

   Stocks were mixed Wednesday as the waffling
market looked for direction in its third straight day of quiet
trading.
   A Federal Reserve prediction of continued slow economic growth
and little change in inflation sent the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials down quickly in the early afternoon. Bond prices also
tumbled.
   The report held few surprises, but analysts said investors were
groping for any sign of where interest rates might be headed.
   ``It was just an excuse to bring this thing in a little bit,''
Alan Ackerman, senior vice president and market strategist at
Gruntal &amp; Co, said.
   The Dow industrials recovered later in the day to finish up 1.74
at 2,895.30. Broader indexes were down. The Dow average of 20
transportations was down 1.82 at 1,177.01 nd the average of 15
utilities was down 0.38 at 208.56.
   Declining issues outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 6 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
668 up, 777 down and 555 unchanged.
   ``I can describe the market in three sentences,'' Ackerman said.
``No trend. No volume. No clear-cut conviction.''
   Volume has been light this week as investors, particularly
institutions, wait for signs of whether the Fed plans to ease
monetary policy, analysts said.
   ``A lot of people are just sitting on the sidelines waiting for
the other shoe to drop,'' said Edwin Kantor, chairman of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 137.42 million
shares, up from 134.93 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 166.12 million shares.
   Varity Corp. was the most active NYSE-listed issue, trading down
&lsqb; at 3. Candadian Pacific was up &lsqb; at 18 and Banc One was down | at
28~. Among other active NYSE stocks, Upjohn was up 2 at 42,
Citicorp was down &rsqb; at 22{ and Occidental Petroleum was down \ at
25}.
   Among blue chips, Chevron was down } at 70~, Diversified
Energies was up 1\ at 32{ and General Motors gained \ at 49{.
   On the over-the-counter market, Telephonos de Mexico was the
most active stock, up 1-32 at 1 23-32. MCI Communications was down
~ at 41| and TW Holdings was up 1-16 at 4{.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $3.82 billion, or 0.11
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.23 to 195.84.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.11 to 421.12, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 0.63 at 359.10.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
0.27 to 460.80. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 360.81, down 0.02.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush defended his administration's
prosecution of savings and loan fraud and offered an olive branch
Wednesday to Democrats critical of the effort.
   ``There has been an active prosecution under way,'' Bush told
reporters at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.
   His remarks came a day after he reviewed the Justice
Department's anti-fraud effort with Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh and after his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, attacked
Democrats critical of the president's handling of the S&amp;L mess.
   Bush, who is scheduled to address the nation's 93 U.S. attorneys
in Washington on Friday, said Thornburgh offered ``impressive
numbers'' on the S&amp;L fraud cases being pursued, adding ``I expect
we'll see plenty more.''
   ``Put those that are guilty into the dock, where they belong,
and see that they are, you know, brought to responsibility for what
they've done,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, the House voted 420-1 Wednesday to provide the
Justice Department with $75 million to fight white-collar crime in
financial institutions during fiscal year 1991 beginning Oct. 1. At
the administration's request, Congress had provided $50 million in
1990, an amount Democrats said was inadequate.
   On Tuesday, Fitzwater declared the administration ready to do
political battle over the issue, citing several current and former
Democratic members of Congress as vulnerable to criticism.
   The spokesman mentioned Sens. Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan,
chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Dennis DeConcini of
Arizona and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska; former House Speaker Jim Wright
of Texas; former Rep. Tony Coelho of California, and former House
Banking Committee Chairman Fernand J. St Germain of Rhode Island.
   ``What he (Fitzwater) did was appropriate,'' Bush said. ``But
what I'm trying to do is not respond to individuals and to simply
keep moving forward on this process.''
   Bush conceded that ``a spark seemed to be ignited there'' by
Fitzwater's remarks, but added, ``I think more important than
continuing to pour fuel on the spark is to work cooperatively with
the Congress in trying to get this mess solved.''
   Democratic criticism of Bush's management of the S&amp;L bailout has
been growing since last month, when the administration said
Congress would have to provide a second bailout of $30 billion to
$50 billion later this year.
   Meanwhile, an organization affiliated with consumer activist
Ralph Nader issued a report criticizing the administration's
``anemic'' efforts to prosecute S&amp;L fraud.
   The report, by Public Citizen's Congress Watch, estimated that
the government's civil and criminal actions have recovered only
$300 million in S&amp;L losses. That's less than 2 percent of the $16.3
billion in losses attributed to fraud among the 440 S&amp;Ls seized by
the government since early last year, the group said.
   ``The Bush administration's efforts to pursue and punish S&amp;L
fraud have been anemic at best, irresponsible at worst,'' said
Sherry Ettleson, an attorney who prepared a 23-page report on the
issue for the group.
   The Nader organization faulted the administration for spending
only an additional $50 million on pursuing thrift crime, when
Congress had authorized spending of up to $75 million. The
administration has responded that Congress eventually appropriated
only $50 million and officials are spending that amount.
   It said the Justice Department is pursuing 891 cases actively,
compared with a backlog of 6,993 cases. Yet, the department has
added fewer than half the 425 additional agents requested by the
FBI and only 118 of the 231 assistant U.S. attorneys requested by
the department's field offices, the report said.
   ``Based on the record thus far, there is little evidence that
the Bush administration is committed to catching and punishing
white-collar criminals who largely caused the worst financial
scandal in U.S. history,'' Ettleson wrote.
   The group recommended that the administration spend more on
pursuing fraud, turn its attention to accountants and lawyers who
aided S&amp;L executives in committing fraud and drop its support of
proposed legislation that would remove the threat of triple damages
from civil racketeering suits.
   It said Congress should enact legislation that would permit
whistleblowers to bring suit against alleged S&amp;L criminals on
behalf of the government and share in the damages if fraud is found
to have occurred.

<HEAD>USX Ends Offer Of Oil, Gas Wells</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USX Corp. on Wednesday withdrew its offer to
sell oil and natural gas wells in the West and Southwest.
   The steel and energy giant last fall offered six groups of wells
owned by its Texas Oil &amp; Gas Corp. and has sold two of them.
   Atlantic Richfield Co. bought 175 natural gas wells in
southwestern Oklahoma for $53 million, and Sonat Inc., an Alabama
company, paid $140 million for Texas Oil and Gas properties in
Arkansas.
   The sale of one of the remaining four will be announced by the
end of the month, USX said. It is taking the other three off the
market. The four packages are in eastern Texas, western Texas,
Oklahoma and California.
   An oversupply of crude and refined oil made the Texas Oil &amp; Gas
properties less attractive, an analyst speculated.
   ``They're not changing their mind. The market's changing it for
them,'' said Greg Drahuschak of Butcher &amp; Singer in Pittsburgh.
   ``If you sell your house, but no one at the party meets your
price tag, there's a point where you say, `No, I'm just not
selling,' '' Drahuschak said. ``Today's announcement is a
recognition that sale of all the properties was probably
optimistic.''
   Texas Oil &amp; Gas accounted for 5.5 percent of USX's 1989 sales.
The division posted losses of $21 million in 1986, broke even in
1987, lost $31 million in 1988 and earned $125 million last year.

<HEAD>Penny Stock, Reform Bills Advance in House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bills that would crack down on penny stock
fraud and increase the authority of the Securities and Exchange
Commission to seek fines and halt alleged wrongdoing cleared a
House panel Wednesday.
   The Penny Stock Reform Act and the Securities Law Enforcement
Remedies Act passed a subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee by voice vote and now are subject to consideration by the
full committee.
   The remedies act would give the SEC the power to issue ``cease
and desist'' orders against suspected wrongdoers without having to
go to court first.
   Unlike many other federal regulatory agencies like the Federal
Trade Commission, the SEC does not have the authority to halt
alleged illegal activity without a court order.
   The penny stock bill would give the SEC power to bar crooked
promoters and consultants from selling highly speculative stocks
which usually sell for a dollar or less.
   Penny stocks, low-priced and often risky securities, are traded
over the counter rather than on a stock exchange. Because most
information about them comes from the brokers who sell them,
investments in penny stocks _ which typically are used to finance
new or small companies _ are considered chancey at best.
   Penny stocks are not, in themselves, illegal but a 1989 study by
the North American Securities Administrators Association, a
Washington-based organization of state investment regulators,
claimed that American investors lost about $2 billion a year in
penny stock scams.
   ``For most of the last decade, the unscrupulous brokers and
promoters in the penny stock market have preyed on unsuspecting
investors in a cloudy atmosphere of regulatory neglect and public
ignorance,'' said Rep. Edward J. markey, chairman of the finance
and telecommunications subcommittee. Markey introduced the bill in
April with the subcommittee's ranking Republican, Matthew J.
Rinaldo of New Jersey.
   The version passed by the subcommittee differed from the
original bill, however, which would have required all penny stocks
to be listed on an automated stock price quotation system. The
amended version only requires the SEC to facilitate at ``the
earliest feasible time'' an automated quote system.
   The new version also watered down original restrictions on
so-called ``blank check'' investments which seek customers' money
without a specific business plan or purpose, and ``blind pool''
penny stocks, which seek mergers and acquisitions in a specific
industry or line of business.
   Rather than an outright ban, the amended version would require
the SEC to adopt rules calling for improved disclosure of
information about companies selling penny stocks to the public.

<HEAD>Electronics Firm Plans Global Cellular System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SCHAUMBURG, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motorola Inc. plans to establish the
first global, satellite-based cellular phone system at a cost of up
to $2 billion, according to a report published Wednesday.
   The system would require the launching of a network of
low-orbiting satellites that would extend cellular services into
remote areas of the United States and around the world, the Chicago
Tribune reported.
   The system would be used by international travelers and
residents of remote areas of the United States where it would not
be economical to build land-based transmitters of cellular signals.
   Analysts said the system's cost could total $1 billion to $2
billion.
   Telephone calls to Motorola officials seeking comment were not
returned Wednesday. Motorola officials have scheduled a briefing on
Tuesday in New York to unveil the system.
   Industry sources say it would involve launching about 70 small
satellites to carry telephone signals around the world, and would
be operating by the mid-1990s. Approval by the Federal
Communications Commission would be required.
   John Pemberton, an analyst with Gartner Group Inc., a research
firm in Stamford, Conn., said the system would represent a major
change in cellular communications technology.
   Pemberton said he believes Motorola is planning a system that
will use a ground-based and satellite system.
   He said as the user moves from an area covered by the ground
system to a more remote area, the satellite system would take over
without the user noticing any change in voice or data transmission
quality.
   The Tribune reported that Motorola is finalizing agreements with
a number of companies capable of launching its satellites, among
them Washington, D.C.-based Orbital Sciences Corp.
   The company uses its Pegasus rocket to launch small playloads
into orbit from airplanes.
   With the satellite system, Motorola would move into an area
currently dominated by telephone companies.
   Pemberton said American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. is one company
in particular that could be hurt by Motorola's move.
   He said Motorola moved up an announcement of its plans for a
satellite system from later this year to get a jump on competitors
and to have it established as the standard for the industry.
   Reportedly, other communications companies also are moving into
global cellular telephone technology.
   AT&amp;T reportedly has teamed up with Washington-based Geostar
Corp. to develop a system similar to the one being planned by
Motorola.
   The FCC already has licensed American Mobile Satellite Corp. to
launch and operate a mobile communications system for the United
States, said Ruth Pritchard-Kelly, a company spokeswoman.
   Officials of American Mobile say the company has plans to launch
its first satellite, a geostationary unit, in 1993 to provide voice
and data communications to mobile telephone users in this country.
   Schaumburg, Ill.-based Motorola is the world's biggest supplier
of cellular phone systems and mobile and portable phones.
   Pemberton said the company's system would stimulate sales of
Motorola cellular telephone equipment.

<TEXT>
   A Getty Petroleum Corp. subsidiary and one of
its executives were accused Wednesday of conspiring with two
customers to evade payment on $946,000 in federal gasoline excise
taxes.
   Getty Terminals Corp., which distributes gasoline in the
Northeast, and one of its managers, William Rea, were named in the
four-count indictment returned by a federal grand jury in New York.
   The Justice Department said the indictment was part of a
continuing investigation into what officials called the evasion of
an estimated $1 billion a year in federal fuel excise taxes by
gasoline wholesalers.
   The indictment charged that Getty Terminals and Rea, then the
supply and trading manager, conspired with the owners of two New
York City gasoline wholesale distributorships to evade payment of
the excise taxes.
   John Pabone, owner of J &amp; J Petroleum Inc., and John Quock,
owner of Tun Yung Oil Corp., were also accused in the indictment of
participating in the scheme. The two wholesalers are accused of
agreeing to share in the proceeds of the unpaid taxes.
   Getty Terminals and Rea, now a Getty vice president, were
accused of filing false invoices to disguise the sales of 10.4
million gallons of gasoline as tax-free transactions to evade
payment of $946,000 in excise gases.
   Tun Yung had registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a
producer and was therefore eligible to purchase gasoline from Getty
Terminals without paying excise taxes.
   But Getty and Tun Yung were required to pay excise taxes of 9
cents for each gallon of gasoline sold to J&amp;J, according to the
indictment.
   The indictment charged that Getty Terminals had agreed to
disguise sales to J&amp;J as tax-free sales to Tun Yung.
   Getty Terminals said in a statement that it collected and
remitted all taxes it was required to collect.
   ``Getty Terminals has absolutely no motive to refrain from
collecting taxes inasmuch as all taxes collected are remitted to
the IRS. In fact, Getty pays in excess of $200 million in taxes
each year,'' the statement said.
   The company also defended Rea, saying it has ``the highest
regard for (his) integrity, honesty and competence.'' The statement
said he had volunteered for and passed a lie detector test.
   If convicted, Getty Terminals could be fined up to $2 million.
Each of the three individuals could be sentenced to up to 20 years
in prison and fined $1 million if convicted.
   In a separate indictment returned by the same grand jury, two
brothers who own wholesale fuel companies in Westchester County,
N.Y., were charged with participating in a complicated scheme to
purchase untaxed gasoline.
   Richard Kennon and his brother, Robert Kennon, were charged with
conspiracy to defraud the government and participating in the
filing of false excise tax returns.
   The Kennons operate Jenny Oil Corp., Oil City Enterprises Inc.
and Mount Vernon Energy Terminals Inc. The charges against each of
the Kennons carry a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment and
fines totaling $550,000.

<TEXT>
   Ameritech and Bell Atlantic Corp. sought court
permission Wednesday to carry phone traffic to New Zealand
following their recent agreement to buy that country's phone
company for $2.4 billion.
   The two regional phone companies, which were spun off from the
old Bell system in 1984, are prohibited by a federal consent decree
from carrying calls to or from the United States.
   Ameritech and Bell Atlantic said they were asking U.S. District
Judge Harold Greene, who oversaw the Bell system breakup, for a
waiver from the consent decree provisions.
   If Greene does not grant their request, the companies would have
to form another company to carry the international traffic, said
Hyde Tucker, president and chief executive officer of Bell Atlantic
International.
   He said it would cost ``millions'' to perform such a
reorganization.
   Thomas P. Hester, Ameritech vice president and general counsel,
said he believed Greene would grant the waiver.
   ``Similar relief was previously granted by the court to Pacific
Telesis, another of the Bell companies subject to the decree, when
Pacific purchased an interest in a foreign overseas cable
venture,'' Hester said in a statement.
   Tucker said the Ameritech-Bell Atlantic request was less
problematic because the New Zealand company handles traffic jointly
with U.S. carriers and won't be competing with U.S. companies.
   ``U.S. carriers compete among themselves at the U.S. end and the
New Zealand telephone company does not seek authority to enter that
competition,'' Tucker said. ``It only asks authority to continue to
carry its own end of the calls.''
   Ameritech and Bell Atlantic announced June 14 that they and two
New Zealand companies, Fay, Richwhite Holdings Ltd. and Freightways
Holdings Ltd., will purchase New Zealand's state-owned phone
system. Under the plan, the two American companies will reduce
their combined stake to 49.9 percent eventually but will remain as
controlling shareholders.

   The slump in the defense industry hit the
Pentagon's two biggest contractors again Wednesday, with McDonnell
Douglas Corp. announcing plans for major layoffs and General
Dynamics Corp. getting its credit rating cut.
   McDonnell Douglas, the nation's biggest defense contractor,
announced plans to eliminate at least $700 million a year from its
cost structure, including laying off a ``substantial'' number of
its 127,000 workers worldwide.
   ``The hard reality is that we must begin immediately to take
further strong actions to reduce our costs,'' said John F.
McDonnell, chairman and chief executive.
   McDonnell said the cost-cutting plan should be in place by early
August, with immediate steps being taken on overtime, travel, new
hiring, consultants, advertising and support activities.
   ``We have done a lot to downsize the defense cutbacks, including
bringing aerospace work to St. Louis from Long Beach,'' said
company spokesman Jim Reed. ``Despite that, we're going to have to
reduce our size to improve profitability.''
   Officals declined to reveal the number of planned layoffs, which
will be made within the next few months. St. Louis television
stations quoted unnamed company sources as saying the cuts could be
up to 10 percent of McDonnell Douglas' workforce.
   Also on Wednesday, Moody's Investor Services Inc. dropped its
credit ratings two notches for General Dynamics, nation's second
biggest defense contractor.
   Both companies are headquartered in St. Louis.
   Moody's dropped General Dynamics' senior bonds from A2 to Baa1
and the company's subordinated debt from A3 to Baa2 because of the
sagging conditions in the defense industry.
   The ratings put the company's bonds into the bottom category of
investment grade issues.
   General Dynamics makes F-16 fighter jets for the Air Force, M1
tanks for the Army and SSN-688 submarines for the Navy. It also
owns Cessna Aircraft Co. and makes a launch rocket used to put
satellites into orbit.
   Moody's said it ``believes that the manufacturers of defense
platforms (planes, tanks, submarines) will be the most severely
affected by reduced defense spending.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is proposing a 25 percent cut in
the nation's military spending, wich would retire six active duty
Army divisions, 111 Navy ships and 11 Air Force tactical fighter
wings.
   Fred Pastore, associate director of the High Technology Group at
Moody's, said another reason for the credit rating downgrade was
the company's decreased amount of readily available cash.
   General Dynamics spokesman Pete Connolly said the company was
disappointed with the downgrade. But, he said, ``we feel we have
both a strong balance sheet and a strong balance of business which
will sustain us through this period.''
   In New York, industry analyst Paul Nisbet of Prudential-Bache
said the McDonnell Douglas layoffs should not be regarded as a sign
the company, which has a hefty backlog of commercial aircraft
orders, is in trouble.
   ``It would stand to reason with the likelihood of somewhat lower
activity on several of their military programs,'' said Nisbet.
``The company's probably going to have a 20 percent increase in
sales next year, primarily because of increase in (commercial)
aircraft.''
   McDonnell Douglas, which has 10 plants in the United States,
reported sales of $14.58 billion last year compared with $14.4
billion in 1988.
   ``We're projecting them at $16.2 (billion) this year, over $18
billion in 1991 and to $20 (billion) by 1992,'' Nisbet said.
``They've got a wealth of business, with over $50 billion in
backlog.''
   The layoffs represent ``just a shift in business from what
predominantly was a military market in the '80s to a predominantly
commercial market in the '90s,'' Nisbet said. ``They're just having
trouble digesting it.''
   Douglas Aircraft in Long Beach, its production behind schedule
on the C-17 cargo plane, has lost $306 million the past 15 months.
To trim its costs, the company has begun cutting 7,000 jobs, mostly
white collar, at its plants in Long Beach and nearby Torrance,
Calif.
   McDonnell Douglas programs that would be affected by Cheney's
proposed cuts include the Harpoon and Tomahawk missiles and the
F-15 and FA-18 jet fighters. Employees were informed of layoffs on
Wednesday by closed-circuit television.

   Hundreds of environmentalists demonstrated
outside a giant lumber mill Wednesday and 44 were arrested in a
``Redwood Summer'' protest of logging that they say endangers
California's ancient forests.
   About 350 protesters environmentalists and a sprinkling of labor
union activists demonstrated at the coastal Louisiana Pacific mill
as part of a summer of protests planned by the militant Earth
First! environmental coalition.
   About 250 miles to the southeast in the Sierra Nevada range, a
group of loggers was fired on Wednesday by gunmen with
semi-automatic rifles, but no one was hit and authorities didn't
draw a connection with the demonstration on the coast.
   Redwood Summer organizers hope activists from around the country
will converge on northern California's redwood country to protest
logging of ancient trees in an environmentalists' reprise of the
1964 ``Freedom Summer'' civil rights demonstrations in Mississippi.
They demand an end to what they say is excessive clear-cut logging,
and cutting of virgin redwood trees.
   Mainstream environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, have
shunned the plans and disavow the tactics of Earth First! Followers
of the loosely-organized group advocate what they call direct
action to protect the environment, including standing between
loggers and trees.
   The group renounced its old practice of driving spikes into tree
trunks to make them useless as lumber after sawmill workers were
hurt by the spikes.
   Wednesday's demonstration was the first in the redwood country
of northern California's coast range, though a previous Redwood
Summer rally was held in Sacramento.
   The protest outside the plant 275 miles north of San Francisco
was largely peaceful except for name-calling between demonstrators
and plant workers or passing drivers.
   After several hours, a contingent of protesters marched onto
company property and approached officers in what they called ``a
planned act of civil disobedience.''
   Forty-four of them were arrested, most for trespassing, said
Humboldt County Deputy Sheriff Leona Mendenhall. Most were issued
citations and released.
   As the demonstrators gathered at the mill gate and across the
street on coastal sand dunes, police said members of the Greenpeace
environmental group in a small boat tried to approach a Louisiana
Pacific freighter that was being loaded at the company's dock.
   Authorities ordered the boat away, according to a police
dispatcher. No arrests were reported.
   At one point, a dozen Humboldt County sheriff's deputies were
called out to head off a confrontation between the demonstrators
and plant workers, who staged a pro-company rally during their
lunch break. There were heated exchanges of epithets.
   Duane Plant, a lumber worker who carried a sign urging a stop to
``environmental terrorists,'' said Louisiana Pacific's logging
practices were proper.
   ``They scare me,'' Plant said of the radical environmentalists.
``I am afraid of getting hurt. I am afraid of my kids getting hurt.
I can't believe they're not violent.''
   Demonstrator David Solnit, 26, a carpenter from San Francisco,
said logging practices must be changed.
   ``We've got to save what's left of the forests,'' Solnit said.
``They (Louisiana Pacific officials) are acting like outlaws and we
need to take direct action.''
   In an apparently unrelated incident in the Sierra County, two or
three people with semi-automatic rifles fired up to 300 rounds at a
group of loggers Wednesday, said sheriff's dispatcher Fred Burns.
Nobody was hurt, and two people were arrested, Burns said, adding
that it appeared the gunmen were trying to scare the loggers rather
than injure them.
   ``I think with 300 rounds they could have hit someone if they
wanted to,'' Burns said. ``But that's a presumption.''
   Fears of violence escalated in recent weeks after a bomb went
off in a car carrying Earth First! leaders Judy Bari and Darryl
Cherney. Earth First! members say the two were targets of a bomber,
but police have booked Bari and Cherney on investigation of
illegally transporting explosives.
   On Tuesday, more than 100 Earth First! followers camped in the
woods near remote Honeydew, a two-hour drive south, and spent most
of the day huddled in non-violence training sessions.

<HEAD>Pathe's Buyout of MGM-UA Appears Shaky; Financing Talks Continue</HEAD>

   Pathe Communications Corp.
continues to negotiate financing for its $1.2 billion offer for
MGM-UA Communications Co., but seems unlikely to complete the deal
by a Saturday deadline.
   MGM-UA officials were discussing extending the deadline for the
$20-a-share tender offer, spokesman Scott Tagliarino said
Wednesday. He noted that Pathe so far has fulfilled its obligations
to MGM-UA, including delivering $200 million in down payments.
   Pathe, headed by Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti, has
extended its offer several times past its original close date of
April 30.
   Saturday is the latest possible deadline under the agreement
between Parretti and MGM-UA's controlling shareholder, Kirk
Kerkorian. Further extensions would require an all-new agreement,
Tagliarino said.
   Pathe's problems are with its chief backer, Time Warner Inc.,
which has agreed to loan Pathe $650 million of the purchase price.
   Time Warner has insisted that the remaining $600 million must
not come from borrowed funds and that Pathe put up $450 million of
that equity itself.
   So far, Parretti's proposed patchwork of loans through European
affiliates of Pathe has failed to meet Time Warner's criteria.
Attorneys for both companies continued to negotiate Wednesday.
   Even Pathe's $200 million in down payments were made with
borrowed funds, Time Warner spokeswoman Marilyn Harris said.
   ``The $200 million is not equity, it's a loan,'' Ms. Harris said.
   According to its agreement with Pathe, MGM-UA could pocket the
$200 million if the deal falls apart in return for issuing 10
million new shares of common stock to Parretti. Pathe also has
guaranteed MGM-UA $75 million in fees for distributing Pathe films.
   In exchange for providing financing, Time Warner would get a
lien on the United Artists movie library, distribution rights to
that library, and distribution rights to future Pathe and MGM-UA
releases.
   Pathe spokesman Craig Parsons said discussions with Time Warner
include whether the $200 million down payment is equity. An even
bigger issue is a proposed $368 million loan from Parretti's
Luxembourg-based holding company, Comfinance S.A., which in turn
was to raise the money from a variety of asset sales and borrowings.
   Pathe plans to repay Comfinance in shares of stock, thereby
converting the loan to equity, Parsons said.
   Time Warner also is concerned whether the loans and asset sales
to finance the Comfinance loan will materialize as billed.
   For example, in a Security and Exchange Commission filing last
week, Pathe said an affiliate would sell a 27 percent stake in a
Milan bank for $52.5 million to Centro Nord Commissionaria, a
financial company. However, The Financial Times, a British
newspaper, quoted Centro Nord's president as saying no such deal
had been agreed upon.
   Meanwhile Wednesday, Parretti aides said he will battle a French
decision to block his efforts to acquire all of Pathe Cinema, a
major French movie and TV producer with a 400-film library and a
chain of about 400 theaters. Pathe Cinema is unrelated to Pathe
Communications.
   Parretti asked the European Community Commission in Brussels to
overturn French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy's decision to
block the purchase of Pathe Cinema. He said the decision was
arbitrary and an abuse of power.
   Parretti already owns 48 percent of Pathe Cinema.

   A Delaware court has ruled that the Royal
Dutch-Shell Group violated disclosure rules in its $5.7 billion
buyout of minority shareholders in the former Shell Oil Co. five
years ago.
   The Court of Chancery in New Castle County, Delaware, ruled in
favor of a group of minority shareholders, who had sued over the
terms of the buyout.
   Tuesday's ruling did not determine how much the former owners of
15 million shares of Shell stock should be awarded, said Houston
attorney Ken McNeil, who represented the plaintiffs.
   The judge asked both sides to submit recommendations on the
award but did not set a date for a hearing on the matter.
   The violation occurred ``because the defendant failed to
disclose the existence of oil and gas reserves having a value of
approximately $1 billion,'' the court ruling said.
   The class action lawsuit was filed by the former Shell minority
shareholders against Shell Petroleum Inc., the Royal Dutch-Shell
subsidiary that bought out Shell Oil's minority shareholders in
June 1985.
   The Anglo-Dutch oil giant had owned 69.4 percent of Shell Oil.
It initially offered $55 a share for the remainder, raised the bid
to $58 and finally agreed to pay an extra $2 a share to settle a
lawsuit by some minority shareholders.
   The Delaware trial was limited to the issue of whether adequate
disclosure was made in materials sent to the former Shell
stockholders advising them of their option to accept the Royal
Dutch-Shell offer or seek an appraisal of the fair value of their
shares, McNeil said.
   H.R. Hutchins, a spokesman for Houston-based Shell, said the
company was disappointed with the court's decision.
   ``The court based it's decision on an inadvertent error which
left out about 8 percent of the discounted future net cash flow
from estimated oil and gas reserves,'' Hutchins said.
   ``The discounted cash flow analysis is `soft' data because it is
based on numerous assumptions and estimates. In view of the
voluminous information that was furnished to the shareholders, we
believe they could readily have made an informed decision with
respect to the 1985 merger proposal.''
   In a separate proceeding, the same Delaware court is determining
the appraisal value of the Shell Oil stock for former owners of 1
million shares, who rejected the $60-a-share offer. These former
owners have claimed the shares were worth up to $110 each.

   Two ancient Greek coins fetching more than a
half million dollars each were among the record breakers Tuesday at
an auction of the highly touted coin and antique collections of the
one-time billionaire Hunt brothers.
   The auction also saw the rare ``Ides of March'' coin, struck by
Brutus to commemorate the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44
B.C., sell for $99,000.
   The items sold Tuesday _ the first in a series of Hunt auctions
_ brought a total of just over $20 million, far more than the
presale estimate of $12 million.
   A Greek vase painted with a battle scene sold for a record $1.76
million.
   The 18-inch vase, circa 510 B.C., is black with red figures
painted on it depicting the death of Kyknos in battle with
Hercules. It was reconstructed from a fragment signed by
Euphronius, one of the most important ancient Greek artists, said
Sotheby's David Redden, an expert in the field.
   The buyer was identified only as a European dealer.
   Two silver Greek coins became the most expensive ever sold at
auction.
   The Decadrachm of Agrigentum, dating from 410 B.C., sold for
$572,000, followed by another decadrachm, circa 465 B.C., for
$528,000.
   The second coin had held the previous auction record, having
fetched $272,000 in 1974.
   All prices include the auction house's 10 percent commission.
   The first coin sold Tuesday is one of eight known specimens of
its kind, Sotheby's said. It shows an eagle and four horses being
driven by sun god Helios on one side and two eagles perched over a
dead hare on the other.
   The other has the head of the goddess Athena on one side and an
owl on the other.
   Nelson Bunker and William Herbert Hunt, heirs to an oil fortune,
lost more than $1.5 billion speculating in the silver market a
decade ago.
   The Dallas businessmen emerged from bankruptcy court protection
earlier this year under a reorganization plan that called for them
to sell off their antique collections and some personal possessions.
   The New York auction has attracted collectors from around the
world and was one of several planned in the coming year involving
the Hunt estates.
   R. Carter Pate, trustee in charge of liquidating Nelson Bunker
Hunt's estate, said before Tuesday's auction that he expected all
of the asset sales to raise between $20 and $25 million.
   Most of the money will go to the Internal Revenue Service, the
largest creditor in the brothers' bankruptcy cases.
   This week's sale likely will be the most spectacular of the
auctions because of the strength of the collection, he said.
