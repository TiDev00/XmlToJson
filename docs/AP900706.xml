   A heroic Soviet helicopter pilot who developed
leukemia after helping entomb the burning Chernobyl nuclear reactor
did not die in vain, his widow said at a memorial service Thursday.
   Galina Grischenko spoke of the treatment her husband, Anatoly
Grischenko, received at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center,
where he died Monday at age 53.
   ``I think that this example of good cooperation will help all
others who have suffered in the Chernobyl disaster,'' Mrs.
Grischenko said, speaking through an interpreter.
   About 50 hospital officials, friends of Mrs. Grischenko and
well-wishers attended the service at a funeral home.
   Grischenko was among the pilots who flew helicopters over the
damaged, highly radioactive Chernobyl nuclear plant for three days
after the 1986 disaster, dropping huge loads of sand and wet cement
to encase the burning reactor.
   He and several others in the operation were designated heroes of
the Soviet Union, that country's highest honor.
   Grishchenko suffered acute radiation sickness after the disaster
and was found to have leukemia last year. Because the only bone
marrow transplant center in the Soviet Union could not treat him,
he was flown to Seattle on April 11. A bone marrow transplant was
performed at the cancer center later that month.
   Doctors reported encouraging progress after the transplant, but
Grishchenko's condition worsened when a months-old lung infection
flared up and he had to undergo surgery June 12. He was placed on a
respirator June 15, and died Monday night.
   ``The term `hero' is well applied to him,'' Dr. Richard
Vanderjagt said at the memorial service.
   ``It is sometimes used loosely but certainly not with regards to
him,'' said Vanderjagt. ``I really do feel that Anatoly was a great
hero.''
   Dr. John Hansen, an associate director of the Hutchinson center,
said Grishchenko has helped focus renewed attention on Chernobyl.
   ``There is a lot to be done about the Chernobyl disaster,''
Hansen said. ``And of course, there is a lot to be done about world
peace.''
   Grishchenko's body was to be flown back to Moscow this weekend,
accompanied by Mrs. Grishchenko and the pilot's Soviet physician,
Dr. Eugenia Margulis.

   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians from Yugoslavia
staged a protest Thursday against the forced dissolution of the
government in their region of the country, calling it a prelude to
civil war.
   The protesters, gathered in front of the United Nations, said
authorities in Yugoslavia's largest republic, Serbia _ which
controls their region of Kosovo _ had arrested the leaders of the
ethnic Albanian democracy movement.
   About 500 demonstrators, who temporarily blocked traffic on
First Avenue, chanted ``USA!'' and ``Democracy!''
   Some held up the red flag of their region, whose provincial
assembly on Monday declared it would secede from Serbia.
   The demonstration followed the suspension Thursday by Serbian
authorities of all elected and other officials in Kosovo's local
government.
   Several leading ethnic Albanian officials and journalists were
removed from their jobs at Kosovo's radio, television and the
Albanian-language Rilindia publishing house, which publishes a
daily newspaper.
   The decision to dissolve Kosovo's legislature and government was
approved unanimously by all three chambers of Serbia's parliament.
It came in the wake of a declaration Monday by 114 ethnic Albanian
deputies in Kosovo's provincial assembly to secede from Serbia,
according to television reports in the Serbian capital of Belgrade.
   One of the protesters, Zaide Gjonbalaj, 15, lived in Kosovo
until last year.
   ``A lot of people got killed, they (the Serbs) just hate our
guts and think we're animals. It's worse than war,'' said
Gjonbalaj, who lives in the borough of Brooklyn.
   She said she remembered army troops last year in the capital
city of Pristina throwing tear gas at school children, including
her.
   ``There will for sure be a civil war,'' said Shefcet Karacica,
of the borough of the Bronx. ``They're beating children in front of
their mothers and fathers and they're sending in troops.''
   Din Derti, vice chairman of the Albanian-American Civic League,
a Washington-based human rights group, said relatives reported that
Yugoslavian police were beating citizens and making mass arrests.
   An Albanian-language, Manhattan-based radio station, the Voice
of Freedom, was interviewing writer Rexhep Qosja from his home in
Pristina on Thursday when his telephone line suddenly went dead.
   The radio station later contacted the writer's wife and learned
he had been arrested.

   Investigators on Thursday focused on
the charge that propelled an errant rocket into a crowd watching
the town's July Fourth fireworks display, injuring 18 people.
   The six-inch rocket went off course, skidded hundreds of feet
and showered the tightly packed gathering of about 10,000 people
with burning debris after the rack that held it tipped over
Wednesday night, authorities said.
   ``It was like a cannon shot into the crowd,'' Fire Chief Bernard
Lach said. ``There was a big white flash and then a lot of
commotion.''
   Four people, including a 3-year-old boy, were hospitalized with
burns. All were listed Thursday in stable condition. The others
suffered minor injuries, and were treated at a hospital and
released.
   ``All I can gather is the rack blew up and tipped over on its
side,'' said Ken Lupoli, who set up the fireworks display.
   David Paige, who heads the state Department of Public Safety's
Division of Fire and Building Safety, said, ``The damage to the
rack and the condition of the rack causes us to focus on the lift
charge. We're concentrating on what happened to make the rack
dislodge.''
   The lift charge is made up of black powder that is placed
beneath the rocket. It propels the rocket through a tube into the
air, Paige said.
   The display _ which also marked the town's 250th anniversary _
was held on a baseball field. The fireworks racks were set up in
left-center field, and people sitting on blankets and lawn chairs
in far right field were hit by the rocket.
   ``It appears everything met state regulations, but we're still
investigating,'' Paige said.
   The accident occurred during the finale of a 45-minute display.
   People were about 300 feet from the launch site, Lach said.
State regulations require that they be at least 200 feet away.
   Lupoli, a subcontractor who uses fireworks supplied by Vitale
Fireworks Display Co. Inc. of New Castle, Pa., had put on similar
displays in Torrington for several years and had never had any
problems, city Fire Marshal Ron Corey said.

   A fire Thursday damaged part of Gilley's,
the landmark country-western bar shut down more than a year ago
after a legal dispute.
   Fire officials were investigating the cause of the blaze in this
Houston suburb, which damaged parts of the 70,000-square-foot
building, said Fire Chief Jay Boyner. A damage estimate was not
immediately available.
   Several firefighters were treated at the scene for heat
exhaustion, and one suffered a minor cut and was taken to a
hospital for treatment, authorities said.
   Gilley's, which was featured in the movie ``Urban Cowboy,'' was
closed more than a year ago following a legal dispute between
country singer Mickey Gilley and former partner Sherwood Cryer.

   ``Piece of Cake,'' the PBS miniseries on
``Masterpiece Theater'' for the next six Sunday nights, is the
compellingly watchable tale of a RAF fighter squadron during the
first year of World War II.
   That's not to say the London Weekend Television production
doesn't have its flaws. But they're not significant enough to
hamper an American audience's enjoyment of a fine cast, great
aerial photography and a good story.
   ``Piece of Cake'' _ RAF slang for a task as pleasant as it is
easy _ opens in 1939, when Germany invaded Poland, Great Britain
declared war on Germany and nobody did anything in particular.
   It was sitzkrieg, or ``phony war,'' and Germany consolidated its
gains on the Continent before pushing the Allies out of France. It
was more than a year before Hitler launched the air war that became
known as the Battle of Britain.
   So we have time to learn about the gallant lads of Hornet
Squadron before they defend their homeland from the Luftwaffe. Days
after war is declared, their squadron leader dies in a four-foot
tumble from his cockpit.
   Then, in their first combat, they're scrambled up against a
flight of incoming planes and shoot down a fighter.
   Their donnish and impious intelligence officer, ``Skull''
Skelton _ wonderfully played by Richard Hope, the upmarket mobster
of ``Bellman and True'' _ notes an unusual circumstance:
   There isn't a German fighter base within 400 miles. They've
splashed one of their own.
   Things seem to improve a bit with the arrival of Squadron Leader
Rex Ramsey (Tim Woodward), a very wealthy, very public school, very
bullying, upper-class nob who runs the squadron like his private
gentlemen's flying club.
   He transfers the squadron to France, installs it in a chateau
with an excellent wine cellar and concentrates on teaching its
members how to fly in tight formations _ the tactical air doctrine
of the day.
   The British didn't know the doctrine was outmoded until the
German pilots proved it by whipping them.
   The squadron leader's popularity plummets when the other pilots
realize his insistence on formation flying is getting them killed.
   Rex's main antagonist is Flying Officer Chris Hart (Boyd
Gaines), an American veteran of the Spanish Civil War who joined
the RAF to fight fascism. His American notions of equality, and his
air combat experience with the Nazis, immediately put him into
conflict with Rex.
   Another memorable character is the utterly nasty ``Moggy''
Cattermole (Neil Dudgeon), a dashing pilot and cruel, philandering
bully who's got to be seen to be appreciated.
   ``I've lost my hands!'' radios a pilot after being raked by
enemy fire.
   ``That was careless of you, old chap,'' replies Moggy.
   You'll be rooting for the Luftwaffe.
   No fighting force in history deserved its apotheosis as much as
the Royal Air Force for its heroic defense of Britain in World War
II, and ``Piece of Cake'' took its share of flak from British
audiences.
   The British didn't like how the miniseries violated the image of
gallant chaps sitting about with lashings of tea and cakes, then
winging their battered kites up to have a go at bashing the filthy
Jerries.
   ``Piece of Cake'' also took heat from military historians for
using the Spitfire fighter plane.
   The Spitfire, they noted, was not operational in significant
numbers until mid-1940. It was the doughty Hawker Hurricane fighter
that bore the brunt of the fighting until then.
   Producer Andrew Holmes explained the lapse: ``There are, sadly,
only two Hurrricanes flying today in the world and they hardly form
a squadron. But fortunately, there are a dozen or so Spitfires.''
   It's a forgivable lapse, since the gull-winged Spitfire is one
of the prettiest warplanes ever to take to the skies.
   When a half-dozen Spits claw up into the air, it approaches
poetry, and director Ian Toynton's aerial unit captures the cruel,
balletic beauty of 300-mph dogfights.
   ``Piece of Cake'' is a treat.

<HEAD>Court Says Car Dealer Must Give Car To Winner Of 1988 Hole-In-One
Contest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A car dealer must make good on an offer of
a $15,000 car to the winner of a hole-in-one contest, a state
appeals court has ruled.
   Rex P. Callicott thought he won the car at the 15th annual New
York Institute of Food Technologists Inc. annual golf and tennis
outing on June 6, 1988.
   The institute had an agreement with Garfield Chrysler-Plymouth
Inc. to sponsor the event, and sent out thousands of fliers
announcing ``Hole-in-one _ Car,'' according to court papers.
   A new Chrysler Lebaron, with a $15,560 sticker price, was
stationed on the ninth hole of the Edgewood Country Club that day.
   Callicott was given the keys to the car at that evening's awards
banquet, but the dealer refused to give him title to the car,
claiming the tee-off point on the hole was 12 yards less than the
distance marked on the course scorecard.
   A trial court, however, said the assertion that the tee markers
were too close was unsubstantiated, and the appellate division of
state Superior Court agreed Thursday.

   Police in riot gear arrested about 50 people at a
demonstration Thursday by Haitian-Americans at a shopping center
where last week a Haitian immigrant was allegedly beaten by
Hispanic employees.
   The incident occurred at the Biscayne Plaza Shopping Center when
police began trying to disperse the crowd, which swelled from about
50 to 100 demonstrators, said Officer George Law.
   About 160 officers _ outfitted with nightsticks, shields and
helmets with face guards _ were called to the scene north of
downtown near Little Haiti, police said.
   ``We told them to disperse and they failed to, so we moved in,''
said police spokesman Roberto Navarro. ``A community can't hold
someone hostage like that.''
   Four of those arrested were in stable condition late Thursday at
Jackson Memorial Hospital after treatment for minor facial cuts,
scrapes and bruises, said hospital spokesman Don Del Vecchio.
   Three were being held in the hospital's prison ward; a fourth
was undergoing treatment in the emergency room.
   The rest of those arrested were taken to the Dade County Jail on
charges including assault, resisting arrest, disorderly conduct and
failure to disperse.
   The protests in front of the Rapid Transit Factory Outlet store
began June 29 after a dispute between the store owner and a
Haitian-American customer over alterations for a pair of pants. The
customer, Abner Alezi, claimed he was beaten.
   Alezi, 44, and several others were later arrested for
trespassing when they returned to the store to complain.
   When store owner Luis Reyes tried to open the store on Saturday,
more than 1,000 Haitians turned out in a peaceful protest. The
store then remained closed until Thursday.
   Police Chief Perry Anderson said his department had tried to
mediate the dispute.
   ``We are being extremely tolerant,'' Anderson said. ``There have
been rocks and bottles thrown. For two days the owner of the store
has been held hostage. We have been very, very tolerant.''
   At least 40 officers remained at the store late Thursday.
   Reyes said he planned to reopen his store Friday.
   ``We are here to do business and to set a principle that not us,
not any merchant and not the city of Miami Police Department will
be intimidated by something like this,'' said Reyes, a 65-year-old
Cuban-American. ``The violence will not take over.''
   The fracas left protesters' shoes, coats and hats strewn across
the rainy parking lot.
   The confrontation at the shopping center followed tension
between blacks and Hispanics over the recent visit of South African
anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela.
   Demonstrators had complained about the alleged beating at the
store and the snub of Mandela by Cuban-American leaders after the
African National Congress leader refused to disavow his support of
Cuban President Fidel Castro.
   But they also cited what they said was preferential treatment
given to Cuban immigrants over Haitians, contending that Cubans are
given freedom while Haitians are detained or sent home.

<TEXT>
   When the streets of Pakistan's largest
city explode in gunfire, Abdul Sattar Edhi rushes out into the
urban battlefield.
   With the siren on his beatup mini-van blaring, he weaves through
the streets on a mission of mercy, picking up the the dead, the
dying and the wounded.
   A resurgence of ethnic and political violence has claimed more
than 400 lives in Karachi and Hyderabad, 150 miles to the north, in
the past month.
   ``When I go out on the streets of Karachi, I feel very sad,''
Edhi said of the bloodshed, which has transformed this once
tranquil city on the sun-baked Arabian Sea into camps of heavily
armed gangs.
   Edhi, 62, operates the Edhi Welfare Foundation, a $5 million a
year charity he founded 30 years ago using a battered pickup truck
as a one-man free ambulance service.
   Steadily he built it into one of the subcontinent's biggest and
best-organized social service networks, boasting a fleet of 615
ambulances, a rescue helicopter, dozens of blood banks and shelters
for mental patients, heroin addicts, battered wives, orphans,
runaways and anyone else his staff finds wandering without help or
hope.
   ``I was born a Moslem, but true religion is the service of
humanity,'' said Edhi, a stalky man with a flowing white beard and
a gruff voice. ``I'm just one man. I just want to help people.''
   He is called saint, an angel of mercy, and his deeds have earned
him the nickname ``Father Teresa,'' the counterpart of the tiny
Roman Catholic nun who has spent her life working with the
destitute and dying in the slums of Calcutta, India.
   His telephone rings at all hours. He is ready for any emergency,
always carrying a packed bag with a small satchel that contains a
change of clothes _ gray baggy pants and a matching shirt _ rubber
sandals, glasses, a toothbrush and a near-toothless comb.
   Although his work reaches every part of Pakistan, the heart of
his operation is Karachi, a city crowded with 9 million people,
mostly poor and illiterate.
   Born in the western Indian state of Gujarat, Edhi immigrated to
Pakistan during the 1947 partition that ended British colonial rule
of the subcontinent. And in many ways, Edhi's simple lifestyle
mirrors Mohandas K. Gandhi, the Mahatma or ``great soul'' who led
that freedom struggle.
   Edhi and his wife, Bilquis, live in a stark room sandwiched
between an office and a narrow room with only a wooden table where
the bodies of Karachi's unwanted and unclaimed are laid out for
burial.
   Edhi's bed is a wooden plank resting on a steel frame. His wife
has a mattress, her only concession to comfort.
   Mrs. Edhi, mother of four children, looks around the room at the
two-burner hot plate, a wooden table and a cupbord crammed with
their possessions. ``This is my paradise,'' she said.
   The walls outside the dilapidated building are lined with fuzzy
photographs resembling wanted posters, pictures of beggars who died
in the alleyways around town.
   ``There are so many people lost and alone in this world,'' he
sighed. ``They die alone and no one cares. So we take their
pictures and hope that maybe somebody will know them.''
   Edhi has buried a small city over the past three decades,
washing more than 60,000 unidentified bodies and wrapping them in
traditional white shrouds.
   In less than three hours, three bodies arrived for burial. He
had already washed and prepared two earlier in the day. ``Where
else would they go?'' he asked.
   While Edhi cares for the dead, his wife looks after the living,
setting up adoptions.
   ``I have seen so many children die. They were thrown in garbage
cans, in gutters. So I thought I'll give them to the people who
want them,'' she said.
   She and her husband have set up homes for battered wives and
centers to treat the city's 1 million heroin addicts. They also
established a home for the handicapped and a girls' orphanage in
two donated mansions in Karachi's affluent Clifton area, where
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto maintains a home.
   ``He is helping everyone,'' said Farhad Naz, a social worker in
Karachi. ``Without him these women would have nowhere to go.''
   In this desperately poor and troubled country, Edhi's work fills
the widening gap created by the government's inability or
unwillingness. He does it solely with private donations.
   ``When my mother died, I promised that as long as God gave me
energy, I would work to help the poor and the sick,'' said Edhi,
who has a sixth-grade education.
   ``I was not educated so when I started my efforts were small,
simple and practical. But the public like it and now they give me
money. My work is still simple, but it's no longer small.''

   Five young adults exploring a storm
drain were found alive after being washed away by runoff from a
thunderstorm Thursday night, authorities said.
   The five, who were among eight people 18 to 25 years old who
were exploring the drain, were located about 350 yards inside the
drain about 11:30 p.m., said Fire Department spokesman Brad Stewart.
   ``They're all alive,'' Stewart said.
   One of the eight, John Shaffer of Charleston, said he and two
friends were able to escape the drain.
   ``We got washed down the tube,'' said Shaffer, 21. ``We got a
quarter of the way down and the water got so high. We tried to get
out and we got washed out.
   ``We were just exploring there,'' he said. ``It wasn't raining
when we went in, but then the water came in.''
   The storm dumped up to 1{ inches of rain in a two-hour period in
the area, the National Weather Service said.

   In 1940, 17-year-old Lukas Foss packed his
bags and headed for the Berkshires, eager to check out a new school
that offered fledgling musicians a chance to get their hands on a
real orchestra.
   ``Everybody knew about it,'' recalls the composer, one of a
string of distinguished alumni returning this summer to celebrate
the 50th anniversary of the Boston Symphony Orchestra's training
school.
   ``We very rarely got a chance to conduct an orchestra. At
Tanglewood you would. It was something that everybody knew and
everybody wanted right from the start,'' he said.
   That 1940 season at the Tanglewood Music Center founded by the
great BSO director Serge Koussevitzky glittered with the names of
20th-century music: Foss and Leonard Bernstein as students,
composers Aaron Copland and Paul Hindemith among the teachers.
   For Foss, who has been composer-in-residence at Tanglewood for
two years, there's an element of nostalgia to this year's
celebration.
   ``I don't think I ever thought as a student that I would be back
as the Paul Hindemith and conducting the BSO. This is very
special,'' he said.
   The 1990 season is the last of four in a celebration of
Tanglewood's founding. This year's observance begins with a gala
concert Friday night featuring the premiere of an overture
``Celebration,'' written by Foss for the occasion.
   Seiji Ozawa, who studied at the center in 1960, will lead the
BSO in a program of Stravinsky, Verdi and Puccini.
   Other former students scheduled to appear this summer include
Bernstein, Charles Dutoit, conductor of the Montreal Symphony
Orchestra, and Zubin Mehta, conductor of the New York Philharmonic.
   Some things have changed in 50 years, Foss said.
   ``In those days it was very different because the teacher really
launched your life. They didn't call it a career either, they
called it your life, your work. Nowadays they call it your career
and your manager does all that,'' Foss said.
   Today's students ``enroll here very often or not to do what they
call networking,'' Foss said. ``The students are much older now,
there are no 17-year-olds.''
   The shift has its good and bad sides, said Foss. Career-driven
musicians are motivated to work hard, but if they come for career
purposes instead of wanting to learn something, that's not so good,
he said.
   Recalling his days at Tanglewood, Foss said he worried
Koussevitzky by signing up for classes under the Russian-born
conductor and Hindemith. But when Koussevitzky suggested Foss take
a lighter load, the teen-ager asked for an audition to show he
could handle it.
   ``After the audition, he said, `If you want, you will have.' He
was a wonderful, father-like figure to me,'' Foss said.
   Foss said he proved a difficult pupil.
   ``Hindemith once wrote to Koussevitzky and said he will not
teach me again because, `Lukas wants to know but he doesn't want to
follow.' Koussevitzky said, `That's wonderful,''' Foss recalled.
   This week, an army of lawn mowers rolled over the wide, sloping
lawns of the Tanglewood estate, readying the green expanses for the
onslaught of the thousands of people who descend each weekend from
New York and Massachusetts to hear the BSO and celebrity guests.
   The history of Tanglewood, a country estate in the Berkshire
hills town of Lenox, dates back to 1937, when the BSO first began
giving its popular weekend concerts. The festivals continue, this
weekend featuring violinist Itzhak Perlman.
   Concert-goers pay $16 to $58 for tickets to the 4,000-seat
Tanglewood Shed, a semi-open structure, or $10 to sit on the vast
lawns in front of the Shed.
   Across the lawns is the world of the music center where a group
of 100 or so Tanglewood Fellows meet in July and by the end of
summer have created an orchestra of their own. At the end of this
summer, the orchestra will tour Europe under Bernstein's direction.
   ``It's a fun place to be,'' Foss said. ``It's not like some
drudging kind of concert work, but of course the more talented the
person is, the harder he works.
   ``Mainly, you see, what Tanglewood has, it has very wonderful
people in charge. It has the right people leading it, the right
people teaching and that's really the secret of its success.''

   Despite working three jobs, a
28-year-old Albanian asylum-seeker says he ``just can't make a
living'' in his Communist homeland and wants to go anywhere that
offers the promise of a better life.
   He is one of the nearly 600 Albanians who have sought refuge in
foreign embassies in Tirana this week in a desperate bid to flee
the country.
   The 28-year-old, interviewed Thursday by telephone by Hungarian
state radio, is holed up with 11 other Albanians in the Hungarian
embassy _ one of a dozen foreign embassies in Tirana where
Albanians have sought asylum.
   ``I came here because I just can't make a living,'' he said. ``I
am 28, I have a wife and two children. I work as a bricklayer, as a
driver and as a lathe operator,'' the man said, speaking in his
native Albanian. His comments were translated into Hungarian.
   It was not clear from the interview whether his family had fled
with him to the embassy. He did not explain why he chose to seek
refuge in the Hungarian embassy.
   ``I make 400 leks (about $57 dollars a month),'' said the
asylum-seeker, who was not identified by name.
   He said rent and electricty cost more than 50 leks a month, a
2.2 pounds of bread cost four leks, a quart of milk three leks, and
a kilogram of sugar eight leks.
   ``Everything is very expensive here, or rather we earn very
little,'' he told the radio. ``It is impossible to make a decent
living.''
   With the fall of Communist leaders in Hungary and most other
Eastern European countries, Albania remains the last bastion of
orthodox Communism in Europe. Its leaders have begun to implement
some cautious reforms, such as allowing citizens to apply for
passports to travel abroad.
   But the 28-year-old asylum-seeker said that even if he were
granted a passport under the new regulations, he doesn't have
enough money to pay for a trip abroad.
   ``Even if they would now give me a passport, I do not have the
money for plane fare, but I promise to work very hard and pay it
all back,'' he said.
   The Albanian told Hungarian radio that he would like to go to
Italy, West Germany or the United States. ``Anywhere, just away
from here.''

<HEAD>Congress Nearing Completion of Bill to Require Double Hulls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House and Senate negotiators are a few pen
strokes from requiring double hulls on oil tankers, but industry
officials say preventing oil spills carries a high price tag _ and
some risk.
   With shipyards already receiving orders to build an extra layer
of steel around the outside of oil tankers, Congress moves into the
final stages of negotiations next week over provisions of a major
oil spill bill that has been 15 years in the making.
   Already set are key provisions to increase penalties for
shippers found liable for spills and to establish Coast Guard oil
spill response centers along U.S. coasts. The bill also establishes
a $1 billion cleanup fund through a five-cent tax on each barrel of
oil produced in or imported to the United States.
   Environmentalists hail the double-hull requirement as an
environmental safety net capable of preventing some of the major
oil spills that have soiled coasts from Alaska to Rhode Island.
   ``Double hulls work,'' said Clifton Curtis, an ocean specialist
with the environmental group Friends of the Earth. ``The evidence
shows that they do add an important additional protection against
spills occurring and they reduce the amount of oil that is
released.''
   Oil interests, while resigned to a law requiring double hulls,
warn that it comes with a price tag: $30 million per ship _ a cost
increase that will likely trickle down to consumers' wallets.
   Concessions won from Congress to allow time to build
double-hulled ships are an attempt to keep those costs under
control.
   ``We've been pointing out the cost figures since the issue first
emerged,'' said Bill Taylor of the American Petroleum Institute, a
Washington-based industry group. ``Whatever adjustments that have
been made from the original legislative proposals reflect the
tremendous costs involved.''
   Although details remain to be worked out, sources said the final
bill will require that new tankers and oceangoing barges weighing
over 5,000 gross tons have double hulls, which consist of a second
layer of steel and an air space between the sea and the cargo.
   Older vessels would have to be either phased out of operation or
refitted with second hulls.
   ``At this point the double hull requirement is a foregone
conclusion,'' said a House staff aide who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Refitting the 153 U.S.-flagged tankers with double hulls would
cost nearly $4.6 billion, or $30 million each, Taylor said. The
same amount would be added on to the cost of building new tankers,
meaning a 15 percent cost increase.
   The roughly 900 foreign-flagged tankers that call in U.S. ports
would cost $20 million apiece to refit at lower-cost foreign
shipyards, Taylor said.
   In addition to the added cost, shipping interests contend it is
uncertain whether double hulls work.
   The National Academy of Sciences is working on a study expected
to detail some of the weaknesses of double hulls. The Senate wants
to give the secretary of transportation authority to review that
study along with other data to see if alternatives to double hulls
would work as well or better.
   Ernie Corrado, president of the American Institute of Merchant
Marine Shipping, said preliminary results of the study show that
gases trapped between the hull walls could cause an explosion and a
breach in the outer wall could allow water in the cavity between
the hulls, capsizing the vessel.
   ``It's not simply a question of economics, it's a question of
safety,'' said Joe Farrell, president of the American Waterways
Operators, a trade association representing coastal shippers,
including oil barge haulers.
   The oil spill legislation has been debated in Congress for 15
years, but efforts to pass it out were stepped up after the Exxon
Valdez spill of March 24, 1989. The super tanker ran aground on
Bligh Reef in Alaska, spilling 11 million gallons of crude oil into
Prince William Sound.

<TEXT>
   Main Street is quiet except for a few
children riding their bikes, dodging the many holes and bumps their
town can't afford to fix.
   For two years, this community of 1,100 has been on the verge of
becoming the first in North Dakota history to declare bankruptcy.
Outside town, on the edge of the scenic Badlands, an oil well
reminds residents of better days as well as Belfield's uncertain
future.
   ``It's pretty much at a standstill,'' said George Kessel, 77,
who was born and raised here. ``Everybody's hanging on, waiting for
things to get better.''
   Oilfield worker Driggers ``Bob'' Tyndall has been in town for
just three weeks, but he's been reading and hearing about
Belfield's prosperous past and troubled present.
   ``When it was up, it was booming, it was alive,'' Tyndall said.
``But look at it now _ it's dead.''
   In the late 1970s, Belfield's future looked as promising as the
state's oil industry. Oil workers poured into the unprepared town,
forcing officials to sell $2.1 million worth of bonds in the early
1980s to pay for water, sewers and housing. Its population swelled
by almost 300.
   But by 1986, oil prices had dropped and Belfield was stuck with
more than $1 million in unpaid property taxes owed by unemployed
workers who left.
   City officials ruled out new taxes for people already
complaining of skyrocketing costs. Instead, they hoped to work out
deals with the bondholders that would pay off part of the debt or
set up a payment plan.
   Today, the town's debt totals almost $1.9 million, and no deals
are in sight.
   ``We were hoping we could avoid bankruptcy, but as time is going
by and no clear-cut decisions are made ... we're going back to the
idea that bankruptcy is going to happen,'' said former Mayor Phil
Dolyniuk, who stepped down in April.
   ``It's going to be a battle. The next four years are going to be
very difficult.''
   Attorney Albert Hardy told bondholders in a February letter that
city services such as water, sewer and streets were curtailed ``to
the point where the health and well-being of the people remaining
in Belfield may be at risk.''
   Dolyniuk said Thursday that he doesn't expect any health
problems, although he noted that Belfield's landfill is getting
full and the town may have problems paying to get its waste shipped
elsewhere.
   The number of full-time municipal workers has declined from
seven in 1984 to four today, and the town police bought a used car
last time they needed one. The town has lost a grocery store and a
car dealership, although it has gained a service station and a
Dairy Queen.
   Residents have formed a group called the Community Development
Corporation to give the town a moral and financial lift.
   The group and others helped raise money to repair a swimming
pool that had been closed for years. It also put up signs along
U.S. 85 to attract travelers and turn a small conservation dam
nearby into a recreation center.
   A new 24-page brochure was written to tell business prospects
about Belfield's history, recreation and climate.
   Some of the efforts seem to be paying off.
   Arcus Environmental Inc. last month announced plans to hire 50
people for a plant that turns hazardous waste into fuel. Belfield
officials are wooing a dentist so people won't have to drive 20
miles to Dickinson to get their teeth fixed.
   And Mayor Susan Heck is cautiously _ very cautiously _
optimistic.
   ``If we maintain, I think we'll be lucky,'' she said. ``We just
take it a step at a time. It's gradually coming around.''
   ``Nobody expects a big oil boom again,'' said Duane Indergaard,
owner of Belfield's Fort Houston Museum. ``It's too early to tell.
It's just too early to tell how Belfield's going to be.''

   Come Saturday, the moon will be full and
so will Ted Walker's farm.
   Hundreds of pickers, fiddlers and crooners will gather on
Walker's rural spread near Nashville to pay tribute to Luna from
nightfall to sunrise at another Full Moon Bluegrass Party, a
13-year-old tradition.
   The parties have attracted crowds of 1,000 to 1,500 people and
have seen well-known musicians such as Chet Atkins and Wynonna Judd
sitting in with carpenters, accountants and housewives for
impromptu jam sessions.
   ``The full moon just brings out something special in people,''
Walker said. ``They're up tempo and the moon is up tempo and
everything is full energy.''
   John Hedgecoth, foreman at a Nashville guitar manufacturer,
rests up so he can stay up late to play banjo with the big boys.
   ``Spectators show up early and stay `til about midnight, and
some of the musicians will brave the crowd,'' he said. ``But the
serious musicians wait until about 11 p.m. to show up and the
really good jam sessions start then and go all night.''
   ``It's a great party. A very folksy-type atmosphere, the quality
of the music,'' said Kelly Mullins, who works in Vanderbilt
University's publications department.
   Instruments range from banjos and guitars to spoons and
washboards. The singing ranges from great to terrible, says Walker,
a Nashville lawyer when he's not throwing bluegrass parties.
   ``I'm a terrible singer, but they put up with me _ because it's
my party,'' he said.
   The full moon parties started in August 1977 when Walker and
some friends decided to have a jam session in the country, where
the moonlight is brighter than in the city. They picked his
homestead in Williamson County about 20 miles southwest of
Nashville.
   They enjoyed themselves so much, they did it again the next full
moon, and the tradition was on.
   Fiddlers and frolickers used to gather at nightfall any day the
full moon rose from April to October.
   This year, the parties will be held only on warm, weekend nights
that coincide with the full moon.
   ``I guess I'm getting old,'' said Walker, 48.
   But partyers will continue to jam through the night. ``Every
full moon is followed by a day off,'' he said.
   The gatherings have gotten so big that Walker hires a parking
crew and a cleanup crew and keeps everyone in touch with beepers
and cellular phones.
   Walker realized in 1980 that the party's size had truly gotten
out of hand _ a rowdy stranger told him to go home and not come
back.
   That was when he started charging $5 admission. He later boosted
it to $10, at musician John Prine's suggestion that it should be
easier to make change.
   Musicians get in for free.
   ``I'm talkin' about bonafide bluegrass musicians, who I've
either seen personally or heard of by reputation,'' Walker said.
``It's not for just the casual player, maybe for people who are one
step above that.''
   Groups form and re-form with different members in different
spots all night long, but the theme is always the same: have fun
and play that ``fast-drivin' music.''
   ``It's kind of like having a buffet of music,'' Walker said.
``If you can't find something you like, you have no business out
there. But if you like bluegrass, you'll find plenty to like.''

   In this summer of Steinbrenner and Zodiac
shootings, it's this name that elicits maximum fear and loathing
among thousands and thousands of New Yorkers: Harold.
   Harold will hold up 110,000 people this summer. He is a $100
million commuter headache, the alias for a massive modernization of
the switching system that directs 650 Long Island Rail Road and
Amtrak trains beneath the East River each day.
   What does Harold mean to the 110,000 daily riders on the
nation's largest commuter railroad, the LIRR?
   Try systemwide delays, overcrowded trains and elimination of
some service. Overall, commuters should expect ``fairly rotten
service'' for the next nine weeks, predicted Sheldon Schachter,
chairman of the LIRR Commuters Council. Work began Monday and runs
through Sept. 4.
   ``You know about Harold? It's a nightmare,'' said Andy Donnelly,
a Manhattan financial analyst, shortly after his train arrived 15
minutes late Thursday morning at Penn Station.
   Donnelly, of Huntington, has traveled back and forth from Long
Island most weekdays since 1986. But the arrival of Harold has
persuaded him to put those days behind him, Donnelly said.
   ``My solution is I'm moving into the city, Upper East Side,''
said Donnelly. ``I'm not going to deal with it this summer.''
   There's already enough to deal with: the heat, George
Steinbrenner's systematic destruction of the Yankees, a gunman
selecting victims based on their birth signs.
   But now there's Harold, short for the 80-year-old Harold
Interlock System. Round-the-clock work on the antiquated system
will replace track, switches and signals in Harold, bringing it
into the '90s. But until the work is finished ...
   ``Did you ever have a bad day, one of those days where nothing
goes right? Well, picture a whole summer like that,'' said
Schachter, who has traveled between Rockville Centre and Manhattan
for two decades.
   State consumer watchdog Richard Kessel warned the LIRR could
become like the heavily congested Long Island Expressway, which is
often more parking lot than parkway. ``It's going to be traffic
jams on the rails,'' Kessel said.
   Harold derives its name from the days before the city had
numbered streets, said LIRR spokeswoman Susan McGowan. Before
becoming 39th Street, the road nearest the tower was Harold Street.
   ``Who the original Harold was, we don't know,'' said McGowan.
``It's a mystery.''
   Everybody knows about Harold now. Posters about the Harold
problems _ featuring a nifty little logo with a train switching
signal as the ``o'' in ``Harold'' _ are plastered on bulletin
boards, walls and pillars throughout Penn Station.
   ``Penn Service Suspended,'' read the most severe notices,
alerting reverse commuters that morning rush hour service from
Manhattan to Long Island is history until after Labor Day. These
5,000 riders are left to their own creative devices for rush hour
transportation.
   Fourteen employees at CMP Publications in Manhasset have kicked
in to rent a van each day that will carry them to the office and
home. Matt Sheerin, an employee at CMP, decided to try another
option.
   ``I've given up and bought a car,'' said Sheerin, a Manhattan
resident and the proud new owner of a 1981 Honda. Using the LIRR,
Sheerin's commute was about 60 minutes; taking the subway to the
LIRR in Queens takes 90 minutes; driving in this week ran 35
minutes.
   ``I think one of the things the LIRR overlooked is the off-peak
riders,'' said Sheerin. ``They'll end up losing riders, and I'm one
of them. I won't be back _ unless my car gets stolen.''

Changes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush gave an important but little
noticed speech on hemispheric policy last week. What set it apart
from virtually every other presidential initiative for the Americas
over the past two generations was that it had nothing to do with
fighting communism.
   This week Bush is attending the first post-Cold War NATO summit.
And last week's speech showed that with East-West tensions in
decline, he now has the luxury of giving priority to the
hemisphere's economic troubles as opposed to security concerns.
   Bush said that to bolster the hemisphere's newly emerging
democracies, there is need for more trade and investment and
additional debt relief.
   The speech was a departure from past initiatives, which had the
underlying rationale of keeping Marxism out of the hemisphere.
   The list is long. There was the CIA-initiated coup in Guatemala
in 1954, the American-sponsored invasion of Cuba in 1961 and the
creation of the ambitious social and economic development program
called the Alliance for Progress that same year.
   There was the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, the U.S. military
intervention in the Dominican Republic in 1965 and the efforts to
undercut Chile's leftist government from 1970-73. Hemispheric
policy during the Reagan years was devoted largely to combating
leftist forces in Central America. The Caribbean Basin Initiative
of the early 1980s was partly a response to leftist gains.
   Bush's new proposal is aimed at reversing the economic decline
that afflicted much of Latin America during the 1980s. He offered
some debt relief and promised to open the United States to more
hemispheric exports if U.S. goods are granted the same treatment.
   The ultimate aim, he said, is a ``free trade system that links
all of the Americas _ north, central and south _ and we look
forward to the day when not only are the Americas the first fully
free democratic hemisphere, but when all are equal partners in a
free trade zone stretching from the port of Anchorage to the Tierra
del Fuego.''
   A long, hard effort lies ahead, but Susan Kaufman Purcell of the
Americas Society believes it is well worthwhile. She points out
that U.S. exporters could benefit greatly from a market
encompassing 435 million people.
   Ms. Purcell says Latin Americans have been worried about being
ignored as a result of the end of the Cold War. As a result, she
says, there is a new receptivity among Latin Americans for closer
ties with the United States.
   ``A hemispheric free trade zone is therefore an idea whose time
has come,'' Ms. Purcell writes.
   The Washington Post editorialized last Friday that Bush's
proposal could bring immense benefits to Latin American countries,
where closed economies and protection of monopolies have created
``great wealth for a few people at the top and great poverty for
the rest.''
   ``Opening up these economies will be bad for the monopolies but
very good for the middle class and the people trying to climb into
it,'' the Post said.
   Reaction to the Bush proposal has been almost universally
favorable in Latin America. The contrast in attitudes toward the
United States during the 1980s is considerable. Those were the days
when Reagan administration tried mightily to enlist hemispheric
support behind its policy of arming the Nicaraguan Contras, but to
little avail.
   With Nicaragua no longer an issue and communism less of a
concern to Washington, many believe the prospects for a productive
U.S.-Latin American relationship seem brighter than at any time in
years.
   The Inter-American Dialogue, a gathering of 50 leaders from
throughout the Americas, said Bush's initiative ``is welcome,
timely and potentially significant. Indeed, it could mark a turning
point in inter-American relations _ if it is now turned from a
broad vision to concrete and joint actions.''

<TEXT>
   The Washington sex scandal that
vaulted openly gay U.S. Rep. Barney Frank to national notoriety is
a remote worry for the local hero firmly entrenched among voters in
this bastion of New England liberalism.
   His widely publicized involvement with a homosexual prostitute
remains an embarrassment, but he faces no serious opposition in his
bid for a sixth congressional term and refuses to dwell on his
admitted indiscretions.
   He called his relationship with male prostitute Stephen Gobie a
``stupid mistake,'' but said it shouldn't interfere with his work.
   ``Talking about my personal angst does not have any bearing on
the policies I'm elected to carry out,'' he said Thursday in an
interview at his office in West Newton Square in suburban Boston.
   The House ethics committee is expected to release its report
soon on his association with Gobie, but back home during the
congressional recess it's political business as usual for Frank.
   Frank admitted paying Gobie for sex and letting him move into
his home, but denied allegations he knew Gobie was operating a
prostitution ring under his roof.
   The congressman greets visitors and the news media dressed in a
rumpled blue T-shirt and casual pants, but is far from laid back.
``All right, `I'm ready,'' he grunted.
   Pleasantries fall by the wayside, Frank explained later, because
``I do a lot of things at one time and I like to do them fast.''
   Frank is one of only two openly gay members of Congress and
represents some of the most liberal communities in the country's
most liberal state, but the only stereotype that applies is that of
a veteran politician.
   He is never far from the telephone, and blends charm with firm
stands on issues such as affordable housing, health care,
education, and reducing the defense budget.
   Frank, 50, seems a shoo-in to win his sixth term in November.
The only serious Republican contender, James Nuzzo, recently
dropped out of the race for personal reasons. Republican John Soto,
his only other opponent, recently called for Frank to take an AIDS
test and is not supported by party leaders.
   After the relationship was disclosed by The Washington Times,
Frank acknowledged hiring Gobie for sex in 1985. He said he later
hired Gobie as an aide and driver and paid him with personal funds.
   Gobie has claimed that he based his prostitution ring at Frank's
Capitol Hill apartment, with Frank's knowledge.
   Frank denied that allegation and said he fired Gobie in August
1987 after learning of the prostitution ring.
   Members of the House Ethics Comittee are reportedly split over
how severely to punish Frank, with some favoring a light sanction
such as a letter criticizing his behavior. But any mild sanction is
expected to be challenged on the floor of the House.
   Rep. William E. Dannemeyer, R-Calif., has promised to push for
an expulsion resolution and others reportedly will introduce
resolutions for reprimand or censure.
   Frank said he minimized damage from the scandal by telling the
truth.
   ``It was better than I expected,'' Frank said. ``The important
thing was that I explained what happened.
   ``If all it was that I hired a prostitute, people will think
simply that you showed pretty bad judgment. If you lied and if this
is a pattern, that would be bad.''
   Outside, residents confirmed Frank's salvaged popularity.
   ``Personally, I like Barney Frank,'' said Bill Andrews, 43. ``I
think he's been straightforward and honest. I think he's done good
work. And as far as that whole thing, he's satisfied all the
questions I had with what he's said.''
   Frank said he is working on a book for Random House that will
focus on his pet philosophy that, while liberal issues are popular,
liberalism is not.
   ``We let the right look as if they're pro-America,'' said Frank.
``Liberals should start talking more about what's good about
America rather than saying how badly flawed it is.''

   South Korea plans to exchange news
media correspondents with the Soviet Union even before the two
countries normalize relations, government sources said today.
   One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
exchange may take place this fall.
   Government sources said officials of the two countries will meet
later this month to discuss related matters, including the number
of correspondents to be exchanged and their activity and security.
   Despite a lack of diplomatic relations, South Korea and the
Soviet Union have steadily expanded contacts. Some speculated that
they might agree to start formal relations before the end of this
year.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev met with South Korean
President Roh Tae-woo in San Francisco last month and agreed to
work toward normalizing their relations.
   The Soviet Union is a close ally and arms provider for Seoul's
rival, communist North Korea.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Almost every week since mid-May, bombs
blamed on leftists have rocked the Greek capital. But while terror
groups have been wiped out elsewhere in Europe, Greece has failed
to arrest a single suspect.
   Most of the bombings in Greece are believed to be the work of a
shadowy group called November 17 or of other groups inspired by
them.
   November 17 _ which takes its name from the day in 1973 when the
right-wing military junta crushed a student rebellion _ first
surfaced in December 1975 with the assassination of Athens CIA
station chief Richard Welch.
   The United States has called November 17 one of the deadliest
terrorist groups in Europe. In the past 14 years, the group has
assassinated 14 people, including three U.S. officials.
   Despite promises to crack down on terrorism, successive Greek
governments _ both conservative and socialist _ have failed to
arrest a single homegrown terrorist.
   Experts say November 17's success in evading arrest depends
mainly on their own ruthless efficiency, small membership, and a
police force that appears to have been unprepared to deal with
urban terrorism.
   Premier Constantine Mitsotakis, whose conservative New Democracy
Party won a slender victory in April's election, has a personal
reason to want to do better than his predecessors in stamping out
terrorism. Last year, November 17 assassinated his son-in-law
Pavlos Bakoyannis.
   ``If there is any danger to Greece it is from terrorism,'' the
conservative politician warned Parliament in January.
   Terrorist attacks here in the mid-1980s with Arab involvement
led to claims that Greece was soft on terrorism. In the past two
years, there have been no international terrorist incidents. But
November 17 and similar domestic groups remain active, even though
they have failed to create a broad climate of terror.
   ``Our problem is domestic terrorism, and that means November
17,'' a top state security official said in a recent interview.
   ``They are trying to create the impression that there is
widespread terrorism and ... they encourage other groups to copy
them,'' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   November 17 has claimed responsibility for only two of seven
recent bombings. The other attacks have been claimed by a
previously unknown group calling itself Popular Rage. No one has
been seriously injured in the attacks.
   Various reasons are put forth for Greece's failure in combating
terrorism.
   Conservatives suggest that during the 1981-89 socialist
administration the state security apparatus was indecisive.
   ``As soon as there is systematic work, the necessary political
will, and cooperation with all other countries of the world
(terrorism) will be confronted,'' Mitsotakis' daughter, Dora
Bakoyannis, said in an interview.
   She was elected to her slain husband's seat in Parliament and is
one of the premier's closest aides.
   The latest state budget has increased funding by 27 percent for
the Public Order Ministry. More money and material have been
promised to the anti-terrorist units, and the government has
pledged to work with foreign intelligence agencies.
   The conservatives want to wipe out any impression left from the
eight-year socialist administration of Andreas Papandreou that
Greece is lax in fighting terrorism.
   The United States issued a highly publicized travel advisory in
1985, warning its citizens that Athens airport was unsafe after
Arab terrorists hijacked a TWA jet shortly after it left the Greek
capital.
   In 1987, the United States accused Greece of allowing the
notorious Abu Nidal organization to operate a logistics office in
Athens, allegedly in exchange for immunity from terrorist attacks.
   The socialists threatened to call off negotiations on a new
defense pact with the United States, and Washington withdrew the
accusation.
   But subsequent refusals to extradite Palestinians wanted in
Italy and the United States made Greece appear to be a haven for
terrorists, and may have deprived Greek security services of
foreign intelligence material, a foreign diplomat said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Mitsotakis has said that the Palestinian sought by the United
States on charges of planting a bomb on an American airliner in
1982 will either be extradited or tried in Greece. The blast over
Hawaii killed one person and wounded 15.
   Some experts have suggested that part of the problem in fighting
domestic terrorism is the bad reputation gained by the security
services from 1967 to 1974 when they supported the military junta.
   November 17 has played on the police links with past repression,
trying to present itself as a latter-day Robin Hood-type group that
chooses selective targets and won't harm common people.
   Its long messages to newspapers, emblazoned with a red
five-pointed star, offer a mixture of intellectual arguments and
revolutionary jargon. It urges armed struggle as the only means to
overturn what it calls a corrupt society.
   An opinion poll published early last year indicated that almost
6 percent of those polled would consider voting for November 17 in
an election.

<HEAD>Teachers Union Accepts Non-Traditional Teacher Certification</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's largest teachers union
abandoned its resistance to allowing engineers, scientists and
other midcareer professionals into the classroom while they study
to become teachers.
   The 2 million-member National Education Association had opposed
so-called alternative certification programs because it said
recruiting non-teachers to combat faculty shortages undercut
traditional licensing programs.
   The policy adopted Thursday during the first day of the union's
four-day convention won passage because it established standards
like mandatory bachelor's degrees, supervision by certified
teachers and enrollment in teacher accreditation courses, officials
said.
   ``I'm not in favor of blanket alternative certification,'' said
Rosanne Bacon, president of the Massachusetts Teachers Association,
a former opponent of such teacher recruitment efforts.
   ``This proposal sets up clear, high standards for teachers
coming in on a non-traditional route. It carefully opens access to
the teaching profession,'' she said.
   The policy statement said alternative-route certification can
attract sorely needed minorities and experts in math, science,
foreign languages and special education.
   Rising teacher shortages in recent years prompted officials to
begin luring professionals from fields outside education, but
teachers objected to allowing them into the classroom before they
completed teacher certification programs. According to the NEA,
there will be a demand for 1.3 million new teachers by 1994. In a
survey of 191 of the nation's largest school districts, 48 percent
reported a shortage of teacher applicants.
   A new study by the National Center for Education Information
found that 33 states are implementing alternative routes _ up from
23 less than two years ago. Eight states hired such instructors in
1983.
   Not everyone agreed with the vote.
   Bernard Anderson of Reno, Nev., said non-traditional
certification routes mask the real issues behind the nationwide
teacher shortage.
   ``Had they raised teacher salaries, then we would have been able
to attract people with proper credentials into our profession,''
said Anderson, speaking for the Nevada delegation of about 70
teachers.
   The NEA document is the first official support by the entire
union for the concept. It takes a middle ground between outright
opposition to alternative certification and those who feel that any
college graduate can teach school.
   ``The National Education Association remains committed to
ensuring that there is a fully licensed, qualified teacher in every
classroom _ but recognizes that there may be more than one way to
prepare such teachers,'' the policy statement said.
   NEA President Keith Geiger said the union succeeded in getting
the policy adopted mainly because it emphasized those taking
alternative routes would have to meet strict standards.
   The policy statement stresses that the objective of both a
traditional and non-traditional route is ``to rigorously prepare an
individual to obtain a standard, full teaching license.''
   ``A non-traditional route does not lead to an alternative
license,'' the document said.
   Standards listed in the NEA policy include:
   _Programs must be conducted in conjunction with a state-approved
college or university teacher education program.
   _Every candidate should have at least a bachelor's degree.
   _Candidates must receive substantial training in how to teach
before beginning classroom work.
   _Candidates working in the classroom must be supervised by a
fully-licensed, trained mentor and be evaluated frequently.
   _To become fully licensed, the candidate must meet the same
state requirements as those required of traditional-route teachers.

<HEAD>Korean War Unit Remembers Defeat 40 Years Later</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Forty years ago this week the young men
of the U.S. Army's Task Force Smith were sent in search of the
North Korean army with the order to ``stop the enemy where you find
them.''
   Task Force Smith found its enemy on a hillside 22 miles south of
Seoul. After fighting for seven hours against overwhelming odds
with weapons incapable of stopping tanks, the unit was overrun.
   Gen. Carl E. Vuono, the Army's current chief of staff, said the
object lesson in the story of Task Force Smith is that the unit
symbolized an Army paralyzed by the rapid demobilization and deep
budget cuts that followed World War II.
   The story could be repeated, he said, if the Army of 1990 is cut
too quickly and deeply in search of a ``peace dividend'' as
East-West tensions relax.
   ``That Fifth of July was one of the worst days of my life,''
said Floyd R, Martin, 79, of Tucker, Ga., who on that day was an
Army major and executive officer of Task Force Smith, a hurriedly
assembled force of two infantry companies and an artillery unit.
   ``I just couldn't believe we were forced off that hill, and we
were very reluctant to leave that hill,'' Martin said Thursday
night. ``I could not believe that would happen to us. We were
pretty dejected at the end of that day.''
   ``But we just didn't have what we needed to do the job,'' Smith
said as 15 or so former comrades milled around him at a unit
reunion, retelling the stories of battle and retreat.
   Task Force Smith, named for its commander, Lt. Col. Charles
Bradford Smith, was the first U.S. fighting force to enter combat
in the Korean war. What was missing in the unit was just about
everything it needed.
   Pulled with little notice from occupation duty in Japan, the
officers and men of Task Force Smith say they had inadequate
training.
   When the sun rose on July 5 and they looked down on a miles-long
column of North Korean infantry in trucks and 33 Soviet T-34 tanks,
the 400-plus soldiers discovered other shortcomings.
   They had been issued exactly six artillery rounds powerful
enough to pierce the armor of such tanks.
   Their bazookas were too light to do the job, their rockets
simply bouncing off the armor. Their radios failed and could not be
used to call for help or artillery support. They had little or no
intelligence about the enemy. There was no medical evacuation
system and when the order came to withdraw, 30 of the most
seriously injured had to be left behind.
   And when Task Force Smith broke for cover, chewed up by North
Korean automatic fire with heavy casualties, no maps had been
issued to tell them where they were or where friendly forces might
be found.
   ``I did not know that those bazookas would not knock out a
tank,'' Martin said.
   ``All we could do is scratch the paint on the tanks and annoy
the tankers,'' said Carl Bernard, 64, a platoon leader in Task
Force Smith and like Martin, a retired Army colonel.
   Although many of those present said they would not have believed
it when they stumbled off their hill in defeat four decades ago,
Gen. Vuono was present to give their keynote address and to hail
them as a symbol of counterproductive cost-cutting.
   ``You did all that your nation had a right to expect, but you
were the victims of those who believed there was little need for
trained and ready military forces in peacetime,'' he said.
   The Army is ready to cut back, he said.
   ``But precipitous cuts of more than about 35,000 active soldiers
in any single year will fracture the combat capability that may be
required to defend our nation's vital interests,'' Vuono added.
   Martin said he agrees.
   The moral of Task Force Smith, he said, is: ``Never again send
people into combat ill-prepared and without proper weapons.''

   An Amtrak train collided with a
tractor-trailer rig Thursday, sending eight people to hospitals,
authorities said.
   ``The train's whistle was blowing the whole time and, Lord, it
sounded like a bomb when they hit,'' said Nila Williams, who saw
the crash from a window at the Torch Truckstop where she worked.
   She said it appeared the train struck the truck's trailer rather
than the cab.
   The injured were treated at Meridian hospitals and released,
officials said. Four Amtrak employees and two passengers were
treated at Jeff Anderson Regional Hospital; another passenger and
the truck driver were treated at Riley Memorial Hospital.
   Debbie Hare, spokeswoman for Amtrak in Chicago, said the injured
included the engineer and an assistant engineer. She said as many
as 20 passengers had requested medical attention.
   The New York-bound train, the Crescent, remained upright and
only the engine and the first set of wheels on the second of eight
cars had derailed, Hare said. She said the truck was carrying
railroad crossties.
   The train's manifest showed 170 passengers were aboard when the
train left New Orleans but the number could have changed before it
reached Meridian, Hare said.
   Hare said passengers remained aboard undamaged cars, which were
pulled back into Meridian's Amtrak station. She said the passengers
were to be taken by bus to Birmingham, Ala., to board another
Amtrak train for the remainder of their journeys.
   The accident occurred at a crossing off U.S. 11, shortly before
11 a.m.

<HEAD>Farms Doing Better, But Numbers Declining, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A profile of U.S. agriculture shows farmers
are moving toward the 21st century with a financial condition much
improved from a few years ago.
   But the report issued Thursday by the Agriculture Department
also further nailed down an old trend showing that farm numbers are
still declining and that big superfarms continue to grow.
   ``The proportion of farms that are financially vulnerable today
is half that of 1985,'' the report said. ``Farmland prices have
stabilized and are beginning to rise.''
   The number of farms in the United States ``continued to decline
throughout the 1980s as they have, almost unabated, since 1935,''
the report said. According to the 1987 census of agriculture, there
were just over 2 million farms, down 7 percent from 1982, when the
previous census was taken.
   Small farms, although fewer in number, increased as a proportion
of total farms. Mid-sized farms declined both in number and their
share of the total.
   ``The number of large farms continued to increase,'' the report
said. ``This trend shows little prospect of reversing in the near
future.''
   The analysis by USDA's Economic Research Service was based on an
annual report to Congress on the status of family farms.
   ``Virtually all farms in the United States are family-owned
businesses,'' the report said. ``Fewer than 3 percent of all farms
are organized as corporations, most of which are family held.''
   Only 0.3 percent are corporations owned and operated by people
other than a family. Single families own 87 percent of all farms,
and multifamily partnerships operate the remainder.
   ``Because almost all farms are owned and operated by one or more
families, we did not define family farm for this report,'' the
agency said.
   Thomas A. Carlin, one of the editors, said ``a snapshot of the
farm sector'' shows that most U.S. farms are small, non-commercial
and usually family-owned and -operated.
   Non-commercial units were defined as those having gross farm
sales of less than $40,000 a year.
   ``Small, non-commercial farms produce a minor share of total
U.S. food and fiber,'' Carlin said in the report's overview. ``They
are typically located near more densely settle urban areas where
non-farm employment opportunities abound.''
   The small farms often operate at a loss, with farm expenditures
exceeding commodity sales, government payments and other
farm-related income.
   ``Family well-being for these small farms depends primarily on
off-farm income, and their average total income in most years is
commensurate with that of all U.S. families,'' Carlin wrote.
   Most of the nation's food and fiber is produced by ``very large
commercial farms'' that are highly capitalized, Carlin said. Owners
of such large farms typically control several million dollars of
land, machinery and other assets.
   ``Many of the largest farms produce fruits, vegetables and
horticultural specialty crops, crops not covered by federal price
and income support programs,'' he said.
   Farming is the dominant occupation for families operating large
holdings, and annual income in most years is above that of the U.S.
average.
   Families with large operations do report off-farm income, but
that is typically from interest, rent or dividends rather than from
a job paycheck. With some exceptions, most big farms are located
away from major urban centers, in areas conducive to large-scale
operations.
   ``The number of mid-sized commercial farms ... continues to
shrink,'' Carlin said. ``Most of these farms produce food and feed
grains that are included in federal commodity programs.''
   Thus, he said, mid-sized farms get more than half of all direct
government payments. Operators are usually employed full time on
the farm, but often someone else in the household works off the
farm.

   Beef consumption is rising slowly in Japan,
but an Agriculture Department trade report says high prices are
discouraging all-out dining on steaks and roasts.
   The item in AgExporter magazine said recent Japanese government
figures put per capita beef consumption at 5.4 kilograms, or 11.9
pounds, in 1988-89, up 8 percent from the previous year, reflecting
larger imports.
   ``Beef consumption in Japan is still well below U.S. consumption
of 31.7 kilograms (69.9 pounds),'' the report said. ``One deterrent
to even faster increases in beef consumption is the high prices of
beef.''
   Recently, the report said, some Tokyo supermarkets were selling
U.S. frozen tenderloin steaks for $15 per pound, chilled tenderloin
steaks from fed Holstein steers for $20 per pound, Australian
chilled tenderloin blocks for $12 per pound and fed Holstein round
for $13 per pound.
   That would be at least two to four times the retail prices paid
by American consumers for comparable cuts of beef.
   James V. Parker, U.S. minister-counselor for agricultural
affairs in Tokyo, said Japanese consumers apparently are waiting
for trade liberalization next year, when they expect beef prices to
drop sharply.
   ``However, consumers are likely to be disappointed, according to
some importers, because of the tariff increase to 70 percent and
the likelihood of further depreciation of the yen against the
dollar,'' he said.
   Currently, the landed price of beef in Japan is about the same
as what it will be under liberalization.
   Parker said Japan now charges a 25 percent tariff on beef plus a
surcharge of roughly 50 percent for the domestic livestock
industry. That is only slightly above the 70 percent tariff that
will take effect with liberalization on April 1, 1991.
   However, Parker said competition among Japanese distributors and
retailers may reduce beef prices.

   By contrast, six health workers serve every 1,000 urban

   Furthermore, 63 percent of the medical staff in hospitals at the

<HEAD>Dick Tracy Cartoon Series Accused of Stereotyping</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dick Tracy is taking heat from Asian and
Hispanic groups, who say his sidekicks in a 29-year-old cartoon
series are offensive stereotypes.
   The series has been broadcast weekdays at 8 a.m. for the last
four weeks on Disney-owned KCAL-TV Channel 9 to coincide with the
release of Disney's film, ``Dick Tracy.''
   The characters considered objectionable are ``Jo Jitsu,'' a
buck-toothed, squinty-eyed, crime-fighting assistant who can't
pronounce the letter r, and ``Go Go Gomez,'' a heavily accented
Hispanic who spends a lot of time taking siestas and saying things
like ``Ay, chihuahua.''
   ``I thought this was no longer acceptable in the public media,''
said Raul Ruiz, a Chicano studies professor at Cal State
Northridge. ``This city is composed of human beings and all of us
have differences; what this does is point out that differences are
not necessarily positive.''
   Ron Wakabayashi, executive director of the Los Angeles City
Human Relations Commission and a member of the Japanese American
Citizens League, said he is dismayed by the depictions.
   A team of KCAL executives have begun reviewing the series and
episodes deemed offensive will not be broadcast, Jim Saunders, KCAL
vice president and station manager, said Thursday.
   An employee in the station's programming department screened the
series before the promotional broadcast began four weeks ago, and
found it suitable for television, Saunders said.
   Since the concerns have been raised, Saunders said, ``we are
rescreening them all.''
   Saunders said the station had received only one private citizen
complaint about the cartoons.
   The cartoon series is distributed by Sachs Finley Programming.
   Shelly Hirsh, president of programming at Sachs Finley, said the
company is concerned about a possible unfavorable reaction to the
``Dick Tracy'' cartoon series.
   ``We're monitoring it in other stations around the country,''
Hirsh said. The cartoons also are available in video stores through
Paramount Home Video. A spokseswoman for the video company said the
cartoons had been screened and so far there were no consumer
complaints.

   Traces of cocaine were found last month on
business cards recovered from the coat pockets of one of Marion
Barry suits, an FBI forensics expert testified at the mayor's trial.
   The testimony Thursday was designed to bolster the government's
assertions of frequent drug use by the mayor, who is accused of 10
counts of cocaine possession and one count of conspiracy. He also
is on trial for three felony charges of lying to a grand jury about
his alleged involvement with drugs.
   ``There were traces of cocaine on each of the three groups of
business cards'' found in the pockets of Barry's coat, testified
FBI agent Thomas Lynch. The coat was seized by the FBI in the
mayor's Jan. 18 arrest at the Vista International Hotel in an FBI
sting.
   Meanwhile, lawyers for Nation of Islam Minister Louis Farrakhan
and Imani Temple Bishop George Stallings, an excommunicated
Catholic priest, were to argue today before U.S. District Court
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson that the two should be admitted to
Barry's trial.
   A federal appeals court refused Thursday to order that Farrakhan
and Stallings be admitted, but sent the matter to Jackson for
further consideration, saying the two could not be barred simply
because they advocate a particular viewpoint. Jackson barred the
two last week, saying their presence would be ``potentially
disruptive'' and intimidating.
   On Thursday, Lynch testified that the scientific tests on the
business cards were not conducted until mid-June. There was no
explanation for the delay.
   Lynch also testified that crack cocaine was recovered from a
small pocket of Barry's suit. The FBI had supplied crack to
ex-model Rasheeda Moore for the sting operation against Barry.
Moore testified that Barry put some of the crack in his pocket just
before his arrest.
   In other testimony, prosecution witness Carole Jackson testified
that Barry sat on the side of a bathtub snorting cocaine through a
straw in the summer of 1986. That was around the time the mayor was
announcing ``Operation Clean Sweep'' to rid the city of drugs.
   Jackson testified that she, Barry, Moore and another man used
cocaine in the bathroom of an apartment.
   Jackson said she was ``absolutely positive'' she watched the
mayor take cocaine ``into the nose through a straw,'' and that
later in the evening Barry made ``several sexual advances'' that
she declined.
   Minutes before Jackson's testimony, the prosecution played a
videotape of Barry on Sept. 26, 1986, announcing a police
undercover operation that targeted drug users as well as pushers.
   Those who complain about undercover police officers selling
drugs to drug users are ``crybabies,'' Barry said in announcing the
operation.
   ``We want every drug buyer to know'' that their dealer might be
a police officer, said Barry.
   Three and a half years later, Barry was caught in the sting
operation at the Vista. He is arguing that he was the victim of
entrapment.

<TEXT>
   Royal newlyweds Prince Akishino and Princess
Kiko today made a pilgrimage to Japan's most sacred Shinto shrine,
where they paid homage to the sun goddess in a centuries-old
tradition.
   Thousands of flag-waving Japanese turned out to welcome the
couple married one week ago.
   Reports had said the two wanted to honeymoon in Thailand, but
the imperial palace prevailed upon them to make a series of
ceremonial visits to sacred sites instead.
   Attended by priests in flowing white robes, Prince Akishino,
formerly known as Prince Aya, presented a sacred branch to the sun
goddess Amaterasu at a simple wooden altar, and he and his bride
bowed low.
   Akishino, 24, is second-in-line of succession to his father,
Emperor Akihito.
   The royal newlyweds were dressed in formal Western clothing, the
prince wearing a morning coat and carrying a silk top hat and
Princess Kiko in an olive green gown with white hat and gloves.
   The shrines of Ise, on the central Japan coast about 200 miles
southwest of Tokyo, are the most sacred to followers of Shinto,
Japan's indigenous religion. Myth says Japan's imperial family is
descended from the sun goddess enshrined here.
   Princess Kiko, 23, a graduate student in psychology and the
daughter of a college professor, is only the second commoner to
marry into Japan's royal family. Akishino's elder brother, Crown
Prince Naruhito, 30, has yet to marry. The newlyweds were traveling
next to Nara, an ancient Japanese capital, where they were to visit
the tomb of Japan's first emperor, Jimmu, who according to legend
ascended the throne in 660 B.C.
   Their honeymoon will end Sunday in Tokyo, when they will pay
their respects at the tomb of the late Emperor Hirohito, Akishino's
grandfather.

<HEAD>Architects Group Agrees to End Alleged Anti-Competitive Practice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Institute of Architects is
agreeing to a consent decree settling a government lawsuit that
charged it unlawfully restrained competition among its members for
design services.
   The civil antitrust suit, which the Justice Department filed
simultaneously in federal court with the proposed consent decree,
accused the AIA of trying to prohibit its 54,000 members from
engaging in competitive bidding, giving discounts and providing
free services.
   The consent decree will force architects to compete to provide
customers not only the best design but also the best price for
their services, Justice Department spokesman Frank Kelly said
Thursday.
   The department's complaint charged that national officers of the
Washington-based professional society endorsed and promoted a 1984
policy statement of the AIA's Chicago chapter that barred
architects from submitting bids, giving discounts or providing free
design services.
   The Chicago chapter's statement said it was unethical for
architects to submit price quotations where price was the ``sole or
dominant consideration in the selection of an architect,''
according to U.S. District Court papers.
   The complaint charged that the AIA entered into a conspiracy
between September 1984, when the Chicago statement was issued, that
lasted at least through February 1985 to restrain price competition.
   The proposed consent decree, which was submitted for court
approval following a 60-day comment period, requires the AIA to
implement an elaborate antitrust compliance program to educate its
members about the law.

<HEAD>Government Levies Record Fine In Fatal Mining Explosion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The operator of a Kentucky mine where 10
workers died in an explosion last year has to pay more than
$500,000 in fines, the largest penalty ever assessed by the
government in a mine disaster.
   Pyro Mining Co. said it would appeal the fine, which was levied
Thursday by the Labor Department's Mine Safety and Health
Administration. The penalty stemmed from 121 alleged violations of
federal safety laws.
   ``We're just not making any comment at all beyond the fact that
we're surprised by the size of the penalty. The appeal is in
process and we will continue that,'' said James Greenlee, executive
vice president of Evansville, Ind.-based Costain Coal Inc., which
owns Pyro Mining.
   The Labor Department contends Pyro managers knew explosive
methane gas was accumulating in the mine four days before the
explosion but failed to take action.
   ``We consider the violations in this case so flagrant and
indicative of the company's negligence that this fine is
warranted,'' William J. Tattersall, assistant labor secretary for
mine safety, said of the record fine.
   Before Thursday, the largest penalty ever assessed for a mine
accident stemmed from a 1976 blast that killed 26 workers at the
Scotia mine near Oven Fork, Ky. In that investigation, the Blue
Diamond Coal Co. was assessed $266,000.

<HEAD>Federal Lab Says Its Has Found Nearly All Of $45 Million In
Missing Items</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Lawrence Livermore Laboratory says it has
accounted for all but a fraction of the more than $45 million in
equipment that had been reported missing.
   In a statement released Thursday by the Department of Energy's
San Francisco office, officials said that as of Tuesday the lab
could account for all but 2 percent of the items noted as missing
by the General Accounting Office.
   ``We have located about 98 percent of all the missing
property,'' said Carol Powell of the DOE in San Francisco. ``We
don't expect we'll ever achieve 100 percent.''
   A statement by the nuclear weapons research and development
facility laboratory in Livermore, Calif. said that the only
equipment still missing had an acquisition value of about $4.5
million and a current value of about $2 million.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, released a report
Tuesday saying that as of mid-January, the Livermore laboratory was
missing more than $45 million worth of equipment. The study said
there were 27,538 missing items, ranging from typewriters to
computers, and that the missing equipment represented 16 percent of
the Livermore inventory.
   Livermore said the laboratory continued its inventory efforts
after the GAO study ended in January and that all but a fraction of
the missing items have been found.

   In one case, a policeman trying to cite a city bus driver for

bus to escape injury.
   Another policeman tried to issue a speeding ticket to a truck
driver and the driver roared off with the policeman dangling from

<HEAD>Air Controllers, Electrical Workers To Join General Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air traffic controllers and electrical
workers pledged to join a general strike by supporters of the
ousted Sandinista leadership that threatens to paralyze the country.
   President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro has declared the strikes
illegal and accused the leftist Sandinistas of trying to undermine
her government's economic recovery program.
   The Sandinistas, who spearheaded the walkouts that began Monday,
accuse Chamorro's 2-month-old conservative government of breaking a
promise not to fire public employees.
   They also accuse the government of violating the constitution by
denying union leaders a say in making economic policy.
   Sandinista-led strikes in May won government employees a 100
percent salary increase and other concessions from Mrs. Chamorro's
administration.
   Banking, postal and telephone services were disrupted and
hundreds of government employees held sit-in strikes in public
buildings.
   About 3,800 telephone and post office workers walked out
Wednesday night, virtually halting operator-assisted international
calls. Nicaragua has no direct dialing. Telex service continued
normally, however.
   About 12,500 bank employees and 3,500 more at the Agriculture
Ministry walked out on Thursday. The banks were opened by managers,
but there was no service.
   Customs and the ministries of foreign affairs, labor,
construction, transportation, commerce and finance were also
struck, as were most of the country's universities.
   The air traffic controllers said they planned to stop monitoring
all flights as of this morning, and the workers at the state power
monopoly threatened electricity cuts.
   Thousands of farm workers, whose title to their lands could be
affected by the new government's policies, were also reported to be
on strike.
   Labor leader Lucio Jimenez claimed a total of 80,000 workers had
walked off their jobs nationwide, but estimates of the number of
strikers by the Sandinista-led unions have often been exaggerated
in the past.
   Jiminez was among seven Sandinista strike leaders briefly
detained by the government Wednesday.
   Since taking office April 25, Mrs. Chamorro has been trying to
whittle the government's top-heavy bureaucracy, cut expenditures,
and eliminate a host of subsidies from urban transportation to
basic foods.
   Her administration also sharply devalued the currency and has
been trying to do away with state controls on the economy imposed
by the Sandinistas when they seized power in a 1979 revolution that
overthrew rightist dictator Anastasio Somoza.
   The Sandinistas were defeated in the Feb. 25 elections by Mrs.
Chamorro's 14-party coalition.
   Government economists say a decade of Sandinista rule left
Nicaragua saddled with a huge foreign debt, a treasury that is
almost broke, an annual inflation rate of 36,300 percent, and
agriculture and industry in near shambles.
   The Sandinistas blame Nicaragua's economic woes in large measure
on the decade-long U.S.-backed Contra insurgency and U.S. economic
sanctions.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses to Release Jailed Reporter After Source Identified</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT ROTHSCHILD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge declined to release a television
reporter held in jail for contempt of court despite the apparent
public disclosure of the source the reporter has refused to
identify.
   Bexar County Sheriff Harlon Copeland said Thursday the source
was a cousin of a capital murder suspect that KMOL-TV reporter
Brian Karem interviewed by telephone from the county jail last year.
   However, the disclosure had no immediate effect on Karem's
status. He has been in the Bexar County Adult Detention Center
since June 27 serving a six-month term for contempt of court.
   Prosecutor Beth Taylor said the district attorney's office wants
the disclosure from Karem.
   ``He still has to produce a piece of paper of his sources. We
need to see that,'' she said.
   Larry Macon, Karem's attorney, filed a motion to dismiss the
contempt-of-court finding, but State District Judge Pat Priest told
Macon in chambers that the motion was meaningless. The judge said
only Karem's statements, not those of another person, could relieve
the contempt-of-court finding, according to Cathy Granados,
Priest's court coordinator.
   ``That's not going to happen in my lifetime,'' Karem said after
the sheriff's annoucement in a telephone interview from jail.
   ``I have a promise between myself and that source. That source
has not absolved me of my promise,'' he said. ``I'm sure as hell
not going to be intimidated by a judge, or by a prosecutor or by a
defense attorney.''
   A formal hearing will be set for the dismissal motion, Granados
said.
   Jane Kirtley, executive director of The Reporters Committee for
Freedom of the Press in Washington, said following Copeland's
revelation that the only reason Karem is still in jail is to punish
him.
   ``Once you've got the name of the source, you don't have to keep
the journalist jailed, unless you're just offended that the
journalist wouldn't buckle under to you,'' she said. ``At this
point there's not even an arguable purpose to continue to jail him
other than to punish him.''
   Karem has repeatedly refused to say who arranged an interview
with Henry David Hernandez, accused of killing a San Antonio police
officer last year. In the interview, Hernandez said he shot the
officer in self-defense.
   Defense attorneys and prosecutors say they have to know who
arranged the interview to determine if the interview is admissible
in his trial.
   Before about 60 reporters gathered at the jail to show support
for Karem, Copeland identified the source as Deborah Ledesma, a
cousin of Hernandez.
   Copeland said he learned the name last Friday through his own
investigation and tried to tell the judge but was told Priest could
not discuss the case with him.
   There is no Deborah Ledesma listed in San Antonio's telephone
directory so she could not be immediately reached for comment.
   Hernandez and his brother, Julian, are charged with capital
murder in the shooting of officer Gary Williams last March.
   A federal judge upheld Priest's contempt order two weeks ago and
refused to extend a stay while Karem appealed the order in federal
courts. Karem was jailed after a U.S Supreme Court justice also
refused to extend the stay.

<TEXT>
   A high-ranking military officer
accused of covering up the murder of six Jesuit priests remained in
command of an elite infantry batallion nine days after a judge
ordered his arrest.
   The priests' brutal slayings in November provoked an
international outcry and calls from some in Congress for cuts in
the millions of dollars of U.S. aid that keep El Salvador's
government and military afloat.
   The officer, Lt. Col. Camilo Hernandez, said last week he would
turn himself in when ordered to do so by Defense Minister Humberto
Larios or by Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, head of the joint chiefs of
staff.
   Ponce said the Defense Ministry did not receive a copy of the
arrest warrant until Thursday, more than a week after it was issued.
   ``We will proceed with the detention of Lt. Col. Hernandez,''
Ponce said in a telephone interview.
   On Thursday, Hernandez was still on duty at the headquarters of
the elite Belloso infantry battalion just outside the capital and
security forces had made no effort to arrest him.
   The case, with its human rights implications, could be pivotal
in in peace negotiations between the rightist government of
President Alfredo Cristiani and leftist rebels of the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front.
   The insurgents have demanded an end to military impunity in
human rights cases as a condition for ending the 10-year-old civil
war that has claimed an estimated 72,000 lives.
   ``That Lt. Col. Hernandez remains at his post is one more proof
that military impunity is a concrete reality that must be
eradicated. It is a demonstration of contempt for the judiciary,''
said Miguel Saenz, a member of the rebel's political-diplomatic
commission, in a telephone interview from Mexico City.
   Though international human rights groups blame the armed forces
or military-linked death squads for the abduction and murder of up
to 30,000 suspected government opponents in the past decade, no
officer has been tried for human rights abuses.
   Judge Ricardo Zamora of the 4th Criminal Court ordered
Hernandez' arrest on June 26 for covering up the murder of six
Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter.
   The priests were dragged from their beds and shot to death on
Nov. 16 during a major rebel offensive in the capital. Right-wing
extremists had long considered them subversive because they
publicly maintained the civil war stemmed from social and economic
injustice instead of outside communist aggression.
   Hernandez was the No. 2 officer of the Military College in
November when the Jesuits were killed by an army detail based at
the school. He allegedly ordered the burning of log books detailing
troop movements.
   Hernandez denied the allegation in sworn testimony before the
arrest warrant was issued.
   Lt. Col. Guillermo Benavides, commander of the Military College
when the killings took place, has been charged with murder along
with three lieutenants and five privates. All but one, a private
who is a fugitive, are under arrest.
   Despite his arrest, Benavides was spotted at a military-owned
beach resort earlier this year. After the sightings, he was
confined to National Police headquarters, where he reportedly
enjoys catered meals and visits from family and colleagues.

<HEAD>Report: AIDS Virus Linked to 1959 Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three medical researchers say a British sailor who
died in 1959 had the AIDS virus, which would mean the disease was
present in Britain more than 20 years earlier than had been thought.
   The researchers at the medical school at the University of
Manchester reported their findings in The Lancet, a London-based
weekly medical journal.
   The report, made available today, was based on tests on tissue
preserved from the Royal Navy sailor's body.
   According to the report, the sailor had an immune deficiency
that at the time could not be explained, as well as pneumocystis
pneumonia, one of the opportunistic diseases now associated with
AIDS.
   The discovery stemmed from the persistence of one of the three
researchers, pathologist George Williams, who performed the
original examination of the sailor's body.
   In a report in The Lancet in the 1960s, Williams described it as
a unique case of pneumonia accompanied by overwhelming
complications and secondary infections.
   When AIDS was recognized in the 1980s, Williams reminded his
colleagues of the similarity and asked if they could reopen the
sailor's case. By then, the sailor's only physical remains were
samples of tissue stored in paraffin blocks.
   In their report in The Lancet, Williams, virologist Andrew
Bailey and Gerald Corbitt reported that the HIV virus was found in
tissue taken from the sailor's kidneys, bone marrow, spleen and
pharyngeal mucosa.
   HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, causes acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, or AIDS.
   ``Taking into account the incubation time of several years
between infection and development of the full-blown disease, the
seaman would have contracted the virus in the early 1950s,'' the
Times of London quoted Bailey as saying in an interview.
   The researchers said the earliest accepted case of human blood
serum with antibodies indicating the donor was HIV-positive was a
sample taken in Zaire in 1959.
   AIDS breaks down the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers. It is
usually transmitted through sexual contact, blood transfusions or
infected needles. There is no known cure.
   As of June 1, 1990, the World Health Organization counted a
cumulative total of 263,051 cases of AIDS worldwide, but WHO
estimates the true number to be closer to 700,000.
   The organization says 156 countries have officially reported at
least one case of AIDS.

   The dollar edged down against the Japanese yen
Friday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange bounced back.
   The dollar closed at 150.95 yen, down 0.05 yen from Thursday's
close of 151.00 yen. After opening at 151.17 yen, the currency
ranged between 150.80 yen and 151.30 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 93.45
points, or 0.29 percent, losing the week at 32,445.12. The index
shed 94.25 points on Thursday.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 87.12 points as of 3 p.m. (2 a.m.

up from the previous day's 7.195 percent.
   Currency dealers said the dollar moved narrowly pending Friday's
release of U.S. employment figures for June.
   Kozo Yoshida, a dealer with Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank, said dollar
buyers emerged in early trading to cover their short positions.
   ``But the dollar as a whole remained in a narrow range. It's
rather difficult for it to move today,'' Yoshida said.

<HEAD>North Korea Promises To Open Part Of Border</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with details. No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korea announced Friday that it
will open a portion of its border with South Korea next month to
encourage unification, a South Korean news agency said.
   Naewoe Press, a semi-official news agency specializing in
communist affairs, said North Korea's Committee for the Peaceful
Reunification of the Fatherland made the announcement in a
broadcast monitored in Seoul on Friday.
   The North Korean announcement said the communist sector of the
truce village of Panmunjom inside the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) will
be opened Aug. 15 to allow free travel between the two Koreas.
   It was not immediately clear whether both North and South
Koreans, or foreigners, would be permitted to freely cross the
border. In addition, South Korea also controls any passage through
the heavily guarded border.
   In Seoul, South Korean officials denounced the communist move as
propaganda. Officials claimed it was aimed at encouraging South
Korean radical groups to hold a unification rally at the border
village on the country's national liberation day, which also is
Aug. 15.
   ``The North Korean move also is insignifiant because it affects
only its sector of Panmunjom, which is very small,'' said a senior
Seoul govenment official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Panmunjom is an oval-shaped joint security area straddling a
portion of the 155-mile border between the two Koreas. It is where
military officials of both sides irregularly meet to discuss
alleged armistice violations.
   The North Korean action would affect about 800 yards of the
border.
   The North Korean annoucement came while officials of both sides
were holding talks at Panmunjom village to discuss an accord that
would outline terms for the first meeting between the prime
ministers of the two Koreas.
   At a border meeting on Tuesday, the two Koreas agreed in
principle to hold the first prime ministers' meeting, possibly in
August in Seoul. They agreed to adopt a formal agreement on such
talks July 26.
   It would be the first meeting between top officials of the two
Koreas since the divison of their peninsula in 1945. The Korean
border is tightly sealed and no one can cross the border without
government approval, which is rarely given.
   The date announced for the border opening, Aug. 15, is symbolic
to both Koreas. On Aug. 15, 1945, Korea was liberated from Japan
after 35 years of colonial rule.
   North and South Korea are still technically at war because no
peace treaty was signed after the 1950-1953 Korean war.
   The war began June 25, 1950, when North Korea sent thousands of
troops across the 38th parallel into South Korea and ended with a
cease-fire 37 months later. The conflict killed more than a million
people, including 54,000 American soldiers.

barred from work-release programs after a convicted murderer
escaped from a community detail and allegedly stabbed a woman to
death in a mall.
   The new prison policy means 50 percent of the entire prison
population of 42,700 inmates will be held in the state's most
secure prisons. About 40 percent, or 18,127, were in such prisons
before the new policy was announced by Gov. Bob Martinez Thursday.
   Martinez said the old system was ``antiquated'' and allowed
prison officials too much discretion in deciding whether hard-core
criminals could get assigned to work details for community jobs,
road work and prison industries.
   ``We can't stop every criminal from committing criminal acts,''
he said. ``But we can stop giving the worst of them the opportunity
to walk the streets of our communities, where they have the
greatest chance to escape and threaten law-abiding citizens.''
   About 3,400 inmates now classified for minimum- or
medium-security institutions will be shifted to more secure,
so-called close-custody prisons, and it will be more difficult for
violent or long-term inmates to get into work-release programs.
   Martinez blamed the old policy for Donald David Dillbeck's
escape on June 22 from a catering detail out of the Quincy
Vocational Center.
   Dillbeck, convicted of the 1979 murder of a Lee County sheriff's
deputy, is charged with fatally stabbing 44-year-old Faye Lamb Vann
on June 24 as she sat in her car at a Tallahassee mall.
   Three corrections officials were fired for letting Dillbeck into
the program and onto the catering detail.
   ``The judgment was faulty, no question,'' Martinez said. ``But
the discretion (allowed to corrections officials) led the fault to
occur.''
   Eight other prison officials involved in the Dillbeck case will
not be fired, Martinez said, but remain on administrative leave
pending possible department disciplinary action.
   The case became a political issue when former Sen. Lawton
Chiles, a candidate in the Democratic primary for governor, blamed
it on prison policies of Martinez, whose re-election campaign touts
his law-and-order record.
   The old rules let those prisoners required to serve a specific
sentence before being eligible for parole to be moved to
less-secure custody status after they finished 40 percent of their
mandatory sentences. Dillbeck, for instance, had served 44 percent
of his 25-year-minimum term.
   The new policy requires that all such inmates serve the entire
minimum portion of their sentences in close custody before they can
be assigned to a work-release program.
   Inmates will be ineligible for work-release or other community
jobs if they have been convicted of first- or second-degree murder
unless they are within one year of release and have served all
mandatory time.

   A statement purportedly from
Communist rebels says a U.S. Peace Corps volunteer and a Japanese
aid worker would be released this month but that guerrillas would
not permit the groups to work on Negros island again.
   The New People's Army is believed holding Peace Corps volunteer
Timothy Swanson, 26, of Cheyenne, Wyo., and Fumio Mizuno, 36, of
the Japanese Organization For Industrial, Spiritual and Cultural
Advancement in the rugged mountains of Negros island.
   Today, news organizations received a statement purportedly from
``Ka (Comrade) Efren,'' who identified himself as chief of the
regional command on the island located about 300 miles southeast of
Manila.
   There was no way to verify whether the statement came from the
rebels. Reporters familiar with the Negros rebels said they were
unfamiliar with the alias ``Ka Efren.''
   Retired Roman Catholic Bishop Antonio Fortich, who has good
contacts with the rebels, said he had heard unofficially that the
two might be released soon but he had no confirmation.
   ``I would suppose they cannot hold them any longer,'' Fortich
said by telephone from Negros. ``These two gentlemen have been very
good and their have not committed human rights violations. Usually,
the NPAs do not hold people like this.''
   In the statement, ``Ka Efren'' said Swanson and Mizuno were
``invited'' to a ``dialogue'' because the rebels suspected their
organizations were involved in the government's counter-insurgency.
   Swanson was abducted June 13 from his home in Patag, about 330
miles southeast of Manila. Mizuno was taken at gunpoint May 29
while inspecting a silkworm farm about 10 miles south of Patag.
   ``They are safe,'' the statement said. ``We will turn them over
within the month, but an offensive by the enemy might endanger
their lives.''
   The statement said Swanson and Mizuno were unaware that their
organizations were used to spy against the rebels. But the
statement accused both groups of working for the government and
rich landlords.
   ``We will prepare charges against their organizations,'' the
statement said. ``After this, after we have aired our evidence,
anybody who pursues these anti-people activities are consciously
risking their lives,'' the statement said.
   The United States suspended Peace Corps operations in the
Philippines last month and recalled all 261 volunteers because of
reports the rebels planned to target members of the organization.
   U.S. officials said the decision was taken before they knew
Swanson had been kidnapped. They learned of the incident after
trying unsuccessfully to contact him about the pullout.
   The rebel statement described Swanson as ``American rah-rah boy,
ready to spread goodwill, not knowing he was being used in an evil
scheme.''
   Philippine officials said that Swanson was one of seven Peace
Corps volunteers on Negros.
   On Wednesday, about 200 Patag residents staged a rally in their
mountain village urging the rebels to release Swanson.
   Villagers, including schoolchildren, teachers and others,
carried placards asking the rebels to ``Return Tim Swanson,'' and
``We Love Tim.''
   Swanson had lived in the area for two years and married a local
schoolteacher on May 29, the day Mizuno was kidnapped. Swanson had
been teaching agricultural and reforestation techniques to local
residents.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of the NATO
summit where 16 leaders are considering the future of the Western
military alliance.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Nuclear `Last Resort' Policy</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The NATO leaders agreed to endorse President Bush's proposal
that the Western allies use nuclear weapons only as a last resort.
The plan represents a fundamental change in the alliance's doctrine
of ``flexible response,'' which is intended to leave potential
aggressors uncertain about when NATO would use nuclear arms.
   The proposal met a mixed response, but was expected to be
included in the communique that will be published at the end of the
summit. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher expressed
reservations about it, but her aides said she would go along with
it. West German officials welcomed the proposal.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>NATO Invites Gorbachev to Address Alliance</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   NATO leaders endorsed Bush's proposal to invite Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to address the North Atlantic Council, NATO's
chief decision-making body, at Brussels, Belgium. Leaders of the
six other Warsaw Pact nations also would be invited.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Elimination of Nuclear-tipped Artillery Shells</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush pledged to eliminate 1,470 U.S. nuclear-tipped artillery
shells, based mostly in West Germany, as Soviet troops withdraw
from Central and Eastern Europe. West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
agreed to reduce a united Germany's military manpower to ease
concerns in Moscow.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>West Germans Seek A Formal End to the Cold War</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Kohl sought to have his fellow NATO leaders join with Warsaw
Pact countries to declare a non-aggression agreement formally
ending the Cold War. France opposes such a declaration, as does the
United States.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Aid to the Soviet Union</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Gorbachev's mounting domestic problems came up ``again and
again'' during NATO's discussions, said West German spokesman Hans
Klein. Kohl is pressing for direct Western aid to the Soviets bvt
there was no discussion of that plan, a U.S. official said. Bush is
leaning in favor of the idea.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Overtures to Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   NATO leaders discussed the idea of allowing Hungary to
participate in some non-military NATO deliberations. There have
been indications Hungary wants to abandon the Eastern alliance.
Diplomatic sources said Bush suggested that Eastern European
diplomats be accredited to the alliance as a way of making
overtures to emerging democracies.

   A protester camped in front of the motel
where Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated has stopped
construction of a civil rights museum there.
   The Lorraine Motel where the civil rights leader was killed in
1968 is to become the centerpiece of a $9 million civil rights
museum. But protester Jacqueline Smith describes the Lorraine as
``sacred ground.'' She contends it should become housing for the
homeless, not a museum.
   Construction manager Anthony Vaccaro said Thursday he stopped
the state-run project on Monday because Ms. Smith, a former
resident and employee of the motel, is camped on a sidewalk that
must be torn up for utility lines.
   The museum is scheduled to open on July 4, 1991.
   State architect Mike Fitts said last week he was seeking legal
advice on getting rid of Ms. Smith.
   But Vaccaro said the state informed him this week that he is
responsible for removing Ms. Smith since she was ``an existing site
condition'' when the construction contract was awarded.
   ``Apparently nobody wants to take the blame for doing this,''
Vaccaro said. Ms. Smith has been living in a tent on the sidewalk
in front of the motel since March 2, 1988. She has refused requests
to move across the street where her protest could continue.
   Vaccaro said he expected to seek a court order by next week
requiring law enforcement authorities to remove Ms. Smith.
   Sheriff's deputies carried Ms. Smith from the motel when it was
shut down to make way for the museum. Since then, authorities have
pretty much ignored her.
   Police spokesman John Bennett said city authorities expected the
state to deal with Ms. Smith. ``We have never received a complaint
from anybody regarding her presence down there,'' Bennett said.
   Site preparation and preliminary construction got under way last
year, but Ms. Smith did not hinder that work. The major phase of
museum construction began last month.
   A group of concerned citizens bought the Lorraine at a
foreclosure auction in 1982 and spent the next couple of years
convincing the state, county and city governments to finance the
museum.

<TEXT>
   NATO leaders feasted on champagne and truffles at
their summit celebrating the end of the Cold War. Maybe they'll
dine on caviar when Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev shows up.
   It was supposed to be the summit of no surprises.
   Everyone was talking about troop cuts, modifying NATO policy to
use nuclear weapons only as a ``last resort,'' and the future of
the 16-nation alliance formed in 1949 at a time of East-West
hostility.
   Suddenly, a buzz spread through the summit that President Bush
had invited Gorbachev to address a future NATO meeting, and the man
trying to fend off attacks at the Communist Party congress in
Moscow became the man of the hour in London.
   Several observers quipped that Gorbachev probably wished he were
here right now.
   ``It's a spectacular coup to show that NATO is open to relations
with the Warsaw Pact,'' said British lawmaker Bruce George, a
member of the House of Commons Select Committee on Defense who is
writing Jane's NATO handbook.

   Somehow, all 16 NATO leaders managed to keep the Gorbachev
invitation a secret for days.
   Bush wrote letters to the summit leaders a week earlier with a
list of U.S. proposals, including the Gorbachev invitation, which
was quickly accepted.
   His letter to Francois Mitterrand addressed the French president
as ``old chap,'' French officials disclosed Thursday.

   Mitterrand not only lived up to his reputation for tardiness at
international meetings but only narrowly missed arriving late twice
in one morning.
   His late arrival at Lancaster House, site of the 1979 conference
that paved the way for Rhodesian independence, delayed the start of
the first summit meeting for about 15 minutes.
   For the NATO ``family portrait,'' British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher helped get the front row lined up on the grand
staircase, with marks where each was to stand.
   Mitterrand was missing. But he arrived just before Danish Prime
Minister Poul Schluter.
   Bush and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney clapped when
everyone was finally assembled.

   The summit leaders got one hour and 40 minutes extra to relax

   The summiteers finished the afternoon session early and
motorcades were caught by surprise. Bush had to wait several
minutes because the driveway was blocked by someone else's
limousine.
   ``They can't get by with that car here,'' he said with some
exasperation before his limousine appeared.

   For two hours, the leaders savored the splendors of royal living.
   They sipped cocktails in The White Drawing Room with its marble
and antique furniture, posed for pictures in the Music Room where
many young royals have been christened, wandered through the
Picture Gallery with its masterpieces of Dutch art, and dined in
the crimson Throne Room behind the chair the queen used for her
1953 coronation.
   The queen, in a green chiffon and gold lame gown set off by a
diamond necklace and earrings, sat between Bush and Mitterrand and
the prince between Woerner and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   The 52 guests, seated at five round tables, dined on poached
sole with truffles, duck garnished with white peaches and cherries,
and raspberry ice cream. There were five glasses _ for German white
wine, French red, champagne, the queen's own private stock of port

   Hundreds of blind masseurs shouting
``Protect our right to live!'' today protested a government
crackdown on massage parlors.
   Riot police blocked a street protest by the estimated 400 men
and women who tried to march toward downtown Seoul after a rally
asking the government to end its curb on massage parlors.
   The protesters accused the government of clamping down
indiscriminately on small massage parlors where many blind people
work.
   They claimed there has been a loophole in the crackdown, with
most deluxe or hotel massage parlors unaffected. They said massage
has been the main means of livelihood for about 150,000 blind
people.
   In response to public outcries against the nation's booming sex
business, the government has begun regulating hotels, massage
parlors, barber shops and saunas known for providing sex.
   Many massage houses in South Korea use parlormaids for
prostitution, along with blind masseurs. Some hotels run massage
parlors using women who are not blind for massage and sex.
   The blind masseurs also demanded the government ban massage by
people who are not blind.

<TEXT>
   Actor Gene Hackman has been told to
exercise and improve his diet after he narrowly avoided a heart
attack.
   Hackman was listed in good condition early today at St. Vincent
Hospital &amp; Medical Center, said nursing supervisor Marymae
Zimmerman.
   ``He feels much relieved,'' said Dr. Herber Semler, the
cardiologist who treated Hackman. ``The pain is gone. He is up and
around and ready to make another movie.''
   An artery leading to Hackman's heart narrowed dangerously and
doctors had to reinflate it with a balloon catheter, Semler said a
news conference Thursday.
   Semler said that if Hackman hadn't entered the hospital when he
did, ``the artery would have completely shut down and he would have
possibly had a heart attack.''
   Hackman, 60, was admitted to the hospital Tuesday.
   Semler said the rest of Hackman's coronary arteries look good
and the actor can return to an active life. He said Hackman is not
overweight, doesn't smoke and has no history of medical problems.
   ``That's the interesting part _ we see this in otherwise healthy
people,'' he said. ``The narrowing comes on as a natural process
like gray hair. It could happen to anyone.''
   However, Semler said he is recommending an exercise and diet
plan for Hackman, who lives in Beverly Hills, Calif.
   Hackman had just finished filming a movie in Europe called
``Dinosaur'' and was vacationing on the Oregon Coast when he began
suffering chest pain. He came to Portland and the pain expanded to
include his arm.
   ``We think we got him just in the nick of time,'' Semler said.
   Hackman thought the chest pain was only indigestion, but felt it
was a good idea to have it checked, said his publicist, Dick
Guttman in Los Angeles.
   The son of a journeyman pressman, Hackman is a former truck
driver and soda jerk who did not pursue acting until he was in his
30s. His most acclaimed role was as the rough-and-tumble narcotics
cop Popeye Doyle in 1971's ``The French Connection.'' That
performance won him an Academy Award.
   Among his other film credits are ``Bonnie and Clyde,'' ``I Never
Sang for My Father,'' ``The Conversation,'' ``Hawaii,'' ``Lucky
Lady,'' ``A Bridge Too Far,'' ``Superman,'' ``The Package,'' ``No
Way Out,'' ``Target,'' ``Hoosiers'' and ``Mississippi Burning.''
   Upcoming releases include ``Postcards from the Edge'' and
``Narrow Margin.''

   Police blamed right-wing
extremists for a powerful bomb that blew up today next to a
downtown bus terminal used mainly by blacks, injuring at least 24
people.
   The blast on a busy street during morning rush hour sent
concrete and debris hurtling through the air, a police spokesman
said.
   ``There were rocks flying into the air. There was blood
everywhere, people screaming and crying,'' said Nhlanhla Mbatha,
who was waiting in a bus line when the bomb went off. ``It was only
black people who got injured.''
   Doctors said most of the 24 injuries were not grave. The
independent South African Press Association said two people were
hospitalized.
   Police said no group claimed immediate responsibility for the
blast. But because the targets were blacks, they said suspicion
fell on extreme right-wing white groups, who had threatened earlier
this week to step up a bombing campaign.
   The groups oppose steps by President F.W. de Klerk toward
dismantling apartheid laws that segregate whites and blacks.
   The bomb went off in an area where buses used by black people
pick up and let off passengers. Thousands of blacks from townships
outside Johannesburg pass through the area every day, on their way
to work.
   Three mini-buses were rocked by the blast and riddled with
debris, eyewitnesses said, and up to 15 vehicles were damaged.
Witnesses said people caught by the blast stood in the street,
frozen by fear and disbelief.
   Some of the injured were buying food in nearby shops when they
were hit by flying debris, witnesses said.
   ``Everything was clouded with smoke. I saw about six people
running toward me with shredded clothing and some with no shoes,''
said shopkeeper Isha Charassi.
   Police explosive experts were combed the area to ensure there
were no other bombs.
   Several bomb attacks earlier this week in Johannesburg were
aimed at whites involved in efforts to end apartheid, but they
caused no injuries and minor damage.
   Right-wing groups claimed responsibility for those attacks.
   Police defused a large bomb Thursday in a black miners' union in
the town of Oberholzer west of Johannesburg. The bomb made of six
sticks of dynamite would have caused major damage if it had
detonated, police said.

   A man randomly fired an undetermined number of
shots on a church group, seriously injuring an off-duty police
office and wounding two other people.
   The officer, Steve Checketts, was hit in the left arm and chest
Thursday morning as teen-agers boarded buses for a church camp in
the parking lot of a Mormon Church, police said. Checketts, 43, had
told the man to drop his gun.
   The man then fired an undetermined number of rounds into the
crowd of more than 100 girls and adults before he fled to a nearby
house, said police spokesman Leo Speliopoulos.
   Checketts' condition was upgraded to serious from critical after
surgery at John C. Lincoln Hospital. A woman who was hit on the
left ankle and a teen-age girl who was grazed on her leg were
treated and released.
   After a two-hour standoff, Clifton Phillip Jeter, 23, of Los
Angeles was arrested and booked into a Maricopa County jail for
investigation of eight counts of aggravated assault with a deadly
weapon, Speliopoulos said.
   He said the five extra complaints came from people at whom the
attacker pointed a firearm and who felt their lives had been
threatened.
   Jeter had been charged with drug possession-for-sale and
aggravated assault in Los Angeles in the past 12 months.
   Speliopoulos said Jeter did not cooperate during an interview
with detectives. A motive could not immediately be determined, he
said.
   ``It just appears to be a random shooting,'' Speliopoulos said.
   Karine Eliason, 48, a church leader who was going to the camp
along with her 13-year-old daughter, said the fusillade lasted only
about 20 seconds.
   ``I could tell the guy who was shooting was doing it randomly,''
Mrs. Eliason said.

<HEAD>Pleasure Cruise Has New Meaning on Detroit River</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRETEL WIKLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WINDSOR, Ontario (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lace and spandex peel away readily
aboard the Wayward Princess, a Detroit River cruise ship where men
delight in discarded G-strings and women watch musclemen shed
double-breasted suits.
   The 110-foot, three-decked vessel opened for a preview voyage
Thursday with dozens of photographers and reporters getting the
first peek at the sexy gyrations of one male and four female
dancers.
   ``I'm doing it for the fun of it,'' said Jacques Beauchamp, who
developed the nude-dancing cruises when his business of renting the
boat for private parties waned.
   ``I think we are going to prove that it's just a good thing for
the city of Windsor.''
   Ontario strippers, unlike their Michigan counterparts, are
allowed to remove all clothing in establishments where alcohol is
sold.
   Windsor, a city of about 195,000 people, lies across the Detroit
River from Detroit. It regularly attracts U.S. visitors to downtown
clubs where women dance nude on stage or, for $5 a song, atop a box
next to the table.
   Beauchamp had staged chartered strip shows on the Wayward
Princess until Windsor officials revoked his license two years ago.
The city grudgingly approved a license two weeks ago.
   ``Personally, I'd rather not see it,'' city licensing
Commissioner Ronald Reaume said. ``But we're not there to license
the morality of the situation.''
   Beauchamp could face fines or imprisonment if the Wayward
Princess crosses the river's international boundary, said Detroit
police Officer Dan Smith. Neither Detroit police nor the U.S. Coast
Guard could say what penalties are involved.
   Kara, a tall brunette with braces and a deep tan, opened the
show Thursday with a dance to the song ``All Around the World.''
The 21-year-old Detroit-area woman, who didn't give her full name,
strutted around the tiny stage in nothing but a G-string. The
G-strings will drop on subsequent cruises.
   ``It's kind of exciting because it's the only boat in the world
that's a strip bar ... where you can get totally nude,'' Kara said.
   Elizabeth Hall, an inspector with Windsor's License Division,
was on the cruise Thursday, checking the dancers' licenses and
telling one woman she couldn't perform until her paperwork cleared.
   The ship's maiden voyage for paying customers will be tonight.
Beauchamp said he expected a capacity crowd of 325 passengers.
   Male strippers will perform on the lower level and female
strippers on the second deck. The open-air top level, loosely
termed the ``Friendship Deck,'' is designed for socializing.
   Zsolt Szanati, 22, immigrated to Windsor from Hungary three
years ago. He worked several jobs before he discovered stripping.
Nudity on the water will offer audiences an extra allure, he said.
   ``It is going to be more exciting for people on board,'' Szanati
said.

   Runoff from a severe thunderstorm swept
eight people along a 10-foot-wide storm drain for several hundred
yards, but they all survived with minor injuries.
   Authorities feared that five of the group had been swept into
the Kanawha River because they were missing for about an hour
Thursday night. But firefighters found them trapped inside the
drain.
   ``They were very happy to see the firemen,'' said Fire Lt. Bryce
Stotts. ``They just found them up there in the dark in water about
2 feet deep. They couldn't go anywhere.''
   Three others in the group were swept out of the drain about 150
yards further down.
   Police Chief Ed Garnett said he did not know why the group had
ventured into the drain.
   ``They're alive and that's what's important,'' he said.

   Israeli warplanes blasted Palestinian
guerrilla bases in Syrian-policed eastern and northern Lebanon
today, wounding at least eight guerrillas, police said.
   In Israel, the military confirmed it raided two bases and said
its planes returned safely.
   The targets of both attacks were bases of the Libyan-backed,
Damascus-based Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command.
   A Lebanese police spokesman said four jet fighters rocketed the
southern edge of the village of Sultan Yacoub in the eastern Bekaa
valley this morning.
   Later, warplanes hit Tal Hayat, a guerrilla position just
northeast of the Palestinian refugee camp of Nahr el-Bared refugee
camp, he said.
   The spokesman, speaking anonymously in line with standing rules,
said three guerrillas were wounded in Sultan Yacoub and five in Tal
Hayat.
   The base in Sultan Yacoub houses an amunition depot, a training
camp and communications center, and guerrilla naval forces are
based in Tal Hayat, the spokesman said. The police spokesman said
the Israeli warplanes scored ``direct hits'' on both bases, badly
damaging them.
   The Israeli military said the bases had been used to launch
attacks on Israel. Sultan Yacoub is about 24 miles north of the
Israeli border, and Nahr el-Bared is more than 100 miles north of
the border.
   In the first attack, the jets dropped delayed-action bombs, the
last of which exploded more than three hours after the attack, the
spokesman said.
   Guerrillas armed with assault rifles sealed off the southern
edge of Sultan Yacoub, preventing reporters and photographers from
approaching the base.
   The guerrilla group, led by Ahmed Jibril, was blamed for the
Nov. 27, 1987, hang-glider attack on a northern Israeli army base
that left six Israeli soldiers dead and eight wounded.
   On April 19, Israeli jets hit bases used by the group near
Damour, south of Beirut, in two air raids.
   A day later, they struck bases of the pro-Iranian fundamentalist
Hezbollah, or Party of God, in the Bekaa Valley, killing six people.
   The attack on Sultan Yacoub set an ammunition dump ablaze, and
smoke engulfed the base, which includes a training camp and a
communication center, the Lebanese police spokesman said.
   The guerrillas opened up with anti-aircraft guns as the jets
zoomed in to strike the base, but missed their targets, the police
spokesman said.
   By police count, 16 people have been killed and 31 wounded in
Israeli air attacks since Jan. 19.

prime minister saying more changes may be in works. Pickup 6th,
`The prime...'

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki ousted
all but one former Communist from his Cabinet today to counter
criticism of his 10-month-old government's performance.
   But some Solidarity activists said the changes weren't sweeping
enough.
   In a speech before Parliament that was broadcast nationwide,
Mazowiecki said political battles in the non-Communist-led
government were threatening the country's peaceful evolution to
democracy.
   The prime minister announced the resignation of five Cabinet
ministers, including three of the four former Communists who
remained in the government as the price for Solidarity replacing
the Communist regime in September.
   Prominent among those ousted was the interior minister, Gen.
Czeslaw Kiszczak, who is in charge of the police, and Defense
Minister Florian Siwicki.
   Mazowiecki retained ex-Communist Marcin Swiecicki, the young
foreign trade minister who has been instrumental in trade talks
with the Soviet Union.
   Some Solidarity activists said they were not satisfied with the
shake-up.
   ``These changes are not sufficient,'' said Bogdan Lis, a
Solidarity senator from Gdansk. He urged the ouster of government
spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska and Cabinet director Jacek
Ambroziak as well.
   The state news agency PAP said Mazowiecki met with Solidarity
lawmakers immediately after his speech and told them more changes
may be forthcoming.
   The prime minister suggested earlier parliamentary elections,
which are currently scheduled for spring 1991. But he did not set a
date.
   He also urged more rapid privatization of state enterprises.
   Under fire from the nation's farmers and from his former ally
and mentor, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, Mazowiecki's speech was
high political drama.
   ``Today, standing in front of you and in front of the entire
society, I have to say clearly that I see danger on the peaceful
Polish road to democracy,'' Mazowiecki declared.
   ``The sense of responsibility for the country is getting weaker
in political life,'' he said. ``Substantial arguments are being
replaced by the language of brutal struggle, even in this hall.''
   Mazowiecki's spokesman on Thursday said the speech should be
considered a turning point in the history of the East bloc's first
non-Communist government, which was seated Sept. 12 in a wave of
national optimism.
   Lately, that hope has diminished. The government has had to
grapple with a major rail strike, use police to break up two farm
protests, and answer a steady stream of criticism from Walesa,
believed to be mounting a campaign to take over the presidency from
former Communist leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   Walesa aides said he had no comment after Mazowiecki's speech.
   The Solidarity leader has urged Mazowiecki to replace holdover
Communists in the government and state-run industries, hold early
elections and speed privatization of state enterprises. The prime
minister responded to all three points in his speech.
   Besides Kiszczak and Siwicki, the third ex-Communist to be
ousted from the Cabinet was Transport Minister Franciszek Wieladek.
   Agriculture Minister Czeslaw Janicki of the Peasant Party and
Communications Minister Marek Kucharski of the Democratic Party
also resigned.
   Appointed to succeed Kiszczak as head of the Interior Ministry
was Krzysztof Kozlowski, a Catholic editor who has recently been
serving as deputy interior minister.
   Taking over the Defense Ministry was Rear Adm. Piotr
Kolodziejczyk. Artur Balazs, the former minister of rural life and
a founder of the farmers union Rural Solidarity, will become
agriculture minister.
   Wieladek was replaced by Ewaryst Waligorski, and no immediate
replacement was announced for Kucharski.

   The Central Park jogger had lost 80 percent of
her blood, mostly from severe head wounds, and was close to death
when she was admitted to Metropolitan Hospital, a surgeon testified.
   ``She hung onto life by a thread. I think it's close to a
miracle that she survived,'' Dr. Robert Kurtz said Thursday at the
trial of three youths charged with raping and nearly killing the
woman.
   Color photographs of the woman's naked and bloodied body were
shown to the jury for the first time since the trial opened June
25. Defense lawyer Robert Burns complained that presenting the
pictures was unnecessary and inflammatory.
   Burns is representing Yusef Salaam, 16, who is charged along
with Antron McCray, 15, and Raymond Santana, 16, with attempted
murder, rape, sexual abuse, assault, robbery and riot in the attack
on the woman and two male joggers.
   Kurtz said the jogger had several skull fractures, a crushed
cheekbone, a concussion, bleeding under the membrane that covers
the brain, and swelling of the brain when she was brought to the
hospital.
   ``Both halves of her brain at that point were wiped out and not
functioning,'' Kurtz said.
   He said the woman could not breathe properly and had dilated
eyes, which he said was a sign of impending death. Surgeons had to
remove a huge blood clot that ``looked like she had a large grape
on her outer ear,'' he said.
   The woman was attacked late on April 19, 1989, and brought into
the hospital early the next morning. Doctors have called her
recovery and her return to her job at an investment banking firm
miraculous.
   The woman, now 29, has no recollection of what happened that
night, prosecutors said. Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth
Lederer has refused to say whether the woman will testify.
   The three defendants are being tried in an adult court, but if
convicted they will be sentenced as juvenile offenders and face up
to 10 years in prison. Three other youths are charged in the
attacks and are due to stand trial on the same charges later this
year.

   Brandon Lott watched with a 2-year-old's
wonder as children twirled sparklers to celebrate Independence Day.
Minutes later, he was paralyzed from the waist down, the victim of
a drive-by shooting.
   The toddler was in serious but stable condition this morning at
the pediatric intensive care unit of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,
said hospital spokesman Ron Wise. The bullet had shattered part of
his spine.
   No arrests had been made by early today, said Sgt. Tony O'Brien.
   ``We were just sitting there watching fireworks when a car came
by,'' said Brandon's mother, Dorothy Overland. ``They started
shooting at the ... babies.''
   ``I saw flashes of light, then it was `pow, pow, pow,''' said
Alicia Jones, 20. ``At first I thought it was firecrackers, then
everybody started diving for cover and running.''
   Police Detective Maurice Landrum said no one enjoying the block
party was a gang member.
   Brandon was one of at least five children wounded in shootings
in the Los Angeles area since Monday.

   14. As Soviet troops leave Eastern Europe and a treaty limiting
conventional armed forces is implemented, the Alliance's integrated
force structure and its strategy will change fundamentally to
include the following elements:
   _NATO will field smaller and restructured active forces. These
forces will be highly mobile and versatile so that Allied leaders
will have maximum flexibility in deciding how to respond to a
crisis. It will rely increasingly on multinational corps made up of
national units.
   _NATO will scale back the readiness of its active units,
reducing training requirements and the number of exercises.
   _NATO will rely more heavily on the ability to build up larger
forces if and when they might be needed.
   
   15. To keep the peace, the Alliance must maintain for the
foreseeable future an appropriate mix of nuclear and conventional
forces, based in Europe, and kept up to date where necessary. But,
as a defensive Alliance, NATO has always stressed that none of its
weapons will ever be used except in self-defense and that we seek
the lowest and most stable level of nuclear forces needed to secure
the prevention of war.
   
   16. The political and military changes in Europe, and the
prospects of further changes, now allow the Allies concerned to go
further. They will thus modify the size and adapt the tasks of
their nuclear deterrent forces. They have concluded that, as a
result of the new political and military conditions in Europe,
there will be a significantly reduced role for sub-strategic
nuclear systems of the shortest range. They have decided
specifically that, once negotiations begin on short-range nuclear
forces, the Alliance will propose, in return for reciprocal action
by the Soviet Union, the elimination of all its nuclear artillery
shells from Europe.
   
   17. New negotiations between the United States and the Soviet
Union on the reduction of short-range nuclear forces should begin
shortly after a CFE agreement is signed. The Allies concerned will
develop an arms control framework for these negotiations which
takes into account our requirements for far fewer nuclear weapons,
and the diminished need for sub-strategic nuclear systems of the
shortest range.
   
   18. Finally, with the total withdrawal of Soviet stationed
forces and the implementation of a CFE agreement, the Allies
concerned can reduce their reliance on nuclear weapons. These will
continue to fulfill an essential role in the overall strategy of
the Alliance to prevent war by ensuring that there are no
circumstances in which nuclear retaliation in response to military
action might be discounted. However, in the transformed Europe,
they will be able to adopt a new NATO strategy making nuclear
forces truly weapons of last resort.
   
   19. We approve the mandate given in Turnberry to the North
Atlantic Council in Permanent Session to oversee the ongoing work
on the adaptation of the Alliance to the new circumstances. It
should report its conclusions as soon as possible.
   
   20. In the context of these revised plans for defense and arms
control, and with the advice of NATO Military Authorities and all
member states concerned, NATO will prepare a new Allied military
strategy moving way from ``forward defense,'' where appropriate,
towards a reduced forward presence and modifying ``flexible
response'' to reflect a reduced reliance on nuclear weapons. In
that connection, NATO will elaborate new force plans consistent
with the revolutionary changes in Europe. NATO will also provide a
forum for Allied consultation on the upcoming negotiations on
short-range nuclear forces.
   
   21. The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)
should become more prominent in Europe's future, bringing together
the countries of Europe and North America. We support a CSCE Summit
later this year in Paris which would include the signature of a CFE
agreement and would set new standards for the establishment, and
preservation, of free societies. It should endorse, inter alia:
   _CSCE principles on the right to free and fair elections;
   _CSCE commitments to respect and uphold the rule of law;
   _CSCE guidelines for enhancing economic cooperation, based on
the development of free and competitive market economies; and
   _CSCE cooperation on environmental protection.
   
   22. We further propose that the CSCE Summit in Paris decide how
the CSCE can be institutionalized to provide a forum for wider
political dialogue in a more united Europe. We recommend that CSCE
governments establish:
   _a program for regular consultations among member governments at
the Heads of State and Government or Ministerial level, at least
once each year, with other periodic meetings of officials to
prepare for and follow up on these consultations;
   _a schedule of CSCE review conferences once every two years to
assess progress toward a Europe whole and free;
   _a small CSCE secretariat to coordinate these meetings and
conferences;
   _a CSCE mechanism to monitor elections in all the CSCE
countries, on the basis of the Copenhagen Document;
   _a CSCE Center for the Prevention of Conflict that might serve
as a forum for exchanges of military information, discussion of
unusual military activities, and the conciliation of disputes
involving CSCE member states; and
   _a CSCE parliamentary body, the Assembly of Europe, to be based
on the existing parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe, in
Strasbourg, and include representatives of all CSCE member states.
   The sites of these new institutions should reflect the fact that
the newly democratic countries of Central and Eastern Europe form
part of the political structures of the new Europe.
   
   23. Today, our Alliance begins a major transformation. Working
with all the countries of Europe, we are determined to create
enduring peace on this continent.

   Here is the text of the final declaration issued
Friday by NATO summit leaders:
   
   London Declaration on a Transformed North Atlantic Alliance,
issued by the Heads of State and Government participating in the
meeting of the North Atlantic Council in London on 5th-6th July
1990.
   
   1. Europe has entered a new, promising era. Central and Eastern
Europe is liberating itself. The Soviet Union has embarked on the
long journey toward a free society. The walls that once confined
people and ideas are collapsing. Europeans are determining their
own destiny. They are choosing freedom. They are choosing economic
liberty. They are choosing peace. They are choosing a Europe whole
and free. As a consequence, this Alliance must and will adapt.
   
   2. The North Atlantic Alliance has been the most succesful
defensive alliance in history. As our Alliance enters its fifth
decade and looks ahead to a new century, it must continue to
provide for the common defense. This Alliance has done much to
bring about the new Europe. No one, however, can be certain of the
future. We need to keep standing together, to extend the long peace
we have enjoyed these past four decades. Yet our Alliance must be
even more an agent of change. It can help build the structures of a
more united continent, supporting security and stability with the
strength of our shared faith in democracy, the rights of the
individual, and the peaceful resolution of disputes. We reaffirm
that security and stability do not lie solely in the military
dimension, and we intend to enhance the political component of our
Alliance as provided for by Article 2 of our Treaty.
   
   3. The unification of Germany means that the division of Europe
is also being overcome. A united Germany in the Atlantic Alliance
of free democracies and part of the growing political and economic
integration of the European Community will be an indispensable
factor of stability, which is needed in the heart of Europe. The
move within the European Community towards political union,
including the development of a European identity in the domain of
security, will also contribute to Atlantic solidarity and to the
establishment of a just and lasting order of peace throughout the
whole of Europe.
   
   4. We recognize that, in the new Europe, the security of every
state is inseparably linked to the security of its neighbors. NATO
must become an institution where Europeans, Canadians and Americans
work together not only for the common defense, but to build new
partnerships with all the nations of Europe. The Atlantic Community
must reach out to the countries of the East which were our
adversaries in the Cold War, and extend to them the hand of
friendship.
   
   5. We will remain a defensive alliance and will continue to
defend all the territory of all of our members. We have no
aggressive intentions and we commit ourselves to the peaceful
resolution of all disputes. We will never in any circumstance be
the first to use force.
   
   6. The member states of the North Atlantic Alliance propose to
the member states of the Warsaw Treaty Organization a joint
declaration in which we solemnly state that we are no longer
adversaries and reaffirm our intention to refrain from the threat
or use of force against the territorial integrity or political
independence of any state, or from acting in any other manner
inconsistent with the purposes and principles of the United Nations
Charter and with the CSCE (the 35-nation Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe) Final Act. We invite all other CSCE member
states to join us in this commitment to non-aggression.
   
   7. In that spirit, and to reflect the changing political role of
the Alliance, we today invite President (Mikhail S.) Gorbachev on
behalf of the Soviet Union, and representatives of the other
Central and Eastern European countries, to come to Brussels and
address the North Atlantic Council. We today also invite the
governments of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Czech
and Slovak Federal Republic, the Hungarian Republic, the Republic
of Poland, the People's Republic of Bulgaria and Romania to come to
NATO, not just to visit, but to establish regular diplomatic
liaison with NATO. This will make it possible for us to share with
them our thinking and deliberations in this historic period of
change.
   
   8. Our Alliance will do its share to overcome the legacy of
decades of suspicion. We are ready to intensify military contacts,
including those of NATO Military Commanders, with Moscow and other
Central and Eastern European capitals.
   
   9. We welcome the invitation to NATO Secretary General Manfred
Woerner to visit Moscow and meet with Soviet leaders.
   
   10. Military leaders from throughout Europe gathered earlier
this year in Vienna to talk about their forces and doctrine. NATO
proposes another such meeting this autumn to promote common
understanding. We intend to establish an entirely different quality
of openness in Europe, including an agreement on ``Open Skies.''
   
   11. The significant presence of North American conventional and
U.S. nuclear forces in Europe demonstrates the underlying political
compact that binds North America's fate to Europe's democracies.
But, as Europe changes, we must profoundly alter the way we think
about defense.
   
   12. To reduce our military requirements, sound arms control
agreements are essential. That is why we put the highest priority
on completing this year the first treaty to reduce and limit
conventional armed forces in Europe (CFE) along with the completion
of a meaningful CSBM (confidence-building measures) package. These
talks should remain in continuous session until the work is done.
Yet we hope to go further. We propose that, once a CFE Treaty is
signed, follow-on talks should begin with the same membership and
mandate, with the goal of building on the current agreement with
additional measures, including measures to limit manpower in
Europe. With this goal in mind, a commitment will be given at the
time of signature of the CFE Treaty concerning the manpower levels
of a unified Germany.
   
   13. Our objective will be to conclude the negotiations on the
follow-on to CFE and CSBMs as soon as possible and looking to the
follow-up meeting of the CSCE to be held in Helsinki in 1992. We
will seek through new conventional arms control negotiations,
within the CSCE framework, further far-reaching measures in the
1990s to limit the offensive capability of conventional armed
forces in Europe, so as to prevent any nation from maintaining
disproportionate military power on the continent. NATO's High Level
Task Force will formulate a detailed position for these follow-on
conventional arms control talks. We will make provisions as needed
for different regions to redress disparities and to ensure that no
one's security is harmed at any stage. Furthermore, we will explore
broader arms control and confidence-building opportunities. This is
an ambitious agenda, but it matches our goal: enduring peace in
Europe.

   Boris N. Yeltsin told Soviet Communists today they
are following their Eastern European comrades down the path to ruin
and could even be brought to trial by a society demanding
punishment for their misdeeds.
   Yeltsin, the president of the Russian republic and populist
rival of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, shook up the sleepy fifth day of the
Communist Party congress with a blistering attack on the
hard-liners who dominate it.
   Yeltsin is calling for more drastic market-oriented reforms to
revive the faltering Soviet economy than those favored by President
Gorbachev, the leader of the Communist Party.
   If the party does not change, ``inevitably, representatives of
the apparatus will be dragged out of the bodies of legal power,''
he said. ``Such a party will be unable to hold onto its vanguard
role, or even its representatives in the legislature.''
   Citing a growing demand to nationalize party property, Yeltsin
said: ``It's possible to imagine that a struggle will begin to
bring to trial leaders of the party at all levels for damages they
personally brought to the people and the country.''
   The more than 4,600 delegates in the Kremlin's Palace of
Congresses listened intently to Yeltsin, but he received only a
smattering of applause.
   Gorbachev, asked later about Yeltsin's speech said: ``I expected
more.''
   Hammering home his point, Yeltsin told delegates:
   ``If you think there is a different possibility, look at the
fate of the Communist Parties of Eastern Europe. They separated
themselves from the people, didn't understand their role, and were
left on the side of the road.''
   The only way out, he said, is for the Soviet Communist Party to
accept all the trappings of democracy that party leaders endorsed
earlier this year.
   Yeltsin is a sympathizer of the Democratic Platform faction
within the Communist Party. The group has indicated that if the
Commmunist Party cannot be reformed, it will found its own party.
   In his speech, Yeltsin said many new parties are forming. Later,
Yeltsin predicted the Democratic Platform would join an alliance of
more democratic-minded political parties.
   On Monday, the first day of the 10-day congress, Leningrad
reformer Yuri Boldyrev, called for nationalization of party
property. Democratic Platform says taking back the party's vast
holdings is a key issue for the group.
   Yeltsin parlayed his popularity among Russian citizens in May
into election as president of Russia, the largest of the 15 Soviet
republics.
   Since quarreling with Gorbachev in late 1987, Yelstin has been a
constant critic of the Soviet leader and an advocate of faster
reform.
   But the congress so far has been a forum for Gorbachev's
hard-line critics.
   Yeltsin also has called upon the congress to change its name to
the Party of Democratic Socialism.
   Party spokesmen said Thursday that idea will be brought to the
congress floor for a vote, despite a poll indicating that 80
percent of the delegates were against changing the name.
   Ivan K. Polozkov, newly elected head of Russia's Communist Party
organization, told reporters he was against changing the party's
name.
   ``To replace the Communist Party is to change the sign on a firm
that has hurt its own reputation, but its essence won't change,''
he said. ``The task is to renew the party and to show people it can
fill an avant-garde role in society.''
   Polozkov said he also supported Gorbachev's statement on
Wednesday that the leadership should quit if it cannot make any
improvements in Soviets' lives in the next two years.
   The congress comes at a time of crisis for the Soviet party. It
is not in immediate danger of losing its dominance of the political
scene, but its authority is low and there has been talk of a split.
   The congress is technically the highest organ of the Communist
Party, empowered to set the party line, change the leadership and
alter party structure.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev indicated today he
would accept an invitation from NATO to visit its headquarters, and
a Foreign Ministry spokesman gave the alliance's latest session a
glowing review.
   Gorbachev, speaking to reporters and delegates during a break in
the Communist Party Congress in the Kremlin, said he had not
received a formal invitation yet but ``I am always ready to go.''
   NATO leaders, ending their summit in London today, approved a
communique that proposed a mutual non-aggression pact with the
Soviet Union and extended the unprecedented invitation to Gorbachev
and other Warsaw Pact leaders to visit NATO headquarters in
Brussels, Belgium, probably in December.
   Gennady Gerasimov, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, told
reporters in Moscow the Soviet Union had followed the NATO summit
with high expectations and ``we welcome the results of the session
as a practical step to re-examine the philosophy of confrontation
in Europe.''
   He announced that the alliance's secretary general, Manfred
Woerner, would come to Moscow on July 14 in ``a good continuation''
of the London forum.
   Gerasimov said NATO's moves away from military confrontation
were an effective answer to several Soviet officers who have
complained the country's foreign policy under Gorbachev has
consisted mainly of one-sided concessions.
   ``The results of the NATO session show that our good example
brings answering steps from NATO,'' he said, noting that Western
moves thus bolstered Gorbachev's position at home as well as abroad.
   Ivan Polozkov, head of the Russian Federation's Communist Party,
told reporters earlier today he supports the idea of Western aid
for the ailing Soviet economy. ``I think we have no basis to refuse
aid if it's proposed,'' said Polozkov, who is considered a leading
hard-liner in the party.
   Gorbachev reportedly appealed for economic aid in a letter to
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain at the NATO meeting.
   The issue of Western economic aid to the Soviet Union was not
resolved at the London meeting, and is expected to be tackled at an
economic summit of seven major industrial democracies that opens in
Houston on Monday.

<TEXT>
   More than 150 wildfires raced across
Alaska's interior, forcing the evacuation of a town of 900 people
and disrupting travel on highways choked by heat and smoke.
   Gov. Steve Cowper declared a statewide state of emergency, and
called on the Alaska National Guard to help fight the fires that
raged over 270 square miles of forest and open tundra. An elite
firefighting team from California was being flown in later today.
   No injuries were reported.
   The biggest fire covered about 47 square miles near Beaver,
about 110 miles north of Fairbanks, but no structures were
threatened there.
   The greater threat was a wildfire that took only 24 hours to
nearly double in size to at least 39 square miles today. Flames
swelled up over trees and drew to within a quarter mile of the east
edge of Tok, a town about 175 miles southeast of Fairbanks.
   Emergency workers Thursday afternoon went door to door urging
people to leave their homes. The evacuation remained in effect
early today.
   Authorities closed portions of the Glenn Highway, leading south
to Anchorage, and the Alaska Highway, a main road from the Canada
border, for the day Thursday. But the smoke hazard diminished
overnight, and traffic resumed.
   State troopers said there was a steady line of cars passing
through Tok early today. Many were tourists hauling campers who
spent the night camped at the village airstip.
   More than 400 firefighters spent Thursday cutting firebreaks and
dumping loads of chemical retardant on the crackling forests from
airplanes flying through thick smoke. A fresh crew of about 150
arrived at Fairbanks early this morning.
   Sharon Wilson, an interagency fire spokeswoman in Fairbanks,
said a shift in the wind helped firefighters keep damage to almost
zero in Tok.
   Only a few abandoned buildings burned, she said, adding that
today's work would center on widening breaks that are keeping fire
from a neighborhood north of town.
   ``It's not moving now at any drastic rate,'' Wilson said. ``The
fire tends to get more quiet at night, but the problem is, the
forecast is for more hot and dry weather, and a possible
thunderstorm.''
   The fire burned mainly black spruce, birch, aspen and brush on
the flat terrain around the town. Some Tok residents wore masks to
filter out smoke.
   ``What's bothering us the most is breathing. There's burnt
spruce needles falling out of the air,'' said one resident, Mellie
Terwilliger. ``You can see but you go around with your lights on.''
   Earlier reports that the town's Coast Guard navigational station
had been burned were incorrect, said Sue Mitchell, a spokeswoman
for the Bureau of Land Management in Fairbanks. The evacuated
station, which provides electronic signals to guide aviators and
mariners, only lost power, she said.
   Seventeen firefighter managers from California were expected to
arrive at Tok later today. A similar team battled the Yellowstone
National Park fire that claimed more than a million acres in the
summer of 1988.
   On Thursday, state forester Bob Dick said: ``The fire is out of
control. We're throwing everything at it we have _ tankers,
bulldozers, people, and it isn't working.''
   The governor, who flew over the region Thursday, said ``we had
to get upwind of it before we could actually see it _ the fires are
that massive.''
   Most of the fires were blamed on heat, low humidity and a rash
of lightning strikes. The fire danger was extremely high in much of
Alaska, Mitchell said. Temperatures approached 90 degrees
throughout much of the interior Wednesday.
   The heat dries out Alaska's forests and gives rise to late
afternoon thunderstorms and wind gusts, Mitchell said. There were
more than 1,800 lightning strikes in Alaska on Tuesday, and a
record 2,192 on Sunday.
   On the Kenai Peninsula, however, drizzle and temperatures in the
40s and 50s helped firefighters curb a series of blazes that broke
out near Ninilchik. All the blazes there were expected to be
contained by Saturday.
   Nearly four dozen fires were being ignored by firefighting crews
because of their limited ability to respond, Mitchell said.

   Communist North Korea said today it
will open part of its border with South Korea next month to promote
reunification, and it challenged the South to do the same,
according to news reports.
   But officials in the capitalist South denounced the action as
propaganda.
   The North's plans appeared to be largely symbolic, and it was
unclear whether any citizens from the North would be allowed to
cross into the South.
   It would be the first time either of the two Korean states had
opened a portion of their border since the Korean War ended in 1953.
   Word of the North's move came from Naewoe Press, a semiofficial
South Korean news agency specializing in Communist affairs. It said
North Korea's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the
Fatherland announced the plans in a broadcast monitored in Seoul
today.
   ``For a successful progress of contact and visit between the
North and the South, we will open the portion of our side ... and
hope that the South side, too, will take a corresponding measure,''
the announcement said.
   But it said only those interested in promoting reunification
would be allowed into the North.
   The North Korean announcement said about 800 yards of the border
would be opened Aug. 15, the day in 1945 when Korea was liberated
from Japan after 35 years of colonial rule.
   The North said the stretch of border to be opened was in the
Communist sector of the truce village of Panmunjom, inside the
Demilitarized Zone, about 35 miles north of Seoul. But no civilian
can enter the area without approval from military authorities of
both sides.
   South Korea's Defense Ministry said it had not been officially
notified of the North's plans and would not comment on whether
anyone would be allowed into the area during the border opening.
   It also was not clear whether North Koreans would be allowed to
cross into the South during the opening.
   South Korean officials claimed the announcement was aimed at
encouraging South Korean radical groups to hold a unification rally
at Panmunjom.
   South Korean dissident groups immediately welcomed the North
Korean announcement and asked the government to approve their plans
to send up to 300 representatives to meet with North Koreans.
   A spokesman for an umbrella dissident group, Chonminyon, said
the South Korean government's response had been negative ``but we
will push ahead with our plans.''
   A senior Seoul government official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, also said the North's move was ``insignificant'' because
it affected only a small section of the border.
   Panmunjom is an oval-shaped joint security area straddling a
portion of the 155-mile border between the two Koreas. Military
officials of both sides meet there to discuss alleged armistice
violations.
   The announcement came as negotiations were being held to arrange
for historic talks between prime ministers of the two nations,
possibly in Seoul in August. The talks would be the highest-level
contact between the Koreas since the division of the peninsula in
1945.
   A South Korean statement issued after today's talks said the
prime ministers' meeting appeared ``certain to be held.''
   On Tuesday, the two sides had agreed in principle to the
meeting, possibly in August in Seoul. They agreed to adopt a formal
agreement on the talks July 26.
   North and South Korea are still technically at war because no
peace treaty was signed after the 1950-1953 Korean war, which began
June 25, 1950 and ended with a cease-fire 37 months later.
   The Korean border is tightly sealed with more than 1.5 million
troops deployed behind concrete bunkers and barbed wire on either
side. There is no mail, telephone contact and no communications and
travel between citizens.

   Western leaders agreed today to transform NATO's
nuclear strategy, and President Bush said the alliance was offering
a ``solemn commitment to non-aggression'' to the Soviet Union and
the new democracies of Eastern Europe.
   At a news conference wrapping up a two-day NATO summit, Bush
said there would be negotiations to limit a unified Germany's
armies after the United States and the Soviet Union conclude a
treaty reducing their conventional forces in Europe.
   ``Our alliance extends the hand of friendship,'' Bush said. ``We
reaffirm that we shall never be the first to use force.'' He said
``NATO is changing,'' and that the Soviet Union should no longer
regard the Western alliance as posing a military threat.
   In Moscow, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said he was
ready to accept the NATO leaders' invitation to address a meeting
of the Western alliance, probably in December.
   ``I am always ready to go,'' Gorbachev said during a break in a
contentious Communist Party Congress at the Kremlin. The Soviet
leader said he had not received a formal invitation.
   Soviet foreign ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said, ``We
welcome the results of the (NATO) session.''
   Bush renewed his support for Gorbachev's reforms but said he has
``big problems'' with direct U.S. assistance to the Soviet economy
so long as Moscow spends $5 billion annually for Cuba and billions
more on military modernization.
   Bush said ``perhaps'' there are ways to help the Soviet economy
by extending financial credits before moving on to direct
government loans.
   Diplomatic sources said Gorbachev wrote British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher during the NATO summit with an appeal for
economic aid.
   From London, Bush was flying to Houston and next week's economic
summit of the world's seven leading industrialized nations. The
issue of direct Western aid to the Soviet economy is regarded as
certain to dominate discussions in Houston.
   NATO leaders made a dramatic overture to the Soviet Union,
expressed by Bush this way, ``We say to President Gorbachev, come
to NATO.'' NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner was dispatched to
brief Gorbachev next week.
   The NATO meeting was called to consider Western security needs
in light of the virtual collapse of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact in
Eastern Europe, whose member nations have thrown off communist
control.
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was founded after World
War II as a military counterweight to the Soviet military bloc in
Europe.
   Even as he offered friendship to East European countries, Bush
made it clear he is not ready to accept any of the former Soviet
satellites into NATO. Asked whether he would oppose Hungary's
application, Bush said, ``not forever.''
   Woerner said the changes in NATO policy would ease the threat of
war.
   ``At long last we have the chance to make for the first time in
history military aggression in Europe materially impossible and
also politically meaningless,'' he told reporters at a separate
news conference.
   On nuclear weapons, Woerner said the NATO leaders said they will
``modify and adapt the tasks of their nuclear deterrent forces''
and offered to eliminate all nuclear artillery shells from Europe
``in return for reciprocal action by the Soviet Union.''
   In another important development, the allies proposed that once
a treaty is signed _ probably next fall _ on limiting conventional
arms and military equipment, talks would begin immediately on
reducing the number of U.S. and Soviet troops in Europe.
   ``With this goal in mind, a commitment will be given at the time
of signature of the CFE treaty concerning the manpower levels of a
unified Germany,'' said a closing communique. Bush said much the
same in his news conference.
   The arms talks are being held between the NATO and Warsaw Pact
nations to sharply reduce tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear
weapons in Europe. The United States and the Soviet Union already
have agreed to limit each side to 195,000 troops in the central
region. The United States would maintain an additonal 30,000 in
Britain and southern Europe.
   The commitment by West Germany to limit the forces of a united
Germany was seen as a key move to reassure the Soviet Union.
Western leaders want a unified Germany to be part of NATO, but
Gorbachev is opposed.
   Overall, Bush described the NATO decision as a ``historic
turning point'' and said, ``The London Declaration transformed
NATO's nuclear strategy.''
   In a written statement, the leaders proposed a mutual
non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union and the other nations of
the fading Warsaw Pact alliance.
   The 20-paragraph communique also:
   _Tightened the trigger guard on European nuclear missiles by
stating they would be used only as a last resort.
   _Invited the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland,
Bulgaria and Romania ``to come to NATO, not just to visit, but to
establish regular diplomatic liaison.''
   ``The walls that once confined people and ideas are
collapsing,'' the NATO leaders declared. ``Europeans are
determining their own destiny ... They are choosing a Europe whole
and free.''
   _Proposed the eventual elimination of nuclear artillery shells
by ``reciprocal arrangement.''
   Asked what message he wants Gorbachev to receive from the London
meeting, Bush said: ``Here's an alliance that you should view, Mr.
Gorbachev, as defensive, not threatening, and please convince your
military and others in the Soviet Union of that fact.''

   Bush met British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher over breakfast
and the president made clear he was satisfied with the communique.
   Mrs. Thatcher had expressed misgivings about the change in
nuclear doctrine. But she agreed and in their final communique, the
leaders said ``there are no cricumstances in which nuclear
retaliation in response to military action might be discounted.''
   The Houston summit is expected to tackle an issue left
unresolved here _ whether the West will commit billions of dollars
in emergency assistance to help salvage the Soviet Union's
crumbling economy.
   The communique also proposed a permanent secretariat for the
35-nation East-West Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe, as well as regular meetings between member heads of
government.
   In a letter to Mrs. Thatcher at the NATO meeting, Gorbachev
appealed for economic aid to salvage his troubled economic reform
program, sources said.
   The letter made no mention of any figures, but Gorbachev said he
was hoping for ``positive conclusions'' at both the London and
Houston summits on the aid issue.
   West Germany and France have been pushing a $15 billion aid
package from the West. Bush has been cool to the proposal, but
appears to be softening his stand. Japan says it will oppose it.
   Gorbachev could use an infusion of Western cash to calm domestic
unrest by putting a greater variety of foods and consumer items on
Soviet store shelves and to reduce a balance-of-payments deficit
that exceeds $2 billion. Half the total is owed to West German
companies and creditors.
   The NATO communique was fashioned early today by foreign
ministers of the 16 alliance nations and approved virtually intact
by the heads of state at their midmorning concluding session. ``It
was pretty much our draft,'' said Bush's spokesman, Marlin
Fitzwater.
   White House national security adviser Brent Scowcroft said it
was ``an agreement not to be the first to use force'' between
individual nations rather than the two alliances. Otherwise, he
said, it would give ``a kind of blessing and legitimacy to the
Warsaw Pact that we didn't want to do.''
   For nearly a quarter-century, NATO officially has reserved the
strategic option of quickly unleashing nuclear weapons if NATO's
conventional European defenses could not repulse an invasion by
Soviet forces. That early-use doctrine is being set aside with a
declaration that nuclear arms would be a weapon of last resort.
   However, the United States will have fewer nuclear weapons in
Europe. Bush pledged to begin withdrawing the arsenal of 1,470
nuclear-tipped artillery shells, now based mostly in West Germany,
as Soviet troops pull out of Central and Eastern Europe.
   In a corresponding move, West Germany agreed to reduce the
military manpower of a reunited Germany to ease concerns in Moscow.
German sources said Bonn is prepared to reduce the size of the
joint armed forces to about 400,000, or nearly 150,000 fewer than
the combined troops of West and East Germany.

   Curators checking the Louvre after the theft of a
Renoir painting this week discovered that a dozen ancient
necklaces, bracelets and earrings had been stolen from a display
case, officials announced today.
   The officials said the second- and third-century jewelry was
stolen from the department of Egyptian antiquities. It was
discovered missing during an inspection by department curators on
Wednesday.
   The announcement of the theft came one day after authorities
took the unprecedented step of closing five Paris museums to
individual visitors following art thefts at the Louvre and two
other Paris musuems on the same day.
   But the director of the Museums of France, Jacques Sallois, said
the jewelry theft occurred long before the paintings were stolen.
   ``The disappearance of these objects _ which are not of great
value and are often seen on the market _ is certainly quite old,''
Sallois said. ``It is prior to that of the paintings.''
   The jewelry was discovered missing during an inspection by
curators, ordered after a Renoir was cut from its frame at the
Louvre on Wednesday and two other paintings were stolen from two
smaller museums.
   Police said it was possible that the same person or group robbed
all three museums during a span of several hours, moving from one
to another in the middle of the day.
   The city's major museums will remain open, but security will be
tightened, said Sallois. Authorities plan to examine existing
security systems and develop new ones similar to those used in
banks.
   In addition to the Renoir, an 1816 painting by Paul Huet was
stolen from the Carnavalet Museum, and an 1870 work by Ernest
Hebert was stolen from a museum named after the artist.
   The Hebert was one of the five museums closed as of Thursday to
individual visitors. The others _ also relatively small
institutions focusing on the works or the collections of a
particular individual _ are the Eugene Delacroix, Gustave Moreau,
Jean-Jacques Henner and Ennery museums.
   From now on, group visits to these museums must be arranged in
advance, Sallois said.
   Police have complained previously that museum officials were not
aggressive enough or candid enough in dealing with security.
Sallois, who took up his post only five weeks ago, vowed this would
change and said art theft would no longer be a ``taboo subject''
for public discussion.
   The Louvre's director, Michel Laclotte, said the theft of
Renoir's ``Portrait of a Seated Woman'' (1890-95) appeared to be
the work of an ``especially clever'' professional.
   The work by Huet, a French landscape painter, was lifted off its
hook Wednesday morning at the history museum in one of the oldest
sections of Paris. The painting, ``Les Moulins de la Glaciere,''
was estimated to be worth about $14,500.
   The Louvre and Hebert museums are run by the national
government. The Carnavalet is run by the city of Paris.

<HEAD>Police Issue Sketch as `Dartman' Hits 46th Victim</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police released a sketch of a man from
descriptions given by 46 women who say they were hit by darts while
walking on midtown Manhattan streets.
   Chief of Detectives Joseph DeMartino said the latest victim
found a homemade dart dangling from ``the backside of her
clothing'' when she returned to her office from a lunchtime
shopping trip Thursday.
   Like 17 darts recovered from other attacks, it was made from a
pin or needle with a paper stabilizer and probably was blown
through a straw, DeMartino said.
   Police said women should not panic, because needles and pins
recovered had not been doctored and showed no indication they could
carry an infection.
   All the victims were women, usually wearing business clothes or
skirts, DeMartino said. Thursday's victim was the first black woman
to report an attack, he said.
   The police sketch of the Dartman, as New York's tabloids have
dubbed the city's latest unusual criminal, shows a black man with a
mustache and neatly trimmed beard. Police say he is 5-feet-6 to
5-feet-8, weighs 135 to 150 pounds and may wear glasses and carry a
black bag.
   All the attacks have occurred on busy streets from 21st to 54th
streets between Madison and Seventh avenues, an area encompassing
the garment district, Times Square and Rockefeller Center.
   If arrested, the suspect might be charged with reckless
endangerment, assault or possibly felonious assault if a serious
injury resulted from a dart attack, DeMartino said.

   American vocalists Deborah Voigt and Hans Choi
today won top honors in the ninth international Tchaikovsky musical
competition.
   Akiko Suwanai of Japan took first place in the violin section of
the contest, West Germany's Gustav Rivinius won the gold medal for
cello, and Soviet Boris Berezovski took first place for piano,
contest officials said.
   The Tchaikovsky competition has been held every four years since
1958.
   Alyssa Park, a 16-year-old violinist from Lexington, Ky., came
in third and received three medals, for third place, for most
talented performer and for most artistic performer.
   ``I was very honored, but also very puzzled,'' she said later,
noting the international jury awarded her medals for most artistic
and most talented, but then only gave her third place.
   She admitted feeling some tension. ``But I just tried to treat
it as a concert and play,'' she said.
   Ten Americans were among the 48 finalists competing for gold
medals Thursday night.
   ``This is the superbowl of musical competition,'' said Daniel
Pollack, a competitor in the piano competion in 1958 and now a jury
member.
   Ms. Voigt, 29, a former apprentice with the San Francisco Opera
Company, won the gold medal for best female vocalist. She lives in
New York.
   Before the contest, Ms. Voigt said she wanted to win because the
Tchaikovsky competition is the best known in the world and can give
a singing career an immediate boost.
   ``The amount of publicity a singer can get here is more than I
could pay.''
   Choi, a former student at the La Scala opera company of Milan,
Italy, got the gold medal for male vocalist. He has lived in the
United States for two years and currently resides in Flushing, N.Y.
   During the competition, he said the biggest problem was
language. ``I must sing in six languages, and I must sing perfectly
in six languanges, because the judges come from so many countries.''

   Mitch Snyder, who was found hanged in the
shelter he founded, was eulogized today as a ``man of justice'' who
answered a moral call to help the nation's homeless.
   Snyder, 46, was discovered dead Thursday afternoon in a
1,400-bed homeless shelter in a ragged neighborhood a few blocks
from the U.S. Capitol. Autopsy results were not made public but
police called his death an apparent suicide.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson told a memorial service at Bible Way
Church that Snyder was a man who heard and answered a ``moral
call'' to help the homeless.
   ``The fact that birds have a home, foxes have a home, and yet
men and women, veterans of foreign wars, mothers and fathers,
working poor people, have no place to lay their head. He found that
to be a moral disgrace,'' Jackson told the mourners.
   Friends of Snyder who spoke with him Tuesday described him as
despondent. ``He was really down in the dumps and we had a long
talk about his personal situation,'' said a friend who asked not to
be identified.
   Jackson called Snyder ``a man of justice, who taught us all that
you can still regroup and get your life together.''
   ``Don't you surrender, and don't you give up,'' Jackson told the
crowd of about 600 mourners, many of whom lived at Snyder's shelter.
   A funeral is scheduled for Tuesday outside the shelter.
   The gray, three-story building where Snyder's body was found
symbolized the cause in which he achieved national prominence and
the tactics he used in his fight.
   His group _ the Community for Creative Non-Violence _ was given
the rundown government building by the Reagan administration only
after he staged a hunger strike in 1984 to demand federal aid and
publicize the plight of the homeless.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking
Committee, which handles housing issues, called Snyder ``a man of
action'' who at times became depressed by the problems of the
homeless.
   He was a ``man on the edge _ at the cutting edge of the homeless
and the street people and his own ethos and rationale for
existence,'' said Gonzalez.
   A police statement called the death ``an apparent suicide by
hanging.'' Spokesman Lt. Reginald Smith said a note containing
``suicidal references'' was found near Snyder's body.
   The Washington Post reported today that police believe he died
Tuesday night or Wednesday, and that he had not been seen since
Tuesday.
   ``It was a domestic situation, something to do with his
girlfriend,'' one source said. ``The note indicates there were
problems there.''
   A second note, found in Snyder's room and written last spring,
``talked about this possibility, sort of outlined what he might
do,'' said a police source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Carol Fennelly, Snyder's companion of 15 years and partner in
running the shelter, read a statement on the building's steps amid
the drops of an approaching thunderstorm. She said the community
was ``greatly shocked and saddened.''
   Moments later, she departed from the written text and said,
``Mitch always said good things happen when it rains. He was wrong
today.''
   Fennelly said last spring that the couple would marry in
September. She did not return telephone calls seeking comment on
the notes.
   Soon after the discovery of Snyder's body, scores of shelter
residents lingered outside the shelter, some with tears in their
eyes, others angry. Many blamed the relentless pressures Snyder
faced in his fight for the poor.
   ``The man had done all he could do,'' said Richard Coles, 28, a
former shelter resident who visited after hearing the news. ``He
was under a lot of pressure, the day-to-day struggle.''
   Shortly after word of Snyder's death spread, the shelter was
visited by Jackson and Mayor Marion Barry.
   ``It's tragic, he's gone, we'll miss him,'' said Barry, whose
drug possession and perjury trial is under way at the federal
courthouse nearby.
   Actor Martin Sheen, who portrayed Snyder in a 1986 television
movie and later spent an evening on a sidewalk grate with him to
call attention to homelessness, said he was devastated by the news
of the activist's death.
   ``It's hard to come to grips with,'' Sheen told the Star-Banner
in Ocala, Fla., where he was filming a movie. ``I just pray that a
very special angel meets him at the gate and escorts him to
paradise.''
   Last spring, Snyder refused to let Census Bureau workers into
the shelter to count its residents, calling the government's effort
``grandstanding.'' He was criticized by other homeless advocates
for his stance.
   In recent weeks, he came under pressure from some volunteer
staff aides at the shelter to fire other workers who they said were
engaged in illegal activities such as drug use.
   Snyder grew up in New York City. He remembered his father
ordering him to keep his car windows closed when he drove in the
Bowery ``to keep out the bums.''
   Snyder worked selling washing machines and vacuum cleaners and
as a job counselor before quitting and leaving his wife and two
children in 1969. He later was sent to the federal prison in
Danbury, Conn., for auto theft. While there, he met antiwar priests
Daniel and Philip Berrigan, who were serving time for destroying
draft records.
   Snyder moved to Washington in 1973, as the Vietnam war was
winding down. He was arrested Christmas Day that year, trying to
climb the White House fence.

   The possible exposure of 120 people to a
fatal leukemia virus was ``an unacceptable break in procedure'' but
probably didn't put anyone at serious risk, University of
Pennsylvania officials said.
   About 20 veterinary students and staff and 100 visiting
preschool children unknowingly handled 14 newborn lambs that had
been inoculated with a slow-acting virus, HTLV-1. The human T-cell
lymphotropic virus can cause a lethal form of leukemia in people
but does not grow in sheep.
   ``It was an unacceptable break of procedure,'' said Penn's vice
provost for research, Barry Cooperman.
   He said many of the veterinary school researchers expressed
concern that allegations of misconduct would damage the public
perception of science and hinder research efforts.
   ``The university's concern is that the public puts its trust in
us,'' he said. ``We owe the public scrupulous responsibility in
conducting experiments.''
   Penn officials investigating the violation are now waiting for
test results of blood samples from those people exposed to the
animals to determine if they were infected, according to Cooperman.
   The exposure occurred sometime in April when the lambs were
inoculated but not separated from the rest of their flock at Penn's
600-acre New Bolton Center in suburban Chester County.
   Both the school's Environmental Health and Safety Office and the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee had specified that the
inoculated lambs should be isolated from the rest of the flock.
   ``It was a serious breach of responsibility,'' said Dr. Aron B.
Fisher, chairman of Penn's animal care committee.
   Cooperman said officials investigating the problem did not learn
until early June that the veterinary students had worked with the
lambs and that children from the Kennett Square Cooperative
Preschool had visited the site and played with the animals.
   Because HTLV-1 is transmitted only through blood, mother's milk
and sexual intercourse, school and health officials believe it is
unlikely that anyone was infected.
   ``The risk to children is essentially nil,'' said Cooperman.
``And to our own people, a minimal risk.''
   The experiment, which was approved by a faculty committee, was
conducted by Jorge F. Ferrer, 58, a senior Penn researcher. Ferrer,
whose research has been suspended pending the outcome of the
inquiry, has 15 days to respond.
   Cooperman said the school completed a preliminary investigation
June 22 and will begin a full-scale inquiry soon. He refused to
comment on the initial findings.
   Ferrer's telephone number is unpublished and he could not be
reached for comment. His attorney, John M. Myers, did not return
telephone calls.
   Cooperman said Ferrer was trying to grow the virus in the lambs
to see if he could produce a protein that might help fight the
virus in people.

   A court has ordered a country house, Mercedes car,
furniture, a weapons collection and thousands of dollars in cash
returned to Galina Brezhnev, daughter of the former Soviet leader,
a newspaper said today.
   The property and cash were seized when Ms. Brezhnev's husband,
Yuri Churbanov, was imprisoned in December 1988 for accepting
bribes.
   Ms. Brezhnev filed suit in a Moscow court arguing she inherited
the car and money from her father, Leonid Brezhnev, according to
Komsomolskaya Pravda, the Young Communist League's newspaper.
   Brezhnev ruled the Soviet Union from 1964 until his death in
1982.
   The court apparently agreed the property and cash were owned by
Ms. Brezhnev rather than her husband.
   The paper said the court ordered the government to return a
country house worth $108,474, a Mercedes given to Brezhnev by an
unidentified foreign government, furniture and chandeliers. Also
seized was a weapons collection worth $200,000, stuffed animals
valued at $137,011 and $111,000 in savings.
   ``If it were not for the loud name of the plaintiff, I wouldn't
even remember the case,'' the unidentified judge said in the
article.
   ``Under the law, Galina Brezhnev was within her rights, since
most of the property belonged to her and not her husband, and the
Supreme Court had no right after sentencing Yuri Churbanov to
confiscate it.''
   The paper did not say when the decision regarding Ms. Brezhnev's
property was made.
   Ms. Brezhnev's flamboyant lifestyle shocked Moscow during her
father's tenure. The Soviet press has accused her of speculating in
diamonds, and she has been linked to a bribery scandal involving a
Moscus circus performer.
   Churbanov was fired from his job as first deputy interior
minister in 1984. Four years later he was convicted of accepting
$150,000 in bribes and sentenced to 12 years in a labor camp.

<TEXT>
   Officials from the two Germanys began
negotiations today on the final phase of unification, and Prime
Minister Lothar de Maiziere of East Germany said Berlin should be
the new German capital.
   Meanwhile, in southern Leipzig, farmers said they would dump
2,640 gallons of milk on the streets Monday to protest the loss of
business following the economic merger of the German states, the
ADN news agency said.
   Elsewhere, a bomb threat forced the evacuation of East Germany's
Parliament while lawmakers were in a session unrelated to the
East-West talks. No bomb was found, and the lawmakers returned
after about 30 minutes.
   De Maiziere led the East German delegation in talks today on
combining the political systems of the German states. An economic
treaty went into effect Sunday that united the German economies.
   Officials have spoken of all-German elections as early as
December.
   In an interview with ADN, de Maiziere said the pact should give
East Germans the same rights as West Germans. He also said the
treaty should make Berlin the capital of a united Germany.
   West German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble led the West
German delegation.
   Also today, 100,000 metal workers held one-hour ``warning
strikes'' to demand higher wages and job protection, said union
spokesman Detlef Kuchenbecker. About 10,000 marched through East
Berlin to press their demands.
   Prices have soared in this new free-market society following the
economic merger and metal workers have held strikes daily at
various plants.
   East German stores have stocked their shelves with more
expensive West German products, forcing up prices. There have also
been widespread reports of price gouging by East German stores.
   De Maiziere and other officials have criticized the price rises.
The costs of some foodstuffs varied by 100 percent from one region
to another.
   ``There's no way that can be justified merely by higher
transportation costs or overhead,'' de Maiziere told legislators
Thursday.
   ADN reported price rises of 400 percent to 600 percent in
northern Mecklenburg and Pomerania regions and said there were long
shopping lines in southeastern Dresden.
   ``There are cities in the GDR (East Germany) where the average
price levels are way above those in West Germany,'' said Economics
Minister Gerhard Pohl. ``We need certain guarantees that GDR
citizens ... won't be exploited.''
   Several thousand metalworkers struck at seven plants near
Leipzig, where pay talks deadlocked two days ago, according to ADN.
   The union wants East Germany to adopt the West German system of
stipulating salary scales and job descriptions in huge collective
contracts by which all the workers in a specific industry are bound.
   In southwestern Erfurt, 9,000 workers rallied outside their
union headquarters as contract talks began, ADN said. The
negotiations later collapsed, the agency reported.
   Workers are demanding that pay levels be brought up to West
German standards by next year. The average East German earns less
than half the average West German salary.
   Rents are being kept low to help compensate during the
transition from 40 years of socialism to capitalism. But
unemployment is expected to surge into the millions as East Germany
faces stiff competition from West Germany.
   East Germany's Communist regime was overthrown last autumn.

distressed by the recent detention of pro-democracy activists and
urged the government not to persecute opposition figures.
   Charles Rubia and Kenneth Matiba, both former Cabinet ministers,
were among at least 11 people detained Wednesday and Thursday.
   Since May they have led a loose alliance of lawyers and church
leaders seeking legalized opposition in this one-party state.
   The U.S. State Department, in a statement released by the U.S.
Embassy in Nairobi, said: ``In recent weeks, we have made clear our
hope that Matiba and Rubia and others who may speak out against the
government would not be persecuted.''
   ``We believe very strongly in the principle of public expression
of dissent and the right of peaceful assembly,'' the statement
said. ``We are obviously distressed to see this action by the
Kenyan government.''
   The U.S. Embassy on Thursday delivered a note to Kenya's Foreign
Ministry expressing the Bush administration's ``interest and
concern'' over the situation, an embassy spokesman said.
   Rubia and Matiba had urged the government to allow opposition
activists to hold a public rally on Saturday. But President Daniel
arap Moi has called the pro-democracy supporters traitors and
subversives, and he told citizens not to attend any rallies.
   The president says that multiparty politics would create ethnic
strife among Kenya's 40 tribes and lead to tribal warfare.
   The opposition accuses the government of corruption and election
rigging.

   Hastily assembled
firefighters today battled an 80-acre blaze in Yellowstone National
Park.
   ``We are sending in as many people as we can spare this
morning,'' said Marsha Karle, a park spokeswoman. Personnel from
Yellowstone and nearby Grand Teton National Park who are qualified
to fight fires were pulled off other jobs, she said.
   She said the fire, the largest so far this season in the park,
was reported Thursday afternoon and probably resulted from
lightning. The blaze is on Mount Washburn, near Dunraven Pass on
the park's Upper Loop Road, about eight miles from the nearest
visitors' facilities.
   Park officials have said that Yellowstone's policy is to fight
all wildfires aggressively while its fire management plan,
suspended after the devastating fires of 1988, is being revised.
The previous policy, which came under wide criticism, was to let
fires caused by nature burn unless they endangered human life or
property.

   The Iron Curtain may be down, but Margaret
Thatcher's still the Iron Lady.
   True to form, Britain's prime minister was the least eager among
the NATO summit participants to lower the West's voice or guard in
the wake of Kremlin reforms and the collapse of the Soviet Union's
satellite regimes in Eastern Europe.
   She delivered stern warnings about dismantling arsenals too soon
and balked at President Bush's proposal that the alliance stiffen
its policy restraint on the use of theater nuclear weapons.
   In the end, she agreed to the new ``last resort'' strategy, her
aides said, because it still means that Moscow can never be sure
that nuclear weapons wouldn't be used to respond to Soviet
aggression in Europe.
   Mrs. Thatcher called the summit outcome ``good for NATO and good
for Mr. Gorbachev.''
   The NATO leaders' final communique said ``there are no
circumstances in which nuclear retaliation in response to military
action might be discounted.''
   NATO has long openly reserved the nuclear option in the face of
potentially overpowering Warsaw Pact conventional forces. The
agreement to confine that option to the last-resort category was
reaced by foreign ministers of the 16-nation NATO alliance early
Friday, diplomatic sources said.
   Their heads of government approved the shift as part of their
closing communique today.
   As drafted by the ministers, the document also included an
invitation for the seven-nation Warsaw Pact, led by the Soviets, to
sign a non-aggression pact with the Western alliance.
   Her aides said Mrs. Thatcher feared the ``last-resort'' language
could mean ``losing the sense of the unknown which is essential to
deterrence at all levels.''
   But she finally was satisfied that ``the language that was
worked out will keep the sense of mystery,'' said one British
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Some observers noted that Mrs. Thatcher would have had a tough
time trying to block the policy shift in any case. The U.S.
proposal was strongly backed by West Germany, soon to be an even
more powerful European force as part of a united Germany.
   However, Mrs. Thatcher struck a series of warning notes through
the crucial meeting, saying that while things have changed
dramatically in Europe, glasnost and the collapse of satellite
communist governments shouldn't mean the winding down of NATO.
   The prime minister, dubbed the Iron Lady by the Soviets in the
Cold War era, reeled off statistics about continued Soviet weapons
production during a closed session of the leaders on Thursday, her
aides reported.
   ``To remind people of this might put me in danger of being
called a Cold War warrior,'' a British official quoted her as
saying.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mrs.
Thatcher then added that ``she could not be called a Cold War
warrior but she certainly could be accused of being very cautious
on defense.''
   She was just as forceful in open session.
   ``NATO has defended peace with freedom and justice but it has
never threatened anyone,'' she said. ``The cornerstone of that sure
defense must remain, for we do not know what the future holds, but
its architecture may change in the new situation.''
   But she also acknowledged Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's
need for reassurance.
   ``Our former adversaries need our help and also our assurance
that their own security is not threatened by the changes taking
place,'' she said.
   She believes her forthright approach is the one best understood
by Gorbachev. Behind the tough words, Mrs. Thatcher is, however,
looking to cash in on the peace dividend. Her government is
undertaking a major overhaul of its defense spending, and already
has canceled an order for 33 Tornado warplanes to trim $1 billion
off this year's $37.7 billion defense budget.

<HEAD>U.S. Senator Says Iran, Saudi Arabia Helping Separatists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran and Saudi Arabia are providing military
and financial support to Moslem militants fighting for independence
from India in disputed Kashmir, a U.S. senator said today.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, a senior member of the Foreign Relations
Committee, indicated that Iranian and Saudi help to the separatists
was maintaining the flow of arms and trained fighters across the
Pakistan-Indian frontier.
   ``My impression is that Pakistan has greatly reduced, and
perhaps ended, its assistance to those wanting to cross the
border,'' Cranston told reporters. ``But I believe there are others
engaged in this process.''
   The California Democrat said he understood that Iran and perhaps
some Afghans were training Kashmiri insurgents and that Saudi
Arabia was giving financial aid to help the separatists counter a
harsh Indian crackdown.
   In a meeting with the senator later, Indian Prime Minister V.P.
Singh took issue with Cranston's claim that Pakistan was scaling
down its help to the militants.
   Pakistani aid ``had actually shown a sharp increase in the last
couple of months. This help was the main obstacle to the
improvement of relations with Pakistan,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Aftab Seth quoted Singh as telling Cranston.
   He said Cranston was given documents supporting India's claim of
growing Pakistani help, but he declined to elaborate.
   Indian sources said the flow of arms across the frontier was
``several times greater'' in the last two months than it had been
earlier in the year.
   Seth declined to comment on the reported aid to the separatists
by Iran and Saudi Arabia. But he said, ``If that is his
(Cranston's) perception, he must have solid and concrete evidence
to draw his conclusions.''
   Pakistan and India both claim the entire Kashmir region, but it
is divided between them. Two of the three wars they have fought
since gaining independence from Britain in 1947 began over Kashmir.
   More than 650 people have died since tensions began growing in
January. Jammu-Kashmir is the only one of the 25 states in
Hindu-dominated India with a Moslem majority, although the nation
is officially secular.
   Two more people were reported killed today during clashes
between Indian security forces and the militants. One 60-year-old
woman was shot in the head when closed a window, witnesses said.
   Cranston said he been assured that Amnesty International, the
London-based human rights group, will be allowed to investigate
allegations of abuses by Indian troops in Kashmir.
   Until now India has resisted any outside inspection as an
infringement of its sovereignty. The government still appears
divided on how much freedom Amnesty officials would have.
   Cranston, who visited Kashmiri refugee camps during a three-day
trip to Pakistan, said Indian troops were clearly guilty of human
rights violations during the seven-month rebellion.
   Although the threat of an India-Pakistan war over Kashmir has
eased recently, he said, any conflict carried the risk of a nuclear
confrontation.
   ``My impression is that neither side possesses a nuclear bomb,
but both have the capability to produce a small number of nuclear
weapons in a number of weeks if it wants to,'' he said.
   ``If war goes on for some time, nations are likely to deploy
whatever weapons they have to win.''

   The NATO alliance isn't about to call it quits,
but it's reaching out to Moscow with a less menacing countenance.
   Formed in 1949 to contain the Red Army, the alliance suddenly
finds itself in search of a mission _ and with the prospect of
fewer American soldiers, tanks and nuclear weapons at its disposal.
   Its rival military bloc, the Warsaw Pact, is unraveling; Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is ready to withdraw tens of
thousands of troops and tanks from Europe.
   NATO ended a two-day summit today with a new strategic doctrine.
Nuclear weapons will remain in NATO's arsenal, along with a threat
to use them in the event of a ground war in Europe.
   But, propelled by President Bush, the pivotal figure at the
two-day meeting, the allies have scrapped the threat of early first
use.
   Bush, asked what message Gorbachev should take from the action,
said: ``Here's an alliance that you should view, Mr. Gorbachev, as
defensive, not threatening, and please convince your military and
others in the Soviet Union of that fact.''
   ``Our alliance extends the hand of friendship,'' Bush said. ``We
reaffirm that we shall never be the first to use force.''
   The West now views a Soviet invasion of Europe as far less
likely than when the theater nuclear doctrine was formulated 25
years ago. So nuclear weapons, under the new vernacular, will
become a deterrent of unlikely last resort.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher fought to keep NATO
from tempering its nuclear posture, but her holdout ended Thursday
night when the 16 foreign ministers agreed to keep the threat _
however diminished _ in the books.
   So radical is the change sweeping Europe the Western allies
decided to solicit a non-aggression agreement from the Warsaw Pact;
to invite Gorbachev to visit the North Atlantic Council in
December; to begin dismantling 1,470 U.S. nuclear-tipped artillery
shells once the Soviets withdrawn troops from Central and Eastern
Europe.
   The withdrawal is being negotiated between NATO and the Warsaw
Pact in Vienna, along with a more modest U.S. pullout. The
artillery shells are targeted mostly on East Germany, which by
December may be part of a united Germany and NATO itself.
   Gorbachev, remember, still heads the Soviet Union and what used
to be called the Soviet Empire. Opening NATO's door to even a
Gorbachev speech is an act of high symbolism.
   Similarly, liaison is being established with Hungary and any
other interested Warsaw Pact members who want to approach Europe's
future in concert with NATO at least as much as with Moscow.
   ``We will show that NATO has a new dimension of cooperation with
the Soviet Union and with the new democracies of Eastern Europe,''
Bush told the 15 other Western leaders meeting in a chandeliered
room in Lancaster House.
   What a difference from the rhetoric of just years ago.
   ``I am not in favor of anything that would artificially
perpetuate bloc-to-bloc relations when this no longer reflects the
reality,'' said French President Francois Mitterrand.
   Backing Bush's call for a formal end to the longstanding
hostility between the two alliances, the French leader said he
would go further, and seek ``a solemn declaration renouncing
aggression or first use of force.''
   That is a little more than Bush and most of the other allies are
willing to offer. Similarly, the United States is not yet prepared
to pull all its nuclear weapons from Europe.
   For the time being, at least, some 700 Lance missiles with
battlefield nuclear missiles will remain, with most of them in West
Germany.
   And the Bush administration is planning to produce a new
air-to-surface missile called TASM, and also will divert some
sea-launched cruise missiles to the West European nuclear arsenal.
   But with the cancellation of new Lances by Bush in May, and now
the promise to scrap nuclear-tipped artillery shells, the trend in
Europe cannot be misread.

<TEXT>
   Serbian authorities clamped a lid
today on Kosovo, the troubled southern province it administers,
detaining two ethnic Albanian opposition leaders and deploying
police.
   Tension was high in Kosovo a day after Serbia dissolved the
local legislature and government in Pristina, the province's
capital. The crackdown followed Monday's vote by Kosovo's
legislature to secede.
   Police patrolled Pristina, 150 miles south of Belgrade, and
heavy security was reported elsewhere in the province today.
   ``Yesterday's decisions ... are both illegal and
unconstitutional,'' said Jusuf Budzovi, a member of the opposition
Democratic Forum, at a news conference in Pristina.
   ``Kosovo is now a special zone in Europe in which nothing except
the police can function,'' Budzovi said. He spoke before a building
housing the Forum's offices, which were sealed off by Serbian
police.
   Yugoslavia is a loose federation of six republics and two
nominally autonomous provinces. Kosovo, 90 percent of whose 1.9
million inhabitants are ethnic Albanian, has progressively lost
control of its affairs to Serbia.
   At least 60 ethnic Albanians in Kosovo have died in clashes with
the security forces since Kosovo's autonomy was severely limited in
March 1989.
   Serbs consider Kosovo, the country's least-developed region, the
cradle of their medieval kingdom. They have accused ethnic
Albanians of pressuring remaining Slavs to move out to pave the way
for independence.
   Under the crackdown, Serbian authorities took Albanian-language
programs on Pristina radio and television off the air Thursday.
They replaced management and leading journalists at broadcast media
and the main provincial newspaper.
   Serbian authorities accused the Albanian-language media of
preparing to broadcast and print calls for a general uprising by
ethnic Albanians.
   But the Albanian-language Rilindija daily appeared on the stands
today, Yugoslavia's state Tanjug news agency said. ``Kosovo was
yesterday subjected to a coup by the Serbian authorities,'' said a
commentary in Rilindija.
   Riot police surrounded the television and radio buildings today
and were preventing visitors from entering the Rilindija publishing
house, sources said.
   The journalists' union from Yugoslavia's westernmost republic of
Slovenia, sharply denounced ``the measures being implemented
against journalists of Albanian origin in Kosovo.''
   Serbian Interior Minister Radmilo Bogdanovic said disciplinary
measures would be taken against an undetermined number of ethnic
Albanian policemen who refused to participate in the clampdown.
   Two prominent ethnic Albanian politicians, Ibrahim Rugova and
Zekeria Cana, contacted from Belgrade said today they were detained
overnight by state security police.
   The latest moves by the Communist leadership of Serbia are
generally seen as an effort to strip the last vestiges of
self-government Kosovo had under a 1974 constitution, until the
charter was amended in March.
   Ethnic Albanians, who want free elections and a multiparty
system, say the issue has been used by the republic's Communist
leader Slobodan Milosevic to gain popular support for his hard-line
policies.
   Serbia's leadership has proposed a new state constitution that
would abolish Kosovo's autonomy. The elimination of Kosovo's
parliament under a new Constitution would make ethnic Albanians a
small minority in the Serbian legislature.
   The republic of Slovenia and Croatia this spring held the
nation's first free local elections in 45 years and three other
republics plan ballots later this year. Hard-line Serbia opposes
Western-style democracy.

   An anti-abortion group filed petitions
today that it says have enough signatures to force lawmakers to
draft legislation requiring minor girls to get a parent's
permission to end a pregnancy.
   Right to Life of Michigan submitted petitions with 333,187
signatures to the Board of State Canvassers. The Michigan
Constitution requires about 192,000 valid signatures to put the
parental consent measure before the Legislature.
   Lawmakers earlier approved a law that would have required girls
17 and under to get a parent's or judge's approval before having an
abortion. Gov. James Blanchard vetoed the measure and the
Legislature failed to override his veto.
   If the canvassers rule there are sufficient signatures, the
Legislature would have 40 days to approve the measure, or it
automatically would go on a statewide ballot. If lawmakers approve
the measure, it would become law exempt from a gubernatorial veto.
   ``Both houses have voted twice on it already because there were
two different versions. And a majority of the state House and
Senate have signed the petitions,'' Barbara Listing, president of
Right to Life of Michigan, said Thursday.
   Pro-choice groups say the parental consent measure would hurt
young people and hinder communication between parents and children.
   Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a Minnesota law
requiring minor girls seeking abortions to notify a parent or seek
judicial approval.

   In a grubby field jacket, with burning eyes,
Mitch Snyder knew how to use his hunger as a weapon. He stared down
a president and got him to turn over a decaying federal building
for a homeless shelter.
   That took a 51-day fast in 1984. CBS cameras were about to
capture the showdown for ``60 Minutes.'' The presidential election
was two days off. Ronald Reagan capitulated.
   Snyder got the Navy to alter plans to name a new nuclear
submarine Corpus Christi, after the city in Texas. He said no
warship should bear the name ``the body of Christ,'' and the Navy
changed it to the USS City of Corpus Christi. That took 11 days of
self-deprivation.
   It took 30 days without food to get the Department of Health and
Human Services to release surplus food to the homeless.
   But frail, scornful, confrontational Mitch Snyder had failures,
too. He walked out of a marriage, leaving behind two small
children, forcing his wife onto welfare. He said he couldn't stand
his life of selling Electrolux vacuum cleaners and Maytag washing
machines.
   And 10 days ago, Snyder failed to keep the city of Washington
from slashing funds for the homeless and gutting a law ensuring a
night's shelter to everyone in need.
   The law had been Snyder's triumph. He persuaded voters to enact
it in an initiative six years ago.
   ``This law was strangling us,'' said a city councilman, H.R.
Crawford. ``We are broke.'' The new amendment, which awaits the
mayor's signature, would require homeless people to go though a
screening process before being approved for shelter.
   Now Mitch Snyder has suffered his ultimate failure. He has
killed himself. His body was found Thursday. His motives are far
from clear. Police sources suggest private demons _ not policy
issues _ compelled Snyder to give up living.
   Snyder, 46, was known everywhere. He described himself as
liberator of the destitute. He was the hero of a TV movie,
``Samaritan: The Mitch Snyder Story.'' Its star, Martin Sheen,
called him ``a saint.'' He led congressmen and Hollywood
celebrities to a night of sleeping on the street. He hobnobbed.
   This spring his life took new twists. He announced he would
enter a Trappist monastery to renew his relationship with God, ``to
do simple work like baking bread.''
   A month later, a change in plans. Carol Fennelly, Snyder's
companion for 15 years, said she and Snyder would marry in
September on the street in front of the 1,400-bed shelter that had
been the focus of Snyder's work, the place that Snyder had forced
from a reluctant Reagan.
   The wedding ceremony was to have been performed by Daniel
Berrigan, the anti-Vietnam war priest. Berrigan and his brother,
Philip, introduced Snyder to activism in prison in Danbury, Conn.
   The Berrigans were there for destroying draft records. Snyder
was there for stealing a car out West. That, he once explained, had
been back in his Jack Kerouac days of finding himself.
   After prison, Snyder abandoned his old life. He drifted to
Washington, activism, hunger strikes.
   He became top dog at the Community for Creative Non-Violence,
turning it from a religious antiwar group into a noisy shelter for
the roofless poor.
   His former wife, Ellen Daly, described him in an interview with
The Washington Post in 1988 as driven, unhappy.
   ``I was married to him, I lived with him, I slept with him, I
had children by him, and yet there's parts of him I really don't
know,'' she said.
   After seeing him portrayed on television, the sons, Ricky and
Dean, made contact. They visited Snyder at the shelter. They once
helped serve Thanksgiving dinner there.
   Snyder's first act of defiance in Washington occurred on
Christmas Day, 1973. He climbed the White House fence, apparently
intent on confronting President Nixon.
   He had no more luck in 1978 persuading the Rev. James English,
pastor of the fashionable Holy Trinity Church in Georgetown, to
give the homeless money intended for church repairs.
   English told The Washington Times that Snyder said, ``I know how
to deal with you,'' picketed, brought the homeless into the
sanctuary during services, staged a ``sleep-in'' in the convent
gardens, fasted.
   The congregation stood firm; it was the starving Snyder who,
from a hospital bed, gave in.
   More recently, he outraged other homeless advocates by refusing
to allow census workers into the shelter.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is engaged in a
long-term study of ways to combat poverty, and it is unlikely that
any new proposals will result before the end of the year, officials
said today.
   ``This is a long-term process,'' Deputy White House Press
Secretary Stephen Hart said. ``No decisions have been made.
Certainly no final decision on what options should be considered by
the president have been made.''
   Douglas J. Besharov, a scholar at the conservative American
Enterprise Institute, said, ``I think they are in the process of a
long-term examination of what could be done. They just are not
going to propose anything this year.''
   Besharov was among a group of outside experts on poverty
summoned to the White House for a meeting in September.
   ``It could well go into next year before any final decisions are
made,'' said an administration official who spoke on condition he
not be identified. ``You may see in the shorter term some decisions
that give an indication of what direction we are headed in, but
there will be no final decisions for quite some time.''
   Besharov said that in the short term the administration believes
that ``what is important is to improve the programs that are in
place now.''
   ``We had a major welfare reform bill passed just two years ago
that is just now being implemented by the states,'' he said. ``It
is very important that this be given a chance to do something.''
   ``The president is just not coming forward and saying, `I have a
new program that will solve all the problems.' Although that may
disappoint people, that is probably the wisest thing to do at this
stage,'' he said.
   However, Isabel V. Sawhill of the Urban Institute, an expert on
poverty who also took part in the September meeting, said, ``It
looks like they went through a lot of effort and came up with a
mouse. I am frankly quite disappointed that they could not agree on
an over-all strategy.''
   ``There were a lot of good ideas put forward, both from people
who were consulted externally and also generated internally within
the administration, and I think it was a serious and worthy effort,
but it seems to have fallen victim to some combination of ideology
and budgetary pressures.''
   Besharov said proposals from the administration that were
considered included: having the government help residents of poor
areas establish ``management corporations'' that would fight crime,
improve schools and repair housing; allocating a larger proportion
of federal aid to high-poverty areas; and providing financial
subsidies to job contractors to steer people from high poverty
areas to job openings.

<TEXT>
   Former White House aide Oliver L. North made
his fourth appearance today before a grand jury that is continuing
to investigate the Iran-Contra affair.
   The retired Marine lieutenant colonel who served as a National
Security Council staff officer during the Reagan administration
testified behind closed doors at the U.S. Courthouse.
   The grand jury, which was empaneled in May, is being used by
independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh to determine if other Reagan
administration officials participated in efforts to deceive
Congress about the sale of U.S. arms to Iran and the covert
military assistance to the Nicaraguan Contras, sources say.
   North, who is appealing three Iran-Contra convictions, was
accompanied by defense attorneys who waited in the hallway outside
the grand jury room.
   The former White House aide, who coordinated a secret arms
resupply operation for the rebels after Congress shut off U.S. aid,
testified three times last month.
   The grand jury has also heard testimony from North's former
boss, John M. Poindexter, who was sentenced last month to six
months in prison for lying to Congress about the Iran-Contra
affair. Poindexter, who is appealing his conviction, spent nearly
six hours testifying before the grand jury last month and is
expected to be called back for more questioning.
   The grand jury is also performing a final assessment of the
roles of then-President Reagan and then-Vice President Bush in the
Iran-Contra affair.

<HEAD>Rocket Kicks Off Annual 9-Day Running of Bulls Fiesta</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands roared as a rocket fired at
midday Friday kicked off the annual weeklong running of the bulls
fiesta made famous by author Ernest Hemingway.
   The traditional ``chupinazo'' rocket shot up from the balcony
overlooking the jammed main square of this northern city, whose
usual 200,000 population is estimated to have doubled for the
fiesta.
   Dressed in the traditional all-white outfit outfit with red
bandanna and sash, Councilwoman Elena Modrego shouted ``Viva San
Fermin!'' in honor of the city's patron saint and the festival's
namesake.
   The fiesta served as the setting for Hemingway's 1926 novel
``The Sun Also Rises'' and the book's success immediately began to
draw thrill seekers from around the world.
   The fiesta revolves around the daily morning run of six bulls
from a pen through cobblestoned streets for a half-mile to the city
bull ring.
   Hundreds of people, mainly young men, test their mettle by
running ahead of the bulls and the six steers that accompany them.
   The runs were to begin Saturday and go on every day at 8 a.m.
through July 14. The bulls are killed in afternoon bullfights.
   The partying continues around the clock for the week after the
rocket is fired, with natives and visitors drinking, dancing in
streets and singing in honor of San Fermin.
   The festival began in 1324 but was halted at times because of
plagues and wars, the last in 1936-39.
   Since 1591, bulls have gored 52 people to death. Thirteen
runners have died since 1924, when Hemingway saw his first run,
according to official records.

   A fisherman's net snagged a sunken

Con Dao island, the official Vietnam News Agency reported Friday.
   The 31-year-old fisherman discovered the ship in water about 40

   A diptych by 16th century master Lucas Cranach
fetched $8.6 million, a record for a German painting, Christie's
auction house said Friday.
   The painting was purchased by an anonymous bidder who
participated in the auction by telephone, Christie's said.
   The two panels bore portraits of two Electors of Saxony,
6-year-old John Frederick the Magnanimous and his father John the
Steadfast. The diptych was part of a group of art works from a
castle at Wildenstein in Switzerland.
   The previous high price for a German painting was $2.7 million
for a winter landscape by Caspar David Freidrich, sold at
Christie's Monaco in 1987.
   The previous high for a Cranach was $638,000 for a portrait of a
girl, sold in New York in 1983, Christie's said.

   Demonstrators have hurled about
260,000 firebombs in the past year, injuring 383 policemen and
destroying 32 vehicles, police said Friday.
   No comparable figures were given, but police said radical
students, dissidents and other demonstrators used more firebombs
despite a law that took effect July 7, 1989, to punish firebomb
users.
   Of 1,001 people arrested for hurling firebombs since the law
took effect, at least 32 were given sentences and imprisoned,
police said. They said the others were released or were on trial.
   In South Korea, firebomb throwers can be sentenced to less than
three years in prison. Government officials said firebomb users
would be punished sternly to end violent demonstrations.

<TEXT>
   Liberian President Samuel Doe asked
the United States to ferry him and 100 troops to his home region of
Grand Gedeh, but the U.S. government has refused, diplomatic
sources said today.
   Doe was believed to have about 3,000 loyal troops from his Krahn
tribe in the area, 300 miles northeast of the capital.
   In Washington, a senior administration official denied that Doe
had made any such request. The official, insisting on anonymity,
said Doe suggested to U.S. diplomats in Monrovia earlier this week
that he would like to stop off in his home region but made no
formal request for U.S. help in getting there.
   The United States has offered to help Doe leave the country, and
the U.S. envoys made it clear to him that the offer of
transportation applies only to international travel, the official
said. The question of U.S. transportation for troops loyal to Doe
has not arisen, the official said.
   Transporting Doe and 100 soldiers to Grand Jeddah effectively
would enable the president to launch his own campaign against the
rebels. But the diplomatic sources in the Ivory Coast, who also
spoke on condition of anonymity, said the United States refused to
help relocate Doe in the country.
   Doe's remaining forces in the capital, Monrovia, have been
surounded by rebels. Charles Taylor, the leader of the rebel
National Patriotic Front, said Doe must leave the country before he
will accept a cease-fire.
   A senior rebel leader in the United States rejected a reported
plan by six West African states to send a peacekeeping force to
Liberia that would remain there until free elections could be held.
   Tom Woewiyu said from East Orange, N.J., ``Under no
circumstances will the Patriotic Front allow troops of any kind to
step on Liberian soil.''
   ``If it was not necessary to impose a peacekeeping force on the
murderous and cannibalistic regime of Doe, why is it necessary to
impose it on us? It's being done under a camouflage of protecting
tribesmen. The real intent ... is to keep the flames of popular
revolt from spreading throughout Africa.''
   Doe reportedly has set as a condition for his resignation
assurances that his Krahn people will be protected against any
revenge attacks by the National Patriotic Front, who draws its
members from the Gio and Mano tribes.
   The 6-month-old guerrilla campaign to overthrow Doe has
degenerated into a tribal war. Doe's forces killed hundreds of Gio
and Mano civilians in an unsuccessful effort to halt the
insurgents' advance. The rebels have been accused of killing Krahns
and other civilians in revenge.
   Diplomatic sources in Freetown, Sierra Leone, in contact with
Monrovia by radio, said the rebels were moving slowly and had not
entered Monrovia from the surrounding suburbs. The diplomats said
the city's streets remained deserted today except for bands of
soldiers looting and robbing.
   Rebels have cut all roads into Monrovia and also have occupied
the port. Since Monday morning all international telephone and
telex lines into the city also have been cut.
   Foreign journalists in the city, sending their stories by radio
telex, have reported widespread looting by government troops,
operating under cover of a dusk-to-dawn curfew. Soldiers also have
frequently robbed the few people who have risked going out on the
city's streets.
   The president and his 500-man presidential guard were in the
heavily fortified presidential mansion.
   The peacekeeping plan came from a six-nation mediation committee
set up by the Economic Community of West African states.
Representatives of the countries _ Nigeria, The Gambia, Mali, Togo,
Sierra Leone and Guinea _ met in Freetown but adjourned today
pending the expected arrival of a rebel delegation.
   Although Woewiyu criticized the plan for a peacekeeping force,
he said he would go to Freetown. This, coupled with the rebels'
inability to live up to their boast that they would take Monrovia
within 12 hours of launching their attack, could mean they lacked
the firepower to oust Doe from his stronghold.
   Woewiyu, repeating earlier statements, said the United States
was responsible for the peacekeeping proposal. ``They are not
convinced it will be to their benefit that (the) National Patriotic
Front under Mr. Taylor takes control of the country,'' he said.
   A State Department official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said in Washington: ``It's not our role to assist
Charles Taylor to come to power in Liberia. Our position is that
there needs to be a political settlement to this conflict. We have
tried to facilitate that by lending our support to various
negotiation efforts.'' The State Department has said it has
reservations about Taylor's commitment to democracy.

   A bride who got onto her
husband's Harley Davidson while still wearing her wedding gown
spent the night in a hospital after it got caught in the
motorcycle's back wheel.
   Denise Hudson and her husband, Lee, planned to ride to Raleigh,
N.C., for a Grateful Dead concert after getting married July Fourth
at a park.
   But the train of Mrs. Hudson's full-length gown got caught and
dragged her under the bike. Mrs. Hudson, 28, suffered a broken
pelvis and a concussion.
   ``She's skinned and sore. It could have been worse,'' said
Hudson, 30, who received minor cuts and bruises.
   Paramedics had to cut the cream-colored gown to pieces to free
her.
   Mrs. Hudson will have to spend the next few days in Grand Strand
General Hospital, and the next few weeks recovering from her
injuries.
   ``We can always have another honeymoon,'' her husband said.

   Andra Diane Brunson's birth in the

   ``By the time my husband got from the head of the bed to the
foot of the bed, the head was out,'' Carol Brunson said of early
Wednesday's birth.
   Mrs. Brunson, her husband, Ronnie, and her four young sons were
sleeping in the 16-foot camper behind a friend's house in San Marco
about 4 a.m. Wednesday when she began having labor pains five to
seven minutes apart.
   She woke her husband and said, ``The baby's really hurting.''
   He told her to try to go back to sleep. When she woke him again
about an hour later, the baby was ready to be born.
   Brunson, a roofer who moved his family to Jacksonville from
Charleston, S.C., a few weeks ago, handled the entire delivery in
the dark.
   ``As it turned out, I didn't have time to flip on the light,''
he said.
   Mother and daughter were doing fine at Baptist Medical Center.

   Alice, the 8-foot boa constrictor, hasn't
been home since last weekend and neighbors are wondering _ is Alice
getting hungry?
   Alice normally eats once a week and it's been that long since
the male snake's last meal, a rat, said Deputy Police Chief Richard
Faulkner.
   ``You know what it's going to do out there. It's going to
grow,'' said Carole Stevens, whose cat is locked inside until Alice
turns up.
   Alice got loose after a friend of its owner took it outside last
Saturday, police said. The friend fell asleep and Alice slithered
away.
   ``I saw these two people outside looking in my trees. I thought
maybe they lost a bird,'' said Stevens, who lives near snake owner
Linda Pyorala in the Country Cousin Mobile Home Village. When
Stevens learned Alice was missing, she called police.
   Pyorala declined to comment about her missing boa.

   The Louisiana House voted 86-3 Friday to
change the state's method of executing killers from electrocution
to injection.
   Louisiana has executed 19 inmates by electrocution since the
1976 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowed states to resume use of the
death penalty.
   The state Senate had already passed the bill but will vote on it
again to concur in minor House amendments. The measure then goes to
Gov. Buddy Roemer.
   One of the three opponents, state Rep. Peppi Bruneau, said he
wasn't swayed by the argument that lethal injection is more humane
that electrocution.
   ``Why should we be concerned about doing it in a quote-unquote
humane manner?'' asked Bruneau.

<TEXT>
   LONDON (AP)_ Here is a transcript of President Bush's press
conference at the conclusion of the two-day NATO summit.
   
   President Bush: Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for hosting
this splendid meeting. And I want to express my appreciation also
to Manfred Woerner, not only for his kind remarks just now, but for
his outstanding leadership in NATO, and in this alliance, which is
at a turning point in its history.
   I'm pleased to announce that my colleagues and I have begun a
major transformation of the North Atlantic Alliance, and we view it
at a historic turning point. NATO has set a new path for peace.
It's kept the peace for 40 years, and today charted a new course
for stability and cooperation in Europe.
   We're, as you know, issuing a document, the London Declaration,
and it makes specific proposals and established directions for the
future in four key areas.
   First, the London Declaration transforms our relationship with
old adversaries. To those governments who have confronted us in the
Cold War, our alliance extends the hand of friendship. We reaffirm
that we shall never be the first to use force against other states
in Europe, and we propose a joint declaration between members of
the alliance and member states of the Warsaw Pact, which other CSCE
states could join in, in making a solemn commitment to
non-aggression. We say to President Gorbachev, ``Come to NATO!'' We
say to all the member states of the Warsaw Pacts, ``Come to NATO,''
and establish regular diplomatic liaison with the Alliance.
   And second, the London Declaration transforms the character of
NATO's conventional defenses. We can start, and must start by
finishing the current CFE talks this year, Once CFE is signed, we
would begin follow-on negotiations to adopt additional measures,
including measures to limit manpower in Europe. With this goal in
mind, a commitment will be given when the CFE treaty is signed
concerning the manpower levels of the armed forces of a united
Germany.
   We will also seek in the '90s to achieve further far-reaching
measures to limit the offensive capability of conventional armed
forces. We'll charge our strategy for conventional defense. We
agreed to move away from NATO's current strategy of forward defense
to a reduced forward presence. We agreed, in addition, to make the
principle of collective defense even more evident by organizing
NATO troops into multinational corps.
   And third, the London Declaration transforms NATO's nuclear
strategy. For 23 years we've had a nuclear strategy called
``flexible response,'' developed to meet a danger of sudden,
overwhelming conventional attack. As that danger recedes, we've
agreed to modify flexible response. Nuclear deterrence has given us
an unprecedented period of peace, and it will remain fundamental to
an unprecedented period of peace, and it will remain fundamental to
our strategy. But by reducing its reliance on nuclear weapons, NATO
in the new Europe will adopt a new strategy making its nuclear
forces truly weapons of last resort.
   This new strategy will require different forces. We've decided
that once negotiations begin on short-range nuclear forces, we are
prepared to eliminate all NATO nuclear artillery shells from Europe
in return for reciprocal action by the Soviet Union. We agreed that
this review should report its conclusions as soon as possible.
   And fourth, the London Declaration transforms the Alliance's
vision for the CSCE, and the structure for building a Europe whole
and free. We know the CSCE process, bringing together North America
and all of Europe, can provide a structure for Europe's continued
political development. And that means new standards for free
elections, the role of law, economic liberty, and environmental
cooperation. And we agreed today on six initiatives to give life to
CSCE's principles and realize its potential.
   As you can see, the London Declaration will bring fundamental
change to every aspect of the Alliance's work. This is indeed a day
of renewal for the Atlantic community. For more than 40 years we've
looked for this day, a day when we have already moved beyond
containment with unity on continent overcoming division. And now
that day is here and all peoples from the Atlantic to the Urals,
from the Baltic to the Adriatic can share in its promise.
   I'd be glad to take some questions. Helen?
   Q. Mr. President, with the end of the Cold War, the draw-down in
forces, the eventual denuclearization of Europe, are you now ready
to give some economic help, and with what other allies want, to the
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe so that they can get back on their
feet, as we did in World War II _ with Germany and Japan?
   A. Well, We have given substantial help to certain countries in
Eastern Europe. I have had a discussion, not here at NATO, but with
Mr. Gorbachev and others at different times about support for the
Soviet Union. We are most interested in helping them go forward
with their reforms. But there was no decision taken certainly to
send money to the Soviet Union. I have some big problems with that
one. I think the American people do. But there are ways that we can
assist in this transformation, in this reform that is taking place
in the Soviet Union.
   Q. But you're not opposed to other countries giving it?
   A. No, if the Germans decide they want to do that, that's their
business, but I have made very clear to those who have spoken to me
about this at this juncture, we have some serious problems and I
have not been under any false colors about that at all.
   Terry?
   Q. President Gorbachev has imposed a two-year deadline on
himself and the communist leaders for reversing their country's
economic tailspin. Does your reluctance to give the Soviets any
financial aid complicate his chances fOr success in meeting that
deadline?
   A. I hope not, because, as you know, not only have I spoken very
fondly and enthusiastically about what he's trying to do in terms
of reform, but I have spoken about him personally and about our
interest in seeing him succeed. And he's got some extraordinarily
difficult problems, but I don't think that our position on
financial aid at this time should _ hopefully, it will not
complicate his standing. He deserves support for this reform.
   Q. Do you view Western aid for the Soviet Union now as subsidy
for its military regime?
   A. Well, I'll tell you, we've got some problems that I've been
very frank with concerning the Soviets and one of them is a great
percentage of their GNP going into the military; another is some
regional problems that perhaps are unique to the United States, but
things that concern me _ spending $5 billion a year in Cuba, for
example, to sustain a totalitarian regime that is highly critical
of the Soviet Union from time to time. So we have regional
problems, we have some reform probvlems that should take place
before financial support can be given, but perhaps there are ways
that we can assist them as we go forward with credit or other
matters before we go to direct government loans.

   A man demonstrating at the State Capitol in
support of nature did it au naturel.
   The naked demonstrator climbed atop a wall flanking the capitol
steps and covered it with a red and blue banner proclaiming
``Nature's Forum.''
   He sat there in the rain for 20 minutes Thursday, until state
police arrived with a ladder. Then he descended peacefully.
   ``I thought it would be a good way to get people's attention,''
said David Hughes, 29, of Los Angeles.
   ``It's just time,'' Hughes said. ``Spiritually, people need to
come together.''
   His stunt didn't promote spiritual harmony with everyone.
   ``Mister, I don't know what you're trying to do, but defacing
our state isn't the way,'' shouted Dustin Cox, 16, of Salem.
   ``I'm not sure it really makes a point,'' said Erin Rose of
Salem. ``I think it's kind of silly when people try to draw
attention to themselves.''
   But Karl Bien, 41, of Cottage Grove, applauded the act.
   ``Anything you have to do to bring people's concern to the
environment is great,'' Bien said.
   State Police Lt. Bob Smit said statutes against disorderly
conduct and indecent exposure might apply against Hughes, who was
taken to the Oregon State Hospital for up to five days of
evaluation.

   A couple were sentenced to 10 years' probation
today for allowing their son to die while treating him with
Christian Science healing methods rather than taking him to a
doctor.
   David and Ginger Twitchell were ordered to take their surviving
children for regular medical checkups as a part of their
probationary sentence for manslaughter.
   ``We've always tried to obey the law ... and will try to obey
the judge's instructions,'' Twitchell said after leaving the
courtroom. ``We'll try to balance the law and the judge's
instructions with our trust in God.''
   Suffolk Superior Court Judge Sandra Hamlin rejected a
prosecution request that the couple be automatically jailed if they
violate any term of the probationary sentence. Instead, if there is
a violation, a hearing would be held and punishment would be
decided upon then.
   The Twitchells, both 34 and lifelong Christian Scientists, faced
up to 20 years in prison. Hamlin had indicated Thursday, however,
that she did not believe the couple should be behind bars for the
1986 death of their 2{-year-old son, Robyn.
   The couple were found guilty of manslaughter Wednesday; their
lawyer has said they would appeal.
   Under terms of the probation, Hamlin said that American Medical
Association standards should be followed for checkups of the
Twitchells' three surviving sons and any children they might have
in the future. If there was any sign of serious illness, they were
to take their children to a doctor.
   The judge said she would continue jurisdiction of the case and
wanted monthly probation reports.
   After a two-month trial, a jury found the Twitchells, former
Boston residents now living in Brentwood, N.Y., guilty of
involuntary manslaughter.
   The key issue in their trial is one continually debated by legal
scholars: Where should the government draw the line on freedom of
religion?
   Nathan Talbot, a spokesman for the Boston-based Christian
Science Church, said today's sentencing was ``the state's effort to
impose its own view.''
   ``It's an effort to re-educate Christian Scientists into the
state's view of what healing ought to be,'' he said.
   Medical experts applauded the verdict, saying it would protect
children. ``No religion is going to be allowed to be a defense
against abuse and neglect,'' said Dr. Michael Grodin, a
pediatrician and medical ethicist at Boston University. ``The
bottom line is we have to have standards for protecting children.''
   But Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law expert at Harvard, said
the decision reflects a ``fundamental unfairness'' because the
Twitchells thought they were protected by a 1971 state law that
exempted spiritual healing from child abuse statutes.
   The prosecution argued that the statute _ which states that
children will not be considered neglected or abused when ``treated
by spiritual means alone'' by an ``accredited practitioner'' _ did
not exempt the couple from manslaughter laws.
   Special Prosecutor John Kiernan said the case was not an attack
on religion, but sent the message that parents must protect their
children. ``This is not a contest between medicine and religion,
rather it is a marriage of the two,'' he said after the sentencing.
   The Twitchells were found to have caused Robyn's death by
relying solely on Christian Science spiritual healing to treat his
five-day illness. The boy died April 8, 1986. An autopsy showed he
suffered from a bowel obstruction.
   Lyons, the defense attorney, said his planned appeal would be
based on the judge's failure to consider or instruct the jury on
the spiritual healing exemption and for allowing a ``mocking and
sarcastic trial of Christian Science doctrine to occur.''
   The Twitchells were not allowed to explain their beliefs to show
the jury they acted reasonably in response to Robyn's symptoms, he
said.
   The trial received national attention in part because it was
held in Boston, the headquarters of the Christian Science Church.
The church has long taught that sickness and disease can be healed
by prayer alone.
   Church officials have said the verdict will not deter them from
practicing their religion, and expressed hope it will be overturned
on appeal.
   Since 1980, there have been seven prosecutions of Christian
Science parents. Five have been convicted, one acquitted and one
case was thrown out, according to child rights activist Rita Swan,
a former Christian Scientist who actively seeks such prosecutions.

<HEAD>Thieves Steal Ancient Jewelry From Louvre</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE GANLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dozen pieces of ancient Roman jewelry were stolen
from the Louvre Museum, officials said Friday. It was the latest in
a series of art thefts that has prompted an overhaul of security in
Paris museums.
   The second- and third-century earrings, bracelets and necklaces
were discovered missing Wednesday, the same day a Renoir was cut
from its frame at the Louvre and two other works taken from two
small museums.
   But the jewelry, found missing in an inventory check ordered
after the Renoir theft, was removed long before, said Jacques
Sallois, director of the Museums of France.
   ``The disappearance of these objects, which are not of great
value and are often seen on the market, is certainly quite old,''
Sallois said. ``It is prior to that of the paintings.''
   Shaken by thefts carried out in broad daylight, officials have
announced a series of measures to tighten security at Paris museums.
   The Interior Ministry is assigning a special police unit to work
with museum security personnel, systematic inventories are to be
carried out, and five small museums have been closed indefinitely
to individual visitors.
   ``We're not going to put a war machine behind each painting or
object, but we're going to study procedures, types of behavior that
can help us to tighten security,'' Sallois said.
   Louvre Director Michel Laclotte said the museum would shut at
least four rooms.
   ``We're trying to study with architects ways to seal off certain
spaces that are too open,'' he told reporters. ``In a palace like
the Louvre, you can't just close doors.''
   Officials estimated the worth of the stolen jewelry at about
$910 and said that, above all, it had historic value.
   Experts said the stolen paintings, a landscape and two
portraits, all small formats, were considered of limited market
value.
   The most valuable of them, Renoir's ``Portrait of a Seated
Woman,'' was estimated to be worth a few hundred thousand dollars
at most, a relatively small sum today for a well-known artist's
work.
   ``Works of great value are less negotiable,'' Laclotte noted. He
declined to say whether there were suspicions the thefts were
linked.
   Also stolen Wednesday were an 1816 landscape painting by Paul
Huet from the Carnavalet Museum, and an 1870 portrait by Ernest
Hebert from a museum named after the artist.
   Laclotte, speaking to reporters, denied that the four
consecutive thefts amounted to a ``security crisis.''
   He said the Louvre devotes $1.8 million of its annual budget to
security and had the best in human and electronic sciences at its
disposal. But he said museums cannot become impregnable bastions.
   ``All security measures are at the detriment of the art works,''
Laclotte said. ``Banditry is there. It is international.''
   At least a dozen works have been stolen from French museums over
the past year.

   Here are quotes from leaders at the NATO summit
that ended Friday.
   
   President Bush, addressing the NATO leaders' decision to use
nuclear weapons only as a last resort: ``I'm pleased to announce
that my colleagues and I have begun a major transformation of the
North Atlantic Alliance, and we view it at a historic turning
point. NATO has set a new path for peace. It's kept the peace for
40 years, and today charted a new course for stability and
cooperation in Europe.''
   
   Bush: ``Our alliance extends the hand of friendship ... We
reaffirm that we shall never be the first to use force ... NATO is
changing.''
   
   Bush, discussing the NATO leaders invitation to Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev to visit NATO: ``We say to (Soviet) President
Gorbachev, come to NATO.''
   
   In response to the invitation, Gorbachev said in Moscow: ``I am
always ready to go.''
   
   Bush, discussing his reluctance to give direct economic aid to
the Soviet Union: ``'ll tell you, we've got some problems that I've
been very frank with concerning the Soviets and one of them is a
great percentage of their GNP going into the military.''
   
   The NATO leaders' communique: ``The walls that once confined
people and ideas are collapsing ... Europeans are determining their
own destiny ... They are choosing a Europe whole and free.''
   
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher: ``NATO has defended
peace with freedom and justice but it has never threatened anyone.''
   ``The cornerstone of that sure defense must remain, for we do
not know what the future holds, but its architecture may change in
the new situation.''
   
   A British official, quoting Mrs. Thatcher who has expressed
reservations about disarming NATO too quickly: ``To remind people
of this might put me in danger of being called a Cold War warrior.''
   
   French President Francois Mitterrand, expressing reluctance to
eliminate his country's nuclear arsenal immediately: ``When others
have disarmed, those countries with enormous superiority with
regard to weaponry, then we will. It is as simple as that.''
   
   NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner: ``At long last we have
the chance to make for the first time in history military
aggression in Europe materially impossible and also politically
meaningless.''

   The FBI had to search frantically to find the
crack pipe and overlooked some of the cocaine used in the
videotaped sting against Marion Barry, an FBI agent testified today
at the mayor's drug and perjury trial.
   FBI agent Frank O. Steele said he found the crack pipe an hour
and a half after Barry's arrest at the Vista Hotel on the night of
Jan. 18.
   It was stuck inside an eyeglasses case that former model
Rasheeda Moore had put in a dresser drawer. A second crack pipe was
found in the glasses case as well. Both devices had been supplied
by the FBI to Moore for the sting operation.
   Steele's testimony came on cross-examination by lawyers for
Barry. The defense replayed segments of the FBI videotape to
suggest ineptitude by the bureau.
   Steele also testified that he checked Barry's coat pockets for
the pipe the night of the arrest. A week later, an FBI evidence
technician found crack cocaine from the sting in a pocket of the
mayor's coat. Steele said he had overlooked the pocket. It was a
small slit pocket on the inside of the garment.
   Seconds after Barry was arrested, a law enforcement officer
agent opened the dresser drawer containing the eyeglasses case, but
closed it again without checking, the FBI videotape of the sting
showed. Barry's lawyers replayed the section of the tape showing
the agent opening the drawer, apparently searching for the pipe.
   Earlier in the day, the trial judge said Nation of Islam
Minister Louis Farrakhan and Imani Temple Bishop George Stallings
will be permitted to attend the trial as long as they ``observe the
proprieties of the court.''
   Last week, U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
refused to allow the two in as spectators, saying their presence
would be potentially disruptive and was likely to be intimidating.
   He reversed himself after a court of appeals said spectators
cannot be barred merely because they advocate a particular
political or religious point of view. Farrakhan and Stallings
sought to attend the trial on passes given to Barry.
   Stallings broke away from the Washington Archdiocese of the
Roman Catholic Church a year ago, calling it hopelessly racist. He
was later excommunicated and founded Imani Temple.
   Farrakhan has ``never been a disruptive force,'' said Chicago
attorney Louis Myers, general counsel to the Nation of Islam.
   ``I felt that was insulting,'' Myers told the judge, referring
to Jackson's comment last week about disruption and intimidation.
   American Civil Liberties Union attorney Arthur Spitzer renewed a
motion for Jackson to vacate his orders of last week relating to
Farrakhan and Stallings. The judge did so without hearing any
arguments.
   ``I am prepared to grant the relief,'' said Jackson. Spitzer and
Myers assured the judge that Stallings and Farrakhan would observe
court decorum.
   ``The judge tried to establish that you can't walk into the
middle of a public trial and disrupt it,'' said John Aldock, a
private attorney representing the judge in the matter.
   ``We want to send a signal to any court of law, any other judge
in America who desires to do something similar ... we will beat
them,'' said Myers.
   The appeals court refused to order that Farrakhan and Stallings
be admitted, sending the matter back to Jackson to hear arguments
from the two black leaders.
   Barry is accused of 10 counts of cocaine possession and one
count of conspiracy. He also is on trial on three felony charges of
lying to a grand jury about his alleged involvement with drugs.

<HEAD>California Intensifies Effort to Control Problem Flies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FULLERTON, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A war on a bothersome insect called the
ash whitefly is being broadened with squadrons of tiny, stingless
wasps from the Mediterranean.
   The flies have no natural enemies in California and are a
nuisance to residents and a potential threat to the agriculture
industry, the state Department of Food and Agriculture said. They
were first detected in California in August 1988 in Los Angeles
County and have since been spotted in 17 counties and as far north
as Sacramento.
   The tiny insects suck out plant juices, infesting a variety of
trees and shrubs including apple, apricot, citrus and pear. They
can defoliate trees and clouds of the insects have driven residents
from their back yards.
   Now tiny Encarsia wasps, imported from Israel and Italy, are
being released and will be monitored to see how well they control
the ash whiteflies.
   The wasp controls the ash whitefly population by laying its eggs
inside fly larvae. After the wasps' eggs hatch, they eat their way
out of the larvae, killing the pest.
   Pesticides are not considered practical for use against the
whitefly because the pest's numbers are so large and it dwells on
the undersides of leaves.
   Six southern California counties have been targeted for
widespread release of the wasps, said Peter Stoddard, senior
environmental research scientist with the state Department of Food
and Agriculture. Additional counties will get the wasps later this
summer.
   One of the initial sites chosen for release of the wasps was the
Fullerton Arboretum on the edge of the California State University,
Fullerton campus, just southeast of Los Angeles. Hundreds of wasps
were released there Thursday.
   Wasps for future release are being reproduced at the University
of California, Riverside, and the rate of reproduction will
determine how quickly other sites will receive them, Stoddard said.
   A tiny ladybird beetle imported last year from Israel also is
being studied as a possible weapon against the fly.
   California also is waging a battle against the Mediterranean
fruit fly, using the pesticide malathion.

   A. Yes. And then I'll be over, Brit.
   Q. Mr. President, with the threat receding the way your
communique describes, do you think it's inevitable that at some
point in the next few years the Europeans will decide it's better
that American troops just go home? And what can you say to American
taxpayers to convince them that it's worth continuing to pay the
bill to have them in Europe.?
   A. Well, I don't think the American troops will stay against the
will of the host country. I don't want to see American forces
deployed where American forces are not wanted. I don't want to see
Soviet forces deployed where Soviet forces are not wanted. And I
expect the same would be true of other nationalities' forces as
well. But I don't foresee that day, because I think the Alliance
has spoken rather eloquently about the need for a common defense
and all the members of the Alliance are united in their view that a
US force presence is stabilizing and very, very important. So I
don't see that day looming up on the horizon.
   Q. But do you fear that American taxpayers support for that
continuation might be eroding?
   A. Well, I see some attacks on this and I think this NATO
declaration should help in that regard, but I view it as my
responsibility to make clear to the American taxpayer why it is in
our interest to help keep the peace. And that's exactly what these
forces are engaged in.
   Yeah, Brit. And then we'll go _
   Q. Mr. President, in light of the stress that's been placed here
on the continued cohesion within this Alliance, sir, would it not
be a major breach of that cohesion if a country like West Germany
were to provide direct aid to the Soviet union in light of the deep
concerns which you have expressed about such aid from the West?
   A. No, I don't feel that's _ (to another member of the press.)
Excuse me. I'll be back.
   I don't feel that that's a breach of Alliance cohesion. The
Germans have their own bilateral relationship with the Soviet Union
and it doesn't concern me one bit. I've not made one single effort
to try to have the Germans look differently at that question.
   Q. Mr. President, would it not than be possible that aid from
our ally, West Germany, would at least arguably or indirectly flow
to a country like Cuba?
   A. Well, if you want to say that anything that goes to the
Soviet Union facilitates aid to Cuba, I suppose we could say the
same about our trade. But that isn't _ I don't think that would be
a fair charge to make against the Germans.
   Yes? Yes, John. Excuse me.
   Q. Tonight, in an interview to be broadcast in the united
States, Fang Lizhi, the recently released Chinese dissident, says
you owe him a dinner. He couldn't make it to the one you threw in
Beijing, and he would like to be invited to the White House for
dinner. Would you do that? and I have a follow up.
   A. Well, he's _ he is here in this country. I thought he wanted
to stay out of the public eye. I thought he himself said so, so
you've got a little different information than that. We'll just
defer the rest of your question.
   Go ahead, what's your follow up?
   Q. If I can follow up, if you do meet him, he is going to
complain that you have a double standard for human rights, that you
have one standard for the Soviet Union, where you complain about
human rights violations, or have in the past _ at least,
pre-Gorbachev _ and that you don't complain so much about human
rights violations, you're not as tough with the Chinese. He
complains about sending Brent Scowcroft and Larry Eagleburger, at
cetera. What would you say to him?
   A. I'd say that he's wrong. He's got a little time warp here,
because we spoke out at the NATO meeting; indeed, I think we took
the lead at the last _ at a meeting in Europe _ I guess it was the
G-7 meeting, not NATO _ where we took the lead in expressing our
joint indignation in terms of the abuses of human rights at
Tiananmen Square. We've kept certain sanctions on China. I am
heartened that Fang Lizhi is free, and free now to say what's on
his mind like this. So I would _ I would say that if he feels that
way, he's simply not expressing the facts as they are. I don't
agree with that. I notice some of my critics in the United States
Congress say that, and I think they are just as wrong as they can
be.
   Yes, Lesley?
   Q. Mr. President _ Whoops _ back to the declaration. You are
inviting the Warsaw Pact countries to come to NATO as observers.
What if they want to become members of NATO _ Hungary, for
instance, or even Poland? Are you saying, by inviting them to
``just be observers,'' that you do not look favorably on them
becoming full members?
   A. I am saying NATO views this as an open invitation, and who
knows what will happen in terms of membership down the line. That's
not in the cards right this minute. We are just coming out of a
adversarial environment, varying _ I think there is varying degrees
of enthusiasm for what you are talking about amongst the members of
the Warsaw Pact at this juncture, so I'd say it's premature.
   Q. Well, would you oppose _ would you oppose any country, for
instance, Hungary, becoming a member of NATO?
   A. Not forever. But at this juncture, I support the NATO
doctrine.
   Q. Mr. President, in your communique, you talk about nuclear
weapons becoming truly weapons of last resort. You say the
fundamental strategy of the Alliance is being transformed there. As
part of this review, are considering going back home and taking
another look at some of the strategic nuclear modernization
programs that you have supported, looking at some of the very
expensive weapons programs that some say should be a bonus, a part
of the peace dividend?
   A. Not as a result of anything that's transpired here in NATO,
no. We are interested in strategic arms agreements with the
Soviets. The Soviets, as we all know, have indeed modernized their
forces. We are on the horns of a dilemma in that question, you
might say, because we have not to the degree they have. But that
was not a consideration here at NATO, nor has anything transpired
here that will make me go home with a different approach to
strategic arms.
   Q. Will you proceed _ if I may follow up, sir, you'll proceed
across the board with strategic modernization, your commitment to
that?
   A. I will proceed _ yeah, I will proceed in negotiating with the
Soviet _ Soviets to achieve a strategic arms agreement.
   Yes, sir?
   Q. Mr. President, how much did the threats to perestroika and
reforms in the Soviet Union play in the changes you've announced
today in NATO?
   A. You mean, is what's going on at the Congress? None, in my
view. I mean, I think this _ I think what's contributed to the NATO
_ the changes in our approach, NATO, are the changes that have
taken place, particularly since our last meeting, in terms of
Eastern Europe and in terms of the Soviets' willingness to withdraw
forces, hopefully through a CFE agreement. So, I don't think that _
I don't think anything was short _ that there was short-term
thinking as a result of the debates that are going on in Moscow
this very day.
   Q. Well, If I could follow up then, what kind of message do the
changes announced today send to Gorbachev?

   Police arrested five people this morning as
the city began enforcing a ban on sleeping in parks in an effort to
empty a downtown plaza where more than 200 people have camped out
for two years.
   Authorities said Keith McHenry, an activist who is one of the
most vocal critics of the homeless removal plan, was arrested
before 6 a.m. after about 20 officers began clearing the
tree-shaded Civic Center plaza. Four other people, all
unidentified, were arrested later.
   Police encountered no violence, Sgt. John Goldberg said.
   As an alternative to arrest for violating the public sleeping
ban, police offered vouchers for admittance to two new city
shelters.
   Thursday evening, a group of 50 activists and homeless people at
the Civic Center decided to accept the city's offer. The group
noisily marched seven blocks to one of two new shelters, where a
worker told them all the rooms were filled.
   City officials said the homeless could obtain vouchers for free
shelter elsewhere, but the group returned to the plaza _ a park
surrounded by mostly government buildings.
   ``There's no room,'' said a homeless woman, Lima Rashida. ``We
have no place to go but back to the Civic Center.''
   Police had been under orders to begin making arrests at
midnight, but after the homeless marchers were faced with no
shelter space, officers on the scene did not immediately intervene.
   Of the five people arrested later in the morning, three were
booked on misdemeanor counts of illegal lodging and interfering
with police, and McHenry and one other person was cited with
illegal distribution of food, police said.
   The march came after a peaceful candlelight vigil mourning the
death of Mitch Snyder, a homeless activist in Washington, D.C., who
was found hanged Thursday in what police said was an apparent
suicide.
   The homeless people in the plaza said they paid for a red, white
and blue wreath by selling jewelry and other personal items.
   Police Capt. Dennis Martel said the plaza transients ``don't
have the option to stay here anymore. We are encouraging them to go
to the shelters. We're handling this in a sensible, humane
fashion.''
   All this week, vouchers for rooms have been handed out, but many
of those living in the park expressed no interest.
   ``I'm safer in this park than in one of those `hotline' rooms,''
said a woman who identified herself as Jack Howard. She pledged to
stay in the plaza until police begin moving the homeless out.
   The ``hotline'' rooms are hotel rooms the city has available.
Howard says occupants are often bothered by crack dealers, rats and
mice.
   As a woman, Howard does not have access to the two male-only
``multi-service shelters'' the city took over this week.
   The shelters, operated for the city by church groups, combine
shelter with such services as drug and alcohol treatment and job
counseling.
   ``We have to have compassion because a lot of these people have
had a lot of misfortune in their lives,'' said police officer Harry
Soulette as he walked around the plaza. ``We want to help them.''
   Being turned away from the shelter reinforced what homeless
activists have said since the plan was revealed by Mayor Art Agnos
_ that the city simply doesn't have enough beds.
   Homeless advocates also charge that the ``cleanup'' program
forced 215 people already staying in one of the two shelters out on
the streets to make way for the displaced Civic Center homeless.
   In protest, the Coalition on Homelessness said it plans to
``flood the system,'' bringing in homeless people from other areas
to the Civic Center to overwhelm the new shelters, said a group
leader, Josh Brandon.
   The city's plan unfairly targets the homeless at the Civic
Center, while others throughout the city desire shelter as well, he
said.
   ``We simply want to give people who want to get off the streets
the opportunity to get off the streets,'' Brandon said.

<HEAD>Judge Steps Down from School Desegregation Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal judge who presided over
court-mandated efforts to desegregate Pulaski County public schools
for eight years stepped down Friday.
   In an order in which he announced his decision to leave the
case, U.S. District Judge Henry Woods lamented the plight of black
students in the county and criticized the federal appeals court for
stifling his orders.
   Woods, 72, said he was leaving because he was unable to
successfully implement a plan to bring educational equity to the
children of the county under the restrictions imposed by the
appeals court.
   ``Perhaps the application of a fresh mind and the perspective of
another judge can find hope in a situation which I perceive as
hopeless,'' he said.
   Woods will continue to hear his full slate of cases.
   ``It has been my intention to oversee a progressive educational
plan to serve the children of these districts into the 21st
century. Such a plan would bring peace to a community long plagued
with a worldwide reputation for racial problems in its public
schools,'' Woods said. ``However, I have steadfastly resisted the
notion of peace-at-any-price.''
   Woods' decision follows a ruling Monday by a three-judge panel
of the 8th U.S. Circuit of Appeals ordering the release of portions
of the $129 million settlement of the state's liability in the case.
   Woods presided over the case involving a federal suit filed in
1982 by the Little Rock School District against the Pulaski County
and North Little Rock districts, and the state Department of
Education. The Little Rock district sought consolidation with the
other districts in the county to achieve racial balance.
   Woods criticized Monday's order, noting that the three Pulaski
County districts have maintained that they are not required to
spend the money solely for desegregation purposes. He said the
districts will have received and spent ``tens of millions of
dollars'' by the time the full order of the court is issued in the
fall.
   ``The district court will be left ... trying to implement a
long-term desegregation plan, yet to be announced, with
insufficient funds remaining to implement any meaningful plan,'' he
said.
   The appeals court this week also hinted it would limit the
metropolitan supervisor's post _ the office Woods set up to direct
the districts' desegregation efforts _ to merely monitoring those
efforts.

   Pick an issue, and there will a demonstration to
match it during the economic summit.
   AIDS. Racial issues. Abortion. Trade.
   Summits are magnets for demonstrators, and at least five groups
have obtained parade permits. Another 17 have registered for
rallies. State and local law enforcement has been strengthened to
monitor the demonstrators. Police officers will work 12-hour shifts.
   The Ku Klux Klan says it has organized 200 to 300 members for a
march and rally on Saturday that ends at a statue of Sam Houston in
Hermann Park.
   ``We're sending a message that the white racist movement is
alive and well and is growing throughout America,'' said Texas
Grand Dragon Charles Lee. ``We think Bush and his cronies have
betrayed the American people with the open border policy and by
letting taxpayers' money go outside the country.''
   The Human RACE _ Racial Acceptance Class Equality _ planned a
``Human Summit'' on the steps of the City Hall as a
counter-demonstration to the KKK event.
   The KKK members will be bused from the suburb of Humble at
Houston expense, a decision that has infuriated some.
   Officials from Cure AIDS Now, a health care advocacy group for
people suffering from acquired immune deficiency syndrome, oppose
city financing of the KKK rally.
   ``The Klan has a right to march and make a statement, but the
city should not be providing a $50,000 bus ride for the group under
the guise of security,'' Cure AIDS Now executive director Bob Kunst
said. ``That money should be used to keep people alive with a Meals
on Wheels program for people with AIDS.''
   Kunst said his organization has set up a week's worth of
activities, including a parade and all-day rally and downtown
street dance on Sunday.
   Another AIDS advocacy group, ACT UP, plans a more vocal
counter-demonstration to the KKK at a Saturday rally. ACT UP, which
caused a stir at an AIDS convention in San Francisco last month,
also plans to ``zap'' a Catholic cathedral; protest several
pro-life activities; demonstrate at the arrivals of Bush and the
other world leaders; and ``zap'' the summit's closing gala at the
Wortham Center for the Performing Arts.
   In real Texas style, country singer Willie Nelson is
spearheading a cattle drive to dramatize opposition to proposed
changes in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   ``This whole administration is a big corporate-minded
administration,and they're not that concerned about the small
family farmer, whether he's American or Japanese,'' Nelson said.
   Environmental groups plan the Envirosummit starting Saturday
with guided tours of Houston's environmental sites. Clean Water
Action, one of the groups, plans a ``Bush's Boston Harbor'' tour of
the Houston Ship Channel on Sunday, featuring the environmental
hazards posed by refineries and other industrialists fronting the
channel.
   Then there was the broccoli summit Friday morning near the Rice
University campus that will be home to the world leaders. Broccoli
growers donated 40 tons of broccoli to local food banks in a
continued jab at President Bush, who turned his personal dislike of
the vegetable into a minor cause celebre last spring.

<HEAD>Court Awards Brezhnev's Daughter Mercedes, Dacha and Cash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court awarded the flamboyant daughter of former
Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev a luxury car, country house and
thousands of dollars in cash and collections that were confiscated
from her husband, a newspaper said Friday.
   The court said the cash and valuables rightly belonged to Galina
Brezhnev and not to her husband, Yuri D. Churbanov, who was
convicted in December 1988 of accepting bribes. He was sentenced to
12 years in a labor camp and had his property confiscated.
   Ms. Brezhnev herself has been accused in Soviet news accounts of
speculating in diamonds and has been linked to a bribery scandal
involving a gypsy performer in the Moscow circus.
   She often was seen driving the Mercedes car of her father, who
died in 1982, through the streets of Moscow.
   ``The case was banal,'' the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper
quoted the Moscow district judge as saying. ``There were no
telephone calls or threats, nothing that could sway the trial.''
   ``If it were not for the loud name of the plaintiff, I wouldn't
even remember the case,'' he was quoted as saying. ``Under the law,
Galina Brezhnev was within her rights, since most of the property
belonged to her and not her husband, and the Supreme Court had no
right after sentencing Yuri Churbanov to confiscate it.''
   The newspaper did not identify the judge.
   It said the court had ordered the government to return a country
house worth $108,474, a Mercedes car given to her father by an
unidentified foreign government, furniture and chandeliers, a
collection of weapons worth $200,000, stuffed and mounted animals
valued at $137,011 and $111,000 in savings.
   Churbanov was fired from his job as first deputy interior
minister in 1984 and tried in 1988. He was widely believed to have
been given the job because of his marriage to Brezhnev's daughter.
   Brezhnev ruled the Soviet Union from 1964 until his death, and
now is widely blamed for allowing the country to slide into
stagnation.

<HEAD>Communist North Korea Offers to Open Small Stretch of Border</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist North Korea on Friday
offered to open a small stretch of its border to promote
unification with South Korea, but its capitalist rival dismissed
the gesture as insignificant.
   The Communist overture came as the prime ministers of the two
nations prepared to hold historic talks, perhaps as early as August.
   North Korea announced it would open the northern sector of
Panmunjom, a border village, on Aug. 15, according to Naewoe Press,
a semi-official South Korean news agency that specializes in
Communist affairs.
   North Korea said the opening, about 800 yards long and 500 yards
wide, was aimed at promoting unification of the Korean peninsula
and urged South Korea to do the same, according to Naewoe.
   ``For successful progress of contact and visits between the
north and the south, we will open the portion of our side ... and
hope that the south side will take a corresponding measure,'' the
agency quoted the Communist government as saying.
   The opening, however, would not permit foreigners to travel
inland, past the perimeter of Panmunjom, a truce village that
straddles part of the 155-mile border between the two Koreas.
   The village is jointly controlled by North Korea and a United
Nations Command, comprising the United States and 15 other
countries that fought with South Korea in the 1950-53 Korean War.
No civilians may enter the area from either side without approval.
   South Korea's Defense Ministry said it had not been officially
notified of the north's plans and would not comment on whether
anyone would be allowed to cross the border.
   But a government spokesman said on condition of anonymity that
North Korea's move was ``insignificant'' because it affected only a
small, restricted section of the heavily fortified border.
   Other officials said the move was aimed at dividing opinions in
South Korea, where dissidents are pushing for free contacts with
their Communist neighbors.
   The South Korean opposition welcomed the announcement.
Dissidents asked Seoul to allow 300 people to meet with North
Koreans at the border village Aug. 15, the day in 1945 that Korea
was freed from Japanese colonial rule.
   But a spokesman for South Korea's umbrella dissident group,
Chonminyon, said the Seoul response had been negative. The South
Korean government bans unauthorized border talks with North Korea.
   After a five-month suspension, South Korean and North Korean
officials have been meeting to discuss an accord that would outline
terms for the first talks between their prime ministers.
   On Tuesday, the Koreas agreed in principle to hold the prime
ministers' meeting, possibly in August in Seoul. They agreed to
adopt a formal accord July 26.
   Talks have been held sporadically between the two Koreas, but
little progress had been made until recently. The border on both
sides is heavily fortified and sealed, blocking exchanges of mail
and transportation.
   North Korea is one of the last totalitarian Communist states,
and sweeping changes in Eastern Europe and its socialist allies
have made little impact.
   The two Koreas are still technically at war. No peace treaty has
been signed since the three-year Korean War ended in 1953.

<HEAD>Government Group Suggests Charging Calif. Motorists in War Against
Smog</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Motorists in Southern California who run
errands or commute alone during rush hour should be penalized
financially, a smog-reduction task force recommended.
   ``Over 70 percent of our air pollution problem is caused by
mobile sources,'' said Judy Wright, who led the group set up by the
Southern California Association of Governments.
   ``There aren't many more smokestacks to go after, so we have to
go after the mobile sources.''
   Wright suggested that one way to penalize motorists would be
through extra fees on a toll road or bridge if the driver is alone
in the car.
   Stickers would show whether a vehicle was authorized to be on
the road during specific hours. The driver could be fined if found
driving during unauthorized times, she said.
   The task force suggested test projects in western San Bernardino
County, which has many homes and relatively few jobs, and in Los
Angeles County's South Bay area, which has lots of jobs, but few
homes. Both areas are besieged by commuter traffic.
   The association set up the task force last year after another
agency, the South Coast Air Quality Management District, issued a
long-term plan for cutting smog.
   The recommendations won't go into effect for at least a year and
perhaps longer, said association spokesman Mario Guerra.
   ``We probably won't see a lot happening for a while, but the
proposals are important because they recognize that driving is a
right, not a responsibility, and people need to realize that,''
Guerra said.

<HEAD>Unemployment Drops Slightly to 5.2 Percent in June</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's unemployment rate edged downward
to 5.2 percent last month despite an ongoing slide in manufacturing
and overall weakness in job growth, the government reported Friday.
   Fewer Americans looking for work _ not any rebound in sluggish
economic activity _ accounted for the improvement over May's
jobless rate of 5.3 percent, analysts said.
   ``It's not that more people are getting jobs, fewer guys are
looking,'' said Elliott Platt, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin
&amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. of New York.
   The economy added just 40,000 jobs to non-farm payrolls in June,
the Labor Department said.
   However, that figure would be closer to 97,000 if the temporary
census workers the federal government laid off in June were not
included in the count, the agency said.
   For the first six months of 1990, private sector businesses have
been adding about 110,000 jobs a month, or about half the 220,000
average jobs gain for the same period last year, the government
said.
   ``There's no real zip in this economy, but you don't have the
combination of recessionary forces to drag it into negative
territory, either,'' Platt said.
   The report's evidence of continued softness, at a time when
unemployment is still relatively low, provides a puzzling picture
for the Federal Reserve, which has been under pressure to lower
interest rates, analysts said.
   ``The Fed is in a quandary now. From the job creation side, it's
a clear case for the Fed to ease. But with unemployment so low,
it's a very tough call,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the
Boston Co.
   Sinai said June's job growth figures demonstrate that the
economy is ``as close to a recession configuration as we can get
without being in one.''
   Revised figures for May showed that about 155,000 new jobs were
added that month, excluding census workers, up from the original
report of just 19,000 jobs, the Labor Department said.
   Unemployment has been fluctuating within a tenth of a percentage
point of 5.3 percent for more than a year after hitting a 15-year
low of 5 percent in March 1989.
   The rate has managed to stay relatively low, despite weak job
growth, because smaller numbers of Americans are entering the labor
force, said Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor
Statistics.
   So far this year, only about 290,000 Americans have entered the
work force, compared with the 1.5 million Americans who joined the
labor force during the first half of 1989, Mrs. Norwood said. The
labor force is defined as Americans who are working or actively
seeking jobs.
   The nation's manufacturing sector, which has been on a downward
spiral for months, continued its slide in June as factory payrolls
fell by 31,000 jobs. It was the 14th time in 15 months that
manufacturing jobs declined.
   Since reaching a post-recession peak in March 1989, about
335,000 factory jobs have been lost.
   The number of construction jobs fell in June for the fourth
month in a row, reflecting continued weakness in the housing
market, the government said. Construction payrolls, after seasonal
adjustment, dropped 14,000.
   Meanwhile, the service sector, which has been providing most of
the economy's steam over the past several months, added 83,000
jobs, including 40,000 in the health services industry.
   Retail trade businesses lost 7,000 jobs in June, bringing the
monthly increases in the first half of this year in that sector to
15,000, half the average for 1989.
   General merchandise stores have been particularly hard hit in
that sector, losing 50,000 jobs over the past year, Mrs. Norwood
said.
   The number of discouraged workers _ people who want a job but
have given up looking _ averaged about 900,000 for the April to May
period, an increase of nearly 150,000 over the first quarter of
1990, the agency said.
   That increase brought the number of discouraged workers to its
highest level since the end of 1988.
   Labor costs, which have been pushing up and are being blamed for
fueling the nation's inflation problems, continued to increase.
Average hourly earnings posted a 0.3 percent rise in June to
$10.01, up from the $9.98 the average worker earned per hour in May.
   The average manufacturing work week was unchanged from May at
41.0 hours. Manufacturing overtime held at 3.8 hours in June.
   In a separate calculation of unemployment that counts members of
the armed services stationed in the United States, the June jobless
rate was 5.1 percent, down from 5.3 percent in May and the same as
June's civilian rate.

   Like the grubby beggars on the streets
thrusting out their plastic coffee cups, Mitch Snyder was a goad.
   Unlike them, he would not be brushed aside.
   He made the destitute of this city visible. He got a roof over
their heads.
   He could be a nuisance. He could exasperate the city and the
citizenry. He drove critics and allies to distraction by an
insistent demand that the homeless be accorded the respect due
humankind.
   Now that he is dead, it dawned on Washington _ Washington the
community, not Washington the world capital _ what he meant to this
city.
   The dispossessed will have to fend for themselves. And so will
the possessed. The goad is gone. It will be up to people to see the
helpless poor without him.
   By common estimate, 15,000 homeless people live on the streets
and grates of Washington.
   One of Snyder's triumphs was the enactment of a 1984 law _ by
the citizens, in an initiative, over the objections of officialdom
_ compelling the city to guarantee them an indoor place to spend
the night.
   Of that number, 1,200 found a spot in the shelter that Snyder,
in his guerrilla warfare, wrestled from Ronald Reagan in 1984.
   He did that by fasting for 51 days. Snyder looked then like he
was nearly dead. CBS cameras were about to capture the showdown for
``60 Minutes.'' The presidential election was two days off.
   Reagan capitulated and gave Snyder's outfit, the Community for
Creative Non-Violence, a tumbledown federal building a few blocks
from the Capitol for use as a shelter and $6 million to
rehabilitate it.
   Rep. E. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., didn't like the show boating. He
called Snyder ``a masochist who influences government by
threatening to starve himself.''
   Snyder had a genius for attracting attention. But no one ever
accused him of capitalizing on the poor. He hobnobbed with
celebrities, coming to their parties in the wrinkled clothes given
to the shelter. He always needed a shave.
   He held public funerals for homeless people who died on the
streets in the cold. He scavenged through dumpsters with members of
Congress. Once, he got movie stars to spend a night sleeping on the
street. He got Cher to dish out the mashed potatoes at Christmas
dinner at the shelter.
   He got the Navy to alter plans to name a new nuclear submarine
Corpus Christi, after the city in Texas. He said no warship should
bear the name ``the body of Christ,'' and the Navy changed it to
the USS City of Corpus Christi. That fast lasted only 11 days.
   But angry, scornful, confrontational Mitch Snyder had failures,
too. He walked out of a middle-class marriage, leaving behind in
New York City two small children and forcing his wife onto welfare.
He said he could not spend his life selling Electrolux vacuum
cleaners and Maytag washing machines.
   Eleven days ago, Snyder suffered his greatest defeat. He could
not keep the city council from voting to gut the homeless shelter
law or slashing spending on the destitute.
   The change, awaiting Mayor Marion Barry's signature, would
require homeless people to go though a screening process before
being approved for shelter.
   Washington has accustomed itself to the sight of people sleeping
on the streets. The outrage and passion have diminished.
   There were suggestions that difficulties with Carol Fennelly,
Snyder's companion for 15 years, led him to take his life.
   In his room at the shelter where he hanged himself, Snyder left
behind a note discussing his failed love relationship with Ms.
Fennelly, police sources said. He was 46.
   Maybe he was a victim of that disease of the upwardly mobile:
burnout. He had been at it for 17 years.

   Gov. Buddy Roemer kept his word today
and vetoed a tough anti-abortion bill but held off delivering his
veto message to the Legislature, an administration attorney said.
   Roemer can hold on to the veto message for two days after
signing it, said John Kennedy, a special counsel to the governor.
   If the legislators don't get the veto message until Sunday, they
would have only the rest of the day Sunday and all day Monday to
consider it before they must adjourn for the year at midnight
Monday.
   ``We're not ready to deliver the message just yet,'' said
Kennedy.
   Throughout the legislative session that began in April, Roemer
had said he would veto an abortion bill that didn't make exceptions
for victims of rape or incest.
   The bill eventually passed by the legislature contained no such
exceptions, and would send abortionists to prison for up to 10
years. It allows abortions only to save the life of the mother.
   Roemer's decision not to immediately issue the veto message left
open the question of when anti-abortion supporters would be able to
attempt an override. House and Senate leaders were waiting for the
veto message to schedule debates on an override attempt. It takes a
two-thirds vote in each chamber _ 26 of 39 senators and 70 of 105
representatives _ to override a veto.
   No Louisiana governor's veto has been overridden this century.
   Rep. Woody Jenkins, a key backer of the bill, had said Thursday
that he planned to ask the House to debate and vote on an override
on Saturday, assuming the veto message was received in time to do
so.
   Should the House vote to override Saturday, Jenkins had said, he
would then want the Senate to take up the issue Sunday or Monday.
   Roemer has said during the past week that he would give
lawmakers ample time to consider and vote on an override.

   Boris N. Yeltsin warned Communist Party
traditionalists Friday that the price of their intransigence will
be nationalization of party property and demands that they stand
trial for ruining Soviet society.
   Yeltsin brought the wave of public indignation that propelled
him to the presidency of the huge Russian republic to the fifth day
of the 28th Communist Party congress at the Kremlin's Palace of
Congresses.
   Reformers got their chance to fight back against the Communist
traditionalists who dominated the first week of the congress and
blamed Mikhail S. Gorbachev for the party's loss of popularity and
ideological drift.
   ``It is an illusion to think that after all dissenters, all who
do not wish to be drive belts and cogs of the apparatus, quit the
party, it will retain all the property of the Soviet Communist
Party and the associated authority,'' he said.
   ``It will not be so. If this is the case ... the people will
start struggling for the full nationalization of the property of
the party,'' Yeltsin said. ``The party will be bankrupt, obliged to
repay its debts to the people, if only with its property.''
   ``An effort might be made to prosecute party leaders at every
level for the damage they personally have inflicted on the party
and the people,'' he said.
   Yeltsin's warning was a prediction of a day of reckoning for the
Communist Party, which nationalized property and violently
repressed its enemies when it seized power under Lenin in 1917.
   Gorbachev, a frequent target of Yeltsin's populist demands for
quicker and more comprehensive reform, was unimpressed by his
speech. ``I expected more,'' he told reporters in a stroll outside
the congress hall.
   Delegate Yuri Boldyrev of Leningrad had urged the
nationalization of party property on the first day of the congress.
Party officials estimate the value of the property at $8.2 billion.
   Leaders of Democratic Platform, a radical group that has
declared its intention to split from the party, say one of the key
tactical questions is how to lay a claim to some of the party's
vast holdings of newspapers, the best buildings in cities all
around the country, a huge fleet of cars and bank accounts.
   Yeltsin warned that Soviet Communists are blindly following
their Eastern European comrades down the road to oblivion.
   ``If you think there is a different possibility, look at the
fate of the Communist parties of Eastern Europe. They separated
themselves from the people, didn't understand their role, and were
left on the side of the road,'' he said.
   The only way out, he said, is for the Communist Party to fully
accept all the trappings of the multiparty system that party
leaders endorsed earlier this year.
   Yeltsin read rapidly and with little emotion from a prepared
text. More than 4,600 delegates in the congress hall listened
intently, but reflecting the traditionalist mood of the congress,
gave him only a smattering of applause.
   Backing up Yeltsin's warning, a leader of the Democratic
Platform reform group and an actor who is an outspoken supporter of
Gorbachev also took the floor.
   Vyacheslav Shostakovsky, rector of Moscow's Higher Party School,
urged the party to abandon its stifling ideology.
   ``No ideological cow will give us milk or meat,'' he said.
   Actor Mikhail Ulyanov accused traditional-minded Communists of
trying to return to decades of repression.
   ``Hardly had our people begun to straighten up when voices rang
out, blaming Gorbachev for letting the reins slip from his grasp,
for allowing the country to be plunged into chaos and anarchy, and
for the collapse of socialist ideals,'' he said.
   ``Deep in their minds, however, they're thinking how to return
to the iron fist, regular columns and uniformity,'' he charged.
   Alexei Sergeyev, a leader of an orthodox Communist movement
formed in Leningrad, accused Democratic Platform of being ``openly
pro-capitalist,'' and charged that the Soviet government's economic
program resembles its approach.
   Yeltsin has said he is ready to suspend his party membership if
the party does not seriously reform itself at the congress.
   Walking out of the congress hall after his speech, the
59-year-old populist predicted Democratic Platform will leave the
party and join an alliance of more democratic-minded political
parties.
   At a news conference, Democratic Platform leaders said they
would found their own party at a gathering this fall.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration said Friday it is
planning to enhance current seafood inspections with a voluntary
program paid for by companies whose products could earn an official
government seal.
   The new program would use industry controls and government
inspections ``to provide additional assurances to consumers that
fish and fish products are safe, wholesome and properly labeled,''
officials said.
   The program was proposed by the Food and Drug Administration and
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   The FDA has a seafood inspection program that requires
examinations of processors, shippers, packers and repackers,
labelers, warehouses and importers of fish and fish products. That
program would continue separately.
   NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service runs a voluntary,
fee-for-service seafood inspection program, which uses a government
inspection mark. That program would continue to provide grading
services, but continuation of other parts of the program would
depend on the extent to which companies switch to the new system,
officials said.
   The new plan would be based on inspections at various critical
points at which health risks, such as spoilage and bacterial
growth, can be controlled, the FDA said. Companies would pay a fee
for inspections and could earn an official mark or seal they could
display on their product's label.
   The FDA said a two-month pilot study is scheduled to begin Oct.
1 to identify problems industry and government might have in
implementing such a system. The agencies are looking for industry
volunteers for the study.
   Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, a consumer group,
criticized the plans, saying the government should instead
strengthen its mandatory inspection system.
   ``It's like putting a Band-Aid on a festering sore,'' said Ellen
Haas, executive director of the group.
   ``It's a totally inadequate response to a serious public health
problem,'' she said. ``What consumers need is not a voluntary
program paid for by those fish companies that chose to participate,
but a mandatory, health-based inspection program such as ones being
considered in Congress.''

<HEAD>Endorsement of `Last Resort' Doctrine</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The NATO leaders endorsed an historic change in policy by
pledging to use nuclear weapons only as a ``last resort,'' rather
than maintaining uncertainty over when the arms would be deployed.
The change is designed to reassure the Soviet Union that the
Western alliance is not a poised military threat.

   Western leaders invited Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to
address a meeting of the alliance, probably in December. In Moscow,
Gorbachev said he was always ready to go.

<HEAD>Reduction of Troops in Unified Germany</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Once the United States and the Soviet Union sign a treaty to
limit the number of troops in Europe _ probably next fall _ talks
will begin to reduce the army of a unified Germany. Sources say the
combined Germany will have a military force of no more than
400,000, down from about 565,000.

   The summiteers praised Gorbachev's reforms, but offered no
direct financial assistance to the Soviet Union. Diplomatic sources
said Gorbachev had appealed for financial aid. President Bush said
he was reluctant to give money to the Soviet Union until Moscow
stops helping Cuba, among other things. But Bush said perhaps there
was a way to help Gorbachev with credits and other guarantees.

   s.
   LONDON (AP) _ The NATO allies pledged Friday to sharply reduce
both nuclear and conventional defenses in Europe, extending ``the
hand of friendship'' to Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the rest of
Eastern Europe.
   Solemnly, President Bush and his 15 Western alliance partners
assured the Soviet leader, who is under attack from left and right
at the 28th Communist Party Congress in Moscow, that they hold ``no
aggressive intentions'' and ``will never in any circumstance be the
first to use force.''
   In Moscow, Gorbachev said he was ready to accept the leaders'
invitation to address a meeting of the Western alliance, probably
in December. And Soviet foreign ministry spokesman Gennady
Gerasimov said, ``We welcome the results of the (NATO) session.''
   But Gorbachev could take little comfort from Bush's comment that
he had ``big problems'' with the idea of direct Western economic
aid to the Soviet Union _ a subject likely to dominate the Houston
economic summit where Bush and many of the other Western leaders
were flying after the NATO meeting.
   In London, the allies agreed to shrink their arsenal of
battlefield nuclear weapons _ in tandem with Soviet action _ and
relegate them to highly unlikely last-resort use.
   They also said, in their windup communique, that ``once
negotiations begin on short-range nuclear forces, the alliance will
propose, in return for reciprocal action by the Soviet Union, the
elimination of all its nuclear artillery shells from Europe.''
   They also decided to field smaller and restructured ground
forces, in the newest sign that NATO's 40-year job of containing
potential Soviet-bloc aggression was nearing a successful end.
   One shift in NATO doctrine, away from a quarter-century threat
to use nuclear weapons promptly if attacked, drew most of the
notice. More subtle but also significant was the decision to
abandon the strategy of massing troops up against the East-West
frontier, switching to smaller mobile units further back.
   ``Allied leaders will have maximum flexibility in deciding how
to respond to a crisis,'' the communique said.
   And, in a surprise move designed to allay one of Gorbachev's
deepest concerns, the NATO allies agreed to set a limit on the size
of Germany's military forces. That could mean a cut of more than
160,000 soldiers from the combined troops of East and West Germany
after merger.
   However, despite Gorbachev's still-unsuccessful effort to pump
life into the Soviet economy, Bush distanced himself from a plan
devised by West Germany and France to provide Moscow with a
bountiful package of direct financial assistance that could run
into billions of dollars.
   ``I have big problems with that one,'' Bush said. ``I think the
American people do,'' because of the Soviet Union's financial
support of Cuba and because of its military spending at home. But
the president said he would consider credits or technical help for
the Soviets.
   The economic summit next week, bringing together leaders from
the seven richest democracies in the world, will have Gorbachev's
economic restructuring program at the top of the agenda.
   Bush said he hoped his resistance to direct U.S. assistance
would not impede Gorbachev, who this week gave himself a two-year
deadline to succeed.
   ``I have spoken very fondly and enthusiastically about what he's
trying to do in terms of reform,'' Bush said at a news conference
after the allied leaders adopted their history-making ``Declaration
on a Transformed North Atlantic Alliance.''
   The document's many concessions to Moscow, which won support
even from cautious British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,
reflected a joint judgment that ``the Soviet Union has embarked on
the long journey to a free society.''
   Together, the allies offered a pledge of non-aggression to each
of the seven members of the Warsaw Pact. One of the innovative
decisions taken at the summit was to establish liaisons to those
that wish to establish closer political links to Western Europe.
   The gesture seemed tailored to Hungary, Czechoslovakia and
Poland, all of which have adopted democratic governments while
maintaining tenuous ties to Moscow.
   ``The London declaration transforms our relationship with old
adversaries,'' Bush said. ``To those governments who confronted us
in the Cold War, our alliance extends the hand of friendship.''
   The communique also used the ``hand of friendship'' phrase.
   Even so, hundreds of short-range nuclear weapons will remain in
NATO's arsenal. The purpose, Mrs. Thatcher said at a separate news
conference, is that ``anyone who wanted to cross our borders could
never be certain that nuclear weapons could not be used ... against
him.''
   Bush is planning the production of new air-to-surface nuclear
missiles, and sea-launched U.S. cruise missiles are taking over the
mission of nuclear-tipped artillery shells that will be withdrawn
as Soviet troops and tanks leave Eastern and Central Europe.
   And French President Francois Mitterrand told reporters that his
country had no intention of reducing its sizable nuclear arsenal
until the Soviet Union and the United States take such steps.
   ``When others have disarmed, those countries with enormous
superiority with regard to weaponry, then we will,'' Mitterrand
said. ``It's as simple as that.''
   The United States is in the midst of negotiations with the
Soviet Union to cut long-range missiles, bombers and submarines.
Separate talks between NATO and the Warsaw Pact in Vienna are aimed
at reducing U.S. and Soviet troops and such non-nuclear arms as
tanks and helicopters by the end of the year.
   Bush said he would be in touch with Gorbachev over the next few
weeks. ``They ought not to view NATO as a threat and certainly
ought not to view it as a roadblock to progress in arms control or
withdrawal of conventional forces or whatever it might be,'' the
president said.

   Bill Monroe, founder of bluegrass music,
is making the move to the big screen.
   A film crew from Caporeale Studios of Cincinnati is in Nashville
interviewing friends of the Grand Ole Opry great and gathering film
footage for a documentary on Monroe's life.
   ``Bill's somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 years old,'' said
studio official Tom McGrail. ``He's afraid he might not be around
much longer, and he's looking at this as his legacy.''
   Monroe, who turns 79 in September, will be filmed performing
this weekend at the Long Hollow Jamboree, the Grand Ole Opry and at
a bluegrass festival Saturday at the Opryland U.S.A. theme park.
   McGrail said his crew already has interviewed Ralph Stanley,
Emmylou Harris and ``a bunch of other bluegrass luminaries.''
Others to be interviewed include Ricky Skaggs and Wynnona and Naomi
Judd.
   ``Bill's a regular, old-fashioned radio cowboy,'' McGrail said.
``We've never seen him without his white hat. And he does a great
stone face.''

   Harry Connick Jr., who has been described by
some critics as the new Frank Sinatra, says he's such a Sinatra
``freak'' that he has daydreamed of breaking into Ol' Blue Eyes'
house.
   ``I just want to touch him,'' the singer, songwriter and pianist
said in an interview with USA Weekend magazine. ``I just want to
touch him. I just want to say, `Mr. Sinatra, you're the king.'''
   Another of the young performer's dreams: to sing ``Luck be a
Lady'' on stage with Sinatra.
   But Connick, 22, who won a Grammy for the music to the movie
``When Harry Met Sally,'' is no Beatles fan. ``That music is for

   Billy Joel has finished the Atlanta leg of his
``Storm Front'' concert tour, but the singer may have to make
another Atlanta date _ in Fulton County Superior Court.
   Joel's former manager and one-time brother-in-law, Frank Weber,
filed an $11 million lawsuit against the rock star claiming breach
of contract in his firing.
   Joel sued Weber in September for $90 million, claiming Weber
used the entertainer's money for interest-free loans, signed Joel's
name to documents without consent and put the singer's money in
high-risk investments despite instructions to invest conservatively.
   Weber's suit, filed Tuesday, contends Joel dismissed the manager
without cause and that Weber is entitled to 20 percent of Joel's
gross income because Frank Management planned the singer's Atlanta
tour.
   Daniel A. Gecker, an attorney representing Weber, said he chose
to sue in Atlanta because ``the Atlanta docket moves a lot faster
than the New York courts do.''
   A similar lawsuit was dismissed in Richmond earlier this year
for lack of jurisdiction, he said.
   Jane Sanders, a New York attorney representing Joel, said: ``We
view it as harassing tactics and a way to find a another judge to
act in his behalf.''

   Where can you buy official ``Do The Right
Thing'' T-shirts and other memorabilia from Spike Lee films? Do you
know? Do you know? Do you know?
   The answer: Spike's Joint, a store Lee plans to open July 22,
one day before the debut of his latest film, ``Mo' Better Blues.''
   The store will sell hats, buttons, T-shirts and other items from
Lee's movies. It also will feature Lee's preferred headgear _
Brooklyn Dodgers' baseball caps.
   The store is far from New York's tourist attractions but only a
block from the offices of Lee's 40 Acres and a Mule movie company
in Brooklyn's Fort Greene section.
   Lee's previous sales experience includes pitching Air Jordan
athletic shoes for Nike, in a commercial that let him reprise a
line from the movie ``She's Gotta Have It.'' Do you know?

   A policeman who thought he was stopping
an underage driver's summer joyride found he had pulled over actor
Gary Coleman.
   ``He was so small,'' said Undersheriff Santos Baca. ``He had a
pillow he was sitting on.''
   Coleman, 22, is only about 4-foot-7 as a result of kidney
disease and other health problems. Baca saw the ``Diff'rent
Strokes'' television star behind the wheel of a rental car he was
driving Thursday on Interstate 25 just north of Albuquerque.
   ``I could barely see him in there,'' Baca said.
   The undersheriff said Coleman politely explained he was heading
from Dallas to Denver to visit his parents. He showed Baca a
Colorado driver's license that listed his occupation as actor.
   ``Right away he struck me as a funny guy because he asked me,
`What are you a policeman or a fireman?' He wanted to know if he
was speeding,'' said Baca, who amiably sent Coleman on his way.

   Finally, some good news for Donald Trump. The
cash-starved developer won a real estate tax fight with the city
and saved $1.2 million on his 1989 taxes.
   Trump's 56-acre waterfront property on Manhattan's Upper West
Side, assessed by the city at $44 million, was instead taxed at a
rate $12.5 million lower after Trump made his case before the city
Tax Commission.
   Trump was one of 19,306 taxpayers who won assessment battles
with the city for 1989. The full list of the winners _ which
included the Andy Warhol estate and Alex DiLorenzo, owner of the
building that housed the Happy Land Social Club where 86 people
died in an arson fire _ was released June 29.
   Trump, whose cash flow problems have been well documented, saved
$1.2 million in taxes with the re-evaluation, the city Finance
Department said.
   But that money went right back to the city Thursday, when Trump
made a multimillion dollar semiannual property tax payment. Trump
shelled out $2.2 million for his undeveloped West Side property, $1
million for Trump Tower and $900,000 for the Trump Parc
condominiums.

<HEAD>NATO Pledges German Troop Cut Commitment, Kohl Wants Missiles Out</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO leaders promised Friday to spell out by
autumn plans for massive German troop cuts in a move hailed by
Chancellor Helmut Kohl as an ``indispensable signpost'' on the path
to German unification.
   The allied leaders' agreement to set such a timetable as part of
the summit-ending communique was another dramatic effort to allay
Soviet anxieties about the looming merger of two Germanys.
   Kohl, the chancellor of West Germany, also urged the withdrawal
of short-range U.S. missiles from his country.
   The communique included a commitment to come up with a troop
level for a unified Germany by fall. Those force levels will in
turn become part of a new round of negotiations with the Soviets on
reducing overall troop levels of both alliances.
   Bonn's defense minister, Gerhard Stoltenberg, has agreed to cut
more than 160,000 from the current combined forces of West and East
Germany, down to 400,000. Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher
has said an even greater cut _ to 350,000 troops _ is acceptable.
   Kohl will discuss it during a July 15 visit to Moscow in an
attempt to clear away Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
objections to NATO membership for the country expected to emerge
later this year.
   The Soviets, who still mourn their more than 20 million dead in
World War II, fear a united German military in central Europe.
   But Kohl, while insisting on NATO membership for a unified
Germany, will point to the changes adopted at the two-day summit
aimed at making the alliance less threatening to the Kremlin.
   The democratically elected governments in Czechoslovakia, Poland
and Hungary, in fact, would prefer keeping the mammoth new German
state with nearly 80 million people embedded in the Western
Alliance, Kohl said.
   ``For many people, having a strong NATO roof over Germany is
better than isolation,'' he told reporters in London.
   ``This is a wide-ranging offer,'' said Kohl of NATO's new
stance. ``This is NATO offering a hand.''
   Kohl called the commitment ``an indispensable signpost along the
path leading to German unity.''
   Seeking to appease West Germans who for years have chafed
against nuclear missiles in their country, Kohl also called for the
removal of 700 aging American short-range nuclear missiles from his
territory.
   The Lance missiles are only capable of hitting neighboring
Czechoslovakia and East Germany, both of which have undergone major
pro-democracy reforms.
   Only a few months ago, Kohl secured a U.S. promise not to
replace the missiles, which will become technically obsolete by
1995 anyway.
   The United States is also removing medium-range nuclear missiles
from West Germany, and is willing to talk with the Soviets about
ridding Europe of nuclear-tipped artillery shells. Most of the
1,470 American shells are in West Germany.
   Nonetheless, the chancellor urged the Americans to keep some
forces in Europe, or, as he put it, to maintain ``an apartment in
the European house.''
   Kohl lavished praise on President George Bush, saying the U.S.
president has a clear view of the changes in Europe. ``The
chemistry is right'' between both men, he said.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev indicated Friday he would
accept an invitation to visit NATO headquarters, and a Foreign
Ministry spokesman said the alliance summit had bolstered the
Soviet leader's position at home.
   Gorbachev, speaking during a break in the Communist Party
congress, said he had not received a formal invitation yet but, ``I
am always ready to go.''
   NATO leaders, ending talks in London Friday, approved a
statement that proposed a mutual non-aggression pact with the
Soviet Union and extended the unprecedented invitation to Gorbachev
and other Warsaw Pact leaders.
   Leaders of the rival alliance were invited to visit North
Atlantic Treaty Organization headquarters in Brussels, Belgium,
probably in December.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said in Moscow
the Soviet Union welcomed the summit conclusions ``as a practical
step toward re-examining the philosophy of confrontation in
Europe.''
   He said the session ``helps Gorbachev's position'' in the Soviet
Union.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said in a statement
carried by the official news agency Tass that the NATO summit's
decisions were ``realistic and constructive.''
   ``The decisions adopted move in the right direction and pave the
way to a safe future for the entire European continent,'' he said.
   He welcomed NATO's appeal for a joint declaration with the
Warsaw Pact saying the two sides are no longer opponents and
pledging to refrain from the threat or use of force.
   Gerasimov said NATO's moves away from military confrontation
were an answer to Soviet officers who have complained recently that
the country's foreign policy under Gorbachev has consisted mainly
of concessions.
   ``The results of the NATO session show that our good example
brings answering steps from NATO,'' he said.
   Valentin Falin, a top party official for foreign affairs, was
less enthusiastic. He told reporters that NATO was mainly at the
stage of making promises hinging on future Soviet behavior.
   ``You can't build a house out of `if's,''' he said, adding that
nonetheless, the NATO communique was a sign of progress.
   On Thursday, several military officers speaking at section
meetings during the Communist Party congress blasted Gorbachev's
foreign policy for weakening the country's defenses and letting
Eastern Europe slip away.
   Major Gen. Ivan Nikulin, chief political officer of the Soviet
Union's southern army group, warned that the Soviet Union was
allowing an upset in the military balance of Europe.
   He rejected Gorbachev's idea of a ``common European home'' as a
``myth,'' and warned that one-sided Soviet concessions would lead
to the Soviet Union being pushed out of Europe instead of joined
with it.
   ``The successes of Soviet diplomacy on the international scene
were mostly due to its ability to give in,'' the Interfax news
service quoted one of Gorbachev's critics as saying.
   Falin said the officers opinions ``don't reflect the opinion of
the majority of the armed forces and naturally don't play a
definitive role in the formulation of the practical actions of the
Defense Ministry.''
   Gerasimov formally announced that NATO's secretary-general,
Manfred Woerner, would come to Moscow on July 14 to continue the
London forum.
   Gorbachev reportedly appealed for economic aid in a letter to
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at the NATO meeting.
   Ivan K. Polozkov, head of the Russian republic's Communist
Party, told reporters he backed the idea of Western aid for the
ailing Soviet economy.
   ``I think we have no basis to refuse aid if it's proposed,''
said Polozkov, considered a leading hard-liner in the party.
   Falin, asked if he was worried the Soviet Union's image would be
tarnished if it accepted Western aid, said he was not concerned.
``I think not one pearl will fall from our crown if we take the
hand held out to us,'' he said.
   The issue of Western economic aid to the Soviet Union was not
resolved at the London meeting, and is expected to be tackled at an
economic summit of seven major industrial democracies that opens in
Houston on Monday.

   Traditionally at international gatherings there's
not much love lost between French President Francois Mitterrand and
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   But at the NATO summit, nuclear weapons brought them together,
both jealously guarding domestic arsenals and both uneasy about the
alliance's decision to rely on the armaments only as a ``last
resort.''
   Mrs. Thatcher had qualms. But she went along with the decision
announced at the end of a two-day summit Friday, saying it was
acceptable because NATO kept the option of using nuclear weapons.
   But Mitterrand remained flatly opposed. He said the last resort
concept ``seems to me to be totally contradictory to French
strategy, which is not to take the initiative to use force, but to
bring out whatever force is necessary when appropriate.''
   ``Great Britain and France had similar positions,'' he said,
adding that Mrs. Thatcher voted in favor of the strategy switch
while he voted against it ``both because of strategic differences
of opinion and because we are not part of the command.''
   France's withdrawal of its forces from the NATO joint military
command in 1966 is a sore point with Mrs. Thatcher and is usually
good for a British jibe.
   Instead, at her end-of-summit news conference Friday, she merely
noted wistfully that French forces remained outside the NATO
command. The position wouldn't change, and ``we accept it,'' she
said.
   Then she launched into lavish praise of France for, she said,
persuading West Germany to deploy U.S. nuclear missiles in the
early 1980s.
   ``The fact that she (France) had a slightly different position
in NATO was used to advantage and she was able to do a certain
amount of persuasion which ... may continue to be very helpful in
the future,'' said Mrs. Thatcher.
   It was a far cry from frequent testiness between the British
Conservative Party leader and the French Socialist.
   They met again at the NATO summit fresh from their latest spat
at a meeting of the leaders of the 12-nation European Community in
Dublin, Ireland, 10 days ago.
   In Dublin, Mrs. Thatcher played a prime role in getting a
French-West German proposal for an immediate $15 billion in Soviet
aid sidelined.
   She and Mitterrand also renewed exchanges over what he sees as
her constant efforts to put the brake on European unity and what
she sees as grandiose rhetoric from a country as eager to preserve
its national identity as anyone else.
   Mitterrand said Mrs. Thatcher was isolated in Dublin although
she got her way on the Soviet aid proposal.
   Mrs. Thatcher brushed this aside. When reporters asked her about
reported crusty exchanges in closed session, she said: ``Ah, yes,
President Mitterrand. ... We usually have something.''
   In London, they found they had a lot in common. After the
centuries-old shared history of friendship and rivalry, the two
former colonial powers now share a status as the only nations in
Western Europe with their own nuclear arsenals.
   And the two leaders share a wariness about letting down their
military guard.
   Said Mitterrand of NATO's offer to Eastern European countries of
a commitment to non-aggression: ``We will follow the political line
but not the strategic line.''

   The Agriculture Department said Friday it is
seeking an alternative way of setting minimum prices paid dairy
farmers under federal marketing orders.
   The department currently uses a base known as the
Minnesota-Wisconsin, or M-W, price, an average of prices paid to
farmers in the two-state area for Grade B milk used only for
manufacturing products such as cheese, butter and non-fat dry milk.
   Daniel D. Haley, administrator of the department's Agricultural
Marketing Service, said the M-W base price has been used since the
early 1960s and is widely accepted as a measure of change in the
supply and demand for milk nationally.
   But a continuing decline in the output of Grade B milk _ partly
because of tighter sanitary standards _ is gradually making the M-W
price unusable for setting milk prices, he said.
   Haley said the department's National Agricultural Statistics
Service, which compiles the M-W price, questions whether it will be
able to do so after mid-1992.
   The dairy industry has asked USDA to develop and test
alternative methods, and a national hearing on all federal milk
orders has been tentatively set for September, although no specific
date and location have been announced.
   Haley said a separate hearing on the base price will be held
later.
   Meanwhile, specific proposals can be sent by July 25 to:
Director, Dairy Division, AMS, USDA, Room 2968-S, P.O. Box 96456,
Washington, D.C. 20090-6456.

clothing to help victims of last month's devastating earthquake in
Iran.
   The group, Feed the Children, said the 40 tons of supplies would
be shipped Sunday from Dulles International Airport near Washington
to Mehrabad Airport in Tehran. In Iran, the Red Crescent _ Iran's
Red Cross equivalent _ will receive and distribute the goods, said
Sekita Ekrek, a spokeswoman for organization.
   Iranian officials estimate that nearly 40,000 people died and
60,000 were injured in the June 21 earthquake, which measured
between 7.3 and 7.7 on the Richter scale. Estimates of the homeless
range up to 500,000.
   Larry Jones, Feed the Children president and founder, said the
American public initially was reluctant to give donations to Iran
because that county is seen as an enemy.
   Iran is believed to have influence with the kidnappers who hold
16 Western hostages, including six Americans, in Lebanon.
   ``Because we don't have diplomatic relations, because of the
hostage situation, they were reluctant to give,'' he said. ``People
needed a little nudge to help give.''
   He said donations started coming in after he made a televised
appeal for aid.
   Feed the Children has been working with the Iran Quake Relief
Committee, formed shortly after the earthquake, and the United
Armenian Fund, founded after a destructive 1988 earthquake in
Soviet Armenia.
   The United Armenian Fund is paying for a private cargo plane to
transport the supplies to Tehran. The Iran Quake Relief Committee
helped solicit donations and coordinate the effort with Iranian
officials.
   Marty Youssefiani, spokesman for the Iranian Quake Relief
Committee, said the three groups came together despite major
ethnic, religious and political differences.
   ``For the first time, the community has put aside all its
differences,'' he said. ``That's a remarkable, remarkable
accomplishment.''

<TEXT>
   President Petar Mladenov, whose political
party of former Communists won Bulgaria's first free election in 58
years last month, submitted his resignation today, state media
reported.
   Mladenov had been under mounting pressure to step down.
   Students and opposition parties, who led the calls for his
resignation, accused him, among other things, of suggesting that
tanks should be used to put down an anti-government rally outside
Parliament late last year.
   Mladenov's letter of resignation was read on state television's
8:00 p.m. news program by a commentator.
   Students, who have been on strike for nearly a month, issued a
declaration earlier today calling on Bulgarians to go on a
30-minute ``warning strike'' Saturday if Mladenov did not step down
today, the state BTA news agency said.
   The resignation left Premier Andrei Lukanov, a member of
Mladenov's Socialist Party, as head of the government. A
replacement for Mladenov will likely be chosen when the new
Parliament first meets on Tuesday.
   Demands for Mladenov's resignation came after experts assessed
as authentic a videotape in which he was heard to suggest the use
of tanks on a large anti-government rally outside Parliament on
Dec. 14.
   In the videotape, broadcast on an election program by the main
opposition alliance Union of Democratic Forces three days before
runoff elections last month, Mladenov was heard to say ``Let the
tanks come.''
   No tanks were used.
   In his reaction to the experts' conclusion, Mladeonv said on
state TV Wednesday night that the phrase was taken out of context
and did not reflect his political career and convictions.
   The end of hard-line Communist rule in Bulgaria came not, as in
Romania, Czechoslovakia and East Germany, through street protest,
but in a Communist Party coup in which reform-minded comrades,
including Mladenov, ousted party chief Todor Zhivkov. The
Communists reorganized as the Socialist Party.
   Mladenov was appointed president, and after peaceful
demonstrations by the fragmented but quickly growing opposition,
the Socialists began negotiations that led to the June elections.
   In Sofia _ a Democratic Forces stronghold _ nearly everybody,
including most Western diplomats, was shocked by the Socialists'
211-seat victory in the parliamentary elections. The Democratic
Forces won 144 seats.
   Lukanov had said he wanted to form a broad coalition government
that might have more chance of attracting sorely needed foreign
investment. However, the opposition refused to help the Socialists
solve the growing economic crisis created by their mismanagement.
   The new Parliament will serve a two-year term and write a new
constitution.
   Most of the original demands of the students, who have been on
strike since June 11, have been fulfilled. They include the
resignation of a TV director accused of biased reporting and
publication of alleged election irregularities.
   But according to BTA, the students drew up a new list of demands
today. They have called for a date to be set for a public trial of
Zhivkov, 78, who is in detention. He has been charged with
misappropriation of state property, inciting ethnic hostility and
grave abuse of power.
   About 1,000 students have been conducting a sit-in strike in
front of the presidential building to press their demands for
Mladenov's resignation.
   A students' strike committee statement called for a general
strike on Monday, one day before the new Parliament is to hold its
first session, if Mladenov had not resigned by then, BTA said.
   The Union of Democratic Forces also issued a statement earlier
today calling on Mladenov to resign before Parliament opens Tuesday.
   Other smaller opposition groups and the mainstream Agrarian
Party, a once docile ally of the Communists, also backed the
students' demands, BTA reported.
   The former official trade unions, which now call themselves
independent, also supported student demands, as did miners at the
Balkan coalfield who support the opposition union Podkrepa, BTA
said.
   On Thursday, the leader of the Union of Democratic Forces,
Zhelyu Zhelev said in a statement that a head of state ``cannot
permit himself to be dishonest before the people,'' BTA reported.

<HEAD>x x x to Gorbachev</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A. They send to him that, ``Here's an alliance that is purely _
that you should view, Mr. Gorbachev, as defensive and not
threatening, and please convince your military and others in the
Soviet Union of this fact.'' You see, from my discussions with Mr.
Gorbachev and others, I've had the feeling that they have viewed
NATO as much more threatening to them than I've ever looked at _
than the way in which I've looked at NATO. But, now, as a result of
the actions that we've taken here, I think it should be clear to
the Soviet military, to Mr. Gorbachev, to his adversaries, and to
his friends inside the Soviet Union that NATO is changing. And, to
the degree they had seen it as a threat to their shores or to their
borders, they should look at it not as a threat to their borders or
to their people.
   Any time you sit down with people from the Soviet Union, they
tell you the fact that they lost from 20 to 27 million lives. It's
ingrained in them. And they do it not as a defensive mechanism, but
they do it because they feel very strongly about that. I hope that
they will look at the changes that NATO has taken and say, ``Well,
if NATO had been a threat to us, it no longer is a threat to us,''
and then I hope we can go forward to further document that spirit
by mutual agreements on arms control.
   Yes, Jessie?
   Q. Mr. President, how are you going to communicate what's in
this document to Mr. Gorbachev and the people there? Are you going
to talk with him personally? Did the NATO leaders decide on some
other method of communication with him to let him know what it
means, what the communique means?
   A. Well, I'd _ the NATO leaders have decided that the Secretary
General will be going there, and that will be a very good
face-to-face chance to discuss these matters. I believe our
Secretary of State is meeting soon with Mr. Shevardnadze. You can
be sure that matters will be discussed then, and then I _ it's in
all likelihood I will discuss it personally by telephone with Mr.
Gorbachev.
   I think it's very important that the leader of the United States
and the leader of the Soviet Union stay in touch. And, in fact,
when he was here in Washington, we talked about more such contacts.
So perhaps within the next couple of weeks I will be talking to him
about what transpired, because I want to make the _ some of these
points here again, particularly that he _ they ought not to view
NATO as a threat, and certainly they ought not to view it as a
roadblock to progress in arms control or withdrawal of conventional
forces or whatever it might be.
   Yes, Margaret? You had your hand up.
   Q. Mr. President, what kind of tangible response would you like
to see from President Gorbachev now to this, and I'm thinking
particularly the issue of Germany and NATO?
   A. Well, I think, in terms of the question of Germany and NATO,
I would like to see the tangible respose be an acceptance of the
concept that a unified Germany in NATO is not only good, but that
it certainly is no threat to them. And we've had long talks with
Mr. Gorbachev about that, and perhaps this declaration will be the
_ be a document that he can use to convince others that a unified
Germany in NATO is in the interest of stability and world peace.
So, that would be _ I think that is probably the most important
message. And then I'd like to think that out of this he would feel
more confident in going forward with _ with arms control, bringing
the two-plus-four talks to a conclusion, and there's a wide array
of other things as well.
   Way in the back. Yes, sir?
   Q. Thank you. Jerry Lewis, Israel Radio. Did the topic of the
Middle East come up during your discussions in the margins of the
NATO summit? And can you comment on press reports which indicate
you might be considering resuming your dialogue with the PLO, and
what conditions would you attach to such a resumption?
   A. The discussion of the Middle East in the NATO meeting did not
come up. It may have been discussed in the corridors but it was not
a discussion of the _ in the _ in the meetings at all, and I didn't
have discussions in a NATO context about the Middle East.
   My position on the dialogue with the PLO is that one of the
preconditions for discussion was a renunciation of terror. And I
viewed the aborted attack on the shores of Israel by some
Palestinian commandos as a terrorist act. So, we didn't cancel, we
suspended the talks with the PLO. And I would like to think that
Mr. Arafat could some way bring his Council, not only to denounce
the terror _ that particular terrorist act _ but also to take some
action against the person that perpetrated it, and then I think we
would certainly give rapid consideration to renewal of the dialogue.
   I happen to think the dialogue has been useful. I don't think
Mr. Arafat particularly agrees with that, and I'm quite confident
that Mr. Shamir doesn't agree with that. but, nevertheless, we have
_ that's the view of the United States.
   Yes, Ellen?
   Q. Mr. President, Mikhail Gorbachev is already under fire from
conservatives for essentially giving away Eastern Europe. Are you
at all concerned, sir, that by inviting him to speak today only
further undermines him? And I have a follow-up.
   A. No, I'm not _ not only do I think we're not undermining him,
but I would think that would send a signal that NATO has no hostile
intentions to the Soviet Union. So I would hope nobody at home
would consider this an effort to undermine Mr. Gorbachev, nor would
it be _ nor would it have the effect of undermining a man who has
clearly tried to move forward, who has presided over the Soviet
union at a time when this fantastic change towards democracy and
freedom has taken place in Eastern Europe. And you're seeing that
same kind of quest for change, democratic change, and economic
change inside the Soviet Union. So I don't think it would have the
effect that the question suggests.
   Q. If he accepts your invitation, sir, will you attend that
meeting, or would it be an occasion for some sort of a superpower
summit?
   A. It has the _ this _ the level of the Gorbachev meeting at
NATO has not been determined, and I would be guided by what the
other NATO members think is appropriate. But others have _ you know
_ the level at which Mr. Gorbachev would speak to NATO has not been
set. If it was a head-of-state level, why of course I would attend.
Others have addressed NATO at varying levels.
   Yes, right in the middle.
   Q. Having attended quite a number of these things, of these NATO
conferences, I'd like to ask a question, Mr. President, which I
asked just two meetings ago. Is this to some extent a celebration
of the victory of NATO in the Cold War? The Cold War is over, and
NATO has won. Or don't you agree with the idea that NATO has won
the Cold War?
   A. Excuse me, back up now. I _ I've tried to avoid code words,
and the Cold War being over is something that I'd rather not _ not
comment on. I _ I don't think we're dealing in terms of victory and
defeat. We're dealing in terms of how do we stabilize and guarantee
the peace and security of Europe. So to the degree a chief of state
or head of government dwells on the kinds of rhetoric that you
understandably ask about, I think it is counterproductive. Does
that answer it?
   Q. Well, would you say that NATO has, to a great extent, caused
Gorbachev to be; that the whole changes in Eastern Europe have to
some extent been caused by what's been going on in Western Europe
for the last 40 years?
   A. Well, I would say to some degree that the changes in Eastern
Europe and in the Soviet Union have been because they have seen the
success of market economies, they have seen a craving for freedom
and democracy on the parts of people. And to the degree NATO
countries contributed to that proper perception, so be it. I think
_ I like to think that _ I'm convinced that NATO's solidarity
during the last 40 years has guaranteed the peace for Europe. And
when you look back at history, it is a long peace, given some of
the conflagrations on this continent. So I think, NATO deserves a
lot of credit, but I think the yearning for freedom and democracy
is pretty fundamental. NATO has nothing to do with the changes in
our own Western Hemisphere, and yet, you're seeing now the
emergence of democracies and you're seeing the emergence of free
people there. So it's fundamental that people want democracy and
freedom, but I think NATO's major contribution has been to keeping
the peace, and yet, it's set an example that I think many in
Eastern Europe now want to follow.
   Yes?
   Q. Mr. President, how do you square the concern over stability
in Europe, which is the new purpose of NATO, with increasing signs
of instability in the Soviet Union, particularly on the political
and economic front, and what can you do to put those two pieces of
the puzzle together?
   A. A very good and very difficult question, because, frankly,
one thing we do is stay out of the internal affairs of the Soviet
Union. I realize that some think that I'm not staying out of the
internal affairs of the Soviet Union when I speak _ speak
pleasantly about Mr. Gorbachev. But I think they have to sort it
out now. They have to decide what they want, how much of their
gross national product ought to go into arms, whether the threat is
much less than they have historically perceived. and once they take
that decision, then we in the West will stand ready to work very
cooperatively with them. But I think the next move, what I'm
saying, is up to them. I think they have to make these
determinations. and in the meantime, NATO, having seem the changes
that have taken place in Eastern Europe and the predicted changes
in terms of force levels, can go forward with what I think people
will view as an historic document.
   Excuse me, I did tell you I'd get over here.
   Q. Thank you very much. Me?
   A. Yes, sir.
   Q. How conditional is the proposal to remove nuclear artillery
from Europe? Are you actually saying that you will not do this
unless the Soviet Union does likewise, are you saying it should be
part of negotiations, or are you actually merely inviting the
Soviet union to withdraw their nuclear artillery?

   Soviets dominated the piano section of the ninth
international Tchaikovsky music competition, while Americans swept
the gold medals in the vocal division, officials announced Friday.
   Akiko Suwanai of Japan took first place in the violin section of
the contest, and West Germany's Gustav Rivinius won the gold medal
for cello.
   In the piano division, Soviets Boris Berezovski took the gold
medal and Vladimir Mishchuk won the silver. Three competitors
shared the bronze medals: Anton Mordasov of the Soviet Union; Kevin
Kenner, an American living in West Germany, and Johan Schmidt of
Belgium.
   Deborah Voigt of New York City won the gold in the female
vocalist division and Hans Choi, of Flushing, N.Y. won the gold in
the men's division.
   Alyssa Park, a 16-year-old violinist from Lexington, Ky., who
charmed Soviet audiences and won a huge ovation in the finals, took
the bronze medal, and also was honored with two more medals: most
talented and most artistic.
   The competition, which began June 14, drew 335 competitors from
51 countries. It took on special significance because this year is
the 150th anniversary of Tchaikovsky's birth.
   The gold medalists will perform at a special concert Saturday
night, and the runners-up will play on Sunday.
   ``I feel totally exhausted,'' Voigt, 29, said Friday. ``It was a
grueling and grinding experience.''
   The soprano and former apprentice with the San Francisco Opera
Company celebrated with champagne, and plans a U.S. concert tour
starting in Chicago.
   Choi, a baritone and former student at the La Scala opera
company of Milan, Italy, had said his biggest problem was language.
``I must sing in six languages, and I must sing perfectly in six
languanges, because the judges come from so many countries.''
   Suwanai, 18, of Tokyo, told the Tass news agency she was happy
to win a first prize after coming in second at contests in Genoa,
Brussels and Japan.
   She said some credit for her victory had to go to Tchaikovsky.
``He is not just my most favorite composer. Possibly, there is no
other composer who is so close to me spiritually.''
   Park, a junior in high school who also studied at the Cincinnati
Conservatory of Music, won the bronze for her renditions of works
by Tchaikovsky, Paganini, Mozart and Bartok.
   In an interview after the winners were announced, she said: ``I
was very honored, but also very puzzled,'' because the
international jury awarded her the medals for the most artistic and
most talented, but only ranked her third overall.
   Park, the youngest of the 65 violinists who entered the
competition, admitted feeling some tension, ``but I just tried to
treat it as a concert and play.''
   Berezovsky, a 22-year-old student of the Moscow Conservatory,
won for his performance of works by Tchaikovsky, Chopin and Liszt.
   The international jury also awarded two fourth prizes to
pianists Rolf Plagge of West Germany and Stephen Prutsman, of Los
Angeles.
   Ten Americans were among the 48 finalists who competed Thursday
night.
   For the first time since the competition began in 1958, foreign
funding was used for organizing the contest. The hard-pressed
Soviet hosts turned to Pioneer Electronics of Japan to contribute a
$4,000 stereo set for each category winner as well as subsidizing
hotels and transport for visiting musicians.
   Each winner also wins 5,000 rubles, a non-convertible currency
that cannot be taken from the Soviet Union.

   Sinead's coming to town _ O'Connor, that is.
   She's hot. The kids love her. Critics, too. The album's gone
platinum. Her concerts sell out everywhere. And that look. Her
shaved head is as distinctive as the Beatle moptop was in 1964.
   That's what Joe Poggi is thinking. He's the marketing director
at KNRG in Houston. He needs a gimmick, a way to get more
listeners. Something outrageous if necessary.
   He's got it! Madonna was just in town, one stop on her ``Blond
Ambition Tour.'' Why not play off that, and go one better. Take
O'Connor's name and shout it from the highest rooftops _ literally.
   ``We had our afternoon jock get on the top of the Summit, which
overlooks the Southwest Freeway,'' explained Poggi, referring to
the city's sports arena. ``On the marquee we had them put ENERGY 95
presents the `Bald Ambition Tour.'
   ``You see, the show sold out and we had a pair of front row
tickets. But you had to be the first person to come there and let
professional stylists cut your hair.
   ``We had a person show up at 3:15 with hair down to his
shoulders. He's a swim coach and we put him up on the marquee. And
at 4:30, just when rush hour's really good, we started cutting his
hair. People were laughing and honking; some pulled over and
watched.''
   Highway haircuts and rush-hour remotes may not seem the most
dignified way to greet the best-selling author of songs about dead
boyfriends and police brutality, even if she does shave her head.
   But this is hit radio, and a new look plus a platinum LP means
gold for the happy-happy world of morning zoos and celebrity
wake-up calls.
   ``I don't think we did it to make fun of her,'' said Mark Todd,
operations manager for KQLZ in Los Angeles, another ``Shave Your
Head'' promoter. ``People are fans and we did it out of fun. We
weren't doing it to put her down. We play her records constantly.
It's basically intended to let the listeners participate in
something. It makes for good radio.''
   ``When it was discovered she was coming into town for a concert,
our phones were screaming,'' said Cris Dockett, assistant promotion
manager at WMMS in Cleveland.
   ``Anybody willing to shave their head recieved tickets, plus we
gave them cash. They were willing to do it. One of them even
brought her own hairdresser into the studio.''
   But all the hype has caused much sorrow for the 23-year-old
Irish performer, who toured North America from May 1 to June 11.
O'Connor, whose ``I do not want what I haven't got'' album quickly
topped the charts, was especially upset when she learned that a San
Diego radio station had taken to the airwaves to track down her
hotel.
   ``In America people are obsessed,'' the singer complained in a
phone interview from Austin, Texas. ``It's really, really shocking.
It's so frightening. They follow you around and it freaks you out.
Anything could be happening. What am I supposed to do?''
   ``It's all been a rude surprise for Sinead,'' said O'Conner's
publicist, Elaine Schock. ``She's used to walking the streets. When
I would go to see her in England, she'd greet me at the subway.
Intellectually, she understood that becoming famous would change
things, but in her heart she was hoping it wouldn't.''
   Many promoters can sympathize but insist O'Connor will have to
get used to it. It's all part of being in the limelight, they say.
Rock 'n' roll stars are fair game, as are all celebrities, they
argue. Sell a million records and you'd better bring a pair of
sunglasses and keep the phone off the hook.
   ``We can do stuff like that with anybody,'' said producer
Telephone Tony of WHTZ in New York, another station on the ``Shave
Your Head'' network.
   ``When Prince was out, he had the same type of thing, and
Michael Jackson, too. We had sightings for Madonna around Central

   A. Well, I'd certainly invite them to do it. And the document is
fairly clear on that point, I think that if they are _ the relation
_ the withdrawal of nuclear artillery on the part of the West is
conditioned on the withdrawal of Soviet nuclear artillery.
   Way in the back.
   Q. Mr. President, paragraph 12: ``Manpower levels of a united
Germany.'' What happened to nonsingularization of Germany?
   A. Well, I don't see that as singularization. That was a
question that had to be addressed anyway, and I think that the _
you're going to see the United States addressing its force levels
through CFE talks. So I would _ I would think that this is not what
I have always thought of as singularization, trying to single
Germany out, for example, from not being a part of _ a united
Germany _ from being a part of NATO.
   So I'm simply saying _ I think what it simply says is this
question at an appropriate time will be addressed. And we are going
forward addressing ourselves now to US force levels under our
conventional force talks. So I don't see any contradiction in that.
   There was a guy on the aisle that I identified back there _ no,
I'm afraid it wasn't you, but right there _ that had his hand up.
Well, he's vanished. There was a guy in an open shirt here. I'm
sorry.
   Q. Thank you, Mr. President.
   A. Then I have to go. Go ahead. We'll get these two, and then I
must _ (audio break due to mike difficulties).
   Q. Thank you, Mr. President. (Inaudible) _ that you are hoping
that Gorbachev can convince other people that through these
documents that they have not to fear the NATO. Are you saying that
some other people in the Soviet Union are imposing this fear to
NATO to Mr. Gorbachev, and who are these people?
   A. Well, I think there has been _
   Q. And a follow-up question, please?
   A. Yeah. Well, if I got your first part of it correctly, I think
there's been a historic fear on the part of some about the West
because of the Soviets' own history. i happen to believe that that
fear has been misplaced all along. But to the degree people still
have that fear and they look at this document, it would seem to me
to be de minimus, and I can't single out which people they are, but
I think there has been a historic concern on the part of the
Soviets because of their own history in _ certainly as recently as
World War II, with an enormous loss of life. I think over the years
as we improve our relations _ have improved our relations with the
Soviet Union and, indeed, as they have changed, those fears have
diminished. And I think given the new openness, the glasnost, I
think they're going to diminish even more.
   And what was the follow-up?
   Q. The follow-up was how do you expect that Mr. Gorbachev can be
helped in his present problems, internal problems in the Soviet
Union with this London Declaration?
   A. I'm awful sorry. I'm having difficulty hearing you from the
back of the room. Could you say it one more time?
   Q. How do you expect that Mr. Gorbachev can be helped through
this London Declaration in his present internal problems in the
Soviet Union?
   A. I think he will say, ``Look, NATO has indeed changed in
response to the changes that have taken place in Eastern Europe.''
If I were him, I'd say, ``I've been right, they're changing, and
now I want to go forward with the United States and negotiate some
more deals. And I want to see us reform. I want to see us stop some
of what we've been doing in various regions around the world that
others view as detrimental to the interests of freedom and
democracy.'' And so I would _ if I were him, I would take a hard
look at this document, I would listen carefully to what he hears
from Manfred Woerner when he goes there. And I would _ I would
think he could say, ``We've been right to reach out as we have
tried to do to the United States and to agree _ and, indeed, to
improve relations with countries in Western Europe. They're
changing; they have now changed their doctrine because of steps
that I, Mr. Gorbachev, have taken.''
   And I'd get on the offense and then let the rest of us help him
with some of his hard liners. And there's plenty of work to do.
But, I would think that he'd view this as a very positive step
forward and one that vindicates some of the moves that he's made
over the past year or two.
   Last one, way in the back. Go ahead.
   Q. Mr. President, now that you've had a chance to digest Prime
Minister Shamir's letter to you of last week, how does that letter
leave you feeling? Does it leave you feeling, as Secretary Baker
said, ``that maybe we should just leave him with the White House
phone number, and to call when he's serious,'' or does it leave you
feeling you're ready now to get involved in a prolonged negotiation
with him, once again spending another few months or years to try to
modify his position?
   A. It leaves me feeling we need further clarification in terms
of the questions that I put to him _ the answers _ clarification on
some of the answers. But, look, we want to see the peace process go
forward.
   We had good talks with _ I did, and so did Jim Baker _ with the
Egyptian Foreign Minister the other day; I've been on the phone to
Mr. Mubarak, to King Hussein, to others, and we want to see the
process go forward. And we have a United States policy and we're
going to stay with the policy in terms of settlements and other
things of this question.
   But, we will do everything we can to encourage a discussion that
will end up in peace. There has got to be talks. Palestinians have
to attend these talks. And so, the ground rules are out there, and
we've got to _ we've got to go forward, but we need more
clarification, and, very candidly, I'd like to think that Israel
would now move forward again. And that's about where we stand.
   Thank you all very much.
   Q. Your hand, Mr. President _
   A. Huh? (Questioning.)
   Q. What's wrong with your hand?
   A. It's skewered. (Laughter.) I was cleaning the mackerel and I
plunged the knife into it. Minor wound.

   Mitch Snyder, whose personal demons apparently
overwhelmed his fierce commitment to the nation's homeless, was
remembered Friday as ``a man of justice'' who worked tirelessly to
assist the downtrodden.
   Jesse Jackson told a memorial service at Bible Way Church that
Snyder was a man who heard and answered a ``moral call'' to help
the homeless.
   ``The fact that birds have a home, foxes have a home, and yet
men and women, veterans of foreign wars, mothers and fathers,
working poor people, have no place to lay their head _ he found
that to be a moral disgrace,'' Jackson told about 600 mourners.
   Snyder's body was discovered Thursday hanging from an electrical
cord in his private room at the Washington shelter he founded. A
police statement called the death ``an apparent suicide.''
   Dr. Georges Benjamin, the city's public health commissioner,
said Snyder's death was the result of ``asphyxiation by hanging.''
   Benjamin said investigators cannot pinpoint when Snyder died.
The death has not yet been ruled a suicide, but Benjamin said there
is no evidence of foul play.
   Police said a note containing ``suicidal references'' was found
near Snyder's body, and law enforcement sources said the note
outlined personal problems Snyder was having in his 15-year
relationship with fellow homeless advocate Carol Fennelly.
   The two had said last month that they would be married in
September.
   At the memorial service, Jackson described Snyder's dramatic
efforts to draw attention to homelessness, which included hunger
strikes and sit-ins.
   ``Mitch was a little eccentric, Mitch was a little off,''
Jackson said to appreciative laughs from the mourners, many of whom
live at Snyder's shelter. ``But he was a man of justice. There's
something to be said about being a little off.''
   A close friend of Snyder's who spoke with him Tuesday described
him as ``very down, very despondent.''
   ``We talked for about an hour,'' said the friend, who asked not
to be named. ``He was very upset about his relationship with Carol,
very down in the dumps.''
   Snyder's friend reflected on their conversation and then
repeatedly called Snyder back to invite him to dinner.
   ``He didn't return calls Tuesday, or then on Wednesday, which I
found strange,'' the friend said.
   Fennelly declined to discuss the situation after the memorial
service. ``This just isn't the time,'' she said.
   A funeral is scheduled for Tuesday outside the shelter, which is
located in a run-down neighborhood just half a mile from the U.S.
Capitol.
   Jackson will preach at the service, and organizers said they are
hoping that the Rev. Phillip Berrigan also will attend. Snyder
credited Berrigan and his brother, Daniel, also a priest, with
helping him turn his life around.
   Snyder met the Berrigans in a federal prison in 1973 while
serving time on auto theft charge. The Berrigans were jailed for
burning draft cards in anti-war protests, and quickly made Snyder a
convert to their methods of social activism and non-violent protest.
   That commitment led Snyder first to the anti-war movement, and
then to the cause of homelessness after he moved to the nation's
capital in 1973.
   The gray, three-story building where Snyder's body was found
symbolized the cause in which he achieved national prominence and
the tactics he used in his fight.
   His group _ the Community for Creative Non-Violence _ was given
the government building by the Reagan administration only after
Snyder staged a hunger strike in 1984 to demand federal aid and
publicize the plight of the homeless.
   Snyder once described President Ronald Reagan as a nice man who
had ``mean-spirited'' politics.
   Mark Weinberg, the former president's spokesman, said from Los
Angeles on Friday: ``President and Mrs. Reagan are saddened and
extend their sympathy and prayers to (Snyder's) family and
friends.''
   After winning the government building, Snyder took his combative
tactics to the national stage to publicize the problems of
homeless. In 1986, officials in Santa Barbara, Calif., backed away
from plans to ban sleeping in public places after Snyder threatened
to lead a march of homeless people into the city.
   But Snyder had suffered defeats in recent months, particularly
when the District of Columbia Council, citing budget pressures,
scaled back a comprehensive law providing emergency shelter to all
who requested it.
   He was also criticized for his attempts to prevent U.S. Census
Bureau workers from interviewing homeless people. Snyder described
the efforts of Census workers as ``government grandstanding.''

<TEXT>
   The summit stage moved Friday to President Bush's
hometown, where leaders of the world's seven largest industrialized
nations will turn their attention to the economic configuration of
the post-Cold War world.
   Houston was turned out in the summit nations' colors; flags
sprouted on downtown skyscrapers and at the Rice University summit
site. Painters hurried to put the finishing touches on spruced-up
buildings.
   Last year's summit in Paris adjourned early when the leaders ran
out of things to talk about. That's not likely to happen next week.
   Questions of direct economic aid to the Soviets, a contentious
fight over farm subsidies and problems of global pollution were
expected to dominate the negotiating sessions and working dinners,
which get under way Monday.
   On many of the issues, the United States found itself at odds
with the other summit countries _ Japan, West Germany, France,
Britain, Italy and Canada.
   In many ways the Houston meeting will be a continuation of the
talks Thursday and Friday at the NATO summit in London. Of the
seven leaders, only Japan's Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu did not
participate in the NATO meeting.
   As his first order of business, Bush was to hold private talks
with Kaifu on Saturday. Officials said that in addition to briefing
Kaifu on the outcome of the NATO meeting, the two leaders would
cover the various economic issues coming up in Houston.
   High on the economic agenda will be the question of whether the
West should supply a $15 billion to $20 billion aid package to bail
out Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's floundering economic
reform effort, an idea being pushed by West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand.
   Bush repeated his objections to such aid on Friday, saying he
has ``big problems'' in giving U.S. assistance as long as Moscow is
spending billions of dollars annually in support for Cuba. But he
appeared to open the door slightly to the possibility of extending
some types of financial credits to the Soviets.
   Diplomatic sources said that Gorbachev had written an appeal for
economic aid to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who like
Bush is against the proposal until the Soviets do more to reform
their economy.
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney predicted the economic
summit would make ``substantial progress'' in resolving the Soviet
aid dispute.
   However, the most likely outcome was a vague statement of
support which would not commit any specific amounts of money but
would allow countries such as West Germany to offer their own aid
packages.
   Bush has told reporters that his top priority at the economic
summit would be breaking a logjam on agriculture trade which has
deadlocked an effort to reform the rules governing world trade.
   The United States is pushing for agreement to phase out all
trade-distorting farm subsidies over the next 10 years. But that
idea has drawn strong opposition from European countries, whose
leaders contend that such a proposal would cost the jobs of between
2 million and 3 million European farmers.
   The trade liberalization talks, known as the Uruguay Round for
the country where they were launched in 1986, are scheduled to
conclude in December, but U.S. officials fear they could falter
without agreement on the agriculture question.
   The world leaders are also expected to consider a European
proposal to cut back on ``greenhouse'' gases, forms of pollution
which scientists fear are trapping too much heat from the sun and
causing global climate changes.
   The U.S. position is that more needs to be known about the
possible threat before committing billions of dollars to cleanup
efforts.
   Before all the serious talks begin, the world leaders will be
treated to a taste of Texas on Sunday night, complete with a rodeo,
barbecue and a performance by the Grand Ol' Opry.
   Houston, a city that suffered through hard times during the oil
price bust of the 1980s, raised $10 million in donations and
assembled an army of volunteers to showcase Houston's economic
resurrection for the expected 3,000 reporters from around the world.
   On Friday, painters were still at work in one of the meeting
rooms to be used during the three days of talks at Rice University,
a 4,000-student private university five miles from downtown.
   In deference to Houston's notorious summer weather, the outdoor
arrival ceremony on Monday was shortened and a special platform was
constructed to pipe cool air underneath the dignataries' seats.

<HEAD>Bomb Explodes At Bus Terminal, Injures 27</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bomb exploded Friday at a
crowded black bus terminal, injuring 27 people in what appeared to
be the work of right-wing extremists, authorities said.
   The bombing was the most serious of six explosions in the past
week in Johannesburg. White extremists claimed responsibility for
the previous blasts, but there was no such claim following Friday's
explosion.
   ``The ultraright and neo-fascist forces ... are on the
rampage,'' said the African National Congress, the country's
largest black opposition group. ''The ANC demands that authorities
disarm and disband the ultra-right groups.''
   The bomb went off in the city center during the morning rush
hour in an area where buses used by blacks let off and pick up
passengers. Thousands of blacks from townships outside Johannesburg
pass through the area every day.
   Police said the bomb hidden in a trash can sent pieces of
concrete and debris hurtling through the air, hitting people
standing in bus lines and passersby.
   Doctors said most of the injuries were relatively minor and just
two of the 27 blacks treated at a local hospital were required to
stay for additional treatment.
   Police said the blast looked like the work of right-wing white
extremists. No arrests have been made.
   Three black mini-buses were were riddled with debris and about
15 other vehicles suffered lesser damage, witnesses said.
   ``We just heard a big noise, everyone scattered, people in the
taxis got out and ran away,'' said Nhlandla Mbatha, who was waiting
in a bus line when the bomb went off. ``There were rocks flying
into the air. There was blood everywhere. People (were) screaming
and crying.''
   Some of the injured were buying food in nearby shops when they
were hit by flying debris, witnesses said.
   ``Everything was clouded with smoke. I saw about six people
running toward me with shredded clothing and some with no shoes,''
said shopkeeper Isha Charassi.
   Police cars and ambulances with wailing sirens rushed to the
scene of the blast, the most serious since the bombing campaign
began a week ago.
   Right-wing whites have expressed outrage at President F.W. de
Klerk's stated plans to end apartheid and share power with the
country's 30 million blacks. At present, the 5 million whites
dominate politics and the economy.
   The previous bombs were aimed at whites involved in efforts to
end apartheid, but caused no injuries and only minor damage. A
shadowy group calling itself the White Wolves claimed
responsibility.
   In other developments Friday:
   _ Police searched the home of Robert van Tonder, leader of the
right-wing Boer State Party. No one was arrested, but police said
they confiscated documents from the home outside Johannesburg.
   ``If they (the government) carry on this way, they can expect
violence to escalate,'' an angry van Tonder said.
   _ Police said they arrested three ANC guerrillas allegedly
planning to attack black rivals in the eastern province of Natal.

<TEXT>
   Negotiations will resume next week on final
details of an agreement expanding U.S. access to military
facilities in Singapore, the Pentagon said Friday.
   The proposed deal would not give the United States its own
military base in Singapore, but it would greatly expand U.S.
military activity in the Southeast Asian city-state, said Lt. Cmdr.
Edward H. Lundquist, a Pentagon spokesman.
   Lundquist said no U.S. planes or ships would be based there
permanently, but a small contingent of American military personnel
_ probably fewer than 200 _ would be stationed at the Singapore
facilities to keep them ready for U.S. use.
   Lundquist stressed that the proposed use of Singapore military
facilities would not be a substitute for the larger U.S. forces at
Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base in the Philippines. A
military bases agreement between the United States and the
Philippines expires next year, and the Bush administration is
seeking to negotiate some form of continued use of those facilities.
   If the Singapore deal is concluded, U.S. F-16 fighter planes
based elsewhere in Asia would be allowed to conduct occasional
training missions in Singapore, and Navy ships could use
Singapore's strategically located port, Lundquist said.
   The negotiations began early this year after Singapore Prime
Minister Lee Kuan Yew offered to permit greater U.S. access to his
country's military facilities.
   The Los Angeles Times reported in Friday's editions that it was
possible that a final agreement would be signed when Secretary of
State James A. Baker III visits Singapore in August.
   Lundquist said he could not say how close the two sides were to
final agreement, but that the remaining issues were mainly legal
technicalities. He said a new round of talks was scheduled for next
Wednesday through Friday in Washington.
   Lundquist said the main outstanding issue was the legal status
of American military personnel who would be stationed in Singapore
under the agreement. One open question, he said, was what rights
the Americans would have in the event they were arrested on
criminal charges. Singapore authorizes the death penalty for
convicted drug traffickers.
   Singapore has one of the world's largest harbors. It lies in the
strategic waterway through which Japan and South Korea get most of
their oil from the Persian Gulf.
   Singapore is a member of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, a regional organization whose other members are Thailand,
the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei.
   The Philippines is the only ASEAN member hosting a permanent
U.S. military base.

   Reformers of the minority Democratic Platform
fraction said Friday they would vote to re-elect Mikhail S.
Gorbachev as Communist Party leader, but they still planned to
consider leaving the party in the fall.
   Considering ``all variations, we will have to support
Gorbachev,'' Dmitri Karualov, a Democratic Platform member from
Leningrad, told a news conference at the end of the fifth day of
the 28th Soviet Communist Party Congress.
   Karualov said Alexander Yakovlev, a Politburo member and close
adviser to Gorbachev, refused a Democratic Platform proposal to
dispute the top party job.
   Left without any alternative, Democratic Platform, a radical
pro-reform group within ther Communist Party, decided to support
Gorbachev.
   Karualov said, however, he believed Gorbachev would likely
become a ``hostage of the bureaucracy,'' unable to carry out
further economic and political reforms.
   Democratic Platform had threatened to walk out of the congress,
an act that would have caused the first split in the party since
1921. Karualov said the group would hold a congress in the fall to
consider its future. He did not provide a date or any further
details.
   The entire Democratic Platform delegation, however, still must
make a final decision about whether to break away.
   Democratic Platform members are to meet with Gorbachev late
Friday. Vladimir Lysenko, a faction leader, said he didn't expect
any deep answers from Gorbachev and the meeting was unlikely to be
a ``big spectacle.''
   The movement, formed in January, has only about 100 of the 4,600
congress delegates, but its members say they have the support of 40
percent of the party rank-and-file.
   Democratic Platform supports calls for the party to divest
itself of its massive wealth, an appeal that is unpopular with
orthodox Communists. It also wants the party to give up its cells
in the army and KGB.
   Leaders of the movement told reporters they were disappointed by
the congress, the main task of which Lysenko said was to preserve
status quo.
   ``These events don't make me very happy,'' Lysenko said.
   Vyacheslav Shostakovsky, another Democratic Platform leader,
agreed: ``For me, nothing has been explained, nothing is happening,
just as we predicted.'' He voiced concern that the party's
conservative wing was gaining strength and could endanger
perestroika, Gorbachev's reform program. He said the conservatives
were drawing support from the party apparatus.
   Lysenko told a news conference that it was necessary to leave
the Communist Party in its current form and to create a new
political structure, but he gave no details.

   Leaders of the nation's largest teachers
union focused attention Friday on ways to improve the training of
America's future educators.
   Don Cameron, National Education Association executive director,
said a teacher education reform initiative will begin in November
to link universities and colleges of education with local school
districts so innovative curriculum ideas and teaching techniques
can be tried out in classrooms.
   ``Too often, teacher education programs seem rooted in the
rarified air of academia rather than in the realities of the
classroom,'' he said.
   Cameron said negotiations are under way with several colleges
and universities, including the University of Maryland, Eastern
Michigan University, the University of Delaware, several
traditionally black institutions in the South and three colleges in
Tennessee.
   Many school districts are enthusiastic about the idea, said
Cameron.
   The program will be coordinated by Sharon Robinson, director of
the NEA National Center for Innovation. She said the center will
see that teacher education programs make sure future teachers can
effectively use new classroom technologies, such as computers, and
that their training includes the latest findings in educational
research.
   ``Future teachers must be better prepared to help all their
student think for themselves,'' said Cameron. ``Almost everybody
agrees students must be better taught to analyze, synthesize and
use knowledge.''
   The announcement came one day after the 8,100 NEA delegates
abandoned opposition to so-called alternative or non-traditional
teacher certification and agreed to allow scientists,
mathematicians and other mid-career professionals to teach while
receiving the training needed to obtain a license.
   ``The initiative will not seek to impose any one particular
model for teacher preparation on schools of education,'' said
Cameron, pointing to Thursday's action as proof ``there can be many
roads to licensure without the sacrifice of high standards.''
   Arthur Wise, president of the National Council for the
Accreditation of Teacher Education, said about 200,000 teachers are
hired each year and the reform initiative should strengthen their
preparation for the classroom.
   Wise said many of the criticisms of current programs are that
they do not adequately prepare teachers academically and fail to
provide rigorous teacher training or classroom methods.
   Before wrapping up its convention in Boston this week, the
American Federation of Teachers announced a similar program.
Officials selected Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Rochester, N.Y., as
sites for helping educators determine the best ways for student
teachers to learn new skills that can be adapted to restructured
schools.
   Each site, selected from among proposals submitted jointly by
teachers' unions, school districts and universities, will receive a
one-year grant of about $30,000 from the Exxon Education Foundation
for planning and preparation.

<TEXT>
   Whitey Herzog resigned Friday as manager of the
St. Louis Cardinals, saying he was embarrassed by a baseball team
that he'd turned into one of the best of the 1980s.
   Herzog, who took the Cards to the World Series three times in
his 11 years as manager, made the announcement at a news conference
in San Diego, where his team was playing the Padres.
   ``I made up my mind in San Francisco,'' Herzog told reporters.
``I was totally embarrassed by the way our team played. I just feel
very badly for the ballclub, the organization and the fans.''
   The Cardinals, who won the World Series under Herzog in 1982 and
were National League champions in 1985 and 1987, are 33-47 this
season and in last place in the National League East, 14{ games
behind the Pittsburgh Pirates. They beat the Padres on Thursday
night 4-1.
   ``I am the manager, and I take full responsibility,'' said
Herzog, who has won 822 games, second only to Red Schoendienst's
1,028 on the team's all-time list.
   Only Tommy Lasorda, who has managed the Los Angeles Dodgers
since 1977, has been with the same team longer than Herzog among
active managers.
   The team's top officials, president Fred Kuhlmann, general
manager Dal Maxvill and executive vice president Mark Sauer, flew
to California for the announcement.

<TEXT>
   Representatives of the government of Cyprus
open an exhibit Saturday of old treasures from the neighborhood of
Famagusta, a port city now held by Turkish Cypriots with the
support of Turkish troops.
   Among the exhibits are 1,400-year-old Byzantine mosaics from the
church of Panayia Kanakaria in the village of Lythrangomi. The
show's catalog says the mosaics were removed from the church, taken
to Europe and brought back there by the Cyprus Department of
Antiquities for return to the island.
   Other mosaics from the same church came into the hands of a
dealer in Indianapolis, Ind. Their future is still in the hands of
U.S. courts.
   The show includes finds that go back more than 3,600 years:
statues, paintings, jewelry, pottery, swords, coins and other
objects.
   It will continue until Thursday at the Washington hotel that is
the site of the 30th biennial Clergy-Laity Congress of the Greek
Orthodox Diocese. It has been seen earlier on the Greek island of
Rhodes and in London. No other U.S. stops have been announced.
   The exhibit has had invitations from West Germany, Sweden, the
Soviet Union and other countries.
   The Turkish army invaded the northern part of the island in
1974. Greek-speaking Cypriots, usually barred from the area, say
most of Famagusta has been deserted since 35,000 Greek speakers
fled the city.

<HEAD>Military Says Officer Accused of Cover Up Detained</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military said Friday it had
detained an officer accused of covering up the murder of six Jesuit
priests, but the court that ordered his arrest said he had not been
turned over.
   San Salvador's 4th Criminal Court ordered the arrest of Lt. Col.
Camilo Hernandez on June 26. As late as Thursday, he was still in
command at his elite infantry battalion.
   An armed forces spokesman on Friday said Hernandez had been
detained.
   By law, he must be turned over to the court for arraignment. A
spokesman for the court said that had not been done.
   ``Lt. Col. Hernandez has not been brought here, and we have not
been advised of his arrest,'' said a court official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Hernandez is accused of burning of military log books that could
have shed light on movement of troops implicated in the Nov. 16
murder of six Jesuit priest-educators, their housekeeper and her
daughter.
   Hernandez denied the allegation in sworn testimony before the
arrest warrant was issued.
   Armed forces spokesman Maj. Mauricio Chavez Caceres said the
warrant for Hernandez' arrest was executed late Thursday. He said
he did not know where the officer was being held.
   As a military officer, Hernandez will get special treatment
after arraignment. Instead of being sent to prison to await trial,
he will be confined to an apartment at the headquarters of one of
El Salvador's police forces. All three police forces are part of
the Defense Ministry.
   Though international human rights groups blame the armed forces
or military-linked death squads for the abduction and murder of up
to 30,000 suspected government opponents during a decade-old civil
war, no officer has been convicted, or even tried, for human rights
abuses.
   The priests were killed Nov. 16 during a major rebel offensive
in the capital.
   The slayings provoked an international outcry and calls from
some quarters in the U.S. Congress for a cut in American aid to El
Salvador.

   Black leaders on Friday called for a federal probe
of the violent arrests that ended a Haitian protest. Police
defended their actions and blamed the confrontation on
well-organized agitators.
   Fifty-eight Haitian were arrested Thursday outside a Cuban-owned
store when club-wielding police waded into demonstrators who had
refused orders to disperse. Fourteen demonstrators were
hospitalized but all were released by Friday.
   The crowd was protesting the alleged beating of a Haitian
shopper by store employees in a dispute over a pair of pants last
week, a sign of heightened tensions between blacks and Hispanics
since Nelson Mandela's strife-ridden visit here.
   The local National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People joined Haitian exile leaders at a boisterous news conference
in Miami's Little Haiti neighborhood Friday to criticize the
arrests and call for a Justice Department civil rights
investigation.
   The NAACP was ``simply outraged by ... the excessive use of
force that has been committed on our brothers and sisters,'' said
local leader Johnnie McMillian. ``We do not want to see them
treated as second-class citizens.''
   She said the violence should be seen as an attack on all blacks,
not just Haitians.
   Haitian exile leader Rev. Gerard Jean-Juste called for a boycott
against the store where the beating allegedly occurred and, more
broadly, against any business that treated Haitians poorly.
   ``The demonstrations in the Haitian community were initiated
precisely because there has been an unfortunate pattern and history
of violence directed against Haitians by Hispanic shopkeepers in
our commnity,'' Jean-Juste said. ``This pattern of violence cannot
and will not be tolerated.''
   Ms. McMillian said the situation was aggravated by the decision
of police to transport 32 of the people arrested to the Krome
Avenue Detention Center run by the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service. Most were released, but seven remained
there Friday facing possible deportation for lack of legal
residence papers.
   The Krome center is a source of frustration for Haitians, who
say that while Cuban-Americans are granted instant freedom when
they arrive, Haitians are turned back at sea or confined in the
detention camp.
   Miami city officials have kept a low profile since the first
protests over the June 29 altercation at the Rapid Transit Factory
Outlet clothing store.
   Although Cuban-born Mayor Xavier Suarez was elected with
widespread black support, his snub of Mandela over the South
African anti-apartheid leader's praise for Fidel Castro outraged
many blacks.
   Only black Police Chief Perry Anderson has spoken publicly about
the demonstrations, trying initially to calm Haitians. But on
Friday he was defending his officers, saying police had simply been
pushed too far.
   ``We begged, we pleaded, we negotiated'' before moving in,
Anderson said. He accused some protest leaders of acting in bad
faith.
   ``It's well-organized, and we're aware that some of the people
doing this are bent on creating disturbances and creating a larger,
blown-up situation,'' the chief said.
   All was calm at the shopping plaza housing the store Friday
afternoon.

<HEAD>Israeli Jets Strike Two Palestinian Guerrilla Bases</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RASHAYA, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli warplanes on Friday pounded two
bases in Syrian-policed north and east Lebanon used by a radical
Palestinian guerrilla faction, wounding at least eight guerrillas,
police said.
   Police said the fighters from the Libyan-backed, Damascus-based
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command were
wounded in simultaneous air attacks.
   In Israel, the military confirmed it raided two bases and said
its planes returned safely.
   The four Israeli jet fighters targeted a base on the southern
edge of the town of Sultan Yacoub in the eastern Bekaa valley and a
base near the Palestinian refugee camp of Nahr el-Bared in northern
Lebanon.
   Both regions are controlled by Syrian troops.
   Security sources in the south, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said before the attacks, three Israeli warplanes flew
patrols over southern Lebanon, dropping more than 1,300 flares to
illuminate the sector that borders Israel.
   A police spokesman said three guerrillas were wounded in the
raid on the base at Sultan Yacoub and five in Tal Hayat.
   The base at Sultan Yacoub housed an ammunition depot, a
guerrilla training camp and a communications center, said the
spokesman, who cannot be further identified in line with
regulations.
   The base at Tal Hayat housed a naval command center.
   He said the jets scored direct hits on the bases, inflicting
severe damage. The ammunition depot at Sultan Yacoub was set
ablaze, generating a chain of explosions.
   The warplanes also dropped three delayed-action bombs at the
Sultan Yacoub base, the latest of which exploded at 10:30 a.m.,
three hours after the air attack, the police spokesman said.
   He said no one was hurt in the later blasts, which went off
after Lebanese Red Cross rescuers evacuated the wounded guerrillas.
   ``One of them is in critical condition. Another guerrilla lost a
leg ... and the third has shrapnel wounds all over his body,'' he
said.
   Palestinian guerrillas opened fire at the raiding jets with
twin-barrelled 23mm anti-aircraft guns, but no hits were observed,
the police spokesman said.
   The guerrilla group, led by Ahmed Jibril, has been blamed for a
series of raids, including the Nov. 27, 1987, hang-glider attack on
a northern Israeli army base that left six Israeli soldiers dead
and eight wounded.
   Sultan Yacoub is about 24 miles north of the Israeli border.
Nahr el-Bared is more than 100 miles north of Israel.
   Friday's air attack was Israel's 13th raid on Lebanon this year.
By police count, 16 people were killed and 31 wounded in the 12
previous Israeli air strikes.

   Gen. Colin L. Powell, the nation's top
military officer, on Friday announced plans to visit five Mideast
nations.
   In another development, the Pentagon said Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney was cutting short his current European trip.
   Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, leaves Saturday
from Andrews Air Force Base, Md., for Morocco and also will visit
Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan and Israel for talks on regional security
issues. He is scheduled to return to Washington on July 13.
   No other details of the trip were made public.
   The Pentagon said Cheney would skip planned visits to Spain and
Portugal in order to return to Washington on Tuesday to participate
in budget deliberations.
   Cheney was in Crete on Friday and was scheduled to travel to
Greece on Sunday and Turkey on Monday before heading back to
Washington on July 10. He originally was scheduled to return on
July 14 after visiting Madrid and Lisbon.
   The Pentagon announcement said Cheney hoped to reschedule the
Spain and Portugal visits for this fall.

<HEAD>Task Force Says No Evidence Dealers Sold Stolen Pets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department task force reported
Friday that licensed dog dealers the government has investigated in
the Midwest have not knowingly engaged in selling stolen animals to
research laboratories.
   But two dealers may be prosecuted for falsifying records, said
James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service.
   ``After tracing many cases of sales of dogs to dealers, no
evidence was found to indicate dealers were knowingly buying stolen
animals,'' Glosser said. ``However, the task force did find
evidence indicating that two dealers may have falsified records and
that 29 individuals were dealing in the wholesale movement of dogs
without the required license.''
   The agency ``is considering prosecution of these licensed
dealers'' and has issued warnings to those without licenses, he
said.
   No names or locations of the animal dealers were released by the
agency.
   The investigation began in April in response to allegations from
private individuals, human groups and pet organizations that stolen
pet dogs in the Midwest were being sold to research institutions
through USDA-licensed ``Class B'' dealers.
   Those include dealers who buy and resell animals for regulated
purposes.
   Although the investigation began with licensed dog dealers in
Missouri and Arkansas, additional dealers were added in Illinois,
Indiana and Tennessee for possible investigation, Glosser said.
   The task force also contacted state police and county sheriffs'
offices for possible leads on stolen dogs, he said.
   Federal law _ the Animal Welfare Act _ requires every federal
licensed or registered business, institution or agency to record
the name and address of every person from whom it buys a dog or cat.
   Each dog and cat must have an identity number and description.
Newly acquired animals must be held for five business days to
facilitate tracing lost or stolen animals.

   The Central Park jogger who was gang raped and
beaten was fighting and thrashing so much when she was brought to a
hospital she had to be restrained, an emergency room nurse
testified Friday.
   Thomas Bello, 26, the nurse in charge of Metropolitan Hospital's
emergency room when the woman was brought in around 2:30 a.m. on
April 20, 1989, also gave the first testimony indicating the jogger
was the victim of a sex attack.
   ``The patient was agitated,'' Bello said. ``She was fighting _
in a fighting response. She was swinging her arms and kicking her
legs.''
   Prosecutors estimate the jogger was attacked by a marauding gang
of teen-agers five hours earlier, around 9:30 p.m., while running
in the northern end of the park.
   The nurse said that as he and others began treating the woman,
they wrapped gauze around her arms and legs and tied them to the
bed.
   Despite her thrashing, the woman did not respond to voices or to
being shaken, Bello said.
   ``She would only respond to deep pain,'' he added, such as a
needle being pushed into her arm.
   The woman was covered in mud and blood and there was a deep gash
in the back of her head, Bello said. He said he washed the victim's
dirt and blood encrusted hair and her face as best he could.
   Bello also said there was swelling in her genital area. ``I also
noticed there was debris'' around the genitals, the nurse said.
   Dr. Robert Kurtz, the surgeon who supervised the jogger's
treatment at Metropolitan, testified Thursday that she had semen in
her vagina, but he did not suggest there had been forced sex, and
he was not asked about that.
   Bello also said he saw a 3-inch-long abrasion along the left
inner thigh.
   After stabilizing the jogger, a doctor did tests to look for
evidence of rape, Bello said. Samples were turned over to police.
   Bello was the 22nd prosecution witness to testify in Manhattan
state court at the trial of Antron McCray, 15, Raymond Santana, 16,
and Yusef Salaam, 16.
   All three are charged with attempted murder, rape, sexual abuse,
assault, robbery and riot in the attack on the woman and two male
joggers, John Loughlin and David Lewis.
   The female jogger, an investment banker who is now 29, was
gang-raped, savagely beaten and left near death.
   She survived, but suffered brain damage and has no recollection
of what happened to her that night, the prosecutor has said.
   McCray, Santana and Salaam are on trial in an adult court, but
if convicted they will be sentenced as juvenile offenders and
receive up to 10 years in prison.
   Three other youths accused in the attacks are to stand trial on
the same charges later this year.

   New Hampshire bucked a national trend and
was the only state to show a gain in wine consumption last year,
according to a survey.
   Americans last year drank 2.11 gallons of wine per capita, the
lowest consumption of any major wine-producing nation and a 5.8
percent drop from 1988, according to figures released Thursday by
the trade publication Wines &amp; Vines.
   By comparison, Americans over age 21 drank 33.7 gallons of beer,
2.16 gallons of distilled spirits, and about 35 gallons of coffee.
Adult-only wine consumption was 3.03 gallons per capita.
   It was the second straight year wine consumption declined; in
1988 consumption dropped 5 percent from 1987 figures, Wines &amp; Vines.
   Mississippi drank the least, a mere half-gallon per capita in
1989, and consumers in the District of Columbia the most at 5.55
gallons for every man, woman and child.
   Drinkers in California, New York and Washington, the top three
wine-producing states, drank more wine than the average per capita
intake.
   Reflecting a national trend against alcohol consumption,
individual states posted figures showing as much as a 19.5 percent
drop from 1988. That distinction went to Arizona, where a
half-gallon less of wine was consumed last year than in 1988.
   Domestic table wines, still wines not over 14 percent alcohol,
fell 2.6 percent while production of domestic champagnes dropped
6.3 percent. Last year marked the fourth straight year of decline
for foreign champagne sales in this country; they were down 7.8
percent to 12 million gallons.
   In 1985, champagne imports to the United States hit a peak of
15.8 million gallons, almost all of it from Italy, France and
Spain, which together produce more than half of the wine consumed
in the world.
   California wines accounted for 72.8 percent of all wine consumed
in the United States, while the other 42 wine-producing states held
12.6 percent of the market. The rest of the market, 14.6 percent,
were imports.
   Wines &amp; Vines blamed the market drop on the continuing loss of
ground of generic or jug wines, nearly all of it produced in
California's San Joaquin Valley, and a 16.7 percent dip in wine
cooler sales.
   It was the second double-digit loss in two years for the
coolers, sales phenomenon of the early 1980s that literally rescued
California wine for several years. In 1988 and 1989, cooler sales
fell 33.3 million gallons, falling from 21 percent of wine market
share to 17 percent last year.
   Still, the coolers _ mostly cheap white wine, fruit juice and
carbonated water _ represented one of six gallons of wine sold in
this country last year.
   U.S. wine exports were up again in 1989 as foreign sales
increased to a miniscule 22.1 million gallons in 1989 from 16.9
gallons in 1988. The top two markets are Canada, 5.7 million
gallons, and Japan, 5.5 million gallons.

   Consumer complaints to the government about
airlines hit a five-year low in May, the Transportation Department
said Friday.
   The department received 689 complaints for the month compared to
826 in April and 805 in May 1989, the department said. It said the
peak of 7,280 came in August 1987 and the trend since then has been
downward.
   Federal officials believe the trend reflects improved
performance by the airlines, said department spokesman Hal Paris.
   Reports of mishandled baggage, however, were up slightly. The
May average was 5.92 complaints for every 1,000 bags handled
compared to 5.85 for April.
   The most common complaints concerned cancelled or delayed
flights. May statistics showed 80.8 percent of all flights operated
within 15 minutes of their scheduled time, compared to 82.2 percent
in April. Delays caused by mechanical problems were not included.
   Southwest Airlines had the lowest complaint rate among major
carriers for May, with 0.47 per 100,000 passengers. TWA had the
highest with 4.62.
   America West was first in on-time arrivals, with 91.8 percent,
followed by Alaska, Eastern, Pan Am, Southwest, Northwest, USAir,
Delta, American, United, Continental and TWA.
   The department took over the job of counting complaints in 1985
from the now defunct Civil Aeronautics Board. The only complaints
counted are those telephoned or mailed directly to the department
in Washington.

<HEAD>Official: Bush Will Wait To Unveil Anti-Poverty Program</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush probably will not make a final
decision this year on the development of an anti-poverty program,
an administration official said Friday.
   ``It could well go into next year before any final decisions are
made,'' said a White House official, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity.
   The news drew differing reactions from two experts asked by the
White House to offer suggestions for shaping a federal anti-poverty
policy.
   Isabell V. Sawhill of the Urban Institute said the
administration ``went through a lot of effort and came up with a
mouse'' in its slow approach to dealing with poverty.
   But Douglas J. Besharov of the conservative American Enterprise
Institute, defended the administration, saying Bush was ``just not
coming forward and saying, `I have a new program that will solve
all the problems.'''
   Besharov and Sawhill were among outside experts summoned to the
White House in September for a meeting on the poverty issue.
   Thirty-two million Americans live in poverty, as defined by the
government. The issue had been studied by an inter-agency group
convened last year and more recently by the administration's
Domestic Policy Council.
   The official who spoke anonymously said, ``You may see in the
shorter term some decisions that give an indication of the
direction we are headed in, but there will be no final decisions
for quite some time.''
   Deputy White House Press Secretary Stephen Hart confirmed that
Bush is waiting before deciding how to structure a program.
   ``Certainly no final decisions on what options should be
considered by the president have been made. This is a long-term
process,'' he said.
   Sawhill said, however, that she was ``frankly quite disappointed
that they could not agree on an overall strategy.
   ``There were a lot of good ideas put forward, both from people
who were consulted externally, and also ... within the
administration,'' she added. ``I think it was a serious and worthy
effort, but it seems to have fallen victim to some combination of
ideology and budgetary pressures.''
   But Besharov said that while some people might be disappointed
by the administration's position, he believes the administration is
``in the process of a long-term examination of what could be done''
and waiting to unveil a program ``is probably the wisest thing to
do at this point.''
   He added, ``What is important is to improve the programs that
are in place.''
   Besharov said a number of proposals were considered during the
administration's deliberations.
   They included:
   _ Having the government help residents of poor areas establish
``management corporations'' that would fight crime, attempt to
improve schools and repair housing.
   _ Allocating a larger share of federal aid to high-poverty areas.
   _ Providing financial subsidies to job contractors to help them
match up applicants from high poverty areas with job openings.

<HEAD>Christian Science Couple Must Take Their Children To a Doctor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHANIE SCHOROW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge Friday placed a Christian Science couple
on 10 years' probation for denying medical care for the dying son,
and ordered periodic medical examinations for their other children.
   The couple, convicted of manslaughter in their son's death, said
they would comply the order.
   ``We always tried to obey the law ... and we'll try to obey the
judge's instructions,'' David Twitchell said after he and his wife,
Ginger, were sentenced to 10 years' probation by Suffolk Superior
Court Judge Sandra Hamlin.
   The Twitchells, lifelong Christian Scientists, were convicted by
a jury July 4 of recklessly and wantonly causing the death of their
2{-year-old son Robyn by relying solely on prayer to heal the boy.
Robyn died April 8, 1986, and an autopsy showed he suffered from a
congenital defect that had caused a bowel obstruction.
   On Friday, Hamlin placed the Twitchells, who faced up to 20
years in prison, on 10 years' probation and said that they must
take their three children to periodic health checkups under
guidelines for children set by the American Medical Association.
   She said a doctor should be called at ``any signs of serious
illness'' in the children _ Elias, 9 months old, Brian, 2 years
old, and Jeremy, 8.
   Hamlin asked to receive monthly reports and said she would call
for an immediate hearing if there were any violations of the
conditions.
   Hamlin denied a defense motion to stay the sentence pending the
outcome of an appeal, which was filed Thursday.
   Defense lawyer Steve Lyons said Friday the defense would appeal
that denial next week.
   In a brief statement after the sentencing, Twitchell said that
while he would obey the judge's order, he would ``always pray
first'' for his children's health.
   ``We have never ruled out medical care. We just feel prayer,
God's power, is a lot better,'' he said.
   Special prosecutor John Kiernan had asked for a ``very lengthy''
period of probation for the Twitchells, who now live in Brentwood,
N.Y.; periodic medical checkups of their children; and that the
couple perform community service ``designed to benefit young
children.''
   Suffolk County District Attorney Newman Flanagan said that the
commonwealth decided to prosecute the Twitchells ``with the single
intention of protecting the rights of children from neglect.''
   The trial attracted national attention, in part because it was
held in Boston, headquarters of the Christian Science Church.
   The church teaches that sickness and disease can be healed by
spiritual means alone. Church officials have said the case
represents an attack on their religion and expressed confidence it
would be overturned on appeal.
   ``The decision to go forward with this case may not been
considered a popular one,'' Flanagan said after the sentencing.
``However, we proceeded with this case in the hope that parents of
all children, no matter what their religious beliefs, must be held
responsible and accountable for providing their children with
proper medical care.''

   ``In my 32 years with Arco Chemical Company, I can't remember

all of the employees and myself grieve the loss of fellow
employees. One loss of life is not acceptable.''

   An admitted cocaine addict testified in Marion
Barry's drug and perjury trial Friday that she supplied crack
cocaine to the mayor ``about 25 times'' in three months and brought
it to him once along with a job application.
   Lydia Pearson, testifying with immunity from prosecution, said
she delivered cocaine to Barry once at the office of Barry campaign
manager Anita Bonds.
   ``He gave me the money'' for the crack and ``I gave him the''
application, she testified.
   Bonds was not there at the time. Pearson eventually did get a
city job as a contract representative in public housing, but said
she recently left it.
   Pearson, supporting statements by Rasheeda Moore, the former
model who cooperated in the FBI undercover sting against Barry,
said she supplied cocaine to the mayor from July-September of 1988
and lent the mayor her home for drug-smoking trysts.
   She said Barry would usually phone ahead from his official
limousine to say he was coming.
   ``I would let him in the house,'' she said, I would give him a
bag and he gave me money.''
   She also delivered crack to Barry at two hotels after the mayor
called her, she said.
   She said she usually brought three $30 bags, because ``that was
his usual.''
   ``He would give me $100, a lot of times he would give me the $10
change,'' she said.
   ``What did you do with the change?'' asked Assistant U.S.
Attorney Richard Roberts asked.
   ``Buy some crack,'' said the witness, who described herself as a
recovering drug addict.
   Pearson said she never saw Barry using drugs.
   Moore testified earlier in the trial she and Barry used drugs
more than 100 times, and that she got cocaine from Pearson for the
mayor.
   Barry, 54, is facing trial on 10 charges of cocaine possession,
one count of conspiracy and three felony charges of perjury.
   In another development, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson reversed his earlier ruling and said Nation of Islam leader
Louis Farrakhan and Bishop George Stallings may attend the trial as
long as they ``observe the proprieties of the court.''
   Stallings sat with Barry's wife, Effi, in the second row of
spectators on Friday. Farrakhan was not in court.
   Jackson reversed himself after an appeals court said spectators
cannot be barred merely because they advocate a particular
political or religious point of view.
   Pearson, a lifelong friend of Moore's, said Moore first brought
Barry to her home in February 1988. On three occasions, she said,
the mayor and Moore spent about an hour in the bedroom.
   ``Did you ever get high with the defendant?'' asked Roberts.
   ``No,'' she said.
   ``Did you ever see him get high on crack cocaine?''
   ``No.''
   Ms. Pearson said Barry came to her house for drugs when Miss
Moore stopped coming in July 1988.
   The prosecution also introduced telephone records showing calls
made from the mayor's limousine to Ms. Pearson's home.
   In other testimony, Barry's lawyers sought to cast doubt on the
FBI's physical evidence, including laboratory tests and the pipe
taken from the hotel room after Barry's arrest.
   An FBI laboratory technician testified that after Barry's
arrest, his blood showed an alcohol content of only .005 percent,
one-twentieth of the legal standard for intoxication. A videotape
of the sting shows Barry's glass was refilled with alcohol at least
three times.
   And FBI agent Frank O. Steele testified that investigators could
not find critical evidence for 90 minutes after the Vista Hotel
undercover sting.
   Steele said agents scoured the room for the pipe the mayor used
to allegedly smoke crack cocaine and overlooked some of the cocaine
used in the operation.
   Barry attorney Robert Mance played, again, the videotape of the
sting operation, seeking to portray a clumsy search of the hotel
room where Barry was arrested.
   ``There was concern that the crack pipe could not be located and
to find it as fast as possible,'' said Steele, who said he learned
of anxiety among FBI superiors over the pipe's location.
   Steele was in charge of evidence the night the three-term mayor
was arrested.
   Steele said that in searching for the pipe, he went through the
mayor's pin-striped suit jacket and did not notice what was later
identified as cocaine in an inside pocket. He testified he finally
found the pipe in an eyeglass case placed in a dresser drawer by
Moore.

<HEAD>Crackdown Forces Two Prominent Kenyan Lawyers Into Hiding</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two prominent attorneys went into hiding
during a growing government crackdown on critics of the one-party
state, the lawyers' associates said Friday.
   The U.S. State Department asked the government not to persecute
its opponents. It said it was ``distressed'' by the detentions of
at least 11 people Wednesday and Thursday, according to the
statement released by the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi.
   The two lawyers, Gibson Kamau Kuria and Paul Muite, disappeared
Thursday after police detained four of their associates, the
sources said on condition of anonymity.
   Kuria is an internationally known human rights lawyer, and Muite
has joined in the call for multiparty democracy.
   Thursday's detentions brought to at least 11 the number of
people seized since Wednesday in the crackdown. For months, the
government had been criticizing those calling for reform.
   Associates said Kuria and Muite planned to spend the next few
days organizing their personal and business affairs before either
surrendering to police or allowing themselves to be arrested.
   Kuria's wife, Scholastica, said she had urged the men to seek
asylum at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, but that they rejected the
suggestion.
   ``They feel that if there is any fight, they should fight it
here,'' she told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
   Since the beginning of the year, a loose coalition emboldened by
the changes in Eastern Europe has repeatedly accused the ruling
Kenya African National Union party of intolerance, corruption and
election-rigging.
   However, the government has rejected any move toward allowing
other parties.
   President Daniel arap Moi says that multiparty politics would
create ethnic strife among Kenya's 40 tribes and lead to tribal
warfare. He had threatened arrests, vowing to hunt down advocates
of multiparty democracy ``like rats.''
   This week's arrests came amid rumors of plans for a
pro-democracy rally on Saturday. The government has promised to
prevent such a demonstration.
   Those detained include Raila Odinga, son of Kenya's first vice
president; Gitobu Imanyara, a lawyer who edits a magazine critical
of the government's human rights record; and two former Cabinet
ministers, Kenneth Matiba and Charles Rubia.
   Matiba and Rubia have been at the forefront of the pro-democracy
campaign. The government is holding them for up to 14 days without
charge under public security statutes.

<HEAD>Fed Policy Makers Believed Allowing Lower Interest Was Dangerous</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve policy makers concluded in
their May meeting that inflation posed too great a danger to allow
interest rates to decline, minutes of the meeting released Friday
show.
   The 8-week-old records were made available amid signs that the
policy makers decided at their most recent gathering on Monday and
Tuesday to shift their policy and stand ready to nudge interest
rates lower if the economy weakens further.
   Unidentified government officials were quoted by The Wall Street
Journal Friday as saying they believed the directive adopted
earlier this week allows a relaxation of the tight credit policy if
additional signs of economic sluggishness emerge.
   Analysts were split over whether the June employment report
released Friday by the Labor Department provided such evidence. The
unemployment rate slipped from 5.3 percent to 5.2 percent, but
non-farm job growth was a weaker-than-expected 40,000.
   In May, members of the Federal Open Market Committee voted 10-1
to maintain the existing credit policy and directed central bank
officials to be equally ready to raise or lower rates, depending on
developments on inflation and economic growth.
   Members agreed that ``current information on business conditions
pointed on balance to relatively moderate but sustained economic
expansion.'' At the same time, the members ``generally agreed that
the prospects for significant reductions in inflation pressures
during the quarters immediately ahead were not promising.''
   Lee Hoskins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland
and a prominent advocate of a tough anti-inflation policy, voted
against the directive. He argued for a tighter credit policy ``to
help assure that progress would be made toward a reduced rate of
inflation.''
   Hoskins said tighter credit would ``enhance the credibility and
effectiveness of monetary policy in countering the persisting
strength of inflationary pressures,'' according to the minutes.
   Other members, who were not identified, went along with the
directive but said ``the need to contain and ultimately to reduce
inflation might well require a firming of policy at some point.''
   The Federal Reserve has been fighting inflation with higher
interest rates since early 1988. In mid-1989 it began nudging rates
down amid concern the economy might topple into a recession.
   However, since late December, the Fed has held steady. The
federal funds rate, the interest charged among banks for overnight
loans, has been 8.25 percent since then.
   In recent weeks, Bush administration officials, who are counting
on continued economic growth to bolster Republican chances during
the November congressional elections, have stepped up public
pressure on the central bank to lower rates.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady told reporters Thursday
that the Fed should not wait for a budget deficit reduction
agreement between the administration and Congress, but should lower
rates now to counter any dampening effects of higher taxes and less
government spending.
   ``It seems to me that it's not a wise idea to emphasize an
undying, forever, attack on inflation if it jeopardizes growth in
this country,'' he said.
   The open market committee, comprised of the seven Fed governors
and five of the system's 12 regional bank presidents, meets in
secret eight times a year to formulate monetary policy. Minutes are
released about six weeks later, a few days following the next
meeting.
   There was one vacancy among the governors at the time of the May
meeting.

<HEAD>Official Says U.S. May Call for Ban on Drift Net Fishing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Nations should move to ban drift
net fishing in the open seas if the practice continues to kill
fish, sea birds and dolphins at the rate shown in a study, a U.S.
official said Friday.
   The deaths ``from high seas drift netting continue to be of
great concern to the United States,'' said William Fox, assistant
administrator for fisheries at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
   ``I believe we need the statistically reliable sampling that a
program to be conducted this year will give us. But I also believe
that if the trend shown in last year's pilot program continues, the
United Nations must insist on an immediate moratorium of this
practice,'' said Fox.
   NOAA released a preliminary report summarizing figures for
catches reported by nine U.S., five Canadian and 32 Japanese
observers aboard high-seas drift net vessels from June to December
of last year. The study was conducted by agreement between the
United States, Japan and Canada, he said.
   The Commerce Department agency reported 59,060 albacore tuna,
58,100 blue sharks, 9,173 sea birds and 914 dolphins were captured
incidental to fishing operations.
   Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, D-Wash., said the numbers ``confirm my
worst fears _ wholesale destruction of our marine resources.''
   ``Perhaps most distressing, this new data has been withheld from
the public and Congress for the past six months while the
administration negotiated with these foreign countries to conduct
more studies,'' she said.
   ``We don't need more studies. We need to ban high seas drift
nets.''
   The agency said the pilot project covered only 4 percent of the
Japanese commercial squid drift net fishery and did not include
vessels from South Korea or Taiwan and so is not conclusive for the
entire fishery.
   The program is scheduled to expand this year to cover the Korean
and Taiwanese drift net fleets and to have additional observers in
the Japanese fleet. Altogether, the agency said, there will be
three times as many observers as in the pilot program last year.
   The United Nations, with U.S. support, has already recommended a
ban on large scale open sea drift net fishing beginning in mid-1992.
   Drift nets of up to 30 miles long have been used increasingly by
Japan, Taiwan and South Korea in recent years to catch squid. The
incidental catch of other species, especially salmon that originate
in the United States, has caused protests from the American fishing
industry.
   In 1987, Congress required the Commerce Department and State
Department to negotiate monitoring and enforcement agreements with
nations engaged in drift net fishing in the North Pacific.
Agreements for a two-year phased monitoring program were signed
last year.
   The nets are invisible to sea life as they float from a cork
line, scooping down as deep as 50 feet.
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, said earlier that the NOAA data
was based on reports from observers who boarded only 32 boats in
the 460-boat Japanese fleet.
   The House has approved a bill that would ban drift net fishing
and a similar measure has cleared the Senate Commerce Committee.
   Tina Harper, a director in the Washington office of the
Environmental Investigation Agency, a London-based conservation
group, said that organization's study showed 100,000 dolphins
killed every year in drift nets. She said an analysis based on a
U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization report indicated the figure
could be between 300,000 and a million.

<HEAD>Iliescu Resigns from Ruling Party</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Ion Iliescu resigned Friday
from the National Salvation Front, the party that was swept to
power by the December revolution and led to victory by Iliescu in
the May national elections.
   The Front, under the charismatic leadership of Iliescu and Prime
Minister Petre Roman, has dominated government since December's
violent ouster of communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Iliescu resigned from the party to conform with a temporary
electoral law enacted by the former provisional parliament that
stipulates that the president cannot be a leader of a political
party.
   Although the law does not apply to ministers, Foreign Minister
Adrian Nastase joined Iliescu in resigning from the party Friday.
   A communique issued by the Front said the party will be led by
its five vice presidents until a congress expected in September,
when a new party president will be chosen to replace Iliescu. The
five are Bogdan Patrascu, N.S. Dumitru, Sorin Vornicu, Claudiu
Iordache and Constantin Costescu.
   Patrascu said the party would be willing to ``discuss Iliescu's
readmittance'' if he should ever again wish to run for national
president.
   Although bitterly opposed by many intellectuals and accused by
opposition members of being a neo-Communist, Iliescu received more
than 80 percent of the vote in the race for the national presidency.
   In another development, the Romania Libera daily newspaper ran a
front-page appeal for concrete steps leading towards the
reunification of Soviet Moldavia and Romania.
   The communique, signed by six organizations favoring
reunification, also called for free movement across the frontier.
   The Soviet Union occupied Bessarabia, then a part of Romania in
June, 1940, and annexed it as the Soviet Republic of Moldavia.
   Demands for the return of the region have increased since the
ouster of the communists and a corresponding rise in nationalism.
The government has been cool to the idea of reunification, but the
media have increasingly promoted the concept.

<HEAD>Deadline Nearing For Drought-Hit Farmers To Refund Advances</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP BRASHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time is running out for farmers to refund up
to $400 million in advance crop subsidies they received from the
federal government in 1988 and 1989 when they were hit by drought.
   The oft-delayed deadline for giving back the advance deficiency
payments is July 31, and no change in the repayment date is likely
this time.
   The deadline already has been put off three times, and Sen. Kent
Conrad, D-N.D., tried unsuccessfully this spring to get Congress to
forgive the debt for some farmers who faced drought again this year.
   ``It's something Kent tried very, very hard to accomplish but
wasn't able to do so,'' said Conrad's press secretary, Laurie
Boeder.
   County offices of the Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service are to send notices later this month to the
farmers who owe the refunds, said ASCS spokesman Ray Wagoner.
   Each spring, the Agriculture Department will advance to farmers
40 percent of the deficiency payments they expect to receive that
year for wheat, corn and other crops in the government farm program.
   However, if market prices rise during the year, as they did
during 1988 and 1989, and the deficiency payments are smaller than
projected, the farmers are required to refund the overpayments.
   USDA estimates that farmers who lost crops to the 1988 and 1989
droughts owe $403 million in refunds. Corn growers owe $210 million
and wheat producers owe $89 million.
   Conrad, who believes the total is more like $200 million, tried
twice in May to amend an emergency appropriations bill to write off
the $30.8 million in refunds he predicted would be owed by farmers
who are likely to go through drought again this year.
   The forgiveness would have applied only to advances that farmers
received for crops that were never produced because of the drought.
Farmers would still owe refunds on crops they produced.
   ``Many of these people virtually have no opportunity to pay back
the advanced deficiency payments which they have received,'' said
Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., during one of the debates.
   In arguing for his amendment, Conrad said there probably would
not be another bill that could reach the president's desk in time
to beat the deadline.
   ``He's still looking for a vehicle that might get through the
process in time,'' Boeder said this week.
   Although the deadline is July 31, USDA will not charge interest
on the amount it is owed for 30 days, Boeder said. For the next 90
days, the government will charge 9 percent interest. After that,
the rate goes to 12 percent, she said.

<HEAD>Barry Won't Make Mayoral Endorsement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Mayor Marion Barry said Friday that he will
endorse none of the five Democrats vying for his job and urged his
loyalists to back whatever candidate they choose.
   ``What I've decided to do ... is not make any public
endorsement,'' Barry told about 100 supporters gathered outside the
federal courthouse where his drug and perjury trial is being held.
``Those (supporters) who feel compelled to move on can do so.''
   Top city government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the mayor realized that his shrinking number of supporters
already were making their own choices.
   ``He knows that his organization is already beginning to slip
away,'' said one of the mayor's top political advisers. ``At this
point, he doesn't have much to deliver anyway.''
   Barry refused to rule out the possibility of making an
endorsement in the future, but said that for now, ``I am busy with
my trial in the courtroom here.''
   Barry announced on June 13 that he would not seek a fourth term
while battling the criminal charges. The 54-year-old mayor has
pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine possession charges, one
misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge, and three felony counts of
lying to a grand jury about his alleged drug use.
   Five candidates are seeking the Democratic nomination.
   Since his January drug arrest, Barry had said he hoped to play a
role in picking his successor if he decided not to enter the race.
   But as Barry's drug trial _ with its allegations of cocaine use
and sexual promiscuity _ has continued, candidates have distanced
themselves from him.
   At the same time, several of Barry's top loyalists have begun
talking on their own with other campaigns, sources close to the
mayor's camp said.
   Rank-and-file precinct workers have also jumped to other
campaigns in recent weeks.

   Israel's new defense minister intends to reduce
the military's presence in the occupied lands in an effort to break
the stalemated peace process and avoid talks with the PLO, a report
said Friday.
   The Hebrew-language daily Yediot Ahronot said the move by
Defense Minister Moshe Arens is also aimed at avoiding a possible
cutback in U.S. aid that is feared if the peace process does not
progress.
   Defense Ministry spokesman Dan Naveh refused to confirm or deny
the newspaper report.
   If confirmed, the relaxation would be a major departure from
pledges by the new right-wing government to increase military
measures to combat Palestinian unrest in the occupied territories.
   The plan is being prepared by Arens as it becomes apparent that
the U.S.-supported idea of preliminary Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks in Cairo has failed, wrote Ron Ben-Yishai, a respected
military commentator.
   Israeli hard-liners have rejected the American proposal, fearing
it would mean negotiations with PLO representatives.
   Israel views the Palestine Liberation Organization as a
terrorist organization but Palestinians insist the PLO is their
sole legitimate representative.
   The Bush administration has shown an increasing impatience with
Israel's reluctance to begin the preliminary talks.
   Bush, speaking Friday at a press conference at the conclusion of
the two-day NATO summit in London, urged Israel to take action.
   ``There has got to be talks ... and we have got to go forward,''
he said. I'd like to think that Israel would now move forward
again.''
   The newspaper report said Arens wants to bypass the talks and
PLO participation by initiating a series of confidence-building
measures in the occupied territories that would culminate in
municipal elections.
   Arens reportedly said he hopes to then enter into direct
negotiations with elected city officials over Israeli proposals to
grant Palestinians limited autonomy, Ben-Yishai said.
   According to Yediot, the confidence-building measures include a
partial troop pullback from Palestinian population centers, a
long-standing demand by Palestinian leaders.
   Naveh said such a pullback was not ruled out.
   ``Our prescence in towns and refugee camps is contingent on the
level of Palestinian violence,'' he said.
   Late last month, Arens ordered troops redeployed along main
roads in the occupied territories, emphasizing travel security for
Jewish settlers at the expense of patrols in Palestinian towns.
   He has made a number of other good-will gestures in recent
weeks. Two colleges were opened by the army last month, and two
others are due to open next week.
   The army closed Palestinian universities and colleges shortly
after the start of the 30-month uprising, contending they were
hotbeds of unrest.
   In other developments, two Palestinians suspected of
collaborating with Israeli authorities were discovered dead in the
occupied territories.
   In a village near the occupied West Bank town of Tulkarem the
body of 45-year-old Khaled Mustafa Toubeh was discovered, Arab
reporters said.
   They said Toubeh had been kidnapped by masked Palestinian
activists in May and was slain on suspicion of cooperating with
Israeli authorities.
   The army said it was checking the report.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, 22-year-old Fadi Abu Aziz, was found
dead Thursday, the English-language Jerusalem Post newspaper
reported. The paper said he was killed on suspicion of cooperating
with Israeli authorities.
   The deaths raise the number of suspected collaborators killed by
fellow Palestinians to 232. At least 721 Palestinians have also
died of Israeli gunfire during the uprising, and 45 Israelis have
been slain.

<TEXT>
   Police attacked demonstrators Friday in
Albania's capital near the embassy district, where up to 4,000
asylum-seekers jammed diplomatic missions. Albania's Communist boss
offered no ``generosity'' for defectors.
   About 10,000 Albanians gathered in a central square, following
earlier protests demanding that leaders of the last hard-line
Communist nation in Eastern Europe adopt major reforms, according
to a sketchy report from Tirana by the Austria Press Agency.
   This rally remained silent, however. Some demonstrators on its
periphery scattered when police charged, only to regroup, according
to the Austrian agency, which reported no injuries.
   The APA reporter _ one of the few foreign correspondents in
Albania _ witnessed no other attacks.
   The clash occurred in Skanderbeg Square, not far from a
sealed-off area of Tirana containing embassies that became havens
for Albanians last week.
   Diplomats said more than 2,300 Albanians were holed up inside
more than a dozen embassies. One Western diplomat contacted in
Tirana from Athens put the number at up to 4,000, and reported
grave food and water supply problems.
   At a crisis meeting of the Communist Party Central Comittee,
party leader Ramiz Alia assailed the refuge-seekers and made clear
Albania's Communists were not thinking of yielding power.
   ``What is of fundamental importance is the fact that the masses
should be led by the party,'' said Alia, in comments reported by
Albania's state ATA news agency.
   ``There is no room for generosity'' in dealing with those who
refused to leave the embassies, he said.
   ``The aims and actions of these destructive, anti-democratic and
anti-Albanian forces go too far. We may be poor, undoubtedly we
have difficulties and shortages, but the foreigner has never solved
our troubles.''
   Under 45 years of hard-line Communist rule, travel for average
Albanians has been virtually impossible as the country's late
leader, Enver Hoxha, steered his 3.2 million people into increasing
isolation.
   But under Alia, who took over after Hoxha's death in 1985, the
country has increasingly sought ties abroad and has begun
implementing some cautious reforms.
   Alia has given no hint the leadership was considering any form
of political plurality of the kind now in place in formerly
monolithic Communist countries in Europe.
   Alia pledged continued reforms Friday but said only the
Communist Party could ``realize the genuine democracy, the human
rights, the country's progress and the defense of its freedom and
independence.''
   He promised a new election law, but strongly implied it would
not affect the Communist Party's monopoly on power. The meeting
will continue Saturday.
   The rush on the embassies continued Friday, even after the
government repeated a pledge to issue travel documents for everyone
seeking to leave the country.
   Many Albanians with passports and exit visas were seeking entry
visas from the various embassies. Some came and left during the
day; others, mistrustful of their government's pledges, joined
those already holed up for days, said diplomats.
   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
conditions were getting worse inside some of the embassies.
   West German officials in Bonn said well over 1,000
asylum-seekers were in their Tirana embassy. An employee of the
Italian Embassy in Tirana said the number there had grown to 700 by
evening. Other officials said the French Embassy held 400 and the
Polish and Czechoslovak embassies about 50 each.
   Authorities have rebuffed attempts by foreign governments to
send supplies.
   Refugees began fleeing into the West German Embassy on Sunday
night. Albanian guards shot and wounded two of them that night, the
Bonn Foreign Ministry said. It said from 30 to 40 asylum-seekers
were injured Monday night as they crashed their truck into the West
German compound to gain entry.
   An Italian Embassy employee reached from Rome described the
situation on the crowded embassy grounds as ``more tragic than
comic. ... This is an embassy designed for 10 people, you can
imagine what conditions are like.''
   APA said embassies were growing short of food and medicine.
   A Hungarian diplomat, describing the situation in the
neighboring French mission, said it was jammed, with many sleeping
in the embassy garden.
   The sometimes violent rush to the embassies follows last year's
exodus of East Germans to embassies in other East European
countries shortly before the fall of East Germany's hard-line
government.
   The Albanian Foreign Ministry on Thursday promised to grant
passports to those who have sought refuge in foreign embassies in a
desperate attempt to flee their homeland.
   Hundreds more continued to gather outside embassies and gained
entry to embassy compounds.
   West German and Hungarian diplomats said police were not
preventing people from approaching their embassies and were
allowing relatives to talk to the refugees through embassy compound
fences.
   A package of new regulations, entitling all Albanians over the
age of 16 to own a passport for foreign travel, took effect
Tuesday. It did not check the flow of asylum-seekers.
   Most of the Albanians who fled to foreign embassies before
Thursday entered in a rush during rioting that began Monday under
fire from Albanian security forces. Diplomats said at least three
people were wounded.
   ATA denied there were casualties.

   More people than normal were at work
in a section of a chemical plant that exploded into flames, killing
17 people, because a contract cleaning crew was on the job.
   Some terrified workers at the Arco Chemical Co. plant were able
to flee to safety.
   ``We were running through the mud just as fast as we could get
out of there,'' said Tommy McBridge, a plant worker who survived
the blast late Thursday. ``We knew what it was.''
   ``We just heard a big explosion and everybody said `Run!' and we
all took off,'' said Marlene Viscus, another plant worker.
   A one-block area of the Arco plant exploded and burned for four
hours before firefighters doused the flames.
   Ordinarily, only about five of the 50 Arco employees working at
the plant at that time would have been in the area of the
explosion, manager Earl McCaleb said. The others were contract
cleaning workers from Austin Industrial Inc., who were in for work
done sporadically at the plant.
   ``We use some contract workers in the plant for certain
operations,'' said Earle Bradford, vice president of public affairs
at Arco Chemical's headquarters in Newtown, Pa. He said he was
unaware of any problems occurring when contract workers were used.
   The Oil, Chemical &amp; Atomic Workers union has been critical of
petroleum companies' use of contract workers.
   Last year, a Phillips Petroleum Co. plant in nearby Pasadena
exploded, killing 23 Phillips and contract workers and injuring 130
others. Union officials said the use of contract workers,
unfamiliar with operations, contributed to safety hazards at the
plant.
   The plant, Arco Chemical's largest, produces intermediate
chemicals used in the manufacture of seat cushions, bedding, paints
and urethane packaging and gasoline additives, Bradford said.
   The plant provides about 560 million pounds of propylene oxide,
a ``building block'' chemical used to make seat cushions and
bedding, and 1.3 billion pounds of styrene monomer used to make
drinking cups and automotive parts each year.
   In addition, the plant produces about 20,000 barrels a day of
methyl tertiary butyl ether, a gasoline additive used as an octane
enhancer. Arco is the world's largest producer of MTBE, said Al
Greenstein, spokesman for Los Angeles-based Arco, parent company of
Arco Chemical.
   ``It's not the only MTBE plant, but we are the world's largest
manufacturer of MTBE and this is obviously a major plant for
MTBE,'' Greenstein said.
   The plant originally was built as Oxirane Chemical Co., a joint
venture between Arco Chemical Co. and Halcon International, in 1974
with production beginning in 1977. Halcon sold its interest to Arco
Chemical in 1980.

<HEAD>Canadian Hearing Adjourned On Nazi Rocket Scientist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An immigration hearing for Arthur Rudolph, an
83-year-old U.S. rocket scientist and alleged Nazi war criminal,
was postponed Friday after a dispute over who could attend the
hearing.
   The hearing is to determine whether Rudolph can remain in Canada
as a visitor.
   Rudolph, who was chief coordinator of the U.S. space agency's
Saturn V rocket program that put the first man on the moon, was
detained on his arrival Sunday from West Germany and ordered to
appear at an immigration hearing.
   Rudolph left the United States in 1984 in a deal with the U.S.
government. He renounced his U.S. citizenship and admitted his
complicity in war crimes, according to the U.S. Office of Special
Investigation. That allowed him to keep his pension from the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   He went to West Germany, where a government attempt to prosecute
him for war crimes failed to turn up enough evidence.
   Rudolph now says he was coerced into the agreement to leave the
United States and wants to return to clear his name.
   Rudolph appeared before Anthony Iozzo, an adjudicator for the
Canadian immigration service. But in nearly three hours of debate,
the only topic was whether the news media and two Jewish
organizations would be able to attend and who would get the 14
chairs reserved for spectators in the tiny hearing room.
   Rudolph's attorney, Barbara Kulaszka, moved for adjournment,
citing her client's fatigue and her need to study documents just
given to her by the three federal attorneys presenting the
government's case at the hearing.
   The next session was set for Wednesday.
   On advice from his lawyer, Rudolph refused to speak to
reporters, as did his wife and daughter.
   U.S. immigration officials had accused Rudolph of working
thousands of slave laborers to death to building V-2 missiles for
the Nazis during World War II.
   Rudolph, a former Nazi party member, says he did not persecute
laborers during his work on V-2s.

   Faced with complaints from Lech Walesa and
other critics, the prime minister Friday expelled three
ex-Communists from his Cabinet and pleaded for political calm.
   But Tadeusz Mazowiecki failed to soften the attacks on his
government, which is struggling to introduce a market economy and
complete the transition to democracy.
   Even members of the prime minister's Solidarity camp said they
expected bolder moves to restructure his 10-month-old
Solidarity-led government.
   Mazowiecki accepted the resignations of five of 24 Cabinet
ministers, including three of the four former Communists who were
included in the government last year as the price for Solidarity
taking power.
   The most prominent former Communists who departed were Interior
Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak and Defense Minister Florian Siwicki.
   The prime minister used most of his parliamentary address to
warn against ``party quarrels and struggles for personal ambitions
at the expense of the state.'' He said they could rob Poland of its
``priceless stability.''
   The remarks appeared to be a reference to Walesa, the Polish
labor hero who led the fight against the old Communist regime. Many
people now believe Walesa would like to succeed President Wojciech
Jaruzelski, another former Communist, as leader of Poland.
   In his speech, Mazowiecki declared: ``I see danger on the
peaceful Polish road to democracy.
   ``The sense of responsibility for the country is getting weaker
in political life. ... An opponent who should be defeated through
argument is treated as an enemy to be destroyed,'' he said.
   ``These are occurrences that cannot be tolerated even in the
most democratic country. I appeal for self-control. Poland needs
wisdom, peace and law-abidingness.''
   The prime minister appeared to be responding to criticism by
Walesa in ousting the ex-Communists and calling for parliamentary
elections ``much earlier'' than spring 1991, when they have been
scheduled.
   Walesa had no comment on Mazowiecki's nationally broadcast
speech.
   The Solidarity chairman has struck a populist chord with his
attacks on Mazowiecki. He has urged faster replacement of
Communists in the government and state-run industries, new
elections to remove Communists still in the parliament, and quicker
privatization of state enterprise.
   Legislators kept up their attacks on the government after
Friday's speech.
   Sen. Jaroslaw Kaczynki said he was only ``30 percent satisfied
with the changes.'' Kaczynki is a Walesa ally.
   ``The changes are much too small. He should have reconstructed
the whole government,' said Deputy Jan Litynski, a Mazowiecki
supporter.
   Litynski and other deputies interviewed urged fully free
parliamentary elections as soon as possible.
   Mazowiecki's Cabinet made history Sept. 12 when it was seated as
the East bloc's first non-Communist government.
   But it has been beset by difficulties. The government has faced
a major rail strike, used police to break up two farm protests and
defended itself against a steady stream of criticism from Walesa.
   The Cabinet changes finally take the police and military forces
out of the hands of former Communists.
   Gen. Kiszczak's departure ends a 10-year career as interior
minister. He oversaw the imposition of martial law to crush
Solidarity under Gen. Jaruzelski in 1981, and he served as a
chairman of the 1989 talks that made Solidarity legal again.
   Gen. Siwicki, another Jaruzelski loyalist, had been defense
minister since 1983.
   The third ex-Communist to be ousted was Transport Minister
Franciszek Wieladek.
   Also resigning were Agriculture Minister Czeslaw Janicki of the
Peasant Party and Telecommunications Minister Marek Kucharski of
the Democratic Party.
   The prime minister nominated four replacements. Parliament
accepted Krzysztof Kozlowski, a Roman Catholic editor who has been
serving as deputy interior minister, as head of that ministry; Rear
Adm. Piotr Kolodziejczyk, the Navy chief, as defense minister; and
Ewaryst Waligorski, a longtime Solidarity activist and deputy to
the transport minister, as the head of that ministry.
   Artur Balazs, the minister of rural life and co-founder of the
farmers' union Rural Solidarity, was nominated for agriculture
minister, but failed to win committee approval because of Peasant
Party demands that the post go to their group.

   A bomb exploded in a garbage can near a busy
thoroughfare in central London Friday morning, and a second device
was found and disarmed, Scotland Yard said. No injuries were
reported.
   The Irish Republican Army, which has bombed British targets as
part of its campaign to drive British troops out of Northern
Ireland, issued a statement saying it had no connection with the
incidents.
   The morning explosion was reported outside a bank near Waterloo
Bridge at 7:15 a.m.
   The explosion was about a mile east of Lancaster House, where
heads of state of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization were
concluding a two-day summit meeting.
   Commander George Churchill-Coleman, head of Scotland Yard's
anti-terrorist branch, was at the scene and a spokeswoman for
Scotland Yard confirmed that there was ``some kind of explosive
device.''
   ``There was a minimal amount of damage. I am told there was no
damage to buildings and no casualties,'' said the spokeswoman,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The second bomb was discovered in a household matchbox behind an
office of El Al, Israel's national airline, and next door to a fur
shop, police said.
   Bomb disposal experts defused the bomb.

   The nation's leadership Friday
warned the republic of Slovenia to abandon its declaration of
regional autonomy, saying it threatens Yugoslavia's federation.
   The country's eight-member presidential council said it ``will
take all measures ... to protect the integrity and sovereignty'' of
Yugoslavia, the state news agency Tanjug reported. However, the
announcement did not elaborate.
   Slovenia's new, freely elected legislature proclaimed its
autonomy on Monday. The move was viewed as a further challege to
Yugoslavia's fragile Communist-ruled federation.
   The authority of the federal leadership has effectively been
crippled since non-Communist, center-right parties won elections
this year in Slovenia and Croatia, another liberal republic. It was
the first free balloting in Yugoslavia in 50 years.
   Slovenia and Croatia are demanding a looser national
confederation.
   The current federation of six republics and two autonomous
provinces already allows each region to run its own government and
Communist party structure.
   The decentralized system of government was devised by the late
national leader Josip Broz Tito in the 1974 constitution. The
arrangement was intended to prevent one republic from gaining sway
over the others, but ethnic and economic differences are again
threatening the country's unity.
   In its statement Friday, the presidencial council said the
Slovenian declaration jeopardizes ``collective Yugoslav interests
and the country's position in the world.''
   The Slovenian declaration calls for the establishment of an
independent legal system that would take precedence over federal
laws. It also says Slovenian authorities should assert control over
all armed forces stationed on the republic's territory.

   Abrehem Selemon, 14, of Ethiopia, had been reported missing
Wednesday after he jumped from the merchant ship Pearl while it was
anchored 3{ miles off Morehead City. A Coast Guard search was
suspended when no sign of the youth was found.
   He was discovered early Friday aboard the Navy cargo ship Major
Stephen Pless, which had been anchored 2 miles from the Pearl when
Selemon jumped into the Atlantic.
   ``I don't want to speculate, but the only thing that could have
happened is that he swam to the ship and climbed up the anchor
line,'' said Coast Guard Ensign Charles Murphy.
   Selemon and a companion have been traveling the world at the
expense of a ship that doesn't want them.
   Selemon and Melles Aklilu Kassa, 30, have been on board the
Pearl, off and on, at least since before it left Syria loaded with
oil on May 22, said Bill D'Andrea, an agent with Curz Moran
Shipping Agents in Philadelphia, the firm that contracted for the
ship's visit to that city.
   ``As each port of call was reached, the captain went through the
motions of trying to get them off,'' said D'Andrea. ``They tried
sending them ashore in Trinidad; Gibralter; Naples, Italy, and some
other ports, but they didn't succeed.''
   Under U.S. immigration law, stowaways are the responsibility of
the ship on which they are found, said Immigration and
Naturalization Service agent Charles Van Der Miller.
   Where, when and why the two boarded the Pearl was a mystery. But
Selemon was back on the ship Friday after being transferred from
the Pless.
   ``He is in safe custody aboard my vessel,'' Glenn Pereira,
captain of the Pearl, said Friday in a ship-to-shore telephone
interview.
   He would not elaborate about the teen-ager's condition.
   ``That's all the information I can give you,'' he said. ``I'm
not permitted by management to give any statements.''
   INS officials declined to disclose Selemon's reasons for seeking
asylum, citing confidentiality regulations.
   Selemon had jumped from the Pearl, a Norwegian-registered
merchant ship managed by a Hong Kong firm, June 17 when it was
docked in Philadelphia, INS officials said. An INS hearing was held
in which Selemon asked for political asylum, said Van Der Miller,
in Philadelphia.
   The request was denied and Selemon was ordered returned to the
Pearl.
   Selemon jumped from the ship again when it was docked in
Wilmington, Del., and he was caught in New Jersey, Van Der Miller
said. No other details of that incident were available.
   Where the voyagers are headed next is unknown. Pereira said he
was awaiting orders from the ship's owners regarding his next port
of call.
   D'Andrea was sympathetic _ but for the Pearl's captain.
   ``I feel sorry for him,'' D'Andrea said. ``He had a real busy
voyage up here and things like this only make it more difficult.''

<HEAD>First 10 Acres for Super Collider Project Purchased</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The state bought its first 10-acre
parcel of land Friday for construction of the superconducting super
collider, a mammoth $8 billion atom smasher.
   More than 16,000 acres still have to be acquired from more than
700 Ellis County landowners just south of Dallas for the world's
largest scientific instrument.
   The collider will be a 54-mile underground ring, in which
protons will be accelerated to nearly the speed of light while
superconducting magnets force them to travel a circle. Two groups
of protons will be smashed together; scientists hope the resulting
wreckage of subatomic particles will offer new clues to the
fundamentals of matter.
   The first parcel was sold by retired banker E.R. Tut Morris and
his wife Tommie Morris of the Dallas suburb of Balch Springs for
$45,000.
   The Morrises drew applause when they removed a ``Contract
Pending'' banner from a sign, revealing ``Contract Sold''
underneath.
   ``I think it's a good thing for the history of the U.S. and for
Ellis County and Dallas County,'' said Morris. ``We're very pleased
with the price.''
   The land was purchased for the state by the Texas National
Research Laboratory Commission, which proposed the Ellis County
site for the collider to the U.S. Department of Energy.
   Ownership eventually will be transferred to the federal
government.
   The government is expected to spend $40 million to $100 million
for 10,000 acres of land and rights to the land underneath an
additional 7,000 acres. Acquisition is expected to be completed in
1992.
   Phillip Stafford, associate director for site development, said
the commission hasn't yet encountered landowners unwilling to sell.
   ``The process anticipates that there will be those who may not
be a willing seller,'' Stafford said. ``Our commission and other
state agencies or federal agencies have the power of eminent domain
to ensure the project is not held up for those reasons.''
   Hoyt Gaston, who owns 100 acres, says he'll be willing to sell
``if the price is right.''
   ``I'll be satisfied if I get a deal as good as (Morris) got,''
he said. Gaston is expecting an appraisal on his land in about a
month.
   In May, the House voted to build the collider and limited the
federal government's share in the giant science project to $5
billion.
   Costs above $5 billion would be left to Texas, which has pledged
$1 billion, and other sources, including foreign investors.
   The collider, scheduled to be completed in 1998, is expected to
provide 4,500 jobs during construction and 2,500 permanently.

   An explosion that could be heard 20
miles away leveled an area the size of a city block at a chemical
plant, killing 17 people and injuring five others, authorities said
Friday.
   ``It looks like a bomb went off in there,'' said Richard Bailey,
chief investigator for the Harris County Sheriff's Department Arson
Division.
   A tank exploded at about 11:30 p.m. Thursday at the plant about
15 miles east of Houston. The resulting fire was out by dawn.
   Company firefighters sprayed the area as other workers pulled
bodies from tons of twisted pipe and debris.
   ``In my 32 years with Arco Chemical Company, I can't remember
any single accident of this dimension where we've had multiple loss
of life to the extent we had here,'' said Jack Johnson, president
of Arco Chemical of North America. ``It certainly is a time that
all of the employees and myself grieve the loss of fellow
employees. One loss of life is not acceptable.''
   Assistant U.S. Secretary of Labor Gerard F. Scannell arrived at
the plant Friday afternoon to lead a federal investigation of the
accident. Scannell said the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration would conduct a comprehensive inspection.
   ``I'm concerned when there is any loss of life. We are concerned
with what's happening in the petrochemical industry,'' Scannell
told reporters.
   People as far as 20 miles away reported hearing the blast at the
plant, which has more than 350 employees.
   ``I seen a big flash cross in front of my eyes. I looked over to
my left and I saw a big ball of fire. ... It looked to me like a
tank run off, you know, like a rocket just took off,'' said Mike
Zugel, a truck driver.
   ``I was in a trailer and I was sitting down about to get up, and
it sounded like a car ran into the side of the trailer,'' said
Tommy McBridge, who was working at a janitorial service not far
from the plant. ``When we went out of there, it was like a nuclear
explosion _ just orange flames.''
   ``It sounded like somebody was breaking the house in,'' said
Deborah Baumbach, who lives six miles from the blast site.
   Plant Manager Earl McCaleb said two tanks that collected waste
water and chemicals exploded for an unknown reason. The larger tank
held 900,000 gallons, he said. The company had no capacity figure
for the smaller tank.
   ``They were not cleaning out the tank,'' McCaleb said.
   A truck of the sort used to remove wastes was in the area of the
tanks but it was not immediately known if it had anything to do
with the explosion, McCaleb said. One body was discovered in the
cab of the truck, officials said.
   Kathryn Cox, a member of the plant cleaning crew, said she and
several fellow workers had just finished their jobs when they heard
the explosion.
   ``We didn't look back,'' she said. ``We just started running and
we just kept running.''
   The body found in the truck was that of an employee of a
contractor. Of the other bodies found by midday Friday, five were
Arco Chemical employees, and 11 were employed by a contractor,
Austin Industrial Inc. of Houston.
   All five of the injured were treated at hospitals and released,
Johnson said.
   Henry Kelly, president of Austin Industrial, said his company
had 150 workers at the plant for maintenance and construction. He
said it has had an excellent safety record during 5{ years working
there.
   The plant had one safety citation, received in 1988 for a death
at an off-site fire training building, McCaleb said.
   Initially, authorities described Thursday night's blast as
relatively minor and said no injuries were reported and no
evacuations necessary. McCaleb said there was no attempt to
withhold information.
   It was the second major loss of life at a Houston-area
petrochemical plant in nine months. On Oct. 23, a Phillips
Petroleum Co. plastics plant in Pasadena was hit by series of
explosions that killed 23 workers and injured 130.
   On June 8, two people were injured in a spectacular explosion
and fire at a chemical packaging plant in Pearland, south of
Houston.
   Arco Chemical, which is based outside Philadelphia, has been
running the Channelview plant since 1980, three years after it went
into operation.
   The plant produces 560 million pounds of propylene oxide, used
to make flexible foam for seat cushions and bedding. The substance
also is used for cleaning compounds, according to a company
brochure.
   The plant also annually produces 1.3 billion pounds of styrene
monomer, used for insulation, foam drinking cups, packaging
materials and automotive parts, and 1.7 billion pounds of methyl
tertiary butyl ether, a high octane blending component used as a
replacement for lead in gasoline.
   McCaleb said four of the injured workers were treated at a
hospital and released. One was admitted to a hospital in nearby
Baytown.

<HEAD>Exxon Valdez to Return to Service As `Exxon Mediterranean'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The tanker Exxon Valdez, source of the nation's
worst oil spill, is headed back to sea after repairs to its
shredded hull. But it won't be going back to Alaska and its name
will be changed, officials said Friday.
   The vessel that spilled nearly 11 million gallons in Alaska's
Prince William Sound will be called the Exxon Mediterranean when it
returns to duty, due next month, said Exxon Shipping Co. President
Gus Elmer.
   ``Due to declining Alaskan crude oil, the vessel will enter
foreign service, most likely loading crude in the Mediterranean or
the Middle East. It is consistent with our policy that the vessels
be named according to their location,'' Elmer said.
   He declined to say that the environmental disaster in Alaska 16
months ago was a major factor in renaming the vessel and changing
its use.
   ``It is strictly an economics decision,'' he said.
   Alaska environmental commissioner Dennis Kelso, however, said he
believes the name change is due as much to public relations as
economics.
   ``I think the key question is what kind of tankers do we have
operating worldwide?'' Kelso said. ``The accident happened here,
but it could have happened in Puget Sound or San Francisco Bay _
wherever tankers transport crude or its byproducts.
   ``What broke down here was the system and the tanker was part of
it.''
   Former Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank Iarossi acknowledged
concerns that the ship's association with the disaster may make it
unwelcome in Alaskan ports. He said last summer that the tanker
might be renamed and possibly put to work elsewhere.
   The tanker ran aground on a reef on March 24, 1989, ripping the
bottom of its hull open and spilling oil that polluted hundreds of
miles of coastline and killed scores of animals.
   The 987-foot ship has been undergoing $30 million in repairs
since August in a National Steel and Shipbuilding Co. dry dock in
San Diego. The company built the ship in 1986.
   ``The ship's ready. She's going smoothly,'' said National Steel
spokesman Fred Hallett. ``We're finishing the painting on it right
now and we're doing some work in the machinery room.''
   A Coast Guard inspector, Lt. Bill Uberti, said National Steel is
scheduled to begin two weeks of trial runs after it is floated out
of dry dock on July 20.
   ``If there's a problem, they'll have to fix it before it can go
out into service, but I don't anticipate any problems,'' Uberti
said. ``The only damage to the ship was structurally, and that's
all been fixed.''
   The repair work included installation of 3,000 tons of new,
inch-thick steel hull plates on the 30,000-ton tanker.
   The ship had a single hull, meaning only one layer of steel
stood between its cargo and the open water.
   Exxon officials declined to retrofit the ship with a double hull
because it was not feasible from an engineering standpoint, Exxon
spokeswoman Carrie Chasin said in March.
   But Hallett said the ship could have been fitted with a double
hull. ``The question is the cost and the time,'' he said.
   Kelso said he favors double hulls.
   ``The fact the Exxon Valdez is being reassigned _ I expect it
will always be known by its former name and bottom _ leads to the
question, do we have vessels operating worldwide that have all the
protection they should have?'' the Alaskan official said.

<HEAD>NEA Theater Panel Denounces Rejection of Grants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VALERIE MEEHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A National Endowment for the Arts advisory
panel has denounced the agency's rejection of four grant
recommendations, and is urging reconsideration of the decision, the
panel chairman said Friday.
   ``I think it is really an issue of censorship,'' said Phillip
Arnoult, founder and artistic director of The Theatre Project, a
performing arts center in Baltimore.
   The panel that advises the NEA on financing solo performing
artists met by conference call Thursday, and plans to issue a
statement Wednesday in New York. Arnoult had originally asked the
NEA to reconvene the panel so panel members could resign in protest
if they chose. No panel members have quit so far.
   Arnoult refused to discuss the statement the panel plans to
issue, but he said at least two of those whose recommended grants
were vetoed would be present. The NEA accepted the panel's
recommendation of 14 other grants.
   In protest of the rejection of the four grants, one recipient,
Rachel Rosenthal, refused her grant for $11,250 last week. Arnoult
said he did not know if any of the other 13 would renounce the
money.
   They may follow New York performance artist Richard Elovich's
suggestion that each of the grantees donate part of their money to
the four, Arnoult said.
   The rejection of solo performance grants, announced June 29, has
created a furor in the arts world and prompted calls for the
resignation of NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer.
   Some critics contend that Frohnmayer vetoed the grants to try to
pacify Congress members outraged by the federal financing of
provocative works.
   Congress is scheduled to debate NEA's funding this month. Some
lawmakers are calling for the agency's abolition.
   Jessica Andrews, director of the endowment's theater program,
declined to comment Friday. Frohnmayer also had no comment.
   The four artists who did not receive grants recommended by the
advisory panel are Karen Finley, Holly Hughes, John Fleck and Tom
Miller. The grants ranged from $5,000 to $11,250 each.
   Miller, Finley, Hughes and Fleck all deal with political and
sexual issues in provocative ways.
   Fleck urinated or appeared to urinate onstage during one
performance. Finley, whose work has been singled out for criticism
by many conservatives, in a recent series of performances disrobed,
placed alfalfa sprouts in her crotch and denounced conservative
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., among others.
   Helms leads the drive to control NEA funds.
   He was instrumental in the adoption of anti-obscenity
restrictions attached to NEA's 1990 appropriation, which was
approved amid protests over works such as Robert Mapplethorpe's
homoerotic photography and Andres Serrano's crucifix submerged in
urine, both of which received federal funds.
   Arnoult said Frohnmayer's action overturned a 25-year tradition
of peer review, and described past awards of grants as
``statesmanlike.''
   ``While I'm deeply concerned about the careers and reputations
of these four artists ... I'm also very concerned about the moral
center of the endowment which has worked for 25 years _ which
represents a massive amount of public service in the field,''
Arnoult said.
   According to endowment records, in seven years before 1989, the
chairman has reversed advisory panels' recommendations on only 35
of 33,700 grants.
   ``The process is so clearly being politically manipulated and
that's just wrong. It censors some of the most talented artists in
the country,'' said William George, producing director of
Touchstone Theater in Bethlehem, Pa., and a member of the panel
chaired by Arnoult.
   ``You kind of feel a little helpless.''

   The government will pay $700,000 to
the families of two victims of rightist death squads, President
Rafael Leonardo Callejas said Friday.
   Callejas, who took office on Jan. 27, said the payments were
obligations from the past that must be honored.
   ``These situations are disagreeable and you have to forget about
them,'' he told The Associated Press. ``They are things of the past
and now we are facing the challenge of the future.''
   The legislature approved $625,000 for the family of Manfredo
Velasquez Rodriguez, a 28-year-old economist, and $75,000 for the
family of Saul Godinez Cruz, 32, an elementary education teacher,
the amounts ordered by the Inter-American Human Rights Court in
Costa Rica.
   The court, created by the Organization of the American States,
ruled both died at the hands of killers ``acting under the
protection'' of the government.
   The case was brought by the Honduran Human Rights Commission,
which blamed the murders on military death squads who preyed on
suspected leftists.
   Velasquez Rodriguez was last seen being arrested on Sept. 12,
1981. He had recently graduated from the National University, where
he was a student leader. Godinez Cruz was last seen being picked up
on July 22, 1982.
   They were among at least 300 people who human rights
organizations say died at the hands of death squads between 1979
and 1986.

   President Bush arrived in his adopted hometown
with a smile Friday night after ushering his ideas for reshaping
the Western military alliance to quick and easy approval at the
NATO summit in London.
   Aboard Air Force One enroute to Houston and another round of
summitry, this time with the leaders of the seven most
industrialized nations, Bush boasted that the ``London
Declaration,'' the communique issued earlier in the day by the NATO
leaders, ``was the United States draft.'' And ``that shaped the new
direction for NATO,'' he said.
   In London, it was Bush who announced at the conclusion of the
two days of talks among the 16 allied leaders that ``I'm pleased
... that my colleagues and I have begun a major transformation of
the North Atlantic Alliance, and we view it as a historic turning
point.''
   The president's design for a remodeled Western alliance gained
unusually easy approval, but he remained in the minority opposed to
direct financial aid to the Soviet Union. Most European NATO
members say such aid would help stabilize a deteriorating Soviet
economy and send a positive political signal. Bush, for his part,
ruled out any direct assistance pending changes in Soviet military
spending and its huge support for Cuba, but he indicated the United
States might be willing to accord the Kremlin some trading credits.
   The Soviet aid question is bound to be a major topic at the
Houston economic summit.
   During the 10-hour flight, Bush was informed that Eduard
Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister, had said that NATO's
``decisions ... move in the right direction and pave the way to a
safe future for the entire European continent.'' The president said
of that reaction: ``That's very interesting. And very positive.''
   Bush confided he had received a recent communication from Soviet
Leader Mickhail S. Gorbachev himself. But he merely winked and
smiled when asked to describe its contents.
   In London, Bush achieved his goal of preserving _ at least for
now _ a NATO that is the main instrument of U.S. influence in
Europe while pushing it toward changes that could make it more
acceptable to the Soviet Union.
   ``NATO has set a new path for peace,'' Bush said. ``It's kept
the peace for 40 years, and today charted a new course for
stability and cooperation in Europe.''
   France in particular has promoted the idea of diluting the
influence of both military blocs _ NATO and the nearly dead Warsaw
Pact that the Soviets dominated throughout the Cold War. Paris
wants a pan-European organization such as the 35-nation Conference
on Security and Cooperation in Europe to play a bigger role.
   Bush said the London meeting reaffirmed that NATO would survive,
and that while it would relax its military stance it would continue
to rely on the U.S. nuclear arsenal.
   ``This is indeed a day of renewal for the Atlantic community,''
Bush said. For more than 40 years we've looked for this day ... and
now that day is here and all peoples from the Atlantic to the
Urals, from the Baltic to the Adriatic can share in its promise.''
   The president managed to overcome initial skepticism from
Britain on his idea of modifying NATO's nuclear strategy and
declare that nuclear arms are ``weapons of last resort.'' But he
remained at odds with West Germany and France on the question of
whether to provide direct financial aid to the Soviet Union.
   ``I have big problems with that one,'' Bush said, adding that he
did not think the American public would accept sending money to
Moscow as long as Soviet defense spending remained high and the
Kremlin continued underwriting Fidel Castro's government in Cuba.
   Bush added, however, that he would not stand in the way of other
NATO countries that wished to aid the Soviets, whose economy is in
a shambles. West Germany has suggested a $15 billion Western aid
package for Moscow. The matter is expected to be discussed in more
detail at the Houston economic summit.
   ``If the Germans decide they want to do that, that's their
business, but I have made very clear to those who have spoken to me
about this at this juncture, we have some serious problems and I
have not been under any false colors about that at all,'' Bush said.
   Bush also acknowledged that he faced growing opposition in
Congress to keeping a large U.S. troop presence in Europe. He said
the NATO reforms adopted at the London meeting could help him
persuade his critics that the troops are necessary.
   ``I view it as my responsibility to make clear to the American
taxpayer why it is in our interest to help keep the peace. And
that's exactly what these forces are engaged in,'' he said.

<HEAD>Fang Lizhi Accuses U.S. of Double Standard on Human Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RENEE SCHOOF</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fang Lizhi, the Chinese dissident who took
refuge for a year in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, said the United
States has a double standard on human rights.
   In an interview with NBC News, he said the United States was
less demanding of China on human rights issues than of other
countries, but added, ``Of course, they are better than before.''
   The West generally has less knowledge about China's human rights
record that it does of Eastern Europe's and the Soviet Union's
record, he said.
   The interview, conducted Thursday in London, was broadcast in
part on Friday's ``NBC Nightly News.''
   Fang, an astrophysicist and China's best known dissident, and
his wife _ fellow dissident and physicist Li Shuxian _ took refuge
in the embassy after the Chinese army put down pro-democracy
demonstrations on June 3-4, 1989, killing hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of people.
   Chinese authorities accused them of encouraging the protests and
issued a warrant for their arrest, but finally allowed them to
leave on June 24 for England, where Fang will be a visiting fellow
at Cambridge University.
   Bush, speaking Friday at a news conference in London during the
NATO summit there, was asked about Fang's remarks alleging a double
standard.
   ``I don't agree with that. I notice some of my critics in the
United States Congress say that, and I think they are just as wrong
as they can be,'' Bush said.
   He said the United States had taken the lead in condemning the
abuse of human rights in the suppression of the pro-democracy
movement in China.
   Fang also spoke Friday with CBS News after his son, Fang Zhe, an
undergraduate at Beijing University, arrived in London from China.
   Now that all of his family members are out of China, Fang, who
has another son attending Wayne State University in Detroit, felt
free to speak out.
   In an interview scheduled for broadcast Sunday on NBC's ``Meet
the Press,'' he said he expects democratic change in China within
the next decade.
   China's leadership wants economic openness, but is trying at the
same time to ``resist the worldwide trend toward democracy and
freedom,'' Fang said.
   Fang said the world is ``getting smaller and mutual influences
are getting progressively stronger,'' and so the democratic reforms
under way in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union are certain to
affect China.

   The federal government's share of public
school costs dropped by one-third the last decade, the nation's
largest teachers' union said Friday.
   A report by the National Education Association showed the
federal government paid 6.3 percent of the total dollar for public
elementary and secondary schools this year, compared to 9.2 percent
in 1980.
   With the declining federal support, the report noted that state
and local governments in 1989-90 added all but about $500 million
to the $11 billion growth in school revenues over 1988-89.
   According to the report, school revenues are reaching the $200
billion mark. The 5.9 percent increase is the lowest since 1983 and
leaves virtually no room to meet the costs of school reform and
restructuring because it nearly matches projected expenditures, the
report showed.
   Also, the report said there will be about 3.5 million additional
students by the end of the decade.
   Local school districts picked up 56 percent of new school
revenues in 1989-90. The states developed almost 40 percent of new
school revenues while the federal government contributed 4 percent,
said the report.
   ``The history of the relative federal contribution to school
support is on the decline throughout the 1980s. Congressional
action to reduce the national deficit will likely exert a
continuing downward pressure on the federal government's share of
public school finances and therefore increase pressure on state and
local governments to meet the expanding financial needs of public
education,'' the survey said.
   Local revenues, mostly from property taxes, account for 50
percent or more of school revenues in 20 states.
   A breakdown by percentage includes 89.6 in New Hampshire, 70.8
in Nebraska, 66.9 in Oregon, 63.4 in South Dakota, 60.6 in
Virginia, 59.3 in Nevada, 59 in Michigan, 58.2 in Vermont, 57 in
Colorado and 56.8 in Wisconsin.
   Also, 56.4 in Missouri, 56.3 in Maryland, 54.7 in New Jersey,
54.4 in Illinois, 53.2 in Massachusetts, 51.8 in Rhode Island, 51.7
in New York, 51.6 in Connecticut, 51.5 in Kansas and 50.2 in
Arizona.

<HEAD>Mother Gets 27 Year To Life for Murder of Daughter's Alleged
Supplier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANCASTER, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mother was sentenced Friday to 27
years to life in prison for the murder of a man she claimed was
providing her daughter with drugs.
   Superior Court Judge Margaret Grignon imposed the maximum
sentence possible on Belita Fox, 41, for the Aug. 29 shooting of
Kevin Furman, 23. Ms. Fox was convicted June 7 of first-degree
murder.
   Deputy District Attorney Robert Foltz argued that Ms. Fox was
dangerous and should be imprisoned for as long as possible.
   Ms. Fox's attorney, Vincent James Oliver, said he would appeal.
   Furman's mother, Jean Furman, said even the maximum penalty
dissatisfied her.
   ``Belita Fox is where she belongs,'' she added. ``However,
nothing can satisfy me. That's the most that she can get. But she's
left a lot of hurt behind.
   ``It's not over. I'll never have my son back.''
   During the trial, Ms. Fox testified that she shot Furman because
her daughter, Cheryl Wilson, then 17, had a heart murmur that could
be aggravated by drugs.
   The night before the murder, Ms. Fox was seen drinking in bars
and told friends that she planned to kill a man who was supplying
drugs to her daughter.
   Early the next morning, she picked up a .38-caliber revolver at
her home and drove to Furman's home. She argued with a woman at the
home, then shot Furman three times.
   Ms. Fox then called her daughter from Furman's bedroom and later
dialed 911 to report the murder.

<HEAD>Argentina to Resume Interest Payments on Foreign Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government will begin monthly
payments of $40 million to creditor banks that have lent the
country 1,000 times that sum, the president of Citibank in
Argentina said Friday.
   Two-thirds of Argentina's foreign debt of $60 billion plus $6.5
billion in overdue interest is owed to commercial banks. The
largest creditors include Manufacturers Hanover, Chase Manhattan
and Citibank.
   ``Sometime before the end of the day it (payment) will take
place,'' Citibank's local president, Ricardo Handley, told the
independent Radio Mitre.
   The announcement coincided with the arrival Friday of Michel
Camdessus, director-general of the International Monetary Fund.
   The last payment was made in May. That $40 million was the first
interest payment in two years.
   The government of President Carlos Menem wants to negotiate a
debt reduction, lower interest rates and new funds with its
creditors. Central Bank President Javier Gonzalez Fraga plans to
fly to New York in late July to resume talks on those issues.
   A steering committee representing private banks has insisted
that significant payments be made on overdue interest before debt
reduction or fresh loans will be considered.
   A director of another U.S. bank, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the banks want payments of $100 million a month. He
added that the banks believed Argentina is capable of such payments.
   Central Bank director Roque Fernandez said Thursday that foreign
reserves, which were little more than $100 million when Menem was
inaugurated in July 1989 now top $2.1 billion.
   The government on Friday reported the cost of living rose by
13.9 percent in June and a total of 716 percent for the first six
months of this year.
   The monthly rate was a disappointment to the government, which
had hoped to hold the cost of living increase to a single digit for
the first time since November.
   The government has committed itself with the IMF to reduce
monthly inflation to 2 percent by December.
   Argentina has suffered triple-digit annual inflation in 15 of
the past 16 years. Last year, inflation soared to 4,924 percent.
   Also Friday, Argentina and Brazil pledged to remove all barriers
to bilateral trade by Dec. 31, 1994.
   Trade between South America's two largest countries amounted to
$2 billion in 1989, with Argentina posting a $401 million surplus.
   Trade in 1988 totaled $1.7 billion, with Brazil posting a $364
million surplus.

   Greenpeace protesters in a yacht Friday shadowed
the U.S. aircraft carrier Midway to publicize claims that the Navy
covered up the cause of an on-board fire that killed two crew
members, an activist said.
   Navy officials have said the June 20 blast occurred as a
fire-fighting crew opened a hatch to investigate smoke in an
emergency equipment room. They said the room is near pipes carrying
steam for the ship's plane-launching catapult system.
   But Faith Doherty, a spokeswoman for the Greenpeace
environmental group, claimed the U.S. military had not
satisfactorily answered citizens' questions about the cause of the
fire.
   Some Japanese was worried about the fire because of concerns the
ship might be carrying nuclear weapons. Under U.S. policy, U.S.
officials refuse to comment on what craft is carrying such arms.
   The protesters followed the 67,000-ton carrier Friday in a
35-foot yacht as the ship left its home port of Yokosuka, near
Tokyo. Senior Chief Petty Officer Gary Gunderson, a Navy spokesman,
said the carrier was leaving for routine operations in the Pacific.
   He said the cause of the explosion was still under investigation.
   Ms. Doherty said she and six other protesters from the United
States and other countries met the Midway in their yacht at the
mouth of Yokosuka bay, near Tokyo.
   She said they displayed displayed anti-nuclear signs. She said
their actions were intended to protest both the Navy's handling of
the fire and the transport of nuclear weapons into Japan.

<TEXT>
   The Louisiana House on Friday night
voted to override Gov. Buddy Roemer's veto of the nation's
strongest state abortion bill, which contains no exceptions for
rape or incest.
   The vote was 72-30, two more votes than needed for a House veto
override.
   The state Senate was expected to vote later Friday on overriding
the veto Roemer issued earlier in the day.
   If the Senate also voted to override, it would be the first time
a Louisiana governor has had a veto overridden this century.
   The measure would send doctors who perform abortions to jail for
up to 10 years and fined them up to $100,000. It was written for
the purpose of challenging the 1973 Supreme Court decision that
legalized abortion.
   Also Friday, anti-abortion activists in Michigan filed petitions
with more than 330,000 signatures to initiate a bill that would
require girls to have a parent's consent before obtaining an
abortion.
   Roemer signed the veto Friday morning, according to his staff
attorney, John Kennedy.
   In his veto message, Roemer called the issue ``one of the most
wrenching and divisive issues to be faced by this Legislature.''
   He also responded to charges by backers of the bill that he has
changed his position on abortion since he was a congressman,
running for governor, in 1987.
   ``As a member of Congress, I consistently voted to curb abortion
on demand and to protect the life of a fetus,'' Roemer wrote in the
veto message. ``I initially voted for the exception to save the
life of a mother, but over the years of struggling with this issue
I became acutely aware of the need to except those instances where
conception occurred because of rape or incest.
   ``Women cannot and should not be forced to bear the consequences
of these traumatic, illegal acts.''
   Roemer has repeatedly said he sides with anti-abortion forces
but cannot allow a bill without rape and incest exceptions to
become law.
   At an afternoon news conference, the bill's author, state Rep.
Woody Jenkins, cited statistics showing that of more than 15,000
abortions performed in Louisiana in 1987, only one was done to end
a pregnancy that resulted from rape.
   ``He's for killing 15,000 unborn children a year in Louisiana
just to make sure that one child conceived in rape is also
killed,'' said Jenkins.
   Robin Rothrock, leader of an abortion rights coalition, said
earlier she remained confident that the Senate would sustain
Roemer's veto.
   ``In the Senate we believe that we still have the 15,'' Rothrock
said, referring to 15 senators who voted against the measure when
it passed the Senate with 24 votes. An override requires a
two-thirds vote in each chamber _ 26 in the Senate and 70 in the
House.
   The House passed the bill last week with 74 votes.
   In Michigan, the Legislature will have 40 days to pass the
veto-proof measure, once the petition signatures are validated.
Failure of the measure would put the issue on the November 1992
statewide ballot as a public referendum.
   Lawmakers passed a similar measure earlier this year but
couldn't override Democratic Gov. James Blanchard's veto.
   A majority of House and Senate members signed the petitions,
said Michigan Right to Life president Barbara Listing.
   The bill would require girls 17 and younger to have a parent's
consent for an abortion or to ask a judge for a waiver on the
grounds that she is mature enough to make her own decision or the
abortion would be in her best interest.

   Police on Friday arrested a suburban Virginia
tennis instructor who became irate over being searched and ticketed
and rammed his car between concrete barriers in the Capitol
driveway.
   George C. Heflin Jr., 33, of Falls Church, Va., was charged with
malicious destruction of government property and three counts of
assault with a deadly weapon.
   Capitol police spokesman Dan Nichols said Heflin appeared to aim
the car at three officers but they were unharmed. He said the car
shoved aside two of the large, planter-style barriers, damaging
them slightly, and came to a stop 30 feet beyond, a total wreck.
   Nichols said Heflin suffered slight injuries in the incident.
   Earlier, police had intercepted Heflin after he left his car
running and ran up the Capitol steps. They searched him and found
only ``religious-type pamphlets,'' Nichols said.
   His car was ticketed because the motor was left running, Nichols
said.
   Each of the four felony charges carries a maximum of ten years
in jail and a $10,000 fine.

   A small mound of crumpled steel was
all that remained Friday of a three-story storage tank after a
fatal explosion ripped through the Arco Chemical Co. plant.
   The roof of the 900,000-gallon tank loaded with wastewater and
flammable hydrocarbons blew off in the initial explosion late
Thursday and landed 100 yards away in the parking lot of an
administration building.
   The blast shattered windows in the building and left sheets of
rumpled steel from the tank throughout the area.
   The rest of the collapsed tower was spread over a block-wide
area in the southern end of the 564-acre complex.
   Two vehicles, a vacuum truck from Waste Processors Industries
Inc. and a tractor-trailer, stood on their wheel rims at the north
end of the area, their tires melted into gooey globs of tar.
Nearby, blackened rubble remained of a portable air compressor the
size of a boxcar.
   ``I've been to a lot of fires at plants. But this was a hot
fire,'' Dennis Calhoun, an Arco employee, said during a tour of the
area Friday afternoon.
   Arco investigators were sifting through the twisted black metal
in hopes of finding the cause of the explosion that claimed the
lives of 17 workers, including the driver of the vacuum truck.
   A mesh of overhead pipes that led into the area resembled a
toppled Erector set. Six cooling towers for a nearby co-generation
plant stood idle under gray cloudy skies after the explosion ripped
off panels.
   Firefighters used foam to extinguish the blaze that could be
felt as far as 20 miles away, Calhoun said.
   A holding basin adjacent to the wastewater tank contained a
black, watery liquid spewing from the tanks and helped curb the
blaze, Calhoun said. The liquid will be tested before it can be
disposed, he said.
   A smaller tank next to the one that exploded remained standing,
but was scorched and completely blackened.

<HEAD>Three Silver Spring Monkeys Put To Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COVINGTON, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three crippled monkeys, the subject of
court fights by animal rights activists for nine years, were
humanely put to death Friday after final experiments involving
sensory perception, officials said.
   The three monkeys were among seven remaining animals seized from
a Silver Spring, Md., laboratory in 1981. They were part of a study
of stroke and spinal cord injury rehabilitation financed by the
National Institutes of Health. Researchers had cut the sensory
nerves to the animals' left arms.
   The Silver Spring monkeys have been kept at Tulane University's
Delta Regional Primate Research Center since they were seized by
the government.
   The way for the final experiments was cleared Tuesday when a
federal appeals court in Washington rejected attempts by the
Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine to save them.
   Each monkey was put under deep surgical anesthesia, said Tulane
Medical Center spokeswoman Debbie Grant. While asleep, electrodes
were inserted in their brains to monitor signals produced when
parts of the body were touched.
   It was the same as the experiment performed on another Silver
Spring monkey in January to test a theory that parts of the brain
that are no longer used for one function might take over other
functions.
   The nerve endings to the monkey's arms were severed nine years
ago in a study of stroke and spinal cord injury rehabilitation. The
researchers wanted to know whether the part of the brain that was
no longer used to sense feeling in the arms would start responding
to stimuli on other parts of the body.
   In the January experiment, the unused part of the brain was
found to respond when other parts of the body were touched. The
results of Friday's experiments were not immediately known.
   After the experiment, while the monkeys were asleep, they were
put to death by lethal injection. Ms. Grant said no pain was
involved.
   Conducting the experiments were Tim Pons of the National
Institutes of Health and Preston Garraghty of Vanderbilt University.
   The decision for euthanasia was made because of the monkey's
physical condition, Ms. Grant said. Unable to feel pain, they had
bitten and otherwise injured their arms, sometimes severely.
   The monkeys had been at the center of controversy since an
animal rights group claimed they were being mistreated in
experiments sponsored by the NIH. That led to the Silver Spring
raid and charges of animal cruelty against Dr. Edward Taub, whose
conviction was overturned on appeal.

<TEXT>
   Wildfires charred about 400 square
miles of Alaska forests and tundra by Friday, and still threatened
the town of Tok, where firefighters kept up a house-to-house battle
against wind-driven flames.
   ``We're afraid the fire will blow back down in a different
direction,'' said Rob McWhorter of the Bureau of Land Management in
Tok, a crossroads town on the Alaska Highway 80 miles from the
Canadian border.
   The gusty winds that fanned flames around Tok in recent days
eased and the fire's growth slowed, but officials told residents to
remain prepared to evacuate.
   The fire, which grew to more than 53 square miles, leaped trees
and fire lines Thursday to come within a quarter-mile of some homes
before sweeping northwest of town. When the flames got that close,
some 300 of the town's 1,200 residents evacuated; most returned to
their houses Friday, McWhorter said.
   Firefighters widened fire lines Friday but the blaze remained
close.
   ``In some cases there are some spot fires on the edge of town
left over from yesterday,'' McWhorter said.
   ``It's not under control but the fire quieted down overnight,''
said Sue Mitchell, a spokeswoman for an interagency fire center in
Fairbanks. ``The fire created its own lightning storm which dropped
a little rain on the area. It wasn't much, but it helped a little
bit.''
   A report Thursday that Tok's Coast Guard navigational station
burned was incorrect. It only lost power. The station was back on
line early Friday after the seven crewman stationed there returned
to the unit.
   ``Our priority for today is to continue to defend the community,
to rebuild and expand lines on the flanks of the town,'' McWhorter
said.
   Statewide, an estimated 1,200 firefighters were deployed as 37
new fires Friday brought to 184 the number burning out of control
across Alaska's interior, said Pat Flowers, an interagency
spokesman.
   The blazes consumed at least 253,500 acres, or 396 square miles,
Flowers said.
   Gov. Steve Cowper declared a statewide emergency, and called on
the Alaska National Guard to help fight the fires.
   Most of the fires were blamed on near-record heat, low humidity
and lightning strikes.
   Hot, dry conditions were forecast to continue across Alaska's
midsection, stirring up afternoon thunderstorms with unpredictable
wind.
   ``The winds are highly variable, swinging like 90 degrees on the
compass within a 60-second period,'' McWhorter said. ``That's one
of the most dangerous combinations for firefighters you can
possibly dream up.''
   The fire burned mainly black spruce, birch, aspen and brush on
the flat terrain around Tok, where some residents wore masks to
filter out smoke.
   ``What's bothering us the most is breathing. There's burnt
spruce needles falling out of the air,'' said one resident, Mellie
Terwilliger. ``You can see but you go around with your lights on.''
   Authorities closed two main roads Thursday, but traffic resumed
early Friday. Tok is about 260 miles northeast of Anchorage at the
junction of the Glenn and Alaska highways.
   The Cassiar Creek fire, 52 miles north of Fairbanks, charred
about 2,000 acres by early Friday and threatened several
structures. None were threatened by another fire, covering about 47
square miles near Beaver, 110 miles north of Fairbanks, or by the
780-acre Pedro Dome fire, also north of Fairbanks.

<TEXT>
   A domestic airliner with 10 people
aboard was hijacked and flown to neighboring Colombia, where some
passengers and a co-pilot were let off before the plane took off
again, an official said Friday.
   The destination was not known.
   The small Twin Otter aircraft belonging to Panama's domestic
Aeroperlas airline was hijacked Thursday by five of the eight
passengers aboard, said Capt. John Bennett, director of civil
aviation.
   The hijackers _ three men and two women _ then ordered the crew
of two to fly to a clandestine airstrip in Viterbo, a small town in
Colombia near Medellin, a center for Colombian cocaine trafficking
and headquarters of the Medellin drug cartel.
   The Viterbo strip is used by drug traffickers, which has led
Colombian police to believe the hijackers may have belonged to one
of the drug cartels, Colombia's national radio network Caracol
reported.
   Police speculated that the hijackers may have taken the plane to
use it to transport drug shipments.
   At Viterbo, the hijackers let out three passengers and the
co-pilot and took off with the aircraft's pilot, Warren Lam, for an
unknown destination, Bennett told a news conference.
   The hijackers first boarded the plane Thursday at Colon, at the
northern end of the Panama Canal, using false identities, Bennet
said. Flight 147 had been bound for Panama City, about 50 miles
away.
   He said air controllers lost contact with the aircraft a few
minutes after it took off. It was earlier thought that the plane
may have crashed, and government planes and helicopters searched
for the aircraft Thursday and Friday.
   Bennett said co-pilot Sergio Ortiz, 26, called authorities in
Panama City Thursday afternoon and said the three passengers were
safe and in good condition at a Colombian military barracks in the
small town of Pereira.
   He said they will be taken to Bogota on Saturday.

   Police evacuated two banks, four dozen
businesses and a day-care center Friday in what turned out to be an
extortion hoax.
   ``The bundles that looked like dynamite ... are railroad
flares,'' said Fire Department spokesman Pat Bradford.
   Officials had said all day that they did not know any motive for
bomb threats against City Bank &amp; Trust and Commercial National Bank.
   But Fire Chief Gordon Routley said Friday evening that the man
who called City Bank that morning said he would blow it up if he
didn't get money.
   A city bomb squad member, peering through binoculars from a
perch 50 feet up on a hook-and-ladder truck, had said Friday
morning that bundles of tubes at the bank's entrances appeared to
be dynamite.
   Officials, including the FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms, decided to call in explosives specialists
from the Army's Fort Polk. When one of its members got a closer
look Friday evening, he said it was a hoax.
   Seven bundles and several bottles full of an unidentified liquid
were found outside City Bank &amp; Trust's main office, and two more
bundles were found at a Commercial National Bank branch, said

   He said a Fort Polk demolition expert and one from the Fire
Department's bomb squad had to deal with them because a bomb
demolition robot failed to work.
   Suited up in about 65 pounds of bulletproof head-to-toe armor _
the soldier's olive drab and the fireman's black _ in case the
bombs were real after all, they went in and took Polaroid
photographs of the bundles.
   After a close look at the photographs, they put a rope and net
around the devices, sheltered behind a car across the street and
pulled out the bundles, which were kept for evidence.

   Striking Sandinista workers clashed
with pro-government demonstrators Friday, injuring at least four
people. Tens of thousands of people maintained a 5-day-old walkout.
   About 2,000 workers supporting President Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro staged a two-mile march to protest the strikes by leftist
Sandinista union members. The work stoppages to protest government
austerity measures have paralyzed many government services and
industries since Monday.
   The two sides hurled rocks at each other in the clashes Friday
evening, injuring a news photographer. The marchers roughed up two
journalists from the Sandinista newspaper Barricada.
   Journalists at the scene saw one clash outside a group of
state-owned industrial companies and a second one near the
presidential residence.
   ``We don't want strikes!'' chanted the marchers from the
Permanent Labor Congress, which supports Mrs. Chamorro's 14-party
governing coalition.
   ``Out with corrupt government employees!'' they yelled,
referring to Sandinista holdovers in Mrs. Chamorro's administration.
   Her U.S-backed government succeeded the leftist Sandinistas
April 25 after it won a popular election.
   Alejandro Solorzano, a Congress leader heading the march, said
the demonstrators also demanded the removal of military chief
Humberto Ortega, the brother of former President Daniel Ortega.
   The strike by the Sandinista National Labor Front has paralyzed
dozens of state-owned and private businesses and factories, banks,
farm and ranch cooperatives, government offices, and international
telephone service.
   Lucio Jimenez, the Front's secretary-general, claims 90,000
workers have walked off their jobs and says the strikes will spread
until the entire country is brought to a halt.
   Strike leaders are protesting a belt-tightening economic plan by
Mrs. Chamorro's administration. She is trying to pare the
government's top-heavy bureaucracy by reducing the number of jobs
and selling state companies expropriated by the Sandinistas during
their decade in power.
   The strikers are also demanding that union leaders have a say in
economic planning and a national minimum wage of $200 monthly. The
current minimum is about $50.

   More than two dozen police officers rousted
some 100 transients out of their illegal encampment across from
City Hall before dawn Friday, the deadline for Mayor Art Agnos'
eviction order.
   A few hours after the raid at Civic Center Plaza, where five
people were arrested, mothers wheeled their babies on the paths,
old men sat on benches, reading newspapers and chatting and kids
fed the pigeons there.
   The plaza's occupation by the homeless for more than two years
seemed like it had never taken place.
   ``I think this is very nice,'' said a broadly smiling Jack
Richards, who moved to San Francisco from Ohio 20 years ago. ``This
is the way it used to be _ without the conflict, the yelling, the
screaming.''
   Some of the homeless had lived under the trees in the plaza, one
of San Francisco's showplace sites.
   The liberal mayor, who had been under heavy pressure to restore
the plaza to general public use, promised months ago to find
housing for the homeless, whether they liked it or not. One man was
carried away in his sleeping bag.
   Keith McHenry of the Food Not Bombs group was arrested and
booked on a charge of interfering with police. Other charges
included misdemeanor counts of illegal lodging and illegal
distribution of food, police said.
   Some of the hard-core homeless who refused to leave the plaza
and ignored the Friday deadline called their home under the trees
``Camp Agnos.''
   Five homeless people went to court Friday, asking a judge to
order a stop to the arrests. The five claimed that the city law
against camping in parks violates due-process rights and that the
arrests are cruel and unusual punishment because homeless people
have nowhere else to go.
   Superior Court Judge John Dearman refused without comment their
request for a temporary restraining order, but set a July 23
hearing ordering the city to explain why a preliminary injunction
should not be issued.
   The plaza is bounded on the west by City Hall, the north by the
earthquake-ruined State Office Building, the south by the Civic
Auditorium, and the east by the Main Public Library.
   As far as 25-year-old Dale Forbis was concerned, life in the
middle of San Francisco's seat of government was good enough for
him and his wife, Patricia. They moved to San Francisco from
Chicago four years ago.
   ``Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,'' Forbis said.
``That's what this country was all about. So why can't I pursue my
happiness the way I choose, as long as I'm not bothering anyone?''
   He said he has refused to take advantage of two city
multiservice centers opened this week. They like living in the
streets.
   Living a hard life often on the edge of violence, many of the
homeless said they had formed strong friendships.
   ``We have a small town here,'' said Oscar Amezquita, 33, who
said he fled Guatemala two years ago for political reasons. He said
he can't find work.
   ``We trust each other, feed one another, take care of each
other,'' he said. ``We don't want to live in a shelter with people
we don't know.''

   The government on Friday ordered Hawaii-based
Discovery Airways closed down in one week, accusing the 3-month-old
carrier of violating U.S. laws on foreign ownership.
   The Transportation Department ordered the airline to cancel its
flights and inform passengers how to obtain refunds or alternate
transportation.
   The department said it agreed with an administrative law judge
that Discovery's officers ``have consistently provided false
information and have violated the terms of their temporary
operating authority and federal law.''
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner announced revocation of
Discovery's temporary operating authority nearly seven months
before it's scheduled expiration.
   Skinner said the carrier, which operates six planes, failed to
show ``any credible inclination'' to correct problems with its
ownership and control.
   Federal law allows U.S. airlines to have no more than 25 percent
foreign ownership and requires that they be controlled by U.S.
citizens.
   Discovery is 75 percent owned by Philip Ho, president of the
Japanese Nansay Corp.'s Hawaii operations. Other airlines in the
area claim that Nansay bankrolled Ho's stake in Discovery.
   Discovery has operated for three months on several inter-island
routes in competition with both Hawaiian and Aloha airlines. Those
carriers claim that Discovery is financed by Japanese interests and
run largely by an Italian citizen.
   In Hawaii, Discovery President Don Straight said, ``We do not
agree with their evaluation.'' The decision by the DOT appears to
run directly contrary to airline deregulation, he said.
   ``Our primary concern is for our customers, employees and
shareholders,'' Straight said. ``Our objective today will be to see
if this airline can continue to fly. If that is not possible, we
will meet our obligations to our passengers, employees and
vendors.''
   ``Finally, it is our feeling that the real losers in this
decision are the inter-island travelers in the state of Hawaii,''
Straight added. ``Airlines are public utilities which provide a
service to the people. This decision by the DOT denies the public
an opportunity to choose and is a disservice to us all.'
   The administrative law judge, Ronnie A. Yoder, declared last
month that cancellation of Discovery's permit to operate ``would
appear to be a more appropriate action'' than granting the airline
a requested extension.
   Lawyers assigned by the department's Public Counsel section had
proposed an arrangement with Discovery that would have allowed it
to operate, but Yoder recommended against the settlement. The judge
said the carrier had admitted to ``substantial prior
misrepresentations'' when it applied for a permit.
   The judge said the fact that the proposed settlement included
sale of a share in the airline to qualify it as a U.S. carrier was
an admission that it had ``operated from its inception as a
non-U.S. citizen air carrier in violation of the Federal Aviation
Act and that its submissions to the department ... were false and
constituted misrepresentation in violation of federal law.''
   The department gave Discovery until next Friday to end its
service. That deadline was set in order to avoid inconvenience to
travelers, spokesman Ed O'Hara said.
   If the airline wants to continue to seek a permanent license, it
may proceed with an evidentiary hearing before the law judge, the
spokesman said.
   Skinner said Discovery was given a temporary authority because
of the department's policy of promoting new entry and competition
in the airline business.
   But he said the airline failed to establish a voting trust that
would have insulated it from possible foreign control.
   The administrative law judge also cited evidence that Franco
Mancassola, an Italian citizen, is effectively Discovery's
executive vice president, earning twice as much as its president.
   Hawaiian Airlines has filed a $9.9 million suit against the new
airline, claiming lost revenue because of Discovery's allegedly
fraudulent actions.

   A fire at an atomic energy research center
early Saturday caused damage but no injuries, officials said.
   The fire broke out in the biology laboratory of the Democritus
Hellenic Atomic Energy Committee in the northern Athens suburb of
Holargos, a security official at the building said by telephone.
   He said the cause of the fire were not known and that an
investigation would be held when power was restored to the stricken
building. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said that the first two floors of a three-floor building had
been extensively damaged. The building is part of a large walled-in
compound that also houses a small nuclear reactor.
   Frightened residents telephoned the police when they saw the
fire at the state institute, a spokesman at police headquarters
said.
   He said Democritus officials had assured authorities that there
was no danger of the fire reaching the nuclear reactor housed in
another building.
   The fire was extinguished in two hours, said the officer on
condition of anonymity.

   Some women are looking over their shoulders
while walking through midtown Manhattan because of a mysterious
attacker known as the Dartman. On Friday, he hit his 52nd victim,
police said.
   Over the last 10 days the Dartman, so dubbed by the city's
tabloid newspapers, has repeatedly blown homemade darts at the
backs and buttocks of well-dressed women.
   Not all of the darts have met their mark, some becoming
entangled in clothing. No one has been seriously hurt.
   On Friday, police Commissioner Lee Brown appealed for help from
the public. Since the attacker always has struck during daylight in
the most crowded part of town, ``somebody must have seen him do
it,'' Brown said.
   ``At this time, it's a nuisance,'' he said, adding ``It doesn't
make sense. We want to put a stop to it.''
   ``There's enough to worry about walking through the city without
this,'' said Liz Echauss, 22, who was dressed in a crisp blue linen
suit for a job interview.
   Another woman in a blue business suit was struck at 2:19 p.m.
Friday in the latest attack. A passerby saw the attack and warned
the woman, who pulled the homemade dart out of her clothing and
kept walking, according to police.
   The witness called a police hotline and reported the attack. He
said the man who appeared to have fired the dart fled on foot.
   Late Friday, police were trying to determine if a similar attack
in the borough of Queens was related to the Manhattan attacks.
   A woman in her 40s was walking in the Jackson Heights section
around 6 p.m. when she was struck in her right arm with a 3-inch
dart, said Sgt. Nick Vreeland. She was not seriously hurt.
   Earlier, Brown asked people who work in the midtown area to call
police if they spotted a man resembling the one drawn in a police
sketch.
   Police officials have urged women to remain calm despite the
media attention given the attacks, which began June 26th.
   For more than a week the Dartman, who witnesses say is black,
had fired only on white and Hispanic women. But Thursday afternoon
a 45-year-old black woman was struck by a dart while walking to her
office.
   The Dartman has struck throughout midtown, leaving his mark on
six women along Fifth Avenue and more than a dozen along bustling
Seventh Avenue between Pennsylvania Station and Times Square.
   The victims were struck in the buttocks or lower back with the
2-inch homemade darts, which were fashioned out of straight pins
and sewing needles with paper guides and apparently blown through
straws. No foreign substances have been found on any of the darts.
All of the attacks have occurred between 11 a.m. and 7 p.m.
   Illy Brown, a middle-aged software developer, looked worried
when the Dartman was mentioned. ``My daughter works in the
neighborhood, my niece works in the neighborhood,'' she said. ``I
find myself looking suspiciously at anyone on the street who fits
the description.''
   Debby Wehman, 23, seemed scared and nervous. ``He's a sick man,
but unfortunately, you still have to walk the streets,'' she said.
``I'm trying not to think about it. If you walk around thinking
about it, you'll make yourself crazy.''

<TEXT>
   The manager of the Hanford nuclear
reservation resigned Friday to move to the private sector, saying
he'd peaked in government work and that a better job didn't exist
within the U.S. Department of Energy.
   Mike Lawrence said he had accepted a better-paying job with
Chem-Nuclear Environmental Systems of Denver, a branch of giant
Waste Management Inc.
   No successor was immediately named to head Hanford, which has
14,000 employees and a $1 billion annual budget, and which for four
decades has made plutonium for nuclear weapons.
   Lawrence, long a controversial figure in the department because
of his openness with the public, said he was not forced out of the
position he has held since 1984.
   ``Now is the time to leave government service,'' said Lawrence,
42. ``I have peaked in that. I have no place to go in government.''
   Chem-Nuclear is a federal contractor for nuclear waste cleanup
and environmental restoration. Lawrence said he would be director
of waste management.
   ``I will continue in an area I enjoy ... with people I have
respect for,'' Lawrence said.
   His resignation is effective July 28 and he will move with his
family to the Denver area in August, Lawrence told a news
conference.
   Catherine Kaliniak, an Energy Department spokeswoman in
Washington, D.C., said the agency would have no comment on
Lawrence's resignation.
   Lawrence earned $83,600 per year as one of DOE's nine field
managers. He declined to disclose his salary with the new company,
but said it was a substantial raise.
   Government regulations will prevent him from working with
Hanford projects for up to one year, and in some cases for much
longer, Lawrence said.
   Lawrence insisted that his relations with the Energy Department
hierarchy remained good and that he had not been asked to find a
new job.
   U.S. Rep. Sid Morrison, R-Wash., who represents the Hanford
area, said Lawrence had been on the ``cutting edge'' of DOE's new
policy of openness and that had caused problems.
   ``We'd known for some time that Mike was uncertain of his status
with DOE and that private enterprise was offering much more than
the federal government could pay,'' Morrison said.
   Lawrence had consistently earned high marks from government
regulators and anti-nuclear activists.
   He recently touched off protests by disclosing that some of
Hanford's nuclear waste storage tanks could explode, although he
stressed the risk was low.
   Lawrence said Friday that he was proud of last year's Tri-Party
Agreement, a pact between DOE, the Environmental Protection Agency
and the state of Washington that set up a 30-year timetable for
cleaning up Hanford, the nation's most contaminated nuclear
production site.
   He said he was also proud of consolidating the Hanford site from
eight contractors to four in the mid-1980s, and for stressing
safety over production.

   An 18-wheeler spilled 30,000 pounds of
frozen hamburgers onto sizzling Interstate 35 Friday.
   Some of the beef, which was bound for McDonald's fast-food
restaurants, was loaded onto another truck by workers who slid on
the slippery road as they tossed 30-pound boxes to each other.
   A front-end loader scraped the leftovers off the roadway.
   The 15 tons of beef, some of which was barely braised, is headed
for the dump, said officials with McDonald's and Ranger
Refrigerated Express Inc. of Dallas, the trucking firm that was
hauling the meat.
   The tractor-trailer was involved in a three-vehicle accident
shortly after noon.
   Kevin Dougherty, the 31-year-old driver of the truck that dumped
a portion of its 300,000 patties onto the freeway, suffered minor
injuries in the collision, police said. He was taken to Harris
Methodist-Fort Worth, where he was treated and released, a hospital
spokeswoman said.
   The accident stopped traffic for a mile for about an hour, and
slowed it for several hours afterwards.
   Dougherty tried to avoid a cement truck that had been hit by a
station wagon. His tractor-trailer slid under a bridge, which
sheered the top of the trailer, said city police officer J.D. Ross.

   The move, which takes effect Monday, was in response to a
recommendation by the National Commission on Human Rights and
Mexican citizens living in the United States who often cross the
border, the newspaper said.
   Salinas also ordered all police to begin carrying photo
identification and to stop using confiscated cars. He spoke in

   The attorney general, Enrique Alvarez del Castillo, said he had
already eliminated 103 roadblocks but did not say how many had
existed. He said 63 remain in northern Mexico.

   A sniper fired into a crowd near a bar Friday,
killing a teen-ager and wounding three other people, police said.
   ``It was like an ambush,'' said police Lt. William Mullen.
``Apparently, the shots were fired randomly from a distance. The
victims didn't really know where the shots were coming from.''
   Police made no arrests.
   Killed was Shon Staton, 17, of McKeesport. The three others who
were struck by gunfire weren't seriously hurt, police said.
   The sniper fired several rifle shots from woods into the crowd
outside the bar around 2:30 a.m., Mullen said.
   Members of the crowd told police they heard three to seven shots.
   Staton died about 40 minutes later at Forbes Metropolitan Health
Center, the Allegheny County Coroner's Office said.
   Police said the shooting came 15 minutes after a man attacked a
woman about a half block from the bar, then returned with a rifle
and threatened to kill her. The man then left without incident,
police said.

   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, a steadfast foe of
legalized abortion, said Friday he has softened his stand for the
tactical reason of finally getting an updated abortion law passed
in New Hampshire.
   The conservative Republican, who is running for a state Senate
seat even though he retires in January from the U.S. Senate after
two terms, said he has long supported abortion only to save the
woman's life, but now would support exceptions for rape and incest
victims.
   In a telephone interview from his Chichester home, Humphrey said
he's easing his stance ``because that's probably the only way that
we can get a bill passed and signed into law that would address the
95 percent of abortions that have nothing to do with rape, incest
or the life of the mother.''
   Earlier this year, Gov. Judd Gregg vetoed a bill that would have
made abortion legal until the fetus could live outside the womb.
Last year, Gregg vetoed a bill to repeal the state's existing
anti-abortion laws, which date from the mid-1800s.
   Humphrey faces state Rep. Jack Sherburne in the Sept. 11
Republican primary. Sherburne favors abortion rights, as does the
incumbent, Republican William Johnson, who is running for Congress.
   Humphrey said his beliefs haven't changed and that he hopes the
public eventually will agree with him that ``each abortion kills a
human being, and a human being is a human being irrespective of his
circumstances of conception.''
   Asked if he would revert to opposing exceptions for rape and
incest if the political climate were favorable, Humphrey said,
``That would be my preference. But I don't expect to see that day.''
   He said he had not discussed his new position with anti-abortion
supporters, but expects some criticism.
   Warren Aldrich, legislative director for New Hampshire For
L.I.F.E., would not comment directly on Humphrey's change, but said
his group ``would not take part in sponsoring or originating a bill
that permits the taking of an unborn human life because of the
circumstances of its conception.''
   ``Rape and incest are tragic assaults on a woman's life, but we
do not believe that abortion is in any way therapeutic for the
woman,'' he said.
   Peg Dobbie, state director of the National Abortion Rights
Action League, was surprised by Humphrey's new stance. ``He seems
like the guy who's above it, the maverick who stands up for his
convictions no matter what,'' she said.
   Even with the modifications, Humphrey's stance ``is a very
extreme anti-abortion position,'' Dobbie said.

   KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii (AP) _ U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy dived into
shark-filled waters to help rescue a couple whose boat overturned
in a tussle with a 485-pound marlin, according to Kennedy and the
skipper of his charter boat.
   The Massachusetts Democrat, on vacation with his twin 9-year-old
sons Joseph Jr. and Matthew, was taking part in a fishing
tournament Sunday along with U.S Rep. Bart Gordon, D-Tenn.,
football player Colin Scott, and ex-Washington Redskin player John
Wilbur.
   The crew of Kennedy's boat heard a distress call on the craft's
radio Sunday when the charter was about three miles off
Kailua-Kona, on the west side of Hawaii island, said Chuck Harlan,
captain of the charter boat Kealia.
   ``The woman said their boat was sinking and she gave four
different locations,'' Harland said in a telephone interview
Wednesday. ``We saw lights out in the water and continued trolling
in that direction.''
   When they got close, they could see a man and a woman hanging
onto an overturned fishing boat, Harlan said.
   Kennedy and others on the charter leapt in the water to save the
couple, Harlan and Kennedy said. ``Joe, Colin and my son Mike
jumped in and swam over to the boat,'' Harlan said.
   ``I don't know if we got many points for intelligence,'' Kennedy
told the Boston Herald, in a telephone interview Thursday. ``It was
tiger shark city.''
   ``She was really scared at that point,'' Kennedy said. ``Colin
and I grabbed her and swam back to the boat.''
   The Herald reported the rescued woman was Mildred Akaka, the
niece of U.S. Sen. Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii. Akaka told The
Associated Press earlier in the week that he hadn't heard about the
incident.
   After the rescue, Harlan said, he saw a large marlin jump off to
the north. Diving under the capsized boat, he grabbed the vessel's
fishing pole, still hooked to the marlin, which apparently had sunk
the couples' boat in the first place.
   The rescued woman worked the fish a while, then turned the pole
over to Wilbur, who eventually landed the 485-pound marlin, Harlan
said.
   Kennedy said a bleeding 300-pound marlin the couple had caught
earlier in the day probably attracted the sharks.
   When he spotted the dead fish under the boat, ``it kind of
nearly gave me heart failure,'' Kennedy said.
   Kennedy, 37, said of the incident, ``It was classic `Old Man and
the Sea' stuff.''
   Kennedy is the eldest son of the late Sen. Robert Kennedy. Since
1987 he has represented the same district that his uncle, John
Kennedy, served before becoming senator and later president.
   John Kennedy gained fame during World War II for his role in
command of patrol-torpedo boat PT-109 in the Solomon Islands. After
the boat was rammed by a Japanese warship, Kennedy towed a badly
wounded soldier to safety. American forces later rescued the crew.

   Communist North Korea today announced
it will open a short stretch of its border with South Korea next
month to promote reunification, a South Korean news agency said.
   Officials in the capitalist south denounced the action as
propaganda.
   If the opening takes place, it would be the first time either of
the two Korean states had opened any portion of its border since
the Korean War ended in 1953.
   Word of the north's move came from Naewoe Press, a semi-official
news agency specializing in Communist affairs. It said North
Korea's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland
made the surprise announcement in a broadcast monitored in Seoul
today.

   Hundreds of Albanians are jamming foreign
embassies in the capital of Tirana even after their authoritarian
Communist government pledged to issue them travel papers, diplomats
said.
   The Albanian Foreign Ministry on Thursday promised to grant
passports to the hundreds of Albanians who have sought refuge in
foreign embassies in a desperate attempt to flee their homeland,
the last hard-line Communist country in Europe.
   ``The Albanian authorities ... are ready to grant passports,
even to those citizens who are still in the foreign embassies and
who shall ask for such a thing,'' said a Foreign Ministry statement
carried by the official Albanian news agency ATA.
   But hundreds more would-be refugees gathered outside embassies
in the Albanian capital, Tirana. Police guards did not interfere as
several hundred more Albanians gained entry into embassy compounds,
said Turkish Ambassador Teoman Surenkok.

   More than 150 wildfires raced across
Alaska's interior, forcing the evacuation of a town of 900 people
and blocking the Alaska Highway, the main road into the state.
   Gov. Steve Cowper declared a statewide state of emergency, and
called on the Alaska National Guard to help fight the 159 fires
that raged over 172,500 acres of forest and open tundra. An elite
firefighting team from California was being flown into the region
later today.
   No one was reported injured by Thursday night, officials said.
   The biggest fire covered about 30,000 acres near Beaver, about
110 miles north of Fairbanks, but no structures were threatened
there.

   Repair work on the Exxon Valdez is nearing
completion and the tanker that caused the nation's worst oil spill
is expected to return to service later this summer.
   President Gus Elmer of Exxon Shipping Co. is expected to
announce today where the tanker will sail and whether it will bear
the Valdez name, said Exxon spokeswoman Janet Cool.
   Cool said the ship would return to service this summer, but that
it was unlikely to sail before August.
   The tanker has been undergoing work since August to repair
damage it sustained on March 24, 1989, when it ran aground on a
reef in Alaska's Prince William Sound. The ship spilled almost 11
million gallons of oil into the sound, sullying hundreds of miles
of coastline and killing scores of wildlife.

   The nation's largest teachers union
abandoned its resistance to allowing engineers, scientists and
other midcareer professionals into the classroom while they study
to become teachers.
   The 2 million-member National Education Association had opposed
so-called alternative certification programs because it said
recruiting non-teachers to combat faculty shortages undercut
traditional licensing programs.
   The policy adopted Thursday during the first day of the union's
four-day convention won passage because it established standards
like mandatory bachelor's degrees, supervision by certified
teachers and enrollment in teacher accreditation courses, officials
said.
   ``I'm not in favor of blanket alternative certification,'' said
Rosanne Bacon, president of the Massachusetts Teachers Association,
a former opponent of such teacher recruitment efforts.

<HEAD>It's `Sweet Revenge' to Blame it on the French</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whom shall we blame for the staggeringly inept,
really stupid comedy ``Sweet Revenge'' airing tonight on cable's
TNT network?
   Let's blame the French.
   They produced ``Sweet Revenge'' and set it in Paris because
that's where they live, not because it's key to the story.
   Most everybody in the movie _ production crew and supporting
cast included _is French. This is not a French movie, however. It's
an American movie about Americans. It uses French actors who think
they can do American accents: ``Ehnd ouwhaat mekks yooo t'ink so?''
   Yes, blame the French. They think Jerry Lewis is a comic genius.
By all means, blame the French.
   You also can blame Carrie Fisher. She plays a bright, ambitious
corporate lawyer in an American law firm's Paris office (huh?), who
divorces her unpublished American writer husband. He's played by
John Sessions, pretending he's not British, which he is.
   The cheap plot device introduced by first-time screenwriter
Janet Brownwell is that Fisher has agreed to support him after he
put her through law school.
   For some reason, they divorce in New York, instead of Paris, and
the court orders her to pay him alimony until he remarries. Ah, you
say, that sounds stupid. Well, she's also sleeping with a senior
partner.
   But there's more! She conceives the fiendishly lame idea of
hiring an actress, coached in the attributes of her ex-husband's
feminine ideal, to seduce him into marriage.
   Brilliant, eh? But isn't this about what you'd expect of a
lawyer who represents herself in her own divorce?
   Maybe you'd like to blame Rosanna Arquette.
   She plays _ and this is a real stretch for her _ a neurotic
flibbertigibbet of an actress. She takes the job as feminine ideal,
dates the ex-husband and finds herself ... WHOOPS! ... falling in
love!
   When a scintilla of sexual tension arises, Arquette confesses
all. He kicks her out, but she returns to plead her love for him
and they reunite. Despite the presumed lesson she learned, she
agrees to his doltish revenge scheme.
   OK, blame both Arquette AND Fisher.
   They could not have read this script and said, ``This is a
well-written, romantic comedy that challenges me as an actress.''
They must have read it and said, `Hey, this thing shoots for a
month in Paris!''
   Blame Brownwell, whose screenplay turned an idle fancy into
something really inane.
   ``My husband and I were sitting around one morning at breakfast,
discussing what we would do to one another if we got divorced,''
she told the movie's publicists. ``I said I would hire this
incredibly beautiful woman to whom I would teach all his secrets.
He would fall in love with her and she would break his heart.''
   This is not the greatest idea ever to leave the breakfast table.
   Blame the director, Charlotte Brandstrom, who went to school at
UCLA and the American Film Institute director's program. This is
her second movie, and her work shows how some film school graduates
are versed in technique and utterly ignorant of real life.
   She shot most of her outdoor scenes in the same exclusive
Parisian shopping streets where she shot most of her interiors: in
the exclusive Hermes and Ungaro stores.
   She and Brownwell said the major element of the story is Fisher
and Arquette's relationship and what they learn from each other.
Well, maybe in some other movie.
   ``Sweet Revenge'' is so fatuously conceived that it constantly
calls attention to its lack of dramatic tension.
   The climactic scene, in which several loosely flapping plot ends
must be tied up, occurs at a Paris news conference called by the
faithless senior partner who's presumably been living and working
in Europe for a couple of years while sleeping with Fisher.
   The news conference is to announce the senior partner's
candidacy for the U.S. Senate. That's right, he's announcing his
candidacy in Paris.
   He's no doubt hoping to represent a state with a large French
population, like the great state of Grey Poupon.

   STUPID PET TRICKS REDUX: Can you see the potential of an entire

shouldn't work at CBS. Tonight, the network premieres ``Prime Time
Pets,'' a summer replacement look at some of the nicest critters
with fur, feathers and scales, hosted by Wil Shriner.
   The home video-style clips are mercifully brief. Some actually
are funny. And there's a nice segment on a trained dog who helps a
disabled child.
   None of the show is particularly memorable, and CBS' reluctance
to pick it up in light of ABC's hugely successful ``America's
Funniest Home Videos'' could be showing us the tail-end of the home
video boom.

<HEAD>Nationalists Combine Street Protests With Guerrilla War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DILI, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 15 years of guerrilla war, East
Timor nationalists have added street protests to their campaign for
independence in the former Portuguese colony seized by Indonesia.
   In the mountains, rebels snipe at government soldiers in one of
the world's least-known insurgencies, dating from the Indonesian
invasion in 1975.
   Many Timorese apparently have accepted being part of Indonesia,
but militants in the mainly Roman Catholic territory fiercely
oppose rule by the predominantly Moslem country.
   Young independence activists delivered their first public
message Oct. 12 during a visit by Pope John Paul II.
   They surged toward the altar at the end of an outdoor Mass
attended by more than 100,000 people, shouting slogans and
unfurling banners. Several were beaten and 18 detained.
   Independence demonstrators appeared again when John C. Monjo,
the U.S. ambassador to Indonesia, visited East Timor in January.
Witnesses said several youths were injured by soldiers outside the
Hotel Turismo.
   At least one other public protest has has been reported since.
   Both government officials and rebel spokesmen confirm the
nationalist tactics are changing.
   Mario V. Carrascalao, the provincial governor, said more
demonstrations could be expected.
   He said no more than 40 activists were involved during the
pope's visit. About 200 turned out when Monjo was in Dili and ``we
let them walk around for three days,'' Carrascalao siad in an
interview.
   A human rights organization said at least 25,000 Indonesian
soldiers had moved into East Timor for ``cleanup'' operations
against guerrillas ahead of a visit by Portuguese officials in
September.
   Since February, troop strength has been brought to 40,000 from
about 15,000, said Carmel Budiarjo, director of Campaign TAPOL, a
group based in London that focuses on Indonesia.
   Carrascalao, the provincial governor, said he anticipated
demonstrations during the Portuguese visit.
   Abilio Araujo, leader of the Fretilin resistance movement, told
reporters in Lisbon in February: ``This year, we plan to step up
organized mass resistance in occupied territories. ... We can't
defeat Indonesia militarily, but they will never eradicate us,
either.''
   Fretilin is a Portuguese acronym for the leftist Revolutionary
Front for an Independent East Timor. A bid for power by the
Fretilin movement after Portuguese officials fled a coup attempt in
August 1975 gave Indonesia the excuse to invade from West Timor,
its half of the island.
   Indonesia annexed East Timor as its 27th province in 1976, but
the United Nations still recognizes Portugal as the administering
power. The Portuguese closed their embassy in Jakarta after the
invasion and Dutch diplomats look after Portuguese interests in
Indonesia.
   The United States recognized Indonesia's incorporation of East
Timor without acknowledging it was ``a valid act of
self-determination,'' a U.S. Embassy official said.
   East Timor, one of the world's least-developed areas, is on the
eastern end of the Indonesian archipelago, 1,300 miles from Jakarta
and only 350 from Australia's northwest coast.
   It is blessed by balmy breezes and beautiful beaches, but is no
idyllic tropical isle.
   Inhospitable brown mountains are cut by parched valleys. Sparse
vegetation and scars left by slash-and-burn farming make the
highlands seem desolate. The earth is cracked in the dry season and
flooded when rains come.
   Per capita annual income was the equivalent of $40 in 1974 and
now is $200. East Timor has no industry, only a tiny service sector
and bleak prospects for those seeking work.
   Little information about the insurgency has been available
because Indonesia virtually sealed off East Timor after annexing
it. East Timorese were not allowed out and only a few foreigners
got in, with official permission.
   Farming stopped and starvation spread.
   East Timor faced disaster for a time. It was averted by
emergency food supplies, starting in 1979, from the International
Committee of the Red Cross and Catholic Relief Services of the
United States.
   Critics claim thousands of lives could have been saved if
Indonesia and permitted relief operations earlier.
   How many people died is not known.
   In 1985, the human rights group Amnesty International said
200,000 people may have died from all causes. Roman Catholic
clergymen estimate the total at more than 100,000 and diplomats in
Jakarta say 60,000. There are no official figures.
   East Timor's population was given as 552,954 in the 1980 census,
compared to the last colonial Portuguese estimate of 635,000.
Carrascalao said the population now was 695,000.
   ``We are still in a period of transition,'' said the provincial
governor, a native of Timor who was an official of the colonial
administration. He estimated 5 to 10 percent of the people opposed
integration with Indonesia.
   ``The 450 years of Portuguese rule made us different, even from
people on the other half of the island,'' he said. West Timor was
part of the Dutch East Indies until Indonesia won independence in
1949.
   Carrascalao described the demonstrations as attempts by ``a very
small minority'' to provoke the armed forces.
   ``They are young high school graduates who cannot find jobs,''
he said. ``Once educated, they don't want to be farmers.''
   In Lisbon, Fretilin spokesman Jose Guterres said the opposite:
``It's not that they are doing this because they don't want to be
farmers. It's a political thing.''
   He said the protesters belonged to a clandestine group formed by
the rebels in 1980.
   Hundreds of schools built by Indonesia since annexation helped
reduce illiteracy from more than 90 percent in colonial days to 31,
Carrascalao said.
   Guterres acknowledged the new schools helped increase literacy,
but added: ``only Indonesian is taught _ Indonesian language,
culture, values. Ours are totally ignored. The only way we learn
them is at home in the family.''
   At Carrascalao's prodding, Indonesia ``opened'' East Timor in
January 1989. Timorese are free to come and go as they please.
Foreigners no longer need permission in visit, but must register on
arrival.
   Anyone planning to travel outside Dili must get a police pass
that lists both destination and the amount of time allowed there.
Officials said there were 6,190 tourists last year.
   When the Dili grapevine identifies foreigners as journalists,
they are approached by Timorese who want to talk about their
plight. None would be identified by name.
   An unemployed man in his 20s said he was ``not necessarily in
favor of Fretilin, but at least we should be allowed to vote (on)
our future.''
   A teen-ager lifted his shirt to display multiple scars he said
were from wounds inflicted by soldiers. Another insisted ``the
atmosphere of terror has intensified'' since January, but gave no
specifics.
   Asked how many guerrillas remain, Carrascalao said: ``I don't
know exactly ... a very small number but with high mobility.''
   Guterres, who said he fought with the guerrillas before reaching
Portugal two years ago, said Fretilin had 5,000 armed fighters,
plus its own militia within the local population.
   Indonesian military sources have said for four years the
guerrillas number about 400.
   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 175 million people are Moslems,
but the population of East Timor is predominantly Catholic. Early
last year, Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo, head of the church in East
Timor, urged the United Nations to organize a referendum on the
territory's future.
   Belo became bishop after his predecessor was forced to resign in
1983 _ because, church sources said, he had criticized conditions
in East Timor.

<DATELINE>DILI, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Separatists holding out in East Timor
against Indonesian rule have two counterparts in the outer reaches
of the world's largest archipelago.
   One trouble spot is the Special Region of Aceh, conservatively
Moslem and historically rebellious, at the tip of Sumatra. In the
17th century, Aceh had a cavalry with Persian horses, an elephant
corps and a navy strong enough to hold off the Portuguese.
   The other is 3,100 miles to the east: the former Dutch territory
of West Irian, which has been the Indonesian province of Irian Jaya
since 1963 and shares the island of New Guinea with independent
Papua New Guinea.
   The colonial Dutch never really succeeded in bringing Aceh under
control and fought a war with the local sultan that lasted 35
years, until 1903.
   When the Japanese occupied Sumatra in 1942, Aceh declared itself
independent. When the Dutch tried to recolonize after World War II,
Aceh resisted.
   Aceh was cool to the idea of joining newly independent
Indonesia, and declared itself an independent Islamic republic in
1951. That happened after the Indonesians made the mistake of
trying to incorporate it into the province of North Sumatra.
   Only when it was designated in 1967 as a Special Region did Aceh
agree to end its rebellion in exchange for a promises that it would
have a measure of real autonomy.
   Autonomy did not materialize, but Banda Aceh, the provincial
capital, has its own laws on culture, religion and education. In a
country that portrays itself as a secular humanist state with a
belief in one god but freedom of worship, Aceh is the most
fervently Moslem region.
   A new independence movement emerged in the mid-1970s when the
Aceh Merdeka (Free Aceh) movement began supporting armed
guerrillas. It was believed to have been smothered years ago, but
some officials say it has revived in recent months.
   Ambush killings that started in April are blamed variously on
drug gangs, army deserters and Libyan-trained rebels. At least 26
people were reported slain in a three-week period.
   The killers are officially known as members of a ``security
disturbing movement,'' or GPK from the Indonesian words gerakan
pengacau keamanan. This generic label is applied to all separatist
groups, in an apparent attempt to detract from the seriousness of
rebel threats.
   In Irian Jaya, the Organisasi Papua Merdeka (Free Papua
Movement) has been fighting for either independence or a merger
with Papua New Guinea ever since incorporation into Indonesia
became final.
   The Dutch had promised the Irianese they would have independence
someday, but then-President Sukarno pushed Indonesia's claim to
West Irian.
   Indonesian troops invaded in 1962 and the United States helped
prod Indonesia and the Netherlands into negotiations under U.N.
auspices.
   Jakarta was awarded administrative control of West Irian in
1963, with the understanding that a free election would determine
the former colony's status. In 1969, tribal chiefs voted
unanimously to incorporate it into Indonesia.
   This ``act of free choice'' was criticized at the time for not
being a vote of the people, but Indonesia argued that a
consensus-gathering exercise among tribal leaders was more
appropriate to the culture.
   Irian Jaya's people are Papuan _ ethnic Melanesians whose
cultural and linguistic heritage shares little with the rest of
Indonesia's diverse ethnic groups, especially the dominant Javanese.
   The armed struggle began in 1969. For the most part, it is
conducted without modern weapons or aid from abroad. Diplomats and
foreign missionaries say the rebels have no chance of winning.

   A plan to help cut the deficit by taxing
securities transactions not only won't raise money but runs the
risk of choking off market liquidity and hamstringing American

   The warning came Thursday from groups representing both the
securities and futures industries, which in the past have been at
odds over legislation.
   They noted that other countries with securities transaction
taxes are now reducing or eliminating them because the taxes have

<HEAD>Market Groups Worried About Impact of Securities Trading Tax</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The administration is apparently looking at
the securities industry for new taxes, prompting trade groups to
counter with arguments than new levies would drive investors and
traders overseas.
   Industry trade groups were responding Thursday to word that the
Bush administration is considering an securities transfer excise
tax of up to 0.5 percent on the sale of stocks, bonds, futures
contracts and other financial products.
   Countries with securities transaction taxes are now reducing or
eliminating them, the trade groups said.
   The taxes have made the countries less competitive with those
that do not have the taxes, the industry leaders said. Critics of
transaction taxes in West Germany and Sweden have blamed them for
driving away business to other financial centers like London.
   ``It seems to defy common sense to have America embarking on a
tax now,'' said Edward O'Brien, president of the Securities
Industry Association.
   ``It would be a real shoot-yourself-in-the-foot, if we were to
institute anything like that when our market share is so
vulnerable,'' said John Damgard, president of the Futures Industry
Association.
   A Treasury spokesman declined to comment on a report in The Wall
Street Journal Thursday that: ``Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
and Budget Director Richard Darman are said to be intrigued by the
idea, but not committed to it.''
   Congress and the White House are trying to work out a way to cut
the deficit through a series of negotiations.
   The transaction tax was the latest idea to surface since
President Bush stirred things up by ending his ``Read my lips: no
new taxes'' stance.
   Congress is not in session this week and most key committee
aides were not available for comment.
   Industry officials noted the transaction tax idea is not new.
   ``What's heating this issue up is the fact that suddenly now the
president is purported to have said everything is on the table. So
every idea that anyone's ever had is out there,'' said the Futures
Industry Association's Damgard.
   Sarah Teslik, executive director of the Council of Individual
Investors, a group of 65 large pension funds with $300 billion in
assets, said the group has not yet issued an official position on
the transaction tax.
   But Ms. Teslik noted that unlike legislation introduced last
fall in an effort to curb short-term trading and market volatility,
the ideas being kicked around do not single out pension funds and
do not put a time limit on how long a stock must be held to avoid
taxation.
   That type of tax, she said, would be an administrative nightmare
for fund managers and could cost pension funds as much as $100
million a year.
   ``It's a bad idea, particularly in light of the fact that other
countries around the world have tried transaction taxes and have
learned the very difficult lesson that it's made them
non-competitive,'' said FIA's Damgard.
   His claim was echoed by the securities association, which
released study findings that it said showed ``an independent
movement underway in many countries to eliminate or reduce the rate
of transfer taxes for competitive purposes.''
   Of 15 countries surveyed, six have either lowered the tax rate
or are eliminating the tax entirely. The SIA survey also noted that
four countries _ Canada, Greece, Luxembourg and the United States _
have no transaction tax at all.
   Last month, SIA's two top officials, O'Brien and Robert Downey,
the chairman, wrote Treasury Secretary Brady asking him to oppose a
securities transaction tax.
   ``It's a universally held view (in the industry),'' O'Brien said
in a telephone interview Thursday. ``If there is some disagreement
with our position, we haven't heard it.''
   He said a tax on transactions could induce individual investors
to slow up or halt their trading; that, in turn, would lessen
market liquidity and drive down prices.

   Gold held no luster for U.S. mutual fund
investors in the second quarter, a new survey of mutual fund
performance says.
   Gold-oriented mutual funds were the lone category to post a
negative rate of return for the April-June period, according to the
latest quarterly survey of 1,755 mutual funds by Lipper Analytical
Services Inc.
   The investment researcher said Thursday the best performers were
mutual funds of health and science stocks, and added that funds
invested in growth stocks generally did better than those invested
in other stocks or in bonds.
   Lipper said health and biotechnology funds posted a 17.11
percent return in the second quarter. Funds invested in science and
technology stocks had an 11.08 percent return, the survey said.
   It was generally an upbeat quarter for mutual funds, which had
posted a negative rate of return on average in the first three
months of the year.
   The average stock fund, including various international and
speciality stock funds, posted a 5.53 percent rate of return, the
survey said. That compared to a negative rate of return of 2.80
percent in the first quarter.
   But the worst performers were gold funds with a negative return
of 10.27 percent in the quarter. All 10 worst-performing funds were
invested in gold.
   A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical, attributed
the dull performance to a decline in gold prices, a feeling that
inflation is under control and speculation that the Soviet Union
may sell gold while moving toward creation of a market-based
economy.
   He said the health stock funds appeared to benefit from drug
introductions and a number of health and biotechnology company
mergers.
   The science and technology funds rose on an improved earnings
outlook following a prolonged slump, Lipper said.
   Lipper said the average general equity fund posted a 5.89
percent return in contrast to a negative 2.31 percent return in the
first three months of 1990.
   Lipper said the turnaround occurred in part because of a decline
in interest rates and the possibility that the opening of markets
in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union would create new customers
for U.S. companies.
   Stock funds invested in companies expected to show earnings
growth achieved the highest rates of return among the general
equity funds with 7.52 percent for small company growth funds and
7.03 percent for all types of growth funds.
   Those performances beat the Standard and Poor's 500 index which
gained 6.29 percent in the quarter, including estimated dividend
reinvestment.
   Capital appreciation funds posted a 5.86 percernt rate of
return, while growth and income funds had a 4.73 percernt return
and equity income funds had a 2.60 percent return. Fixed income
funds had a 3.18 percent return.
   Counting funds invested in bonds, convertible securities and
mixtures of bonds and stocks, the average long-term taxable fund
had a rate of return of 4.65 percent in the quarter, compared with
a negative 1.95 percent in the first quarter, Lipper said.
   Pacific region stock funds had a return of 9.34 percent,
European region funds a return of 7.98 percent and international
funds a 7.76 percent return.
   Lipper's rankings of 1,755 continuing funds for the quarter
assume investors reinvest all dividends and capital gains
distributions made by the funds.
   The top performing fund was Schield Progressive Environmental
Fund, a specialty fund that posted a 29.54 percent return.
   The Denver-based fund has less than $2 million in assets and was
formed only four months ago. In a telephone interview, Marshall
Schield, president of Schield Management, said the fund invests in
socially-responsible companies whose business is cleaning up the
environment.
   That fund was followed by Fidelity Select Biotechnology, a
health stock fund at 23.57 percent, and Bull &amp; Bear Select
Equities, which invests in stocks for capital appreciation, at
22.38 percent.
   The worst performer was Strategic Investments, a gold fund, with
a negative return of 23.55 percent. Next were U.S. Gold Shares with
a a negative return of 16.53 percent and U.S. New Prospector Fund,
another gold fund, with a negative return of 14.96 percent.

<HEAD>Investor Group Boosts Avon Stake</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An investor group's plans to raise its stake in
Avon Products Inc. to 19.8 percent would bring it just short of
triggering the company's takeover defense.
   Partners of Chartwell Associates said Thursday they had bought
3.976 million shares of Avon common stock and members of the
limited partnership have agreed to buy an additional 1.233 million
shares within 30 days.
   The purchases pushed Avon to the top of the New York Stock
Exchange's list of active issues Thursday. It closed at $37, down
75 cents, on volume of more than 4.7 million shares.
   The latest stock acquisition confirmed the partnership's
previously stated ambition to enlarge its Avon holdings
periodically. But there was no immediate indication that Chartwell
has adopted a more aggressive attitude toward Avon or that it plans
to launch a hostile bid for control of the big beauty products
marketer.
   Lissa Perlman, a spokeswoman for the investor group, said
Chartwell has said in the past that it would add to the Avon stock
it has amassed. It views the stake as a long-term investment, she
said.
   Avon's takeover defense would be triggered if one investment
group acquired 20 percent or more of the stock, Avon spokesman John
Cox said.
   When activated, Avon's poison pill would allow stockholders
other than those involved in a 20 percent or larger block to buy
shares of the company at half price. This would dilute the value of
the 20 percent block and possibly concentrate a greater proportion
of the outstanding stock in friendly hands.
   A federal appeals court ruling in late June removed a legal
impediment to Chartwell's further acquisitions of Avon. The ruling
affirmed a lower court decision that declared an amendment to
Avon's shareholders rights plan invalid. The amendment would have
reduced the level at which the poison pill becomes effective to
12.5 percent from 20 percent.
   Chartwell, which has close ties to one of Avon's competitors in
the direct sales business, Mary Kay Corp., is increasing its total
holdings of Avon common stock to 26.19 percent from 17 percent with
the two purchases.
   The Chartwell partners that did the buying were the Fisher
brothers of New York and the Getty Family Trust.
   Chartwell said it bought most of the shares from A-J
Partnership, whose principals include the Minneapolis-based
investor Irwin Jacobs and Amway Corp., a large, privately held
direct marketer.
   Amway and Jacobs last year unsuccessfully attempted to take over
Avon. Avon's board rejected their two, separate takeover bids and
has steadfastly maintained that the company is not for sale.
   Cox said the disposal of the A-J partnership stock was not
surprising given that the group was never regarded as a long-term
investor in Avon.
   He said the sale ``eliminates a major source of instability'' in
Avon stock because it had been widely assumed that A-J partnership
could unload its stake on the market at any time.
   Chartwell has exerted pressure on Avon on and off since last
November. A principal in Chartwell, John P. Rochon, who is vice
chairman of Mary Kay, has made several takeover advances on Avon.
   Chartwell threatened to wage a proxy fight earlier this year but
a battle was averted in the spring when Avon agreed to support
Chartwell nominees to two of the four slots available on its board.
The Chartwell candidates were elected at Avon's annual meeting in
May.
   The settlement also led to the establishment of a special
committee to consider ways of boosting value for Avon stockholders,
including a recapitalization, asset sales or even a sale of the
entire company.
   Members of the committee include the two newly installed
Chartwell-backed board members plus four Avon executives.
   Cox said the committee has held one meeting so far. No timetable
has been set for the panel to present recommendations.

<HEAD>SEC Upheld in 10-Year Case Against Ernst &amp; Whinney</HEAD>

   The giant accounting firm, Ernst &amp; Young, says
it will not appeal a newly upheld Securities and Exchange
Commission administrative action dating from when the firm was
known as Ernst &amp; Whinney.
   On Thursday, an administrative law judge ruled in favor of the
SEC and imposed a 45-day ban against new SEC-related assignments
for the firm.
   In the same decision, Michael L. Ferrante, a managing partner of
the firm's White Plains, N.Y. office, was censured.
   ``This is a very old matter in which the civil litigation was
concluded many years ago without any payment by the firm,'' a
spokesman for Ernst &amp; Young in New York. ``After almost 10 years,
we believe it is time to put the entire matter behind us. This will
have no effect on our ability to serve our clients,'' added the
spokesman, Mort Meyerson. He noted that Ferrante remains managing
partner of the White Plains office.
   Ernst &amp; Whinney changed its name to Ernst &amp; Young and moved its
headquarters from Cleveland to New York after merging with Arthur
Young last year.
   The action stems from SEC findings in 1985 that Ernst &amp; Whinney
engaged in ``unethical or improper professional conduct'' in
handling the financial statements of U.S. Surgical Corp., a
Norwalk, Conn.-based medical prodcuts developer and manufacturer.
   SEC regulations require companies that sell publicly-traded
stock to have their financial statements certified by outside
public accountants to protect investors.
   Surgical, which designed and developed surgical staplers and
other wound-closing instruments, overstated its pre-tax income by
18 percent in 1980 and by 67.8 percent in 1981, allegedly to cover
up expenses incurred in protecting patents and battling
competitors, the SEC said.
   The financial statements were cleared by Ernst &amp; Whinney
auditors.
   The firm contended that while ``accounting decisions were made
and auditing procedures were performed whose appropriateness might
be debatable'' it didn't amount to improper professional conduct.
   After 50 days of hearings between Aug. 18, 1986 and March 3,
1987, Administrative Law Judge Jerome K. Soffer upheld the SEC.
   Soffer ruled that Ernst &amp; Whinney offices in the New York
metropolitan area _ including White Plains _ are barred for the
next 45 days from taking on new clients who will have dealings with
the SEC.
   But the firm can continue handling current client accounts.

   Sharp disagreement among Detroit automakers
over the need for a gasoline tax increase could lessen the powerful
lobby's impact on the debate over reducing the federal budget
deficit, an auto consumers' group says.
   Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. favor boosting the
9-cents-per-gallon federal levy on gasoline by a nickel a year for
three to five years. Every penny increase would raise about $1
billion.
   But General Motors Corp., the nation's largest automobile
manufacturer, opposes any increase in gas taxes.
   The squabble is unusual in an industry that often puts unity
ahead of competition in lobbying Congress.
   ``They could be much more effective if they were together on
this one,'' said Richard Hebert, spokesman for the American
Automobile Association, which is assembling a coalition to fight
any attempt to boost the gas tax.
   The tax frequently is mentioned as a potential source of new
revenue as the White House and congressional leaders negotiate a
deficit reduction plan.
   The Big Three U.S. automakers usually reach common positions on
legislative issues with a major impact on their industry, such as
the pending Clean Air Act rewrite.
   But sometimes consensus eludes them.
   ``It isn't the norm, but it does happen,'' said Tim McCarthy,
lobbyist for the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers' Association, which
represents the Big Three, Honda, Volvo and some truck companies.
``It's a competitive industry with differences of opinion.''
   McCarthy said it was too early to tell whether the automakers
would clash if the budget negotiations produced a package including
a higher gas tax.
   Currently, the industry is more concerned with the clean air
bill and a proposal to require a substantial improvement in
gasoline mileage for new cars, he said.
   ``Which isn't to say that the tax issue is going to fall through
the cracks, but it's just kind of hazy as to how intense the
lobbying will be,'' McCarthy said.
   At the heart of the Big Three's dispute is how a gas tax
increase would affect auto sales.
   GM contends many people would delay new car purchases. The
company has predicted that a 15-cents-per-gallon increase would
reduce sales by 500,000 and eliminate 120,000 jobs.
   ``I don't think the country wants to see lower car sales,'' GM
chairman Roger Smith said. ``We have constantly said and I think
Congress has said that the gasoline tax is too regressive, that it
hurts the poor people.''
   Chrysler agrees a higher tax might hurt sales, ``but not
significantly,'' spokesman John Guiniven said. ``We also feel that
reducing the budget deficit would reduce interest rates and that
could spur car sales and the entire economy.''
   Chrysler chairman Lee Iaccoca is an outspoken supporter of
higher gas taxes, which he says would encourage people to drive
more fuel-efficient cars. In the 1980s, Chrysler's marketing
strategy emphasized more fuel-efficient vehicles.
   A higher tax would boost conservation, lower the nation's trade
deficit and help counter global warming by curbing emissions,
Iaccoca said.
   ``Consumers must demand more fuel-efficient vehicles, and today
they have no reason to do that,'' Iaccoca said. The cost of driving
has been cut in half since the 1960s when adjusted for inflation
and improved fuel efficiency, he said.
   Smith said a more equitable revenue-raiser would be a ``global
warming tax'' on carbon-producing fuels such as petroleum, coal and
natural gas.
   Ford would accept a gradual gas tax increase as part of a
package of consumption taxes, company spokesman Mark Miller said.
``But we believe it should go toward reducing the deficit and not
toward increasing government spending,'' he said.
   Foreign automakers generally have stayed out of the debate. But
most would prefer a gas tax increase to legislation requiring
better fuel economy, said Charles Lockwood, general counsel for the
Association of International Automobile Manufacturers.

<HEAD>Neil Bush Ordered to Answer Conflict Charges at Hearing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Savings and loan regulators are ordering
President Bush's son, Neil, to answer conflict-of-interest charges
in public, despite objections from the younger Bush's attorney.
   Regulators said Neil Bush, as an officer of a Denver thrift
institution, voted to approve millions of dollars in loans from the
S&amp;L to one of his business partners.
   The administrative charges, filed in February, were released
Thursday as part of a new policy at the Treasury Department's
Office of Thrift Supervision. The agency scheduled a public hearing
for Sept. 25 before an administrative law judge in Denver.
   ``I think it's unfortunate if it creates a political sideshow or
a media sideshow,'' said James Nesland, a lawyer for Neil Bush.
``But I'm still confident the administrative law judge will decide
the case on its merits.''
   The judge will make a recommendation to OTS Director Timothy
Ryan, who will decide whether or not to issue a cease-and-desist
order prohibiting Bush from violating regulations in the future.
   The agency is not seeking more serious penalties, such as
financial restitution or banning Bush from working for a bank or
savings and loan.
   Separately, OTS said it is seeking a record $24 million from the
former chairman of a large California thrift, Columbia Savings and
Loan of Beverly Hills. It accused Thomas Spiegel of squandering
deposits on luxury condominiums, trips to Europe and a gun
collection.
   Spiegel, a close associate of Michael Milken, former Drexel
Burnham Lambert junk bond chief, built the institution into one of
the nation's largest. It had the industry's biggest portfolio of
high-yield, high-risk bonds, valued at $3.7 billion at the end of
1989.
   In a statement, Spiegel denied the charges and accused the
agency of conducting a politically motivated ``trial by press
release.''
   Neil Bush served on the board of Silverado Banking, Savings and
Loan Association from August 1985 to August 1988. It collapsed in
December 1988 at an estimated cost to taxpayers of $1 billion.
   The charges said Bush voted to approve loans totaling $45
million to Bill L. Walters, an investor in and lender to Bush's oil
exploration company, JNB Exploration Co. He also voted to approve
Silverado's purchase of $58.4 million in properties from Walters,
the document said.
   The thrift office also said Bush inadequately disclosed his ties
to Kenneth Good, a developer who defaulted on loans to Silverado.
   Bush, in a reply a month after the charges were filed, said he
had not violated his duty as a director. He denied some specific
charges and, of others, said he ``lacks sufficient present
knowledge or information to form a belief as to the allegations.''
   The House Banking Committee obtained and released a preliminary
draft of the charges in June.
   Last week, President Bush said he had ``full confidence in the
integrity and honor'' of his son and pledged not to interfere with
the investigation.
   Ryan, appointed by the president in April, said Treasury
Department officials declined his offer to consider their advice on
the disclosure policy. He said he did not confer with the White
House.
   Under the new OTS policy, the agency generally will release
charges and conduct hearings in public for the officers of thrifts
already closed or seized by the government and for the former
officers of still-open S&amp;Ls.
   In the past, only final decisions had been made public.
   To avoid the danger of depositor runs, proceedings against
current officers of open S&amp;Ls generally will continue to be
conducted in private, Ryan told a news conference.
   ``The public has a major stake in the cleanup of the thrift
industry, and as a general rule I believe it is reasonable to make
enforcement proceedings open when dealing with
government-controlled thrifts,'' he said.
   In the Columbia case, the thrift office is seeking $19 million
in restitution, which would go to the still-open S&amp;L, and $5
million in penalties. which would go to the U.S. Treasury.
   Regulators allege Spiegel improperly spent deposits on
limousines, corporate aircraft, luxury resort condominiums for his
own use, $7,000 in tickets for a Michael Jackson concert, a $2,000
wine-tasting course and a $55,000 gun collection that included Uzi
submachine guns.
   Edward Harshfield, who succeeded Spiegel at Columbia, said in a
statement that the institution's current management cooperated with
the investigation. He said the allegations do not reflect on
current management or the institution as a whole.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's adopted hometown has scrubbed
itself squeaky-clean for next week's economic summit, but the real
gleam in its welcoming smile reflects the pride of a city whose
mood was as low as the price of Texas crude a few years ago.
   Civic officials hope the foreign leaders from Britain, Japan,
West Germany, Italy, Canada and France, will return home with an
image of a Houston that may not be as wealthy as it was in the
glory days of the oil boom, but is healthier and wiser.
   Certainly the city has come a long way since the oil price
collapse of the mid-1980s left it with clogged bankruptcy courts,
empty skyscrapers and emptier banks.
   The energy industry still accounts for 40 percent of the local
economy, but growth in services, electronics, biotechnology and
medicine coupled with a stable chunk of the U.S. space program have
made the renaissance possible.
   According to local business executives, 77 percent of the
220,000 jobs lost to the recession have been recovered, with a
majority of those positions unrelated to energy. The jobless rate
now hovers around 5 percent, compared to nearly triple that in 1987.
   Even the real estate market has shown recent gains after
devastation by a combination of overbuilding and the plunge in oil
prices from $40 to $10 per barrel. Empty high-rise buildings are a
thing of the past, and there's even talk of a new skyscraper rising
in the heart of Houston.
   To help the city show off for the summit, an army of volunteers
has braved 90-degree-plus temperatures to remove more than 3
million pounds of trash and trim the city's foliage.
   At Rice University, where the summit sessions will be held,
furniture and light fixtures are being replaced, new sidewalks
poured, trees and bushes replanted. Flowers are everywhere.
   The leaders of seven major industrial democracies will have a
special platform to channel cool air beneath their seats during
Monday's outdoor welcoming ceremonies, an early afternoon affair.
   ``I felt like I needed to do something for the community,'' said
Rita Roy, 28, one of the thousands of cleanup volunteers. ``I think
they should do this all the time, and not just for the summit.''
   The business community has donated $4 million in cash plus $6
million in time and services to make certain the city puts on a
good show. The federal government is spending another $5.2 million,
including security and law enforcement.
   Besides the big broom and coat of fresh paint, city officials
orchestrating summit hoopla for more than 3,000 out-of-town
reporters covering the annual international event hoped to show a
gentler and more sophisticated side of the city. Some of the
presummit media feasts, for example, will be held at the city's
museums.
   But this is Texas, after all, and the following day it's back to
the classic Texas stereotype, with a barbecue and rodeo and country
music concert. The heads of state will leave town carrying cowboy
boots, Western hats and big belt buckles.
   The timing couldn't be better for hotel operators, who find
steamy July one of their slowest periods.
   ``Any time you get business in July in this city, you make
money,'' said John Blanton, director of marketing for the Inn on
the Park hotel that will house some of the summit delegations.
   It's estimated the summit itself will pump from $50 million to
$125 million into the city's economy.
   ``Houston has fashioned a substantial economic recovery,'' said
M. Ray Perryman, director of the Baylor University Forecasting
Service. ``The prospects for Houston are outstanding.''

   The dollar remained relatively firm against the
Japanese yen today, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
recouped most of its losses from the previous day.
   The dollar closed at 150.95 yen, down 0.05 yen from Thursday's
close. After opening slightly higher at 151.17 yen, it ranged
between 150.80 and 151.30 yen.
   ``The dollar has been firm since it hit the 149-yen level'' on
Wednesday, said Toshio Takahashi, a dealer with the Industrial Bank
of Japan. ``It seems the dollar is comfortable at a 150-151 yen
level.''
   Takahashi said the dollar's direction would be more clearly
known if ``something more concrete'' emerges from President Bush's
indication last Tuesday that U.S. tax revenues might be raised to
help cut the federal budget deficit.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues gained 93.45 points, or 0.29 percent, closing the week at
32,445.12. The index lost 94.25 points on Thursday.
   An estimated 450 million shares on the first section changed
hands, up from Thursday's 430 million shares.
   Masahiro Umemori, an analyst with Nomura Securities, said the
index fell on small-lot selling because of uncertainty about
interest rates and exchange rates in the morning.
   With stabilizing bond markets in the afternoon, shares were
bought centering on heavy electrical machinery and precision
instruments, Umemori said.
   He said the stock market was awaiting the release of U.S.
employment figures for June, to be announced by the U.S. Labor
Department later today.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 87.05 points as of 4 p.m. (3 a.m.
EDT), up from Thursday's 86.98. The yield fell to 7.180 percent,
down from the previous day's 7.195 percent.

   The stock market was mixed today as traders
studied the latest reading on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.93 to 2,886.14 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 325 up, 520 down and
509 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 16.60 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts had been expecting a quiet session in the absence of
many traders taking time off after Independence Day on Wednesday.
   The Labor Department reported that nonfarm payroll employment
increased by 40,000 in June.
   Employment data for the past few months have been skewed by
temporary hiring for the Census. But brokers said the June data
generally lived up to expectations.
   The figures were seen as confirming sluggish growth, at best, in
business activity _ while at the same time probably not signaling
enough weakness to prompt any immediate relaxation of the Federal

<HEAD>UAL Workers Still Expect To Buy Jets</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Airlines employees seeking to buy the
carrier's parent say UAL Corp. still is likely to place an aircraft
purchase order soon _ but not until the workers secure loans for
the buyout.
   The union-led buyout group and UAL's board of directors
announced Thursday that the company had suspended talks on a major
order for widebody jets at the request of the buyout group, the
United Employees Acquisition Corp.
   ``The purpose of this temporary delay is to permit UEAC to
complete related financial negotiations with vendors while
achieving the most efficient timing for placing an order,'' the
buyout group said in a statement.
   ``This delay does not change the fact that a widebody aircraft
order will likely take place soon.''
   UAL directors said the aircraft order negotiations are on hold
until Aug. 9, the deadline for the employees to secure financing
for their proposed acquisiton of the company.
   Steven Matthews, a spokesman for the buyout group, said the
delay did not reflect concerns about the employees' ability to find
financing for both the $4.38 billion airline acquisition and the
aircraft purchases.
   The buyout group is trying to persuade a number of airframe and
engine manufacturers to invest in the buyout.
   Published reports have indicated the employees are negotiating
with Boeing Co. and General Electric Co., as well as European
manufacturers, trying to get the companies to put up some of the
cash for the buyout. The companies could become preferred suppliers
for the airline, as well as receiving either preferred stock or a
note in UAL.
   An analyst says the delay in the order may indicate a more
cautious approach by employees leaders, who previously said they'd
have no problem getting financing for the airline and plane
purchases.
   ``It sounds like they're saying, `Let's take care of the
financing for the buyout first and then see what we can do on the
aircraft acquisition,''' said Mark Daugherty, an airline analyst
with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York.
   UAL's board said it had halted negotiations with aircraft and
engine manufacturers until Aug. 9, the deadline for the buyout
group to get financing for the acquisition of UAL, which is based
near Chicago in Elk Grove Village.
   The board said it took the action in ``an effort to be as
accommodating as possible'' to the buyout group.
   A spokesman for the buyout group, Steven Matthews, said the
group is confident it can raise the money to buy both the airline
and new planes.
   UAL had been expected to announce within a matter of weeks the
largest order ever placed for wide-body jetliners, possibly
including Boeing Co.'s proposed model 777.
   Although Boeing is well into development of the 777, it has not
formally committed to building the 350-seat, twin-engine aircraft.
That decision, expected this summer, depends on Boeing getting
enough orders to make starting production worthwhile.
   No orders have been announced to date.
   In Seattle, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group spokesman Craig
Martin said he assumed negotiations with UAL would resume in August.
   Boeing has been negotiating ``hot and heavy as have Airbus and
McDonnell Douglas,'' Martin said. ``Things had been moving toward
some resolution.''

   Grain and soybean futures prices were slightly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
extending Thursday's steep losses amid predictions the Midwest's
good growing weather will continue.
   Prices opened narrowly mixed as the corn and soybean markets
tried to rally back after the previous session's collapse, which
was triggered by a National Weather Service forecast for normal
temperatures and above-normal rain in the Midwest during the latter
half of next week.
   The National Weather Service was to issue a new six-to-10-day

   Stock prices rose in light trading today as
traders studied the latest reading on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 16.33 to
2,895.54 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 728 up, 466 down and
573 unchanged.
   Analysts had expected a quiet session in the absence of many
traders who were taking time off after Independence Day on
Wednesday.
   The Labor Department reported that nonfarm payroll employment
increased by 40,000 in June.
   Employment data for the past few months have been skewed by
temporary hiring for the Census. But brokers said the June data
generally lived up to expectations.
   The figures were seen as confirming sluggish growth, at best, in
business activity _ while at the same time probably not signaling
enough weakness to prompt any immediate relaxation of the Federal
Reserve's credit policy.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Boeing, up ~ at 60&lsqb;;
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up &rsqb; at 38{; Philip Morris, up 1\
at 48}, and General Electric, up } at 71.
   Eli Lilly rose 1&lsqb; to 87&rsqb; and Genentech gained | to 29|. A
research study published this week reported evidence that a growth
hormone produced by the companies can reverse some of the effects
of aging in older men.
   Mack Trucks, traded in the over-the-counter market, added 1&lsqb; to
6&rsqb;. Renault of France, which owns about 44.5 percent of Mack,
announced plans to make a $6-a-share bid for the rest of the stock.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.07 to 195.52. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .58 at 357.91.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 57.76 million shares at
noontime, against 61.81 million at the same point Thursday.

<HEAD>Nathaniel Wyeth, Inventor of Plastic Bottle, Dies at 78</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAINT GEORGE, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nathaniel Wyeth, the brother of
artist Andrew Wyeth and the inventor of the plastic soda bottle,
died at his home in this coastal community. He was 78.
   Wyeth, who lived in the village of Tenants Harbor in Saint
George, was pronounced dead at the Penobscot Bay Medical Center in
Glen Cove on Wednesday night, hospital spokesman Russell Donahue
said Friday.
   While other members of the family achieved greater fame with
their art work _ his late father, N.C. Wyeth, was also a well-known
artist-illustrator _ Wyeth achieved distinction in science during a
40-year career with the Du Pont Co.
   Wyeth was best known for developing the polyethylene
terephthalate, or PET, bottle, which he invented in the early
1970s. The bottle is used for carbonated beverages, wine, liquor
and food because of its light weight and impact resistance. It was
patented in 1973, and more than 6 million of the containers are
produced annually around the world.
   He began his career at Du Pont in 1936 in the company's
engineering department and held numerous other positions before
being named the company's first engineering fellow in 1963. In
1975, he was named the first senior engineering fellow, the
company's highest technical position.
   Wyeth invented 25 processes and products that spanned a wide
range, including plastics, textile fibers, electronics and
mechanical systems.
   Throughout his career, Wyeth worked closely with mechanical
engineering students engaged in research. After retirement, he
continued to lecture on creativity in engineering and served as a
consultant to Du Pont and universities.
   He received many awards, including the 1981 Society of Plastics
Engineers International Award for Outstanding Achievement for the
development of the PET bottle. The Rose-Hulman Institute of
Technology in Terre Haute, Ind., awarded him an honorary doctorate
of engineering in 1982. He was elected to the Plastics Hall of Fame
by the Society for Plastics Industry in 1986.
   Wyeth also was an accomplished craftsman known for creating
unusual and detailed furniture miniatures.
   He held a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and a
master's degree from the University of Pennsylvania.
   Wyeth is survived by his wife, Jean, five sons, his brother,
three sisters, three stepsons and a stepdaughter.

   Control Data Corp. again is seeking
buyers for VTC Inc., its 400-employee semiconductor maker in
Bloomington.
   A potential buyer, Seattle Silicon of Bellevue, Wash., still
wants to buy VTC for an undisclosed amount, but delays in arranging
financing have cost it its exclusive purchase rights.
   As a result, Control Data again is seeking interest in the
business, spokeswoman Linda Jadwin said Thursday.
   VTC is Control Data's last big money-losing operation. Control
Data, also based in Bloomington, created $100 million in reserves
last year to compensate for the losses it expects to incur on the
sale.
   In April, the computer maker announced an agreement to sell VTC
to Seattle Silicon. But Seattle Silicon's prime investor in the
deal backed out, said Amaury Piedra, the company's president.
   Piedra said the San Francisco brokerage and investment firm
Hambrecht &amp; Quist, which owns a majority stake in Seattle Silicon,
subsequently agreed to finance the VTC purchase. He said he hoped
to conclude a deal by the end of July.
   In a separate matter, Control Data this week sold Doane
Information Services, a publisher of agricultural newsletters and
software.
   Doane, which has 50 employees, will become a division of Doane
Agricultural Services of Cherry Valley, Ill. No terms were
disclosed.

<DATELINE>ROSSLYN, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gannett Co. today confirmed it expects its
second quarter earnings to be lower than a year earlier, its first
quarterly drop since the company went public 22 years ago.
   Sheila Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the nation's biggest newspaper
company, said Gannett would issue its actual earnings report for
the April-June period in a few weeks.
   Gannett stock was down 50 cents at $36.62{ a share in midday
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Douglas McCorkindale, Gannett's vice chairman and chief
financial officer, first projected an earnings decline during an
interview published in today's editions of The Wall Street Journal.
   McCorkindale said he could not disagree with Wall Street
analysts who forecast that Gannett's net income would be below the
$112.1 million, or 70 cents a share, of the year-earlier quarter.
However, he would not predict specific earnings figures.
   A decline in earnings would indicate how Gannett is being
affected by a slump that has hit the entire newspaper industry. A
number of Wall Street analysts have forecast declines for earnings
of many newspaper publishers because of the soft ad revenue.
   ``We started to see softness in advertising business in 1989,
and have been getting softer in the last eight to 12 months,''
McCorkindale said. ``We have not seen any signs of improved
business conditions.''
   The expected earnings decline would come at a difficult time for
Gannett.
   The Gannett Foundation, the company's largest shareholder,
announced April 26 that it planned to sell its 10 percent stake. A
weak stock price could make the company a possible takeover target.
   The foundation, headed by former Gannett Chairman Allen
Neuharth, is sorting through potential bidders.
   Shares traded as high as $55.25 in 1987 and were at $36.75 when
the foundation announced the planned sale.

<HEAD>British Airways Places Order for Up to 33 Boeing 747s</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Airways PLC announced today it had ordered
as many as 33 Boeing Co. 747 aircraft worth up to $6.9 billion, the
airline's biggest-ever investment in new planes.
   The firm order for 21 747-400s is the fourth largest for
Seattle-based Boeing in dollar value.
   British Airways said it was seeking extra passenger capacity as
well as replacements for its older aircraft.
   Analysts said the airline was placing the order now so it would
not have to wait long for new planes amid growing world demand to
replace older aircraft.
   ``All they're doing is protecting their position in terms of
requirements. They didn't want to be last in the queue,'' said Dan
White, an analyst with the London investment firm County Natwest
Woodmac.
   British Airways said it has placed firm orders for 21 new Boeing
747-400 long-range aircraft for 2.33 billion pounds, the equivalent
of $4.15 billion, and has taken an option to buy 12 more for 1.55
billion pounds, or $2.8 billion.
   Deliveries will start in 1992 and are expected to be completed
seven years later, bringing British Airways' 747-400 fleet to 42
aircraft on the basis of firm orders.
   The company has bought 21 747-400s since 1986 and operates 224
airplanes in all.
   ``The aircraft will provide extra capacity as well as allowing
us to replace older Boeing 747 equipment,'' British Airways
Chairman Lord King said. ``Our 747-400s are delivering good
performance and proving popular with intercontinental passengers.''
   Rolls-Royce PLC won the $1.07 billion contract for the engines,
the airline said. Rolls-Royce spokesman Dick Dalton in Reston, Va.,
said the deal was for 160 RB211-524G engines, including spares.
   King said British Airways obtained the right to convert any of
the orders if Boeing develops a larger version of the 747.
   Boeing executives have conjectured that in the late 1990s, the
company could build a ``747 super.'' The plane would be
significantly larger than the model 400, which can carry 412
passengers more than 8,000 miles, and more than 560 in short-range
versions.
   However, company officials have said no decision has been made
to actually build such a plane, and Boeing has offered no specifics
on how large the plane might be.
   ``There's nothing in the works at all,'' said John Wheeler,
spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplane Group in Seattle.
   He said the conversion options negotiated by British Airways are
``just insurance on the part of the airline'' in case Boeing does
come up with another jet.
   Boeing's largest-ever firm order for aircraft was a $9.4 billion
deal from Irish leasing company GPA Ltd. in April 1989. So far this
year, Boeing has received orders for 240 aircraft, worth a total
$25.3 billion. Its firm-order backlog now stands at more than 1,700
aircraft.
   British Airways also said it would begin a 30 million pound, or
$53 million, refurbishment program for its fleet of 747-100
aircraft to keep them operating at high standards until they
progressively are replaced by the new fleet.
   British Airways did not say how it would pay for the new
airplanes. Analysts said they expected the airline to own some of
the aircraft and obtain leases on others to contain costs.
   John Lawson, an analyst with Nomura Research Institute in
London, said he would not be surprised if the airline sold
ownership of some planes to a leasing company and then took out
operating leases on them. Such arrangements are known as
lease-backs.
   British Airways has said that it likes to own its aircraft, but
that it has used operating leases on a short-term basis in the past
to meet peak demand.
   Aircraft values have held up well, analysts said. British
Airways recently capitalized on the buoyant trend by selling some
of its 737s and then leasing them back.

interest rates would have to remain high because of the excessive
amount of credit in the economy.

<HEAD>Government Approves Small Cut in Producer Rice Price for 1990</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amid U.S. pressure on Japan to open its rice
market, the government Friday decided to cut by only 1.5 percent
the price it will pay to rice farmers this year.
   The price cut is the first in two years, but it is much less
than some government officials had hoped for to end U.S. criticism
of Japan's rice market, which is virtually closed to imports.
   An earlier plan by the Agriculture Ministry to cut the price
paid to farmers for their rice crops by about 5 percent was killed
when it was opposed by members of the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party, who depend heavily on farmer support. The party had
requested a freeze on the price.
   The government regulates and subsidizes the domestic rice
market, buying much of the rice crop and reselling it to consumers
at lower prices.
   The subsidy cost the government 311.7 billion yen, or $2.08
billion, in fiscal 1989. The 1.5 percent reduction is expected to
help cut the budget by about 9 billion yen, or $60 million.
   Japanese rice is about four times more expensive than U.S. rice.
   Japan's rice market is likely to be on the agenda at next week's
summit of seven major industrialized nations in Houston, Texas.
   Producer prices were cut by 5.95 percent in 1987 and by 4.6
percent in 1988. They remained unchanged last year, when the ruling
party faced national elections.
   Japan has been criticized for its rice ban during the current
Uruguay round of multilateral trade talks under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   But the nation has insisted on maintaining self-sufficiency for
rice, its staple food. Limited quantities of rice are imported for
use in processed foods.
   Agriculture Minister Tomio Yamamoto is adamantly opposed to
opening the rice market.
   There are signs, however, that some Japanese would welcome a
more flexible position on rice imports.
   The second-largest opposition party recently endorsed easing the
ban on imports, and former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita praised
the decision as courageous.
   Last month, the paper published a national survey it conducted
of 2,397 eligible voters in May. Some 65 percent of those polled
approved of opening Japan's rice market to some foreign imports,
and 21 percent favorded full liberalization.

<HEAD>Westinghouse Wins Lawsuit It Would Have Settled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Westinghouse Electric Co., which offered to
settle an age discrimination lawsuit two years ago for $35 million,
has won the case in federal appeals court.
   The ruling Thursday, prodded by a recent U.S. Supreme Court
decision, ended the court battle that began in 1983 when the
federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission challenged
Westinghouse for forcing laid-off employees to retire prior to age
70 because severance pay was not available.
   The settlement offer, which would given some 4,000 retirees an
average payment of $8,750, was rejected by government lawyers
because they believed the workers would get more in court.
   The 3rd U.S. Court of Appeals last year found Westinghouse
guilty of age discrimination on grounds workers couldn't get both
retirement and severance benefits when forced to retire prior to
age 70.
   However, the Supreme Court vacated the decision and sent the
7-year-old case back for further review, and on Thursday the
appeals court reversed itself, based on the high court's standards
set in another age discrimination case that involved employee
benefit plans.
   ``The choice between retirement and unpaid layoff doesn't
constitute involuntary retirement where, as here, continued work
was not an option for any of the affected employees, and the
employees' layoff status was unrelated to age,'' wrote Judge
Anthony Scirica.
   ``Nor do we believe that exclusion from the severance plan
caused older employees to retire. Those who retired did so because
they were laid off.
   ``Moreover, after 1982, retirement eligible employees could
choose between retirement benefits and severance pay with recall,''
the court said.
   This was not the government position when it sued Westinghouse.
   EEOC lawyers claimed Westinghouse violated federal law by
forcing laid-off employees under 70 to retire because they would
not get severance pay, and also denying those workers a chance to
be recalled to work.
   At the same time, younger workers laid off could lose recall
rights only if they took severance.

<HEAD>Suit Alleges Farm Workers Being Cheated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some labor contractors are cheating
migrant farm workers by collecting _ but not reporting _
unemployment and Social Security taxes, an attorney who filed
federal suits here alleged on Friday.
   In many cases, the contractors fail to report any income by the
worker, leaving them destitute when the season ends or the worker
retires, said James Boon of Florida Legal Services Inc.
   ``With farm workers, unemployment is a very important benefit
because it's a seasonal job, and Social Security is the only
pension plan these people are ever going to participate in,'' Boon
said. ``It really hurts, and it's a real serious violation of law.''
   The suits filed last week allege that farmers in Alabama and
migrant labor crew chiefs based in Belle Glade withheld ``thousands
of dollars in Social Security and unemployment compensation
benefits'' from Palm Beach County farm workers picking Alabama's
sweet corn crop in June 1986, June 1987 and June 1988.
   Most of the workers who filed suits are Haitian immigrants
fluent only in their native Creole language and are generally
unfamiliar with U.S. and state labor laws, Boon said.
   He said they are susceptible to abuses by crew chiefs who may
try to under-report or fail to report the earned wages of farm
workers.
   Crew chiefs work as contractors, providing the labor to harvest
fruit and vegetables and package the crops for shipping. In
addition to providing housing and transportation, they distribute
the migrants' wages and are responsible for complying with federal
labor laws.
   But Boon said only a small number of investigators police the
crew chiefs.
   ``There is a real big incentive not to report wages, especially
if you don't expect to get in trouble for not doing it,'' he said.
   Boon said under current laws, crew chiefs must set aside $15 for
each $100 earned by a worker to be contributed as Social Security,
and about $5 for the state unemployment tax.
   ``The migrants assume the money is sent in, but what happens a
lot of times is that nothing is sent and nothing is reported,''
Boon said.

again Friday, although other strikers were back at work.
   Morten Wolstad of Statoil A@S said the company halted production
for safety reasons when workers continued to defy a government
back-to-work order as well as threats of dismissal. He said
production had reached a rate of 500,000 barrels earlier Friday,
half of Statoil's capacity.
   ``There just aren't enough people working out there,'' said
Wolstad. The strike was in its sixth day on Statoil's Statfjord,
Gullfaks and Veslefrikk North Sea fields and ``we aren't at all
sure when it will end,'' he said by telephone.
   Statoil provides the bulk of Norway's 1.6-million-barrel daily
oil output. Strikers on most other fields returned to work
Thursday, allowing some production to resume.
   Phillips Petroleum Co. Norway expects flows from its seven
Ekofisk area fields to reach normal daily levels over the weekend _
about 220,000 barrels, the national news agency NTB said.
   Numerous other fields depend on pipelines from Ekofisk to move
their natural gas production to West Germany and Britain.
   About 4,000 offshore workers went on strike last Sunday. The
Norwegian Federation of Oil Workers Union and the Norwegian
Confederation of Business and Industry deadlocked on wage increases
and job protection from automation.
   The government, saying Norway could not afford the loss, invoked
compulsory arbitration Monday and ordered the strikers back to
work. Petroleum provides about 25 percent of the national income.
   About 1,000 oil workers defied the order and continued the
strike illegally. Support for the walkout dwindled during the week,
leaving about 300 striking at Statoil's fields Friday, NTB said.

<HEAD>Trump Wins City Tax Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cash-starved developer Donald Trump has won a
tax fight with the city of New York over his Manhattan real estate,
saving $1.2 million on his 1989 taxes.
   Trump's 56-acre waterfront property on the Upper West Side,
assessed by the ciy at $44 million, was instead taxed at a rate
$12.5 million lower after Trump made his case before the city Tax
Commission.
   Trump was one of 19,306 taxpayers who won assessment battles
with the city for 1989. The full list of winners _ which included
the Andy Warhol estate and Alex DiLorenzo, owner of the building
that housed the Happy Land Social Club where 86 people died in an
arson fire _ was released June 29.
   Trump, whose cash flow problems have been well documented, saved
$1.2 million in taxes with the re-evaluation, the city Finance
Department said.
   But that money went right back to the city Thursday, when Trump
made a multi-million dollar property tax payment. Trump shelled out
$2.2 million for his undeveloped West Side property, another $1
million for Trump Tower and $900,000 for the Trump Parc
condominiums.

   Stock prices headed higher in light trading
today as traders studied the latest reading on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 17.82 to
2,897.03 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 784 up, 543 down and
565 unchanged.
   Analysts had expected a quiet session in the absence of many
traders who were taking time off after Independence Day on
Wednesday.
   The Labor Department reported that nonfarm payroll employment
increased by 40,000 in June.
   Employment data for the past few months have been skewed by
temporary hiring for the Census. But brokers said the June data
generally lived up to expectations.
   The figures were seen as confirming sluggish growth, at best, in
business activity _ while at the same time probably not signaling
enough weakness to prompt any immediate relaxation of the Federal
Reserve's credit policy.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Boeing, up 1\ at 60{;
American Express, up { at 31~; Philip Morris, up 1&lsqb; at 48|; Exxon,
up } at 47{, and General Electric, up { at 70}.
   Eli Lilly rose ~ to 87&lsqb; and Genentech gained | to 29|. A
research study published this week reported evidence that a growth
hormone produced by the companies can reverse some of the effects
of aging in older men.
   Mack Trucks, traded in the over-the-counter market, added 1\ to
6{. Renault of France, which owns about 44.5 percent of Mack,
announced plans to make a $6-a-share bid for the rest of the stock.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.14 to 195.59. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value

   Government officials on Friday declined
to confirm a newspaper report that U.S. auto producer Ford Motor
Co. had chosen Portugal for a new leisure vehicle production plant
worth about $2 billion.
   The sum would be the largest single foreign investment in the
booming Iberian country.
   According to the report in the Lisbon daily Publico, Ford has
chosen Setubal, a harbor city 30 miles south of Lisbon, for the new
plant.
   The publication said Ford officials met with the Secretary of
State for Foreign Trade Antonio Neto da Silva Thursday to discuss
financing.
   ``Everything's going well, we're nearly there ... but there'll
be no confirmation until a final accord has been signed,'' said one

   Lin Cummins, a spokeswoman for Ford in Dearborn, Mich., declined

Portugal.
   ``I've heard no such rumors,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   The Acura luxury car division of Japan's Honda
Motor Co. Ltd. has topped the J.D. Power and Associates list of
cars most satisfying to their owners for the fourth year in a row,
the marketing company said Friday.
   The organization said in a news release received in Detroit that
its overall customer-satisfaction index rose about 3 percent to 122
points this year from last year.
   The survey checks consumer attitudes about a variety of aspects
of their vehicles and the dealerships they used. Power surveyed
about 100,000 people who have owned 1989-model cars for the last 12
to 14 months.
   The marketing group refuses to release rankings of vehicles
lower than what proves to be the industry average in any particular
survey. But automakers with cars ranked high in the survey
immediately tout the results in their advertising.
   The group's Customer Satisfaction Index is one of three
principle surveys conducted by the Power organization.
   Earlier this week, Power released its Initial Quality Survey,
which looks into the number of problems reported by consumers
during the first three months of ownership.
   Toyota Motor Corp.'s Lexus Division topped that list and since
then, two-page newspaper advertisements have been appearing around
the nation. General Motors Corp.'s Buick Division was the
highest-ranked U.S. automaker and less than 24 hours after the
quality survey was released, television ads bragging about Buick's
ranking were on the air.
   In addition to Friday's Customer Satisfaction Survey and the
quality survey earlier this week, Power also produces its Vehicle
Dependability Index covering reported problems during the first
four or five years of ownership.
   In the latest survey, Acura was followed by Mercedes-Benz,
second last year; Toyota, fourth last year; Cadillac, fifth in
1989; and Honda, which was third.

<HEAD>Boeing to Cut Employment by Another 2,700 This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co. said today it expects to cut its
Washington state work force by another 2,700 jobs in the second
half of 1990, bringing total job reductions for the year to about
5,600.
   Boeing, which employs 103,800 people in the state and 161,000
worldwide, had said in January that its work force would be reduced
by 5,000 in 1990.
   Boeing spokesman Paul Binder said the increase was due to
defense program cuts that were unknown earlier this year. The
forecast could change again due to further defense spending
decisions, Binder said.
   In the first half of 1990, Boeing reduced its state employment
by about 2,900 people. Of those, about 2,500 quit or retired and
about 400 were laid off, Binder said.
   Boeing, the free world's largest builder of commercial jet
aircraft, has a backlog of more than 1,700 firm orders for
jetliners. However, fewer workers have been needed on its
commercial side because production of its new 747-400 jumbo jet,
which went into service in early 1989, is past the start-up phase,
Binder said.
   Boeing also is working on several defense contracts that have
run into opposition in Congress, including the B-2 stealth bomber.
   Boeing is a major subcontractor to Northrop Corp. for the B-2,
and has about 8,000 people working on the bat-wing bomber in
Seattle.
   Dale Shellhorn, Boeing's B-2 program manager, said last month
that up to 1,500 workers would be laid off or reassigned because of
expected congressional cuts in the bomber program.
   At the beginning of the year, Boeing employed just under 106,700
workers in Washington and 164,600 worldwide.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Skid on Improved Weather Forecasts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices skidded for the
second straight day on the Chicago Board of Trade Friday, as more
weather forecasters predicted ideal weather next week for
Midwestern crop development and winter wheat harvesting.
   The sell-off extended Thursday's steep losses in the corn and
soybean markets as it triggered waves of selling by speculators.
   Earlier this week, some private forecasters were predicting hot,
dry weather for the western and southern reaches of the Corn Belt.
   But by Friday, meteorologists were near unanimous in forecasting
a week of mild temperatures and beneficial showers for the region.
   The corn crop is nearing its pollination phase, when heat and
dryness could reduce yields.
   ``If you don't get a drought at this time of year, it means the
corn crop generally will be developing under favorable
conditions,'' said Katharina Zimmer, a grains analyst with Merrill
Lynch Capital Markets Inc.
   The forecasts contained nothing that would adversely affect
soybeans, which reach their pollination phase in August.
   And the relatively dry conditions expected in the Great Plains
should allow winter wheat harvesting to accelerate.
   At the close, wheat futures were 5{ cents to 9\ cents lower with
the contract for delivery in July at $3.10 a bushel; corn was 4
cents to 7\ cents lower with July at $2.81 a bushel; oats were 4
cents to 4} cents lower with July at $1.31{ a bushel; soybeans were
7 cents to 12 cents lower with July at $6.18 a bushel.

   An explosion and fire ripped through a
city-block-sized section of a chemical plant ``like a rocket just
took off,'' killing 17 workers, authorities and witnesses said.
   The explosion occurred around 11:30 p.m. Thursday as crews were
cleaning waste tanks at the Atlantic Richfield Co. chemical plant
in this Houston suburb. The 564-acre complex employs about 350
people.
   Five workers were injured.
   ``We're in the process of recovering the victims from the
fire,'' Richard Bailey, chief investigator for the Harris County
Sheriff's Department Arson Division, said at midday. ``It looks
like a bomb went off in there.''
   Plant manager Earl McCaleb, his voice breaking, called the
explosion and fire ``a terrible tragedy'' and ``an overwhelming
sadness, the loss of friends and co-workers.''
   Five of the dead were Arco Chemical employees; 11 were employed
by an outside contractor, Austin Industrial Inc. of Houston; and
one was a truck driver. Officials said they believed they had
accounted for all of the missing. Earlier, officials had said there
were 15 confirmed dead and one missing; there was no immediate
explanation on why the death toll then jumped up by two.
   Arco said four people were treated for minor injuries and
released and one person was hospitalized, but could not give
further details. None of the victims was immediately identified.
   McCaleb said the blaze was not extinguished until more than four
hours after the explosion.
   The blast occurred in a utility area, a remote section that
provides cooling, water and steam for plant operations. The
explosion involved two tanks containing wastewater and some
hydrocarbons, McCaleb said.
   Officials said there were an unsually large number of people in
the area of the plant complex because crews were cleaning the tanks.
   Authorities had not determined a cause for the explosion.
Assistant Secretary of Labor Gerard F. Scannell was en route to
Houston this morning, the Labor Department said.
   ``I seen a big flash cross in front of my eyes. I looked over to
my left and I saw a big ball of fire. ... It looked to me like a
tank run off, you know, like a rocket just took off,'' Mike Zugel,
a truck driver who witnessed the explosion, told Cable News Network.
   There were no evacuations of people living in the area,
according to fire dispatcher Karen Ragsdale.
   Rose Ann Raupp, an investigator for the Harris County medical
examiner's office, said her office was working with plant employees
in an attempt to recover the bodies.
   ``The area is roughly about a city block,'' Jack Johnson,
president of Philadelphia-based Arco Chemical of North America,
said late this morning. ``It's pretty obvious the explosion at the
tank was devastating to that particular portion of the plant.
   ``It's been a tremendous strain on all of the employees here at
the plant. We continue to work to clear the lines and finish the
cleanup. We currently are moving that portion of the tank and the
bodies.''
   McCaleb said the blast involved two tanks, both of which
collected wastewater and some chemicals from the plant. The
material is pumped from one tank to another before it is disposed
of.
   A vacuum truck, of the sort used to remove wastes, was in the
area of the tanks where the explosion occurred but it not
immediately known if it had anything to do with the accident,
McCaleb said. One body was discovered in the cab of the truck,
officials said.
   Kathryn Cox, a member of the plant cleaning crew, said she and
several fellow workers had just finished their jobs when they heard
the blast.
   ``We didn't look back,'' she said. ``We just started running and
we just kept running.''
   ``We just heard a big explosion and everybody said `Run!' and we
all took off,'' Marlene Viscus said.
   The plant, about 15 miles east of Houston, was shut down today.
   Initially, authorities had described the blast and fire as
relatively minor and said no injuries were reported. Shortly after
midnight, Ms. Ragsdale had said that the plant's own firefighters
were putting out the fire and added: ``It's not really a big fire.''
   The blast is the second major loss of life at a Houston-area
petrochemical plant in the past nine months. On Oct. 23, a Phillips
Petroleum Co. plastics plant in nearby Pasadena was hit by series
of explosions that killed 23 workers and injured 130.
   On June 8, two people were injured in an explosion and fire at a
chemical packaging plant in Pearland, south of Houston.
   The Arco plant at Channelview has been in operation since 1977
and was acquired by Arco three years later.
   It annually produces 560 million pounds of propylene oxide, a
substance used to make foam for seat cushions and bedding and used
in cleaning compounds, according to a company brochure distributed
to reporters at the scene.
   In addition, the plant annually makes 1.3 billion pounds of
styrene monomer, which used for insulation, foam drinking cups,
packaging materials and a variety of automotive applications; and
1.7 billion pounds of methyl tertiary butyl ether, a high octane
blending component used as a replacement for lead in motor vehicle
fuel.

<HEAD>Pace of European Monetary Union Quickens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pace of European monetary union is quickening,
bringing closer the day Europe will have a single currency and a
``EuroFed,'' or central bank.
   The result could merge the 12-nation European Community into one
mighty economy with a currency rivaling the dollar in world
importance.
   The benefits are obvious: travelers no longer would have to
shuffle lire, pesetas, pounds, francs, guilders and crowns.
Businesses would be freed from the paperwork and costs linked to
fluctuating exchange rates.
   Although EC leaders have agreed to pursue economic and monetary
union, they now are engaged in an intense debate on how to go about
it.
   Major unresolved questions include whether the currency would be
a new monetary unit or a modification of an existing currency;
whether it would replace all 12 Common Market currencies or become
a 13th, parallel currency; and how much power a central monetary
body would have.
   ``The momentum has considerably increased,'' Bertrand de
Maigret, secretary general of the Paris-based Association for the
Monetary Union of Europe, said in an interview.
   Just a year ago, ``people did not dare talk about a single
currency,'' he said. ``But now the discussion is full and open.''
   The July 1 monetary unification of the Germanys and the collapse
of communism in Eastern Europe have spurred monetary integration,
experts say.
   Another boost came last month when Britain dropped its adamant
opposition and made a counter-proposal to the main monetary union
plan mapped out by EC Commission President Jacques Delors.
   Experts now say monetary union could happen by the mid-1990s.
   Peter Ludlow, head of the Center for European Policy Studies, a
think tank in Brussels, said use of a single European currency
could spread to Eastern Europe and possibly the Soviet Union.
   ``The dominance of the dollar would be called into question,''
he said in an interview.
   Karl Otto Poehl, president of the German Bundesbank, or central
bank, said in London on July 3 that he believed EC leaders already
had reached loose agreement that monetary unity is desirable.
   A ``decision has already been taken to aim for such change,''
Poehl said, citing an agreement by EC leaders in June to discuss
such matters at an intergovernmental conference in December.
   However, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who strongly opposes
giving up the pound and relinquishing control over Britain's
monetary affairs, subsequently insisted on retaining the right to
keep Britain out of any full monetary union.
   Delors has proposed a three-stage approach: removing trade
barriers and bringing all 12 EC countries into the
currency-stabilizing Exchange Rate Mechanism; a transitional
period; then full monetary union. He has set no timetable.
   Britain says it is committed to the first stage and to the EC's
plan to remove trade barriers by the end of 1992 and create one
marketplace of 320 million people.
   Britain, Portugal and Greece presently are outside the Exchange
Rate Mechanism.
   Delors advocates using the European Currency Unit, or ECU, a
10-year-old instrument made up of a basket of European currencies,
to replace the existing currencies. The ECU already exists but is
used mostly for accounting among countries.
   Poehl said the German mark or some other common currency must be
at the core of any eventual monetary unity and that the ``EuroFed''
should control its exchange rates.
   While he said West Germany might agree to give up the use of the
mark under such a plan, he rejected the ECU as a substitute.
   West Germany also has suggested two-speed monetary union under
which it would join France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg
in moving quickly toward monetary union, while other EC nations
come in later. Delors rejects this.
   Britain made its counter-proposal on June 21, calling for the
current ECU to be turned into a hard currency to be used alongside
the existing 12.
   A new institution called the European Monetary Fund would swap
new ECU bank notes for European currencies, thus minimizing any
threat of inflation from pumping out new money. The ECU would not
be allowed to devaluate against other EC currencies.
   ``In the very long term, if peoples and governments so choose,
it could develop into a single currency,'' says Britain's top
treasury official, Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major.
   Delors and Poehl said the idea should be studied, but continued
to press their own positions.
   One possibility is that the British plan might become a phase
toward full monetary union.

   Air France was forced to cancel more than 60
flights Friday because of a strike by ground personnel at Charles
de Gaulle airport outside Paris.
   The strike for higher wages and better working conditions by
hundreds of baggage handlers, hostesses and agents began a day
after the end of a disruptive three-day strike by Paris-area air
traffic controllers.
   Air France, which initially said the new strike would cause only
minor disruptions, admitted its problems turned out to be severe.
It cancelled about half its flights in and out of Charles de
Gaulle, including about 50 medium-range flights and a dozen
long-range flights.
   The strike is scheduled to end at midday Saturday, and the
state-owned airline said it expected to be able to operate all of
its long-range flights that day except one from Paris to Dakar,
Senegal. It cancelled 14 medium-range flights Saturday.
   Most of the flights cancelled Friday were to European cities
including London, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Geneva, which Air France
serves with numerous flights each day. It maintained service to
these cities on a reduced basis.

<TEXT>
   Average prices for 17 models of 1991
Volkswagen cars and vans will be about 2 percent higher than for
1990 versions of the same vehicles, the automaker said Friday.
   Volkswagen United States Inc., a U.S. marketing arm for
Volkswagen AG of West Germany, said its 1991 base prices will range
from $8,895 for the two-door Golf car to $26,085 for the Camper GL
Syncro van.
   Prices for '90 versions of the same vehicles ranged from $8,695
to $25,575. In late 1989, Volkswagen cut base prices of its cars
between 6.7 percent and 26.6 percent.
   Prices for other 1991 Volkswagen vehicles will be announced
later, the company said.

<HEAD>Beer Industry Tries to Mobilize Opposition to Beer Tax Hike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beer drinkers are being enlisted in the brewing
industry's lobbying effort against potential attempts to hike the
federal excise tax on beer.
   Beer company employees and distributors also have been asked to
let Congress know about their oppostion to a beer tax hike while
lawmakers were home for Independence Day parades and other
festivities.
   The lobbying offensive comes even though no specific proposal to
boost the excise tax on beer has been offered.
   But brewers, who already have been under attack in the nation's
capital for questionable marketing tactics, are fearful that beer
will prove a handy target for lawmakers struggling to balance the
federal budget.
   ``When they talk about taxes, the first thing they talk about
are alcohol taxes,'' said Jeff Becker, a spokesman for the Beer
Institute, a trade group.
   Brewers say an increase in the tax on beer unfairly would hit
middle- and low-income families because they drink most beer.
   The federal excise tax on beer amounts to $9 a barrel or about
16 cents for a six-pack. The federal rate has not been changed
since 1951 although state rates have been raised.
   Industry executives expect proposals may be made to double the
federal excise tax on beer. The Beer Institute estimates doubling
the federal tax would cut beer sales volume by 4 percent at retail.
   The beer industry sold 188 million barrels of beer in 1989, and
expectations are that sales will rise less than 1 percent this
year. Annual sales growth has been averaging 0.6 pecent to 0.7
percent a year for the past five years, the institute said.
   The largest brewer, Anheuser-Busch Cos., recently distributed
petitions to its 960 wholesalers, which it encouraged to gather
thousands of signatures from people who want lawmakers to ``Can the
Beer Tax.''
   Signatures were collected over the past week at concerts and
festivals in several Texas cities. Also this past week, the
Connecticut beer wholesaler association hired a plane to carry a
banner with the ``Can the Beer Tax'' slogan along the coast.
   Anheuser-Busch is considering developing radio and newspaper ads
that would use the same theme.
   Company Chairman August A. Busch III encouraged employees last
month to buttonhole legislators on the tax issue while the
lawmakers were in their home districts for the July 4th holiday and
to send letters to their Washington offices so they would be
reminded of those views when they returned.
   ``The next several days are key,'' Busch wrote.
   Steven Forsyth, a spokesman for Miller Brewing Co. in Milwaukee,
said Miller sent letters and packets of information to its
employees and suppliers detailing the company's opposition to a
beer tax hike.
   He said they and the company's 700 distributors were also asked
``let congresspeople know that we believe excise taxes are unfair''
and will have little impact on closing the budget defiucit.
   On Monday, The Beer Institute plans to run ads in 65 newspapers
that will show a fancy diamond bracelet and a can of beer above the
headline ``You pay more excise tax on the beer.''
   The ad points out that federal excise taxes on luxury items such
as jewelry were eliminated while beer is taxed at three times the
rate of most other consumer goods.
   ``As one of America's 80 million beer drinkers, tell Congress
you don't mind paying your fair share of taxes. But enough is
enough,'' the ad says.
   The ads are being placed in areas represented by senators and
House members expected to be influential in the upcoming talks
between Congress and the White House on a deficit reduction plan.
   The ads list a toll-free telephone number and the institute
plans to send letters under the caller's name to his or her
legislator, expressing opposition to any hike in the beer tax.
   In his letter to Anheuser-Busch employees, Busch warned a beer
tax increase would hurt the company and the industry for years to
come.
   ``No one at Anheuser-Busch is against even-handed efforts to
curb the federal deficit. We are all willing to do our part. But
excise taxes are anything but even-handed,'' he wrote.

<HEAD>Former Sun-Times Publisher Buys 2 Reader-Written Magazines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Page Group Publishing Inc. has
purchased a pair of reader-written magazines in Beverly Hills and
Brentwood.
   Page Group, headed by former Chicago Sun-Times publisher Robert
E. Page, bought the Glendale News Press and the Costa Mesa-based
Orange Coast Daily Pilot last year.
   Page said Thursday he paid between $1 million and $2 million for
the Brentwood Bla-Bla and Beverly Hills, the Magazine, which are
distributed free.
   The Beverly Hills publication has a circulation of 65,000, the
West Los Angeles magazine 75,000, according to their founder and
former majority owner, Michael Lobkowicz.
   The magazines feature prose, artwork, poetry and reviews
submitted by readers, published virtually unedited. No payment is
given to the authors, who have included such well-known local
residents as Zsa Zsa Gabor, Kenny Rogers and Norman Lear.
   Page said he hoped to build a regional media company when he led
an investor group that purchased the Glendale and Costa Mesa papers
last year.
   He purchased the magazines from Metropolitan Media Inc. in West
Los Angeles. Lobkowicz will stay on as their publisher and there
are no plans to change the editorial content or the staff of 26
people, Page said.
   The Costa Mesa-based Page Group also owns weekly newspapers in
Huntington Beach, Burbank and La Canada Flintridge.
   Lobkowicz said a third magazine that he launched recently,
titled the Prince and the Bear, will be reformulated to appear as a
reader-written insert in Thursday editions of the Daily Pilot.

<HEAD>Governor Signs Interstate Banking Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis signed a law Friday that
will open Massachusetts' borders to banks from other regions while
trying to combat racial bias in lending.
   The bill ``not only guarantees that every bank in the
commonwealth meets the needs of all its customers, but encourages
those banks to compete in both national and international financial
markets,'' Dukakis said.
   Interstate banking has been billed as a potential boon to the
slumping state economy, as more out-of-state banks could bring new
capital to Massachusetts.
   But analysts and representatives of the banking industry said
Friday they did not expect immediate changes.
   ``I don't see any rush to come here,'' said James Moynihan, a
banking analyst with Advest Inc. ``The profitability (of New
England banks) is very poor. The companies are not very sought
after for now.''
   Nonetheless, Robert Sheridan of the Massachusetts Bankers
Association said it was important for Massachusetts to make this
move. Currently, 26 states allow national interstate banking, and
seven more are scheduled to join the ranks within two years,
according to the bankers association.
   Until now, Massachusetts allowed interstate banking only on a
regional basis. The bill will take effect in 60 days, but banks can
opt out of the provisions until July 1, 1992, if two-thirds of the
board of directors agree.
   The community reinvestment provisions of the law will require
the state to publicize the ratings banks receive based on their
lending to minorities and low-income people.

<HEAD>Dollar Finishes Mixed In U.S. Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished mixed on domestic currency
markets Friday after closing higher overseas following the release
of a better-than-expected U.S. unemployment report.
   Gold prices also ended mixed. On New York's Commodity Exchange,
gold bullion for current delivery slipped 30 cents from late
Wednesday to settle at $361.10 a troy ounce. Republic National Bank
in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $360.20, down 30 cents.
   Despite a continuing slump in the nation's manufacturing and
construction sectors, the unemployment rate fell to 5.2 percent in
June from 5.3 percent the previous month, the Labor Department
reported.
   Many traders had expected unemployment to shoot up as high as
5.5 percent, a move that could have encouraged the Federal Reserve
to ease interest rates to stimulate a flagging economy.
   The report, however, ``dispelled some anticipation that the Fed
might ease,'' said Ronald Holzer, chief dealer at Harris Trust and
Savings Bank in Chicago. Higher interest rates make
dollar-denominated securities more attractive, and thereby enhance
foreign investors' needs for dollars to buy debt instruments.
   Non-farm payrolls increased by 40,000 jobs in June, far lower
than market expectations. But Linda McLaughlin, a trader at
Chemical New York Capital Markets Group, said the fact that the
overall unemployment rate fell generated enough interest in the
dollar to override the impact of the payroll figure.
   The dollar rose overseas but turned mixed when trading shifted
to the United States. Dealers said, however, that the
much-anticipated employment report failed to move the market
significantly, and activity was relatively thin.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 150.95 yen, down 0.05 yen from
Thursday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted higher at
151.00 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 151.70 yen, up from
150.57 yen on Thursday.
   The British pound rose to $1.7865 from late Thursday's $1.7795.
In New York one pound cost $1.7865, more expensive than $1.7815 on
Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's
late rates included: 1.6515 West German marks, down from 1.6517;
1.3983 Swiss francs, down from 1.3998; 5.5435 French francs, up
from 5.5430; 1,211.50 Italian lire, unchanged; and 1.1619 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1640.
   Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with Thursday's late
rates included: 1.6540 German marks, up from 1.6497; 1.4005 Swiss
francs, up from 1.3990; 5.5515 French francs, up from 5.5357;
1.8595 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8582; 1,213.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,210.25; and 1.1630 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1627.
   Gold in London was quoted at a late price of $361.25 a troy
ounce, up from $359.75 late Thursday. In Zurich, gold was quoted at
$361.25, up from $359.50. Gold in Hong Kong dropped 21 cents a troy
ounce Friday, to close at $361.26.
   Silver prices were little changed. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery settled at $4.866 a troy ounce, down
from Thursday's $4.869. In London the metal was unchanged at $4.88
an ounce.

<HEAD>Oregon Business, Civic Leader Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harold S. Hirsch, who founded White Stag
Manufacturing Co. and was a prominent Portland civic leader and
philanthropist, has died in his home. He was 82.
   Hirsch served as a trustee of Reed College from 1956 until his
death from cancer Wednesday.
   The Japanese Garden in Washington Park plans a living memorial
to Hirsch, the Mountain View Garden, which will overlook the city
and Mount Hood.
   ``He was a very dedicated person to the city of Portland,'' said
Miles Englehart, president of the Japanese Garden Society, where
Hirsch was a longtime board member. ``He used to call me all the
time about the garden, even in his last few days.''
   Hirsch was a trail blazer in the manufacture of outdoor clothing.
   In 1929, he used a corner of his family's Hirsch-Weis Co.
factory and a couple of its sewing machines to begin making apparel
for downhill skiing, a sport then in its infancy in the United
States.
   He had learned to ski on Mount Rainier in Washington and in the
hills of New Hampshire, while attending Dartmouth College. He also
attended England's Oxford University.
   His venture grew into a division of his family's company and
became known as White Stag. From ski wear, it branched into a broad
line of casual sportswear. It expanded from its Portland base to
include plants in the South and East and international joint
ventures.
   He was a pioneer in racially integrating his manufacturing
plants in the South and in Portland during World War II.
   Hirsch headed a National Alliance of Businessmen's program to
spur the hiring of minority workers.
   He was also a strong supporter of higher education. In addition
to the Reed board, he was a member of the University of Oregon
College of Business Administration Advisory Board. He served six
years on the university's School of Law's Board of Visitors and was
vice president of the Dartmouth College alumni association.
   He served as president of the Port of Portland Commission and on
the citizens' advisory committee for Portland's downtown plan.
   He is a member of the U.S. Ski Hall of Fame.

   Oil prices wound up a slow week with mostly
minor changes Friday as crude kept to a tight trading range.
   Volume was extremely light because many market participants took
an extended break after the Independence Day holiday on Wednesday.
   Reports of renewed output disruptions due to an illegal strike
by Norwegian oil workers initially inspired crude buying in the
energy futures pits on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   But the rally fizzled after it became apparent that the bulk of
Norway's oil production was resuming.
   Wholesale gasoline prices firmed on speculation that an
explosion and fire at an Arco Chemical Co. plant in Texas could
cause a temporary shortage in a gas additive. The plant makes an
additive used to upgrade gas to premium.
   The contract for August delivery of West Texas Intermediate
dipped 3 cents to $16.47 per 42-gallon barrel, after slumping 30
cents Thursday. Contracts for delivery during September through
November also posted modest losses.
   Unleaded gasoline for August delivery rose 0.46 cent to 55.41
cents a gallon after sliding 1.14 cents Thursday. The contracts for
delivery through November also settled higher.
   Among other refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale
home heating oil for August delivery settled at 48.30 cents a
gallon, off 0.03 cent. The contract ended down 0.13 cent on
Thursday. The September through November contracts finished mixed.
   In natural gas trading, the August contract fell to $1.498 per
1,000 cubic feet from $1.514 Thursday.
   Energy broker Andrew Lebow at E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures
Inc. said no clear price patterns emerged Friday _ or the entire
week _ because activity was so sluggish.
   He said the Arco chemical plant fire in Channelview, Texas,
tended to encourage buying of premium gas on the Gulf Coast.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices plunged for the second straight
day Friday as more weather forecasters predicted ideal weather next
week for Midwestern crop development and winter wheat harvesting.
   On other commodity markets, pork futures fell sharply; copper
futures climbed; precious metals slipped; and energy futures were
mixed.
   On the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat futures settled 5{ cents to
10 cents lower with the contract for delivery in July at $3.09\ a
bushel; corn was 3{ cents to 8\ cents lower with July at $2.80 a
bushel; oats were 4{ cents to 5 cents lower with July at $1.31 a
bushel; soybeans were 8 cents to 10} cents lower with July at $6.19
a bushel.
   The sell-off extended Thursday's steep losses in the corn and
soybean markets as it triggered waves of selling by speculators.
   Earlier this week, some private forecasters were predicting hot,
dry weather for the western and southern reaches of the Corn Belt.
   But by Friday, ``they're all saying the weather's going to be
mild with good rain in the next week or so, and that is the ball
game,'' said Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice president in the
grain trading division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   After the close, the National Weather Service issued a new
six-to-10-day forecast predicting normal temperatures and rainfall
in the Midwest during the period July 12-16.
   The corn crop is nearing its pollination phase, when heat and
dryness could reduce yields.
   ``If you don't get a drought at this time of year, it means the
corn crop generally will be developing under favorable
conditions,'' said Katharina Zimmer, a grains analyst with Merrill
Lynch Capital Markets Inc.
   The forecasts contained nothing that would adversely affect
soybeans, which reach their pollination phase in August.
   And the relatively dry conditions expected in the Great Plains
should allow winter wheat harvesting to accelerate.
   Pork futures tumbled on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on
selling linked to recent high hog slaughter figures and sluggish
retail demand, especially for bacon.
   The Agriculture Department's hog slaughter estimates of 293,000
head Thursday and 285,000 Friday were both about 15,000 head higher
than market expectations. The high slaughter rates have increased
supplies of all pork, including the bellies from which bacon is
made.
   The heavy slaughter is not alarming but ``it's enough to put
people on edge,'' said Dale Durchholz, an analyst with AgriVisor
Services Inc. in Bloomington, Ill.
   Cattle futures were boosted in part by expectations for rising
retail demand for beef.
   Live cattle settled .12 cent to .63 cent higher with August at
73.65 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to .80 cent higher
with August at 84.55 cents a pound; live hogs were .28 cent to 1.25
cents higher with July at 61.60 cents a pound; frozen bellies for
July and August delivery fell the permitted daily limit of 2 cents
a pound with July settling at 54.17 cents. Other belly contracts
were .10 cent lower to .43 cent higher.
   Copper futures settled 0.7 cent to 2.5 cents higher on New
York's Commodity Exchange, reflecting increasing worries about
supply availability.
   A strike at Asarco Inc.'s Ray copper mine in Arizona stretched
into its sixth day Friday. Futures also were supported by news that
production from the Chilean Copper Co.'s El Teniente mine would
drop by 18,000 metric tons this year due to a landslide Thursday.
   In precious metals trading on the Commodity Exchange, gold
futures settled 10 cents to 40 cents lower with August at $362.90 a
troy ounce; silver was 0.3 cent to 0.5 cent lower with July at
$4.866 a troy ounce.
   Petroleum futures were little changed on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 6 cents
lower with August at $16.47 a barrel; heating oil was .09 cent
lower to .06 cent higher with August at 48.30 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .20 cent to .46 cent higher with August at
55.41 cents a gallon.

   Stock prices gained ground Friday in the slowest
trading of the year, rebounding from Thursday's setback as traders
studied the latest data on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 25.74 to
2,904.95, finishing the week with a net gain of 24.26 points. The
average fell 32.42 points on Thursday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
851 up, 537 down and 566 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 111.73 million
shares, down from 128.32 million Thursday and the lightest total
since a 77.61 million-share day last Dec. 26.
   Analysts had expected a quiet session in the absence of many
traders who were taking time off after Independence Day on
Wednesday.
   The Labor Department reported that nonfarm payroll employment
increased by 40,000 in June.
   Employment data for the past few months have been skewed by
temporary hiring for the Census. But brokers said the June data
generally lived up to expectations.
   The figures were seen as confirming sluggish growth, at best, in
business activity _ while at the same time probably not signaling
enough weakness to prompt any immediate relaxation of the Federal
Reserve's credit policy.
   Eli Lilly rose \ to 86{ and Genentech gained { to 29{. A
research study published this week reported evidence that a growth
hormone produced by the companies can reverse some of the effects
of aging in older men.
   Elsewhere in the pharmaceutical sector, Abbott Laboratories rose
&rsqb; to 41|; Pfizer 1 to 65~; Rorer Group 1&rsqb; to 74, and Syntex 1\ to
60{.
   A broad range of consumer products issues also showed strength,
benefiting like the drug stocks from investors' search for
recession-resistant growth companies.
   General Mills advanced 1~ to 90{; CPC International 2{ to 82\;
Kimberly-Clark 3{ to 78\; Pepsico 2&lsqb; to 79~, and Philip Morris 1}
to 49\.
   Other gainers among the blue chips included Boeing, up 1\ at
60{; American Express, up { at 31~; Exxon, up 1 at 47}, and General
Electric, up &rsqb; at 70|.
   Mack Trucks, traded in the over-the-counter market, added 1\ to
6{. Renault of France, which owns about 44.5 percent of Mack,
announced plans to make a $6-a-share bid for the rest of the stock.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 134.04 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $21.46 billion, or

Friday.
   Joseph C. Farrell was elected president and chief operating
officer, and David L. Marshall was elected vice chairman, the
company said. Both had been executive vice presidents.
   Paul W. Douglas, chairman and chief executive officer, said the
promotions were part of the transition plan for his scheduled

   Pittston suffered a $10 million first quarter loss it blamed on
a 10-month coal miners' strike and by poor performance in its air

<HEAD>Texas Water Commission Recommends New Oil Spill Measures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Texas Water Commission recommended a
2-cent per barrel fee on crude oil moving through ports on the
state's Gulf Coast.
   The money would help pay for cleanups of future oil spills.
   The fee would be charged until the balance in the Texas Spill
Response Fund is raised from $750,000 to $50 million. The levy
would be applied as needed to maintain that balance, the commission
said.
   Approximately 560 million barrels of crude oil pass through
oil-loading facilities by tanker along the Texas Gulf Coast every
year, the commission said. It said the fee would raise more than
$11 million per year.
   Since several oil and chemical companies have large plants in
both Texas and Louisiana, the commission also said the new funding
mechanism should be coordinated with Louisiana. Otherwise, shippers
might go to Louisiana to avoid the fee.
   Interest and principal of the fund would be used to finance
standby oil spill response contracts and state-owned equipment
stockpiles.
   The money also could pay for a research and development program
for new oil spill technology, such as the bioremediation used in
the Mega Borg spill.
   In that process, bacteria was used to eat the oil and turn it
into a fatty acid that could be consumed by marine life.

<HEAD>Money Supply Measures Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two measures of the nation's money supply rose
in late June while a broader money measure fell, the Federal
Reserve Board reported Friday.
   In a report delayed by one day due to the Independence Day
holiday, the Fed said the narrowest measure of the money supply,
M1, rose $1.3 billion to a seasonally adjusted $808.8 billion in
the week ended June 25 from a revised $807.5 billion in the
previous week.
   The central bank said a measure known as M2 advanced $1 billion
to a seasonally adjusted $3,270.5 billion from $3,269.5 billion the
previous week.
   But an even broader measure, M3, dropped $4.1 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $4,053.9 billion from $4,058.0 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 4.4 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 was 1.7 percent, which is below the
Fed's target range of 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,267.3 billion, a 3.4
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,060.5 billion, up 0.5 percent, while M1
rose 3.4 percent to an average of $806.8 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major banks fell 1.3 billion in the week ended
June 27, compared with a gain of $1.01 billion a week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $430 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$420 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged $640
million in the latest two weeks, up from $265 million in the
previous two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $306.9 billion in the two-week period ended
June 27, down from $309.0 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Shearson To Pay Record NYSE Fine To Settle Stock Trading
Allegations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. has agreed to pay
the New York Stock Exchange a $500,000 fine to settle allegations
that it violated exchange rules in buying E.F. Hutton &amp; Co. stock
in 1986, the NYSE said Friday.
   Shearson agreed to pay the fine without admitting or denying
wrongdoing, the NYSE said.
   Shearson acquired a 4.9 percent stake in Hutton in 1986, then
sold the shares that October after the management of the troubled
brokerage rejected a Shearson takeover overture. Shearson, then
known as Shearson Lehman Brothers, succeeded in acquiring Hutton
the following year.
   According to the NYSE, Shearson violated exchange rules by
failing to announce on the exchange floor as it bought the Hutton
shares that they were intended for Shearson's own account, as
opposed to a customer's account.
   NYSE rules require that any brokerage that is an exchange member
must announce when it is buying shares for its own account. The
rules also require that orders from the public to purchase stock in
the same company take priority over a brokerage's order for its own
account.
   The NYSE said in its disciplinary action that ``on at least
three occasions, the Shearson floor broker failed to yield priority
to public orders for purchases of shares of Hutton.''
   The NYSE also criticized the manner in which Shearson sold its
Hutton stake.
   Shearson sold a third of its stake on Oct. 15, 1986, the same
day Hutton management privately rejected Shearson's takeover offer.
The next day, Hutton announced publicly that it was not engaged in
any acquisition discussions with any party, causing Hutton's stock
price to plunge in heavy trading.
   The exchange said neither Shearson nor Hutton ever stated
publicly that they were involved in takeover talks.
   While it did not allege that Shearson violated NYSE rules in
selling the stake, the exchange said Shearson consented to findings
that it ``engaged in conduct inconsistent with just and equitable
principles of trade, and-or engaged in acts detrimental to the
interest or welfare of the exchange.''
   The sale of the stake, which was concluded over three days,
coincided with heavy, volatile trading in Hutton stock fed by
rumors that other companies were interested in taking over the
brokerage.
   In addition to paying the fine, Shearson agreed to retain a
special lawyer for three years to advise the brokerage on laws and
regulations it must follow in trading stock for its own account.
   ``We determined to settle now rather than go through protracted
litigation,'' said Mike O'Neill, a vice president and spokesman for
Shearson, whose majority owner is American Express Co.
   Sharon Gamsin, an NYSE spokeswoman, said the fine was a record
for the exchange.
   With respect to the sale of its Hutton stake, O'Neill said,
``Shearson didn't violate any law or existing interpretation of
exchange rules.''
   In determining Shearson's penalty, the NYSE said it considered
that Shearson consulted with lawyers before selling its Hutton
stake.
   In addition, after exchange officials questioned Shearson's
purchase of Hutton shares, Shearson took steps to educate its
employees about exchange rules pertaining to purchases for its own
account, the NYSE said. The exchange also said Shearson took that
action before it learned it was under investigation for its
accumulation of Hutton stock.
   The exchange rules cited in the disciplinary action are based on
federal laws governing stock trading, raising the possibility that
Shearson could face legal sanctions.
   It could not be determined whether the Securities and Exchange
Commission was investigating Shearson over the Hutton stock
accumulation. The SEC does not comment on its investigtions.
   However, a Wall Street source close to the case, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the SEC was not believed to be
investigating Shearson.

<HEAD>Renault Seeks to Buy Mack Trucks Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mack Trucks Inc. Chairman Ralph E. Reins
said Friday a plan by Renault Vehicules Industriels to buy out
Mack's remaining outstanding shares is essential to the truck
manufacturing company.
   Mack announced Friday that Renault, which holds about 44.5
percent of outstanding shares of the American firm, wants to buy
all remaining shares at $6 a share.
   The deal, if Renault succeeds, would be worth about $98.7
million.
   Reins, who was attending a Mack board meeting in France, told
employees he views Renault's tender offer ``to be a very positive
development,'' according to Mack spokesman James Santanasto.
   Renault's financial and operational support is ``crucial to the
survival of Mack,'' Reins said.
   New York business analyst Charles Harris of Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
said Mack had been in ``a downward spiral in the last 10 years,''
and said he did not think Mack could survive as an independent
company.
   ``This company is dying on the vine and has to do something,''
Harris said.
   Mack shares closed at $6.50 in over-the-counter trading Friday,
up from $5.25 on Thursday.
   Santanasto said Renault now owns 13.25 million shares of Mack's
29.7 million outstanding shares and has warrants for an additional
5 million.
   Renault, which said it would make its offer July 12, also has
$50 million worth of convertible debentures. If exercised and
converted with the warrant, the French firm's ownership would
increase to about 61.1 percent.
   The Renault offer expires Aug. 9 and is conditioned on enough
shares being tendered to boost its interest in Mack Trucks to at
least 90 percent of the truck manufacturer's shares.
   Renault said it was making the offer ``because of the continuing
deterioration of the financial condition of Mack'' and the need to
restructure the company's debt.
   Mack, which lost a record $185.4 million last year and $33.9
million in the first quarter of 1990, said it expects a net loss of
about $90 million for the six months ended June 30.
   The Mack board, which includes four representatives of Renault,
Friday approved a five-year business plan which projects a net loss
of about $130 million for the year ending Dec. 31, 1990.
   In a news release, Mack officials said they do not expect the
company to show a profit before 1992.
   Mack officials said the company would probably default on its
consolidated, three-year revolving bank loans with Citibank of New
York and Credit Lyonnais of France after its second-quarter results
are announced.
   Mack Truck's subsidiary, Mack Financial Corp., has obtained a
two-week extension and is seeking a long-term extension of the July
8 maturity date of its $350 million revolving credit agreement with
Chemical Bank.
   In the past year, Mack had tried to reduce business costs and
conserve cash amid a slowing market for heavy trucks.
   The effort to stem the company's failing fortunes included the
resignation of John Curcio as chairman last October when Mack
announced it expected to lose $50 million in the third quarter _ a
figure eventually reported at $87.5 million.
   Curcio was replaced by Reins, who had predicted that 1990 would
be a ``transitional year'' for the manufacturer.
   The company's 1989 net sales totalled $1.75 billion, 17 percent
lower than 1988 net sales of $2.1 billion.
   In June, analysts predicted that Mack's options to save itself
from bankruptcy could include closing plants in Winnsboro and
Hagerstown, Md., but Santanasto said Friday there were no such
plans.

<HEAD>Texas Fugitive Held in Barbados</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former insurance executive accused of
defrauding companies and policyholders of more than $50 million has
been arrested in his Barbados hideaway and Texas officials have
moved to freeze his assets there.
   The State Board of Insurance said Friday that Robert Walker is
facing court action to impound his holdings in Barbados, where he
was seized by local police two days earlier on a U.S. warrant.
   Walker's assets in Barbados could be used for the benefit of
Texas policyholders, creditors and taxpayers, the State Board of
Insurance said.
   In Barbados, police spokesman David Bourne said said Walker, 60,
was seized at a resort hotel on the Caribbean island where he has
been living for the past three months.
   Walker is wanted in connection with the multimillion-dollar
collapse of his Dallas-based National County Mutual Fire Insurance
Co.
   National County Mutual, a property-casualty insurer, was more
than $50 million in debt by the time it was taken over by the State
Board of Insurance in October 1988, Texas authorities said.
   ``One of our primary concerns is to enforce the $55 million
judgment ... obtained against Mr. Walker in February 1989,'' said
board Chairman James Saxton Jr.
   Thus far, board liquidator Stephen Durish has recovered
approximately $2 million in assets belonging to Walker and National
County Mutual, the board said in a statement.
   A federal grand jury in Dallas indicted Walker June 12 on 29
felony counts charging he devised a scheme to defraud the insurance
companies and their policyholders in 1987 and 1988. He is also
charged with selling policies at a time when the companies did not
have the means to pay claims.
   If convicted, Walker faces a maximum penalty of 145 years in
prison and a $7.25 million fine, and he could be ordered to pay
restitution.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Plunge on Unemployment News</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government bond prices plunged Friday on news
that the nation's unemployment rate dropped in June, making it
unlikely that the Federal Reserve will ease interest rates in the
near future.
   The Treasury's key 30-year bond fell 1&lsqb; point, or $11.25 per
$1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which rises when the price falls,
increased to 8.50 percent from 8.40 percent late Thursday.
   Traders bid bond prices lower in reaction to the Labor
Department's monthly unemployment report, which showed that the
nation's jobless rate fell last month to 5.2 percent from 5.3
percent in May.
   William Sullivan, director of money market research for Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc., said the report ``showed a bit more buoyancy
in the labor force than the market had anticipated.''
   News of a stronger economy makes it less likely that the Federal
Reserve will lower interest rates. Lower rates benefit fixed-return
investments such as bonds.
   Gib Clark, chief bond trader for Daiwa Securities Inc., said the
unemployment report capped a week of figures that were
disappointing to the bond market, including a report showing auto
sales were stronger than expected.
   ``It kind of scotches the thought of Fed easing,'' he said.
   In addition, Sullivan said, the bond market is under price
pressure as it faces the auctions of several major new bond issues
next week, including $5 billion worth of 30-year bonds by the
Resolution Funding Corp., the federal agency that raises money for
the savings-and-loan bailout.
   Bond prices often soften temporarily as the market anticipates
potential difficulty in digesting new issues.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments fell from 7-32 point to 15-32 point, intermediate
maturities fell from 19-32 point to 31-32 point, and long-term
issues fell up to 1&lsqb; points, according to Telerate Inc., a
financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 5.56 to 1,157.15.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8 percent as the
discount rose 9 basis points to 7.75 percent. Yields on six-month
bills rose to 8.08 percent as the discount rose 10 basis points to
7.67 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.13 percent as the
discount rose 12 basis points to 7.57 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8\ percent, up from 8
percent late Thursday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 3-16 point to 91 27-32. The average
yield to maturity rose to 7.47 percent from 7.45 percent late
Tuesday.

<HEAD>Seize $3.15 Million Said Taken Illegally From Failed Thrift</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARLINGEN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agents have seized $3.15 million
that the president of a failed savings and loan allegedly removed
from the thrift after it was taken over by the government's
Resolution Trust Corp.
   An assistant U.S. attorney said Friday it was the first time the
government has made such a seizure under a law designed to prevent
misuse of money from failed thrifts.
   But no charges were filed against the thrift official, who said
the transaction was legal.
   The U.S. attorney's office in Houston on Monday filed a civil
forfeiture complaint in U.S. District Court to seize the money.
   It alleges that Joe G. Garza, then-president of McAllen-based
Valley Federal Savings Association, illegally removed the money
from Valley Federal after it failed Oct. 19, 1989, said Assistant
U.S. Attorney Mike Clark of Houston.
   Garza, however, said he transferred the account and several
others to various institutions with the approval of the RTC and the
Office of Thrift Supervision in Dallas.
   ``They were fully aware of what we were doing,'' Garza said
Friday. ``They encouraged it. They did not want us to have any
accounts that were uninsured.''
   No charges were filed against Garza.
   The complaint alleges that Garza transferred the $3.15 million
to the NCNB Texas bank in Harlingen, where federal agents this week
seized it, Clark said. The money was a certificate of deposit in
the name of Inversiones Sagomar Inc., believed to be a Panamanian
corporation, the federal prosecutor said.
   Clark said the account seizure, completed Thursday, was the
federal government's first under the Financial Institution Reform
Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989. The act allows for the
forfeiture of funds misappropriated by employees of savings
institutions which have been taken over by the RTC.
   Garza apparently was trying to protect the money from forfeiture
to the RTC, the federal corporation formed to sell assets from
failed S&amp;L's in its effort to bail out the troubled industry, Clark
said. The RTC is a branch of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The countries with the biggest
economies in South America, Brazil and Argentina, will remove all
barriers to bilateral trade by Dec. 31, 1994, presidents Fernando
Collor de Melo and Carlos Menem said Friday.
   Trade between the two countries amounted to $2 billion in 1989,
with Argentina posting a $401 million surplus. Bilateral trade in
1988 totaled $1.7 billion, with Brazil posting a $364 million
surplus.
   Trade currently is regulated by lists of products that are
subject to quotas and tariffs. During the next four years, the
quotas and tariffs gradually are to be reduced.
   Important items include agricultural products such as rice,
beans, powdered milk, apples and peaches; and industrial products
such as cars and automobile parts.
   Among two dozen protocols signed by the presidents, each nation
stipulated it may send up to 10,000 cars to the other next year.
Tariff-free trade in the automobile sector was projected at $300
million in 1991 and $500 million in 1992, after which tariffs would
be removed altogether.
   The ``common market'' between the neighboring countries and
long-time rivals was suggested in 1986 by then presidents Raul
Alfonsin of Argentina and Jose Sarney of Brazil. Both were present
with Menem and Collor de Melo, whose terms run through 1994.

<HEAD>British Airways Orders Up to 33 Boeing 747s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The day after learning a potentially huge
aircraft purchase had been put on hold, Boeing Co. was soothed
Friday by its fourth-largest order ever, a deal for up to 33 747
jumbo jets for British Airways PLC.
   The order, potentially worth $6.9 billion, was the biggest-ever
investment in new planes by London-based British Airways, which
said it needed extra passenger capacity as well as replacements for
older jets.
   The airline also said it had negotiated the right to buy a
larger airplane that Boeing hasn't even decided to develop.
   British Airways said it placed firm orders for 21 Boeing
747-400s, the world's largest passenger jet, for 2.33 billion
pounds, the equivalent of $4.15 billion. It took options to buy 12
more for 1.55 billion pounds, or $2.8 billion.
   In doing so, it joined a growing number of carriers ordering
aircraft nearly a decade in advance to ensure they will have enough
passenger seats during the early 21st century.
   ``All they're doing is protecting their position in terms of
requirements. They didn't want to be last in the queue,'' said Dan
White, an analyst with the London investment firm County Natwest
Woodmac.
   The announcement came as Boeing increased its forecast of work
force reductions this year in Washington state, where most of its
plants are located. Boeing said about 5,600 jobs would be cut this
year, 600 more than its January estimate, mostly because of
uncertainties in defense contracts.
   Boeing currently has 103,800 workers in Washington and 161,000
worldwide.
   British Airways is to receive the first of its new planes in
1992 and the 21st in 1999, bringing its 747-400 fleet to 42
aircraft.
   The company has bought 21 747-400s since 1986 and operates 224
airplanes in all.
   ``The aircraft will provide extra capacity as well as allowing
us to replace older Boeing 747 equipment,'' British Airways
Chairman Lord King said. ``Our 747-400s are delivering good
performance and proving popular with intercontinental passengers.''
   UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines, had been expected to
announce within the next few weeks the largest commercial jet
purchase ever, possibly to include Boeing's proposed new 777
widebody.
   However, the employees' group seeking to buy UAL and the
corporation's board of directors announced Thursday that talks with
aircraft manufacturers had been suspended until the employee group
could secure loans for the buyout.
   UAL directors said the aircraft negotiations are on hold until
Aug. 9, the deadline for the employees to secure buyout financing.
   Boeing's largest-ever firm order for aircraft was a $9.4 billion
deal for 182 planes by Irish leasing company GPA Ltd. in April
1989. A week later, United placed the second-largest, ordering 180
planes worth $7.1 billion.
   So far this year, Boeing has anounced orders for 240 aircraft,
worth a total $25.3 billion. Its firm-order backlog is for more
than 1,700 aircraft.
   British Airways' order was the third multibillion-dollar
purchase of 747-400s in as many months. Japan Airlines ordered 20
planes for $3.1 billion in May, and Korean Air ordered 23 more for
$4.8 billion in June. Both those carriers also said they needed
more capacity, and likewise are to receive the last of their new
planes at the end of the 1990s.
   King said British Airways obtained the right to convert any of
the orders if Boeing develops a larger version of the 747.
   ``Although no details have been confirmed, we envisage that new
747 variants could provide passenger capacities between 450 and 600
seats,'' he said.
   Boeing executives have conjectured that in the late 1990s, the
company could build a ``747 super.'' The plane would be
significantly larger than the model 400, which can carry 412
passengers more than 8,000 miles, and more than 560 in short-range
versions.
   However, company officials have made no decision on whether to
build such a plane and offered no specifics on how large it might
be.
   ``There's nothing in the works at all,'' said John Wheeler,
spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplane Group in Seattle.
   He said the conversion options negotiated by British Airways are
``just insurance on the part of the airline'' in case Boeing does
come up with another jet.
   Rolls-Royce PLC won the $1.07 billion contract for the 747
engines. Rolls-Royce spokesman Dick Dalton in Reston, Va., said the
deal was for 160 RB211-524G engines, including spares.
   British Airways also said it would begin a 30 million pound, or
$53 million, refurbishment program for its existing 747-100s, which
eventually will be replaced by the new jets.
   The airline did not say how it would pay for its new airplanes.
Analysts said they expected the airline to own some of the
aircraft, and obtain leases on others to contain costs.

   The nation's unemployment rate edged downward
to 5.2 percent last month despite an ongoing slide in manufacturing
and overall weakness in job growth, the government reported.
   Fewer Americans looking for work _ not any rebound in sluggish
economic activity _ accounted for the improvement over May's
jobless rate of 5.3 percent, analysts said Friday.
   The economy added just 40,000 jobs to non-farm payrolls in June,
the Labor Department said.

   NEW YORK (AP) _ Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. has agreed to pay
the New York Stock Exchange a record $500,000 fine to settle
allegations that it violated exchange rules in buying E.F. Hutton &amp;
Co. stock in 1986, the NYSE said.
   Shearson agreed to pay the fine without admitting or denying
wrongdoing, the NYSE said Friday.
   According to the NYSE, Shearson violated exchange rules in 1986
by failing to announce on the exchange floor as it bought a 4.9
percent stake in Hutton that the shares were intended for
Shearson's own account, as opposed to a customer's account.

<HEAD>Raytheon Said to Lose $100 Million Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTSMOUTH, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Raytheon Corp. has lost its bid for a
$100 million contract that would have allowed it to enter the
lucrative international submarine electronics market, a Rhode
Island congresswoman said Friday.
   Rep. Claudine Schneider, R-R.I. said in a statement that
Raytheon had been notified it lost the contract.
   Raytheon had hoped the contract to build combat systems for two
Israeli diesel submarines would provide an entrance to the
submarine electronics market, estimated by some to be worth $1
billion. That would provide long-term work and job stability at a
time when Defense Department procurement budgets are shrinking.
   But the contract was awarded to Krupp Atlas Elektronik, a German
firm working in conjunction with Loral Corp. of Ohio, according to
sources in Washington and Portsmouth. Loral would perform about 60
percent of the work.
   According to a government official in Washington, the Israeli
government has asked that the contract be awarded to the
German-American venture.
   Raytheon officials were unavailable for comment Friday.
Spokesman Joseph DeBilio was not in the office late in the day.
   Raytheon, based in Lexington, Mass., is a conglomerate that
holds the fourth-largest share of U.S. defense contracts.
   It had courted the contract aggressively. Failure to win it
could mean major layoffs at the company's Submarine Signal Division
in Portsmouth as early as next week, according to a company source
cited in the Newport Daily News in Friday's editions. The facility
employs about 2,800.
   The awarding of the contract was complicated because the program
involves U.S. military aid to foreign nations, namely, Israel.
   Money given under the aid program is to be used exclusively for
U.S.- or Israeli-made arms. But because no U.S. shipyards make
diesel subs anymore, Israel was allowed to buy the subs from a West
Germany company.
   However, ``It would be unfair for Israel to pay for the German
portion of Krupps@Loral system with U.S. taxpayer dollars while
Raytheon could build the same system,'' Schneider said. ``This
approval would directly conflict with the stated policy.''
   Schneider said she wrote to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney Friday
asking him to withhold U.S. aid for the contract pending an
investigation.
   Rep. Ronald Machtley, R-R.I. said in June that Israel had asked
for a waiver of the aid program to purchase the German systems. An
Israeli spokeswoman denied that.
   At that time, Cheney said an exemption would not be granted. But
some officials, including Ohio Sen. John Glenn, a Democrat, had
wanted the German-American team to get the contract.

   Greyhound Dial Corp. has entered an interim
agreement with Greyhound Bus Lines to maintain uninterrupted
operation of the bus line while it is involved in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court proceedings.
   Under an agreement announced Thursday, Greyhound Lines will pay
Greyhound Dial rent for 15 bus terminals, a maintenance garage in
New York and about 2,000 buses leased or subleased to Greyhound
Lines.
   The agreement, filed with a bankruptcy court in Brownsville,
Texas, can be canceled by either party with 30 days' written notice.
   Phoenix-based Greyhound Dial sold the bus line in 1987 to a
Dallas-based investor group. Greyhound Dial still owns 22{ percent
of GLI Holdings, the parent company of Greyhound Lines.
   In June, the bus company sought federal protection under Chapter
11 while it reorganized. The filing came after Greyhound Lines
workers walked out in a labor action. The strike, started in March,
has not been resolved.

<TEXT>
   A jury on Friday watched a secretly made
videotape and listened to a taped phone conversation in the bribery
trial against the Rite Aid Corp. drugstore chain and its president,
Martin L. Grass.
   Grass, 36, is accused of offering $33,000 to a member of the
State Board of Pharmacy to step down from that post, thus creating
a spot the company could arrange to fill with someone more to its
liking.
   The pharmacy board member, Melvin Wilczynski, 61, testified that
he met with Grass in a Cleveland hotel room on April 27, 1989, and
spoke with the company president about signing one of six
resignation letters prepared by the company.
   The variously-worded letters were addressed to Ohio Gov. Richard
Celeste, who appoints the board members, said Wilczynski, who
remains on the board. Grass also handed him a corporate check for
$33,249, he testified.
   Wilczynski said he cooperated with Cuyahoga County authorities
and wore a surveillance wire while they filmed the meeting with a
hidden camera.
   The film showed Grass and Wilczynski leafing through papers. On
the tape, Wilczynski notes that there are several different
resignation letters. The two also speak about health insurance for
Wilczynski.
   There is a knock on the door and then the tape stops.
Prosecutors said the arrest of Grass was made at that time.
   After the arrests, Wilczynski testified, he was so nervous that
his shirt was wet with perspiration.
   ``I asked one of the officers if he could hear my heartbeat,''
he said.
   The jury also listened to a tape of a phone conversation
Wilczynski had on the day before the arrest, in which he set up the
meeting with Grass.
   The trial resumes Monday.
   Rite Aid, based in Shiremanstown, Pa., has denied wrongdoing and
said the check was a legitimate buyout of a consulting contract
Wilczynski had with Lane Drug., a division of Peoples Drug Stores
Inc. acquired by Rite Aid in April 1989.
   An indictment unsealed in August charged Grass and Rite Aid with
bribery and with possession of a criminal tool, described as a Rite
Aid corporate aircraft.

<HEAD>Former Thrift Chief Wins $19 Million Reprieve in War With
Regulators</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Columbia Savings &amp; Loan chief Thomas
Spiegel won a reprieve Friday from posting nearly $19 million while
he fights charges he squandered thrift funds.
   However, U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson restricted Spiegel's
personal finances until a hearing later this month and ordered him
to post a $1 million bond by Wednesday.
   Spiegel's lawyer called the ruling a victory in his war with
U.S. thrift regulators, who had sought to freeze the $19 million in
an escrow account Friday and are seeking another $5 million in
fines. The $24 million is the largest civil case ever brought
against an individual by the regulators.
   Spiegel has accused the regulators of making him a scapegoat to
divert attention from their incompetence.
   ``He's holding up fine and we're confident that we're going to
be able to respond to all the charges against him,'' said Spiegel's
lawyer, Dennis Perluss.
   Regulators say Spiegel wasted Columbia funds on guns, rock
concerts, wine, vacations, partnerships and purchases with junk
bond king Michael Milken, loans to an auto dealer who provided free
luxury cars to Spiegel, and $2.8 million in bonuses he drew even as
Columbia was losing money.
   Spiegel, who earned multimillion-dollar salaries while pouring
Beverly Hills-based Columbia's money heavily into Milken's
high-risk, high-yield bonds, was charged Thursday by the OTS with
improperly diverting the money.
   Acting on Perluss' request for a temporary restraining order,
Wilson temporarily barred the federal Office of Thrift Supervision
from enforcing its ``cease and desist'' order requiring Spiegel to
put the $19 million in escrow.
   Perluss argued that the law authorizing such emergency freezes
only applies to current directors or officers of a thrift. Spiegel
resigned from Columbia at the start of the year; the thrift had
lost $591 million during the year due to the sharp drop in the
value of its junk bond portfolio.
   The freeze also would violate Spiegel's right to due process
unless a neutral arbitrator holds a hearing on the matter, Perluss
argued.
   Wilson blocked the OTS from forcing Spiegel to put the money in
the escrow account until at least July 30, when a hearing will be
held before Wilson.
   But he also ordered Spiegel to use his assets only for
reasonable living expenses until then and to give the thrifts
office 48 hours notice if he wants to spend more than $5,000 on
anything other than living expenses and lawyers. The OTS has the
right to challenge any such expenditures in court.
   Under the direction of Spiegel, a close ally of former Drexel
Burnham Lambert junk bond chief Milken, Columbia had the industry's
largest portfolio of high-yield, high-risk junk bonds. Columbia is
still operating, but analysts predict junk bond losses eventually
will force government seizure.
   The $19 million in restitution, if recovered, would go to the
thrift, while the $5 million penalty would go to the U.S. Treasury.
   Perluss said the conditions imposed by the judge on Spiegel's
finances were ``perfectly reasonable.''
   ``We certainly expect that Mr. Spiegel will fully perform all of
these conditions and be on the conservative side in doing so,''
Perluss said.
