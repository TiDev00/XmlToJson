   President Bush promised Wednesday that
American combat troops would ``do what it takes'' to deter Iraqi
aggression, while the White House rejected conditions that an
official said were secretly offered by Baghdad for releasing
foreign hostages and withdrawing from Kuwait.
   Bush, in a pep talk intended for U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf
but heard by very few, offered the nation's thanks for their
service amid scorching temperatures and other hardships.
   ``You're now in the middle of one of the toughest military
missions in modern memory,'' he said. ``Well, as tough as it is,
know this: thanks to you, nobody's feeling the heat more than the
government in Baghdad.''
   A report that Iraq had sent the White House a secret message
brought mixed signals from the administration. A White House
official confirmed a message had been received but said the offer
had been rejected. The State Department denied any knowledge of
such a message.
   The White House official said a former high-ranking U.S.
official recently delivered a secret message from Iraq offering to
release hostages and pull out of Kuwait if certain demands were
met. The message was delivered to Brent Scowcroft, the president's
national security adviser, said the official.
   ``This is basically a nonstarter,'' the White House official
said of the offer. ``Our position has always been that Iraq must
withdraw from Kuwait. Anything that seeks to circumvent the U.N.
resolve does not provide great optimism for movement,'' he said,
commenting only on condition of anonymity.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Secretary of
State James A. Baker III had ``no knowledge whatsoever of a secret
... back channel message.''
   In the message, Iraq demanded that U.N. sanctions be withdrawn
and that it be guaranteed access to the Persian Gulf as well as
sole control of an oil field that dips into Kuwait, according to
Newsday, which first reported the proposal.
   In Baghdad, Iraq's official news agency said no such proposal
was made.
   The White House issued a statement late Wednesday acknowledging
that a former administration official ``relayed ideas concerning
the Persian Gulf situation'' to Scowcroft recently.
   The statement did not identify the source of the ``ideas'' but
said Scowcroft did inform Baker about what had been suggested.
   ``The administration has received many such proposals and ideas,
as it does at any time during a crisis, from various individuals,''
White House deputy press secretary Roman Popadiuk said. ``There was
nothing in this particular proposal that merited its pursuit.''
   Both Baker and Scowcroft were invited to dinner with Bush at the
White House, along with an unspecified number of Senate and House
members.
   Popadiuk, at a briefing for reporters, originally had refused to
confirm or deny the existence of any message from Iraq, saying
merely ``we're aware of many initiatives that are being undertaken
by various bodies.''
   He said it would be ``self-defeating to start singling out one
proposal or one putative proposal or initiative at the expense of
others.'' He said the main point is that the United Nations has
``spoken as one voice'' in demanding that Iraq pull its troops out
of Kuwait.
   Popadiuk also said there was no indication Iraq had carried out
its promise to free foreign women and children. The State
Department said it would be a ``significant step in the right
direction'' if Iraq did follow through on that promise.
   In other developments:
   _Two television networks, NBC and CNN, said U.S. agencies,
particularly Army Special Forces troops and the CIA, were helping
the Kuwaiti resistance in hit-and-run attacks on Iraqi occupiers.
No U.S. troops were said to be involved, but Kuwaiti fighters based
on the Saudi-Kuwait border were reported to be getting
intelligence, weapons, radios, advice and instruction from the
United States.
   A U.S. diplomatic source confirmed the reports in general terms,
saying, ``We're aware of their action and we're supporting them.''
This source claimed to be unaware of details.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said, ``We don't comment on
intelligence matters.''
   _The White House, under pressure from Congress, said it was
seeking help from allies to defray the expense of deploying tens of
thousands of U.S. combat forces to the Persian Gulf. The cost is
estimated at $2.5 billion through September.
   Japan pledged money, medical assistance and non-military
supplies, but said it would not provide soldiers or weapons.
   The Washington Post said in Thursday editions a draft plan
prepared for a National Security Council meeting Wednesday called
for total contributions of $1.3 billion from Japan; $600 million
from Germany, $4 billion from Saudi Arabia, $1 billion from the
United Arab Emirates; $3 billion from Kuwait and an undetermined
amount from South Korea. The draft called for substantial sums
would be paid to countries hurt by the trade embargo with Iraq.
   _The administration confirmed it had asked Congress to approve a
$2.2 billion dollar arms sale to Saudi Arabia, including 24 F-15
warplanes, 150 M-60 A-3 tanks, 200 shoulder-fired Stinger missiles
and 50 launchers and several thousand rounds of anti-tank
ammunition.
   Other arms deals were being considered, the administration said.
   _The 593rd Area Support Group from Fort Lewis, Wash., left with
an undisclsoed number of soldiers for the Middle East. The unit
helps other units involved in maintenance, supply and
transportation.
   _The 4th Tactical Fighter Squadron based at Hill Air Force Base
in Utah, flying 24 F-16s and other suppporting aircraft, left Shaw
Air Force Base, S.C., for the Middle East. A sister squadron, the
421st, will leave Hill on Thursday.
   The 437th Services Squadron, meanwhile, dispatched 20 members
from Charleston, S.C. Air Force Base to take care of mess halls and
other installations for Air Force units in the Middle East.
   As for the proposed release of women and children, about 1,000
Americans could be affected.
   ``We hope Saddam Hussein will have the human decency to live up
to his word,'' State Department spokeswoman Tutwiler said.
   Iraq's ambassador to the United States, Mohamed Al-Mashat, went
to the State Department to formally notify the United States of the
decision to let women and children go. He said Americans will be
allowed to leave through Jordan or Turkey, but gave no timetable
for their departure.
   Al-Mashat said that once the United States gives assurances
``that they are not going to strike Iraq, and attack Iraq or
aggress upon Iraq, then we are going to let even men out.''
   From the Oval Office, Bush offered words of appreciation fo the
U.S. forces in the gulf.
   ``Our troops around the world are providing the kind of strength
and security that makes this mission possible,'' Bush said. ``And
with the support of friends and family and the admiration of this
great nation, you're proving that you'll do what it takes at any
hour, anywhere, to contain aggression and keep freedom's light
alive.''
   The message was beamed live over Armed Forces Radio but was not
heard by most U.S. soldiers because the radio network does not have
a transmitter in Saudi Arabia. The White House said it was heard on
ships in the area.
   In Dhahran, Navy Capt. Mike Sherman said transcripts and tape
recordings of the speech will be distributed to each unit stationed
in Saudi Arabia, a process which, including delivery time, would
take a week.
   Bush encouraged the troops to ``stand strong'' despite many
hardships.
   He told them, ``You stand on the front line against aggression
and international lawlessness.''

   NASA on Thursday canceled the launch
of space shuttle Columbia scheduled for Saturday because of a
failed electronic part on one of the four telescopes in the
shuttle's cargo bay.
   The launch of the shuttle with its Astro observatory mission
will take place ``no earlier than next Wednesday,'' said Bruce
Buckingham, a NASA spokesman.
   NASA had been hoping for a weekend flight that would be the
first since the Discovery carried the flawed Hubble Space Telescope
into orbit in April. Launches since then have been scrubbed because
of fuel leaks.
   But the delay will give NASA a chance to put the shuttle
Discovery on another pad so it can stay on schedule for an early
October launch. The space agency has only a 19-day opportunity to
begin a Discovery mission dispatching the Ulysses space probe to
study the sun. The launch ``window'' will not open again for 13
months.
   Engineers had been struggling most of the day Thursday trying to
establish communication with an X-ray observatory, one of the four
telescopes carried in the cargo bay of the Columbia. At first they
could not determine whether the fault lay in a ground link or with
the circuits inside the shuttle.
   They eventually traced the problem to an ``avionics box'' on the
X-ray telescope.
   ``We're not exactly sure about how we're going to fix that
box,'' Buckingham said.
   NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said there are two different
components within the box and the length of time needed for repair
depends on which of the parts is broken.
   ``We're talking midweek for the launch,'' she said. ``It's going
to take several days to look at it.''
   The launch of the Astro observatory aboard the Columbia already
had been delayed five years. It originally was scheduled for March
1986, but the Challenger disaster in January 1986 cancelled all
flights.
   The mission was rescheduled for May 30, but when fuel was pumped
into the shuttle tanks, a leak was discovered.
   The new problem surfaced after Columbia's payload bay doors were
closed Wednesday night.
   The shuttle, sitting on its seaside pad, is connected with the
launch control center 3{ miles away with regular telephone-type
lines.
   Program scientist Ed Weiler said full contact with the
observatory is necessary for launch. The scientific returns from
the flight will not suffer if the flight must be delayed a few
days, he said.
   ``A few days' slip really won't affect it at all. It really
won't change it,'' Weiler said.
   The delay in launching Columbia has created the longest gap
between shuttle missions since flights resumed following the 1986
Challenger disaster.
   The $150 million Astro observatory will probe some of the
hottest objects in the universe during the mission, which will last
nine to 10 days. A comet and supernova are among the approximately
150 targets.
   Four astronomers aboard Columbia will work non-stop in shifts to
operate Astro's three ultraviolet telescopes. The X-ray telescope
will be managed by computer commands sent from Goddard Space Flight
Center in Greenbelt, Md.
   It is the first shuttle mission in five years devoted entirely
to scientific research.
   ``We're just as enthusiastic as we ever were about having an
absolutely first-class, state-of-the-art scientific mission,''
astronaut Jeffrey Hoffman said after arriving Wednesday night from
Johnson Space Center in Houston. ``We hope to come back having seen
some things that nobody's ever seen before.''
   Columbia's commander Vance Brand said the crew's morale dropped
after the first failed launch attempt but has since shot back up.
   ``My morale is great, and I think I can detect the same in the
other crewmen,'' Brand said.

   Firefighters on Wednesday controlled a
2,970-acre forest fire that killed two people and destroyed 19
homes and cabins.
   Firefighters attacked the blaze early in the morning, putting
finishing touches on fire lines and digging up and dousing hot
spots. They were aided by bulldozers and water-bearing helicopters.
Aerial tankers were on standby to drop fire retardant, if needed.
   It was declared under control at 8 p.m. MST, said fire
information officer Richard Pine.
   Andy Gray, Bureau of Land Management fire information officer,
said many of the 680 firefighters would begin demobilization.
   ``We're not out of the woods yet, but it's looking pretty
good,'' he said.
   The fire exploded in tinder-dry oak brush and pine trees 30
miles east of Salt Lake City on Sunday, propelled by 60 mph wind.
   The fire is believed to have been started by an ember blown over
fire lines from a smaller blaze that was ignited by an apparently
illegal campfire.
   It caused millions of dollars in damage and killed two longtime
Wasatch County employees working as firefighters. Nineteen homes
and cabins, some valued at $1 million, burned and officials
evacuated more than 300 others.
   Power to the area would likely remain off for another week,
although Utah Power &amp; Light Co. had more than 250 workers on hand,
authorities said.

   The small-is-beautiful fraternity of
ale fanatics had a bitter surprise at the Great British Beer
Festival.
   The grand champion, Burton Ale, was made by one of the six giant
breweries that are the betes noires of the British beer snob.
   Michael Jackson, an Englishman who calls himself the world's
best-known beer writer, declared that Burton Ale ``really is a very
serious English bitter, a classic example of an English bitter.''
   He rhapsodized about the ``beautiful balance of the sweetness of
the malt, and the flowery, floral character, the drier
characteristics, of the hop. I think in the end the hop wins
through.''
   Definitely an exception, in the eyes of the Campaign for Real
Ale, the festival sponsor.
   ``On the whole, we don't think that the national brewers do a
particularly good job,'' said Stephen Cox, spokesman for the
organization.
   ``That doesn't mean that we don't give praise where it's due,
and Burton Ale is actually an example of a national brewer doing
something that we think is right.''
   Another big brewer, Whitbread, was banned from the festival as
punishment for closing two old breweries in Liverpool and producing
the brands elsewhere.
   Burton Ale ``is the case of a large, very commercially minded
brewery setting out its stall to show that it can make a classic
example of this style,'' Jackson said.
   Closer to the heart of the Campaign for Real Ale was Woodforde's
``Wherry Best Bitter,'' honored as the best new beer.
   Allied Breweries, which produces Burton Ale, controls 6,500 pubs
and 13 percent of the British beer market.
   That much of the market amounts to about 90,000 barrels a week.
Woodforde produces 150 barrels on a good week at its brewery in
Woodbastwick in Norfolk, said Bram Lowe, the sales manager.
   Britain's traditional ales _ the bitters, milds and stouts _
have been shoved aside in recent decades by lagers, many of them
from such foreign brewers as Heineken, Grolsch and Foster's.
   Real cask-conditioned ale, once the working man's pint, has gone
up-market, while lager gave birth to the ``lager lout,'' an
all-purpose term for young rowdies.
   ``I'm really an unapologetic beer snob,'' Jackson said. ``I feel
that beer is demonstrably as complex a product as wine and deserves
taking as seriously as wine does.''
   Since the Campaign for Real Ale began in 1971, the number of
breweries in Britain has grown from about 100 to roughly 250, Cox
said.
   British ales, even the style of drawing a pint, vary noticeably
by region.
   ``I personally like to see quite a nice, thick, creamy head,''
John Hayward of Allied Breweries said by telephone from company
headquarters in Burton-upon-Trent. ``People in London don't like
one at all.''
   The festival, held in a warehouse-like hotel annex in the first
week of August, offered 300 varieties of ale.
   Included in the fanciful convention of brands were Titanic
``Lifeboat,'' Shepherd Neame ``Bishop's Finger,'' Crouch Vale
``Willie Warmer,'' Trough ``Hogshead,'' Uley ``Pigor Mortis,''
Archer's ``Headbanger,'' Orkney ``Skullsplitter'' and Whitby's Own
``Woblle.''
   If real ale must be old ale, there were ``Old Growler,'' ``Old
Grumble,'' ``Old Peculier,'' ``Old Merlin,'' ``Old Hookey,'' ``Old
Buzzard,'' ``Old Thumper,'' ``Owd Roger,'' and ``Old Lubrication.''
   Each cask was labeled with its specific gravity, with 1,000
representing water and higher numbers indicating higher potency.
   ``We drink first of all the 1030s, the 1040s,'' said Peter
Crombecq, leading a delegation of three from the Belgian beer group
De Objectieve Bierproeuers. ``And then, as `pousse cafe,' a 1050 or
a 1060.''
   Crombecq said there was a limit to how many bitters, milds,
stouts and ciders he could taste at one session.
   ``Depends,'' as he put it. ``If you want to taste in depth,
five. If we want to taste the hop taste, the basic taste, 10.''
   He was well past 10, but agreed to analyze the Vaux Double Maxim
in his glass: ``Dry and bitter, roasty. . . . A little sweet, the
aftertaste is especially dry.''
   Belgium has 107 breweries, less than half the British total, but
may do better per square mile.
   ``Ah, I know the figures per square mile in Bavaria,'' Crombecq
said dreamily. ``There is one brewery for 33 square miles. In
Germany (as a whole), it's one brewery per 240 square miles. In
Belgium it's one brewery for 330 square miles.''

   An Army unit on the Kansas plain
has produced a booklet to help U.S. soldiers in Saudi Arabia learn
the life-or-death lessons of the desert.
   ``The desert can easily kill an unprepared soldier,'' warns the
new manual prepared for Operation Desert Shield.
   Filled with common-sense, plain-spoken language, the 25-page
booklet is packed with a few basic rules of survival for those
unprepared for desert climes.
   ``It's a basic training document if you've not had any
experience in the desert,'' said Brig. Gen. James Lyle, the
commander of the unit that put the publication together.
   Some of its hints:
   _You lose less water if you keep your clothes on!
   _Don't play with snakes!
   _Before putting clothes on in the field, check for critters!
   _Wood shrinks in the desert _ make sure axheads are secure
before using!
   _Check your feet daily _ change socks frequently!
   The Army has printed 250,000 copies of the little manual, and
5,000 were flown to Saudi Arabia this week, Lyle said.
   ``It's designed to fit in the pocket, right here,'' the general
said, slapping the thigh pocket on his camouflage uniform.
   Lyle is in charge of the Center for Lessons Learned, the Army
unit that gleans studies and reports from many Army exercises or
activities _ and then compiles a huge data base to help commanders
teach their soldiers the best way to plan, organize and carry out
their missions.
   The booklet, ``Winning in the Desert,'' was put together in four
days. It uses information gathered from the Army's desert training
center at Fort Irwin, Calif., from joint U.S.-Saudi exercises held
during the past 10 years and exercises conducted by the Saudi
Arabian National Guard, Lyle said.
   The publication is brief and blunt about the dangers the desert
can hold.
   But it also points out that men have waged war in those harsh
environs for centuries, some more successfully than others.
   Knowledge of the desert is key.
   ``Priorities may alter, techniques will vary ... but soldiers,
leaders and units who are fit and well-trained to fight ... will
have little difficulty adjusting to desert war,'' Lyle said.
   Small maps of Saudi Arabia and Iraq are accompanied by brief
discussions of each country's geography and climate.
   A section on the desert clearly points out the dangers of too
much sun and too little water _ but it also tells soldiers not to
lie or sit on the ground, since those surfaces can be 30 degrees
hotter than the air.
   Don't panic if you become lost, it says. Remember that the sun
rises in the east, the booklet advises, offering a way to find
one's direction with a rock and a stick.
   ``If you have water, drink it. ... If water is limited, keep
your mouth shut. Do not talk,'' to conserve moisture in your body,
it says.
   The environment plays havoc with the military's equipment, the
booklet warns.
   On rocky deserts, ``the M54 5-ton truck is prone to air
hydraulic cylinder failure and power-steering leaks,'' it says.
Batteries don't hold their charge in intense heat, either.
   ``You must keep ammunition away from direct heat and sunlight.
If it can be held by bare hands, it is safe to fire,'' the
publication says. One way to keep it cooler is to bury it at least
three feet deep and in a shaded area.
   Weapons may become clogged, or missiles jammed on launching
rails due to dust or sand accumulation, leading to early detonation.
   Driving in the desert is best on tracked vehicles, but success
has less to do with mobility than the skill of the driver.
   ``A relatively agile vehicle will sink up to the hubs if its
driver insists on gunning the engine in soft sand,'' the
publication warns.
   Dust, sand, rough terrain and temperature extremes cause a 50
percent increase in the repair parts needed to support a combat
unit, it says.
   Lyle said his unit has been getting an average of 17 to 25
queries daily from U.S. commanders in Saudi Arabia, asking how to
cope with such problems as conked-out batteries, tread life on
tanks or operating helicopters in the desert.
   And, he added, ``We're getting feedback constantly'' on whether
the suggestions work.
   Over and over, the book reminds soldiers to drink, even if they
aren't thirsty.
   ``Experience indicates that if a man feels thirsty in the
desert, he is already on the borderline of trouble. The Arabs drink
a very sweet, hot tea. It is possible there is good reason to
imitate them,'' the booklet says.
   Lyle added: ``We tell them to drink until they bust.''

   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein said in an interview
Wednesday that ``God is on our side and Satan is on the side of the
United States'' in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Saddam spoke in separate interviews with CBS and French
television, his first to Western reporters since the Iraqi
president sent his forces to invade Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   In a 90-minute interview with CBS anchor Dan Rather taped in
Baghdad on Wednesday, the Iraqi leader declared flatly, ``Kuwait is
part of Iraq.''
   ``We have said this, and the legislative bodies in Iraq have
issued a clear decree saying that Kuwait is an Iraqi province,'' he
said.
   Saddam also denied making any secret proposals to pull out of
Kuwait.
   A White House official confirmed Wednesday that the Bush
administration received a secret Iraqi offer to free all captives
and withdraw from Kuwait if certain conditions were met.
   The conditions were that the international trade embargo against
Iraq be lifted and Baghdad be granted access to the Persian Gulf
and sole control of an oil field that dips into Kuwait, according
to the New York area newspaper Newsday.
   The White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the offer was rejected.
   Saddam questioned the United States' right to negotiate Kuwait's
status.
   ``Is Kuwait the 52nd state of the United States?'' he asked.
   ``No, you have said it is the 19th province of Iraq,'' replied
Rather, referring to the recent annexation of Kuwait.
   Saddam gave evasive answers to many of Rather's questions,
including one on whether Iraq would use chemical or biological
weapons if invaded. However, he said, ``Iraq is not going to be an
easy bite to swallow.
   ``Iraq will come out victorious,'' Saddam said. ``... God is on
our side and Satan is on the side of the United States.''
   In his comments for French television, Saddam asserted once
again the United States cannot defeat Iraq, adding ``I do not beg
before anyone.''
   The Iraqi president said he is not an easy target because he
does not remain in one place ``to invite being bombed.'' He said
defiantly that the United States ``is not the angel of death.''
   That inteview was conducted in Baghdad on Tuesday by French
anchorman Patrick Poivre d'Arvor of station TF1.
   The first part of the two-hour session, with excerpts broadcast
on the evening news, took place in front of a group of Western
hostages, Poivre d'Arvor said later. He objected when the Iraqis
proposed including the hostages in the session, and it was then
continued in private as the two men strolled together.
   Poivre d'Arvor said the film was confiscated and returned eight
hours later with a question on Western hostages deleted.
   Saddam, who has barred Westerners from leaving Iraq and sent
some of them to stategic installations to deter any U.S. attack,
announced Tuesday that women and children could leave. The French
interview was taped that day before the annoucement.
   Saddam spoke with an air of confidence, despite the huge buildup
of U.S., European, Arab and other forces in the region to counter
Iraq.
   ``A victory for the United States is not realistic,'' Saddam
said. He said America would have to defeat the Iraqi army, the
Iraqi economy and ``defeat the Iraqi regime.''
   In his CBS interview, Saddam renewed Iraq's argument that the
foreigners held by Iraq should not be called hostages.
   ``A hostage by definition means that you have to take someone
and ask for someone in return for releasing them. What have we
asked from the United States in return for releasing them? We have
asked for nothing,'' he said. However, he did call them ``guests
against their will.''
   Saddam also said he had instructed that in the event of an
attack, the foreigners be first to go into any shelters.
   ``These are guests,'' he said. ``We are treating them as guests.
And, according to Arab tradition, guests come before households.''
   Saddam claims he has 6.5 million men under arms. Iraq is
estimated to have armed forces of about 1 million, but Saddam
claims about 5 million Iraqis serve in a militia known as the
Popular Army.
   In the French interview, the Iraqi president also denied earlier
reports he had pledged to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak he would
not invade Kuwait.
   ``When did I say I wouldn't invade Kuwait? Tell me,'' he said.

   Columbia's seven astronauts arrived
Wednesday night for this weekend's launch, expressing confidence in
the newly repaired shuttle that is to carry them into space on an
astronomy mission.
   ``We're ready to go. We shouldn't fool around with this any
more,'' Columbia's commander Vance Brand said on arrival from
Johnson Space Center in Houston. ``We have a great ship out there.''
   Columbia is scheduled to lift off at 1:17 a.m. EDT Saturday with
the $150 million Astro observatory.
   ``The hallmark of being an astronaut is being patient, or being
flexible, and I think this crew has put that to the test,'' said
astronaut Robert Parker.
   NASA will be making its second attempt to launch Columbia for
this mission. The shuttle was supposed to go up May 30, but a
hydrogen leak was discovered during fueling and the flight was
called off.
   Atlantis was next in line, but its classified Pentagon mission
was delayed from July to November when similar leaks were found.
The discovery prompted NASA to temporarily ground the entire
three-shuttle fleet.
   The countdown for Saturday's launch proceeded smoothly Wednesday
amid worries over the long lull between shuttle flights and
numerous other problems besetting the space agency.
   ``There's anxiety,'' said mission scientist Ted Gull. ``NASA
needs to be successful.''
   NASA engineers originally believed Atlantis' leaks were in a
different spot than the ones on Columbia. Both problems now appear
to be in a 17-inch-diameter valve that connects the orbiter and
external tank.
   ``That's clearly where the problem is,'' said Bob Schwinghamer,
deputy director for space transportation. ``If you step back and
away from it, you can expect to have some leakage there. The
question is we just have to control it, keep it within acceptable
limits.''
   If the new plumbing installed in Columbia leaks beyond those
limits during fueling, ``we'll just stop,'' Schwinghamer said.
   In addition to leaky shuttles, NASA has spent the summer
struggling with the flawed Hubble Space Telescope, carried into
orbit by Discovery in April on the last shuttle flight. A mirror
defect is preventing the $1.5 billion telescope from focusing
clearly.
   More recently, NASA has been stymied by communications problems
with the Magellan spacecraft, which is orbiting Venus. The
spacecraft twice has lost contact with Earth, and the agency has
delayed its mapping of Venus until late September.
   If all goes well, Columbia will be the first shuttle to fly
since Discovery's trip with Hubble. That's the longest gap between
missions since flights resumed following the 1986 Challenger
disaster.
   During the nine- to 10-day mission, Astro's three ultraviolet
telescopes and one X-ray telescope are expected to observe some of
the hottest objects in the universe. The four astronomers aboard
will operate the ultraviolet telescopes, while the X-ray telescope
will be managed at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
   ``We've done the best we can. We've made the best payload that
we know how. We've thoroughly tested it,'' said mission manager
Jack Jones.
   ``We've certainly had ample opportunity to simulate and train
for the mission. That's more than we would normally have, so in a
way that's a plus.'' The Astro mission originally was scheduled for
March 1986, but the Challenger disaster earlier that year delayed
the flight and all others. Astro's observing schedule was revised
for the May flight and again for Saturday's launch attempt.
   About half of the approximately 150 objects that Astro will
observe _ some of them millions of degrees _ are the same targets
from those in May's mission. Most of the others had to be replaced
because they got too close to the sun for the instruments to see.
   Columbia's flight will be the first shuttle mission in five
years devoted entirely to scientific research.

<HEAD>Three Democrats Fighting for Shot at Embattled GOP Governor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Gov. Edward D. DiPrete has
watched three fellow New England governors decide not to run for
re-election as their political fortunes deteriorated along with the
region's economy.
   His approval ratings in a Brown University poll have dipped to
16 percent, less than half that of two years ago. Three Democrats
are fighting like wolves, confident that whoever wins the Sept. 11
primary can beat him.
   And two local newspaper pundits have started a DiPrete
``political suicide watch.''
   Yet the embattled governor says he loves his job and professes
confidence he'll be re-elected to a fourth two-year term.
   ``In the executive branch of government you can bring about
change. You can move more quickly,'' he said recently.
   ``I've never been one inclined toward suicide, and if I thought
I couldn't win this race, we wouldn't be having this interview.''
   DiPrete, 56, who headed the family's insurance and real estate
firm before being elected governor in 1984, cultivates a
Winnebago-and-bologna-sandwiches image. Even President Bush,
stumping at a country club recently for GOP candidates, said he
expected to see ``Winnebago One'' there.
   The governor is at his best working the coffee shops, going door
to door in shopping centers, shaking hands.
   ``Give me 15 minutes, and I won't turn everyone around, but I'll
turn a lot of them,'' DiPrete said.
   Nearly all the New England governors have suffered along with
the region's economy. Three Democrats _ Michael Dukakis in
Massachusetts, William O'Neill in Connecticut and Madeleine Kunin
in Vermont _ decided not to run again.
   DiPrete, stung by ethics questions and charges of mismanagement
two years ago, is casting himself as an experienced leader against
untested newcomers.
   The governor is heavily favored over radio talk show host Steve
White in the GOP primary. He has yet to launch his TV ad campaign,
hoping to trade some political ground now for a strong close in
November.
   DiPrete counts on the three Democrats _ Providence Mayor Joseph
R. Paolino Jr., Warwick Mayor Francis X. Flaherty and millionaire
businessman Bruce G. Sundlun _ to tear each other apart in the
rough-and-tumble politics of the smallest state.
   Democrats did it in 1984, paving the way for DiPrete's first
term. Sundlun was left to wage lonely battles in 1986 and 1988
against a then-popular governor.
   Paolino won the party endorsement in June, but Sundlun and
Flaherty supporters walked out as Paolino spoke. August brought a
spate of negative TV ads, mostly from Sundlun and Paolino.
   ``It's getting embarrassing,'' said Flaherty, considered the
long shot. ``They're whacking each other personally ... and,
frankly, it's given me the opportunity to sit back and say I agree
with both of them.''
   Sundlun, 70, running an ``I am not a politician'' campaign,
projects Flaherty and Paolino as beholden to contributors.
   Paolino charges that Sundlun traded support for contributions to
other candidates. He also accuses the former Outlet stores
president of ruining the chain, a state icon, although Sundlun sold
the stores two years before they closed.
   The latter charge mirrors DiPrete's last-minute ad in the 1988
campaign, when he beat Sundlun by fewer than 7,000 votes.
   Sundlun's ads question why Paolino, his sponsor for the city
school board and housing authority, has turned on him. And both
blame Flaherty for firing the first ad chastising them for
criticizing a ``golden parachute'' state early retirement plan when
they OK'd a similar plan for Providence.
   Total spending has topped $4 million, and the governor estimates
he and his Democratic challenger will drop a total of $5 million
more by Election Day. The final bill could be more than $20 a vote.
   Paolino, 35, the scion of a family with a fortune in Providence
real estate, has honed an image of the young City Council president
turning the city around. He beame mayor six years ago when
Republican Vincent A. ``Buddy'' Cianci Jr. was forced from office
by a felony assault conviction.
   Flaherty, 43, a Vietnam veteran and night school-educated
lawyer, casts himself as a friend of working people.
   With some variations, all three Democrats have taken similar
positions on the issues. They promise to reduce the state budget by
cutting costs and making realistic revenue projections, strengthen
ethics and disclosure requirements, crack down on drugs and provide
more state help for education, especially in distressed cities.
   None is discounting DiPrete.
   ``I believe whoever wins the Democratic primary will be the next
governor as long as they do not underestimate Governor DiPrete's
political astuteness and savvy,'' Paolino said. ``He's the
consummate politician.''

<HEAD>Air Pollution Causes More Damage to Forests in Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forest damage caused by air pollution worsened
last year in Eastern Europe, and the western Soviet Union
officially reported a major problem for the first time, a new U.N.
report says.
   The survey by the U.N. Economic Commission for Europe said
forest damage continued to grow in 1989 in several Eastern European
countries.
   In parts of Western Europe the health of woodlands reportedly
rebounded, said the survey, which was issued on Wednesday.
   In the Soviet Union, heavy damage was reported by the
Byelorussian republic and in the Kaliningrad region, which is
sandwiched between Lithuania and Poland on the Baltic.
   Pine forests were especially affected. Byelorussia said a
limited survey showed three-quarters of its evergreens were damaged.
   Czechoslovakia, Poland and Bulgaria also reported significant
problems. Czechoslovakia had the highest share of moderately and
severely damaged deciduous trees among 24 European countries
providing data.
   A U.N. source said some of the increase was undoubtedly due to
wider surveys conducted in Eastern Europe after last fall's
democratic changes.
   The survey did not specify in which areas the problem worsened.
   Britain showed the broadest damage in Western Europe. Denmark
and West Germany also reported a considerable toll, particularly
among leafy trees.
   Survey data indicated Italy, Portugal, Spain and France have
some of the most unscathed forests in Western Europe.
   In the Soviet Union, the Ukraine has very healthy trees,
according to preliminary figures.

<TEXT>
   Albania has denied Western reports it is
building a wall around embassies in its capital to restrict access
to them.
   In a bid to emigrate, about 5,000 Albanians crashed the gates
and climbed over embassy walls last month to gain access to foreign
missions. They eventually were allowed to leave Albania.
   The official ATA news agency, quoting unidentified government
sources, said Wednesday that officials were not building a wall.
Instead, it said ``at the request of some embassies themselves some
adjustments of the walls and their lattices are being made.''
   It did not say which embassies are involved.
   Western travelers and U.S. congressional sources reported last
week that the only road into Tirana's diplomatic quarter was
blocked by metal barricades.
   Western businessmen said brick walls up to 16 inches thick were
being erected around the embassies, and that the wall was already
10 feet high in places.
   Albania is the last holdout against the democratic reforms
sweeping Eastern Europe.

   Here are some of the countries hardest hit by
non-payment of Iraqi debts:
   FRANCE _ The biggest Western arms supplier to Iraq during its
war with Iran. Baghdad owes $4.6 billion to the French government,
banks and businesses.
   TURKEY _ Stands to lose tourists and revenues from the pipeline
that brings Iraqi oil to its ports. Turkish construction companies
say their losses are about $768 million. Hardest hit, business
sources said, is ENKA Construction, which was building a $3 billion
dam in northern Iraq.
   GREECE _ The Trade Ministry says Iraq's debts are about $190
million. Business sources say the figure is closer to $400 million.
The Trade Ministry says Iraq owes $47 million for military hardware
it bought from two state-owned armaments firms.
   WEST GERMANY _ Agreed to reschedule loans worth $900 million
last year but has been unwilling to extend new export credit.
   ITALY _ Is owed for military equipment. On Aug. 1, an Iraqi
delegation visited Rome to negotiate rescheduling $900 million in
overdue government-guaranteed commercial export credits. Iraq
refuses to pay because an order of Italian-made warships and
helicopters, placed in the 1970s, was blocked by an arms embargo.
Italian businesses stand to lose nearly $11 billion in deals with
Iraq because of the embargo, according to SACE, the state export
credit insurance agency.
   JAPAN _ The companies most exposed are Mitsui, Mitsubishi and
Nissho Iwai, said Alexander Muroncew, an analyst with Jardine
Fleming Securities Ltd. in Tokyo. Mitsubishi had a contract for a
73 billion-yen (500 million dollars) oil field development, but
work has not begun.
   KOREA _ Hyundai, the engineering and construction company, said
Iraq owes at least $300 million for construction work.

   Presenting Gulf Chic, the hottest look under the
Saudi sun and on the military surplus circuit: desert khaki and
chocolate brown, gas mask optional.
   Americans weary of the same old fatigues are snapping up desert
camouflage outfits just like the ones U.S. troops are sweating in
on duty in Saudi Arabia. And travelers to the Middle East who like
to come prepared are packing Israeli gas masks next to their
sunscreen.
   ``It's the in thing right now,'' said Peter Kalaydjian, co-owner
of RECON-1 military supply store in Los Angeles. ``It's what's seen
on TV, and that's when the wanna-bes come out.''
   Fashion critic Mr. Blackwell, best known for his annual
worst-dressed celebrity lists, has declared the khaki-and-chocolate
desert camo a ``light and airy look. . . . It's an old idea with a
new twist.''
   Now available at military surplus coast-to-coast for $50 or $60
a set.
   ``We got everything! The pants! The shirt! The hat!'' crowed
Eric Yefet, manager of The Real Army &amp; Navy Store in Brooklyn.
Desert camouflage sales have jumped a mere 20 percent, but gas
masks!
   ``This went up 700 percent! Private people, big companies,
everybody wants 'em! Forget it! Big order for the gas masks!''
Yefet yelled into the phone on Tuesday. ``The prices have gone up
on wholesale four times in the last two weeks! It's going up
again!''
   Civilians traveling to the Middle East, including reporters,
photographers and business types, have pushed the market to the
limit. The Israeli surplus gas mask that sold for $10 two weeks ago
now costs $40. ``A good investment!'' Yefet said.
   ``I could have sold hundreds if I had them,'' said Everett
Knutson, owner of Soldier Surplus in Mesa, Ariz. ``One guy called
from New York for 100,000 masks.''
   Knutson said businessmen buy as many as they can and scalp them
in Israel for $200 each. But they're still selling for $9 at
Missouri Wilderness Catalogue Co. of Columbia, Mo., co-owner Linda
Mullins said.
   That could change momentarily, however.
   ``It depends how scarce they are. We're looking at 30 of them
right now, and I can usually get more,'' she said. ``I did sell a
gas mask right out of the blue yesterday, plus a gas mask bag. We
never sell those.''
   Will they work against Saddam's chemical weapons?
   ``The writing on the box is in Hebrew. Let me see if there are
directions inside,'' Mullins said. ``Hmmmmm. Those are in Hebrew,
too. Gosh, it'd be interesting if I could read this and find out if
it was chemical-resistant. I guess I couldn't make any guarantees.''
   How old are these things, anyway?
   ``Older than I'd like to think about. About 18 years,'' said
Mitchell WerBell, president of Brigade Quartermasters of Kennesaw,
Ga., suppliers of what he likes to call ``action gear'' for
soldiers, police, hunters, campers, survivalists and people who
need casual yet indestructible clothing.
   ``It's new, never been used,'' he hastened to add. ``It's just
old. They're not the most sophisticated, state-of-the-art military
gas mask. You can't get those.''
   No matter. People seem to want whatever they can get, just in
case.
   ``They all think they are going to get zapped over here,'' sid
Pat Stoppkotte, a clerk at Larada Army Surplus in Mesa, Ariz.
   At Brigade's toll-free line, all the customer service
respresentatives are busy, busy, busy. Please hold, and the next
operator will be happy to take your order _ as soon as they are
done with the Saudis.
   The Saudi government recently ordered $200,000 worth of
canteens, canteen covers, flashlights, sleeping bags, you name it,
WerBell said. The U.S. government has been calling, the store has
been shipping out enormous overnight orders, and sales to other
retailers are up 70 percent.
   ``Our phones went absolutely nuts yesterday,'' WerBell said.
``We had 700 orders, which was a lot for us on a Monday.
   ``It's a little bit of everything,'' he said. ``It's a lot of
everything, too.''
   Parents of military personnel who might be ordered abroad have
been showing up at Kalaydjian's RECON-1 to buy going-away gifts for
their kids. A popular choice: carbon-steel combat knives at $220 a
pop. He recently sold six.
   ``Fathers, mothers,'' Kalaydjian said, ``They want the best for
whoever's going.''

<HEAD>Democrats Mobilizing to Protest Preliminary Census Figures</HEAD>

   Democrats are mobilizing local officials to
protest preliminary census figures and pressure the government to
take another look at the count for the nation's cities and rural
areas.
   ``I don't believe it,'' New York Gov. Mario Cuomo said Wednesday
when the Census Bureau estimated that his state's population grew
by fewer than 70,000 during the past decade.
   ``Way out of line,'' Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson said of the
estimate for his city.
   An analysis done for Democratic state legislators said the
preliminary figures for rural areas, particularly in the South,
were consistently below the population estimates issued by the
Census Bureau in February.
   With the release of numbers for New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania
and Texas, the Census Bureau completed its estimate of the
population for all 50 states.
   Overall, the preliminary census figures show the United States
with a population of 245,837,683. Ten years ago, the census set the
nation's population at 226,545,805.
   To no one's surprise, the numbers showed Americans continued to
move South and West during the past 10 years.
   Nineteen U.S. House seats will follow that population shift to
the Sun Belt.
   That trend was good news for Republicans, who consider the Sun
Belt the area of their strongest growth. But a similar trend in the
1980 Census, when 17 House seats shifted South and West, failed to
yield expected GOP gains because most of the state legislators who
drew the new district lines were Democrats.
   The big winner when the shift takes place in time for the 1992
election will be California, which is expected to gain seven new
House seats for a total of 52. With a population expected to push
close to 30 million, California would have 21 more House seats than
the second-largest state, New York.
   Based on the preliminary population figures, Florida would gain
four House seats and Texas three. Picking up one each would be
Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington.
   New York would lose three House seats and Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Michigan and Illinois two each. Losing one seat each would be Iowa,
Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey and
West Virginia.
   Officials who think the Census Bureau missed a lot of people in
their areas have 15 working days to submit information to support
claims they were undercounted.
   Mayor David Dinkins of New York called the estimate that his
city lost 40,000 people ``unadulterated nonsense'' and pledged to
``comb through the bureau's data to locate those areas where the
count is too low, identifying housing units the bureau overlooked
and buildings it missed entirely.''
   ``Do you really honestly believe everybody who should be counted
was counted?'' Cuomo asked. Answering his own question, the
governor said, ``Of course not. My mother had trouble. She didn't
want to answer.''
   Rep. Vic Fazio of California, chairman of the House Democratic
group monitoring reapportionment, urged local officials to
challenge the preliminary figures.
   ``Now is not the time to be ringing partisan alarm bells,'' said
Fazio. ``But when a Republican administration is on a track leading
us to a less than fair and accurate census count, Democrats must
challenge at every opportunity available.''
   Kimball Brace, president of Election Data Services, a consulting
firm that analyzes census data for Democratic state legislators,
told a news conference that the figures were subject to
considerable adjustment before the government comes out with final
numbers on Dec. 31. Even then, the Commerce Department will have
until July 15, 1991, to determine whether to adjust for an
undercount.
   Brace said he understood the Census Bureau has found up to 4
million additional people but has not yet included them in the
state figures. He said no estimate was available on where those
people are distributed among the states.
   Brace cited Alabama, Louisiana and Tennessee as states where
figures for rural areas were well below earlier estimates.

<HEAD>Dan Rather Holds First U.S. Network Interview With Saddam Hussein
^Eds: SUBS 12th graf pvs, `Two excerpts...,' to UPDATE with 10 p.m.
show airing; report CBS considering a late-night news show to
challenge ABC's ``Nightline.''

<TEXT>
   CBS news anchor Dan Rather got the first U.S.
interview Wednesday with Saddam Hussein, and the Iraqi president
used the forum to repeat his assertion that Kuwait is now part of
Iraq.
   Saddam spoke first with French television and then with Rather,
the first interviews he has granted Western journalists since he
invaded his oil-rich neighbor, prompting a massive U.S. military
buildup in Saudi Arabia.
   CBS said the taped interview lasted 90 minutes and began shortly
after midnight in Baghdad. Rather was told there would be no
interview that day, but suddenly was summoned to the presidential
palace.
   The tape of the interview still was being transmitted from Iraqi
TV facilities to New York when CBS's evening news was on the air in
the Eastern and Central time zones.
   Saddam previously used TV to make his case in the Persian Gulf
crisis by broadcasting two meetings between himself and groups of
his Western hostages.
   ``Kuwait is part of Iraq,'' Saddam told Rather. ``We have said
this, and the legislative bodies in Iraq have issued a clear decree
saying that Kuwait is an Iraqi province.''
   Saddam denied during his CBS interview that Iraq is holding
hostages, even though he has barred Westerners, including
Americans, from leaving the country and put them near military
targets to deter attack.
   When asked by Rather if he expected a U.S. military strike
against him, Saddam, speaking through an interpreter, said, ``We
take this into account and we are prepared on the basis of that
eventuality.''
   But he later added: ``We want the war not to come about, because
if it were to erupt ... it will cause harm to the United States, to
Iraq and to the world.''
   There were no restrictions on what Rather could ask, said CBS
spokeswoman Donna Dees. The only conditions were that Iraqi TV
cameras be used and that it be a one-hour straight interview that
would air as recorded, she said.
   He agreed to let the interview run longer so it could be cut for
translation and minor editing, Dees said.
   Two excerpts first appeared on the ``CBS Evening News,'' and
more was shown during a one-hour special at 10 p.m. EDT Wednesday.
   Parts of the interview also were aired during another special
broadcast at 11:30. That program was the first of a series of
late-night news programs that might evolve into a series to
challenge ABC's ``Nightline,'' The New York Times reported, quoting
unidentified CBS executives.
   The full interview was scheduled to be shown at 2 a.m. EDT
Thursday on ``Nightwatch.''
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who arrived in Baghdad on Wednesday, has
been promised an interview to be shown on the syndicated show
``Inside Edition,'' said the show's executive producer.
   Rather theorized he was granted the interview because of
``proximity and persistence,'' Dees said.

   A West Coast radio station has
joined several East Coast stations in banning songs by Sinead
O'Connor, the Irish singer who refused to perform at a New Jersey
concert if the national anthem was played.
   KGGI-FM said Wednesday it had yanked O'Connor's songs from its
playlist, following the lead of stations in New York and New Jersey.
   The shaved-head singer threatened Friday to walk out on an
audience of 9,000 at the Garden State Arts Center if ``The Star
Spangled Banner'' was played, as it is before every show there.
Organizers relented, fearing trouble if the concert was canceled.
But O'Connor won't be allowed back.
   ``The whole thing is absurd,'' said O'Connor spokeswoman Elaine
Schock. ``A lot of these stations have only played one song of hers
(``Nothing Compares 2 U'') which is basically over as a hit anyway,
and then ban her. Then they go declaring themselves `Sinead-free
Radio.' ''

   Keyboardist Vince Welnick of the rock band
the Tubes will take the place of the late Brent Mydland in the
Grateful Dead.
   Mydland, the psychedelic rock band's keyboardist for 11 years,
died of a drug overdose in July.
   Welnick, 39, has been practicing with the Grateful Dead since
the weekend and will make his first stage appearance with the band
on Sept. 7 in Cleveland.
   ``I woke up one day and I was Dead,'' Welnick said in
Wednesday's San Francisco Chronicle. ``Now I'm Grateful Vince.''
   Published reports said Welnick was one of several keyboardists
who tried out for the Grateful Dead, including Pete Sears, formerly
of the Jefferson Starship; Tim Gorman, who has toured with the Who,
and T. Lavitz of Dixie Dregs.

   A lawsuit accusing Leona Helmsley of taking
millions of dollars from her doddering husband has been thrown out
of court.
   A former Helmsley real estate executive, William R. Miller, had
filed the racketeering lawsuit in September, contending Mrs.
Helmsley's actions had reduced the size of his commissions.
   The lawsuit alleged Mrs. Helmsley diverted a $16 million
apartment building, a corporate jet and more than $90 million in
bonds to circumvent a prenuptial agreement with her real estate
tycoon husband, Harry.
   The transfers were accomplished ``by taking advantage of Mr.
Helmsley's declining mental facilities,'' the lawsuit alleged.
   U.S. District Judge Kenneth Conboy ruled Wednesday that Miller
had no legal standing to sue because he was an ``indirect secondary
victim of these alleged frauds.'' Miller was president of a
Helmsley subsidiary until April.
   Mrs. Helmsley, the 70-year-old queen of the Helmsley hotel
chain, was convicted last year of tax fraud and was sentenced to
four years in prison and fined $7.1 million. She is free while on
appeal.
   Her 81-year-old husband also was charged in the criminal case
but was found mentally incompetent to stand trial.

   Marilyn Quayle was tossed into the
Colorado River during a whitewater rafting expedition through the
Grand Canyon but escaped injury, a park official says.
   The wife of Vice President Dan Quayle fell into the water over
the weekend when the raft hit Lava Falls rapids, one of the
roughest stretches in the river, Chuck Lundy, spokesman for Grand
Canyon National Park, said Wednesday.
   John Reed, assistant superintendent for the park, pulled Mrs.
Quayle back into the raft, Lundy said. She was wearing a life
jacket as required, he said.
   The Quayles were accompanying a U.S. Park Service patrol on a
rafting expedition of several days, said Lundy.

<TEXT>
   With both their parents shipped off
to Saudi Arabia, Tricia and Shaka LaRoche are ``Desert Shield''
orphans, their lives turned upside down by the U.S. military
deployment.
   But Sgt. Carol LaRoche, a 33-year-old transportation specialist
with the 24th Infantry Division at Fort Stewart, Ga., says she was
crying the hardest when she left her teen-agers Monday morning.
   ``I didn't want to leave them, and they didn't want me to
leave,'' she said.
   LaRoche, a Birmingham, Ala. native who now lives in Hinesville,
Ga., is one of scores of military women who have left husbands and
children for an indefinite stay in Saudi Arabia.
   These women don't know when they are going home, and they can't
call.
   The Defense Department has not counted how many women are part
of Operation Desert Shield, which aims to counter any Iraqi threat.
But the numbers far exceed women ever sent on a mission that
potentially could involve combat.
   About 100,000 U.S. troops are in Saudi Arabia, and estimates are
it could go higher.
   Women are barred from combat, but they work in dozens of support
fields _ including as nurses, fork-lift operators, jet maintenance
crews and drivers.
   ``My husband says, `What ever happened to the good old days when
men went to war and the women stayed home?'' said Air Force Lt.
Col. Jane Valentine, a 37-year-old nurse from Goldsboro, N.C.
   Valentine, with the 4th Medical Group of the 4th Tactical Wing,
said she had prepared herself psychologically to be away from
Ashley, her 5-year-old daughter, for up to six months.
   ``I know she is well taken care of,'' Valentine said of her
daughter while in a tent seeking shade from the 107-degree desert
heat.
   For LaRoche, the Saturday call telling her to prepare to leave
was particularly wrenching. Her husband, Wayne, also with the 24th,
had left four days earlier.
   LaRoche said she still had no idea where her husband was or how
she would find him.
   Her children _ Tricia, 16, and Shaka, 15 _ were none too happy
about the situation. They are moving next week to Washington to
live with their grandmother.
   ``He's a very quiet kid, an honor-roll student,'' LaRoche said
of her son.``I don't want him to get in with the wrong crowd.''
   The mortgage on LaRoche's house has been paid through December
and the utilities turned off. If Desert Shield drags on longer,
LaRoche said she will ask a neighbor to help out.
   Military women know to expect the unexpected so they plan ahead
for their children.
   Valentine said her husband, Russ, a pilot, takes care of Ashley,
along with a baby-sitter who has power of attorney.
   Air Force Maj. Kathy Sue Higgins, 33, of Fayetteville, N.C., a
nurse on a medical evacuation unit, said her husband George is the
primary care-giver for 5-year-old Kyle.
   ``He does real well,'' Higgins said of her husband, an arts
administrator. Kyle goes to a day care center most of the day.
   Higgins is used to being away from home. Her job requires her to
travel six months a year. She spent Christmas in Panama during the
U.S. invasion, but she hopes not to spend Christmas 1990 with
``Desert Shield.''
   ``Kyle doesn't like it when I say I have to go work because he
thinks I am going away,'' she said.
   When she returns, Higgins said her son ``clings a lot more.''
   Higgins keeps a picture of Kyle in the medical tent where she
works. Even though she loves her career, she thinks it might be
nice to have a normal job.
   ``I missed his first walking step, his first piano lesson,'' she
said.

   The grisly slayings of five students
have shaken to the core this gracious town in northern Florida that
leans heavily on the University of Florida for its existence.
   ``The community itself is a victim here,'' said Rick Mulligan of
the Gainesville Area Chamber of Commerce. ``You hate to have a
spotlight thrown on you for something like this.''
   The killings have left ``a sick feeling in the community'' but
also instilled ``a sense of cooperation, of community, among the
residents and among the students,'' he said.
   Four women and a man have been found stabbed to death in
off-campus apartments since Sunday, and three of the women were
mutilated, authorities said. Hundreds of students have locked their
doors or run to their parents.
   Gainesville is home to 88,000 permanent residents and 34,000
students, many arriving for the first week of fall classes. The
university and its related facilities employ nearly 30 percent of
the town's work force.
   The university traces its beginnings to the town's founding in
1853 and was formally established in 1906 with an enrollment of 102.
   Historians say that freezes in the late 1800s ended the town's
brief tenure as a citrus-growing center. For generations the town
was virtually dependent on the school for its survival. But since
the 1950s it has developed as a major health-care center and
attracted light industry.
   Four large hospitals, including a veterans' center, provide jobs
for 15 percent of residents.
   ``Our most important industry is education,'' said Mayor
Courtland Collier. But, said Mulligan, ``The community is growing
away from education. We are not as strictly a college town as we
used to be.''
   Community leaders organized a rally Wednesday for ``all those
who are outraged, fearful and in mourning.'' About 100 marchers
wearing black armbands and carrying flowers walked from the campus
to the courthouse.
   ``This series of killings ... is completely foreign to the
city,'' the mayor said Wednesday. ``But it's a time of coming
together for the people. We will survive and we'll be the better
for it. There is no rampant panic in the streets.''
   Alachua County Commissioner Kate Barnes cautioned against the
spread of rumors about gory aspects of the slayings or the motive.
Police said there was no evidence that satanic cults or drugs were
involved in the killings.
   ``Fear and rumors are our worst enemies,'' she said, adding that
the homicides are bad enough ``without macabre imaginings.''

<HEAD>GAO Says Prototype Plant Behind Schedule</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Army is behind schedule and over budget in
its destruction of old chemical weapons, but Congress shares blame
for some of the problems, the General Accounting Office says.
   In a report released Wednesday, the congressional investigative
agency said the Army's prototype disposal facility, now in
operation, is 32 months behind schedule and will cost at least $190
million more than 1985 estimates. Delays also will boost costs of
storing chemical weapons by $33 million.
   The GAO said two laws passed by Congress were largely
responsible for delays and cost overruns, although technical
problems and poor contractor performance also caused problems at
the prototype facility on a Pacific island.
   One of the statutes, adopted in 1985, required destruction of
all U.S. chemical weapons, causing the Army to vastly expand a
program that only was to dispose of M-55 rockets with nerve agents,
the report said.
   In addition, a 1987 law ordered tests to make sure the weapon
destruction did not harm the environment.
   ``Most of the increased estimated cost can be attributed to the
two statutory requirements and the technical and contractor
problems,'' the report said.
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., chairman of the House Government
Operations Committee, said Congress had given the Defense
Department ``more than enough additional time to complete the
task'' despite the program expansion and testing program ordered by
lawmakers.
   Conyers was one of three lawmakers requesting the report on the
facility at Johnston Island in the Pacific Ocean.
   The delays at Johnston are holding up construction of three U.S.
disposal sites that will rely on lessons learned from the island
facility. The sites are at Anniston, Ala.; Pine Bluff, Ark.; and
Umatilla, Ore.
   While full-scale operations at Johnston were originally
scheduled for February 1989, the date has been pushed back 32
months _ to late September 1991, the report said.
   Despite the delay of a full-scale destruction program, an Army
spokesman said Wednesday that the prototype plant began disposing
of its first chemical weapons July 1.
   The spokesman, Lt. Col. Steve Roy, said the Johnston Island
plant has destroyed more than 4,000 pounds of nerve agents and more
than 800 rockets filled with nerve agents in its nearly two months
of operation.
   Existing stocks on Johnston Island and chemical weapons removed
from Europe should be destroyed at the facility by late 1994, he
said.
   Chemical weapons stored at eight U.S. locations are scheduled to
be destroyed in this country by April 30, 1997.
   Before Congress expanded the program, the Army estimated the
original cost of the Johnston facility at $371 million. The new
estimate is $561 million, but the figure would increase with
additional delays, the GAO said.
   The GAO study was requested by Conyers, Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio,
chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee; and Rep.
Earl Hutto, D-Fla., chairman of the House Armed Services
subcommittee on readiness.

<HEAD>Catfish Business Doing Swimmingly</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Catfish farmers are cashing in on a growing
American appetite for something besides red meat and poultry.
   The latest Agriculture Department figures show, however, that
other livestock producers are in no imminent danger of being routed
by legions of catfish trucks headed for city markets.
   According to a report by the department's Economic Research
Service, the U.S. farm-raised catfish industry ``has matured and
now is a major supplier to the national seafood market.''
   By last year, for example, sales of processed catfish had grown
to $372 million from $36 million just a decade earlier.
   ``Catfish ranked only behind pollock, salmon and cod in domestic
landings of finfish species during 1989,'' the agency said in the
September issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine. ``Today,
farm-raised catfish are found in retail outlets across the
country.''
   The surge in catfish production and sales is expected to
continue this year and in 1991. Sales to processors were up 12
percent from a year earlier during the first half of 1990, and
inventories of hatcheries and growers were up 17 percent.
   Mississippi Delta states accounted for 90 percent of last year's
catfish production area.
   ``But farm-raised catfish production now is growing in other
states,'' the report said. ``New processing plants are promoting
production in Florida, Texas and the Carolinas.''
   As of early July, USDA said, the surface area of ponds for
catfish production was up 139 percent from a year earlier in the
Carolinas, 83 percent in Texas and 53 percent in Florida.
   These states account for only about 4 percent of total pond
area, the report said. However, additional pond area probably will
be built because of recent increases in plant processing capacity.
   Despite rising output, catfish prices have remained firm, the
report said. Processors paid an average of 79 cents per pound in
June, up from 75 cents a year earlier.
   According to another USDA report, per capita consumption of fish
and shellfish rose 5 percent in 1989 to an annual average of 15.7
pounds. That was up 4.2 pounds from 1971.
   By comparison, Americans ate an average of 134.7 pounds of red
meat last year, a retail weight equivalent. The total included 68.9
pounds of beef, 63.2 pounds of pork, 1.2 pounds of veal and 1.5
pounds of lamb and mutton.
   Poultry consumption on a per capita basis was 85.8 pounds in
1989, including 66.6 pounds of broilers.

   Rising energy costs prompted by the Mideast
crisis are adding to production expenses this year, but a new
Agriculture Department analysis shows net farm income is still
edging higher than earlier expected.
   ``The Iraq situation pushed the price of crude oil up sharply,''
the report said Wednesday. ``If a price increase of $10 a barrel is
maintained for the remainder of the year, agricultural fuel
expenses in 1990 will be 10 percent higher than in 1989.''
   Earlier, the department's Economic Research Service had forecast
a 5 percent increase in 1990 fuel costs.
   But the report also said net cash income of farmers this year is
expected to be record high, in the range of $59 billion to $63
billion, up about one-tenth from 1989. The previous high was $57.2
billion in 1988.
   The forecast for net cash income had been in the range of $55
billion to $59 billion in recent months.
   As used by the research agency, net cash income ``measures the
value of commodities sold in a calendar year plus government
payments, less out-of-pocket costs.'' Some commodities sold
actually may have been produced in earlier years and stored until
marketed.
   In another method of accounting, the report said net farm income
may be in the range of $47 billion to $52 billion, compared with
the previous forecast of $47 billion to $51 billion. Last year's
was about $47 billion, a downward revision of $2 billion from
previous 1989 estimates.
   Net farm income is used to measure the value of agricultural
production, whether sold or stored, in a calendar year plus
government payments, minus all costs, including depreciation and
other allowances.
   The report said 1990 cash receipts for crops and livestock are
expected to climb by 6 percent to 8 percent from last year. Direct
government payments are down somewhat from 1989, however.
   Cash expenses were forecast to be up 1 percent to 3 percent from
1989. Those include higher costs of fuels, marketing, storage,
transportation and farm rents.
   Overall, the report said, the 1990 balance sheet ``reflects a
strong position for U.S. agriculture'' with rising asset values _
mostly land _ and steady debt.
   The rise in energy prices will have negligible effect this year
on the farm cost of fertilizer and other chemicals ``but will
probably be more pronounced in 1991 because most application is in
the spring,'' the report said.

   The Kuwaitis who fled their country
in the Iraqi invasion may be refugees, but some now call five-star
hotels home.
   They are among the most affluent displaced persons ever.
   A municipal committee in this Saudi city tries to fulfill their
every need, but has balked at requests for massages and visits to
the hairdresser. A birthday cake was approved because it qualified
as food.
   Weeks of living in close proximity to hundreds of strangers is
also beginning to fray on the nerves of some Kuwaitis used to
keeping their families sheltered behind villa walls in their
oil-rich emirate.
   ``It's never happened before that when families fled a country
they lived in five-star hotels,'' said Khaled Al-Rashed, a Kuwaiti
businessman now living in a luxury seaside hotel.
   The Saudi government is picking up the tab for the hotel rooms,
all meals and laundry. It also is distributing between $133 and
$800 to penniless families. Medical care is free, as will be
schooling when it starts next month.
   The center for assisting the refugees is housed in a room at the
Dammam Municipal Building, where operations have dropped from 24
hours a day to 16.
   The committee of municipal workers has registered 80,000
refugees since Iraq invaded on Aug 2. Up to 40,000 more fled to
other parts of the kingdom.
   Committee coordinator Faisal Al-Thani says every available hotel
room, furnished apartment and municipal housing complex as well as
55 schools have been filled with Kuwaiti refugees.
   Those living in the schools have no kitchen facilities so 10
catering firms are delivering 20,000 meals a day.
   For the first two weeks after the invasion, the municipality
served up to 4,000 people lunch and dinner in the entrance hallway
of its municipal building.
   School starts in 20 days, so the committee is furnishing
hundreds of villas and more than 5,000 apartments for the Kuwaiti
families.
   By chance, the municipality had just completed a massive housing
complex for Saudi citizens lacking the land to qualify for one of
the government's $80,000 housing loans.
   One hotel said it sends the city a bill totalling nearly $19,000
a day for the 1,000 Kuwaiti refugees housed there. But no one on
the municipal committee wanted to talk about the cost of taking
care of the refugees.
   ``No one is worried about figuring it out at this point,'' said
committee member Mansour al-Muhana. ``You have to do what you have
to do.''
   Al-Thani said people were signing for all kinds of things at the
hotel, some of which he refused. A birthday cake got by, but a
massage and new hairdo were refused.
   He said many Kuwaiti families fled with two or three Asian
housemaids and the Saudi government paid for 2,000 airplane tickets
to send them home.
   Despite the government grants, some Kuwaitis have been selling
their gold jewelry and cars in order to be able to buy clothes and
their own food.
   The Kuwaitis are grateful to the Saudis, but the constant living
with strangers is beginning to cause tension.
   Workers at one luxury hotel said the police were called in three
times this week to settle arguments, and one Kuwaiti upset over
service in the coffee shop tried to hit the manager over the head
with a Perrier bottle.
   ``Most of them are not happy at the hotel,'' said an assistant
manager, speaking on condition of anonymity. The women and men have
to mix and ``they don't like mixing,'' he said.
   Kuwaiti women staying at one junior college have been asked not
to leave their converted dormitories and school rooms after dark.
   Women traditionally do not wear veils in Kuwait, while those in
religiously orthodox Saudi Arabia are almost always completely
covered in accordance with Moslem tradition.
   The Kuwaiti women were given floor-length abayas to wear, but
this has caused some tension, Kuwaiti men said.
   ``When you were living happily in a house, you have your own
privacy, you will not have your own privacy here,'' said Al-Rashed,
the Kuwaiti businessman.
   The converted schools usually have playgrounds and organized
activities for the children. The Saudis have also distributed
copies of the Koran, the Islamic holy book, and cassettes with
readings from the Koran or Arabic literature.
   There are few activities in the big hotels. Discussing the
situation and watching home videos of the Iraqi invasion and
Kuwaiti resistance are the favorite pastimes.
   ``We have no projects except Kuwait,'' said one man.

<TEXT>
   The National Endowment for the Arts faces a
lawsuit charging that it supported ``hateful, hostile and
anti-religious expression'' with a $15,000 grant for a New York
artist's controversial exhibition.
   The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court on Wednesday by the
Rutherford Institute of Charlottesville, Va., a non-profit legal
services organization, on behalf of Los Angeles lawyer David
Fordyce, who was described as a ``devout Christian.'' It was the
third lawsuit filed in response to the NEA's anti-obscenity policy.
   Fordyce accused the NEA and its chairman, John E. Frohnmayer, of
displaying ``open and notorious hostility toward religion'' in
violation of the First Amendment doctrine of separation of church
and state.
   The suit charges that the NEA-subsidized catalog for ``Tongues
of Flame,'' an exhibit of works by David Wojnarowicz of New York,
includes an image depicting Jesus Christ as an intravenous drug
user.
   The suit says the catalog also includes the artist's reference
to Roman Catholic Cardinal John O'Connor of New York as a ``fat
cannibal'' and ``the world's most active liar about condoms and
safer sex.''
   Fordyce said NEA support for the exhibition and catalog conveys
``a message of hate and animosity toward institutionalized
religion'' endorsed by the federal government.
   He asked the court for a permanent injunction prohibiting the
federal arts agency from ``funding, sponsoring and endorsing works
which promote blasphemous and sacrilegious hate material.''
   The NEA had no comment on the lawsuit.
   The endowment already is the target of separate federal lawsuits
in New York and Los Angeles challenging Frohnmayer's requirement
that NEA grant recipients sign an anti-obscenity pledge as a
condition for receiving federal money.
   Frohnmayer instituted the pledge last November after Congress,
at the urging of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and other conservative
lawmakers, amended the NEA's current $171 million budget to include
a ban on federal support for works that ``may be deemed obscene.''
   Wojnarowicz said by telephone from New York that the NEA had an
``awful track record'' of supporting works by minority artists,
including homosexuals.
   ``If this kind of heat comes from cult or extreme conservative
religious groups over the few coins that finance minority
expression, then this country is in pretty bad shape,'' he said.
   The lawsuit also drew fire from Barry Blinderman, director of
University Galleries at Illinois State University, which used the
NEA grant to mount the ``Tongues of Flame'' show last winter. The
exhibit is currently on display at the Santa Monica Museum of Art
in California.
   At a news conference after he filed the lawsuit, Rutherford
Institute president John W. Whitehead said: ``Religious people must
no longer be the personal targets of cannon fire from National
Endowment projects.''
   In late June, Wojnarowicz won a court battle in New York against
the Rev. Donald Wildmon and his conservative lobbying group, the
American Family Association, which had reproduced fragments of his
works in an anti-NEA pamphlet mailed to members of Congress, church
leaders and media outlets.
   The federal judge in that case ruled that the pamphlet probably
had damaged the artist's reputation and the value of his works, and
ordered its publication halted.

<HEAD>Panel Calls for Diverting Research Funds to Global Warming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About $300 million a year in existing federal
energy research money should be diverted into projects that could
help fight global warming, a panel of scientists says.
   In a 127-page report ordered by Congress, the National Research
Council committee also said Wednesday that the United States should
consider launching a much larger research program to be ready if
concerns about global warming intensify.
   Developing what the panel called ``backstop'' technologies would
cost billions of dollars per year. These are not economically
viable now but could be needed if emissions of carbon dioxide and
other ``greenhouse'' gases have to be cut by large amounts.
   Scientists say atmospheric buildups of carbon dioxide, methane,
nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons and other gases _ mostly from
burning of oil, coal and other fossil fuels _ could cause a
disastrous warming of the Earth's temperature.
   The Bush administration argues that there is still too much
scientific uncertainty to warrant expensive steps, such as a
proposed worldwide ceiling on carbon dioxide emissions.
   The research council's Committee on Alternative Energy Research
and Development Strategies, chaired by David L. Morrison of the IIT
Research Institute in Chicago, was asked to consider what policy
moves should be made if the government decides to take action on
global warming.
   Funds in the Energy Department's current research budget should
be shifted to earmark about $300 million per year for projects to
improve energy efficiency and encouraging adoption of technology
that would cut greenhouse gas emissions, the panel said.
   These steps ``would make sense for other reasons even in the
absence of concerns about global climate change,'' it said.
   The scientists said the Energy Department could reduce spending
on research into fusion power, fossil energy and other projects to
get the money.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins welcomed the report in a
statement, but said the department's current research projects
should not be cut.
   ``Although we agree with the priorities highlighted by this
study, we believe that these priorities should not be met at the
expense of other programs promising substantial, long-term
environmental and energy security benefits,'' Watkins said.
   The committee did not make a precise cost estimate for what it
called an insurance strategy for advanced research into renewable
energy, conservation, nuclear energy and a range of other new ideas.
   ``These alternative technologies would be developed to the level
necessary to understand their costs and impacts if concerns about
greenhouse gas emissions and climate change heighten,'' the panel
said.

<HEAD>Senator Urges Action to Combat Violence Against Women</HEAD>

   Five slayings discovered on a Florida campus
show the need for congressional action to combat a wave of violence
against women, a Senate committee chairman says.
   ``It should not take such a grisly and horrifying incident for
us to act,'' Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., said Tuesday. ``We
already know that young women are disproportionately victimized by
violent crime.''
   Biden said the five murders in Gainesville, Fla., ``dramatize
just how vulnerable America's young women are as they return to
campus.''
   Biden commented as his Judiciary Committee heard two young
victims of ``acquaintance rape'' appeal for help in fighting the
problem.
   The committee released results of a new study made on behalf of
the American Psychological Association that said the chances of any
woman being raped in her lifetime were one in five. It said the
odds of being raped by an acquaintance were one in six.
   ``We are here to debunk the myth that real rape only happens
when a man jumps out of the bushes and attacks an unsuspecting
victim,'' Biden said. ``In fact, rape by someone the victim knows _
usually referred to as acquaintance rape _ is real rape and it is
far more common and may be even more devastating to its survivors.''
   Biden said there is growing support for legislation that would
direct more federal resources into combatting violence against
women.
   Witnesses before the committee included paralegal Christine
Shunk, who has twice been a rape victim.
   In 1984 when she was a college freshman, she was raped while
being escorted home from a fraternity party by a man she believed
to be a friend. Two years later, she said, she was raped at knife
point by a stranger.
   ``I have already been raped twice and I have survived,'' Ms.
Shunk said. ``I do not know how I would survive a third assault
mentally. You see, being raped is like having your whole world
turned upside down.''
   The 25-year-old Coatesville, Pa., woman said she was plagued by
guilt after the first attack because she had agreed to accompany
the young man to his dormitory room to pick up his jacket before he
escorted her home.
   Nicole Snow, 21, of New Canaan, Conn., said that the summer
before her junior year in high school she was raped by a boyfriend
she at first ``thought was my dream.''
   ``I thought he was a popular, caring, wonderful football player
and he seemed crazy about me,'' she said. ``My dream was quickly
shattered. A month after our first date ... he changed my life
forever by brutally raping me.''
   She said that afterward she pretended that it had not happened.
   ``I continued my life robotically, striving socially,
academically and athletically _ but inside there was a crying young
girl,'' Ms. Snow said. ``It took 3{ years until I got the courage
to seek therapy.''

   U.S. officials rushed to Jordan's border with Iraq on Wednesday
to greet Americans leaving Iraq, but no sign emerged that Saddam
Hussein had carried out his pledge to free Western women and
children.
   In New York, 36 Iraqi diplomats and their families left the
country early Thursday after being expelled.
   Two Iraqi Airways flights arrived in Amman, Jordan, from Baghdad
on Wednesday but neither brought Western hostages. And although
U.S. Ambassador Roger Harrison hurried to the border post of
Ruweishid northeast of Amman to help greet Americans, none showed
up.
   ``I have no evidence...indicating that people have been allowed
to leave,'' White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk told reporters in
Washington.
   Iraq has said all women and children who wish to leave must have
exit visas, Britain said Wednesday. Britain also has been told that
each of the foreign embassies must give Iraq a list of their
nationals who wish to leave, said a British Foreign Office
spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In New York, 91 Iraqi men, women and children boarded a Royal
Jordanian Airlines jet that took off for Amman early Thursday.
   The State Department expelled the diplomats in response to a
series of Iraqi moves, including Baghdad's attempt to make the U.S.
Embassy in Kuwait close. It also restricted the travel of the 19
diplomats allowed to remain.
   Also Wednesday, Japan announced an aid package to assist in
multinational efforts to deter Iraqi aggression. Japan plans to
spend $1 billion on medics, transportation and non-lethal aid for
the multinational effort, the top government spokesman, Chief
Cabinet Secretary Misoji Sakamoto, said Thursday.
   A defiant Saddam meanwhile declared in a TV interview Wednesday
that America cannot defeat Iraq, adding, ``I do not beg before
anyone.''
   He told a newsman from French TV station TF1 that ``a victory
for the United States is not realistic.''
   In an interview with CBS News in Baghdad, shot by Iraqi TV,
Saddam declared, ``Kuwait is part of Iraq. . . . The legislative
bodies in Iraq have issued a clear decree saying that Kuwait is an
Iraqi province.''
   NBC and CNN said U.S. agencies, particularly Army Special Forces
troops and the CIA, were helping the Kuwaiti resistance in
hit-and-run attacks on Iraqi occupiers. No U.S. troops were said to
be involved, but Kuwaiti fighters based on the Saudi-Kuwait border
were reported to be getting intelligence, weapons, radios, advice
and instruction from the United States.
   A U.S. diplomatic source confirmed the reports in general terms,
saying, ``We're aware of their action and we're supporting them.''
This source claimed to be unaware of details.
   On Tuesday, the State Department said Iraq took nine more
Americans into custody in Iraq and Kuwait, bringing to 70 the
number rounded up and apparently moved to military installations as
shields against a U.S. attack.
   Nevertheless, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said Wednesday that if Saddam carries out his promise to free the
Western women and children, it will be ``a significant step in the
right direction.''
   As the West waited to see what would happen to its hostages, a
White House official confirmed that the Bush administration
received a secret Iraqi offer to free all captives and withdraw
from Kuwait if certain conditions were met.
   The conditions were that the international trade embargo against
Iraq be lifted and Baghdad be granted access to the Persian Gulf
and sole control of an oil field that dips into Kuwait, according
to Newsday, which broke the story.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
offer was rejected. Saddam told CBS that no such proposal was made.
   Iraq's U.S. ambassador, Mohamed Al-Mashat, officially notified
the State Department on Wednesday of Saddam's decree that all women
and children of foreign nationals would be allowed out of Iraq.
   Al-Mashat told reporters the Americans would be allowed to leave
through Jordan or Turkey, but he gave no timetable for their
departure.
   ``It is not possible administratively that everybody go on the
same day,'' al-Mashat said. He said he did not know whether the
Iraqi government would provide aircraft to facilitate the
departures.
   Cable News Network quoted unidentified Iraqi officials as saying
an Iraqi Airways plane filled with Westerners would leave Baghdad
for Amman Thursday.
   Al-Mashat also said that once Washington assures Baghdad that
the U.S.-led multinational force massing in Saudi Arabia and the
Persian Gulf will not attack Iraq, ``then we are going to let even
men out.''
   Saddam previously offered to free all the roughly 21,000 Western
hostages in Iraq and Kuwait if Washington withdraws its forces from
the region and guarantees the lifting of trade sanctions against
Iraq. The United States rejected the offer.
   About 3,000 Americans were trapped in Kuwait and Iraq on Aug. 2
when Iraqi forces overran its oil-rich neighbor, then annexed it.
The State Department estimates that about 1,000 of them were women
and children.
   On the diplomatic front, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar left for Amman, where he is to discuss the crisis on
Thursday with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz.
   The international trade embargo, designed to force Iraq to end
its occupation of Kuwait, got an important boost from the OPEC oil
cartel.
   OPEC oil ministers approved a plan allowing Saudi Arabia,
Venezuela and other member countries to pump more oil and help hold
down crude prices. One OPEC minister predicted the agreement could
replace 3 million of the 4 million barrels of oil the day that
disappeared from the world market because of the embargos on Iraqi
and Kuwaiti oil.
   That shortfall caused oil prices to skyrocket.
   In an effort to rally the tens of thousands of U.S. soldiers
patrolling the Saudi desert in scorching heat each day, President
Bush on Wednesday gave them a radio pep talk broadcast over Armed
Forces Radio.
   Bush called the Persian Gulf crisis ``one of the toughest
military missions in modern memory'' and told the soldiers they
``stand on the front line against aggression and international
lawlessness.''
   In the first major accident of the U.S. deployment, a cargo
plane headed for the gulf crashed Wednesday after taking off from
Ramstein Air Base in West Germany, killing nine U.S. reservists and
four active military personnel. The plane was carrying medical
supplies, food and aircraft maintenance equipment. The cause of the
crash was under investigation.
   Air Force officials said the reservists had volunteered for duty
to help with the buildup.

<HEAD>Study: Ultrasound Can Replace Amniocentesis for Finding Birth
Defects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ultrasound scans on pregnant women can accurately
detect spinal abnormalties and other severe birth defects without
raising the risk of miscarriage the way amniocentesis does, a study
today concludes.
   When blood tests signal the possibility of spina bifida and
other serious problems, doctors routinely perform amniocentesis, a
test that removes amniotic fluid for analysis. This technique is
generally safe but carries a small risk of triggering miscarriage.
   The new research suggests that ultrasound, which uses sound
waves to take pictures of the fetus and carries no known risk, is
also a highly accurate way of checking for these birth defects.
   ``We may have to modernize our way of thinking,'' said Dr. Beryl
R. Benacerraf, a co-author of the study. ``I wouldn't say that
nobody has to have amniocentesis. But women can choose. They need
to be involved in the decision and given the odds.''
   Pregnant women are frequently given a blood test to check for
elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein. While many things can cause
this protein to be higher than normal, there is a 1 percent chance
that it means the baby has a defect.
   To make sure the fetus is healthy, doctors frequently withdraw a
sample of amniotic fluid with a needle to see if it, too, contains
elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein. Its presence may indicate
spina bifida, abdominal wall malformations and other serious birth
defects.
   In the study, researchers found that if a woman has an elevated
alpha-fetoprotein level and a normal ultrasound scan, there is a
less than one-tenth of 1 percent chance that her baby will have
defects associated with the protein.
   However, if she opts for amniocentesis, there is a half of 1
percent risk that the test itself will terminate the pregnancy.
   Dr. Allan S. Nadel, principal author of the study, noted that
some women may still want to rule out the slight risk of a birth
defect, even if that might also pose a small risk of losing their
pregnancy.
   The study was conducted at Brigham and Women's Hospital in
Boston and published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
   Doctors reviewed the ultrasound findings of 51 fetuses with
spina bifida and related abnormalities that were delivered or
aborted at the hospital. In every case, ultrasound had correctly
identified the birth defects.
   However, the doctors cautioned that ruling out these defects
requires sophisticated ultrasound equipment in the hands of doctors
who are well trained in its use. They said this expertise is
available in most large medical centers.
   Amniocentesis is also frequently recommended for pregnant women
over age 35 to check for Down's syndrome. Ultrasound is not
routinely used to screen fetuses for this birth defect.

<HEAD>Curbside Drug, Explosives Tests Being Developed for Police</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The police officer of the not-too-distant
future may be armed with new, non-lethal weapons: test kits that
turn him into a curbside lab technician, able to determine in
seconds whether a suspect recently handled illegal drugs or
explosives.
   The kits are being developed for the FBI by two contractors and
could be field-tested as early as next month, said Dr. Dean
Fetterolf of the FBI's forensic science research unit in Quantico,
Va.
   The tests use antibodies _ produced in laboratory animals _ to
detect the presence of as little as one-millionth of a gram of the
target substance on skin, desk tops, luggage and other surfaces,
Fetterolf said Wednesday. If the target substance is present, the
antibodies cause a portion of the kit to change color.
   ``Taking laboratory technology from a three-hour analysis with a
trained technician down to a 30-second analysis that can be done by
someone who's not trained as an expert in chemistry or science is
not a trivial task,'' Fetterolf said.
   Fetterolf described the new test gear for drugs _ and similar
new equipment to test for the presence of explosives _ at a news
conference held in conjunction with a meeting of the American
Chemical Society.
   A main feature of the drug tests is that a police officer would
only have to swab the palm of a suspect's hand and add antibody
solution to discover residues of cocaine or heroin.
   ``It's a much less intrusive method of testing for drug use than
the traditional urine test,'' Fetterolf said.
   And, he said, because antibodies are specific to the triggering
substance, other chemicals should not cause ``false positives''
that have plagued many current tests. For example, some urine tests
indicate drug use if the subject has eaten a lot of poppy seeds.
   The tests are calibrated to ignore the tiny but detectible
amounts of cocaine on virtually all the $20 and $50 bills in
circulation, Fetterolf said.
   The drug kits are being developed under a $50,000 contract by
Bio-Metric Systems Inc. of Eden Prairie, Minn. A similar kit for
certain explosives is being developed for $35,000 by Westinghouse
Corp. in Baltimore.
   The first drug test kits, 200 for cocaine and 200 for heroin,
should be delivered next month to the FBI for field tests to
determine if changes are needed, Fetterolf said. Future kits might
be developed for amphetamines and phencyclidine, or PCP, he said.
   Dr. Patrick Guire, Bio-Metric's vice president for research and
development, said the company is ahead of schedule and may ship the
kits early.
   Guire said the kits will be mass-produced and sold either by
Hycor Biomedical of Garden Grove, Calif., with which his company
has a licensing agreement for other antibody tests, or by
Bio-Metric itself.
   Fetterolf predicted each would cost $7 to $8, but Guire said he
expected the cost to be about $5 apiece once mass production begins.
   A sample test kit Fetterolf displayed consisted of three small
tubes of liquids and a plastic container smaller than a matchbook.
   Meanwhile, the FBI soon will receive a prototype of an antibody
test kit for explosives, Fetterolf said.
   ``It's very well documented in the scientific literature that
... someone (who) handles explosives and then picks up a briefcase
will transfer the explosives from the outside of their hand to the
briefcase,'' he said.
   The FBI has a procedure to detect TNT in traces as small as one
part per billion. And an antibody was developed in just the last
few weeks for PETN, a major component of plastic explosives, for as
little as 30 parts per trillion, the FBI scientist said.

<TEXT>
   Double murderer Robert Alton Harris lost a
round in a federal appeals court, moving closer to California's
first execution in 23 years.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 Wednesday that
Harris has no right to a fact-finding hearing on his claim that
psychiatrists at his 1979 trial were incompetent for allegedly
failing to detect a brain disorder.
   ``Harris cannot now obtain a `second bite at the apple' because
he believes a new group of psychiatrists would offer a different
defense,'' the court said.
   Harris, 37, was convicted of the 1978 murders of two San Diego
teen-agers whose car he used in a $3,000 bank robbery. Of the 286
prisoners on California's Death Row, he is the closest to the gas
chamber. No one has been executed in California since 1967.
   Defense lawyers can ask for reconsideration by an 11-judge panel
of the court, a procedure the court has used several times from
other states. It can be authorized by a majority vote of the
court's 27 active judges.
   After that, Harris' only remaining appeal is to the U.S. Supreme
Court, which has ruled against him four times.
   Harris had been set to die April 3 but the execution was blocked
by the appeals court with four days to spare.
   No new execution date has been set.
   Attorney General John Van de Kamp said the case was ``getting
toward the end of the line,'' but he would not speculate on when
Harris might be put to death.
   The American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, which
furnished one of Harris' lawyers, said of Wednesday's decision,
``To rule ... that a man should be put to death without even a
hearing to examine the most essential elements of his defense is a
travesty of justice and must be reversed.''

   While others were still fashioning resolutions,
Margaret Thatcher dispatched military forces to the Persian Gulf to
support Washington in a crisis.
   In the process, the prime minister breathed new life into a
special relationship widely regarded as having been overshadowed by
the rise of Germany and the end of Ronald Reagan's presidency.
   It was natural that Britain, with its vast economic stake in the
Persian Gulf and its historic ties there, should respond more
vigorously than other European countries to Iraq's seizure of
Kuwait.
   That the response came in tandem with President Bush's military
buildup also seemed natural. To Mrs. Thatcher, maintaining the
special relationship with the United States is a pillar of foreign
policy.
   ``Every time you think the special relationship is dead, some
event comes along and brings it back to life,'' said Robert
Skidelsky, professor of international relations at Warwick
University in central England.
   ``There's a whole network, fortified by a common language, that
somehow goes on and that always seems to come into play in a
crisis,'' he said in an interview.
   ``And there's the personal element _ Mrs. Thatcher has found she
can have most influence with the United States from a rather weak
position by being absolutely reliable ... and that pays political
dividends in Washington.''
   The Persian Gulf crisis flies in the face of the fashionable
view in Britain that Mrs. Thatcher has been marginalized by the
upheavals in Europe and her squabbles with the European Community.
   Many analysts argued that with the collapse of the Iron Curtain,
the economic might and strategic position of a united Germany would
eclipse Britain in Washington's eyes. Therefore, they maintained,
Mrs. Thatcher should get on board a united Europe or be squeezed
aside.
   But Europe quickly showed itself unable to produce a swift,
united military response to the Persian Gulf threat.
   Once again, Britain stood alone in backing a risky U.S.
endeavor, just as it stood alone in 1986 in letting the Americans
use British bases for the bombing of Libya.
   No U.S. ally actually refused to help. All 12 European Community
nations supported sanctions against Iraq. France sent its military.
Others sent ships. Turkey sealed an Iraqi oil pipeline.
   Japan promised to help other nations pay for chartered ships and
airplanes to ferry troops and arms to the Persian Gulf.
   But Bernard Reich, professor of political science at George
Washington University in Washington, D.C., maintains that what
Americans will remember is who was actually there: the TV footage
of British Tornado and Jaguar warplanes roaring into Saudi Arabia.
   ``I think the question will be, where were they?'' Reich said in
a telephone interview. ``For example, where were the Italians?
Nobody will blame them, but they are certainly not going to be
rewarded.''
   Opinion polls show strong support for Mrs. Thatcher's action _
83 percent in the first Gallup poll after Britain sent forces to
the gulf. It conflicts sharply with Mrs. Thatcher's otherwise poor
ratings in the popularity polls.
   ``This may well be a Godsend for her,'' said Reich. ``If I were
her campaign manager I would now stress ... the image of a tough
lady prepared to take action for what is right. She and George Bush
are at the center of this _ and I think it is a real portrayal.''
   So far, however, her actions on the Persian Gulf don't seem to
have affected the opposition Labor Party's near 18-month lead in
opinion polls _ now at between eight and 15 points.
   When the crisis ends, ``the main problem is still going to be
the new European security order,'' Mark Fielder, an analyst at
London's Royal United Services Institute, said in an interview.
   ``Then once again, I suspect, the new relationship between
Germany and the United States will reassert itself.''

<HEAD>Rebels Back U.N. Peace Plan, But Cambodian Government Silent</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodian guerrillas have endorsed a U.N.
plan to take over most of the government until free elections, but
the Vietnamese-installed Cambodian authorities haven't yet agreed.
   The communist Khmer Rouge and two non-communist guerrilla
allies, led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk and former premier Son Sann,
endorsed the U.N. plan Wednesday.
   Chances of making the plan stick were strengthened when the
United States, Soviet Union and China _ which bankroll the warring
parties _ all voted in favor Tuesday at a meeting of the five
permanent members of the Security Council.
   The United States supports the two non-communist rebel groups,
China arms the Khmer Rouge and the Cambodian government gets aid
from Soviet-supported Vietnam.
   Vietnam and the United States planned negotiations Friday on
Cambodia, and U.S. diplomats said they would try to persuade Hanoi
to back the plan.
   Analysts in Bangkok, Thailand, believe the Cambodian government
wants to retain interim power and limit the U.N. role to organizing
the balloting.
   The plan by the Security Council's five permanent members _
which also include France and Britain _ would entail the United
Nations' most extensive peacekeeping effort.
   It could involve as many as 20,000 U.N. employees and cost
billions of dollars. Its goal would be to restore peace and
representative government to Cambodia after decades of strife that
have claimed more than a million lives.
   The Khmer Rouge official in charge for foreign policy, Khieu
Samphan, announced in New York on Wednesday that his party ``fully
supports the Statement of the Five Permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council ...''
   ``All the parties of the Cambodian National Resistance,
including the Democratic Kampuchea Party (Khmer Rouge), have
repeatedly expressed their full support for the works of the Five
Permanent Members of the United Nations Security Council and viewed
that the documents successively adopted by them should constitute
the framework of a comprehensive political settlement of the
Cambodian conflict,'' he said.
   The documents by the five Security Council members call for the
world body to ``supervise and control ... if necessary'' five key
Cambodian ministries -- defense, foreign affairs, finance, public
security and information.
   The plan covers:
   _transitional arrangements regarding the administration of
Cambodia during the pre-election period;
   _military arrangements during the transitional period;
   _elections under U.N. auspices;
   _human rights protection;
   _international guarantees that Cambodia will be non-aligned,
neutral and democratic.
   The operation could cost the United Nations up to $5 billion
over one or two years and involve as many as 10,000 peacekeeping
troops and 10,000 civilian personnel, U.S. officials say.
   All the Cambodian factions, including the government of Premier
Hun Sen, are to meet in Jakarta, Indonesia, next month.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978 to oust the Khmer
Rouge, which had tried to transform the country at gunpoint into a
radical agrarian society. During its nearly four-year rule, the
Khmer Rouge was responsible for the deaths of up to a million
Cambodians, mostly by execution or starvation.
   In July, Secretary of State James A. Baker III announced that
Washington, nervous about Khmer Rouge battlefield gains, was ending
its diplomatic recognition of the three-party guerrilla alliance
and would open talks with Hanoi on ending the war.
   The United States had previously followed the position taken by
the United Nations and most of the world of recognizing the
resistance alliance as Cambodia's legitimate government.

   Police Chief Mack Vines today faced renewed calls
to resign after being charged with lying to a panel investigating
the fatal shooting of an unarmed man by an officer.
   ``Humpty Dumpty is broken and I don't think there's any
reasonable way of putting that all together again,'' said City
Councilman Jerry Bartos.
   Prosecutors on Wednesday charged the chief of the 2,400-member
police force with seven counts of perjury, each carrying up to 10
years in prison.
   District Attorney John Vance refused to detail the allegations
against Vines. He said the charges will be presented to a grand
jury on Sept. 10.
   City Manager Jan Hart named an acting chief and said Vines, 51,
who was appointed in 1988, will remain off the job. He was
suspended Aug. 3 and has been dogged by calls for his resignation
for his part in the slaying probe.
   Vines said he welcomed the involvement of a grand jury.
   ``I am confident that they will make a just decision,'' he said
in a statement.
   City Councilman Glenn Box said the charges would hamper Vines'
leadership ability, and the Dallas police union president, Monica
Smith, reiterated ``that we would like his resignation
immediately.''
   ``I think it would be nearly impossible for Chief Vines to lead
this police department with the confidence of the city into the
future,'' Bartos said.
   During his tenure, Vines angered veteran officers, who accused
him of favoring minorities in hiring and in his dealings with the
public. He won the support of minority leaders, who now claim he is
being persecuted. Vines is white.
   The perjury charges stem from the fatal shooting last year of a
Mexican by Officer Patrick LeMaire. Vines fired LeMaire 17 days
after the killing.
   An administrative law judge who said Vines failed to justify the
firing reinstated LeMaire last month. During the administrative
hearing, an internal affairs detective testified his initial report
on the shooting was altered.
   That led the city manager to appoint a three-member panel to
look into the detective's allegations and the speed with which
LeMaire was fired.
   Ms. Hart suspended Vines and Holliday after Holliday told her
Vines called him at home the night before and tried to persuade him
to downplay his testimony about the speed of Vines' firing of
LeMaire.
   The panel decided the haste ``created a frenzied atmosphere
conducive to mistakes'' and said that cast suspicion on LeMaire's
suspension.
   Prosecutors said Holliday was helpful in the investigation, and
Ms. Hart lifted his suspension Wednesday.
   Sam Gonzales, 49, a 26-year veteran officer, was named acting
chief.

<HEAD>Woman Who Imported Over Quarter Pound Of Heroin Walks Free</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman caught with more than a
quarter pound of pure heroin she brought from Thailand walked free
today after a judge accepted that it was for personal use.
   Vivien Kay Stevenson, 32, wept as Judge David Jones gave her an
18-month suspended sentence that includes provisions for two years
of drug testing.
   Outside Melbourne County Court, lawyers noted she probably would
have faced a life jail term if she had been arrested in Thailand.
   Ms. Stevenson was arrested by customs officials after a Qantas
flight from Bangkok to Melbourne on Dec. 12. She had pleaded guilty
to importing 4.7 ounces of the drug.
   Jones said that at first glance, it seemed inconceivable that
such a large quantity of heroin _ with a street value of about
$250,000 _ was merely for personal use.
   However, he said after hearing extensive evidence, he was
satisfied Ms. Stevenson was stupidly and naively caught up in the
drug world.
   She had visited Thailand several times to get stock for a
handicraft business, and had bought some marijuana for personal
use, Jones said. When marijuana was unavailable, her supplier had
offered heroin, which she smoked.
   Ms. Stevenson said she planned to discard any unused heroin, but
decided to take it to Australia after learning she had family
problems, the judge said.

<HEAD>In Gainesville, There's Safety in Numbers, But Also Fear</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER SULLIVAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Numbers quantify the fear: eight or
even 10 to an apartment for safety, 4,000 worried calls to a crisis
hotline, dozens of pleas for street lamps, 90 officers on this
small city's streets.
   Five students dead.
   The toll of an apparent serial killer has changed the way
everyone lives, students at the University of Florida and others
said Wednesday.
   Thousands of lights stay on all night, unknown numbers of
weapons have come out.
   ``I stayed at a friend's apartment last night and we had eight
people there,'' said Linda Helton, 20, a junior from West Palm
Beach. ``We had eight baseball bats, and we had knives and we had
things blocking the doors.''
   Todd Silberman, who said 10 people ``crammed in together'' in a
one-bedroom apartment, has seen many people carrying weapons.
``Some have pistols. A lot are carrying knives,'' he said.
   The business at Sapp's Pawn and Gun shop a few blocks from
campus bore him out.
   ``Yesterday was probably the busiest day we ever had,'' said
Butch Ford, who's been in the business for about 30 years. ``But
we've never had five murders in Gainesville before.''
   He sold everything from .38-caliber revolvers to shotguns to
``women, men, college students, little old ladies.'' He wouldn't
say how many.
   Fear was a salesman, too, for Gainesville Regional Utilities,
where up to three dozen requests for street lamps came in, and more
for street lamp repairs.
   Installations are being expedited. ``Because of the situation,
the murders, we're trying to get it done in two to three days,''
said customer service manager Linda Smart.
   Porch bulbs, floodlights, even interior lamps burn at homes all
night.``I went home last night and I've never seen so many lights
on in this town,'' said John Babb, owner of the Gainesville Gym.
   His is one of many businesses that would normally be busy as a
new semester starts. Like others, he complained sales are off
substantially because many students have packed and left campus.
   ``My door traffic's down about 20 percent,'' he said. ``It's off
30 to 40 percent after dark.''
   On a normal night, the hotline run by the Alachua County Crisis
Center gets 150 calls. ``We've handled 4,000 calls in the last 24
hours,'' director Marshall Knudson said Wednesday.
   The period he described began as people were learning that a
fourth and fifth body had been found and that one of the victims
was a man.
   ``Not 50 percent of the population, but 100 percent was at
risk,'' said Knudson, a psychologist, describing callers' feelings.
``And maybe it was even more random.''
   As the level of fear rose, so did the rumors that callers sought
to verify or, better, to have debunked.
   Many rumors were about additional bodies found. Others
apparently grew out of news reports that some victims' bodies were
mutilated.
   ``It's like, what's the worst thing you can imagine?'' Knudson
said.
   Marty Rogers was one of those answering the hotline. Early
Wednesday, as phones buzzed in the background, he described the
callers: ``A lot of scared kids. A lot of scared everybody.''
   ``We have a city here with a lot of anxiety,'' Police Chief
Wayland Clifton said. ``On the other hand, I see people pulling
together. ... I haven't seen people building fortresses. I haven't
seen a mass exodus.''
   He offered numbers of his own to describe the fear. His
department has received up to 1,400 calls per hour. And with the
addition of state troopers and others called in, the force has
nearly quadrupled.
   ``On a typical evening we'd have about 25 officers on the
street. Right now, we've got about 90,'' the police chief said.
   The sight of patrol cars and traffic stops is common around town.
   ``It is an imposition. An officer walks up with a .45 on his
hip,'' Clifton acknowledged. But he said it's necessary for the
investigation, and even those stopped understand.
   The city and the university police came in for some criticism at
a march and rally Wednesday evening sponsored by the local chapter
of the National Organization for Women and the Gainesville Women's
Health Center.
   Speakers also echoed the call to courage on one marcher's sign,
which said simply: ``We are not afraid.''
   Another read: ``I Am Armed and Angry.'' It was carried by Fran
Alshouse, who said she sleeps with a semi-automatic pistol on her
pillow. ``It feels good,'' she said. She was one of 100 or so
people who made the march.
   In the avalanche of numbers that the tragedy has brought, the
only number missing is 1.
   ``Nobody,'' said student Linda Helton, ``is by themselves
anymore.''

<HEAD>FCC Official: TV Stations May Have to Give Jackson Opponents Equal
TIme</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Washington-area TV stations that show Jesse
Jackson conducting interviews in the Middle East may have to grant
equal time to Jackson's political rivals, a federal official says.
   Jackson is attempting this week to interview Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein and American hostages for the syndicated television
program ``Inside Edition,'' which is broadcast on the local
NBC-owned station, WRC-TV.
   Jackson is a candidate for the District of Columbia's U.S.
Senate ``shadow'' seat, an unpaid lobbyist post for D.C. statehood.
   News programs can claim exemption from federal equal opportunity
_ commonly known as equal time _ rules if candidates are the
subjects of bona fide newscasts, documentaries or other types of
legitimate news events.
   But because Jackson will be an interviewer and not an
interviewee, a station probably could not claim such an exemption,
said Milton Gross, chief of the Federal Communications Commission's
fairness-political programming branch.

<HEAD>Students, Parents Not Aware of College Costs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parents and students who inaccurately estimate
college costs and fail to draw on all available sources of
assistance may be ``prematurely slamming the door'' on higher
education, says Sen. Edward M. Kennedy.
   The Massachusetts Democrat, who chairs the Senate Labor and
Human Resources Committee, commented Wednesday on a General
Accounting Office report that said a review of nine studies and a
GAO analysis found students in grades 10 through 12 knew little
about federal financial aid.
   The studies generally revealed that parents had little idea of
college costs. Most parents greatly overestimated costs or offered
unrealistically low estimates, ranging from a low of $2,000 to a
high of $60,000 a year.
   Pell grants, the largest aid program, are available to all who
qualify. But a 1988 study by the Council for Advancement and
Support of Education found 49 percent of the high school students
polled incorrectly believed they were ineligible for aid to attend
an expensive private school if their parents could afford a state
school.
   One-third of those polled also incorrectly believed financial
aid is set aside solely for minority students, and almost a quarter
incorrectly believed that students with average grades don't
qualify for financial aid.

<HEAD>Attacks on Academic Freedom Increase, Report Says</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ Right-wing extremists are igniting ``an explosion''
of censorship attempts in the public schools, but their success
rate is slipping as school officials learn to handle the
challenges, an advocacy group says.
   ``Our research suggests that when censors encounter no
resistance from the community, they prevail,'' said Arthur J.
Kropp, president of People for the American Way, a liberal
organization that focuses on constitutional liberty issues.
   ``When they are met head on, they generally lose.''
   The group said Wednesday it had documented 244 attacks on
academic freedom across the nation in the 1989-90 school year _ up
from 172 incidents it cited in 1988-89.
   This year's total was the highest since the group began its
annual survey in 1982, but it probably represents only a fraction
of all the incidents that occurred, the report said.
   ``From novels to television programs to fine art to music to
movies to textbooks, we are witnessing an explosion of censorship,
an explosion sparked by the match of far right and religious right
intolerance,'' Kropp said.
   But the report also said only about one-third of the censorship
attempts succeeded this year, while the others were rejected by
principals, school boards or other officials.
   In 1988-89, about 50 percent of the attempts succeeded.

<HEAD>27 States To Conduct Sobriety Checks, Survey Says</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ Drivers in 27 states may be stopped at Labor Day
weekend sobriety checkpoints, says a private group that surveyed
law enforcement agencies nationwide.
   The proliferation of such roadside checkpoints follows a
February Supreme Court ruling that allowed random checks for
drunken drivers.
   The American Alliance for Rights and Responsibilities, a new
group that supports checkpoints, said it contacted public safety
officials in every state by telephone. The organization had written
all governors urging a start of the program this weekend.
   The 20 states without plans for sobriety checks said they would
step up patrols to catch drunken drivers during the weekend, said
Roger Conner, alliance president. Three states _ Hawaii, Iowa and
Nebraska _ failed to respond to the survey, he said.
   Four states _ Louisiana, Michigan, Oregon and Vermont _ have
ongoing litigation or court rulings based on state constitutions
that prohibit checkpoints, Conner said.
   Police checking motorists for drunkenness generally have to
delay a driver for only about 90 seconds, he said.
   The court ruled that the minimal intrusion for law-abiding
motorists is outweighed by the benefit of preventing drunken
driving. Alcohol figured in about half of the 46,000 traffic
fatalities last year.

<TEXT>
   Don't worry, Mom and Dad: Surprisingly few
schoolchildren trade the fruit in their lunch boxes for Twinkies.
Take the kids' word for it.
   Of 400 children ages 6-12 queried in a nationwide Gallup poll in
August, 77 percent said they eat the fruit their parents pack for
them. Five percent said they trade or throw it away. Others said
that what they do depends on the fruit.
   It could be that there is simply less junk food to trade for.
   The survey, commissioned by the Florida Department of Citrus,
found that 57 percent of 414 parents who were polled said they pack
fruit daily in lunch boxes. Four percent of parents said they never
packed fruit.
   In addition, 27 percent of the parents said the lunches they
pack are healthier than lunches their own parents gave them, and 85
percent said they would like to eat what they pack for their
children's lunches.
   Leann Birch, a University of Illinois professor who has
specialized in children's eating habits for 15 years, thinks the
popularity of fruit is not surprising, and said children tend to
choose familiar foods over novel ones.
   ``I think most kids like fruit. Fruit is very high in sugar, and
sweetness is one of the things we come into the world liking,'' she
said in a telephone interview.
   ``If you expose a child to fruit and not as much to Twinkies,
for example, other things being equal, you'll find the child will
develop a liking for fruits.''
   Apples, followed by oranges and bananas, were the fruit most
often packed in lunches and the fruit children perceived as
healthiest. The children said they have fruit an average of 3.45
times a week.
   The lack of lunchroom wheeling and dealing may be due to
parents' increased awareness of healthy foods, said Vicki Lansky,
author of several books about food and children.
   ``I think probably more people are putting more apples in
there,'' she said from her office in Deephaven, Minn.
   Among the survey's other findings:
   _ Virtually all the children said they usually get a sandwich in
their lunches.
   _ Asked what drinks they would include in their favorite
lunches, 60 percent of the children picked soda or Kool-Aid.
However, milk was the most common beverage they got for lunch,
mentioned by 26 percent of the respondents.
   _ Asked what they'd pack in a healthy lunch, the children
selected, in order, fruit, sandwiches, potato chips and milk.
   _ When parents include treats in lunches, 45 percent said they
pack cookies, followed by snack cakes and chips.
   The survey screened out children who buy lunch at school, and
had a margin of error of 4.9 percentage points.

   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rebounded
Thursday with the announcement by Japan's central bank of an
increase in the official discount rate, traders said. The dollar
fell slightly.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 775.17
points, or 3.11 percent, closing at 25,669.96. The index shed
815.97 points on Wednesday.
   The dollar closed at 144.10 yen, down 0.25 yen from Wednesday's
close of 144.35 yen. After opening at 143.60 yen, the currency
ranged between 143.60 yen and 144.40 yen.
   The Bank of Japan announced early Thursday it was raising its
official discount rate by 0.75 percentage points to 6 percent a
year to stem inflationary pressure caused by rising oil prices
since the Persian Gulf crisis began.
   Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno told a news conference
Thursday morning the action was an attempt to hold down inflation
and to contribute to stability in the nation's financial markets,
which have swung dramatically in reaction to events since Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Many market participants already had taken the interest rate
hike into account, they said.
   ``The central bank action will eliminate a negative factor
prevailing for some time in the market,'' said Arihiro Totsuka, an
analyst with Nomura Securities. He was referring to rises in other
interest rates, such as long-term interest rates, in Japan in
recent months.
   In the currency market, market participants reacted calmly to
the central bank's decision because it already had factored into
the bank's measure.
   ``There was little effect on the exchange market,'' said Akihiko
Kagawa, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, who said the discount rate
hike ``just followed the prevailing interest rates.''
   North Sea Brent crude oil for October delivery was valued at
$25.00 a barrel, compared to approximately $26.50 in London late
Wednesday.
   In bond markets, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bond rose to 83.06 points, up from the previous
day's close of 82.33. The yield stood at 8.100 percent, down from
8.275 percent.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International passengers at 15 U.S. airports
routinely waited two hours or more to clear customs this summer and
government action is needed to correct the problem, said the
president of an airline trade association.
   One example, said Robert Aaronson of the Air Transport
Association, was an incident last Sunday in which passengers on a
Swissair flight from Zurich had to wait five hours to get out of
the Los Angeles terminal.
   While the Swissair passengers were delayed longer than most,
such ``inhumane inconveniences'' are becoming more common, said
Aaronson, whose group represents air carriers.
   Airlines and airports lose money because of the delays, said
Aaronson and other aviation officials who held a Wednesday news
conference. Angry passengers complain about being kept waiting on
planes because of full customs areas, backed-up flights and other
problems, they said.
   ``That's some welcome mat for millions of tourists who visit our
country each year,'' Aaronson said. The problem has become so
serious that it is likely to start discouraging tourism, he said.
   Industry officials proposed that a current $5 immigration charge
be extended to travelers from Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean who
are currently exempt. The additional $80 million could pay for
1,200 additional inspectors, they said.
   Aaronson's group, the Airport Operators Council International
and the Travel Industry Association are proposing that Congress
require federal inspection agencies to abide by a 45-minute maximum
processing standard established by the International Civil Aviation
Organization.
   ``Obviously, the United States is nowhere near meeting it at
peak travel time,'' Aaronson said.
   The groups also recommended that the administration allow more
inspection of arriving passengers at foreign airports before they
depart, extend a visa waiver program with a decrease in the amount
of paperwork passengers are required to fill out and set up a
government-industry task force to look at a model program for
clearing passengers at a U.S. airport.
   Airport immigration operations blamed for the worst delays this
summer included those at Boston Logan; Chicago O'Hare; Minneapolis;
Charlotte, N.C.; New York Kennedy; Newark; Miami; Houston;
Dallas-Fort Worth; Seattle; Portland, Ore.; San Francisco; Los
Angeles; Honolulu; and San Juan, Puerto Rico.

   Diplomats and their families expelled from the
United States when the Bush administration ordered the Iraqi
embassy in Washington to reduce it staff left the United States
early today.
   A Port Authority spokesman said the 91 men, women and children
left from Kennedy International Airport at 12:28 a.m. EDT on a
Royal Jordanian Airlines flight. They were headed for Amman, Jordan.
   The State Department on Monday ordered Iraq to reduce its
embassy staff by 36. Strict travel limits were imposed on the 19
diplomats allowed to remain in the United States. The directive was
in response to Iraq's order to close the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait,
which the United States has refused to obey. The expelled diplomats
and their families were given until today to leave the country.
   Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and annexed the oil-rich emirate
six days later.
   Shortly before 11 p.m. Wednesday, the Iraqi families were led
down a long corridor in the airport terminal and onto the waiting
plane. Two small children in the lead flashed a peace sign at
reporters and photographers.
   Many of the others smiled and clutched mementos of American
life. One child held a large doll. A mother carried an ``Oopsie
Daisy'' doll in a box.
   The Iraqis were escorted by FBI agents and State Department
officials who kept reporters from talking to members of the group.
   One federal official, who asked not to be identified, said the
Iraqis were ``a very happy group'' who ate pizza and drank sodas
and coffee as they waited for the flight. The plane left more than
2{ hours late because of bad weather.

<HEAD>Study: Despite U.S. Plan, Latin American Debt Still Swelling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HAROLD OLMOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Latin American debtor nations failed
to honor $18 billion in financial obligations last year as the
region's foreign debt continued to climb despite efforts to curb
it, a new study says.
   By the end of last year, 27 Latin American nations had a
combined foreign debt of $434.6 billion, including $6.45 billion
owed by communist Cuba, according to the study by the Caracas-based
Latin American Economic System.
   That amount is 1.5 percent higher than 1988's total of $427.5
billion, the study said.
   The Latin American Economic System, the only regional
organization that includes Cuba, issued the document in preparation
for a ministerial meeting to be held in Caracas next week.
   Since its formation in 1975 as a forum for Latin American
countries to debate economic issues, the organization has focused
on discussing foreign debt problems and promoting regional economic
integration.
   Next week's meeting also is scheduled to discuss President
Bush's initiative to create a continental free-trade zone. The
initiative, launched in June, has been welcomed warmly by most
Latin American leaders. The meeting will be the first time the
region debates the plan collectively.
   But debt still remains Latin America's main concern.
   Since the outbreak of the debt crisis in 1982, Latin American
nations paid creditors, mostly U.S. banks, more than $250 billion.
But in new loans during the same period they barely received $50
billion, the survey says.
   Debt represents 50.9 percent of the region's total domestic
product and is almost three times the value of all regional exports
combined in one year.
   Interest payments alone represented 23 percent of the region's
annual export revenue last year, the study says.
   Debts among Latin American nations also are a problem. Latin
American nations owe each other $11 billion. The main creditor
nations are Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Venezuela, also the
region's most indebted countries, the study found.
   Despite debt-relief programs such as one by U.S. Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady, Latin American financial horizons are
still stormy, the study said.
   The organization called Brady's plan a significant step but
insufficient. So far only Mexico, Costa Rica and Venezuela have
completed refinancing programs under the proposal.
   Brady's plan offered incentives for U.S. commercial banks to
write off some of their $1.3 trillion in Third World debt, but did
not address the debt owed to the governments of the United States
and other industrial nations.
   Bush in June unveiled a plan to forgive part of $12 billion owed
by Latin American and Caribbean nations to the U.S. government. He
said the United States would work with Western European nations and
Japan to channel up to $300 million annually to Latin America to
spur foreign investment.
   Most economic indicators place the region in a critical
financial situation, the study says.
   While nine countries could not meet their financial obligations
and overdue amounts totaled $18.01 billion last year, only eight
could service their debt regularly, it says.
   Countries overdue and the amounts they owed were Brazil, $5.84
billion; Argentina $3.25 billion; Ecuador, $1.19 billion; Peru,
$5.86 billion; Panama, $733 million; Costa Rica, $400 million;
Dominican Republic, $379 million; Bolivia, $248 million; and
Paraguay, $107 million.
   Chile, Colombia, Jamaica, El Salvador, Mexico, Trinidad and
Tobago, Uruguay and Venezuela were able to service their debt
regularly, the study says.

   After a 20-year battle, an inventor with the
habits of a monk has received a patent that could make him a rich
man, assure him a place in the history of the Information Age _ and
spell trouble for the computer industry.
   Gilbert Hyatt, a 52-year-old engineer, received the patent July
17 for a single-chip computer he invented in 1968.
   The patent appears to cover chips in everything from pocket
calculators to cars to phones to electronic dishwashers. But
experts disagreed on whether it applies to all microprocessor chips
and millions of personal computers based on them.
   Hyatt, who lives in suburban La Palma, battled with the U.S.
Patent Office for two decades before he was granted the patent, but
didn't even crack open a bottle of wine when he learned of the
decision.
   ``I don't have time to do anything like that,'' he said
Wednesday. ``I have a lot of R-and-D work to do. And I don't
drink.''
   Hyatt, who doesn't smoke either, works 14 hours a day, seven
days a week. He doesn't take vacations.
   He said he hopes to negotiate licenses under which electronics
companies will pay him royalties for using his invention. But any
money will go toward expanding his laboratory near his home and
perhaps hiring researchers, a departure from his solitary work
habits, he said.
   The patent appears broad enough to affect many companies, said
Roger Borovoy, who was general counsel at Santa Clara-based Intel
when it received microprocessor patents in 1973.
   ``It spells trouble,'' Borovoy said.
   Daniel L. Klesken, an analyst for Prudential Bache Research,
said that a 0.5 percent royalty on computer giant Intel Corp.'s
yearly revenues would yield $15 million. A 2 percent royalty would
bring him $60 million. The comparable figures for Motorola Inc. are
$7 million and $28 million, he said.
   Experts, however, predicted Hyatt would face a stiff fight from
big companies that hold patents on chips.
   ``Twenty years after the fact, it's going to be hard for him to
collect anything right away,'' said Tim Bajarin, an industry
consultant in Santa Clara.
   Placing the power of a computer on a single chip of silicon
allowed the invention of the pocket calculator, the personal
computer and numerous other products.
   The invention of the microchip is frequently credited to a team
of Intel engineers that included Ted Hoff, Federico Faggin and Stan
Mazor. They began working on the idea in 1969, although Intel's
chip wasn't shipped until 1971. Texas Instruments Inc. also entered
the market in the early 1970s.
   Intel spokesman Gordon Casey said lawyers for the company still
were studying the 80-page patent document to determine what it
covers.
   Hyatt began working on the technology at Micro Computer Inc.,
which he founded in 1968. The company grew to about 25 employees
before going out of business in 1971, he said.
   ``The work I did at Micro Computer Inc. is the forerunner of the
PCs,'' Hyatt said. ``I don't know if all PCs are using the same
technology in the patents, but they sure stem from the work I did.''
   He said he is not bitter about seeing his invention widely used
without financial gain to him in the years since he filed his
claim, and he will not seek retroactive payments. ``That's how
business works,'' he said.
   The biggest loser, he said, has been the industry. ``Keeping me
poor and tight has kept really marvelous technology out of the
market,'' he said.
   Bajarin said the patent assures Hyatt a place in computer
history.
   ``He can lay claim to being a forefather of the processor,''
Bajarin said. ``I was made aware of this case over 10 years ago.
Our comment was at that time, `Show us a patent.' Well, now he's
got the patent.''

<HEAD>Blood, Broken Bones _ Inmates' Version of Fight</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Inmates at Rikers Island jail said guards lined
them up and bludgeoned them with nightsticks in a melee that left a
corridor spattered with blood and several prisoners with fractured
skulls and other broken bones.
   A state watchdog panel in Albany backed up the prisoners'
allegations, ruling that the guards used excessive force in putting
down an uprising Aug. 14.
   The uprising began as guards demanding more authority to use
force were ending a two-day blockade of the jail that left the jail
shortstaffed.
   Guards claimed they struck the inmates in self-defense during
the uprising, but the inmates, shouting through glass partitions to
reporters touring the jail Wednesday for the first time since the
incident, told a different story.
   ``It was horrible, horrific, brutal,'' said Victor Lantey, 50,
chairman of the inmate council. ``I saw heads busted, eyes swollen
up, ribs broken. It was excessive.''
   Lantey said there was ``a massive amount of blood in the
corridors.''
   Charges that inmates destroyed property were trumped up to
explain the injuries the prisoners suffered, other council members
said.
   The hallway was clean and freshly painted Wednesday.
   Corrections Commissioner Allyn Sielaff, who took over the city
jail system in March, declined to comment on the allegations of
brutality because the riot is being investigated by the city
Department of Investigation.
   Correction officials also revealed a shakeup in command. A new
warden and deputy warden were brought in last week at the sector
where the melee occurred.
   William McMahon, chairman of the state Commission on Correction,
said 144 inmates and 18 guards were injured in the melee. Two or
three inmates required neurosurgery.
   Some prisoners suffered defensive injuries like broken arms and
skull damage, he said.
   ``Correction officers used force that was far in excess of what
was reasonable and necessary to establish control of inmates and
defend themselves,'' McMahon said. ``The numbers of officers and
inmates injured, and the nature of their injuries, are grossly
disproportionate.''
   Other inmates handed reporters copies of their infraction
notices from that night _ forms filled out by guards detailing
alleged inmate wrongdoing. An inmate charged with smashing windows
was subdued with ``batons, body holds, punches ... all parts of
body,'' one form said.
   ``I got hit with a nightstick so hard they nearly tore my finger
off,'' said Ronald King, 30, holding up his bandaged right hand.
   King said he was standing with his hands on his head when a
guard smashed him with the stick. The inmates had been forced from
their beds on an upper floor by tear gas and by the guards, he said.
   Whitaker, 35, said the first indication the inmates had of an
impending assault was when guards began moving through the cells,
taking blankets, coats and other items they could use to absorb any
blows.

   An unemployed man angered by a
neighbor's tauntings about his receiving welfare shot and killed
the man today, then killed four other people before surrendering,
police said.
   Paul Anthony Evers, 35, was charged with five counts of murder
following the shootings in the public-housing apartment building
where he lived.
   The inner-city neighborhood is within walking distance of
Sydney's central business district.
   Evers entered no plea in Central Local Court and did not seek
bail. His next court appearance is scheduled for Sept. 6.
   Police said that after the shootings, he laid down the shotgun,
went to a nearby store to buy cigarettes and a soft drink then
surrendered to officers after heading back to his apartment.
   Police Prosecutor Sgt. Brett Longville said in court that Evers
told officers his actions resulted from a buildup of tension with
other residents of the building.
   Police said Evers was unemployed and receiving welfare payments.
   Police quoted Evers as telling detectives that a neighbor
telephoned, waking him, and called him a ``dole bludger,'' a slang
term for someone who is unemployed, on welfare and making no effort
to find a job.
   According to Longville, Evers said he got out of bed, dressed,
pulled on a mask and armed himself with a 12-gauge shotgun. He then
confronted the man. After a brief conversation, he allegedly fired
a single shot at the man's head.
   The court was told he returned to the apartment he shared with a
24-year-old woman and killed her with three shots, then killed
three other residents of the apartment building.
   Neighbor Annette McDonald said she heard three or four shots as
she was walking out of her apartment to rake the garden.
   ``It was just the shots. No screaming, no arguing,'' she said.

   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange jumped
today as Japan's central bank boosted its official discount rate by
0.75 percentage points. The dollar dipped slightly in moderate
trading.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose 775.17
points, or 3.11 percent, closing at 25,669.96. The index shed
815.97 points on Wednesday.
   A total of 530 million shares changed hands on the market's
first section, up from 430 million shares on Wednesday.
   The Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank, raised its
official discount rate early today to 6 percent to cool
inflationary pressure caused by rising oil prices linked to the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno told a news conference the
action was also taken to stabilize the nation's financial markets,
which have swung dramatically in reaction to events since Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``The measure will help break the trend toward higher interest
rates,'' said Yozo Asai, an analyst with Yamaichi Securities.
   Asai said the bank's measure would be effective unless the
situation in the Middle East deteriorates, since the nation's
overall economy remained good.
   A dealer with Nomura Securities said the index's rebound came as
investors hunted for incentive-backed issues.
   In the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 144.10 yen,
down 0.25 yen from Wednesday's 144.35-yen finish. It opened at
143.60 yen and ranged between 143.60 yen and 144.40 yen.
   Spot volume totaled about $13 billion.
   Exchange dealers said the market reacted calmly to the central
bank's decision to raise its key lending rate because the step had
been already factored into the day's trading.
   Tadashi Saeki, a dealer with Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank, said the
bank action had been digested in the Sydney market before Tokyo
began trading.
   He said the dollar was affected by cross trading, in which
traders bought the yen by selling European currencies.
   In bond dealings, the price of benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds closed higher at 83.00 points from
Wednesday's close of 82.33. Their yield was 8.120 percent, down
from 8.275 percent Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, North Sea Brent crude oil for October delivery was
valued at $25.10 to $25.20 a barrel in Tokyo, compared with $25.01
to $25.15 late Wednesday in New York.

   A cult leader risks the death penalty
after being convicted of murdering a family of five at a communal
farm in what disciples said was a soul-cleansing ritual.
   Jeffery Lundgren, 40, was found guilty Wednesday of murder and
kidnapping in the 1988 slayings. Earlier in the day, his wife,
Alice, was sentenced to five consecutive life terms in prison for
her part in the murders.
   Dennis Avery; his wife, Cheryl, and daughters, ages 7, 13 and
15, were slain at the Lundgrens' rented farm in Kirtland, 30 miles
east of Cleveland. They were lured one at a time to a barn, gagged,
shot and dumped in a common grave. The bodies were found in January.
   Fellow cult members testified that the Averys, who also were
members of the cult, were slain in a purification ritual in hopes
of witnessing the return of Christ.
   Defense lawyers admitted Lundgren shot the family but said he
was guided by his interpretation of the Scriptures.
   Prosecutor Steven LaTourette said after the verdict, ``I noticed
Mr. Lundgren was smiling _ sort of a day-at-the-beach attitude.''
   The jury will return Sept. 10 to consider whether he should get
life in prison or death in the electric chair.
   Mrs. Lundgren, 39, was convicted Aug. 1 of conspiracy to commit
murder and of kidnapping.
   After the sentencing, Mrs. Lundgren tearfully told reporters,
``I am not the `Angel of Death.' I am the mother of four.''
   She testified she was afraid of her husband. ``I'm not a
cold-blooded murderer. He is,'' she said. ``I was found guilty of a
crime I had no knowledge would occur.''
   Other cult members, however, testified she attended prayer
meetings at which the pending murders were discussed.
   Until 1988, Lundgren was a lay minister for the Reorganized
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Kirtland, a town of
6,500. He was defrocked for inappropriate conduct and formed his
own sect, based on his interpretation of the Bible and the book of
Mormon.
   Testimony indicated that the Averys were less ardent in their
belief and that Lundgren disdained them.
   The Lundgrens' son, Damon, 19, awaits trial on murder charges.
Five other cult members have pleaded guilty and await sentencing;
five more await trial.

   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu heartened President
Bush today with a telephone call telling him Japan will initially
spend $1 billion on the multinational effort to isolate Iraq,
government officials said.
   The United States had pressed for concrete Japanese military aid
but had to settle for what amounted mostly to financial aid _
including potentially generous assistance to countries hurt by the
embargo on trade with Iraq.
   Turkey, Egypt and Jordan were singled out as nations that will
get ``substantial economic assistance,'' though the amounts and
details have yet to be worked out.
   Bush told Kaifu in their conversation that Japan's assistance
would be favorably viewed in the United States, according to an
official of the prime minister's office, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   It was the second phone conversation between the two leaders in
as many days to discuss Japan's role in aiding the forces arrayed
in the Middle East to stop any aggression by Iraq after its
invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   With the invasion, Iraq has cornered a total of 20 percent of
the world's oil reserves, and Japan imports virtually all of its
oil.
   Japan's $1 billion will cover a medical team of about 100
people, transportation of food, water and medical supplies by
chartered civil aircraft and ships, and the provision of water, air
conditioners and housing units for forces in the Persian Gulf
region.
   Also, Kaifu on Wednesday mentioned $10 million in aid for people
who have fled Iraq and Kuwait to Jordan.
   Additional money will go to Middle Eastern countries suffering
financially because of the U.N.-ordered embargo on trade with Iraq,
according to a Foreign Ministry official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The official declined to give a figure on that kind of aid.
   U.S. Ambassador Michael H. Armacost, who had been urging a
military contribution from Tokyo, issued a brief statement today
saying the aid package was ``most welcome.
   ``I particularly appreciate the announcement that Japan will
make a major contribution to the multinational force and provide
substantial assistance to the countries most aeffected by Iraq's
invasion and occupation of Kuwait.''
   In announcing the package Wednesday night, Kaifu ruled out a
role for Japan's military.
   But Tokyo will help other nations pay for chartered ships and
airplanes that could be used to ferry troops and arms to the
Persian Gulf. The United States had urged Tokyo to provide such
military transportation itself.
   ``We did everything we could within the boundary of the
constitution,'' Kaifu said when asked if he thought the proposal
would satisfy Washington.
   The United States has been seeking assistance from allies to
help foot the bill for the massive U.S.-led military buildup in
Saudi Arabia that began in reaction the the Iraqi invasion.
   Washington has estimated the U.S. cost of the buildup will reach
$2.5 billion by the end of September.
   Although Japan quickly joined the embargo on trade with Iraq, a
further response to the crisis was slowed by a debate over what is
permissible under Japan's constitution.
   Kaifu acknowledged that pressure was increasing on Japan to act.
   ``If our response was delayed any further, I was afraid we would
give the impression to the world that Japan is not doing anything
about this serious problem,'' he said. ``We can't afford to be
isolated from the rest of the world.''
   Japan relies on Middle East imports for about 70 percent of its
needs. About 12 percent of Japan's oil needs came from Iraq and
Kuwait in the first quarter of 1990.

<TEXT>
   Indian barricades started coming down
peacefully at a bridge into Montreal, but Mohawk warriors say their
confrontation with authorities isn't over in this Quebec village.
   After 50 days of armed standoff that began in Oka on July 11
with a bungled police assault on a Mohawk barricade, the situation
showed the first positive signs of resolution.
   Masked Mohawks on Wednesday helped soldiers tear down barricades
set up at the Mercier Bridge, which connects Montreal with suburbs
on the southern shore of the St. Lawrence River.
   Residents of several south shore communities cheered wildly as
wrecked cars, concrete blocks and mounds of earth were pushed aside.
   The barricades had gone up in sympathy with Mohawk barricades
thrown up in in Oka, 18 miles west of Montreal, nearly two months
ago to protest plans to expand a golf course onto land the Mohawks
claim is theirs.
   ``This place holds the key to everything,'' Mohawk Dan David
said Wednesday at the barricade overlooking the village of Oka and
the Canadian army installations below.
   ``Everybody knows that this is where it started and this is
where it will end,'' David said as armed Indians and reporters
alike scrambled to find out the latest information on the situation
at Mercier Bridge.
   The ostensible reason for the Mohawk uprising _ expansion of the
golf course _ was settled when the federal government purchased the
land and said it would turn it over to the Indians. But militants
seized the situation to air a much wider range of Indian grievances
against the government, including demands for sovereignty.
   Tensions had been near the boiling point since Monday, when
Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa broke off talks with the Mohawks and
ordered the army to tear down the barricades. As the army made its
tactical plans, last-ditch negotiations were launched at a suburban
hotel.
   Early this morning, it was still unclear exactly where and how
the breakthrough came. But after meeting in front of the bridge
barricade, soldiers and unarmed members of the Mohawks' militant
Warrior's Society began removing the barrier.
   The seven-week blockade has forced commuters living in
Chateauguay and other south shore communities to make long detours
to get to work on the island of Montreal. As the conflict wore on,
tempers wore thin.
   Chateauguay residents first vented their frustrations on police
in three nights of vicious rioting, and, increasingly, against
Mohawk civilians on the adjacent Kahnawake reservation.
   Though some of the barriers came down, traffic still was not
moving, either down the approach roads or across the vital bridge.
   In suburban Dorval, government and Indian negotiators said they
had made progress and would continue into the night. It was the
first note of optimism in many weeks.
   But at Oka, the optimism was tempered by lack of precise
knowledge about what was happening at Kahnawake and determination
not to give up the struggle.
   ``We're going to be here when they (the army) get here,'' said a
20-year-old warrior who calls himself Hunter.
   Hunter, an American Mohawk and a former student at the
University of Minnesota, said the decision on how to react to any
army move would be made at the last minute.
   The army has said it will not fire first under any
circumstances. The Mohawks have said they will not fire first.
   The Indians manning the barricades were asked what would happen
if soldiers marched up the hill to carry out Bourassa's orders to
tear down the barricade _ the soldiers not shooting, the Indians
not shooting, but the barricade slowing starting to move in front
of bulldozers.
   ``That's gonna be wild, huh?'' said a smiling Warrior called
Black Jack, peering through blue sunglasses and sucking on a soda.
   At this point, it's difficult to measure the residue of
resentment felt by south shore residents.
   Violent incidents and anger that exploded as the confrontation
wore on will take time to forget and what had been a large store of
sympathy for the cause of Canadian natives began to evaporate in
many quarters.
   ``I'm worried about the future,'' said Bob Grant, a Chateauguay
resident. ``It's going to take years and years for people in
Chateauguay to learn to get along with the Mohawks again.''

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sri Lanka will stop selling tea to
Iraq in compliance with sanctions imposed by the United Nations as
punishment for Iraq's seizure of Kuwait, a Cabinet minister said
today.
   ``We have got clarification from the U.N. that tea cannot be an
exception to the sanctions of food items to Iraq,'' said Plantation
Minister Ranjan Wijeratne.
   Sri Lanka had hoped that it would be permitted to continue
selling tea to Iraq, its largest single customer.
   The U.N. decision may be moot. On Monday, Iraqi purchased just
100 tons of tea at the Sri Lankan auction _ one-fifth its normal
level. And at Tuesday's auction, Iraq, whose shipping is now made
difficult by enforcement of the U.N.-ordered ban on trade, settled
its outstanding bills but made no new bids.
   Wijeratne, who is also the deputy defense minister, had said
earlier that Sri Lanka hoped tea would be exempted from the embargo.
   ``We have now received clarification and decided to comply,''
Wijeratne said. ``We cannot defy the U.N. resolution because there
can be serious repercussion.''
   Last year, Iraq purchased 30,000 tons of Sri Lankan tea _ nearly
24 percent of the Indian Ocean island's export crop. Egypt buys
more tea than Iraq, but purchases are made by several individual
companies.
   Bangladesh, another of Iraq's chief tea sources, barred Iraqi
buyers from its tea auctions earlier in the week.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Rejected for Judgeship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prosecutor whose nomination to the Superior
Court bench had been held up for months by a ex-con on an obscure
state board was rejected by the panel on the grounds she lacked the
temperament to be a judge.
   The Executive Council voted 5-4 on Wednesday against confirming
Diane Kottmyer, 44, an assistant U.S. attorney who gained a
reputation prosecuting mobsters and corrupt police officers. Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis had nominated her.
   Normally, nearly all the council's work in examining state
expenditures and judicial appointees is routine. Elected every four
years, it is a holdover from colonial days, originally intended to
check the power of the royal governor.
   A felon who serves on the council, Joseph ``Jo Jo'' Langone, had
held up a vote on Ms. Kottmyer's nomination since March. Langone
represents the district in which she lives and thus was in charge
of bringing up the nomination.
   ``I just believe she hates Italians and that's it,'' Langone
said Wednesday.
   The 73-year-old undertaker initially suspected Ms. Kottmyer had
played a role in his six-month sentence for assaulting a drug
investigator in 1971.
   Though he later learned Ms. Kottmyer had nothing to do with the
case _ she clerked for the judge who sentenced Langone, but not
until 1974 _ he pledged to stop her nomination.
   Several other councilors said they had received anonymous
complaints from defense lawyers that Ms. Kottmyer lacked the
temperament to be a judge.
   Councilor Rosemary Tierney said she was told Ms. Kottmyer was
humorless and a ``headhunter ... who has contempt for the defense.''
   ``The council's objections are that Diane Kottmyer is an
aggressive prosecutor,'' responded Dukakis aide Steve Crawford.
``The governor believes and the people of this state believe that
those are the kinds of judges we want on the bench.''
   Crawford said no decision had been made on whether to resubmit
Ms. Kottmyer's name for confirmation.

   Saudi Arabia's civil defense

including an Iraqi chemical weapons attack.
   The group has been educating hundreds of volunteers in weeklong
crash courses that began after Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait Aug.
2 and massed tens of thousands of troops on the Saudi border.
   Col. Mohammed al-Magrabi, the civil defense chief in Saudi
Arabia's oil-rich Eastern Province, expressed confident that most
people would be safe if they followed civil defense instructions.
   At Dammam's Civil Defense center, more than 200 men undergo
training every week, Magrabi said in an interview.
   The Saudis' civil defence organization combines firefighters,
rescue teams and other emergency services. But the fear that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein will send surface-to-surface missiles with
chemical warheads deep into Saudi Arabia is foremost in Saudis'
minds.
   Any Iraqi missiles fired from occupied Kuwait would reach
Eastern Province and even the capital, Riyadh, to the south within
minutes.
   Magrabi said Saudi and U.S. defense systems now in place should
be able to destroy incoming Iraqi missiles before they reach their
targets. But he acknowledged that one or two might get through.
   Civil Defense has focused on developing a warning system to give
the country's estimated 12 million people at least a five-minute
warning of an attack.
   The organization has a hotline to the air force radar control
center, Magrabi said. Once civil defense is informed of an attack,
it will broadcast a warning on radio and television, and sound
sirens, many of which are now mounted on four-wheel drive vehicles.
   All full-time civil defense personnel have been outfitted with
gas masks and protective suits but Magrabi hopes to acquire enough
masks to begin handing them out to the rest of the population.
   The Saudis have ordered millions of gas masks from manufacturers
in the United States and Britain.
   Civil defense is also supplied with atropine, a nerve gas
antidote.
   In the event of an Iraqi attack, the organization has planned
major relocation operations.
   If Khafji, which lies on the border with occupied Kuwait, were
attacked, civil defense would try to transport the population to a
tent city 90 miles away, Magrabi said.
   He said civil defense has similar plans for other major cities
that are potential targets.

   A Playboy model drew five months in prison for
not paying taxes on $398,000 given to her by a rich old man and was
ordered her to stay away from men at night until her term begins.
   Leigh Ann Conley, 35, also was fined $10,000 and placed on a
year's probation Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Thomas Curran.
   Prosecutors said businessman David Kritzik paid more than $1
million to Miss Conley and her twin, Lynette Harris, for
companionship and, in the case of Miss Harris, sex.
   Miss Harris was convicted in May of evading taxes on $686,000
from Kritzik, a widower who died last year at age 89. She was
sentenced to a year in prison and fined $12,500.
   Both women claimed that the money Kritzik gave them during their
five-year relationship was a gift.
   Miss Conley, who must report to prison within 30 days, was told
to remain in her home between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. without male
companionship.
   The identical blonde twins appeared nude in Playboy magazine and
in two films, ``I, the Jury,'' and ``Sorceress,'' before becoming
two of five young women who prosecutors said befriended Kritzik.
   Kritzik founded General Merchandising Co. in 1938. The company,
which founded the Treasure Island discount store chain, was sold in
1962 to J.C. Penney Co. for $11 million. Kritzik then established
Metropolitan Home Building Co.

<TEXT>
   Lyrics about murder, rape, robbery and
dismemberment have scared off a record company from handling an
album by the rap group the Geto Boys.
   The decision by Geffen Records has stirred accusations of
censorship and racism that were raised earlier this year when an
album by 2 Live Crew was declared obscene in Florida and members of
the rap group were arrested.
   Geffen said its decision earlier this month to back out was
based on lyrics in ``The Geto Boys'' that glamorize ``violence,
racism and misogyny.''
   ``I was flabbergasted that people would describe violence that
graphically in music,'' said Bryn Bridenthal, a Geffen vice
president. ``People will think this is like 2 Live Crew, which is
kind of silly, just pure sex. I was frightened by this.''
   The Houston-based band accused Geffen of a double standard that
some in the industry suggested is based on skin color, not song
content.
   Geffen also records artists such as Guns 'n Roses, which has
been accused of racism and homophobia in its lyrics, and
distributes Andrew Dice Clay, whose act has come under attack from
women, minorities and homosexuals.
   ``You have to wonder if this inconsistency borders on racism,''
rap publicist Bill Adler said.
   ``It's easier to single out a black group on a small label than
any white group,'' said Debbie Bennett, a spokeswomen for 2 Live
Crew's Luke Records.
   Albums such as 2 Live Crew's ``As Nasty as They Wanna Be'' led
the Louisiana Legislature to pass a bill requiring warning labels
on recordings with potentially offensive lyrics. Gov. Buddy Roemer
vetoed it as unconstitutional.
   Geto Boys' lead rapper Bushwick Bill said his lyrics reflect
Houston's destitute Fifth Ward.
   The group's spokeswoman, Heidi Robinson, said ``there are
reasons for the songs they've written.'' She added, ``To dismiss
them as four guys doing this for shock value is to take them simply
at face value.''
   Robinson said the group wants to put money into a boys' club and
encourages black youngsters to get an education. She also said the
group has positive lyrics, citing the anti-drug ``Life in the Fast
Lane.''
   But women's rights groups are appalled by such rhymes as: ``Her
body's beautiful, so I'm thinking rape. Shouldn't have had her
curtains open, so that's her fate.''
   Francoise Jacobsohn, president of the New York chapter of the
National Organization for Women, praised Geffen's decision. ``This
art perpetuates and makes acceptable certain violence against
women. We think that is abhorrent,'' she said.
   But she questioned why the Geto Boys were singled out: ``We
think the same set of rules should apply to Andrew Dice Clay.''

   Another scorcher was in store for northern Texas and the eastern
Rockies today after an unseasonably hot day that saw temperature
records fall for the day from Idaho to Florida.
   Strong thunderstorms were expected again today along the coast
of the Carolinas, with scattered storms as far west as Arkansas.
   Drier air was moving into the Northeast, and pleasant weather
was expected in the region through Saturday.
   Increasing onshore winds were expected to bring rain to the
Northwest, while a cold front pushing east into the northern
Rockies was expected to trigger showers and thunderstorms from
southern Montana to eastern Nevada.
   Temperatures already were nudging into the 80s before dawn today
in Oklahoma, Florida and North Carolina. Highs over 100 were
expected in Texas, Oklahoma and western Kansas and Nebraska.
   On Wednesday, heat and humidity prevailed throughout much of the
nation. Among record highs were 104 degrees in Waco, Texas, and
Jonesboro, Ark.; 102 in Macon and Columbus, Ga., Huntsvillle, Ala.,
and Tupelo, Miss.; 98 in Grand Junction, Colo.; and 97 in
Pocatello, Idaho.
   High temperature for the Lower 48 states Wednesday was 113
degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.
   Storms Wednesday dumped golf ball-sized hail near Greensboro,
N.C., Seneca and Clemson, S.C., Corning, Ark., and Owensboro, Ky.,
the National Weather Service reported.
   Thunderstorm winds gusted to 60 mph at Elizabeth City, N.C., 70

<TEXT>
   A rapist who forces his elderly
victims to pose for lewd photos and lectures them about inviting
attack by inadequately securing their homes has claimed his fourth
victim, police said.
   All the attacks have occurred in the last year in one section of
the city, police said. The women ranged in age from 64 to 86.
   Each victim was awakened in the early morning, blindfolded and
photographed in obscene poses before being raped, and in each case
the man unplugged or cut telephone lines, police Sgt. Dave Geyer
said Wednesday.
   A 73-year-old woman was attacked early Tuesday in the most
recent attack, police said. In the other cases, the man attacked on
a Sunday morning and stole cash.
   A 75-year-old woman avoided becoming a victim earlier this year
by pushing an alarm button in her home and scaring off the rapist,
Geyer said.
   Police said they believe the same man committed all four rapes
because of the method of the attack and the women's description of
the rapist.
   The man apparently gets in through windows and doors, police
said.
   ``We are convinced that there are a lot (of attacks) that have
occurred that we don't know about,'' Geyer said. ``He uses a
psychological ploy on the victims to cause them to believe they're
responsible for the attack, which makes them less likely to report
it.''

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of
Britain rebuked most of her Western European allies today, saying
they are relying on the United States to defend their interests in
the Persian Gulf.
   The Western allies cannot ``expect the U.S. to go on bearing
major military and defense burdens worldwide, acting in effect as
the world's policemen,'' Mrs. Thatcher told a conference of
European conservative party leaders.
   She said European countries ``have shown excellent solidarity in
protecting each other's citizens and in trying to keep open our
embassies in Kuwait.
   ``But in defense terms the European response was much slower and
more patchy,'' she said. ``The only countries in Europe which have
done significantly more than the minimum are Britain and France.''
   Italy, West Germany, Greece, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands
have sent or plan to send warships or minesweepers to the region in
support.
   Mrs. Thatcher thanked the United States and President Bush for
``giving leadership and moving rapidly and decisively'' in
protecting Western interests in the gulf.
   She spoke on the first day of a conference of 10 European prime
ministers and about 30 leaders of conservative and Christian
Democratic parties that form the European Democratic Union.
   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said today that he doubts
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein could hold on to power if he
complies with United Nations resolutions that aim to force Iraq to
withdraw from Kuwait.
   Hurd said, however, that he believes there is ``a reasonable
chance'' that economic sanctions will achieve U.N. objectives
without any resort to force.
   ``I don't myself think that (Saddam) would find it easy to
survive withdrawal from Kuwait,'' Hurd said in an interview with
BBC radio.
   Iraq seized Kuwait on Aug. 2 in a lightning invasion.

   Pizza deliverers, postal carriers and
other door-to-door workers fear being attacked by residents
terrified the killer of five college students may be knocking at
the door.
   Deliverers have been told to take precautions because of the
weapons their customers might wield.
   ``They are more nervous of the customers than they are of this
person,'' Greg Sausaman, owner of three Domino's Pizza franchises,
said of the student killer. ``Heaven forbid you knock on the wrong
door right now.
   ``The drivers have been instructed that if anything looks
suspicious, not to even get out of their car,'' he said Wednesday.
``That way they don't get a face full of Mace.''
   Four young women and a man _ students at either the University
of Florida or Santa Fe Community College _ were stabbed to death in
off-campus apartments in three attacks discovered since Sunday.
Police said three of the women were mutilated.
   Police warned residents not to open their doors to anyone
without seeing identification.
   One ice cream shop reported that its delivery persons have been
greeted with a baseball bat and a gun.
   Sausaman's drivers have been calling customers before making
deliveries to identify drivers by name and appearance and honking
their horns on arrival.
   At Rocky Rococo Pizza, employees said people were asking for
descriptions of delivery drivers.
   ``I had some girls that I delivered to, that I didn't know if
they'd open the door,'' said Geoffrey Dunnam. ``They were scared,
and I knew I was scared.''
   After each delivery, customers and Dunnam exchanged a ``be
careful,'' he said.
   Rural mail carriers, who do not usually wear the familiar U.S.
Postal Service uniforms, were told to prominently display their
photo identification badges.
   ``Other than that, we're making no special arrangements except
to make sure that all of our carriers get back all right from their
routes,'' said Gainesville postal supervisor James Hardy.
   The Gainesville Sun had planned to promote newspaper
subscriptions at student apartment complexes with more than a dozen
door-to-door canvassers. But circulation director Jim Miller said
the program was scrapped.
   ``It's really a bad time,'' Miller said. ``We may not do it at
all before the end of the semester.''

   A man who was turned away as overweight by
Marine recruiters in Detroit walked and hitchhiked 2,500 miles to
San Diego, dropping 20 pounds in the process and gaining acceptance
into the service.
   ``With that kind of initiative and determination, he may make a
good Marine,'' said Staff Sgt. Duane Wilmurth, the drill instructor
overseeing Michael Pigeon's training at the San Diego Marine Corps
Recruit Depot.
   ``I very much wanted to be a Marine,'' said Pigeon, 18, who
slipped out of his parent's home in Detroit two weeks ago with $40
in his pocket.
   He began basic training Tuesday.
   Recruiters in Detroit had told Pigeon they would not sign him up
until he neared the 219 pounds the corps says is maximum for his
6-foot-3 frame. He had weighed 245 pounds.
   Asked whether the U.S. military buildup in Saudi Arabia aimed at
rolling back Iraq's invasion of Kuwait had anything to do with his
decision, Pigeon said: ``Not directly. I volunteered for the Marine
infantry. I'll fight wherever the corps sends me.''

   An American man of Indian origin and a
17-year-old British girl of Arab extraction were among 185 evacuees
who flew into Jordan today aboard the daily morning Iraqi Airways
flight.
   The others were Asians and Arabs.
   The American said he slipped out of Iraq after lying about his
nationality. Iraqi officials have been holding Westerners as human
shields against U.S. and other forces assembling in the Persian
Gulf region since Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   J.N. Sharma, 55, an agricultural engineer of Idaho Falls, Idaho,
told reporters on arrival that he had spent three weeks in hiding
in occupied Kuwait.
   ``I stayed in hiding like a rat eating nothing but rice and
lentils,'' he said. He said he hid his American passport and left
Iraq using an Indian travel document.
   Sharma said that on his way to Iraq by road from Kuwait after
the Aug. 2 invasion, ``three Iraqi soldiers stopped me at gunpoint.
   ``They told me to keep moving and one of them grabbed me by the
shirt... I nearly died of fright,'' he said.
   He burst into laughter when asked whether he told the Iraqis
that he was an American.
   The British girl, May Barakat, was on the verge of tears as she
was surrounded by scores of reporters, photographers and television
crews at Queen Alia International Airport. She said she was on
vacation in Iraq with friends when the Iraqis invaded Kuwait.
   The girl said she was from Acton, West London, but would not
answer other questions. Barakat is a common Arabic surname.
   Hundreds of Westerners of Arab or Asian extraction have been
allowed to leave Iraq since the invasion _ along with more than a
quarter of a million Arabs and Asians. But 20,000 Americans,
Europeans and Japanese have not been allowed to leave, with some
being held at key installations as human shields.
   Jordan's airport is the only facility that has remained open to
Iraq's flag carrier since the United Nations imposed an embargo on
against Saddam's government to force him to withdraw from Kuwait.
   Iraq has closed its airspace to foreign airlines since the
invasion.

<TEXT>
   Survivors of northern Illinois' deadly
storm say it struck virtually without warning, and a weather
forecaster said that even when there are warnings, ``in most cases
it's too late.''
   ``Your chances of being warned before a tornado hits aren't all
that great,'' National Weather Service meteorologist Greg Dickey
said Wednesday, pointing out that the notice comes only after a
tornado has been sighted.
   Multiple tornadoes Tuesday left at least 24 dead and more than
300 injured.
   ``We didn't get any warning,'' said Plainfield Police Chief Don
Bennett.
   The tornadoes that swooped into Plainfield appeared out of a
single thunderstorm that rumbled across northern Illinois for about
two hours, spitting hail 2 to 3 inches in diameter as it went.
   The weather service issued a severe thunderstorm watch at about
1:30 p.m. as the storm approached Rockford, then followed it up
with more notices as the storm moved southeast, warning of
dangerous lightning, heavy rain and strong winds.
   ``Remember ... severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do
produce a tornado with little or no advance warning ... so be on
the lookout,'' read one warning.
   But the storm seemed to be limited to hail and high winds.
   ``The system seemed to have gotten less threatening,'' said John
Plunk, director of the Illinois Emergency Services and Disaster
Agency. ``Then this hit out of the blue. When it forms that fast
and moves that quickly, there's nothing you can do.''
   At 3:45 p.m., the first call came in to the weather service
reporting a tornado touchdown at Plainfield, said forecaster
Richard Kenneman. The weather service moved a bulletin at 3:51
p.m., but by that time the twisters had already smashed through the
town and into Joliet, about 15 miles away.
   Janet Fazio said the few teachers and administrators at
Plainfield High School at the end of the day didn't know the storm
was coming until a school worker eyed it while closing a window
that had blown open.
   ``The emergency radio didn't even go off in the main office,''
said Mrs. Fazio, a secretary.
   The tornadoes virtually destroyed the school, which had been
scheduled to open for classes Wednesday. Most teachers and
administrators had left for the day when the storm struck, and some
took shelter in the school vault.
   In a Joliet subdivision 35 miles southwest of Chicago, Rich
Alberti got the warning from his wife, Michelle, moments before
their house was destroyed.
   ``I was sleeping and she was getting ready to take a shower,''
Alberti said. ``She told me to look out. As soon as I saw it, I
knew it was a tornado. There weren't seconds to spare.''
   Kenneman said tornadoes themselves are too small to be detected
by available radar, but thunderstorms sometimes contain radar
patterns that indicate a tornado may be developing. The
thunderstorm Tuesday did not contain the telltale indications that
twisters were lurking inside, Kenneman said.
   More sophisticated radar is being developed. But, he said, even
fair warning can't always protect against nature's most devastating
force.
   ``Even assuming the whole warning process plays through
successfully and people hear the warning, there are some tornadoes
that are violent enough that they are flat out not survivable,''
Kenneman said.
   ``We have to live with the fact that, unless we want to live in
concrete reinforced bunkers and drive 80,000-pound steel cars, that
we are going to be vulnerable when weather is severe enough,'' he
said.

   Hurricane Gustav continued its slow trek north over
the open Atlantic today, boasting slightly stronger top winds but
posing no immediate threat to Bermuda or the U.S. East Coast,
forecasters said.
   At 6 a.m. EDT, Gustav had top winds of 90 mph after weakening to
80 mph Wednesday morning. It was located near 26.5 degrees north
latitude and 57.7 west longitude, about 600 miles southeast of
Bermuda.
   Gustav was heading north at about 8 mph, and was expected to
maintain that course and speed for the following 24 hours.
   ``Gustav is just spinning it wheels over the open Atlantic,''
said Daniel Petersen, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane
Center in suburban Coral Gables. ``It hasn't shown any inclination
to move either east or west, and we so see no reason for that to
change for the time being.''
   Bermuda remained the only landfall threat _ at week's end if the
hurricane veers to the northwest, Petersen said.
   Tropical storm Hortense was downgraded Wednesday to a tropical
depression and was about 260 miles southeast of Gustav.
   At 6 a.m. today, Hortense was moving northwest at nearly 14 mph
and had winds of 35 mph. It was centered near 29.4 degrees north
latitude and 50.4 degrees west longitude, or about 860 miles
southeast of Bermuda.
   Little change in strength was forecast for the storm during the
day today, said Petersen.
   A tropical storm has sustained winds of at least 39 mph and a
hurricane is 74 mph or more. The Atlantic hurricane season runs
from June through November.

<HEAD>Arms Cache Reportedly Meant To Blow Up Dome Of The Rock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police today announced the discovery of an arms
cache including shoulder-held missiles that reportedly was meant to
blow up the Dome of the Rock, one of the holiest shrines of Islam.
   Police found the cache belonging to a radical Jewish activist,
convicted in a 1984 attempt to attack the gold-domed mosque, in the
ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Mea Shearim, National Police
spokesman Roni Yishaya said.
   The Israeli daily Haaretz reported the arms were stolen from the
army by Shimon Barda, leader of a cave-dwelling mystical Jewish
sect, for a second attempt on the mosque. The daily Hadashot said
several more arrests were expected in the alleged plot.
   Yishaya refused to comment on the reports. He confirmed two LAW
missiles were found but would not reveal what else was in the arms
cache.
   The Dome of the Rock sits atop what is known to Jews as the
Temple Mount and to Moslems as the Haram esh-Sharif, or Noble
Sanctuary.
   The area in Jerusalem's Old City is revered by Moslems as the
site of Prophet Mohammed's ascent to heaven and by Jews as the site
of Solomon's Temple and the second Jewish temple destroyed by the
Romans in 70 A.D.
   Radical Jewish groups have called for removal of the Dome of the
Rock and adjacent Al Aqsa Mosque for creation of a new Jewish
temple.
   Barda, 31, was sentenced to eight years in jail September 1985
for the earlier attempt to blow up the Dome of the Rock. He escaped
in mid-1988 and avoided capture until September 1989 by disguising
himself as a bearded Jewish scholar in Mea Shaarim.
   Barda led police to the arms cache on Wednesday, but it was
unclear why he revealed the hidden weapons now. Haaretz said he
stole the weapons during his time out of jail.
   In January 1984 Barda and two accomplices were caught hauling 28
pounds of TNT and 15 hand grenades over the walls of the Temple
Mount. The accomplices were committed to psychiatric care but were
later released.
   The three men had formed a tiny mystical sect that lived in a
cave in the abandoned Palestinian village of Lifta on Jerusalem's
outskirts.
   The Temple Mount is a frequent source of tension between Jews
and Moslems.
   It is heavily guarded by police, partly because of fears that a
successful attack on the Moslem shrines could endanger the lives of
Jews living in Islamic countries.

   A renegade paramilitary group agreed to disband
after the Armenian Parliament outlawed it and declared a state of
emergency, the republic's president announced today.
   Leaders of the Armenian National Army were to make a television
appeal for several hundred members to turn in their weapons, Levon
Ter-Petrosyan told Parliament, according to the official Tass news
agency.
   Acceptance of the appeal would defuse tensions in one of the
Soviet Union's most volatile republics, where fighting with
neighboring Azerbaijan has claimed hundreds of lives in the last
two years.
   The Armenian National Army claims to protect Armenians from
armed groups from the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan. But its
members have also attacked police stations and gasoline depots in
Armenia to steal weapons and fuel they need to fight Azerbaijanis.
   The group, formed in January, is thought to have several hundred
hard-core fighters and many more sympathizers.
   Parliament declared the emergency Wednesday, following shootings
in the republic's capital, Yerevan. Members of the Armenian
National Army with automatic weapons had attacked the headquarters
of the Armenian National Movement, a group loyal to the local
government.
   Separately, a lawmaker and a member of the Armenian National
Movement were shot and killed early Wednesday as they approached
the Armenian National Army headquarters to investigate an earlier
attack on a gasoline station.
   Parliament imposed an overnight curfew and gave the Armenian
National Army until Wednesday night to disband, disarm and turn
over vehicles and buildings it had seized.
   When the deadline passed, Armenian Interior Ministry troops and
police in central Yerevan surrounded three buildings that are the
Armenian National Army's headquarters, where about 250 armed
members had gathered, the independent Interfax news agency said.
   Lawmakers negotiated with the armed men, who demanded their
members be allowed to leave with their weapons so they could join
legal military forces under the government's jurisdiction, Tass
said.
   Their demand was rejected, and shortly after midnight, about 200
of the militants surrendered and turned in their weapons, Tass
said. About 50 managed to flee with their weapons and ammunition,
Tass said.
   The parliamentary decree granted immunity to those who
surrendered peacefully, and provides severe punishments for those
who ignored it.
   The mainly Christian Armenia and mainly Moslem Azerbaijan have
for two years waged a bloody battle for control over
Nagorno-Karabakh, a largely Armenian enclave inside Azerbaijan.
   The protracted fighting prompted President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
to issue a decree in July ordering illegally armed groups
throughout the country to disband and disarm. The decree was
largely ignored and extended into September.
   Ter-Petrosyan said the state of emergency and curfew would
remain in effect until violence ended. Parliament said the measures
would be enforced solely by police and troops under their control,
not by Soviet forces.
   Armenia's Parliament recently voted to become independent from
the Soviet Union and to create its own armed forces to safeguard
the border.

<TEXT>
   Pennsylvania says it will enforce a ban
on virtually all abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy, rejecting
arguments from abortion-rights forces that the provision was struck
down last week.
   At issue is Pennsylvania's restrictive abortion law, which is
likely to be put to a test in a federal appeals court later this
year and could ultimately reach the U.S. Supreme Court.
   U.S. District Judge Daniel J. Huyett III threw out key
provisions of the law on Friday, including requirements that women
notify their husbands if they want an abortion and that minors get
the consent of a parent, or a court, to have an abortion.
   The American Civil Liberties Union and the Women's Law Project
in Philadelphia said Wednesday that the ban on abortions after 24
weeks also was overturned.
   But Kate L. Mershimer, who argued the case for the state, said
the prohibition remained largely intact. The state Health
Department has been instructed to enforce the ban.
   Since only a handful of abortions in Pennsylvania each year take
place after 24 weeks, the dispute would appear to carry relatively
minor significance. But the issue could take on greater importance
if it surfaces in the appeals court.
   The 24-week ban, which prohibits abortions except in cases where
a woman would face death or irreversible harm, was widely viewed as
a direct assault on Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling
that established the right to an abortion.
   That ruling said a woman's decision to have an abortion during
the first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and her
doctor. It said states may interfere in the abortion decision
during the second trimester only to protect the woman's health, and
may take steps to protect fetal life in the third trimester.
   Twenty-four weeks falls near the end of the second trimester;
proponents of a ban on abortions after 24 weeks say that a fetus
has a good chance of surviving at that point in pregnancy.
   Huyett's ruling, which is being appealed by the state, stemmed
from a lawsuit filed by a group of doctors and clinics.
   The lawsuit did not challenge the 24-week ban, but it came into
play because Huyett overturned the law's definition for ``medical
emergency,'' which appears in the section.
   Some provisions that doctors would have to follow in performing
abortions after 24 weeks, such as obtaining the consent of a second
physician, would be suspended in cases of medical emergencies,
according to the law.
   ACLU spokesman Simon Heller said the judge's action overturns
the 24-week prohibition itself.
   But Robert Gentzel, a spokesman for Attorney General Ernie
Preate Jr., said the Health Department was told to enforce the
24-week ban after lawyers concluded it was not voided by Huyett's
ruling.

<TEXT>
   Former first lady Nancy Reagan has
returned to her home in Los Angeles and won't need follow-up
treatment for the small cancerous tumor she had removed here, a
family spokesman said.
   The surgery will not affect the Reagans' scheduled visit to
Germany, Poland and the Soviet Union beginning Sept. 10, said Mark
Weinberg, spokesman for Mrs. Reagan and former President Reagan.
   The basal cell carcinoma was discovered just beneath Mrs.
Reagan's left nostril during a routine dermatological examination
at the Mayo Clinic. A plastic surgeon removed it Wednesday at St.
Marys Hospital, and the Reagans returned to California a short time
later, Weinberg said.
   A basal cell carcinoma is the least dangerous type of skin
cancer and usually is caused by too much sun, said Dr. Peter Lynch,
head of the University of Minnesota's dermatology department.
Though there's little danger of serious illness, early diagnosis is
important because, if untreated, a carcinoma can destroy the skin
around it, Lynch said.
   Mrs. Reagan, 69, and the former president, 79, had been at the
clinic since Monday for routine annual checkups.
   Weinberg said doctors found the Reagans in otherwise excellent
health. He said he didn't know how long Mrs. Reagan had the tumor,
and neither he nor the Mayo Clinic could give further details of
the surgery.
   In 1987, doctors at Bethesda Naval Hospital removed Mrs.
Reagan's left breast and lymph glands after a cancerous tumor was
found.

<TEXT>
   A bomb exploded at a military outpost in
Christian east Beirut, killing at least 12 soldiers loyal to rebel
Gen. Michel Aoun, a security source said today.
   Later, Aoun's troops battled Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces
militia with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades. A police
spokesman said two women were injured by sniper fire in the
four-hour skirmish.
   The powerful bomb blast ripped through the base in the Roumieh
suburb late Wednesday, said the source who requested anonymity.
Aoun's headquarters made no immediate comment on the explosion.
   The conservative Ad-Diyar newspaper said President Hafez Assad
of Syria predicted a ``military operation'' is possible against
Aoun bases around Beirut. Assad, who has 40,000 troops in
predominately Moslem regions of Lebanon, pledged support to help
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi ``extend authority'' over the
Christian enclave.
   Hrawi met in Damascus on Wednesday with Assad.
   The power struggle for control of the 310-square-mile Christian
enclave north of Beirut has been generally quiet since a
Vatican-brokered cease-fire began May 17. By police count, at least
1,044 people have been killed and 2,793 wounded in fighting since
January.
   Aoun has rejected an Arab League peace plan designed to end
Lebanon's 15-year-old civil war.
   The plan calls for the Moslems, who make up an estimated 55
percent of Lebanon's 4 million population, to have an equal share
of power with the traditionally dominant Christians. Geagea has
accepted the pact.
   Aoun refuses to recognize Hrawi, who was elected Nov.24.
   The president has sacked Aoun as army commander and interim
prime minister, but the general refuses to step down.

   Betty Binder won the Illinois Lottery and she's
sharing her winnings with 14 relatives. And with $27 million,
there's a lot to go around.
   ``We've always said whoever won, we would share,'' Mrs. Binder
said Wednesday. ``When things are down or things are up, now, we
stick together through thick and thin.''
   That means Mrs. Binder is sharing her Lotto winnings with her
husband, her three daughters, her two sisters and their husbands,
her brother and his wife, her parents, and her mother- and
father-in-law.
   Each family member plays the Lotto every week and all had agreed
that potential winnings would be shared. Mrs. Binder won the grand
prize, fattened by several drawings in which there were no winning
tickets, on Saturday.
   ``After I found out we won, I went to my employer and asked for
a day off,'' said Frank Binder, Mrs. Binder's father-in-law. ``Then
I said I wanted to take my three weeks of vacation time. ... Then I
said I wanted to retire. I really shocked him and had to explain I
won $27 million.''

   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein said in an interview
that foreigners held in his country will be the first to go into
bomb shelters in the event of an attack.
   ``These are guests,'' he said in an interview shown Wednesday
night on CBS. ``We are treating them as guests. And, according to
Arab tradition, guests come before (Iraqi) households.''
   The 90-minute interview taped Wednesday in Baghdad with CBS
anchorman Dan Rather and a separate interview taped Tuesday by
French station TF1 were his first with Western reporters since Iraq
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``We do not want war,'' he told Rather. But he said, ``Iraq will
come out victorious'' in any conflict. ``God is on our side and
Satan is on the side of the United States,'' Saddam said through an
interpreter.
   The Iraqi leader declared, ``Kuwait is part of Iraq,'' and he
questioned the United States' right to demand Iraq pull out.
   ``Is Kuwait the 52nd state of the United States?'' Saddam asked.
   Saddam denied making any secret proposals to pull out of Kuwait.
A White House official said Wednesday that the Bush administration
received a secret Iraqi offer to free all captives and withdraw
from Kuwait if certain conditions were met.
   The conditions were that the international trade embargo against
Iraq be lifted and Baghdad be granted access to the Persian Gulf
and sole control of an oil field that dips into Kuwait, according
to the newspaper Newsday.
   The White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the offer was rejected.
   Saddam stressed that Kuwait's status was a separate issue from
that of Saudi Arabia, where a multinational force has formed to
head off an invasion by Iraq.
   He avoided direct answers to many of Rather's questions,
including one on whether Iraq would use chemical or biological
weapons if invaded. However, he said, ``Iraq is not going to be an
easy bite to swallow.''
   Saddam said he was serious about his proposal that he debate
President Bush and British Prime Mininster Margaret Thatcher.
Washington and London have rejected the idea.
   ``Aren't the people of the West interested in debate, to see the
facts as they are?'' Saddam asked.
   He reiterated that the foreigners being held by Iraq should not
be called hostages because Iraq was not asking for anything in
exchange for their release. But he called them ``guests against
their will.''
   Foreigners in Iraq have been moved to strategic military and
civilian areas for use as a shield against attack.
   There were no restrictions on what Rather could ask, said CBS
spokeswoman Donna Dees. The only conditions were that Iraqi TV
cameras be used and that it be a one-hour interview that would air
as recorded, she said.
   Saddam let the interview run longer so it could be cut for
translation and minor editing, Dees said.

   Mayor Marion Barry, following through with
plans to seek a city council seat, has filed petitions with the
District of Columbia's Board of Elections.
   Barry, 54, who was convicted earlier this month of a misdemeanor
cocaine possession charge and acquitted of another, filed the
petitions Wednesday. He plans to be listed on the November ballot
as an independent candidate for an at-large council post.
   He ruled out a bid for a fourth, four-year term as mayor before
his drug and perjury trial began in June. After the trial, however,
he announced the council bid.
   Barry needs signatures from 3,000 registered voters in order to
run. City elections officials said it would take at least a week to
validate the signatures on the petitions.
   The mayor's 1978 election to the first of his three terms
followed a four-year council stint. Prior to his council service,
Barry also was elected to the school board.
   Sentencing has not yet been scheduled for Barry's drug
conviction. He faces a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a
$100,000 fine.
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens is expected to announce Sept. 17
whether he will retry Barry on the charges that resulted in a hung
jury. They include three perjury charges of lying to a federal
grand jury about his drug use, one misdemeanor charge of conspiracy
to possess cocaine, and eight misdemeanor cocaine possession
charges.

   Two children critically injured by
tornadoes were reunited with their families by authorities who used

   Katy Lydon, 3, of Addison and Sara Junkroski, 6, of Joliet were
taken to Loyola University Medical Center in suburban Chicago after
the tornadoes struck northeastern Illinois on Tuesday. But doctors
and nurses treating them did not know who they were.
   The hospital issued a televised plea for help in identifying the

were missing, faxed Katy and Sara's pictures to the hospital.
   They matched the injured children, and family members were
called to the hospital to verify the identification, said hospital
spokesman Michael Maggio.
   Holly Junkroski, Sara's mother, was being treated for a broken
leg today at Silver Cross Hospital in Joliet.
   ``I was in the hallway to the bedroom when it just hit,'' Ms.
Junkroski said. ``It blew the whole house apart. All three of the
kids were home. The other two are fine, but we couldn't find Sara.''
   Sara's condition was upgraded to serious this morning, while
Katy remained in critical condition. Maggio said both were expected

   A Texas drilling company says it can't afford to
continue paying its six American workers stranded in Kuwait and
Iraq.
   Houston drilling company OGE Inc. said Wednesday athat the
company can't pay the workers' families becase the company stopped
receiving money from Kuwait Oil Co. after the invasion of Kuwait.
OGE provided drilling crews for Kuwait Oil.
   ``Our contracts with these people ended by basis of ... an act
of war, something beyond our control. Our contract with them ended
the day of the invasion _ Aug. 2,'' said OGE vice president Jay
Simpson.
   But family members in Texas said the employees were hired and
paid as OGE workers and not as Kuwait Oil employees. One said she
was angry the company has refused to tell her whether her husband's
salary would be cut off.
   ``They don't have the guts to tell us,'' said Donnita Cole of
Odessa, whose husband, John, is an OGE employee stranded in
occupied Kuwait. ``They keep putting us off, but I feel the
decision has already been made.''
   Four of the stranded workers are from Texas; two are from
Florida.
   Simpson said the company is trying to find some means to help
the workers, whose families were scheduled to receive a monthly
paycheck on Sept. 1. He said the company is trying to contact
Kuwait Petroleum Co., the parent company of Kuwait Oil, but has not
received any indication that money can be sent to the families of
the stranded workers.
   Simpson confirmed that OGE officials contacted the Texas
Employment Commission last week to determine whether the stranded
workers could qualify for unemployment compensation.
   Simpson conceded the company's position could present a public
relations problem..
   ``We're very, very troubled by this, obviously,'' he said.
``There is nothing that we can do.''
   Simpson refused to say whether OGE's employees still in the
United States were continuing to receive paychecks.
   If the workers are placed on unemployment compensation, the
maximum payment their families could receive would be $214 per week
for 26 weeks, said Bill Grossenbacher, administrator of the Texas
Employment Commission in Austin.
   ``To be honest, we have questions about whether they would even
qualify,'' Grossenbacher said.

the politics institute in late October, the university announced
Wednesday.
   He and another Soviet, Melor Sturua, former Washington bureau
chief of the Soviet journal Izvestia, will be the first Soviets to
take part in the institute's fellows program, said its director,
Terry Donovan. They are not the first Soviets to do research at
Harvard, however, she said.
   Charles Royer, former mayor of Seattle and the director of the
Institute of Politics, said the diversity of this fall's group of
institute fellows ``will help us understand not only our own U.S.
elections but changing events around the world.''
   The institute is part of the Kennedy School of Government.
   Each fall and spring the institute invites politicians, former
American and foreign government officials and journalists to spend
a semester at Harvard doing research and teaching.
   For his part, Khrushchev will give a seminar on a topic to be
announced and will do research for a book, Ms. Donovan said.
   Khrushchev, an engineer who specializes in rocket guidance
systems, has already written a book about his father titled
``Khrushchev on Khrushchev.''
   He has visited Harvard before, coming to the university briefly
last year to discuss a university study of the 1962 Cuban missile
crisis.
   His father was Soviet premier from 1958 to his ouster in 1964;
he died in 1971.
   The other fellows named Wednesday are Dick Riley, former
governor of South Carolina; Jessie Rattley, former mayor of Newport
News, Va.; Tom Luce, an attorney and unsuccessful Republican
candidate for governor of Texas in the primary this past spring
Brock Evans, a vice president of the National Audubon Society; and
Margaret Carlson, senior political writer at Time magazine.

   President Najibullah of Afghanistan said
today he was willing to relinquish control of the state media and
of some troops to an interim commission if new elections are held.
   But he rejected the key U.S. demands that the entire armed
forces and secret police be placed under the authority of a neutral
council during a transitional period aimed at ending Afghanistan's
12-year-old civil war.
   Najibullah, who concluded a four-week trip to the Soviet Union
on Saturday, spoke at a news conference during an official visit to
India.
   ``We have accepted a transitional period. This process begins
with the opening of talks and dialogue between all Afghan political
forces involved in the conflict,'' he said.
   So far the Moslem guerrilla leaders based in neighboring
Pakistan have rejected any negotiations with Najibullah.
   The Soviet Union, which ended its combat support for
Najibullah's government 19 months ago, and the United States, which
was one of the chief suppliers of arms to the guerrillas, have been
searching anew for a political solution to the Afghan impasse.
   Washington has dropped its demand that Najibullah step down
before elections are held. Instead, the Americans have said he
could remain president during the elections, provided he
relinquishes control of the army, secret police and state-run news
media to a neutral body.
   While the United States and the Soviet Union seek a compromise,
the rebels continue to insist Najibullah must resign before any
elections are held.
   Two months ago, in a largely cosmetic exercise, Najibullah
created a new political party, the Hezb-e-Watan, or National Party.
But all the top posts in it went to stalwarts from his old People's
Democratic Party of Afghanistan.
   Asked whether he or his party was willing to step down during a
transitional period, Najibullah said: ``We are of the opinion that
stepping aside cannot solve this problem. The same applies to the
stepping down of this or that personality.''
   Najibullah's lengthy visit to the Soviet Union had prompted
speculation that Moscow might be trying to ease him out of Kabul's
political picture.
   But the 44-year-old former secret police chief claimed he had
simply gone to Moscow ``for some medical checkups. My visit to the
Soviet Union was not an official visit.''
   He said all sides in the Afghan conflict should open talks,
followed by a cease-fire, a peace conference, creation of ``a joint
commission'' and, finally, elections for a new government.
   He said this ``joint commission'' would then supervise elections
for a new Parliament. ``Any party that wins the majority in the
Parliament will form the new government,'' he said.

   Orders to factories for manufactured goods
rose 1.6 percent in July, nearly regaining their loss in June as
they continued to follow a zigzag path this year, the government
reported today.
   The Commerce Department said orders for both durable and
non-durable goods totaled a seasonally adjusted $240.3 billion
following a 1.9 percent decrease in June.
   Orders also declined in January and April and increased in
February, March and May.
   `Most of the increase in orders in July was for durable goods,
up $3.5 billion or 2.8 percent to $128.2 billion,'' the report
said. The increase was a slight downward revision from the 2.9
percent advance reported last week.
   Orders for durable goods _ big-ticket items expected to last
more than three years _ had fallen 3.0 percent in June.
   Non-durable goods orders gained 0.2 percent to $112.1 billion
after falling 0.4 percent a month earlier.
   In the key category of non-defense capital goods, a barometer of
business investment plans, orders gained 10.0 percent to $39.8
billion. However, most of the increase was in aircraft. But
excluding aircraft, orders still were up 1.9 percent. Non-defense
capital goods orders rose 0.7 percent in June.
   Transportation orders rose 4.9 percent to $34.9 billion after a
6.3 percent decline the previous month.
   `A large increase in aircraft and parts was partially offset by
a decline in motor vehicles and parts,'' the report said.
   Excluding transportation, orders were up 1.1 percent.
   The often-volatile defense orders fell 3.0 percent to $7.6
billion after a 21.8 percent decline in June. Excluding defense,
factory orders were up 1.8 percent.
   Shipments of manufactured goods declined 0.8 percent to $237.5
billion following a 0.2 percent increase in June. Unfilled orders
rose 0.6 percent to $520.4 billion, offsetting a 0.6 percent
decline a month earlier.
   Inventories increased 0.7 percent to $373.3 billion, the largest
one-month increase since a 0.8 percent increase last January.
   In addition to transportation, the other major categories also
posted gains in orders.
   Primary metals were up 3.5 percent to $11.9 billion, regaining
their 3.3 percent loss a month earlier.
   Non-electrical machinery orders rose 2.3 percent to $22.3
billion after a 2.2 percent decline in June.
   Electrical machinery orders gained 1.5 percent to $20.3 billion.
They had fallen 3.5 percent the previous month.

   Government troops evacuated more than
40 wounded soldiers from a camp beseiged by Tamil rebel forces, a
top military official said today.
   Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne said two U.S.-made Bell
helicopters were hit by a mortar shell that landed between them but
still managed to evacuate 41 injured soldiers.
   About 50 troops were flown Sunday into the camp in Mullaitivu,
170 miles northeast of Colombo, but the rescue was delayed because
of heavy rebel fire.
   At least five soldiers have been killed at the post, which has
been under assault for about 10 weeks, said another military
official, who cannot be identified under briefing rules.
   The rebels on Wednesday assaulted the camp with mortars, rockets
and small arms fire, injuring one soldier.
   Meanwhile, efforts to relieve about 230 policemen and soldiers
at a 17th-century Dutch fort near the northern city of Jaffna were
set back as rebels blew up several bridges Wednesday, officials
said.
   Elsewhere, a Sinhalese member of a government-armed youth
militia and two civilians have been killed since Wednesday,
officials said. The bodies of two rebels also were found.
   At least 14,000 people have been killed since Tamil guerrillas
began a separatist war in 1983.
   Militants say they need a homeland to preserve their culture and
stop discrimination by Sinhalese in jobs and education.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people, and
Sinhalese make up 75 percent. There is also a Moslem minority.

   Ten National Guard water-purification
specialists bound for the Saudi desert got a patriotic sendoff from
more than 600 townspeople.
   Relatives and friends fought back tears. A choir and a high
school band performed. Yellow ribbons swirled from trees along
Memorial Avenue to Allendale County Courthouse, scene of Wednesday
night's farewell to the state's first Army National Guard unit
called to active duty, the 265th Quartermaster Detatchment.
   ``We're here today just to let the men ... know that the
community supports them 100 percent,'' said Mayor William Holmes,
an Air Force veteran.
   This rural town of 4,500, about 80 miles south of Columbia, is
largely supportive of President Bush's decision to send troops to
Saudi Arabia in an effort to roll back Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   ``I've lived here 21 years and I haven't ever seen the town come
together on one issue like they have on this,'' said Sgt. Joe
Topper, 42, a commercial photographer and spokesman for the South
Carolina National Guard.
   The guardsmen were due to leave this morning for Fort Stewart,
Ga. The unit's four other members left earlier Wednesday for the
military base.
   The detachment will depart for the Middle East as soon as
transportation is ready, said Maj. Gen. T. Eston Marchant, South
Carolina's adjutant general.
   ``If he says that's the thing to do, that's what we do. That's
our job,'' said Sgt. Herman L. Roberts, a 36-year-old mason from
nearby Fairfax who has served in the National Guard for 18 years.
   ``I knew that this day would probably come some time. You have a
few butterflies but it's no problem,'' said Roberts, who leaves
behind his wife, Willie Mae, and their 16-year-old daughter, Tracy.
   Spc. James M. Rooker said two years' training has prepared him
for a military mission, but the reality of going overseas was
taking time to sink in.
   ``Am I prepared to go? No, not really,'' said Rooker, who turned
20 on Aug. 18. ``I'm still saying, `Well, tomorrow morning they'll
just tell us to go home.' But no, that's not the case.''
   Rooker had just enrolled for his junior year at the University
of South Carolina, paid his tuition, rented an apartment and bought
textbooks when the unit got the call Friday to report for active
duty.
   His mother, Ima Jean, dabbed her eyes during the 45-minute
ceremony.
   ``I just wish that it didn't have to happen like this, that
things could have been settled through negotiations,'' she said.
   Her son, dressed in camouflage gear, sat on a podium with the
other guardsmen. To their right was a granite memorial inscribed
with the names of 20 dead from World War I, 33 from World War II,
six from the Korean War and nine from the Vietnam War.
   ``We just hope that he'll come back safe and sound,'' Mrs.
Rooker said. ``That's our big thing. We don't mind him going.
   ``We want him to serve his country because he's a big military
person,'' she said. ``He's always been. Even when he was in school,
he knew every name for every airplane and every ship.''

   Irish singer Sinead O'Connor
disguised herself with a brown wig and baseball cap to watch
demonstrators protesting her refusal to allow the American national
anthem to be played before a concert.
   Before a concert, the cropped-haired 23-year-old singer went
nearly unrecognized Wednesday evening at the Saratoga Performing
Arts Center but walked away when some fans and television reporters
caught on to her.
   Later, during her concert, she thanked her fans for their
support.
   ``I never said I had disrespect for the American people,''
O'Connor said. ``I have nothing but respect for people of any
country.''
   O'Connor drew the ire of protesters for her refusal to perform
at the Garden State Arts Center in New Jersey last week unless the
arena dispensed with its usual practice of playing ``The
Star-Spangled Banner'' before concerts. Arena officials relented
but later banned O'Connor from appearing there again.
   Several radio stations in New York and New Jersey have banned
her songs. They were joined Wednesday by KGGI-FM in San Bernardino,
Calif.
   About 10 demonstrators sang the national anthem outside the
Saratoga Performing Arts Center gates Wednesday evening and urged
fans not to enter.
   O'Connor, whose hits include ``No One Compares 2 U'' and
``Mandinka,'' watched for more than a half hour without talking to
the demonstrators or her fans, said Donna Eichmeyer, SPAC
spokeswoman.
   ``She was concerned,'' Eichmeyer said. ``She wanted to hear what
they had to say.''
   Four songs into her show, O'Connor stopped to tell the fans she
was touched by their show of support. She also said she was
gratified the fans let the protest continue without incident,
because the demonstrators ``had a right to be there as well.''
   Elaine Schock, a spokeswoman for O'Connor, called the decision
by some radio stations to stop playing O'Connor songs ``absurd. A
lot of these stations have only played one song of hers (`Nothing
Compares 2 U') which is basically over as a hit anyway, and then
ban her. Then they go declaring themselves `Sinead-free Radio.'''

<HEAD>Government to Cut Lights, Water to Some Townships</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM COHEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government announced today
that it will stop paying for electricity and other essential
services in black and mixed race townships hit by rent boycotts.
   Planning and Provincial Affairs Minister Hernus Kriel said
services would be ``phased out'' in townships where people failed
to pay for them because of rent boycotts protesting conditions in
the segregated settlements.
   ``We do not intend to cut off electricity in sensitive areas
where essential services will be affected, like hospitals,'' he
told reporters.
   ``We also do not want to jeopardize the health of the community
by cutting off the water totally, but we will reduce the flow of
water or install services where members of the community can only
use water at certain times of day.''
   The announcement came as police confronted protesting residents
of the mixed-race Ennerdale township, firing tear gas to disperse
the crowd. Later, more than 500 people marched through the township
to protest what they claimed were incorrect utility bills.
   Also today, the independent South African Press Association
reported that negotiators were finishing a draft agreement to end a
5-year-old rent boycott in Soweto, the black township of 2 million
people near Johannesburg.
   Since the boycotts started some five years ago as a protest
against high rents and poor conditions, local township governments
have been unable to pay electricity, water and sewage bills to
power companies and others.
   The government has helped make up the difference, but Kriel said
today that it would stop that practice.
   ``Suppliers of such services will have no choice but to
discontinue their services to certain communities, especially those
with a poor record of payment,'' Kriel told a news conference in
Pretoria.
   ``The government simply does not have the funds to continue to
provide bridging finance and the onus to pay for these services
rests with the consumers themselves,'' he said.
   On Tuesday, electricity, water and sewage services were cut in
the Silobela township in the Orange Free State in central South
Africa. Township residents complained they never had taken part in
a rent boycott.
   Security forces patrolled the township Wednesday and today.
Perishable food was rotting and residents collected water from a
nearby stream.
   The conflicts have so far involved the black and mixed-race
townships against white local authorities.
   Kriel said rent boycotts had increased in recent months despite
warnings from the government.
   He accused some township residents of being intimidated by
militants into joining the boycott. But Kriel said the government's
position was that township residents had the ultimate
responsibility for paying their bills.
   He said electricity would be cut off first, then garbage
collection.

   Diplomats in the Iraqi capital today were
pessimistic that the promised release of foreign women and children
would get under way before the weekend.
   ``No one expects any development before Saturday,'' said one
senior diplomat involved with negotiations with the Iraqi
authorities. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had said that women and
children among the foreigners held in Iraq would be allowed to
leave starting Wednesday.
   Diplomats said today that Iraq had demanded that foreign planes
wishing to fly to Baghdad to airlift stranded Western women and
children would be allowed to land only if they carry food and
medicines.
   But Iraq's ambassador to the United States denied Baghdad had
made such a demand. ``It is absolutely not true,'' the ambssador,
Mohamed al-Mashat, told reporters after visiting the State
Department.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus,
said today a total of 237 foreign women and children ``guests'' had
requested by today to leave the country, and 28 had said they
wished to remain. It did not elaborate.
   In another development, the British Broadcdling paperwork to send women
and children home.
   ``The situation in Kuwait is rather complicated by the fact that
it is impossible for people to come to us and hand in their
passports,'' said the spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   If an airlift of the trapped foreign women and children is not
allowed, the Western evacuees will travel in convoys overland, most
likely to the Turkish border, 370 miles north of Baghdad, the
diplomats said, insisting on anonymity.
   They said in telephone interviews that by midday in Baghdad, no
exit visa had been issued for any Westerner, pending a response
from foreign governments to the demand for food and medicines.
   The senior diplomat said embassies in Baghdad were asked to
compile detailed lists of the women and children who will be
leaving, ``and that will take all day.''
   ``Tomorrow no government department will be open,'' he said,
noting that it was Friday, the Moslem sabbath.
   He and two others interviewed said they did not believe Western
governments would agree to Iraq's request for food and medicines,
which would go against the embargo imposed after the Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.
   Iraq closed its airspace to all foreign airlines after the
invasion and subsequent annexation of Kuwait. Its national carrier,
Iraqi Airways, is flying only to Amman, Jordan.
   Kuwait's airport also has been closed since the invasion.
   Hundreds of thousands of Arabs have crossed into Jordan through
the border post at Ruweishid after fleeing Kuwait and Iraq.
   But more than 20,000 Westerners and Japanese stranded in Kuwait
and Iraq have not been allowed to leave as Iraqis insisted their
presence would prevent a potential attack by U.S.-led Western
forces assembled in Saudi Arabia.
   Saddam said Tuesday he would allow the women and children to
leave to preserve the Arabs ``humanitarian image.''
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Wednesday
that about one-third of the 3,000 Americans who have been barred
from leaving Iraq and Kuwait are women or children age 18 and under.
   She also said that, if implemented, Saddam's policy shift was a
``significant step in the right direction.'' She refused, however,
to say whether the new policy improves the climate for a negotiated
settlement.

   NASA reported a problem today with
communications lines to the Astro observatory that is due to be
taken aloft on space shuttle Columbia this weekend.
   Information is not being received over the lines that link Astro
with computers in the launch control center, officials said. The
lines are used to monitor the observatory's X-ray telescope.
   Test director Al Sofge declined to say what might happen if the
problem is not resolved soon. The trouble was discovered after
Columbia's payload bay doors were closed Wednesday night.
   ``We don't know where we're at at this point,'' Sofge said.
``All we know that we've lost at this point is our land line.''
   Columbia is scheduled to lift off at 1:17 a.m. EDT Saturday on a
nine- to 10-day astronomy mission.
   During the shuttle flight, the $150 million Astro observatory is
due to probe some of the hottest objects in the universe. Astro
will be brought back to Earth when the shuttle returns; it may be
used on another mission later.
   Before the latest problem developed, Columbia's seven astronauts
retruned for their second launch attempt, expressing confidence
that the newly repaired shuttle will carry them safely into space
this weekend.
   ``We've been waiting all summer. There have been some musical
chairs'' with missions, Columbia's commander Vance Brand said
Wednesday night. ``We're just more than happy to be back again.''
   ``I'm looking forward to going out and doing my part,'' said
astronaut Sam Durrance. ``I just hope we can go up and do what
we're supposed to do and bring back some real exciting
discoveries.''
   NASA will be making its second attempt to launch Columbia. The
shuttle was supposed to go up May 30, but hydrogen escaped during
fueling and the flight was called off.
   Atlantis was next in line, but its classified Pentagon mission
was delayed from July to November when similar leaks were found.
The discovery prompted NASA to temporarily ground the entire
three-shuttle fleet.
   ``There is anxiety,'' said mission scientist Ted Gull. ``NASA
needs to be successful.''
   Durrance and three other astronomers aboard will operate Astro's
three ultraviolet telescopes. The mission originally was scheduled
for March 1986, but the Challenger disaster earlier that year
delayed the flight and all others.

   Stanford University has buried tons of
emergency supplies at secret locations around campus to help feed
and care for students if another big earthquake strikes.
   The 13,350-student university sustained $160 million damaqe in
last October's earthquake. Hundreds of students were forced out of
their campus homes. Some slept on lawns while repairs were made or
temporary housing found.
   A dozen fiberglass containers, each filled with 3 tons of
medical supplies, flashlights and dehydrated food, were sunk into
10-foot-deep underground storage sites recently.
   Each container has enough food for 10,000 students and
university employees for two days. The supplies are expected to
last up to 20 years.
   ``Stanford wants to do a bit more for its students to give them
what they need in the event their homes go down in an earthquake,''
said Barbara Tiernan, campus health and safety systems coordinator.

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Texas Department of Criminal Justice has
granted a Texas Ku Klux Klan group permission to mail such
publications as ``Negro Watch,'' ``Jew Watch'' and ``Knightly
News'' to prison inmate subscribers.
   Prison officials said inmates have been receiving Klan and
extreme right- and left-wing publications for the past five to 10
years, following a court ruling that opened the door to a more
liberal prison mailing rules. But they had not been allowed to
receive publications from a Texas Klan group.
   Civil rights groups criticized the decision announced Wednesday,
saying the publications would only fuel prison violence.
   ``The prisons are hotbeds of racial unrest. These publications
must make a bad situation worse,'' said Loren Finkelstein, director
of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith's southwest regional
office in Houston.
   Prison officials said all periodicals sent inmates are subject
to review on an issue-by-issue basis.

   This community in forested central Oregon
has plenty of space and plenty of pines, but some trouble keeping
the space before the Pine.
   Witness LaPine Auto Supply, LaPine Realty, LaPine Animal
Hospital.
   The book compiling local lore has it spelled La Pine in the
text. But the cover reads ``History of the LaPine Pioneers.''
   Howard Anderson, owner of LaPine Drug Inc., said he never really
thought about the spelling when he bought the drugstore 10 years
ago and changed the name from Gordon's.
   ``I probably just didn't know any different at that time,''
Anderson said.
   Rusty Nalley, who started the local newspaper The Citizen four
years ago, says she consulted with old-timers and went back through
the books before settling on the spelling La Pine.
   Residents such as Helma Holverstott who have studied the issue
have traced La Pine to a developer's document from about 1910.
   ``I don't know where that one word with the capital `P' in the
middle came from,'' Holverstott said.
   ``That's a real bone of contention,'' said Nalley. ``Even the
residents of La Pine all spell it differently, and unless the town
is incorporated, I really don't see anything but a big dispute over
it,'' Nalley said.
   Postal authorities added to the confusion by establishing a
postmark spelled Lapine, but they switched to La Pine in 1951.

   Brian Keenan, who spent 4{ years as a
hostage in Lebanon, today called for negotiations to release others
from a capitivity he recalled as ``a silent screaming slide into
the bowels of ultimate despair.''
   ``It's time to talk. It's obviously time to talk. There is a
willingness. Why not talk?'' Keenan told a news conference.
   Keenan, a native of Belfast, Northern Ireland, was released by
his captors last week and handed over to Irish authorities in
Damascus, Syria, on Saturday. He was released from the private
Mater hospital in Dublin this morning.
   Speaking slowly, sometimes pausing to avoid crying, Keenan
talked at length about life in captivity.
   ``Hostage is crucifying aloneness. There's a silent screaming
slide into the bowels of ultimate despair,'' he said, reading from
a hand-written statement.
   ``Hostage is a man hanging by his fingernails over the edge of
chaos and feeling his fingers slowly straightening.
   ``Hostage is the humiliating stripping away of every sense and
fiber of body and mind and spirit that make you what you are.
   ``Hostage is a mutant creation full of self-loathing, guilt and
death-wishing, but he's a man, a rare unique and beautiful creation
of which these things are no part.''
   ``Tiny, tiny cells, constant blindfolds, prolonged days in the
dark, sometimes weeks without light, create kinds of insanity that
drive men deep, deep into themselves,'' Keenan said.
   Keenan, who was teaching English in Beirut when he was kidnapped
on April 11, 1986, spoke with particular affection of British
journalist John McCarthy, with whom he had been held.
   ``Other people one begins to look at with strange mistrustful
apprehension, but the irrepressible wit that is the golden kernel
of John coped ultimately and always emerged,'' he said.
   Jill Morrell, McCarthy's friend who was seated behind Keenan,
broke into a bright smile as Keenan talked about his fellow captive.
   Keenan described American hostage Terry Anderson, the chief
Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, as ``a bulky and
belligerent newspaperman'' with a voracious appetite for
intellectual conversations.
   Thomas Sutherland, a Scottish-born American who was acting dean
of agriculture at the American University of Beirut, gave the other
hostages long lectures on genetics, animal husbandry and his
beloved 27-year-old Volvo car, Keenan said.
   Thirteen Westerners, including six Americans, are still held in
Lebanon by extremists groups believed to have ties with Iran.
   Anderson, the longest-held Western hostage, was kidnapped in
Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   McCarthy was kidnapped April 17, 1986, and Sutherland on June 9,
1985.
   Keenan said Anderson suffered from a digestive ailment and was
frequently in pain, but he took it stoically ``for in truth all
pain and illness was generally dismissed by our keepers, though
they would eventually supply us with some form of antibiotics.''
   Keenan said Anderson sometimes kept him awake for hours of
conversation.
   ``I think he debated with himself a lot while we tried to plug
our ears,'' Keenan joked. ``Terry would also have his periods of
despair and seek solace in his family. Terry and myself would sit
through those long nights and speak with great pain and remorse and
longing for his daughter (Gabrielle).''
   ``With many tears he would elaborate his plans when he was
finally back in the States to help her to shape and discover her
future.
   ``In those confessional moments which were common to us all, a
deep and enduring and unbreakable bond was formed.''
   He said Anderson talked of starting a project for delinquent
boys in the United States.
   Keenan said he last saw Anderson 11 months ago and that they
spent eight months together.
   ``The `doyen of hostages,' as he has been called, is a man who
felt so committed to these things that he inspired us to our own
survival projects,'' Keenan said of Anderson.
   To a reporter who asked how he felt about the prospect of
returning home to Belfast, Keenan said: ``I've been locked up in a
hole in the ground for four years. How would you feel?''
   Keenan appealed to journalists to be careful about their
reporting.
   ``All of us are but teeth on a comb and if one of us is snapped
off in a sudden rage it cannot, cannot be put back.''
   Keenan said he did not see British hostage Terry Waite, though
he was aware at one time of the presence of another prisoner he
could not identify.
   ``I felt in the last place we were in there was certainly
another hostage whom I heard in the early hours of the morning
saying `Oh no, oh no.' That could be French, that could be
anything,'' he said.

   U.S. Coast Guardsmen trained for
Caribbean drug interdiction have been added to Navy ``boarding
teams'' enforcing the economic embargo of Iraq, U.S. military
sources said Thursday.
   The Coast Guardsmen arrived in the Persian Gulf region this week
and are aboard several of the 27 U.S. ships patrolling the gulf,
the Arabian Sea and the Red Sea, the sources said. They spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The combined teams of five to 10 Navy and Coast Guard members
carry sidearms and M-16 assault rifles when they board ships,
usually from small boats.
   The teams question ships' officers and ask to inspect the cargo.
If one is found to have Iraqi connections, the ship may be
``diverted'' to another port, said the sources.
   They said U.S. warships have intercepted about 170 ships and
boarded at least 10 in the gulf and Red Sea since President Bush
issued his Aug. 16 order aimed at strangling Iraq's economy and
war-making potential.
   While most were allowed to continue, the sources said, Navy
boarders found at least two with Iraqi-related cargo and induced
them to alter their sailing plans. ``Usually this means they are
asked to return to their port of origin,'' said a gulf-based source.
   One ship, a Chinese freighter, went to a southern gulf port
after a team from the cruiser USS England found it was carrying
Iraqi fertilizer. The sources said they could not provide details
on the other ship.
   ``Challenging'' a ships' identity and destination is a routine
naval practice in peacetime.
   Most interceptions occur in the Persian Gulf and its gateway,
the Strait of Hormuz. Others have taken place in the approaches to
Jordan's Red Sea port of Aqaba, a key port used to import goods
destined for Iraq.
   According to Lloyds Shipping Intelligence service in London, a
number of ships have been turned away there and at least one was
boarded in recent days but allowed to proceed.
   The U.S. sources said there have been no incidents of resistance
or shooting since Aug.18, when two American missile frigates fired
warning shots in an attempt to stop a pair of Iraqi tankers exiting
the gulf.
   Still under surveillance, the tankers reached the Yemeni port of
Aden on the south Arabian peninsula, where they remain anchored,
the sources said.
   Yemen has denied the ships unloaded at Aden.
   The sources said no other Iraqi oil carriers have been sighted
moving to or from Kuwait or southern Iraq since the firing
incidents.
   Since that incident, it was reported that Iraqi officials had
instructed ship captains not to resist challenges by U.S. and other
warships, a move that analysts saw as possibly eliminating one key
potential ``trigger'' for war.
   The Coast Guard was brought into the gulf operation because it
has men specially trained to board and inspect ships at sea, said
Lt. Cmdr. Paul Milligan, a Coast Guard spokesman in New York.
   He said the teams sent to the gulf were veterans of the
7-year-old U.S. drug interdiction program in the Caribbean, where
they also operate from Navy ships.
   Neither Milligan nor military sources in the region could say
how many Coast Guardsmen were assigned to the gulf.
   British defense sources were unable to say how many
interceptions or boardings had been carried out by the three Royal
Navy warships in the gulf, or whether they had found any with Iraqi
cargo.
   In another development, military sources said two Australian
missile frigates have arrived in the gulf, bringing the total
number of warships directly involved in the multinational blockade
force to at least 32. Three Italian, six French warships are also
en route.

   Unidentified gunmen on Thursday shot to
death an official of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah
guerrilla faction near this southern port city.
   A Palestine Liberation Organization statement said Ibrahim
Hourani, 37, was killed by four men who stormed into his house at
the Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp and opened fire with automatic
rifles.
   Ein el-Hilweh is the largest Palestinian refugee camp in
Lebanon. It is on the eastern edge of Sidon, 25 miles south of
Beirut.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with
regulations, said Fatah guerrillas launched a series of house raids
in the shantytown after the assassination in search of the
assailants.
   ``They captured about a half-dozen men,'' the police spokesman
said without further elaboration.
   Sidon is Arafat's stronghold in Lebanon. He maintains about
5,000 hardcore guerrillas in the area. Fatah is the main guerrilla
faction within the PLO.

<TEXT>
   Only 13 of the 21 members of the Arab League
attended a meeting of Arab foreign ministers today to discuss
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the Middle East News Agency reported.
   The absenteeism reflects the split among Arabs caused by the
Aug. 2 invasion and Iraq's subsequent annexation of Kuwait.
   The meeting will receive a report from Chadli Klibi, the
league's secretary-general, on implementation of resolutions passed
at an Arab summit held in Cairo on Aug. 10.
   At that summit, the same members represented at today's meeting
minus Libya condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, said they
continued to regard Sheik Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah as Kuwait's
legitimate ruler, and agreed to send troops to Saudi Arabia to
protect it against a possible Iraqi invasion.
   Only Egypt, Syria and Morocco have sent token troop contingents
to the U.S.-led multinational force being deployed in Saudi Arabia
and the Persian Gulf.
   In Moscow, the Soviet news agency Tass said today that Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze sent an urgent message to his Arab
counterparts urging them to work together to prevent a Middle East
war.
   ``Shevardnadze said that Arabs' ability to unite at a critical
moment largely determines whether or not a war in the Middle East
region can be prevented,'' said Tass, which did not release a text
of the message.
   Egypt's state-owned Middle East News Agency said foreign
ministers of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Lebanon, Qatar, Kuwait,
Bahrain, Morocco, United Arab Emirates and Somalia attended today's
meeting.
   Oman sent an undersecretary in its foreign ministry, Djibouti
was represented by its interior minister, and Libya sent Ahmed
Qazzaf-el-dam, a cousin of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
   Diplomatic sources have said the main aim of the meeting is to
maintain pressure on Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, who has
ignored the Arab League resolutions. But under Arab League rules,
resolutions accepted by simple majorities are binding only on
members voting for them.
   Iraq, Jordan, Sudan, the Palestine Liberation Organization,
Tunisia, Yemen, Mauritania and Algeria ignored Egypt's call for the
meeting in Cairo today.

   Jordan's ambassador to the United States said
Thursday that the U.S. military presence in the Middle East will
radicalize the region and ``endanger the existing Arab political
order.''
   ``Do not delude yourselves that most Arabs welcome the presence
of American troops in the area,'' Ambassador Hussein Hammami said
at the National Press Club.
   Hammami also said a settlement to the crisis caused by Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait must be linked to the Palestinian problem and
the Arab conflict with Israel.
   Jordan, he said, needs about $2 billion a year in aid over the
next five years to compensate for economic losses sustained by
supporting sanctions against Iraq. He welcomed a reported plan
under which President Bush would ask U.S. allies to assist
countries affected by the trade embargo against Iraq.
   Jordan's King Hussein, while condemning Iraq's Aug. 2 takeover
of Kuwait, has differed sharply with Washington over the
introduction of American troops in the region and sought to keep
the door open for mediation with Iraq.
   Hammami said Jordan was not siding with Iraq and that King
Hussein was a voice of sanity in a ``climate of frenzy.''
   U.S. troops in the area, Hammami said, ``can only fuel radical
sentiments in the Arab world, endanger the existing Arab political
order, and hit hard at American and Western interests in the Middle
East.''
   He said the radical right in Jordan has for the first time
joined he radical left, including communists, to oppose the U.S.
presence.
   The Jordanian envoy said Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait would
only bring temporary respite to the Mideast crisis.
   ``One cannot divorce the Kuwaiti problem from the Palestinian
problem or the variety of other problems that have plagued Arab
societies,'' Hammami said.
   He said the United States, in opposing Iraq's occupation of
Kuwait, should also move to end Israel's occupation of territory in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``We would like to see the standards applied to Kuwait also
applied to Palestinians,'' he said.
   Iraq's President Saddam Hussein has suggested that a withdrawal
of Iraqi troops from Kuwait was possible if Israel pulled out of
occupied territory.
   Hammami said Jordan supported U.N. resolutions on economic
sanctions against Iraq, but asked: ``Are we required to commit
national suicide?''
   He said Jordan's losses from the sanctions would include $200
million annually in exports to Iraq, $250 million in transit
business, $180 million in higher oil prices, $310 million in debt
repayment from Iraq, $135 million in grants pledged by Kuwait and
$320 million in remittances from Jordanians working in Kuwait.
   Most of the 100,000 Jordanians in Kuwait will return home,
boosting unemployment in Jordan from 15 percent to a possible 35
percent, he said.
   Hammami said the $2 billion in grants and cheap loans needed
over the next five years amount to about 50 percent of Jordan's
gross domestic product.
   He said no ship with goods bound for Iraq had entered the
Jordanian port of Aqaba since Aug. 19, but that Jordan would
continue to allow food and other basic commodities into Iraq unless
it receives other guidelines from the U.N.
   ``The Iraqis as a people should not be punished,'' he said.
   Hammami denied reports that Jordan was training the Iraqi
military in the use of U.S. Hawk missiles seized in Kuwait.
   ``We have not in any way helped the Iraqis in this crisis,'' he
said.

   At least 9,000 people have AIDS in Zimbabwe and about 466,000

disease.
   In addition to requiring medical tests, insurance companies are
also going to lower the limit on retirement policies from 50 years

   In Africa, AIDS is mainly spread by heterosexual contact,

   Diplomats in Baghdad said Iraq will allow planes to pick up
trapped Western women and children only if the aircraft fly food
and medicine into Iraq. But Iraq's ambassador to the United States
today denied that.
   The Iraqi envoy, Mohamed al-Mashat, said Baghdad had attached no
such conditions to the release of the foreigners.
   ``It is absolutely not true,'' he told reporters after a visit
to the State Department. ``I categorically deny that.''
   If flights could not be arranged, the Western evacuees would
have to travel overland, most likely to Turkey, 370 miles north of
the capital, said the diplomats in Baghdad, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Iraq's airspace is closed to all foreign carriers.
   Red tape will prevent any release before Saturday, a senior
diplomat said.
   Iraq promised Tuesday that the thousands of Western women and
children would be able to begin leaving the next day. But President
Saddam Hussein has yet to fulfill the promise.
   Of the 21,000 Western hostages in Iraq and Kuwait, 3,000 are
Americans, including about 1,000 women and children.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. said a group of captive
foreigners was paraded before the international press in Baghdad
today.
   ``It was for some of them a rather distressing experience _
children cried a great deal and some of the women cried,''
correspondent John Simpson reported. The nationalities of the
foreigners involved was not known.
   On Wednesday, Saddam denied seeking a deal for an Iraqi
withdrawal from Kuwait despite mounting international military and
economic pressure. Iraqi seized the oil-rich emirate on Aug. 2 and
later annexed it.
   In other developments:
   _U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, heading for
talks in Jordan with Iraq's foreign minister, said today he seeks
to apply Security Council resolutions _ not to negotiate what has
been decided. The main resolution calls for Iraq's withdrawal from
Kuwait.
   ``It is not my job, and I want to be very clear about it, to
negotiate the resolutions,'' he said during a stopover in Paris.
   Perez de Cuellar said he will meet with Tariq Aziz on Friday
morning, according to U.N. officials in New York.
   _President Bush will dispatch high-level aides to solicit funds
from several wealthy countries to defray $1 billion in monthly
costs for the U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf, officials
said today in Washington.
   _The Arab League was meeting in Cairo today to hear a report on
whether any progress had been made in implementing its resolutions
on the invasion, which call for an Iraqi withdrawal. Only 13 of the
21 league members showed up, reflecting the divisions the invasion
has caused in the Arab world.
   _Turkey said today that it had rejected an Iraqi request to
resume food shipments for needy Iraqi children, saying it will
adhere to the U.N.-ordered embargo on trade with Baghdad.
   _A U.S. diplomatic source confirmed reports that resistance
fighters in Kuwait are receiving American logistical support.
   _In New York, 36 expelled Iraqi diplomats and their families
left early today on a plane for Jordan. Washington ordered them out
in reaction to a series of Iraqi moves against the U.S. Embassy in
Kuwait and its staff.
   _Two Westerners made it to safety in Jordan today, one an
American of Indian origin and a 17-year-old British girl of Arab
extraction. They were among 185 evacuees who flew into Jordan
aboard the daily Iraqi Airways flight.
   The American, J.N. Sharma, 55, an agricultural engineer from
Idaho Falls, Idaho, told reporters he had spent three weeks hiding
in occupied Kuwait. He said he hid his U.S. passport and left Iraq
using an Indian travel document.
   The senior foreign diplomat in Baghdad, who is involved in
negotiations with Iraqi authorities, said embassies were asked to
compile detailed lists of the women and children who will be
leaving, ``and that will take all day.''
   Diplomats said they were drawing up lists for exit visas.
   ``Tomorrow no government department will be open,'' the diplomat
noted, referring to Friday, the Moslem sabbath. ``No one expects
any development before Saturday.'' He and two others said they did
not believe Western governments would agree to Iraq's request
flights containing food and medicine.
   Iraq has been feeling the effects of the militarily enforced
U.N. embargo. Bread lines have been reported in the country, and
Saddam has urged Iraqi women to cut meat and bread consumption in
half.
   Saddam gave his first interviews to Western reporters _ with Dan
Rather of CBS and a French network _ since his forces seized Kuwait.
   The Iraqi leader told Rather on Wednesday that ``Kuwait is part
of Iraq'' and denied seeking any deals that could lead to an Iraqi
pullout.
   ``Iraq will come out victorious,'' Saddam said. ``God is on our
side and Satan is on the side of the United States.''
   A White House official confirmed Wednesday that the Bush
administration had received a secret Iraqi offer to free all
captives and withdraw from Kuwait if certain conditions were met.
The conditions were that the U.N.-ordered embargo on trade with
Iraq be lifted and that Baghdad be granted access to the Persian
Gulf and sole control of an oil field that dips into Kuwait,
according to a report Wednesday by the New York newspaper Newsday.
   The White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the offer was rejected.
   Saddam told a newsman from Frace's TF1 on Tuesday that he is not
an easy target because he does not remain in one place ``to invite
being bombed.''
   The State Department says Iraq has apparently moved 70 Americans
to military and industrial installations to prevent a U.S. attack.
   Nevertheless, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said on Wednesday that if Saddam carries out his promise to free
the Western women and children, it will be ``a significant step in
the right direction.''
   Saddam previously offered to free the 21,000 Western hostages if
Washington withdraws its more than 60,000-member force from the
region and guarantees the embargo is lifted. The United States
rejected the offer.
   Perez de Cuellar was to discuss the crisis Friday with Iraqi
Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz in Amman. The U.N. chief, who stopped
over in Paris on Wednesday, was expected to arrive in the Jordanian
capital this afternoon.
   Senior Arab military officials said Wednesday that the talks
could touch on plans by Saddam to give Kuwait limited self-rule in
a bid to ease the crisis. The officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Saddam was likely to announce the move before the
end of September.
   The U.N. trade embargo, aimed at forcing Iraq into pulling out
of Kuwait, got an important boost from OPEC and Japan on Wednesday.
   OPEC oil ministers approved a plan allowing Saudi Arabia,
Venezuela and other members of the cartel to pump more oil and help
hold down crude prices. One OPEC minister predicted the agreement
could replace 3 million of the 4 million barrels of oil the day
that disappeared from the world market because of the embargos on
Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil.
   That shortfall caused oil prices to skyrocket.
   Japan said today that it plans to initially spend $1 billion on
medics, transportation and non-lethal aid for the multinational
force challenging Iraq. However, Tokyo ruled out a role for Japan's
military.
   A U.S. diplomatic source confirmed in general terms news reports
that the CIA and Army Special Forces troops were helping the
Kuwaiti resistance in hit-and-run attacks on Iraqi occupiers.
   Two television networks, NBC and CNN, said no U.S. troops were
directly involved in fighting but that Kuwaiti fighters based on
the Saudi-Kuwait border were getting U.S. intelligence, weapons,
radios, advice and instruction.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: ``We're
aware of their action and we're supporting them,'' but claimed to
be unaware of details.

   Bombs exploded in a passenger train,
a bazaar and in a fruit cart in separate incidents Thursday,
killing 11 people and injuring 61, railway and police sources said.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for any of the
blasts, which occurred in a three-hour period.
   Seven people died when a bomb went off in the bathroom of a
train 12 miles east of Islamabad, said Khalid Mahmud, divisional
transport officer of state-owned Pakistan Railways. He told The
Associated Press the dead were two men, two women and three
children. Six people were injured.
   The train was 55 minutes into its five-hour jorney from
Rawalpindi, outside Islamabad, to Lahore, a distance of 180 miles.
   In Faisalabad, 160 miles southeast of Islambad, four people died
and 25 were injured when a bomb exploded in a fruit vendor's cart,
police said.
   The third bombing occurred in the bazaar of Muridkey, 150 miles
southeast of Islamabad. It injured 30 people, police said.
   Authorities have blamed a rash of bombings in recent months on
government agents from neighboring India. Predominantly Hindu India
and Moslem Pakistan have been hostile neighbors since their
creation in the 1947 partition.
   Tensions have increased since a Moslem secessionist uprising in
the Indian state of Jammu-Kashmir flared anew.
   In addition, since the start of 1979 war in neighboring
Afghanistan, hundreds of explosions have taken place in Pakistan.
Islamabad has blamed the Afghan secret service for many of those
bombings.
   Pakistan and United States have aided the Afghan guerrillas
fighting the Communist government in Afghanistan.

   Investigators say the serial killer
stalking Gainesville college students is a shrewd, ``methodical
maniac'' with a talent for slipping inside windows or doors and a
sick grudge against slim brunettes.
   An army of investigators, including an FBI expert who worked on
the Ted Bundy, Charles Manson and ``Son of Sam'' cases, has
descended on this terrified college town in the hunt for the killer
of four young women and a man.
   The victims _ students at either the University of Florida or
Santa Fe Community College _ were stabbed to death in off-campus
apartments in three attacks discovered since Sunday. Police said
three of the women were mutilated.
   More that a thousand friends and family members gathered at a
Pompano Beach church today to mourn one of the victims, 18-year-old
Sonja Larson.
   Her boyfriend, Mic Ocasio, wept uncontrollably as the Rev. Ken
Smith called the murders ``tragic, painful, scary and horrible.''
   ``Was it just last week we sat and talked about the future? ...
Now it's gone, all gone.''
   Police Chief Wayland Clifton said Wednesday that the killer
apparently tracked certain types of women and entered their
apartments through unlocked doors or windows or by forcing
sliding-glass doors.
   ``There is a similarity in physical appearance in the four
female victims as far as hair color, eye color and general physical
build,'' Clifton said.
   But he warned that the killer could strike at other types or
find other ways of gaining entry. ``He can change his method of
operations as he desires,'' he said. ``We've gotten a rather shrewd
individual on our hands.''
   ``We do feel we we have someone who is methodical about the way
he handles things,'' Clifton said. ``We believe the suspect had
prior knowledge of the occupants of a dwelling.''
   Police have refused to say whether any of the victims were
sexually assaulted.
   The chief said police believed the killer was still in the area
and that there was enough evidence to track him down. ``Each
passing hour, we feel much more confident that we will be able to
bring this case to a successful closure,'' he said.
   The bodies of Miss Larson and her roommate, Christina Powell,
17, were found Sunday, authorities said. The body of Christa Hoyt,
18, was found Monday. The bodies of Tracey Inez Paules, 23, and
Manuel R. Taboada, 23, were discovered Tuesday.
   All were students either at the University of Florida or Santa
Fe Community College, and all were found in campus-area apartments.
   A double killing was reported Wednesday at a house in Melrose,
about 20 miles northeast of Gainesville, and authorities sought to
allay fears that it was related to the deaths here. Sheriff's
spokesman Spencer Mann said it was ``unlikely it's linked to the
series of homicides.'' Police said the victims were in their late
30s but released no other details.
   Since the killings, hundreds of students have gone home to their
parents or moved in with friends in hopes of finding safety in
numbers. Some armed themselves with guns, Mace and knives, and
stores reported a run on deadbolt locks and even broomsticks that
residents were using to secure doors and windows.
   Mail carriers, pizza deliverers and other service workers were
told to be careful not to alarm jumpy residents. Police warned
people not to open their doors without asking for identification.
   The university did not cancel classes but suspended attendance
regulations.
   Three of the women had multiple stab wounds; the breasts of two
of them had been cut with a surgically sharp instrument, said
investigators speaking on condition of anonymity. The third woman
was decapitated.
   The Orlando Sentinel reported her head was found on a shelf in
her apartment, but Sheriff Lu Hindery would not comment on that.
The newspaper also said the hands, legs or mouth of several of the
women were bound with tape.
   About 600 local police, state law officers and FBI agents were
investigating and providing security at apartment complexes.
   An FBI team and state experts worked on a psychological profile
of the killer. Among the FBI experts was John Douglas, who was
involved in the serial homicide cases of Bundy _ who died in
Florida's electric chair last year _ Manson and David Berkowitz,
the 1970s ``Son of Sam'' killer in New York City.
   Criminologist Alexander Bassin of Florida State University,
where Bundy killed two women in a sorority house rampage, said
there was ``an absolutely chilling resemblance'' between the
Gainesville slayings and the Bundy murders of 1978.
   University of Florida criminologist Ronald Akers said the killer
``is most likely white, older than his victims and probably has a
background of violence.''

<TEXT>
   The latest lyrical blow-up in the summer of 2
Live Crew involves the Geto Boys, a Houston-based rap group whose
talk of murder, rape, robbery and dismemberment scared Geffen
Records off handling their record.
   Geffen's decision this month again raised questions of
censorship and racism in the record industry. But the label says
it's simply a business decision based on lyrics that glamorized
``violence, racism and misogyny.''
   Not so, says the band, accusing the record company of a double
standard when it comes to standards. Some in the industry suggest
the double standard is based on skin color, not song content. And
women's rights groups remain appalled by the group's insensitive
rhymes.
   ``Imagine a mix of N.W.A.'s violent imagery and 2 Live Crew's
sexual nasties,'' the L.A. Times' Steve Hochman wrote of the Geto
Boys. Rappers N.W.A. had their own lyric problems last year, when
police officers nationwide were riled by a song urging violence
against law enforcement.
   The Geto Boys are just as graphic about violence. A sample
lyric: ``Her body's beautiful, so I'm thinking rape. Shouldn't have
had her curtains open, so that's her fate.''
   ``As a business decision, it's probably crazy. This record, with
the publicity, is no doubt going to sell a lot of copies. We're
talking tonnage,'' Bryn Bridenthal, Geffen vice president of media
and artist relations, said about the LP, ``The Geto Boys.''
   ``I was flabbergasted that people would describe violence that
graphically in music. People will think this is like 2 Live Crew,
which is kind of silly, just pure sex,'' she continued. ``I was
frightened by this.''
   Yet Geffen is the label for heavy metal Guns 'N Roses, which was
accused of racism and homophobia in its lyrics, and it distributes
the infamous Andrew Dice Clay, whose scatological, sexist shows
created a furor earlier this year. Clay, like the Geto Boys, is
signed to Def American.
   ``This is the same label which backed Dice and Guns 'N Roses
without any hesitation, even when there was a big flap. You have to
wonder if this inconsistency borders on racism,'' veteran rap
publicist Bill Adler said last week.
   Debbie Bennett, director of public relations for the 2 Live
Crew's Luke Records, was more direct: ``It's easier to single out a
black group on a small label than any white group. Right now, it
seems like the racist, easy thing to pick on.''
   The controversy is the latest round in the record
labeling-censorship battle. The 2 Live Crew remain under fire for
their ``As Nasty as They Wanna Be'' album, which was ripped for its
graphic sexual content and its denigration of women.
   In Louisiana, a bill requiring labeling for recordings with
potentially offensive lyrics passed the Legislature but was vetoed.
   Artists are striking back. Bruce Springsteen allowed 2 Live Crew
to sample his ``Born in the U.S.A.'' for the group's rap response
to its critics, ``Banned in the U.S.A.'' Neil Young included a song
with an obscenity on his upcoming LP to insure it gets a parental
advisory sticker.
   As for the Geto Boys themselves, lead rapper Bushwick Bill has
defended his lyrics as real-life reports from Houston's destitute
Fifth Ward. Publicist Heidi Robinson says to focus on the salacious
side of the group is to miss the point.
   ``This band is very, very three-dimensional. There are reasons
for the songs they've written,'' said Robinson. ``To dismiss them
as four guys doing this for shock value is to take them simply at
face value.''
   There's little doubt about the offensive content of the black
group's lyrics. ``Mind of a Lunatic'' details the rape and murder
of a woman; ``Trigga Happy Nigga'' is about a liquor store heist
and the slaying of a stool pigeon; ``Gangster of Love'' includes a
litany of graphic sex.
   ``This art perpetuates and makes acceptable certain violence
against women. We think that is abhorrent,'' said Francoise
Jacobsohn, president of the New York chapter of the National
Organization for Women.
   Jacobsohn hailed Geffen's decision, but questioned why the Geto
Boys were singled out: ``We're pleased that misogyny and violence
are out, but we think the same set of rules should apply to Andrew
Dice Clay.''
   Publicist Robinson mentions the positive things the band is
about: ``Life in the Fast Lane'' is an anti-drug song. The group
wants to funnel some of its profits back into the Fifth Ward for a
boys' club. They encourage black youth to get an education.
   ``To focus on violence and sexism is to be flat,
one-dimensional,'' she said. ``They have an awful lot of good
things, too.''

   A mobile kitchen in a truck trailer sent to
help victims of this week's tornadoes exploded and caught fire
today, injuring four workers, police said.
   The explosion occurred when a propane tank overflowed while
being filled from a second truck. The fuel was ignited by a flame
from a stove in the mobile kitchen, Fire Chief George Plese said.
   A fire official had to clamp a hose leading from a propane
supply truck to the kitchen tanks, cut it, then pull the truck away
to stop the fire.
   ``We had a very dangerous situation,'' Plese said.
   The kitchen was being used to serve food to relief workers in
the area about 30 miles southwest of Chicago following a series of
devastating tornadoes Tuesday that left 24 people dead and injured
hundreds of others.
   Police initially reported incorrectly that the vehicle was a Red
Cross truck.
   Four people were taken to St. Joseph's Medical Center in Joliet
with injuries from the blast and fire, said hospital spokeswoman
Nancy Bertnik.
   A man listed in critical condition with burns was transferred to
Loyola University Medical Center in suburban Chicago. Two other men
and one woman were listed in fair condition at St. Joseph's,
Bertnik said.
   Authorities said the most seriously injured man was driving the
propane truck. The others injured were relief workers.

   Robert Whitesel had lived on Nuclear
Drive for 29 years, and the street name seemed grimly appropriate
as he surveyed the tornado-whipped wreckage of his house and those
of his neighbors.
   ``You have to laugh _ you can't cry,'' Whitesel said Wednesday.
``I'll probably rebuild it. In the meantime, I'll live with my
daughter.''
   At least 24 people were killed and more than 300 injured Tuesday
by the tornadoes, which steamrolled virtually without warning
across a region known as ``Tornado Alley,'' about 35 miles
southwest of Chicago. Damage was estimated at more than $100
million.
   Hit hardest were the small towns of Crest Hill and Plainfield,
where hundreds were left homeless.
   National Guardsmen in Crest Hill used dogs, foot patrols and
infrared photography to search for more victims in a muddy
cornfield but found none.
   Six people were believed missing from a seven-building apartment
complex next to the field. At least nine deaths occurred near the
apartments.
   Plainfield residents packed a high school gym Wednesday night to
hear how various government agencies could help. President Bush
declared the region a disaster area and Illinois offered at least
$25 million for low-interest loans.
   The crowd observed a moment of silence for those who died. Then
they got down to the needs of the living _ getting shelter,
portable toilets for neighborhoods without running water, trash
bins for the untold tons of debris.
   More than 70 people remained hospitalized today, at least 11 in
critical condition, authorities said. In addition, a Plainfield man
died of carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator he used when
power was lost in his home.
   And four people were injured today, one critically, when a
mobile kitchen sent in for relief workers exploded and caught fire.
   The explosion occurred when a propane tank overflowed while
being filled from a supply truck and the fuel was ignited by a
flame from a stove in the kitchen set up in a truck trailer, Fire
Chief George Plese said.
   A fire official had to clamp a hose leading from the supply
truck to the kitchen tanks, cut it, then pull the truck away to
stop the fire. ``We had a very dangerous situation,'' Plese said.
   Utility crews worked through the night to restore telephone and
electric service. About 5,000 customers remained without
electricity, officials said.
   The Red Cross, Salvation Army and other charitable groups were
out in force, but self-sufficiency also was evident.
   ``It's the kind of community where neighbors or family say `Stay
with us,' '' said the Rev. Donald Niswonger as he dished out beef
stew, pizza and lasagna at the Plymouth Congregational Church in
Plainfield.
   In Joliet, Roman Catholic Archbishop Joseph Imesch said an
evening Mass for the victims and their families. The tornado ``will
be a reminder of how fragile life is,'' he said.
   At Plainfield High School, newly hired English teacher Jerry
O'Shea stood amid water and broken glass in front of a shattered
trophy case in the main hallway.
   ``This was going to be my first day teaching,'' O'Shea said.
``Welome to Plainfield. I don't know what I'll do now.''
   Most stores along Plainfield's main street were shuttered, but
two insurance agencies were doing brisk business. ``We've had
three-dozen calls since 8 o'clock this morning,'' said Mike Hull of
Plainfield Insurance Agency Inc.

   A constituent of Rep. Buddy Darden who also
happens to be running against the congressman is asking him to help
him stay in the race if his Army reserve unit is called up for
Persian Gulf duty.
   Al Beverly filed a written constituent request this week asking
the Georgia Democrat to sponsor an amendment to the federal Hatch
Act that would clarify its effect on reservists.
   The law prohibits most federal employees from taking an active
role in political campaigns. Beverly fears it could be used to
remove him from the ballot in Georgia's 7th Congressional District
if he is called up.
   Beverly, a captain who commands the Army reserve's 320th
Military Intelligence Company at Fort Gillem, is the Republican
nominee for Darden's seat. The two are to meet in the Nov. 6
election.
   ``My lawyer has looked at it (Hatch Act), and it could be
interpreted _ especially parts of it _ to say that at the same time
I could not be a federal employee and a candidate,'' Beverly said
Thursday. ``All active duty military are federal employees.''
   He said reservists are exempt from the law when not on active
duty.
   Darden's press secretary, Eric Johnson, declined to discuss
Beverly's request, citing the Privacy Act.
   It ``will be treated just like any other request for assistance
we receive,'' he said.
   Beverly, of Marietta, a Georgia Tech researcher in civilian
life, declined to say if he has been told he will be called up. ``I
cannot discuss it. That's sensitive information,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Women and handicapped people are having a
tougher time than healthy men finding work in East Germany's
rapidly shrinking job market, activists said Thursday.
   The government confirmed that disabled workers were being
unfairly targeted for layoffs by factories forced to slash payrolls
to compete in the new capitalist economy.
   Officials also conceded that companies still in a position to
hire people are reluctant to employ women because of special
benefits women were given by the former Communist government.
   Christina Schenk, an official with the Independent Women's
Association, a rights group, said layoffs of East German workers
are being distributed almost evenly among men and women.
   However, women are having a harder time qualifying for jobless
benefits.
   Slightly more than half of the unemployed men are able to
qualify for the minimum jobless benefit, $325 per month, compared
to 27 percent of the women, she said.
   According to Ms. Schenk, men also are three times more likely to
be hired for the increasingly dwindling job openings in the country.
   Gabriela Reinhardt, spokeswoman for the government's Central
Labor Agency, said Ms. Schenk's figures were correct. She said
fewer women qualify for unemployment because many held part-time
jobs.
   Those women still can qualify for social assistance of $263 per
month, she said.
   She conceded that many companies are reluctant to hire women
because East German law currently grants women one paid day off per
month to give them time for housework. She said women also have a
higher absentee rate because of illnesses among their children.
   Experts say more than 90 percent of East German women held jobs
under the former Communist regime, a sharp contrast to West
Germany, where most women stay at home.
   Women's groups have charged that because of the situation in
West Germany, East German women will be forced out of the labor
market when the two German states unite Oct. 3.
   Ilja Seifert, head of the East German Disabled Persons
Association, said handicapped people are among those being targeted
for layoffs first by companies.
   Ms. Reinhardt also said disabled people were losing their jobs
at a disproportionate rate.
   ``Unfortunately, many firms work outside the law,'' she said.
``It is not lawful to fire someone for the sole reason they are
disabled. But unfortunately, it happens often.''
   Seifert and Ms. Schenk both spoke at a news conference called by
activist groups that have formed since East Germany began
experiencing serious economic problems.
   Many East German enterprises, typically overstaffed and often
inefficient and outmoded, have been pushed to the brink of collapse
since East Germany moved to a free market July 1.
   Some experts said East German joblessness could reach 4 million.
   Klaus Grehn, head of a workers' rights group called the
Unemployment Association, said the total number of unemployed in
East Germany is about 1.5 million, or 18 percent of the workforce.
   East Germany pegged its number of jobless at about 350,000 as of
last Friday, about 4 percent.
   Joachim Hildebradt, spokesman for the government Labor
Committee, said Grehn's group counts East Germans who do not fall
under the government's definition of unemployed, and said the
figures were too high.

   Federal health investigators said Thursday
they've isolated a chemical compound contaminating certain batches
of L-tryptophan, the nutritional supplement that sickened perhaps
5,000 Americans and killed 27.
   Investigators still don't know how the contaminant got in the
product. And scientists have yet to determine whether the compound
is itself the cause of the illness or just a ``marker'' of another
substance.
   But data ``indicate that implicated L-tryptophan-containing
products were contaminated'' with the compound, the CDC said. The
compound, called chromatography, was discovered during tests to
break down and analyze the defective product batches, the CDC
reported.
   Nationwide, CDC has received reports of 1,536 cases of a rare
blood disorder called eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, or EMS, which
has been linked to consumption of L-tryptophan, an amino acid.
Twenty-seven patients have died.
   The actual case count may be substantially higher, the CDC said,
noting the presence of a number of cases that don't meet the
agency's initial case definition but still appear to be
L-tryptophan-related EMS.
   ``Maybe our figures might be missing half the cases. I'd say
3,000 to 5,000 is a reasonably good estimate,'' said Dr. Edwin
Kilbourne, chief of health studies at the CDC's Center for
Environmental Health.
   The Food and Drug Administration ordered all L-tryptophan
products off the market after the outbreak began last fall. It was
sold through health food stores as a remedy for conditions
including weight problems, sleeplessness and depression.
   A New England Journal of Medicine report this month concluded
that the Japanese chemical company whose L-tryptophan product has
been linked to most cases had made two changes in manufacturing
that could have caused the problem: the introduction of a new
strain of genetically altered bacteria, and a change in its
filtering process.
   That report spurred biotechnology watchdog Jeremy Rifkin, a
critic of genetic engineering, to pronounce the deaths to be the
first ever caused by gene-splicing.
   ``There's no way to answer'' whether gene-splicing could be to
blame for the compound contaminating the L-tryptophan, said Dr.
Larry Needham, toxicology chief for the CDC's Center for
Environmental Health. ``We don't know how it's produced yet.''
   The compound is known as a di-tryptophan aminal of acetaldehyde.
Needham said it was identified ``in trace amounts'' in
chromatography tests of 50 lots of L-tryptophan produced by the
implicated manufacturer, which has been identified in other reports
as Japan's Showa Denko K.K.
   ``It's an impurity,'' Needham said. ``It's not supposed to be in
the product.''
   Lab investigations found no signs of bacteria or viruses
contaminating the product.
   Federal researchers will now attempt to produce the chemical
compound and test it in laboratory rats, to see if they show EMS
symptoms, Needham said.
   Symptoms of EMS include pains, fever, rash and shortness of
breath.

<HEAD>Jury Says `Cagney &amp; Lacey' Producer Should Get $2 Million in

<TEXT>
   Jurors decided producer Mace Neufeld
should get $2 million-plus in a breach-of-contract suit against
``Cagney &amp; Lacey'' producer Barney Rosenzweig and Orion Pictures
Corp.
   After a 16-day trial, the Superior Court jury on Wednesday
assessed Rosenzweig $1,250,000 and Orion $758,978, and added 7
percent annual interest, which could come to $500,000.
   Superior Court Judge Laurence Rittenband will decide Oct. 9
whether to certify, reduce or overturn the verdict.
   ``In my judgment, there is absolutely no legal basis for either
the judge or the court of appeals to diminish or reverse the jury
award,'' said Neufeld attorney Daniel C. Rosenberg.
   Neither Orion nor Rosenzweig would comment, saying the matter
was still in the courts.
   Neufeld said he had contracts with Orion, then Filmways, and
Rosenzweig entitling him to 50 percent of whatever the studio paid
Rosenzweig during the first five years of ``Cagney &amp; Lacey.'' The
1982-88 CBS police drama starring Sharon Gless and Tyne Daly was a
Rosenzweig Prods.-Mace Neufeld production.
   Rosenzweig made more than $5 million off the series in addition
to the amount included his original contract, Neufeld said, arguing
he was entitled to a corresponding increase.

   Dianne Feinstein and Pete Wilson are
virtually tied in the governor's race, according to a poll that
shows many voters swayed by gender bias and dislike for one
candidate.
   Twenty-two percent of those polled said they'd vote for Democrat
Feinstein because they don't like Wilson. But most, 32 percent,
said they'd vote for Feinstein because she did a good job as San
Francisco mayor.
   Meanwhile, 35 percent of Wilson's supporter's polled said they'd
vote for the U.S. senator because they don't like Feinstein. That
was the No. 1 reason given for favoring Wilson over Feinstein.
   Overall, the statewide California Poll of 894 voters showed
Wilson with a slight edge over Feinstein, 45 percent to 42 percent,
according to results released Wednesday. The telephone poll was
conducted Aug. 17-27 and has a margin of error of 4.5 percentage
points.
   Poll director Mervin Field said the nearly even split is the
result of ``pronounced but offsetting gender biases.'' Women voters
preferred Feinstein 47 percent to 41 percent and men voters favored
her Republican opponent 49 percent to 37 percent.

<TEXT>
   Reservists from the medical profession
have reported to the 597-bed Oak Knoll Naval Hospital, taking
substantial pay cuts as they fill in for regular Navy personnel
sent to the Persian Gulf.
   While on active duty they'll be paid between $1,340 and $2,800 a
month _ well below many private sector medical jobs.
   ``Hopefully, with any luck at all, this will all be over before
you miss your first mortgage payment,'' Capt. Herbert Alexander,
director of surgical services, told the reservists Wednesday during
orientation.
   Dr. Earl Evans, chief of orthopedic surgery at a major San
Francisco Bay area hospital, said he got the telephone call
informing him he was activated at 3:30 a.m. Saturday.
   ``I was expecting it,'' he said. ``I knew things were getting
tough and they'd need our help.''
   Evans, 51, said he will take ``at least a 75 percent cut in
pay'' by operating at Oak Knoll instead of at Kaiser Hospital in
Hayward.
   ``I hope I can keep my kids in college,'' he said. His two sons
attend the University of California, Santa Barbara.
   The Oak Knoll reservists, including nine doctors, 106 nurses,
one dentist and 174 medical technicians, are filling in for the
Navy hospital's medical personnel who are on the hospital ship
Mercy, bound for the Persian Gulf.
   ``It's majorly inconvenient. It's majorly expensive. But the
worst part is the uncertainty. You don't know when you'll be
done,'' said Lt. Comdr. Christine May, a nurse from Oakland. ``But
we signed up for this.''
   Petty Officer Norman Tillman, 36, of Oakland, said he'll
probably need financial help if he is called up for more than 90
days. He and his wife, also a reservist who hasn't been called,
have a 2-year-old and a mortgage.
   ``I'll probably lose about $1,000 a month. I can go for the
short-term, but not the long-term,'' he said.
   But Tillman, a nurse and former Marine, said he was glad to be
called.
   ``You don't do it for the money,'' he said. ``You do it because
you want to serve your country.
   ``Besides, I used to be a Marine and so I get hyped up on things
like this.''

<HEAD>Public Housing Residents Warned to Stop Growing Opium Poppies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opium-producing poppies have popped up in
dozens of yards at public housing complexes, and authorities are
warning residents to remove the plants or face eviction and arrest.
   All of the apartments where the flowers had been growing were
rented by tenants of Southeast Asian descent, who may not have
realized that raising the plants is a crime, said Edie
Pierce-Thomas, who oversees the management of the public housing
projects.
   ``We are talking about many, many families,'' she said. ``The
situation had become rather extensive.''
   Public housing complexes were saturated last week with fliers
ordering tenants to remove the plants. Most have been pulled up,
authorities said.
   St. Paul Public Housing Agency officials said they did not
become aware of the problem until about six weeks ago, when
interpreters employed by the agency reported seeing opium poppies
blooming.
   Police said while they are concerned about the number of tenants
apparently growing the plants, they doubt it was part of a
large-scale opium operation.
   ``I don't think there were enough flowers to support something
like that,'' said Lt. Jim Singer, head of the narcotics unit.
   But Singer said investigators did find a number of plants had
been prepared in such a way as to produce opium.
   There are more than 90 species of poppies but only the opium
poppy, P. somniferum, produces opium, the powerful narcotic that is
the source of heroin, codeine and morphine.
   Before the flowers can produce opium, cuts must be made on the
surface of the unripe seedpods. A milky resin flows from the
lacerations and turns into a brown, gummy material that is then
dried and pulverized to make powdered opium.
   Some Southeast Asian community leaders said Wednesday they heard
of attempts to raise opium poppies, but they doubt the practice is
widespread.
   ``But what they got wasn't good for anything. It wasn't really
opium, not strong like the opium in Laos,'' said Yao Lo, a staff
member at Lao Family Community, Inc.
   Lo said the drug is used in some traditional medicines by some
Southeast Asians.

   President Bush said today that the ``shape of
the post-Cold War world'' is at stake in the Middle East and
announced that he would ask other nations to help pay the
multi-billion-dollar expenses of the Gulf crisis.
   ``We're more than willing to bear our fair share of the burden
... but we also expect others to bear their fair share,'' he said
in an afternoon news conference. He mentioned West Germany, Japan,
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and South Korea
among the nations that would be solicited for contributions.
   Bush said he had approved a plan to seek funds from those
countries to help defray military costs and give assistance to
Middle East nations suffering the most economic hardship from the
Persian Gulf crisis. Administration officials said Jordan, Turkey
and Egypt would be the majpr recipients.
   The cost of the U.S. buildup in Saudi Arabia and in the Gulf
waters is now running at about $1 billion a month, U.S. officials
have said. Bush said his secretary of state and secretary of the
treasury would travel abroad to seek contributions to the effort.
   Reiterating his goals, including the withdrawal of Iraqi troops
from Kuwait and the restoration of the Kuwaiti government and the
security of Saudi Arabia, he said that at stake is the ``shape of
the post-Cold War world.''
   ``Anyone with a stake in international order has an interest in
assuring that all of us succeed,'' he said.
   Bush told reporters he was very concerned about the fate of the
3,000 Americans who have been barred from leaving Iraq and Kuwait,
and added, ``But we cannot permit hostage taking to shape the
foreign policy of this country.'' The State Department was
expressing anger that bureaucratic steps had been imposed by Iraq
on its offer to release women and children.
   Bush was asked about the comments of Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.,
who has said he believes the United States should seek the
overthrow of Iraq's Saddam Hussein. Lugar has said that even if
Kuwaiti rulers are returned to power, Saddam could pose a future
threat because of his large army, his willingness to use chemical
weapons and his efforts to develop the capability to deliver a
nuclear bomb.
   ``It seems to me important that Saddam Hussein must either leave
or be removed,'' Lugar said on Wednesday.
   Bush said he had ``great respect'' for Lugar and that Lugar had
been one among a dozen of members of Congress with whom he had
dined Wednesday night. But he did not endorse the view that Saddam
had to be deposed now, no matter what happens with Kuwait.
   He welcomed efforts to find a negotiated settlement, but despite
the arrival of the U.N. secretary general in Amman, Jordan, he
said, ``I am not too optimistic.''
   Asked if he agreed with some congressmen who said the chances of
fighting were diminishing the longer the crisis lasted, Bush said
it was difficult to predict what Saddam might do.
   ``It's so hard to answer that question because of the
unpredictable nature of Saddam Hussein himself,'' the president
said. ``It's very hard to measure intentions. ... I don't know what
is in this man's mind.''
   Bush said he had raised the very same question himself earlier
today in a meeting with analysts and ``specialists on the Arab
world.''
   Bush said Saddam's meetings with Western ``guests'' _ televised
worldwide _ did not seem to have helped him change world opinion.
   ``I don't think it is cutting in to the desire to see the United
Nations sanctions be fulfilled,'' he said, adding that he
considered Saddam's use of the Western hostages that way
``brutal,'' ``manipulative'' and ``cynical.''
   He defended his decision to return to his Kennebunkport vacation
home, saying he was ``not bothered'' by criticism of it. He said
he'd managed to handle the crisis workload while still getting some
time for relaxation.
   Secretary of State James Baker III and Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady were being set to the Persian Gulf, Europe and Asia
in an effort to explain the international assistance plan drafted
this week in Washington.
   ``I think they'll be very responsive,'' he said when asked about
West Germany.
   Japan today announced a $1 billion commitment and Bush noted
that it didn't take an American envoy for Japanese officials to
make the offer.
   The administration wants to raise about $12 billion in the first
year, to cover the estimated $1 billion per month in additional
military costs the United States is spending to keep its forces in
Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf region, the official said.
   ``Clearly it will have some budget implications,'' Bush said,
adding, ``I don't feel the answer is a war tax'' at home, Bush said.
   On top of that, economic aid will be solicited for countries
hard hit by the international embargo on trading with Iraq and
which are suffering additional hardship from thousands of refugees
fleeing from Iraq and Kuwait.
   ``There's nothing that's painless,'' Bush said in defending the
economic embargo that is designed to deter President Saddam Hussein
but also has hurt the ordinary people of Iraq.
   Japan came up with the extra $1 billion after Bush called Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu on Wednesday, and U.S. officials indicated
they expected more than the package Japan had announced earlier in
the day, the official said.
   Kaifu unveiled Wednesday a package of money, medics and
transportation for the multinational effort against Iraq, but the
only figure he mentioned was $10 million in economic assistance for
refugees in Jordan. He also said Turkey, Egypt and Jordan would get
substantial economic aid.
   Today, a government spokesman said Tokyo would contribute at
least $1 billion on the aid package, apart from that bilateral
economic aid.
   Bush's arm twisting comes as Congress members, while voicing
overwhelming support for Bush's Persian Gulf strategy to date, also
have begun to question why the United States is bearing so much of
the financial and military burden.
   Some have said the other wealthy nations, especially Japan and
West Germany, should share in the costs.
   Since interrupting his Maine vacation for a three-day Washington
trip, Bush has met with Cabinet officers, Treasury officials and
other top aides to work on the plan.
   The National Security Council on Wednesday signed off on the
financial plan to solicit for money. The funds would be in addition
to the military cooperation that so far has seen 22 countries
participating in one way or another with the military aspects of
blockade enforcement and troop deployment aimed at thwarting Saddam.

   A $5.2 million libel damage award to singer
Wayne Newton from NBC was overturned Thursday by a federal appeals
court. It said a broadcast suggesting mob ties in Newton's purchase
of a casino was not shown to be deliberately or recklessly false.
   A jury in Las Vegas found that the television network's October
1980 story about a federal investigation of the singer's recent
acquisition of the Aladdin Hotel and Casino had created a false
impression that criminal organizations had helped in the purchase
in exchange for a hidden share and that Newton had deceived Nevada
gaming officials.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 3-0 ruling, said
most of the factual statements in the broadcast were undisputed,
and that any false impressions had not been shown to be deliberate
or reckless.
   For example, the court said, citing evidence in the case, Newton
had contacted a purported organized crime figure, Guido Penosi,
about a problem; Penosi had arranged a solution, and Penosi and an
associate later discussed the possibility of profiting from
Newton's ownership of the Aladdin, a subject that came under
federal investigation.
   Newton testified that he asked Penosi to stop organized crime
threats against himself and his daughter. That subject was not
mentioned in the NBC story. The court said Newton had testified
falsely to the state Gaming Board about his relationship with
Penosi.
   The court did not say whether the story as a whole was false _
an issue it did not have to reach. Instead, it found a lack of
evidence that the journalists had either deliberately lied or had
been reckless with the truth. That standard must be met by public
figures or public officials suing the news media for libel.
   The court said U.S. District Judge Myron Crocker, who reduced
the jury's $19.3 million libel award to $5.2 million, erroneously
allowed the damages to be based on a conclusion that NBC should
have realized its broadcast would give a false impression.
   What journalists should have realized or foreseen is irrelevant
in a libel suit by a public figure, which must be based on what a
journalist actually knew and intended, said the appellate decision
by Judge William Norris.
   He said Crocker also improperly ``substituted (his) own view as
to the supposed impression left by the broadcast for that of the
journalists who prepared the broadcast.''
   Newton had argued that the story's failure to mention the
threats against him as the reason he had contacted Penosi was a
deliberate omission of the truth. But Norris said the reporters had
reasons to doubt that threats had been made, noting that they had
gotten a denial from Newton's lawyer.
   Norris said the broadcast's statement that Newton had financial
problems at the time of the purchase was true. The broadcast had
some ambiguities about his financial arrangements and testimony,
which might have been cleared up by different wording, but
``editorial decisions about broadcasts are best left to editors,
not to judges and juries,'' Norris said.

   Here is a text of President Bush's news
conference Thursday:
   President Bush: Well I have a brief statement and then I'll be
glad to take some questions. The United States is engaged in a
collective effort involving the overwhelming majority of the member
states of the United Nations to reverse the consequences of Iraqi
aggression. And our goals, enshrined in five Security Council
resolutions, are clear: the immediate and unconditional withdrawal
of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, the restoration of Kuwait's legitimate
government, the stability of Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf, and
the protection of American citizens.
   What is at stake here is truly significant _ the dependability
of America's commitments to its friends and allies, the shape of
the post-postwar world, opposition to aggression, the potential
domination of the energy resources that are crucial to the entire
world.
   This effort has been truly international from the very outset.
Many other countries are contributing. At last count, 22 countries
have either responded to a request from Saudi Arabia to help deter
further aggression, or are contributing maritime forces pursuant to
United Nations Security Council Resolution 665.
   And still others are providing other forms of financial and
material support to these defense efforts or to countries whose
economies are affected adversely by sanctions or by higher oil
prices. And still others are paying a heavy economic price at home
for complying with the United Nations sanctions.
   It is important that the considerable burden of the effort be
shared by those being defended and those who benefit from the free
flow of oil. Indeed, anyone with a stake in international order has
an interest in ensuring that all of us succeed.
   The United States has large interests in the balance and has
undertaken commitments commensurate with them, and we're more than
willing to bear our fair share of the burden. This includes above
all the thousands of men and women in our armed forces who are now
in the Gulf, but we also expect others to bear their fair share.
   A number of countries already have announced their willingness
to help those adversely affected economically by this endeavor. And
it's essential, though, that this be a concerted and coordinated
one and that all affected countries participate.
   It is important to get the priorities right and make sure that
those most deserving of assistance receive it and that those most
able to contribute do so. And for that reason, I directed an
interagency effort to develop a strategy to accomplish this
objective. The group's report was presented at yesterday's National
Security Council meeting here, and this morning I approved an
action plan.
   And our approach calls for substantial economic assistance to
those states _ in particular, I'd single out Turkey and Egypt, who
are bearing a great part of the burden of sanctions and higher oil
prices. The plan also targets additional countries, including
Jordan, the countries of Eastern Europe and others for special
assistance.
   The United States will also seek burdensharing for part of our
own effort. At the same time, we will be asking other governments,
including Japan, the Republic of Korea, Federal Republic of
Germany, Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, free Kuwait, and others to
join us in making available financial and, where appropriate,
energy resources to countries that have been most affected by the
current situation.
   To facilitate this undertaking, I've asked Secretary of State
Jim Baker and the Secretary of the Treasury Nick Brady to lead
high-level delegations to the Persian Gulf, Europe and Asia. And
I'll be getting directly in touch with the leaders of these
countries before Secretaries Baker and Brady arrive to set forth,
spell out our general objectives.
   Let me close by repeating what I said the other day in meeting
with the congressional leaders. The basic pieces of our policy are
in place. The Iraqi regime stands in opposition to the entire world
and to the interests of the Iraqi people. It is truly Iraq against
the world. But I want to make this point clear, we have no argument
with the people of Iraq.
   The sanctions are beginning to take hold. And in the meantime,
we want to ensure that countries contributing to this unprecedented
collective response do not suffer for doing so. And what I've
announced today and what I expect will be implemented in the coming
days should help create a context in which sanctions against Iraq
can be sustained with the intended effect.
   Another area where there has been unprecedented international
solidarity is OPEC's willingness to take up the slack in oil
production created by the embargo on Iraqi and Kuwait's oil. In
this connection, I met this morning with our energy advisers who
are watching the oil production situation very, very closely. And
we are pleased with OPEC's decision to help take up the slack in
crude oil production. And although we are in what I would see as a
transition period, the situation appears manageable.
   At the present time, we don't anticipate major imbalances in the
oil market. But we do have the Strategic Petroleum Reserve tested
and available if it is truly needed. And our energy policy is
resulting in increased oil production and fuel switching to natural
gas and to other fuels.
   I also repeat my previous request for Americans to conserve and
for all parties to act responsibly. Right now, the situation, I
would say, is relative stable, and I am very pleased by the
coordination that has taken place with so many countries in
maintaining adequate fuel levels.

<HEAD>S&amp;L Prosecutions Hobbled Without Deficit Reduction Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

   Savings and loan prosecutions would be hobbled
by spending cuts that would take effect if Congress and the White
House don't agree on ways to reduce the deficit, the Justice
Department said Thursday.
   The Dallas S&amp;L Task Force, which has obtained more than 50
convictions since 1987, would be virtually shut down as a result of
a 32.4 percent spending cut that would take effect when the new
fiscal year begins Oct. 1, the department said.
   New investigations of S&amp;L fraud nationwide would be postponed
because of furloughs of Justice Department prosecutors that would
be required, the department said.
   ``The criminal division would be unable to carry out its mandate
in resolving the savings and loan crisis,'' Deputy Attorney General
William P. Barr said in a letter released by the department.
   The spending cuts would take effect if Congress and President
Bush don't reach agreements on alternative ways to cut spending, or
raise taxes.
   Barr's letter to Budget Director Richard Darman outlined a
number of ways in which the mandatory spending cut would hurt the
Justice Department, which this week began sending furlough notices
to virtually all its 80,000 employees.
   The letter appeared calculated to pressure Congress into ending
the budget stalemate with the Bush administration.
   Budget talks that began in May have produced no breakthroughs
and are in recess during Congress' August break. Bargainers have
been looking for $50 billion in new taxes and spending cuts for
fiscal 1991, and $500 billion over five years.
   Negotiations are resuming Sept. 7 with sessions at Andrews Air
Force Base in Maryland, just outside the capital, in hopes that a
secluded location will expedite a deal.
   The Justice Department says the FBI, in addition to furloughs of
agents for 22 days in the coming fiscal year, is planning to lay
off 6,160 employees to save $308 million.
   ``For the FBI, the 1991 sequester would significantly reduce the
bureau's ability to thwart terrorist activity that may result from
the current Iraqi crisis,'' Barr wrote.
   As for the S&amp;L cases, ``the president's financial institution
fraud initiative would be severely hampered, curtailing current
investigations and prohibiting the initiation of new
investigations,'' Barr said.
   Bush asked Congress to spend another $25 million to expand
prosecution after criticism that his administration was dragging
its feet on the investigation of thrift fraud.
   The sequester would eliminate ``rapid response teams'' that
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh announced would be set up to
quickly investigate allegations of S&amp;L fraud before large sums of
depositors' money is lost, Barr said.
   Employee furloughs could last from 22 days to more than 100
days, depending on the division or component of the agency, Barr
said. Furloughs are expected to last up to 105 days for 3,800
prosecutors in the nation's 94 U.S. attorneys offices.
   The department's civil division would have to furlough its
employees as long as 86 days and ``shut down litigation in hundrds
of cases'' including many arising from the S&amp;L crisis, Barr said.
   ``The cost to the Treasury of the loss of this caseload will
result in expenditures or lost revenues that could go as high as
$108 billion,'' Barr said.
   The government would have to forgo the chance to collect
``billions of dollars'' by furloughing tax attorneys up to 77 days.
   The Drug Enforcement Administration would lose a third of its
3,000 agents to furloughs, resulting in a ``drastic reduction''
efforts to stop cocaine production in South America, Barr said.

<HEAD>Outlawed Armenian Paramilitary Group Gives Up; Parliament Shows
Authority</HEAD>

   About 250 militant Armenian nationalists gave up
their weapons Thursday after the republic declared a state of
emergency and surrounded their headquarters with soldiers, police
and tanks.
   The surrender was a major victory for Armenia's parliament,
which declared independence from the Soviet Union last week. By
reining in the militants with forces under its direct control _ no
troops from the central Soviet government were involved _ the
parliament dramatically emphasized its authority.
   Lawmakers had voted unanimously Wednesday to outlaw the militant
group, which called itself the Armenian National Army. The vote
followed a night of violence in which militants attacked a gas
station, killed a legislator and fired automatic rifles at a rival
organization's headquarters.
   The militants, holed up in three buildings in the republic's
capital of Yerevan, at first ignored an ultimatum from the
parliament to surrender by 10 p.m. Wednesday or face a military
showdown, Armenian officials said.
   After several hours of fruitless negotiations between
parliamentary representatives and Armenian National Army leaders,
about 500 government soldiers and police moved into the buildings
at about 1:30 a.m. Thursday. They met no resistance, Soviet media
reported.
   Later, two leaders of the paramilitary group appealed on
television for the remaining members to turn themselves in
peacefully.
   They did not explain their reasons for surrendering, but
Armenian government loyalists said the militants had been convinced
that they faced overwhelming force and that resistance would
endanger innocent lives.
   The state of emergency and a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew remained
in effect throughout the republic, but no fighting was reported.
   ``This was the quietest night in the republic in the past six
months,'' Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan told the
230-member parliament Thursday. ``The people have seen that the
republic has a real government and that this government works.''
   Among the weapons surrendered by the militants were
approximately 60 rifles and shotguns, a few hundred rounds of
ammunition, several hand grenades and 1,540 pounds of explosives,
said Ovanes Muradyan, a spokesman for the Armenian National
Movement, a group loyal to the republic's government.
   Muradyan, speaking by telephone from Yerevan, said government
forces believe that some ANA members managed to sneak out of the
buildings during the night with automatic rifles.
   He said some members of the group turned themselves in after the
television appeal by leaders Razmik Vasilyan and Vardan Vardanyan,
but the number still holding out ``is very difficult to determine,
because the ANA was a guerrilla kind of organization and never had
any constant places of deployment, except the headquarters.''
   The group is believed to have comprised a few hundred hard-core
fighters and many more sympathizers. It claimed to serve as a
voluntary militia protecting Armenians from attacks by militants in
the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan. But it occasionally
attacked Armenian government targets, such as fuel depots and
police stations, to steal weapons and gasoline.
   Longstanding ethnic tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan
flared two years ago into fighting for jurisdiction over
Nagorno-Karabakh, a region within Azerbaijan that is populated
mainly by Armenians. More than 300 people have been killed in the
dispute.
   Armenian authorities said all but a handful of the members of
the Armenian National Army who surrendered were released and will
not be prosecuted. Parliament had promised an amnesty to militants
who turned in their weapons.
   Raffi Hovannisian, a representative of the Washington-based
Armenian Assembly of America, said in a telephone interview from
Yerevan that the militants surrendered partly in the interest of
Armenian solidarity.
   ``There was an immense amount of negotiation, and I think they
were persuaded that all military forces should be under the
government's control,'' Hovannisian said.
   ``They also realized they were facing superior forces, and that
if it came to a fight, innocent blood might be spilled,'' he added.

   Ask Red Thompson what he likes about
Alachua County and he says, ``It's got quietness.'' Others in this
place of pines and live oaks say the same.
   But the quiet has been shattered by seven slayings _ two in this
rural bedroom community and five in shaken Gainesville 20 miles
away _ all in less than a week.
   That's as many homicides as in six months last year.
   Authorities don't believe the Melrose killings, discovered
Wednesday, are related to the student slayings in Gainesville, home
of the University of Florida. And yet they came at a time when
tensions were already high.
   Alachua County is eager to get back to its normal self, a place
where people come to study, to raise cattle or perhaps to be healed
at famous hospitals. It will get quiet again, residents say.
   ``It's a great place to live,'' says Liz Kubisek, a resident
since 1972. ``I wouldn't let this change my mind.''
   She keeps statistics for the county sheriff's department and
said there were nine homicides last year outside the Gainesville
city limits.
   That's added to five last year in the city, said Patrick
Callahan of the Gainesville police, who added that the mutilations
involved in some of the recent killings added to their impact.
   ``It's not so much the numbers as the intensity that's freaking
people out,'' he said.
   Thompson, who sells real estate from an office in Melrose,
agreed.
   ``All of this is coming on so fast it's kind of overwhelming
us,'' he said.
   ``Last night, I have to say, was the first time in months I
locked my doors.''
   For many, life normally revolves around fishing in the scores of
lakes hereabouts. Those who don't farm, mostly commute to jobs in
Gainesville. En route, they might pass a sign that offers ``Horse
for Sale,'' or ``Blueberries.''
   ``It's a hard-working county, it's a peaceful county,'' Thompson
said.
   The concentration of educational institutions in Alachua County
gives its population the youngest median age in Florida, according
to County Manager Bob Fernandez.
   Tragically, that uniqueness may have been a factor in the first
five killings. The victims were all students, three at the
University of Florida and the two at nearby Santa Fe Community
College.
   In the midst of budget meetings, Fernandez said the killings
have put everyday activities in a new perspective.
   ``We don't spend a lot of time now haggling over the price of a
dump truck,'' he said.
   It goes without saying, he added, that people in the county look
forward to getting back to normal.
   For local government, that means, among other things, continuing
to work toward a more diversified economy, one less dependent on
the university.
   Nationwide Insurance Co. has a regional office in the county and
some well-known hospitals, including Shands Medical Center, make
the area ``a health magnet,'' Fernandez said. But more employers
are always being sought.
   For much of the county, getting back to normal will mean keeping
up with the Florida Gators football team.
   The county fair is coming up in November, and 4-H'ers will get
their livestock ready.
   And some people will just want to get out to Paynes Prairie, an
18,000-acre state wildlife sanctuary south of Gainesville. They'll
be listening for the quiet.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: fuel levels.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   And now, I would be glad to take some questions. Who's first?
Terry?
   Q: Mr. President, Saddam Hussein has rejected demands that he
pull his troops out of Kuwait, and he's holding several thousand
foreigners hostage to keep the world at bay. You say you don't see
much chance for diplomacy to work. How long can the West allow this
impasse to go on, and would you take any action that might endanger
the lives of those hostages?
   A: It will go on as long as it takes to have these United
Nations sanctions fully implemented, and I am glad that these
diplomatic efforts are taking place. Perhaps one will hit pay dirt.
But as of now, I must say, I'm not optimistic, because the man
keeps reiterating terms that are simply _ fly in the face of the
United Nations action.
   And on the second question, look, I feel very concerned about
Americans that are held against their will, but we cannot permit
hostage-taking to shape the foreign policy of this country, and I
won't permit it to do that.
   Q: So does that mean that their lives would be expendable if you
judge the. ...
   A: It's too _ too hypothetical a question. It means I will not
change the policy of the United States and I don't think other
leaders whose foreign nationals are in this same predicament will
change their policies to pay _ to pay _ pay homage or to give
credibility to this brutal move of staking out citizens and not _
and a brutal move of holding people against their will.
   Q: Mr. President, there are reports that there's a split in your
administration: some who want to expand the goals to include the
ouster, eventual ouster of Saddam, and also there are many, many
suggestions for a Middle East conference that would include in the,
in what you would call the post-postwar shape of the world, the
perennial problems of the Middle East. What do you think on both of
those?
   A: What I think on the second part of the question, that we
ought to get on with the business at hand, the shorter-run
business, which is the solution to this question, or the making
right the situation in Kuwait, meaning the pulling out of forces,
obviously, and the restoration of the rulers. I do _ as I look at
the countries that are chipping in here now, I think we do have a
chance at a new world order. And I'd like to think that out of this
dreary performance by Saddam Hussein there could be now an
opportunity for peace all through the Middle East.
   But it's _ it's _ we have to get, we have to be sure that what's
been undertaken so far is successful before we can _ we can move to
that other agenda, it seems to me.
   Q: Well would you support, then, a conference afterwards? I
mean, this may be premature, but the question is, are you shooting
for that?
   A: I haven't _ that's not an objective _ a conference. Peace
through the Middle East is an objective. And as you know, we have
never ruled out a conference of any nature. In fact, it was part
of, an active part of our diplomacy just several years ago. But I
don't want to get out ahead of the _ where we are right now on
this. The question right now is what do we do to get Saddam Hussein
to comply with international law. I left out _ you had another part
of it.
   Q: Are you _ do you want to get him out of his job? Do you want
to get him out of. ...
   A: Well it didn't _ wouldn't disappoint me if the Iraqis got up
and said, ``Look, this man is our problem.'' I've said right here
the problem is not with the people in Iraq, simply isn't. And _ but
I _ I've spelled out our objectives here, and I _ I would _ I
stopped short of adding to them what, you know, the answer that you
were seeking from me on the president.
   Q: Mr. President, some have expressed the fear that Saddam
Hussein might seek to inflame the Arab world against the United
States by drawing Israel into the conflict here, perhaps by a
strike against Jordan. Can you tell us if you're prepared for such
a contingency, and if so, how?
   A: Well that's, again, hypothetical. I can't predict what he's
going to do. But I can tell you that we are _ we are continuing to
implement our forces, and we are continuing to take all the
diplomatic moves that are necessary to prepare for any eventuality.
   Q: Well, let me just follow up by asking a question about
Jordan's participation in the U.N. sanctions. There are numerous
reports coming out of the East, some quoting Israeli intelligence,
to the effect that Jordan is a highway, really, for supplies still
reaching Iraq. Are you aware of those reports? And what. ...
   A: I'm aware of some. But, Brit, it is my view that _ that _
based on what I've seen most recently, that commerce has come down
to a bit of a trickle there. There were reports of enormous numbers
of trucks being _ being laid up _ no goods to transport.
   So I don't know how effective it is right now. I do know that
King Hussein told me, looking me right in the eye, that they were
going to comply with the sanctions. But I've seen reports that
indicate there's some leakage there. But I just can't give you the
quantity. I just don't know.
   It's my feeling that commerce through the Aqaba, the port of
Aqaba, and indeed through Jordan going to Iraq and vice-versa has
slowed down. Regrettably, there's a lot of refugee traffic. And I
think that's hurting the Saddam Hussein image, because people see
the humblest being brutalized the most. And they see a lot of
refugees out there, and I think that's sending a _ not a very good
signal as far as he's concerned.

   Former hostage Brian Keenan on Thursday
urged negotiations for the release of remaining captives in
Lebanon, with whom he formed an ``enduring and unbreakable bond''
during years in tiny basement cells.
   Keenan, a teacher released last week after being held 4{ years,
said he often spent weeks in dark chambers, suffered repeated
beatings and rarely spoke above a whisper.
   ``It's time to talk. It's obviously time to talk. There is a
willingness. Why not talk?'' Keenan said during a 75-minute news
conference.
   Keenan, 39, said he saw two of the six remaining American
hostages, Associated Press journalist Terry Anderson and university
professor Thomas Sutherland, about 11 months ago. At the time, both
were well, he said.
   Extremist groups believed linked to Iran still hold 13 Western
hostages _ the six Americans, four Britons, two West Germans and an
Italian.
   Keenan, a native of Belfast, Northern Ireland, who holds dual
Irish-British citizenship, was handed over to Irish authorities in
Syria on Saturday. He was released from Mater hospital in Dublin on
Thursday.
   He was teaching English in Beirut at the time of his capture on
April 11, 1986.
   Appearing pale and thin, Keenan periodically gulped back tears
while describing his captivity.
   ```Hostage' is crucifying aloneness. There's a silent screaming
slide into the bowels of ultimate despair,'' Keenan said, reading
from a handwritten statement.
   ```Hostage' is a man hanging by his fingernails over the edge of
chaos and feeling his fingers slowly straightening.''
   ``Tiny, tiny cells, constant blindfolds, prolonged days in the
dark, sometimes weeks without light, create kinds of insanity that
drive men deep, deep into themselves,'' he said.
   Keenan described 42-year-old Anderson, the AP's chief Middle
East correspondent, as pacing the floor in tattered socks with a
``voracious appetite for intellectual conversation.''
   He said Anderson sometimes kept him awake for hours with
conversation.
   ``I think he debated with himself a lot while we tried to plug
our ears,'' Keenan joked.
   Keenan said guards sometimes gave Anderson antibiotics during
bouts of stomach trouble.
   ``Terry and myself would sit through those long nights and speak
with great pain and remorse and longing for his first daughter,
Gabrielle. With many tears he would elaborate his plans when he was
finally back in the states to help her to shape and discover her
future.
   ``In those confessional moments which were common to us all, a
deep and enduring and unbreakable bond was formed.''
   Anderson has never seen his second daughter, Sulome, born three
months after he was abducted.
   Anderson, abducted March 16, 1985, is the longest-held of the 13
Westerners. Sutherland was kidnapped June 9, 1985.
   Keenan said Sutherland, 59, who was dean of agriculture at the
American University of Beirut at the time of his kidnapping, taught
him French using ``broken matchsticks, cigarette papers and an
ancient French historical novel which I never want to read again.''
   Keenan said he and a British hostage, television journalist John
McCarthy, were held with the two Americans and a now-freed U.S.
hostage, Frank Reed, for eight months.
   Keenan, a bachelor, wore a T-shirt designed by a group called
the Friends John McCarthy. Keenan said he spent the most time with
McCarthy and that the two became quite close.
   Keenan's voice broke as he speculated how McCarthy, who was
kidnapped April 17, 1986, must be feeling now.
   ``Other people one begins to look at with strange mistrustful
apprehension, but the irrepressible wit that is the golden kernel
of John coped ultimately and always emerged,'' he said.
   Keenan had no news of Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite, who
disappeared in Jan. 20, 1987, while on a mission to Beirut to
negotiate the release of hostages.
   But he noted he may have recently heard another hostage.
   ``I felt in the last place we were in there was certainly
another hostage whom I heard in the early hours of the morning
saying `Oh no, oh no.' That could be French, that could be
anything,'' said Keenan.
   Keenan said his captors were mainly aged about 30, poorly
educated and that some beat the captives until the last nine
months, when the food and general treatment significantly improved.
   He said some guards refused to take part in the beatings and
one, as a gesture of remorse, brought him an apple.
   ``I feel no desire for vengeance,'' Keenan said. ``I don't
intend maiming myself by going into a rage of anger. I see no
purpose in it.
   ``Some of those men who held us and who could speak English were
reasonable ... They did talk of their faith, they did talk of
Islam, they gave us a Koran which we had for a year with no other
reading material. It was not an attempt to convert us,'' Keenan
said.
   Keenan said the captors asked if some of the hostages would like
to convert to Islam.
   ``We simply held up chains and said, `No chance, pal.'''

<TEXT>
   The Aquarium of the Americas opens Saturday
on the edge of the city's historic French Quarter, hailed by its
director as the nation's premier aquarium.
   Built with donations and a special property tax, the aquarium
was fought by landowners who think it will ruin the area's historic
qualities and bring in traffic and noise. But their lawsuit failed,
and the $40 million aquarium stands ready for a projected 870,000
visitors the first year.
   ``Each aquarium grows and learns from the last experience that
you've had at an aquarium,'' says L. Ron Forman, executive director
of the Audubon Institute, a non-profit group that runs the Audubon
Zoo and the aquarium.
   ``This has taken all of the technologies of the National
Aquarium in Baltimore and the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California
and brought them to New Orleans.''
   The million-gallon, 110,000-square-foot aquarium sits on the
Mississippi River. Sixty fresh and salt water displays ranging from
500 to 500,000 gallons house more than 7,500 specimens from 395
species of marine life.
   The displays will be geared around four major exhibits: A
Caribbean Reef Environment; an Amazon Rainforest; a Mississippi
River and Delta habitat; and a Gulf of Mexico exhibit.
   The project was financed by $25 million in public bonds backed
by a special property tax approved by city voters in 1986, and by
$15 million in donations.
   Despite more than 70 percent approval of the aquarium tax, there
were some who worked to stop the project.
   A group of French Quarter landowners sued, accusing the Army
Corps of Engineers of approving the project in violation of the
National Historic Preservation Act.
   A federal appeals court ruled against the group last year. In
January, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear arguments in the
suit, which was backed by the National Trust for Historic
Preservation in the United States, a private organization chartered
by Congress.
   Claims that the aquarium, which is adjacent to the ultramodern
Canal Place hotel and shopping arcade complex, will take away from
the Quarter's bawdy, centuries-old appeal, are unfounded, Forman
says. Traffic congestion, noise and parking problems predicted for
the 1984 World's Fair two blocks upriver never materialized.
   The aquarium's initial operating budget will be about $10
million annually, and no city money will be needed for operations
after it opens, Forman says. Admission is $7.50 for adults, $4 for
children.
   City officials are counting on the aquarium and the adjacent
17-acre Woldenberg Riverfront Park, which provides much needed
green space for residents of the city's French Quarter, to help
attract more family tourists.
   ``New Orleans has basically had the flavor that it's an adult
town,'' said aquarium spokesman Eileen Lumar-Johnson.
   ``We think that we will draw more tourists because we will in
fact have some impact on the city's image as a family attraction.''

   Police clashed for a second
day Thursday with students protesting black factional fighting, and
the government said the conflict was forcing it to spend money on
security instead of social services.
   Witnesses in Cape Town said students hurled stones at police,
who fired birdshot in return and injured at least two protesters.
The students were demanding an end to battles between Xhosas, who
mostly support the African National Congress, and Zulus, who back
the conservative Inkatha movement.
   Officials of the Transkei homeland, where many Xhosas are from,
complained Thursday that South African authorities had left bodies
of victims of the fighting to rot outside Johannesburg area
mortuaries.
   They said people who traveled to the city to identify the dead
were unable to recognize their relatives because the bodies had
decomposed.
   ``One is bound to ask why are the corpses of the people who died
in such a violent manner further desecrated in this way,'' the
Transkei statement said. ``Is it because they are black?''
   Inkatha and the ANC both oppose apartheid but differ on the
shape of a future South Africa. Inkatha has accused the ANC of
terrorizing other black groups in a bid to consolidate power.
   Zulu and Xhosa tribal leaders met Thursday and agreed to make a
joint plea for an end to the fighting. At least 500 people have
died since the factional fighting broke out on Aug. 12 in the
townships around Johannesburg.
   Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha said he has told ANC deputy
president Nelson Mandela the black factional fighting sends a
message of instability to the rest of the world and will leave
foreigners reluctant to invest in South Africa if international
sanctions are lifted. The sanctions were imposed to protest South
Africa's system of racial discrimination.
   ``I warned him that we are all doomed if we cannot create jobs
or provide houses for his followers,'' Botha said at a congress of
the governing National Party. ``If we don't get our act together,
we'll have nothing to govern.''
   Finance Minister Barend Du Plessis, meanwhile, said violence
forced the government to spend money on security instead of social
problems.
   ``Those stoking unrest must also decide whether they want money
for education or if we must spend it on the police and military
personnel who have to try and sort out the trouble,'' he said.
   Mandela is under pressure from the government and other black
leaders to meet with Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi. The ANC has
rejected talks with Buthelezi, contending he serves as a government
pawn to divide the black majority.
   Mandela was expected to return to South Africa on Friday after a
seven-day trip to Norway, Algeria and Libya. But the ANC announced
Thursday he will also stop in Zambia to meet with ANC exiles,
delaying his return until Sept. 3.
   Also Thursday, police arrested a Conservative Party city
councilor, Greyling Bezuidenhout, on unspecified charges.
   The independent South African Press Association reported that
Bezuidenhout, an official of the Kempton Park municipality
northeast of Johannesburg, was among 11 right-wing whites arrested
June 21 in connection with an alleged plot to assassinate Mandela.
The 11 whites were released a few days after their arrests. No
charges were filed.
   Right-wing whites oppose the white-led government's reforms to
dismantle apartheid and its talks with the ANC on sharing power
with the black majority.
   In other developments Thursday:
   _The government said residents of black and mixed-race townships
who refuse to pay rent will lose their electricity, trash removal,
and some water services.
   In one township, perishable food rotted and residents collected
water from a nearby stream after services were cut this week.
Police fired tear gas to disperse angry residents in another
township who complained their utility bills were incorrect.
   Planning and Provincial Affairs Minister Hernus Kriel told a
news conference rent boycotts to protest conditions in the
segregated settlements left local authorities with budget deficits.
   Electricity would be cut first, he said, followed by refuse
removal. ``We do not intend to cut off electricity in sensitve
areas where essential services will be affected, like hospitals,''
Kriel said.
   ``We also do not want to jeopardize the health of the community
by cutting off the water totally, but we will reduce the flow of
water or install services where members of the community can only
use water at certain times of day,'' he said.
   _The independent South African Press Association reported
negotiators were finishing a draft agreement to end a 5-year-old
rent boycott in Soweto, the black township of 2 million people near
Johannesburg.

May I ask how bothered you may have been by the opinion of many
Americans, many of whom think you're doing a great job in this
crisis, who nonetheless are bothered by you going out and fishing
and golfing while in command of the troops in the Gulf?
   A: No, I'm not bothered by it. I've expressed myself on that. If
I were bothered I wouldn't be going back there for the Labor Day
weekend with my family. And I think the American people are
supporting strongly what I'm doing. So I _ and I would repeat, I'm
in very close touch. I've done a lot of the diplomatic work that
has gone into this project from my house there, received a couple
of foreign visitors there, have had many briefings there, and I
think the American people are fundamentally fair and I think they
see that. So it _ I'm not troubled by it. If I were, I suspect I
wouldn't be going back again.
   Q: Marlin Fitzwater at one point said that you were pretty
adamant and stubborn about it, thinking _ saying to him at one
point that you needed a rest. Is that what it boiled down to?
   Fitzwater: I beg your pardon!
   A: Yeah, I need some rest. And I haven't gotten as much as I'd
like. But I wouldn't call it ``adamant'' or ``stubborn'' because I
refuse to _ he better not have either. Marlin's going through kind
of a downer, though, because the Iraqi spokesman has the matching
tie and hankie, you know, so _ it's been a little difficult. ...
Charles?
   Q: On the question of your needing rest.
   A: Huh?
   Q: You were about to answer the question.
   A: No, I think I do. I'm getting some, not as much as I'd like.
But it's been very pleasant there, and yet I've managed to
accomplish my objectives in terms of work, too.
   Q: Mr. President, on the question of burdensharing, since you're
sending your envoys out, it sounds like you have not gotten the
voluntary contributions you might have liked to have gotten. Can
you give us a sense of how much you're looking for, and where you
expect to find it?
   A: No, I don't think it's a question of doing this because we
haven't gotten what we think is fair for other countries and for
the _ and for burdensharing generally. What we're talking about
here, Charles, is a consulting and coordinating effort, and we've
had strong indications of support. But now we are moving up a
little bit and trying to take the lead here, leadership in helping
sort out who should help whom. And somebody has to do that, and
we've made a significant commitment in various ways, and so it
seemed appropriate that we take the lead in working with our
friends and allies.
   But, look, Prime Minister Kaifu called me last night _ you know,
we didn't need a mission for this _ and made a significant
contribution, and then pledged to do more in terms of support for
other countries. Now that is very good, and that was voluntary. But
it needs to be coordinated. Somebody needs to take the lead on
saying, ``Look, we don't put all the money to this one country.
Several countries are involved here, and let's see that these
generous responses are fairly allocated.''
   Q: If I could follow up, there have been concerns expressed
about the Japanese not making any military contribution. They could
send minesweepers or something like that. Is money not enough in
the Japanese case? And what has happened to the _ your good friend
Helmut Kohl, who seemed extraordinarily silent?
   A: Well, I don't _ I wouldn't say money is not enough. I'm fully
aware of the constraints on the Japanese, and I have not pressed
him to go beyond what his constitution provides. Helmut Kohl _ I
think they'll be very responsive, and part of _ part of what we're
talking about here is to follow up on comments like the ones Helmut
Kohl made to me about ``we want to be a part of this, we want to
help.'' So I have no argument with the Germans at all. Yes?
   Q: Is the United States doing anything to help the Kuwaiti
underground, the Kuwaiti rebels? Training, supplies, anything?
   A: One, I wouldn't comment on it; two _ but in a broad way _ I
support the Kuwaiti underground. I support anybody that can have a
hand in restoring legitimacy there to Kuwait, and to getting the
Iraqis out of Kuwait.
   Q: All right, but how do you justify it legally under the U.N.
resolutions which don't seem to call for any support activity to
the underground. ...
   A: Well, I'm just encouraging people who are patriots and feel
that their country has been pillaged and aggressed against.
   Q: Well, would you draw the line at sending the Green Berets or
some sort of American military force on cross-border raids, and if
you. ...
   A: Just too hypothetical. I've given you the principle. If there
were some _ some quiet support, which I wouldn't ever confirm or
deny because we never comment on those matters, I would simply
leave it out there, because _ but you say, am I supportive of _ I
think what you said was resistance. And I'd be supportive of
anybody that wants to try to fulfill the ambitions of the _ the
statements that the world has made through the United Nations.
   Q: But you didn't rule out cross-border raids by American
military personnel either?
   A: Well, I'm not _ if they were going to happen _ let me be
clear on this. If it were going to happen, I wouldn't comment on
it. That would be the dumbest thing I could possibly do, in my
view, to tip your hat. But I have no plans for that right now. Yeah?

   President Bush said Thursday that his request
for other nations to share in the cost of the U.S. military
presence in the Middle East does not put American forces in the
role of mercenaries.
   ``I wouldn't have them look like mercenaries,'' Bush said at a
news conference. ``There are ways that burden-sharing can be
accomplished without making forces mercenary.''
   A mercenary is a professional soldier hired to serve in a
foreign army. It was common in the past for states to recruit
entire forces from another state to fight its battles.
   Bush said fuel and transportation were areas where other
countries could contribute to the cost of maintaining U.S. forces
in the Middle East.
   Bush said members of Congress had expressed concern about U.S.
soldiers being regarded as mercenaries under a burden-sharing plan.
   ``U.S. forces should never appear to be mercenary forces,'' he
said.
   Modern mercenaries often find work in the civil and territorial
wars of the Third World.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Marines have established a
camp a relatively short distance from the Saudi troops manning the
front lines in the standoff with Iraq, military sources said
Thursday.
   The camp represents the forward-most movement of U.S. ground
forces in Saudi Arabia. The movement, made over the past few days,
was described by the sources as routine and not a sign of any
imminent hostilities.
   ``You don't keep Marines behind everybody else, that's not what
we have the Marines for,'' said one of the sources, who spoke on
the condition of anonymity.
   This source discussed the forward movement of the Marines into
northeast Saudi Arabia on the condition the exact location not be
disclosed.
   The second source, when asked about the reported movement,
confirmed some Marines had moved north into the desert from a
staging area more than 150 miles from the border they had used for
initial desert exercises and to grow acclimated to the Saudi
climate.
   A Navy spokesman, Capt. Mike Sherman, said he could not discuss
troop deployments. The military planned to take reporters to a
Marine camp in northeast Saudi Arabia on Friday; Sherman said he
did not know the exact location.
   The first source stressed the Marines still were behind the
Saudi forces stationed near the kingdom's border with occupied
Kuwait.
   The move was not directly related to the recent additions of
Iraqi forces along its border with Saudi Arabia, the source said.
   ``But obviously as we get more people in country we are going to
spread them around, and it makes sense to move them toward the
border than away from it,'' the source said.

<TEXT>
   Hostage Thomas Sutherland is a dapper
``Mr. Chips'' who has exercised rigorously and dreamed of his aging
Volvo during 5{ years in captivity in Lebanon, former hostage Brian
Keenan said Thursday.
   Sutherland, a Scottish-born American, was acting dean of
agriculture at the American University of Beirut when he was
abducted June 9, 1985. He was known to his fellow captives as ``the
dean,'' Keenan said.
   ``For many hours we would sit with him while he delivered
fascinating lectures on genetics and animal husbandry,'' Keenan
told reporters Thursday. ``He came to us in these awful places as
kind of light, illuminating our darkness, warming that chill, that
despair.''
   Keenan remembered Sutherland, 59, as ``courteous in manner, and
very, very great in heart ... certainly a ... veritable Mr.
Chips,'' referring to the English schoolmaster of James Hilton's
novel, ``Goodbye, Mr. Chips.''
   ``Of all of us, perhaps, that man was the least prepared by life
for the horror he now endures,'' said Keenan.
   ``Though given to long periods of crushing depression, he gave
selflessly of his knowledge to us all,'' he said.
   Keenan said Sutherland talked frequently of the Volvo he bought
new 27 years ago.
   ``We each of us knew that Volvo extremely well,'' Keenan said.
   ``The dean still clings with a stubborn tenacity that he might
even yet return and complete his work at the American University of
Beirut. Sutherland was on leave from the faculty of Colorado State
University and had worked in Beirut for two years.
   ``I watched his eyes light in dazzling enthusiasm as he took
several hours a day to teach me French with a consortium of broken
matchsticks, cigarette papers and an ancient French historical
novel which I never want to read again in my life,'' Keenan said.
   ``Tom, like most of us, maintained his little vanities. He keeps
running, he keeps exercising and trying to keep his slim good looks.
   ``Such things are absurd, perhaps, when you haven't seen a
mirror for 5{ years in Tom's case, yet they are those life-giving,
harmless idiosyncracies which keep a man from sliding and giving
way.
   ``Anyway,'' Keenan said, ``he is a handsome old devil.''

   Gov. Roy Romer defended his staff's decision not
to send a letter of commendation to two New Jersey teen-agers who
earned Eagle Scout medals, in a flap that saw a talk radio host
chide the governor.
   ``I don't think it's the job of the governor of Colorado to give
commendations to every Eagle Scout in the country,'' Romer said in
a call Wednesday to a talk show on radio station KOA, which had
criticized him for his failure to laud the teens.
   The governor complained about KOA's treatment of the issue and
``the whole role of talk radio.'' Talk show host George Weber
replied, ``Take a sedative, governor.''
   The parents of Douglas Baker, 14, and Derek Kahill, 17, both of
Oradell, N.J., sent letters to 50 governors, asking them to
congratulate the teens.
   Forty-nine governors and President Bush complied. But a Romer
aide replied that the governor couldn't send letters of
congratulations to Eagle Scouts outside of the state because of the
number of requests and a limited budget.
   The Eagle Scout medal is the highest honor awarded to Boy
Scouts. Only about 2 percent achieve it.
   Both Baker and Kahill were telephone guests on the radio
program. ``We're not trying to cause trouble. We're just
disappointed that your governor didn't recognize what we did,''
Baker said.

<HEAD>Keenan Recalls Terry Anderson's Plans for Freedom</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Hostages Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Journalist Terry Anderson, the
longest-held Western hostage in Lebanon, has talked tirelessly
about his family and remained convinced he will someday be freed to
pursue plans to aid troubled boys, former captive Brian Keenan said
Thursday.
   Keenan described Anderson as ``a bit of a bulky and belligerent
newspaperman ... who had a voracious hunger for intellectual
conversation.
   ``And when he did not get it would pace the floor endlessly in
his patched and repatched and much more patched _ but still very
holey _ socks,'' said Keenan, who was released to Irish authorities
in Syria on Saturday.
   Anderson, kidnapped in Beirut on March 16, 1985, is the chief
Middle East correpondent for The Associated Press. Keenan said he
last saw Anderson 11 months ago, after being held with him for
eight months. Anderson was born in Lorain, Ohio, and grew up in
Batavia, N.Y.
   Keenan said Anderson, 42, and other the hostages frequently
suffered from ``Beirut belly,'' which he said ``is not a pleasant
illness.''
   Guards generally ignored the hostages complaints of illness, but
would sometimes hand out antibiotics, Keenan said.
   ``And so, having had some ease from his `Beirut belly,' Terry
would be back again to his forceful debates on many subjects which
kept us awake for many hours,'' Keenan said.
   ``I think Terry debated with himself a lot while we tried to
plug our ears with bits of mattress and bits of pillow.
   ``Yes, Terry will also like us all take his periods of despair
and seek solace in his family ... Terry and perhaps myself would
sit through those long nights, speak with much pain and remorse and
a great longing and love for his first daughter, Gabrielle.
   ``She is a much older child than when he last he saw her, and
with many tears he would elaborate his plans to bring her to the
states to have that fatherly sharing of love and affection with
her, to help her to shape and discover her future.
   ``In these confessional moments, which were common to us all, a
deep and enduring and unbreakable bond was formed,'' Keenan said.
   ``Beyond the bluster which we each maintained, Terry's life was
shaping itself toward his children with this deep burden of love,
this deep burden of need.
   ``But Terry's aggressive quality has not left him. I watched him
and worked with him as he did over all the years design and evolve
a project for a school for young delinquent boys in America _
everything worked out in fine, meticulous and authoritative detail,
indeed quite a masterpiece of thought and the depth of conviction.
He felt so committed to these things that he inspired us to our own
survival projects,'' said Keenan.
   Asked whether Anderson was confident that he would some day be
free, Keenan replied simply: ``Yes.''

   Q: Mr. President, a related question about this. There are some
Iraqi opposition groups in London and elsewhere and the Kurds. And
they've all said in recent weeks they've heard nothing from your
administration. If anything, they've been encouraged just to _ that
the United States only wants covert contacts with them. Why not, if
as you say, you want the Iraqi people to rise up, why have you _
why has this administration not done anything with the opposition
groups?
   A: We've got _ we've got a plan, and the plan is to work
diplomatically, and the plan is to put on the ground a significant
military force. And if these comments I made today about anybody
who wants to help the United Nations and those of us who want to
see Iraq out of Kuwait succeed, so much the better.
   Q: If I could just follow up, you said also today you don't want
to hurt the Iraqi people. But isn't this embargo and these
sanctions only hurting them, and hurting them first before they
hurt Saddam?
   A: There's nothing that's painless, David, when you get into a
situation like this, when you have a leader that is _ could
brutalize his own people. There's nothing that's painless in all of
this.
   Q: On the question of negotiations, Mr. President, are all
channels still open? Specifically, have there been any back channel
contacts or proposals from White House officials that are worth
pursuing?
   A: None that I know of.
   Q: If I could follow on that, sir. Saddam Hussein has suggested
that _ that you and he and Margaret Thatcher go on TV to debate
this. What do you say to that?
   A: I say you can put an empty chair there as far as I'm
concerned.
   Q: Mr. President, in your pep talk to the armed services
yesterday, you mentioned the difficulty of the mission, citing the
weather. Isn't boredom even a bigger factor as weeks, and ... into
months over in the desert?
   A: Well, I _ I would hope not. But I'm not sure it's the world's
most exciting assignment, if that what's you mean. But I think
there'll be programs to keep morale high. Right now it's
extraordinarily high.
   Q: A suggestion has been made that some reduction in the troops
might be made in the days ahead to give a more international tinge
to the force over there. Would you entertain such _ or support such
a move?
   A: I'm _ I'm more interested in seeing the fulfillment of
commitments made. Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, you're about to begin a new round of budget
negotiations, federal employees are facing furloughs because of the
Gramm-Rudman Law, and this operation is costing over $1 billion a
month. How do you assess the impact of the cost of operation Desert
Shield on your budget problem?
   A: It's difficult at this juncture to know fully what the impact
will be. Clearly it'll have some budget implications. I have not
moved off of my view that we must get a budget agreement with
Congress as soon as they get back. And I'll have more to say about
that in the weeks ahead. But I really haven't changed my view on
that, and I think it'll be very clear to members of Congress that _
that the deficit problem has gotten worse as a result of the action
that we have had to take.
   Q: If I could follow that up _
   A: Yes.
   Q: _ Sen. Leahy has suggested a sort of war tax to pay for this.
How do you feel about that concept?
   A: Well, I don't feel that the _ that the answer is a war tax.
Yes, Rita?
   Q: Mr. President, do you have any problem with the live TV
coverage of Saddam Hussein's media events, which a lot of people
complain that this gives him a propaganda platform?
   A: No, I have no complaints about it. I think that _ that it
hasn't helped him very much in _ with world opinion. I don't know
what it's done at home. Maybe it's been reassuring to the people
there, but I don't think that it is cutting into the desire to see
the U.N. sanctions fulfilled. It _ I must say, I haven't seen the
last couple of interviews with the man. But it's _ I think the one
with the _ what he calls ``guests'' and what we call ``hostages'' _
was really so brutal and so totally unacceptable that it _ that it
worked against him. It was manipulative and cynical. And so I
haven't been concerned that he's got a shot there.
   He's had a real opportunity to present his case to the American
people. I'd like to have a similar opportunity to present our case
to the people in Iraq, but I _ I have no _ no complains about that
at all, Rita.

   Q: Mr. President, could you accept a situation where Iraq
withdraws from Kuwait, but keeps its military power intact,
regardless of who's in charge?
   A: Well, again, that's too hypothetical. I want to see the goals
that I stated fulfilled. And, of course, I think, part of that
would be _ I think the world would demand that there be no _ no
chance of a _ you know, another invasion right the minute _ the
minute this _ this ended.
   Q: If I can follow, sir, Sen. Lugar and some others have said
this is something that we should discuss now.
   A: Well, we are discussing it now. I had dinner with him last
night, as a matter of fact, because I knew he felt that way. It was
a very good evening, as a matter of fact. I had about 11, 12
members of Congress over there, and it was helpful to me to get
these diverse views. I got some of the feeling of that from
briefing the Congress. But I have great respect for Dick Lugar, and
so we'll be talking more. But I have not changed my _ the
objectives you'll notice _ the publicly stated objectives here.
Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, what is the ... amount of money you're
expecting from the allies?
   A: There is no total price tag that I have in mind _ yeah. I do
have to go in a couple of questions _
   Q: Mr. President, has _
   A: _ after _ after two.
   Q: Has Israel served as a strategic ally in this crisis? And is
there anything you can do now to protect Israel and Saudi Arabia
against chemical attacks as was threatened today?
   A: Israel has behaved very well, and Israel has never had
difficulty defending itself. And in terms of Saudi Arabia, we are
committed to the defense of Saudi Arabia, and I believe that we
have major stake in protecting them against that kind of further
aggression.
   Q: May I follow up? On the countries you're asking for
assistance, have you asked South Africa to contribute anything to
this?
   A: I don't think we have asked any of these countries _ well, we
may have asked some of them so far, but I don't know that there has
been a request made of South Africa or not. Yeah, last one.
   Q: Mr. President, some of the members of Congress who attended
the meeting with you the other day left here with the feeling that
the longer situation drags on, the lesser the chance there is of
outright fighting involving US troops. At the moment, what is your
assessment of the risk of fighting involving our forces?
   A: Well, it's so hard to answer that question because of the
unpredictable nature of Saddam Hussein himself. And so, I think
it's almost impossible. I have had meetings today with some of our
top analysts and specialists on the Arab world. And I'm not _ I
don't want to put words in their mouth, but that was one of the
questions that I asked, and it's very hard to get a _ to predict.
It's very hard to measure intentions.
   But I think the answer is to have the forces in place to be
ready. I would think that the defense of south _ of Saudi Arabia is
far more assured today that it was two weeks ago, because the
United States and others have moved substantial forces there, and
they're ready and they're strong and they're able, and their morale
is high. And, similarly, there's a lot of naval power and, of
course, air power that's there. And I would think that that would
be a deterrent to any _ anybody with any degree of rationality.
Having said that, I don't know what it _ what is in this man's mind.
   Q: To follow up, sir _
   Q: In the back, sir _
   Q: _ to follow up, sir, what actions by Iraq would trigger _
what actions by Iraq, sir, would trigger a US response?
   A: Well, that is too broad a question to get a response from.
But I _ we are ready, and if there is some provocative action, why
then we'd have to make a determination at that time. But I can't _
I just can't help you. Your question's too broad. Last one from
Texas. Craig? And then I've got to go; I really do.
   Q: Mr. President _
   Q: Mr. President, I _
   A: Yeah, Craig?
   Q: Thank you. Mr. President _
   A: This isn't your back of the room here.
   Q: Are you concerned that this burden sharing as you call it is
going to make American forces look like mercenaries in the Middle
East?
   A: Well, I wouldn't want to have anything done that would make
them look like mercenaries. But I don't think so. In fact, we would
be very careful that that conclusion could not be drawn. I raised
that question to some _ one of the members of Congress asked me
that, and said I don't want the mercenary forces.
   But there are ways that burden sharing can be accomplished
without making the forces mercenary, and I'm thinking of the
enormous fuel bills that are involved and transportation and these
kinds of things that are involved in moves of this nature. But I'm
glad you raised it, because US forces should never appear to be
mercenary forces, and that will not be the outcome of this, I can
guarantee you.
   Thank you all very much. Thank you so much.
   Q: Mr. President, what do you make of the back and forth on the
women and children?
   (The President does not respond to the last question.)

<TEXT>
   The military's Stars and Stripes
newspaper said Thursday that some U.S. Air Force crews flying
troops and supplies to Saudi Arabia suffer from fatigue and are
pushing safety to the limit.
   Also Thursday, Wolfgang Hofmann, a spokesman for U.S. Air Force
Europe at Ramstein Air Base, said it may take weeks to determine
the cause of the crash of a U.S. Air Force C-5A transport plane
Wednesday that killed 13 people and injured four.
   Officials at the U.S. Army hospital in Landstuhl said Thursday
the four injured were not in life-threatening condition.
   The most seriously injured was Capt. Cynthia Borecky, who
suffered broken ankles and burns to her hands and face, said
hospital spokesman Staff Sgt. Rourk Sheehan.
   The other three injured were recovering from lacerations and
bruises and are expected to be released within five days, Sheehan
said.
   Stars and Stripes, an authorized but unoffical military
publication, interviewed a C-5 crew at Rhein-Main Air Base near
Frankfurt just hours after the Ramstein crash.
   Thousands of U.S. troops and tons of military supplies are being
flown to Saudi Arabia through Rhein-Main in the Desert Shield
operation.
   ``Considering fatigue, limited crew rest and the long days we're
working, we've shaved the safety margin in some instances as narrow
as it should be shaved,'' the newspaper quoted U.S. Air Force Lt.
Col. Jack Gray as saying.
   Gray is the commander of a C-5 flight from Dover Air Force Base,
Del. He said he wouldn't speculate on what caused the Ramstein
crash.
   But Gray and his crew admitted fatigue has been a major concern
during Desert Shield, in which they have flown several missions to
Saudi Arabia.
   The newspaper quoted Maj. Tam Rogers as saying: ``You can get
burned out very easily. Guys can become walking zombies almost
incapable of making good judgments.''
   Many crews get only a 10-to-12-hour layover after arriving in
Germany from the United States before flying on to Saudi Arabia,
Stars and Stripes reported.
   Officials at Ramstein, 90 miles south of Frankfurt, said the
crew of the C5-A that crashed had a 24-hour break before taking off.
   ``Without specifically commenting on anything that was said in
the article, I have to make the point that during a major airlift
operation the rules do not change for the Military Airlift
Command,'' said Col. James Murphy, Commander of the 608th Military
Airlift Group at Ramstein. Murphy's group handles scheduling of
transport crews at the base.
   He said when there is not a crisis situation, such as the Desert
Shield operation, ``We are able to give the crews more rest.''
   Murphy said air commanders are required to watch the performance
of their crews to make sure they are not fatigued.
   The aircraft commander can request additional rest time if he
feels his crew is too tired to fly safely, Murphy said.

<HEAD>Convicted Bankers Seek New Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five international bankers and a Colombian
businessman convicted last month in a $32 million drug-money
laundering scheme are asking for a new trial on a claim of jury
misconduct.
   Their request, filed Tuesday, said U.S. District Judge William
Terrell Hodges did not go far enough in questioning jurors to see
if they had been affected by an unusual incident during
deliberations.
   A curious juror found a telephone number in a notebook
introduced as evidence and called the number _ that of a reputed
member of the Medellin cocaine cartel. Hodges dismissed that juror
and let the 11 others proceed after questioning them individually.
   The five officers of the Luxembourg-based Bank of Credit and
Commerce International and the Colombian were convicted of helping
federal undercover agents launder $14 million. During a two-year
sting, $32 million in drug profits was laundered.
   The defendants face 10- to 30-year prison terms under federal
sentencing guidelines, possibly without parole. They were jailed
after the guilty verdicts were announced July 29. Sentencing is
scheduled for Oct. 3.
   Those convicted were Ian Howard and Sibte Hassan of BCCI's Paris
branch; Amjad Awan and Akbar A. Bilgrami of BCCI's Miami branch;
Syed Aftab Hussain, who worked in Panama; and Colombian aircraft
broker Rudolf Armbrecht.

   Here are excerpts from Brian Keenan's
statement and answers to questions on his 4{ years as a hostage in
Lebanon. He spoke Thursday at a news conference in Dublin:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   EXCERPTS FROM STATEMENT:
   Hostage is crucifying aloneness. There's a silent screaming
slide into the bowels of ultimate despair.
   Hostage is a man hanging by his fingernails over the edge of
chaos and feeling his fingers slowly straightening.
   Hostage is the humiliating stripping away of every sense and
fiber of body and mind and spirit that make you what you are.
   Hostage is a mutant creation full of self-loathing, guilt and
death-wishing, but he is a man, a rare, unique and beautiful
creation of which these things are no part.
   You here, the press, have now a real opportunity to reach out
and help those people, whoever and whatever they are. Seize that
chance, to reach out and give part of yourselves to them.
   There is no victory in condemnation or retribution, that
separates us from the finest and most creative part of our being as
people. All men everywhere seek that quality of justice by which
they may fulfill their life and their life experience. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   How can I forget Johnny McCarthy (a British journalist and
fellow hostages), whose humor, whose mimicry, whose abundant love
of life on so many times seemed to diminish to almost extinction
those grinding moments of hopelessness? ...
   I'm trying simply to say that this abundant love of life with
John suffered, as with us all, a terrible and awful diminution, and
those moments of hopelessness were certainly a grinding of mind and
of heart. ...
   In John-boy, I saw a man grow, I saw a man deepen, and it was a
real joy to be a witness to that.
   But sometimes, unfortunately for us, humor is John's forte, and
it infused and infested us all. I remember how, when we had no
reading material for over a year, we played 17-hour marathon games
of dominoes. During those viciously competitive exercises in
lunacy, we adopted various personae. Can you imagine what it would
be like to play with `a Viennese doctor ... who was having the most
exciting sexualisms with some amazing but very plain hausfraus from
Bavaria. ...' was usual from John. And he usually beat me with
these exciting stories he would tell in his huge, huge box of
personalities.
   There is a famous quotation from John Milton: `The mind is its
own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, or a hell of
heaven.' The problem with that eloquent sentence is that, how can
you control the mind when the mind itself has already chosen to go
its own way, independent of one's will, one's desire, one's need?
Each of us fathomed the depths of mania, of despair, that awful
howling wilderness where one felt like no more than a speck of dust
in an alien cosmos.
   John-boy's ever-present good nature and sanity touched us all
with light and thrust us back to the world. John was the youngest,
and our evening benediction frequently was a chorus of `Night
John-boy. Night John-boy. Night John-boy.' John-boy was not pleased.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   We all often thought, how could we relate to anyone, how could
we relate to anyone what we had been thinking? Tiny, tiny cells,
constant blindfolds, prolonged days in the dark, sometimes weeks
without light create kinds of insanity that drive men deep, deep
into themselves.
   Other people one begins to look at with strange, mistrustful
apprehension.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I am sure that the first few days, perhaps weeks, will be one of
the waves of manic states where you go up and down. John is a
strong man now, he is a very strong man, he will understand and his
first thoughts will be, `Good, Brian is home. Good, Brian is seeing
my family.' His psychological condition will drop, he is alone.
   My one thought always is that the first time I was alone it
didn't seem really so bad, although there are moments I don't want
to talk about. However, having been with John I never wanted to be
alone again because you now had an experience of what it was to be
alone so you knew what you didn't want and what was going to happen
to you. Even though you were prepared, it's not always that one can
have such grasp on the mind.
   Courage is not something that's got to do with physical strength
or aggression, courage is something that has to do with the ability
to control fear. My fear has different depths and different
qualities. Some of it is beyond any man's ability to control fully.

   Gov. James Blanchard and his spurned running
mate, long-time women's rights champion Martha Griffiths, have
buried the hatchet after their messy political split, a campaign
official said Thursday.
   Blanchard and his two-term lieutenant governor held a private
meeting Wednesday night, their first since the governor dumped her
from the ticket Aug. 24. His spokeswoman, Katie Wolf, said the
meeting made unlikely an intraparty battle at the state Democratic
convention Sept. 7-9 in Flint.
   ``I think it means that we'll have a wonderful convention,'' she
said. ``At least I anticipate that we will have a very unified
convention and strong support for the governor.''
   The Blanchard-Griffiths reunion, at an annual Democratic
legislative retreat on Mackinac Island, also produced a denial from
Griffiths that she was referring to her boss when she talked used
the term ``son of a bitch'' in an interview.
   ``She was very, very warm to the governor and friendly and told
him some of the references printed in the paper she did not make in
reference to him,'' Wolf said.
   In an interview published in the Detroit Free Press Wednesday,
Griffiths said: ``To watch some son of a bitch ... you've done a
big favor for turn around and hurt you is terrible.''
   Griffiths later denied that she was referring specifically to
Blanchard and said she was just talking about ``politics in
general,'' The Detroit News reported Thursday.
   Griffiths said she will announce Tuesday whether she will try to
buck Blanchard's decision at the convention.
   The convention must affirm Blanchard's choice for the second
spot on the ticket, which he has not yet revealed.
   Blanchard has credited Griffiths with propelling him to victory
in his first gubernatorial election in 1982 with her vote-getting
ability among women and senior citizens.
   Griffiths, a 20-year member of Congress, reacted bitterly when
Blanchard said he needed a running mate ready to step in for the
governor at a moment's notice.
   Blanchard, 48, hinted that it was Griffiths' health, not her age
of 78 that convinced him to pick another running mate, but he
declined to elaborate. Griffiths said he had offered to keep her on
the ticket if she would release her medical records and tax returns.
   Blanchard faces state Senate Majority Leader John Engler in the
November election.

   Rain was scattered across the Southeast on Thursday, along with
large hail and damaging wind, and rain also fell from the Pacific
Northwest into Wyoming.
   Afternoon showers and thunderstorms extended from east-central
Mississippi across central and southern Alabama into Georgia and
Florida, and along the upper Texas coast and the coast of Louisiana.
   Three-quarter-inch hail fell near Cordelle, Ga., with one-inch
hail near Huxford, Ala., and hail as big as golf balls near
Centreville, Ala., the National Weather Service said.
   Thunderstorms produced wind strong enough to damage trees and
power lines in parts of Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia, the
weather service said.
   The cool front that touched off most of the rain also broke a
record heat wave in Alabama. After days of temperatures at 100 or
more, the day's highs were in the 90s. That allowed the Alabama
Department of Public Health to discontinue a critical heat alert
for central and southern Alabama that had been issued Tuesday.
   Elsewhere, rain and thunderstorms reached from Washington
through the Idaho Panhandle into southern and western Montana,
northern Utah and western and central Wyoming.
   Rain also fell over eastern Kansas.
   The heaviest rain during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT was 1.59
inches at Centreville, Ala.
   Cheyenne, Wyo., warmed to a record high of 93, and Colorado
Springs, Colo., tied its record of 93.
   Thursday's low for the Lower 48 states was 35 at Truckee, Calif.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 58 at
Mullan, Idaho, to 105 at Palm Springs, Calif.

   The high hopes of American women and children
in Iraq for an early departure from that country have been
frustrated by ``inhumane and disgraceful'' delays, the State
Department said Thursday.
   At the same time, President Bush said he will press ahead with
his policies irrespective of the possibility that Americans held in
Iraq and Kuwait might be harmed.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler assailed Iraq for
failing to issue exit visas after President Saddam Hussein said
Tuesday that all foreign women and children would be allowed to
leave Iraq.
   But Iraqi Ambassador Mohamed al-Mashat said that Iraq was
``working to expedite the departure'' of the estimated 1,000
American women and children in Iraq and Kuwait.
   Iraq has said American men will not be allowed to leave unless
the Bush administration gives assurances it will not attack Iraq
militarily.
   Bush said he will not allow the presence of the almost 3,000
Americans in Iraq and Kuwait to influence his decisions on the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``I feel very concerned about Americans held against their will
but we cannot permit hostage-taking to shape the foreign policy of
this country,'' Bush told a news conference.
   Asked whether that means the hostages are expendable, Bush said
that question was too hypothetical.
   He added that he believes other leaders with hostages in Iraq
and Kuwait also will continue to stick by their policies.
   Ms. Tutwiler said Iraqi authorities are insisting that each
American wishing to leave submit a letter, with a translation into
Arabic, outlining that objective. The letter must also carry a
stamp from fiscal authorities certifying that all local taxes have
been paid.
   ``This emotional roller coaster is inhumane and disgraceful,''
she said. ``We hesitate to dignify these demands as `exit
procedures'. '' She said the Iraqi regulations are ``constantly
changing and extremely confusing.''
   Other U.S. officials said they are worried that Iraq
authorities, during their bureaucratic inquiries, may try to elicit
from American women information on the whereabouts of their
husbands.
   Iraqi troops have rounded up about 70 Americans since the
invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   But Americans are continuing to escape the two countries. Ms.
Tutwiler revised the number of Americans in Iraq from 500 to 400 on
Thursday. The last estimate of Americans in Kuwait was 2,500 but
that figure is now considered obsolete because of departures over
the past two weeks. There is no estimate on the number of those who
have escaped.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the requirements Iraq has outlined are
applicable to American women and children wishing to leave Iraq and
it is not clear whether the same procedures will be applied to
those in Kuwait.
   About 25 pregnant women and 60 small children are among the
Americans eligible to return to the United States under the
Saddam's new guidelines.
   Ambassador al-Mashat denied reports that Iraq was insisting that
any American evacuation flights arriving in Baghdad carry food and
medicines for needy Iraqis.
   The envoy spoke to reporters after an hour-long meeting at the
State Department.
   Meanwhile, 36 members of the Iraqi diplomatic staff in
Washington who were ordered out of the United States by the State
Department were heading home Thursday aboard a Jordanian airliner
that left New York.
   They had been given until Thursday afternoon to leave U.S.
territory. The State Department expelled them in retaliation for
Iraq's demand that all foreign embassies in Kuwait, including the
American embassy, be shut down. That order has been widely ignored.

   EXCERPTS FROM ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS:
   I'll give you a rough day. Every day was the same. They came in
the morning, they gave you a round of Arabic bread with some
processed cheese, some jam and a cup of tea, and they went off. And
they came in the afternoon and they gave you a bowl of rice and
lentils, or a bowl of rice and spinach, or a bowl of rice and dog's
head soup. ...
   Some of the food in the middle period was very bad. I must state
the last nine months, approximately, when we were brought from
Baalbek to the southern suburbs, we had excellent cuisine. The room
was very clean. We were frequently asked, do you want anything? And
if it was possible for them to get it, they did.
   Like they gave us fruit every day. We had meat at that period,
they would occasionally show us a video, and the situation had
very, very obviously and very, very markedly changed. Beyond that
every day was the same.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I don't think that I was ever in any doubt that I would get
home, or be released at some stage. I never allowed myself to think
that they were going to shoot me. And if they were, what was the
point in thinking about it? So, I was confident I would get home
sometime. I was frightened it would be a long time. I continually
told myself, and told them, that you take only from me my liberty,
you don't take my freedom. That you can never take.
   As for my sisters, I am dumbfounded, I am amazed, I am
thunderstruck at the work that they have put in, at the change in
their personality, at the growth they have undergone. I'm a little
bit afraid of them. It is a wonder to me, the change _ marked,
beautiful, fantastic.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   After many days fighting with these guys who took me, not
physically, I demanded to know on several occasions why I had been
taken. They seemed somewhat confused that they had an Irish person.
I refused to eat for six days until they told me and they brought
me a copy of The Times covering the incidents in Libya (the U.S.
bombing) and told me that was the reason and I didn't believe them.
I think they gave me The Times because they were frightened I
wasn't eating and they had to tell me something.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I feel no desire for vengeance, I feel no desire for
retribution. I don't see those as positive, I don't see them as
meaningful. I think I said that those things, for myself I find
self-maiming. I don't intend maiming myself by going into a rage of
anger. I see no purpose in it.
   Some of those men who held us and who could speak English were
reasonable. They had some, but limited, knowledge of the world. On
no occasions attempted to brainwash us. They did talk of their
faith, they did talk of Islam, they gave us a Koran which we had
for a year with no other reading material. It was not an attempt to
convert us. In fact on one occasion, I believe perhaps two, two of
the captors, as it is obligatory in their faith, asked us quite
simply, would we like to convert? We simply held up our chains and
said, ``No chance, pal.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Some, most of our captors, held and exemplified a great burden
of guilt, whether that is indicative and built-in to Islam, I'm no
theologian. Some of them would not participate in the beatings,
left immediately. Some of those who did were overcome by remorse.
...
   You must remember that some of these guards have very minimal
education, they have no knowledge of the outside world, it's not
taught at school. They watch a lot of very, very violent American
TV violence so the whole world for them is that. Men of 30 years
old, perhaps with a 12-year-old mentality, someone has stuck a
Kalashnikov in their hand. ... Well, they just can't control the
opportunity, sometimes, to beat very badly.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The top leadership of the group never spoke to me directly. They
never spoke about themselves. ... Any questions that were put to me
were put to me through a lieutenant, so we spoke about Iran quite
frequently but as regards the leadership ... I never spoke with
them.

   President Bush had some fun Thursday at the
expense of his spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, giving higher marks for
sharp dressing to an Iraqi seen often on television reading the
words of Saddam Hussein.
   The lighthearted moment came at an otherwise-serious White House
news conference, when a reporter quoted Fitzwater as saying Bush
was ``pretty adamant and stubborn'' about vacationing in Maine
despite the Mideast crisis.
   ``I wouldn't call it `adamant' or `stubborn,''' the president
answered.
   The red-faced Fitzwater, watching the news conference from the
wings, indicated he certainly wouldn't either.
   ``He better not have,'' Bush said, to widespread laughter.
   ``Marlin's going through kind of a downer, though, because the
Iraqi spokesman has the matching tie and hankie, you know, so it's
been a little difficult,'' Bush teased.
   Several of the Iraqi president's statements have been read on
television by Miqdad Muradi, a dapper anchorman on the Iraqi
state-run television network. Muradi is always impeccably dressed
in a dark suit and sober tie.

<HEAD>Key Witness in Marion Barry Trial Gets Probation on Drug
Conviction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on
Thursday sentenced a key witness in the trial of Washington Mayor
Marion Barry to five years' probation on drug charges.
   Charles Lewis, a former Virgin Islands government employee,
could have received a maximum 80-year prison term on his conviction
in April 1989 for possessing and selling crack cocaine.
   Instead, U.S. District Judge Stanley Brotman sentenced Lewis to
a five-year probation program during which he must perform 1,000
hours of community service and undergo periodic tests for drug use.
   In handing down the sentence, Brotman said Lewis had extensively
cooperated with the Barry investigation.
   Lewis thanked his friends and family for their support.
   ``I'm sorry for it,'' he said of his drug conviction. ``The past
several months I have been penitent.''
   Lewis, 50, returned to his native St. Thomas on Aug. 3 after
serving a 15-month prison sentence in Washington for a drug
conviction there.
   His Washington attorney, Mark Shaffer, said that he had been
rehabilitated and that further time in prison would serve no
purpose.
   In a memorandum filed with the court here, Terry Halpern, the
U.S. attorney for the Virgin Islands, had requested leniency in
return for Lewis' cooperation in the Barry case.
   The mayor was convicted Aug. 10 on a single count of cocaine
possession, a misdemeanor, and acquitted on a second count. The
jury was unable to agree on 12 other counts, including felony
perjury charges.
   The federal investigation of Barry began after District of
Columbia police called off an attempt to make an undercover drug
buy from Lewis on finding that the mayor was in his hotel room.
   During Barry's six-week trial, Lewis was the star witness,
testifying extensively on the mayor's drug use.
   ``The FBI and government motion indicated the defendant provided
substantial assistance in the prosecution,'' Halpern said after
Thursday's hearing.
   Lewis also reportedly gave federal investigators information
about a joint District of Columbia-Virgin Islands personnel project
of which he was previously co-director. No charges have brought as
a result of that investigation, although Lewis was fired from his
post by Gov. Alexander Farrelly in April 1988 for alleged
mismanagement.
   Lewis was arrested March 3, 1989, at a St. Thomas hotel after
selling crack to a female undercover FBI agent.

<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RONALD BLUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moving the historical setting of operas around
is a tricky task, and only a few productions have survived the
transport of time and space.
   Frank Corsaro's ``Carmen'' at the New York City Opera is one of
them, and the Spanish Civil War production that debuted in 1984 is
being revived this season at Lincoln Center's New York State
Theater.
   Instead of putting the action in Seville of the 1820s, the
singers are transported to 1936, when Francisco Franco's fascists
were attempting to overthrow the Loyalists.
   Carmen is a Loyalist leader instead of a gypsy and Don Jose is a
fascist soldier whom she attempts to win over to the anti-Franco
side. Escamillo, the toreador, is a drunk with fascist sympathies.
   By giving everything political overtones, the attention
naturally is shifted from the singing to the acting and the
production. Even in the best of cases, this is a stretch, leading
to such absurdities as the Rhinemaidens as prostitutes in the
Patrice Chereau Ring at Bayreuth or the Citicorp building in the
background of the Peter Sellars ``Figaro'' that was set in New
York's Trump Tower.
   Nevertheless, the Corsaro approach holds up for the most part.
It's hard to watch Escamillo in a sports jacket and tie, looking
somewhat like an overweight golfer, but it does fit quite nicely
into the overall scheme of things.
   One does miss the spectacle of the entrance into the bullring at
the start of the fourth act; six soldiers parading back and forth
do not quite adequately fill in the matadors and animals that are
customary.
   In Wednesday night's performance, Sharon Graham sang Carmen,
originated by Victoria Vergara in Corsaro's original production.
While Graham sang ably, she was not able to dominate the opera as a
top Carmen should.
   Brian Hilt made his debut with the company as Don Jose. His
voice was powerful but seemed to strain at times, especially during
the Flower Song.
   Dean Peterson sang Escamillo and Michele Boucher was an
especially sweet Micaela.

in his quest for additional Persian Gulf support for Operation

   The country joins Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in
allowing U.S. troops to be based on their soil in response to
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   Williams said the U.S. government was ``especially pleased'' by
Qatar's decision.
   The spokesman added that elements of the 12th Combat Aviation
Brigade and the aviation elements of the 3rd Armored Division were
also deploying to Saudi Arabia.
   Both units are located in West Germany and become the first Army
helicopter units from European positions to be sent to Saudi Arabia.
   The units include: AH-64 Apache attack helicopters; UH-60 Black
Hawk utility helicopters; OH-58 Kiowa reconnaisance helicopters;
CH-47 Chinook medium lift cargo helicopters; and UH-1 Huey
helicopters, as well as their support personnel.
   The Apache is the Army's chief anti-tank weapon and carries
Hellfire missiles to pierce enemy armor.
   Offering an update of the Navy's effort to block Iraqi shipping,
Williams said that some 250 ships have been intercepted.
   Two ships _ one Sri Lankan and one Panamanian _ were boarded on
Wednesday, but both were allowed to proceed into the Gulf of
Aquaba, the spokesman said.
   No Iraqi or Kuwaiti vessels have been boarded during the effort,
he said.
   Williams declined to give a total number of boardings, saying
``slightly more than a handful'' had undergone a close-up
inspection by Navy officials.
   The spokesman also confirmed that the Pentagon's comptroller,
Sean O'Keefe, has asked the services and all departments to
``explore all options and alternatives for reducing costs'' in
order to help fund Desert Shield.
   Limiting exercises, minimizing purchases of supplies and cutting
back on nonessential maintenance were suggested as belt-tightening
measures.
   The announcements came as officials also defended the military's
sealift operation, which has encountered some problems in
transporting the masses of tanks, armored vehicles and heavy
equipment to Saudi Arabia.
   Williams noted that the Antares, one of the eight fast sealift
ships heading to Saudi Arabia ``has had a number of boiler
problems,'' was under tow by a Navy tug, and was being worked on by
its engineering crew. The vessel is carrying equipment for the 24th
Infantry Division (Mechanized), a unit with heavy M-1 tanks.
   Two other ships, the Curtiss and the Gulf Banker, have also had
boiler problems that were being repaired, Williams said.
   ``You would expect problems in an operation this massive, but I
would not want it to be described as something that is bogging down
or going badly,'' Williams said.
   Williams contended that the Pentagon has moved ``more equipment,
personnel, and supplies ... in the first three weeks of this
operation than we did in the first three months of the Korean War.
... We just haven't done anything this massive, this quickly,
before.''
   Asked about complaints voiced privately by some Army officials
about the pace of the shipping deployment, Williams said,
``Obviously, every commander who's there would like to have every
part of his group or unit ... with him as soon as he gets there,
but that's not a realistic thing. I don't think anyone expected
that.''
   An official from the Military Sealift Command said 19 ships have
arrived in Saudi Arabia and been unloaded, that two more were
currently being unloaded and that at least ten more were en route
to Saudi Arabia. Five more ships were being loaded on Thursday, the
official added.
   The official said that the process has to be a phased one, since
all ships held in the military's so-called ``ready reserve'' fleet
can't show up at the docks all at once.
   Also, most of the ships are older, steam-driven vessels that are
being taken out of storage, and must be crewed and made ready to
sail. The ships were purchased in the past two decades and put away
for just such an emergency, but many have never been used since,
the official said.
   The Command has also chartered some 20 commercial ships in order
to meet the need for large cargo vessels. Eleven of those are
foreign-flagged and come from such nations as Panama, Bahrain,
Saudi Arabia, Norway, Italy and Britain, the official said.
   ``We've had some problems, but we're overcoming them,'' the
official said.

   U.N. chief Javier Perez de Cuellar arrived
Thursday for talks with Iraq's foreign minister and said he was
hopeful Iraq is ready to discuss ways to ease tension and solve the
crisis caused by its invasion of Kuwait.
   ``I believe that the government of Iraq is as eager as we all
are to find a just and lasting solution of the problem, which is an
explosive one. I can't understand anyone in the world prepared to
sacrifice human lives,'' he said.
   The U.N. secretary-general and Iraq's Tariq Aziz will hold talks
in Amman Friday.
   The secretary-general said his mission was to get Iraq to comply
with Security Concil resolutions demanding unconditional withdrawal
of Iraqi troops from Kuwait and restoration of the government
ousted by the Aug. 2 invasion.
   ``These are not my resolutions. They are Security Council
resolutions. I cannot make any concessions on these,'' he stressed.
   ``I am not a merchant to negotiate. I came here to discuss ways
and means of finding a solution to the problem.
   ``I am hopeful that the Iraqi authorities have accepted my
invitation because they are prepared to discuss with me ways and
means of lessening tension and solving the problem.''
   Perez de Cuellar told a crowded news conference that he invited
Aziz to meet and their talks would be ``within the framework of the
Security Council resolutions.''
   The council has also voted to adopt and enforce an international
trade embargo against Iraq.
   Perez de Cuellar replied ``it is a good step'' when asked to
comment on an Iraqi announcement Tuesday it would allow foreign
women and chldren among the hostages to leave the country.
   The expected exodus had not materialized as of Thursday.
   Foreign Minister Marwan Qassem of Jordan greeted the
secretary-general at Amman's civil airport.
   Their motorcade drove past dozens of parked buses that brought
hundreds of Egyptians who fled Iraq and Kuwait to avoid becoming
engulfed in a possible war. Many Egyptians were sprawled in long
lines on the ground by the airport entrance, waiting to join
special flights taking them home.
   The issue of foreigners trapped by the crisis is expected to be
high on the agenda at the talks between Perez de Cuellar and Aziz.
   The U.N. chief is staying at the royal palace as guest of Crown
Prince Hassan, who is acting as regent in the absence of King
Hussein.
   Asked if he would fly to Baghdad to confer with Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein, Perez de Cuellar said, ``I am not seeking to see
anyone.''
   More than 100 news media representatives were at the 10-minute
news conference.
   The secretary-general joshed with reporters as they yelled
questions at him.
   ``If you come and see me in private I'll tell you,'' he replied,
smiling, when a reporter asked him if he had a secret formula to
propose to Aziz.
   During his brief stopover in Paris on his way to Amman from New
York, he said he sought a meeting with Aziz because he could not
``remain indifferent.''
   ``The situation is very tense and difficult. Human lives risk
being lost,'' he said.
   He said however his mission came out, ``I will have for me, for
my own conscience, a sort of satisfaction: `You did your best.'''

<TEXT>
   On the eve of Solidarity's 10th
anniversary, Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki returned to its
birthplace Thursday to plead for backing from workers disillusioned
with the leaders they helped put in power.
   At a separate news conference, the union's founder, Lech Walesa,
directed harsh criticism at Mazowiecki's Solidarity-led government.
Walesa said the year-old non-Communist government has been too slow
in democratizing Poland's parliament.
   Poland put itself at the vanguard of Eastern Europe's democratic
revolution when it installed the region's first non-Communist
government a year ago. However, since then, that government has
fallen afoul of Solidarity chairman Walesa and other critics who
say it should move faster to jettison the remaining trappings of
four decades of Communist rule.
   Mazowiecki, who came to the Gdansk shipyard Thursday with five
of his ministers, was asked during the 3{-hour meeting to explain
why his government has not moved faster to create a free-market
economy and dismiss Communist holdovers from government and
managerial positions.
   Walesa was absent from the meeting hall at the northern port. He
said earlier he did not want to detract from the prime minister's
appearance.
   It was in the same hall that Walesa, with Mazowiecki _ then an
adviser _ at his side, signed the historic accord with the
Communist government on Aug. 31, 1980, to give birth to Eastern
Europe's first independent workers movement.
   At his news conference Thursday, the chairman of the 10-year-old
union declared he is still fighting for fulfillment of the 1980
strikes' 21 demands. Walesa said that means bringing Poland to full
democracy by free parliamentary and presidential elections.
   Walesa also accused the Mazowiecki government, which he helped
create, of moving too slowly to replace the present parliament,
where 65 percent of the seats were reserved for the subsequently
dissolved Communist Party or its allies. He also said the
arrangement under which former Communist First Secretary Wojciech
Jaruzelski is serving as president is ``outdated.''
   The Solidarity chairman has been waging an unannounced campaign
for the presidency.
   Without mentioning Walesa by name, Mazowiecki replied to the
accusation: ``This government has not been, is not and will not,
hinder political changes. ... We have been speeding up, not by
arguing but by acting.''
   Mazowiecki skirted the issue of whether he would be a candidate
for president, opposing Walesa.
   ``I will answer this question when the problem is put forward
formally, when the right time comes. But I think society should
have the right to choose between candidates,'' he said.
   After meeting workers, Mazowiecki walked through the spawling
shipyard, also the site of strikes in 1988. He then went on to St.
Brygida's, the Roman Catholic church that served as a sanctuary for
Solidarity during its eight years under a ban that followed martial
law in December 1981.
   In the year since the Solidarity-led government ended Communist
rule, it has launched a painful ``shock'' reform program to restore
capitalism, dissolved the secret police and made many other changes.
   Mazowiecki and his ministers, all longtime Solidarity
supporters, listened to complaints from Baltic Solidarity leaders
and rank-and-file workers who packed the hall. Outside, several
hundred more people listened over loudspeakers.
   Complaints ranged from gasoline prices to lack of change in
local governments. But they concentrated on lingering bureaucracy
they blame for harming the shipyard industry and the continued
presence of the old Communist elite in privileged positions.
   ``There are big ministries where people (from the former
government) are still muddling around doing nothing,'' said Wieslaw
Wodyk, union leader at the Gydnia port. ``Will the poor remain poor
and those rich people become even richer?''
   In Vatican City, the Vatican newspaper Thursday paid homage to
Solidarity's 10th anniversary with a plea for unity within its
ranks.
   The front-page editorial of L'Osservatore Romano recalled the
role of Solidarity in the 1980s in forcing the collapse of
Communism in Poland.
   ``We're talking about renewing the spirit of solidarity by all
those who sincerely have the common good at heart,'' said a
commentary signed by the paper's editor, Mario Agnes.

<HEAD>U.S. Infant Mortality Rate Down; Still High Among Industrialized
Nations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Infant mortality in the United States inched
down last year to the lowest level ever recorded, but the U.S. rate
is still higher than many industrialized nations, officials said
Thursday.
   ``Although we've made progress in reducing this nation's infant
mortality, we must do better,'' said Louis Sullivan, secretary of
the Health and Human Services Department.
   The provisional data released by the National Center for Health
Statistics would rank the United States below 21 industrialized
countries on a list comparing 1986 rates, said center spokeswoman
Sandra Smith.
   The ranking is probably still accurate, she said.
   ``We make progress, but so do other countries,'' she said.
   The new data shows that U.S. infant deaths for 1989 were 9.7 per
1,000 live births, down from 9.9 per 1,000.
   The 1989 data for infant mortality was not broken down for
blacks and whites, but final data from 1987 shows that while white
infant deaths amounted to 8.6 per 1,000, the rate for blacks was
17.9.
   Sullivan said the United States ``must continue to direct
prevention, education and health care opportunities to our minority
and poor citizens where infant mortality strikes hardest.''
   Racial disparity was also evident in other health factors,
including life expectancy at birth. The 1989 data shows it
increased half a year for white males but only a tenth of a year
for black males.
   For the entire U.S. population, life expectancy at birth was a
record high of 75.2 years, up from 74.9 years in 1988.
   The new data also shows that AIDS moved from the 15th to the
11th leading cause of death. The estimated 21,360 AIDS deaths last
year was 32 percent higher than the 16,210 deaths from the disease
in 1988, the report said.
   Dr. James Mason, assistant secretary for health, credited
``healthier choices many Americans are making'' for lower
age-adjusted death rates for heart disease and stroke and the
higher life expectancy.
   Those choices, he said, include quitting smoking, watching their
diets and getting more exercise.

   Romania has been particularly hard hit by its
support for sanctions against Iraq and needs credits and other
economic help from the United States and other countries,
Ambassador Virgil Constantinescu said Thursday.
   In return, Constantinescu said, Romania might be able to produce
fuel for U.S. jet fighters based in Saudi Arabia.
   ``We are badly affected,'' he told reporters. ``But the
decisions were right and have to be carried out.''
   The ambassador was explaining his country's plight at the
embassy shortly before President Bush said at a news conference
that his aides were developing a strategy to help the countries
hardest hit by the sanctions.
   A State Department official who spoke on condition of not being
identified said the details of the plan were yet to be formulated
and it was unknown how much Romania would be included in the
assistance.
   The United States, angered by Romanian suppression of dissidents
and demonstrators last June, has suspended non-humanitarian aid to
the country and has refused to grant it favored trade status.
   Ambassador Constantinescu said Romania was still in the process
of moving away from the communism practiced under overthrown
President Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Nonetheless, he said, Romania has enacted the legal framework
for free elections on a par with other emerging democracies in
Eastern Europe, and those countries have been granted favored trade
status.
   Because of the sanctions, Iraq has halted repayment to Romania
on a debt of 1.7 billion dollars, Constantinescu said. Since the
payment was being made in the form of crude oil, Romania is having
to cut back production in its oil refineries by 25 percent.
   Romania also had a number of joint ventures with Iraq that are
having to be curtailed, he said. Iraq was Romania's main trading
partner in the developing world and its eighth-ranking trading
partner overall.
   Constantinescu said Romania was suffering from an unjustifiably
bad image in the capital markets around the world.
   ``Nobody is ready to give money to Romania,'' he said.

<HEAD>Salvadoran Family Ordered Deported to Third Country</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An administrative judge has ordered
immigration authorities to deport members of a Salvadoran family to
a third country rather than return them to their strife-torn nation.
   The ruling was hailed Thursday by a refugee advocacy lawyer as
an important step toward changing the government's policy of
forcing aliens to return to homelands beset by civil war if they
can't prove they are likely to be harmed.
   ``What this decision stands for is an articulated justification
under international law for a generic approach for providing
protection to those who otherwise would be returned to a civil
war,'' Arthur C. Helton, director of the refugee project for The
Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, said about the Aug. 24 decision.
   Helton estimated there are as many as 500,000 Salvadorans living
in this country. The INS last year granted 337 applications for
asylum status while denying 13,861.
   ``It's a promising decision and if upheld on appeal would have a
substantial impact on U.S. practice,'' Helton said. But he conceded
that the decision is based on international law rather than federal
immigration law.
   Helton noted that an attempt by an immigration judge several
years ago to invoke an international treaty to stop the deportation
of Salvadorans was overturned on appeal.
   INS authorities are confident that the decision by Immigration
Judge Paul A. Nejelski would be overturned by the Board of
Immigration Appeals, said an official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The decision does not set a precedent for other cases of
Salvadorans or any other aliens seeking refugee status. It only
applies to the three-member Salvadoran family residing in the
Virginia suburbs of Washington.
   The judge rejected the family members' claims that they were
likely to be persecuted upon returning to El Salvador but said that
``under customary international law, they have a right not to be
deported to El Salvador as long as the current civil war
continues.''
   Helton said that even if the decision is overturned on appeal,
it could contribute to the debate in Congress over a longstanding
proposal to provide safe haven for people fleeing civil strife in
their homelands.
   INS grants extended voluntary departure status to selected
nationalities, most recently Chinese and Afghans, who have fled
civil war in their homelands. But Helton said some members of
Congress have pressed for a generic safe-haven program that would
apply whenever an alien flees civil war.
   ``In the law of nations, the practice is not to return
individuals to situations of civil strife,'' Helton said. ``That is
something that as a matter of policy the executive branch or the
Congress could take heed and implement.''

   Flags were at half staff and prayer
vigils drew dozens of solemn students Thursday as the University of
Florida coped with the stabbing murders of five students at
off-campus housing.
   University President John Lombardi estimated up to 500 students
have abandoned classes and left town. Most of them planned to stay
home until the killer is caught or they feel it is reasonably safe
to return.
   But with a student population of 34,000 at one of the nation's
largest universities, those who stayed away had limited impact on
the bustling school.
   Faculty members reported close-to-normal classloads Wednesday
and Thursday.
   Traffic was heavy and parking was at a premium as usual. Young
men and women in shorts and tennis shoes, lugging backpacks or
books, weaved in and out among the cars and bicycles that clogged
the hilly roads on the sprawling campus.
   Student Body President Mike Browne encouraged students ``to do
what they think puts themselves at the highest level of safety.''
   Student government spent about $3,000 on 6,000 so-called
security whistles, similar to those used by coaches, and volunteers
began distributing them Thursday.
   An annual pep rally for new students scheduled for Thursday
night was called off, and some evening classes were canceled or
dismissed Tuesday and Wednesday.
   Lombardi and Art Sandeen, vice president for student affairs,
reported the mood among students and faculty was businesslike. The
university is not going to be ``held hostage to lunacy,'' Lombardi
said.
   He told students who were fearful or concerned about their
safety after the latest two bodies were discovered Tuesday to go
home if they wanted to, but said the school would not close down.
   Lombardi suspended penalties for non-attendance, extended the
period when classes can be dropped and said students would get help
in making up work when they returned.
   With the long Labor Day holiday weekend approaching, university
officials expected attendance to drop even further. Every year,
thousands of students extend the official three-day weekend by
skipping classes Thursday and Friday.
   University spokesman Larry Humes estimated activity and
attendance was ``at about 85 percent of normal.''
   Anne Jones, who teaches an English class at night, reported
little change but said most students seemed to be ``talked out'' on
the homicides.
   Other state universities in the nine-school system reported a
few University of Florida students were showing interest in
transfers or a one-term shift.
   At the University of South Florida in Tampa, the second-largest
state school with 32,000 students, at least 50 to 60 parents and
students have called the admissions office.
   ``Most of the people we've talked to haven't committed to moving
out of Gainesville,'' said Admissions Director Vicki Ahrens.
``They're checking out alternatives.''
   Florida International University in Miami and Florida Atlantic
University in Boca Raton reported about 50 inquiries each, and a
handful of registrations.

   The two Germanys pledged Thursday to
nearly halve the troop strengths of a united Germany.
   The commitment, made in a rare open plenary session of East-West
talks on reducing conventional forces in Europe, formalized an
agreement by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the Soviet Union in July.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said his
government ``commits itself to reduce the personnel strength of the
armed forces of the united Germany to 370,000 within three to four
years.''
   Genscher was joined in his presentation at the negotiations by
East German Premier Lothar de Maziere.
   De Maziere said his government was ``in full agreement'' with
Genscher. He said the armed forces of a united Germany would be
slightly more than half of the current total of more than 600,000.
He said the number of tanks and other weapons systems would also be
reduced by about 50 percent.
   Also Thursday, the two Germanys agreed on measures to guard
against potential blackmailers gaining access to sensitive
documents compiled by East Germany's secret police.
   The issue had threatened to block a proposed treaty laying the
legal foundations of German unity.
   Kohl's government said both Germanys would sign the unification
treaty Friday in West Berlin, clearing the way for formal
unification on Oct. 3.
   However, officials from the two Germanys and West German
opposition leaders were holding meetings in Bonn trying to resolve
their differences on the draft treaty.
   Another obstacle to full political agreement on the treaty _
abortion rights in a united Germany _ has not yet been resolved.
   The secret police compiled files on the private lives of
millions of East Germans to help the former communist government
maintain its iron grip on the nation.
   Angry East German lawmakers in East Berlin threatened to veto
the treaty if 6 million secret police files were sent to a West
German government archive in Koblenz, as was initially foreseen in
the treaty.
   Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble and East Germany's top
unity negotiator, Guenther Krause, agreed an all-German Parliament
should decide how to keep the documents in safety, said Schaeuble's
spokesman, Roland Bachmeier.
   Approval of the unification treaty is not essential for
unification, but leaders of both nations have said it is imperative
that they negotiate a treaty and not simply allow West German law
to take effect automatically in East Germany.
   On the weapons statements, the chief Soviet delegate at the
Vienna talks, Oleg A. Grinevsky, told reporters they ``are an
encouraging sign of interest in the Vienna talks, not only on the
part of the governments of the two German states but also, in the
future, of a united Germany.''
   Representatives of the 16 NATO and seven Warsaw Pact countries
are trying to finish a treaty on reducing numbers of troops, tanks
and armaments in Europe in time to be signed at a summit of 35
nations in Paris on Nov. 19.
   Genscher said two unresolved problems still need to be
addressed. He said these were the limitation of aircraft and the
so-called sufficiency rule which would limit the number of troops
and armaments each country could have within the overall
restrictions for each side.
   Grinevsky proposed a collective ceiling for each side in Central
Europe be set at 4,000-4,500 tanks, up to 6,000 armored combat
vehicles and 3,500 artillery pieces. The two sides have agreed to
an overall ceiling of 20,000 tanks for each.

   A lawyer for a comatose woman asked a
state court Thursday to allow removal of her life support system,
citing new evidence that she wouldn't want to continue living in
her condition.
   The petition filed with Jasper County Probate Judge Charles Teel
said three witnesses have come forth ``who had specific discussions
with Nancy Cruzan regarding her wishes about life-sustaining
medical treatment.''
   In July, the U.S. Supreme Court barred the removal of Ms.
Cruzan's life-sustaining feeding tube in its first ruling in a
``right-to-die'' case.
   The nation's highest court said a state's interest in preserving
life may overcome the wishes of family members seeking to end the
life of a patient in an irreversible, coma-like condition.
   Her parents, Joe and Joyce Cruzan of Carterville in southwest
Missouri, fought to have a surgically implanted tube removed from
their 33-year-old daughter.
   Ms. Cruzan has been in a persistent vegetative state since a
January 1983 car crash, and is kept alive at the Missouri
Rehabilitation Center in Mount Vernon.
   In an interview from his Carterville home, Joe Cruzan said he
was ``about as optimistic as I can allow myself to be given the
pace of the legal system.''
   ``I don't know where it's going to end. I hope we're successful.
I gave up being enthusiastic a long time ago, when I learned the
legal system doesn't work very fast,'' he said.
   In the petition, attorney Bill Colby of Kansas City noted that
the Supreme Court ruled ``the discovery of new evidence regarding
the patient's intent'' could allow for modification or reversal of
the ban on removing her feeding tube.
   The petition said the court ruled that Missouri can require
``clear and convincing'' evidence as a legal standard of proof of
Ms. Cruzan's wishes before medical treatment is terminated.
   Colby declined in an interview to reveal the identities of the
three people, other than to say two were people Ms. Cruzan had
worked for and the third was a co-worker.
   Missouri Attorney General William Webster, who handled the
state's challenges to the Cruzan family, had no immediate comment
on the filing, said his spokeswoman, Mary Jenkins.

   The military has confined to barracks a corporal
who went on a hunger strike and refused deployment with his unit
because he opposes U.S. involvement in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Cpl. Jeffrey Paterson, 22, refused to leave with members of his
unit, part of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Brigade, when it was
deployed to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, said Staff Sgt. Christopher
Grey, a public affairs officer at Kaneohe Marine Corps Air Station.
   No charges have been filed against Paterson, Grey said. He was
confined to his barracks area and could face charges of disobeying
lawful orders and missing movement, he said.
   Eric Seitz, attorney for Paterson, said he was unable to contact
his client Thursday. He charged Marine officials with unlawfully
restricting access to Paterson, and said military officials were
deliberately going out of their way to ``precipitate a
confrontation.''
   Paterson, of Hollister, Calif., filed for conscientious objector
status Aug. 17, citing his opposition to U.S. ``interventionist''
policy in the Middle East.
   He has been on a hunger strike since Aug. 24 to draw attention
to his situation.
   A preliminary recommendation issued Wednesday said Paterson's
request for conscientious objector status should be denied. A final
decision on the reqeust will be made by the Office of the
Commandant of the Marine Corps, a base spokesman, Capt. Leonard
Ryan, said earlier in the week.
   Seitz said he expects the request to be denied, and will seek an
appeal in federal court if it is.
   In the preliminary recommendation, an investigating officer said
that while he concluded that Paterson's position was sincere, it
was based on political _ and not moral _ considerations.
   ``He has read a few books, talked with some people who
influenced him and now burns with the zeal of the convert,'' the
recommendation read.
   The Committee to Defend Jeff Paterson, a group of local peace
activists who have taken up Paterson's cause, called Paterson's
strike a victory because it kept him from going to the Mideast
against his will.
   ``He has successfully carried through on his promise to fight
this war,'' the group said in a written statement.
   On Tuesday, Lance Cpl. Eric Glen Larsen of the 4th Light
Anti-Aircraft Missile Battalion at Hayward, Calif., became the
second soldier to officially file for conscientious objector status
to avoid Persian Gulf duty. Larsen cited his religious beliefs.

<HEAD>Wayne Newton's $5.2 Million Libel Award Overturned</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court on Thursday
overturned Wayne Newton's record $5.2 million libel judgment and
dismissed his lawsuit over an NBC broadcast that suggested ties to
the mob.
   A jury in Las Vegas found that the television network's October
1980 story created a false impression that the Mafia had helped the
singer buy the Aladdin Hotel-Casino in exchange for a hidden share
and that Newton had deceived Nevada gaming officials.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals did not say whether the
story as a whole was false but said any false impressions were not
the result of the kind of journalistic misconduct required for
libel suits by public figures.
   Under U.S. Supreme Court standards, public figures must prove
that defamatory statements were either deliberate falsehoods or
reckless, made in disregard of the truth. The court said the
evidence failed to support the jury's finding that the NBC
broadcast met that standard.
   The 3-0 ruling said most of the broadcast's factual statements
were true: Newton had a friend with purported mob ties who had done
him a favor, and had then talked with an associate about the
possibility of profiting from Newton's ownership of the Aladdin; a
federal grand jury had investigated that subject, and Newton had
testified falsely to the Nevada Gaming Board.
   Although the broadcast did not specify the favor that had been
done for Newton _ according to Newton, getting a criminal
organization to stop threatening him and his daughter _ the court
said the omission was not libelous. The reporters had reason to
doubt the story of the threats, which had been denied by Newton's
lawyer in Newton's presence, the court said.
   The jury awarded Newton $19.3 million. U.S. District Judge Myron
Crocker reduced the damages to $5.2 million, mostly in punitive
damages, after finding that Newton's income and reputation had not
suffered; it was still the largest libel judgment up to that time.
   Among the reasons NBC gave for challenging the verdict was
Crocker's refusal to transfer the trial out of Las Vegas, where an
annual Wayne Newton Day is celebrated and a street is named after
him.
   The court did not rule on that issue but said the location of
the trial was a reason to scrutinize the jury verdict closely.
   ``Wayne Newton's case poses the danger that First Amendment
values will be subverted by a local jury biased in favor of a
prominent local public figure against an alien speaker who
criticizes that local hero,'' said the opinion by Judge William
Norris.
   ``I don't think this decision would have been rendered any place
in the country other than in Las Vegas,'' Floyd Abrams, a prominent
libel lawyer representing NBC, said Thursday. ``I don't think the
jury was as much biased against NBC as it was prone to support
Wayne Newton.''
   NBC News President Michael Gartner called the ruling ``a sound
victory for investigative journalism.''
   Newton's lawyer, Morton Galane, said he would not comment until
he could reach Newton.

   More than 200 women and children who had
been held hostage at strategic Iraqi sites were taken to a Baghdad
hotel Thursday in preparation for leaving Iraq.
   No exit visas were expected before Saturday because Friday is
the Moslem sabbath and government offices are closed.
   Iraqi officials denied reports that the hostages were being
detained in exchange for food and medicine to ease effects from the
U.N. embargo of Iraq.
   The United Nations imposed sanctions to force Iraq to withdraw
from Kuwait, and the United States has led a multinational force
buildup in Saudi Arabia aimed at discouraging any move by Iraq to
seize any more territory.
   President Bush told a news conference in Washington Thursday he
will not allow the presence of the roughly 3,000 Americans in Iraq
and Kuwait to influence his decisions on the Persian Gulf crisis.
   In London, the British Foreign Office said Thursday that Iraq
was arranging to evacuate some British women and children from
Baghdad aboard Iraqi Airways, and Virgin Atlantic Airways said it
had Iraqi permission to pick up more evacuees.
   The foreigners at the hotel, mostly from the United States,
Britain, France, Japan and Australia, said government officials
told them they could leave after documents are completed _ probably
this weekend or early next week.
   Earlier, government officials said 237 of the foreign women and
children ``guests'' asked for exit visas to leave the country. They
said 28 asked to remain.
   The foreigners included 68 Japanese, but breakdowns of other
nationalities were not available. It was not clear how many of the
estimated 21,000 Westerners stranded since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug.
2 will be allowed to leave.
   Most of those at Menia Hotel in Baghdad told an Associated Press
reporter they were treated well at the military and economically
strategic places where they were taken. Iraq shipped them there to
discourage an attack. Almost all were taken from Kuwait, where the
women were working before the invasion.
   ``I'm happy that it's now all over,'' said Elizabeth Linoff, 50,
an American teacher. She said she was teaching English in
Casablanca, Morocco, and was on her way from France to Malaysia at
the time of the 2 invasion. Her British Airways flight was not
allowed to continue the journey.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said this week that women and
children, held along with Western men to shield his country from
attack, would be allowed to travel beginning Wednesday.
   Diplomats in Baghdad, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Thursday the government has refused to allow foreign airlines to
land in the Iraqi capital to evacuate Western women and children
unless they carry food and medicines.
   Otherwise, the evacuees would have to travel in convoys
overland, most likely to the Turkish border, 375 miles north of
Baghdad, they said.
   Iraq's ambassador in Washington, Mohamed al-Mashat, told
reporters there Thursday, ``It is absolutely not true. I
categorically deny that.''
   Officials in Baghdad also denied the reports.
   Kim Hepworth of Sydney, Australia, who taught English in a
private school in Kuwait, told reporters she was caught in a
roundup by Iraqi soldiers two weeks after the invasion as she and
other Australians searched for food in Kuwait City.
   They were first taken to Baghdad and then to a military site
which she said she could not identify.
   She said she and others were treated well.
   The foreigners said they did not know if they would leave by air
or by bus. Iraqi officials said that would be decided when their
exit visas are granted.
   Karen Taylor said she was held with other Britons at a site 300
miles from Baghdad.
   ``We were treated well but some children were sick and were
treated by Iraqi doctors,'' she said. ``We were given what we
needed.''
   Diplomats said the 28 who wished to remain were mostly those
with government contracts or those with businesses in Iraq.
   In Habur, Turkey, two foreigners who fled from Iraq on Thursday
reported seeing lines for food in Iraqi cities during their journey.
   ``There were long lines in front of bakeries and grocery shops
in Baghdad and Mosul and all other major towns and cities on our
way over here,'' said Zdenek Stradal, a Czechoslovak civil engineer.
   He and Vratislav Skvor, another engineer from Prague, drove from
Badghad to Habur, a border post in southeastern Turkey where
thousands of foreigners have been arriving following the invasion
of Kuwait.
   In Helsinki, the capital of Finland, Foreign Ministry officials
said Thursday that Finnish women were given permission to leave
Iraq immediately.
   Finnish national radio reported that 17-year-old Matsida
Suleiman, who was in Baghdad to visit her Iraqi father, flew
Thursday to Amman, Jordan, after trying two weeks to obtain an exit
visa and also told of a shortage of basic foodstuffs in Baghdad,
including sugar, rice and bread.

<HEAD>U.N. Panel Tells Iraq to Free Foreigners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. human rights panel Thursday urged Iraq to
let all foreigners leave and proposed sending an investigator there
to look into alleged abuses.
   American panel member William Treat requested stronger language
condemning Iraq's treatment of foreigners and diplomats in Iraq and
occupied Kuwait.
   ``Never in recorded history has there been such an international
expression of revulsion and repugnance,'' he said.
   In a resolution adopted 19-4, the panel asked the U.N. Human
Rights Commission for the first time to consider sending a special
investigator to Iraq.
   It voiced concern at reports that hundreds of exiled opponents
of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein were arrested in Kuwait after his
Aug. 2 invasion.
   It also expressed concern over allegations of mass executions,
arbitrary detention and disappearances, and over Iraq's treatment
of the Kurdish population. Iraq has reportedly used chemical
weapons on Kurdish civilians.
   The panel, known as the Subcommission on Prevention of
Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, includes members from
around the world who are intended to serve as independent experts.
They report to the 43 government representatives on the Human
Rights Commission that examines abuses worldwide.
   Cuban panel member Alfonso Martinez criticized the text adopted
Thursday as ``totally unbalanced.''
   Fatma Ksentini of Algeria, another member, said criticism of
Iraq would merely ``throw oil into the fire'' of the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   The U.N. Security Council has condemned the Iraqi invasion,
ordered an economic embargo on that country and demanded that
Baghdad let all foreigners leave.

   Iraq was arranging Thursday to evacuate some
British women and children from Baghdad aboard Iraqi Airways, the
Foreign Office said, and Virgin Atlantic Airways said it had Iraqi
permission to pick up more evacuees.
   Virgin Atlantic said that contrary to reports from diplomats in
Iraq, it was not told to bring food and supplies to Baghdad before
it could evacuate Britons.
   The Foreign Office said Iraq was arranging to fly Britons,
possibly 132 women and children, direct to London but no time or
date had been specified.
   The department spokesman said, ``Exit visas for this flight are
being arranged.'' But he added: ``No exit visas have been issued
for any subsequent flights.''
   An estimated 4,500 Britons were caught in Iraq and Kuwait when
Iraq invaded its oil-rich neighbor Aug. 2. About 3,000 Americans
were among the estimated 21,000 Westerners trapped in Iraq and
Iraqi-occupied Kuwait.
   It was not clear how many of the Westerners will be allowed to
travel.
   British Airways was standing by to remove up to five aircraft
from scheduled services to help with any airlift from Iraq.
   Virgin Atlantic's chairman, Richard Branson, said Iraqi
authorities approved his airline's plans to fly to Baghdad on
Friday to evacuate at least 140 women and children.
   He originally set the departure for 2 a.m. but later said: ``The
Foreign Office has asked that we are ready to leave later
tomorrow.''
   He said the permission that Virgin Atlantic has from the Iraqis
lasts 24 hours. He said he was confident the Iraqis would abide by
the agreed plan.
   ``The impression we have, having talked to various Iraqi
ambassadors, is that Saddam Hussein is very serious about letting
women and children go.
   ``He wants to make a gesture and we believe he won't want to
spoil the gesture by doing anything foolish,'' he said.
   The Boeing 747 planned for the flight could carry up to 350
passengers.
   Asked about reports that Iraq would insist any foreign planes
landing in Baghdad for the evacuation bring food and supplies,
Virgin Atlantic spokesman Will Whitehorn said he never heard a word
about that from either side.
   The Iraqi Embassy in London denied the reports, conveyed by
diplomats in Baghdad who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Saddam, the Iraqi president, said this week that women and
children interned along with Western men to shield Iraq from attack
will be allowed to leave.
   Earlier Thursday the government said 32 more British citizens
had been rounded up in Kuwait, while its embassy in Baghdad has
begun handling paperwork to send women and children home.
   A Foreign Office spokesman said some passports had been
collected in Baghdad, but the advice to British nationals still in
Kuwait remained that they should keep a low profile.
   ``The situation in Kuwait is rather complicated by the fact that
it is impossible for people to come to us and hand in their
passports,'' the spokesman said.
   He said 197 British citizens were known to have been taken into
custody in Kuwait.
   The British ambassador in Kuwait, Harold Walker, was still
seeking details from Iraq's Foreign Ministry on how the evacuation
would be organized, said a spokesman, who briefed reporters on
condition of anonymity.
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd told BBC radio he doubted Saddam
could hold on to power if he complied with U.N. resolutions
demanding a withdrawal from Kuwait. But he said he believed ``a
reasonable chance'' existed that economic sanctions would achieve
U.N. objectives without resort to force.

   Five state lawmakers were released on
$25,000 personal recognizance bonds Thursday after a brief
arraignment on federal charges of selling their votes in the
General Assembly.
   State Sen. Rick Lee, and state Reps. Robert Brown, Danny
Winstead, Robert Kohn, and Luther Taylor each pleaded innocent in
the appearance before U.S. Magistrate Charles Gambrell.
   The five are charged with violating the Hobbs Act, a federal law
banning acceptance of money or gifts in return for votes or favors.
Taylor was indicted on six counts and the other four were charged
with one count each.
   According to legal procedure, a guilty plea can only be entered
when the lawmakers appear later before a federal judge. Lee alone
has said he plans a guilty plea. He is to appear in court Sept. 10.
   U.S. Attorney Bart Daniel said he did not know when the next
court hearings would be held for the other lawmakers. They refused
to speak with reporters after the hearing.
   The lawmakers were indicted last week after a 16-month
investigation of corruption at the Statehouse involving an FBI
sting operationg, authorities said. The five are accused of
accepting cash payments for their support of a pari-mutuel betting
bill.
   Daniel has said he expected more indictments in the coming
months.
   After the indictments were issued, House Speaker Bob Sheheen, in
accordance with House rules, suspended Taylor and Kohn. Brown and
Winstead resigned prior to the indictments and Lee quit three days
after being indicted.
   Conviction under the Hobbs Act carries a maximum 25 years in
prison and a $250,000 fine. Taylor faces a maximum sentence of 120
years in prison and a $1.5 million fine if convicted.
   Winstead also was charged with obstruction of justice, which
carries a sentence of 10 years in prison and $250,000 in fines.

<TEXT>
   President Bush called on wealthy allies
Thursday to share the huge expense of America's military buildup in
the Persian Gulf, declaring that a ``new world order'' could emerge
from the Middle East crisis.
   ``Anyone with a stake in international order has an interest in
ensuring that all of us succeed,'' the president said.
   Bush, at a news conference dominated by questions on the gulf
situation, was asked if he might hold back on possible military
action for fear of harming some of the thousands of hostages held
by Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
   He said he was concerned about them but that their fate could
not be allowed ``to shape the foreign policy of this country.''
   The president said, ``I'm not optimistic'' about chances for a
diplomatic settlement with Iraq. However, he said the situation in
the Persian Gulf now appeared ``relatively stable.''
   Bush met with reporters at the White House before returning to
Maine for the last five days of a 3{ week vacation clouded _ and
several times interrupted _ by tensions over Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait and its threat to the oil fields of Saudi Arabia. The
president said he was not bothered by criticism that he was golfing
and fishing while American troops went overseas toward a possible
war.
   Roughly 60,000 U.S. combat troops have moved to battle stations
in the gulf in the past three weeks and their number is expected to
reach 100,000 soon. The Pentagon estimates the deployment is
costing $1 billion a month.
   ``It is important that the considerable burden of the effort be
shared by those being defended and those who benefit from the free
flow of oil,'' Bush said.
   He singled out Japan, West Germany, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the
United Arab Emirates and South Korea as nations that would be asked
for contributions.
   Early Thursday evening, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said Bush talked by telephone with West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, United Arab Emirates
president Sheik Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, Turkish President
Turgut Ozal and the Kuwaiti emir, Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, to
discuss his proposed aid program.
   Fitzwater said Bush discussed ``the needs some countries have,
what kind of resources will be provided.''
   Bush said money was needed to help defray military costs and to
assist nations suffering from the United Nations embargo against
Iraq. He cited Turkey and Egypt, as well as Jordan which has
absorbed tens of thousands of refugees from Iraq, and nations of
Eastern Europe.
   The president declined to say how much money he wanted to raise.
Administration officials, speaking privately, said Bush wanted
about $12 billion in the first year to cover military costs.
   ``Clearly it will have some budget implications,'' Bush said of
U.S. costs, adding, ``I don't feel the answer is a war tax'' at
home.
   Bush said the stakes in the gulf were ``truly significant: the
dependability of America's commitments to its friends and allies,
the shape of the post-postwar world, opposition to aggression, the
potential domination of the energy resources that are crucial to
the entire world.''
   The crisis has resulted in an unprecedented display of
U.S.-Soviet cooperation in dealing with a major trouble spot.
Moreover, it has triggered a rare occasion of the five permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council acting in concert trying to
keep the peace.
   ``As I look at the countries that are chipping in here now,''
Bush said, ``I think we do have a chance at a new world order. And
I'd like to think that out of this dreary performance by Saddam
Hussein there could be an opportunity for peace all through the
Middle East.''
   Bush said he was sending Secretary of State James A. Baker III
and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady to the Persian Gulf, Europe
and Asia. He said nations would be asked ``to join us in making
available financial and, where appropriate, energy resources to
countries that have been most affected.''
   Money will be sought in accordance with an economic assistance
plan drafted by the National Security Council and approved by Bush.
   The president said that international funding of the American
force would not make the U.S. troops mercenaries.
   ``There's ways that burden sharing can be accomplished without
making the forces look like mercenaries,'' he said.
   Bush said he was not upset that Saddam has been able to express
his views on American television. But the president said he'd like
the same opportunity on Iraqi television.
   Saddam's televised appearances with foreign hostages haven't
``helped him very much with world opinion,'' Bush said. He
characterized the appearances as ``so brutal and so totally
unacceptable that it worked against him _ manipulative, cynical.''
   Bush stopped short of saying his goal was ousting Saddam from
power, but he said, ``It wouldn't disappoint me if the Iraqis got
up and said, `Look, this man is our problem.'''
   The president also said he was pleased with OPEC's decision to
``take up the slack in oil production'' created by the trade
embargo against Iraq. The oil-producing nations on Wednesday
ratified an increase in production, prompting a drop in oil prices
to the lowest point in nearly three weeks.
   Bush would not confirm directly that his administration is
supporting the Kuwaiti underground resistance. However, he said,
``In a broad way, I support the Kuwaiti underground. I support
anybody who can have a hand in restoring legitimacy there to Kuwait
and to getting the Iraqis out of Kuwait.''
   Asked whether the trade embargo hurts the Iraqi people most,
Bush said he had no fight with that nation's people but ``there's
nothing that's painless when you get into a situation like this.''
   Bush also said he's not interested in Saddam's suggestion for a
debate with Bush and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
``They can put an empty chair there as far as I'm concerned,'' he
said.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government
late Thursday salvaged a treaty that lays the legal basis for
German unity after Kohl agreed to compromises on abortion rights
and the handling of secret police files.
   The treaty will be signed Friday in East Berlin by the two
nations' interior ministers.
   Late Thursday, a Kohl aide announced the accord had been reached
with the opposition Social Democrats, or the SPD. ``We have
agreement the SPD (opposition Social Democrats) will support the
treaty,'' said Rudolf Seiters, Kohl's chief of staff.
   Kohl compromised on the treaty's two last obstacles _ abortion
rights and the handling of sensitive files collected over four
decades by East Germany's former secret police.
   West Germany's Social Democrats accepted a compromise on
abortion rights proposed by West German Interior Minister Wolfgang
Schaeuble.
   Kohl on Wednesday talked lawmakers from his coalition into
bending to the Social Democrats' demand that West German women not
be prosecuted for seeking abortions in East Germany after unity.
East Germany's abortion law is more permissive.
   Under the accord reached Thursday, the new parliament of a
unified Germany will be entrusted with adopting a new abortion law
for all of Germany by 1992.
   In addition, the two Germanys agreed on measures to guard
against potential blackmailers gaining access to sensitive
documents compiled by East Germany's once-feared ``Stasi'' secret
police.
   The secret police compiled files on the private lives of
millions of East Germans to help the former communist government
maintain its iron grip on the nation.
   Angry East German lawmakers in East Berlin threatened to veto
the treaty if 6 million secret police files were sent to a West
German government archive in Koblenz, as was initially foreseen in
the treaty.
   Schaeuble and East Germany's top unity negotiator, Guenther
Krause, agreed Thursday an all-German parliament should decide how
to keep the documents in safety, said Schaeuble's spokesman, Roland
Bachmeier.
   Passage of the treaty is not needed for German unity on Oct. 3.
But without it East Germans might get the feeling essential
elements of merging the two nations are out of their control.
   Also Thursday, the two Germanys pledged to nearly halve the
troop strengths of a united Germany.
   The commitment, made in Vienna during East-West talks on
reducing conventional forces in Europe, formalized an agreement by
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev in the Soviet Union in July.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said his
government ``commits itself to reduce the personnel strength of the
armed forces of the united Germany to 370,000 within three to four
years.''
   Genscher was joined in his presentation at the negotiations by
East German Premier Lothar de Maziere.
   De Maziere said his government was ``in full agreement'' with
Genscher. He said the armed forces of a united Germany would be
slightly more than half of the current total of more than 600,000.
He said the number of tanks and other weapons systems would also be
reduced by about 50 percent.

   A federal judge awarded $5.6 million to the
family of a man and two teen-agers who were killed when an
Aeromexico jetliner crashed into their Cerritos house in 1986, an
attorney said Thursday.
   The award Wednesday by U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon was
the first judgment involving victims of the disaster who were
killed on the ground, said Joseph Cook, the family's attorney.
   Eighty-two people, including 15 on the ground, died when the
Aeromexico DC-9 collided with a small plane and smashed into a
residential neighborhood Aug. 31, 1986. It was the worst air
disaster in Los Angeles-area history.
   Frank Estrada Sr., 43, his son Javier, 16, and daughter
Angelica, 14, were killed inside their home. Another teen-ager
inside the house survived.
   A jury in 1989 divided blame for the crash equally between the
United States and the pilot of the small plane. The jurors found an
air traffic controller failed to warn the pilots they were on a
collision course.
   The family, widow Theresa Estrada and two children, will receive
$2.8 million to $3 million because money already received in a
settlement with Aeromexico will be deducted, Cook said.
   Justice Department spokesman Michael W. Robinson said the
government was weighing an appeal of the award. ``We are reviewing
our options,'' he said.
   Aeromexico Flight 498 was approaching Los Angeles International
Airport when it collided with a single-engine Piper Archer plane
piloted by William Kramer of Rancho Palos Verdes.
   Mrs. Estrada was returning from the market when the crash
occurred. She arrived to find her home in ruins.
   Kenyon ruled last year that the government and Kramer's estate
must repay Aeromexico for payments to the families of passengers
killed in the crash.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Says Sovereignty Declarations Are `Major Achievement'</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Soviet-Armenia, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Thursday he
welcomes the adoption of sovereignty declarations by Soviet
republics, calling them a ``major achievement'' of his perestroika
reform program.
   Gorbachev appeared to distinguish, however, between declarations
of sovereignty, which entail greater autonomy within the Soviet
Union, and declarations of independence, which call for seceding
from the country.
   Thirteen of the Soviet Union's 15 constituent republics have
made some moves toward greater autonomy.
   Eight have declared sovereignty, or the right to overturn Soviet
laws on their territory. They are Russia, the largest repubic; the
Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Byelorussia, Moldavia, Uzbekistan,
Tadzhikistan and Turkmenia.
   Five have moved toward independence, but only one _ Lithuania _
has declared itself immediately independent of the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev has condemned the Lithuanian action as a violation of
the Soviet Constitution, and he imposed a punishing economic
embargo against the republic following the March 11 decaration. The
embargo was later lifted in return for Lithuania's agreement to
suspend the declaration pending negotiations.
   The other four republics that have declared independence _
Latvia, Estonia, Georgia and Armenia _ have said they hope to break
free of the Soviet Union in the future, after transition periods or
negotiations.
   Gorbachev spoke Thursday at a joint meeting of his presidential
council and the federation council, which comprises the presidents
of all the republics.
   The Soviet press agency Tass quoted him as saying that the
sovereignty declarations are ``a major achievement of perestroika
and a serious prerequisite for a union of sovereign states,
cooperation and friendship of Soviet peoples.''
   Gorbachev has been pushing for a new treaty between all the
republics that will preserve the Soviet Union. But he has been
faced by nationalist demonstrations and violence in several
regions, including Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia.
   He warned that the moves toward sovereignty ``are sometimes
accompanied by destructive actions'' that hurt the economy, and he
appealed for peace.
   ``We describe, with reason, perestroika as a revolution, but
this is a peaceful revolution, which is being conducted within the
framework of law and through a chain of far-reaching structural
reforms,'' he said.
   ``The greatest achievement of perestroika is that in such a vast
country with a complicated history and present-day problems, these
transformations, on the whole, are proceeding within the framework
of peacefu reforms. And this should be preserved.''
   Perestroika is the term used for Gorbachev's restructuring of
Soviet society and opening of its centrally planned econony to some
market forces.

   Biology teacher Stephen Hunt died when a
tornado grabbed a truck in front of Plainfield High School and
dropped it onto the second floor of the science department, where
he worked.
   Only rooms away, business teacher Linda Kinnikin survived
unscathed.
   Behind the school, which was demolished, the twister leveled
Shirley and Gene Fassiotto's home, plucking their car from a now
nonexistent garage and depositing it upside down where the living
room once stood.
   Across the street, Lois Moffitt's brick ranch-style house still
stands.
   The capriciousness of the tornadoes that spun across northern
Illinois on Tuesday is painfully obvious to the survivors of the
storms.
   ``They say tornadoes touch down and jump all over the place,''
Mrs. Kinnikin said, shaking her head Wednesday as she examined the
rubble that killed her colleague.
   ``In a matter of a minute's time, it all changed,'' she said.
   The death toll climbed to 27 Thursday when a 3-year-old girl and
16-year-old boy died of injuries they suffered in the storms. More
than 300 people were injured.
   Hunt had been talking with Mrs. Kinnikin only a few minutes
before the tornado hit.
   ``He was a dedicated teacher,'' Mrs. Kinnikin said softly, her
eyes brimming with tears.
   Asked how she survived, she shook her head.
   ``I heard so much debris hitting the windows of the building,''
she recalled. ``There was no visibility because the rain was coming
down so hard.
   ``And when the window blew, I took off running for the men's
bathroom. My department chair and I huddled together in the men's
bathroom. I said `Oh, my God' three times, and it was over.''
   When she climbed out of the rubble, she saw the walls in ruins,
the roof blown off, and smashed cars in the parking lot thrown into
a heap.
   At least two dozen people died in the tornadoes that hit Joliet,
Crest Hill and Plainfield, about 35 miles southwest of Chicago.
   The twisters left more than 1,000 homes uninhabitable and caused
over $100 million in damage. The region has been declared a state
and federal disaster area.
   And the random misfortunes didn't necessarily stop when the
storms left. On Thursday, a truck serving as a mobile kitchen for
relief workers exploded and caught fire in Joliet, injuring four
people, one critically.
   Authorities said a propane tank overflowed while being loaded
and the fuel was ignited by a flame from a stove.
   Three people died on the Plainfield school grounds during the
storm, including Hunt.
   Bruch Reed, 15, said Hunt had like been like a second father to
him.
   ``I've done so much thinking about the people who died,'' said
Reed, who was at a park a few blocks away when the storm hit and
who was unhurt.
   ``I suppose we should'' feel guilty, ``not just because I
survived, but because my house was untouched,'' Reed said.
   ``You always think it doesn't happen, and won't happen to you,''
he said. ``It doesn't matter who you are or where you are, it can
happen.''
   Shirley Fassiotto knows. Her home was reduced to boards, bricks
and plaster strewn about the lot.
   ``We had just gotten to the basement when the walls came down,''
she said.
   Glancing across the street at Mrs. Moffitt's home, she added:
``You wonder. ... She just missed the path (of the twister), who
knows how.''
   ``It doesn't matter what kind of house you have or where you're
situated, the path is so erratic,'' said Mrs. Moffitt, who was
visiting a daughter in Joliet when the storm hit. Windows in her
home were shattered, and the roof was slightly damaged.
   Across the street and down a few houses, Don Erikson, 60, was
less lucky. He was looking out his living room picture window when
the storm hit.
   The tornado drove chunks of glass into his body and threw him
onto the couch. It also tossed his furniture around like toys and
blew off the roof _ but left several paper cups sitting on a
counter.
   Erikson was in fair condition Thursday at a Joliet hospital.
``He lost a lot of blood,'' said his son, Jeff Erikson, 30.

<HEAD>Gustav Picks Up Strength, Likely to Bypass Bermuda</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Gustav whipped up 110 mph winds Thursday
in the open Atlantic, but forecasters said the likelihbood it would
draw near Bermuda had diminished.
   ``This has been its most intense in its life, so far,'' said Max
Mayfield, hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center in
suburban Coral Gables. ``The good news is still that it's moving
north, which if it continues on that track, would keep it east of
Bermuda.''
   Gustav strengthened Thursday after weakening to 80 mph Wednesday
morning.
   At 6 p.m. EDT, the center was located near 28.5 degrees north
latitude and 57.7 west longitude, or about 500 miles southeast of
Bermuda. It was moving at 14 mph and was expected to later make a
turn toward the northeast.
   Little change in strength was likely over the next day,
according to the hurricane center.
   If it continued its northward trek, Gustav would pass more than
300 miles east of Bermuda, the only landfall facing a possible
threat, Mayfield said. A shift to the northeast would take it even
further from the west Atlantic islands, he said.
   A tropical storm becomes a hurricane when winds reach 74 mph or
more. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June through November.

   Hope strengthened Thursday that foreign women and children may
soon get their promised safe passage from Iraq, and on the
diplomatic front, the U.N. secretary-general arrived in Jordan to
try to mediate the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The crisis entered its fifth week Friday, with the United States
pushing hard for a strong hand in its confrontation with Iraq's
Saddam Hussein.
   The U.N. chief, Javier Perez de Cuellar, expressed optimism for
a peaceful settlement following Iraq's Aug. 2 takeover of Kuwait,
its small, oil-rich neighbor, but he warned that the situation in
the region was ``explosive.''
   President Bush said he was soliciting funds from other nations
to help defray the cost of America's $1 billion-a-month military
buildup in the gulf, and singled out Japan, West Germany, Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and South Korea.
   Bush said a ``new world order'' could emerge from the crisis,
and ``anyone with a stake in international order has an interest in
ensuring that all of us succeed.''
   He told a news conference he was concerned about the thousands
of hostages in Iraq, but said their fate could not be allowed to
shape U.S. foreign policy.
   More than 200 women and children gathered at Baghdad's Menia
Hotel Thursday in preparation for leaving Iraq.Some had been held
at strategic Iraqi sites, to head off attack from the U.S.-led
multinational force in Saudi Arabia. No exit visas were expected
before Saturday because Friday is the Moslem sabbath..
   Iraq denied reports it sought food and medicine in exchange for
hostages to ease effects from the punitive U.N. embargo of Iraq.
   In London, the Foreign Office said Iraq was arranging Thursday
to evacuate some British women and children from Baghdad aboard
Iraqi Airways, and Virgin Atlantic Airways said it had Iraqi
permission to pick up more evacuees.
   Karen Taylor said at the hotel she was held with other Britons
at a site 300 miles from Baghdad _ ``We were treated well but some
children were sick.'' Most of the foreigners at the hotel were from
the United States, Britain, France, Japan and Australia. Government
officials told them they could leave after documents are completed
_ probably this weekend or early next week.
   Iraq had said foreign women and children would be allowed to
leave beginning Wednesday. But State Department spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler said no exit permits were issued to Americans.
   Ms. Tutwiler said Iraqi authorities were insisting on a variety
of arcane paperwork.
   ``This emotional roller coaster is inhumane and disgraceful,''
the spokeswoman said.
   The State Department has said about one-third of the 3,000
Americans who have been barred from leaving Iraq and Kuwait are
women or children age 18 and under. The Americans are among about
21,000 Westerners trapped since Iraq took over Kuwait.
   While the families and friends of hostages hoped for a
homecoming, U.S. soldiers' loved ones were saying their goodbyes.
In rural Allendale, S.C., a town of 4,500 about 80 miles south of
Columbia, Ima Jean Rooker fought tears as she prepared to see off
her son James, an Army guardsman who turned 20 this month.
   ``I just wish that it didn't have to happen like this, that
things could have been settled through negotiations,'' she said.
   Talks were under way on several fronts.
   Perez de Cuellar, arriving in the Jordanian capital of Amman for
talks Friday with Iraq's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, told
reporters: ``I believe that the government of Iraq is as eager as
we all are to find a just and lasting solution of the problem.''
   The U.N. chief said the discussions would be within the
framework of a series of U.N. resolutions passed since the
invasion. Those resolutions included demands for an Iraqi
withdrawal from Kuwait and the imposition of economic sanctions
against Baghdad.
   In Cairo, the Arab League convened an emergency meeting
Thursday. But only 13 of its 21 member states were represented,
reflecting the Arab world's deep divisions over the crisis.
   Egypt, Syria and Morocco have since sent contingents to Saudi
Arabia, where tens of thousands of U.S. troops are deployed.
   Moscow, meanwhile, indicated it considered Arab action the key
to resolving the crisis. Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze sent an urgent message to his Arab counterparts urging
them to work together ``at a critical moment'' to prevent war, Tass
reported Thursday.
   Jordan's King Hussein, in Madrid, said he believed there had
been a slight easing of tensions in the region. ``I believe that
we've halted . . . this very dangerous rapid escalation. I hope
that is the case,'' the monarch said. But he said war was still a
threat.
   The huge military buildup on both sides served to keep tensions
high. In addition to troops on the ground, 27 American warships are
patrolling the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Sea and the Red Sea,
military sources said Thursday.
   The warships have intercepted about 170 ships and boarded at
least 10 in the gulf and Red Sea in the two weeks since Bush
authorized the use of naval force to halt the flow of supplies to
Iraq, the sources said.
   Jordan's ambassador to the United States warned Thursday that
U.S. military presence will radicalize the region and ``endanger
the existing Arab political order.''
   Ambassador Hussein Hammami, speaking at the National Press Club
in Washington, also said a settlement to the crisis must be linked
to resolution of the Palestinian problem and the Arab conflict with
Israel.
   In other developments Thursday:
   _The commander of Iraq's air force said in event of war his
country would strike not just Saudi Arabia but also Israel, the
Iraqi News Agency reported. The news agency, monitored in Nicosia,
did not identify the commander by name but quoted him as saying:
``We don't boast that our rockets and air force will reach the
White House, but should war break out, they are certainly capable
of . . . dealing smashing blows to the nests of the Israelis.''
   _An American man of Indian origin and a 17-year-old British girl
of Arab extraction were among 185 evacuees who flew into Jordan on
an Iraqi Airways flight. The American, J.N. Sharma of Idaho Falls,
Idaho, said he slipped out of Iraq after lying about his
nationality. In occupied Kuwait, he said, ``I stayed in hiding like
a rat, eating nothing but rice and lentils.''
   The British girl, May Barakat, said she was on vacation in Iraq
with friends when the Iraqis invaded Kuwait.
   _A Finnish teen-ager who has an Iraqi father flew to Jordan,
Finnish officials said. The girl, 17-year-old Matsida Suleiman,
described long food lines and a heavy military presence in the
Iraqi capital.
   _Ninety-one Iraqi diplomats and dependents expelled from the
United States left the country on a flight for Amman, Jordan. The
State Department ordered Iraq to reduce its embassy staff in
response to Iraq's order to close the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait. The
United States defied the order.
   _Five new reserve units have been called to active duty to boost
transport and public affairs activities in Operation Desert Shield,
Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Thursday. He said that in
all, about 8,870 members of reserve units have been called in the
first wave of notifications.

<HEAD>Low Blood Bank Supplies Force Officials To Seek New Donors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blood supplies here have dipped
radically since soldiers from the Twentynine Palms Marine Corps
base departed for the Persian Gulf.
   ``With a major holiday coming up, we don't know what's going to
happen,'' said Janelle Singleton, a nurse with the Community Blood
Bank Centers in Banning and Rancho Mirage. ``People are going to
have to bone up and become patriotic and donate blood.''
   Base soldiers typically contribute over a third of the donations
collected in the desert communities, where supplies are down about
400 pints a month, blood bank officials said Wednesday.
   Some military units, such as those stationed at Twentynine Palms
Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center, offer soldiers half-day off
incentives for donating blood, said Staff Sgt. Chuck DeMar.
   But since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, many of the
troops in training at Twentynine Palms have been deployed to the
Middle East.
   Military bases are traditional sources of blood donors, said
Rosemarie Tessier, director of public relations for the Community
Blood Bank.
   Tessier said she had talked with local service clubs about the
shortage and had written letters to churches asking for donors.
   ``If we don't have it on our shelves, we have to purchase it,''
Tessier said of the blood. ``Going into the long weekend, a lot (of
blood banks) won't want to let any go.''
   Not all blood banks have been hurt by the deployment of troops.
Officials in Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego counties said they
do not expect to experience any serious blood shortages.
   Elsewhere in Riverside County and in neighboring San Bernardino
County, blood donations have decreased 3 percent to 5 percent, said
Paul Sautter, spokesman for The Blood Bank of San Bernardino and
Riverside Counties.
   ``We need people to pick up the slack, '' he said.

   Former President Reagan travels to the Soviet
Union, Germany, Poland and Italy next month for visits with Mikhail
Gorbachev, Lech Walesa and the pope, among others, a Reagan
spokesman said Thursday.
   Reagan and former first lady Nancy Reagan will arrive in Berlin
on Sept. 10 and return to Los Angeles 10 days later, said Reagan
spokesman Mark Weinberg. The Reagans will travel by private jet.
   After meetings with East German officials and West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Richard von Weizsaecker,
Reagan will travel to Warsaw on Sept. 14.
   The former president will address shipyard workers in Gdansk,
meet with Walesa and call on the Rev. Henryk Jankowski on Sept. 15.
   The Reagans then travel to the Soviet Union for a four-day stay
at the personal invitation of Gorbachev. Reagan will address the
Supreme Soviet, visit students at Moscow State University and tour
the Hermitage Museum in Leningrad.
   The Reagans travel to Rome on Sept. 19 and meet with Italian
leaders the following day. They conclude the trip Sept. 20 with an
audience with Pope John Paul II.
   In May, Reagan postponed his European trip on the advice of
doctors who said he should limit his activities for several weeks
because of complications from cancer surgery in 1985.
   Reagan, 79, was reported in good health after his annual
physical this week, said Weinberg.

   White House reporters thought President Bush
was ushering in a new era _ the post-post war period _ when Bush
apparently misspoke at his Thursday news conference.
   The president was listing U.S. reasons for its military
involvement in the Persian Gulf crisis, and said:
   ``What is at stake here is truly significant _ the dependability
of America's commitments to its friends and allies, the shape of
the post-post war world, opposition to aggression, the potential
domination of the energy resources that are crucial to the entire
world.''
   White House deputy spokesman Roman Popadiuk assured reporters
that Bush intended to say ``post-Cold war'' rather than ``post-post
war.'' A copy of Bush's advance statement verified that.

the group of responsibility.
   Attorney Vivian Lynch said she would file post-trial motions to
challenge the court's decision. ``These usually aren't granted and,
if not, I will appeal'' to the Nevada Supreme Court, she said.
   Ms. Lynch said she believes Washoe District Judge Jerry Carr
Whitehead, who heard the case without a jury, put too much of a
burden of proof on the plaintiffs and too little on lawyers for the
band and CBS Records.
   The families of Raymond Belknap and James Vance claimed that
subliminal messages on the 1978 album ``Stained Class'' drove the
youths to shoot themselves with shotguns two days before Christmas
1985.
   Belknap, 18, died immediately and Vance, then 20, severely
damaged himself and died three painful years later.
   Whitehead wrote that while subliminal messages did exist on the
album, they were not intentional but ``a chance combination of
sounds,'' and did not prompt the suicide pact.
   Ms. Lynch, who represented Vance's family, said the suit was a
products liability case and the judge should not have placed a
legal burden on the plaintiffs to prove that the hidden words were
meant to encourage suicide.
   Ms. Lynch said enough evidence was presented that subliminal
messages can affect behavior. Whitehead said he did not feel
scientific proof of the effect of subliminals had been offered by
the plaintiffs' expert witnesses.
   Ms. Lynch said the motions by her and Ken McKenna, the attorney
for Belknap's family, would be filed by Tuesday.
   Attorney Suellen Fulstone, who represented the band and CBS
Records, said she would comment on the motions once she had seen
them.

   Iraq's foreign minister implicitly threatened
Western countries with terrorism if they endanger Iraq, according
to a French newspaper interview.
   The conservative daily Le Figaro published the interview with
Tariq Aziz in its editions Friday. Extracts were made available to
news agencies on Thursday.
   ``We say acts of terrorism are proscribed ... (but) the Arab
people are threatened with genocide,'' Aziz was quoted as saying.
   ``If you use imperialist methods, if you threaten Iraq with your
ships and planes, then I am free of any moral obligations regarding
the French, American or British governments.''
   U.S., French and British warships are helping enforce a U.N.
embargo against Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
   France meanwhile stepped up security at its international
airports because of the Persian Gulf crisis and placed the 1,700
Iraqis living on French territory under police surveillance,
restricting the movement of 26 of them.
   The Interior Ministry said the 26 Iraqis in France for military
training or with access to ``national defense secrets'' were placed
under ``special surveillance'' in four different regions. Among the
26 were four Iraqi pilots caught last week trying to flee France,
part of a 12-man group of air force officers studying languages and
flying at the Interarmy Training Center.
   France has in the past been hit by terrorist attacks tied to its
Middle East policy, including bombings in 1986 that killed 13
people and injured nearly 200.

<HEAD>Navy Reservist Says He Was Fired Because Boss Feared Call-Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Navy reservist says he was fired after his
first day as an insurance agent because his boss feared he would be
called into active duty.
   ``He was more concerned about his company than he was about the
guys who are willing to serve ... and maybe even willing to die for
their country,'' said Mark J. Kershner, 27, a hospital corpsman
attached to the 4th Marine Medical Unit at the Naval Air Station
Atlanta.
   His boss, State Farm Insurance Agent Ron Greene, told him to go
home Monday after one day on the job, Kershner said Tuesday. He
charged that Greene did not want to waste time training him.
   ``It's really a terrible situation,'' Greene said. ``I have a
lot of respect for the military and the reserves.'' He would not
elaborate.
   Drew Hamilton, deputy regional vice president for State Farm,
said Wednesday that Greene is an independent contractor who sells
State Farm insurance. ``This agent is not an employee of State
Farm,'' he said.
   ``State Farm is in absolute compliance with the (law) ... and we
support it.''
   Firing a reservist is a violation of a federal law that covers
veterans' employment rights, according to the National Committee
for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve.
   ``You can't fire someone for being a reservist,'' said Houston
Weaver, a volunteer with Georgia's employer support committee who
investigated Kershner's complaint and passed his findings on to the
state Labor Department.
   Kershner's unit has not been activated and is not on alert.
   Greene's attorney, Reid W. Kennedy, said Wednesday he will fight
allegations that Greene violated the federal law.
   ``I'm satisfied that he has not violated any law and that
(Kershner) was not terminated because of any status he may have had
in the reserves,'' said Kennedy.
   Kennedy would not say why Greene fired Kershner.
   If Greene is found to have violated federal law, he may have to
reinstate Kershner and pay him for lost wages, said James Bishop, a
veterans program specialist for the Labor Department's Atlanta
office.
   ``I've never wanted a job as bad as I wanted this one,''
Kershner said. ``My fight isn't with State Farm; it's with Mr.
Greene. I was discriminated against and it was unfair for him to do
what he has done.''

   The Rev. Jesse Jackson met Thursday with
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz to
discuss the Persian Gulf crisis, officials said.
   Jackson, who flew to Iraq for the U.S. television show ``Inside
Edition,'' met first with Aziz, who explained to him the reasons
behind Iraq's annexation of Kuwait, said the official Iraqi News
Agency, monitored in Cyprus.
   ``Aziz explained Iraq's historical and legitimate rights in
Kuwait and President Saddam Hussein's initiative on 12th August as
being the sound foundation for reaching just and equitable
solutions for all issues from which the region suffers,
particularly the suffering of the Palestinian people,'' INA said.
   Later, a government spokesman said the U.S. civil rights leader
met with Saddam. No details of that meeting were released
immediately.
   Jackson, an unsucessful candidate for the Democractic
presidential nomination in 1988, flew to the Middle East earlier
this week seeking a peaceful solution to the crisis.
   On Aug. 12, Saddam offered to withdraw from Kuwait if Syria
pulled out of Lebanon, Israel left the Gaza Strip and West Bank and
U.S. forces withdrew from Saudi Arabia. Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug.

<HEAD>Navajos Upset Over Casting of Non-Indian in Movie</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Hollywood watchdog group for
American Indians has questioned Robert Redford's decision not to
cast an Indian actor in the leading role of a Navajo policeman in
Redford's new film.
   Lou Diamond Phillips has been selected to play Jim Chee in a
film based on New Mexico author Tony Hillerman's novel, ``The Dark
Wind.'' Redford plans to begin filming on the Navajo and Hopi
reservations Sept. 10.
   ``That's true Hollywood,'' said Ray Baldwin Louis, a high school
drama teacher in Crystal, N.M.. ``They've been coming out here for
years promising to cast Navajos in leading roles. But they always
end up with an Italian or a foreign-born.''
   Bonnie Paradise, director of the watchdog group the American
Indian Registry for the Performing Arts in Hollywood, Calif., said
she will meet with Redford and Phillips within the next three weeks.
   ``Mr. Redford has bought the (rights to several) books from Mr.
Hillerman and knowing there are other films down the line that
follows the same story line, we are concerned,'' she said. Chee
appears in many of Hillerman's mysteries.
   Ms. Paradise said that Phillips claims he is part American
Indian but has not given the registry any documentation as
requested.
   A publicity packet for ``Young Guns II,'' in which Phillips
played a Mexican-Indian, said he is part Cherokee, Filipino,
Scottish-Irish, Hawaiian and Hispanic. Phillips also played an
American Indian in the 1989 movie ``Renegades.''
   Earlier this month, Actors' Equity voted to bar white actor
Jonathan Pryce from playing the part of a Eurasian pimp in the U.S.
production of ``Miss Saigon,'' now on the London stage. But after
the producer canceled the production, which has the largest advance
ticket sales in Broadway history, the union's executive council
reversed itself.
   Sammye Meadows, the Native American liaison for Dark Wind
Productions, said Phillips was offered the contract two weeks ago.
His agent said contract negotiations remained incomplete Thursday.
   ``We would have really liked to have a Navajo actor play Jim
Chee,'' Ms. Meadows said. ``We spent enormous amounts of money
traveling to powwows . . . We didn't find the actor.''
   Some Navajos have criticized Hillerman, saying he romanticizes
Navajo culture and has no real understanding of it. But in 1987 the
author received an award from the Navajos for authentically
portraying the tribe in his works.
   ``I have a hell of lot of Navajo friends and I make them read my
stuff and they tell me when I am wrong about something,'' Hillerman
said from his home Thursday. ``That (criticism) strikes close to a
nerve . . . I am sympathetic to the issue, damn it. I know it's
important to Redford.''
   Hillerman said Redford delayed the film project at one point
because he was unsatisfied with the casting. Hillerman added that
he was not a big film fan and was unfamiliar with Phillips' work.
   A call to Redford's film development company in San Monica,
Calif., seeking comment from the director was not returned Thursday
afternoon.

<HEAD>Ariane Rocket Climaxes Comeback in New Launch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KOUROU, French Guiana (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Ariane rocket lifted two
satellites into orbit Thursday, consolidating the European
commercial program's comeback from an explosion that destroyed a
Japanese payload in February.
   The unmanned rocket blasted off from the launch pad in French
Guiana, in northeastern South America. It was the commercial
program's 38th mission but only the second since the unmanned
rocket exploded shortly after takeoff in February. Its two Japanese
communications satellites were ruined.
   ``The resumption of our launches last month has been
confirmed,'' Arianespace President Charles Bigeot said at Ariane
headquarters in Evry, France.
   The February explosion was a major setback for the Ariane
project, which has been plagued by five launch failures and costly
delays. Before the disaster, about one Ariane rocket per month had
been lifting off from Kourou.
   French media said the February explosion may have been due to
sabotage, with pieces of cloth purposely stuffed into a coolant
tube. But Arianespace, which runs the Ariane program for the
European Space Agency, said the explosion was accidental.
   On Thursday, two strap-on cylinders of liquid fuel and two of
solid fuel powered the unmanned, three-stage Ariane 44LP rocket,
the biggest in the Ariane series.
   On board were a Eutelsat 2-F1 telecommunications satellite and
Skynet 4C satellite.
   Eutelsat 2-F1 is designed to channel telephone, telex and
television communications to 600 million people in Europe, North
Africa and the Middle East. Skynet 4C will handle communications
for the British military.
   Thursday's launch marked the first since Bigeot took over
Arianespace on July 31 from Frederic d'Allest, who had headed the
program from its creation a decade ago. Arianespace is made up of a
consortium of European companies.
   The next launch is expected sometime in October, with two
American satellites aboard.
   Despite the explosion in February, Ariane dominates the
commercial rocket industry, carrying about half the world's
payloads into space. Its main private-sector competitors are the
American Titan-4 made by Martin Marietta Corp., the Atlas-Centaur
of General Dynamics, and the Delta built by McDonnell Douglas.

<HEAD>Memphis Woman Tells of Fear, Danger in Kuwait</HEAD>

   In a letter smuggled to her family, a
woman described the scene in Kuwait City: Food running out, Iraqi
soldiers everywhere, fear of death or capture.
   ``There is no way out,'' she said.
   The Aug. 21 letter from Ruthie Schaeffer Al-Khalaf, the
34-year-old American wife of a Kuwaiti Air Force major, was routed
to her family in Memphis from Kuwait through Poland, after Mrs.
Al-Khalaf's half sister escaped to that country.
   ``I hope and pray it will be over soon. I am eating very little
so there will be more for the kids,'' said Mrs. Al-Khalaf, who said
she was hiding out with her husband's relatives.
   She grew up in Memphis, and met her husband, Kazem Al-Khalaf,
while he was in the United States to study computer science at
Memphis State University. They have lived in Kuwait for 10 years
and have a girl and two boys.
   The letter tells of nights punctuated by gunfire in the streets
and of the fear of being recognized as an American.
   In the days immediately following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion, Mrs.
Al-Khalaf dressed in Arab garb to stand in line for hours at
grocery stores rapidly running out of food. But those excursions
ended when Iraq ordered foreigners to report to several Kuwait
hotels.
   ``I don't know if they will be going door to door or not,'' she
said. ``The days are running into each other and we just pray to
make it through each night.''
   Iraqi soldiers were stationed throughout the city, even grocery
stores, she said.
   ``The economic blockade already is affecting Kuwait. We are
suffering, not the Iraqis. (Saddam Hussein) is controlling every
grain of rice. Pray for us,'' she wrote in the letter.
   Mrs. Al-Khalaf said the invasion was so swift she and her
husband had no time to withdraw their money from their Kuwaiti
bank, which is now closed.
   ``They have looted and robbed this country of every valuable
they could find. Even the Iraqi women are coming and helping
themselves to the gold and dress shops,'' she said.
   Mrs. Al-Khalaf's handwritten account was addressed to her
father, Joe Schaeffer, a former Memphis car dealer who lives in
Freeport, Fla.
   She gave the letter to her sister-in-law, Ava, a Polish woman
who was taken out of Kuwait by Polish embassy officials. Ava
Al-Khalaf is married to Kazem Al-Khalaf's brother.
   The letter was undated, but Ava Al-Khalaf told Ruthie Schaeffer
Al-Khalaf's family by phone from Gdansk, Poland, that it was
written Aug. 21. She typed the letter and faxed a copy to Mrs.
Al-Khalaf's father, who faxed a copy to Memphis lawyer Tim
Schaeffer, Ruthie Schaeffer Al-Khalaf's cousin.
   Jo Buehler, Ruthie's sister, said the letter caused mixed
feelings.
   ``My fears for her safety are never ending, but I'm glad that
we've received something,'' Mrs. Buehler said. ``I'm glad to know
that she's doing all she can do to stay alive and keep her family
alive.''
   Mrs. Al-Khalaf said she considered fleeing Kuwait but heard too
many stories of refugees dying in the desert, of Iraqis planting
land mines.
   ``Driving across the desert is very dangerous as there are no
roads and it's easy to get lost,'' she said. ``Anyway, it's too
late to move in that direction. I can't risk it.''

<HEAD>TMI Study Found No Effect on Childhood Cancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BLOOD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An independent research team has
concluded there is no relation between radiation vented during the
1979 accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant and cancer
rates among children living nearby.
   The study for the Three Mile Island Public Health Fund was
released in June at the annual meeting of the American Society of
Epidemiologists. An assistant to one of the authors said the report
will be included in a broader study on TMI health effects scheduled
for release Friday.
   According to an abstract of the earlier report, the researchers
used hospital records and other data to reach their conclusions,
which appear to corroborate previous government reports that showed
no harmful health effects linked to the TMI accident.
   The abstract said the study reviewed cases within a 10-mile
radius of the plant, which is located on the Susquehanna River
about 10 miles south of Harrisburg.
   The study was compiled by Columbia University epidemiologists
Mervyn Susser and Maureen Hatch. Also collaborating on the study
was Jan Beyea, an investigator for the health fund, which was
established out of a $5 million settlement of a 1981 class-action
lawsuit against the owners of TMI. A fourth author was listed as S.
Wallenstein.
   The new, expanded report will appear in the September issue of
the American Journal of Epidemiology. The study has been largely
complete for months, but its publication has been delayed because
of revisions by the authors and review by the journal's staff.
   Some community members continue to contend the accident left a
legacy of health problems that has yet to be officially recognized.
One survey conducted by two former residents in 1984 found an
increase in cancer rates around TMI, but the Health Department has
dismissed the findings.
   Kay Pickering, a spokeswoman for Three Mile Island Alert, a
citizens group, said she doubted that new study would go far enough
to disclose health effects possibly linked to the accident. She
said a better approach would be to track a sample of residents who
lived within a 5-mile radius of the plant at the time of the
accident. She said a similar survey was done the summer after the
accident.
   ``The people in the community are suffering. ... They believe
they have been affected,'' she said.
   A five-year study released by the Health Department in 1985
found no evidence of an increase in cancer in a 20-mile radius
around TMI.
   The study found no pattern of increased cancer cases or deaths,
but it did turn up isolated instances of higher-than-expected
cancer rates in several communities downwind from the plant. The
study dismissed those cases as statistically insignificant.
   A 1984 survey, conducted door-to-door by Norman and Marjorie
Aamodts, found cancer deaths up to seven times higher than expected
in sections of Newberry and Fairview townships near the plant. The
department judged the study invalid because it appeared to focus
unevenly on streets where cancer victims lived.
   The accident at TMI 2 occurred when a combination of human and
mechanical errors caused protective cooling water to be drained
from the reactor. Some of the reactor's nuclear fuel melted, and
radiation was released into the environment.
   A 1986 GPU Nuclear Corp. summary of government-sponsored studies
said the 8 millirem average radiation exposure for individuals
within 10 miles of the plant during the accident was less than the
10 millirems generated by a single chest X-ray.
   The highest possible exposure, for someone who stood naked at
the plant boundry throughout the accident, would have been less
than 100 millirems, according to the review by GPU, the plant's
operator.

   When it comes to rocks, the orangutans at the
San Diego Zoo are on a roll.
   Since January, the Bornean orangutans have outsmarted their
keepers and gone on a $57,000 rock-throwing spree, shattering seven
windows that separate their enclosure from zoo visitors.
   Zoo keepers also have found that old tricks to stop the rock
hurling have backfired. For years, the keepers successfully traded
bananas for rocks to get them out of the hands of primates Ken
Allen, Sophie and Kumang. But now the orangutans are collecting the
rocks to get the bananas.
   ``Now we've had to try to trade the rocks for bananas more often
and they're getting less and less cooperative,'' said zoo
spokeswoman Karen Killmar.
   ``Borneans like to throw things, and they have thrown rocks out
of the enclosures and barely missed people,'' Killmar said. She
said the orangutans keep digging holes and finding more rocks.
   Experts say an orangutan has the upper body strength of at least
five men. The windows the apes are shattering with the fist-size
rocks are as large as 6-by-7 feet, three layers and 1{ inches
thick. The windows weigh 900 pounds and take eight men to carry.

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 7 grafs to UPDATE with Iroquois confirmation they

<TEXT>
   Hope evaporated Thursday for a quick end to a
7-week-old armed standoff between police and Mohawks, and Quebec
Premier Robert Bourassa's office said he asked the army to move in
to remove Mohawk barriers at two locations.
   It said in a statement that Bourassa late Thursday broke off
talks aimed at lifting the barricades, erected in a land dispute.
   Bourassa said that because negotiators for the Six Nations
Iroquois Confederacy announced they were withdrawing from talks,
the government is going back to its original plan to use the army
to take down the barricades, according to the statement.
   Harvey Longboat, a delegate from the confederacy, said in a
telephone interview from the Six Nations reserve near Brantford,
Ontario, that his three-man team pulled out of talks early Thursday
morning at the end of an all-night negotiating session.
   The walkout came because delegates from the Kahnawake reserve
put old issues, including Mohawk sovereignty, back on the table, he
said.
   Billy Two Rivers, a Kahnawake negotiator, denied that new
demands were put on the table. He said the sovereignty issue had
always been part of the discussions.
   An army spokesman at Oka, Capt. Yvon Desjardins, said: ``Nothing
has changed. We got our orders about two days ago. Dismantling
barricades is our mandate. We are to act on our own as we see fit.
Our mandate has no limit.''
   Bourassa had broken off talks with the Mohawks on Monday and
ordered the army to remove the barricades.
   Last-ditch talks between Mohawks and government officials this
week included delegates from the confederacy, the highest-ranking
traditional leadership of the Iroquois, which includes the Mohawks.
   A solution to the conflict seemed in the offing Wednesday when
Indians helped Canadian soldiers remove two barricades blocking the
Mercier bridge connecting Montreal to its southern suburbs.
   Those Mohawks closed the bridge for seven weeks in sympathy with
the Indians in Oka, 18 miles west of Montreal.
   But work to tear down other barricades near the bridge stopped
abruptly Thursday after Mohawk leaders alleged ``harassment'' by
police and whites.
   Mohawk leaders said Thursday they made significant concessions
to end the dispute at Kahnawake, a reserve near the Mercier Bridge,
and at the Kahnesatake reserve near Oka.
   However, Mohawk Chief Joe Norton told reporters at the Mercier
Bridge that shipments of food and medicine were being blocked from
entering the Kahnawake reserve, both by angry residents of the area
and by the police.
   He warned, ``We can still close the Mercier Bridge again.''
   He also said negotiations to end the standoff at Kahnesatake,
near Oka, ``were headed for trouble'' if ``harassment'' by police
and whites continues.
   Chief Billy Two Rivers said Mohawks have been asked to give up
too much.
   ``Maybe some of the white people didn't see Indian blood, but
unfortunately we can't give them everything,'' he said.
   Quebec provincial police denied the charges of harassment. ``I
can categorically state that no food is being kept out of Kahnawake
whatsoever,'' said Capt. Donald Roy, an army spokesman.
   The standoff began July 11, when the Quebec provincial police
stormed an Oka barricade manned by Mohawks trying to block the
expansion of a golf course on land they consider ancestral. The
police were repulsed and one officer killed, but it is still not
clear who shot him.
   The dispute has prompted sympathy protests by Indians at the
Mercier bridge and elsewhere, but it has also touched off an
anti-Indian backlash amng residents angered by the barricades.
   The scene at the main barricade at Oka was relaxed earlier
Thursday, with only a few Mohawks occasionally appearing.
   Most of Kanesatake's 1,500 residents have left as a result of
the confrontation. An estimated 200 to 300 remain.

   A rapist who forces his elderly
victims to pose for photographs before he assaults them has claimed
his fourth victim in a northeast section of the city in the last
year, police said.
   ``What he's doing to these women is unbelievable,'' said Fort
Lauderdale sexual battery detective Jan Blackburn.
   A 73-year-old woman was attacked early Tuesday while she slept
in her home. She told police the assailant had a camera and that he
forced her to be photographed in obscene poses before raping her.
   Police say they believe the same man committed all four rapes
because of the methods of the attack and the women's description of
the rapist. The first attack occurred Sept. 8 and the women ranged
in age from 64 to 80.
   Each was awakened in the early morning, blindfolded and
photographed in obscene poses before being raped, and in each case
the man unplugged or cut telephone lines, Fort Lauderdale police
Sgt. Dave Geyer said.
   In all but Tuesday's case, the man attacked on a Sunday morning
and stole cash.
   A 75-year-old woman avoided becoming the fifth known victim
earlier this year by pushing a alarm button in her home, scaring
off the rapist, Geyer said.
   The rapist lectured the victims about how they invited the
attacks because their homes were insufficiently secured, Blackburn
said. The man apparently gains entry through windows and doors.
   Some attacks may have gone unreported because the women were too
embarrassed, Blackburn said.
   ``He uses a psychological ploy on the victims to cause them to
believe they're responsible for the attack, which makes them less
likely to report it,'' Geyer said.

<TEXT>
   Several thousand police officers
demonstrated Wednesday to press demands that their commanders
resign and Parliament pass a law depoliticizing the force.
   They also rejected criticism by the media and politicians
blaming the police for failing to prevent anti-Communist
demonstrators from torching the headquarters of the ruling
Socialist Party _ the reformed Communists _ on Sunday.
   Later Wednesday, Parliament passed a resolution condemning the
burning of the Socialist Party headquarters as ``a blow against
democracy.''
   Anti-Communist demonstrators ransacked the building in downtown
Sofia and set it afire Sunday night, incensed by the red star _ the
symbol of Communist, one-party rule _ atop the building.
   
   The blaze destroyed much of the building and damaged adjoining
structures. Police stood by for an hour as the anti-Communist
demonstrators prevented firefighters from fighting the blaze.
Police on the scene said they did not intervene immediately because
they had received no orders to do so.
   On Wednesday, police officers and civilian supporters
demonstrated on the square in front of downtown Alexander Nevski
Cathedral to press their demands for a new law defining the
militia's rights and duties.
   Addressing the rally from atop a police van, speaker after
speaker accused politicians of leaving them in the lurch and warned
that they might stop protecting parliament unless lawmakers passed
the new law.
   ``Resign! resign!'' the police demonstrators chanted, as their
speakers called on Interior Ministry officials and their commanders
to step down.
   ``It is high time that the incompetent people quit. The criteria
must be professionalism,'' one militia lieutenant told the crowd.
   He and other speakers demanded that Parliament pass within a
week a decree depoliticizing the militia. They claimed that many
militia commanders continued to be associates or relatives of
Communist officials ousted in the democratic upheaval that began
last November with the removal of hard-line Communist Party leader
Todor Zhivkov.
   One low-ranking officer complained that police were poorly
equipped to deal with ``the galloping crime rate.''
   Later in the day, the Parliament passed a resolution saying that
lawmakers understand the police demands and would enact a law
regulating the militia's activities soon.
   The resolution also denounced the arson attack on the Socialist
Party headquarters as ``a serious political crime'' and ``a blow
against democracy.''
   The official media did not provide any vote totals on the
resolution, but said that all of the deputies present voted for it
except for three who abstained. A majority of deputies are members
of the Socialist Party.
   After purging party conservatives, the ruling Communist Party
renamed itself the Socialist Party and won the country's first free
elections in more than four decades in June. But since then its
popularity has dropped, as many Bulgarians blame it for shortages
of basic consumer goods and other economic problems.

   The American Legion voted Wednesday to
extend membership eligibility to veterans of conflicts in Lebanon,
Grenada and Panama.
   A resolution approved unanimously by the national convention
called on Congress to amend the legion's charter by extending
eligibility to veterans who served between Aug. 24, 1982, and July
31, 1984, and between Dec. 20, 1989, and Jan. 31, 1990.
   The first dates would make veterans who served in Lebanon and
Grenada eligible, while the second dates cover Operation Just Cause
in Panama.
   Lee Harris, a spokesman for the Indianapolis-based organization,
said the amendment would be presented to Congress next year.
   The last time the 3 million-member legion extended its
membership was to include Vietnam War veterans.
   Legionnaires have balked at accepting veterans of undeclared
wars.
   ``My contention is there will never be another declared war,''
said Edward T. Hoak, who said he had worked 10 years to broaden the
group's membership. ``There will never be anything like another
World War II because the world can't stand that.''

   Investigators say the serial killer
stalking Gainesville college students is a shrewd, ``methodical
maniac'' with a talent for slipping inside windows or doors and a
sick grudge against slim brunettes.
   An army of investigators, including an FBI expert who worked on
the Ted Bundy, Charles Manson and ``Son of Sam'' cases, has
descended on this terrified college town in the hunt for the killer
of four young women and a man.
   The victims _ students at either the University of Florida or
Santa Fe Community College _ were stabbed to death in off-campus
apartments in three attacks discovered since Sunday. Police said
three of the women were mutilated.
   Police Chief Wayland Clifton said Wednesday the killer
apparently tracked certain types of women and entered their
apartments through unlocked doors or windows or by forcing
sliding-glass doors.

   Democrats are mobilizing local officials to
protest preliminary census figures and pressure the government to
take another look at the count for the nation's cities and rural
areas.
   ``I don't believe it,'' New York Gov. Mario Cuomo said Wednesday
when the Census Bureau estimated that his state's population grew
by fewer than 70,000 during the past decade.
   ``Way out of line,'' Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson said of the
estimate for his city.
   An analysis done for Democratic state legislators said the
preliminary figures for rural areas, particularly in the South,
were consistently below the population estimates issued by the
Census Bureau in February.
   With the release of numbers for New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania
and Texas, the Census Bureau completed its estimate of the
population for all 50 states. Overall, the preliminary census
figures show the United States with a population of 245,837,683.
Ten years ago, the census set the nation's population at
226,545,805.

   After a 20-year battle, an inventor with the
habits of a monk has received a patent that could make him a rich
man, assure him a place in the history of the Information Age _ and
spell trouble for the computer industry.
   Gilbert Hyatt, a 52-year-old engineer, received the patent July
17 for a single-chip computer he invented in 1968.
   The patent appears to cover chips in everything from pocket
calculators to cars to phones to electronic dishwashers. But
experts disagreed on whether it applies to all microprocessor chips
and millions of personal computers based on them.
   Hyatt, who lives in suburban La Palma, works 14 hours a day,
seven days a week. He doesn't take vacations, and he doesn't drink
or smoke.
   He battled with the U.S. Patent Office for two decades before he
was granted the patent. He said he hopes to negotiate licenses
under which electronics companies will pay him royalties for using
his invention. But any money will go toward expanding his
laboratory near his home and perhaps hiring researchers, a
departure from his solitary work habits, he said.

   Don't worry, Mom and Dad: Surprisingly few
schoolchildren trade the fruit in their lunch boxes for Twinkies.
Take the kids' word for it.
   Of 400 children ages 6-12 queried in a nationwide Gallup poll in
August, 77 percent said they eat the fruit their parents pack for
them. Five percent said they trade or throw it away. Others said
that what they do depends on the fruit.
   It could be that there is simply less junk food to trade for.
   The survey, commissioned by the Florida Department of Citrus,
found that 57 percent of 414 parents who were polled said they pack
fruit daily in lunch boxes. Four percent of parents said they never
packed fruit.
   In addition, 27 percent of the parents said the lunches they
pack are healthier than lunches their own parents gave them, and 85
percent said they would like to eat what they pack for their
children's lunches.

   Police clashed for a second
day Thursday with students protesting black factional fighting, and
the government said the conflict was forcing it to spend money on
security instead of social services.
   Witnesses in Cape Town said students hurled stones at police,
who fired birdshot in return and injured at least two protesters.
The students were demanding an end to battles between Xhosas, who
mostly support the African National Congress, and Zulus, who back
the conservative Inkatha movement.
   Officials of the Transkei homeland, where many Xhosas are from,
complained Thursday that South African authorities had left bodies
of victims of the fighting to rot outside Johannesburg area
mortuaries.
   They said people who traveled to the city to identify the dead
were unable to recognize their relatives because the bodies had

   About 250 militant Armenian nationalists gave up
their weapons Thursday after the republic declared a state of
emergency and surrounded their headquarters with soldiers, police
and tanks.
   The surrender was a major victory for Armenia's parliament,
which declared independence from the Soviet Union last week. By
reining in the militants with forces under its direct control _ no
troops from the central Soviet government were involved _ the
parliament dramatically emphasized its authority.
   Lawmakers had voted unanimously Wednesday to outlaw the militant
group, which called itself the Armenian National Army. The vote
followed a night of violence in which militants attacked a gas
station, killed a legislator and fired automatic rifles at a rival
organization's headquarters.
   The militants, holed up in three buildings in the republic's
capital of Yerevan, at first ignored an ultimatum from the
parliament to surrender by 10 p.m. Wednesday or face a military
showdown, Armenian officials said.
   After several hours of fruitless negotiations between
parliamentary representatives and Armenian National Army leaders,
about 500 government soldiers and police moved into the buildings
at about 1:30 a.m. Thursday. They met no resistance, Soviet media
reported.

   Animal cancer tests in which rodents are fed
massive doses of chemicals may be useless for calculating the
cancer risks in humans because the dose itself may be causing the
disease, researchers say.
   In articles to be published Friday in the journal Science, two
research groups question the value of government-supported cancer
tests on rats. One suggested the United States should drop its
concern about ``trivial'' traces of synthetic chemicals in the
environment.
   Bruce N. Ames, a professor of cell biology at the University of
California, Berkeley, said cancer develops in rats fed high doses
of chemicals because cells in the test animal are killed by the
chemicals and are then replaced.
   Each time replacement cells are grown, said Ames, there is a
risk of a cancer mutation. The more cells that are replaced over a
lifetime, the higher the odds of a cell mutating into cancer. But,
he said, the cancer may be caused by the dose, not by the chemical
action itself.

defy recycling.
   Maine's unique ban on sale of most beverages in aseptic
packaging takes effect Saturday, just as children prepare to return

   While the timing of the law was, by all accounts, coincidental,

   When Murray Friedman was at college in the
1940s and '50s, Jewish students would sometimes Americanize their
names to avoid being considered outsiders. Nowadays, he said, a few
are even changing back to Israeli, or biblical names.
   ``We've seen a re-ethnicization of American life,'' said
Friedman, director of the Temple Center for the Study of American
Jewish History recently established here.
   ``This re-ethnicization has had a positive and some negative
effects,'' he said. ``In general, more positive, because the nation
has always been a nation of groups. The multiplicity of groups
really goes back a long way in American life.''
   The center, part of Temple University's College of Arts and
Sciences, aims to encourage systematic research and organize
conferences on American Jewish life.
   ``The creation of a center reflects a community re-examining its
history and traditions,'' said Friedman. ``It's a relatively new
field of study. American Jewish history has not been probed very
deeply.''
   A small Jewish community existed in America from the country's
beginnings, he said. When the Constitution was celebrated in 1787,
Philadelphia's Jewish community was invited to the celebration and
created a ``kosher table.''
   When Jews fled pogroms in Europe and poured into the United
States in the 1880s, the Philadelphia Jewish community functioned
``as a cohesive force during a period when several million Jews
needed to be integrated into society, both as Jews and Americans,''
Friedman said.
   In tandem with Jewish settlers in New York, the Philadelphians
``provided intellectual leadership'' and in the 1920s helped create
what became the central institutions of American Jewish life, he
said.
   ``During a period of intense bigotry overseas and to a lesser
extent in the United States, the basic model was to disappear into
the melting pot, to assimilate,'' Friedman said.
   However, that pattern is changing, as a result of greater
tolerance toward Jews, and a rise in pride in being one, he said.
   ``Much of American Jewish history is made up of crises,''
Friedman said, citing the problems of immigration and adjustment,
the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s, the Great Depression and the rise of
Adolf Hitler.
   ``At the end of World War II, perhaps for the first time, the
Jewish community of America could breathe easier,'' he said. ``We
rushed headlong into the opportunities that opened up in American
life. By the '50s we were moving up very rapidly.''
   ``In general American life has been very good to Jews,'' he said.
   Jews played an active role in the earliest stages of the civil
rights movement and helped found the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, said Friedman, who was a civil
rights worker in 1954-59 in Richmond, Va.
   ``In the '50s and '60s, political liberalism was the secular
religion of U.S. Jews. Beginning in 1967 up to the present period,
Israel has been the secular religion of American Jews,'' Friedman
said.
   Friedman said he felt American Jews were becoming increasingly
uncomfortable with Israel's response to Palestinian unrest in the
West Bank. But he added: ``I see no diminution of fundamental
Jewish support for Israel.''
   Friedman, 63, is the Middle Atlantic director of the American
Jewish Committee. The author of two books on the history of
Philadelphia Jewry, he is preparing a book on the history of
black-Jewish relations.
   He said the idea that relations between the two communities were
``all great'' before deteriorating in the late 1960s is ``a bit of
a fallacy.
   ``The relationship was always complex and at times ambivalent,''
he said.
   He said it was hard to give an easy answer on the future of
black-Jewish relations. But ``there are elements in both
communities anxious to break out of hostilities and conflicts in
recent years,'' he said.
   He referred to a new study by the National Opinion Center of the
University of Chicago that concluded: ``The overall movement of
Jewish attitudes towards racial tolerance is abundantly evident . .
. and clearly refutes the idea of a Jewish backlash against
blacks.''

   American Indian Episcopalians held special

   David Pendleton Oakerhater, who took the Christian name David
Pendleton in respect for a benefector who financed his education
for the ministry, was ordained a deacon in Syracuse in 1881, the
church's first Indian clergyman.
   He served among the Cheyennes in Oklahoma at the Whirlwind
Mission of the Holy Family near Watonga, Okla. In part of a
preserved sermon to assembled Cheyenne leaders, he said:
   ``You remember when I led you out to war I went first and what I
told you was true. Now I have been away to the East and I have
learned about another captain, the Lord Jesus Christ, and he is my
leader.
   ``He goes first, and all he tells me is true. I come back to my

permanent replacement workers, the right to strike will be merely a
right to quit.''
   ``Employers know the consequences of hiring permanent
replacements,'' the message says. ``Many who do so are not
motivated solely by the need to keep their factories operating, but
by a desire to get rid of the union. . . .
   ``The right to strike without fear of reprisal is fundamental in

<HEAD>Special `20-20' Tackles the Illness of Depression</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You might be too depressed to read this. But
please, hang on for a minute.
   You're not alone. Depression afflicts as many as 20 million
other Americans every year. If you tune in to ABC's ``20-20''
tonight, you'll see how people can cope with it and get better.
   Abraham Lincoln had it. So did writer William Styron, who talks
about it on ``20-20.'' Winston Churchill called it ``the black dog
on my back'' and would simply disappear for days, bedridden and
unable to function.
   Ten percent of men and at least 20 percent of women will suffer
at least one episode of depression.
   Depression is an illness. It's as real as diabetes and just as
treatable, and just as deadly if left untreated. Unlike diabetes,
it is curable.
   ``It's a very high percentage for a disease that is not
recognized as a disease,'' said Hugh Downs, who anchors the
one-hour special.
   Depression is not just a bad case of the blues. It is one of the
purest forms of mental anguish, a debilitating, unending grief
without focus. People who haven't had it can't really understand it.
   Only a third of people who suffer depression seek help for it.
   ``The destruction of hope is the most cruel aspect of it,'' said
Downs.
   Clinical depression, its severest form, is deadly, said Dr.
Harold Eist, a Bethesda, Md., psychiatrist who has treated
thousands of depressed people during his career.
   ``It's a terrible, painful illness that interferes with
motivation, that tangles their thoughts, that makes them hopeless,
that fills them with despair, that fills them with self-hatred,''
says Eist.
   ``And finally the pain is so great the only way our they can see
is destroying themselves. There are very few illnesses of that
magnitude.''
   Nobody knows exactly what causes depression or why certain drugs
can ease it. Researchers have found that depression tends to run in
families and they are searching for a genetic link.
   ``I think it's worse at times than physical pain,'' said one
sufferer. ``Physical pain you know goes away. Depression doesn't go
away overnight. It's not where you say, `Well, OK, I'll go to bed
and tomorrow morning I'll wake up, I'll feel fine. We'll start a
new day.' Depression just lingers and lingers.''
   Depression's milder form is dysthymia, which means ``bad mood''
in the same way that angina pectoris means ``pain in the chest,''
Downs said. It's a constant, chronic, low-grade depression that can
rob life of any pleasure.
   In addition to interviews with depression's victims and their
families, tonight's ``20-20'' looks at the various treatment
options available.
   New methods of ``talk therapy'' combined with anti-depressant
drugs have helped many people and are less expensive than
traditional psychoanalysis _ a long-term, deep therapy with a
psychiatrist.
   ``20-20'' also discusses an old technique used as a last resort
in treating the deepest, intractable depressions: electroconvulsive
``shock'' therapy, in which a mild electric current zaps the brain,
inducing convulsions.
   Downs said he and writer-producer Jonathan Talmadge hope that
the program will encourage depressed people to get help.
   ``If it was just another gee-folks-ain't-this-awful syndrome, we
wouldn't have put it on,'' Downs said.

   Elsewhere in television ...
   DEPARTMENT OF REDUNDANCY DEPT.: CBS tonight offers ``Partners in
Life,'' an unpreviewed half-hour comedy that is definitely not on
the fall schedule. It ``affectionately spoofs the buddy comedies of
the '30s and '40s.''
   That would make it a spoof of spoofs, which is a formula for
disaster.
   And yet ... the script is by Dick Blasucci and ``SCTV'' alumnus
Joe Flaherty.
   Joe Guzaldo and Kevin Pollak play Chick Morton and Eddie Hayes,
who are working as rickshaw drivers trying to raise the fare home
from the steamy intrigues of Macao. Jennifer Jason Leigh and
Christopher Guest also appear.
   And yet ... all this is introduced by Rob Reiner, who plays Max
King III, an emcee who introduces the show as a ``lost episode'' of
the ``Morton and Hayes'' show.
   That makes it a spoof of a spoof of a spoof, and violates the
formula. Considering the large talents involved, ``Partners in
Life'' could be weirdly funny or extremely stupid.
   Tonight's your one chance to find out why it's not on the
schedule.

<HEAD>Foreign TV Unwelcome Intrusion in Parts of Asia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Asian governments that want to control what
their people see on television are fighting a losing battle with
satellites and receiving dishes.
   Direct broadcasts from foreign countries into private homes via
satellite are spreading rapidly.
   Some officials fret over the impact on their people's values and
way of life. Western diplomats say others fear their social and
political control might be questioned if citizens have wider
freedom of choice.
   Ever smaller and cheaper receiving dishes and the launch of a
major telecommunications satellite make it increasingly difficult
for governments to deny viewers direct access to foreign television.
   ``We may not be able to check foreign TV intruding into our
lives for much longer,'' Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore
said in 1988, but he has done a pretty good job so far.
   The only known satellite-reception dish not in his government's
hands that is capable of receiving foreign programs sits on the
roof of the U.S. Embassy. Installation was permitted ``strictly for
embassy use'' two years after an application was filed.
   Others in this prosperous city-state are prohibited by law from
owning or selling such dishes, except for export. Foreign programs
for the three Singapore Broadcasting Corp. channels are screened to
``filter out unacceptable and harmful values and lifestyles,'' said
communications official Mah Bow Tan.
   One official said full access to foreign TV shows, permissive
American offerings especially, could harm a young nation composed
of different races, religions and cultures. He said censorship of
foreign movies, magazines and TV was necessary to repel cultural
subversion.
   Not everyone agrees. Lim Boon Heng, a member of Parliament, said
the government should consider broadcasting to the surrounding
region by satellite and stop trying to control the use of receiving
dishes.
   Compact new receivers are small enough to fit into a suitcase,
and Lim said: ``When dishes get to that size, the authorities will
have a hard time to control the use of satellite receivers . . . so
why fight it?''
   A major enemy in this information war is positioned slightly to
the east and 22,753 miles up. AsiaSat-1 was launched from China in
April by a Long March III rocket and is in orbit near the Equator.
   Telecommunications satellites are not new to the region.
Indonesia was the first country in Asia and third in the world,
after Canada and the United States, to have a domestic satellite.
Japan and Australia also have communications satellites.
   AsiaSat-1, the first privately owned satellite, has the
potential to beam signals to and from the Middle East, Singapore
and Tokyo, and could offer a dozen new channels to an area with
more than 2 billion potential viewers. The owner is a consortium
led by Hutchison Whampoa (Holdings) Ltd. and based in Hong Kong.
   In Indonesia alone, where reception from the government's Palapa
series of satellites was established in 1976, an estimated 25,000
dishes can pick up AsiaSat-1.
   Hong Kong officials announced in early August that individuals
could own and operate dishes for personal use without licenses,
lifting a ban that had been widely ignored for years. Broadcasters
and operators of dishes that serve more than one viewer must have
licenses.
   Elsewhere, the picture is equally mixed.
   Satellite dishes are legal in the Philippines upon approval of
an application, but few applications are approved. Those who can
afford it put them up anyway, apparently assuming the government
has more important rules to enforce.
   Direct reception of satellite television still is forbidden in
Thailand, which maintains close control over telecommunications,
but pressure against the policy is increasing.
   ``We cannot stop technologies from growing,'' Joompol Rodcumdee
of Chulalongkorn University in Thailand told a regional seminar on
the socio-economic impact of broadcast satellites.
   ``Today we may say we will not use them, but tomorrow we may not
be able to get away from them,'' he said.
   Vijay Menon, secretary-general of the Asian Mass Communication
Research and Information Center, said the estimated 150,000
satellite dishes in South Korea were ``not viewed as a blessing or
even as a sign of progress.''
   ``Journalism professors have been filling local newspapers with
letters denouncing the impact of foreign TV on Korean society,'' he
said. ``Foreign programs, they feel, are making viewers in Korea
adopt alien ways of thinking, life and customs and deepening the
dependency of Korea on alien culture.''
   Malaysia bans private satellites for direct TV reception, and
Madzhi Johari of the government broadcast training institute said:
``Direct access to broadcasting satellites means direct import of
norms and values of the developed countries and will result in
stress and conflict in our society.'' Indonesians seem relaxed
about the impact of numerous private dishes, which fall into a
legal no-man's land, neither permitted nor forbidden.
   ``There is no need to be alarmed over the possible unfavorable
consequences, be they cultural, political or economic,'' said a
senior executive at TVRI, the government network.
   Diplomats in Jakarta attribute the lack of concern to the fact
that most foreign programs are in English or other languages
relatively few Indonesians understand.

<HEAD>`Executioner' Goes to Work on Bureaucracy</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JORGE MEDEROS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many government employees refer to Joao
Santana as The Executioner because he makes heads roll. Others call
him Judas or Satan.
   Santana's official title is secretary of public administration.
His daunting task is to clean up Brazil's bloated and corrupt
government bureaucracy.
   It is no surprise that, in a nation where one in six citizens
works for some level of government, he has many enemies.
   In four months, Santana ordered 200,000 civil servants fired,
retired or ``sent home'' with pay but no extras in hopes they would
resign, according to government figures. That is half the target
President Fernando Collor de Mello, who took office March 15,
announced for his entire five-year term.
   Santana also oversaw the auction of 20 government-owned
mansions, formerly used rent-free by top bureaucrats, and ordered
the sale of 19,700 apartments, 4,800 vehicles and five airplanes.
   When he took office, Collor said, the bureaucracy was consuming
95 percent of tax revenues and causing a $31 billion deficit, which
was considered the main reason inflation had reached 5,000 percent
a year.
   He ordered a 25 percent reduction in the government's 1.6
million employees as part of his anti-inflation plan and chose
Santana, 32, to do the job.
   After Santana went to work, the Government Employees Union of
Brasilia held a ``symbolic funeral'' for The Executioner and he
even received physical threats.
   Santana said he feels most Brazilians support him.
   ``I don't consider myself a satan and the administrative reform
is not the work of the devil,'' he said in an interview. ``On the
contrary, the reform will exorcize the state's infernal inability
to attend taxpayers who deserve good services.''
   The reforms, including wiping out 12 Cabinet ministries and
closing dozens of state companies and agencies, cut expenses in
June to just 50 percent of tax revenues, he said.
   Politicians now seek his endorsement and people stop him in the
street to urge greater reductions, he said.
   ``A month ago, few congressmen wanted to have their picture
taken next to me,'' Santana told the interviewer. ``Now, many do. I
even taped political TV spots where I say, `I'm with this candidate
because he's just like me'.''
   Santana entered politics as a leftist opponent of the military
regimes that governed Brazil for 21 years until 1985. In 1979, he
helped found the Marxist-oriented Workers Party that now is the
Collor government's main opposition.
   He later abandoned leftist politics, graduated from the Sao
Paulo Univeristy Law School and worked in the Sao Paulo state
government. When Santana's friend Zelia Cardoso de Mello was chosen
as Collor's economy minister, she recommended him to carry out the
bureaucratic reform.
   Brazilian presidents have tried, or promised, to shrink the
bureaucracy for 50 years, without success.
   Jose Sarney, Collor's predecessor, established a Ministry of
Debureaucratization and declared in a speech, ``Spending is
forbidden.'' The bureaucracy got bigger.
   Joao Geraldo Piquet Carneiro, who directed the same task in the
military years, said the problem was not too many government
workers, but poor distribution of them.
   ``The number of civil servants is not disproportional to the
population'' of 150 million, Piquet Carneiro said, but added that
it was easier to fire workers than to reassign them.
   Santana acknowledged the reforms had ``political enemies'' and
had cost the president support in Congress.
   Many dismissed employees have gone to court seeking
reinstatement. The government lost a court case on reducing the pay
of workers ``sent home.''
   Another obstacle is a clause in the 1988 constitution that says
government workers with five years of seniority cannot be fired.
   According to Santana, the main resistance is in Brasilia, the
capital, which has 70,000 civil servants, and Rio, a former capital
that still has 160,000 government functionaries.
   A survey of 590 government workers in Brasilia revealed, to the
surprise of many people, that 58 percent felt the layoffs were
necessary.
   ``I sleep soundly,'' Santana said. ``When I finish the reform we
will have fewer public functionaries and more well-paid
professionals.''

<HEAD>IMF Study May Provide Key To Slowing Moscow's Economic Slide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The latest economic indicators in the Soviet
Union offer a dismal verdict of President Mikhail Gorbachev's
failure to pull the Soviet economy out of a steep nosedive.
   Official government figures showed that the total output of
goods and services shrank by 1 percent in the first six months of
1990, the traditional sign of a recession in a Western economy.
   In addition, the country's trade deficit has more than doubled
so far this year, while unemployment is up and inflation has
increased dramatically. All of this is coming at a time when Soviet
consumers are having a harder time getting food and the government
has a dwindling supply of hard currency to buy grain overseas.
   ``The Soviet economy is disintegrating,'' said Marshall Goldman,
the associate director of Harvard's Russian Research Center.
``Everybody is standing around watching Moscow burn, but nobody
knows what to do about it.''
   Gorbachev is appealing for massive financial aid to turn the
situation around, but the United States and many of its allies are
demanding a look at the Soviet balance sheets before they commit to
any major assistance programs.
   Many analysts believe those studies, especially one being
conducted by the International Monetary Fund, could prove critical
in determining the fate of Gorbachev's faltering economic reforms.
   Gorbachev's appeals for Western aid will be considered this
month when the IMF and its sister organization, the World Bank,
hold their annual meetings in Washington on Sept. 20-27.
   No decisions on those appeals are expected from the meetings.
But finance ministers from the 152 nations that make up the two
organizations will discuss the IMF-led study, which was ordered by
President Bush and other Western leaders this summer at the
economic summit of leading industrial nations in Houston.
   The study was a compromise between demands by the French and
West Germans for an immediate $15-billion aid package and
resistance to direct economic aid by Bush and other summit leaders.
It is scheduled to be completed in December.
   The International Monetary Fund generally is viewed as the top
cop of international finance. Its clout stems not just from the
loans it hands out, but also from the fact that other lenders take
their cue from the fund.
   If, for example, the IMF does not approve of a nation's plans to
get its economic house in order, that nation has a hard time
getting credit.
   But IMF austerity programs have in the past triggered bloody
riots in Third World nations unhappy with the prescription to curb
runaway inflation.
   Whether the Soviet Union, with its long history of distrust of
Western capitalism, will readily accept IMF dictates remains to be
seen.
   The study team faces other formidable obstacles.
   There is the question of how to measure the Soviet economy,
which operates with a currency that is not convertible into other
foreign currencies.
   While the Central Intelligence Agency estimates that the Soviet
economy was roughly 51 percent the size of America's $4.2 trillion
economy in 1989, other experts have attacked those figures as
grossly inflated and suggested that the total output of Soviet
goods and services is really only one-third that of America's gross
national product.
   The IMF study may resolve this debate, since one of its main
jobs will be to conduct an exhaustive look at a host of economic
statistics. These include Soviet gross national product, trade
statistics and the amount of hard currency on hand to pay for
shortfalls between what the country sells overseas and what it
imports.
   For decades, the Soviet Union was considered a good
international credit risk because the government always promptly
paid its import bills. But because of a widening trade gap, the
Soviets have fallen behind on their payments and are seeking trade
credits from other nations.
   West Germany already has agreed to $3 billion of such credits
and other European nations are expected to follow suit.
   The Bush administration, however, has so far rejected proposals
for direct financial aid, and instead offered technical assistance,
including advice on improving the collapsing food distribution
system or how to establish private banking.
   But many experts believe that the Soviet problems are so severe
they can be resolved only by a major overhaul of the economy and
massive economic support from the West.
   ``The Soviets face fundamental economic problems that are not
amenable to quick fixes,'' said Jeffrey Schott, an expert at the
Institute for International Economics, a Washington-based research
organization. ``The question of restructuring their entire economy
and their distribution system will take quite a number of years to
accomplish.''

<HEAD>Consumers Need To Be Convinced Lamb's Tasty, Says USDA Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans aren't particularly crazy about lamb
and mutton. They prefer beef, pork and poultry by an overwhelming
margin.
   But an Agriculture Department analysis says the U.S. sheep
industry is thriving despite the consumer snub, partly because of
drastic adjustments made in management and partly because of
government subsidies.
   ``The industry has adjusted to a long-term decline unmatched by
any other livestock sector,'' the report said. ``Producers' returns
have consistently been positive in recent years, and marketing
facilities and slaughtering plants have been adjusted to gain scale
economies for a declining industry.''
   Two distinct enterprises have developed, the report said. Stock
sheep producers manage grazing flocks on pasture and range forage.
Frequently this involves arid land that has few other possible uses.
   The other type of enterprise is lamb feeding, usually in
feedlots where young animals are fattened on grain for the
slaughter market. About 65 percent of the lambs slaughtered go
through feedlots.
   Historically, the U.S. sheep flock has at times seemed on the
verge of extinction. The USDA began records on stock sheep in 1867,
when 45 million head were reported. The peak was 51 million in 1884
but dropped to 33 million in 1923.
   Stock sheep increased again during World War II, rising to 49
million in 1942 but has declined in most years since.
   As of Jan. 1, 1990, the stock sheep inventory was estimated at
9.65 million head, up 5 percent from a year earlier. About 1.7
million sheep and lambs were reported in feedlots, up 4 percent.
   Stock sheep inventories are expected to remain in the range of 8
million to 10 million head in the next few years.
   Counting lambs in feedlots, the total U.S. flock peaked at 56
million in 1942. The Jan. 1 total was 11.4 million head.
   ``Lambs on feed are concentrated in the Great Plains and
California,'' the report said. ``Costs will continue to encourage
lamb feeding. In finishing animals, grain feeding generally costs
less per pound of grain than range feeding.''
   The report, which was ordered by Congress in the Omnibus Trade
and Competitiveness Act of 1988, said sheep producers compete with
cattle producers for grazing land, labor, water, and marketing and
transportation facilities.
   ``Sheep production, which generally yields higher returns than
cattle production, also requires more intensive use of labor and
management,'' the report said.
   ``Part of the reason for these relatively higher returns has
been a government program supporting the prices received for
domestic wool production,'' the report noted. ``In 1987, 17 percent
of stock sheep receipts came from government payments.''
   The subsidies stem from the National Wool Act of 1954, which
provides payments to producers when market prices fall below annual
support levels. Mohair clipped from goats also is eligible.
   Payments this year, for example, are expected to be around $100
million, split about equally between wool and mohair.
   The House and Senate farm bills now waiting on conference action
to settle differences include sections that would continue the
annual wool payments, although limiting them to $250,000 a year to
individual producers.
   According to the report, sheep production in the United States
has become ``a specialty industry'' that has only minor consumer
demand.
   ``Unless there is a major change in the demand for lamb that
would raise returns and attract new producers, the level of
production will likely cycle around present levels in the
foreseeable future,'' the report said.
   Figures by USDA show per capita consumption of lamb and mutton,
mostly lamb, averaged 1.5 pounds last year, based on a retail
weight equivalent.
   That compares with total red meat consumption of 134.7 pounds
per person in 1989, including 68.9 pounds of beef, 63.2 pounds of
pork, and 1.2 pounds of veal.
   Poultry consumption, meanwhile, was an average of 85.8 pounds
per person in 1989, including 66.6 pounds of broilers, or young
chicken.
   ``The main challenge to the U.S. lamb industry is to expand
consumption of a relatively expensive red meat in a market where
poultry is capturing more of the red meat market because of lower
relative prices,'' the report said. ``Furthermore, only a small
segment of the population consumes lamb, which means that the
industry also needs to attract new consumers to expand
consumption.''
   Although sheep producers have complained for years about
competition from imports of lamb from Australia and New Zealand,
the analysts didn't agree this is so.
   ``U.S. imports and domestic production of lamb have both
declined at about the same rate, indicating that the decline in the
lamb industry is not the result of import penetration, but due
mainly to a decline in consumer demand.''
   The report was written by economists Richard Stillman, Terry
Crawford and Lorna Aldrich of the department's Economic Research
Service.

   How to make something worth nothing worth
something?
   The Soviet Union is trying to turn its practically worthless
ruble into an internationally accepted currency, and the task is
putting the world's leading economists to the test.
   So far, the verdict is that making something of value of the
bills that carry the hammer and sickle won't be easy. But it's an
essential step on the Soviet road toward the modern economic world.
   Rubles are worth nothing outside the Soviet Union because the
government has refused to back them with hard currency, gold or
silver. Tourists are allowed to take only a few rubles into or out
of the country, and even that was prohibited until recently.
   This has insulated the ruble from the ups and downs of world
money markets, but has reduced Moscow to conducting much of its
foreign trade as barter _ trading Stolichnaya vodka for Pepsi-Cola,
for instance. The government sells its precious natural resources
to earn foreign currency.
   As Soviet economists debate how to establish a market-driven
economy, they are increasingly aware of the need for a convertible
currency.
   Government economists are expected to announce a 500-day plan to
move toward a market system and make the ruble fully convertible by
the turn of the century.
   Transforming the ruble will be complex.
   To begin with, a ruble's comparative worth is unclear. The
government maintains two official exchange rates that allow
foreigners to buy a ruble for either $1.59 or 16 cents, depending
on the nature of the transaction.
   The second rate, available only to tourists, is widely regarded
as more accurately reflecting the ruble's real value, said Ed
Hewett, an economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
   Making the ruble freely convertible would allow the world market
to determine its worth, but that could bring substantial pain to
Soviet consumers, said Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard University
economist who has been an architect of Poland's ``shock therapy''
economic reforms.
   Soviet citizens have an extraordinarily high savings rate
because there is little for them to buy and subsidized prices of
many staple goods are artificially low.
   According to Sachs, if the ruble became convertible overnight,
people would have a large amount of money to spend on Western goods
_ the classic ``money chasing goods'' form of inflation.
   That could create inflation so severe that the government might
fall, said Josef Brada of Arizona State University.
   Sachs suggested the danger of inflation could be lessened by
having the government simultaneously double prices and wages,
effectively reducing the potential strength of savings.
   Raising prices is the least popular element of proposed economic
reforms, however, and plans for a gradual change to convertibility
have been put forward.
   Brada led a panel of experts that proposed a five-step plan last
year. In the first phase, some hard currency would be made
available at auction for state enterprises to buy with rubles.
   The auction would gradually be broadened to include
cooperatives, private enterprise and joint ventures. After that,
households would be allowed to own foreign currencies and
foreigners would be given the right to exchange their currencies
for rubles at a rate determined by the market.
   In August, the government said some businesses would be allowed
to trade rubles for hard currency at a market rate beginning next
year, as a step toward making the ruble convertible.
   Brada said his step-by-step approach would protect consumers
from the first volatile days of convertibility and act as a
``whip'' to drive industry.
   He said Soviet industries that produce the best products, and
would have the best chance in world markets, are probably the
richest in rubles and in the best position to buy large amounts of
hard currency.
   They could use the hard currency for successful foreign
ventures, and inefficient factories without the rubles to buy hard
currency would fall aside.
   ``If convertibility accomplishes anything, it reallocates
resources from inefficient to efficient'' industries, Brada said.
   Proposals with many of the same concepts, but in different
sequences, were among the winners of a suggestion contest sponsored
by an American philanthropist this year. In those proposals,
creation of an efficient, market-oriented economy is seen as a
necessary precursor of convertibility.
   Hewett, one of the contest judges, said the Soviet Union must be
able to offer ``a range of products that is broad and deep enough''
to compete on the world market before the ruble becomes fully
convertible.
   Otherwise, he said, rubles would be spent on foreign goods and
the Soviet Union would have no way of earning hard currency.
   To that, Brada added that having a healthy manufacturing base is
better support for a currency than gold reserves.
   ``Gold is readily indentifiable . . . but the value (of a
currency) in international terms is the country's ability to
export,'' he said.
   After determining how to make the ruble convertible, the Soviet
government would have to consider the extent to which it was
prepared to intervene in the exchange market, buying rubles with
gold or foreign currencies to support the ruble if its price
started to fall.
   ``My suspicion is that the Soviets would do a lot of
intervention,'' Brada said. ``Psychologically, they have a strong
preference for stability.''
   In the initial stages, convertibility will be just a ``look at
what the ruble can do in various activities,'' Brada said.
   If it can't do much, winners of the convertibility competition
won't have to worry. The prize money was in dollars, 42,000 of them.

<HEAD>Brazil's Baroque Gem Is Crumbling</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OURO PRETO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This beautiful baroque city built in
Portugal's days of empire is crumbling and rotting away.
   Its 18th century churches are deteriorating and rain penetrates
their wooden roofs to destroy paintings and sculptures. Heavy
traffic tears up the cobblestones.
   ``Ouro Preto is heading for self-destruction,'' said the Rev.
Jose Feliciano Simoes, who was born here and serves on the Latin
American Commission of Sacred Art.
   The colonial city in the mountains of east central Brazil has
been designated part of ``mankind's world heritage'' by the United
Nations. It has 38 churches and chapels dating from Portuguese
rule, which began in the 16th century and ended in 1822.
   Simoes said government neglect has permitted serious damage to
nearly all of them and the problem is compounded by leaking roofs
that allow rain to erode walls, wooden fixtures and priceless
paintings.
   Eight of the 13 major churches in the city's historic central
district have had to be closed all or part of the time.
   ``If the government doesn't act immediately, a primary symbol of
our art and cultural identity will be lost,'' the priest said.
   Ouro Preto's name means Black Gold in Portuguese. Huge gold
deposits were found nearby and, during much of the 18th century, it
was one of South America's richest and most important cities.
   Gold money financed a rich development of arts and culture in
the city 235 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro. The Opera House,
built in 1770, is one of the oldest in Latin America.
   Culture shared the stage with politics. Joaquim Jose da Silva
Xavier, who was known as Tiradentes and led a revolt against
Portuguese rule in the late 18th century, was a resident of Ouro
Preto.
   He lost and was executed in 1792, but many still consider him
the George Washington of Brazil.
   The Roman Catholic Church was a pillar of colonial rule and a
generous share of mineral wealth went to build the ornate churches
that grace the city's streets and dot its hillsides.
   When the ``gold cycle'' ended in the early 19th century, Ouro
Preto entered a long, slow economic decline but remains
internationally known as a treasury of history and culture.
   ``Ouro Preto's churches were constructed by some of Brazil's
greatest artists and are among the most beautiful in the country,''
said Carlos Jose Aparecido de Oliveira, director of the Carmo
Museum of Sacred Art. ``The loss of even one of them would
represent a national tragedy.''
   Simoes' church, Our Lady of Pilar, is the richest and most
ostentatious, adorned with 950 pounds of gold and 840 pounds of
silver. It was completed in 1733, and is one of only two in
near-perfect condition.
   He traced the city's latest problems to the cost-cutting of
President Fernando Collor de Mello, who was inaugurated in March.
The two federal agencies charged with historic preservation were
abolished and the Brazilian Institute of Cultural Heritage, their
replacement, is still being organized.
   Collor's plan also ended the ``Sarney Law,'' decreed by his
predecessor, Jose Sarney, which allowed private companies to deduct
contributions to cultural projects.
   The combined effect was to halt all restoration projects in Ouro
Preto and open the door to illegal construction that further
disfigures the city.
   Architect Janice Nascimento is the only remaining employee at
the Office for Historic and Cultural Preservation, which is to
continue functioning until the new Institute takes over, and
described her situation as desperate.
   She said the office's only engineer and the six staff members
who inspected for illegal constructions had been dismissed.
   ``We have so little money I have to pay for the gas in the
agency's car,'' she said. ``There has been a steep increase in
illegal building and I am unable to do anything about it.''
   Ms. Nascimento said another serious problem is that city
officials have ignored pleas to bar heavy trucks that destroy
cobblestone streets in the central district and weaken buildings
with vibration.
   ``Many residents don't see the need to preserve the city,'' she
said. ``They see it (preservation) as a sign of backwardness.''
   The worst problems plague St. Francis of Assisi Church, the
masterwork of Antonio Francisco Lisboa, better known as Aleijadinho
and considered the greatest Brazilian artist of the colonial period.
   It has two round bell towers, a trompe l'oeil painting of the
Virgin Mary and a flock of angels covering the nave ceiling, and
two magnificent soapstone medallions above the main entry sculpted
by Alejadinho.
   In addition to major cracks and chips in the medallions and
serious internal damage caused by a leaky roof, the arch that
separates the main altar from the nave is crumbling and held up by
scaffolding.
   Elsewhere, the situation is equally grim.
   Rainwater has eaten away elaborately carved wooden side altars
of the Rosary Church, one of two that was used exclusively by black
slaves. Wall and ceiling murals have virtually disappeared.
   Scaffolding covers much of the facade of St. Francis of Paula,
which was built in the 19th century and is the city's newest
church. Money for the restoration ran out recently and the church
is closed.
   Our Lady of Conception, the largest church in the city and one
of the oldest, was to be entirely restored with private
contributions, but only the ceiling was fixed before the ``Collor
Plan'' halted work.
   A major landslide late last year damaged a side wall of Our Lady
of Grace and Pardons. It has not been repaired.
   ``If we have a period of heavy rains this year, we are going to
have a disaster on our hands and any further damage may be
irreversible,'' Simoes said.

   The Middle East crisis started in a dispute over oil, but its
biggest effect may be on another commodity: political power.
Alliances among Gulf countries are changing faster than any maps of
the region, and a central question for many is what partnerships
will remain when the tension subsides.
   The Associated Press checked with five specialists on Middle
East affairs for their opinions on that element of the conflict.
Here are their responses:

   The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait means an end to traditional
political alignments in the Middle East.
   Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states have now opted for close
relations with the West. This is a remarkable change from past
practice. It will mean more military security for the Saudis, but
opens the possibility of a reaction among those who resent the
presence of foreign, non-Muslim powers in the heart of the Islamic
world. The U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf is
likely to continue for some time, even after this crisis passes.
   Egypt's security ties with the West are likely to grow, and will
likely lead to requests from Egypt for greatert who has spent this particular
crisis either playing golf
or using up high-priced fuel for his fishing launch.

<HEAD>Gulf Crisis Casts Shadow Over '90 Elections</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The threat of a desert war is hanging over the
1990 midterm campaign and leaving candidates struggling to get the
attention of an electorate worried about the military confrontation
between the United States and Iraq.
   ``Politics in the fall is going to be on hold,'' said Michael
McCurry, spokesman for the Democratic National Committee.
   ``Iraq knocked everything off the radar screen,'' said Ed
Rollins, co-chairman of the House Republican campaign committee.
   This first midterm election of the George Bush presidency was
anticipated as the political battle that could set the tone for the
final decade of the 20th century.
   At stake this fall are 35 Senate seats, 36 governors and the
entire U.S. House along with thousands of state legislators.
   Republicans recruited a strong set of challengers to bolster
their hopes of narrowing the 55-to-45 Democratic majority in the
Senate. For Democrats, the hottest prospects are in races for
governor, particularly in California and Florida.
   The biggest prize this year is control of the redistricting
process, the redrawing of U.S. House and legislative districts to
reflect the results of the 1990 Census. Preliminary Census figures
would mandate a shift of 19 U.S. House seats, most of them going
from the industrial North and Midwest to the South and West.
   Races for governor and legislative seats will determine which
party draws the lines in many key states, including California
which gains seven new House seats.
   A month ago, the issues seemed clear. The economy was sluggish
and the budget deficit persistent. President Bush backed away from
his ``no new taxes'' pledge as he entered budget negotiations with
congressional Democrats. Politicians in both parties were
scrambling to distance themselves from former contributors in the
savings and loan industry.
   Everyone was against drugs and in favor of improving the
nation's schools and cleaning up the environment. The discomfort
index over past positions on abortion remained high.
   Then Saddam Hussein ordered his army into Kuwait.
   Political commercials are on the air. Candidates are debating.
But there is an uneasy feeling no one is listening and races could
be decided on local issues rather than broad national themes.
   ``The Middle East has pretty well dominated the situation
here,'' said Stephen Roberts, Republican National Committeeman for
Iowa. ``It's been pretty hard for the politics to get through.''
   Iowa has two hard-fought statewide races. Rep. Tom Tauke is
challenging Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin in what is regarded as one
of the tighter Senate races. Democrat Don Avenson is trying to
unseat Republican Gov. Terry Branstad.
   Abortion dominated recent debates in both races. Harkin and
Avenson support abortion rights, while Tauke and Branstad both take
anti-abortion positions.
   ``I don't think either set of debates got a great deal of
flurry,'' said Roberts.
   Jim Ruvolo, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, agreed that
the political debate can't break through the current concern about
the Middle East.
   ``What people want to hear about is has war started yet and
what's happening with the reserves,'' he said.
   Right now, he added, ``people seem to be basically supportive of
what Bush is doing, but with a lot of questions.''
   Is there any sign that one party or the other will benefit from
the crisis?
   ``It's too early to tell,'' said Ruvolo.
   ``It's really not been part of the Senate campaigns,'' said
Anita Dunn, communications director for the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee. ``In terms of news coverage, it makes it more
difficult for challengers who are not part of a foreign policy
story the way incumbents are,'' she said, her view reflecting the
fact that in most cases the senators fighting the toughest
challenges are Democrats.
   ``I don't know where it goes from here,'' conceded Rollins.
Before the Iraq move into Kuwait, Rollins was hopeful that
Republicans would benefit from ``an anti-incumbent mood that was
starting to build,'' fed by public unhappiness over the political
ties between members of Congress and operators of savings and loan
institutions.
   ``It's awful hard to talk about savings and loans when you're on
the verge of war,'' he said.
   John Buckley, who once worked for the GOP campaign committee and
now is a public relations executive, said he sees no driving issues.
   ``I get the sense it's tough for people even to manufacture
enthusiasm over this election because it's an election based on not
a single issue,'' he said.
   He called the S&amp;L scandal ``a finger-pointing exercise'' in
which neither party has an advantage.
   ``Any incumbent who has an ethical problem or has a real tie
into the S&amp;L problem is going to be hurt,'' he said. On the other
hand, he does not detect any widespread mood to ``throw all the
rascals out.''
   Whether the public starts paying attention or not, the polls
will open as scheduled on Nov. 6 and a handful of September
primaries should settle the candidate lineups.
   On Tuesday, Florida Democrats will decide the contest between
former Sen. Lawton Chiles and Rep. Bill Nelson. They are competing
for the nomination to challenge Republican Gov. Bob Martinez, who
is near the top of Democratic lists of incumbent Republicans.
   The following week, Arizona Republicans will decide whether to
support former Gov. Evan Mecham's comeback attempt or opt for
millionaire land developer J. Fife Symington. Other races decided
that day will include Democratic contests for nominations to
challenge Republican governors in New Hampshire and Rhode Island.
   Later in the month, Massachusetts voters will settle
gubernatorial primary battles in both parties, picking the
candidates bidding to succeed Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   Missing from this political season is much activity by likely
1992 presidential candidates.
   Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle plan a lot of fall
campaigning, but there is an unusual quietude on the Democratic
side.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the 1988 Democratic vice
presidential nominee, is campaigning for fellow Democrats but
disclaims any interest in a 1992 race.
   Other prominent Democrats are on the 1990 ballot and claim they
have no plans beyond their own re-election. None appears to have
more than token opposition. They include Gov. Mario Cuomo of New
York, Sens. Al Gore of Tennessee, Joseph Biden of Delaware, Bill
Bradley of New Jersey, and Sam Nunn of Georgia.
   Led by Democrats Dianne Feinstein of California and Ann Richards
of Texas, there is a strong contingent of women on ballots in both
parties. Feinstein and Richards are running for governor. Other
Democratic women running for governor include Joan Finney of Kansas
and Barbara Roberts of Oregon. Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy is one of
three Democrats seeking the gubernatorial nomination in
Massachusetts.
   Republican candidates for governor include incumbent Kay Orr in
Nebraska and challengers Barbara Hafer in Pennsylvania and Mary
Mead in Wyoming. Arliss Sturgelewski is the GOP nominee for
governor of Alaska, where Democratic incumbent Steve Cowper is not
seeking re-election.
   Josie Heath won the Democratic nomination for the Senate in
Colorado. The large field of GOP women running for the Senate
includes incumbent Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas and three
congresswomen rated as strong challengers to Democratic senators.
They are Lynn Martin, running against Sen. Paul Simon in Illinois,
Claudine Schneider against Sen. Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, and
Pat Saiki challenging Sen. Daniel Akaka of Hawaii.

   When Saddam Hussein sent troops across another
nation's borders a month ago today, he did more than that.
   He broke a spell. His act seemed out of step with recent
history, or at least with the direction history seemed to be
stumbling toward.
   Ordinary people were beginning to accept the notion that
history, in the fall of 1989, had made a monumental shift.
   On Nov. 9, 1989, people danced on top of the Berlin Wall. ``What
joy,'' said a West Berliner. With their hands, Germans pulled
chunks of mortar from the wall that had divided East from West for
26 years.
   They would have been shot dead if they'd done that a month
before. Something had happened.
   The thought took hold in those heady days that peace _ and
peacefulness _ was possible. Anthony Downs, an expert on democracy
at the Brookings Institution, says Americans were going on a peace
binge, and maybe were going overboard.
   ``It was a great thing that the dictatorships had ended,'' Downs
says. ``We all got a big kick out of it. But we were overly
optimistic about the prospects for democracy in Eastern Europe.
There's going to be a period of chaos and even violence.''
   Something like the same euphoria existed in April 1945, when
Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan were on the verge of defeat. Fifty
countries met in San Francisco and agreed that henceforth disputes
between nations would be settled by votes among members of
something called the United Nations.
   But the Cold War immobilized the United Nations and the world
got used to living with terror. For 45 years, the prospect of war
with the Soviet Union seemed to touch everything.
   The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists took up the custom of printing
a ``doomsday clock'' on its cover. With every bleak crisis, the
hands were moved closer to midnight. With every step toward
disarmament, some distance was put between them.
   Then came the revolutions of 1989. For whatever reasons, Mikhail
Gorbachev opened the window to reform and the structure of
communism was exposed as a Potemkin Village _ all facade.
   Eastern Europe _ ``captive nations'' in Cold War jargon _ pulled
out of orbit. Moscow acquiesced. The Soviets got out of
Afghanistan, the Cubans out of Angola.
   Nicaraguans held an election and ended their war. Over a 10-year
period, all of Latin America shed its juntas and turned toward
government by election. The white South Africans let Nelson Mandela
out of prison and seemed willing to work on white-black coexistence
in the most segregated society on earth.
   It looked for a while that mankind had something going here, not
quite a lambs-and-lions sleep-in, but at least a tendency to stop
the killing.
   In Washington, Francis Fukuyama, a State Department policy
planner, touched off an intellectuals' debate with an essay, ``The
End of History.'' People took him to be saying that the great
clashes of ideology were over: the Western idea had won, ergo
history was done.
   Evidently, Saddam Hussein didn't read Fukuyama. He engaged in a
decidedly old-fashioned enterprise, the kind history is full of: an
invasion.
   ``It's been a splash of cold water on the national mood,'' says
M. Brewster Smith of the University of California at Santa Cruz,
former president of the American Psychiatric Association. ``As a
psychologist, I'd say our hopes might have been a little dreamy.''
   But he quickly adds: ``I would not like to have people conclude
that war in inevitable, built into human nature. I'd be unhappy if
the result of all this is to quench that bit of hope that was
beginning to become an effective political force.''
   And another psychiatrist, Ervin Staub, author of ``The Roots of
Evil: the Origins of Genocide and Other Group Violence,'' draws
encouragement from the way the world has responded to Saddam by
ostracizing him. Rather than resort to arms, the world ``has told
the aggressor that his aggression is intolerable.''
   ``If the world succeeds this time and responds the same way next
time, then it becomes a little less likely that there will be
another next time,'' says Staub.
   From that he concludes that, Saddam notwithstanding, there is
still hope for hope.

   The birth and quick death of Diana
Perkins has focused attention on the use of forceps in the delivery
room, a practice that can save a baby's life _ or end it.
   Ronald Loffredo, a Saratoga Springs obstetrician, was found
negligent by state officials in nine of 12 births, including
Diana's, that he handled over three years; in each case forceps
were applied.
   Loffredo and his attorney are preparing to fight a lawsuit
brought by Diana's parents, the only family to sue.
   Diana was born on May 20, 1986. She died three days later.
   Loffredo was accused of failing to determine Diana was too large
for a vaginal delivery, thus neglecting to perform a Caesarean
section. He also was found negligent of failing to properly assess
the baby's position before using forceps, administering a uterine
stimulant ``in a potentially obstructed labor,'' using excessive
force in delivery and causing unnecessary birth trauma to mother
and child.
   Loffredo no longer practices at Saratoga Hospital, and the state
Board of Regents, which oversees medical licenses, in July
suspended his license for one year. Once the suspension runs out,
Loffredo will be barred from delivering babies or performing
gynecological surgery until he completes a retraining program.
   In the fall of 1988 his admissions privileges were revoked by
Saratoga Hospital after a 28-year-old woman in his care died days
after delivering a healthy baby.
   He has generated support among some of his longtime patients,
who picketed the hospital and raised at least $50,000 for his
defense fund.
   ``This has been ruinous, absolutely ruinous,'' Loffredo said in
an interview.
   He defended his actions in the Perkins case and criticized
Saratoga Hospital for allowing itself to be goaded by the state
Health Department. Loffredo said the hospital exonerated him after
its own investigation of the Perkins case, but later was forced by
the Health Department to review its findings.
   ``None of the cases was brought about by patient complaints,''
said Loffredo, who has sued the Health Department and Saratoga
Hospital.
   ``This process is being driven by a bureaucracy,'' said
Loffredo's attorney, Frederick Killeen.
   Developed in 18th-century Europe, obstetrical forceps have long
been questioned. Double-bladed, resembling hinged salad tongs,
forceps generally are used to speed up delivery if the mother's
life is in danger or if the umbilical cord is wrapped around the
baby's neck. They also can be used to rotate the baby's head if it
is turned away from the normal birth position.
   The shallow steel or aluminum blades mold to the contours of the
baby's head and the birth canal. But even for a doctor highly
skilled in their use, forceps can cause permanent injury to both
patients, experts acknowledge. In some cases, forceps have left
permanent indentations on the skull, as well as cuts and bruises
around the newborn's face, ear and head.
   Actor Sylvester Stallone's delivery by forceps severed a nerve
on the left side of his face, causing a noticeable slur in his
speech.
   In the Perkins case, it was alleged the forceps left bruises on
the baby's neck and one earlobe. Loffredo, a soft-spoken man who
built his practice in Saratoga Springs after training in forceps at
Rochester General Hospital, said the baby suffered ``minor
scrapes'' but not enough to traumatize her.
   According to the National Center for Health Statistics in
Baltimore, forceps accounted for 17.4 percent, or 625,000, of the
3.6 million live births recorded in a 1980 survey. No accurate
records were kept before that, said Ken Keppel, spokesman for the
agency.
   However, the frequency of forceps use has declined dramatically
in most areas of the country, partly because of high medical
malpractice premiums, said Dr. Maurice Drusin, director of
obstetrics at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.
   ``It's been linked to all kinds of problems which have nothing
to do with forceps at all,'' said Drusin, an expert in high-risk
deliveries.
   Loffredo, 40, estimates he used forceps in 25 percent to 35
percent of the 1,500 births in his 10-year practice.
   David Stewart, executive director of the National Association of
Parents and Professionals for Safe Alternatives in Childbirth,
charges some doctors don't have the patience to wait during long
labors.
   ``We're not against any kind of technology when it's used
appropriately and for a good cause. Our organization objects when
it becomes routine,'' he said.
   ``Doctors are not trained to handle normal birth,'' he said.
``Forceps is a piece of the whole pathological orientation doctors
have.
   ``A good midwife has alternative ways to handle a difficult
birth. A good midwife never uses forceps.''
   Stewart and his Missouri-based organization believe the United
States should replace 90 percent of its obstetricians with midwives.
   ``That's utterly absurd'' to suggest obstetricians are impatient
and use forceps to speed up deliveries, said Kate Ruddon, a
spokeswoman for the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists in Washington, D.C.
   ``The data on infant mortality speaks for itself,'' Ruddon said,
citing figures that show the infant mortality rate fell from 47 per
1,000 live births in 1940 to 9.9 in 1987.
   In February, a West Viriginia jury awarded a couple $15.25
million after they claimed their obstetrician failed to perform a
Caesarean section to prevent brain damage to their child, instead
using forceps, causing a brain hemorrhage.
   In Anaheim, Calif., Dr. Charles Wesley Turner Jr. came under
scrutiny for using forceps to hasten delivery of a girl so she
could be displayed on national television as possibly his area's
first newborn of the year.
   A healthy six-pound, 12-ounce Myra Kristine Palmer was
officially delivered seconds after midnight, quickly cleaned,
wrapped in a blanket, stuffed into a Christmas stocking and dashed
to a religious service in a television studio next door.
   ``We had the mother push at 11:59,'' Turner said. ``I put the
forceps on and pulled the infant out. We had her at 15 seconds
after midnight.
   ``I used the forceps because I wanted to have the first baby of
the new year,'' said Turner.
   The California attorney general's office filed charges of gross
negligence and incompetence against Turner on Aug. 6. Prosecutors
want his license suspended or revoked.
   The doctor and Myra's father, Gary Palmer, insist Brigitte
Palmer went into labor prematurely and was sufficiently dilated to
begin delivery.
   ``There was nothing done that was wrong in this case,'' he said.
Turner, 64, said he used forceps in more than 5,000 of the more
than 18,000 babies he has delivered over 43 years.
   Palmer, 27, whose wife and daughter have had no complications
since the birth, said he trusts Turner, who also delivered Palmer's
first daughter.
   ``He's doing his best,'' Palmer said. ``I'd go to him for
anything from the common cold to major surgery.''

<HEAD>Community Plants Thousands of Trees on Treeless Bering Sea Island</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an age of shrinking forests, people
on the Bering Sea island of St. George are trying to extend the
forest's frontier, planting thousands of trees in a place where
even one is a novelty.
   The trees' chances of survival are uncertain, and some
environmentalists fear that introducing them to a treeless area may
harm existing species.
   But scientists backing the project disagree, as does Anthony
Merculief, president of the native corporation St. George Tanaq,
who suggested the idea to the Alaska Division of Forestry.
   ``I'd just like to see trees,'' he said. ``A lot of places have
trees. Why shouldn't we have a few of our own? I can't imagine
anybody not liking trees.''
   Recently, officials with the state agency and the U.S. Forest
Service planted about 2,500 Sitka spruce, Chinese larch and
lodgepole pine seedlings on land owned by the corporation on St.
George, one of the Pribilof Islands, about 225 miles north of the
Aleutians. (An additional thousand trees were left with villagers
to plant.)
   The officials were joined by St. George's 33 schoolchildren,
who, along with their successors, are charged with taking care of
the trees and sending progress reports to state foresters.
   ``Many of them have never seen trees before, although they see a
lot of it on TV,'' said Beverly Mierzejek, who teaches kindergarten
and first grade in the village of about 140 people.
   ``They're looking forward to seeing them grow. They say: `Well,
I'm going to be an old man before this thing's grown up. Our
grandkids will get to play on them and we can't.' ''
   Residents hope the trees will provide scenic beauty and also act
as windbreaks around homes. State and federal researchers plan to
set up research plots to study trees at high latitudes.
   Each child was given one tree to plant at home. A few hundred
seedlings will be planted around the town and about 2,000 are
marked for Garden Cove, a recreation area on the south side of the
island that includes a rare freshwater stream.
   About 100 more will be planted near an old Russian Orthodox
shrine, and another hundred or so at the site of an early
settlement, said Bill Beebe, who is spearheading the project for
the state forestry division.
   ``We can't guarantee they're going to have a big beautiful
forest, but we think most of the trees will do pretty well,'' said
Beebe. ``We were careful to pick the species with the best chances
for survival.''
   The Forest Service is contributing about $5,000 to the project
from its urban forestry program. The state paid about $500 for
2,000 larch trees; the Forest Service paid about $90 for 500 pines;
and the rest of the trees were free, Beebe said.
   The species were selected for hardiness in subarctic climates by
John Alden, a tree geneticist at the Forest Service's Institute of
Northern Forestry in Fairbanks.
   The St. George project may be the largest in a string of efforts
to plant trees in Alaska's Aleutian and Pribilof islands, Alden
said.
   As early as 1805, Russian fur traders tried planting a forest at
what is now Dutch Harbor in the Aleutians so they could have wood
for ships, fuel and homes, he said. About 24 trees were standing
there in 1830 _ four survive now.
   During World War II, the Army planted thousands of seedlings on
the Aleutian Island of Adak to boost morale. The ``forest'' now has
33 trees, none taller than 17 feet.
   Several years ago, Oregon-based ReTree International, a
non-profit group dedicated to reforestation, planted an unknown
number of trees on St. Paul, another Pribilof Island. Many were
believed smothered by snow or blown away.
   St. George has one spruce tree, although residents say it's more
of a shrub. Planted by an Orthodox priest in the churchyard a dozen
years ago, it stands stunted and bent, but alive.
   Alden estimates no more than 10 percent of the trees planted
over the years in the Aleutian Islands have survived the cold
temperatures and fierce wind.
   The Pribilofs, home to one of the largest sea bird and seal
concentrations in the Northern Hemisphere, have a mean monthly
growing-season temperature of 47 degrees, Alden said. Trees
generally need a mean of 50 degrees to grow straight, he said.
   Organizers say these trees might fare better than most, however,
partly because of the selected species and partly because of the
care they will get.
   Shelters will be constructed over the trees during their early
years, and some will be planted under tar paper to keep native
grasses from crowding out seedlings.
   Arctic fox may try to eat the seedlings and reindeer may trample
them, but it's too soon to know whether to take preventive
measures, Beebe said.
   ``They may have setbacks for a few years and many will gradually
recover,'' said Alden. ``They won't reach great height.''
   Beebe has asked the Alaska Center for the Environment for
comment on the program. The center's Cliff Ames doesn't know if the
center will object to the plan and said it may not have much
influence anyway because the trees will be planted on private land.
   ``But we generally would oppose the introduction of exotic
species because of the potential for environmental harm,'' he said.
   Alden disagreed.
   ``I don't know of a tree that's harmful,'' he said. ``And if any
tree turns out to be harmful, it's easy enough to solve the
problem. You could do it with an axe. The hard thing is to get them
to grow.''

<HEAD>Feeding Rats No Simple Task in Space Shuttle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rats orbiting Earth in the space shuttle
need a nutritionally complete food that won't break down or allow
flakes to weightlessly float around the module.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had the
technology for the food, but the deadlines, strict specifications
and relatively small orders kept major manufacturers from taking on
the project.
   NASA turned to the American Institute for Baking in Manhattan,
Kan., an industry- and government-supported center for research and
development of baked goods. The institute turned to Keith Behnke, a
Kansas State University food and feed researcher.
   The university is to make a batch of 1,500 bars for a flight
tentatively scheduled for January.
   One of Behnke's specialties is extrusion, which involves pumping
dough into molds.
   The rat food had to be in bars a little more than an inch wide,
about three-quarters of an inch thick and 16 inches long. ``They
had this device built and then they went out to find somebody that
would make the bar that would go into the device,'' Behnke said.
   A Wisconsin company made the vitamin- and mineral-fortified
feed. It is a mixture of wheat gluten, soy protein and wheat flour
that costs about $15 a pound.
   When complete, the bars have to be soft enough for a rat to gnaw
and rubbery enough to stick together so small pieces don't get
loose.
   ``They look like an odd-shaped gum eraser, have a nutty aroma
and taste pretty darn good,'' said Behnke.
   The powdered food is made into a sticky dough with the addition
of heat and water. The dough is extruded into molds about 10-feet
long. The molded bars are dried in trays until their moisture
content is about 20 percent.
   Because the university doesn't have special rooms for such
curing, the bars are dried in an air-conditioned classroom in the
grain science department.
   Hundreds of bars are being fed to rat colonies on Earth so they
become accustomed to the dispenser and the food.
   If the food is going to fly in space, the bars have to be milled
to exacting tolerances in the thousandths-of-an-inch range. That
milling takes about 15 minutes per bar and costs $45 an hour.
   The space bars are sealed in plastic and irradiated for storage.
   The finished bars cost $30 to $50 apiece, according to various
estimates.
   ``That seems extraordinary compared to what you might feed a rat
in a laboratory,'' Behnke said. ``But there's been a tremendous
effort to satisfy the conditions necessary for space.''

<HEAD>Big-Name Doctors Contracting To Provide Discount Services</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heart surgeon Denton A. Cooley is best known for
performing the world's first successful artificial heart implant
and the nation's first successful heart transplant.
   But he also has charted new medical business territory with
packaged pricing at discounted rates for heart operations and
cardiovascular treatment.
   Others are following his example.
   The Texas Heart Institute, a research organization Cooley
founded in 1962 and the base for his six-member heart surgery team,
signed its first contract with Tenneco, a Houston oil company, six
years ago. It has since negotiated 22 contracts with corporations
and insurance companies.
   Cooley said his version of discount heart surgery has been
inspired mostly by a desire to offer good, affordable health care.
   ``The medical directors of corporations and insurance companies
need help evaluating care people are receiving,'' Cooley said. ``I
wanted to give them a package at a reasonable cost. I wanted to
help eliminate abuse from the health care system.''
   Such deals also help Cooley and others who contract out, partly
by keeping their operating rooms full.
   ``If you do a high volume of heart surgery, you can do it less
expensively, and you can do it better,'' said Jeff Goldsmith, a
national health care adviser to the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young.
   Packaged pricing helps fend off competition from the growing
number of hospitals that do complicated procedures such as organ
transplants. For the companies, the motivation for choosing
recognized leaders is the old idea that ``practice makes perfect.''
   The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., known for its diagnostic
capabilities, sold its first package deal for organ transplants to
the insurance company Mutual of Omaha.

<HEAD>Dental School Buys Chewing Machine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tired of hearing all those horror stories
about plaque building up on your teeth, gum disease or the high
cost of keeping those pearly whites in shape?
   Chew on this: The University of Medicine and Dentistry of New
Jersey has purchased a mechanical mouth _ the second in the nation
_ that can simulate six months of human chewing in a single day.
   ``Devices such as the artificial mouth will help move dentistry
swiftly into the future, where low-cost, high-quality dental care
will be at a premium,'' said Dr. T.K. Vaidyanathan, director of the
dental school's biodental materials laboratory.
   ``It will help us develop materials that, potentially, can last
longer and perform better,'' Vaidyanathan said.
   Vaidyanathan said the $267,000 machine simulates the stress and
strain human munching places on teeth. The mouth can chew 20,000
times in two hours, or about a month of human eating, he said.
   Researchers also can flood the mouth's artificial teeth with the
chemical equivalent of saliva to determine corrosion and stain
resistance of materials. And they can also spray liquids as hot as
coffee or as cold as ice cream to determine how the materials are
affected by temperature changes.
   Researchers can check the results of the chewing and the liquid
baths anytime during the test by calling up a three-dimensional
profile of the teeth on a computer screen, officials said.
   Besides being quicker, the machine is more reliable, since human
volunteers in research must be checked about every six months and
``many times patients do not come back.''
   The University of Minnesota School of Dentistry and Material
Testing Systems Corp. of Minneapolis developed the first mechanical
mouth six years ago. The New Jersey school bought its machine from
the company.
   Vaidyanathan and other researchers are testing plastics,
ceramics and metal alloys for dentures, crowns and bridges. They
are looking for more resilient materials that bond better with
teeth to replace gold and amalgams of silver and mercury.

<HEAD>Plans for Beauty Salon TV Program on Indefinite Hold</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Murdoch Magazines has canceled its appointment
at the beauty parlor.
   Its plans to launch a commercially sponsored video service for
hair salons has been supended indefinitely because of the weak
advertising market, an executive overseeing the project said
Wednesday.
   The decision represents the most prominent setback to date in
the recent scramble to create new media through which advertisers
can reach narrowly targeted audiences.
   Recent ventures have included a commercial news show for teens
in the classroom, magazines and TV shows aimed at patients waiting
to see their doctors and TV shows for people in the grocery
checkout lane.
   Advertising experts say new ventures like these are most at risk
as companies cut back on ad spending plans as the economy weakens.
   Murdoch Magazines had announced plans for the video service it
called the Salon Network last February, saying it planned to have
its half-hour program running on television sets in at least 3,000
beauty parlors this summer.
   ``The response from the salons was encouraging,'' said Phillip
Cassidy, director of special projects for Murdoch Magazines. He
said about 1,500 salons had indicated a willingness to run the
shows which were to be repeated eight times a day and would carry
15 minutes of commercials each hour.
   But he said the outlook for ad spending by some entire
categories of advertisiers was so weak that the company decided to
put the project on hold indefinitely. ``It is not a good time to
launch new media,'' Cassidy said.
   Advertisers were being asked to pay $30,000 for a 30-second ad
that would have run eight times a day in each salon for a month.
   The ads would have appeared in an entertainment program that
included fashion and beauty features and other stories adapted for
video from the pages of the company's magazines which include
Mirabella, New Woman and Seventeen.
   Cassidy said the decision to suspend plans for the service was
made in June, although it wasn't publicized. He said he plans to
re-evaluate the situation in about six months.
   The move by Murdoch Magazines comes as Whittle Communications is
set to launch a new magazine designed for beauty parlors and
another media company, Communications Venture Group, is overhauling
its beauty parlor magazines.
   Whittle, based in Knoxville, Tenn., is sending the premiere
issue of its American Style magazine into 140,000 beauty parlors
nationwide this week.
   The oversized magazine, published every other month, has actress
Farrah Fawcett on the cover, stories on fashion, beauty, health and
style topics. The going rate for a full page is $150,000, said
Publisher Craige D. Johnson.
   Communications Venture Group, meanwhile, is consolidating its
six editions of Confetti magazine into a single edition starting
this fall.
   Confetti debuted last March with six separate editions devoted
to style, leisure, home, relationships, writing and personalities
and came out with a second wave of those magazines in late May.
   Unlike the Whittle plans to reach many thousands of salons, the
Confetti magazines are distributed to only about 4,000 beauty
parlors located in department stores or malls, where patrons are
presumably going to shop as soon as their hair is done.
   Publisher David W. Smith said the company decided to consolidate
into one edition because both advertisers and readers were confused
with having six different issues each publishing cycle.
   Confetti slashed its full-page ad rate for the single edition to
$9,500 from the previous $35,000 charge for a full-page ad in all
six editions.
   Johnson and Smith conceded the ad climate has made it tougher
for their new media ventures to sign advertisers. But they each
said they were confident their magazines would survive.

   Tons of Irish hamburger are stranded in Turkey. A
French potato cooperative stands to lose 10 percent of its sales.
An English company, stuck with four turbine generators that haven't
been paid for, is cutting 650 jobs.
   Far from the Persian Gulf, companies are feeling the sanctions
imposed on Iraq.
   The crisis has come just as Baghdad's credit rating appeared to
be recovering following the eight-year Iran-Iraq war. Now,
according to several experts interviewed on condition of anonymity,
there seems little hope that Iraq will soon repay its debts to
Western financiers.
   Iraq has the most debts of any Middle East country _ up to $80
billion by some estimates _ and Japan, Germany, France and Italy
standing to lose most if Iraq defaults, banking sources say.
   Iraqi debts, once relatively modest, rose quickly to finance the
1980-88 war with Iran, according to banking experts.
   ``Very soon after the war broke out they went into significant
default and loans from commercial banks ... virtually dried up,''
said one British banker. Surcharges on some loans were as high as
15 percent above the interest rate, and Iraq's debt spiraled out of
control, sources said.
   After the war, it was hoped Iraq's finances would improve. But
the existing debt proved overwhelming.
   The Export Credit Guarantee Department, the British government
body that insures loans to developing countries, said it stopped
covering deals with Iraq in April when Iraqi arrears started to
mount.
   It was this debt that helped bring on the invasion of oil-rich
Kuwait.
   ``Saddam was getting in a difficult position. There were
expectations of a higher standard of living but at the same time he
was stuck under a large debt with no signs of formal
rescheduling,'' said a British banker.
   Iraq refuses to join the Paris Club of debtor nations, which
sets up talks on multilateral rescheduling agreements. Also, says
one banker, Iraq does not hire Western experts to advise it on
debt. ``They're too proud for that,'' he said.
   On Aug. 1, an Iraqi delegation visited Rome for negotiations to
reschedule $900 million in overdue commercial export credits
guaranteed by the Italian government. Iraq has refused to pay
because an order of warships and helicopters was blocked by an
Italian arms embargo.
   Japanese trading and oil companies could lose more than $4
billion in debts owed by Iraq.
   ``The trading companies had targeted the Middle East as a big
growth area for the next five years. They were excited about
rebuilding . . . Iran and Iraq,'' said Alexander Muroncew, an
analyst for Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd. in Tokyo.
   The ultimate size of losses is unclear because Japanese
companies are reportedly taking steps to minimize losses, such as
withholding oil funds owed to Iraq.
   Japan was not alone in wanting to cash in on the postwar
reconstruction boom. European companies also were jockeying for
contracts right up to the invasion of Kuwait.
   Nor are large multinational corporations the only victims of the
crisis.
   Goodman International, Iraq's main Irish beef supplier, has a
consignment of hamburger and steaks lying in a Turkish warehouse.
According to a source close to the firm, Iraq owes it about $100
million.
   ``The money was being paid according to schedule, but stopped as
soon as this fracas started out there,'' the source said.
   At the NEI Parsons plant in northern England, work has stopped
on four turbine generators designed for Iraq's Al Shemal power
station, and 650 jobs have been cut.
   A cooperative of about 1,000 potato farmers based at Quimper,
Brittany, had a contract to deliver 15,000 tons of seed potatoes.
The harvest has begun and if shipments don't begin soon, the spuds,
worth about $8 million, will rot.
   Iraq is the cooperative's main export customer, accounting for
10 percent of sales.

   The Golden Arch Cafe serves up
old-fashioned Coke floats and Salisbury steak platters, no Big Macs
or McNuggets.
   But McDonald's Corp. is hoping this small-town spinoff from the
1950s will give the company a break in today's sluggish market for
fast food.
   McDonald's is stepping back in time _ and possibly creeping
toward a new franchise _ with a diner where you have to wait awhile
for the food but you get an ambience.
   With chrome-glass decor, neon lights, spin-seat counter stools,
cozy booths and a jukebox that blares '50s and '60s hits, the cafe
has been under secret development for two years, targeted at
communities with populations under 3,000. It debuted in this small
Tennessee town last week.
   ``Let's just call it the cafe of the '90s,'' said John
Charlesworth, vice president for McDonald's Nashville region.
``Small-town America is nostalgia. This place feels good, and this
concept feels good to me.''
   Aside from its name, which draws upon the famed golden arches
outside McDonald's outlets, there is little about the cafe to
suggest it is owned by the same people who introduced the world to
Quarter-Pounders with cheese.
   The typical menu fare includes a $2.99 Salisbury steak platter
with two vegetables, $3.99 lasagna, and Coke floats in real glasses
at $1.19. Burgers and fries are there, too, but without the
Mc-names.
   True, patrons must place their orders at a counter, similar to
the fast-food system. But afterward they find seats and cafe
workers dressed in 1950s-style bowling shirts serve them the food
on ceramic plates.
   ``I think it's great,'' said Bob Rickman, 57, a local contractor
lunching there during opening week. ``Hartsville needs it and I
hope they need Hartsville.''
   McDonald's executives said the Hartsville restaurant is the only
one planned for now.
   Charlesworth said the town was chosen because it represents the
model locale where such a restaurant could thrive, a small town
that can't generate enough business for a regular McDonald's.
Hartsville, population 2,674, is about 50 miles east of Nashville.
   ``This is an opportunity to go places we normally might not
go,'' Charlesworth said.
   The cafe's premiere was news to some analysts and competitors,
who scrutinize everything McDonald's does because it shapes trends
in the industry.
   ``Sounds like a New Jersey diner to me,'' said Joseph Doyle, a
fast-food strategist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New
York. He said the concept puzzled him, partly because it's so
limited. ``If this thing works, why would they keep it just in the
small towns?''
   At least one McDonald's rival wasn't impressed.
   ``What you're going to have is a McNightmare,'' predicted John
Merritt, spokesman for Hardee's Food Systems Inc. ``They are the
masters at what they do well, but when they get out of the coloring
lines, it doesn't work as well.''
   Hardee's calls itself the dominant fast-food restaurant in towns
under 10,000. The company's research shows customers go to
fast-food restaurants in small towns for the same reasons as people
in the city, Merritt said.
   The cafe's debut comes at a time of slow sales for McDonald's,
which has unsettled some investors and industry experts because the
company historically has been considered one of the country's most
successful businesses.
   John Maxwell Jr., a securities analyst who follows the business
for Wheat First Butcher &amp; Singer in Richmond, Va., said he wasn't
surprised McDonald's would try a new concept. The company has been
experimenting for years, from breakfast to pizza to salad bars.
Some have endured while others have been quietly dropped.
   ``McDonald's has tried about everything under the sun,'' Maxwell
said. The cafe concept ``may or may not signal a new direction for
them.''

<HEAD>With Much Fanfare, IBM To Announce New Mainframe Computers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   IBM next week will make one of its largest
new-product announcements ever, unveiling powerful mainframe
computers that will be its top-of-the-line machines this decade,
industry analysts say.
   The success of the new computers is crucial to the world's
largest computer company because about half its profit comes from
mainframe machines and associated software and equipment.
   ``It's a very major deal,'' said Jim Cassell, a vice president
at Gartner Group Inc., a high-technology research firm in Stamford,
Conn.
   The new machines also are important to IBM from a prestige and
competitive standpoint.
   The two major makers of IBM-compatible mainframes, Hitachi Data
Systems Corp. and Amdahl Corp. _ both partly Japanese-owned _ are
planning major upgrades of their models. In fact, Hitachi beat IBM
to the punch, announcing its next-generation mainframes in June.
   Hitachi and Amdahl historically have undercut IBM's prices, and
their share of the U.S. mainframe market has been growing while
IBM's has slipped in recent years. Still, IBM commands about 87
percent of the U.S. high-end mainframe market, according to
Computer Intelligence, a La Jolla, Calif., research firm.
   The new high-end IBM machines, code named the Summit line, are
expected to provide twice the computing power of IBM's current
top-of-the-line mainframes, the 3090 series, which debuted in 1985.
   International Business Machines Corp. also is expected to
announce replacement models for two of its less-powerful mainframe
lines.
   IBM won't disclose details about the news conference it called
for next Wednesday, but company spokesmen have compared its
importance to the 1964 unveiling of IBM's 360 mainframe line,
considered a milestone in the computer industry.
   IBM has even rented a special Amtrak train to take reporters
from New York to the announcement site at its mainframe factory in
Poughkeepsie, N.Y., about 80 miles north.
   Mainframes typically are used by large corporations such as
airlines and insurance companies. They must be quick enough to
provide instant information to telephone representatives and large
enough to hold vast numbers of customer records.
   The Summit machines will feature fiber-optic lines to link the
computers to data-storage devices, analysts say. Fiber-optic lines,
which transmit information in beams of laser light, can move data
to the computer's processor at about twice the rate of the standard
electrical lines used on the 3090s, helping speed processing.
   The Summit line initially will come in two versions. One will
have two linked processors that will calculate about 160 million
instructions per second, or mips, said Cassell. The second version
will have six linked processors and run at about 230 mips, he said.
   By contrast, IBM's current six-processor mainframe, its most
powerful machine, runs at about 112 mips.
   In addition, IBM plans to provide the means to link several of
the mainframes to act as one giant computer, Cassell said.
   The Summit announcement also is expected to feature a broader
IBM plan to provide ways to link its mainframe computers with
personal computers and other models to share computing capacity in
a network, Cassell said.
   While the Summit represents a major advance, analysts say the
machines will face several hurdles.
   In addition to competition from Hitachi and Amdahl, the
computers must buck a trend in corporations to rely less on
mainframes and more on desk-top models connected in a network.
   ``As applications are migrated from the mainframe onto smaller
platforms, firms will no longer require the additional mips or
capacity that Summit promises to deliver,'' predicts Forrester
Research Inc., a high-tech consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass.
   Another problem is that Summit models are not expected to be
available until the second half of 1991. That lag could cause
customers to defect to competitiors or postpone orders that would
have gone to 3090s, hurting IBM's revenues.
   ``We think that's going to be a difficult marketing exercise for
IBM over the next 12 months,'' said Cassell, a former IBM mainframe
marketing executive.
   To limit postponed orders, IBM plans to announce an interim
Summit model that contains fiber-optic connections and other
enhancements but uses the 3090 processor, said Rick Martin, an
analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. The machine later could
be upgraded to full Summit technology, he said.
   A successful Summit launch is important for IBM because
mainframes, which cost millions of dollars, represent one of the
last high-profit computer lines, analysts say.
   Profit margins on mid-sized and personal computers have shrunk
as the machines have become standardized, making them more like a
commodity in which price, not necessarily brand name, is the
determining factor in a purchasers' mind.
   However, mainframes are not as important to IBM as they once
were. Revenues from personal computers and mid-sized models have
increased sharply over the past decade.

   Despite the absence of two members, OPEC
held together through critical talks that resulted in allowing
higher production to offset lost Kuwaiti and Iraqi crude during the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``The essential target was . . . to save and keep OPEC,'' said
the cartel's president, Sadek Boussena. ``I think we have achieved
it.''
   Boussena, who is the Algerian oil minister, made his remarks
Wednesday after the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries authorized Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and others to produce
as much extra oil as possible during the Gulf standoff.
   ``At least it shows OPEC is still capable of taking a
decision,'' said Peter Bogin, associate director for oil markets at
Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Paris. ``They did what they
could. If they had done less, OPEC would have been something from a
bygone era.''
   Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, friendly to U.S. interests, wanted
to help offset the loss of about 4 million barrels a day of
embargoed Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil. The sanctions were imposed after
Baghdad's occupation of fellow OPEC member Kuwait.
   Saudi Arabia had vowed to boost production, with or without the
cartel's consent. In response, 10 of 11 ministers attending
informal talks in Vienna agreed to suspend temporarily the group's
quota system to allow the output increases by nation's with spare
capacity.
   OPEC last month set production at 22.5 million barrels per day
for the rest of 1990.
   Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh protested that the
Western nations should do more to help themselves by opening up
their stocks. Iraq and Libya didn't attend the discussions, but
ministers felt the organization emerged intact from what could have
been a bruising round of talks.
   Ecuador's oil minister, Diego Tamariz, said the new accord
``will help to maintain the unity of OPEC.''
   ``We have succeeded fairly well,'' Indonesian Oil Minister
Ginandjar Kartasasmita said. He said descriptions of the
organization as an early victim of the gulf tensions were wrong.
   With prospects for more oil, crude prices plunged. On the New
York Mercantile Exchange, futures prices for the benchmark U.S.
grade tumbled Wednesday by $1.96 a barrel to $25.92. They had
soared last week above $32 a barrel, a mark untouched since the
mid-1980s.
   Analysts predicted the injection of about 3 million barrels of
OPEC crude into the world market could help hold down prices in the
next few weeks. But they cautioned prices could soar again with
worries about Gulf hostilities and rising demand for oil in the
winter.
   ``The market may pull back some but the trend continues to
remain on the up side as long as the military option in the Gulf
remains a viable one,'' said Michael Rothman, an energy specialist
at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York.
   Bogin said gasoline prices at the pump should hold steady as
long as crude prices do. Every dollar rise _ or decline _ in the
price of a barrel of oil amounts to a 2-cent to 5-cent change in
gasoline prices.
   Pump prices have risen by 23 cents to more than $1.30 a gallon
for self-serve unleaded gasoline at U.S. stations since Aug. 1,
according to the American Automobile Association.
   The new OPEC accord was a delayed response to Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait. Saudi Arabia and Venezuela had been rebuffed in
an earlier request for an emergency meeting of all 13 OPEC nations.
   Instead, Boussena traveled to Vienna for informal consultations,
beginning last Sunday, with anyone who wanted to talk to him. Their
discussions led to the carefully worded statement that gave Saudi
Arabia and Venezuela the go-ahead to pump more oil.

<HEAD>Three Settle Insider Trading Charges in Prime Computer Stock</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three former MAI Basic Four Inc. workers
accused of trading on inside information about the computer
company's planned acquisition of Prime Computer Inc. have settled
with federal regulators.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission said Wednesday that Dale
T. Jabour, Ronald Lee Thurman and Winston M. Cheong settled civil
insider trading charges Wednesday without admitting or denying any
wrongdoing.
   But Cheong and Thurman's attorney branded the action a
``travesty'' because the alleged illegal profits of his clients,
between $1,875 and $3,830, were ``miniscule.''
   Jabour, 36, of Santa Ana, Calif., former director of accounting
at MAI Basic, was accused of buying Prime call options in November
1988 after overhearing two MAI Basic executives discuss the Tustin,
Calif., company's negotiations to acquire Prime.
   Federal securities law forbids company employees from trading on
market sensitive information that they know, or should know, is
confidential. Those who do are said to be violating their fiduciary
duty to their employer.
   Prime, based in Natick, Mass., was acquired in August 1989 by
J.H. Whitney &amp; Co. after MAI Basic's hostile takeover bid was
rebuffed.
   Jabour was accused of passing the information to Thurman, 37, of
Orange, Calif., MAI's director of financial planning, and Cheong,
31, of Costa Mesa, Calif., a staff business analyst. They, in turn,
also bought Prime call options.
   A call option is a right, but not an obligation, to buy 100
shares of a security at a fixed price at a later date. Buying call
options is a market strategy that allows an investor who thinks a
company's stock is going to rise dramatically to make a profit on a
small investment.
   Before the SEC action, Jabour returned his $21,800 in alleged
illegal profits to the people who sold him their Prime options. As
part of the settlement, he also must pay another $21,800 in fines.
   ``He suffered a great deal. He lost his job, it cost him a lot
and he's glad to have it behind him,'' said Jabour's Los Angeles
attorney, James W. Mercer.
   Thurman will have to pay a total of $3,750 in restitution and
fines and Cheong, $7,660.
   ``Both my clients settled because they couldn't afford the
lengthy litigation,'' said Los Angeles attorney Robert C. Rosen,
who called the case ``a travesty.''
   ``Although both of them settled, they made such miniscule
amounts,'' he said. ``My personal belief is that the SEC should
allocate its resources in other ways.''

<HEAD>Boesky Connection Led To Downfall of Guinness Defendants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUE LEEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four businessmen convicted in Britain's biggest
financial scandal in decades shared a fatal flaw with some
white-collar lawbreakers in America: They knew Ivan Boesky.
   Boesky, the former arbitrager whose alleged lawbreaking set new
standards for Wall Street corruption, reportedly told U.S.
authorities about alleged illegal action at Guinness PLC after his
1986 arrest.
   A published report here gave new details about Boesky's
connection with the case, which resulted this week in prison terms
in an illegal scheme to help the brewery company take over a
Scottish drinks company. One of the terms was longer than Boesky's
three-year sentence.
   Boesky reportedly told police he was introduced to Guinness by
Gerald Ronson, who was convicted Monday with three others on
charges including stock manipulation, theft, false accounting and
destroying documents.
   Their trial centered on Guinness' attempt to artifically boost
its share price during a takeover battle with the food group Argyll
for Scottish liquor makers Distillers Co. Guinness' $5.26 billion
bid was successful.
   Former Guinness chairman and chief executive Ernest Saunders was
sentenced Tuesday to five years and former stockbroker Anthony
Parnes to 2{ years for their part in the illegal share manipulation
operation.
   Ronson was sentenced to one year in prison and given the biggest
fine in British history, 5 million pounds, or $9.75 million, for
what the judge called ``an attack on the integrity of the market.''
   Sentencing of millionaire financier Sir Jack Lyons, 74, was
postponed until Sept. 25, after he recovers from surgery.
   According to Boesky, Ronson first contacted him about the
Distillers bid in early April 1986 and assured him that Guinness
would ``repay any losses'' incurred in the deal, the Independent
newspaper reported Tuesday.
   The report said Boesky later struck an deal with an American
lawyer who served as a non-executive director of Guinness that he
would be reimbursed by Guinness for losses on any share dealings
connected with the bid.
   He would also receive a monthly kickback fee of 5 percent on any
sums invested, acording to the newspaper, which said its report was
based on notes from an interview British police held with Boesky in
New York on Nov. 17, 1987.
   By April 19, 1986, the day after Guinness won control of
Distillers, Boesky had built up a holding of 14 million Guinness
shares at a cost of around $80 million, The Independent said.
   According to the newspaper, Boesky told the American lawyer, Tom
Ward, that he lost $30 million after investing $1.1 million in
support of the Distillers bid. Ward faces charges in Britain
stemming from the Guinness case and has been fighting extradition
after his October arrest in Washington.
   The newspaper said Ward accepted the losses and suggested that
Guinness reward Boesky by giving him a California vineyard or
selling him property that had been undervalued.
   But at Boesky's suggestion, Guinness agreed against financial
advice to invest $100 million dollars in Boesky's limited
partnership, The Independent said.
   Boesky's agreement to cooperate with U.S. and British
authorities reportedly included a promise that he would not be
proesecuted in Britain. No charges have been brought against him in
Britain.
   The newspaper said details of Boesky's role in the Guinness case
were obtained from ``confidential documents not disclosed during
the Guinness trial.''
   Boesky pleaded guilty to one felony count for lying to federal
investigators and paid $100 million in penalties to settle the
biggest insider trading case in U.S. history. He was released in
April 4 after serving two-thirds of his prison term.
   Saunders and three other Britons are to stand trial later this
year on further charges arising from the Guinness affair.

<HEAD>Bank of Japan Boost Discount Rate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI YAMAGUCHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Japanese financial markets cheered the Bank of
Japan's decision today to raise its key discount lending rate to 6
percent in a bid to curb inflation resulting from rising oil prices
during the Middle East crisis.
   The announcement came one day after the central bank ruled out
rumors in local media that a rate hike was imminent. The increase
in the discount rate from 5.25 percent is the second this year and
fifth since May 1989.
   The discount rate, the interest charged by the central bank on
its loans to commercial banks, has a strong influence on other
interest rates.
   Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno told a news conference that
higher oil prices added to already worrisome domestic inflationary
pressures, prompting the central bank to act to slow inflation and
stabilize the nation's financial markets.
   ``Taking precautionary measures is very important for Japan,
whose economic performance has such influence on the rest of the
world,'' Mieno said. ``We have to prevent domestic inflationary
pressures from growing further in order not to disturb the world
economy.''
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average had
plunged 4,575.22 points, or 15 percent, since Iraq invaded Kuwait
on Aug. 2.
   Higher rates are expected to slow business capital expenditures
and cool economic growth, and also generally discourage stock
investments.
   But stock traders reacted positively to the central bank action
anyway.
   The Nikkei index rose 775.17 points, or 3.11 percent, today to
close at 25,669.96. The index had shed 815.97 points on Wednesday
following media speculation about a possible rate increase.
   Yasuo Miyakawa, an analyst with Sumitomo Bank, said the rate
hike had already been factored into the market.
   Miyakawa said the higher discount rate ``may not be an immediate
remedy for the economy, but it could be psychologically effective
in discouraging speculative trading in reaction to the recent surge
in oil prices.''
   Although higher oil prices will not start influencing consumer
prices until October, he said, ``both the timing and the amount of
increase was reasonable.''
   Japan is seen as being particularly vulnerable to oil price
hikes because it imports nearly all of its oil.
   The rate hike also makes yen-denoninated investments more
attractive to foreigners by reducing the gap between Japanese rates
and those in other countries. In the United States, for instance,
the Federal Reserve's discount rate is 7 percent.
   Shun Ishihara, chief of the Japan Committee for Economic
Development, a major business organization, welcomed the rate hike,
the second this year following a March 20 increase to 5.25 percent.
   ``The latest discount rate is appropriate to stem inflation,
because the Middle East situation looks like it will last a long
time,'' he said in a statement.
   However, Minister of International Trade and Industry Kabun Muto
spoke out against the rate hike.
   Muto said the central bank should have waited to raise the
discount rate because price increases had not been extreme.
   ``The discount rate hike this time was the fifth in a series and
the pace (of their introduction) has been rather quick. Therefore,
MITI has thought the action should have been taken very
carefully,'' he said in a statement.
   Thursday's action was the fifth interest rate hike since May 31,
1989, when the bank raised its discount rate for the first time in
two years, lifting it to 3.25 percent from 2.5 percent.

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. has extended the shutdown of
its Willow Run assembly plant until after Labor Day, citing excess
inventory of new Chevrolet Caprice cars.
   About 4,200 workers are affected by the action, GM spokeswoman
Kathy Tanner said Wednesday. Some of those workers may stay on the
job maintaining equipment during the production halt.
   The shutdown was called to balance production with sales.
   The plant west of Detroit began making the full-size, 1991-model
cars in January. GM also began making Caprices in June at
Arlington, Texas.
   The Willow Run shutdown is in its third week and began shortly
after Iraq invaded Kuwait, forcing the cancellation of an order
destined for the region. The order was for about two weeks' worth
of production at the plant.

   Peering into a 21st century mirror, the Chicago
Board of Trade sees itself with an electronic trading system that
still has the immediacy of the hand-waving and yelling in the pits.
   It also sees new futures products, new members and new capital.
   Those are some of the goals listed in a report released by the
exchange Wednesday.
   ``As the world continues to change and competition in our
markets increases, the Chicago Board of Trade will face many new
challenges and opportunities,'' said chairman William F. O'Connor.
``As an institution, we must be prepared to act boldly to meet the
changes head-on.''
   The report was prepared by a task force headed by Robert S.
Hamada, deputy dean of the University of Chicago business school.
   It concluded that paperless trading is essential to the future
of pit trading, and recommended that the exchange pursue
technologies that allow paperless trading.
   The Board of Trade should use electronic systems that most
closely duplicate the open outcry auction trading, the study
concluded. The task force contended that the auction system adds to
the liquidity of the market.
   The Board of Trade is currently negotiating with its cross-town
rival, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, to join in the Globex
trading system developed by the Merc. But the task force said that
should not interfere with experimentation with the AURORA trading
system being developed by the CBOT.
   The report also said the CBOT must pursue a diverse set of new
futures because of the advantage of being first to launch a product
and because of the intense competition in the futures industry.
   The study noted that despite the introduction of a number of new
trading products in recent years, 51 percent of the exchange's
volume comes from Treasury bond futures.
   The task force also recommended better incentive systems to
attract members and capital to new products. The study concluded
that a mix of capital pools, permits, fee rebates and electronic
trading systems should be developed and used to accomplish the goal.
   Also, the current trading floor for financial futures is
overcrowded, and that the exchange should consider all alternatives
in remedying the problem, the study said.
   The forward-looking report comes as the exchange battles some
present-day problems. The Board of Trade and the Mercantile
Exchange received a black eye when an investigation into illegal
trading activity resulted in the indictment of 48 people.
   The exchange is also faced with a desire by regulators in
Washington to increase federal oversight of the commodities
industry. Industry leaders say that could reduce the
competitiveness of U.S. futures market at a time of increased
foreign competition.
   To meet the competition, the task force recommended that the
exchange delegate authority at all levels of its bureaucracy to
allow it to make quicker and bolder decisions. The study said such
a move would allow the exchange's leaders to focus on broad policy
issues and not on operational details.

   Federal futures regulators have launched
administrative actions against Refco Inc., a Chicago futures
brokerage firm, and one of its floor brokers.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said Wednesday that
Refco settled _ without admitting or denying wrongdoing _ a
seven-count administrative complaint at the same time it was
issued, and agreed to pay a $220,000 fine.
   Also named in the complaint was Ray E. Friedman, of Palm Beach,
Fla., a Refco principal and registered floor broker at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, who did not settle the charges.
   He faces penalties ranging from $100,000 fines for each alleged
violation to banishment from the industry, if the CFTC charges are
proved.
   ``Mr. Friedman is not going to settle,'' said his attorney,
Ronald Filler. ``We deny the charges and we intend to vigorously
defend against the alleged violations.''
   In an unrelated matter, the CFTC began administrative action
against a soybean trader who pleaded guilty to improper trading
practices after he was indicted last year in an FBI undercover
operation at the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The complaint against Refco alleged that for a year beginning in
June 1988, Friedman, in ``an express or implied agreement or
understanding'' with a Refco customer, violated Merc limits on how
many open contracts in pork belly futures could be traded by one
person who is speculating rather than hedging.
   A speculator trades commodity futures to profit from
anticipating price movements while a hedger tries to minimize risk
by taking offsetting positions in both the cash and futures markets.
   Refco also was charged with not maintaining written records of
Friedman's records, failing to supervise him properly and violating
two previous orders by the CFTC to maintain better records and
supervision.
   ``We intend to enforce exchange speculator limits and we also
intend to enforce cease and desist orders,'' said Dennis Klejna,
the CFTC's director of enforcement.
   In addition to the $220,000 civil penalty, Refco agreed to
review its procedures for overseeing trading personnel and to
submit a written report to the CFTC with 120 days.
   In the other action, the CFTC accused Craig LaCrosse of
non-competitive trading by helping another broker enter a false
record of a customer order and by phony sales.
   He was one of 45 traders at the CBOT and Merc indicted on
fraud-related charges last year. Last August LaCrosse, who pleaded
guilty to two criminal counts, admitted accepting an illegal
pre-arranged trade.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prices of oil and petroleum products
rebounded this morning as traders started thinking peace in the
Persian Gulf was not as likely as it had seemed a day earlier.
   Several pieces of news from the Middle East were ``throwing a
little skepticism into the peace mood,'' said Brian Tagler, a
broker with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   In early trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, light
sweet crude oil rose $1.08 per barrel to $27 for October delivery.
On Wednesday, crude had fallen about $2 per barrel as traders had
responded to increased OPEC production and speculated on the
possibility of a diplomatic solution to the oil crisis.
   Unleaded gasoline rose 4.53 cents to 89.25 cents per gallon for
September delivery by late morning. Home heating oil was up 3.36
cents to 75 cents per gallon, also on September contracts.
   Natural gas was up from $1.505 to $1.525 per 1,000 cubic feet,
for October delivery. Other contract months were also up for the
Merc petroleum futures.
   Tagler said oil prices were back on the rise as traders
responded to news that Iraq was failing to proceed with its
previously announced release of Western hostages.
   The delay by one day of a planned meeting between U.N.
General-Secretary Javier Perez de Cuellar and Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz was also helping to quash any speculation about
a peaceful solution to the crisis that began with Iraq's invasion
of neighboring Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The two had planned to meet today in Jordan, but U.N. officials
in New York said today that the meeting would instead be held
Friday.
   When oil prices tumbled on Wednesday, the market was responding
in part to reports that the U.N.-Iraqi meeting might feature an
offer by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to back off from his claim to
Kuwait. But in an interview on CBS Wednesday night, Saddam denied
such reports.

<HEAD>Weak Demand Send Grain, Soybean Prices Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures were lower in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The drop in prices extends selling seen in Wednesday's weak
close.
   The National Weather Service's six- to 10-day forecast is also
putting pressure on futures. The forecast calls for warmer and
drier-than-normal weather for most of the Midwest.
   A lack of cash buying interest is contributing to the market
selloff, says Jerry Zusel, an analyst with Balfour Maclaine Corp.
in Chicago. He said corn was under additional pressure from an
increase in producer selling.
   In early trading, wheat was 1{ cents to 2} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $2.73} a bushel; corn was a {
cent to 1} cents lower with September at $2.49\ a bushel; oats were
} cent to 2 cents lower with September at $1.03{ a bushel; and
soybeans were 2 cents lower to } cent higher with September at
$6.04{ a bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures were higher in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live hog futures were boosted by increased retail pork demand
and firming cash prices.
   Cattle futures were higher on commission-house and professional
buying, and on the perception that the market had been oversold.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .25 cent higher with October at
76.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .08 cent to .33 cent higher
with August at 88.85 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .23 cent
higher with October at 49.05 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were unchanged to .30 cent higher with February at 52.60 cents a
pound.
   Livestock futures settled lower and pork futures were higher in
Wednesday's trading.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper report said Thursday that Donald
Trump planned to sell the Plaza Hotel in an effort to raise cash,
but a spokeswoman for the developer denied the report.
   ``Absolutely not. It's not true,'' said Norma Foederer, a
spokeswoman for The Trump Organization. ``I don't know where they
got that story.''
   The New York Times reported that people close to the Trump
Organization say Trump is pushing for a sale of the Plaza. The
developer would need the cash to meet a Nov. 15 deadline for a
$47.3 million interest payment on Taj Mahal casino bonds, the Times
said.
   According to the Times, several international buyers are
considering a deal for the Plaza. The Manhattan luxury hotel could
be sold before the end of October, the Times said.
   The Plaza, which is run by his estranged wife Ivana, is one of
Trump's major assets and one of the few which could sell for a
profit, the Times quoted a financial study as saying.
   Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co., which was hired by Trump at the request
of his bankers, estimated the Plaza could sell for $450 million to
$550 million. Trump carries a $413 million debt on the property,
the Times said.

<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with late European prices and rates plus
midday New York quotes.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar rose against most major currencies
in active European trading today.
   Gold also rose but trading was light.
   Most dollar activity resulted from the Bank of Japan's decision
to raise its discount rate to 6 percent from 5.25 percent, London
dealers said.
   That prompted a surge of Japanese yen buying and heavy German
mark sales as investors unloaded marks to buy yen. Dollar buyers
jumped into the market after the dollar rose through 1.5600 marks
as a result of the move from mark to yen.
   Dealers said this gave the dollar a much-needed boost only days
after the U.S. currency hit a post-World War II low of 1.5385 marks
on Monday.
   Although the saber rattling has diminished between the United
States and Iraq over Iraq's annexation of Kuwait, West German
traders said they remain nervous.
   The market could swing either way, depending on the news from
the Middle East, they said.
   But some London dealers said the dollar's new-found strength may
be short-lived given the weak condition of the U.S. economy.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 144.10 Japanese yen from
144.35 yen at Wednesday's close. Later, in London, it rose to
144.25 yen. In early trading in the New York afternoon, the dollar
was quoted at 144.37 yen.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.9225f from $1.9475 late
Wednesday. A pound fetched $1.9150 around midday in New York.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's levels were: 1.5675 West German marks, up from 1.5562;
1.2950 Swiss francs, up from 1.2740; 5.2492 French francs, up from
5.2170; 1.7645 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7525; 1,160.50 Italian
lire, up from 1.151.50; and 1.1455 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1385.
   Selected rates for the dollar in early afternoon in New York
included: 1.5695 German marks; 1.30075 Swiss francs; 1.1465
Canadian dollars; and 1,163.00 Italian lire.
   Zurich gold dealers said there was a feeling in the market that
the Gulf crisis could still worsen.
   Many investors still saw gold as a ``safe haven'' and this had
helped to boost the metal after it opened in Europe to around $385
an ounce.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $389.60 a troy ounce
from $385.25 bid late Wednesday.
   In Zurich, the metal rose to a closing bid of $389.05 from
$384.25 late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $4.06 to close at a bid of
$385.28.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid of $4.86 dollars a
troy ounce from $4.83 late Wednesday.

<HEAD>The Fed's Dilemma</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Already affected by the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait, the U.S. economy now could come under the influence of
events unfolding in Japan.
   While some will see this latter event simply as additional
evidence that the global economy is really here rather than just
emerging, others will view it primarily as still another dilemma
for the Federal Reserve.
   Japan this week raised its discount rate, a basic interest rate,
for the fifth time in just over a year, putting it at more than
double the 2.5 percent level that existed in May 1989.
   An increase of that size could disrupt investments worldwide,
and many of those investments are Japanese. And as rates rise in
their own country, many Japanese might be inclined to call their
money back home.
   Much of that money is in United States investments, attracted
there by the safety factor but also, of course, because of the high
returns. U.S. rates had been generally higher than those in Japan
and many other countries.
   What should the Fed do? It could allow U.S. rates to creep
higher to compete with the Japanese, but to do so might be the
cause of a U.S. recession. Already close to recession, the domestic
economy needs lower, not higher rates.
   In fact, a widespread impression existed here that the Fed might
ease a bit in order to avoid negative growth. Even slightly lower
rates, it was reasoned, might spur enough economic activity to keep
the expansion alive.
   That was before Iraq and Kuwait, however. The Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait hit the U.S. economy right in its industrial gut by forcing
up energy costs. And higher energy costs can translate quickly into
higher prices in general.
   With the United States economy on the very edge of recession,
the Fed could hardly afford to raise rates. Neither could it afford
to ignore the threat of renewed inflation coming from the higher
prices for imported oil.
   The traditional Federal Reserve technique for dealing with
inflation has been higher interest rates, but that option seems to
be denied it this time. Besides, how could higher interest rates
control prices set by foreigners?
   The result has been a stalemate; the Fed has taken no
substantial action to deal with higher prices, nor perhaps can it.
   That situation clearly was enough to deal with, but now comes
the Japanese threat, and similarly it leaves the Fed without
options. Will Japanese money return home? Or, in these insecure
times, stay where it is most secure?
   The latter consideration is a genuine one, although how much
foreign money it involves is unknown. It is known that big
investors in Europe and Japan are willing to pay a price for
security, which the U.S. market represents.
   In a sense, the current dilemma of the Federal Reserve does
illustrate the existence of a global economy . . .
   . . . at least in the sense that more of the monetary decisions
seem to be made abroad these days than at home, leaving the Federal
Reserve with fewer options than it used to have.

   Wall Street reversed course today following four
winning sessions as oil prices rose and pessimism about the Middle
East tensions increased.
   The Dow Jones industrial average, up 149.01 points since last
Friday, was off 23.52 to 2,608.91 at 2 p.m.
   The broader market was also lower. Losers outnumbered gainers by
a margin of about 8 to 5 in nationwide trading of New York Stock
Exchange-listed issues, with 506 up, 860 down and 544 unchanged.
   The market turned weak as the price of oil rose and interest
rates climbed in the bond market. The near-term price of light,
sweet crude was up $1.36 a gallon to $27.28 in mid-afternoon, while
the yield on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond climbed to 8.98
percent.
   Analysts said traders remained reluctant to make big
commitments, out of fear of unpredictable events in the showdown in
the Persian Gulf.
   Reports that Iraq has set new conditions for allowing foreigners
to leave the country increased pessimism about the crisis.
   In addition, brokers said the market had to contend with
still-increasing worries about a possible recession.
   Surveys designed to measure confidence among consumers showed
sharp declines for August, suggesting to some that expectations of
a business slump might tend to become self-fulfilling.
   Losers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, down { at
45; General Electric, down } aman Janet Kraybill. ``There
are purple ones and pink ones, and some are even larger than a
postage stamp.''
   Postal Service cancelling machines are supposed to check whether
postage on a letter has a phosphorus coating, but sometimes don't
catch all bogus stamps on the 530 million pieces of mail processed
daily, Shealy said.
   This marks the second time Trudeau's stamps have troubled the
agency. A Sunday comic strip in May featured Zonker Harris in two
sullen poses on drawings that resembled stamps. Both had ``U.S.
Protest'' written above Zonker and showed a value of minus-5 cents.
One stamp said, ``Mad As Heck'' and the other said, ``Ticked Off.''
Postal officials said a few letters showed up with the drawings
attached.
   The drawings were protesting the Postal Service's request for a
5-cent increase in the 25 cents postage rate.
   ``We don't think for a minute that he is asking people to use
these stamps as a replacement for a stamp,'' Shealy said. ``He used
his artistic license to protest and he chose to do it by using a
postage stamp.''
   Carol Larson, a spokeswoman for the Postal Service's South
Jersey Division, said a postmaster called her last week to report
finding a letter with one of the stamps.
   Mail with a bogus stamp is returned to the sender, or is sent
postage due if a return address is not on the envelope. It also
might wind up in the dead letter bin.
   Shealy said the Postal Service will investigate the use of bogus
stamps, which is illegal.
   Lee Salem, a spokesman for Universal Syndicate, Trudeau's agent
and distributor of his comic strips, said he could not reach
Trudeau for comment.

<HEAD>Weyerhaeuser Sues Over Investment Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A forest products company whose retirement fund
lost more than $35 million in investment funds has filed a lawsuit
against the limited partnership where the funds were placed.
   The lawsuit was filed this week in U.S. District Court by
Weyerhaeuser Co. of Tacoma, Wash. Weyerhaeuser claims its
retirement fund lost the $35 million invested as a limited partner
in Hedged Securites Associates Inc.
   Hedged Securities lost more than $100 million earlier this month
after allegedly taking excessive positions in options on UAL Corp.
while the holding company for United Airlines was being considered
as a takeover or buyout candidate.
   Partnership officials only last week revealed the massive losses
to stunned investors.
   The lawsuit alleges the partnership's manager, James Donahue,
said the options were covered to minimize risk, but trading records
indicate they were not.
   According to the complaint, Donahue promised Weyerhaeuser the
partnership would hedge its investments, but Donahue instead sold
off other investments late last year to invest more in UAL stock,
hoping it would rise.
   Instead, the stock price fell when an employee buyout of United
fell through and Donahue was unable to cover his position quickly
enough, the lawsuit claimed.
   A Donahue lawyer, Bob Dill, said Hedged Securities is likely to
file for bankruptcy reorganization this week, a move that could
nullify the lawsuit.
   On Wednesday, a state judge put off a Hedged Securities investor
motion to force the partnership into receivership.

   Share prices rose Thursday on the London Stock
Exchange as uncertainty over the Middle East crisis eased its grip
on the London market.
   Wall Street's steady decline from its opening shook some of the
strength from the London market, which reached its peak near midday.
   The volume of trade rose sharply Thursday. But traders said
there was still little business around.
   At the close, the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 27.9 points, or 1.3 percent, at 2,153.6.
   The narrower Financial Times 30-share index closed up 29 points
at 1,687.9. The Financial Times 500 index closed up 14.11 at
1,154.45.
   Volume on Thursday was 382.7 million shares, well above
Wednesday's level of 297.3 million shares.

<HEAD>Cartoon Characters Return to Airwaves in Rap Commercial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The chubby-faced cartoon cherubs who have
helped advertise Campbell Soup Co. for more than 80 years are
coming back _ '90s style.
   The Campbell Kids will make their reappearance next week in a
television rap jingle that promises to make a new product for
children their ``fa ... fa.... fa ... favorite one.''
   ``Rapping is mainstream today,'' Campbell spokesman Kevin Lowery
said Wednesday. ``Children love rap.''
   Created in 1904 to help sell condensed soups, the Campbell Kids
have portrayed chefs, football players, sailors and other
characters in vogue over the years. In the 1980s, they trimmed down
for a weight-conscious America.
   Next week, the cartoon characters don elastic pants, sneakers
and T-shirts and rap with an animated teddy bear on the label of
Teddy Bear Soup. Campbell began selling the product Aug. 1.
   Developed by the Backer Spielvoget Bates ad agency in New York,
the 30-second spot will air mainly during Saturday morning and late
afternoon weekday programming.
   Lowery said the kids' voices were last heard in 1958 during the
company's ``Soup This Good Just Has to Be Campbell's'' campaign. In
that commercial, the characters talked about what they wanted to be
when they grew up.
   Highly recognizable advertising figures, the characters remained
virtually unchanged through the Great Depression and two world
wars. They sometimes wore military garb during World War II or were
depicted in a soup kitchen during the Depression.
   In 1951, they donned modern fashions and endeared themselves to
a new generation in ads during the long-running ``Lassie''
television series.
   In 1983, they were slimmed down. The trimming also followed
introduction of low-calorie soups, when Campbell Soup sponsored the
U.S. National Figure Skating Team and later was the official soup
of the 1984 Winter Olympics.
   Judann Dagnoli, a reporter with Advertising Age in New York,
said Campbell joins a handful of companies using rap music in
advertising campaigns.
   In the commercial, the bear says, ``The Campbell Kids call me
Ted,'' and the dancing kids respond, ``This soup's full of bears. A
teddy bowl full of fun. Gonna make your mouth happy. Be your fa ...
fa.... fa ... favorite one.''
   Founded in Camden in 1869, Campbell sells condensed soups as
well as products under the brand names of Franco-American, V-8,
Vlasic, Pepperidge Farms, Mrs. Paul's, Prego and Godiva chocolates.

<HEAD>Prices Fall Despite Higher Oil Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade, as the market failed to
take advantage of higher oil prices.
   The market was pressured by near-perfect weather conditions in
the Midwest, which is beneficial to the corn and soybean crops.
   The National Weather Service's six- to 10-day forecast, out
Wednesday, calls for warmer and dryer than normal conditions. And
it's 30-day outlook promises more of the same.
   ``The good weather should accelerate crop maturity, and the
30-day forecast should eliminate fears of an early frost,'' said
Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   Karlin said wheat prices were pressured by a lack of export
demand. He noted there are indications members of the European
Community is heavily subsidizing wheat.
   ``The prices of (European) wheat are far below what we have,''
he said. ``The market will have to go lower to attract demand.''
   At the close, wheat was 2{ cents to 8} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $2.67 a bushel; corn was 2\
cents to 4{ cents lower with September at $2.45 a bushel; oats were
2\ cents to 3} cents lower with September at $1.01 a bushel;
soybeans were 1\ cents to 5 cents lower with September at $6.03 a

   Wall Street lost ground today after four winning
sessions as oil prices rose and pessimism about the Middle East
crisis increased.
   The Dow Jones industrial average, up 149.01 points since last
Friday, was off 18.57 to 2,613.86 at 3 p.m.
   The broader market was also lower. Losers outnumbered gainers by
a margin of about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading of New York Stock
Exchange-listed issues, with 571 up, 867 down and 506 unchanged.
   The market turned weak as the price of oil rose and interest
rates climbed in the bond market. The near-term price of light,
sweet crude was up 78 cents a barrel to $27.28 in late afternoon,
while the yield on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond climbed
to 8.97 percent.
   Analysts said traders remained reluctant to make big
commitments, out of fear of unpredictable events in the showdown in
the Persian Gulf.
   Reports that Iraq has set new conditions for allowing foreigners
to leave the country increased pessimism about the crisis.
   In addition, brokers said the market had to contend with
still-increasing worries about a possible recession.
   Surveys designed to measure confidence among consumers showed
sharp declines for August, suggesting to some that expectations of
a business slump might tend to become self-fulfilling.
   Losers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, down { at
45; General Electric, down | at 62; AT&amp;T, down | at 31~, and
General Motors, down | at 40.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
1.28 to 176.50. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 1.46 at 322.77.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 98.10 million shares with one

   Gannett Co. will consolidate its two newspaper
divisions, with Gary Watson as president of the new group,
effective Oct. 1, the company said Thursday.
   Watson, 45, a 21-year veteran at Gannett, will oversee all of
Gannett's daily papers, except USA Today. Gannett is the nation's
largest newspaper chain, with 137 daily and non-daily papers.
   Watson has been president of Gannett's 60-member community
newspaper division since December 1985. The division will be
combined with Gannett's metropolitan newspaper group, whose current
president, Brian J. Donnelly, will become executive vice president
reporting to Watson.
   The Washington Post in Thursday's editions said Watson's
promotion fueled rumors that he was being groomed to become
president and chief operating officer of the Arlington, Va.-based
media company.
   Mimi Feller, Gannett's vice president for public affairs,
confirmed the promotion and the consolidation, but denied the
speculation that Watson would become second-in-command to Gannett
Chairman-President John J. Curley.
   Feller said the company's vice chairman and chief financial
officer, Douglas H. McCorkindale, and USA Today Publisher Cathleen
P. Black would remain in those positions.
   ``There have been no changes in Cathy Black's or Doug's
positions. And there are no (additional) changes coming up in
Gary's position,'' Feller said.
   Watson's office said he was traveling and was not immediately
available for comment.
   Watson, according to the Post, told the newspaper on Wednesday
that the consolidation of the two divisions was partly in response
to the increasingly tough environment for newspaper advertising.
   Gannett's newspaper revenue fell 2 percent in the second quarter
compared with a year ago and was down 1 percent for the first six
months of this year.
   But Feller said the Post was ``off base'' when it implied that
economics was the reason for the change. She said the consolidation
and promotion of Watson ``just makes sense organizationally'' at
this time.
   She said Gannett created the two newspaper divisions in 1985
when ``we were making some larger acquisitions of papers. ... But
now we've found that it would be better to have it in one place.
You don't need to have the overlap.''
   She said the change would not mean any reductions in personnel.
   ``It's totally an administrative restructuring, not a reduction
in personnel or savings in costs,'' she said, noting that both
divisions previously had been operating under one corporate staff.
``The corporate staff stays the same. The folks running the papers
in the field stay the same.''
   Watson started with Gannett in 1969 at its Rockford (Ill.)
Register Star newspaper. He held various editing and reporting jobs
with the company, and later was named president of its Midwestern
newspaper division and president of The Cincinnati Enquirer.

<HEAD>GM, UAW Near Agreement on Workplace Safety Provision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers
union are close to agreement on a national workplace safety
contract provision, UAW and company officials say.
   Negotiators for both sides continued to work in subcommittees
Thursday, 16 days before UAW contracts with GM, Ford Motor Co. and
Chrysler Corp. expire. The agreements cover more than 450,000
active workers nationwide.
   ``We are about 99 percent there in health and safety,'' UAW Vice
President Stephen Yokich said. ``All we really have to do now is
check language.''
   GM spokesman John Maciarz on Thursday declined to be specific
when asked which or how many contract provisions may be close to
agreement.
   Workplace safety took on added significance after nine GM
workers were killed in factories this year.
   The union is focusing its bargaining efforts on GM, which
employs about 300,000 of the UAW-covered auto workers at the Big
Three. Talks at Ford and Chrysler have been put on hold pending the
outcome of negotiations between the union and GM.
   Union and Chrysler negotiators met in subcommittees Thursday. At
Ford, negotiating activity has halted.
   Yokich, who's heading the UAW team bargaining with GM, said
Wednesday that talks between the union and the company are
progressing well.
   ``We are much further ahead in GM negotiations this year than we
have been in the past,'' he said. UAW President Owen Bieber, who
Tuesday announced GM would be the union's bargaining target, will
join the GM talks Friday.
   The union plans to use an agreement ratified with GM as a
pattern for contracts with Ford and Chrysler.

<HEAD>First Boston Exec Goes It Alone In The Merger Business</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto NY300</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you look at Michael Duval's career record,
you see the signs of a team player who'd rather be his own man. So
it makes sense that this former First Boston Corp. executive would
want to set up his own mergers and acquisitions firm.
   Some of his colleagues might question the timing of his new
venture now that the '80s takeover boom has all but dried up.
   But Duval, who left First Boston as a managing director in July,
says his Duval Group will focus on a new phase in mergers and
acquisitions, where the emphasis is on strategic deals that expand
a company's business and market share here and abroad.
   The dealmaker of the '80s was often criticized for being more
interested in making a quick buck rather than improving the
long-term health of a company.
   In striking out on his own, Duval, 52, is following a path
forged two years ago by Bruce Wasserstein and Joseph Perella, heads
of First Boston's prestigious mergers department who left to open
their own mergers ``boutique.''
   And earlier this year, Eric Gleacher, head of mergers at Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co., set up his own company. Gleacher recently announced
he was forming a partnership with Morgan Grenfell PLC, the merchant
banking company owned by Deutsche Bank Group.
   Wasserstein and Perella and Gleacher have handled some big deals
since they set up shop. Wasserella, as some people call the pair,
worked on the $24.53 billion RJR Nabisco Inc. buyout and Gleacher
helped sew up ConAgra Inc.'s $1.34 billion purchase of Beatrice Co.
   Yet Duval, who doesn't exude the super-confident bravado one
expects from an investment banker, says he won't be that kind of
dealmaker.
   ``I have no illusions that I'm going to be able to put on the
scoreboard the kind of deal that Eric put on,'' he said. ``I can't
put on the kind of deals that Bruce and Joe did right out of the
block.
   ``The essence of their strength is completely different from
what I can do. Their strength is this reputation for being the
consummate deal-doers . . . I can't match that.''
   Nonetheless, Duval believes he has the ability to cut a good
deal.
   ``The real skill is in what should be sold, where is the market,
at what price should it be sold, should it be bought, does it make
sense, and then the negotiations to make the thing happen, and I
think those skills I do have,'' he said in a recent interview.
   He certainly is no stranger to the business. At First Boston, he
headed the company's real estate group and then was chosen to
handle the firm's merger with its London-based affiliate,
Financiere Credit Suisse-First Boston.
   Even at First Boston, he sought some independence. He wanted to
remain head of the real estate division, but was finally persuaded
to take on the Credit Suisse deal.
   Duval's career path has not been that of your average Wall
Street dealmaker _ there's no Harvard MBA on his resume, and he's
been in investment banking for just six years.
   After graduating from Georgetown University and getting a law
degree in 1967 from the University of California at Hastings,
Duval, whose father belonged to a San Francisco law firm, decided
to take a more individual track.
   ``I wanted to get the most opportunities, the most risks and the
most experience,'' he said.
   A friend suggested the government.
   Duval went to work in the Department of Transportation toward
the end of the Johnson administration.
   When Richard Nixon became president, he caught the eye of
then-Transportation Secretary John Volpe, and was named by Volpe to
the White House team that arranged Nixon's visit to China in 1972.
   Duval's star continued to rise during the Nixon years. While the
president was preoccupied with the Watergate scandal, Duval was
working with then-economic adviser Alan Greenspan and then-Treasury
Secretary William Simon on the 1973 energy crisis.
   After Nixon's resignation, he served as a special counsel to
Gerald Ford, then on the transition to the Carter administration.
By then Duval wanted out of Washingon.
   ``I had enough,'' he said, describing his government work as
``literally living the two-minute drill in complete and utter
crisis for six years.''
   Duval turned down the offer of a law partnership, again showing
his independent streak.
   ``I wanted to get away and go in a completely different
direction,'' he said. ``I wanted to run things and build things and
not just be in the role of an adviser.''
   So in 1977 he went to work for Mead Corp., a Dayton, Ohio,
conglomerate, and got a taste of the mergers business. In 1978,
Mead fought off an unwanted bid by Occidental Petroleum Corp.
   As Mead's chief strategic officer, Duval helped carry out a
reorganization of the company that included negotiating the sale of
about one-third of its assets _ experience that would serve him
well when he went to First Boston in 1984.
   A conversation with Duval, who is lean and tall with graying
hair, is peppered with evidence of a wry sense of humor. Ask him
where he went to school, and he responds, ``How far back do you
want to go _ the nuns?''
   And musing about the phone calls and resumes he's been getting
from people interested in working for him, Duval wondered if they
weren't really a vote of confidence in his idea.
   ``Maybe I haven't gotten this thing wrong,'' he said.
   Duval doesn't expect his company to be on line until January. He
said he expects to announce soon an affiliation with a financial
institution that will work as a partner with his firm _ a set-up
similar to Gleacher's business.
   He also is keeping his ties to the government. Duval serves on
an advisory board at the Pentagon, and was named in May to a group
that will counsel the Securities and Exchange Commission on
emerging markets in Eastern Europe.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices fell sharply on Wall Street today, ending
the stock market's four-day winning streak as oil prices rose and
pessimism deepened over economy and the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The market turned weak as crude oil futures advanced on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. The near-term price of light, sweet crude
rose 85 cents to $26.77 a barrel.
   Meanwhile, rising interest rates in the credit markets worsened
an already poor outlook for the economy. The yield on the
Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond climbed to 8.98 percent from
late Wednesday's 8.92 percent.
   Brokers said the market was contending with still-increasing
worries about a possible recession.
   Surveys designed to measure confidence among consumers showed
sharp declines for August, suggesting to some that expectations of
a business slump might tend to become self-fulfilling.
   Analysts said traders remained reluctant to make big
commitments, out of fear of unpredictable events in the showdown in
the Persian Gulf.
   Reports that Iraq has set new conditions for allowing foreigners
to leave the country increased pessimism about the crisis.
   Computer-program selling in the final half-hour of trading
steepened the market's losses.

   Assets of the nation's 520 money market mutual
funds fell $542.2 million in the latest week, the Investment
Company Institute said Thursday.
   The decline, to $407.45 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a $6.22 billion increase in the funds' assets
the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund
trade group.
   Fund assets hit an all time high of $408.0 billion in the week
ended Aug. 22 as investors put their money into safe
interest-bearing investments amid the economic uncertainty created
by the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 253 general purpose funds rose $931.9 million to $143.38
billion, assets of 105 broker-dealer funds dropped $701.6 million
to $165.37 billion, and assets of 162 institutional funds declined
$772.5 million to $98.70 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.48 percent from 7.51 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 7.50 percent from 7.52 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
45 days, unchanged from a week ago, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts fell to
6.06 percent as of Wednesday from 6.08 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged at 5.03 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.73
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 7.71 the
previous week. Yields were 7.87 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 7.86
percent; 7.94 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 7.93 percent; and
8.06 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.04 percent.

   CBS officials have discussed the possibility of
a late-night news series on the Persian Gulf crisis similar to
those that led to ABC's ``Nightline,'' the head of CBS News said
Thursday.
   ``I wouldn't rule it out,'' said Eric Ober. But for the time
being the network will only do late-night news specials and decide
on a daily basis whether to air them, said Ober, who became CBS
News president only last week.
   A late-night special aired Wednesday night included excerpts of
CBS anchorman Dan Rather's exclusive interview earlier that day of
Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein, whose Aug. 2 takeover of Kuwait
sparked the current Gulf crisis.
   Another special was set for Thursday night, Ober said, again
co-anchored by Lesley Stahl and Charles Kuralt, who did Wednesday's
program. Rather, who taped his interview with Saddam in Bagdhad,
flew Thursday to Jordan, CBS said.
   If the specials are ordered and lead to a regular series, that
would emulate the process that spawned ``Nightline'' during another
Middle East crisis 11 years ago.
   That successful, profitable show anchored by Ted Koppel,
acclaimed for his interviewing skills, began as a series of
late-night specials called ``America Held Hostage'' in 1979,
devoted to covering the crisis that began with the taking of
American hostages in Iran.
   Within a year, it became a regular weeknight program that
tackled a wide variety of subjects. On Aug. 14, Koppel became the
first U.S. network anchorman allowed into Iraq since the Persian
Gulf crisis began.
   ``I wouldn't rule it out at all,'' Ober said again in discussing
a similar series for CBS. However, ``it's premature'' to say when
and if a decision would be made.
   CBS now runs repeats of ``Wiseguy'' in its 11:30 p.m. time
period, and would have to scrap its plans to start first-run
entertainment programming in January if that time period were given
to the news division.
   ``Wiseguy'' draws lower ratings than NBC's perennial ratings
champ, ``The Tonight Show,'' or ``Nightline,'' whose A.C. Nielsen
Co. ratings have exceeded those of ``Tonight'' on some nights
during the crisis, or the syndicated ``Arsenio Hall Show.''

<HEAD>Lipstein Plans Men's Magazine Merger</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The publisher of Smart magazine said Thursday he
was near a final agreement to merge that general interest men's
publication with an unpublished men's magazine that was being
readied for launch next year.
   Publisher Owen Lipstein said he had agreed to buy the proposed
magazine called Men and would incorporate some of the ideas being
considered for Men into the 2{-year-old Smart. He declined to
disclose the price.
   In addition, Lipstein said the co-founders of Men, Publisher
Christopher Kimball and Editor Peter Kaplan, would join his New
American Magazine Co.
   He said all three of them had shaken hands on the deal, but that
legal documents would probably not be completed until the weekend.
   New American Magazine publishes Mother Earth News and Psychology
Today as well as Smart. The company has been having severe
financial problems, but got a cash infusion earlier this month when
a Japanese media company bought a 50 percent interest in the
operation.
   The proposed merger of Smart and Men comes as a number of new or
reworked magazines aimed at men are showing up on newstands.
Murdoch Magazines is launching Men's Life, Capital Cities-ABC
Inc.'s Fairchild Group has merged its fashion magazine M with
Manhattan Inc. into a new magazine called M Inc. and Conde Nast
Publications Inc. has redesigned its nightlife magazine Details.
   The deal also comes amid one of the weakest periods for magazine
advertising in years. Magazine ad pages were off 3.3 percent in the
first half of 1990 compared with a year ago, Publishers Information
Bureau reports.
   Lipstein has been looking for a new editor in chief for Smart
since Smart's founding editor, Terry McDonell, disclosed two weeks
ago he was leaving to become editor in chief at Esquire, the men's
magazine owned by Hearst Corp.
   In a telephone interview, Lipstein said Kaplan would become
editor in chief of Smart, which would retain its name and its
literary mission while incorporating some of the service-oriented
ideas Kaplan had for Men.
   Kaplan was unavailable for comment.
   Kimball said he will become publications director for New
American Magazine with responsibilities for all three of its titles.
   Mother Earth News and Smart are published every other month.
Psychology Today hasn't been published since January, but Lipstein
said it will resume publication in January 1991.
   Kimball said in a separate telephone interview that the deal
would give him and Kaplan access to much greater financial backing
for a men's magazine than they had been able to arrange for Men on
their own.
   Kimball and Kaplan had set up Norris Publishing in Fairfield,
Conn., to create Men magazine, which Kimball said would serve as a
sort of handbook for men in the 20s and 30s. Kimball declined to
disclose the sale price.
   Smart offers a bigger audience than had been envisioned for Men.
Lipstein said Smart's circulation is 250,000; Kimball had said Men
would have a circulation of 100,000.
   Lipstein said he probably could not have made the offer to buy
Men without the investment by his new Japanese partner, Japanese
Independent Communication Co. He has refused to disclose how much
the Japanese company paid for its interest in New American Magazine
but published reports have estimated it at between $8.5 million and
$18 million.

   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Aug. 20, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,306.4 billion from $3,299.9 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,091 billion from $4,085.9 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $817.6 billion from $814 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 4.4 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 was 2 percent, which is within the
Fed's target range of 1 percent to 5 percent. The Fed has not set a
target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,284.6 billion, a 1.4
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,074.4 billion, up 0.4 percent, while M1
rose 2.2 percent to an average of $810.2 billion.
   In other reports:
   _ The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $500 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$1.586 million the previous week.
   _ The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $313.8 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, up from $309.8 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Rise As Hopes for Peace Diminish</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices settled higher Thursday, propelled by
an early morning runup that focused on tensions instead of the
possibility of peace in the Middle East.
   Light sweet crude for October delivery closed up 85 cents at
$26.77 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. At one
point, crude had moved up to $27.50 as traders began doubting there
could be any immediate diplomatic resolution of the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   But a slight selloff took over later in the day, after President
Bush praised the promise of higher OPEC production and indicated no
immediate need to tap into the nation's strategic crude reserves.
   ``In the afternoon, there was a bout of profit-taking,'' said
Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc.
   A day earlier, oil dropped nearly $2 a barrel as speculators bet
on a possible peaceful solution arising from a meeting between U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz. Traders learned Thursday that the meeting had
been postponed until Friday, and focused on tensions instead of
diplomacy.
   ``Your general psychology changed,'' said Ed Kevelson, a trader
with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``Your news stories changed a bit.''
   As oil rose, the stock market fell.
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which had gained more than 149
points over the previous four sessions, lost 39.11 to close at
2,593.32.
   Other developments in the Middle East, including delays in
Iraq's promised release of hostages, helped push up the price of
oil and other energy futures. Threats of an oil workers strike in
Brazil also helped keep gasoline futures higher, Kevelson said.
   Unleaded gasoline rose 4.35 cents to 89.07 cents per gallon on
September contracts. Home heating oil for the same month was up 3.9
cents to 75.54 cents per gallon.
   Natural gas for October closed at $1.537 per 1,000 cubic feet,
up from $1.505 on Wednesday.
   Several analysts said Wednesday's sharp decline in oil prices
had been caused by some wishful thinking among traders who thought
diplomacy might solve the oil crisis that began with Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   A renewed focus on the tensions in the Gulf pushed petroleum
futures markets to a strong opening on Thursday. But tensions
became less of a focal point after Bush gave his afternoon news
conference, said one trader for Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   The rally was tempered by the President's vocal support for
increased production by OPEC members and his statement indicating
no immediate need to tap into the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve,
said the trader, who did not want his name used.
   OPEC oil ministers announced a day earlier that they would lift
temporarily the cartel's production quota of 22.5 million barrels a
day, allowing nations with plenty of oil to make up most of the
shortfall caused by the international embargo of Iraq and Kuwait.

   Wall Street's four-day reprieve from worries
about the economy and the Persian Gulf ended Thursday as stock
prices fell sharply in response to higher oil prices and rising
interest rates.
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 39.11 to 2,593.32 after
gaining 149.01 points over the previous four sessions.
   The average had been down between 20 and 25 points for much of
the day, but computer program trading in the last half-hour
steepened the market's losses. The blue chip indicator was down
nearly 54 points before regaining some ground.
   Declining issues outnumbered gainers by a margin of more than 2
to 1 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed
stocks, with 482 up, 998 down and 501 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 120.89 million
shares, down from 127.65 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 144.97 million shares.
   The rising price of oil and a surge in market interest rates
rekindled fears that the economy will slip into a recession.
   The near-term price of light, sweet crude rose 85 cents to
$26.77 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while in the
credit markets, the yield on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond
climbed to 8.98 percent by late afternoon from late Wednesday's
8.92 percent.
   The Bank of Japan's decision to raise its discount rate to 6
percent from 5.25 percent underscored some concerns about the
Federal Reserve's willingness to lower interest rates in this
country.
   There also were signs that consumers are becoming more
pessimistic about the economy. That prompted concerns in the market
that consumers might curtail their spending, making an economic
downturn self-fulfilling.
   Meanwhile, the Persian Gulf crisis weighed on the market once
again after traders saw some cause for optimism earlier this week.
   U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar arrived in Jordan
for talks with Iraq's foreign minister, but the market saw few
other hopeful signs. Reports that Iraq has set new conditions for
allowing foreigners to leave the country also increased trader
pessimism.
   The sharp decline in the Dow Jones average triggered one of the
New York Stock Exchange's ``circuit breakers'' designed to prevent
a price freefall. The mechanism bars stock sales connected to
index-futures arbitrage until the prices of the stocks involved
rise.
   Placer Dome, the most active issue on the NYSE, was unchanged at
17|.
   Among blue chip stocks, AT&amp;T was off 1 at 31{; Philip Morris
also fell 1, closing at 44{; General Electric slipped } to 61~, and
IBM tumbled 2&lsqb; to 101}.
   Auto stocks were hit hard. Ford fell 1&lsqb; to 34} and General
Motors dropped 1&rsqb; to 39\.
   Oil stocks also suffered. Atlantic Richfield dropped 2\ to 133{,
Amoco lost 1&rsqb; to 54, and Chevron slipped 1{ to 75\.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $38.433 billion, or 1.25
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
2.55 to 175.23.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 6.76 to 377.69, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index dropped 5.48 to 318.71.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slipped 3.10 to 378.68. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 322.91, off 1.32.

<HEAD>Gold Futures Gain on Middle East News</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Precious metals futures prices settled mixed Thursday in trading
on the New York's Commodity Exchange as the market continued to
react to news from the Middle East.
   In other markets, energy futures were higher; grain and soybean
futures fell; cocoa prices surged; and livestock and pork futures
were mostly lower.
   The precious metals market, as it has in recent weeks, moved in
tandem with the energy market.
   Analysts attributed an early rally to saber-rattling by the
Iraqi government, which vowed to strike Saudi Arabia and Israel if
war broke out in the Persian Gulf.
   ``The surge wore off as the day progressed, and the market
finished in retreat,'' said Craig Sloane, an analyst with Smith
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York.
   Sloane said because war has not broken out, there was little
interest in buying precious metals, a haven for investors during
periods of economic and political uncertainty.
   Silver prices languished below $5 because of the lack of trading
interest.
   Gold settled $1 to $1.20 higher with the contract for delivery
in September at $386.70 a troy ounce; silver was 1.8 cents to 1.9
cents lower with September at $4.807 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures were higher in quiet trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Analysts said the market appeared to be
drifting as it awaited the sorting out of the situation in the
Middle East.
   Helping to spur the rally of gasoline futures was news that the
Iraqi government moved a number of Japanese nationals to oil and
military installations in response to Japan's decision to help
finance multinational forces in Saudi Arabia.
   Light sweet crude was .24 cent to 85 cents higher with October
at $26.77 a barrel; heating oil was 2.48 cents to 4.09 cents higher
with September at 75.54 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 2.10
cents to 4.35 cents higher with September at 89.07 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower on the Chicago
Board of Trade, as the market failed to take advantage of higher
oil prices.
   The market was pressured by near-perfect weather conditions in
the Midwest, which is beneficial to the corn and soybean crops.
   The National Weather Service's six- to 10-day forecast, out
Wednesday, calls for warmer and dryer than normal conditions. And
it's 30-day outlook promises more of the same.
   ``The good weather should accelerate crop maturity, and the
30-day forecast should eliminate fears of an early frost,'' said
Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   Karlin said wheat prices were pressured by a lack of export
demand. He noted there are indications members of the European
Community is heavily subsidizing wheat.
   Wheat was 3 cents to 9 cents lower with September at $2.66 a
bushel; corn was 2\ cents to 4} cents lower with September at
$2.45\ a bushel; oats were 2\ cents to 3} cents lower with
September at $1.01 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cents to 5 cents lower
with September at $6.02{ a bushel.
   Cocoa prices rose sharply on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange as traders shrugged off the coming of rains in the Ivory
Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer.
   ``There is some concern about the quality of the crop in West
African cocoa areas,'' said Judith Ganes, an analyst with Merrill
Lynch, adding that there have been reports of disease.
   ``These are stories that surface periodically and normally get
traders nervous,'' she said. ``Disease is not expected to have much
of an impact on the crop.''
   Cocoa was $58 to $65 higher with September at $1,271 a ton.
   Livestock was mixed and pork futures lower in light trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .35 cent lower to .33 cent higher with October
at 76.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .38 cent
higher with August at 88.82 cents a pound; hogs were .35 cent lower
to .13 cent higher with October at 48.72 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .05 cent to .77 cent lower with February at 51.87
cents a pound.

<TEXT>
   U S West Cable Communications and United
International Holdings have committed $100 million to a joint
venture to acquire and develop overseas cable television systems,
the companies announced Thursday.
   ``Many of the communications opportunities becoming available in
Europe are extremely attractive, but we may not have been able to
pursue them all on our own,'' UIH President William Elsner said.
``Being able to combine our efforts with the resources and
expertise of U S West makes it a whole new ballgame.''
   The new venture, called United Communications International,
initially will acquire an 86 percent interest in Norkabel, the
second largest cable television operator in Norway, and a 25
percent interest in Swedish Cable &amp; Dish, the second largest
operator in Sweden, the companies said in a news release.
   U S West committed $90 million and UIH committed $10 million in
equity capital to finance the venture. Part of the money was used
to purchase interests in the Norway and Sweden systems, said Ed
Mattix, a U S west spokesman.
   Mattix said the ownership split in the joint venture will vary
depending on various factors which he did not specify.
   The UCI board will be comprised of an equal number of
representatives from U S West and UIH, with UIH acting as the
managing partner.
   U S West Cable Communications, a division of Englewood-based U S
West Inc., has international cable interests in the United Kingdom,
France and Hong Kong.
   UIH was formed in June 1989 by former officers and directors of
United Cable Television Corp., including Elsner and Gene Schneider,
UIH chairman.

   Budgets cuts could force the withdrawal of
federal inspection services at thousands of meat and poultry plants
this fall unless agreement is reached on the 1991 budget,
Agriculture Department officials said Thursday.
   Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service, said layoffs of inspection personnel
would effectively close meat and poultry plants because federal law
prohibits operations without inspection.
   The layoffs, or furloughs, would begin Oct. 1, he said. A final
determination would be made by Oct. 15 if Congress and the White
House fail to reach a budget agreement.
   Crawford said the initial furloughs would be for a maximum of 36
hours during the Oct. 1-14 period.
   The USDA agency has 7,344 employees, with about 82 percent
working in inspection services.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The United States ran up a $929.1 million
deficit in trade with China and Eastern European nations during the
first quarter of 1990 in contrast with a surplus in the same period
of 1989, the government reported Thursday.
   The deficit resulted from a drop of U.S. exports from $3.2
billion to $2.7 billion while imports grew from $2.8 billion to
$3.7 billion, the International Trade Commission said.
   A 13.4 percent decline in exports was due in large part to lower
grain shipments to the Soviet Union and China. At the same time, a
30.7 percent increase in imports came primarily from manufactured
goods from China.
   A surplus in trade with the Soviet Union declined from $1.3
billion to $932.4 million and the trade deficit with China
increased from $812.6 million to $1.9 billion, the ITC said.
   However, the U.S. deficit with other Eastern European nations
decreased from $100.9 million to only $2.8 million.

   The U.S. Department of Transportation
announced Thursday it has selected United Parcel Service Co. to
operate a new all-cargo route to Japan.
   UPS spokesman Ken Sternad said the company had not yet placed a
value on the route, but said the award was ``significant.''
   Emery Worldwide Airlines was awarded backup authority.
   UPS plans to operate six flights a week using 747 aircraft
between its Louisville hub, its Anchorage, Alaska, gateway, and
Tokyo, the DOT said.
   The new cargo route was authorized in the Nov. 6, 1989,
agreement between Japan and the United States calling for a
substantial expansion of air service between the two countries.
   UPS and Emery were the only two carriers seeking the authority
for the all-cargo route.
   In its decision, the DOT said it found that UPS' proposed 747
service would deliver more capacity and faster service to shippers.

United States by 4 percent effective Jan. 1, 1991.
   The price change will not affect prices or price changes
announced after June 1, 1990, IBM said.
   Among other items excluded from the increase are IBM's 3090
mainframe computer line; its Personal System-2 processors; the
memory for the RS-6000 workstations and 3990 models; several of its
printer models; and maintenance contracts, professional services
charges and customer education programs.

^Venezuela Orders Additional Oil on Market</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Venezuela ordered the state-owned oil
monopoly Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) to start placing extra
petroleum on the market, company president Arturo Sosa Pietri said
Thursday.
   He said PDVSA was ordered Wednesday afternoon by the government
to begin selling additional oil above the country's OPEC quota of
1.94 million barrels per day.
   At a ceremony to celebrate the oil monopoly's 15th anniversary,
he also hinted that Venezuela's oil supply should be considered as
an energy alternative to oil from the Middle East.
   ``Industrialized nations will not tolerate again a growing
dependence on Middle East oil,'' he said.
   Also Thursday, Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez called
for foreign investment in Venezuelan oil, and said he would call a
congressional session to review nationalization laws that keep oil
firmly under government control.
   ``We must think of the capacity of foreign and domestic capital
to expand these petroleum industries, especially in petrochemicals
and oil refining,'' Perez said in a speech.
   The order to sell more petroleum coincided with a decision by
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to place more oil
on the market to offset the loss caused by the embargo against oil
from Iraq and Kuwait. About 4 million barrels per day were lost
after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Sosa Pietri told The Associated Press that Brazil and Spain will
each receive 50,000 barrels per day of Venezuela's additional
crude, while India would receive 10,000 barrels per day and the
United States would receive 200,000 barrels.
   Industry analysts estimate Venezuela is now producing 100,000 to
150,000 barrels above its quota. Authorities have said the country
plans to sell up to 500,000 barrels above its quota by the end of
the year.
   In an address, he said the company plans to export nearly 2.5
million barrels per day by 1993. That would bring Venezuela oil
income to $15 billion per year, up from $11 billion estimated for
this year.
   ``The ongoing situation ... affirms Venezuela as a sure and
trustworthy oil supplier for industrial nations,'' he said in a
speech that presented Venezuela as a possible energy alternative to
Middle East oil.
   ``Our clients will prefer our crudes or our refined products
despite the fact that our oil is of a quality inferior to that of
the Middle East,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Florida's attorney general Thursday
accused Phillips Petroleum of charging independent gas distributors
more for gasoline than company-operated service stations.
   ``The evidence gathered thus far suggests that independent
jobbers and distributors could buy Phillips gas cheaper at a
company-operated service station than by buying wholesale directly
from the company,'' Attorney General Bob Butterworth said in a
statement.
   In a complaint filed in Broward County Circuit Court,
Butterworth asked for an injunction against the alleged pricing
practices. He also wants fines of $5,000 imposed against Phillips,
based in Bartlesville, Okla.
   An emergency hearing was scheduled Friday before Circuit Judge
Bob Fogan.
   Phillips spokesman George Minter said he was unaware of the
allegations and company attorneys had not seen the complaint.
   Florida's Motor Fuel Marketing Practices Act bans companies from
selling gas ``below cost,'' a somewhat arbitrary and variable
number including the wholesale price, taxes, transportation and
other items.

<HEAD>Central Bank: Brazil Will Make No Debt Payments This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brazil's central bank president said
Thursday the country would not make any payment this year on
overdue interest owed on its total foreign debt of $114 billion.
   ``The only gesture we are disposed to make is to negotiate
realistically with our creditors,'' Ibrahim Eris said in an
interview with foreign reporters.
   Brazil, which some analysts say has been in a undeclared
moratorium on debt payments for more than a year, is late on
payments of $6 billion to private banks and $2 billion to the
so-called Paris Club, composed of 10 industrialized countries with
the greatest influence in the International Monetary Fund.
   Brazil's total foreign debt is the largest in the Third World.
   Eris said the moratorium and was inherited from the outgoing
government by President Fernando Collor de Mello, who took office
March 15. Eris said Collor was making attempting to resolve
problems with lenders.
   Private creditors should not expect any payment this year
because debt renegotiations would be slow, he said. Late payments
would be incorporated into an overall setllement, Iris said.
   The government is now negotiating a letter of intentions with
the IMF, the first step in reaching an accord that would allow
Brazil to receive $1.4 billion in new money. IMF approval also is
necessary before negotiations can begin with private creditors.
   Eris said the letter had been delayed over fixing a target for
public sector deficit, ``but the basics have already been agreed
to.''
   The government wants to sign an accord with the IMF and then
negotiate with private banks and the Paris Club, he said.
   ``The banks want to shorten the process and carry out parallel
negotiations,'' he said. ``There is no deadline for signing a
letter with the fund, but in any case the government has no
intentions of delaying negotiations with the banks.''
   Brazil last week began a series of consultations with private
banks to identify possibilities for debt reduction.
   Thirty of the country's main lenders, who hold $33 billion in
loans to Brazil, were invited to attend the meetings. Ten said they
would send representatives while the others will send written
proposals.

<TEXT>
   The Federated and Allied department store
chains said Thursday they intend to negotiate more than $500
million in additional tax claims filed by the Internal Revenue
Service.
   Federated Stores Inc., the retailers' parent company, said the
claims were based on an IRS audit of the company for 1984 to 1988.
The audit was part of Federated's Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization, the company said.
   The claims involve issues that include the tax deductibility of
merger and takeover expenses related to Campeau Corp.'s
acquisitions of Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores
Corp., the company said.
   Negotiations between Federated and the IRS have begun and should
continue through the fall, Federated spokeswoman Carol Sanger said.
Federated intends to dispute the amount of the tax claim, and the
company is confident the figure will be reduced, she said.
   ``There is usually a significant reduction in the end amount
that is agreed upon, and that would be our expectation,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   A judge hearing a recording industry payola
trial suggested he may dismiss the case because the government
improperly withheld from defense attorneys prior testimony of a key
witness.
   U.S. District Judge James Ideman said it was clear to him that
prosecutors violated a rule requiring disclosure before trial of
witness statements that would tend to point toward a defendant's
innocence.
   ``Material that should have been turned over to the defense long
ago was not turned over,'' the judge said. ``I have not decided yet
what to do about this.''
   Ideman said he would announce his ruling Tuesday and asked
lawyers for further briefs on the issue of the importance of the
witness whose prior testimony was withheld.
   He asked defense lawyers to waive a possible claim of double
jeopardy in the event that he dismisses the case and his ruling is
subsequently overturned by an appeals court.
   Attorneys for principal defendant Joseph Isgro and two
co-defendants agreed to the waiver.
   The witness, former Internal Revenue Service agent Dennis Di
Ricco, was convicted of tax conspiracy and obstruction of justice
in San Francisco in 1989. The defense discovered this week that Di
Ricco had testified in his own defense, giving statements that
contradicted his testimony before a grand jury in the Isgro case.
   Di Ricco was not sent to prison because he agreed to cooperate
at Isgro's trial.
   Defense attorney Gerson Horn brought the issue of withheld
testimony to the judge's attention Wednesday.
   Prosecutors filed a brief with the judge attempting to explain
why they did not notify the defense of Di Ricco's testimony. They
said the transcript was reviewed very briefly by prosecutor William
Lynch who concluded it did not relate to Di Ricco's upcoming
testimony in the payola trial.
   ``The government may have been under a mistaken belief that the
transcript did not have to be turned over to the defense but it was
not a intentional and conscious effort to hide evidence that may be
helpful to the defense,'' the government brief said. It urged that
the trial continue and Di Ricco be allowed to testify.
   Isgro faces 57 counts of payola, racketeering and other charges.
Prosecutors say he made cash and cocaine payments to radio stations
in Texas and California in return for playing certain songs.
   Also on trial are Jeffrey Monka and former Columbia Records
executive Raymond Anderson.
   Horn, who represents Monka, said he found 74 contradictions
between Di Ricco's trial testimony in San Francisco and testimony
he gave before the grand jury in Los Angeles this year in
connection with the Isgro case.

<TEXT>
   Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. on Thursday
announced 800 temporary layoffs at tire manufacturing plants in
Tennessee and Quebec, citing sluggishness in the auto industry and
concerns about inventory.
   Goodyear said 270 workers would be laid off in Union City,
Tenn., and 530 in Valleyfield, Quebec. The layoffs will include
both white-collar and blue-collar workers.
   Goodyear in June announced 1,100 job cuts and a $35 million
charge against quarterly earnings in a restructuring of its U.S.
tire sales and support staff. Those job cuts were to be phased in
through layoffs and early retirements.
   The company said the layoffs In Unionc City and Valleyfield were
temporary and their duration would depend on ``the economy and
market demand.'' Layoff notices are to be distributed next week and
the reductions will occur over several weeks, Goodyear said.
   In addition, Goodyear said it would reduce production for one
week at its Danville, Va., medium radial truck tire plant.
   The Union City tire plant is Goodyear's second largest in the
United States with 3,100 people workers making automobile and light
truck tires.
   The Valleyfield plant is Goodyear's biggest in Canada. The
layoffs there follow recently announced plans to lay off 360
workers indefinitely by year's end because of discontinued
production of medium- and heavy-duty truck tires.
   Goodyear has built a new plant in Napanee, Ontario, that is
expected to produce 14,000 passenger tires a day at full capacity
in 1991.

   Bank of New England stock tumbled Thursday after a
congressional candidate said _ and the government later denied _
that federal regulators had recommended liquidating the struggling
bank.
   Rumors of the institution's demise have circulated on Wall
Street in recent days and gained impetus with the statement,
pushing Bank of New England's share price down 62{ cents to $1 on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   Brokers and regulators repeatedly denied the rumors that the
bank was about to be taken over, which surfaced again Wednesday.
Analysts said such rumors are not uncommon before a long weekend.
   But the rumors gained force after Ted Dimauro, a Democrat hoping
to unseat Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., issued a statement in
mid-afternoon casting doubt on the bank's future.
   ``This is a sad day for Massachusetts as the FDIC has
recommended the liquidation of Bank of New England,'' the statement
said. Dimauro accused Neal, a member of the House Banking
Committee, of ignorance in the matter.
   The Bank of New England is not regulated by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. As a federally chartered institution, its regulator
is the Comptroller of the Currency.
   Late Thursday, Dimauro apologized, saying his news release was
based on a financial wire service report and should have noted the
report concerned speculation. He said the rumors should not have
been presented as fact.
   Dimauro also said his statement was released by an aide without
his final approval. ``I apologize to the Bank of New England for
any disservice to them,'' he said.
   But hours earlier banking officials scrambled to explain
Dimauro's news release.
   ``This release has been so weird that we are saying the bank
will be open after the holiday,'' said Ellen Stockdale, a
spokeswoman for the comptroller in Washington. ``It will still be
the Bank of New England on Tuesday. The press release is not true.''
   ``The problem is that irresponsiblity like this press release
can kill a bank,'' she said.
   Stockdale said the bank is solvent. She said the Office of the
Comptroller decides when a bank isn't solvent and the FDIC would
then be responsible for liquidation.
   The bank also denied any takeover by regulators. ``We're open
for business today and come next Tuesday we'll still be open,''
spokesman Thomas Lavelle said.
   The bank's chairman and chief executive, Lawrence K. Fish, later
issued a statement saying the ``surprising and harmful rumors that
have been circulating about Bank of New England during the last
several days are completely untrue.''
   ``The facts are that we . . . have been fully liquid since
mid-June, operating expenses have been sharply reduced and our
plans for a recapitalization are well advanced,'' the statement
said. ``Our recovery program is on track.''
   Bank of New England has been operating under federal orders
since early this year. The bank came under heightened government
scrutiny when a downturn in the economy and the real estate market
exposed mountains of bad loans.
   The bank Aug. 3 announced it had lost more than $30 million in
the second quarter of 1990, following a $46.6 million first-quarter
loss after a decline that began late last year. The company lost
more than $1 billion in 1989.
   Under an operating plan in conjunction with federal regulators,
the bank plans to sell off assets and slash its work force to
reduce costs and raise money.
   The bank did not comment specifically on Dimauro's news release
and Lavelle said it never comments on the activity of its stock.
   The rumors about Bank of New England's future began before the
Dimauro statement and the stock already was falling earlier in the
day.
   ``It's been a distressed bank for some time and the continued
deterioration in economic fundamentals in New England made their
recovery that much more difficult,'' said Don Kauth, a bank analyst
at First Albany Corp. in New York.
   Kauth said rumors have surrounded the bank recently about a
federal takeover, which some analysts believe is inevitable.
   ``The stock's been under a lot of heavy selling pressure because
of the rumors,'' said Gerard Cassidy, a bank analyst with Tucker,
Anthony Inc. in Portland, Maine.
   ``If it turned out to be true, it would be fairly significant,''
he said. ``It would show that for the bank and New England as a
whole, their problems have not disappeared. It would be similar to
the situation with Texas banks.''

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has fined two box companies
a total of $550,000 for their role in a bid-rigging and
price-fixing scheme in six Midwestern states.
   U.S. District Judge Nicholas Walinski on Wednesday fined General
Box Co. of Meridian, Miss., $500,000 for violating the Sherman
Antitrust Act. Wisconsin Box Co. of Wausau, Wisc., was fined
$50,000 for violating the same law.
   Both companies, which were indicted in March 1988, pleaded no
contest in January and were found guilty. Each company could have
been fined a maximum $1 million.
   The fines ended a six-year federal effort to investigate
allegations of bid rigging and other illegal practices in the
wirebound box industry.
   A special federal grand jury was convened in Toledo in 1984 to
investigate allegations that some wirebound box makers engaged in a
nationwide conspiracy to divide up markets and fix prices.
   About a dozen companies were targets of the grand jury's
four-year investigation, but General Box and Wisconsin Box were the
only two indicted.
   The indictment charged that from as early as 1960 through March
1984, the defendants engaged in a conspiracy to allocate customers
for wirebound boxes in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Wisconsin
and Minnesota, restraining interstate trade and commerce.
   The indictment also charged that the companies conspired to
submit collusive non-competitive and rigged bids or quotations.
   Most of the acts listed in the indictment occurred long before
March 1983 and thus could not be brought to trial under a five-year
federal statute of limitations, prosecutors said.
   After the company was found guilty, Wisconsin Box attorneys said
it has lost money for years and shouldn't be penalized. They also
noted the company's cooperation in the case.
   General Box attorneys said that company also was having severe
financial problems. The company was based in Toledo before its
offices were moved to Mississippi in 1985. It was sold two years
later to a group of local investors.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court ruled Thursday that
Trans World Airlines can prohibit broker sales and other transfers
of ``frequent flyer'' discount coupons.
   But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals at least temporarily
set back TWA attempt to enforce the ban through an injunction and
damages lawsuit against a company that buys unused coupons and
sells them at cut rates.
   The 3-0 ruling reversed decisions by a federal judge in Los
Angeles that said the company, American Coupon Exchange, had
violated TWA's economic rights and was forbidden to trade in TWA
coupons.
   The court said TWA had not presented conclusive evidence that it
had been harmed by the broker's practices, and would have to go to
trial on that issue.
   American Coupon Exchange, based in Newport Beach, since 1983 has
bought airline customers' extra coupons that entitle them to free
trips after traveling a certain number of miles. The coupons are
resold at 30 percent to 70 percent below full fare.
   Some airlines do not restrict transfers of the coupons, but TWA,
in rules filed with the federal government, prohibited its
customers in 1983 from letting anyone else use their coupons, under
penalty of disqualification from the program.
   The airline allowed transfers to relatives and legal dependents
in 1986 and sued American Coupon Exchange in 1987. U.S. District
Judge Alicemarie Stotler ruled in TWA's favor.
   The judge declared its restrictions legal, prohibited American
Coupon Exchange from dealing in TWA coupons and found that the
broker had interfered with the airline's business relations. The
prohibition has been suspended during the appeal.
   In an opinion by Judge Stephen Reinhardt, the appeals court
agreed that TWA's restrictions were legal but reversed the other
rulings, saying they depended on disputed facts to be established
at a trial.
   In challenging TWA's policy, American Coupon Exchange cited a
longstanding legal rule that property may be freely transferred.
But the appeals court said the same rule does not apply to contract
rights, whose transfer can be restricted.
   A plane ticket or a coupon entitling a customer to a ticket is a
contract rather than property, the court said.
   Reinhardt said the flaw in Stotler's other orders was that no
evidence had yet been presented that the coupon-selling program had
harmed TWA.
   He rejected Stotler's grounds for finding harm: that the holder
of a ticket from a coupon broker held a seat that otherwise would
have been occupied by a legitimate ``frequent flyer'' or a
full-fare passenger.
   Reinhardt it was hard to see how TWA loses revenue when a
frequent flyer decides to sell a coupon rather than using it. He
also said no evidence had been offered that coupon-holders on TWA
were displacing full-fare flyers.
   A TWA executive testified that the airline has confiscated more
than 400 discount tickets that violated its restrictions in the
last two years, and that virtually all of those passengers had then
bought full-fare tickets.
   But Reinhardt said those decisions were made at the last minute,
when it may have been too late to change travel plans, and might
have been different had travelers known of the restrictions earlier.
   A lawyer for the coupon broker declined comment. TWA's lawyer
could not be reached.

<TEXT>
   The Walt Disney Co. sued a former top movie
executive Thursday for allegedly trying to lure other Disney
employees and projects after the company released him from a
contract.
   The lawsuit says Disney allowed David Kirkpatrick out of his
five-year contract as a ``gesture of goodwill.'' In return, he
agreed not to offer jobs to Disney employees for two years and not
to exploit Disney trade secrets, it says. Kirkpatrick moved to
Paramount Pictures Corp.
   But the lawsuit maintains Kirkpatrick tried to hire away Donald
Granger, creative director of Disney's Touchstone Pictures. It also
says he used inside information to try to bring the project ``The
Dead Letter Department'' to Paramount. Disney had been negotiating
for the project.
   Kirkpatrick, former production president of Walt Disney Pictures
and Touchstone, maintains he broke no agreements after leaving
Disney last July for Paramount, where he had worked previously.
   ``David vehemently denies these allegations and Paramount is 100
percent behind him,'' his lawyer, Howard Weitzman, said.
   Fitzpatrick's flight to Paramount reversed a well-established
trend. The numbers of Disney top brass who formerly worked at
Paramount are unusually large, even for Hollywood where executives
and projects move between studios.
   When Jeffrey Katzenberg left Paramount in 1985 to become
Disney's overall studio chieftain, he tried to take Kirkpatrick
with him. Paramount reportedly threatened to sue.
   Disney's lawsuit, filed in state court in Los Angeles, asks the
court to stop Kirkpatrick from luring away talent and projects and
using Disney inside information.
   It seeks unspecified damages, accusing Kirkpatrick of breaking
an agreement, fraud, unfair competition, misappropriating trade
secrets, interfering with a contract and other wrongs.
   The lawsuit says Kirkpatrick told Disney he wanted out in July,
but didn't say he was going to Paramount.
   Kirkpatrick contended he should be allowed to take Granger with
him because Granger's contract with Disney had run out, the lawsuit
says. It contends that's not the case under the release agreement.
   In talking with Katzenberg and Touchstone Pictures President
David Hoberman, Kirkpatrick continued to maintain there were
loopholes allowing Granger to depart, the lawsuit says.
   Kirkpatrick has been production president for just 15 months. He
was said to have been granted an early release due to a clash in
management style.
   Kirkpatrick had been a production executive with Paramount for
more than eight years and most recently was executive vice
president of production until 1987.
   He is now executive vice president of Paramount's Motion Picture
Group. Trade newspaper reports indicated he was hired to curb
production costs, improve in-house movie development and strengthen
the management team.
   Disney's lawsuit notes that Paramount sued Kirkpatrick for
breach of contract when he left the studio in 1987 to head up
production for the now-moribund Weintraub Entertainment Group.
Weintraub also employed Granger.
   The lawsuit was settled out of court with Kirkpatrick and
Weintraub having to pay about $500,000, the trade newspaper Daily
Variety said.
   Kirkpatrick joined Disney after leaving Weintraub, reuniting him
with Disney Chairman Michael Eisner and Katzenberg, with whom he
worked at Paramount. He joined Paramount's story department in 1978.

   Share prices in Tokyo erased early losses and rose
moderately by the end morning trading Friday, while the U.S. dollar
was higher against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar was changing hands at 144.25 yen in late morning. It
opened at 144.45 yen, up 0.35 yen from Thursday's 144.10-yen close,
and ranged between 144.13 yen and 144.55 yen during morning trading.
   Erasing early losses, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained
244.49 points, or 0.95 percent, ending the morning session at
25,914.45. The index rose 775.17 points on Thursday on the Bank of
Japan's announcement it was raising the discount rate.
   Japan's central bank raised the key interest rate to commercial
banks to 6 percent from 5.25 percent, effective immediately.
   Securities dealers said share prices started lower Friday with
many investors discouraged by a decline Thursday on Wall Street and
the depressed value of the yen against the dollar.
   But the index started recovering as institutional investors
activated program trades to take profits from the price gap between
stock and stock-index futures markets, said Satoru Nagayoshi, a
trader with New Japan Securities Co.
   Other traders said bargain hunting by individual investors also
helped push up share prices.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar was stronger because of
demand for the dollar from trading companies at the end of month.
But the currency rate was moving narrowly because investors were
reluctant to make major moves ahead of a three-day weekend in New
York.
   U.S. financial markets will be closed Monday for Labor Day.
   In bond dealings, the yield of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds inched up to 8.140 percent from
Thursday's close at 8.120 percent. Their price was lower at 82.92
points from 83.00.
