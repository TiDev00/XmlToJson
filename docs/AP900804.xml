   The House passed landmark civil rights
legislation despite President Bush's veto threat Friday as Congress
juggled a host of bills in the race toward summer recess.
   Attempting to meet a self-imposed deadline of finishing business
by week's end, the House pushed the Civil Rights Act of 1990 closer
to final passage, approving the measure by a 272-154 vote.
   ``Stand up for what you know is right, stand up for America's
values,'' House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., told his
colleagues shortly before the vote. The bill now goes to a
House-Senate conference committee where prospects for compromise
seemed bright. The Senate approved its own version two weeks ago.
   The bill would overturn the effects of five Supreme Court
decisions in recent years, which reined in affirmative action
programs.
   Bush argued that the measure would go too far and would led to
hiring quotas. But he also promised to sign what he called ``a
sound, practical compromise.''
   Across the Capitol, the Senate labored over a $289 billion
defense authorization bill. The debate was laced with repeated
references to Iraq's occupation of Kuwait as staunchly pro-defense
senators argued against steep Pentagon cuts.
   Senators agreed to vote Saturday on five amendments dealing with
Star Wars.
   Late Friday, the House passed a highly contentious bill
overhauling the campaign finance laws, but only after Democratic
leaders eased spending limits in the bill under pressure from
members concerned about their chances for re-election.
   The partisan 255-155 vote came after the spending ceiling in the
bill was raised from $550,000 to $715,000 and members rejected a
Republican alternative that would have banned ``Leadership PACs,''
political action committees run by powerful congressional figures
to give funds to other members.
   The Senate, by a largely party-line, 59-40 vote Wednesday night,
approved a Democratic bill that would limit Senate candidates'
campaign spending at $2 million to $10 million, depending on their
states' population.
   Work on those and other bills has kept the both chambers in
marathon sessions deep into the summer nights.
   Bush argued in a letter to House Republican Leader Bob Michel of
Illinois that the civil rights bill fashioned by the House and
Senate would ``have the effect of forcing businesses to adopt
quotas in hiring and promotion.''
   ``It will also foster divisiveness and litigation rather than
conciliation and do more to promote legal fees than civil rights,''
Bush said.
   Nevertheless, Democrats voted 240-12 for the bill. Thirty-two
Republicans joined the Democratic majority Bush while 142 supported
Bush's position. On the roll call for passage, the bill fell 12
votes short of what would be needed to override a presidential veto.
   Major provisions range from a ban on racial harassment in the
workplace to barriers against reopening court-approved fair-hiring
agreements.
   The major clashes, however, came over provisions making it
easier to use statistics to win discrimination suits against
employers and for punitive damages for women and other
discrimination victims.
   The Democratic-controlled House rejected 238-188 the Bush-backed
alternative. Civil rights forces said that version would dilute
protections against discrimination.
   ``It would rip the heart out of it,'' said Rep. Jack Brooks,
D-Texas.
   Lawmakers said there was fierce, last-minute lobbying on the
alternative, championed by Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y. ``The
pressures have been enormous, the intimidation has belied the
vision and hope of civil rights, but in the end it is my face in
that mirror,'' said Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn.
   The LaFalce alternative would have tempered language designed to
make it easier to win job bias suits against employers based on
statistics.
   It also would have capped at $100,000 punitive damages for
intentional discrimination that courts could award to women,
religious minorities and the disabled. The bill limits those
damages to $150,000 or the amount of compensatory damages,
whichever is higher.
   In its deliberations on the defense authorization bill for the
new fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, the Senate turned back an attempt
to cut nearly four times as many U.S. troops in Europe as Bush had
proposed.
   Despite the argument that the Cold War has ended and the United
States faces severe fiscal problems, the Senate rejected an
amendment to cut 130,000 troops, including 80,000 in Europe. The
vote was 59-40.
   In proposing a $307 billion defense bill for the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1, Bush called for a troop reduction of about
40,000. The Senate Armed Services Committee adopted a $289 billion
military budget last month that would cut overall troop strength by
100,000.

   The nation's unemployment rate shot up to 5.5
percent last month, its highest level in two years, the government
said Friday in a report that renewed fears that the economy may be
toppling into a recession.
   ``The economy appears to be caving in to a full-fledged
recession. The jump in the unemployment rate is the telling sign,''
said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Co.
   On Wall Street, the stock market sold off sharply amid the new
recession fears and Middle East oil concerns. The Dow Jones average
of 30 industrials, down more than 120 points at its midsession low,
closed with a 54.95-point loss at 2,809.65.
   The Labor Department's unemployment report showed widespread
weakness in the job market as payrolls fell by 219,000 jobs.
   That number was bloated by the 160,000 temporary census workers
the government laid off, but other sectors of the economy posted
job losses, too. Construction and manufacturing continued their
slide and even the nation's service sector, which had been carrying
the economy, suffered in July.
   ``It's one more nail in the coffin of the economic boom. When
you have 219,000 people out there without jobs, even if many of
them were census workers, you've got a lot of people without buying
power. It's pretty clear evidence the economy is in big trouble,''
said Irwin Kellner, chief economist of Manufacturers Hanover Trust.
   The Bush administration interpreted the numbers differently.
Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the report ``does reinforce our
concern for getting the deficit under control'' but said the
economy is still growing. ``We don't see a recession,'' he said.
   But Richard Rahn, chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, said the U.S. economy ``is not going to hang on much
longer. It is headed directly into a recession.''
   Analysts were also alarmed about how America's already
struggling economy might react to oil price shock from Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
   ``We're close to the edge. It wouldn't take much of a breeze to
push us over ... What's going on in the Middle East may be the
breeze to do it,'' said Robert Dederick, chief economist at the
Northern Trust Co. of Chicago.
   Friday's statistics were the latest in a string of lackluster
government reports on economic activity that showed:
   _The U.S. economy grew by just 1.2 percent in the second quarter
of 1990, a rate far below the pace analysts believe is needed to
generate new jobs.
   _Orders to factories for manufactured goods fell in June for the
third time this year, a 1.5 percent decline which was likely to
trigger further production cutbacks and layoffs in U.S. industry.
   _Construction spending was unchanged in June after falling for
two consecutive months.
   _The government's Index of Leading Economic Indicators, which
has been flashing weak signals for most of the year, showed no
strength at all in June. The index is designed to forecast economic
activity six to nine months in advance.
   Last month's 0.3 percentage point rise in the civilian jobless
rate, which was up from the June rate of 5.2 percent, put the
American unemployment rate at its highest level since it hit 5.6
percent in August 1988, the Labor Department said.
   Analysts had been expecting the jobless rate to jump eventually
to reflect the nation's slow economic growth. So far this year,
America's private industries have been producing an average of just
96,000 new jobs a month, far below the 177,000 generated monthly in
1989, the Labor Department said.
   Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
blamed July's weak jobs report on the deterioration of the service
sector that had been ``the major engine of job growth during the
current economic expansion. But that engine seems to have sputtered
in July.''
   The service sector suffered a 160,000-jobs decline last month.
That number included temporary census workers as well as jobs in
wholesale trade and business services. Retail trade added 20,000
jobs. the government said.
   Construction payrolls fell by 50,000 jobs, after seasonal
adjustment, the fifth consecutive decline and a reflection of
continued weakness in the housing market. Construction jobs are
more than 100,000 below the level of last fall, the government said.
   The nation's manufacturing slump also continued in July, as
factory payrolls fell by 7,000 jobs. It was the 15th time in 16
months that manufacturing jobs declined. Since reaching a
post-recession peak in March 1989, nearly 350,000 factory jobs have
been lost.
   Health services, which had added an average of 50,000 jobs each
month in the first half of this year, expanded by only half that
amount in July, adding 25,000 new jobs.
   Labor costs continued to increase. Average hourly earnings
posted a 0.6 percent rise in July to $10.09, up from the $10.03 the
average worker earned per hour in June.
   Overall, total civilian employment was about 118 million in
July, down from the 118.4 million employed in June. The jobless
numbered 6.8 million, up from 6.4 million unemployed in June.
   Last month's big jump in unemployment was a major departure from
the steady nature of the jobless rate over the past two years.
Before July, the jobless rate had fluctuated within a tenth of a
percentage point of 5.3 percent since September 1988. The only
exception was March of last year, when it hit a 15-year low of 5
percent.

   The Internal Revenue Service will go to
almost any lengths to retrieve back taxes. In a case against an
Iranian immigrant, federal officials are considering following the
man into the grave.
   The U.S. attorney's office says it might ask to exhume the body
of Ehsanolla Motaghed just to make sure he's dead. Motaghed
apparently died June 9 without paying $156,000 in back taxes.
   ``They're just mad because he had the audacity to die without
settling his account,'' said James Martin Davis, the attorney for
Motaghed's estate.
   Motaghed, 66, who ran an optical lens importing business, was
indicted April 25 for allegedly offering a $4,000 cash bribe to an
IRS agent. He pleaded innocent and was free on bail.
   According to both Davis and local death records, Motaghed died
June 9 in his Omaha apartment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or
Lou Gehrig's disease. He was buried June 12.
   The U.S. attorney's office has said it is considering seeking a
Douglas County Court order to have the body exhumed. Assistant U.S.
Attorney Bob Kokrda has refused to say why officials suspect
Motaghed isn't dead.
   ``This is about as grotesque a thing as I've ever dealt with,''
said Davis, who has asked the court to dismiss the charges.
   ``It's an identification problem,'' Kokrda said in an interview
Tuesday. ``It was four days after he was put in the ground that we
read in the paper that he died. We're just trying to satisfy
ourselves'' that the man died.
   Kokrda said his office hasn't decided whether to ask for
exhumation. ``If we can do it (make an identification) any other
way, we will,'' he said.
   The IRS on Monday filed liens against Motaghed's estate,
claiming he owes $156,000 in back taxes. The filing was the result
of a review of Motaghed's 1985 through 1987 tax returns, said Omaha
IRS spokesman Ed Daemon.
   Motaghed's daughter, Afsaneh McGahey of San Diego, said she was
questioned two weeks ago by IRS officials about her father's death.
   ``I was horrified,'' said Mrs. McGahey, who is a lawyer. ``I
don't know why they are doing this.''
   Mrs. McGahey said she's satisfied the man in the grave at
Omaha's Evergreen Memorial Park Cemetery is her father.
   The death certificate on file with the county identifies the
body as that of Motaghed, said Douglas County Attorney Ron
Staskiewicz. The certificate lists amyotrophic lateral sclerosis as
the cause of death.
   Motaghed came to the United States 12 years ago after being
expelled from Iran by the government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   The indictment alleged that during a tax investigation, Motaghed
offered a bribe to an IRS agent.
   ``He was told he owed the IRS money, and the agent said he had
to pay, and so he gave the agent $4,000,'' Davis said.
   The Inspection-Internal Security Division, which investigates
alleged bribery of IRS agents, doesn't buy that version.
   ``Do you think the U.S. attorney's office would take the case if
it was like that?'' said Marti Hosimer, a spokeswoman in the
division's Chicago office.
   When Motaghed was arraigned, Kokrda said his assets were between
$750,000 and $1 million. Davis said Motaghed invested his money in
U.S. Treasury bills and lived off the income. Davis said it would
have been difficult to hide that money from the IRS.
   Motaghed posted his $110,000 bail in Treasury bills.
   Davis said Nebraska law stipulates that the only legal reason
for exhuming a body is for dissection to determine a cause of death.
   ``They would have to dig him up for the purpose of dissection,''
Davis said. ``I've heard the IRS does that to people while they're
still alive, but not when they're dead.''

   After years of collecting the remnants of
Yiddish literature, which was virtually wiped out by the Holocaust,
Aaron Lansky is taking the culture back to its roots.
   Lansky, founder of the National Yiddish Book Center, recently
returned from a mission of remembrance: taking Yiddish books to
Jews in the Baltic republics of the Soviet Union.
   ``These are Jews that have been cut off from their own past,''
Lansky said Friday. ``Unless they can connect now, I think they'll
simply lose it.''
   Lansky and his associates packed up 6,000 volumes in a rented
van and drove for 12 days through the Baltic states, handing out
copies of a written tradition that has nearly vanished in two
generations.
   He recalled in particular a trip to a town in Lithuania that had
been predominantly Jewish before World War II.
   ``There was just no trace of Jewish life at all,'' Lansky said.
``Had we been in that town 49 years before, most of the people on
the street would have been speaking Yiddish to us. Here was a town
that was virtually unchanged, yet the Jews had vanished.''
   Lansky, 35, began ``rescuing'' Yiddish 10 years ago, when he
founded the National Yiddish Book Center in western Massachusetts,
running newspaper ads for unwanted Yiddish books languishing in
attics and cellars. At that time, it was estimated that 75,000
books existed written in the language that had been spoken by
Eastern European Jews for hundreds of years.
   Instead, about a million books have poured into the non-profit
center, the largest repository of Yiddish works in the nation,
which now has a staff of about two dozen and runs such educational
programs as the Yiddish Library Development Program.
   Lansky got the idea to take books into the Soviet Union after
receiving letters from Jews in the Baltic states who had heard of
the center and hoped that the new openness would mean Yiddish could
be resuscitated.
   The books were sent to Finland and then to Estonia, where a
non-Jewish group, the Estonia Cultural Foundation, had agreed to
accept them. Lansky, an associate and a photographer flew to
Stockholm, rented a van and then drove to Estonia.
   ``We were there exactly 50 years to the day of the Soviet
occupation of the Baltic states, so it was an historic time,''
Lansky said.
   Many of the books in the van were reprints of works that had
been originally published in the Baltic states during the 100 or so
years that Yiddish literature flourished, starting about 1870.
   Lansky said although many of the Jews he spoke to hope to leave
the Soviet Union now that immigration has relaxed somewhat, they
still want to keep in touch with their old traditions.
   ``Their grandparents were Yiddish-speaking Jews. They're not
Russians, they're not Latvians, it says right in the passport that
they're a Jew ... but they haven't the slightest idea what that
means,'' he said.

   Snapping turtles are feeding off ducks
at a town pond, but duck lovers are getting even by feasting on the
turtles.
   The strong-jawed turtles in Douglas Pond have been latching onto
ducks by the feet, dragging them under water and eating them, said
Crowley Fralick, who works at a nearby sporting goods store in
Bluefield.
   ``It is their way of survival. I understand that,'' Fralick said
Friday.
   ``Still, it got to be a little much during the spring when the
young ducklings started disappearing,'' he said. ``The little ones
are easy for the turtles to catch.''
   Fralick and his co-workers have responded by trapping the
turtles in the one-acre pond and turning them into soup. In three
years, they've caught and eaten 72 snappers.
   ``Last year was the first time I tried one. It was pretty good.
Really, it was delicious,'' Fralick said.

   President Saddam Hussein, to his own
apparent pleasure, is known throughout Iraq and the Arab world by
his first name, which means ``one who confronts.''
   With his latest exploit, facing worldwide condemnation and
sanctions after invading Kuwait and ousting its royal family, he
seems to be living up to his name.
   Even little children in Iraq know their leader by his first
name. Schoolgirls sing a little jingle: ``Saddam, Saddam, we will
give our blood for you.''
   Headlines in Iraqi and other Arab papers use Saddam to refer to
the Iraqi leader. Stories might say President Saddam Hussein.
   But though Hussein was the first name of his father, who died
before Saddam was born, he is never referred to in the press as
President Hussein. He is called Saddam.
   Saddam was born in the close-knit town of Takrit north of
Baghdad and like many other residents, bore the surname Al-Takriti.
Later he abolished regional surnames.
   A wide interpretation of the law was that Saddam wanted to
obscure the number of members of his inner circle who were
relatives from Takrit.

<HEAD>President-Elect Gaviria Is Small Man With Tough Ideas</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Saturday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN GUTKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The next president of Colombia is a
soft-spoken economist who was catapulted to his nation's highest
office less through charisma than by violent events.
   Cesar Gaviria of the Liberal Party _ the former campaign manager
for a candidate who was killed by drug traffickers _ will become
Colombia's next leader on Tuesday.
   He is a small man with a thin voice and a childlike face. But as
a congressman and Cabinet minister, he gained a reputation for
being a tough negotiator and political manipulator.
   ``He's a 21st-century type, smart, practical and pragmatic,''
said Jorge Orlando Melo, director of Bogota's Institute of
Political Studies.
   One year ago, Gaviria was campaign manager for Sen. Luis Carlos
Galan, an anti-drug crusader who was slain at a rally by drug
traffickers.
   Galan's death signified the start of a bloody war against drug
lords. It also marked the political rise of Gaviria, who vowed to
carry on Galan's crusade against drug criminals who were
endangering Colombian democracy.
   ``In many ways, Colombians were voting for a dead man when they
chose Gaviria,'' said political scientist Camilo Castellanos.
   Colombians, devastated by a seemingly endless nightmare of
bombings and murders, now look to Gaviria to defend their country's
dignity.
   He takes office at a time when drug lords have declared a
cease-fire, several leftist guerrilla groups are talking peace with
the government and political leaders have agreed to call a national
assembly to reform Colombia's 104-year-old constitution.
   But the atmosphere of hope is muted by the continued violence.
   Assassinations of political leaders, judges and policemen
continue. Guerrillas still fight the army in the countryside.
   Earlier this week, police said they thwarted a plan by
terrorists to disrupt next week's inaugural ceremonies. Security
forces found three Uzi machine guns that they said were to be used
to carry out terrorist attacks during the inauguration.
   Officials say tough security measures will protect the five
heads of state and 81 foreign delegations visiting Colombia for the
inauguration.
   But recent terrorist attacks underscore the fact that no one is
truly safe in Colombia as long as so many violent elements run free.
   Gaviria has promised to continue the tough stance against drug
traffickers taken by the current administration of President
Virgilio Barco.
   Observers say that one of Barco's greatest achievements as
president was getting the world to admit that the drug war was not
just Colombia's problem.
   ``During Barco's tenure, Colombia went from being the criminal
to the victim in the world's eyes,'' Melo said.
   But if Barco's biggest feat was getting the world to admit the
problem, Gaviria's biggest challenge is getting it to act.
   Critics charge that Barco's diplomatic successes were not
supported by enough foreign aid to help Colombia fight the drug war.
   Last year, the United States sent $65 million in logistical aid,
such as helicopters and bulletproof vests.
   However, the economic assistance Colombia had hoped for, such as
preferential treatment for its exports, never materialized.
   ``Compared to Barco, Gaviria is going to insist much more on the
economic part, getting commercial aid, international credits,
etc.,'' Melo said.
   Some observers say Gaviria represents a new breed of Colombian
political leaders who shun the closed, old-boy network of the past.
He has promised to open up the political system to
under-represented groups.
   But not everyone agrees Gaviria represents a change.
   ``In order for anyone to get to where Gaviria is, you'd have to
play by the rules, and those rules aren't available to everyone,''
human rights activist Clara Lopez said in an interview.

   Here is the text of the joint U.S.-Soviet
statement on the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, as read by Secretary of
State James A. Baker III at a new conference in Moscow.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union and the United States, as members of the U.N.
Security Council, consider it important that the council promptly
and decisively condemned the brutal and illegal invasion of Kuwait
by Iraqi military forces.
   The United States and the Soviet Union believe that now it is
essential that the council resolution be fully and immediately
implemented. By its action, Iraq has shown its contempt for the
most fundamental principles for the United Nations charter and
international law.
   In response to this blatant transgression of the basic norms of
civilized conduct, the United States and the Soviet Union have each
taken a number of actions, including the Soviet suspension of arms
deliveries and the American freezing of assets.
   The Soviet Union and the United States reiterate our call for
unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. The sovereignty,
national independence, legitimate authorities and territorial
integrity of the state of Kuwait must be completely restored and
safeguarded.
   The United States and the Soviet Union believe the international
community must not only condemn this action, but also take
practical steps in response to it.
   We take the unusual step of jointly calling upon the rest of the
international community to join with us in an international cutoff
of all arms supplies to Iraq. The Soviet Union and the United
States call on regional organizations, especially the League of
Arab States, all Arab governments, as well as the non-aligned
movement and the Islamic Conference, to take all possible steps to
ensure that the United Nations Security Council resolution is
carried out.
   Governments that engage in blatent aggression must know that the
international community cannot, and will not, acquiesce in, nor
facilitate aggression.

   U.S. Air Force jets have screamed low over Western
canyonlands for years, practicing bombing runs for a potential war
against the Soviet Union in the volatile Middle East.
   Now the Persian Gulf is aflame with gunfire _ but the
superpowers are on the same side, trying to halt the violence from
Day One.
   Friday's historic joint statement condemning Iraq, made in
Moscow by U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, is the first time the
superpowers coordinated specific sanctions to stop a war.
   They condemned the ``brutal and illegal invasion of Kuwait by
Iraqi military forces'' and agreed to seek a worldwide cutoff of
arms shipments to the aggressor. They asked the entire
international community to join in taking all possible steps to
restore Kuwait's independence.
   ``These steps that we have outlined are a lot more than simply
rhetoric. These are specific and concrete actions,'' Baker told a
news conference.
   The Soviet Union, Iraq's largest weapons supplier, had already
announced it was suspending arms shipments because of the invasion.
The United States, which sells no military equipment to Iraq, froze
Iraq's bank accounts and banned imports of its oil.
   The superpowers have cooperated in the past in the United
Nations on such fruitless endeavors as seeking peace for Lebanon,
but Friday's action is the first time they have tried to strangle a
war by cutting off the aggressor's resources.
   It was a stark example of the radical change in Soviet foreign
policy over five years of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's rule. He has been
saying for years that conflicts must be decided peacefully. But the
arms embargo backed words with action, at the cost of angering a
long-time ally.
   Friday's meeting also brought dramatic evidence that the Cold
War is truly over. This time, there is no fear that someone else's
temper would turn an icy superpower confrontation into a
conflagration that could destroy the Earth.
   Iraqi soldiers overran Kuwait and on Friday gathered on the
border with Saudi Arabia in spite of a clear warning that the
United States may enter the war if Saudi Arabia is attacked.
   For years the United States feared that a threat to Saudi Arabia
would lead directly to a war between the superpowers. But
Shevardnadze made it clear the Soviet Union has no intention of
sending its own troops to the Persian Gulf.
   ``There are no such plans,'' he said.
   Shevardnadze also said he still believes Iraq ``will have the
political wisdom'' to end its occupation of Kuwait.
   He said, one day after the Soviet Union cut off arms to Iraq,
that Baghdad had assured Soviet diplomats its troops would begin
withdrawing soon.
   Shevardnadze also warned of ``very, very severe consequences''
if any of the thousands of Soviet citizens in Kuwait and Iraq are
hurt.
   Shortly after Shevardnadze's announcement, Baghdad Radio said
Iraqi troops would begin leaving Sunday, because the provisional
government set up during the invasion could stand on its own.
Western diplomats called the new Kuwaiti government a puppet regime
under the control of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
   Shevardnadze admitted that when he and Baker _ meeting in
Irkutsk on Wednesday _ first discussed the Iraqi troops massing on
the Kuwaiti border, ``I did not expect the Iraqis would resort to
such an overt invasion, an undistinguished aggression against a
defenseless, peace-loving country, which did not and does not
threaten anyone.''
   Shevardnadze said that if Iraq does not withdraw, the
superpowers would continue to work together to that end and the
Soviet Union would consider further steps of its own beyond the
arms embargo.
   President Bush said the United States might blockade Iraq's
oil-shipping routes.
   Richard Grimmett of the U.S. Congressional Research Service said
a worldwide arms cutoff would have no immediate effect on Iraq
because it has imported $43 billion worth of weapons in the past
eight years.
   But if the Soviets, the French, the Germans and the British all
refused to sell arms to Iraq, and kept up the embargo for four or
five years, ``there is nobody out there who could take their place,
except possibly China.'' That would eventually force Saddam to stop
his military aggression, Grimmett said.
   Bush hailed the transformation in American-Soviet relations that
allowed Friday's events.
   ``All the issues are on the table. We don't dodge the tough
ones, and that's been the secret to our success so far,'' Bush told
reporters in Aspen, Colo., on Thursday.
   A commentator for the Novosti news agency, Vladimir Alexeyev,
said Friday that the sudden danger of war in the Persian Gulf, just
as European tensions are disappearing, shows world peace is like a
patchwork quilt. ``As soon as a tear is mended in one place,
another appears somewhere else,'' he wrote.
   ``Under these circumstances, what is need are concentrated
efforts on the part of all nations, on all continents, to work out
a codex of international behavior that would effectively preclude
the possibility of new local wars and local armed conflicts, which
pose a threat to peace and have the potential of turning into major
conflagrations.''
   Alexeyev said the Baker-Shevardnadze meeting marked a new phase
in superpower relations, ``where egocentric ambitions are being set
aside and the two nations are beginning to work together for the
benefit of all mankind.''

   Thousands of squid have washed ashore
on a three-mile stretch of a Southern California beach, apparently
stranded as they chased after prey, officials said.
   ``Most important to state is the squid are not ill and are not
casualties of a marine pollutant,'' said Herb Frey, a marine
biologist with the state Department of Fish and Game.
   The giant squid, each measuring up to 3 feet in length and
weighing about 20 pounds, formed a 18-inch-deep ``slick'' along the
shore, officials said.
   The squid were probably chasing small fish when they began
landing on the south Orange County shoreline between Dana Point and
Monarch Bay late Thursday and early Friday, Frey said.

   Iraq said Friday it will begin withdrawing
troops from Kuwait in two days, but the U.S. State Department said
some Iraqi soliders had pushed their advance to within a few miles
of the Saudi border.
   An Iraqi government spokesman said all troops in Kuwait will be
withdrawn according to a timetable, beginning Sunday, according to
an official radio broadcast. No time was specified for complete
withdrawal.
   The government spokesman said the Iraqi troops might stay longer
if ``something cropped up that threatens Kuwait and Iraq.''
   Iraq said it invaded Kuwait on Thursday to provide security for
a provisional government that had overthrown Kuwait's rulers. The
international community dismissed that claim.
   In Washington, President Bush warned Iraq not to threaten U.S.
``vital interests,'' or try to add oil-rich Saudi Arabia to its
conquest of Kuwait. He said the United States was willing ``to help
in any way we possibly can'' to stop Iraqi aggression. Bush has
refused to rule out the use of military force.
   A NATO source said the United States had ``contingency plans''
in case Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, advanced his forces
further through the strategic region.
   In related developments:
   _The Soviet Union and United States issued a rare joint
statement demanding that all countries stop arms supplies to Iraq
and that Iraq pull out of Kuwait immediately. The Soviet Union,
Iraq's main weapons supplier, cut off shipments Thursday. Italy,
Poland and France have also cut arms deliveries to Iraq.
   The United States and France have frozen Iraqi assets, while
both countries and Britain also blocked Kuwaiti assets.
   _The United States proposed that the U.N. Security Council adopt
sweeping military, trade and economic sanctions against Iraq for
its invasion of Kuwait.
   _Japan said Friday it would go along with any economic sanctions
against Iraq that the United Nations might vote to impose.
   _Egypt broke the silence among major Arab nations and harshly
condemned the invasion. The Arab League, meeting in Cairo, also
denounced the invasion and called for Iraq to withdraw immediately.
The Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes Saudi Arabia,
similarly criticized the Iraqi attack in a statement issued in
Cairo.
   _Jordan's King Hussein met with Saddam in Baghdad, then
announced that Arab leaders would gather for a summit Sunday to
discuss the crisis. He also urged the United States not to
intervene militarily.
   _Saudi sources said there was a good chance Saddam would meet
with the ousted Kuwaiti ruler, Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, at
the summit.
   _Izzat Ibrahim of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council met in
Jiddah, Saudi Arabia with King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. He made no
statement.
   _U.S. officials sought information on 14 Americans, mostly oil
workers, missing in Kuwait who apparently were seized by Iraqi
forces. There are about 3,000 Americans in Kuwait.
   _Driven by fears of a production drop, oil prices continued to
climb. North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded international
crude, rose $2 a barrel Thursday and 86 cents more on Friday to
close at $23.25.
   Last month, oil prices were as low as $16 a barrel.
   Iraq's invasion followed two weeks of threats and accusations
against its small Persian Gulf neighbor. On July 17 Saddam accused
it of stealing oil from a field that includes land both sides
claim. He also blamed Kuwait for a fall in oil prices, saying it
contributed to the oil glut by cheating on its OPEC production
quotas.
   Iraq quickly overran Kuwait on Thursday and announced that it
would begin leaving when the situation stabilized.
   In Amman, Jordan, a senior Iraqi diplomat said Friday: ``We
believe that the national government in Kuwait can take over all
the responsibilities now and they are capable of defending their
national security.''
   Not a single member of the provisional government has been named
publicly. The Iraqi government was unable to find leading Kuwaitis
willing to cooperate with it in joining a government, said Gulf
sources outside Iraq.
   An Iraqi radio broadcast, which was also carried by a station
calling itself the Provisional Government of Kuwait Radio, said the
al-Sabah royal family that ruled Kuwait for almost 250 years will
never return to power.
   ``The bygone regime is finished forever and will never come
back,'' the spokesman said.
   In his statement, the Iraqi government spokesman said that if
anyone took action against Iraqi forces, Iraq would ``chop off his
arm from the shoulder.''
   The statement also indicated the decision to withdraw was not
made to satisfy international demands.
   ``We refuse to respond to empty chatter, here and there, by
malicious people to whom we give no weight,'' the statement said.
   Baghdad radio also carried a government statement denying
reports it was massing troops inside Kuwait along the Saudi border.
   But State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Iraqi troops
were between five and 10 miles from the Saudi border. British
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said Iraqi troops were massing along
the Saudi border.
   And residents of the Saudi border city of Khafji, reached by
telephone from Bahrain, said Iraqi troops early Friday evening had
laid down a checkpoint less than a mile from the border.
   One man, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that earlier,
``Iraqi troops almost touched the Saudi territory but went back
quite politely when the Saudi border patrols instantly alerted
them.''
   The opposite Saudi checkpoint had registered about 50,000
foreign families fleeing Kuwait since the invasion began, Saudi
border authorities said.
   An American couple living in Kuwait who fled to Saudi Arabia
after the invasion said they saw armored Iraqi personnel carriers,
howitzers, missile launchers and tanks heading toward the
Kuwait-Saudi border.
   Elizabeth Thames, 36, of Glenrock, Pa. said however, the
gathering arsenal stopped well before the frontier.
   Communication with Kuwait gradually died Friday, with telephone
and telex lines cut and radio broadcasts extremely fuzzy.
   The Iraqi army faced pockets of resistance early in the day,
according to residents and diplomats. Explosions and gunfire were
reported at the country's main military barracks in the capital and
along the coast 15 miles away.
   Diplomatic sources in Saudi Arabia said an Iraqi missile
exploded early Friday on Saudi territory area near the Kuwait,
Saudi, and Iraqi borders. It was not known if the missile was
deliberately fired into Saudi Arabia, but Saudi security forces
said in Saudi Arabia that an Iraqi jet had apparently misfired the
missile.
   There were no reports of injuries or damage in the sparsely
populated area.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters: ``We are
extremely concerned about the possibility of Iraq broadening its
invasions plans to any other country. ... They are close enough to
the Saudi border to indicate cause for concern. But we don't know
what their intentions or motives are.''
   Saudi Arabia has the most oil reserves of any country in the
world and provides the bulk of U.S. oil imports. Its troops would
likely be no match against Iraqi forces.
   Iraq has been engaged in a major defense buildup since Saddam
came to power in 1979. Its combined military forces are estimated
at 1 million. The Saudis' total armed forces number 65,700.
   Oil is Iraq's most important revenue source, and Saddam nearly
doubled his supply when he sent his army into Kuwait early Thursday
and forced the ruling family to flee to Saudi Arabia.
   France said it was sending a second warship to patrol the gulf,
joining eight U.S. Navy ships there. In addition, the USS
Independence backed by six ships was heading toward the region from
the Arabian Sea but was said to be several days away.

   There was no way out.
   Rumor had it the Saudi Arabian border and roads leading to it
were closed. The airport runway was laced with cluster bombs.
   Americans aren't used to having no options. I'm no exception.
This northern Gulf state was invaded by Iraqi troops early Thursday
and my first impulse was to get out.
   I heard shelling in the distance. I've never heard the sounds of
war. I didn't know how close the invading troops were.
   It was the not knowing that frayed the nerves. Some said it was
over, others said the worst was yet to come.
   I'd never known this kind of fear.
   The whole bizarre drama began for me at 6 a.m. Thursday. An
American friend phoned telling me the news. He said there were
casualties.
   I packed. It's funny what you think of in times of crisis. I'd
just bought a new pair of shoes the day before and I wanted to be
sure and pack them. I was leaving nearly all of my worldly
possessions behind but I had my shoes.
   Others fled immediately. Our Iranian friends packed the car and
drove their families to the south fast. I didn't even get to say
goodbye.
   A tiny shop in our apartment complex was filled with nervous
customers.
   A woman waiting in the checkout line said: ``I'm staying put. I
have my birds upstairs. I can't abandon my birds.''
   We took a short drive to see if I could get photographs. I saw a
communications tower that had been bombed.
   There were long, long lines at gas stations, at banks, at the
bakeries.
   People were wondering what would happen next. I kept asking
myself if my husband and I still had jobs. We worked for the
Kuwaiti government. But was there a Kuwaiti government?
   A friend working at the American Embassy said the shelling and
gunfire were close to her home. She had two small children who were
my 5-year-old son's playmates. We tried to joke about the situation
but it wasn't easy.
   People in downtown hotels were injured by flying glass.
   Within hours, the rumors really began to fly: The British
Embassy was fired on, the American Embassy overrun.
   News reports via satellite told us that the Emir fled to Saudi
Arabia. Both of the Emir's palaces were under Iraqi control. Iraqi
troops occupied ministries as well as the state-run radio and
television stations.
   For a few hours in the afternoon we set about organizing a trip
to Saudi Arabia and safety. But the U.S. Embassy told us to stay
put. They said the roads were blocked.
   My husband worked in the oil fields. Three of the oil rigs he
worked on were under Iraqi control. There was a rumor that
Americans on the rigs were captured by Iraqi troops.
   Charles Cumming, a drilling foreman on one of the rigs said he
saw 10 Soviet MiGs flying low over the rig.
   ``They were pretty loaded up,'' he said. ``I heard this massive
explosion,'' .
   There were rumors of casualties but no one knew how many died.
   The shelling got louder, or seemed to. The panic grew.
   We decided to ignore the American Embassy and try to get out. It
seemed worth the risk to get away from the fighting and we made it.
   My hands are still shaking.
   We drove about 60 miles from Ahmadi in southern Kuwait to the
Saudi border.
   For the first 24 miles of our tense trip we saw thousands of
confident, smiling Iraqi troops. Many waved us on our way.
   At least 100 tanks were parked not far from an Ahmadi
administration building. Some young soldiers were making themselves
at home by looting a small neighborhood store.
   As we ventured further south, we saw armored personnel carriers,
howitzers, missile launchers and tanks. They were heading south,
the direction of the Kuwait-Saudi border. The gathering arsenal
stopped well before the actual frontier.
   Anyone with identification documents was waived across the
border.
   Within minutes after leaving Kuwait we were greeted with hugs
and tears by other joyous Americans and Britons. We saw about 100
who had managed to escape.
   We traded war stories during the hours it took to get Saudi
visas and clear customs.

   Stephen Sondheim's ``A Little Night Music,''
cast with actors who sang or stabbed at singing on Broadway in
1973, has entered the repertory of the New York City Opera in a
classy production, with singers who act very well.
   Presented for the first time Friday night at the New York State
Theater, it's probably the best of the hybrids the company has
attempted. The voices all were good but never ``too operatic.''
   Sally Ann Howes, the second Eliza in ``My Fair Lady'' on
Broadway, played the actress Desiree who gets to sing the show's
best-known song, ``Send in the Clowns.'' She did it with poignant
musing, the way it fits into the plot.
   Regina Resnik, from 1944 through '83 at the Metropolitan Opera
and since then on Broadway in ``Cabaret,'' played her mother,
Madame Armfeldt. She has the best lines to speak and her timing and
delivery were perfection. She did full justice to ``Liaisons,'' her
reminiscenses of affairs. Most importantly, Miss Resnik was never
vulgar.
   The production is elaborate and highly effective, with many
scene changes. People dressed as maids and butlers swiftly carried
and slid furniture in and out. A mansion front arrived from above.
Much of the time blue sky with white clouds on the backdrop was
reflected on the floor, setting mood.
   The plot, based on Ingmar Bergman's film ``Smiles of a Summer
Night,'' has many facets. Fredrik Egerman (George Lee Andrews) has
a young wife (Beverly Lambert) and a son (Kevin Anderson) who loves
the young wife.
   His former mistress, Desiree, now is the mistress of Count
Malcolm (Michael Maguire), whose wife (Maureen Moore) makes the
most of the second best set of lines.
   There's a lusty maid (Susan Terry) who gets to sing ``For I Will
Marry the Miller's Son.'' And there's Desiree's daughter, looking
like Alice in Wonderland and played with winning solemnity by
Danielle Ferland.
   It was an amusing idea to cast a count not only younger but a
great deal taller than Fredrik Egerman.
   We enjoyed this ``A Little Night Music'' more than its Broadway
presentation. Because it has so many different couples and
entanglements and different ages and levels of experience, it is
easily compared with ``Aspects of Love,'' now on Broadway. ``A
Little Night Music'' seems real and wise and ``Aspects of Love''
seems more than ever to have been charted on graph paper.
   Scott Ellis directed. Paul Gemignani conducted a large
orchestra. Michael Anania designed the set, with a raked stage at
the back. Lindsay W. Davis designed costlumes and Dawn Chiang
designed lighting.
   ``A Little Night Music'' has been scheduled for five
performances in August and six in October.

   Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher
indicated the United States may soon lift the trade embargo against
Vietnam.
   He made his remarks Friday before U.S. businessmen, who urged
him to renew the trade ties that were cut when the Communists won
the Vietnam War in 1975.
   Mosbacher said lifting of the embargo was ``still over the
horizon but, depending on the talks, it could appear shortly.''
   In a letter addressed to him, the American Chamber of Commerce
in Thailand said U.S. companies are ``losing out on the potential
Vietnam offers on many economic fronts.''
   Washington has said a settlement of the Cambodian war must be
reached before relations are normalized with Vietnam, which backs
Cambodia's Communist government.
   However, the United States reversed a longstanding policy last
month, announcing it would enter into direct negotiations with
Vietnam on Cambodia.

   The military says it has captured
another rebel officer said to be involved in the failed December
coup against President Corazon Aquino.
   The officer, 1st Lt. Paul Pompeyo Dario, 30, was arrested
Thursday at his mountain hideout in Maria Aurora in Aurora province
about 90 miles northeast of Manila, said Maj. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon,
the armed forces vice chief of staff.
   Dario was found on a tip from a civilian informant, Biazon said.
Troops seized a .45 caliber pistol, but Dario offered no resistance.
   Biazon said 89 officers involved in the attempt are still at
large; about 21 are undergoing trial, and 60 other officers are
under investigation.
   The mutiny left at least 113 people dead and more than 600
wounded, he said.

<HEAD>House Approves Caribbean Trade Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House early Saturday gave final
congressional approval to legislation making permanent the
duty-free status on imports from 24 Caribbean and Central American
nations, including Nicaragua and Panama.
   By a voice vote, the House passed a trade bill extending
permanently the duty-free status of $4 billion a year in imports
under former President Reagan's 1983 Caribbean Basin Initiative.
But the House refused to expand it to cover imports of textiles,
shoes, sugar and ethanol that might threaten U.S. farmers and jobs.
   The Senate approved the bill earlier this week after lawmakers
had spent nearly two months hammering out differences between its
and the House's version. The bill now goes to the White House for
President Bush's signature.
   In addition to the CBI, the bill also makes permanent what had
been a year-to-year ban on the export of raw logs from federal land
and also from state lands in California, Oregon and Alaska. Exports
from state-owned land in Washington would be reduced but not halted.
   The log measure is intended to preserve the Pacific Northwest's
dwindling timber supply for domestic mills along with enough
old-growth stands to save the northern spotted owl from extinction.
   Exports of logs from privately owned lands would still be
allowed but the timber industry generally would be prohibited from
substituting them for logs from federal lands as a way to escape
the ban.
   The Caribbean Basin Initiative was intended to lift the region's
depressed economy through a combination of direct aid and an
elimination of tariffs and other trade barriers to encourage the
development of export-oriented businesses.
   Excluded from duty-free importation, however, were textiles,
clothing, dinnerware, luggage, shoes and other ``sensitive'' goods
that compete with U.S.-made products. Import quotas also were kept
on sugar.
   Critics say the initiative has failed to large degree because
the direct government-to-government aid fell victim to U.S. budget
deficits and drastically reduced imports of oil, petroleum products
and sugar from the region.
   In 1983, when the initiative began, Caribbean and Central
American exports to the United States totaled nearly $8.8 billion.
By 1988 they had dropped to $6 billion. To protect domestic sugar
growers, for example, annual import quotas have been reduced from
3.2 million tons to 1.2 million over the past seven years.

<HEAD>Education Department to Cover Defaulted Loans</HEAD>

   Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos, with the
academic year approaching, is quickening efforts to make sure banks
continue to grant student loans.
   Cavazos said Friday a deal will be announced within a few weeks
to cover the defaulted loans guaranteed by the financially troubled
Higher Education Assistance Foundation, or HEAF, of Overland Park,
Kan., one of the nation's largest insurers of those loans.
   ``We are intensively involved in sensitive discussions with
other organizations that have an interest in and capacity for
assuming all of HEAF's guarantee functions,'' Cavazos told the
Senate Labor and Human Resources education subcommittee.
   ``We are committed to putting in place a solution that will
ensure that new loans are made and insured without interruption,
and that the existing HEAF portfolio is properly serviced,
collected, insured and reinsured,'' he said.
   He told the panel the arrangement would be in place ``within a
few weeks.''
   Education Department spokeswoman Etta Fielek said it is unlikely
HEAF will survive the restructuring.
   The financially threatened foundation guarantees student loans
in Minnesota, West Virginia, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming and the
District of Columbia, and insures loans in other states as well.
   HEAF, one of 47 guarantors nationwide, told the Education
Department four weeks ago it was having serious financial problems
because of a high default rate.
   The foundation blamed the problem on overlending to students who
attend private trade and technical schools, students from largely
low-income backgrounds who either drop out or earn too little after
graduation to repay the loans.
   Cavazos, who has already tightened regulations on loans for
students at private trade schools, said he will seek further
restrictions on their accreditation and licensing next year.
   He also said regulations will be published next week aimed at
barring false information from the schools.
   Under the student loan program, banks make the student loans and
groups such as HEAF guarantee that they will be repaid and take
over collection. The federal Student Loan Marketing Association,
known as Sallie Mae, provides money to lenders by selling packages
of loans to investors.
   The Education Department is the backup insurer to the
guarantors. The taxpayers must make up the difference between the
default liability and what the department takes in through loan
fees and collections.
   The department said last week that the taxpayer costs for the
troubled foundation would not surpass $100 million.
   Several alternatives have been suggested for the bailout: a
takeover by Sallie Mae; a takeover by Indianapolis-based United
Student Aid Funds, another large guarantor; and a spreading out of
the bad loans over a number of agencies.

<HEAD>Soviet Students May Be Drafted To Help with Harvest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   College students may be ordered to help bring in a
bumper Soviet harvest and delay the opening of their fall terms by
one month, according to Vladilen Nikitin, director of the state
food commission.
   Nikitin said Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov signed an order
Friday drafting at least 15 percent of the nation's civilian trucks
to help with the harvest.
   The officials Tass news agency reported Thursday that tens of
thousands of soldiers and even KGB personnel are harvesting a grain
crop estimated at a record 260 million tons.
   ``We have to consider it reasonable to draft students for a
month, to permit deans to postpone studies for a month,'' Nikitin
told the ``Vremya'' TV news program Friday.
   The Soviets are already losing 2 million tons a day because they
cannot harvest and store the grain fast enough. Soviet news media
blamed shortages of fuel, trucks and storage space, as well as the
centrally planned economy's inability to adjust to the demand.
   The government has already sent 70 army battalions with 35,000
trucks to help with the harvest, and Tass said another 20
battalions with 10,000 trucks will be added.

<HEAD>Executive Says S&amp;L Deal Saved Taxpayers $100 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An insurance executive whose acquisition of 15
failed savings and loans has been labeled a sweetheart deal says
the transaction saved taxpayers more than $100 million.
   James M. Fail of Phoenix said the collection of Texas thrifts
that he now operates under the name of Bluebonnet Savings Bank of
Dallas ``is part of the solution to the savings and loan crisis,
not part of the problem.''
   ``Bluebonnet already has saved the American taxpayer over $100
million as compared with continuing the operations of the 15
insolvent thrifts,'' Fail said in testimony scheduled for delivery
Monday to the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee. The remarks
were distributed to reporters Friday.
   Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, the subcommittee chairman,
has sharply criticized the deal between Fail and the now-defunct
Federal Home Loan Bank Board. He said Fail acquired the thrifts and
was awarded government subsidies valued at $1.8 billion after
investing only $1,000 of his own money.
   Fail borrowed the rest of his initial $70 million investment,
half of it from an insurance company he controls, Metzenbaum said.
   But in his statement, Fail said ``substantially all'' of the
government assistance ``ultimately will go to depositors and
creditors of the 15 failed thrifts, paying for mistakes made long
before I ever heard of any of those thrifts.''
   He said Bluebonnet's profits ``do not depend solely on
government largesse _ they depend on managing the institution
well,'' he said.
   Fail said the suggestion that he acquired Bluebonnet for $1,000
was ``ridiculous.'' He said he was committed eventually to invest a
total of $120 million, has invested $95 million so far and had
``pledged substantially all of my business holdings as collateral
for personal loans'' in the deal.
   Further, he said, Bluebonnet has distributed no earnings to its
shareholders and as chairman of the institution he receives only an
$18,000 annual retainer and a $1,000 fee per meeting.
   A $35 million loan for the acquisition from an insurance company
he controls has been a good deal for the company's policyholders,
he said, noting that the loan has paid $6.4 million in interest.
   Metzenbaum has questioned why the bank board did not disqualify
Fail as an acquirer because a company he controlled had pleaded
guilty to fraud in 1976 in Alabama. But Fail said he had repeatedly
disclosed his legal problems.

   Anti-government protesters who have put

supporters and will fight for more democracy despite the election
of an opposition intellectual as president.
   Protest leaders expressed confidence that Zhelyu Zhelev, the
philosopher chosen Bulgaria's first non-Communist president in
decades, and his deputy Atanas Semerdzhiev, a reformed Communist,
will bring more democracy to Bulgaria.
   ``The conservative Communist forces are giving in, although
slowly,'' said a declaration read at a news conference Friday. But
the protesters swore to continue their struggle for more democracy,
especially in towns and regions outside the capital of Sofia.
   The parliamentary opposition, the 16-party Union of Democratic
Forces alliance, meanwhile elected Petar Beron, a biologist and
zoologist, to replace Zhelev, who led the alliance in June's free
elections and became president Wednesday.

<HEAD>Diagnosis Of Disease in Human Egg Called Important Advance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new technique that allows diagnosis of
inherited diseases in an unfertilized human egg before conception
is being described as an important step toward the prevention of
genetic diseases.
   On Friday, researchers reported that they had diagnosed cystic
fibrosis in a human egg before conception. They said the technique
could be used with many other inherited ailments, including
muscular dystrophy, hemophilia and sickle cell anemia.
   The technique could satisfy some abortion opponents' objections
to fetal diagnosis, said Yury Verlinsky, director of the
Reproductive Genetics Institute at Illinois Masonic Medical Center
in Chicago.
   These diseases can now be diagnosed in the fetus before birth.
But such diagnosis often leaves the parents with no option but to
terminate the pregnancy if the fetus carries the disease.
   The new technique of pre-conception diagnosis makes abortion
unnecessary, Verlinsky said in a telephone interview.
   ``I feel it's going to be the technique of choice for the
families who are carriers for genetic diseases,'' he said. ``It's
better to avoid abortion and to have this technique to conceive
only a normal child.
   ``I get letters from right-to-life people who say this is good
research,'' Verlinsky said.
   Dr. Norbert Gleicher, director of the Center for Human
Reproduction at Mount Sinai Hospital in Chicago, called it ``a
very, very important advance. In practical terms, this is a very
important step and a very smart concept.''
   An important limitation of the technique is that it can be used
only in conjunction with in-vitro fertilization or IVF, the
``test-tube baby'' technique in which an egg is fertilized in a
laboratory dish and the resulting embryo is implanted in the
mother's womb.
   ``IVF, which is what you're involved in, has a limited success
rate,'' said Dr. Laird Jackson, director of the division of medical
genetics at Thomas Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia.
   In other words, many eggs judged to be free of disease using
pre-conception diagnosis will fail to result in births because of
the difficulties of in-vitro fertilization.
   Nevertheless, technical advances in the future could change
that, Jackson said. And pre-conception diagnosis was clearly of
value for parents who are opposed to abortion, he said.
   Last November, Verlinsky reported the development of the new
technique at a meeting of the American Society of Human Genetics.
His report of the pre-conception diagnosis of cystic fibrosis
appears in today's issue of The Lancet, a British medical journal.
   The technique makes use of a cell called a polar body that is
discarded by an egg as it matures, Verlinsky said. An immature egg
contains a pair of each of the 23 human chromosomes.
   As the egg matures, it discards one set of chromosomes in the
polar body and retains one set. The sperm that later fertilizes the
egg imports a set of the father's chromosomes, so the fertilized
egg is back to full strength with a pair of each chromosome.
   Verlinsky analyzes the genes in the polar body to determine
whether the remaining genes in the egg carry the cystic fibrosis
defect.
   On Thursday, Dr. Alan Handyside and colleagues at Hammersmith
Hospital in London reported the first birth of children who were
examined for genetic diseases by screening test-tube embryos before
the embryos were implanted in their mothers.
   In that technique, an egg fertilized in a test tube is allowed
to divide until it forms an embryo of eight cells. One cell is
removed and analyzed for genetic defects. If the embryo is healthy,
it is implanted in the mother's womb.
   Verlinsky, who has also experimented with that technique, said
it could be used in conjunction with the pre-conception screening
in circumstances in which the pre-conception screening alone was
not enough to assure that the fetus did not carry a genetic disease.
   The research team at Hammersmith Hospital also is experimenting

   The pre-conception diagnosis of cystic fibrosis currently is
limited to children of the 70 percent of cystic-fibrosis carriers
with the most common of the many genetic mutations that can cause
the disease, Verlinsky said.

   Roseanne Barr is hearing some cheers again.
   About 100 fans showed up to support the star of the popular
television comedy series ``Roseanne'' on her arrival Friday at
Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.
   Supporters held up signs such as ``Barr None Roseanne. You're
No. 1. Keep singing those Barrs'' and ``Welcome Roseanne. Have a
spit'n good time in the Twin Cities.''
   Barr has been under fire since singing a shrill rendition of
``The Star Spangled Banner'' at a San Diego Padres game last week.
Barr, loudly booed by the crowd, capped the performance by grabbing
her crotch and spitting on the ground in what she said was a parody
of a baseball pitcher.
   The rally was organized by Lori Peterson, a recent University of
Minnesota Law School graduate who told Barr she was the victim of
sexism. ``We believe it's not so much what she did, but rather who
did it,'' Peterson said.
   Barr said she doesn't know if people would have been as upset
had the performance come from a male comedian.
   Barr, also a standup comic, is scheduled to perform tonight in
St. Paul, Minn.

   Actor Timothy Busfield, who allegedly threatened
to boycott ``thirtysomething'' unless he got a hefty raise, is
returning to work after settling a dispute with the makers of the
acclaimed ABC series.
   Busfield plays the advertising executive whose wife's battle
with ovarian cancer is expected to be a key part of the show's
coming season. He was nominated Thursday for an Emmy award.
   David Gerber, chairman of the MGM-UA Television Production
Group, said Friday the studio had settled a dispute with the actor.
   On Wednesday, the studio filed a lawsuit that alleged breach of
contract and said Busfield had threatened to boycott the show.
Busfield wanted $36,375 an episode, while MGM-UA had offered him
$28,750 per episode, the lawsuit said. MGM-UA spokeswoman Lori
Gerson wouldn't say if the lawsuit has been dropped. Production of
the series' fourth season began Friday in Los Angeles.

<HEAD>House Boosts Federal Borrowing Limit by $72 Billion</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: LEADS with 3 grafs to UPDATE with Senate vote on debt limit;

<TEXT>
   The Senate early Saturday voted to let the
government sink $72 billion deeper into debt over the next two
months, a cash infusion designed to avert an unprecedented federal
default.
   The Senate passed the bill by voice vote after the House on
Friday cleared the bill by a vote of 247-172.
   The bill, requested by President Bush, would provide enough
money to keep federal coffers full through Oct. 2.
   Last Tuesday, the House approved a longer-term extension of the
debt limit providing $322 billion in borrowing authority. But that
measure, the target of possible amendments in the Senate, is not
expected to move toward enactment until after Congress' August
recess.
   The Treasury has warned that the government will run out of
money by Aug. 15 unless its authority to borrow money is extended.
With Congress poised to begin its month-long August recess at the
close of business Friday, lawmakers had to approve the measure
before leaving the capital.
   By Aug. 15, the government is expected to deplete its
cash-on-hand. In doing so, the total federal debt will hit a record
$3.12 trillion.
   The government has never defaulted on its payments. If it did
so, economists say interest rates would skyrocket and financial
markets could be badly shaken.
   ``Failure to enact the bill would result in disastrous economic,
political and financial consequences,'' said House Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.
   Because debt limit extensions are must-pass legislation, they
consistently attract unrelated amendments that would have little
chance of passage on their own.
   Oct. 2 is the second day of fiscal 1991.
   It is a date by which Bush administration and congressional
budget negotiators would like to complete their work on a
deficit-reduction deal.
   Because any budget-cutting pact would contain unpopular tax
increases and spending cuts, budget bargainers would like to attach
their package to the next extension of the debt limit.

<HEAD>TV Coverage of Iraqi Invasion a ``Dark Spot''</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Kuwait was filled with the tanks and soldiers of
the invading Iraqi army, but for a second day, the U.S. networks
were unable to get pictures of the combat from the scene.
   Network news made do Friday with arrow-filled maps; phone
interviews with reporters, business executives and others inside
Kuwait's capital city; file footage taken before the invasion, and
related reports from around the world.
   But with Kuwait's airport closed and outsiders barred, network
correspondents in the area _ including CBS anchorman Dan Rather _
and their camera crews had to do their reporting from neighboring
Persian Gulf countries.
   Rather was vacationing in Europe when the invasion began. He
rushed to the Middle East to join CBS correspondents there,
officials at CBS said.
   Correspondents were not allowed into Kuwait or Iraq, said
officials at CBS, NBC, ABC and Cable News Network.
   In one Gulf state that let correspondents file taped reports via
satellite, jittery officials, fearful of angering Iraq, asked them
not to mention the country from which they were reporting, network
executives said.
   It resulted in correspondents ending their stories by simply
saying they were reporting ``from the Gulf.''
   Network producers in the Middle East remained tuned to telecasts
from Baghdad, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia for news footage from Kuwait.
But it was in vain, executives said Friday.
   In a major story like this, some sort of footage from the scene
usually turns up, ``but this one has just been a dark spot,'' said
Ed Turner, CNN's vice president for news gathering.
   It was particularly frustrating for ABC News, which had
videotape taken Thursday inside Kuwait.
   ``We have pictures in Kuwait, but we haven't been able to get
them out,'' said Robert Murphy, ABC's vice president for news
coverage. He said he didn't know what shots were on the videotape.

<HEAD>Stark to Sullivan: ``I Blew It''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan says he is frustrated that he cannot express his own
political beliefs without suffering ``race-based criticism.''
   Sullivan, in a speech in Los Angeles Friday night to the
National Association of Black Journalists, was referring to a
remark by Rep. Fortney ``Pete'' Stark, D-Calif., that Sullivan was
a ``disgrace to his race and his profession'' because of
administration policy on health care for the poor.
   ``I guess I should feel ashamed because Congressman Stark thinks
I am not a `good Negro,''' Sullivan said. ``As a Cabinet member who
has spent almost four decades of my life dedicated to healing, ...
(I) am unable to express my own views without being subject to
race-based criticism by those who are not ready to accept
independent thinking by a black man.''
   Sullivan called the remarks by Stark, a chairman of a House
health subcommittee, ``incomprehensibly offensive.''
   Both Sullivan and the administration had demanded an apology
after the Thursday remarks.
   Friday on the House floor, Stark, who is white, conceded that
``I blew it'' by injecting race into his criticism of a black
cabinet member for backing Bush administration policies.
   But Stark told the House he stood by his main point _ that
administration policies are harming blacks and the poor _ and
regretted that race had obscured his complaint.
   ``To the secretary, I have to say I blew it,'' Stark told the
House. ``I should not have brought into the discussion his race,
because it obscures the fact he is carrying on a bankrupt policy
...''
   Sullivan spokesman Bob Schmermund said Stark's latest comments
were not the apology Sullivan was looking for.
   ``He was right about one thing: he blew it. Other than that, we
certainly don't view what he said on the House floor as anything
close to an apology,'' he said.
   The White House called Stark's remrks a ``bigoted assault.''
   Before Stark spoke, House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill.,
led a series of Republican critics on the House floor. He charged
that Stark had brought ``discredit on this institution,'' demanded
an apology and called Stark's attack ``as bizarre as it is
deplorable.''
   ``No matter how heated our debate may be, no one has a right to
bring into question a man's race or religion or national origin,''
Michel said.
   Stark rose moments later and said Michel ``is absolutely right.
To bring in race or religion ... into a policy debate is wrong.''
   But he repeated his complaints that Sullivan was going along
with Bush administration policies that hurt the poor and
minorities. He said the policies were denying them decent medical
care, job training, extended unemployment benefits, and denying
abortions for poor women.
   Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown, who is black, said in a
prepared statement that he was glad Stark had ``clarified his
original intent.''
   ``I do not believe that Mr. Sullivan is a disgrace to his
race,'' Brown said. ``However, I do think that many of the Bush
administration's policies, like Reagan's policies before him, are
disgraceful. I believe that is the point that Congressman Stark was
trying to make.''
   The Republican National Committee then entered the argument,
saying Stark's ``unfair, unwarranted and shameless'' attack
warranted strong language from Brown. ``Since Stark only half
concedes he was wrong, Chairman Brown needs to step up and condemn
him,'' GOP consultant Charles Black said in the RNC statement.
Black is filling it for the ailing GOP Chairman Lee Atwater.
   Rep. Craig Washington, D-Texas, who is black, rose in Stark's
defense. He told the House that if Republicans were sincere in
denouncing the racial remarks, he hoped they would vote for the
civil rights bill before the House.
   Stark made his initial remarks Thursday in response to questions
at a news conference on another subject. He refused to apologize at
a second news conference later that day.
   Stark accused Sullivan of switching to an anti-abortion position
at the urging of administration officials and opposing expanded
federal health coverage to the uninsured for the same reason. The
two differ on those issues and also over federally sponsored
national health insurance, which Stark is pushing and Sullivan said
last month he opposes.

<HEAD>NEA Advisers Vote to Delete Artists' Anti-Obscenity Pledge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The advisory body of the National Endowment
for the Arts is pushing for the elimination of an anti-obscenity
pledge that artists and arts institutions must sign before they can
receive federal grants.
   After an emotional debate, the National Council on the Arts
urged endowment chairman John E. Frohnmayer on Friday to stop
requiring grant recipients to agree in writing to comply with a
congressional ban on using federal funds for works that might be
deemed obscene.
   The 17-2 vote by the presidentially appointed council is not
binding on Frohnmayer. ``I'm going to consider it and take my
action in due course,'' said Frohnmayer.
   The motion to remove the anti-obscenity pledge was sponsored by
council member Roy Goodman, a New York state senator and arts
patron, who called it ``a loyalty oath reminiscent of the McCarthy
era'' of anti-communist witch hunts led by Sen. Joseph McCarthy,
R-Wis., in the 1950s.
   Goodman said the pledge insulted and alienated the arts
community and worsened the furor surrounding the endowment. ``The
artist knows what the law is,'' he said. ``We don't have to rub his
nose in it.''
   Frohnmayer instituted the pledge after conservative lawyers led
by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., persuaded Congress last October to
amend the arts endowment's current $171 million budget to include a
prohibition against federal support for obscene art.
   The ban, prompted by protests over an NEA-supported exhibition
of works by the late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, includes
``depictions of sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the sexual
exploitation of children or individuals engaged in sex acts.''
   Frohnmayer placed the text of the anti-obscenity ban in the
regulations that govern the award of endowment grants. Of the 2,000
NEA grants approved by early July, a dozen recipients have signed
the pledge under protest, a half-dozen have refused to sign and
forfeited their grants, and two have challenged the requirement in
federal court.
   At Frohnmayer's urging, the council amended Goodman's motion to
make clear that it did not relieve NEA grant recipients of the need
to comply with anti-obscenity law. Without such a qualification,
Frohnmayer said, ``the signal might be that the endowment is
thumbing its nose at the law.''
   The council was beginning a three-day meeting devoted mostly to
reviewing grant applications approved by the endowment's panels of
outside experts in dance, theater, music and other arts disciplines.
   Council member Lloyd Richards, dean of the Yale School of Drama,
said the controversy over obscene art had injected fear into the
arts community and threatened to transform the NEA into a
``National Endowment for the Agreeable.''
   Another member, Phyllis Berney, an arts patron and former member
of the Wisconsin Arts Board, said the endowment had lost public
confidence because of the Mapplethorpe exhibit and other
``offensive art.''
   ``First Amendment rights are an issue for lawyers,'' she said,
saying the real issue is ``a handful of individuals who want to
shock, and do it with public funds.''
   Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., chairman of a House subcommittee
that oversees the arts endowment, warned there is ``no chance''
that Congress will authorize an extension of the NEA this year
without some form of restrictions on obscenity.
   Williams won loud applause from council members and spectators
who crowded into the hearing room when, in a reference to
Mapplethorpe, he denounced the ``howling mob of people hurling
epithets at a dead, gay male artist'' and other artists whose works
are controversial.

   The United States is sending a third aircraft
carrier and 15,000 sailors and Marines toward the Middle East early
next week to bolster its naval armada in the Persian Gulf crisis,
Pentagon officials say.
   As military strategists and lawmakers debated the dangers of
committing U.S. combat troops to a protracted desert war against
Iraqi tanks, it was clear that the immediate U.S. response to
Iraq's seizure of oil-rich Kuwait was to focus on a show of naval
strength.
   Officials said 15 naval vessels led by the carrier Saratoga and
including a Marine amphibious assault unit will leave East Coast
ports on Monday and Tuesday for the Mediterranean.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams refused to link the latest ship
movements with the gulf crisis, saying they had been planned for
months. Although the Saratoga had been scheduled to relieve the USS
Eisenhower, he said, the two carriers might remain together on duty
in the Mediterranean for a while.
   The Eisenhower was deployed in the region in March. Its Marine
amphibious unit has been stationed off the coast of strife-torn
Liberia for several weeks.
   The carrier Independence already is steaming toward waters
outside the Persian Gulf from the Indian Ocean to back up the U.S.
Navy's task force of eight warships already stationed inside the
gulf.
   While the United States is focusing for the time being on naval
maneuvers, concerns were expressed at the Pentagon and on Capitol
Hill about the implications of sending American troops into battle
against Iraq's 5,500 tanks and million-man army.
   Even though billions of dollars in U.S. arms have been sold to
Saudi Arabia over the years, its 65,000-man army is largely
untested on the battlefield. Just last month, the Saudis signed an
agreement to buy $3 billion of the U.S. Army's most advance tanks,
the M-1A2s, but they aren't scheduled for delivery until the
mid-1990s.
   Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., former chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, told NBC the United States could ``dominate the gulf from
a naval standpoint (and) we can dominate them in the air,'' but
that landing U.S. combat troops ``would be a major problem.''
   Military observers note that most Mideast nations friendly to
the United States have refused to allow U.S. bases on their
territory.
   The closest major ground forces available to the United States
are based in Western Europe or on the island of Diego Garcia in the
Indian Ocean, a week to 10 days away from the Persian Gulf region
by sea.
   ``We were impotent 10 years ago in the hostage crisis and we're
impotent now,'' said one military analyst, who spoke only on
condition that he not be identified.
   ``We have no infrastructure there to accept any kind of land
forces. No way to get water, food, fuel _ let alone tanks and
trucks _ to support a land war,'' he said.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney met with Bush at the White House
on Friday and then reviewed Iraqi military moves and U.S. options
with Gen. Colin Powell and other members of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff.
   The possibility of an Iraqi thrust into Saudi Arabia worried
members of Congress. Lawmakers who attended secret briefings on the
crisis said the 120,000 Iraqi troops massed along their southern
border could easily attack the Saudis next.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said such a development would
raise ``the most serious security questions'' for the United States
and ``would call for a direct military response by the United
States, Western Europe, maybe even the Soviet Union.''
   Added Foley: ``This would be an action that could not be
ignored.''
   The Saratoga will be accompanied by the guided missile cruiser
Philippine Sea, the destroyer Spruance, guided missile destroyer
Sampson and frigate Elm R. Montgomery, all based in Mayport, Fla.
   Departing Norfolk, Va., will be the battleship Wisconsin, guided
missile cruiser Biddle, frigate Thomas C. Hart and destroyer tender
Yellowstone. The fast combat support ship Detroit, based in Earle,
N.J., will also join the battle group, the Pentagon said.
   Those nine ships are scheduled to leave on Tuesday. They will be
preceded on Monday by five ships that make up the Marine amphibious
ready group.
   Those are the amphibious assault ship Inchon and the amphibious
transport dock Nashville, both based in Norfolk, and the dock
landing ship Whidbey Island and tank landing ships Newport and
Fairfax County, based in Little Creek, Va.
   Carriers are normally outfitted with a wide array of missiles
and firepower, including FA-18 jet fighters, F-4 attack aircraft
and A-6E bombers.
   Currently, there are 18 U.S. Navy ships in the Mediterranean
with about 10,000 personnel aboard, Pentagon sources said.
   Inside the gulf, the U.S. military presence is represented by
eight warships of the Joint Task Force Middle East, led by the
command ship USS LaSalle and including a cruiser, destroyer and
frigates.

   Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall is
recovering in a hospital after a fall earlier in the week in
Chicago, a court spokeswoman said.
   Marshall, 82, was admitted to the National Naval Medical Center
in Bethesda, Md., where he was listed in stable condition, said
Toni House.
   She said Marshall, who was in Chicago to speak at the annual
convention of the American Bar Association, stumbled in the lobby
of his hotel Thursday evening.
   He flew back to Washington Friday ``because he prefers
consulting with physicians he knows,'' said House, adding it did
not appear he had broken any bones in the fall.
   She said Marshall does not plan to return to Chicago, where he
was scheduled to address a dinner of the ABA's Judicial
Administration Division Monday night.
   Marshall, a staunch liberal on the court, has had several health
problems in recent years. He had a heart attack in 1976 and has
suffered bouts of pneumonia and bronchitis.
   He was treated at the National Naval Medical Center in 1987 for
a blood clot in his right foot.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drinking water in many small communities falls
below federal health requirements and in some cases violations are
being hidden by improper tests or falsified records, a
congressional study says.
   The General Accounting Office said in a report released Friday
that an investigation of compliance to drinking water standards at
75 community water systems in six states showed many local
authorities are not complying with the federal requirements.
   The study also said that efforts by the Environmental Protection
Agency to uncover violations and take enforcement actions against
the local water officials frequently are ineffective.
   ``We found that many water systems, particularly smaller
systems, are violating requirements for monitoring water quality
and meeting drinking water standards,'' Richard Hembra, the GAO's
director for environmental issues, told a House Government
Operations subcommittee.
   The Environmental Protection Agency acknowledged problems with
getting small community water systems to comply with federal clean
water requirements.
   She also acknowledged that some violations of federal drinking
water standards go unreported because of erroneous information from
local officials or inadequate monitoring by states.
   Nevertheless, Ms. Wilcher maintained that said the most serious
violations have been resolved and in that available reports showed
that 73 percent of the community water systems, serving 183 million
people, were complying with federal health standards for drinking
water in 1989.
   According to the GAO report, however, those statistics may
overstate compliance nationwide.

<HEAD>One Clean Air Issue Disposed of By Conference Committee</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate and House negotiators on clean air
legislation reached agreement on a schedule for ending, by the
close of the decade, use of chemicals that damage the ozone layer.
   But leaders acknowledged Friday the most difficult issues of the
legislation have yet to be discussed.
   Among other provisions, the negotiators agreed to forbid states
and local governments from restricting or banning the chemicals for
two years.
   The conference committee is not scheduled to meet again until
after the August congressional recess. House and Senate staffers
were directed to work through the month to draft possible
compromises on various parts of the two bills.
   Negotiators said they hoped the agreement on ozone-destroying
chemicals would help break the deadlock.
   That agreement calls for phasing out such chemicals, including
chlorofluorocarbons, halons and carbon tetrachloride, widely used
as coolants, solvents and foam blowing agents, by the end of the
decade.
   Some substitute chemicals that are less harmful to the
environment such as HCFCs _ chlorofluorocarbons that contain one or
more hydrogen atoms _ would be phased out over the next 40 years.
   The measure also calls for recylcing of these chemicals by 1992,
and the installation of precautions to prevent routine release into
the air.

<HEAD>Creditors File Bankruptcy Petition Against Stotler Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An involuntary bankruptcy petition has been filed
against Stotler Group Inc., a brokerage company formerly headed by
the newly resigned chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Stotler Group said in a statement Friday night that the petition
originated with ``three parties claiming to be creditors'' holding
more than $1 million in unpaid obligations.
   Money troubles plaguing Stotler Group resulted in the recent
announcement that its principal subsidiary, Stotler and Co., was
getting out of the futures trading business.
   That announcement led to the resignation Wednesday of Karsten
Mahlmann as chairman of the company and chairman of the world's
largest futures market.
   Thomas M. Egan, president and chief executive officer of Stotler
Group, said the company had been in negotiations with the creditors
in efforts to reach a solution.
   ``Our intention and desire was to avert a filing in bankruptcy
by developing a workable plan to cooperate with and maximize the
return to creditors,'' Egan said.
   ``However, it appears unlikely that any return to shareholders
of Stotler Group will be possible under the current
circumstances,'' he said.
   The petition names only Stotler Group Inc., and does not affect
Stotler and Co. or its other holdings.
   Stotler and Co. was one of the largest brokerage firms before it
announced its plan to liquidate its futures business.
   Stotler Group identified the petitioners as Advanced Portfolio
Management, which holds a $1 million unpaid note of the Stotler
Group, and two parties that received part of $4.15 million in
defaulted commercial paper held by Compass Futures.
   Advanced Portfolio Management and Compass Futures are pooled
investment funds operated by Stotler Funds Inc., another Stotler
Group subsidiary.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission earlier this week
accused Stotler Funds of improperly talking money from APM and
Compass to help bolster its parent company.
   The funds were supposed to be used only for investment in
commodity markets.
   Mahlmann has denied any involvement in Stotler's recent
financial decisions, saying he had spent almost all his time
running the Board of Trade.

   Congress early today extended for an extra
month President Bush's authority to tap the nation's Strategic
Petroleum Reserve should Iraq's invasion of Kuwait disrupt the
world oil market.
   On a voice vote with no dissent, the House approved an emergency
temporary extension of the Energy Policy Conservation Act that
established the rainy-day stockpile in the event of another oil
disruption.
   Without the extension, Bush's authority to pump crude oil from
the stockpile to relieve shortages would expire Aug. 15 while
Congress is on vacation. The Senate passed the same bill Thursday.
   ``Given the events in the Middle East with respect to Kuwait, it
would be unwise to leave town without extending the current law,''
Rep. Norman Lent, R-N.Y., said.
   The stockpile, stored in salt caverns along the Louisiana-Texas
coast and accumulated at a cost of more than $20 billion over the
past decade, now has 580 million barrels, enough to replace imports
from abroad for 50 days at current import levels.
   Congress and the administration have been battling the past 18
months over whether to increase the reserve to 1 billion barrels in
view of growing U.S. dependency on foreign oil. Bush has opposed
increasing the reserve beyond 750 million barrels.

<HEAD>Report: 120 Iraqi Officers Executed for Refusing to Fight Kuwait</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading Egyptian newspaper reported today
that Iraq executed 120 of its military officers who refused to
fight against Kuwait.
   The government-owned Al-Ahram said in a Baghdad-dated front-page
report that the executions occurred Friday, a day after Iraq
invaded Kuwait in a dispute over land and oil.
   The report did not cite any source, raising the possibility that
it was an Egyptian intelligence leak.
   It said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein approved the death
sentences handed down by a military court.
   ``The officers had refused to obey orders issued to them to
participate in the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait because this
represented an unjustified aggression on a sister Arab state,'' the
paper said.
   The paper did not give the names or ranks of the executed
officers.
   It did not say how the officers were put to death, but
executions for military crimes in the Arab world normally are
carried out by firing squad.

<HEAD>House Passes Major Oil Spill Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House passed and sent to President Bush
early today a bill triggered by the wreck of the Exxon Valdez that
would strengthen federal oil spill liability laws.
   The House approved 360-0 the compromise worked out by a
House-Senate conference committee as one of its last actions before
recessing for the summer. It passed despite strong objections by
some lawmakers to a one-year moratorium on drilling off the North
Carolina coast.
   The Senate voted 99-0 Thursday to approve the legislation, more
than 16 months after the Exxon Valdez tanker ran aground in Prince
William Sound, dumping 11 million gallons of crude oil into the
pristine Alaska waterway.
   ``The oil spill bill says safe transportation of oil is going to
be part of the cost of doing business,'' said Rep. George Miller,
D-Calif., the chairman of the House Interior subcommittee on
offshore energy resources.
   He called the bill ``the first environmental salvo of the
decade.''
   ``It's not as strong as many of us would like to see it, but
it's landmark legislation,'' said Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass.,
chairman of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries subcommittee on
the environment.
   Stephen Hart, deputy press secretary at the White House, said
Bush has some reservations about the bill, but no veto
recommendations.
   ``We have reservations because the protocols are not in the
bill, and that the conference added the moratorium on North
Carolina,'' said Hart.
   The protocols are a reference to an international treaty, not
yet ratified by the United States, that would lessen liability. The
bill puts a one-year moratorium on drilling off the coast of North
Carolina until a study of possible effects can be completed.
   Miller and other lawmakers pushing for tougher liability laws
said they hoped to pin more responsibility for spills on oil
companies, instead of just the shippers.
   Miller was satisfied, however, that companies using
irresponsible shippers would eventually have to pay, said a Miller
aide.
   The bill also allows states to enact tougher laws.
   Lawmakers who have been trying for years to get a federal
liability bill through Congress consider the legislation a major
breakthrough that seemed to need a tragedy as devastating as the
March 24, 1989, oil spill to become reality.
   ``Many of us are glad not to have to work on it again in another
Congress,'' said Studds, whose efforts to strengthen oil spill laws
go back to 1975.
   The Exxon Valdez spill, the worst in U.S. history, prompted
demands for tougher federal requirements. Following the spill, the
House and Senate each passed differing bills that took lengthy
conference negotiations to reconcile.
   Major provisions in the legislation going to Bush include:
   _Liability by shippers for up to $1,200 per gross ton of the
tanker, instead of the current ceiling of $150 per gross ton.
   _Creation of a $1 billion oil spill response and cleanup fund,
with the money coming from a 5-cent-a-barrel fee on domestic and
imported oil.
   _A requirement that all new tankers have double hulls and that
most of the existing tankers be retrofitted with double hulls or
taken out of service over the next 20 years. A small number of
tankers will be given until 2015 to have double hulls.
   _Formation of regional response teams within the Coast Guard to
deal with oil spills and a national response center where computers
will hold lists of personnel and equipment that can be called upon
after a major spill.
   _Increased research on oil pollution control.
   _A requirement that the government check driving records for
alcohol-related offenses before issuing licenses to operate an oil
tanker.

<BYLINE>Will Late-July Sales Pace Continue?
^By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unexpectedly strong late-July sales pace,
especially for General Motors Corp. cars and trucks, may not be a
true indication of the U.S. vehicle market, an economist says.
   The 10 major U.S. auto makers said Friday that sales of their
cars and trucks rose 9.5 percent during the July 21-31 period this
year compared with the same period last year. GM's sales rose a
strong 15.8 percent over last year.
   ``This was a pleasant surprise, but I doubt it will last,'' said
Tom Webb, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers
Association in McLean, Va. ``GM's sales increase is against a very
weak year-ago period.
   The companies said their vehicles sold at an average daily rate
of 43,978 compared with a rate of 40,147 over the same period in
July 1989.
   Car sales rose 8.4 percent and truck sales increased 11.4
percent.
   GM was the only one of the Big Three automakers whose sales rose
in late July. Ford Motor Co.'s sales fell 4.1 percent and Chrysler
Corp.'s dropped 7.4 percent.
   ``Sales at Ford and Chrysler are more indicative of the market's
direction,'' Webb said.
   Combined Big Three car sales rose a slim 0.6 percent while sales
of Japanese-nameplate cars built in the United States rose 59.1
percent.
   For the entire month of July, with imported cars and trucks
figured in, sales were running 6.2 percent below last year's rate,
with car sales down 8.3 percent and trucks off 1.8 percent.
   Late last July, automakers were preparing to boost incentives to
help dealers clear out inventories of new vehicles to get ready for
the new model year cars and trucks.
   Despite the increase in late-July figures, car and truck sales
this year continue to lag behind last year's pace.
   Through the first seven months of the year, domestic and
overseas manufacturers reported a selling rate 4.1 percent behind
last year. Car sales were down 4.6 percent and truck sales were off
3.1 percent.
   GM's combined sales of North American-built cars and trucks rose
15.8 percent during the period with strong showings in both
categories. Car sales increased 14.8 percent and truck sales rose
17.7 percent.
   For the first seven months of the year, GM's cars and trucks
sold at a pace 2.7 percent slower than last year.
   Ford said its late-July car and truck sales were down 4.1
percent. An 11.7-percent rise in truck sales, fueled by the new
Explorer four-door sport-utility vehicle, was diluted by a
14.4-percent decline in car sales.
   Through the first seven months of this year, Ford's vehicle
sales were 7.8 percent behind last year's pace.
   At Chrysler, an 11.5-percent drop in car sales combined with a
3.7-percent decline in truck sales for a 7.4-percent decrease
overall.
   Through July this year, Chrysler's car and truck sales were 13.1
percent behind last year's pace.

<HEAD>Superpowers Join to Stop Iraqi Invasion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the superpowers' first joint sanctions against
a war, the United States and Soviet Union have urged a world
embargo of weapons sales to Iraq and demanded that the Baghdad
government pull its troops out of Kuwait.
   ``We have been assured that very soon the Iraqis will pull out
their troops,'' Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told a
Friday news conference with U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker
III at his side. He said the Soviets received the assurances
through contacts in Baghdad.
   Later Friday an Iraqi government spokesman said Iraqi troops
will begin withdrawing from Kuwait on Sunday, Baghdad Radio
announced. Iraq claimed the decision was not because of
international pressure.
   It was a historic case of the superpowers acting together to try
to end hostilities.
   They worked together in seeking peace for Lebanon, but Friday's
action is the first time they have tried together to strangle a war
by cutting off trade with an attacker. They also cooperated during
World War II, but before attaining superpower status.
   Both countries separately condemned the Iraqi invasion. But
Baker noted superpower cooperation had made a joint stand
``natural.''
   ``In earlier days, we might have been viewing this very tragic
action through an East-West prism,'' Baker said.
   Shevardnadze spoke slowly and softly to reporters as he reviewed
his country's decision to cut off arms shipments to its ally after
the invasion began Thursday.
   The Kremlin and Baghdad have had a friendship treaty since 1972,
and the Soviet Union is Iraq's major arms supplier.
   ``It wasn't easy to adopt such documents and make a joint
statement because of our well-known good relations with Iraq which
have been evolving for decades,'' Shevardnadze said.
   France said it already had suspended arms shipments to Iraq,
citing payment problems with that Middle East nation. Italy and
Poland have also cut arms deliveries to Iraq, and West Germany is
discussing such a move.
   Neither Baker nor Shevardnadze said specifically what their
nations might do if Iraq continues what their statement called
``brutal and illegal invasion'' and ``blatant transgression of the
basic norms of civilized conduct.''
   They spoke of continued concerted action in the U.N. Security
Council.
   Shevardnadze said neither side was considering military
intervention. But Baker, when asked about further actions against
Iraq, said, ``I don't think that prudently you should rule out
anything.''
   China is also a major arms supplier to Iraq. Shevardnadze said
the Soviets planned to urge the Chinese to stop supplies. Later, a
senior State Department official speaking on Baker's flight from
Moscow said the United States would do the same.
   Baker cut short a visit to neighboring Mongolia to fly to Moscow
to meet with Shevardadze for the second time in a week and to make
the joint statement. Baker then flew to Washington, winding up a
four-nation Asian tour.
   Shevardnadze acknowledged that Baker earlier in the week had
asked the Soviets to act to stave off the possibility of an
invasion.
   ``I really did not think at that time that the Iraqis would so
openly engage in aggression against such a defenseless country, a
country that is a threat to no one,'' Shevardnadze said.
   He said the Soviet leadership sent a ``special'' message to
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq on Thursday, but did not reveal
the contents.
   Shevardnadze, referring to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
foreign policy, said the invasion ``contradicts the principles of
new political thinking and the principles of civilized relations
between nations.''
   He warned Iraq about the safety of the 900 Soviets in Kuwait and
the 7,000 to 8,000 in Iraq.
   ``We expect the security of Soviet citizens there to be
safeguarded, otherwise there might be very, very severe
consequences,'' he told reporters.
   Baker said similar consequences would result if any of the 3,000
Americans in Kuwait or an undetermined number of Americans in Iraq
are endangered.
   Speaking on Baker's Air Force plane, the State Department
official said the United States had privately warned Iraq before
the invasion not to attack Kuwait.
   ``There was a general warning ... at several different levels,
including very high levels,'' the official said on condition of
anonymity.

<HEAD>Judge Backs Voting-District Remapping to Redress LA County
Discrimination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL FLEEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plan to remedy discrimination against
Hispanics won the backing of a federal judge who has ordered local
lawmakers to redraw the political map in the nation's most populous
county.
   U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon, ruling in a historic voting
rights lawsuit Friday, supported a redistricting plan that creates
a Hispanic majority district for the Board of Supervisors, the
county's top elected officials.
   ``For the first time, the Hispanic community is going to be a
meaningful part of the electorate in Los Angeles County,'' said
attorney Mark Rosenbaum, who represented the American Civil
Liberties Union in the suit. ``This means we can take down the
`Hispanic Need Not Apply' sign.''
   Kenyon ruled June 4 that the Board of Supervisors discriminated
against Hispanics when redrawing district boundaries after the 1980
Census. Kenyon found the supervisors violated the federal Voting
Rights Act and ordered the board to submit a new plan that would
help a Hispanic win a seat.
   An estimated 35 percent of the county's 8.7 million residents
are Hispanic, but the board has not had an elected Hispanic member
in 115 years.
   Jose Roberto Juarez, an attorney for the Mexican American Legal
Defense and Educational Fund, said Kenyon's decision sends a strong
signal nationally to governments that will be redrawing voting
boundaries on the basis of the 1990 Census results.
   ``The most important outcome of this lawsuit is the recognition
that we are prepared to do battle for voting rights regardless of
the size of the opponent,'' he said.
   Under the new plan, a supervisorial district held by a retiring
conservative supervisor would be redrawn to give it a Hispanic
majority. The other four districts would undergo minor adjustments
that generally preserve voter bases of two liberal and two
conservative supervisors.
   Kenyon's ruling came in the form of a request to the plaintiffs
to draw a plan to his liking. The plaintiffs' plans already
submitted generally conform to what the judge has asked for.
   Kenyon still must issue a formal order to implement the new plan.
   The ruling could change a decade-long 3-2 conservative majority
with possible sweeping effects on such matters as health and social
services funding.
   The decision also voids a June primary election and sets a
special election for Nov. 6 for the new Hispanic majority district.
That district had been held by conservative Supervisor Pete
Schabarum, who is retiring.
   ``The board obviously disagrees with Judge Kenyon's ruling and
our attorneys will file an appeal by Monday morning, seeking to
stay his demand for a special primary election in the new 1st
District,'' conservative Supervisor Deane Dana said in a statement.
   ``We expect the appeals court to rule on our request for a stay
by Tuesday.''
   With new district lines, Dana and fellow Supervisor Mike
Antonovich face losing their conservative lock on the board.
   MALDEF, the ACLU and the U.S. Justice Department argued
successfully that supervisors drew boundaries to protect their
incumbencies.
   The county supervisors denied purposefully discriminating
against Hispanics and said they did the best the could with the
available census data.
   The board majority approved a redistricting proposal that this
week was rejected by Kenyon as ``nonsensical'' and ``insensitive''
to Hispanic and black residents.

   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait already is costing
U.S. motorists more at the gas pump. Some elected officials,
service-station owners and motorists are accusing oil companies of
price gouging.
   A survey of 1,400 retail gasoline stations nationwide showed
self-serve unleaded gasoline prices increased 4 cents in two days,
to an average of $1.11 a gallon, the American Automobile
Association said Friday.
   Spot checks by AAA clubs in Florida, Michigan, Missouri, North
Carolina, South Carolina and the Washington, D.C., area Friday
showed retail prices shot up 4 to 14 cents a gallon, the
association said.
   In Wisconsin, ``prices are just jumping up like crazy,''
sometimes increasing every 12 hours, said Robert Park, director of
trade practices in the Department of Agriculture, Trade and
Consumer Protection. Increases as high as 10 cents a gallon were
reported and further hikes were expected today, he said. Major oil
companies increased wholesale prices, blaming surging energy
markets. Prices for crude oil, gasoline and home heating oil
futures rose for a second day Friday because of uncertainty about
future Mideast supplies.
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., urged a federal investigation of
the U.S. oil industry.
   ``There is absolutely no reason consumers should already be
paying more for oil and gas,'' he said. ``It's either panic or
profiteering. Either way it must be stopped.''
   Dan Loepp, executive director of the Service Station Dealers
Association of Michigan, agreed. ``The public has a right to know
why these prices are rising so rapidly when the oil at the
terminals was purchased weeks ago,'' he said.
   Motorists' reactions were varied.
   ``I really don't care, not when it comes to my car,'' said Casey
Brittain, 28, of Shreveport, La. ``You've got to have it.''
   ``Five cents isn't so bad,'' said Steven Binson, a teacher from
Miami Beach, Fla. ``But 50 cents would be a cause for war.''
   ``It's absolutely illegitimate,'' said Art Warsaw of East
Peoria, Ill., who was filling up at a diesel pump. ``That stuff
(higher-priced OPEC oil) hasn't hit the pipeline yet.''
   Texaco raised prices as much as 7 cents a gallon; Chevron Corp.
hiked its price 5 cents; BP America Inc. had a 4-cent to 5-cent
increase; and Mobil Oil Corp. raised its prices an average of 3.5
cents a gallon. Other firms also had increases.
   Ed O'Brien, owner of two gasoline stations in Superior, Wis.,
said his price for unleaded gasoline rose from $1.14 a gallon to
$1.23 per gallon Friday, and said an increase of another 6 cents
per gallon was likely today.
   ``This is a big jump, probably the biggest I've seen,'' O'Brien
said.
   Gas station operators said they were forced to pass higher costs
on to consumers.
   ``We can't eat these kinds of increases. We'd be in terrible
shape,'' said W. Terry Dennis, general manager at Woodfin Oil Co.,
which operates 20 service stations in Virginia.
   Oil is Iraq's most important revenue source, and Iraqi President
Saddam nearly doubled his country's reserves by invading Kuwait
early Thursday and taking control of that country's oil. Today,
there was concern that Iraq might invade Saudi Arabia, which has
the world's largest oil reserves and provides 15 percent of U.S.
oil imports.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the September contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, climbed
$1.38 to $24.49 a 42-gallon barrel Friday after rising $1.57 on
Thursday.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for September delivery soared 4
cents to 72 cents a gallon, compounding a nearly 4-cent rise
Thursday.
   The September contract for home heating oil picked up nearly 2
cents to close at 66 cents a gallon after a 3{-cent gain Thursday.
Natural gas for September delivery rose to $1.51 per 1,000 cubic
feet from Thursday's $1.43.
   Prices for other fuels also were up.
   In Reno, Nev., wholesale diesel prices have increased more than
10 cents a gallon since July 28, from 57 cents to nearly 68 cents
Friday.
   Heating oil prices also rose. Tom Warren, owner of Warren Oil
and Heating Co. in Chicago, said prices rose 18 cents a gallon
since Wednesday.

   The earthquake struck at 1:15 p.m. (5:15 a.m.) Friday and was
centered in the village of Akkol, 12 miles east of Lake Zaisan,
Tass said.
   It registered six to seven on the Soviet 12-point scale. Tass

<TEXT>
   Increased ultraviolet light streaming
through the earth's depleted atmospheric ozone layer may be causing
the mysterious deaths of toads, frogs and other amphibians reported
in widely scattered areas of the world, an Oregon State University
zoologist said.
   Cautioning that evidence remains circumstantial, Andrew
Blaustein said Friday that ultraviolet radiation could explain the
recent mass die-offs in two Cascade Range lakes in Oregon, and
other declines in amphibian populations in the western United
States, Costa Rica and Australia.
   He said tadpoles taken from the stricken Oregon lakes before the
die-offs and reared away from direct sunlight in his laboratory
developed normally, prompting the theory that UV light was to blame.
   ``If this is the problem, humans will be directly affected,''
Blaustein said in a telephone interview. ``They will also be
greatly indirectly affected if it is starting to kill animal life.
Amphibians are not the only ones to go.''
   Blaustein, a professor of biology at the university in
Corvallis, said the theory would be one of the main topics Tuesday
at a meeting in New Orleans of scientists studying the recent
declines in amphibian populations around the world.
   ``I am getting somewhat alarmed,'' Blaustein said, adding that
many possible causes for the mass deaths had been ruled out. ``I
would say people studying amphibians are somewhat alarmed by the
possibility it could be increased UV.''
   Scientists have blamed releases of chlorofluorocarbon gases,
used as a coolant in refrigerators and air conditioners and as a
propellant in aerosol cans, for widespread thinning of the ozone
layer, which screens ultraviolet light from the sun.
   In the spring, Blaustein and other scientists discovered all the
Western toad eggs had died in Lost Lake near Santiam Pass in the
Cascade Range and all the frog tadpoles had disappeared from an
unnamed lake nearby.
   Blaustein said research done at Oregon State University in 1975
by Robert Worrest showed toad eggs and tadpoles were very
susceptible to increases in mid-range ultraviolet radiation.
   Jack Hardy, associate professor of environmental studies at
Western Washington University in Bellingham, has found increased
ultraviolet light reduced ocean plankton's ability to perform
photosynthesis, the vital oxygen producing-process of plants.
   So-called middle range ultraviolet light, between 290 nanometers
and 420 nanometers, reduces photosynthesis, causes genetic damage
and skin cancer and could affect the growth of food crops and
forests, Hardy said.
   ``I would not be surprised if it affects frog egg hatches,''
Hardy said.
   Research in Antarctica indicates that ultraviolet light is
strongest in the springtime, when amphibians would be in their
larval stage and most susceptible to damage from sunlight, he added.
   In the Northwest, scientists have noted the western spotted frog
is no longer found in western Oregon and western Washington and
breeding populations of the red-legged frog have disappeared from
Oregon's Willamette Valley, Blaustein said.
   Up to 40 species of amphibians in Costa Rica are now endangered,
and the golden toad has disappeared from a national park there.
   The red-legged frog, once the most common frog in California,
has disappeared from the Central Valley and is declining elsewhere.
   The gastric-brooding frog can no longer be found in Australia.

   Manhattan's borough president wielded obscure
veto powers to halt development on the site where Malcolm X was
assassinated, a Harlem ballroom she fought to preserve as a
historical landmark.
   Ruth Messinger led the battle to save the Audubon Ballroom, but
said her veto Friday of an $8.1 million allocation for the proposed
$34 million medical research laboratory project was purely a
business decision.
   The project already was $9 million over budget, Messinger said
in a letter to the Port Authority, which was to have provided the
$8.1 million she challenged with the little used-veto power
afforded her office by state law.
   The deal to build the biomedical research lab also was too
speculative and only promised 300 new jobs initially, she said. The
city, state and Columbia University planned to share construction
costs.
   Messinger left the door open for a compromise to save the lab
project and preserve the ballroom where the famed black Muslim
leader was shot in 1965.
   ``Nothing bars a new submission from the mayor's office,'' she
wrote in the letter.
   Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch said the veto effectively halted the
project.
   Messinger is a longtime ally of Mayor David Dinkins but crossed
swords with him over the Audubon Ballroom. The mayor recently
agreed to a compromise plan that would have preserved 40 percent of
the ballroom, which has a distinctive terra cotta facade.

by the Municipal Art Society to keep the ballroom intact and build
the lab on a different corner of the block. City officials say that
plan would push the project back into the approval process.

<TEXT>
   Dallas Police Chief Mack Vines and his deputy have
been relieved from duty while prosecutors examine allegations of
witness tampering and perjury during an investigation into a police
officer's firing.
   City Manager Jan Hart said Friday that Vines and Assistant Chief
Greg Holliday were placed on indefinite leave.
   The Dallas County district attorney's office was looking into
the allegations, she said.
   Vines has been police chief since Billy Prince retired in April
1988 amid a controversy over police-minority relations.
   Ms. Hart said a panel reviewing the case of former Officer
Patrick LeMaire, fired after fatally shooting an unarmed Mexican,
found ``potential witness tampering and perjury'' by Vines and
Holliday.
   The panel's findings were reportedly related to an alleged
conversation Vines had with Holliday before Holliday testified in
front of the panel this week. The panel apparently believes that
Vines tried to get Holliday to change his testimony.
   ``This is a very serious matter,'' Ms. Hart said. ``It involves
the integrity of the department and public confidence in the
department.''
   Assistant Chief Willard Rollins will run the department in their
absence, she said.
   The Dallas Police Association, which represents 2,000 of the
department's 2,400 members, called for Vines' immediate resignation.
   A report by the panel made public Friday said it believed
``there was a deliberate attempt by one or more individuals to
subvert'' its findings.
   ``This conduct we believe was blatantly unethical and resulted
in possible perjury testimony,'' the report said.
   The actions of Vines, Holliday and other top police officials
have been under scrutiny since LeMaire was fired a year ago.
LeMaire shot the Mexican while searching for car theft suspects and
was fired for failing to find alternatives to using deadly force.
   When questioned about the conversation, Vines allegedly told the
panel that it had been misinterpreted. Vines has denied any
wrongdoing, saying he reserves the right to request more
information, redirect investigators or set aside procedures in any
inquiry.

<HEAD>Replicas Begin Spanish Tour Before Retracing Columbus' Route</HEAD>

   Replicas of the ships that accompanied
Christopher Columbus on his Atlantic crossing have set sail, but
this time in search of tourist dollars instead of precious metals
and spices.
   The Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria on Friday began their six-month
voyage to a dozen Spanish ports to prepare for a 1992 re-enactment
of Columbus' trip to the New World.
   The ships have a total of 90 crew members and all but the
commander, a Spanish navy captain, will sleep outdoors, as
Columbus' crew did on the voyage to America.
   Like Columbus, Capt. Santiago Bolivar will lead from the deck of
the Santa Maria, the flagship.
   ``The objective of the 1992 voyage will be to study in action
the navigation methods of the 15th century and the effectiveness of
Columbus' sailing methods,'' Bolivar, 40, told reporters.
   The 15th century Spanish royalty bankrolled Columbus.
   Today's government spent $2 million to build the three replica
ships from Galician pine and oak from the Pyrenees. They sailed
from this southern port _ 310 miles southwest of Madrid _ 498 years
to the day of Columbus' first voyage to the New World.
   The head of the government company planning the 1992
celebrations, Luis Yanez, saw them off and laid a wreath at a
monument to Columbus.
   Yanez said the ships were built to help promote the Expo '92
World's Fair in the southern city of Seville. Expo '92 is expected
to attract 20 million visitors to Seville from April to October
1992.
   ``An Expo such as this one is a unique occasion to launch a
country's image around the world,'' the exposition's commissioner,
Manuel Olivencia, has said.
   At least 105 countries and 20 international organizations have
signed commitments to build pavilions in Seville to display their
newest technologies and designs.
   The ships aren't the only promotion for Expo '92. A promotional
quiz game that cost $707,000 to develop is to begin running soon in
Spanish newspapers to familiarize Spaniards with the discoveries of
the past 500 years.
   The government is also pumping an estimated $1 billion into Expo
'92 to modernize Seville's public works communications systems and
$6 billion into the rest of the southern region of Andalusia.
   The ships are a particular point of pride. Last year, Queen
Sofia christened the single-decked 117-foot-long Santa Maria. Her
daughter, Princess Elena, christened the Nina and Princess Cristina
the Pinta.
   The two smaller caravelles are 50 feet long.
   While the sailors will attempt to follow the exact sailing
methods of Columbus, the ships are equipped with sophisticated
equipment to navigate via satellite and carry modern-day lighting.
   For protection, a navy frigate will escort them.

<HEAD>Kohl Needs Opposition for New Election Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUD S. BEELMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl says a proposal
for early elections and unification is the will of the German
people, but he may need the will of the opposition for his wish to
become reality.
   In a statement from his vacation retreat in Austria, Kohl
welcomed East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere's call
Friday for all-German elections on Oct. 14, six weeks earlier than
planned.
   ``The proposal corresponds with the wishes of the people in East
Germany and also in West Germany,'' Kohl said.
   De Maiziere said Friday that unification would be formally
declared the day before the election. He said said the Volkskammer,
East Germany's parliament, could meet in a special session the day
before the vote and make that decision. Kohl supports that idea.
   But the opposition Social Democrats were quick to criticize the
deal Kohl and de Maiziere reportedly reached in a late night talk
at Kohl's vacation house earlier this week.
   The Social Democrats' candidate for chancellor, Oskar
Lafontaine, called the proposal ``transparent manipulation'' and
said, ``this date-shifting carries panicky consequences.'' The
environmentalist Greens called it ``a bad day for Germany.''
   The Germanys are working on finalizing a unification treaty that
lays out the legal unification of the two states. They merged their
economies on July 1. It has been East Germany's crumbling economy,
lurching from communism to capitalism, that has spurred the push
for early unification.
   ``I think this is the right way,'' Kohl's chief of staff Rudolf
Seiters was quoted as saying in today's mass-circulation Bild
newspaper. ``Only a strong unified German government is in the best
position to master the problems in East Germany.''
   Kohl, in his statement, said the proposal ``corresponds to the
evaluation of people in both parts of Germany, that a quicker
unification process reduces difficulties and financial
expenditures.''
   On Thursday, representatives of the Germanys agreed on an
election treaty setting the conditions for the balloting. Parties
in both countries had previously agreed on Dec. 2 as the election
date.
   Under West Germany's constitution, the country must elect a new
Bundestag, the law-making lower house of parliament, between Nov.
18 and Jan. 18.
   For an earlier election, West German lawmakers could try to
dissolve the Bundestag through a majority vote of no-confidence for
the chancellor, using an article of the constitution as an
emergency exit and not for its intended purpose. Kohl's governing
coalition has a simple majority.
   Lawmakers could also, by a two-thirds vote in the Bundestag,
vote to change the constitution to allow earlier elections.
   Kohl's governing coalition of Christian Democratic Union,
Christian Social Union and Free Democrats has a combined 282 seats
in the Bundestag. But it would need 346 for a two-thirds majority
of the 519-member chamber. The Social Democrats have 193 members in
the Bundestag.
   De Maiziere told a news conference in East Berlin that the
all-German vote should coincide with East German elections that
will create five state governments to mirror West Germany's federal
system. Under Bonn's constitution, those states could immediately
seek unity with West Germany.
   The Bundestag meets next week to vote on ratification of the
election treaty. Kohl said that special session would also discuss
the latest proposal for German unification.

<TEXT>
   Merchant sailors who bobbed in 30-foot
seas after Hurricane Bertha splintered their cargo ship stepped
ashore with praise for their Soviet rescuers and acceptance of the
ocean's fury.
   Rolando Arellano, an apprentice officer from Manila,
Philippines, said Friday he would resume his oceangoing life and
vowed not to give in to fear. ``No _ this is life at sea,''
Arellano said.
   Twenty-one survivors of the wrecked freighter Corazon were
brought ashore by a Soviet fishing support ship that plucked them
from churning seas in the Atlantic about 400 miles east of New York.
   Six crew members, including most of the ship's officers, died in
the wreck Tuesday.
   ``What made the whole operation complicated was the wind and the
height of the waves, as well as the rainstorms, very little
visibility,'' said Capt. Vladimir Pushnoy, skipper of the Soviet
ship M-V Leonid Leonidov, speaking through an interpreter at a news
conference.
   One man spent about 10 hours in the water before he was hauled
to safety, Pushnoy said.
   The survivors were mostly Greek or Filipino sailors aboard the
593-foot freighter hauling tons of cement from Greece to New York.
   ``We are very lucky,'' said ship's cook Pantelis Potiris, of
Athens, Greece. ``It was very bad, very rough.''
   Arellano said he spent about five hours floating in the water
after his life raft capsized.
   ``I hope only to stay alive,'' Arellano said. ``I always pray to
God. We are thinking of our family and to save ourselves.''
   Many survivors had only life jackets for flotation, and the
yellow vests were hard to see amid the foam and spray of the rough
water, Pushnoy said.
   After the Corazon sent a distress signal Tuesday afternoon, the
U.S. and Canadian coast guards provided information to help the
Leonid Leonidov and several other ships find the survivors.
   Two other ships in the area got close to Corazon crew members
but couldn't get them aboard.
   Pushnoy said his ship was able to pull off the rescue because
his 46-member crew is used to working on the open sea and tying up
with other vessels under adverse conditions.
   Survivors from the Corazon hugged their rescuers after the rusty
Soviet ship pulled into port.
   ``The Russians are good,'' said one survivor, giving a thumbs-up
sign.

<HEAD>Shiite Sources Doubt That Kuwait Terrorists Freed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait puts Saddam
Hussein in control of 15 jailed pro-Iranian terrorists whose
freedom is demanded by factions holding Western hostages in Lebanon.
   Shiite Moslem sources, familiar with the case of the 16 Western
captives, say Saddam's control of the 15 terrorists held in Kuwaiti
jails gives the Iraqi leader a role in the hostage issue.
   Seventeen terrorists were convicted by the Kuwaiti authorities
in connection with the 1983 bombings of the U.S. and French
embassies and other targets in the tiny oil-rich desert state.
   Two of them were released after completing their prison term.
That left 15, two of whom have been sentenced to death but the
sentence was never carried out.
   Freedom for the terrorists, some of whom belong to the Iraqi
Al-Dawa Shiite fundamentalist group that has been working for
Saddam's overthrow, has been a key demand by captors of American
hostages.
   Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, which has demanded the
release of the convicts in Kuwait, holds two Americans _ journalist
Terry Anderson and educator Thomas Sutherland.
   Anderson, 42, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest-held foreign captive in Lebanon. He was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Kuwait refused to release the convicted terrorists and the
United States has refused to pressure Kuwait into succumbing to the
kidnappers' demands.
   One Shiite source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Saddam's control of the 15 prisoners ``gives him a window open on
the hostage issue.''
   The American ABC television network reported Friday the 15 were
``all free'' after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   ``Does this affect the fate of the American hostages? We don't
even know who freed the Kuwait prisoners,'' the ABC announcer said.
   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, which is believed
to be the umbrella for the hostage-holding factions, withheld
comment on the ABC report.
   ``No comment is our answer,'' said the head of Hezbollah's
information department, known only as Abu Hawraa. He refused to
elaborate.
   The Shiite source, commenting on the release report, said: ``I
think it's far-fetched. The Kuwaitis were not in a position to free
them before their country fell to the Iraqis.''
   ``I would swallow it if I heard that they were moved to baghdad.
Saddam is not likely to release them free of charge, that is if he
releases them at all,'' the source said.
   ``I believe that if he controlled them, Saddam would use the
prisoners to curb the West's moves against him for invading
Kuwait,'' the source added.
   One scenario, speculated upon by the Shiite source, would be for
Saddam to ``offer to swap the 15 for the Western captives in
Lebanon.''
   ``Such a move by Saddam would embarrass the West, but would
Syria permit such a swap? I doubt it,'' he said,
   Syria, Iraq's main Arab foe, has 40,000 troops deployed in
predominantly Moslem regions of Lebanon and all previous hostage
releases have been carried out with Syria's help or approval.
   The foreign captives currently missing in Lebanon, in addition
to Anderson and Sutherland, are four Americans, four Britons, two
Swiss, two West Germans, an Italian and an Irishman.

   A hoax bomb threat prompted the hurried
evacuation of a Delta Airlines jet and 15 passengers sliding down
emergency chutes suffered minor scrapes, bumps and sprains, an
airline official said.
   Delta Flight 748 landed safely Friday afternoon at its scheduled
stop, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, about 10 minutes
after a telephoned bomb threat was received at the Delta
reservations desk at Los Angeles International Airport, said
airline spokesman Joe Licitra.
   There were 230 passengers and 11 crew members aboard the flight
that originated in Los Angeles. Those hurt were treated and
released for minor injuries at local hospitals, Licitra said.
   Bomb-sniffing dogs found no explosives on the Boeing 767,
Licitra said, adding that the plane returned to service later that
evening.

   Early morning rain and thunderstorms hit parts of Missouri,
Florida and Oklahoma today, while light showers fell in Indiana.
Elsewhere in the nation, weather was mostly dry.
   Many areas had temperatures in the 70s before dawn, with Las
Vegas registering 86 degrees and Phoenix 84 degrees as mid-summer
heat was expected to rise nationwide throughout the day.
   Thunderstorms roamed across central Oklahoma and at St. Louis.
There was a light rain in Indianapolis and thunderstorms were over
the tip of Florida at Key West.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms to fall in
southern Illinois and western Ohio as a cold front pushes across
the Great Lakes region into the Ohio Valley.
   Across the southern end of the front, rain and thunderstorms are
expected to develop in the Texas panhandle, southern Oklahoma and
northern Arkansas.
   Scattered thunderstorms are likely in the afternoon and evening
along the eastern Rockies, but the remainder of the West was to
have dry weather with temperatures soaring into the 100s in
California and Oregon.
   The Eastern seaboard, Southeast and southern Plains were
expected to bask in dry and sunny weather, and temperatures were to
be above normal in the Northeast.
   A few thunderstorms were considered likely to form over the
Applachians.

   About 1,300 North Sea oil workers
protesting allegedly lax safety procedures have staged a sit-in at
their offshore platforms, officials said.
   The sit-in began Friday and affects eight oil platforms and
three floating accommodation units. It follows a 24-hour wildcat
strike Thursday by 4,000 North Sea oil workers at 40 offshore
installations.
   Ronni McDonald, a spokesman for the Offshore Industry Liaison
Committee, the unofficial council representing the main oil
industry unions, said the sit-in affected Shell U.K. and British
Petroleum installations.
   The unions claim workers should be involved in safety management
to reduce the risk of accidents on the rigs.
   A helicopter crash that killed six workers last week again
raised concerns about safety in the North Sea oil fields. At least
four aircraft accidents have occurred in the past four years, and
167 men were killed in the Piper Alpha platform fire in July 1988.

   A frantic public appeal by the parents of an
American kidnapped by Colombian guerrillas for donations to pay his
ransom raised $50,000 more than the family needed.
   Scott Heimdal was released June 29 after $60,000 was paid after
a four hectic days of fund-raising in early June as the family
raced to beat a deadline set by the guerrillas who threatened to
kill Heimdal.
   The family said Friday that late-coming donations pushed the
amount collected to $110,592.
   ``Money was still dribbling in a couple a weeks ago,'' said Roy
Heimdal, the 28-year-old victim's father.
   He said the family will pay expenses incurred during the 61-day
ordeal, but ``Any money sent in now will be returned.''
   Friends and strangers flooded the Heimdals' modest rented
bungalow in this central Illinois town with piles of cash during
the public appeal. The family said it had no money.
   The mail brought stacks of donations, restaurants held
fund-raising dinners, nursing homes had bake sales and factory
workers passed the hat during lunch breaks to generate the ransom.
   Heimdal was abducted April 28 while traveling in a canoe along a
remote jungle river when the guerrillas attacked, killing the
canoe's pilot.
   He was working for the Quito-based International Mining Co.
dredging river bottoms for gold.
   Roy Heimdal said his son is looking for a job and describes life
as ``just about back to normal.''

   If Liberia's civil war had followed
its script, President Samuel Doe would be dead, a prisoner, or in
exile.
   But infighting among rebels and unexpectedly stiff resistance
from Doe's remaining troops have combined to destroy hopes the
7-month-long war will end soon.
   West African nations planned a meeting in Gambia Monday to
consider intervention, said government sources in Nigeria.
   On Friday, government troops and rebels loyal to Prince Johnson
fired rockets and shells at each other in block-by-block fighting
for Monrovia, the ravaged Liberian capital.
   In addition, a rivalry between rebel leaders Johnson and Charles
Taylor is prolonging the war.
   Sources said today that Johnson's rebels recently attacked
Taylor's forces deep behind their lines, cutting a main supply
route. Johnson had pulled some men out of Monrovia for the surprise
attacks, said the sources, who visited the area and spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The attacks were launched in Nimba County, about 300 miles from
the capital. The rebels first began their invasion seven months ago
in Nimba County, which borders the Ivory Coast.
   Diplomats confidently told reporters weeks ago that as soon as
rebels were spotted in Monrovia they expected Doe's troops to flee.
   Like many other observers, they believed Doe's ill-trained and
poorly paid army would continue a pattern of retreat set in the
early months of the campaign. The rebels had encountered little
resistance as they advanced hundreds of miles from Liberia's
northeastern border with the Ivory Coast to Monrovia in the
southwest.
   They finally slowed down as they entered hostile country and
left behind territory populated by sympathizers who fed them, hid
them and informed on government troop movements.
   Guerrilla warfare training learned in Libya and Burkina Faso was
of little use in the seesaw street battles the rebels fought with
Doe's forces in the rundown capital.
   Civilian recruits have bolstered Taylor's forces from the 200
who invaded from Ivory Coast in December to the more than 10,000
troops he's believed to command now. But most, like Doe's soldiers,
have little training. Hundreds are boys barely in their teens.
   For more than a month, reporters traveling with the rebels have
reported they are as ready to drop their arms and run as the
government troops.
   Johnson, a former Doe officer with U.S. military training, has
broken away with several hundred men who appear better-trained and
disciplined than forces under Taylor, a former Doe bureaucrat.
   This was evident two weeks ago when Johnson attacked the capital
from the west and got within hundreds of yards of Doe's fortified
residence.
   Taylor, meanwhile, was bogged down six miles east of the
executive mansion.
   Many of the more than 1,000 troops who remain to guard the
beleaguered Doe are from elite units trained by Israelis and
Americans. These men know that they likely face summary executions
if they are captured.
   But other government forces were hastily recruited like the
rebels. Many criminals freed from prison in February were
conscripted.
   Doe has proved himself a survivor by holding onto an area of
Monrovia a few miles square. The rest of the Ohio-sized country is
mainly rebel-held.
   About 5,000 people, mostly civilians, have died since rebels
invaded from the Ivory Coast. The rebels accuse Doe, who took power
in a 1980 coup, of corruption and human rights abuses.
   The battle has turned in large measure into tribal warfare.
   On Monday, up to 600 civilian refugees were killed in a Lutheran
church compound. Witnesses said the slayings were committed by
government troops. Doe said rebels dressed as government soldiers
were to blame.
   The victims were members of the Gio and Mano tribes, from which
the rebels get most of their support. Soldiers accused of the
massacre were said by witnesses to belong to Doe's Krahn tribe or
the Mandingo tribe.
   West African leaders are scheduled to meet in Banjul, Gambia, on
Monday to decide whether to send a flotilla to end the fighting in
Liberia, government sources in Lagos, the Nigerian capital, said
today. The sources did not elaborate.
   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen said Thursday the
United Nations could decide within a matter of days on an
``initiative'' for Liberia. Cohen would not elaborate.
   He said there was no plan for the United States to intervene
with 2,100 Marines who are on standby in ships off the Liberian
coast to evacuate Americans, if necessary.

estranged wife, Lisa, and two young daughters of any inheritance.
   The will filed Thursday in Contra Costa County Superior Court
named James Whitmer, an old friend of Mydland, to administer the

<HEAD>Soldiers Massacre 19 Members of a Moslem Clan in the South</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TACURONG, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers allegedly massacred 19
members of a Moslem family to avenge the death of two comrades who
were gunned down by a member of the clan, a government official and
witnesses said today.
   Lawyer Ciriaco Jabido, regional director of the government's
Commission on Human Rights, said the incident took place Friday in
the village of New Passi on the outskirts of this town, 610 miles
southeast of Manila.
   The military unit operating in the area had earlier reported the
incident as a clash between government troops and Moslem
separatists. But six of the dead were children.
   Jabido, who went to the scene of the massacre, said the victims
were members of the Mamindiala clan.
   Jabido quoted witnesses as saying soldiers from the army's 38th
Infantry Battalion arrived in the area to arrest Kamlon Mamindiala,
a suspected separatist guerrilla.
   Mamindiala, 30, resisted arrest and managed to get a homemade
12-gauge shotgun from a hiding place and fire on the soldiers,
killing two, Jabido said.
   The rest of the soldiers killed Mamindiala as he attempted to
escape.
   A witness, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
soldiers then ordered Manindiala's relatives, including those from
two nearby houses, to step out from their homes and gunned them
down.
   Jabido's group recovered dozens of empty shells of M-16 and M-14
rifles from the scene.
   Among those killed were Mamindiala's father, Kabagal, 70; his
mother, 68; his 30-year-old pregnant wife, Palumpukan; and his six
children, aged between one to 13 years old.
   The witness said the soldiers then burned the houses before
leaving.
   As a result of the incident, about 100 of the Mamindialas'
neighbors fled to the town center.
   Comments from military officials in the area were unavailable.
   Jabido said a forensic team from Manila will arrive Tuesday to
investigate the incident.

   Saudi Arabia, an oil-rich ally of Kuwait,
has been subdued in its reaction to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   The only direct Saudi statement since the invasion was made by
an anonymous government spokesman through the official Saudi Press
Agency the day after the Iraqi move. It did not condemn Thursday's
invasion.
   It said Saudi Arabia was following the Kuwait situation ``with
extreme concern'' and that King Fahd would be seeking to calm the
situation and to find a solution ``in a manner ensuring the
interests of all.''
   The only tangible help Saudi Arabia gave the Kuwait government
was to shelter members of the ruling family, including the emir,
Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and his crown prince. Both nations
are tightly run by royal families.
   The Saudis also allowed them briefly to operate a radio,
reportedly from a mobile van in the area around the Saudi-Kuwait
border. It broadcast calls for resistance to the Iraqis.
   But on Friday the radio went off the air after a desperate call:
``The people of Kuwait appeal to you oh brethren, oh Arabs, oh
beloved brothers, oh Moslems, rush, rush to their help.''
   It was not known if the radio had been discovered by the Iraqis
or shut down by the Saudis to avoid provoking Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein at a time when fears were being expressed that he
might invade Saudi Arabia as well.
   Oil executives said Saudi Arabia has not and will not take the
most potent action possible against Iraq _ closing the pipeline
that carries Iraqi oil for export across Saudi Arabia to the Red
Sea.
   The executives said the Saudis realize this would give the
belligerent Saddam an excuse to attack and occupy the Saudi oil
fields 150 miles south of Kuwait, giving Iraq control of more oil
than any other country in the world.
   Turkey also has refused to comment about President Bush's
suggestion that Turkey cut off Iraq's oil pipeline to the
Mediterranean. Two parallel pipelines pump Iraqi crude oil to a
terminal at Yumurtalik at the eastern corner of Turkey's
Mediterranean coast and constitute Iraq's major oil export outlet.
   The Saudis did condemn the invasion as part of a joint statement
issued by the Gulf Cooperation Council, in which it is allied for
economic and security cooperation with Kuwait, the United Arab
Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain.
   The six states issued a statement saying, ``We strongly condemn
and are very sorry for this attack that one Arab state took against
another Arab state. ... We do not recognize anything resulting from
it.''
   Iraq's huge armed force is clearly too much for the joint
3,000-man Gulf Cooperation Council force, based at Hafr al-Baten in
northeastern Saudi Arabia 65 miles south of Kuwait. But there was
no talk of specific action against Iraq by Kuwait's partners.
   Saudi Arabia was also one of the 14 members of the 21-member
Arab League that condemned the invasion in the same terms as the
Gulf Cooperation Council.
   The Arab League, with one-third of its members voting against
the resolution or abstaining, was clearly unable to take any direct
action.

   The lower the stock market went, the more
investors turned to gallows humor to help forget about the
financial bath they were taking.
   As the market sank Friday, Angelo Falco made light of Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein's decision to invade Kuwait and a prediction
by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze that Iraqi invaders
would quickly back out.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if guys like Hussein, Shevardnadze
were playing the market this week,'' he said, prompting nervous
laughter among other investors gathered inside Charles Schwab &amp; Co.
Inc. at the World Trade Center.
   It's typical to hear ``a lot of gallows humor'' on a shaky stock
market day like Friday, when the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials closed down 54.95 points after being down more than 120
points earlier in the day, he said.
   ``They're kidding and laughing knowing they're losing thousands
of dollars an hour,'' he said. ``Most people are taking a good
dunking today.''
   Another man, frowning one moment, was smiling the next as he
speculated that Shevardnadze's prediction had caused the market to
rebound 35 points in five minutes. He couldn't believe how quickly
the numbers were changing.
   He pointed at one stock, noting that it stood at $6 a share just
moments after it had been $11 per share.
   ``Eleven, now it's only six. Half price. Half price,
unbelievable!'' he shouted. Some who heard him focused on the
numbers, like gamblers around a casino table.
   Robert A. Burke, editor of the investment trade paper ``Eye On
Wall Street,'' watched as a steady stream of men took their turns
at the market computers during Friday's rollercoaster trading
session.
   ``Everybody in America wants to get rich quick,'' he said.
``These guys are gambling. Once in a while they'll get lucky. Years
ago there used to be millions of these guys but the stock market
crashed and they all got wiped out.''
   Burke attributed the sudden downfall in the market to the
announcement Friday that unemployment had risen to 5.5 percent, its
highest level in two years, as well as the Iraqi invasion and a
revision of the Gross National Product last week.

   Tamil militants rampaged through
two mosques in eastern Sri Lanka with machine guns and hand
grenades, killing more than 110 people as they knelt in prayer,
witnesses and officials said today.
   Town coroner Mohammed Noordeen said he examined the bodies of
112 people from the massacre on Friday evening. Police and other
sources gave casualty figures that reached as high as 131. Military
officials earlier said 150 people had been killed. All the victims
were men.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but
officials blamed the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eeelam
for the massacre.
   The Tigers broke a 13-month cease-fire on June 11 to resume
their war for independence in the Tamil-dominated north and east of
this Indian Ocean island. More than 3,000 combatants have been
killed in the latest fighting.
   Brigadier A.M.U. Seneviratne, army commander of the Batticaloa
district, said 30 Tamil rebels crossed a lagoon near this Moslem
town, 140 miles east of Colombo, divided into two groups and
attacked the mosques during Friday evening prayers.
   The rebels sprayed machine gunfire from three sides into the
Meera Juma mosque, where about 200 worshipers had gathered, and
also lobbed grenades. Amid screams and smoke, they fled before
soldiers could arrive from a camp about two miles away. Another
group attacked the smaller Thaik mosque with had about 30
worshipers inside.
   ``I was kneeling down and praying when the rebels started
shooting,'' said Mohammed Ibrahim, a 40-year-old businessman. ``The
firing went on for 15 minutes. I escaped without being hit and
found myself among bodies all over the place.''
   Another witness, Mohammed Arif, a 17-year-old student said:
``Before I escaped from a side door and scaled a wall, I saw a
Tiger rebel put a gun into the mouth of a small Moslem boy and pull
the trigger.''
   Seneviratne said most of the victims were shot in the back or
side.
   Evidence of the carnage was apparent today when the government
flew reporters to the area. The floor of the mosque was splattered
with blood and the walls pockmarked with bullet holes.
   Bodies were lined up in neat rows, wrapped in the traditional
Moslem white burial clothes. Small cardboard placards gave the name
of the victim and the number of the corpse.
   Groups of sobbing Moslem women flocked to the two mosques.
   Vehicles carrying bodies, with Moslem clergymen chanting verses,
rolled past armed soldiers patrolling the town. Shops, homes and
businesses were closed.
   In a cemetery at the Meera Jumma mosque, mourners had dug a long
common grave for a row of coffins.
   In Colombo, a Moslem member of Parliament and opposition leader
said the government failed to protect Moslems or give them arms to
protect themselves.
   ``This is a brutal massacre of innocent civilians by the Tiger
terrorists who do not hesitate to enter mosques and kill
civilians,'' said Mohammad Ashroff, of the Sri Lanka Moslem
Congress party.
   ``We are compelled to conclude the government is a silent,
sadistic observer of the conspiracy against the Moslems, if not a
passive participant in it,'' he told reporters.
   The Tamil Tigers did not immediately respond.
   This was the second attack blamed on Tiger rebels on a mosque in
the area in one week. In a similar attack Sunday, the militants
killed 10 worshipers in Samanthurai, 25 miles east of Batticaloa.
   On July 24, Tamil rebels killed four Moslems at another mosque
in Batticaloa district.
   Moslems, who make up about 7 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million
people, often have been victims of the 7-year-old war between Tamil
rebels and the Sinhalese-dominated government.
   The rebels want an independent homeland in the northern and
eastern districts for Tamils, who are mostly Hindus. Tamils make up
18 percent of the population and the predominantly Buddhist
Sinhalese account for 75 percent.
   Military officials say the rebels are killing Moslems and
burning their homes and shops because the Tigers suspect them of
supporting the government.
   Moslem leaders, however, say Moslems are being killed because
they are neutral.
   The separatists say the Sinhalese discriminate against Tamils in
jobs, education and the use of the Sinhala language. The Sinhalese
dominate the government, military and police.

   Lawmakers clashed today over a measure to
restructure the Strategic Defense Initiative within the 1991
defense bill, with one Democratic sponsor arguing that the
amendment gives President Bush ``clear guidance'' on the program.
   In a frantic rush to finish the $289 billion defense bill and
adjourn for a summer recess, the Senate tackled the thorny issue of
SDI, commonly known as Star Wars, and the administration's request
of $4.7 billion for the program.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee in approving its bill last
month trimmed about $1 billion from Bush's budget proposal for the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   The most contentious issue was an amendment sponsored by Sens.
Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., and Richard Shelby, D-Ala., to restructure
SDI with the emphasis on ground-based systems rather than the
space-based ``Brilliant Pebbles'' system now in development.
   A key proponent of the program, Republican Sen. Malcolm Wallop
of Wyoming, criticized the restructuring measure, charging that the
measure abandons the balance in the program.
   But Shelby said during the debate that the amendment ``would
give the administration clear guidance on the SDI program.''
   ``We would be rejecting early deployment of systems that would
violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in favor of a continued
research program on treaty-compliant, short-term options and
longer-term, more effective defenses,'' Bingaman said recently.
   Under the provision, the fiscal 1991 budget request for the
Phase 1 program would be cut from $1.9 billion to $1.5 billion. In
addition, the measure would reduce the proposal for Brilliant
Pebbles from $329 million to $129 million.
   The amendment comes on the heels of a congressional report that
found deploying the first phase of SDI in 1993 would be ``premature
and fraught with high risk.''
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, said in the study that the introduction of the Brilliant
Pebbles has drastically changed the SDI system's design, leaving it
in a state of flux.
   In January, the Pentagon incorporated the Brilliant Pebbles
concept into Phase 1. That technology involves several thousand
interceptors that would orbit the Earth to seek and destroy a
target by smashing into it at high speeds.
   On Friday, the Senate rejected an amendment to cut 130,000
troops, including 80,000 in Europe, despite arguments that the Cold
War has ended and the United States faces severe money problems.
The vote was 59-40.
   In proposing a $307 billion defense bill for fiscal 1991, Bush
called for about 40,000 troops to be cut from the
2.1-million-member active-duty force. The bill before the Senate
would cut troop strength by 100,000, including 50,000 in Europe.
   In a speech Thursday, Bush called for a 25 percent reduction in
troop size over five years _ about 500,000 through 1995 _ but
cautioned against drastic reductions in the nation's military
strength overall.
   The Senate also rejected, 55-44, an attempt to mothball three of
the Navy's four battleships, one more than Bush proposed in his
budget.

   Christopher Columbus could have told them
it wouldn't be easy.
   Ninety Spaniards sailing in exact replicas of Columbus' three
ships, the Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria, departed from this
southwestern Atlantic port Friday on a six-month Mediterranean sea
trial.
   But by Saturday, the explorers, who are preparing for a planned
1992 re-creation of Columbus' voyage to the New World, found
themselves back in port after they were blown to land by a
windstorm.
   Undaunted, Spanish navy Capt. Santiago Bolivar, the leader of
the mission, told reporters Saturday: ``We're going to wait out the
winds before starting out again for our first destination.'' That
destination is Almeria, a southwestern Spanish port roughly 310
miles east of Huelva.
   The ships' joyful sendoff Friday coincided with the 498th
anniversary of the day Columbus began his first voyage to what
would become known as America.
   Spain, which bankrolled Columbus, spent $2 million to build the
three ships from Galician pine and oak from the Pyrenees.
   The ships were built to help promote the Expo '92 World's Fair
in the southern city of Seville and to commemorate the 500th
anniversary of Columbus' legendary voyage.
   Expo '92 is expected to attract 20 million visitors to Seville
from April to October 1992.
   While the sailors will attempt to follow the exact sailing
methods of Columbus and his intrepid men, the ships are equipped
with sophisticated equipment to navigate via satellite and carry
modern-day lighting.

   The resignation of the nation's highest-ranking
black Roman Catholic clergyman because he was intimate with a woman
has renewed calls from critics of mandatory priestly celibacy for a
change in church policy.
   Atlanta Archbishop Eugene Marino resigned last month because of
his two-year relationship with a lay minister, Vicki R. Long,
church officials confirmed this week. They previously said he
resigned for health reasons.
   Ms. Long, 27, has filed a monetary claim against the archdiocese
for an undisclosed amount.
   Neither Marino nor Ms. Long have commented about their
relationship. Bishop James P. Lyke, the acting administrator of the
Atlanta Archdiocese, would not say whether the relationship was
sexual, describing it only as ``intimate.''
   Lyke sought to play down any questioning of the church law on
celibacy, which dates from the Middle Ages. ``I don't think one
mistake provides an occasion to bring about a discussion of
celibacy,'' he said.
   But advocates for optional celibacy within the church say
Marino's prominence will provoke debate and call the celibacy
requirement an eroding symbol of church misogyny.
   Pope John Paul II strongly supports the requirement. During his
1987 visit to the United States, he said that a priest's love for
Christ must be paramount and is ``at the foundation of our
commitment to celibacy. This love also makes it possible for us, as
servants of God's kingdom, to love our people freely and chastely
and deeply.''
   But Richard McBrien, chairman of the theology department at the
University of Notre Dame, does not agree with the church's stand on
celibacy.
   ``Celibacy is unrealistic and it's counterproductive now,'' he
said.
   ``The priesthood as we've known it is falling apart ... because
of a stubborn refusal to change.''
   McBrien said about 15 percent of priests have resigned since
1970 and officials expect seminary applications to decline 40
percent by the year 2000.
   Cathy Grenier of Good Tidings, a Pennsylvania support group for
women and priests, said Catholic mandatory celibacy also is a
feminist issue.
   ``The attitude toward women is that if a priest touches a woman
he's tainted,'' said Mrs. Grenier, who married a former priest.
``If women were not believed inherently evil and dirty, there'd be
no problem with marrying us.''
   Terrence Dosh, who runs a national support group for priests who
later married, said Marino's stature drew attention to a widely
disregarded church problem.
   ``In the past 25 years, 19,000 American Roman Catholic priests
resigned and married and 110,000 in the world resigned and
married,'' he said. ``It takes the situation of a bishop to draw
attention to it.''
   Dosh and McBrien also said Marino's resignation could hurt black
Catholics, who make up only 2 million of the 53 million American
Catholics.
   ``Any leader of a group who falls, they're (Catholic hierarchy)
ashamed about it,'' Dosh said. ``The people in charge in Rome will
be reluctant to put someone like him in his place.''
   McBrien said he feared that ``people are going to say, `Well, he
is black and ... they have different sorts of urges and needs.'
That's racism of the worst kind but it will be an effort on the
part of certain figures in the church to gloss it (Marino's
resignation) over.''
   Lyke, who is black, said he hoped any racial backlash would be
minimal.
   ``The church deals with racism internally,'' he said. ``It would
be a terrible expression of racism if we retreated on our
progress.''
   The National Conference of Catholic Bishops last year endorsed a
National Black Catholic Pastoral Plan that calls for integrating
African-American symbols into worship and increasing black
membership on church policy-making groups.
   The number of black Catholics in the United States has grown
from 900,000 to 2 million in the past 20 years, partly helped by
immigration from Haiti and the West Indies.
   Meanwhile, Bishop George A. Stallings of Washington, D.C.,
founder of the breakaway African-American Catholic Congregation, on
Friday asked Marino to join his congregation.
   ``Roman Catholics intuitively know that Archbishop Marino's dark
night of the soul is not a personal failure but a failure ... on
the part of the Roman Catholic church to deal realistically with
the issue that a call to ordained ministry is not synonymous with
celibacy,'' Stalling said in a statement.
   Stallings, accused last year by a former altar boy of having a
homosexual affair with him, formed his own independent congregation
and declared new church laws contrary to Roman Catholic teachings.
His congregation allows birth control, optional celibacy for clergy
and ordination of women.
   Stallings would like to install Marino as an archbishop of his
new congregation's western diocese in Los Angeles or southern
diocese in New Orleans, said Stallings' spokesman, William Marshall
Jr.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ A Moslem zealot's attempt to
overthrow the government, and the burning and looting that
accompanied it, have staggered Trinidad after three decades of
stable democracy.
   The rebels surrendered Wednesday and the six-day coup attempt
ended with the safe release of the hostages, but the casualty toll
in the assault and subsequent violence was at least 38 dead and 150
wounded.
   Now Trinidadians face food and gasoline shortages, economic
disruption from a week of paralyzing curfews and the devastation
left by looters and arsonists.
   This racially and ethnically diverse nation known for sun and
calypso also must deal with tensions created by the violent effort
to destroy a democracy that has endured since independence from
Britain in 1962.
   ``As a sociologist, I know that conflict and crisis can either
splinter groups or unify them; it's never in-between,'' said
Anthony Maingot, who was born in Trinidad and is a Caribbean expert
at Florida International University in Miami.
   The coup attempt by Abu Bakr, leader of a commune of 250 to 350
Moslems, began July 27.
   Bakr and his followers, most of whom are poor and black,
attacked police headquarters with explosives and seized Prime
Minister N.R. Robinson and other government officials in Parliament
House.
   Other members of Jamaat-al-Muslimeen simultaneously invaded the
state television complex a mile away and took employees hostage.
   Bakr's immediate demands were the prime minister's resignation
and elections within 90 days.
   ``I don't know that they planned beyond taking Red House,'' the
parliament building, said Col. Joe Theodore, who led the Trinidad
and Tobago Defense Force in the crisis. ``He went in with a
half-baked plan.''
   The sports and culture minister, Jennifer Johnson, one of the
hostages, said the rebels were convinced they could improve
Trinidad by establishing a fundamentalist Moslem state. Bakr, whose
newspaper had attacked ``satanic'' U.S. and International Monetary
Fund economic treatment of Trinidad, promised to help the poor.
   There were no signs of popular support for Bakr's attempt to
overthrow th prime minister.
   Robinson trails in public opinion polls and elections are due
next year.
   Trinidad has had a boom-to-bust economy over the last 20 years
tied to the world price of oil, its main source of wealth.
   The 1970s oil boom brought prosperity and gave Trinidadians the
highest standard of living in the Caribbean. The bottom fell out of
the oil market in the 1980s and Trinidad's gross national product,
the value of all goods and services, has dropped 41 percent in
eight years.
   Robinson led the new National Alliance for Reconstruction to a
landslide in 1986 with promises of recovery, ousting the People's
National Movement, which had been in power since colonial days.
   He has tried to diversify the economy, partly by expanding
tourism, to which the island was largely indifferent during the oil
boom. Unpopular austerity measures demanded by the IMF in return
for loans included wage freezes, new taxes, public employee layoffs
and devaluations that cut the Trinidad dollar's value from about 42
cents to 24.
   Officials say the economy has shown signs of recovery, but that
Robinson's reserved personal style and an unraveling of his
coalition weakened the government.
   ``There is discontent in the country,'' government spokesman
Gregory Shaw said. ``Apparently, he (Abu Bakr) took this as a sign
that the people were ready to revolt, but that is not the way
Trinidadians change government.''
   Much of downtown Port-of-Spain was looted, prompting
international assistance that began with food shipments last week
from Venezuela.
   Tourism and foreign investment are expected to suffer.
   ``We will have to make an effort to win people's confidence,''
Shaw said.
   There were signs of strained ethnic relations during the
violence. Looters shouted epihets at Arab store owners and Moslems
were the targets of anger.
   Most of Trinidad's 1.3 million people are Hindu or Christian,
each representing more than 40 percent. Moslems make up about 6
percent and, among them, East Indians outnumber the blacks 20 to 1.
   Many East Indians scorn black Moslems as a sect outside the
mainstream Islamic community, an attitude resented by the Bakr and
his followers.
   Confidence in Robinson's government could be undermined by the
fact that such a small group was able to cripple the nation.
   Abu Bakr's sect had been involved in court cases and with
police. It was under surveillance and police spokesman Winston
Cooper said ``the Libyan connection was established.''
   Authorities say sect members received money and training from
Libya, although there is no evidence Moammar Gadhafi, Libya's
leader, was linked to the coup attempt.
   Raffique Shah, managing editor of The Mirror, said he hoped
other would-be rescuers of Trinidad would learn from Bakr's attempt
and ``see the futility of such action.''
   As the week ended, turmoil in another land offered some hope to
Trinidad. The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait pushed oil prices up.

   The Senate today pushed toward completion of a
$289 billion defense plan for next year, the last item standing in
the way of its summer vacation.
   The senators were eager to follow their House colleagues, who
adjourned early this morning until after Labor Day.
   Before leaving, the House passed major civil rights legislation
opposed by President Bush and a Democratic-sponsored campaign
finance overhaul. As lawmakers rushed for the doors, the House also
sent to the president a long-awaited bill designed to cut down on
offshore oil spills.
   The Senate held its unusual Saturday session on the defense bill
rather than coming back to work next week.
   In a marathon Friday session, which ended in the early morning
hours today, the Senate passed an emergency debt bill. And, despite
the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq that began Wednesday, the Senate
also early today approved by voice vote and without debate the
nomination of Edward W. Gnehm to be U.S. ambassador to Kuwait.
   The Civil Rights Act of 1990 passed the House by a strong
272-154 vote after Democrats beat back an administration-backed
attempt to water down the anti-discrimination bill.
   The bill, similar to a version passed earlier by the Senate,
would overturn the effects of five Supreme Court rulings that have
gone against the policy of affirmative action.
   The most controversial provisions in the bill would make it
easier for victims of discrimination to use statistics to win
lawsuits against employers for punitive damages.
   Bush, in a letter to House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill.,
said the legislation would ``have the effect of forcing businesses
to adopt quotas in hiring and promotion.''
   ``It will also foster divisiveness and litigation rather than
conciliation and do more to promote legal fees than civil rights,''
Bush said.
   But the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jack
Brooks, D-Texas, said weakening those provisions would ``rip the
heart out of'' the bill.
   The House and Senate must agree on a single version of the
legislation before it could be sent to Bush's desk. While making a
veto threat, the president left himself open to what he called a
``sound, practical compromise.''
   There was little spirit of compromise when the House Democratic
leadership pushed through its party's version of a campaign finance
package.
   After nearly nine hours of raucous partisan battle, the
Democrats pushed aside proposals from both Republicans and from
within their own party and prevailed, 255-155.
   The Democratic bill would limit House campaign spending to
$715,000 per candidate and limit campaign contributions from
political action committees, or PACs, to half of a candidate's the
total spending ceiling.
   Small-donor PACs, primarily labor unions, could continue
contributing up to $10,000 per candidate, $5,000 each for the
primary and general elections.
   However, PACs that raise more than $240 a year from an
individual _ primarily those organized by corporate executives _
could contribute only $2,000 per candidate.
   While it has no public financing, as some Democrats favored, the
bill would establish a $50 tax credit for small donors.
   The Republican alternative, rejected 241-169, had no spending
ceilings but would cut allowable contributions from special
interest political action committees and ban PACs set up by some
House members to further their own House careers.
   Before adjourning, the House also:
   _Sent the president a bill making permanent the duty-free status
of imports from 24 Caribbean and Central American nations,
including Nicaragua and Panama. The bill also would restrict
exports of raw U.S. timber.
   _Gave final congressional passage to a bill boosting the
liability of shippers for the cost of cleaning up oil spills and
requiring new tankers to have leak-resistant double hulls. It would
also require the government to check for drunken automobile driving
offenses before issuing licenses to tanker operators.
   _Approved by voice vote a plan to provide more than $4 billion
over five years to help communities hardest hit by AIDS.
   The House on Friday, and the Senate early today passed an
emergency bill giving the Treasury $72 billion in additional
borrowing authority through Oct. 2. The bill was needed to avert a
default, as long-term action to increase the national debt has been
bottled up while Congress and the White House work out a budget
deal.
   The Senate today planned to finish its defense bill. But first,
a long debate is scheduled over how much money should be spent on
the Strategic Defense Initiative, the ``Star Wars'' defense program.
   During debate which lasted into this morning, the Senate
rejected a proposal to increase by 30,000 the 100,000 troop cut
already in the bill. Bush had proposed only a 40,000 cut.
   The Senate also debated, but then set aside, an amendment to
allow abortions in military hospitals for personnel and their
dependents willing to pay for the procedure.

   Saudi Arabia has been subdued in its
reaction to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, which places Iraqi forces
near the oil-rich kingdom's border.
   Oil executives said Saudi Arabia has not and will not take the
most potent action possible against Iraq _ closing the pipeline
that carries Iraqi oil for export across Saudi Arabia to the Red
Sea.
   The executives said the Saudis believe this would give Iraq's
belligerent president, Saddam Hussein, an excuse to attack and
occupy Saudi oil fields 150 miles south of Kuwait, giving Iraq
control of more oil than any other country in the world.
   The only direct Saudi statement since the invasion was made by
an anonymous government spokesman through the official Saudi Press
Agency the day after the Iraqi move.
   The statement said Saudi Arabia was following the Kuwait
situation ``with extreme concern'' and that King Fahd would be
seeking to calm the situation and to find a solution ``in a manner
ensuring the interests of all.'' The statement did not condemn the
invasion.
   The only tangible help Saudi Arabia gave the Kuwaiti government
in the wake of the invasion was to shelter members of the ruling
family, including the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and the
crown prince. Both nations are tightly run by royal families and
have been close allies.
   The Saudis also allowed the Kuwaiti royal family to briefly
operate a radio, reportedly from a mobile van, in the area around
the Saudi-Kuwait border.
   But Friday the radio went off the air after a desperate call:
``The people of Kuwait appeal to you oh brethren, oh Arabs, oh
beloved brothers, oh Moslems, rush, rush to their help.''
   It was not known if the radio had been discovered by the Iraqis
or shut down by the Saudis to avoid provoking Saddam at a time when
fears were being expressed that he might invade Saudi Arabia as
well.
   Saudi Arabia borders Kuwait and Iraq's invasion forces were
reportedly near the Saudi border.
   The Saudis did condemned the invasion as part of a joint
statement issued by the Gulf Cooperation Council, in which it is
allied with Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and
Bahrain.
   The six states issued a statement saying, ``We strongly condemn
and are very sorry for this attack that one Arab state took against
another Arab state. ... We do not recognize anything resulting from
it.''
   Iraq's 1-million-member armed forces is clearly too much for the
joint 3,000-member Gulf Cooperation Council force or Saudi Arabia's
65,700-member army.
   Saudi Arabia was also one of the 14 members of the 21-member
Arab League that condemned the invasion in the same terms as the
Gulf Cooperation Council.
   The Arab League, with one-third of its members voting against
the resolution or abstaining, was clearly unable to take any direct
action.
   Turkey has also refused to take action and has not commented
about President Bush's suggestion that it cut off Iraq's oil
pipeline to the Mediterranean. Two parallel pipelines pump Iraqi
crude oil to a terminal at Yumurtalik at the eastern corner of
Turkey's Mediterranean coast and constitute Iraq's major oil export
outlet.

<HEAD>European Community To Halt Oil Imports from Iraq, Kuwait</HEAD>

<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with other EC sanctions. No pickup.</NOTE>

   The 12 nations of the European Community voted today
to impose an embargo on imports of oil from Iraq and Kuwait and to
suspend arms sales to Iraq to protest Baghdad's invasion of its
oil-rich neighbor, an official said.
   The decision was taken during a meeting of senior EC foreign
ministry officials in Rome called by Italy, the current EC
president, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Giovanni Castellaneta.
   He said the sanctions were designed to pressure Iraq into an
immediate, unconditional withdrawal of its forces from Kuwait.
   The EC nations also voted to end cooperation with Iraq in the
military, technical and scientific fields, according to a
communique.
   In 1989, oil from both Iraq and Kuwait accounted for 10.9
percent of the EC's total imports. Within the EC, Denmark is the
most dependent on oil from the two countries, importing 54 percent
of its oil from them.
   The United States has also imposed an embargo on Iraqi oil,
included in a decree issued Thursday that blocked all imports from
Iraq and froze Kuwaiti and Iraqi assets in the United States.
   The action by the EC _ whose members include France, West
Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark, Greece,
Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom _ was the latest
of many taken against Baghdad.
   In the Middle East, Europe and the United States Friday, intense
diplomatic activity was under way to pressure Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein to pull the estimated 100,000 troops he initially
sent into the oil-rich shiekdom and any other reinforcements that
may have been deployed.
   Britain announced it was sending two frigates to join the HMS
York in the Persian Gulf, and France said it would station a second
warship in the waterway. The Pentagon said a third aircraft carrier
was being readied to head to the Middle East to bolster the
eight-ship U.S. Navy presence already there.
   The EC statement issued today condemned the ``brutal'' Iraqi
invasion and described as ``groundless and unacceptable'' Iraq's
justification for the military action. Iraq claimed that it invaded
at the invitation of unidentified rebels it said had already
overthrown Kuwait's government.
   The statement said the EC was also suspending Iraq's trade
preference status, which gives nations duty free access for
manufactured goods. The move is aimed at denying Iraq trade
advantages for its petrochemical exports.
   Senior foreign ministry officials said ``appropriate measures''
would be taken to freeze Iraqi assets. The statement did not
elaborate, although many EC nations have already frozen Iraqi or
Kuwaiti assets or both.
   Protests against the Iraqi invasion grew Friday with
condemnations from the Organization of African Unity, China, India,
Tunisia and Zimbabwe.
   The United States and Soviet Union made an unprecedented joint
condemnation of Iraq and called on all countries to cut off
Baghdad's arms supply.
   The statement was read by U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker
III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in Moscow on
Friday.
   The Soviet Union, Iraq's major arms supplier, cut off shipments
Thursday.
   France and Italy suspended arms exports to Iraq, and
Czechoslovakia cut off all shipments that could ``serve a military
purpose.''
   Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen hinted today that his
country would not impose sanctions against Iraq.
   ``The issue should be solved within the scope of inter-Arab
relations,'' the official Xinhua News Agency paraphrased Qian as
saying.
   At NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, the United States
alerted its allies that ``Iraq may have designs beyond Kuwait'' and
said it has drawn up ``contingency plans of action to respond to
that eventuality,'' an alliance source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Friday.
   He referred to reports that Iraqi sources were massing near
Kuwait's border with Saudi Arabia. He did not, however, say what
those plans were.
   The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Thomas R. Pickering,
said the Security Council was discussing a U.S. proposal for
sweeping economic and military sanctions against Iraq and that they
could be adopted this weekend.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan told President Bush Tokyo
was ready to impose economic sanctions if the United Nations votes
to do so, the Foreign Ministry said.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Friday Israel must be
prepared to confront ``evil developments'' resulting from Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait. He also called for international action to end
Iraqi expansionism.
   Japan, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands,
Norway and Luxembourg announced that they would also freeze Kuwaiti
assets to protect them from being seized by the provisional
government installed in Kuwait by Iraq.
   The United States and France froze Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets on
Thursday, and Switzerland ordered its banks to increase vigilance
over Kuwaiti assets to prevent their seizure. Britain froze only
Kuwaiti assets.
   In the Middle East, only Lebanon and Iran called for an Iraqi
withdrawal on Thursday.
   But on Friday, Egypt and the Gulf Cooperation Council condemned
the invasion and called for an immediate Iraqi withdrawal.
   The Arab League Council also condemned the attack but warned
against foreign intervention. It said the issue would be taken up
by Arab leaders who would decide whether to hold a summit to find
``a lasting negotiated solution acceptable by the two sides.''
   A mini Arab League summit initially planned for Sunday was no
longer certain, according to Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak. He
gave no reason for a switch.

   When Hiroshima remembers the atom bomb
it is with a flock of doves and a mournful tolling of bells. On the
central monument to the bomb victims is a prayer ``that this evil
shall never be repeated.''
   Forty-five years after the United States dropped the first
atomic bomb, Hiroshima continues to lay the grim realities of
nuclear war before the world.
   In Japan, most remembrances of the Aug. 6, 1945 bombing focus on
the horrors of the atom bomb and the 140,000 deaths it caused, and
rarely on the responsibility of the warring nations.
   When Hiroshima began refurbishing its Peace Memorial Museum last
year, 16 groups of citizens, bomb victims and labor unions demanded
the city include an ``aggressor's corner'' that would focus on
Japan's aggressive role in World War II.
   City officials refused. In a written statement, the city quoted
former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who said in 1988 that it
was unclear that Japan was an aggressor in World War II.
   ``The purpose of this museum is to bear witness to what happened
on August 6th in Hiroshima,'' said Yoshitaka Kawamoto, president of
the museum.
   The museum's exhibits say the atomic attack was aimed at
civilians.
   ``If we had a display about Japan's aggressive role, people will
think it is natural for aggressors to be atom-bombed,'' said Toru
Kataoka, manager of the Peace Culture Center, which is housed in
one of three major buildings at the Peace Park. ``It opposes our
basic policy on the museum, which is to pray for the victims.''
   More than 20,000 of those victims were Koreans, brought here as
slave laborers during Japan's 35-year colonization of the
neighboring Korean peninsula.
   They have seldom been recognized.
   When South Koreans built a monument in 1970 to honor their
countrymen who died in the blast, city officials said there was no
room in the Peace Memorial Park, citing the 20 monuments there
already.
   The Koreans kept up their pressure and in May, the city relented.
   In Hiroshima, the city's efforts to preserve the horrific
experience continue. Last year, the city collected more than $2.5
million in public donations to preserve the atom-bomb dome, the
hulking skeletal remnants of a building left standing near the
center of the blast.
   Preserving the dome is important ``because its ravaged state
sounds a warning about the potential for humanity to destroy itself
with nuclear weapons,'' Mayor Takeshi Araki said last year.
   Most Japanese observe the anniversary of the atomic bombings
mournfully, adding names to lists of those who have died in the
past year due to the continuing effects of radiation or other
injuries.
   This year, the victims will also be honored in the United States.
   At a desert ceremony west of Salt Lake City later this month,
members of the squadron that dropped the bomb on Hiroshima will
dedicate a 16-foot obelisk honoring their bomber group and ``all
who contributed to bring this dreadful war to an end.''
   The group will also honor those who died in the blast at
Hiroshima and at Nagasaki, where a second atom bomb was dropped
three days after the bombing of Hiroshima.
   Japan surrendered six days after the atomic bombing of Nagasaki,
ending World War II.

   Half a million homeless victims of the
Iranian earthquake are threatened by food shortages and the frigid
weather about to descend on northern Iran.
   The quake June 21 killed 40,000 people and injured 60,000 in
Gilan and Zanjan provinces, where temperatures sometimes drop to
zero in winter.
   Housing the refugees before then is the government's main
priority, Abdollah Nouri, the Iranian interior minister, said last
week.
   Nouri said on Iranian television a parliamentary committee
estimated more than 200,000 houses would have to be built
eventually, then added: ``In about two months, we have to provide
temporary shelters for the homeless.''
   Relief efforts clearly have been inadequate. The government,
already burdened by reconstruction needs after an eight-year war
with Iraq, is short of cash, equipment and materials.
   The interior minister acknowledged that ``we cannot build what
we want, given the means at our disposal.''
   Each homeless family will be given a limited amount of
construction materials and technical support to build a shelter of
about 10-by-13 feet to get through the winter, Nouri said.
   He emphasized that the refugees would have to build the shelters
themselves. More than 100,000 people now live in tents.
   An Asian diplomat based in Tehran, who visited the stricken
areas to deliver truckloads of aid sent by his government, told The
Associated Press construction of the shelters had not yet begun.
   He said reconstruction was ``in a bureaucratic tangle,'' and it
appeared doubtful that enough shelters could be built before
winter. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Tehran radio said construction of the shelters and repair of
damaged houses involved five different ministries.
   Heavy winter snows and frigid temperatures are the rule in Gilan
and Zanjan provinces.
   Manjil, a Gilan town in one of the worst-hit areas, is so windy
that residents customarily spend winters in near-hibernation to
escape the cold.
   At a recent prayer meeting in Rudbar, a devastated town in Gilan
province, Friday prayer leader Hojatoleslam Vahedi urged
authorities to rush construction of temporary housing.
   The earthquake struck a rich agricultural area in mid-harvest.
Survivors worry about facing winter with their crops ungathered and
food scarce. Relief workers have been helping with the harvest,
vaccinating cattle and rebuilding irrigation canals.
   A report on Tehran radio said farmers would be paid higher
prices for their crops this year.
   Nouri said on television that rebuilding schools before the new
academic year starts in September was another priority. He urged
people to provide what help they could in rebuilding or repairing
about 1,200 structures.
   More than 400 aftershocks, some of them strong, shook the two
provinces after the June 21 quake. The most recent was recorded
July 19.
   The tremors have caused panic among survivors and made it
difficult for them to patch their damaged homes.
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani toured the area after the quake and
said: ``All the people are anxious. They cannot live in the damaged
houses, as they rightly cannot feel safe there.''
   Tehran radio said power and water had been restored to the main
towns in the quake area, roads were being repaired and crews were
working to restore services to 1,500 affected villages.
   Parliament revised the current budget to allocate $300 million
for the victims.
   Outside aid in the form of cash, food, tents, medicine and
clothing totaled $84 million from 45 countries, the U.N. Disaster
Relief Organization reported.
   Seifollah Dastjerdi, head of Iran's Red Crescent Society, said
only $2.5 million of the total was in cash. He also said the
recommended use dates on many donated medicines had expired or were
about to do so.
   Iran surprised some observers by accepting $760,000 worth of
supplies from the United States, which its officials call the
``Great Satan.''

   Claude Buckner sat with his two dogs in
the shade of his little weather-beaten house and shook his head at
the trucks that rumbled by on the road in front of his yard.
   Apparently his next-door neighbor, legendary rock 'n' roller
Chuck Berry, was having more asphalt work done.
   ``They must be going to blacktop the whole farm,'' joked
Buckner, 81, a retired farmer who sees most of the comings and
goings on Buckner Road, named for his grandfather.
   Neighbors like Buckner say they see little of the intensely
private Berry, who first hit the radio airwaves in 1955 with
``Maybellene'' and later with such early rock 'n' roll hits as
``Johnny B. Goode,'' ``Roll Over Beethoven'' and ``Sweet Little
Sixteen.''
   The 63-year-old Berry still performs today, but now he's in the
spotlight for a different reason _ drug and child abuse charges.
   It's not the first time Berry has been in trouble with the law.
In 1944, when Berry was 18, he was sent to a Missouri prison after
being convicted of armed robbery. In 1960, he was convicted of
illegally transporting a 14-year-old girl across state lines for
immoral purposes. Some of his defenders said he was charged because
he is black and the girl was white.
   This time, St. Charles County authorities say they found
marijuana and films of nude girls under 17 at his compound, Berry
Park, about three miles south of Wentzville. Authorities accuse
Berry of making the films himself.
   On Monday, Berry returned from a European tour and turned
himself in, posted the required 10 percent of $20,000 bond and was
released. He has not yet entered a formal plea but he has denied
the charges.
   People in Wentzville say Berry, famous for his guitar style and
stooped duck walk, keeps a low profile.
   ``We've been out here almost 20 years,'' said neighbor Ed
Garwood, a 79-year-old retired real estate salesman. ``Never seen
the guy.''
   Berry Park is roughly 150 acres, separated from Buckner Road by
a 7-foot chain-link fence that runs alongside the road for about a
mile.
   Neighbors say Berry has bought up houses along the road to
extend the compound through the years. He paves the driveways and
puts up the same fence. Some of the places are rented out; others
are empty.
   A granite cemetery monument marks the main gate. The words
``Berry Park, Founded Aug. 15, 1957'' and the names of family
members are chiseled in. Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones and
Eric Clapton have visited there.
   In town, which is about 40 miles west of St. Louis, Berry's name
gets mixed reaction.
   George Ehll calls him a friend.
   Ehll is the manager of the Western Auto and the chief of the
volunteer fire department, which has been called out to fight grass
fires at Berry Park. Last year, they were called to a fire that
destroyed Berry's recording studio.
   ``He comes in here occasionally,'' Ehll said from behind the
counter at his store. ``I think everybody realizes who he is, but I
don't think they blow it out of proportion.''
   Other people remember that Berry used to have parties and
concerts at Berry Park in the 1970s.
   ``He used to have some hellacious parties out there,'' said
Capt. Tom Neer of the St. Charles County sheriff's department.
   ``Hippies,'' said Buckner. ``They tore up everything. You
couldn't get up the road.''
   Linda Baker, 31, grew up on the other side of the woods behind
Berry Park. As a teen-ager, she could hear the parties, but her
mother wouldn't let her go.
   As a bartender, Baker has served Berry orange juice a time or
two. He doesn't drink alcoholic beverages, she said, and that's why
she was surprised when she heard about the charges against him.
   ``He just seemed like another person,'' Baker said from behind
the bar at Just Plain Country, a dimly lit tavern. ``I was real
surprised what happened, kind of disappointed.''
   The charges stem from a raid in June by local drug agents at
Berry Park. An informant had told officials that Berry had received
a large amount of cocaine.
   Authorities found no cocaine, but they said they did turn up
several plastic bags of marijuana, some hashish, two .22-caliber
rifles and a shotgun, plus $122,000 and various pornographic
videotapes, slides and books.
   Berry has other trouble, too.
   Last December, a former cook at his Southern Air restaurant in
Wentzville sued him, alleging he made videotapes of her and other
women as they dressed, undressed and used the toilet in the women's
restroom there.
   Earlier this summer, a class-action lawsuit was filed against
him on behalf of 200 other women.
   Berry's attorney, Wayne T. Schoeneberg, said the charges and
suits have caused Berry to lose some bookings.
   ``I think there's a certain element of people who are offended
at any mention of drugs or sex,'' Schoeneberg said. ``It's a tough
charge _ even if you're acquitted, people always want to think the
worst.
   ``I think Chuck Berry is a man who basically wants to be left
alone, who has tried not to bother anybody and for some reason,
unknown to me, people seem to resent that.''

   Diplomats planned a weekend of private
talks on sanctions the United States wants imposed if Iraq fails to
withdraw troops from Kuwait.
   ``We are in a state of consultation, which is the preparatory
stage of moving to sanctions and we will keep our eye on the
process going on to bring peace and a settlement to the area,''
U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering told reporters Friday night.
   A U.S. official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity,
said the U.S. government might call for an emergency meeting of the
U.N. Security Council during the weekend to seek adoption of a
resolution on sanctions.
   Iraq said it invaded Kuwait Thursday to provide security for a
provisional government that had overthrown Kuwait's rulers. The
international community dismissed the claim.
   On Friday, an Iraqi government spokesman said all troops in
Kuwait will be withdrawn according to a timetable, beginning
Sunday, according to an official radio broadcast.
   But moves to put more international pressure on Iraq continued
at the United Nations.
   Earlier Friday, Pickering said members of the Security Council
showed ``strong interest'' in U.S.-proposed measures to punish Iraq
for defying a council resolution demanding an unconditional
withdrawal of troops from neighboring Kuwait.
   The resolution approved by the 15-member Security Council
following the Iraqi invasion also called for immediate negotiations
between Iraq and Kuwait.
   The resolution raised the prospect of a punitive U.N. response
by saying the council would meet again if necessary to consider
further steps to ensure compliance. In U.N. parlance, that means
the council is prepared to impose sanctions if the demands of the
resolution are not met.
   Pickering said the United States seeks sweeping sanctions
covering economic, trade, financial and military aspects. The
military measures would include an embargo on arms, military
supplies, training and equipment, but would not cover the
possibility of deploying U.N. or international troops to force Iraq
to withdraw from Kuwait.
   The Security Council rarely imposes sanctions, but improved
U.S.-Soviet relations increase the possibility that the five
permanent members _ the United States, Soviet Union, Britain,
France and China _ would work together to punish Iraq.
   But diplomats, speaking privately, said China was not supporting
the proposed sanctions. As one of the five permanent council
members, it has veto power.
   In Moscow, the United States and the Soviet Union issued a joint
statement Friday that said both countries sought immediate
compliance with the U.N. resolution in response to the Iraqi
invasion.
   The U.N. Charter provides that the Security Council may call
upon members to impose sanctions, including economic sanctions and
interruption of travel and communications and severing diplomatic
relations.
   In extreme cases, the council may employ blockades and military
operations by the air, sea or land forces of U.N. members.
   The council last threatened sanctions in 1987, aiming to bring
about a cease-fire in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
   The current non-permanent members of the Security Council are
Yemen, Romania, Cuba, Canada, Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia,
Finland, Malaysia and Zaire.

<HEAD>Mapplethorpe: His Photos Are Controversial But Are They Great Art?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE BARTZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert Mapplethorpe stirred national attention
with sexually explicit photographs, but without the controversy
would his work be regarded, as one Boston columnist sees it, ``so
mediocre Woolworth's wouldn't carry it?''
   Art dealer Robert Klein is among many who rank Mapplethorpe a
lot higher than that. He had that feeling from the first
photographs he saw.
   ``I remember thinking they were very elegant,'' he said. ``Cool,
elegant, highly polished photographs and down and dirty, that's the
way his career ran.''
   But the reviews of Mapplethorpe are often mixed. He is cited as
making breakthroughs in his picture selection, and as a fine
technician and beautiful framer. But he is faulted most often for
providing pictures that are, oddly, too pretty.
   A show of his work, ``Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment''
opened at The Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston on Wednesday.
   The show, which runs through Oct. 4, ends a national tour that
resulted in an obscenity indictment in Cincinnati.
   The show is a retrospective that Mapplethorpe helped put
together shortly before he died of AIDS last year at age 42. The
124 photographs are mainly portraits and pictures of flowers, but
about a quarter of them are sexually graphic.
   ``Robert's sensibility is not only in the work but also in the
selection of the work. Robert is someone who was very involved in
the details, in aesthetic points,'' said David Ross, the ICA's
director.
   He agrees with the many critics who say Mapplethorpe's prints
are technically exquisite.
   ``He transcended the fact of what he was supposed to photograph
and added an essence of his own. The flower studies are really
amazing,'' said Sylvia Wolf, an assistant curator of photography at
the Art Institute of Chicago. ``You don't even have to see his
nudes because if you look at the flowers you can really sense his
nudes behind him. The calla lilies just drip and droop.''
   ``There are very few photographers who would emphasize print
quality and Robert was one of those,'' agreed Marvin Heiferman, a
free-lance curator and critic in New York.
   But the choice in subject matter itself is an artistic decision,
and Mapplethorpe's inclusion of homosexual and sadomasochistic acts
in his photographs pushed at the bounds of what's taboo, said
Heiferman.
   ``His contribution is the admission of that kind of subject
matter. People think nothing of a female nude,'' he added. ``Robert
photographed male genitalia just like he photographed anything
else.''
   Kay Larson, writing in New York magazine, pointed to a
provocative photograph of weight lifter Lisa Lyon, a favorite
Mapplethorpe subject, and said:
   ``Unlike pornography, which prefers to keep its taboos firmly in
place (the better to violate them), this image coolly aims a
shotgun at the cultural prohibition against self-arousal. The
picture is riveting because of its utter candor.''
   Even in such photographs, Mapplethorpe's classical sensibilities
are detectable, Ross said.
   Some of his last photographs were of black, male nudes in simple
poses with taut muscles and gleaming, almost metallic-looking skin.
   And Ross described Mapplethorpe as a formalist, citing the
photographer's statements that he would have been a sculptor if he
had lived 100 years ago.
   ``Mapplethorpe's work is really very mainstream, very classical
in some ways,'' he said. ``He uses (the camera) as if its still the
1870s.''
   It is exactly on those grounds that free-lance photography
critic A.D. Coleman sharply criticizes Mapplethorpe.
   ``That's a very simplistic use of photography ... to use the
camera simply as a recording device,'' he said in a telephone
interview from his home in Staten Island.
   ``I consider him to be a minor photographer and I don't think he
would have a significant place in the history of photography
without the controversy and I'm not sure he will with it,'' he
added. ``The flower studies are warmed-over pictorialism.''
   Doug Ischar, a free-lance critic who teaches photography at the
University of Illinois, scored Mapplethorpe's work as nothing more
than beautiful design.
   ``I don't think it's important artwork in terms of the art of
the 20th century,'' he said. ``It's very conservative. In a way,
he's an imitation of (Andy) Warhol. He's a success but he didn't
make the sort of aesthetic breakthroughs that Warhol did.''
   Asked what impact Mapplethorpe would have on history, Coleman
replied: ``I don't see a thought there, so I don't know how I would
recognize (any influence Mapplethorpe may have had). What he had
was a willingness and an opportunity to address a sort of subject
matter.''

<HEAD>Soviet Press Denounces Iraqi Invasion as a `Blitzkrieg'</HEAD>

   The Soviet press unleashed harsh criticism
Saturday against Iraq and its leader, Saddam Hussein, calling
Moscow's old ally a ``totalitarian regime'' and calling the attack
on Kuwait a ``blitzkrieg.''
   While press accounts did not criticize Saddam by name, they did
refer negatively to ``Baghdad's rulers,'' and regretted that Soviet
weaponry was used to satisfy ``the ambitious designs of
near-sighted politicians.''
   Moscow and Baghdad have had a friendship treaty since 1972, and
the Soviet Union is Iraq's major arms supplier.
   Since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Thursday, however, the Soviet
Union has cut off weapons supplies to Iraq and demanded that
Baghdad pull its troops out of Kuwait.
   The nation the Soviet Union has praised in the past for its
``peace-loving foreign policy,'' was slammed in the media Saturday
for its ``brutal aggression'' and ``hegemonistic'' foreign policy.
   ``Iraqi Blitzkrieg,'' was the headline atop a commentary in the
Rabochaya Tribuna (Worker's Tribune) newspaper, using the word that
described Nazi Germany's ``lightning war'' half a century ago.
   In a nation that lost millions of people in World War II, the
Nazi-era reference carries a deeply negative meaning.
   ``The issue of aggression had been decided long before, on a
dark, southern night,'' wrote the newspaper's Vladimir Mikhailov.
``The guns barked, the bombers took off, the tanks ripped into the
border of Kuwait. ... While talks were under way, the stamp of
soldiers' boots could be heard from Iraq.''
   Iraq's leaders ``were convinced their aggression would go
unpunished,'' he wrote.
   Striking a sympathetic tone toward Kuwait, Mikhailov asked:
``What kind of adversary is it whose total troops, including
police, are less than 20,000, whose territory is 25 times smaller
than Iraq's, and whose population is less than half of Baghdad's!''
   ``It's logical from the point of view of a totalitarian
regime,'' he said.
   A. Shumilin, writing in the Communist Party's youth newspaper,
Komsomolskaya Pravda, said ``this act of unprecedented aggression
should be regarded as yet another manifestation of the frankly
hegemonist policy of Baghdad in the region.''
   ``It's to be regretted that the Soviet weaponry which comprises
the backbone of Iraq's military is being used for fanning regional
conflicts for the sake of satisfying ambitious designs of
near-sighted politicians,'' he said.
   The newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya also referred to the
``hegemonistic nature of the Iraqi leadership's foreign policy over
the past decade.''
   While the Communist Party newspaper Pravda did not carry a
commentary critical of Iraq, it did provide candid accounts of the
attack.
   It said Iraq's ``invading army included tens of thousands of
troops and hundreds of tanks and warplanes. According to
preliminary reports, some 200 Kuwaiti people were killed, including
Sheikh Fahd al-Sabah, one of the emir's brothers, who took part in
the defense of the monarch's palace.''
   Similarly, the official Soviet news agency, Tass, reprinted a
report from an Egyptian newspaper that Saddam personally ordered
the execution of 120 Iraqi officers on Friday for saying the
invasion was a crime.
   Mikhailov, in the Worker's Tribune, also described the Iraqi
invasion as a ``crime.''
   ``The events are tragic but we have confirmation that the world
has changed,'' he wrote.
   ``Look at the immediate reaction from the U.N. Security Council.
Look at the measures taken against Iraq by the rest of the world.
Look at the extremely negative reaction of the international
community.
   ``This leaves us hope for the future,'' Mikhailov said.

   It was business as usual for most
shipping in the Persian Gulf, but U.S.-flagged tankers were moving
warily Saturday, depending on the U.S. Navy for guidance.
   Eight U.S. warships are inside the waterway. Gulf shipping
executives said the warships were operating normally, but added
that they had cut down on their radio communications.
   ``The U.S. warships are just not talking as much as usual, and
not identifying themselves,'' said one shipping executive, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A shipping executive at the bustling port of Dubai said: ``There
is no tension, all is normal, but the American vessels are being
cautious.''
   Another executive, reached at Ras Tanura, the main Saudi oil
loading terminal about 125 miles south of the Kuwaiti borders said:
``There is no problem absolutely, loading and unloading is normal.''
   Two of the five Kuwaiti tankers which still fly the U.S. flag,
suspended their journeys to Kuwait after Iraq's Thursday invasion
of Kuwait.
   Kuwait re-registered 11 tankers to fly the U.S. flag at the
height of the Iraq-Iran war to entitle them to U.S. Navy protection.
   Saturday, the Kittanning, a U.S. tanker, was overheard by radio
monitors in the region asking the U.S. Navy whether it should
continue to the Saudi Arabian port of Ras Tanura.
   The operator on the American warship, which was not identified,
said he would check. Within 10 minutes he came back to advise the
Kittanning ``no problem, continue.''
   Scores of oil tankers were destroyed during the last few years
of the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, which ended in 1988. Iran and Iraq
attacked some 550 vessels of various nationalities during the war
in an effort to cut off shipping to the opposing side.

   The jurors in Mayor Marion Barry's drug and
perjury trial asked for all government and defense exhibits today
as they continued weighing the mayor's fate.
   In six weeks of testimony, prosecutors introduced more than 100
pieces of evidence; Barry's attorneys produced almost 60 documents.
   The jurors' request came after U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson revealed Friday that the jurors can release
verdicts on a piecemeal basis, one count at a time.
   The jury of nine women and three men planned a half-day of
deliberations today. Deliberations began Thursday.
   Meanwhile, Barry shrugged off questions about his trial Friday
while jurors were deliberating his fate.
   ``I feel fantastic,'' he said after addressing a group of city
youth leaders. Asked whether he was encouraged by the way his trial
had gone, he said, ``I'm encouraged by these young people here.''
   The three-term mayor refused to answer other questions about his
legal situation.
   The jurors, meanwhile, apparently were unaware of a botched drug
sting at their suburban Maryland hotel Thursday night that targeted
an associate of the late University of Maryland basketball star Len
Bias.
   Like a scene from a movie, the futile sting operation involved
helicopters, search dogs and an escape car ramming police cruisers.
   Authorities said the drug sting was aimed at Brian Tribble, a
friend of Bias who died in June 1986 of cocaine poisoning a day
after signing with the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball
Association.
   Peter Gruden, special agent in charge of the federal Drug
Enforcement Administration's Washington field office, said he was
``pretty sure that it was not known'' by the DEA that the Barry
jury was sequestered at the hotel.
   The identity of the jury's hotel throughout the two-month trial
had not been made public.
   Tribble was lured to the hotel to purchase cocaine but fled as
authorities moved in, officials said. An associate was taken into
custody and faced arraignment on drug possession charges.
   Tribble drove off, rammed two police vehicles blocking his
escape, drove back to the hotel and fled into a wooded area, said
Prince George's County, Md., police.
   In a brief court session on an unrelated matter, Barry's chief
lawyer, R. Kenneth Mundy said he ``wants a representation on the
record'' that the jurors weren't aware of the incident operation.
   Judge Jackson agreed and said ``I was assured'' by the U.S.
Marshals Service, which provides court security, that ``our jurors
were oblivious'' to the sting. Mundy pointed out that someone would
have had to ask them a question about the sting to ensure the
jurors were unaware of it.
   ``They may have been aware there was a commotion,'' said
Jackson, who then agreed to include such an assurance in the court
record.
   One of the cocaine possession charges Barry faces stems from his
Jan. 18 arrest in an FBI sting operation at a downtown Washington
hotel.
   After speaking to the teen-agers at the youth forum, Barry met
with top staff members and cabinet officials in his office. It was
the first time the mayor had visited city hall without having to
rush back to the federal courthouse since jury selection in his
trial began June 4.
   Barry was tried on 10 misdemeanor cocaine possession charges,
one misdemeanor conspiracy count and three felony charges of lying
to a grand jury about his drug use.
   After closing arguments in the case Thursday, he predicted he
would be acquitted completely.
   The jury on Friday asked for complete sets of the 32-page
instruction booklet read Thursday by Jackson, and later asked to
look at a chart listing the month and year that government
witnesses have testified that they used drugs with Barry.
   The panel also requested a copy of a form in which one witness
agreed to cooperate with the government.

   Voters will decide Tuesday whether to
add $10 a year to the average property tax bill to put the big
cats, apes and other animals at the city zoo into better housing.
Opponents say the money would be better spent on people.
   Friends of the Kansas City Zoo want to double the zoo's size,
providing large, open habitats that would allow animals to roam
together as they do in the wild. They say the zoo is substandard
and needs renovating to ensure better care for the animals. They
also say the plan would help with sagging attendance.
   Critics, particularly some black groups, say the tax money is
needed to combat more immediate problems like drugs, crime,
substandard housing and lack of health care for the poor.
   Opponents also say higher-income taxpayers in the suburbs should
pay for zoo improvements they will enjoy as much as the people of
Kansas City.
   The $50 million bond issue to finance the proposal will require
57 percent of the votes cast Tuesday, and both sides are predicting
a close election.
   ``It's just a low priority right now, especially when you're
talking about public funds,'' said the Rev. Nelson Thompson of the
Black Agenda Group. ``We feel it's an undue burden; it's an
untimely proposition.''
   Opponents also say the expansion would displace popular
gathering areas in Swope Park, one of the largest municipal parks
in the country.
   The planners ``didn't sit down with the various neighborhood
residents,'' Thompson said. ``It appears as though we have an
adversarial role, but actually if we were consulted before the
fact, then we wouldn't have come out against the plan the way we
have.''
   Some critics say it's the wrong time to add to city tax bills.
Residents of the school district soon are likely to pay a property
tax increase for teacher salaries. That tax hike has been approved
by a federal judge in the city's school desegregation case and
awaits action by the school board.
   The zoo bonds would add about $10 a year to the average Kansas
City homeowner's property tax bill.
   ``The current zoo is not a distinguished one,'' said Albert P.
Mauro, president of Friends of the Zoo, a non-profit booster group.
``It's just on the border of meeting its regulatory requirements.
It's close to having to spend a lot of money just to stay open.''
   The bond issue would provide the money needed to double the
81-year-old zoo to 160 acres and increase the number of species
from 168 to 263. The plan calls for completing the expansion by
1994.
   New African and Australian exhibits would let several species
interact as they do in their natural habitats. The 90-acre African
section envisions safari-like tram, canoe and Land Rover rides
overlooking forest, grassland and water habitats.
   ``The visitors will suspend their disbelief,'' said Bob
Berkebile, main architect of the master plan. ``They will think
they are in Africa even though they know they are not.''
   Planners want to boost educational functions of the zoo with a
start-to-finish theme of conservation. An entrance pavilion would
acquaint visitors with animals they are about to see. An exit
pavilion would teach viewers what steps humans can take to save
endangered creatures.
   ``Our assumption is, unless we change our actions, we humans
will be the next endangered species,'' Berkebile said. ``We believe
we are immersing the visitor in a complete experience.''

<HEAD>Impact from Iraqi Action Could Be Widespread</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq's conquest of Kuwait is expected to
produce political realignments in much of the Arab world, reinforce
U.S. ties with Israel and threaten the economies of oil-poor
countries far removed from the Persian Gulf, experts say.
   While the full impact of the Iraqi action is difficult to
measure, there was almost unanimous agreement that the events of
this past week probably have made an Arab-Israeli accommodation
more remote than at any time in the past generation.
   They also have raised the possibility at least that two Iraqi
foes in the region, Syria and Iran, could be encouraged to seek
more cooperative relationships with the United States and other
Western countries. Both appear to have few other options.
   Three days after the invasion, the political fallout was
uncertain, partly because no one is quite sure what Iraq meant on
Friday when it said the invading force will be withdrawn beginning
Sunday.
   The main concern in the United States is Saudi Arabia and
whether Iraq, either through force or intimidation, will attempt to
impose its will on that strategic Gulf state. President Bush has
declared Saudi Arabia a ``vital interest'' for the United States
and warned that he would not acquiesce in an Iraqi takeover of the
Kingdom.
   Under some worst case projections, Iraqi domination of the OPEC
oil cartel could shoot prices from the present $24.50 into the
$40-plus range, wreaking havoc in oil importing countries
everywhere, especially the Third World.
   These were the countries which suffered the greatest hardship
from OPEC price increases in the 1970s. Alternatively, Bush has
said that sharp curtailment of supplies would have a ``devastating
effect'' on the free world.
   The Iraqi invasion occurred at a time of widespread complacency
in international relations, an attitude spawned by the success of
the United States and the Soviet Union in easing tensions after
more than 40 years of high stakes rivalry.
   The Brookings Institute's Judith Kipper believes the
Soviet-American accommodation actually enhances the possibility for
regional flareups such as the one in the Gulf.
   ``This is the first post-Cold War crisis,'' she said. ``With the
end of East-West competition, little countries can act with
impunity.''
   While many experts consider Iraqi domination of Arab politics _
especially oil politics _ likely, Leonard Spector of the Carnegie
Endowment believes that outcome can be avoided.
   A combination of economic and military pressure by the West and
by Gulf countries might be enough to tame President Saddam
Hussein's ambitions, Spector said.
   ``Right now he looks unstoppable,'' Spector said. ``He could be
stoppable in 10 days. Each country pursuing its interests
individually could restore the power balance.''
   Saddam would appear to be most vulnerable to a show of Western
military power, widespread international adherence to an embargo of
Iraqi oil, loss of access to oil pipelines through neighboring
Turkey and Saudi Arabia and to Soviet military spare parts.
   The Soviets have been Iraq's main military supplier but
announced a cutoff Thursday after the invasion. Bush said Friday
that the possibility of Turkey closing the Iraqi pipeline ``will be
an option, I'm certain.''
   Without decisive action, Saddam almost certainly will be able to
call the shots in the Gulf.
   ``I think if everybody trembles and fall, then obviously he's
going to move on,'' said Shireen Hunter of the Center for Strategic
and International Studies.
   Gary Sick, a former National Security Council aide, warned that
Saddam, left unchecked, could become the ``ultimate arbiter'' of
OPEC policy, able almost singlehandedly to determine supply and
price levels.
   There was broad agreement among the experts that the Gulf crisis
will have a salutary effect on U.S.-Israeli relations, which had
been suffering as a result of U.S. accusations of Israeli
intransigence concerning the peace process.
   Even before the events of last week in the Gulf, Palestine
Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat had been shifting
allegiances from Egypt to Iraq, a switch that was hardly reassuring
to Israel.
   ``Arafat left America's best friend for America's worst enemy,''
said Barry Rubin of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
Rubin noted that Iraq has been allied for some time with Abul
Abbas, head of a Palestinian faction which claimed responsibility
for an abortive attack on an Israeli beach two months ago.
   Against this background, Rubin said that the PLO is not going to
do what is necessary to resume its dialogue with the United States,
which President Bush suspended six weeks ago.

   When Dennis Ross, a top State Department policy
maker, accepted an invitation to spend a few days at a Soviet dacha
discussing the future of the world, nobody paid much attention.
   It was supposed to be a quiet time, a little vodka and a lot of
talk. Then Iraq invaded Kuwait, and Ross and his Soviet
counterparts helped make history.
   On Friday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze issued a joint statement, prepared
by Ross and Soviet officials, condemning Iraq's invasion and
calling for an international arms embargo on Baghdad.
   For the first time since World War II, the superpowers acted as
allies when confronted with a war. Moscow assented to Washington's
request it cut weapons deliveries to Iraq.
   For the Soviets, the decision to join the Americans was a
difficult one because of decades of close ties with Iraq. Moscow
has a treaty of friendship with Iraq and is its biggest arms
supplier.
   But, as Shevardnadze said during a hastily called news
conference with Baker at a military airbase outside Moscow on
Friday, ``this aggression is inconsistent with the principles of
new political thinking.''
   Perhaps more significantly, State Department officials said the
Soviet Union put no restrictions on any U.S. response to the crisis.
   The genesis of the statement reads like a case study of ``new
political thinking,'' Shevardnadze's buzzword for the changing
relationship between Moscow and Washington.
   American officials who participated in the whirlwind talks,
telephone calls and abruptly changed plans used words such as
``extraordinary'' and ``milestone'' to describe the negotiations
with their longtime foes.
   Here is a day-by-day account of those talks:
   Wednesday _ A half-moon glimmered overhead when Baker stepped
off his Air Force plane in the Soviet city of Irkutsk at 2:30 a.m.
for talks with Shevardnadze.
   The talks in ``the Paris of Siberia'' were expected to focus on
the 12-year-old civil war in Afghanistan and arms control. But in
the first session Baker asked Shevardnadze to pressure Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein to withdraw troops massed on Kuwait's borders.
   Shevardnadze declined.
   Later, the foreign minister, in a remarkable step, admitted the
response had been wrong.
   ``I really did not think at that time that the Iraqis would so
openly engage in aggression against such a defenseless country,''
Shevardnadze said.
   Thursday morning _ Lt. Gen. Howard Graves, an aide accompanying
Baker, tells the secretary that Iraq has invaded Kuwait.
   Baker informs Shevardnadze and requests the Soviets to cease
arms supplies to Iraq.
   Thursday _ At 1:30 p.m. Baker's jet touched down in Ulan Bator,
Mongolia, making him the first top American official to visit this
vast, land-locked nation in 46 years. But events in the Middle East
overshadowed his trip.
   In Moscow, the Soviet Union condemned the invasion and stopped
arms deliveries to Iraq.
   Enter Dennis Ross.
   After the Irkutsk talks with Shevardnadze, Ross went to Moscow
with Shevardnadze's men for what were originally planned as broad
discussions on the next two years.
   In a dacha outside Moscow, the Americans raised the idea with
Soviet officials of a joint statement.
   ``There was a fair amount of discussion about the consequences
of allowing naked aggression to go unchallenged,'' said a senior
State Department official. ``If you allow someone to engage in this
kind of action and get away with it, you're going to invite more.''
   Back in Ulan Bator, Baker gamely watched Mongolian wrestling and
archery competitions, as the crisis unfurled.
   Lt. Gen. Graves kept him posted.
   ``We've got more phone lines out of Mongolia than the
Mongolians,'' Graves quipped as scantily clad Mongolian wrestlers
grappled with each other on a grassy plain outside Ulan Bator.
   At 8 p.m., Baker received a call from President Bush, who was
interested in the joint statement.
   At a banquet that night, Baker toasted Mongolia's moves toward
democracy, then announced he cut short his trip.
   ``It is with a very heavy heart,'' he said. The Texan had
planned a two-day hunting trip on the Gobi Desert.
   In Moscow, Ross and his Soviet colleagues thrashed out details
of the statement. An international arms embargo was agreed on.
State Department officials declined to say whether there were any
disagreements but they said the Soviets did not make Washington
rule out any option against Iraq.
   Friday, 1:45 a.m. _ Bush, flying on Air Force One to Colorado,
called Baker again and approved the statement.
   ``Wake up and get a pencil,'' State Department spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler told one reporter at 3 a.m. ``We're going back to
Moscow.''
   Friday, 7:30 p.m. at Moscow's Vukunovo II military airport _
``This has been a rather unusual meeting,'' Shevardnadze said of
his just concluded talk with Baker.
   Then the two men read the statement, each in his native tongue.

<HEAD>Abu Nidal Follower Killed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SIDON, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two gunmen armed with silencer-equipped
pistols on Saturday killed an official of terrorist mastermind Abu
Nidal's Palestinian faction in a southern Lebanon refugee camp,
police said.
   A police spokesman said the gunmen shot Abdul Fattah Aziz, known
by the code-name Kifah Ghalib, shortly after midnight at the Ein
el-Hilweh refugee camp.
   ``Aziz was hit in the chest and neck. Death was instantaneous,''
said the spokesman, who cannot be named in line with police
regulations.
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri al-Banna, broke away from
Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization in 1973 and set
up the Fatah-Revolutionary Council. It has bases in Iraq, Syria,
Libya and Lebanon.
   Last month Arafat's guerrillas routed Abu Nidal's followers at
the Rashidiyeh refugee camp.
   Five guerrillas allied with Abu Nidal's were killed, 16 wounded
and 40 taken prisoner in the fighting.
   A U.S. State Department report last year described Abu Nidal as
the world's most dangerous terrorist. It blamed his hirelings for
34 terrorist attacks in 20 countries since 1973.
   At least 900 people were killed or wounded in these attacks, the
report said. The atrocities included the December 1985 attacks on
Rome and Vienna airports that killed more than 20 people.
   Nidal's group was torn by a bloody internal feud in late 1989 in
which some 200 dissidents were slain. The group's strength is now
estimated to be less than 100.

<HEAD>House Campaign Finance Bill Survives Vote</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campaign finance reformers are looking to
congressional leaders and the Bush administration to begin serious
negotiations on cleaning up future elections when Congress returns
in September.
   The House kept the issue alive by voting 255-155 late Friday
night for a highly partisan Democratic bill that even many of its
supporters acknowledged privately stands no chance of becoming law.
   President Bush has vowed to veto any bill that imposes absolute
spending ceilings on congressional candidates _ as both the House
and Senate versions do _ and that doesn't curb labor and business
PACs' rapidly escalating role in politics.
   Democrats in the Senate bowed to Bush's call to ban special
interest political action committees entirely even though lawmakers
in both parties acknowledge that the Supreme Court is likely to
rule it an unconstitutional prohibition on free speech.
   House Democrats sought only to curb what they called ``fat cat''
corporate executive PACs, cutting the amount they can contribute to
each candidate for combined primary and November election campaigns
to $2,000 while leaving the current lid of $10,000 on such gifts
for union PACs.
   Although reform groups such as Common Cause had called the House
Democratic bill a ``sham'' and ``fraud,'' they urged lawmakers to
hold their nose and pass it before Congress went on vacation
Saturday to prevent the issue from dying.
   ``It's part of the process that you have to work your way
through to go to the next step of the process,'' said Common Cause
President Fred Wertheimer. ``The House must not block the Senate's
efforts to clean up its own campaign finance system.''
   League of Women Voters President Susan Lederman said the House
version ``is dangerously close to being an incumbent protection
bill rather than a campaign reform bill.''
   ``At least the House action keeps the legislative process
alive,'' she said.
   The House bill would establish a $715,000 ceiling on how much
candidates could spend on their primary and general elections
combined. Originally it would have provided a ceiling of $550,000.
   But the bill's authors modified it Thursday night, weakening
several other provisions in the process, after several disgruntled
Democrats complained privately the original version would have
crippled their re-election bids in 1992.
   Also removed from the package, Republicans said, were criminal
penalties on candidates who overspend the limits and prohibitions
on lobbyists doubling as fundraisers.
   A Republican alternative with no spending ceilings cutting
allowable contributions from special interest political action
committees and banning so-called leadership PACs involved in recent
House ethics scandals was rejected earlier by a 241-169 vote.
   Also rejected, by 128-122, was a proposal by Reps. Mike Synar,
D-Okla., and David Obey, D-Wis., that would have provided up to
$100,000 in public financing matching funds to candidates who raise
an equal amount in contributions of $50 or less from in-state
residents.
   Obey and Synar also would have limited candidates to getting no
more than 40 percent of the proposed ceiling from PACs, compared to
a 50 percent lid on PAC contributions from the Democratic bill by
Rep. Al Swift, D-Wash., that was passed.
   They would have financed the public matching funds by raising
from $1 to $3 the current voluntary checkoff for presidential
elections on individual income tax returns.
   Republicans overwhelmingly voted ``present'' on the amendment,
which had been approved earlier on a voice vote but was brought up
again after Democratic leaders feared it would kill the bill.
   Swift's bill had no public financing but it would allow a 100
percent tax credit up to $50 to encourage small contributions.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq said today it was creating a new
Kuwaiti army to prop up the government it installed in Kuwait. U.S.
reports that Baghdad has massed troops on the Saudi border prompted
fears the invasion could spread.
   On Friday, a government communique read on Baghdad radio had
said Iraqi forces would start withdrawing from Kuwait in two days
``unless something appears that could threaten the security of
Kuwait and Iraq.'' But the White House expressed skepticism that
Iraq would pull out.
   President Saddam Hussein faced mounting international pressure
to withdraw from Kuwait. U.S. warships headed toward the Persian
Gulf, Arab leaders sought a diplomatic solution, and many countries
moved to isolate Iraq economically.
   In other developments:
   _Shipping sources in the Persian Gulf said Iraqi troops today
seized the 20-man American crew of the tanker Sea Wolf docked at
Kuwait's main port, removed the men from the vessel, and took them
to an undisclosed location. But Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit
in London said it could not confirm a U.S. ship had been seized and
did not believe the Sea Wolf was even in the gulf.
   U.S. officials are already seeking information on 14 Americans,
mostly oil workers, missing in Kuwait who apparently were seized by
Iraqi forces to help keep oil installations running. About 3,000
Americans live in Kuwait.
   _Iraqi soldiers took 35 British servicemen acting as advisers to
Kuwaiti forces from their homes in Kuwait on Friday night and early
today, the British Ministry of Defense said in London. Their fate
was not known.
   _Jordanian officials said an emergency Arab summit scheduled in
Saudi Arabia on Sunday to discuss Iraq's invasion was postponed due
to a dispute between Saudi Arabia and Iraq over whether Kuwait
should be represented at the meeting by its ousted rulers, who have
taken refuge in Saudi Arabia.
   _In Rome, the 12 nations of the European Community voted today
to impose a total embargo on imports of oil from Iraq and Kuwait in
response to Baghdad's invasion of its oil-rich neighbor, an Italian
official said.
   _Kuwaiti diplomatic sources who contacted Kuwaiti residents by
telephone, said Iraqi tanks and armor had begun to withdraw from
downtown Kuwait city. No further details were available.
   _There was no indication that Saudi Arabia and Turkey were
prepared to close pipelines in their countries that carry Iraqi oil
to the Red Sea and the Mediterranean. The pipelines constitute
Iraq's major oil export outlets.
   Baghdad radio today broadcast a communique from the
``provisional government of free Kuwait'' announcing creation of an
army that would accept all Arab nationals ``who wish stability for
Kuwait in its new age.''
   Iraqi television said more than 100,000 Iraqis had volunteered
to serve.
   The U.S. State Department said parts of the Iraqi invasion force
had pushed to within five to 10 miles of the southern Kuwaiti
border with Saudi Arabia.
   The possibility of an Iraqi thrust into Saudi Arabia worried
members of Congress. Lawmakers attending secret briefings on the
crisis said 120,000 Iraqi troops massed along their southern border
could easily attack the Saudis next.
   But a high-ranking Saudi official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said today that no Iraqi troops had entered Saudi Arabia.
   President Bush on Friday warned Iraq that attacking Saudi
Arabia, with the world's largest oil reserves, would be attacking
American ``vital interests.''
   Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council led by Saddam said it
planned to begin a withdrawal Sunday, but not in reaction to Arab
or superpower demands.
   ``We refuse to respond to empty chatter,'' the ruling council
said in a statement on official Baghdad radio. An Iraqi government
spokesman warned that if anyone took action against Iraqi forces,
Iraq would ``chop off his arm from the shoulder.''
   Iraq did not say how many of the estimated 100,000 troops it
originally sent into Kuwait would pull back or how long the
withdrawal would take, leaving the door open for Saddam to keep
forces in Kuwait for some time, according to Persian Gulf-based
diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Telephone communications to Kuwait were partly restored today. A
woman at Kuwait University was reached by her family in Bahrain and
they quoted her as saying ``the situation is very quiet, almost
eerie, and tense.''
   In Kuwait City, guns were silent today, and residents could
determine little about what was going on.
   Iraqi soldiers were stopping cars and ``politely'' asking people
to step out so they could check them, the woman told her family.
   The Iraqi government on Friday issued a separate statement
denying that its troops made incursions into Saudi Arabia. But
residents of the Saudi border city of Khafji, reached by telephone
from Bahrain, said Iraqi troops had laid down a checkpoint less
than a mile from the frontier.
   A NATO source said the United States had ``contingency plans''
in case Iraq thrust further into the strategic region. He did not
say what those plans were.
   The United States will send a third aircraft carrier with 15,000
personnel toward the Middle East next week to bolster its naval
armada in the Persian Gulf, Pentagon officials said Friday.
   A second carrier was on its way Thursday. The ships will back up
the Navy's task force of eight warships already stationed inside
the gulf.
   The Soviet Union and United States issued a rare joint statement
in Moscow demanding that all countries stop arms supplies to Iraq
and that Baghdad withdraw from Kuwait immediately.
   The Soviet Union, Iraq's main weapons supplier, cut off
shipments Thursday, while the United States froze Iraqi and Kuwaiti
assets on the same day. France, Italy, Poland, Britain and other
countries also imposed sanctions against Iraq.
   In Cairo, an emergency Arab League Council meeting on Friday
strongly condemned the invasion, demanded the immediate withdrawal
of Iraqi troops and rejected any foreign intervention.
   Driven by fears of a production drop, oil prices continued to
climb. North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded international
crude, rose $2 a barrel Thursday and 86 cents more on Friday to
close at $23.25.
   Last month, oil prices were as low as $16 a barrel.
   Iraq's invasion followed two weeks of threats and accusations
against its small Persian Gulf neighbor. On July 17 Saddam accused
it of stealing oil from a field that straddles their disputed
border. He also blamed Kuwait for a fall in oil prices that cost
Iraq $14 billion, saying it contributed to the oil glut by cheating
on its OPEC oil cartel production quotas.

<HEAD>Drugs Blamed For Violent End to Violent Decade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation capped a violent decade with 21,500
homicides last year, the FBI reported Saturday, and experts blamed
drugs.
   The nation's capital remained the killing capital for a second
year, with 434 murders and other non-negligent homicides, according
to the FBI's compilation of crime reports from around the country.
   That gave the District of Columbia a rate of 72 slayings per
100,000 people, compared with the national rate of 8.7 per 100,000.
The national rate represented a 3.6 percent increase over 1988.
   Detroit and Atlanta again occupied second and third place for
homicides, the positions they held in 1988. Atlanta, however, had
the highest overall crime rate for the second straight year.
   Criminologists blame drug trafficking for the rise in murders
and assaults that helped make 1989 the most violent year of the
decade. Forcible rapes also rose over the decade _ by 3.5 percent _
although experts say the increase may be due to more such crimes
being reported.
   ``The drug trade is driving the violence,'' said Richard
Bennett, a professor of justice at Washington's American
University. ``Things such as bad debts, territorial disputes.
That's what driving a lot of our assaults and homicides.''
   Noted Dr. Alfred Blumstein, dean of the School of Urban and
Public Affairs at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh:
``Middle class folks take each other to court. That's not the way
... to resolve issues for people whose disputes are over illegal
activities, like drug dealers. You can't tell the judge, `This guy
is invading my corner.' It won't work.''
   Detroit's 624 killings gave it a homicide rate of 60 per
100,000. Atlanta, with 246 killings, had a rate of 57.7 per 100,000.
   The homicide rate was actually higher at the opening of the
decade. The FBI said 10.2 people per 100,000 died of violent crimes
in 1980. But the overall violent crime rate reached a record high
in 1989, exceeding the 1980 level by 11.1 percent. Among those
violent crimes was forcible rape, which rose 3.5 percent in the
decade.
   Atlanta led all major cities, those with 400,000 or more
population, when all crimes surveyed by the FBI in its Uniform
Crime Reports are considered: homicide, forcible rape, robbery,
aggravated assault, burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft
and arson.
   The overall crime rate in Atlanta last year was 207.6 per 1,000
population, an increase over the 176.2 crimes for 1988. Dallas
moved from third place in 1988 to second with 168.5 crimes per
1,000 population, swapping places with its Texas neighbor, Fort
Worth, which had 157.8 crimes per 1,000 population.
   The rate of violent crime in general _ 663.1 incidents per
100,000 population _ increased 4.1 percent from 1988 to 1989.
   During the year, the biggest increase during the year was
robbery, where the rate hiked 5.5 percent to 233 robberies per
100,000 population. The rate of forcible rape increased 1.3 percent
to 38.1 rapes per 100,000. Aggravated assault went up 3.6 percent
to 383.4 attacks per 100,000.
   Although there were more property crimes than in 1980, the rate
was 5.1 percent lower than at the start of the decade. The 1989
rate was 5,077.9 incidents per 100,000 population.
   The rate of motor vehicle theft has jumped by 25.5 percent over
the decade to hit 630.4 incidents per 100,000 population. The rate
of burglary has plummeted by 24.2 percent to 1,276.3 incidents per
100,000. The rate of larceny-theft has remained virtually constant
between 1980 and 1989, increasing only 0.1 percent over the decade.
   Firearms were used in 62 percent of 1989's killings, compared
with 59 percent in 1985. The most popular firearm remained the
handgun, which was used in 47.5 percent of the killings last year,
compared with 43 percent in 1985.
   The Uniform Crime Reports compile information submitted by about
16,000 law enforcement agencies nationwide representing about 96
percent of the U.S. population. The FBI extrapolates from that
information to provide totals for the entire country.

   The family of a businessman killed when an
Air Force jet crashed into a motel has been awarded $3.68 million.
   Flora Murray, wife of Thomas C. Murray, sued the federal
government last year in a wrongful death complaint that blamed
pilot error and government negligence for the crash Oct. 20, 1987.
   Mrs. Murray's attorney, John Townsend, said the settlement
awarded Friday by U.S. District Judge Larry J. McKinney was ``a
very substantial, reasonable award.''
   The Air Force has not said if it will appeal the award.
   Murray of suburban Carmel had stopped to use a telephone in the
Ramada Inn Airport when the crippled fighter jet crashed into the
lobby. Nine others also were killed.
   The jet crashed after it lost power, and pilot Maj. Bruce L.
Teagarden lost control as he attempted to make an emergency landing
at Indianapolis International Airport. The pilot ejected safely
moments before the jet slammed into the hotel.
   Murray, 37, the father of four children, was a regional sales
manager for Haynes International Inc., a metal products company in
Kokomo.

   President Bush said today the use of U.S.
military force remains an option in trying to compel Iraq to
withdraw its troops from Kuwait and restore the Kuwaiti monarchy to
power.
   After meeting with top aides for two hours, Bush disclosed that
the governments of Japan, France and West Germany had joined the
United States in freezing Kuwaiti assets to prevent their seizure
by Iraq.
   ``We continue to seek the immediate, complete and unconditional
withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait and restoration of the
legitimate government of Kuwait,'' White House press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater said in a statement. ``As we have stated before,
all U.S. options are under consideration.''
   The statement, issued after Bush's meeting with aides at Camp
David, Md., made no mention of any Iraqi threat to Saudi Arabia.
Reports today from the Middle East said replenished Iraqi invasion
forces had advanced south toward the Saudi border.
   The White House said it has no information on missing Americans
in Kuwait. Sources in the Persian Gulf said today that 20 Americans
had been seized from a U.S. oil tanker in a Kuwaiti port, and that
other foreigners had been detained in Kuwait.
   Also, 14 American oil workers in Kuwait have been reported
missing. The State Department said Friday it believed the 14 were
being held by Iraqi forces.
   Fitzwater's statement also welcomed the decision today of the
12-nation European Community to freeze Iraqi assets, ban imports of
Iraqi oil and halt arms sales to Iraq.
   Bush met at Camp David with Vice President Dan Quayle, Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney, Secretary of State James Baker III, CIA
Director William Webster, and senior military officials.
   Fitzwater said Bush would continue to monitor the Middle East
situation and would meet with Brent Scowcroft, his national
security adviser, and other aides on Sunday evening at the White
House.
   On Friday, Bush had reached out to leaders in the Arab world and
beyond to pressure Iraq to withdraw its invasion army from oil-rich
Kuwait and pointedly warned that Saudi Arabia's freedom is ``very,
very important to the United States.''
   The White House on Friday was skeptical of Badhdad's
announcement that Iraqi troops would be withdrawn from Kuwait on a
timetable beginning Sunday. The Iraqi government added, however,
that the Al-Sabah royal family that ruled Kuwait for almost 250
years ``is finished forever and will never come back.''
   ``We need to wait and see,'' said presidential Press Secretary
Marlin Fitzwater. ``We asked for immediate and unconditional
withdrawal. If there are strings, we need to see what they are.''
   Bush himself said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein should ``haul
them out right now.''
   Bush said he planned to stay in touch by telephone with world
leaders over the weekend to try to tighten international sanctions
against Iraq.
   In Moscow, Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
jointly called upon all countries to cut off arms supplies to Iraq.
The Soviets have been Baghdad's biggest arms supplier.
   Asked about the possibility that Saddam might next invade
oil-rich Saudi Arabia, which borders Kuwait, Bush said: ``I'm not
discussing options, but I would simply say the status quo is
unacceptable, and further expansion would be even more
unacceptable.''
   Pressed on whether he was committed to defending the Saudis, who
ship 1.2 million barrels of oil to this country daily, the
president said, ``When you look at vital interests of the United
States, the relationship with Saudi Arabia and its independence and
its freedom come under the heading of very, very important.''
   If the Saudis ask for assistance, ``I would be inclined to help
in any way we possibly can,'' he added.
   The White House said Americans could expect to pay 7 to 8 cents
more per gallon at the gasoline pump from a $3-per-barrel jump in
the price of oil.
   Bush said there is a surplus of crude oil now, but ``long-run
economic effects on the free world could be devastating'' if
supplies are curtailed.
   The State Department said Iraqi troops, hardened by eight years
of war with Iran, were positioned five to 10 miles from the Saudi
border.
   The chairman of the House Armed Service Committee, Rep. Les
Aspin, D-Wis., said bluntly, ``I think it means war'' if Iraq
expands its invasion. ``The world cannot sit back and watch a
person like Saddam Hussein take over half of the oil reserves in
the world.''
   The Pentagon said a third aircraft carrier was being readied to
head to the Mideast to bolster U.S. forces already scattered
outside the Persian Gulf. Officials said the USS Saratoga would
relieve the USS Eisenhower, which was sent to the region in March.
   The carrier Independence already is headed from the Indian Ocean
toward the Persian Gulf to strengthen the eight-ship U.S. Navy
presence there.
   With tensions rising, the State Department advised the 3,000
Americans in Kuwait and the 500 in Iraq to leave as quickly as
possible. Airports and ports were closed in Kuwait, however.
   Fitzwater said Iraqi troops have been stationed around the U.S.
Embassy in Kuwait city, ``but they have not gone inside. There is
no indication they intend to do that.''
   The administration said 14 American oil workers were known
missing and believed to be in Iraqi hands. The United States
demanded that they be accounted for and freed, Fitzwater said.
   A State Department official said today the administration is
aware of reports that Iraqi military forces took some Americans
into custody at Rumaliah oil field.
   The official was unable to confirm news reports about their
release.
   The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Thomas Pickering, was
in New York discussing what pressure the U.N. can bring against
Iraq. Fitzwater noted that the U.N. charter allows members to
impose a military blockade on a renegade state.
   The spokesman said Iraq had ignored international calls for
withdrawal. ``At this point we have received only scorn from
Iraq,'' he said.
   Iraq began jamming short-wave broadcasts from the Voice of
America late Friday, said Richard Carlson, director of the
government radio network.
   Two of the six frequencies carrying Arabic-language broadcasts
to the Middle East were jammed, but weaker Arabic signals and
English-language broadcasts were not affected, he said.
   NATO sources in Brussels said, meantime, that the United States
alerted Western allies that it was prepared to respond should Iraqi
troops push beyond Kuwaiti territory.
   ``We have told them that we don't rule out any military option
and that everything is under consideration,'' Fitzwater said. ``We
are considering all options.''
   Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States, Prince Bandar,
met at the White House with Scowcroft, the national security
adviser.
   Bush said he talked by telephone with Turkish President Turgut
Ozal, whose country is a conduit for much of the oil flowing from
Iraq. He said he and Ozal ``look at this matter with the same sense
or urgency and concern.''
   Asked if the Turks would close the Iraqi pipeline, Bush replied,
``That will be an option, I'm certain.''

   Financial disclosure forms for this year's
House and Senate races show few exceptions to the rule that
incumbents have the edge in fund raising, according to a Federal
Election Commission analysis released Saturday.
   Candidates raised $279 million and spent $192 million from
January 1989 through the end of June, the analysis says. The
candidates still in this year's races reported having $158.8
million available to spend for the November elections.
   The data confirm the overwhelming advantage of incumbents,
particularly in receiving donations from special-interest political
action committees. Proposals to significantly restrict or even
prohibit PAC donations and other incentives designed to level the
playing field for challengers are included in campaign-finance
overhaul plans now before Congress.
   Overall, when races for open seats are excluded, four of every
five dollars donated to congressional candidates went to incumbents.
   The 441 incumbents seeking re-election to House or Senate seats
reported raising a total of $196 million in the 18-month period
covered by the study, with $74 million of that total coming from
PACs. Including primary races there were nearly twice as many
challengers _ 793 _ but they raised just $46 million, with $6. 3
million coming from PACs. The total of challenger loans to their
own campaigns eclipsed their overall PAC receipts by more than $1
million.
   But challengers have matched or even surpassed incumbents in
raising money in a dozen races, some of them this year's hottest
contests.
   In Oregon, for example, Democratic challenger Mike Kopetski is
essentially even with incumbent Republican Rep. Denny Smith in a
race considered a toss-up. And in California, actor Ralph Waite,
running as a Democrat, reported raising $235,000 as of June 30,
more than twice the total raised by incumbent Republican Rep.
Alfred McCandless.
   Two Virginia races have challengers beating their opponents at
fund-raising. Democrat James Moran, mayor of the Washington suburb
of Alexandria, reported a slight edge over incumbent Republican
Stan Parris. Republican Rep. Frank Wolf is expected to keep his
seat but is being beaten at the fund-raising game by Lyndon
LaRouche, the perennial fringe presidential candidate who is
running despite being in a federal prison for a fraud conviction.
   In Senate races, where six-year terms give plenty of time to
raise money, incumbents enjoy huge fund-raising edges.
   The king of Senate fund-raising is Republican Phil Gramm of
Texas, who raised $8.9 million from January 1989 through June
alone, and as of June 30 reported $6.2 million in the bank.
Democratic challenger Hugh Parmer had raised $1.4 million over the
18 months but had just $20,500 left to enter the final months of
the campaign.
   Not far behind Gramm was New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bill
Bradley, who is considered a possible presidential candidate in
1992. Bradley raised $6.7 million over the 18-month period and had
$4.3 million in the bank at the end of June. Republican challenger
Christine Todd Whitman raised $228,000 and had less than $75,000 on
hand.
   On the House side, members of the Democratic leadership have the
biggest advantage.
   For example, Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, the House majority
leader and another potential 1992 presidential candidate, raised
nearly $1 million over the 18-month period. His Republican
challenger, Malcolm Holekamp, collected just $18,436.

   Nearly half the states have seen no real
growth in revenues this year, indicating they are in recession or
close to it, a study of state finances said Saturday.
   The impact was cushioned by a big round of tax increases last
year, and even more are likely next year, the author of the study
said.
   ``The pressure is building on states to raise taxes next year,''
said Steven D. Gold, director for the Center for the Study of the
States at the Nelson Rockefeller Institute of Government at Albany,
N.Y.
   ``If you see a state that has lower revenue this year than last
year, you know they're under tremendous pressure and there's a good
bet they'll have to raise taxes next year,'' he said.
   The report was issued by the center, which is part of the State
University of New York at Albany.
   It said that in a survey of revenue collections in 43 states, 23
reported total tax revenue increases equal to or below the
inflation rate _ meaning no increases after adjustment for
inflation.
   The figure was in line with a Labor Department report Friday
showing unemployment shot up to 5.5 percent last month and the
economy grew by just 1.2 percent in the second quarter, below the
level needed to create new jobs.
   Orders to factories for manufactured goods fell 1.5 percent in
June, the third drop this year, a sign layoffs and cutbacks could
be coming.
   Construction spending was unchanged in June after being down two
straight months and the government's Index of Leading Economic
Indicators, weak most of the year, showed no strength at all.
   The conclusion that many state economies are in or near
recession is consistent with a report from the National Governors'
Association and the National Association of State Budget Officers
in April that states were in worse financial condition than a year
ago.
   The fresh study said corporate income tax collections were the
weakest component of the state revenue picture, with a 6.7 percent
decline, reflecting a drop in earnings.
   The two other principal revenue sources, the sales tax and
personal income tax, posted overall gains of 6.6 percent and 7
percent respectively.
   Those three taxes account for more than 70 percent of state
collections. In most states the revenue figures were for the 12
months ending in June.
   Weak state economies were found in all regions of the country,
but New England and Mid-Atlantic states were in the worst shape,
the report said.
   In five states, revenue was lower than in the corresponding
period a year earlier: Massachusetts, Maine, Michigan, New
Hampshire and New York.
   Eighteen other states had increases of less than 5 percent, the
approximate rate of inflation used in the report.
   They were: Rhode Island, Vermont, Maryland, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Alabama, Florida,
Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, New Mexico,
Colorado and Oregon.
   Only eight states had revenue increases of 10 percent or more:
Illinois, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, West Virginia, Idaho,
Wyoming and Nevada.
   Tax increases enacted since last year have helped boost revenue
in several of those states, including Illinois, Georgia and West
Virginia.
   ``Things are even worse than they look when you consider the
fact states raised taxes quite a bit last year,'' Gold said in an
interview. ``If those tax increases hadn't occurred, the decline in
revenues would be even lower.''
   Thirty states raised taxes last year, about the same number as
this year. Twelve of the 1989 increases were large, involving
either income or sales taxes.
   Gold said last year's tax increases totaled about $5 billion,
with $3 billion taking effect this year. That should have been
enough to increase the overall revenue figure by about 1.5 percent,
he said.
   Three states reported decreases in personal income tax
collections: Hawaii, which cut its rates, and Michigan and New
York. But 10 others had increases below the inflation rate.
   Maine and Massachusetts reported lower sales tax revenues, and
19 others had increases of 5 percent or less.
   Seven states did not provide figures for the study: Alaska,
Delaware, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and
Wisconsin. The report said several of those states are known to
have strong revenue growth _ North Dakota, Utah and Washington.

   Reverberations of the gunfire in the
Persian Gulf are being felt by many U.S. farmers, who are facing
yet another trade embargo after a foreign invasion.
   Iraq's attack on Kuwait prompted President Bush to order
economic sanctions that ended sales of U.S. commodities such as
wheat, rice and tobacco to the Middle Eastern nation.
   Moreover, disruption of oil supplies from the warring countries
has caused the costs of fuel to run tractors and for
petroleum-based fertilizers to climb higher. So farmers' costs
could be going up at the same time the embargo depresses prices.
   Paul Drazek, international trade specialist for the American
Farm Bureau Federation in Washington, said the loss of sales to
Iraq and Kuwait would be small, compared with total U.S. farm
exports.
   ``It's not a big chunk of the action but it will have some
impact on producers. In agriculture, even a small amount can have
an impact on prices,'' Drazek said.
   The U.S. Agriculture Department estimated agricultural sales to
Iraq in 1989 at $720 million, out of total farm exports of $40
billion _ or 1.8 percent. Sales were even smaller to Kuwait.
   Still, Drazek and others said they feared the administration's
sanctions would be costly to American farmers.
   ``The worst thing to do is single out agriculture. You're
signaling the world that you're using food as a weapon,'' he said.
``We're saying we support the president's action as long as it is
across the board and not singling out agriculture.''
   Wheat growers said they hoped the economic sanctions do not
bring about a repeat of President Jimmy Carter's embargo in 1980
that cut off sales to the Soviet Union after that country's
invasion of Afghanistan.
   ``Sanctions operations, particularly related to food products,
usually don't work very well,'' said Nelson Denlinger, executive
vice president of U.S. Wheat Associates, a Washington, D.C.,
cooperative organization that represents wheat producers.
   ``As with the Afghan invasion, you'll find that commodities of
that sort are replaceable,'' he said. ``You usually will find
somebody, somewhere, who will sell you something. Food is not a
good weapon for changing another country's behavior.''
   ``It's a never-ending challenge to figure out what kind of
rhubarb is going to happen next that will affect the ability to
market wheat,'' said John Oades of U.S. Wheat Associates office at
Portland, Ore. ``It's a very politically vulnerable commodity.''
   Middle Eastern oil is another politically sensitive commodity,
said Carl Schwensen, executive vice president of the National
Association of Wheat Growers in Washington, D.C.
   ``We're removing a significant source of petroleum imports from
our consumption picture,'' he said. ``As prices increase, that will
flow through to the farmer as higher fuel, chemical and fertilizer
costs.''
   The increasing petroleum costs come at a time when the price of
a bushel of wheat is falling because of a large crop of 2.7 million
bushels, up 700,000 bushels from last year, Schwensen and others
said.
   In July, the average farm price for wheat was $2.81 a bushel,
down from $3.78 during the same month a year ago.
   Iraq last year bought 1.3 million tons of wheat from the United
States.
   Other agricultural commodities also get pinched by the embargo.
   Iraq has been the U.S. rice market's largest customer,
accounting for as much as one-fourth of U.S. exports.
   Almost all of the exports to Iraq _ about 350,000 to 450,000
tons a year _ is long-grain rice grown in Arkansas, Louisiana,
Texas and Mississippi.
   ``I think it will cause less sales for Arkansas rice, which in
effect will hurt our economy and hurt our farmers,'' said John
Tull, a Lonoke, Ark., rice farmer. ``And I think that next year we
will probably have to have a reduction in rice acres.''
   ``Our farmers are seriously affected, and we would hope that
agriculture and rice would be treated in a separate way from
political things,'' said Jim Willis, vice president for foreign
market development at the Houston-based Council for Market
Development.
   Earlier this year, the Bush administration decided not to extend
to Iraq additional credit guarantees. Iraq had purchased U.S. rice
through the use of about $1 billion a year in government credit
guarantees.
   Iraq is an importer of U.S. tobacco products, said Britt Cobb,
an assistant director of marketing for the North Carolina
Department of Agriculture. Iraq in 1988 imported $21 million of
American tobacco, he said.
   California agriculture exports to Iraq totaled a little less
than $4.4 million in 1989, a little more than 1 percent of the
state's total food and fiber exports, according to statistics
compiled by California State World Export Commission. Cotton and
livestock comprise the bulk of that total.
   Chicken growers also will feel the impact of the invasion, said
Tommy Irvin, Commissioner of Agriculture for Georgia, a major
exporter.
   During the first four months of 1990, the United States sold
more than $3 million worth of pieces of chicken, 900 metric tons,
to Kuwait and about 106 metric tons of whole chicken valued at
$130,000, Irvin said.

<HEAD>European Community Imposes Oil Embargo on Iraq, Kuwait</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community on Saturday imposed an
embargo on oil imports from Iraq and Kuwait as part of a series of
tough sanctions aimed at ``striking at the heart'' of Iraqi
economic and military interests.
   The action, described as the strongest punitive measures ever
taken by the the 12-nation EC, was aimed at forcing Iraq to
immediately, unconditionally withdraw its invading forces from
neighboring Kuwait.
   ``We will not be satisfied until there is not a single Iraqi
soldier in Kuwait and until there is a legitimate and sovereign
government in Kuwait,'' a spokesman for the Italian Foreign
Ministry, Giovanni Castellaneta, said.
   The measures were announced after a three-hour meeting of senior
EC foreign ministry officials. Italy, which holds the rotating EC
presidency, convened the emergency meeting to forge a joint
response to the Iraqi invasion Thursday.
   In addition to the oil embargo, the 12 nations agreed to freeze
Iraqi assets, halt arms sales to Iraq, and suspend all cooperation
with Baghdad in the military, technical and scientific fields. They
also decided to suspend Iraq's trade preference status.
   The Europeans are also seeking to protect Kuwaiti assets in
their countries and deny Iraq financial benefit from its military
action, which the officials condemned as a ``brutal invasion.''
   Several of the EC nations _ whose members include France, West
Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark, Greece,
Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom _ had earlier
announced separate moves to freeze Kuwaiti assets and halt arms
sales to Iraq.
   The most punishing sanction is the embargo on Iraqi and Kuwaiti
oil.
   Last year oil from the two countries accounted for 10.9 percent
of the EC's total oil imports. At the same time, Iraq is almost
totally dependent on oil for its export earnings.
   ``This will strike at the heart of Iraq,'' Castellaneta said.
   The oil embargo was formally proposed by France, but the Italian
official said all other countries were in unanimous agreement. The
embargo could hurt some of the EC members, such as Denmark, which
depends on Iraq and Kuwait for more than 50 percent of its oil.
   Italian officials called the sanctions the toughest taken
against Iraq by any countries other than the United States and said
they hoped other nations and organizations would follow suit,
especially the U.N. Security Council.
   The United States has also imposed an embargo on Iraqi oil,
included in a decree issued Thursday that blocked all imports from
Iraq and froze Kuwaiti and Iraqi assets in the United States. Iraqi
oil had represented 7.5 percent of U.S. oil imports, according to
the lastest industry figures this year.
   Ferdinando Nelli, the Italian official in charge of European
political affairs, said the oil embargo marked ``without a doubt''
the strongest economic sanctions ever imposed by the EC.
   He described the sanctions as a near-total commercial embargo on
Iraq.
   The strength of the measures and unanimity were in marked
contrast to past crises, when the EC members have been divided over
whether to impose sanctions and how strong they should be.
   During the U.S. hostage-taking in Iran, for example, trade
sanctions imposed by the EC fell short of U.S. expectations. There
have also been differences among the member nations on policy
toward Libya.
   Italian officials said the EC members did not discuss the
possibility of joint military intervention in the Persian Gulf,
saying such a step would be taken only in concert with the United
Nations.
   The 12 did not cut diplomatic relations or withdraw their
ambassadors from Iraq because that would make it impractical to
defend their citizens in the area, Castellaneta said.
   In a written statement, the countries described as ``groundless
and unacceptable'' Iraq's justification for the military action.
Iraq claimed it invaded after rebels overthrew Kuwait's government.
   The EC nations said they would do everthing they could to avoid
an implicit recognition of the so-called provisional government
Iraq installed in Kuwait.
   The statement said the EC was ready to take part in any effort
to defuse the crisis and was in close contact with several Arab
governments.
   Castellaneta said Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis
had received a message from Secretary of State James A. Baker III
explaining the American position on the Gulf crisis.
   The spokesman said Italy and the United States have ``identical
viewpoints'' on the need for strong measures to force an Iraqi
withdrawal.

   An 11-year-old who publishes an
environmental newsletter says he is more concerned about the
economy now that MasterCard has issued him a gold card with a

   Tommy Mullaney filled out the application before he went to
summer camp, stating his birthday, Nov. 10, 1978; occupation,
student and publisher; and income _ $5 a week allowance. The card
was waiting for him in the mail when he returned last month.
   ``I jumped up and down and said `Wow!' The hologram on it was

running the bank.''
   Tommy's mother, Mary, said she allowed her son to fill out the

it would be taken seriously. She immediately canceled the card.
   Loraine Person of First National Bank said the bank made a
mistake in issuing the card, but it does not know how it happened.
   In addition to school and collecting baseball cards, Tommy
publishes Pollution Solution, a bimonthly newsletter. The

<HEAD>Magazine: Dozens of German Companies Helped Iraq With Weapons</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A magazine alleged Saturday that
dozens of West German companies have helped Iraq build rockets and
chemical weapons, and assisted Baghdad acquire ``military nuclear
technology.''
   According to Hamburg-based Der Spiegel, more than 100 West
German companies are suspected of having helped Iraq build its
military might in recent years.
   ``German companies have helped Iraq with the development of
military nuclear technology, construction of rockets and production
of poison gases,'' the magazine said, without elaborating.
   In a telex to news media, the magazine said the Iraqis in the
past few days finished building a cannon factory with the help of
West German companies.
   They also helped Iraq buld an artillery shell factory that has
already begun production, the magazine reported.
   The magazine's telex did not name any of the companies allegedly
involved, or say how the information was obtained.
   The report will appear in the magazine's latest edition, which
appears on newsstands Monday.
   There have been several allegations in the past two years of
German involvement in weapons-producing efforts in many countries,
including Libya, Iraq, Pakistan and India.
   One of the most famous cases involved West German help in
building Libya's alleged chemical weapons plant at Rabta. On June
27 industrialist Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen was convicted of
violating export laws and of tax evasion.
   Imhausen admitted playing a major role in helping build the
Libyan chemical complex and was sentenced to five years in prison.

<HEAD>Congressional Study: DNA Tests Valid Court Evidence If Done
Properly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   DNA testing, a way to identify people or
parentage using the body's genetic code, is reliable courtroom
evidence, but national standards for the tests are needed, the
Office of Technology Assessment said Saturday.
   The OTA, which evaluates technical subjects for the Congress,
said that DNA testing first was introduced into the courtroom in
1986 and already has been used in more than 2,000 criminal
investigations in 49 states and presented as evidence in more than
185 court cases.
   Law enforcement agencies, particularly the FBI, want to
establish a data bank of DNA markers, similar to the national files
of fingerprints, to help in the investigation of crimes. But the
OTA said that such files could pose a threat to basic civil
liberties.
   In a report, the OTA said that the principles of DNA
identification ``are solid'' and that ``forensic uses of DNA tests
are both reliable and valid when properly performed and analyzed by
skilled personnel.''
   Evidence from DNA patterns have been used to convict murders,
rapists and other criminals. It also has been used to determine
parentage and to identify bodies. Innocent men have been freed by
DNA testing and police have used the technology to guide their
evaluation of suspects.
   Validity of DNA testing has become so widely accepted, the OTA
said, that ``no state court has found that DNA testing per se fails
to meet established tests for admissibility'' although some courts
have limited or barred its use in specific cases.
   DNA, shorthand for deoxyribonucleic acid, is the protein
molecule that contains the genetic pattern for each individual.
Except for red blood cells, DNA is present in every cell of the
body. Every human has a unique DNA pattern, with the exception of
identical twins who share the same genetic structure.
   Thus, police who recover bodily fluids or tissue from a crime
scene can use DNA from those specimens to connect suspects with the
crime.
   DNA patterns can be extracted from recovered specimens of blood,
semen, body tissue, bone, hair roots, saliva, urine or the pulp of
a tooth. These patterns can then be compared to patterns found in
blood or other specimens taken from the suspects.
   The OTA said the major difficulty with DNA identification is the
assurance that uniform standards are followed in conducting the
tricky laboratory procedures in conducting the tests.
   ``Instituting quality assurance mechanisms should proceed
without delay,'' the OTA said. It called for a standardization that
would assure that tests are conducted and interpreted the same way
in each jurisdiction.
   Widespread use of DNA testing, the report said, could be a
significant weapon in fighting crime.
   ``DNA testing can save law enforcement and courts time and money
by exonerating innocent suspects before trial, or through plea
bargaining for guilty parties as increasingly defendants are
confronted with DNA typing results,'' the study said.
   The OTA said that society should prepare for the use of computer
data banks for the storage of DNA identification tests. It said
that 16 states and one county already have authorized or considered
creating DNA files for known offenders. And the FBI is developing a
system to store DNA profiles for investigative uses.
   ``Centralized or linked databases containing DNA profiles would
permit rapid, electronic comparison of results from tests on
different samples within a laboratory and among laboratories
nationwide,'' the report said.
   DNA files kept of convicted offenders, for instance, ``could be
used to analyze whether evidence found at a crime scene matched a
profile in the database, and thus provide police with a lead toward
identifying a suspect,'' the report said.
   The report said that computer files of convicted offenders would
be particularly helpful in investigating rape cases since released
rapists are 10.5 times more likely than other offenders to be
rearrested for rape. The files also would aid police in
investigating serial crimes because it would enable them to link
individual cases more quickly.
   Creating such a computer data, however, the OTA predicted, will
``evoke several concerns about privacy.''
   ``Because DNA is specific to an individual and so highly
personal, some are reluctant to see any DNA test results become
part of a de facto national database,'' it said.
   Many states now are hiring private laboratories to conduct DNA
testing and to provide expert witnesses when the evidence is used
in court. The OTA said there were three major companies providing
the service, Cellmark, Forensic Science Associates and Lifecodes.
Pricing systems vary with costs ranging from $325 per test to
$1,500 for a case. Cost of expert witnesses range from $100 an hour
to $1,000 a day, the report said.
   The report said that Congress could play a role in the
development of DNA testing by establishing standards and funding
laboratories or training for personnel. But the OTA said Congress
also will have to consider whether to establish national computer
databanks of DNA information and wrestle with the concerns about
privacy and civil rights in collecting and storing DNA profiles.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition Social Democrats and
their East German counterparts pledged Saturday to block a plan to
hold all-German elections seven weeks earlier than planned.
   In East Germany, Social Democrats threatened to pull out of
Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere's fragile coalition government
over his proposal to hold elections for a single German parliament
Oct. 14 rather than Dec. 2.
   Peter Kauffold, a leading member of the East German Social
Democrats, said the party's parliamentary faction plans to discuss
leaving the government Tuesday, West Berlin's Berliner Morgenpost
newspaper reported.
   Social Democrats in both Germanys charged that the call for
earlier elections was an attempt to rig the outcome of the
all-German vote in favor of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the leader of
the Christian Democrat Party.
   The Social Democrats claim Kohl and his East German ally de
Maiziere are calling for October elections out of fear that voters
will turn against them as East Germany's economy worsens.
   Hans-Jochen Vogel, head of the West German Social Democrats,
warned against any ``election manipulation''
   Anke Fuchs, a leading Social Democratic lawmaker in West
Germany, vowed ``All-German elections will not occur on Oct. 14.''
   However, the campaign manager for Kohl's likely challenger
Social Democrat leader Oskar Lafontaine, indicated the party would
consider the idea.
   ``We are ready to have a discussion,'' Reinhard Klimmt was
quoted as saying in this week's edition of the West German
magazine, Der Spiegel. The magazine made Klimmt's comments
available in advance of publication.
   Friedrich Bohl, parliamentary business chief for the West German
Christian Democrats, said the Social Democrats have to seriously
ask themselves whether ``they want to postpone unity and all-German
elections ... in this historical hour.''
   Karl-Heinz Hornhues, deputy leader of the West German Christian
Democrat parliamentary faction, appealed to ``the reasonable
majority'' of Social Democrats to support the push for the earlier
election date.
   Kohl maintains that holding the elections Oct. 14 corresponds to
``the wishes of the people'' in both Germanys. All political
parties had earlier agreed to the Dec. 2 date.
   The all-German vote would fuse the two countries under one
government.

<HEAD>Red Cross Hungry For Funds But Slow To Respond, Study Finds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Red Cross, the nation's biggest charity,
often takes days to respond to disasters, has conflicts with other
relief organizations and overstates its accomplishments, according
to a newspaper report.
   A nine-month investigation by The Pittsburgh Press that examined
emergency responses to more than 200 disasters, including every
major one in the past five years, showed that, in some cases, the
Red Cross lived up to its promise to deliver help quickly, fairly
and compassionately.
   But in others, the review showed, there were widespread
deficiencies. The alleged problems included delays of up to six
days after a disaster hits before adequate numbers of trained
workers arrive, a lack of cooperation with local agencies and an
emphasis on staging news media events during disasters.
   The paper, in a series set to begin in Sunday's newspaper, also
said the charity does not always spend all money donated for a
specific disaster on that disaster.
   The Red Cross said it was unfairly criticized because of highly
publicized shortcomings last year following Hurricane Hugo and the
northern California earthquake.
   ``It's absurd to look at last fall's hurricane and earthquake
and say the Red Cross can't do the job. The Red Cross may have had
a few little problems, but we were dealing with two unprecedented
disasters,'' said Barbara Lohman, a national Red Cross spokeswoman
in Washington, D.C.
   ``If you want to be fair and get an accurate picture, look at
the hundreds of other disasters that we worked on, and you'll find
that the Red Cross performance was almost flawless,'' she told the
newspaper.
   The Red Cross' unique operating position was created in 1900
when Congress passed a law making it the only volunteer agency
required to aid victims of disaster.
   Today, funded almost totally by donations from the American
public, the $1.2 billion operation promises immediate response to a
disaster with food and shelter, medical care, clothing, temporary
housing and other basic needs.
   To raise money, it is Red Cross policy to stress image even in
the early hours of a disaster, according to the newspaper report.
Two of the four names posted on the nightly call-out roster at
national headquarters in Washington, D.C. _ those people to be
notified in case of a major disaster _ are fund-raisers.
   ``We had a film crew and a still photographer on the ground, on
the coast before (Hurricane) Hugo hit the mainland ... and with the
earthquake, we had a video crew in San Francisco within the first
24 hours,'' Ms. Lohman acknowledged.
   Most of the national disaster staff did not arrive until several
days later.
   The emphasis on fund raising irks many critics of the
organization, founded by Civil War nurse Clara Barton in 1881.
   ``When the fund-raising ability of a disaster diminishes, so
does the national Red Cross,'' said Carl Bradford, West Virginia's
director of emergency management. ``The national organization is
clearly driven by how much money it can raise, so when the
television crews and reporters leave, the Red Cross is in the next
cars out of town.''
   Mayor Anita Wiley of Shadyside, Ohio, where 26 people were
killed in flooding in mid-June, said the Red Cross didn't arrive
for three days, ``and then all they care about is raising money and
their public image.''
   George Moody, chairman of American National Red Cross, conceded
that problems sometimes occur. But he said they're rare.
   ``When you have 2,200 active chapters involved in delivering
services, you're going to have inconsistency once in a while,'' he
said.
   Allegations of diverting funds designated for a specific
disaster area surfaced after the northern California earthquake.
   San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos charged the Red Cross was leaving
town with $55 million contributed specifically for earthquake
relief. The Red Cross announced a month later it would spend $40
million in additional earthquake relief.
   While the Red Cross is by far the nation's largest recipient of
disaster contributions, totaling $175 million last year, the Press
concluded that less publicized disaster relief groups, primarily
the Salvation Army and other national church groups, usually arrive
first, stay longer and do more.

<HEAD>New Mir Crew Begins First Full Day of Work on Space Station</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The new crew on the Soviet space station Mir began
its first full day of work aboard the complex Saturday, focusing on
experiments to create pure ``crystals'' for use in semiconductors,
Tass said.
   Cosmonauts Gennady Manakov and Gennady Strekalov conducted joint
experiments with the outgoing crew, Anatoly Solovyev and Alexander
Balandin, the official news agency reported.
   Solovyev and Balandin are scheduled to return to Earth on
Thursday. Manakov and Strekalov docked their Soyuz TM-10 capsule
with the space station Friday, two days after lifting off from the
Baikonur Space Center in Soviet Central Asia.
   The cosmonauts have turned on a ``furnace'' to melt materials to
produce the pure crystals, Tass said.
   Solovyev and Balandin have been producing the crystals in the
special ``Krystall'' module docked to the Mir. Since they arrived
in February, they produced 23 pure crystals, which Tass said were
worth about $1 million each.
   The news agency said Friday that Manakov and Strekalov will
engage in ``pilot commercial production'' of these crystals.
   The Soviet Union is focusing on the production of these
materials to make its space program profitable. It expects the
specialized manufacturing to bring in more than $40 million.
   The Soyuz TM-10 capsule that brought Manakov and Strekalov to
the Mir had other passengers aboard: five Japanese quail. Tass did
not specify what experiments were in store for the fowl.
   In December, the Soviets will launch an eight-day mission to the
Mir that includes a Japanese cosmonaut.
   The cosmonauts also have begun an experiment to produce cellular
cultures in zero gravity for use by pharmaceutical concerns, the
news agency said.
   Radio Moscow said Manakov, the flight's commander who is on his
first space mission, and Strekalov, on his fourth, were adjusting
well to zero gravity. All four cosmonauts were reported in good
health.
   Before they return to Earth following their six months in
weightlessness, Solovyev and Balandin will undergo physical
exercises in a special ``pneumatic vacuum suit'' that simulates
gravity, Tass said.

<TEXT>
   Jurors deliberated four hours without a
verdict in Mayor Marion Barry's cocaine and perjury trial Saturday
and then stopped work for the rest of the weekend.
   Deliberations halted until Monday after the panel asked the
judge for another look at more than 150 prosecution and defense
exhibits.
   Prosecutors introduced more than 100 exhibits and Barry's
lawyers more than 60 during the six-week trial on cocaine and
perjury charges.
   District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson brushed off questions
from reporters waiting at the courthouse, saying, ``Do you people
ever feel silly doing this?''
   The jurors are sifting six weeks of testimony from 44 witnesses,
including 10 of Barry's friends who said they saw him use cocaine
some 200 times dating back to 1983.
   Friday was the first full day of jury deliberations in the trial.
   The panel has been told to ignore such factors as the mayor's
flamboyant personality and his central place in local politics.
   Defense attorney R. Kenneth Mundy said in his closing argument
that Barry had engaged in ``occasional'' cocaine use. But he said
the government failed to prove the instances of cocaine possession
charged in the indictment.
   The government tracked down cocaine dealers, former aides and
ex-girlfriends of the mayor, pressuring them into giving false
testimony, his lawyers said. They said the FBI entrapped the mayor
by supplying the crack cocaine he smoked in a videotaped sting
operation.
   Rasheeda Moore, who lured Barry to the hotel where he was
arrested in a drug sting, testified that the mayor slapped her to
the floor when their two-year affair ended in 1988.
   She said their relationship mixed sex with cocaine, opium and
marijuana.
   ``I guess you all figured that I couldn't resist that lady,''
Barry told FBI agents after Moore persuaded him to come to her
hotel room seven months ago on the night of the sting.
   Barry lawyers attacked the credibility of prosecution witnesses.
Moore was unable to recall specific dates of cocaine use. She said
that was because she was not good with numbers. Mundy said the
actual reason was that her testimony was made up.
   Another key witness against the mayor was convicted drug dealer
Charles Lewis, son of a prominent Virgin Islands family. He
testified that he and Barry constructed a makeshift crack pipe out
of a sherbet glass and smoked cocaine at a Washington hotel.
   A city attorney backed Lewis' testimony, saying he found Barry
one night in a bathroom, slumped over and surrounded by drug
paraphernalia.
   Mundy depicted Lewis as the center of a drug and prostitution
ring whose testimony was aimed at shortening his prison term.

   ``Happy Birthday Grandmother England,'' read a
banner carried by one of thousands of admirers outside the London
home of the Queen Mother, who celebrated her 90th birthday Saturday.
   Crowds of fans, some of whom had camped out overnight to get a
better viewing position, were rewarded when she stepped onto the
geranium-framed balcony about 11 a.m. to wave and smile. The Band
of the Coldstream Guards played ``Happy Birthday'' as she appeared.
   The mother of Queen Elizabeth II then emerged to greet the crowd
around Clarence House, the mansion that has been her London home
since she was widowed 38 years ago.
   Dozens of children gathered around her, offering balloons and
bouquets of daisies, zinnias, lilies and baby's breath. She gently
patted the shoulder of each.
   Looking cool and relaxed despite the hot weather, she spent
nearly a half-hour shaking hands and saying ``Thank you'' to the
crowd lined up along police barricades on the mansion's grounds.
   ``It's been marvelous. Everybody has been so kind,'' she said.
   She then walked beyond the house gates, despite the objections
of nervous security guards, to visit with the crowd.
   Nearly anything associated with her pleased the crowd, which
even cheered when her corgi dog appeared at the door to the house.
   ``For me, she is everything that belongs to Britain. She's the
figurehead ... the grandmother to us all. She's absolutely
wonderful,'' said Emily Coughlin, who had waited outside since
Thursday.
   After the appearance, the Queen Mother was joined for lunch by
her daughters, Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Margaret, and her
grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

   So they're among the big Hollywood stars pumping money into the
sweeping ``Big Green'' environmental initiative on California's

   Entertainers have contributed much of the $1.4 million raised to
support Proposition 128, according to reports filed last week with
the state.
   The initiative, Proposition 128, would phase out the use of
pesticides known to cause cancer, eliminate use of gases that
damage the ozone layer and forbid the cutting of old redwoods. It
also would impose stricter rules to prevent oil spills and set up a
new state agency to enforce environmental laws.
   Opponents, including chemical manufacturers, farmers, grocers
and other business people, say it would fail to clean the
environment while driving up food and energy costs.

   Cancellation of local showings of a revival
of the hit musical ``The Fantasticks'' starring Robert Goulet has
prompted the touring company to sue a downtown theater.
   Fantasticks Touring Co., a part of Pace Theatricals Inc. of New
York, filed a lawsuit Friday in Hennepin County District Court. The
suit alleges that publicity for the show was mishandled and seeks
more than $220,000 in damages from the Minneapolis Community
Development Agency, which owns the Orpheum Theater, and from
Theater Live!, its operator.
   According to the lawsuit, the touring company and the Orpheum
agreed in May to present ``Robert Goulet starring in The
Fantasticks.'' Eight performances were scheduled between June 25
and July 1.
   ``The Fantasticks'' is the longest-running show in U.S. theater
history, having opened in a New York off-Broadway theater in May
1960. The musical was supposed to open its first national run in
Minneapolis, but after the shows were canceled, the debut was moved
to Dallas.
   The lawsuit names as defendants Fred Krohn, Theater Live!
president; and Krohn's financial partners, identified in the
complaint only as John and Jane Doe.
   The lawsuit alleges that Krohn and the others failed to carry
out the publicity plan and informed the touring company on June 20
that they would stop promoting the performances. On June 21, the
performances were canceled.
   Krohn said an agreement was never signed and that ``the deal was
in a state of flux before the show.'' He said he had not received a
copy of the lawsuit.

<TEXT>
   The stakes were high, but both sides in
the abortion debate refrained from public protests during a federal
hearing on a challegnge to Pennsylvania's strict abortion law.
   Three days of testimony ending last Thursday took place in an
atmosphere of restrained decorum. The courtroom in Reading, with
seating for about 15, was only occasionally filled.
   The closest it came to high drama was when Senior U.S. District
Judge Daniel H. Huyett admonished a witness for being evasive.
   But belying the hearing's mannerly discourses, the
special-interest groups were hard at work.
   Seated beside Senior Deputy Attorney General Kate L. Mershimer
throughout the trial was Maura Quinlan, a Harrisburg attorney whose
law firm lists the Pennsylvania Catholic Conference among its
clients.
   On the other side, the suit filed on behalf of a group of
abortion clinics and doctors was being handled in part by Kathryn
Kolbert, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union.
Attorneys for the clinics also received legal aid from Planned
Parenthood in New York.
   The suit challenges the law's provisions mandating a 24-hour
waiting period and that women notify their spouses in most cases
before they have an abortion.
   Other contested sections require minors to get the permission of
one parent, or a court order, before having an abortion and require
clinics to file detailed reports with the state on each abortion.
   Huyett is not expected to rule for about a month. The judge has
blocked the disputed sections of the law pending a decision.
   An appeal is likely, regardless of the outcome.
   Pennsylvania's law is the most stringent of any state; a tougher
one was passed last month by the Louisiana Legislature, but it was
vetoed by Gov. Buddy Roemer. Only Guam, a U.S. territory in the
Pacific, has adopted stricter controls.
   Mershimer's witnesses characterized the law as a reasonable set
of guidelines that would protect the interests of women and
families.
   But attorneys for the clinics argued that the law set up
draconian requirements that would set up a series of difficult
hurdles for women seeking abortions.
   The case has been closely monitored by abortion activists
because it poses a potential of spawning a case that could lead to
a U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe vs. Wade, the 1973
ruling that established abortion as a constitutional right.
   Still, advocates on both sides said they decided not to protest
because it wouldn't serve a useful purpose.
   Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Suzanne Mayer said abortion
rights advocates were informally discouraged from protesting during
a meeting last month of Pennsylvanians for Choice.
   ``Huyett is very fair; there's no need to annoy him with
protests,'' she said. ``If it's in the courts, you're going to
leave it to the courts.''
   Garnett Biviano, president of the Pennsylvania Pro-Life
Federation, said protests are appropriately aimed at the
Legislature, where the law was drafted.
   ``We recognize the difference between the legislative branch and
the judicial branch of government,'' she said.
   During closing arguments, Huyett gave some clues that he might
have concerns with the law. He previously has upheld challenges to
Pennsylvania's 1982 abortion law, much of which was later struck
down by the Supreme Court. Parts of that law were redrafted into
the existing statute.
   Huyett said there may be a problem with the defining which
medical emergencies would permit doctors to perform immediate
abortions to avoid substantial injury to the mother.
   On the 24-hour waiting period, Huyett, citing testimony,
speculated that the requirement might create ``a delay of several
days or a week'' for some women and, at certain times of pregnancy,
that wait could be medically significant.

   Red Cross workers on Saturday removed 22
bodies from the battlefronts of warring Shiite Moslem militias in
southern Lebanon.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross said the corpses
were taken out of three villages in south Lebanon's embattled Apple
Province.
   The Iranian-backed fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God,
and the more secular Amal militia, which is allied with Syria,
accused each other of breaking the ``mercy cease-fire'' while the
Red Cross removed the dead.
   No Red Cross volunteers were injured in the shooting.
   The Red Cross on Friday collected 60 corpses from the
battlegrounds near Israel's self-designated ``security zone'' in
southern Lebanon.
   The new corpses raised the overall casualty toll to 211 killed
and 570 wounded since the the latest round in Amal-Hezbollah
fighting broke out Jan. 16.
   The militias are fighting for dominance of Lebanon's Shiites,
the nation's largest sect.
   The 2- to 10-mile deep Israeli security zone was set up in 1985
after Israeli troops pulled back a force that had invaded Lebanon
three years earlier.

<TEXT>
   Baghdad Television announced Saturday a
list of the nine military officers comprising what it called the
free provisional government of Kuwait.
   No pictures were shown of the men, who Iraq claimed were Kuwaiti
army officers. They were not known public figures in the Persian
Gulf emirate that Iraq invaded.
   Some Arab diplomatic sources dismissed the declaration of the
provisional Cabinet as a list of fake names. Others insisted the
names were of Iraqi officers.
   The names are:
   Col. Ala Hussein Ali, prime minister, commander-in-chief of the
armed forces, minister of defense and minister of the interior.
   Lt. Col. Walid Saoud Mohammed Abdullah, Minister of Foreign
Affairs.
   Lt. Col. Fuad Hussein Ahmad, minister of oil and acting minister
of finance.
   Maj. Fadil Haidar Al-Wafiqi, minister of information and acting
communications minister.
   Maj. Mishal Saad Al-Hadab, minister of health and public works.
   Lt. Col. Hussein Ali Al-Shammari, minister of social affairs and
labor, acting minister of housing.
   Maj. Nasser Mansour Al-Mandil, minister of education and acting
minister of higher education.
   Maj. Issam Abdul Majeed Hussein, minister of justice and acting
minister of Islamic affairs.
   Maj. Yacoub Mahmoud Shallal, minister of trade and acting
minister of planning.

<HEAD>Barry Jurors Deliberate Four Hours, Break for Weekend</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jurors deliberated four hours without a
verdict in Mayor Marion Barry's cocaine and perjury trial Saturday
and then stopped work for the rest of the weekend.
   Deliberations halted until Monday after the panel asked the
judge for another look at more than 150 prosecution and defense
exhibits.
   Prosecutors introduced more than 100 exhibits and Barry's
lawyers more than 60 during the six-week trial on cocaine and
perjury charges.
   District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson brushed off questions
from reporters waiting at the courthouse, saying, ``Do you people
ever feel silly doing this?''
   The jurors are sifting six weeks of testimony from 44 witnesses,
including 10 of Barry's friends who said they saw him use cocaine
some 200 times dating back to 1983.
   Friday was the first full day of jury deliberations in the trial.
   The panel has been told to ignore such factors as the mayor's
flamboyant personality and his central place in local politics.
   Defense attorney R. Kenneth Mundy said in his closing argument
that Barry had engaged in ``occasional'' cocaine use. But he said
the government failed to prove the instances of cocaine possession
charged in the indictment.
   The government tracked down cocaine dealers, former aides and
ex-girlfriends of the mayor, pressuring them into giving false
testimony, his lawyers said. They said the FBI entrapped the mayor
by supplying the crack cocaine he smoked in a videotaped sting
operation.
   Rasheeda Moore, who lured Barry to the hotel where he was
arrested in a drug sting, testified that the mayor slapped her to
the floor when their two-year affair ended in 1988.
   She said their relationship mixed sex with cocaine, opium and
marijuana.
   ``I guess you all figured that I couldn't resist that lady,''
Barry told FBI agents after Moore persuaded him to come to her
hotel room seven months ago on the night of the sting.
   Barry lawyers attacked the credibility of prosecution witnesses.
Moore was unable to recall specific dates of cocaine use. She said
that was because she was not good with numbers. Mundy said the
actual reason was that her testimony was made up.
   Another key witness against the mayor was convicted drug dealer
Charles Lewis, son of a prominent Virgin Islands family. He
testified that he and Barry constructed a makeshift crack pipe out
of a sherbet glass and smoked cocaine at a Washington hotel.
   A city attorney backed Lewis' testimony, saying he found Barry
one night in a bathroom, slumped over and surrounded by drug
paraphernalia.
   Mundy depicted Lewis as the center of a drug and prostitution
ring whose testimony was aimed at shortening his prison term.

   State legislators are worried that
efforts by President Bush and Congress to balance the federal
budget will knock their state budgets out of balance.
   Proposed federal tax increases are targeting some of the revenue
sources states depend on to keep their ledgers from dipping into
the red, said Illinois House Minority Leader Lee Daniels.
   Daniels will be presiding this week over the annual meeting of
the National Conference of State Legislatures, where the federal
budget will be a major topic for 2,000 state lawmakers.
   Recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions have set the stage for
discussions on states' power to ban public financing of abortion
and to require pregnant teens to get the consent of a parent or a
judge before having an abortion.
   Another Supreme Court decision on the agenda: the Missouri case
involving a family's right to halt life-sustaining treatment and
the state's interest in preserving life.
   Daniels said some issues may be divisive, but not the subject of
the federal budget deficit.
   States fear proposals being discussed in Washington, D.C., could
cost them up to $4 billion by 1995, he said.
   He said state legislators fully support efforts to reduce the
federal deficit. But a National Conference of State Legislatures
study suggests federal tax hikes on gasoline, tobacco or alcoholic
beverages would damage state economies and reduce state collections
of similar taxes between 1991 and 1995.
   ``Federal budget negotiators must understand that states cannot
accept proposals that would result in damage to state fiscal
systems,'' Daniels said.
   ``States rely on these taxes to a far greater extent than the
federal government, because the federal government pre-empts much
of the income tax base and restricts many other revenue sources.''
   The study showed the largest damage would come from a proposed
6-cent per gallon increase in the federal gasoline tax, which could
cost states $3.15 billion.
   Among the speakers at the legislators' 16th annual summer
meeting will be White House Chief of Staff John Sununu and U.S.
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   Both have been attempting to negotiate a plan to slash $500
billion from the federal budget deficit over the next five years.

   A doctor was fined and another still
faces disciplinary action for mistakenly performing open-heart
surgery on the wrong woman after a mix-up in patient records.
   Besides fining Dr. Howard W. Ramsey of Gainesville $5,000 on
Friday, the state Board of Medicine ordered him to write an article
for other doctors warning them about making the same mistake.
   Board action is still pending against Dr. Daniel Knauf, a
University of Florida surgeon who operated on the healthy Palatka
woman in 1988, for letting an assistant, who was not a doctor,
examine the patient before surgery instead of doing it himself.
   During surgery, Knauf found the woman's valve normal and sewed
her up again. She survived and sued Ramsey, Knauf, North Florida
Regional and Shands. The suit has yet to be heard.
   ``This case reveals the most bizarre sequence of events that I
have heard of in a cardiologic practice,'' wrote Dr. Marshall A.
Burns, who reviewed the case for the board. ``One fiasco followed
another.''
   Ramsey couldn't explain how the Palatka woman's name wound up on
the report of another patient with a more serious problem.
   ``Nothing the board can say to me can be as severe as the
humiliation and chagrin and anger I have that this could have
happened,'' Ramsey said.
   The woman underwent cardiac catheterization supervised by Ramsey
at North Florida Regional Medical Center in Gainesville, but her
name was erroneously placed on the report of a patient who had a
serious heart-valve defect.
   After taking the erroneous report to Shands Hospital at the
University of Florida for a second opinion, she was examined by
Knauf's assistant and sent to surgery.

<HEAD>House Banking Chairman Says US Loans Helped Finance Kuwait
Invasion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Atlanta-based Italian bank helped finance
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait by supplying $3 billion in credits
partly guaranteed by the U.S. government, the chairman of the House
banking committee said Saturday.
   ``There is no question but those $3 billion are actually
financing the invasion of Kuwait,'' Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez,
D-Texas, told The Associated Press. ``There is no question that the
greater portion of that was dealing with armaments.''
   Gonzalez said $800 million of the credits made during the 1980s,
when Iran and Iraq were at war, was guaranteed under an Agriculture
Department export financing program. Gonzalez first made his
assertions in an interview Friday with the Austin (Texas)
Statesman-American.
   Justice Department investigators months ago began looking into
activities of the Atlanta affiliate of the Banca Nazionale del
Lavoro, a large, Rome-based institution owned primarily by the
Italian government.
   The Atlanta bank is one of several BNL branches in the United
States. Others are in New York, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles,
Gonzalez said.
   He said a number of officials of the Atlanta bank recently were
fired as the investigation intensified.
   Gonzalez said the Defense Intelligence Agency is also looking
into the arrangement. He also said that the Italian government has
sent an investigator to Atlanta to look into the case.
   Gonazalez scheduled an Aug. 14 hearing in the case by his House
Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee.
   The inquiry followed reports that the Atlanta bank extended $3
billion in letters of credit to Iraq, some guaranteed by the
Department of Agriculture's Commodity Credit Corp.
   The Commodity Credit Corp. and other Agriculture Department
agencies normally guarantee loans by private banks to foreign
countries as a means of financing exports of American farm products
and related goods.
   Gonzalez said in this case the CCC guaranteed $800 million of a
total of $3 billion in credits for Iraq. He said the loans were
supposed to finance purchases of grain and machinery.
   Gonzalez said, however, there was clear evidence that armaments
perhaps including chemical weapons were obtained by Iraq under the
deal. He said some agricultural exports may also have been included.
   The cost to Iraq of seizing and occupying Kuwait may never be
known, but Iraq did borrow an estimated $30 billion from its Arab
neighbors over the course of its eight-year war with Iran.
   He said full details of the arrangement are hard to come by
because Iraq later settled with the parent bank in Rome.
   He also complained that there is too little federal regulation
of such operations.
   ``Banca Lavoro is just small potatoes, even though Italy,
astoundingly, is second in foreign banking activity in the United
States,'' Gonzalez said. ``What worries me is that there is
probably $500 billion of this in Lord knows how many similar
transactions going on.''
   Gonzalez said full details of the arrangements between the
Atlanta bank and Iraq remain unknown, in part because Iraq has
since settled its debt with the parent bank in Rome. ``It's locked
in a maze of secret transactions that unfortunately are entered
into outside the United States.''

   Experts were investigating whether the
remains of 28 people discovered in four mass graves are from
leftists executed under the past government of Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, the government said Saturday.
   The new findings raised to at least 69 the number of remains
discovered since President Patricio Aylwin's civilian government
took power. Forty-one of the bodies have been officially identified
as dissidents executed after Pinochet's 1973 military coup. Many of
the bodies were discovered with the hands bound.
   The latest finding were made in Constitucion, a resort city 223
miles south of Santiago, and in Calama and Tocopilla, in the
country's northern Atacama desert, deputy Interior Minister
Belisario Velasco said.
   Interior Minister Enrique Krauss said the goverment is
investigating 1,000 cases of leftists who were reportedly executed
and 800 cases of people who reportedly disappeared following
Pinochet's coup.
   He said, however, the figures are approximate.
   ``When we don't known where the missing Chileans are, it is
difficult to determine how many Chileans are missing,'' he added.
   But the minister called on all Chileans ``to avoid trying to
find a political advantage from this painful situation.''
   Aylwin, an elected civilian, replaced Pinochet on March 11. The
74-year-old general, however, remains commander of the
60,000-member army.
   In Mutrum hill, near Constitucion, Velasco said, at least 12
bodies were found, some of them with their hands tied with plastic
ropes. Three more bodies were found in an illegal grave at the
city's cemetery, he said.
   Seven more bodies were unearthed near Calama, a mining city
1,000 miles north of Santiago. Six others were discovered in the
neighboring port city of Tocopilla.
   Workers have been digging for the last six days on the banks of
the Mapocho river, which crosses Santiago, after human rights
activists and residents of slums in the area reported that at least
33 executed leftists were buried there in 1973.
   Following the coup, the military launched a campaign against
leftists who supported the toppled government of Salvador Allende,
an avowed Marxist. Thousands were detained and forced into exile
abroad, many others were tortured. Hundreds were executed.
   In most cases the relatives of the victims were officially
notified of the executions but the bodies were never delivered to
them.
   Military officials at the time said the executions were the
result of a ``state of internal war,'' which they blamed on the
Marxists.

   The European Community, Japan, and the United
States used diplomacy, economic sanctions and military muscle
Saturday hoping to force Iraq to pull its invasion force from
oil-rich Kuwait.
   In Rome, the 12-member European Community imposed an embargo
against imports of Kuwaiti and Iraqi oil. It also banned exports of
weapons to Iraq, suspended that country's preferential trade status
and froze Iraqi assets.
   Warships from France, the United States and Great Britain
steamed toward the Persian Gulf to reinforce international forces
already in the Gulf region, but Arab nations warned against foreign
intervention in the crisis.
   However, Arab diplomatic efforts foundered Saturday. Arab
leaders postponed a summit planned Sunday in Saudi Arabia to
discuss Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   And the 45-nation Organization of Islamic Conference on Saturday
drafted a resolution condemning the Iraqi action and demanding the
immediate withdrawal of Iraqi forces.
   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said Saturday that France
would consider supporting a naval blockade of Iraq or disruption of
its oil pipelines if diplomatic efforts and sanctions are
ineffective.
   The United States, which on Thursday imposed an embargo on oil
and other Iraqi imports, reportedly approached Turkey and Saudi
Arabia about cutting Iraq's oil pipelines to the Mediterranean and
the Red Sea. Iraqi pipelines run through both countries.
   But Turkey's president, Turgut Ozal, told reporters: ``There had
been no demands from the United States for the closure of the
pipeline. Such a demand is out of question.''
   In Tokyo, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu told President Bush that
Japan would impose sanctions against Iraq if the United Nations
votes to do so. The United States has proposed that the U.N.
Security Council impose sweeping economic and military sanctions
against Iraq, and U.N. diplomats discussed it Saturday.
   Japan also joined nations freezing Kuwaiti assets to block the
Iraqi-backed government's access to them.
   Britain, the United States, France, West Germany, Italy,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway and Luxembourg have frozen Kuwaiti
assets. Britain announced Saturday it was joining France and the
United States in blocking Iraqi assets.
   The Soviet Union, Iraq's biggest arms supplier, froze weapons
shipments to Baghdad on Thursday. Italy and Czechoslovakia have
also halted arms deliveries.
   Moscow and Baghdad have had a friendship treaty since 1972, but
the Soviet press denounced the Iraqi government Saturday as a
``totalitarian regime.''
   On Friday, the United States and the Soviet Union made an
unprecedented joint condemnation of Iraq and called on all
countries to cut arms supplies.
   In Beijing, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen indicated Saturday that
China would not join the United States and other nations in
imposing sanctions.
   ``The issue should be solved within the scope of inter-Arab
relations,'' the official Xinhua News Agency paraphrased Qian as
saying.
   On Friday, Egypt and the Gulf Cooperation Council _ Kuwait,
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Oman _
condemned the invasion and called for immediate Iraqi withdrawal.
   Iran, which fought a eight-year war with Iraq, condemned the
invasion but said Baghdad's Western and Arab backers were to blame.
   A Tehran radio commentary Saturday said a solution had to be
found that would avoid giving the United States an excuse to
intervene militarily.
   ``Foreign military intervention, more than economic and military
embargos, will make the Persian Gulf a flashpoint,'' it said.
   ``The world, and especially the backers of the Iraqi regime,
were warned that military arming of Iraq, and providing all
economic and political means to strengthen this regime, will have
very dangerous effects for the future of the region,'' the radio
said.
   The British government said it was ``extremely skeptical'' that
Iraq would meet its pledge Friday to begin withdrawing its troops
from Kuwait this weekend.
   ``This is unacceptable. We want an unconditional return to the
status quo. This means that the royal family must be restored,''
said a Foreign Office spokesman, referring to Kuwait's ousted
monarchy.
   In Aspen, Colo., British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said
she would travel to Washington on Monday to meet with Bush over the
invasion.
   In Israel, Defense Minister Moshe Arens warned Saturday that
Israel will act against Iraq if it moves its forces into Jordan.
   ``We are ready, we are prepared and we are strong,'' he said on
Israel radio. ``We have a significant deterrent capability and we
can guard our interests.''

   About 100 workers cleaning up a plant rocked
by fatal explosions last month were evacuated Saturday after a
propane leak was discovered.
   Cincinnati police Sgt. Charles Horstman said the leak came from
a large tank buried in the rubble of the BASF Corp. plant, but it
was contained swiftly. No one was injured.
   A local propane company removed the tank Saturday afternoon.
   ``Everything is under control,'' Horstman said. ``This is the
type of thing that is expected in a clean-up. Tanks containing all
types of chemicals, including propane, are buried in the rubble.
But they (workers) have procedures to avoid explosion.''
   A series of blasts at the plant July 19 killed one worker and
injured at least 68 others, many of them residents of the
surrounding neighborhood who were cut by flying glass. Vapors from
a cleaning solvent leaked from equipment used to mix chemicals,
leading to the explosions and fire.

<HEAD>Hike Marks Red Letter Day for Melville and Hawthorne Fans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREAT BARRINGTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the last 12 years, literary
enthusiasts have hiked up a rocky mountain peak in the Berkshires
to toast the first meeting of Nathaniel Hawthorne and Herman
Melville.
   ``It's great fun and a wonderful way to mark the beginning of
the most famous literary friendship in American history,'' Lea
Newman said before Sunday's hike marking the 140th anniversary of
the picnic on Monument Mountain at which the two authors met.
   The North Adams State College professor is president of the
national Hawthorne Society and has written books about both
authors. She said that as a result of the meeting, Melville
entirely revised the novel that became his most famous, ``Moby
Dick.'' Melville dedicated the novel to Hawthorne.
   Over the decades, the friendship between the young Melville and
the older and already established Hawthorne has piqued literary
scholars' interest and generated a flood of doctoral dissertations.
   ``They run the gamut from they were practicing homosexuals, even
though both had wives and families, to they really hated each
other,'' Newman said.
   ``Melville was by far the more flamboyant of the two, but I like
to think it was a mutual relationship,'' she said. ``They did a lot
of drinking, smoking and philosophizing together.''
   And that's the cue taken by the literary fans who make the
annual trek up Monument Mountain, she said.
   ``Whoever wants to, goes. You just have to be interested in
either Melville or Hawthorne,'' she said.
   As they munch their picnic lunches, the hikers read an account
of the 1850 picnic written by Melville's publisher, and William
Cullen Bryant's poem ``Monument Mountain.''
   For years Gloria McInerney, who helped start the jaunts
sponsored by the Berkshire Historical Society, has hauled champagne
up the mountain in her husband's black doctor's bag.
   Oliver Wendell Holmes, who was a doctor as well as a poet and
writer, carried the bubbly up the mountain for his literary friends
at the first picnic in 1850, Newman said.
   ``At one point Melville jumped out on a rock ledge and pretended
he was on the top mast of a whaling ship,'' she said. ``It was
after the champagne. ... Then it began to rain and they all
scurried for cover under the rocks. That's happened to us some
years, too.''

   Persian Gulf shipping sources said
Saturday that Iraqi troops seized the crews of all ships docked at
Kuwaiti ports and impounded the vessels.
   No reason for the measure was announced, but there has been at
least one skirmish in a Kuwait port between a Kuwaiti naval patrol
boat and Iraqi forces on shore.
   The crews seized were from many nations, the sources said,
including at least 20 Americans and some Iranians. They were taken
to an undisclosed location.
   ``All seamen irrespective of nationality were taken off the
ships and are under Iraqi control, call it arrested, call it
seized,'' said one shipping executive, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   ``There were plenty of ships of all nationalities'' in Kuwait
waters at the time of the invasion, he said.
   The State Department cast doubt on the report of a seized U.S.
crew. ``We did check into the story,'' said an official for the
department's Kuwaiti task force, speaking on condition of
anonymity. `We have no confirmation it is true.''
   The name of the impounded American ship was not known. The
original name given by the shipping sources for the ship _ Sea Wolf
_ proved incorrect. The sources were checking to determine the
correct name and ownership.
   The American ship was docked at Shuwaikh port, the main port of
Kuwait City, said the sources.
   The gulf sources said two Iranian ships, Iran Hormuz and Safeer,
were among those seized.
   In Washington on Friday, U.S. officials were trying to confirm
rumors that other Americans might have been picked up by Iraqi
troops, said one official.
   The U.S. diplomat in Baghdad reminded the Iraqis ``of their
commitment to safeguard the safety of Americans,'' said State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher. The commitment was given to
U.S. diplomats in Baghdad during the early hours of the invasion,
Boucher said.
   Iraq's ambassador to Washington, Mohamed Sadiq al-Mashat, denied

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of rowdy youths rampaged through the
city's trendy Westwood theater district, beating up on moviegoers
and pedestrians before police restored order early Saturday.
   Police initially said the incident didn't appear to be
gang-related, but some of the assailants were described in reports
as wearing gang-style clothing, said police Sgt. Rick Walker.
   Police closed off several blocks of the district near the
University of California, Los Angeles. Officers made nine arrests.
   Three people received hospital treatment for minor injuries at
the UCLA Medical Center and were released.
   Fights broke out and the youths pummeled pedestrians in a
disturbance that began late Friday night and lasted until about
1:30 a.m. Saturday. From 400 to 600 youths participated in the
melee, police said.
   ``Groups of teen-agers ran down the street and hit people for no
apparent reason,'' said Sgt. Jeff Hanson.
   The Police Department sent dozens of officers to restore order,
he said. Arrests were made for disturbing the peace, fighting,
resisting arrest and illegal possession of a billy club, Hanson
said.
   Westwood is the city's showcase theater district, but the trendy
area has suffered periodic outbreaks of urban violence that
afflicts the nation's second-largest city.
   In 1988, the slaying of a young woman caught in a gang crossfire
prompted a citywide crackdown and focused nationwide attention on
gang violence.
   In 1984, on the eve of the Summer Olympics, a crazed motorist
drove onto a crowded Westwood sidewalk, killing a woman and
seriously injuring 54 people.

   Do all things get cheaper by the
dozen _ even children?
   Things are starting out that way for Vicki and Stephen Kesler.
   Valley View Hospital, where Mrs. Kesler had delivered six of her
most recent children, provided its services free when she went
there for her 12th. The child, Breanne Marie, was born in July.
   ``I thought it would be nice to do something for them because
they had supported us so much over the years by having their
children here,'' said John Johnson, the hospital administrator.
   Betty Mahan, a hospital spokeswoman, said Saturday she did not
know how much the free services were worth.
   The couple have lived in Rifle, in western Colorado, for 10
years. He is an engineer and she is a homemaker.
   Mrs. Kesler said that anytime she has to fill out a form that
asks about her employment, she writes, ``The Kesler home, as mother
of 12. That should be sufficient.''
   The children range to age 19.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Prime Minister Arthur N.R.
Robinson said he was gagged, beaten and shot in the leg by Moslem
fundamentalists who held him and other Cabinet ministers hostage in
an attempt to overthrow the government.
   ``I was incensed at the manner in which we were treated,''
Robinson said in a television interview broadcast Friday night. It
was his first public appearance since he was freed Tuesday.
   ``We were roughed up, made to lie face down on the floor, our
pants down, legs tied ... unable to turn except with excrutiating
pain,'' he said.
   Robinson, whose right cheek was badly bruised, spoke from his
hospital bed to Trinidad television.
   Robinson spoke briefly of his five-day captivity inside the
Parliament chamber and of the Moslem insurgents who held Cabinet
members inside the building until they surrendered on Wednesday.
   ``I really do not wish to re-live those events at this
particular moment,'' he said. ``But it is a fact I was gagged; that
the gag was being pushed down my throat by a gun.''
   Robinson said the gag thrust down his throat caused him to
vomit. He said he was shot in the right leg after shouting
``Murderers! Torturers!'' and calling on his two-way radio to the
armed forces to storm the building.
   Robinson said his leg ``is still in such a state that I cannot
use it.''
   The prime minister, who is losing his eyesight because of
glaucoma, was released by the rebels Tuesday for health reasons.
   ``Now, I could have been out before on medical grounds, but I
was convinced that my duty was to stay with my colleagues until the
fate of all of us was certain,'' he said.
   Robinson did not say whether he signed an agreement with the
rebels, who had insisted on his resignation and early elections as
conditions for the release of the hostages.
   Besides Robinson and his Cabinet, the rebels also held 26 other
hostages inside the Trinidad and Tobago Television station.
   Officials said an estimated 38 people were killed during the
coup attempt. Maj. Dave Williams said the government is still
trying to determine the count.
   Abu Bakr, the leader of the Moslem radicals, and more than 100
of his followers were being held at the Chaguaramas military
headquarters. Lawyers were meeting Saturday to draw up charges
against them that could include murder, treason and kidnapping.
   On Saturday, one of Bakr's followers was killed in a shootout
with police.
   Police Inspector Winston Cooper said Njassane Omuaali, 21, was
killed during an exchange of gunfire and was among a ``band of
Moslems'' who fired on police.
   But Omuaali's grandmother, Elaine Bailey, said her grandson, the
son of Bakr's first wife, was killed after police seized him.
   ``They grabbed him, kicked him down the stairs and killed him.
They shot him,'' said Ms. Bailey, 75, in a telephone interview.
   She said Omuaali was scheduled to return Saturday to Washington,
where he was studying finance and accounting at Howard University
on a U.N. fellowship.
   In another development, Guyana sent 40 troops to Trinidad to
assist authorities. More than 100 other troops from Jamaica and
Barbados were assisting Trinidadian troops.
   A state of emergency remained in effect with a curfew in
Port-of-Spain from 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. Soldiers and police were still
combing the city for any explosives that could have been left
behind in the coup attempt.

   A man tried to kill his wife with a car
bomb because he had married another woman and didn't want to face a
messy divorce, police said.
   ``It was a love triangle and rather than go through the bother
of a divorce and its resulting complications, he elected to get rid
of his first wife by making her go `boom,''' police Cmdr. Rodney C.
Remblad said.
   Ronald M. Harnois, 40, and his second wife, Tammy Petrin, 20,
were charged with conspiring to kill Joanne Harnois, 36, said
Remblad.
   Mrs. Harnois was not injured when one of six pipe bombs attached
to the undercarriage of her car exploded Wednesday night as she was
driving through Woonsocket, police said.
   Petrin did not know Ronald Harnois was married until two months
after she tied the knot with him in May 1989, Remblad said
   Mrs. Harnois, who married Ronald Harnois in 1983, did not know
anything about the second marriage until Woonsocket police told her
Friday.
   ``It was a total surprise ... when I told her,'' Remblad said.
   Harnois was charged with assault with intent to murder,
conspiracy to commit murder, two counts of assault with a dangerous
weapon, bigamy and filing a false document. He was arraigned
Saturday and jailed in lieu of $500,000 bail.
   Petrin was charged with conspiracy to commit murder. She was
arraigned and freed on $10,000 bail.

<HEAD>Senate Cuts Money for Cambodia, Afghanistan, Sources Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Saturday approved an
intelligence budget for 1991 that eliminates U.S. support for a
covert war in Cambodia and sharply restricts money for rebels in
Afghanistan, according to sources.
   The legislation, passed by voice vote in the early morning
hours, authorizes U.S. intelligence activities around the world
from spy satellites to secret operations.
   While most of the bill is secret, it is believed to authorize
spending in the neighborhood of $30 billion. Most of it is hidden
away in the Defense Department's budget.
   When the Senate Intelligence Committee approved the measure on
June 28, it eliminated a $13 million program of covert aid to a
rebel coalition fighting Cambodia's communist government, sources
said.
   The move was prompted by congressional fears that the aid was
primarily helping the ruthless Khmer Rouge, which is fighting
alongside U.S.-sponsored rebel groups.
   Soon after the committee action, President Bush announced a
series of policy changes in Cambodia reflecting similar concerns.
   The Khmer Rouge was responsible for the deaths of more than 1
million Cambodians during its 3{-year reign in the late 1970s. It
was chased from power when neighboring Vietnam invaded.
   Reflecting a growing distaste on Capitol Hill for proxy
conflicts in the Third World, the committee also slashed $100
million from the $300 million request by the administration for aid
to the Mujahadeen rebels of Afghanistan, who are battling the
Soviet-sponsored government in Kabul.
   Washington and Moscow have been trying to engineer an accord to
end the conflict.
   The bill governs the budgets of the Central Intelligence Agency,
the National Security Agency, which electronically spies on the
world and Defense Intelligence Agency.
   It also provides for operations of the super-secret National
Reconnaissance Office, which is building and launching a new
generation of spy satellites.
   The House Intelligence Committee has deferred action on its
version of the bill until Congress returns in September, hoping
that by then policy decisions will have been made resolving
disagreements on whether to fund conflicts like those in Cambodia,
Afghanistan and Angola.

in April that proposed two planes in 1991 and advanced procurement
of six planes in 1992 at a cost of $4.6 billion. The Senate agreed
with the revised plan. The House panel eliminated all procurement
money and included only enough funds to cancel the program after
the 15 planes currently under development.

<TEXT>
   Andrew Young's hopes to become Georgia's first
black governor have been reduced to a long shot as the former
Atlanta mayor tries to land a punch against Lt. Gov. Zell Miller,
the white front-runner.
   The Democratic primary runoff in Georgia headlines elections
Tuesday in four states, including a strong challenge to Kansas Gov.
Mike Hayden in a Republican primary. Voters in Michigan and
Missouri also will go to the polls.
   Young came out swinging shortly after his second-place finish in
Georgia's July 17 primary, in which he suffered a
weaker-than-expected showing among black voters.
   Young charged that Miller, who is chairman of a small bank,
helped himself and key supporters by pushing banking laws through
the Legislature.
   ``If it doesn't embarrass his supporters that he passed a tax
bill and ended up with a bank, I don't know what would embarrass
them,'' Young said during a campaign stop in DeKalb County
Saturday. He added that he and Miller ``just live by a different
standard. If I'd done that, I'd have been in jail.''
   In the only negative advertising of the campaign, a Young
television spot featured a Miller cutout bouncing across the screen
while an announcer accused him of changing positions on taxes and
abortion.
   On Saturday, Miller soaked up the cheers of a crowd of 20,000 as
grand marshal of the Georgia Mountain Fair parade in Hiawassee, and
criticized Young for mounting a negative campaign. ``The Andy Young
I used to know would not engage in that type of mudslinging,''
Miller said.
   Two polls released last week showed Miller favored by more than
50 percent of likely Democratic voters and Young trailing by
margins of from 17 to 20 percent.
   Race has been little discussed in the runoff race, and voter
attention seems centered on Miller's proposal to legalize a state
lottery.
   Young says he favors a referendum on a lottery, but Miller says
Young lacks the conviction to see it through. Both favor no new
restrictions on abortion and say they don't expect to need to raise
taxes.
   Miller captured 41.2 percent of the vote against four
challengers in the primary last month. Young placed second with
28.8 percent, securing a majority of the black vote but not with
the same strength that Jesse Jackson showed during his 1988
presidential bid.
   Georgia law requires a candidate to win a majority of the vote
to avoid a runoff. The winner of Tuesday's Democratic runoff will
face GOP state Rep. Johnny Isakson, who easily won a four-man
primary race.
   In recent weeks, Young has increased his efforts to woo the
black vote _ an aspect of the campaign that critics said he had
been neglecting.
   Miller, meanwhile, chided Young for negative advertising and
continued pushing the lottery. He also summoned news reporters and
camera crews to scenic locales _ a mountain stream, a race-car
driver's shop, a high school science lab _ to record his thoughts
on issues.
   The signs point to a disintegrating Young campaign, said Atlanta
pollster Claibourne Darden.
   ``It's impossible for Andy to win at this point. ... One of the
sure signs of a crumbling campaign is for the politician to openly
and consistently cultivate his pocket vote _ the vote he should
have in his pocket,'' Darden said.
   State Rep. Calvin Smyre, who is black, said Young's problems
among blacks stem from the perception that ``he left his base'' and
pitched his campaign toward whites.
   Blacks make up about 28 percent of the state's registered
voters. Some critics contend that Young's effort to broaden his
base by wooing urban, suburban and rural whites during the primary
campaign left black voters and black elected officials feeling
ignored.
   Also working against Young, Smyre said, was that ``Zell Miller
has not had a bad record when it comes to issues which relate to
the black community, and he's worked very well with black elected
officials.''
   Darden said Young's failure to score with more than about 15
percent of the state's white Democratic voters showed he failed to
erase the liberal image he developed in public life.
   ``Andy had the blueprint handed to him from (the successful
campaign last year of Virginia Gov. L. Douglas) Wilder, and Andy
refused to go with it and take a walk down the middle,'' Darden
said.
   In Kansas, Hayden faces a strong challenge in the GOP
gubernatorial primary from a political newcomer. Challenger Nestor
Weigand, a Wichita real estate executive, has capitalized on
widespread increases in property taxes as a strong issue against
Hayden.
   Former Gov. John Carlin appears to be well ahead of his two
opponents, Joan Finney, the state treasurer, and Topeka preacher
Fred Phelps, in seeking the Democratic nomination for governor.
   GOP Sen. Nancy Kassebaum faces only token opposition in the
primary.
   In Michigan, U.S. Rep. Bill Schuette is favored over attorney
Clark Durant to win the GOP Senate nomination. The winner will take
on Democratic Sen. Carl Levin in November.
   Michigan's Democratic Gov. James Blanchard has no primary
opposition. His opponent in November is expected to be state Senate
Republican Leader John Engler, who has only token opposition in the
primary.
   Missouri has no governor or Senate race this year.

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rebel leader Prince Johnson said
Saturday he is ordering the arrest of all foreigners in Monrovia in
hope of provoking international intervention in the nation's bloody
civil war.
   Johnson, whose troops have occupied much of the city in their
battle to oust President Samuel Doe, told reporters the roundup
would begin Monday and single out American, British, Lebanese and
Indian civilians at first.
   Four U.S. warships containing 4,000 Marines have been stationed
off the Liberian coast for weeks, but Washington repeatedly has
ruled out intervening. The forces could presumably evacuate the few
hundred remaining Americans.
   Fighting has shifted considerably throughout the capital in
recent days, and it was unclear whether foreigners in sections now
under Johnson's control could move freely to areas controlled by
Doe's troops.
   A Lebanese trader on Saturday became the first foreigner
reported killed in the fighting, which began as an insurgency in
December but which has since turned into vicious tribal war
including massacres and torture.
   Mohamed Farhat, who had lived in the Liberian capital for more
than 15 years, was reportedly shot and killed in front of his wife
and four children when he tried to stop Doe's troops from looting
his furniture store.
   Johnson himself shot and killed a Liberian wearing a Red Cross
emblem Friday, claiming the man was selling rice that was supposed
to be free, according to a Western journalist who saw the shooting.
   ``I want the world to know how we deal with profiteers,''
Johnson said before firing a burst from his AK-47 assault rifle,
killing him instantly while another detained relief worker _ still
handcuffed to the victim _ said rice vouchers were being sold to
prevent a stampede.
   The victim, whose name was not known, was arrested with Jacques
Monthouroy, a Frenchman working for the U.S. Catholic Relief
Services. Monthouroy was released after the U.S. Embassy vouched
for him.
   The killing has stopped rice distribution in Monrovia.
   The fighting in the civil war is centered in Monrovia, where
forces loyal to Johnson are trying to topple Doe, whose troops were
defending Doe's fortified mansion. Forces loyal to a rival rebel
leader, Charles Taylor, had been stopped by Doe's troops east of
the capital.
   At least 2,000 foreigners, mostly Lebanese and Indian traders,
still live in the embattled capital. Besides the Americans, the
Westerners include a few dozen Britons. It was not clear whether
Johnson's order included the many diplomats who remain in Monrovia,
including U.S. Ambassador Peter de Vos and British Ambassador
Michael Gore.
   ``I have decided to give a rigid order to arrest all foreign
nationals,'' Johnson told reporters at his field headquarters in
the capital's Bushrod Island. Those arrested would be held at a
secret location, he said.
   ``They will not be harmed,'' Johnson promised.
   ``I hope this will create an international incident, so foreign
troops can come in to intervene,'' he said.
   In an interview Monday, Johnson said he had telephoned the
deputy chief of the U.S. mission, Dennis Jett, to ask for direct
intervention by the Marines cruising offshore.
   The Marines are on standby to evacuate Americans and some other
foreign nationals from the besieged capital if it becomes necessary.
   Nigerian and other foreign troops would be welcome in Liberia as
part of an international force, he said, ``but not on their own
initiative.''
   West African leaders are scheduled to discuss sending a joint
flotilla to enforce peace in Liberia at a summit in Banjul, Gambia,
on Monday, according to Nigerian government sources in Lagos.
   Three Nigerian naval ships, including one armed with missiles
and heavy guns, came to Monrovia last week to evacuate Nigerians in
the capital but were turned away by Johnson's men.
   The Nigerian sources in Lagos said the ships, now in Freetown,
capital of neighboring Sierra Leone, could form the core of a West
African task force that would include ships from Guinea and Sierra
Leone.
   As Johnson spoke to reporters, he received word his forces were
being attacked by Taylor's rebels.
   Johnson said he had no more information about the attack, which
came two days after Taylor vowed to defeat Johnson before
assaulting Doe's mansion.
   About 5,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in the rebellion
in this nation founded in 1847 by freed American slaves.
   The rebels accuse Doe, who took power in a 1980 coup, of
corruption and human rights abuses. But massacres have been carried
out by both the rebels and government forces.
   Last week, government troops killed up to 600 people sheltered
in a refugee compund in Monrovia. Taylor said he believed his
father was among those killed in the sanctuary of St. Peter's
Lutheran Church. There was no independent confirmation of the claim.

<TEXT>
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani said
Saturday that Tehran is ready to restore ties with Britain, severed
over Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death call on author Salman
Rushdie. Britain said obstacles remain to restoring ties.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, quoted an Iranian official as saying that recent remarks
by British foreign secretary Douglas Hurd had made resumption of
ties possible.
   Rafsanjani had instructed the Foreign Ministry to proceed with
restoration of ties following a meeting of the National Security
Council on Saturday, IRNA said.
   In London, the Foreign Office said: ``We have noted the (IRNA)
report with interest. We will be studying it. Nevertheless,
obstacles to better relations remain. We look for a substantive
gesture of goodwill from the Iranian authorities.''
   Britain has demanded that Iran lift the death sentence against
Rushdie, an Indian-born Moslem who is a British citizen.
   It has also sought Iran's help in obtaining the release of four
British hostages believed to be held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
groups in Lebanon and a British businessman imprisoned in Tehran
for espionage.
   Hussein Musavian, director-general for West European affairs at
the Iranian Foreign Ministry, said Hurd's remarks met conditions
set by an Iranian parliamentary ruling last year for resumption of
with Britain.
   Hurd said in a British Foreign Office letter released Wednesday
that his government has no wish to insult Islam and it understands
that Rushdie's novel, ``The Satanic Verses,'' offended Moslems.
   ``The British government had nothing to do with the publishing
of `The Satanic Verses,''' Hurd said in his letter.
   The letter did not specifically condemn the book, but Musavian's
remarks indicated that Iran was prepared to accept it as a
condemnation.
   IRNA quoted him as saying that the letter was an ``adequate
response to the demand set by the Majlis,'' or parliament.
   ``The members unanimously agreed that the Majlis demand has been
met with, thus, removing the legal obstacle in the way of
resumption of political ties between the two countries,'' IRNA
quoted Musavian as saying.
   The March 1989 ruling banned any restoration of ties with London
unless the British government condemned Rushdie's book, ``The
Satanic Verses,'' and pledged to respect Islam.
   In February 1989, Khomeini issued the death call on Rushie,
saying that the novel offended Moslems worldwide. Many Moslems
around the world had protested the
   Rushdie has been in hiding since.
   The resumption of ties could be a major blow for Rafsanjani's
hard-line opponents, headed by former interior minister, Ali Akbar
Mohtashemi. They consider confronting the West a cornerstone of the
1979 Islamic Revolution.
   For Rafsanjani, who has been moving to circumvent his opponents
and restore ties with the West in order to attract foreign
investment and technology for Iran's sluggish economy, the move is
an important victory.
   Rushdie's book caused an uproar in February 1989 when Khomeini
called for the Indian-born British writer's head for insulting
Islam in his novel.
   Tehran severed ties with Britain after London objected to the
call and supported Rushdie on grounds he was exercising his freedom
of speech.
   Hurd's remarks, and Tehran's subsequent move to restore ties, is
part of behind-the-scenes dealings between Iranian and British
officials, reliable sources say.
   A source said that Iranian and British officials had met ``more
than once at a Mediterranean capital'' he declined to name. The
sources spoke on condition they not be identified further.
   The British government had been seeking to restore ties in order
to try to gain Iranian help in freeing the four Britons among the
16 Westerners missing in Lebanon.
   They are Church of England envoy Terry Waite, journalist John
McCarthy and retired pilot Jack Mann. Britain is also seeking the
release of Belfast teacher Brian Keenan who has dual British-Irish
citizenship.
   The government has also been pressing for the release of Roger
Cooper, a British businessman imprisoned in Iran since 1985. He was
sentenced earlier this year to 10 years in prison for spying.

<HEAD>Judge Criticizes Release as Gilbert Settles at Home</HEAD>

   The judge who sentenced Roswell
Gilbert to a life prison term for killing his ailing wife said the
retired engineer did not deserve clememcy because it was an act of
murder, not mercy.
   ``Roswell held himself above the law. Not one of us has that
right, and punishment is appropriate,'' Circuit Judge Thomas M.
Coker Jr. said in a letter to Gov. Bob Martinez. The letter was
released Friday.
   State officials commuted Gilbert's life sentence Wednesday and
freed the ailing 81-year-old inmate Thursday, after he had spent
more than five years in prison.
   Coker objected to descriptions of the 1985 shooting death of
Gilbert's 72-year-old wife, Emily, who suffered from Alzheimer's
disease, as a mercy killing.
   ``It is indeed my sincerest hope that the media will eventually
cease and desist from referring to this homicide as a mercy
killing,'' the judge wrote. ``There can be no serious question that
it was murder, and not mercy.''
   A television movie of the killing and trial starring Robert
Young as Gilbert was titled ``Mercy or Murder?''
   ``Nowhere in the record of this case is there any suggestion
that Mrs. Gilbert ever asked her husband to kill her,'' Coker said.
   Back in the condominium he shared with his wife, Gilbert said he
thought of her but was determined to return to live there.
   ``It's easy to come back. This is my home,'' he said Friday.
``It doesn't bother me to be alone because I know my friends are
near me.''
   Gilbert ate Chinese food and a welcome-home cake and drank
champagne and some Jack Daniels ``in moderation'' as a stream of
friends and acquaintances welcomed him back.
   ``I always have Emily in the back of my mind,'' Gilbert said.
``I grieve for my wife, but I'm going to have to deal with it.''

<HEAD>Armenian Parliament to Consider Independence on Monday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Armenian parliament elected a pro-independence
nationalist as the republic's president Saturday as it prepared to
debate whether to begin breaking away from the Soviet Union.
   The election came just days before a Kremlin deadline for about
40,000 members of pro-nationalist Armenian paramilitary units to
turn in their weapons or face forcible confiscation by Soviet
troops. The Armenian parliament has already refused to comply with
the order.
   The republic's parliament was scheduled to consider an
independence resolution Monday, said legislator Raphael Popoyan.
   If Armenia adopts the resolution, it would become the fifth of
the 15 Soviet republics to move toward complete separation from the
Soviet Union. Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Georgia have already
taken such steps.
   However, unlike the other independence-seeking republics,
Armenia is locked in a deadly ethnic and territorial dispute with
the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan. The conflict turned into
civil war for several weeks in January before Soviet troops cracked
down.
   In the past, Armenia sought affiliation with czarist Russia, a
fellow Christian nation, as a means of defense against its
traditional enemies, the Moslem Azerbaijanis and Turks.
   The new Armenian president elected Saturday is Levon
Ter-Petrosyan, a leader of the Armenian National Movement.
Ter-Petrosyan spent six months in jail last year for helping
organize mass demonstrations against Azerbaijani control of the
disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Ter-Petrosyan defeated Armenian Communist Party chief Vladimir
Movsisyan by 140 votes to 76, Popoyan said.
   On Monday, the Armenian parliament will also consider a less
radical measure calling for ``sovereignty'' within the Soviet
Union, Popoyan said.
   Similar autonomy resolutions proclaiming a republic's right to
overrule national laws have already been approved by eight Soviet
republics.
   The independence proposal calls for specific steps toward
achieving separation from the Soviet Union, Popoyan said. It does
not follow the example of Lithuania, which declared immediate
independence, with the details to be worked out later.
   Lithuania's defiance led to a 10-week oil and gas embargo by
Kremlin. It ended a month ago, when the Lithuanians agreed to
freeze the declaration for 100 days, starting from the date the
Soviet Union begins negotiations on independence. Lithuanian and
Soviet officials have been meeting regularly to set up those talks.
   Popoyan said the victory of Ter-Petrosyan, a supporter of the
independence proposal, indicated the parliament probably will
support complete separation from the Soviet Union.
   Tensions have been rising in Armenia over Thursday's deadline
for turning in weapons as fears grow of a confrontation between the
Soviet army and the Armenian paramilitary groups. The situation
worsened when the army reported 100 flame-throwers had been stolen
from a weapons depot this past week and launched a massive search
for the thieves.
   Popoyan said the flame-throwers were turned in anonymously on
Saturday, as the Armenian parliament ordered, after Ter-Petrosyan's
election was announced.
   The Armenian parliament has stated it will take responsibility
for maintaining the peace and controlling weaponry on its own
territory, Popoyan said.
   The Baltic republics started their independence drives with
sovereignty declarations two years ago. But sovereignty became a
major issue when Russia, the largest of the 15 republics with half
the country's population, also claimed the right to overrule the
Kremlin.
   The Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Byelorussia and Moldavia also have
declared sovereignty.

   Three American oil workers who had been
missing since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait have turned up in
Baghdad apparently unharmed, the State Department said Saturday.
   An official said U.S. authorities were told that eight
additional Americans among a group of 24 Westerners also have been
taken to the Iraqi capital.
   As of late Saturday Iraqi time, the eight had not been contacted
by U.S. consular officials but were reported to have checked in to
a Baghdad hotel, the official said.
   He added that the two groups may account for all Americans
thought to have been missing since the invasion Thursday.
   The names of the Americans were not available from the State
Department. Efforts were being made to contact their relatives in
the United States.
   Iraq's U.S. ambassador, Mohammed Sadiq Mashat, said the 11 were
found and are in Baghdad.
   Mashat said he hadn't heard reports attributed to Persian Gulf
shipping sources that 20 Americans had been seized off a vessel in
Kuwait. The State Department also said it could not confirm the
reports.
   There was no information on the nationalities of the 16 other
Westerners among the group of 24.
   Initially, the State Department had thought 14 Americans were
unaccounted for, but the official indicated there may have been
only 11.
   Saturday's disclosure came 24 hours after the State Department
demanded that Iraq account for the missing Americans ``as soon as
possible on an immediate basis.''
   The Americans had been working at three different sites for
various oil companies in Kuwait.
   During the early hours of the invasion, Iraqi authorities had
given U.S. officials assurances that Americans in Kuwait would not
be harmed.
   On Friday, Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly summoned
Iraq's ambassador and demanded an accounting of the missing
Americans.
   An estimated 3,000 Americans were in Kuwait at the time of the
invasion.
   On Friday, John Mika, vice president of the Santa Fe
International Corp. in Alhambra, Calif., said the company had been
informed that eight of its employees were ``detained by Iraqi
troops.'' Among them were six Americans, one Englishman and one
Canadian.
   One of the missing Americans, according to his family, was
Donald Whatley of Shreveport, La., a Sante Fe employee.
   Another was Charles Amos, 56, a Santa Fe employee whose family
resides in Gilmer, Texas.
   An American woman who fled to Saudi Arabia from Kuwait had
confirmed that Whatley and Amos were taken into custody by Iraqi
troops.
   The others were identified as Rainard L. Walterscheid, of
Dallas; Gary Carr, hometown unknown; Bobby G. Parker, of Vidor,
Texas; and B.J. Tinch, originally from Nashville, Tenn.

<HEAD>Founder of Famous Racing Car Company Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ettore Maserati, a founder and guiding
force of the famed racing car company, died Saturday. He was 96.
   His death was reported by the ANSA news agency.
   With one of his five brothers, Alfieri, Maserati produced his
first racing car in 1926. Maseratis went on to become a power in
racing with victories in the Indianapolis 500 in 1939 and 1940, and
the 12-hours of Sebring in 1953.
   In 1937, the company was bought by the Orsi group in Modena,
where Maserati worked for 10 years as technical director.
   After leaving Orsi, he and his brothers founded a new
car-manufacturing company in 1947 called ``Osca Maserati.''
   Ettore Maserati retired in 1966 at the age of 72, the last
surviving brother.
   The Maserati company is now based in Modena, controlled by
Argentine-born Alejandro de Tomaso.
   ``He was the last survivor of that group of avant-garde
super-technicians of the 1930s,'' de Tomaso said of Maserati.
``Today one talks a lot about overall quality, but in those days
the Maseratis controlled their creations one by one, piece by
piece.''

<TEXT>
   Sen. Alphonse D'Amato implored the No. 2
official in the Japanese Embassy Saturday to urge his government in
Tokyo to back President Bush's call for a worldwide boycott of
Iraqi oil and other exports.
   D'Amato, R-N.Y., a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee,
invited Takayuki Kimura to his Senate office to hand over a letter
signed by all 100 members of the Senate.
   The letter, addressed to Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu,
said, ``We urge that the government of Japan take official action
against Iraq, including blocking Iraqi assets and prohibiting
import into Japan of all goods and services of Iraqi origin, and
make these sanctions both mandatory and comprehensive.''
   Frank Coleman, a spokesman for D'Amato, said that Kimura, the
deputy chief of mission at the embassy, accepted the letter but was
noncomittal in his statements.
   ``He said that Kaifu had talked to Bush, and that no options
were precluded,'' Coleman said of Kimura. ``The DCM said he
couldn't say specifically (what course of action would be taken)
but that an announcement would be made.''
   A White House statement issued after a Bush meeting with top
advisers at Camp David, Md., Saturday said that Japan, along with
West Germany and France, had decided to join the United States in
freezing Kuwaiti assets in order to stop Iraq from confiscating
them.
   But Kaifu has said that Japan would impose sanctions against
Iraq only if the United Nations votes to do so.
   D'Amato's office said that Japan gets 8 percent of its imported
oil from Iraq and 5.9 percent from Kuwait.
   Describing his meeting with Kimura, D'Amato said he told the
envoy that the Japanese ``should understand the depth of feeling in
the United States Senate on this issue.''
   The senator said in a telephone interview that ``if they deal in
their own self-interest and aren't willing to share in the burden
(of boycotting Iraqi oil), I think that portends a very poor future
for U.S.-Japanese relations.''
   ``It seemed to me that his indications were very positive,''
D'Amato said, ``and I told him to stop this business of waiting to
see what the world community does.''
   D'Amato said he told Kimura the Japanese should understand that
Iraq's occupation of Kuwait presents a ``window of opportunity''
for Tokyo to demonstrate its willingness to cooperate with the
United States as an ally on difficult national security questions.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The snub that city leaders gave Nelson Mandela over
his praise for Fidel Castro is beginning to cost Miami convention
bookings by national black organizations.
   The National Bar Association, a group of black lawyers with
about 2,000 delegates, decided last week to move its 1993
convention from Miami to another city.
   A leading black fraternity, Omega Psi Phi, canceled plans for a
1991 meeting in Miami. Another fraternity, Alpha Phi Alpha,
considered canceling its Miami Beach convention this year but
stayed because of longstanding booking obligations.
   City officials refused to issue a proclamation in honor of
Mandela, the South African anti-apartheid leader, when he visited
June 28. Cuban exiles were offended by Mandela's show of gratitude
to Castro for his support when Mandela was imprisoned.
   Jewish leaders also were upset over Mandela's embrace of Yasser
Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Some local black leaders have endorsed the boycott, citing the
Mandela flap as well as alleged employment discrimination against
blacks in the tourism industry and the arrest of Haitian
demonstrators during a violent scuffle with police July 5.
   ``We're very concerned,'' said Mary English, spokeswoman for the
Greater Miami Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau. ``For the last several
years, we have put a great deal of emphasis on working with black
groups. They offer tremendous business potential for the community.
It's frustrating to see this happening now, but we understand their
concerns.''
   Merrett Stierheim, the convention bureau's president, sent
letters to black leaders assuring them the tourism agency will back
an affirmative action plan.
   Stierheim also asked black leaders to reconsider the boycott
because ``it is injurious to the economy of this community and
hurts all people, including blacks.''
   The bureau has been running an aggressive campaign to lure more
blacks, who represent 17 percent of Dade County's visitors, and up
to now had been succeeding. Nine major black organizations had
scheduled conventions in Miami this year, up from five in 1989.

   The Senate on Saturday passed a roughly $28
billion transportation appropriations bill for the new year,
including money for upgrading the nation's airports, mass transit
systems and Amtrak.
   ``There can be no prosperity without mobility,'' Sen. Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J., said in hailing the legislation, passed by
voice vote shortly before the Senate recessed for its August
vacation.
   Lautenberg, chairman of the Senate Appropriations transportation
subcommittee, said the measure, which will now have to be
reconciled with a slightly less expensive House version, ``takes
some critical steps'' to improve America's network of highways,
bridges and public works facilities.
   The bill provides $13.8 billion for highway construction, $8.08
billion for the Federal Aviation Administration, $3.3 billion for
mass transit facilities and just over $3 billion for the Coast
Guard. The appropriation for the Coast Guard includes nearly $53
million for oil spill cleanup activities.
   The measure includes a provision seeking to tie federal highway
funds to efforts by states to suspend the licenses of drivers
convicted of drug-related offenses.
   ``Suspending the drivers' licenses of drug offenders is an
effective weapon in the war on drugs,'' said Lautenberg, who
sponsored the provision. ``It will make people, especially young
people, think twice before getting involved with drugs.''
   The measure also includes $125 million to switch from diesel to
electric power the rail line between New Haven, Conn. and Boston _
a move that supporters said would shorten commuters' travel time by
two hours.

<HEAD>Thousands Of People Apply For Visit To North Korea</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of South Koreans lined up
before dawn Saturday for passes that would allow them to travel to
North Korea during a proposed five-day border opening.
   President Roh Tae-woo made the proposal July 20, and South
Korean officials said it could promote unification of the two
countries. However, North Korea has effectively rejected the
border-opening proposal.
   The Seoul government decided to receive applications from
would-be travelers despite the North Korean rejection, apparently
to put pressure on North Korea for the unprecedented border opening.
   Saturday was the first day for government offices throughout the
country to begin accepting applications. Government officials said
they believed more than 10,000 people submitted applications during
the day.
   Officials predicted the total applications would reach 1 million
before Wednesday, when officials stop accepting them.
   The Seoul government has said all 42 million South Koreans can
cross the border if North Korea guarantees their safe return.
   North Korea made no direct mention of the applications being
received in South Korea on Saturday. But its official Korean
Central News Agency said in a report monitored in Tokyo that Roh's
border opening is ``a deception.''
   The agency reported a commentary carried by the North's
Communist party organ, the Rodong Shinmun, criticizing Seoul's
refusal to receive a letter concerning Pyongyang's plan to dispatch
a team to meet a jailed South Korean radical student.
   North Korea had earlier said it planned to send a delegation
across the border during the five-day period to ``console'' Im
Su-kyong, a 22-year-old South Korean woman student jailed for
making an illegal trip the North last year.
   ``Judging from the fact that they refuse to receive even a
letter addressed to Roh Tae-woo ..., it is clear that his talk
about `grand exchanges of people' and `free travel' is a lie,'' the
report said.
   The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since the division of
their peninsula in 1945. They fought the 1950-53 Korean War. Their
border is tightly sealed and there is no mail or other means of
communications between them.
   Most of the applicants Saturday were elderly North Koreans who
want to see relatives left behind when they fled the Communist
state during the Korean War. There are about 10 million separated
family members in both sides of Korea.
   Some came in groups but most applied individually. The one-page
application asks for name, occupation and the place to be visited,
plus two headshot photographs.
   ``I feel crazy whenever I think about my relatives left in the
North,'' said Mrs. Lee Sung-sil, 69, who fled the North 40 years
ago. ``My parents must have died, but some of my brothers and
sisters may probably alive.''

   Police and sheriff's deputies have
formed an anti-abortion group that will press for a law allowing
officers to refuse duty protecting clinics.
   The local group is led by Nueces County Sheriff James T. Hickey,
who said he wouldn't send deputies to help police clear clinic
entrances because ``I would be aiding in murder of babies if I
did.''
   Officers for Life is apparentlhy the first of its kind in the
country, said Ron DeLord, president of the Combined Law Enforcement
Agencies of Texas.
   Elva Bustamante, director of New Women's Clinic, targeted by
anti-abortion protestors, said she was astounded that officers
would form such a group.
   ``This is outrageous,'' she said. ``I can't believe this, I
really can't ... Maybe they should find another means of earning a
living.''
   The city of 230,000 has become a focus of growing anti-abortion
activism.
   The Roman Catholic bishop on June 1 excommunicated Rachel
Vargas, director of Reproductive Services Inc., the other clinic in
the city that performs abortions, and warned Bustamante she could
be excommunicated.
   A group called Body of Christ Rescue has held more than 20
protests at the clinics since November. At one rally, Sheriff
Hickey prayed on the sidewalk while police pulled his wife and
other protesters from a doorway.
   Petitioners obtained a referendum on the November ballot that
would create a city charter amendment declaring human life begins
at conception. The declaration would have no bearing on the law.
   Ruben Rodriguez, a sheriff's department communications
supervisor, said about 12 police and deputies attended Officers for
Life's first meeting on July 26.
   ``We want to unite law enforcement and public safety personnel
to share and discover the truth about life in the womb,'' said
Rodriguez, who wears a brass replica of the feet of a 10-week-old
fetus on the collar of his uniform.
   Hickey said most law enforcement officers are opposed to
abortion and that legislating a ``conscience clause'' would simply
give them a right already granted hospital employees and other
medical personnel.
   DeLord said he doubted the state Legislature would pass a law
permitting officers to be selective about which laws they enforce.
   ``I'm supportive of their right to have a group, and the right
to legislate,'' he said. ``...But they have to set aside their
personal beliefs to enforce the law.''
   Police Chief Henry Garrett said the issue had been raised only
once, by an officer who had friends among the anti-abortion
protestors. He said he wouldn't object to his officers joining
Officers for Life.
   ``If they have their personal opinion and want to express it by
being a member of that group, that's OK, as long as it doesn't
affect their ability to do the job,'' he said.

<HEAD>Congress Approves Five-Year AIDS Assistance Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Saturday gave final congressional
approval to compromise legislation supplying more than $4 billion
over five years to help AIDS sufferers and their health-care
providers.
   The legislation, which now goes to the White House, was
especially designed to assist 15 U.S. metropolitan areas with the
most AIDS cases and San Juan, Puerto Rico.
   The House approved its version of the bill earlier Saturday, and
the measure garnered the approval of the Senate by voice vote just
before that chamber adjourned for its summer recess at the dinner
hour.
   ``America responded within days to the California earthquake
last fall. We have pledged hundreds of billions of dollars to
rescue the savings and loan industry,'' said Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass. ``AIDS is a comparable disaster, and now we begin
to respond accordingly.''
   The bill authorizes nearly $900 million per year in AIDS
spending for five years.
   The bill authorizes a total of $275 million in fiscal 1991 and
fiscal 1992, to be divided among the cities, and ``such sums as may
be necessary'' through fiscal 1995.
   A similar amount would be authorized for distribution to the
states for improving quality and availability of care for people
with the AIDS-causing HIV virus.
   A major portion of the money would go as direct aid to cities
hardest hit by AIDS to help provide health and social services. The
first half of the money, about $137 million, would be divided among
the 16 areas singled out for special assistance. The other half
would be redistributed in fiscal 1992 based on the number of AIDS
cases at that time.
   They are Atlanta, $3.8 million; Boston, $3 million; Chicago,
$4.2 million; Dallas, $3 million; Fort Lauderdale, Fla., $2.7
million; Houston, $5.6 million; Jersey City, N.J., $2.8 million;
Los Angeles, $13 million; Miami, $5.3 million; New York, $51.3
million; Newark, $6.3 million; Philadelphia, $3.6 million; San
Diego, $2.4 million; San Francisco, $20.4 million; San Juan, P.R.,
$4.1 million and the District of Columbia, $5.3 million.
   Other sections of the bill provide grants to the states, health
centers or other health care providers for testing and diagnostic
services, outpatient treatment, and for AIDS research.
   The legislation was named in honor of Ryan White, the Kokomo,
Ind., teen-ager whose long battle with AIDS drew worldwide
attention.
   Jean McGuire, executive director of the AIDS Action Council,
which lobbied for the bill, urged President Bush not to veto the
bill and ``sign this significant contribution to a `kinder and
gentler' national AIDS policy.''
   The House approved the original version on June 13 by a vote or
408-14. The Senate approved its version May 16 by a 95-4 vote.
   It was sponsored in the House by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif.,
and in the Senate by Kennedy and Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.

<HEAD>Sheriffs Lament Lack Of State Funding For Marijuana Raids</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UKIAH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While federal agents prowled remote
mountain areas on a sweep to uproot marijuana this weekend, local
sheriffs were forced to send their eradication teams home because
of funding problems.
   Mendocino County is disbanding its marijuana team on Sunday
because the state has not renewed its funding. The sheriffs of
Trinity and Humboldt counties plan to dissolve their teams within
weeks unless they get state help.
   State and federal agents last Sunday began ``Operation Green
Sweep,'' which they said was the largest anti-marijuana operation
ever conducted on public land. The drug hunt in the King Range
National Conservation Area in Humboldt County also was the first in
the continental United States to use Army troops.
   But some local sheriffs refused to participate and characterized
the operation as political grandstanding, saying that local
programs were a more consistent way of reducing cultivations in the
area about 180 miles northeast of San Francisco.
   ``It really shows a lack of good planning and vision to waste
all our money on some kind of a flash-in-the-pan military
exercise,'' said U.S. Rep. Doug Bosco, D-Sebastopol.
   This area of Northern California has been dubbed the ``Emerald
Triangle'' because the emerald-green pot plants thrive during the
long, sunny growing season, while growers enjoy the privacy of
large empty spaces.
   Since 1984, the state has provided Mendocino, Trinity and
Humboldt counties with money to patrol the mountains and yank the
weeds, valued at up to $3,000 each. Last year the counties received
a total of $2.2 million.
   Staff members at the state Office of Criminal Justice Planning
said the sheriffs should know within about a week how much money is
available in the new state budget. But it could be September before
they get any guarantees.
   Last year, criminal justice officials advanced the money for the
pot raids but were forced to make cuts in other programs after the
Legislature refused to reimburse their budget.
   Mendocino County supervisors have made sure that won't happen
with local funds, and Mendocino Sheriff Tim Shea said he would
disband his nine-person marijuana eradication team on Sunday.
   ``I'm afraid we're going to be right back in the same situation
we were in 1984,'' said Shea, referring to a year in which of
increases in drug-related killings and assaults.
   Trinity County Sheriff Paul Schmidt said he was spending local
dollars to fight pot growing, but could do that for only another
week or two. Humboldt Sheriff Dave Renner said he would keep his
team on duty for a few more weeks.

   Tests found cocaine in eight more bottles of a
Colombian soft drink and officials Saturday warned consumers not to
drink the beverage, which already caused one case of critical
poisoning.
   The eight bottles of Pony Malta de Bavaria that tested positive
for dissolved cocaine Friday had been collected by government
officials from a distributor who supplies the drink to mobile
vendors for streetside sales.
   Each of the 6.16-ounce bottles contained lethal dosages of up to
10 grams of cocaine, said George Niblack, environmental supervisor
for the Dade County Health Department. Niblack said the lethal
dosage was 1 gram.
   A Miami-area man, Maximo Rene Mendez, 25, drank from a bottle of
the soft drink on July 26 and suffered convulsions and cardiac
arrest. He was still in a coma Saturday.
   Two bottles from a lot Menendez had purchased also tested
positive for the drug _ one contained 54 grams and the other 37
grams.
   Drug traffickers frequently smuggle cocaine by dissolving it in
liquids.
   The soft drink, popular in the Hispanic community, is similar to
a non-alcoholic beer.
   It is manufactured by Cerveceria Bavaria S.A., based in Bogota,
Colombia. The company has undertaken a voluntary recall of the
product, and some of the wholesalers that distribute the drink in
Miami have recalled it, said Clifford S. Purdy, an investigator for
the Miami office of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
   Distribution of the suspected lot of the drink has been limited
to south Florida.
   ``I'm afraid there may be still some out there,'' Niblack said.

   Police waited and waited for a driver of a van to
return after a minor accident Saturday. Then they found out why he
didn't _ the van was stuffed with $12 million worth of cocaine.
   Metro-Dade police officer Donald Blocker estimated 1,000 pounds
of cocaine were packaged in sealed cocaine bricks inside 40
cardboard boxes filling the back of the van.
   ``The accident was so minor that it probably would have been
resolved by the two parties without anything being written'' by
police, Blocker said. ``It looked like the person just panicked.''
   The van had rolled backward into a car, causing no damage to
either vehicle, Blocker said. A police officer was driving by at
the time and the driver left, telling witnesses he had to call his
uncle.
   ``He just walked away because no one suspected that he wouldn't
return,'' the officer said. ``But after a period of time, they
said, `Where is he?' By that time, he had gone. He escaped.''

<HEAD>Seoul, Moscow Agree On Economic Cooperation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea and the Soviet Union, once
bitter enemies, have agreed to broad economic cooperation as a step
toward formal diplomatic ties, newspapers reported Saturday.
   The agreement was made at two days of government-level talks
that ended in Moscow on Friday, the newspapers in Seoul said in
reports from Moscow.
   The talks were arranged after Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
sent a letter to President Roh Tae-woo last month calling for joint
efforts to help promote economic and other relations between the
two countries.
   The two leaders met in San Francisco in early June in the first
encounter of top leaders of the two countries, which do not
recognize one another. The Soviet Union is a close ally and arms
provider for Seoul's rival, Communist North Korea.
   Both sides agreed to continue the negotiations in Seoul next
month, the newspapers said.
   Seoul newspapers, quoting Korean delegates in Moscow, said the
Moscow talks laid a solid foundation for an early normalization of
relations between the two countries.
   During the two-day talks, both sides presented details of
projects or cooperation they want to promote in 11 sectors,
including fishery, forestry, electronics, aviation, steel and
metals, natural gas and petrochemicals, the newspapers said.
   The Soviet Union also presented a list of consumer goods it
wants from South Korea, the newspapers said.
   South Korean delegates said in Seoul before departing that they
would offer to help ease an acute shortage of consumer goods in the
Soviet Union such as soap, shoes, toothpaste, radio and television
sets and other electronic items.
   Government sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
indicated that South Korea may provide loans for the Soviet Union
to import Korean consumer goods.
   Despite the lack of diplomatic relations, Seoul and Moscow have
greatly strengthened economic and other non-political links in
recent years, especially after the 1988 Olympics in Seoul.
   Establishing formal ties with the Soviet Union is a prime goal
of South Korea's policy of improving ties with socialist and
communist nations. Seoul officials believe such ties would help
open North Korea's closed society and thus ease tension on the
Korean peninsula.

<HEAD>Anti-Mohawk Protesters Block St. Lawrence Seaway</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 250 protesters angry about a Mohawk
blockade occupied a drawbridge over the St. Lawrence Seaway for
five hours Saturday, blocking passage of ships.
   Police finally cleared away the anti-Mohawk demonstrators, who
were also demanding more action by the federal government to settle
an armed standoff elsewhere between Quebec provincial police and
Mohawks.
   The Mohawks have blocked the Mercier Bridge for more than three
weeks. The bridge closure has forced long detours for people
traveling across the St. Lawrence River between Montreal and its
south shore suburbs.
   Indians from the Kahnawake Mohawk reserve near Montreal have
blocked the bridge in sympathy with Mohawks in the town of Oka, 18
miles west of Montreal, who have been engaged in an armed standoff
with provincial police.
   The standoff in Oka began July 11 after police rushed a
barricade set up by the Mohawks to stop the expansion of the local
golf course on land they claim is theirs. An officer was killed in
the gun battle that followed, but it is still not clear if he was
shot by Indians or fellow officers.
   The anti-Mohawk demonstrators blocked a drawbridge over the
Ste-Catherine locks on the St. Lawrence Seaway, which connects the
river with the Great Lakes. The Ste-Catherine locks near Montreal
are entirely in Canadian territory.
   During the afternoon protest, two freighters as well as several
pleasure boats were held up on the Great Lakes side of the
drawbridge. Normally between 10 and 30 ships pass through the locks
daily, most of them heading for Ottawa.
   About 50 provincial police equipped with clubs arrived on the
scene to catcalls from the demonstrators, but the crowd ignored a
police order to disperse within five minutes.
   Police then lined up three abreast and pushed the crowd off the
drawbridge. One man with a cane fell to the ground in apparent
convulsions and was taken away by ambulance.
   ``It was a good demonstration because it affected international
opinion (by blocking an international shipping lane),'' said the
demonstration's leader Jean-Pierre Potvin, the president of the
local Chamber of Commerce.
   ``It didn't bother the ships' crews, they just did a bit of
housecleaning.''
   The protesters _ mainly from Montreal's South Shore suburbs _
said that by blocking the Seaway traffic to the Canadian capital,
Ottawa, they hoped to send a message to the federal government that
their needs cannot be ignored.
   Meanwhile, traffic was flowing freely on the Champlain Bridge
and on South Shore roads after police removed several blockades put
up by anti-Mohawk local residents on Friday. The protesters had
threatened to maintain the barricades until the Mercier Bridge is
reopened.
   The roadblocks went up at daybreak Friday and some remained late
into the night, causing chaos for travelers.

<HEAD>Administration Lifts Objection To Savings-and-Loan Panel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration lifted its objections
to legislation creating a commission to probe the savings and loan
collapse after being assured the panel would not interfere with
criminal prosecutions, Senate sponsors of the bill said Saturday.
   Sens. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., and Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.,
released letters from the departments of Justice and Treasury
indicating the administration ``dropped its objections'' to a
Senate-sponsored bill setting up an eight-member bipartisan
investigative commission.
   Administration officials had said they would fight a rival
version of the legislation, the Banking Law Enforcement Act of
1990, passed by the House on July 31, and had spoken out against a
proposal by the National Governors' Association last week for such
an investigative panel.
   In a letter to Sens. Bond and Dodd, made public Saturday, Deputy
Assistant Attorney General Bruce Navarro, restated administration
concerns that the House version of the legislation ``could pose
real dangers'' to ongoing savings-and-loan criminal investigations.
   ``We are particularly pleased that, unlike the House bill, your
proposal takes care to ensure that ongoing criminal investigations
and prosecutions conducted by the department are neither
compromised nor impeded.''
   The executive and legislative branches of government
historically have feuded over companion investigations of various
scandals by the Justice Department and congressional committees.
   This was dramatized recently in a federal appellate court's
decision reversing one of former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North's
Iran-Contra convictions and ordering a lower court to review other
convictions to determine whether immunized testimony North gave the
Congress was impermissibly used against him by Iran-Contra
prosecutors.
   Bond and Dodd got the administration to lift its objections to
their S&amp;L fact-finding commission by agreeing to amend the
legislation. Under the new version, the commission would be
required to inform the Justice Department when it plans to call
witnesses implicated in savings and loan failures.
   The two senators said in a statement Saturday that if the
department or the Resolution Trust Corporation certifies that
commission testimony could jeopardize a pending criminal
investigation, ``the commission would not call the witnesses.''
   ``However, the commission has the authority to request
additional powers after 60 days if it believes the investigation is
impaired in any way,'' their statement said.
   In his letter, Navarro said: ``We have concluded that your
proposal constitutes a workable compromise solution that adequately
takes into account the legitimate concerns of all involved.
Consequently, we have no objection to its enactment.''
   Bryce Harlow, an assistant Treasury secretary in charge of
legislative affairs, said in a separate letter that his department
is satisfied the Senate proposal ``has sufficient safeguards to
protect ongoing civil and criminal investigations.''
   A host of congressional committees already is conducting various
investigations into the savings-and-loan debacle, and the
administration had previously shown no enthusiasm for the separate
effort by a study commission.
   The bipartisan commission would be constituted of two members
appointed by President Bush, two by Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, two by House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.,
and one each by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., and House
Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill.

   President Bush huddled Saturday with senior
advisers to devise a strategy for pushing Iraqi occupation forces
out of Kuwait, while an Iraqi envoy announced that ``Kuwaiti
authorities'' were now in control of the oil-rich nation.
   Mohammed Sadiq Mashat, the Iraqi ambassador to the United
States, read a government statement reiterating Baghdad's intention
to begin withdrawing from Kuwait on Sunday ``unless a threat to the
security of Kuwait or Iraq has reemerged.''
   Mashat, speaking at the Iraqi Embassy, also said Iraq will not
attack Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, and he
confirmed that 11 of 14 Americans missing in Kuwait had been found,
taken to Baghdad and are now free to leave the country.
   The ambassador declined to elaborate on the Americans' plight.
   Mashat said the troop withdrawal was deemed possible because
order had been restored.
   ``The situation in Kuwait is back to normal,'' he said.
``Security and stability are maintained for all the population _
indiginous and resident. Kuwaiti authorities are consolidating
their control over all aspects of life in Kuwait.''
   The Bush administration has expressed doubts about Iraq's
pledge, first delivered on Friday, to begin withdrawing its
invasion force from Kuwait on Sunday.
   ``I assure you he does not intend to withdraw,'' Saud Nasir
Al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti ambassador, told reporters at a news
conference shortly after the Iraqi ambassador spoke in Washington.
   ``They (Iraqi forces) have already dug in. They have already dug
in the south, along the Saudi border, they have dug in our country
deeply. They have taken over the central bank. They have ransacked
all the banks in Kuwait, all the institutions. They have even gone
to the low of going into houses and taking private property.''
   Al-Sabah, a member of Kuwait's ruling family, said the Iraqi
forces have ``conducted themselves in a way that no other occupying
force has.''
   He said he interpreted during a telephone conversation earlier
Saturday between Bush and the Emir of Kuwait, but declined to
disclose what was said. He said the Kuwaiti embassy in Washington
also facilitated a letter exchange between Bush and the exiled
leader.
   White House spokesman Douglas Davidson said Bush also spoke by
telephone Saturday afternoon with King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and
Prime Minister Turgut Ozal of Turkey, but the spokesman gave no
details on the conversations.
   Although Al-Sabah had called earlier for military intervention
from the United States, he said Saturday that he was grateful for
economic and diplomatic sanctions arranged by the United States.
   The question of military assistance, he said, is a ``decision
(that) has to be made by the administration according to their
readiness and their policy making. The bottom line is we are
pleased the United States is moving and cultivating the whole world
behind it.''
   Bush met for two hours with Vice President Dan Quayle and the
president's top military and national security aides at his Camp
David, Md., mountain retreat to consider possible U.S. actions and
to monitor reports on Iraqi troop movements.
   A White House statement issued after the meeting said three key
U.S. allies _ Japan, West Germany and France _ had decided to join
the United States in freezing Kuwaiti assets in order to stop Iraq
from confiscating them.
   In all, 11 nations have frozen Kuwaiti assets. The actions take
aim at Kuwaiti government investments that amount to as much as
$100 billion and that include massive holdings of U.S. government
securities, chains of gasoline stations across Europe, an American
oil services company and stakes in other major corporations.
   Also on Saturday, the 12-nation European Community agreed to ban
imports of Iraqi oil, freeze Kuwaiti assets and halt arms sales to
Iraq. The United States banned imports of Iraqi oil on Thursday and
Bush has encouraged others to do the same.
   Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, indicated in
a statement on the Camp Cavid meeting that Bush was keeping open
the possibility of resorting to military force to compel Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait.
   ``We continue to seek the immediate, complete and unconditional
withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait and restoration of the
legitimate government of Kuwait,'' Fitzwater said. ``As we have
stated before, all U.S. options are under consideration.''
   Fitzwater said the White House had no information on missing
Americans in Kuwait.
   Iraq announced on Friday that its troops would begin withdrawing
from Kuwait on Sunday, but that the Kuwait royal family that ruled
the city-state would not be allowed to return.
   In Bahrain, Persian Gulf shipping sources said Iraqi troops on
Saturday seized the American crew of a ship docked at a Kuwait port
and took them off the vessel. The sources said the fate of the 20
Americans from the ship was not known.
   The vessel was docked at Shuwaikh port, the main port of Kuwait
City, said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The State Department questioned the report on the seized crew.
``We did check into the story,'' said a spokesperson for the
department's Kuwaiti task force. ``We have no confirmation it is
true.''
   Another official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said
earlier the department thinks the story is untrue.
   Mashat, the Iraqi ambassador, said he had not heard of the
report.
   The State Department also said Saturday that three of 14
American oil company workers believed to have been detained by Iraq
in Kuwait had turned up in Baghdad apparently unharmed. A U.S.
official said eight others also were believed safe. As of late
Saturday Iraqi time, the eight had not been contacted by U.S.
consular officials but were reported to have checked in to a
Baghdad hotel, the official said.
   He added that the two groups may account for all Americans
thought to have been missing since the invasion Thursday. The names
of the Americans were not available from the State Department.
   A central dilemma facing the Bush administration in considering
a further response to the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait is the
complications of a U.S. military operation. The United States has
no ground forces based in the area. Iraq has one million men under
arms and is by far the strongest army in the region.
   Pentagon sources said Saturday that Cheney and Gen. Colin
Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, briefed Bush at Camp
David on the military situation in the gulf.
   ``The situation with the Iraqi military seems to be pretty
static,'' said one senior Pentagon official, speaking on condition
he not be identified. ``Right now, we're looking to see if they
withdraw their forces from Kuwait, as they said they would.''
   One senior military official, who spoke privately, said some
``refined options'' apparently were offered to the president by
defense officials, but that he could not discuss what they were.
   Bush earlier had been presented with what was described as ``a
spectrum of options'' for military action that included offering
war-fighting hardware to Kuwait's neighbors and more aggressive
moves, such as a naval blockade or tactical air strikes or bombing
runs against Iraq, Pentagon sources said.
   ``But just because we presented these to the president, doesn't
mean that we'll use them,'' cautioned another senior Pentagon
official. ``Providing such a range is what we do here _ contingency
planning is our job.''
   The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Les Aspin,
D-Wis., said Saturday that Kuwait appears to be firmly in the grip
of Iraq, putting the administration in a quandary if Saddam Hussein
installs a puppet government and withdraws his forces.
   ``I think it's going to be difficult to sustain an economic
boycott or military action in any case, with the American public
and the world,'' Aspin said on CNN's ``Newsmaker Saturday.'' ``I
think that's a very tough situation for us to deal with'' if such a
situation is tolerated by Iraq's Arab neighbors.

   Oil oozed into sensitive marshlands on
the north end of Galveston Bay, but fishing resumed Saturday in
parts of the bay where up to 700,000 gallons of oil spilled from a
damaged barge.
   Cleanup crews used vacuum trucks to suck up the oily mess, which
has washed up along an estimated seven-mile stretch of Houston
Point. The oil has struck marshes and some residential property in
the area.
   Coast Guard Capt. Thomas Greene, who flew over the area
Saturday, said he was encouraged by the shoreline cleanup but
expected it to last another week.
   ``We're at the point where most of the oil is on the beach. I
think we can deal with that,'' Greene said. ``There's no more oil
coming from anywhere. It's just a matter of finishing the job.''
   Environmentalists were worried by reports of at least two
oil-soiled birds. Workers used noise makers along the oily shore to
keep birds from landing in the goo.
   Booms along the shoreline trapped some of the oil and stopped
new crude from washing ashore, the Coast Guard said.
   New oil was reported Friday morning along Houston Point, on the
north end of the bay between the Houston Ship Channel and Trinity
Bay.
   Crews were laying additional absorbent booms to protect marshes
further into Trinity Bay, Greene said. The Coast Guard also plans
to spray oil-gobbling microbes on some marshy areas Sunday, he said.
   State officials dumped the microbes on a 400-yard stretch of
beach on Pelican Island on Thursday, but results weren't expected
for several weeks.
   ``My comfort level is much higher today as far as the oil we can
see,'' said Larry McKinney, director of resource protection for the
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. ``For the long-term, I'm still
concerned because we can't account for about 500,000 gallons.''
   Coast Guard officials estimated that between 500,000 and 700,000
gallons of oil spilled, but they have been perplexed by the
relatively small amount of oil that has been cleaned up or has
washed ashore.
   The oil spilled into Galveston Bay when a tanker collided with
two barges July 28 in the ship channel, the Coast Guard said.
   One of the barges nearly sank, but it has since been raised and
moved to shallower waters in the bay. Salvage crews Saturday were
considering the possibility of cutting it in half, then moving the
pieces out of the bay.
   Limited traffic resumed Friday in the ship channel after the
barge was moved.
   In Beaumont, Texas, two federal lawsuits were filed on behalf of
hundreds of people who say their livelihoods have suffered because
of a massive oil spill in Galveston Bay.
   Both class-action lawsuits name Apex RE&amp;T Inc., owner of the
barges, and Eletson Corp., owner of the tanker Shinoussa, as
defendants.
   The lawsuits seek monetary awards for each fisherman expected to
lose money because of the spill, which occurred with the shrimping
season's peak period approaching. Neither lawsuit asks for a
specific amount of damages.
   Lawyers in Houston for both companies did not return calls from
The Associated Press Saturday.
   Meanwhile, a ban on all commercial and recreational fishing in
the bay was partially lifted early Saturday. But Texas Health
Commissioner Robert Bernstein cautioned fishermen and consumers to
avoid eating fish tainted with visible oil or fish caught in oily
waters.
   A federal inquiry investigating the cause of the accident also
resumed Saturday in Houston.
   On Friday, a Houston pilot, Capt. Raymond Fincher, disputed
claims by crewmen of the tanker Shinoussa who said the pilot
ordered the vessel to speed through the ship channel and then to
turn into the barges in the oncoming lane.
   Fincher blamed Shinoussa helmsman Mohammed Haque of Bangladesh.
Fincher said Haque failed to turn correctly, setting the ship on a
collision course with three barges towed by the tugboat, Chandy N.
The third barge was not hit by the tanker.
   U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Robert Douville said findings of the
panel are not expected for at least six months.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Baghdad on Saturday announced a new
military government for Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, and foreign reports
said Iraq was massing troops along Kuwait's southern border with
Saudi Arabia.
   Baghdad television said the new Kuwait leadership is made up of
nine Kuwaiti army officers. Earlier, Iraq said it was building a
new Kuwaiti army to back the government it installed.
   In Washington, Iraqi ambassador Mohammed al-Mashat denied U.S.
and other foreign reports suggesting that Iraq plans to invade
Saudi Arabia.
   U.S. and Kuwaiti officials expressed skepticism that Iraq would
begin a withdrawal this weekend from Kuwait _ as it had indicated
Friday. Reports of the withdrawal, to begin Sunday, came in a
communique read on Baghdad radio.
   Saud Nasser Al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti ambassador to Washington, told
reporters at a news conference that Iraq ``does not intend to
withdraw'' its troops from Kuwait.
   In Rome, the 12-member European Community announced it was
imposing an embargo on oil imports from Iraq and Kuwait, suspending
arms sales to Iraq and freezing Iraqi assets in Europe.
   That action was only the latest in mounting pressure on Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait, which his forces
invaded Thursday to settle disputes over oil and land.
   In Washington, al-Sabah said there were reports of ``800 or
maybe more'' casualties from the fighting, although he said he had
no contact with his homeland because lines have been cut. Persian
Gulf-based Arab diplomatic sources have estimated that at least 200
people were killed or wounded during the Iraqi invasion, but could
not confirm the higher casualty figures.
   In other developments:
   _U.S., French and British warships steamed toward the Persian
Gulf, and French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said France would
consider supporting a naval blockade of Iraq. In Washington, the
Pentagon said a third aircraft carrier would head for the Middle
East to bolster the eight-ship U.S. Navy presence already there.
President Bush said Friday that if Iraq moved against Saudi Arabia
it would be attacking U.S. ``vital interests.''
   _Arab leaders warned against foreign intervention in the region
and sought a diplomatic solution, but an emergency Arab League
summit to discuss the crisis initially planned for Sunday in Saudi
Arabia was postponed.
   _ Persian Gulf shipping sources said Iraqi troops seized the
crews of all ships docked at Kuwaiti ports and impounded the
vessels. The crews from many nations included at least 20
Americans, the sources said. However, spokesmen at the U.S. State
Department said they had no information to confirm the report of
U.S. crewmen being seized.
   _In London, the Defense Ministry said Iraqi soldiers took 35
British servicemen acting as advisers to Kuwaiti forces from their
homes in Kuwait overnight. It said they were later flown to
Baghdad. The servicemen were among 66 British military advisers in
Kuwait. Britain said it has been assured by Iraq that all 35 were
safe.
   _Kuwaiti diplomatic sources who contacted Kuwaiti residents by
telephone said Iraqi tanks and troops had begun to withdraw from
downtown Kuwait city. Gulf-based Arab diplomatic sources, who are
in contact with their embassies in Kuwait, said there was scattered
shooting and looting by Iraqi troops in the Kuwaiti capital. Iraqi
soldiers broke into banks, supermarkets and automobile showrooms,
driving off with luxury cars, the diplomatic sources said.
   _ Three U.S. oil workers missing since the Iraqi invasion turned
up in Baghdad apparently unharmed, the State Department said in
Washington. An official said U.S. authorities were told eight other
Americans had also been taken there in a group of 24 Westerners.
Iraq's U.S ambassador said the Americans would be free to leave.
U.S. officials, who earlier said 14 Americans were missing, said
the 11 Americans may account for all those thought missing.
   Iraq said the new Kuwaiti government is headed by Col. Ala
Hussein Ali. He holds the positions of prime minister, commander in
chief of the armed forces, minister of defense and interior
minister. The other eight members were lieutenant colonels and
majors.
   Diplomatic sources elsewhere in the gulf, however, said those
names could be fake, or the people on the list could actually be
Iraqis.
   ``I assure you ... that none, I repeat none, of the names ...
put forward are Kuwaiti nationality or citizenship,'' said
al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti ambassador in Washington and a member of the
royal family. ``They are all Iraqi military people.''
   Iraqi TV showed no pictures of the government members.
   Also Saturday, Baghdad radio broadcast a communique from the
``provisional government of free Kuwait'' announcing it was
creating a popular army that would accept all Arab nationals ``who
wish stability for Kuwait in its new age.''
   The official Iraqi news agency said that 140,820 Iraqis living
in the border area with Kuwait had volunteered to serve. The gulf
diplomatic sources said busloads of the Iraqis began arriving in
Kuwait.
   There were reports from the U.S. State Department, intelligence
officials and witnesses that Iraq was moving parts of its invasion
force to Kuwait's almost 150-mile-long southern border with Saudi
Arabia, the monarchy that has the world's largest oil reserves.
   Residents of the Saudi border city of Khafji, reached by
telephone from Bahrain, said Iraqi troops laid down a checkpoint
less than a mile from the frontier.
   The U.S. State Department said some of the invasion force had
pushed to within five to 10 miles of the Kuwait-Saudi border.
   The possibility of an Iraqi thrust into Saudi Arabia worried
members of Congress. Lawmakers attending secret briefings on the
crisis said 120,000 Iraqi troops massed along Kuwait's southern
border could easily attack the Saudis next.
   On Saturday, Bush said in Washington that the use of force in
resolving the crisis remains an option. Saudi Arabia ships 1.2
million barrels of oil to the United States daily.
   A high-ranking Saudi official said Saturday on condition of
anonymity no Iraqi troops had entered Saudi Arabia.
   On Friday, Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council, led by Saddam,
said it planned to begin a withdrawal Sunday, ``unless something
appears that could threaten the security of Kuwait and Iraq.''
   But in Washington, presidential Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater
expressed skepticism Iraq would begin its withdrawal. ``We need to
wait and see,'' he said.
   The Soviet Union, Iraq's main weapons supplier, cut off
shipments Thursday, while the United States froze Iraqi and Kuwaiti
assets on the same day. France, Italy, Poland, Britain and other
countries also imposed sanctions on Iraq.
   In Iraq, people crowded grocery stores Saturday to buy rice,
sugar and cooking oil after they heard reports that the U.S.
economic sanctions included a cutoff in agricultural credits. The
credits are used to buy grain and other foodstuffs.
   The atmosphere was tense, though generally quiet in Kuwait city,
according to residents reached by telephone. Some Kuwaitis had been
distributing anti-Iraqi leaflets near downtown mosques, the gulf
diplomatic sources said.
   Iraqi tanks shelled al-Beda, a man-made island on the city's
southern coast near an industrial center, said one diplomat on
condition of anonymity. He did not know why it was shelled.
   Iraq's invasion followed two weeks of threats and accusations
against its small Persian Gulf neighbor.
   On July 17, Saddam accused it of stealing oil from a field that
straddles their disputed border. He also blamed Kuwait for a fall
in oil prices that cost Iraq $14 billion, saying it contributed to
the oil glut by cheating on its OPEC oil cartel production quotas.

<HEAD>Government Settles With Spouse of Woman Killed by Glacier</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In what may be the first time a government
has been sued for the movement of a glacier, the United States has
agreed to pay the husband of a woman killed when ice fell on her in
Kenai Fjords National Park.
   Thais Grabenauer, 59, of Napa, Calif., died one day after the
June 16, 1987, accident during the couple's outing to the
spectacular Exit Glacier.
   According to a National Park Service investigation, Mrs.
Grabenauer was standing beneath overhanging ice while her husband,
Ken, stepped away to take a photograph. Half a ton of ice broke off
and knocked both of them to the ground.
   Rangers flew Mrs. Grabenauer to Anchorage, where she died in a
hospital of internal injuries.
   The lawsuit filed two years later by Ken Grabenauer charged the
park service with negligence for failing to warn visitors
adequately of the hazards of glacier ice and for failing to erect
barriers.
   Park service officials admitted no liability in the out-of-court
settlement, reached in March. Both parties agreed not to disclose
the amount of the settlement.
   Grabenauer, 68, had asked for $1.5 million. Assistant U.S.
Attorney Sue Ellen Tatter in Anchorage said last week the
settlement was considerably less than that.
   One of the main issue in the case was whether the Park Service
is responsible for warning people and keeping them out of dangerous
areas.
   The once-remote glacier had become more accessible in the years
before Mrs. Grabenauer's death.
   A two-lane highway was built over a wild river that past
visitors had to ford to reach the glacier,15 miles from Seward,
which is 125 miles south of Anchorage.
   The Grabenauers were on a driving vacation to Alaska and decided
to visit the glacier on a lark, after seeing promotional material
in Seward that said they could ``walk up and touch a glacier.''
   The Park Service, which has placed new warning signs since the
accident, claimed those up at the time adequately warned of the
dangers of approaching the ice. It also noted that the couple left
an established trail.
   Speaking by telephone from California, Grabenauer said the
dangers are apparent to him now. ``But how does one know unless
you're living there and familiar with those geographical
conditions?'' he said.
   The Park Service has measured the glacier's downhill movement at
an average of 20 inches a day, said Ted Patterson, a park volunteer.
   ``The glacier is real,'' said park superintendent Anne
Castellina.
   ``People think when you attach `National Park' to something then
it's going to be hazard-free,'' she said. ``You go to Disney World
for that.''

<HEAD>Leader of Pro-Walesa Party Calls for President To Resign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of a political party backing
Lech Walesa for president said Saturday that the current holder of
that post should step down soon.
   Jaroslaw Kaczynski, chairman of the pro-Walesa Center Alliance,
said his party would support a proposed change in the constitution
to make the president elected directly by the people. But he said
the president should then be given stronger powers than under the
current parliamentary system.
   Kaczynski said a fight for the presidency could occur between
Walesa, chairman of the Solidarity trade union, and Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Walesa's former ally and adviser. But he said
his party would not be afraid of such a battle.
   ``A clash between Walesa and Mazowiecki in presidential
elections would not be very favorable for Poland from the political
point of view, but if this is the will of the people, too bad,''
Kaczynski said, speaking at a news conference at his office.
   ``The Center Alliance calls for the president of the republic to
resign in the shortest possible time. We think that it could happen
even in the next few weeks,'' Kaczynski said.
   The current president, Wojciech Jaruzelski, was Poland's
Communist leader before its transition to democracy last year.
   Although the Center Alliance has been calling for the parliament
to quickly install Walesa as president, Kaczynski said the party
would support changing the constitution to allow a direct election
in light of opinion polls showing that method is far more popular
with the public.
   But he added: ``Changing the president is more important than
the manner in which it should be done.''
   If a constitutional change cannot be agreed to swiftly, then
Walesa should be elected by the current parliament for six to 10
months, he said. During that time, he said a new parliament would
be elected and a new constitution written.
   After this provisional presidency, Walesa could run again for a
full term in a direct election, he said.
   Kaczynski also said sweeping cabinet changes should follow the
proposed elections but advocated leaving Mazowiecki as prime
minister. He added that it is ``highly probable'' that Mazowiecki
would resign after the new president's appointment.
   Kaczynski said a petition passed among Parliament members
calling for the immediate resignation of Jaruzelski, which began
circulating July 28, now has 125 signatures. There are 470 deputies
in the Sejm, the lower house, and 100 senators.

   A plastics company sent nine employees to
Iran on Saturday to build 1,200 houses for those left homeless by
an earthquake that killed more than 50,000 people.
   The workers from FANA Inc., of Springfield, took with them
heat-shrink film and pipes that will be used to build the
structures, said FANA president Anthony Seraphin.
   The film is a thick, opaque plastic that is designed to be
shrunk on pipe frames to form a shelter. The homes are not designed
as permanent structures but should last two to three years.
   ``We can put these buildings up quickly. A home 20-by-20 (feet)
takes two hours, tops,'' Seraphin said. ``We won't build all the
structures. We will be showing them how to do it and then go on to
the next town.''
   The company, which also aided earthquake victims in Soviet
Armenia two years ago, started planning the trip shortly after an
quake struck in Iran on June 21, leaving more than 50,000 dead and
500,000 homeless.
   But the task became mired in complications because the United
States severed relations with Iran more than a decade ago over the
hostage crisis.
   ``It certainly has been a long road,'' Seraphin said. ``Armenia
was nothing compared to this.''
   First, the Iranian government insisted on assigning a department
to take charge of the effort but couldn't decide which one,
Seraphin said. Iranian officials finally settled on the
Revolutionary Guard.
   Then, Seraphin said, the company encountered difficulty in
getting an air carrier to haul the equipment and the company
workers.
   ``The military wanted to take us, but the State Department had
to say no because they can't help us over there,'' Seraphin said.
   The company finally lined up Pakistani Airlines International to
take the workers to Frankfort, Germany, where Iranian planes will
pick them up, Seraphin said.
   The equipment left several days ago on a third carrier,
Alitalia, Seraphin said. The entire effort has been financed with
$45,000 in private donations, he said.
   Seraphin said Iranian officials have promised him the company's
problems will end once the workers reach Iranian soil for the 10
days of work.
   ``We have been assured by the Iranian government that we will be
able to move from town to town,'' he said. ``We have been assured
we will be very welcomed there.''
   Another relief agency, AmeriCares, based in New Canaan, Conn.,
distributed 40 tons of supplies to survivors of the Iranian
earthquake shortly after the disaster struck.
   ``I think this is a major breakthrough in relations,'' Seraphin
said. ``We're just going in there to help the people. In Armenia,
there were tears when we left, and I'm sure the same will be true
this time.''

   The family of a black teen-ager fatally
shot by a white police officer marched with 200 supporters Saturday
and called for an investigation of the coroner who made errors in
the youth's autopsy.
   Bergen County Medical Examiner Lawrence J. Denson was relieved
of his medical duties last week after errors were found in his
autopsy of Phillip Pannell, 16, of River Edge, who was shot April
10.
   ``We want an investigation on the medical examiner, to determine
whether his alleged mistakes were truly mistakes or if they were
intentional,'' said Ted Wells, a lawyer with the Bergen County
chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People.
   The father of the slain boy said that conspiracy, not
incompetence, was at question.
   ``No mistake whatsoever, it started out as a coverup,'' said
Phillip Pannell Sr. ``The problem is that this system doesn't
work.''
   State Medical Examiner Robert Goode wrote in a letter dated
Wednesday that Denson made mistakes in concluding where Pannell's
hands were when he was shot, a crucial point in the controversy
surrounding the youth's death.
   Witnesses said Pannell had his hands up when he was shot by
Officer Gary Spath, but Spath maintains Pannell was turning and
reaching for what the officer thought was a gun in his coat pocket.
   A forensic specialist brought in by the Bergen County
Prosecutor's office concluded Pannell's arms were raised because
the bullet hole in Pannell's down jacket indicated the jacket had
ridden up his back.
   A state grand jury last week voted not to indict Spath, but
Attorney General Robert Del Tufo said a second grand jury will
investigate the shooting using the results of the second autopsy.
   ``We want the new forensic evidence presented, and an indictment
for murder returned against Officer Spath,'' said Wells.
   Carrying the flags of the United States and South Africa's
African National Congress, the 200 marchers walked the length of
Cedar Lane, the main commercial street in this New York City suburb.
   Some of the predominantly black marchers voiced anxiety about
the future of Teaneck, held by many to be a model of racial harmony
after it voluntarily desegregated its schools in the late 1960s.
   ``I moved here because this is a special town and I want to
preserve it,'' said Eunice Pruitt, whose four children and two
grandchildren grew up in Teaneck.
   ``This whole thing makes me sick,'' said John Gish of
Hackensack, a gay activist who said he marched to protest all bias
violence.
   A rally April 11 to protest the shooting turned into a riot,
with youths smashing windows and overturning police cars.

   The U.S. and Soviet navies are investigating a
claim that a Soviet sailor sexually assaulted a U.S. Navy woman
aboard a Soviet warship in port on a goodwill visit, officials said
Saturday.
   The enlisted woman allegedly was assaulted Tuesday morning when
she became separated from friends during a tour of a Soviet ship.
She was dressed in civilian clothes at the time, officials said.
   The Soviet destroyers Admiral Vinogradov and Boyevoy were opened
to public visits during a five-day stop at the port that began
Tuesday.
   The woman was not identified and officials did not say which
ship she visited. No further details of her claim were revealed.
   ``Both of our navies are jointly evaluating whether there is any
basis to this allegation,'' said Adm. Charles Larson, commander of
the U.S. Pacific Fleet. ``A joint evaluation of evidence must be
made to decide if there's any basis in fact.''
   The woman was not able to describe the assailant or provide
additional information to Naval Investigative Services agents, said
Lt. Cmdr. Bob Pritchard, a Navy spokesman.
   When the Navy finishes its investigation the findings will be
turned over to the Soviets, who would have jurisdiction, Pritchard
said.
   If there is enough evidence for a court marshal, the sailor
would likely be prosecuted in the Soviet Union and not extradited
to the United States, said Col. Nicholay N. Bessubchenco of the
Soviet Political Directorate.
   The allegation surfaced on the eve of the departure of three
Soviet ships. ``We are checking our sailors to ask them about
everything,'' Bessubchenco said. ``It's very serious. This a very
serious report.''
   The Soviet port call in San Diego was part of an ongoing
goodwill exchange between navies of the two countries.
   ``Two Pacific fleets of two great countries reached out for a
handshake,'' said Adm. Genadiy Khvatov, the Soviet Pacific Fleet
commander, before hundreds of people gave the Soviet sailors a
rousing sendoff. ``Let this handshake become a warranty of good
naval (relations) and mutual understanding.''
   Larson said he shared with Khvatov everything he knew about
Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait earlier this week.
   The United States and the Soviet Union have jointly condemned
Iraq's aggression and called for the invaders to withdraw.
   Three Soviet ships visited Norfolk, Va., last July and three
U.S. warships visited the Black Sea port of Sevastopol last August.
Larson is scheduled to take three ships from the U.S. Pacific Fleet
to Vladivostok, the Soviet Union's main Pacific port, on a similar
visit next month.

<HEAD>Advisory Council Calls for Further Study of Proposed Art Grants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Council on the Arts on Saturday
called for further study of five controversial grant proposals that
a panel of artists had recommended for approval by the National
Endowment for the Arts.
   The advisory panel voted to put off consideration of the grants
on procedural grounds, allowing the endowment to postpone action on
the grant applications during the ongoing debate over public
financing of controversial art that some deem obscene.
   Acting at the urging of NEA Chairman John Frohnmayer, the
council backed a plan to study whether there had been a conflict of
interest involving the peer panel of artists that reviewed the
grant applications. The proposed grants for performance artists
Karen Finley and Holly Hughes and three other groups are to be
reconsidered at the council's next meeting in November.
   The council also voted to approve two $40,000 grants to
Philadelphia's Institute of Contemporary Art, which had organized
the photography exhibit by Robert Mapplethorpe that some members of
Congress considered obscene. The council at an earlier meeting had
recommended that the applications be rejected.

   Thousands of admirers of the Queen Mother, one
carrying a banner reading ``Happy Birthday Grandmother England,''
gathered outside her home Saturday to help celebrate her 90th
birthday.
   The Queen Mother marked the day serenaded by a band and
surrounded by her royal family.
   The indefatigable mother of Queen Elizabeth II was greeted with
wake-up music by pipers playing Scottish airs. Her day was climaxed
by an unannounced evening visit to the Royal Opera House to watch
the Royal Ballet's performance of Prokofiev's ``Romeo and Juliet.''
   In between, there was a 41-gun salute in Hyde Park followed by a
62-gun salute at the Tower of London, a peal of bells at St. Paul's
Cathedral and a special birthday tribute from Poet Laureate Ted
Hughes.
   Crowds of fans, some of whom had camped out overnight to get a
good view of the dowager queen, were rewarded when she stepped onto
the geranium-framed balcony of her London home to wave and smile.
   ``For me, she is everything that belongs to Britain. She's the
figurehead, the grandmother to us all. She's absolutely
wonderful,'' said Emily Coughlin, who had waited outside Clarence
House since Thursday.
   The Band of the Coldstream Guards played ``Happy Birthday'' as
the Queen mother appeared, dressed in a triple strand of pearls, a
powder-blue dress with a matching coat and matching hat decked with
flowers and a veil.
   Dozens of well-mannered children gathered around her, offering
balloons and bouquets of flowers. She gently patted the shoulder of
each.
   Looking cool and relaxed despite the heat, the ``Queen Mum''
spent nearly a half-hour shaking hands and saying ``thank you'' to
the crowd lined up along police barricades on the Clarence House
grounds.
   The Queen Mother was joined for lunch by the rest of the royal
family, including Queen Elizabeth II, Princess Margaret, her
grandchildren and great grandchildren.
   Five months ago, the Queen Mother protested that she wanted her
90th birthday to pass without ``fuss.'' Since then, there have been
a crescendo of parties, celebrations and a giant parade through
central London.
   Born Aug. 4, 1900, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon was the vivacious and
dainty daughter of one of Scotland's most celebrated families.
   Some Scots thought she was marrying beneath her when she wed the
second son of the Hanoverian dynasty, Albert. But when Edward
abdicated to wed the divorcee Wallis Warfield Simpson, Albert was
crowed King George VI.
   He died of lung cancer in 1952.
   Over the decades, she has become a symbol for many of Britain's
best qualities _ its dignity, strength and sense of humor.

<HEAD>Forty-two Aliens Detained at Ice Cream Warehouse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>

   Immigration agents arrested 42 undocumented
workers who allegedly paid the smugglers for the trip from Mexico
by turning over earnings they gained from pushing ice cream vending
carts, officials said.
   Agents also arrested a manager and supervisor of the Delicias de
Michoacan warehouse, which district immigration director Robert
Moschorak said was the final destination of a network bringing
undocumented workers from Mexico.
   ``They were being smuggled into the United States, transported
to this location and harbored there,'' he said. ``The initial
indications are that some paid as much as $1,500 to get here.''
   Some aliens were allowed to pay back the smugglers by selling
ice cream and frozen fruit bars known as paletas from push carts,
Moschorak said.
   Gus Mora, whose family owns Delicias de Michoacan, denied the
firm was involved in smuggling aliens. He described the raid Friday
as a ``witch hunt.''

   Two top organized crime leaders who disappeared
in May shortly before their indictment on racketeering charges are
probably hiding in New York, according to a report published Sunday.
   The two fugitives, Vittorio ``Vic'' Amuso, who prosecutors say
is the boss of the Lucchese crime family, and Anthony ``Gaspipe''
Casso, allegedly the Lucchese underboss, have eluded arrest for two
months.
   Jules J. Bonavolonta, the head of the FBI's organized-crime
branch in the city, told The New York Times that agents will
intensify the search for Amuso and Casso.
   Both men are probably ``squirreled away'' in the New York City
area and still issuing orders, he said.
   Amuso, Casso and 13 other reputed organized crime leaders were
indicted by a federal grand jury on May 30. They were accused of
conspiracy and extortion in rigging bids on $142 million in window
contracts awarded by the Housing Authority from 1978 to last year.
   Casso was also indicted on June 21 on charges of being part of a
separate conspiracy to control the bidding for painting contracts
in the city. Amuso was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in
that case.

   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
scheduled a meeting with President Bush and then set the world's
problems aside to discuss physics with some of the field's top
researchers Saturday.
   Mrs. Thatcher, with her son, Mark, by her side, shared an
afternoon tea with researchers at the Aspen Center for Physics and
talked about developments in research ranging from neurobiology to
cosmology to quasi-crystals, a new and much-debated form of matter.
   ``We were all impressed with how interested she was,'' said Dr.
Jeremy Bernstein of the Stevens Institute of Technology. ``It was
as if the world had evaporated and we were (alone) in the
universe.''
   The 1{-half hour meeting was ``magnificent,'' said Mrs.
Thatcher, who was trained as a chemist. ``It was very exciting.''
   Despite repeated questioning from reporters, Mrs. Thatcher
declined to comment on developments in Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, other
than to say, ``I have a very good rule. First find the facts. It's
worked well for me in over 31 years in Parliament.''
   Earlier Saturday, the Defense Ministry in London said Iraqi
troops took 35 British servicemen acting as advisers to Kuwaiti
forces from their homes in Kuwait. It said they later were flown to
Baghdad. The servicemen were among 66 British military advisers in
Kuwait.
   The institute's symposium, which celebrates its 40th
anniversary, has been overshadowed by the Iraqi occupation of
Kuwait since it opened Thursday.
   Prior to giving the keynote address at the institute's session
Thursday, President Bush met with Mrs. Thatcher privately. He then
cut his trip short to return to Washington, D.C., to work on the
Kuwaiti issues.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who arrived here Wednesday, originally was to
have stayed 10 days, combining business with pleasure on her first
trip to Colorado.
   But after speaking with White House officials, French President
Francois Mitterrand and members of the Saudi Arabian government on
Saturday, Mrs. Thatcher decided to leave Monday. She plans to meet
with Bush in the afternoon and continue on to London, where she is
expected to arrive early Tuesday.
   On Sunday, Mrs. Thatcher will give the closing address to the
institute on a topic that is expected to have a strong European
focus. She also will receive the institute's Statesman Award, which
only has been given twice in the nonprofit organization's 40-year
history.
   The other two recipients are Jean Monnet, the founder of
European economic integration and former West German Chancellor
Willy Brandt.
   Founded in 1950, the institute was created to gather leaders in
all fields to discuss ways to deal with the world's problems.

   The Senate approved a $289 billion defense
bill Saturday that cuts $1 billion from President Bush's request
for the Strategic Defense Initiative but leaves intact his fiscal
1991 proposal for two B-2 bombers.
   In a rush to finish before a summer recess, the Senate adopted,
79-16, a military budget that slashes $18 billion from Bush's
request of $307 billion for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   ``We have developed a manageable and prudent and responsible
reduction in defense expenditures related to the threat,'' Senate
Armed Services Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said shortly before the
chamber approved one of the first military budgets in the post-Cold
War era.
   The Senate package, adopted despite the threat of a presidential
veto, calls for a military personnel reduction of 100,000 and
elimination of $1.6 billion in procurement money for the MX
rail-garrison missile program.
   The White House has said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney would
recommend a presidential veto because of the SDI total and troop
cuts. The objection comes even though the Senate bill is considered
the high mark in Congress.
   The House, when it returns in September, will likely approve its
committee's version of a $283 billion defense bill.
   Senators lingered as legislative loners in the Capitol as House
members commenced their August recess in the early morning hours.
During a marathon session, they passed campaign finance `reform'
legislation, a bill containing assistance for areas hardest hit by
AIDS cases and an environnmental protection measure arising from
the Exxon Valdez oil spill off Alaska.
   Shortly before adjourning until Sept. 10, the Senate also passed
a bill appropriating roughly $28 billion for transportation
programs for the new year, including money for upgrading the
nation's airports, mass transit systems and Amtrak.
   And sources said that an intelligence budget for 1991 passed by
voice vote during the previous post-midnight session eliminates
U.S. support for a covert war in Cambodia and sharply restricts
money for rebels in Afghanistan. Many of the details in the bill
are secret since it authorizes some of the nation's most sensitive
covert operations.
   Passage of the defense bill came after the Senate voted to
restructure the SDI program, commonly known as Star Wars, by
delaying deployment of the ``Brilliant Pebbles'' concept.
   By a vote of 54-44, the Senate approved a restructuring
amendment that leaves intact the chamber's approved total of $3.7
billion for SDI _ $1 billion less than Bush proposed.
   However, the measure scales back the administration's request
for the Brilliant Pebbles concept from $329 million to $129 million.
   Nunn criticized the Pentagon for trying four different systems
for the SDI program in the past three years while Congress hasn't
received ``one clue from anybody in this administration'' on how to
pay for the anti-missile shield.
   ``No one can tell you where the money's coming from and yet
they're charging straight ahead,'' Nunn said, noting the likely
annual cost of $10 billion for SDI.
   The amendment comes on the heels of a congressional report that
found deploying the first phase of SDI in 1993 would be ``premature
and fraught with high risk.''
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, said that the introduction of Brilliant Pebbles has
drastically changed the SDI system's design, leaving it in a state
of flux. The technology involves several thousand interceptors that
would orbit the Earth to seek and destroy a target by smashing into
it at high speeds.
   A key sponsor, Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., said the amendment
would ``be rejecting early deployment of systems that would violate
the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.''
   The Senate later rebuffed two attempts to reduce the SDI budget
even further, including one that would have cut the 1991 budget to
about $3 billion.
   The defense bill deletes money for two SSN-21 Seawolf attack
submarines, replacing the request with two SSN-688 Los
Angeles-class attack submarines, and delays the C-17 transport
aircraft program.
   The bill also provides $238 million in research money for the
V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft _ a program Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney has tried to kill for the past two years.
   During three days of lengthy sessions, the Senate adopted by a
narrow margin, the president's request for $4.6 billion for two B-2
stealth bombers in fiscal 1991. Despite eroding support for the
costliest aircraft in history at $865 million a copy, the Senate
left intact Bush's budget proposal but required the program to pass
critical tests before money could be spent.
   The Senate decision sets up a confrontation with the House Armed
Services panel which agreed to halt the program at the 15
radar-evading planes in development.
   The bill also eliminated $1.6 billion in procurement money
requested in fiscal 1991 for the program to put MX nuclear missiles
on railroad cars. The Senate left intact the $548 million for
research on the system as well as the $202 million for the
Midgetman land-based nuclear missile.
   The House Armed Services Committee eliminated the
administration's request for both missiles and, instead, set up a
strategic pot of $610 million for the two weapons. The panel also
called on Bush to decide which missile he wants.
   The legislation calls for a cut of 100,000 military personnel,
including 50,000 from U.S. troop strength in Europe where the
committee believes ``the threat of a large-scale Warsaw Pact attack
against Western Europe has virtually been eliminated.''
   The nation's troop strength currently totals 2.1 million, a
number certain to decrease significantly in light of Bush's plan
announced Thursday to reduce U.S. forces 25 percent over the next
five years.
   Among the measures approved by the House and Senate late Friday
and early Saturday were these:
   _A House Democratic leadership-backed version of a campaign
finance package. Majority Democrats pushed aside proposals from
both Republicans and from within their own party and prevailed,
255-155.
   The bill, which now has to be reconciled with a Senate version,
would among other things limit House campaign spending to $715,000
per candidate.
   _A bill boosting the liability of shippers for the cost of
cleaning up oil spills and requiring new tankers to have
leak-resistant double hulls.
   _A measure providing more than $4 billion over five years to
help communities hardest hit by AIDS.
   _Emergency legislation providing the Treasury Department with
$72 billion in additional borrowing authority through Oct. 2.
   _An intelligence budget for 1991 that eliminates U.S. support
for a covert war in Cambodia and sharply restricts money for rebels
in Afghanistan, according to congressional sources.

<HEAD>Navy Investigates Cheating on Nuclear Reactor Safety Tests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy, investigating allegations of cheating
on nuclear reactor safety inspections aboard the USS Nimitz, has
restricted four crew members aboard ship.
   ``No charges have been filed,'' Navy spokesman Lt. Donald Thomas
said. ``This action is a standard precautionary measure taken to
ensure the presence of individuals until an investigation is
complete.''
   Four Nimitz sailors approached local news media last week and
said sailors aboard the Nimitz were cheating on inspections and
were overworked and insufficiently trained to react to a nuclear
accident.
   It wasn't known if the four restricted sailors were the same
ones who had approached the news media.
   The Nimitz is completing a month-long maintenance run at the
Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton.
   Thomas' comment came in written response to questions submitted
by KIRO-TV.
   The station aired a segment Thursday night in which the sailors
alleged crew members had cheated on reactor inspections, that some
nuclear operators had to work up to 100 hours a week in port, and
that many crew were not trained sufficiently to react to a nuclear
accident.
   The crew members, whose faces and voices were masked, also
alleged that some had considered disabling the reactor to ease
their heavy work schedule.
   One of the sailors later told The Associated Press that the
comment was not meant as a direct threat, but that overworked crew
members might resort to minor acts of sabotage to put their
commanding officers in a bad light.
   The sailor said the Nimitz was leaving Monday for a training
mission, which would last about a month. The Navy declined to
comment on the ship's movements.
   The Navy, in a response forwarded by Senior Chief Journalist
Gene Romano at Sand Point Naval Station in Seattle, acknowledged
that ``the upkeep period has been a demanding time with significant
effort required of the crew.
   ``Pressure to accomplish the work safely and on schedule is
naturally present but is no different from what a crew must
routinely contend with, whether in port or in combat training at
sea,'' it said. ``Under these circumstances, a lot is asked of _
and given by _ these dedicated individuals, and it is
understandable that they sometimes look for outlets to let off
steam.''
   The Navy said the ``reported allegations are vague and there are
few specifics on which to base a response. However, performance
standards on Nimitz are very high, and a continuing program of crew
training, testing and qualification is conducted with extensive
oversight. Widespread cheating is not possible.''

<TEXT>
   The Blackstone Group, a New York firm that
invests in corporate takeovers, is considering trying to buy
Greyhound Lines Inc. in a deal to end the six-month drivers'
strike, a partner in the firm said Friday.
   ``We are exploring the possibility,'' said partner Richard
Ravitch.
   Greyhound, America's only nationwide bus line, has been
operating under the protection of federal bankruptcy laws since
June.
   Any deal to take over the bus line would have to include the
return of the 6,300 union drivers who have been on strike since
March 2, Ravitch said.
   ``I think that it's fair to say the only viable deal is one in
which the union is a participant,'' Ravitch said.
   Greyhound spokesman George Gravley said he had never heard of
the firm and noted that under federal bankruptcy laws, the bus line
has until early October to file a reorganization plan and then
another 60 days to prove the reorganization will work.
   The company has no plans to voluntarily sell the bus line,
Gravley said.
   ``We are building cash balances. We're having a good summer.
Things are going pretty well. Business as usual has been our theme
song,'' Gravley said.
   Ravitch said the investment banking group was approached about
the deal by Greyhound's creditors. The bus line suffered a loss of
more than $50 million in the first three months of 1990 sought
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection June 4.
   Ravitch declined to elaborate on details of any deal, saying
only that the investment firm was ``trying to get data concerning
the company. We've had a discussion with the union and we're
proceeding.''
   An official with the Amalgamated Transit Union who asked to go
unnamed said the union is still interested in some type of employee
buyout.
   Blackstone considers the union's participation crucial, the ATU
official said, because union drivers are experienced and also
because returning them to work would alleviate millions of dollars
in porivers strike, which entered its sixth month on Thursday,
was marred by shootings, bomb threats and other violent incidents
in its first few months. The two sides have not set down to try and
negotiate a settlement since early May.

<TEXT>
   Authorities freed a student leader
jailed six weeks ago for his role in an anti-government protest,
and they indicated Friday that Marian Munteanu's arrested
colleagues may also be released.
   Munteanu called a news conference and pressed the government to
let them go.
   Prosecutor-General Gheorghe Robu told state-run radio that Nica
Leon, Dumitru Dinca and other leaders of the 53-day demonstration
``may also be released.'' But he said investigation of their
activities was continuing.
   Like Munteanu, their detention began in mid-June, when police
violently dispersed the protest in University Square in the center
of Bucharest.
   The crackdown set off attacks on government buildings by angry
crowds, and President Ion Iliescu called in miners to come to the
aid of the government. The miners terrorized the city in a two-day
rampage against people they saw as government opponents. Six people
were killed, according to the official count.
   Robu said Munteanu was released late Thursday because conditions
had changed there no longer was reason to fear he would disturb the
peace.
   Late Friday night, about 100 demonstrators gathered briefly in
University Square for the fourth time this week, chanting ``Down
with Communism!'' and ``Down with Iliescu!''
   Munteanu, president of the Bucharest University student league,
said he now believes ``justice will be done ... and the others will
be released.''
   Describing his imprisonment, Munteanu said Friday: ``It was a
nightmare. ... The food, the people around me, everything. These
six weeks of detention have aged me many years. I am physically
weak; I feel 80 years old.''
   The 28-year-old student leader was badly beaten by the miners
and hospitalized last June. He was arrested days later.
   Munteanu said the 53-day rally was not anti-government, but
pro-democracy. The protesters said former Communists play too large
a role in Romania's government and that former Communist Iliescu
should quit.
   Iliescu won in elections last May, following Romania's December
revolution in which Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was
overthrown and executed.
   The state news agency Rompres reported Friday that former
Communist official Nicolae Giosan died of cardiac arrest this week
in prison.
   Giosan was on trial with 23 other Ceausescu aides for complicity
in genocide. The charges relate to security force efforts to quell
the revolution.
   Col. Gen. Iulian Vlad, head of Ceausescu's feared Securitate
secret police, was arraigned Friday before a military court on
charges of complicity in genocide, Rompres said.
   His trial begins Sept. 10. Conviction could mean life
imprisonment.

   The invasion of Kuwait by Iraq produced a rapid rise in prices
at the gas pumps for many Americans. Here is a brief look at some
of the increases:
   _A survey of 1,400 retail gasoline stations by the American
Automobile Association showed self-serve unleaded gasoline prices
had gone up 4 cents in two days, to an average of $1.115 a gallon.
At some stations, the price of a gallon increased as much as 14
cents.
   _Increases at the pump followed wholesale price hikes by the
major oil companies. Mobil Oil Corp. raised its prices an average
of 3.5 cents a gallon; Chevron Corp. hiked its price 5 cents; BP
America Inc. had a 4-to-5-cent rise; Texaco raised its prices as
much as 7 cents a gallon; and other firms also posted increases.
   _Wholesale unleaded gasoline for September delivery soared 4.11
cents to 72.18 cents a gallon, on top of a 3.80-cent rise Thursday.
   _The September contract for home heating oil picked up 1.89
cents to close at 66.58 cents a gallon after a 3.50-cent gain
Thursday. Natural gas for September delivery rose to $1.510 per
1,000 cubic feet from Thursday's $1.432.

and Exchange Commission.
   Roberts, a former chief of staff to Sen. Richard Shelby, D-Ala.,
would fill the seat of Joseph Grundfest, who left the five-member
commission in January.
   The nomination is subject to confirmation by the Senate. No date
for confirmation hearings was set.
   The SEC regulates the stocks and bonds, the exchanges that trade
in them and other financial markets such as mutual funds.
   The chairman and four commissioners, all appointed by the
president, serve five-year terms.
   Roberts, 39, a native of Birmingham, Ala., served 4{ years as
Shelby's legislative aide in the House of Representatives and from
January 1987 to April 1990 after Shelby was elected to the Senate.
   Roberts graduated in 1973 from Auburn University with an
engineering degree. He received law degrees from the University of
Alabama School of Law in 1976 and George Washington University in
1981.
   He left Shelby's staff in April to join the law firm of Miller,

   President Bush will nominate former New
Hampshire attorney general Thomas D. Rath to the board of directors
of the Legal Services Corp., the White House announced Friday.
   Rath, a Republican now in private practice in Concord, N.H., is
a close friend and former deputy to David H. Souter, Bush's Supreme
Court nominee.
   Rath would succeed former Illinois GOP congressman John N.
Erlenborn on the board that oversees the Legal Services Corp.,
which provides legal aid for the poor. It has long been a lightning
rod for criticism from conservatives.
   Conservatives have sought to abolish the agency since the outset
of the Reagan administration. They object in particular to Legal
Services lawyers' helping poor people file class action lawsuits
against the government over welfare benefits and other programs.
   Bush also announced plans to nominate seven people who have been
serving on the Legal Services board as recess appointees since Jan.
22. They now will face Senate confirmation.
   They are: former Rep. Guy Molinari, now borough president of
Staten Island, N.Y.; Jo Betts Love of Mississippi; Jeanine E.
Wolbeck of Minnesota; Howard H. Dana Jr. of Portland, Maine; Luis
Guinot Jr. of Puerto Rico; Penny L. Pullen, Republican leader of
the Illinois House, and George W. Wittgraf of Cherokee, Iowa.
   Also on Friday, Bush nominated a career diplomat, Arlene Render,
to be ambassador to Gambia. She is a former deputy chief of mission
in Accra, Ghana.
   The White House also announced Bush will nominate:
   _Richard Y. Roberts, a Washington lawyer, to the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
   _Paula J. Dobriansky, a deputy assistant secretary of state for
human rights, to be the U.S. Information Agency's associate
director for programs.
   _Juliette Clagett McLennan, of Washington, D.C., for the rank of
ambassador while serving as U.S. representative to the United
Nations Commission on the Status of Women.
   _Jean C. Hamilton, a Missouri Court of Appeals judge from St.
Louis, to be a U.S. District Judge for the eastern district of
Missouri.
   _Gary L. Taylor, a Superior Court judge in Orange County,
Calif., to be a U.S. District Judge for the central district of
California. He is from Villa Park, Calif.
   _James Ware, a Superior Court judge in Santa Clara County,
Calif., to be a U.S. District judge for the northern district of
California. He is from Mountain View, Calif.
   _William B. Shubb, a lawyer from Sacramento, to be U.S. District
Judge for the eastern district of California. He is a former U.S.
attorney.
   _Antonio C. Amador, of Sacramento, Calif., to the Merit Systems
Protection Board. He is deputy director of the program review
branch with the state employment department.
   _Howard E. Simmons, a vice president for research at the Dupont
Co. in Wilmington, Del., to the National Science Board of the
National Science Foundation.
   _Cheryl Feldman Halpern of Livingston, N.J., and Karl C. Rove,
of Austin, Texas, to the Board for International Broadcasting.
   _Carol K. DiPrete of Bristol, R.I., and J. Michael Farrell of
Washington, D.C., to the National Commission on Libraries and
Information Science.
   _Fitzhugh Green and Tom C. Korologos, of Washington, D.C., to
the U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy. Green is the

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Soldiers removed seven more
bodies Friday from a bombed police station, the Parliament and a TV
building, raising to at least 38 the death toll from a failed coup
attempt and subsequent looting.
   Moslem extremists held hostages for six days before surrendering
Wednesday.
   Army spokesman Maj. Dave Williams said seven additional bodies
were recovered by noon from wrecked buildings.
   Authorities also said that a fire of undetermined origin
destroyed a storage area and an apartment Thursday night at the
Jamaat al-Muslimeen commune's compound on the outskirts of
Port-of-Spain, the capital of this Caribbean island.
   Abu Bakr, the commune's leader, and 112 of his followers were
being held at army headquarters after giving up on Wednesday and
releasing their remaining 46 hostages. Prime Minister Arthur N.R.
Robinson and several of his Cabinet ministers were among the total
of 55 hostages held by the rebels.
   Government spokesman Gregory Shaw has said the militants could
face a variety of charges, including murder, kidnapping and
treason, which carries the death penalty.
   Shaw said Jazeni Omowale, a 21-year-old student from Howard
University in Washington, D.C., had been killed Wednesday in a
gunfight involving police and soldiers in the capital's Champs
Fleurs suburb. He was believed to be Bakr's stepson. The
circumstances of the gunfight were unknown.
   For the first time since the siege began on July 27, soldiers
entered the Parliament building.
   Williams said the bodies of three civilians and one rebel were
removed from the building, along with homemade grenades and about
40 handguns.
   He said two other bodies were pulled from the rubble of the
police station. The building was demolished by a car bomb and fire
during the siege.
   A seventh body, that of a rebel, was discovered at the
government's television station, where 29 employees were held
captive. Police sealed off the television station to search for any
explosives left by rebels.
   Shaw said earlier at least 30 people were killed in the initial
assault by Bakr and his men and in subsequent looting. The
discovery of the bodies Friday and the killing of the American
student brought the total to 38.
   Lennox Williams, administrator of Port-of-Spain General
Hospital, said autopsies found at least 14 people died of gunshot
wounds. He said most were killed by security forces during looting.
   A state of emergency remained in effect Friday and soldiers and
police patrolled the capital. An 18-hour curfew was reduced to 10
a.m. to 6 p.m., however, and Shaw said banks would open Sunday to
help residents resume normal business as soon as possible.
   A 150-member regional force was dispatched to this island nation
of more than 1.2 million to guard installations and relieve the
local forces for patrols.
   Food and medical supplies were being flown in from the United
States, Canada and nearby Venezuela.

<HEAD>Sandinista Peasants Take Over Ranch, Strike Threat in Nicaragua</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Niaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sandinista peasants with machetes
seized a private ranch and Sandinista workers warned of a general
strike, working in unison to threaten anew on Friday the government
of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.
   About 60 campesinos took over the Santa Julia Ranch in Juigalpa,
120 miles southeast of Managua on Thursday night. Hours earlier,
the 150,000-member National Workers Front threatened its third and
largest labor action since the United National Opposition coalition
of Mrs. Chamorro took office on April 25.
   Ranch invasion leader Leopoldo Siles Blanco said the peasants
acted in retaliation for takeovers in recent weeks of Sandinista
cooperative farms.
   ``We are prepared to invade other private ranches,'' he said in
an interview.
   About 150 Sandinista peasants occupied Agriculture Minister
Roberto Rondon's ranch on Wednesday.
   Lucio Jimenez, leader of the National Workers Front, told a news
conference his federation plans a walkout of all Sandinista unions
because more than 1,000 government employees were fired despite
promises nobody would be laid off.
   Jimenez complained that currency devaluations over the last
three months have reduced the purchasing power of the 150,000
government workers by 90 percent despite pay raises.
   ``People can't pay for water (and) electricity'' because the
government has eliminated subsidies for public services in its
attempt to reduce its large financial deficit, he said.
   Jimenez also complained that despite an accord in which the
government promised not to privatize state-owned lands, large
farms, with machinery and silos, have been rented to ``large
landowners close to the government.''
   Six people were killed and about 100 injured in clashes between
Sandinista supporters and opponents in the last Sandinista-led
strike in July. The strikers erected barricades, paralyzing Managua
and disrupting the rest of the nation.
   Edgardo Garcia, chief of the Sandinista Farmworkers Association,
said the government has not lived up to agreements that ended the
July strike, including limits on the amount of land distributed by
Sandinistas that could be returned to former owners.
   Police spokesman Miguel Centeno said police lines were set up at
the private ranch owned by Chester Noguera, leader of the
Nicaraguan Farmers and Ranchers Federation, that was taken over
Thursday.
   Mrs. Chamorro's 14-party United National Opposition defeated the
Sandinistas in elections last February and took power in April in
this Central American nation of about 3.5 million people.
   Inflation and low farm production, caused by massive land
reform, are the two biggest problem she inherited from the
anti-U.S. Sandinistas, who ruled Nicaragua for a decade after
overthrowing dictator Anastasio Somoza.
   Thursday, the government devalued the cordoba by 7.7 percent,
the 27th devaluation since it took office as part of a
belt-tightening effort to keep the economy afloat.
   That brought the cordoba down to 560,000 to the dollar at the
official rate of exchange, and up to 670,000 on the black market.
   Mrs. Chamorro has been trying to return Nicaragua to a free
market economy, but strikes and strike threats have undermined her
efforts.
   Her government managed to eliminate government subsidies and
price controls. But this sent prices for staples skyrocketing.

<HEAD>Eastern's Union Pilots Authorize Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines remaining unionized pilots
have authorized their leadership to strike the airline if a
contract can't be reached by Aug. 11, the pilots' union said Friday.
   A spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association acknowledged a
strike would not pose much of an immediate threat to the carrier's
operations because there are few union pilots flying Eastern planes.
   Instead, the planes are being flown by pilots who crossed picket
lines that were up when Eastern pilots joined striking machinists
in a sympathy walkout last year.
   Still, ALPA spokesman John Mazor said a strike would be
significant because ``as much as anything else, a strike focuses
the attention of the public ... It creates a lot pressure on the
company.''
   Eastern pilots overwhelmingly authorized the strike through a
ballot taken at local council meetings Thursday night, ALPA said.
Contract talks are set to resume next week, the union said.
   On Thursday, a federal judge in Miami ruled that pilots who
struck Eastern and later offered to return to work are entitled to
replace the strike-breakers who were hired. They are also entitled
to back pay, the judge ruled.
   Eastern, which is still in the midst of bankruptcy proceedings,
said it would appeal the ruling.

<TEXT>
   Senate and House negotiators on clean air
legislation reached agreement Friday on a schedule for ending, by
the close of the decade, use of chemicals that damage the ozone
layer. But leaders acknowledged the most difficult issues of the
legislation have yet to be discussed.
   Among other provisions, the negotiators agreed to forbid states
and local governments from restricting or banning the chemicals for
two years.
   The conference committee is not scheduled to meet again until
after the August congressional recess. House and Senate staffers
were directed to work through the month to draft possible
compromises on various parts of the two bills.
   ``We don't have much time ahead of us,'' said Sen. Max Baucus,
D-Mont., the conference chairman, noting there are only 23
legislative days remaining until Congress is scheduled to adjourn
in early October.
   Negotiators said they hoped the agreement on ozone-destroying
chemicals would help break the deadlock.
   That agreement calls for phasing out such chemicals, including
chlorofluorocarbons, halons and carbon tetrachloride, widely used
as coolants, solvents and foam blowing agents, by the end of the
decade.
   Some substitute chemicals that are less harmful to the
environment such as HCFCs _ chlorofluorocarbons that contain one or
more hydrogen atoms _ would be phased out over the next 40 years.
   The measure also calls for recylcing of these chemicals by 1992,
and the installation of precautions to prevent routine release into
the air.
   The ban on local action will affect at least 17 states and
communities that have acted on their own in various ways to
restrict the use of ozone-depleting chemicals.
   The compromise substantially mirrors requirements in the
Montreal Protocol, the international treaty on ozone-depleting
chemicals.
   The House and Senate conferees have been struggling for nearly a
month in an attempt to reconcile different bills approved by the
House and Senate that would impose tougher air pollution controls
on automobiles, industry and electric utilities.
   But so far the two sides have not even discussed specific
compromises on the most controversial areas of the bills, including
what smog-reducing controls to impose on automobiles and how
industry must cut toxic chemical emissions.
   At Friday's session, the House and Senate members had trouble
even agreeing what issues staff members should discuss during the
August recess.
   The ozone layer 25 miles or so above the earth protects living
organisms from the harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun, which can
cause skin cancer. The normally inert chemicals in question last so
long in the atmosphere that they eventually rise to to ozone layer,
where ultraviolet light breaks them down and liberates chlorine
that destroys ozone.

<HEAD>Sri Lanka Troops Kill About 30 Tamil Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A navy patrol boat bombarded a bunker
of Tamil Tigers on the rebel-held Jaffna Peninsula, killing at
least 10 people, military officials said Friday.
   The deaths were among 32 reported in north and east Sri Lanka in
the previous 24 hours, the officials said on condition of anonymity.
   It was the first time since the civil war resumed on June 11 in
this Indian Ocean island nation, just off India, that the navy
attacked rebel positions.
   Sailors from the boat launched a surprise ground attack Thursday
on the shores of Karainagar in the peninsula, 185 miles north of
Colombo.
   The Tamil Tigers have been fighting since 1983 to set up an
independent nation in Sri Lanka. Separatists complain of
discrimination in jobs and education by the majority Sinhalese.
   Communications with the rebels have been cut since fighting
broke out, and government accounts can rarely be independently
confirmed.
   In northeastern Trincomalee district, soldiers killed nine
insurgents after an abortive Tiger attempt to blow up a bridge at
Palanpattu village.
   Police commandos also killed eight rebels trying to escape
across a lagoon in Batticaloa on the east coast. Three other rebels
were killed elsewhere in government attacks, and rebels shot and
killed two civilians at Majidpuran village in eastern Ampara
district, the officials said.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people. The
Sinhalese, who dominate the government and the military, account
for 75 percent.
   More than 14,000 people have been killed in the 7-year-old Tamil
revolt.

   The highest temperature in Britain's history was
recorded Friday when the mercury hit 99 degrees, the Meteorological
Office said.
   Weather stations in Cheltenham, 80 miles west of London, and in
Nailstone, 95 miles northwest of London, both registered the record
high.
   The highest temperature previously recorded was 98 on Aug. 9,
1911, at both Epsom, 15 miles southwest of London and Canterbury,
55 miles east of London.
   Police walking the beat in Cheltenham were allowed to patrol
without neckties.
   Brenda Wren, manager of the Bayshill Inn, said, ``I've done
nothing but guzzle all day. You need to keep drinking almost
non-stop to prevent yourself dehydrating.''
   At Peter's Bar, the pub across the road, manager Chris Giles
said: ``It's been so hot that I've had great difficulty persuading
the customers to keep their clothes on. They all want to strip
off!''
   In Nailstone, the weather was the chief topic of conversation in
the sleepy village's one shop and two pubs.
   ``It's just ever so hot,'' said a store owner, Joy Lawrence.
   London's high on Friday was a steamy 95, bringing complaints
about the heat and air pollution from residents more accustomed to
cool mist and fog.
   The hot weather has brought a huge Caribbean turtle to the
English Channel. The 6-foot-by-7-foot turtle was spotted off Dorset
feeding on jellyfish.
   Marine specialists said other sea-borne migrants, such as the
thresher shark and sun fish, have been drawn off course by the
unusually warm weather.
   Airliners headed for the northern runway of London's Heathrow
Airport had to change course three days this week after high
temperatures caused the newly laid tarmac to buckle.
   Walkers in the picturesque Lake District in northwest England
were ``dropping like flies,'' said Stuart Hulse, of the Langdale
and Ambleside mountain rescue team.
   Operators of Wookey Hole Caves in southwest England reported
record business for tours. The caves never vary from a 55 degrees.

<TEXT>
   The bludgeoned body of a Palestinian man
suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities was found early
Friday, hours after masked Arabs kidnapped him from his West Bank
home.
   The death of 43-year-old Majid Darwish in the Tulkarem refugee
camp in the Israeli-occupied West Bank came amid efforts by
Palestinian leaders to try to reduce such killings.
   Darwish's death raised to at least 244 the number of
Palestinians slain by fellow Arabs during the 31-month-old
Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied
territories. Most of the victims have been accused of collaboration.
   Another 725 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or
civilians in the rebellion, and 45 Israelis have died.
   Arab reports said Darwish was taken from his home by masked
activists identified as members of the ``Black Tigers'' gang.
   The masked men later marched through the camp with loudspeakers
announcing that Darwish had been killed for collaboration,
residents said. His body was found with extensive beating and
stabbing wounds, they said.
   The army command confirmed the death and said police were
investigating.
   Palestinian leaders, alarmed at the rise in killings of
suspected collaborators, have tried to intervene.
   A leaflet issued earlier this week by the PLO-linked underground
leadership of the uprising said a committee was being formed ``to
establish legal procedures ... including those which pertain to
interrogations.''
   The leaflet condemned torture in interrogations of suspected
collaborators and called for ``correct methods'' to be used.
   Past statements by leaders of the Palestine Liberation
Organization have sought to limit such killings, but they have
never been banned outright.

<HEAD>Romania Reports Big Increase in AIDS Cases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 7,000 new cases of AIDS were reported to
the World Health Organization in July, increasing the global total
to 273,425 since records began.
   An AIDS update, published Friday, showed 741 cases registered in
Romania at the end of June, up from 74 cases recorded in February.
   Of these, 687 were children under the age of 13. Figures showed
18 of the young victims picked up the disease from their mothers
and the rest were infected by contaminated needles and blood in
hospitals and orphanages.
   The United States notified WHO of 3,496 new cases in July,
raising the registered number of U.S. victims to 137,385 since
reporting began in 1981.
   The number of reported cases underestimates the true extent of
the disease, especially in Africa, WHO officials said. They believe
the actual total is two to three times higher.
   The WHO report covers only victims of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome and not people infected with the Human Immunodeficiency
Virus, HIV, which precedes full-blown AIDS.
   The United Nations on Wednesday said an estimated 8 million to
10 million people may already carry the HIV virus, spread by sexual
contact, infected syringes, contaminated blood and by pregnant
women to their babies.
   The latest figure is 2 million higher than previous estimates.
WHO said the increase was because of the unexpectedly swift spread
of the disease in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia.
   The report warned that existing predictions of 15 million to 20
million HIV infections by the year 2000 may also be too low.
   AIDS is a disease in which a virus attacks the body's immune
system, leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections
and cancers.

<TEXT>
   At a Manhattan brokerage firm, the grins and
groans of a dozen men watching the tickertape Friday told the story
of the ``tickemania'' that characterized the roller coaster ride of
stocks following events in the Persian Gulf.
   As the market plunged Friday, Angelo Falco made light of Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein's decision to invade Kuwait and a prediction
by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze that Iraq would
quickly back out.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if guys like Hussein, Shevardnadze
were playing the market this week,'' he said, evoking some nervous
laughter among other investors gathered inside Charles Schwab &amp; Co.
Inc. at the World Trade Center.
   Another man, frowning one moment, was smiling the next as he
speculated that the prediction by Shevardnadze had caused the
market to rebound 35 points in five minutes. He couldn't believe
how quickly the numbers were changing.
   He pointed at one stock, noting that it stood at $6 a share just
moments after it had been $11 per share.
   ``Eleven, now it's only six. Half price. Half price,
unbelievable!'' he shouted. The others focused on the numbers, like
gamblers around a casino table.
   It's typical to hear ``a lot of gallows humor'' on a day like
Friday, Falco said, when the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
was down 54.95 points after falling 120 points.
   ``They're kidding and laughing knowing they're losing thousands
of dollars an hour,'' he said. ``Most people are taking a good
dunking today.''
   Robert A. Burke, editor of an investment trade paper ``Eye On
Wall Street,'' watched with detached amusement as a steady stream
of men took their turns at the computers.
   ``I call these guys tickaholics. The disease is tickemania,'' he
said.
   Most of them were the kind of investors who viewed stocks with
the same enthusiasm of those bitten by ``Lotto fever,'' he said.
   ``Everybody in America wants to get rich quick,'' he said.
``These guys are gambling. Once in a while they'll get lucky. Years
ago there used to be millions of these guys but the stock market
crashed and they all got wiped out.''
   Burke attributed the sudden downfall in the market to the
announcement Thursday that unemployment had risen to 5.5 percent,
its highest level in two years, as well as the Iraqi invasion and a
revision of the Gross National Product last week.

<HEAD>Florida Declares Victory, Notes California Still Warring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florida declared victory over the Mediterranean
fruit fly Friday, and agricultural officials gloated that they had
swiftly crushed the insects while California was fighting a
protracted battle.
   On April 16, a fruit fly was found in a trap near Miami
International Airport. Within a week, the state Agriculture
Department launched an extensive trapping and spraying program to
keep the infestation localized and then eradicate it.
   ``Our immediate reaction upon discovery of the Medfly and our
all-out effort ... provides a vivid contrast between Florida's
eradication program and what's happening in California,'' said
Agriculture Commissioner Doyle Conner in a statement.
   Florida's effort took less than four months, cost less than $1.6
million and was confined to a 20-square-mile area, he said.
   In contrast, California's infestation has been going on for a
year, has spread to more than 900 square miles and already has cost
more than $38 million, Conner said.
   He noted Florida and California ``are both states with large
production of fruits and vegetables so essential to our nation's
health and are both very vulnerable with long coastlines,
deep-water ports, international airports and traverlers.
   ``Yet we in Florida have been successful in Medfly eradication''
in a short period, he said.
   Unlike California, where aerial malathion spraying produced a
continuing public outcry, the spraying in Virginia Gardens, Miami
Springs and parts of Hialeah northwest of Miami went on with little
fuss, although some resistance developed as the spraying continued.
   The aim of Florida's battle, which included eight aerial
treatments in seven-day cycles, compared to 21-day cycles in
California, was to wipe out the invasion as quickly as possible,
Conner said.
   Medflies lay eggs in host fruit and vegetables, and their larvae
feed on the pulp. It is considered the most destructive farm pest
because it can attack 250 different varieties of fruit and
vegetables.

of a defendant in the Enrique Camarena murder case because a
newspaper article allegedly found in the jury room may have
influenced deliberations.
   Edward Medvene, the attorney for Ruben Zuno Arce, also claimed
government officials may have influenced the jury by conducting
``some sort of formal monitoring system in order to allegedly
ensure the jurors' safety.''
   Medvene also alleged members of the U.S. Marshal's staff walked
in and out of the jury deliberation room on a regular basis and
that one of them asked the jurors when they were going to come back
with a verdict.
   ``It is clear that any consideration by the jurors of
information outside of the record and not in evidence is improper
and may well have affected their deliberations and@or verdict
regarding Zuno Arce,'' the motion said.
   Zuno, the brother-in-law of former Mexican President Luis
Echeverria, was found guilty Tuesday of kidnapping, racketeering
and aiding and abetting the escape of a fugitive. He was acquitted
of murder.
   The jury is still considering charges against one defendant,
Javier Vasquez Velasco, charged with the murder of two American
tourists.
   There were hints of problems with the jury on Thursday when U.S.
District Judge Edward Rafeedie summoned them individually into his
chambers for questioning.
   Medvene said lawyers were not notified about the problems, which
turned out to be the discovery of a newspaper article about Zuno.
   Under questioning, the lawyer said, one juror admitted that the
panel ``did consider information outside the record during the
course of their deliberations.''
   Specifically, Medvene said the juror told of a discussion among
panelists in the jury room about an article which appeared in the
Los Angeles Times after last week's conviction of defendant Juan
Ramon Matta Ballesteros.
   The motion did not say what the discussion was about.
   The jury convicted Matta, a Honduran business tycoon and
convicted drug kingpin, of racketeering, conspiracy and kidnapping,
but acquitted him of the murder of Camarena, the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration agent slain in Mexico in 1985.
   The jury also convicted former Mexican policeman Juan Jose
Bernabe Ramirez of kidnapping, but found him innocent of murder.

   Prime Minister V.P. Singh won a vote of
confidence from his governing coalition Friday, ending a political
crisis over his dismissal of Devi Lal, a powerful deputy prime
minister.
   ``There was no dissent,'' said Ram Jethmalani, a senior leader
of the Janata Dal party, after an hourlong meeting of Parliament
members and other leaders of the governing National Front coalition.
   Singh fired Devi Lal on Wednesday, a move that could have split
the Janata Dal and toppled the government. Fears eased Thursday
after senior party leaders and Devi Lal said they supported Singh's
action.
   Devi Lal, a popular rural politician who was No. 2 man in the
government until his dismissal from the Cabinet, said he would
return to power, but would not try to divide the Janata Dal.
   Singh ordered Devi Lal's dismissal for circulating an allegedly
forged letter that accused a Cabinet rival of accepting kickbacks
from multinational firms.
   He also criticized Devi Lal's interview with a weekly news
magazine, in which Devi Lal called Singh ``spineless'' and
described other Cabinet ministers as ``wimps and cheerleaders.''

<HEAD>Forecasters Say Cesar Likely To Veer Northwest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tropical Storm Cesar moved steadily over the open
Atlantic Ocean on Friday and forecasters said it likely would veer
to the northwest, diminishing the threat to the U.S. mainland.
   The tropical storm born in coastal African waters was about
1,100 miles west of the Cape Verde islands over open waters, moving
toward the west-northwest at 12 mph with sustained winds near 46
miles per hour. Little change in strength was expected.
   ``It seems like it will continue to move over open waters,''
said hurricane specialist Lixion Avila at the National Hurricane
Center. ``In the next 72 hours it should move more to the
northwest. There is a very small probability that it will turn back
to the west.''
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Cesar's center was located near 19.9 latitude
north and 41.7 longitude west, about 1,100 miles miles west of the
Cape Verde Islands.
   The fourth tropical depression of the Atlantic hurricane season,
Cesar grew from a tropical wave that formed Wednesday afternoon.
   Tropical depressions become named storms when their top
sustained winds reach 39 mph. The Atlantic hurricane season runs
from June 1 through Nov. 30.

<HEAD>Governor Seeks Disaster Status for Chicago's Blackout Area</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. James R. Thompson on Friday asked for
federal disaster relief for businesses on Chicago's West Side that
were hit by a three-day blackout last weekend.
   In a letter to the U.S. Small Business Administration, Thompson
said it is ``crucial'' that the government help the 40,000 utility
customers _ including 2,000 small businesses _ affected by the
blackout.
   ``This area of the city is particularly depressed economically;
a large portion of the residents are receiving public assistance,''
he wrote. ``Federal involvement in the form of subsidized loans is
crucial.''
   Mayor Richard M. Daley said losses from the blackout may amount
to millions of dollars.
   Meanwhile, a spokesman for Commonwealth Edison Co. disputed a
lawsuit filed by the city Thursday that charges the utility's was
negligent in failing to properly maintain a transformer.
   Edison spokesman John Hogan said there was no evidence of
negligence.
   ``They seem to be jumping to conclusions that no investigator
has come to yet,'' Hogan said. ``In the absence of any proof of
negligence, the courts have historically thrown these types of
cases out.''
   Alderman Jesus Garcia filed the action, asking for unspecified
damages for the 38,000 residential customers and 2,000 businesses
that lost power after a fire in utility equipment on Saturday.
   ``This is not an act of God,'' said James Fennerty, an attorney
who filed the lawsuit. ``It could have been prevented. It should
have been prevented. There must have been some negligence, even if
we can't prove it.''
   Garcia said if the plaintiffs are successful in court,
restitution could range from $50 for residents to several thousand
dollars for businesses that lost sales and perishable items.

   In the superpowers' first joint sanctions against
a war, the United States and Soviet Union have urged a world
embargo of weapons sales to Iraq and demanded that the Baghdad
government pull its troops out of Kuwait.
   ``We have been assured that very soon the Iraqis will pull out
their troops,'' Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told a
Friday news conference with U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker
III at his side. He said the Soviets received the assurances
through contacts in Baghdad.
   Later Friday an Iraqi government spokesman said Iraqi troops
will begin withdrawing from Kuwait on Sunday, Baghdad Radio
announced. Iraq claimed the decision was not because of
international pressure.
   It was a historic case of the superpowers acting together to try
to end hostilities.

   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait already is costing
U.S. motorists more at the gas pump. Some elected officials,
service-station owners and motorists are accusing oil companies of
price gouging.
   A survey of 1,400 retail gasoline stations nationwide showed
self-serve unleaded gasoline prices increased 4 cents in two days,
to an average of $1.11 a gallon, the American Automobile
Association said Friday.
   Spot checks by AAA clubs in Florida, Michigan, Missouri, North
Carolina, South Carolina and the Washington, D.C., area Friday
showed retail prices shot up 4 to 14 cents a gallon, the
association said.
   In Wisconsin, ``prices are just jumping up like crazy,''
sometimes increasing every 12 hours, said Robert Park, director of
trade practices in the Department of Agriculture, Trade and
Consumer Protection. Increases as high as 10 cents a gallon were
reported and further hikes were expected today, he said. Major oil
companies increased wholesale prices, blaming surging energy
markets. Prices for crude oil, gasoline and home heating oil
futures rose for a second day Friday because of uncertainty about
future Mideast supplies.

   A new technique that allows diagnosis of
inherited diseases in an unfertilized human egg before conception
is being described as an important step toward the prevention of
genetic diseases.
   On Friday, researchers reported that they had diagnosed cystic
fibrosis in a human egg before conception. They said the technique
could be used with many other inherited ailments, including
muscular dystrophy, hemophilia and sickle cell anemia.
   The technique could satisfy some abortion opponents' objections
to fetal diagnosis, said Yury Verlinsky, director of the
Reproductive Genetics Institute at Illinois Masonic Medical Center
in Chicago.
   These diseases can now be diagnosed in the fetus before birth.
But such diagnosis often leaves the parents with no option but to
terminate the pregnancy if the fetus carries the disease.

   The resignation of the nation's highest-ranking
black Roman Catholic clergyman because he was intimate with a woman
has renewed debate over mandatory celibacy for priests and raised
fears of a racial backlash.
   Atlanta Archbishop Eugene Marino resigned last month because of
his two-year relationship with a lay minister, Vicki R. Long,
church officials confirmed this week. They previously said he
resigned for health reasons.
   Ms. Long, 27, has filed a monetary claim against the archdiocese
for an undisclosed amount.
   Neither Marino nor Ms. Long have commented about their
relationship. Bishop James P. Lyke, the acting administrator of the
Atlanta Archdiocese, would not say whether the relationship was
sexual, describing it only as ``intimate.''
   Church officials and theologians say Marino's prominence will
provoke debate over church law dating to the Middle Ages requiring
Catholic clergy to abstain from sex. Pope John Paul II strongly
supports the requirement.

<HEAD>Foreigners Likely To Return For Quarterly Auction, Economists Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite foreign investors' recent disinterest in
U.S. Treasury securities, economists expect them to resume buying
at the upcoming quarterly auction of new notes and bonds.
   Foreign investors sold more Treasury securities than they bought
in the first quarter of 1990, the first time there were net sales
since the third quarter of 1988, according to the Securities
Industry Association.
   But Nicholas Sargen, an international economist at Solomon
Brothers Inc., said, ``To the extent we've gotten (past)
participation ... I wouldn't be surprised to see some buying'' at
the auction.
   The U.S. Treasury is scheduled to sell a record $32.25 billion
of three- and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds Tuesday, Wednesday
and Thursday to help refinance the federal deficit.
   This quarter's amount surpasses last quarter's record $30.5
billion
   Sargen said that while the trend has been toward less foreign
buying in the U.S. Treasuries market, foreign investors,
particularly Japanese, try to concentrate their buying on the
refunding.
   As broker-dealers they are obligated to make a bid at the
auction. Also, those seeking liquidity usually choose to buy the
latest issue.
   Foreign investors' reasons for staying away from the U.S. market
have been good _ yields on government bonds in other countries
offer them better returns.
   For instance, this past week, West Germany's 10-year bond was
yielding 8{ percent, about 0.16 percentage point more than the U.S.
10-year note. Also, the spread between the U.S. 10-year note and
the comparable Japanese bond has been narrowing.
   Most notably Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore and
Australia, sold $6.5 billion more U.S. Treasury securities than
they bought in the first three months of the year, according to the
SIA.
   But economists warn that foreign investors, who are spreading
the word they might not do much buying during the auction, could be
trying to push down the price so they can get bargains and higher
yields.
   ``You never know until the actual event to what extent they
actually participate,'' said Irwin Kellner, chief economist at
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   Government reports of a soft economy could help domestic buying
sentiment at the auction as investors seek the fixed interest-rate
notes and bonds, predicting the Federal Reserve will bring down
interest rates to prevent the nation from falling into a recession.
   Bad economic news might encourage enough domestic investors to
buy the securities to make up for any shortage of foreign
investors, said Marilyn Schaja, a money market economist at
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.
   Last week, the Commerce Department reported the Index of Leading
Economic Indicators was unchanged in June. Many economists had
expected the index, designed to forecast economic activity six to
nine months in advance, would increase slightly.
   Also, the Labor Department said the unemployment rate jumped to
5.5 percent in July, the highest in two years and further evidence
of a weakening economy.

<BYLINE>World Economies Could Suffer From Sustained Oil Price Hike</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sustained rise in oil prices due to Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait and speculation about further aggression
threatens a global economic slowdown, higher inflation and rising
interest rates, experts say.
   However, the industrial world is much less vulnerable to oil
shocks than it was in the 1970s, when Arab oil embargoes rattled
Western economies, they said.
   ``The situation will be different. Even in the worst case
scenario, it is unlikely that oil prices will jump on a sustained
basis as they did then,'' said Michael Hughes, an economist at the
London investment firm Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
   But, Hughes added, ``The impact on the world economy could still
be quite significant.''
   At the very least, the developments will bring unwelcome
uncertainty to the global economic outlook.
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Thursday sent the spot price
soaring for North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded
international crude. The oil traded at above $24 a barrel by late
Friday in London.
   That was some 50 percent higher than the price of nearly $16 a
barrel on July 12, when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein began
threatening to take action against Kuwait.
   Iraq accused its much-smaller neighbor of stealing oil from
border areas and of costing Iraq billions of dollars in lost
revenue by overproducing crude and helping to depress world oil
prices.
   The proximity of Iraqi troops to the border with Saudi Arabia
late in the week raised further speculation of threats to supplies.
   Geoff Pyne, an oil analyst with UBS Phillips and Drew, said
under the best-case scenario, based on current supplies, oil prices
should settle at $21 to $22 a barrel.
   If supplies are seriously disrupted, prices could reach $30 a
barrel, he said, levels crude reached in the mid-1980s before a
sustained price drop pummeled oil producers.
   The most vulnerable country is Japan, which imports 99 percent
of its oil, economists say.
   The Arab oil embargo after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war set back
Japan's economic growth with skyrocketing oil prices, inflation and
cutbacks in industrial production.
   If oil prices rise to at least $25 a barrel and maintain that
level through next year, Japan's economic growth could fall to 3.6
percent instead of the expected 3.9 percent next year, and its
annual inflation could rise to 2.8 percent instead of 2.1 percent,
said Stephen King, international economist at the London investment
firm James Capel and Co.
   In the United States _ where the economy already has shown signs
of slipping into a recession _ economic growth could be 1.5 percent
next year instead of the forecast 2 percent, King said. Inflation
could be 5.2 percent instead of 4.75 percent.
   ``In the United States you can wonder whether an oil shock, if
there is to be an oil shock, is the straw that breaks the camel
back,'' King said. ``It does appear the chances of recession are
increasing anyway.''
   Germany should still have growth of 4 percent and inflation of
3.5 percent next year, King said. But interest rates could rise in
Germany, as well as in Japan, he said.
   ``They have plenty of reasons already to tighten policy and the
oil price could be an extra reason,'' King said.
   The United States will be torn between wanting to lower interest
rates to spur growth and wanting to raise them to counter the
inflationary pressures of higher oil prices, King said.
   The temptation will be to leave interest rates unchanged, which
could slow growth enough to tip the United States into recession,
he said.
   Joe Roseman, a British economist at UBS Phillips and Drew, said
a sustained, $25 a barrel oil price could mean British economic
growth of 1.7 percent instead of 1.9 percent next year and
inflation of 6.5 percent instead of 5.5 percent.
   Also threatened are developing economies and eastern European
countries which are attempting to turn themselves into market
economies.
   But oil prices haven't risen proportionally anywhere near as
much as in the 1970s oil shocks, King said.
   In the 1979 oil price shock prompted by the Iranian revolution,
oil prices nearly tripled to an annual average of nearly $37 a
barrel from $13. Pyne said.
   In the 1973 price rise, blamed on the Arab oil embargo, prices
almost quadrupled from $2.80 a barrel to $10.40, he said.
   Currently there is a world oil glut, and a slowdown in economic
growth in the past two years has eased demand for oil, the experts
said.
   Furthermore, the 1970s energy crises prompted further
development of alternate sources of oil and other forms of energy
and conservation methods, they said.

<HEAD>Pump Prices Hold, But Station Operators Taking a Hit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The convulsions in the Middle East stirred
unhappy memories of price shocks of 1974 and 1979 _ the specter of
$2-a-gallon gas, cars queued up around the block, ``NO GAS'' signs
on pumps.
   Experts say that's highly unlikely.
   But for independent gas station owners like Bob Horick in
Minnetonka, Minn., Iraq's invasion of neighboring Kuwait this past
week hit quickly. His customers haven't felt the impact yet, but he
has.
   That's because wholesale prices for gasoline moved up nationwide
after Iraq stormed through its OPEC neighbor Thursday, provoking
fears of a world supply crunch.
   Analysts reported jumps of 5 cents to 12 cents a gallon or more
for wholesale gasoline, even in places Minnesota, which gets most
of its oil from Canada, and California, which is supplied from
oil-rich Alaska.
   The increase in wholesale prices followed rises on spot oil
markets worldwide. They occurred even though oil companies were
selling existing inventories. Horick's supplier raised prices 5
cents a gallon at noon and another 2 cents at midnight.
   Horick dispatched a truck to a pipeline terminal in Roseville,
Minn., to try to buy gasoline at old prices. But trucks were lined
up for more than two miles. He made the purchase at an extra cost
of $595 a load.
   So Horick just passed on the extra 6 cents a gallon cost to
consumers, right? Wrong. He kept the retail price of unleaded
gasoline at $1.099 a gallon at his stations in St. Paul and
Hutchinson, Minn., 50 miles west of the Twin Cities.
   Major oil companies set the tone for small retailers.
Competition dictates that only when the big companies raise prices
can the little guy match them. If Horick ups his price first, he
risks fewer customers and less secondary business in candy, soft
drinks, cigarettes and road maps.
   ``There isn't a retailer in this country who wants to be the
first to raise his price on the street,'' said Brian Ettesvold,
executive director of the Minnesota Service Stations Association in
St. Paul.
   But the effect of higher crude prices doesn't hit major oil
companies for about three months, the time it takes them to refine
existing crude. In the interim, they can absorb a hit at the pumps
by raising wholesale prices.
   ``They can really hurt the independents at a time like this,''
Horick said.
   Kevin Lindemer, an energy analyst with Cambridge Research
Associates in Cambridge, Mass., said the panicky atmosphere and
increased demand during the summer driving season doesn't help.
   ``Now that there's a perception in the market that prices are
going up everybody scrambles to fill their inventory,'' he said.
``There's also the fear factor that if I don't fill up now the
price is going to be a lot higher tomorrow.''
   To avoid a rapid depletion of stocks and discourage panic
buying, some wholesalers quickly allocated supplies to ensure an
even distribution while others have stopped making deliveries
altogether.
   Service station groups say the average U.S. gas tank is half
full. If every driver filled up at once, it would take 30 to 60
days to refine enough crude oil to replenish the nation's gasoline
inventories, they say.
   Short of a nationwide panic, energy analysts said the world's
oil production system today makes the likelihood of a repeat of the
troubles of the 1970s unlikely.
   For one thing, there are no signs of a large cutoff in oil
supplies because of the Iraqi invasion.
   In the first five months of 1990 the United States imported
610,000 barrels of oil a day from Iraq, less than 8 percent of
total imports, and 120,000 barrels a day from Kuwait, less than one
half of 1 percent.
   Domestic crude oil stocks are at their highest level in eight
years. Lindemer said surplus production capacity in other countries
could quickly make up for losses from Kuwait or Iraq, including 2
million barrels outside the Persian Gulf region.
   In 1979, the Iranian revolution cut off the country's 6 million
barrels a day from world markets. In 1974, the United States
embargoed oil imports from the Arab world. Production capacity
elsewhere was thin, in contrast to today's market.
   And no one is anxious to repeat the recession that accompanied
both '70s oil crises.
   ``Everybody is well aware what very high oil prices did to the
consuming as well as producing economies,'' Lindemer said.
``Everybody is trying to head that off.''
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Economic reports were gloomy, contributing to declines in the
stock market. The government said its index of leading economic
indicators was unchanged in June, construction spending held steady
and the nation's unemployment rate jumped to 5.5 percent in July. A
private study of purchasing managers' activity pointed to a
sluggish manufacturing sector.
   _The ballooning cost of bailing out the nation's savings and
loans ballooned even more. The Bush administration said the cleanup
would require about $100 million in the next 12 months. Officials
said junk bond losses alone from thrifts seized by the government
would exceed $1 billion. Congress, meanwhile, approved legislation
to increase prison terms for S&amp;L cheats.
   _General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger Smith drove the secretive
Saturn car off an assembly line in a closed ceremony, retiring
after 41 years with GM. He was succeeded by Robert Stempel.
Elsewhere, the auto industry continued on a grim course as Chrysler
Corp. reported a 47 percent drop in second-quarter earnings.

   Visions of a pair of old nemeses _ recession and
energy crisis _ are back haunting the investment markets of Wall
Street.
   The chill they created spread through world financial centers
after Iraq invaded Kuwait this past week, driving oil prices
sharply higher.
   Suddenly, Wall Street veterans were recounting tales of the
1970s, when stocks and bonds languished under the influence of a
slumping domestic economy and a runaway rise in the price of oil.
   From American investors' point of view, there could scarcely be
any good time for a new flareup of trouble in the Middle East.
   But Iraq's action struck many analysts as especially
inopportune, coming as it did when evidence was starting to
accumulate fast that the U.S. economy was turning weaker than
almost anyone had thought just a few weeks ago.
   On Friday the Labor Department reported that nonfarm payroll
employment fell by 219,000 in July, surprising analysts who had
been looking for a modest increase. The civilian unemployment rate
jumped three-tenths of a percentage point, to 5.5 percent.
   A sustained simultaneous rise in oil prices and unemployment
would stand to compound the problems facing the Federal Reserve in
setting its monetary policy.
   Increasing joblessness would seem to mandate moves to ease
credit, and thus cushion the potential effects of a recession. But
the inflationary impact of higher energy prices could stymie any
effort by the Fed to lower long-term interest rates.
   In the midst of this crossfire would stand the banking system,
already burdened by the strains of a retrenchment from the credit
boom of the '80s.
   Twice in the past two weeks, the Dow Jones industrial average
has suffered intraday declines of more than 100 points.
   But on the second occasion, on Friday, some analysts said the
market was simply jumping around wildly in reaction to breaking
news from the Middle East, rather than providing any reliable gauge
of a lasting shift in investor sentiment.
   ``I don't think it was so much a panic as a desire to get to
safety before the market closed for the weekend,'' said William
LeFevre, an analyst at Advest Inc. ``We have a global market with
instant communications. But diplomacy takes time.''
   At the close on Friday Dow Jones's average of 30 blue chips
stood at 2,809.65, down 88.86 points from the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 4.50 to 188.82;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market dropped
25.11 to 417.46, and the American Stock Exchange market value index
was down 8.86 at 346.63.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 208.51 million shares a day, up
from 171.72 million the week before.
   As events unfolded in the Middle East and the economy, some
analysts declared that a recession was increasingly imminent or
even under way.
   David A. Levy and S. Jay Levy, economists in Chappaqua, N.Y.,
rated recession a 60 percent probability even before the new
conflict in the Middle East flared up.
   ``An economic storm is threatening,'' they asserted. ``The most
visible black clouds are decreasing unit retail sales, the housing
recession and stagnant employment.''
   Other, more optimistic observers say the Fed will move swiftly
to combat recession if the economic indicators keep worsening. That
could set up a stern test of the central bank's powers over an
economy driven by worldwide forces.

<HEAD>Northwest Airlines Announces Fuel Surcharge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines, moving to counter rising
jet fuel prices, said Friday it will add a flat one-way surcharge
of $8 to the price of domestic tickets beginning Aug. 9.
   The surcharge stems directly from increases in jet fuel costs
incurred by the carrier since Iraqi troops invaded oil-rich Kuwait,
said Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons.
   ``This will give us a chance to see what happens in the next few
days,'' Gibbons said. ``This is not intended to be a permanent
increase, and it's certainly adjustable.''
   Fuel prices have jumped 8 cents a gallon and are expected to
rise even higher because of uncertainty in the Persian Gulf.
   Gibbons predicted other airlines would follow Northwest's lead
as jet fuel costs continue to rise. ``The effect of the uncertainty
in the Middle East is clear. It packs a pretty big wallop,'' he
said.
   The surcharge will be reviewed periodically, and could jump even
higher, said Gibbons.
   He said Northwest is also considering adding a similar surcharge
to its international flights. Fuel surcharges do not require
governmewnt approval for domestic flights.
   Fuel costs are a major contributor to the operating expenses of
all airlines, said Jack Van Der Wege, senior director of fuel
administration. Crude oil prices have jumped considerably since
Wednesday and will be sharply higher in August than was previously
anticipated.
   Fuel is Northwest's second-largest cost, accounting for about 17
percent of its operating expenses. In January, the Eagan-based
carrier announced similar surcharges to offset rising jet fuel
costs, but withdrew them additional before they went into effect.
