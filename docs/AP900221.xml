   The Air Force lacks an accurate accounting
system, similar to those in private industry, that could forecast
problems in its billions of dollars of weapons purchases, according
to a draft report by congressional investigators.
   The Washington Post said in Thursday editions that an early
draft of the report said the Air Force had ``grossly understated''
the cost of major weapons systems by tens of billions of dollars
over the past decade.
   It said costs of frontline warplanes were understated by $27
billion from 1975 to 1988, and $18 billion in unneeded equipment
was purchased.
   The Air Force is now spending about $14 billion a year buying
aircraft of all kinds.
   A source at the General Accounting Office, whose analysts
prepared the report, said the severely critical comments of the
draft obtained by the newspaper might have been toned down somewhat
in later drafts.
   In comments included in the report, the Air Force largely
concurs with the overall assessment by the GAO investigators _ that
its system has problems, the GAO source said, speaking on condition
on anonymity.
   The newspaper quoted an Air Force statement as saying the report
``creates a faulty impression of waste and mismanagement.''
   The GAO source said the document should not be taken to ``mean
they don't have any (financial) control over systems (purchases).''
   The report makes more than 20 recommendations to improve Air
Force accounting.
   Charles Bowsher, comptroller general and head of the General
Accounting Office, has been worried that the government's
accounting systems are out of date. He chose to examine the Air
Force system on the grounds that it is the best in the Defense
Department, the GAO source said.
   The report had been planned for transmittal to the Senate
Government Operations Committee, chaired by Sen. John Glenn,
D-Ohio., on March 1.

   Rock survivor Bonnie Raitt, who has toiled in
the vineyards of obscurity since the 1960s, won four Grammy awards
Wednesday, including album of the year, for her critically
acclaimed ``Nick of Time'' album.
   ``Wind Beneath My Wings,'' a ballad performed by two-time Grammy
winner Bette Midler, written Larry Henley and Jeff Silbar, won
record of the year and song of the year.
   ``This record's my first No. 1,'' gushed Midler to the audience
at the 32nd annual Grammy Awards show. ``I had to wait 17 years for
it. I hope I don't have to wait another 17.''
   ``I can only take so much of this,'' said Raitt, accepting her
fourth award, female pop vocalist. ``Wake me up when this is over.''
   Raitt also won female rock vocalist and shared the traditional
blues award with John Lee Hooker for ``I'm in the Mood'' on
Hooker's ``The Healer'' album.
   ``This means so much for the kind of music I do, and means those
of us who do rhythm and blues are going to get a chance again,''
said Raitt, 40, a four-time nominee.
   It was a night for survivors.
   Don Henley, formerly of the Eagles, won male rock vocalist for
his lyrical, melancholy ``The End of the Innocence.'' Henley,
co-wrote the album's title track with Bruce Hornsby. It was his
sixth career Grammy.
   ``Great. You sing a song, you win an award,'' a smiling Henley
said, accepting his award moments after performing the tune with
Hornsby.
   Blue-eyed soul balladeer Michael Bolton won best male pop
vocalist Grammy for ``How Am I Supposed to Live Without You.''
   Linda Ronstadt and Aaron Neville won pop duo honors for their
love duet ``Don't Know Much.'' Their producer, Peter Asher, who
began his career in the '60s as half of the Peter &amp; Gordon duo, was
named producer of the year.
   Bolton, who has been recording since the '70s, acknowledged his
``overnight success'' and thanked ``Ray Charles for blessing us all
and opening his mouth and singing.''
   Ronstadt thanked Neville's mother: ``She gave us not only Aaron,
but all the Neville Brothers and that's a pretty great musical
contribution.'' Neville had his first Top 10 hit in 1966 with
``Tell It Like It Is.'' Ronstadt first made the charts with the
Stone Poneys in ``Different Drum'' in 1968.
   The first televised Grammy award in the rap music category went
to Young MC for the single ``Bust a Move.'' Last year the miniature
gramophone trophy for rap was presented off-camera and some rappers
boycotted the ceremony.
   Lyle Lovett won male country vocal honors for ``Lyle Lovett and
His Large Band'' album; k.d. lang won country music's female
vocalist award for ``Absolute Torch and Twang.''
   Milli Vanilli, the Munich-based, dredlocked pop duo of Fab
Morvan and Rob Pilatus, won best new artist honors despite the
``hip-hopping radio fodder'' label given them by Rolling Stone
magazine.
   Slick rhythm and blues group Soul II Soul, legendary jazz artist
Miles Davis and jazz composer-arranger Dave Grusin were early
multiple winners in pre-broadcast ceremonies at the Shrine
Auditorium.
   Soul II Soul won the rhythm and blues group performance for the
single ``Back to Life,'' and the R&amp;B instrumental Grammy for the
``African Dance'' track from their ``Keep on Movin' '' album.
   Davis, already recipient of a lifetime achievement award from
the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, won best jazz
solo instrumental for ``Aura'' and won for the same album in the
big band jazz instrumental category.
   Grusin won three Grammys, for the background score of the movie
``The Fabulous Baker Boys,'' instrumental arrangement for the suite
from ``The Milagro Beanfield War'' and arrangement with vocals for
the ``My Funny Valentine'' track from ```Baker Boys.''
   The all-star collaboration of The Traveling Wilburys won the
rock vocal group Grammy, ending the Rolling Stones' latest bid for
a first Grammy.
   Brother and sister Michael and Janet Jackson won back-to-back
music video trophies. Michael won the short form Grammy for his
``Leave Me Alone'' and Janet claimed the long form category for
``Rhythm Nation 1814.''
   Bobby Brown won as best rhythm and blues male vocalist for his
``Every Little Step'' single; and female R&amp;B vocalist honors went
to Anita Baker for ``Giving You the Best That I've Got.''
   In the classical categories, Leonard Bernstein and the New York
Philharmonic won best orchestral performance for ``Mahler: Symphony
No. 3 in D Minor,'' and cellist Yo-Yo Ma won the instrumental
soloist award for ``Barber: Cello Concerto, Op. 22-Britten Symphony
for Cello and Orchestra, Op. 68.''
   The late Gilda Radner won the best spoken word Grammy for her
album ``It's Always Something.''
   ``After All This Time'' was named best country song, earning a
Grammy for singer-songwriter Rodney Crowell.
   Former Beatle Paul McCartney and Davis were chosen for the
Academy's Lifetime Achievement Award, and Dick Clark received a
Trustees Award, for achievements in the non-performing side of the
industry.

   The Academy also gave two posthumous Lifetime Achievement Awards
to singer Nat ``King'' Cole and pianist Vladimir Horowitz.
   The achievement awards recognize performers who have made
contributions of outstanding artistic significance. Earlier
recipients have included the Rolling Stones, Elvis Presley, Bing
Crosby, Frank Sinatra and Arturo Toscanini.
   Grammy winners are chosen by the nearly 6,000 active members of
the academy, a non-profit organization formed to represent all
segments of the recording industry.
   The Grammy Awards began in 1958 with 28 categories, since
increased to nearly 80.

<HEAD>Exxon Says Alaska Oil-Spill Cleanup to Begin May 1</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Hazelwood Trial</HEAD>

   Starting May 1, Exxon will resume its
cleanup of oil remaining in Prince William Sound and the Gulf of
Alaska from the nation's largest oil spill, company officials said
Wednesday.
   Exxon suspended its cleanup in September because of the onset of
severe winter weather, but had declined to set a date for further
work.
   ``We know now that some additional work is going to be needed,''
spokesman Joe Tucker said. ``Additional cleanup as required will
begin around May 1, weather permitting.''
   Exxon officials said survey teams found oil at a depth of 28
inches in one site. But at most problem areas the depth was about 4
to 6 inches, said Hann Jahns, an Exxon scientist.
   The company found serious problems along about 10 of the 90
miles of shoreline its crews surveyed, Jahns said.
   The extent of the remaining work will not be determined until
April, Tucker said. But he predicted the 1990 cleanup would be
``substantially smaller'' than efforts carried out last year.
   The tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground March 24 on Bligh Reef south
of Valdez, spewing nearly 11 million gallons of North Slope crude.
Hundreds of miles of rocky shoreline were covered with oil and
countless birds and sea mammals died.
   Following a meeting of 70 oil-spill officials in Anchorage on
Tuesday, Coast Guard Rear Adm. David Ciancaglini announced that
Exxon would resume the cleanup.
   Ciancaglini said Exxon was not ordered to return. ``Exxon will
return because they are needed to do so,'' he said.
   Exxon, federal and state officials have agreed on a basic
schedule for the spring cleanup, Tucker said. The company will
submit a general cleanup plan to Ciancaglini by March 15.
   Ciancaglini, the federal on-scene coordinator for the cleanup,
said he will have to approve Exxon's plan before it is put into
effect.
   Exxon, the Coast Guard and state and federal agencies will
develop the best strategy and decide on the appropriate methods to
remove the remaining oil, Ciancaglini said.
   The agencies and Exxon have been working for weeks to assess how
much oil has been removed by waves, rain and other natural
processes. Though they disagree on the exact amounts, all say
winter has had a major cleansing effect on the sound. But they say
some of the more protected areas are still in trouble.
   Ciancaglini said survey crews from Exxon, the state Department
of Environmental Conservation and other agencies would spend most
of April surveying the shores. They will meet in late April to
develop clean-up strategies.
   He praised Exxon's cooperation in assessing the cleanup needs
with state and federal officials. But he said he would not hesitate
to order a federal takeover of the cleanup if Exxon refused to
carry out the work.

   ``The Cosby Show'' finished in the top 10
twice in the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings, while more people watched
``The Color Purple'' than the first part of ``The Kennedys of
Massachusetts'' miniseries.
   NBC won the ratings race for the week ended Feb. 18 with an
average of 15.7, followed by ABC with 12.6 and CBS with 12.1,
according to figures released Tuesday. A ratings point represents
the percentage of the nation's 92.1 million television shows tuned
into a show.
   Here are the Top 10 shows, their networks and ratings: ``The
Cosby Show,'' NBC, 23.9; ``Cheers,'' NBC, 23.3; (tie) ``Movie of
the Week _ Blind Faith Part 2,'' NBC, 23.3; ``A Different World,''
NBC, 21.9; ``The Cosby Show Special,'' NBC, 21.6; ``America's
Funniest Home Videos,'' ABC, 21.2; ``Roseanne,'' ABC, 20.5; ``The
Golden Girls,'' NBC, 20.4; ``Empty Nest,'' NBC, 19.9; ``The Wonder
Years,'' ABC, 19.4
   NBC scored strongly on Monday night by using a special airing of
the ``Cosby'' show, ``The Golden Girls,'' ``Dear John'' and ``Empty
Nest.'' The network claimed a 10 percent gain above its normal
Monday average.
   Also Monday, CBS' ``The Love Boat: A Valentine Voyage'' was 38th
in the ratings, while ABC's broadcast of ``Jewel of the Nile'' was
41st.
   NBC won all the nights of the week except Friday against ABC's
lineup and Sunday, when it offered ``The Death of the Incredible
Hulk'' against CBS' broadcast of the theatrical movie ``The Color
Purple'' and ABC's first installment of ``The Kennedys'' miniseries.
   ``The Color Purple'' took 18th place with a 17.1 rating,
followed by ``The Kennedys'' tied at 20th with a 15.8 rating and
the ``Hulk'' movie tied for No. 24 with a 14.6 rating.
   ``America's Funniest Home Videos'' was in 6th place on ABC with
a 21.2 rating, but ``Elvis,'' the midseason show following it
Sunday night was at No. 43. The half-hour series about the life of
the rock legend had a 12.5 rating.
   Up against ``Elvis'' was the cartoon family from Fox, ``The
Simpsons,'' which tied for 24th place with two other shows and was
the ``fourth network's'' highest-rated show during the week.
   Another new show for the midseason, CBS' ``The Bradys,'' was
61st. NBC's new series ``Grand'' was ranked 17th, but its 17.2
rating was more than six points below that for ``Cheers,'' its
lead-in.
   The NBC comedy special, ``Bob Hope Lampoons Show Business'' on
Saturday night, ranked 30th for the week.
   For the season to date, NBC leads the averages with 14.8,
followed by ABC with 13.0 and CBS with 12.3.
   For the evening news shows, ABC led with a weekly average of
11.3, followed by NBC with 10.1 and CBS with 9.9.
   The five bottom-ranked network shows were ``Tour of Duty,'' CBS,
7.9; ``Saturday Night With Connie Chung,'' CBS, 7.8; ``Grand
Slam,'' CBS, 7.5; ``48 Hours,'' CBS, 7.3, and ``Mission
Impossible,'' ABC, 6.2.

   When Sybron Corp. negotiated a joint venture in Budapest, talks
stalled while attorneys for the Hungarian partners grappled to
translate ``profit.''
   ``It was difficult to put the word profit in the contract in
Hungarian so we wrote it in German,'' said Donald Rackl, chief
financial officer for the Milwaukee manufacturer.
   Sybron weathered that and other problems starting its first
business in Eastern Europe. The company expects to dance around
bigger business potholes when its microscope-slide plant starts
production this year.
   Even a veteran like Pepsico Inc., after years of operating in
the region, has altered the way it does business to cope with
problems alien to the West.
   Pepsi plants in Czechoslovakia sometimes run out of bottles due
to late shipments. In the Ukraine, state officials waylay delivery
trucks to haul harvested wheat, said Richard Norton, Pepsico vice
president for Eastern Europe.
   Such inconveniences are a way of life in countries still shaking
off the dust of communist rule. Less easily overcome are structural
and economic problems: rapid inflation, huge foreign debt and
inconvertible currencies that make it difficult to turn profits
into dollars.
   In many respects, the revolution in Eastern Europe remains only
a promise. Several countries have no laws on foreign ownership and
joint ventures. They lack legal systems and courts, leaving Western
businesses vulnerable if, for example, suppliers don't deliver and
customers don't pay.
   Yet for all the problems, Eastern Europe may represent the
greatest commercial and financial opportunity since the rebuilding
of Western Europe after World War II. The region's 136 million
consumers crave everything from french fries to shoe polish,
telephones to computer disks.
   For companies with global aspirations and patience for profits,
Eastern Europe is ``a pot of gold,'' said Marvin Zonis, a
University of Chicago business professor. ``There are real
possibilities out there and they ought to be pursued.''
   The Commerce Department's own analysts say firms dealing in
agriculture, health care, telecommunications, energy, tourism and
housing may have the best chance of gaining entry and prospering in
East European markets.
   There are plenty of reasons for American companies to invest.
Cheap labor is one of the biggest. The average hourly manufacturing
wage in Hungary, Poland and Yugoslavia in 1988 was $1.35 to $1.71,
said PlanEcon Inc., a Washington research concern specializing in
Eastern Europe.
   Wages could even fall in dollar terms because of an expected
decline in exchange rates.
   Moreover, East European workers are relatively well-educated and
highly trained compared with Third World counterparts. Low
productivity may be a concern, but some economists say that can be
corrected.
   ``Workers get lazy and depressed when they get stuck with guys
who are doing a bad job of running things,'' said Edward Yardeni,
chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Perhaps the biggest incentive for U.S. corporations is global
competition. American giants like General Electric, International
Business Machines and General Motors are already there, but so are
rivals Suzuki; Siemens, West Germany's giant electronics company;
Ferruzzi Finanziara, Italy's leading chemical and agribusiness
company; and British Telecom. Others are on the way.
   Eugene Theroux, an attorney in the Washington office of the
international law firm Baker &amp; McKenzie, said it's a mistake for
American businesses to sit back and watch.
   ``They should make at least a minimum of time, effort and
expense necessary to examine the alternatives,'' said Theroux, who
advises companies doing business in communist countries.
   Many companies are doing just that. The Commerce Department and
Chamber of Commerce say they're getting 10 times as many inquiries
as last year from American companies _ on everything from
investment laws to opportunities and licensing. Commerce Secretary
Robert A. Mosbacher opened an information office on Eastern Europe
in January to handle all the calls.
   Lawyers, travel agents and public relations firms are leading
the way, establishing offices and advertising for Western clients.
   ``Cautious optimism has been replaced by opportunism,'' said
Richard W. Edelman, president of New York-based Edelman Public
Relations Worldwide, which has opened offices in Hungary and is
scouting elsewhere.
   But American executives already experienced in Eastern Europe
warn newcomers to calculate the risks. Many early joint ventures in
the Soviet Union failed for lack of careful business plans. Those
who decide to go should be prepared to stay awhile.
   ``This is an investment that will have long-term rewards instead
of a short-term immediate impact,'' said Andrew B. Somers Jr.,
general counsel for American Express Corp., which has offices in
several East European countries. ``This is not something you dabble
in.''
   Companies in the vanguard also must be prepared to sacrifice
time and resources to gain a foothold, as McDonald's discovered
opening its first restaurant in Moscow.
   The opening took McDonald's 14 years, $50 million and its own
supply system that bypasses the deadly Soviet bureacracy.
   While the Soviet Union is considered more treacherous for
enterprising Westerners, economists say Eastern Europe is similar.
   ``Right now if I were an American company I would think the
prospects were very risky given the political and economic
transition,'' said Georgetown University professor Stewart Brown.
   Congress has authorized $300 million in aid for private
enterprise in Poland and Hungary. The federal Export-Import Bank
will guarantee loans up to $200 million to Hungary and Yugoslavia.
   But U.S. companies will have to rely largely on their own
resources to establish outposts in Eastern Europe.
   ``Anyone not prepared to suffer losses should not go in,'' Brown
said.

   Opening a hotel is never easy, but launching the
first Western-managed hotel in Poland taxed the creativity of
veteran Marriott Corp. executives.
   Reaching a joint-venture agreement for the Warsaw Marriott was
just the start. Next was the problem of furnishing and equipping
the 41-story, 520-room hotel, built in the shell of a dormant
Warsaw skyscraper.
   ``Just about everything was imported,'' said Marriott spokesman
Gordon Lambourne.
   Then there was the matter of finding local employees with the
proper attitude.
   ``The sense of hospitality, the sense of private enterprise
doesn't exist,'' said William R. Tiefel, president of Marriott's
hotels division. ``There's not much incentive to be very creative
in a job.''
   The most difficult task was securing a reliable supply of food
and drink for the hotel's 11 restaurants and bars. You don't shop
for prime rib and fine wine in a country where shoppers queue for
bread and potatoes.
   Marriott's problems reflect the difficulties inherent in
cultivating capitalism in old state-run economies. It's not a
matter of adding a little water and fertilizer. You have to plant
the very seeds.
   Marriott took the challenge literally. It signed contracts with
Polish farmers, fishermen and a brewery to ensure a more-or-less
steady stream of local provisions ranging from beer to lettuce.
   It even imported the seed used by the farmers so the produce
would be up to its standards.
   In addition, Marriott built a freezing and canning plant to
ensure a year-round supply, along with huge food lockers and
storage areas to hold a month's worth of goods, much of it imported.
   The hotel opened in October, and the company is pleased enough
that it's considering outposts in other major East bloc cities,
including Budapest, Prague and Moscow.
   Marriott is no stranger to opening hotels in non-Western
countries; it had to negotiate similar food procurement contracts
in the Middle East and Barbados, Tiefel said.
   But the Warsaw hotel posed the most difficult problems the
company ever faced, he said.
   The idea for the hotel, the first U.S.-Polish joint venture
since the end of American economic sanctions against Poland in
1987, began four years ago when Marriott was contacted by partners
in its Vienna hotel, Tiefel said.
   The parters _ Ilbau, the Austrian construction company that
built the hotel, and Girozentrale, the bank that financed it _
joined with LOT, the Polish government-owned airline, in proposing
the Warsaw hotel. They wanted Marriott to run it.
   Under the joint venture, Marriott holds an approximate 25
percent interest in ownership and operation of the hotel and the
office space that occupies 20 of the building's floors. It also
gets an undisclosed percentage of profits.
   The hotel's rooms are rented for foreign currency only, and the
Polish government gets a cut. The restaurants and bars accept
zlotys, the Polish currency, which are used to pay most hotel
expenses.
   As for staffing, Tiefel said, ``There was not a work force to
draw on that had experience in the lodging business.'' So the
criteria changed. ``The bigger the smile, the quicker we hired
them,'' he said.
   Marriott brought in 25 managers to school the staff. In
addition, it trained 22 Polish workers in the United States and
brought in several dozen housekeepers, bartenders and other
employees from its Western hotels to work alongside their Polish
counterparts, Tiefel said.
   Samir Daqqaq, the hotel's marketing director, said Western
managers in Poland need ``a very deep well of patience. You don't
train just once, it is an ongoing process.''
   The employees are given two meals daily, partly to reduce food
theft, in addition to wages slightly above what they would get
elsewhere in Poland. The pay is adjusted monthly for the nation's
runaway inflation, Marriott said. But perhaps the most prized perks
are the hotel uniforms.
   ``One bellman _ we have these really nice bellman's uniforms _
he postponed his wedding so he could wear it on his wedding day,''
Lambourne said.

<TEXT>
   More than a week after it was
discovered, the body of a 15-ton whale that washed ashore still lay
on the beach while officials decided which province would remove it.
   The whale washed ashore about nine days ago at el-Omeid about 55
miles west of this Mediterranean city but had not been removed by
Tuesday because officials in Alexandria claimed the half-buried
carcass was not in their province but in that of Mersa Matruh.
   Mersa Matruh is unequipped to deal with the body of such a large
animal, which rarely appears in Egypt's Mediterranean waters. The
last time a dead whale was washed ashore in Egypt was in 1936, said
Sherif Ramadan at the Oceanography Institute.
   An official at Alexandria's fire department said that if Mersa
Matruh asked for help, it would send firefighters with cranes along
with butchers to cut up the whale's body, which was so
disintegrated it could not be lifted whole.

   Here are key provisions of the contract
approved by United Mine Workers in Virginia, West Virginia and
Kentucky who have been on strike since April 5 against the Pittston
Coal Group:
   _ Term: 4 years.
   _ Wages: top scale of $17.52 an hour in selected positions, a
raise of $1.20 an hour.
   _ Health benefits: 100 percent medical coverage for employees,
pensioners and their families.
   _ Retirement: pension benefits identical to the 1988 agreement
between the UMW and the Bituminous Coal Operators Association.
   _ Job security: Pittston can hire contract workers for
transportation and equipment repair and maintenance if no union
miners are laid off. Laid-off union miners must be hired for the
first four of every five job openings at Pittston's non-union mines
and providers of contract workers must agree to offer the first 19
of every 20 jobs to laid-off union miners.
   _ Working hours: flexible schedules, including four-day weeks of
10 hours each and 28-day shift rotations, which would allow almost
round-the-clock operation of mines.

<TEXT>
   Here is a list of significant events in the strike between the
United Mine Workers union and Pittston Coal Group Inc.:
   May 19, 1987: Pittston said it would leave the Bituminous Coal
Operators Association and negotiate independently with the UMW
beginning for a contract to replace the national contract expiring
Jan. 31, 1988.
   April 5, 1989: UMW called a strike against Pittston in Virginia,
West Virginia and Kentucky for alleged unfair labor practices after
union members worked 14 months without a contract.
   April 12: UMW members arrested for throwing rocks at company
trucks in Dickenson County, the first of hundreds of violent acts
designed to disrupt coal shipments and intimidate replacement
workers.
   April 27: More than 1,000 UMW members and supporters blocked two
mines in a sit-down demonstration, the beginning of a civil
disobedience campaign that led to more than 2,000 arrests in the
first three months of the strike.
   May 8: Negotiations began through the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service.
   May 16: Russell County Circuit Judge Donald McGlothlin fined the
UMW $642,000 for violating his order limiting strike activities and
prohibiting the disruption of Pittston operations. McGlothlin's
fines eventually totalled $64.5 million.
   June 5: U.S. District Judge Glenn Williams threw UMW strike
coordinators Marty Hudson and Jackie Stump in jail for contempt of
court. They were released two weeks later.
   June 7: The union withdrew from federally mediated negotiations,
accusing Pittston of bargaining in bad faith.
   June 10: Pittston declared an impasse in negotiations and
implemented its final contract offer, essentially saying take it or
leave it.
   June 11: UMW President Richard Trumka promised to widen the
strike. The next day, a series of wildcat strikes began that spread
to the Midwest and eventually had more than 46,000 miners off the
job in sympathy with the Pittston strikers.
   June 19: Union members and supporters, including wildcat
strikers from other states, began bumper-to-bumper convoys of
several hundred cars and trucks to slow coal shipments. The tactic
ended a few weeks later after Williams fined the union nearly $1
million and began throwing drivers in jail for contempt of court.
   July 8: The National Labor Relations Board issued an unfair
labor practices complaint against Pittston.
   July 18: UMW and Pittston agreed to resume federally mediated
contract talks but could not agree to meet in the same room and
negotiations failed to progress.
   Aug. 23: Trumka, AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland and 19
officials representing a dozen other unions arrested in a sit-down
demonstration at the Russell County, Va., courthouse.
   Sept. 17: Ninety-eight striking miners and union officials
launched an unarmed invasion of Pittston's main processing and
shipping plant in Russell County and occupied it for four days
while as many as 3,000 supporters rallied outside.
   Oct. 11: International labor leaders, including representatives
of the Polish Solidarity, attended a rally of Pittston strikers and
took the strikers' case to Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole the next
day in Washington.
   Oct. 13: Dole visited striking miners and Pittston workers and
announced she would meet with Trumka and Pittston Co. Chairman Paul
Douglas for the two sides' first face-to-face meeting since June.
Two weeks later, Dole appointed former Labor Secretary William
Usery to mediate.
   Nov. 9: Contract talks resumed with Trumka and Douglas at the
table.
   Jan. 1: Dole, Trumka and Douglas announced a tentative
settlement and agreed to withhold a vote on it until all
strike-related litigation was dissolved.
   Feb. 12: McGlothlin refused to drop the $64 million in fines.
Two days later, Judge Williams agreed to reduce his fines against
the union from $960,000 to $228,000.
   Feb. 19: The rank-and-file voted 1,247 to 734 in favor of the
contract.

   When W.J. Usery entered the bitter
Pittston Coal strike he was called a ``supermediator,'' a term that
seems particularly appropriate with both labor and management
praising the agreement he helped to forge.
   ``I've seen so much malice and hate across the table,'' Usery
said, ``but if they really listen to each other, they find they're
not quite as far apart as they thought. Some people say, `You just
wear 'em down,' but I don't think that's all true.''
   Maybe so. But the former labor secretary readily concedes using
marathon bargaining sessions in his effort to bring parties to
agreement.
   Those who've worked with Usery in various negotiations say he
sets an unrelenting, sometimes round-the-clock pace at the
bargaining table. In the Pittston talks, Usery kept negotiators at
the table for 96 hours straight in a failed bid to reach an accord
by Christmas.
   He nearly succeeded. The agreement approved by miners Monday had
been reached New Year's Eve.
   ``When you're on a nine-month strike, sometimes there's a
tendency to say, `What's another day? What's another week?,'' Usery
said, cautioning that ``if you recess for a few days, then you have
to start all over again when you get back.''
   When Usery was tapped by Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole to
intervene in the Pittston strike in late October, he hesitated at
first to enter the fray because of the acrimony between the two
sides.
   At that point, management and labor hadn't bargained directly
with one another since the walkout began in April. Instead, they
were sending messages back and forth through a federal mediator.
   Usery was at the AFL-CIO's winter meeting in Bal Harbour, Fla.,
when the United Mine Workers announced Tuesday that Pittston
workers had ratified the contract and would soon be back to work.
   ``It was a very difficult time. I confess I pushed very hard,
long hours. I think today it's worth it,'' Usery told miners in
Castlewood, Va., on a conference call as the results of the vote
were announced.
   For his efforts, the Labor Department will pay his firm $250 an
hour for days in which he worked less than six hours and $2,750 for
days in which he worked more. Expenses will be paid separately.
   Usery has not submitted a bill.
   Part of his success, Usery said in an interview, lies in his
ability to persuade negotiators to set emotions aside and listen to
their counterparts.
   ``People in a strike sometimes just think about themselves. But
it's not just, as in this case, the miners and their families who
are losing money. Management loses, all the general stores, the
schools, tax base. ... The churches don't get the same offerings,''
said the 66-year-old Usery.
   He said that the contract approval represented a huge victory
for organized labor and that it showed that two sides, no matter
how far apart they are in the bargaining process, can ultimately
find a resolution.
   Jim Kennedy of the Railway Labor Executive Association said
Usery has won acclaim for bringing two sides together when it
appears they are ``locked into their positions and nothing can
dynamite them out.''
   ``I've seen him push and cajole and bully and charm. He'll use
any technique,'' Kennedy said.
   Longtime aide Herb Fishgold says Usery's own success story _
rising from being a shipyard welder to President Ford's labor
secretary _ helps explain his mediating style, which often appeals
to negotiators' patriotism.
   ``He tries to pay back the country by promoting it,'' Fishgold
said. ``I've watched people at these things and you can just tell
they're thinking, `Here we go, another speech about mom and apple
pie.' But when it's all over, they're saying, `How did he do
that?'''
   Usery himself says:
   ``I've been accused of waving the flag, of using the flag. But
the world is so different now; there's a global economy,
international concerns. ... We can't afford the luxury of long,
lenthy disputes.''
   Bob Healey, who was president of the Chicago Teachers Union when
Usery helped settle a three-week strike there in 1983,
goodnaturedly divulged that Usery sometimes would disappear for
three or four hours during negotiations. ``We thought he was in
trying to sell it to the school board, but we learned later he
sneaks up and takes naps while nobody's looking.''
   Usery grew up in Hardwick, Ga., and began his working career as
a shipyard welder in World War II before joining the Navy and
serving in the Pacific. After his discharge, he worked for the
Armstrong Cork Co., where he helped organize a Machinists union
local.
   Former President Nixon brought Usery to Washington in 1969 as an
assistant secretary of labor. Usery immediately won praise for
helping resolve complicated railroad and airline disputes without
Congress having to step in.
   He was named director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation
Service in 1973. In 1976 Ford appointed him secretary of labor.
   Since going into private business, Usery has helped mediate
disputes involving Chicago public school teachers, the United Auto
Workers and General Motors and Toyota, and pro football players.

   An education administrator defeated a
dentist in a runoff election Tuesday for the City Council seat held
by a lawyer who died in December in a spate of Southeastern mail
bombings.
   Clifford Hardwick, assistant dean for the Coastal Georgia Center
for Continuing Education, received 1,467 votes to 1,127 for dentist
Phyllis Mack, in the race to succeed Robert Robinson.
   The 2,594 voters represented a turnout of 29.4 percent in the
council district.
   Hardwick, 62, led a field of eight candidates in the first
election Jan. 30, but didn't get the 50 percent minimum needed to
take the race, forcing a runoff.
   Robinson represented the city's 5th District, a predominantly
black area which runs through Savannah's historic Victorian
District.
   He was killed by a mail bomb Dec. 18 following the mail-bomb
assassination of federal appeals Judge Robert Vance in Mountain
Brook, Ala. Bombs were also sent to a federal courthouse in Atlanta
and the Jacksonville, Fla., office of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People, but were safely removed.

   Great Britain's Prince Charles told
business leaders from around the globe Tuesday that the world needs
a ``new deal'' where capitalism takes on a more humane face.
   ``The crucial factor is whether such an approach can be
commercial. And yet, surely, it must be good business in the long
run,'' the Prince of Wales told about 100 corporate executives
gathered for an international business conference.
   The prince arrived in Charleston around noon and was warmly
cheered by a crowd of about 200 people as he entered the Old
Exchange Building, where South Carolinians ratified the U.S.
Constitution in 1788.
   About 100 chief executive officers and top business officials
are attending a two-day meeting of Business in the Community, a
London-based group founded by the prince which brings corporate
leaders together to discuss the roles and responsibilities of
business.
   ``Business is at a crossroads,'' Charles told the conference.
``Does it enter new markets like the cowboys of the new frontier or
does it take a rather more sophisticated approach which leads to
continued, rather than short-term profit?''
   He suggested business leaders can neither take a short-term
approach in search of quick profits nor leave the larger problems
of the environment and education only to the government.
   ``There is no better illustration of this than the greatly
increased concern by consumers about the impact of business
processes and products upon the environment,'' he said. ``These are
no longer frontier days when businesses can afford to make
short-term decisions.''
   The prince, who will be in Charleston through Wednesday, is
making his second visit to the city once known as Charles Towne. He
last visited in 1977.
   During a lunch with the business leaders, the prince praised
Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. for the mayor's efforts to build the
antebellum tourist city into an international asset.
   ``Charleston has ridden out disaster and setbacks over many
years, not just the terrifying recent effects and loss caused by
Hurricane Hugo,'' he said, referring to the Sept. 21 storm that
left 29 dead and $5.9 billion in damage in South Carolina.
   Riley said the prince's visit would focus attention on the fact
that Charleston has bounced back after the hurricane.
   Tuesday night the prince and about 400 people attended a
black-tie gala to benefit hurricane victims.
   About 100 people looked on as business leaders and a who's who
of Charleston society entered the brightly lit Hibernian Hall for
an evening of dancing.
   Guests were asked to donate $100 each to the hurricane relief
effort.
   The prince is expected to attend several more conference
sessions Wednesday, and visit a public housing complex. He plans to
leave Thursday for Washington for a meeting with President Bush.

<HEAD>Genetically Engineered Trees Important Step Toward `Energy
Plantations'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Development of the first genetically
engineered trees is an important step toward creation of energy
plantations on which forests would be grown for fuel, researchers
say.
   The trees, engineered from a species of poplar, were altered to
make them resistant to a widely used herbicide, says Bruce E.
Haissig of the U.S. Forest Service laboratory in Rhinelander, Wis.
   Haissig reported on his work at the annual meeting of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science on Tuesday.
   A mutant gene from a species of bacteria called salmonella,
which commonly causes food poisoning, was introduced into the
trees, making the trees resistant to glyphosate, a herbicide
marketed as Roundup.
   Growing poplars on plantations has been difficult because the
young trees can be crowded out and killed by weeds. Herbicides that
are used to kill the weeds often kill or damage the poplars,
Haissig said.
   The genetically engineered trees offer the hope of plantations
in which a herbicide like Roundup can be used to kill the weeds
without harming the trees, Haissig said.
   That would lower the cost of producing the trees, which grow
rapidly and could be burned to provide energy or converted into
ethanol to run automobiles, he said.
   The research has been partly supported by the U.S. Department of
Energy, Haissig said. Scientists in Minnesota are working on the
feasibility of the energy plantations.
   ``That blows hot and cold depending upon what the price of oil
is,'' he said.
   Poplars are now grown as ornamental trees, Haissig said.
``They're a fast screen,'' he said. ``People grow them until they
can get conifers behind them.''
   In addition to their fast growth, poplars have another
characteristic that makes them ideal for genetic engineering: They
can be grown from bits of poplar tissue in laboratory culture
dishes.
   When Haissig and colleagues at the University of Wisconsin and
Calgene in Davis, Calif., inserted the salmonella gene into the
poplars, the trees produced an enzyme that allowed them to survive
after being sprayed with Roundup.
   In the first experiments, the genetically altered trees were
unable to withstand levels of the herbicide used in the field.
   ``We had a scientific success, but not a commercial success,''
Haissig said.
   A second round of experiments improved the trees' resistance to
the herbicide, he said.
   Because poplar trees do not flower for 15 years, the researchers
have not determined whether the herbicide resistance will be
inherited by the trees' offspring.
   The trees must flower before they can be bred through
conventional means.
   Experiments are under way with jack pine, which flowers in two
years, to see whether genetically engineered herbicide resistance
is permanent.
   The genetic engineering of trees is limited because most trees
cannot be regenerated from tree tissue grown in laboratory dishes _
a necessary step with present methods of genetic engineering.
   ``The most commercially important species are the most difficult
to regenerate,'' Haissig said.
   That might be overcome, however, with a new technique in which a
gun is used to fire gene-carrying microscopic particles into plant
cells, he said.

   Model Marla Maples, fighting back after a week
of portrayals as the Trump Tower home-wrecker, hired a lawyer
Tuesday to stop the media from splashing her face and figure across
the front page and the TV screen.
   ``We're retaining counsel,'' said her publicist, Chuck Jones.
``We plan an active pursuit of litigation against people wrongfully
selling photos and videotape or making libelous statements against
Marla.''
   Jones did not say specifically who might be targeted in the
model's fight-back campaign.
   Meanwhile, a newspaper reported that Donald Trump had ordered
all pictures of his wife, Ivana, removed from their Florida estate,
and that the operation took two days. A Trump spokesman denied the
report.
   Miss Maples, who has not surfaced publicly since the Trump
divorce story began last week, has been featured in front-page
tabloid photos and in home video on television programs. Jones
asserted some of this material was used without his client's
approval.
   ``These people are making money off Marla's misfortune,'' said
Jones. ``It's going to stop.''
   The Trumps announced last week they were separating after nearly
13 years of marriage. Despite repeated denials, Miss Maples has
been prominently mentioned as ``the other woman'' who lured Trump
from his wife.
   Trump defended Miss Maples in an interview with the New York
Post.
   ``Marla is an unfortunate victim of all this. She is really a
very nice person who is really a friend,'' said Trump, who spent
the weekend with his wife and their three children at the couple's
Florida mansion.
   While stories about the couple's split continued to make the
front page, neither side appeared any closer to filing divorce
papers. Trump again mentioned the possibility of a reconciliation
to the Daily News.
   ``I don't know what will happen. We'll have to see. ... I
haven't discussed it with her, but I suppose anything is
possible,'' Trump said.
   Mrs. Trump was in her office at the Plaza Hotel on Tuesday, said
her spokesman, John Scanlon. ``She goes to work every day just like
the rest of us,'' he said.
   ``She's OK, she's a strong woman, but she's obviously pained,''
said Scanlon.
   While Miss Maples was hiring an attorney, Mrs. Trump was
attacking one. Her attorney, Michael Kennedy, said his client felt
threatened by a report in Monday's New York Post that Trump
attorney Jay Goldberg said, ``I'm a killer. I can rip skin off a
body.''
   ``Mrs. Trump ... has instructed my firm and other colleagues
representing her and her children to have no further negotiations
nor anything else to do with you,'' Kennedy said in a letter to
Goldberg.
   ``This is an instruction we will scrupulously follow.''
   Goldberg responded with a letter stating he would ``have no
further contact'' with Kennedy. He also wrote: ``At no time and to
no one have I ever said that the reason I was retained was to
inflict any harm, physical or otherwise, on your client.'' Both
letters were released to the media.
   The letters further confuse whether there will be a settlement
between the Trumps, who have a prenuptial agreement which would
reportedly give Mrs. Trump $25 million, a Connecticut estate and
custody of their three children.
   Goldberg and partner Stanford Lotwin represent Trump in the case.
   New York Post gossip columnist Cindy Adams, to whom Goldberg
made the ``killer'' comment, called The Associated Press to further
clarify the statement.
   ``At no point did Goldberg say he was going to rip the skin off
Ivana ... The thought of taking the flesh off this beautiful,
lovely blonde is absolutely not what this man said to me,'' Ms.
Adams said.
   During his Florida visit, The Palm Beach Post reported Tuesday,
Trump ordered that all pictures of Mrs. Trump be removed from the
estate, named Mar-a-Lago.
   ``It took them two days,'' an unidentified Palm Beach socialite
told the newspaper.
   Trump, the paper reported, had been planning to stay at
Mar-a-Lago with a friend this weekend. But Mrs. Trump decided to
come to the mansion with the couple's three children: Donald Jr.,
12, Ivancka, 8, and Eric, 6.
   A spokesman for Trump, Howard Rubenstein, denied the report
about the pictures and denied that Trump had planned to spend the
weekend with a friend.
   Mrs. Trump and the children arrived Friday night. Trump joined
his family Sunday and left Monday after a ``wonderful trip,'' the
spokesman said.
   One socialite who knows the Trumps told The Palm Beach Post that
about 25 guests attended a birthday celebration for Mrs. Trump, at
which the Trump children sang tunes, including Ivancka crooning
``Edelweiss.''

<TEXT>
   An opposition coalition glued together
from an atomized, fractious array of parties is posing the
strongest challenge to the Sandinistas' rule since they took power
more than a decade ago.
   The United National Opposition, called UNO, now consists of 14
parties or party factions, all backing opposition newspaper
publisher Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, a living symbol of the fight
for democracy.
   `Uno' is Spanish for one, but the Nicaraguan political tradition
of uniting in the face of a common enemy seldom lasts long after
defeat _ or victory.
   President Daniel Ortega, seeking re-election, has tried to drive
a wedge into the opposition coalition by mocking the wide variety
of parties comprising UNO _ they range from the Communist Party to
ideological opposites in the Conservative Party.
   ``This is such a mish-mash, it can give you indigestion,''
Ortega told delighted supporters at one rally. ``Let (President)
Bush eat it.''
   Can UNO hold together and govern through 1996, should it win
Sunday's general elections?
   ``Yes. We have matured,'' Alfredo Cesar, an adviser to Mrs.
Chamorro, said in an interview.
   He said one reason is ``we have a unanimously agreed-to
government program.
   ``Dona Violeta is the second reason. Everyone in the coalition
trusts she will comply with her commitment and put the program into
place.''
   At least for now, everyone has something to gain by sticking
together and everything to lose if they let mutual suspicions drive
them apart.
   But when the hoped-for spoils were being divided, at least one
party was not happy.
   The secretary-general of People's Social Christian Party stayed
within UNO while its president joined a Social Christian alliance
running separately.
   The official reason was irreconcilable differences; the widely
believed rumor was that the party president, Mauricio Diaz, did not
think his party had been granted enough candidates for the 90
National Assembly seats at stake.
   Nicaragua's political cast is full of splinter parties. Besides
Ortega and Mrs. Chamorro, there are eight other presidential
candidates.
   UNO's vice-presidential candidate, Virgilio Godoy of the
Independent Liberal Party, has been criticized within the coalition
as arrogant and abrasive.
   The power struggle won't be settled by the voters, because each
party will be able to claim it was a major drawing card for Mrs.
Chamorro's ticket.
   Nicaragua's past doesn't offer much of a model for stability,
said Jorge Eduardo Arellano, a history professor.
   ``There's no history here; there's only a caricature,'' Arellano
said. Despite the idea of the Liberals and Conservatives
traditionally dominating Nicaraguan politics, up to 10 factions
existed at the turn of the century; six in the 1940s, he said.
   The Somozas, who ran Nicaragua from the time of the death of
Augusto Cesar Sandino in 1934 until they were toppled by Sandino's
heirs in 1979, were able to use the internal dynamics of coalitions
to divide and rule.
   The Sandinistas themselves have displayed a party discipline
that has proven their biggest strength.
   ``That's the really amazing thing, that the nine comandantes
(top party leaders) have hung together for 10 years,'' a Western
diplomat said.
   Nevertheless, during their years as a guerrilla group, the
Sandinistas split into three factions.
   One advocated a prolonged guerrilla war; another favored
educating the masses on Marxist theory and slowly building up urban
discontent, the third was intent on seizing the first opportunity
to push a mass insurrection.
   The third faction was able to forge tactical alliances with
angry Nicaraguans of all social classes to knock down Somoza in
July 1979.
   Despite that, the Sandinistas united to rule, although there
have been rumored disagreements, notably over ending a cease-fire
last November with the U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   The assassination of Mrs. Chamorro's husband, Pedro Joaquin
Chamorro, was the spark that lit the Sandinista revolution, and the
winners initially forged a junta that included non-Sandinistas,
including Mrs. Chamorro.
   The non-Sandinistas didn't last long, though.
   Since then, the Sandinistas have faced several opposition
coalitions, including the Democratic Coordinating Board, which
eventually dropped out of the 1984 elections.
   This time, despite internal bickering, fraying at the edges and
gaping differences in background and thinking, the main opposition
coalition has managed to hang together, at least through the
campaign.

<HEAD>Advice for Smokers on Smoke-Free Airlines: Take a Nap</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Smokers on smoke-free airliners would be
well-advised to do breathing exercises, doodle or take a nap, say
groups who pushed for the 99 percent ban that takes effect Sunday.
   The American heart and lung associations and the American Cancer
Society said Tuesday they are offering free advice to air travelers
who will have to do without cigarettes on all but about 28 of the
17,000 daily domestic flights.
   Only flights of more than six hours to Alaska or Hawaii will
have smoking sections beginning Sunday.
   A wallet-sized tip card printed by the Coalition on Smoking or
Health advises smokers to take along low-calorie snacks and to
focus on positive thoughts of ``clean air and a clear head.''
   It suggests: ``Hold your breath while you count to four, and
exhale slowly letting out all the air from your lungs. Slowly
repeat these steps five times.''
   It also offers doodling or doing crossword puzzles as a means of
keeping fingertips busy and proposes, ``As a last resort, lean back
and sleep.''
   The coalition unveiled its campaign to help smokers cope at a
news conference with congressional sponsors of the new law and the
Association of Flight Attendants, which pushed for the change.
   ``Chronic lung inflammation, respiratory and sinus problems,
dizziness, nausea and severe headaches will no longer plague our
members, their colleagues or the passengers who share their
environment,'' said Juliette D. Lenoir, representing flight
attendants.
   Increased cancer risk, estimated in a Transportation Department
study released last week, also would be eliminated, Ms. Lenoir said.
   Rep. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said he would move to ban smoking on
trains and buses. He said although a majority of Amtrak passengers
say they like the railroad's rules separating smoking passengers by
car, some complain that they have to pass through the smoking areas
on their way to the dining car.
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., said the smoking ban should be an
incentive for smokers to ``kick the habit.''
   ``I think smoking ought to be done in the privacy of one's home
or one's business where it doesn't affect others,'' he said.
   Lautenberg and Durbin issued a summary of the government study
which concluded that cigarette smoke in airline cabins could kill
between 12 and 15 cabin crew members out of every 100,000 over the
next 20 years, assuming they fly about 960 hours a year.
   Frequent fliers also would be exposed to an increased risk if
smoking had continued, said the study, which was commissioned
before the smoking ban on airliners.

<HEAD>From Giant Octopus to 1,272 Lice, Smithsonian Has it All</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Last year the Smithsonian Institution acquired
an old Pullman railroad car spittoon, Ray Bolger's scarecrow
costume from ``The Wizard of Oz,'' a giant Pacific octopus, 14
condom vending machines (with 108 condoms), 50 parking meters and
1,272 dry-mounted specimens of lice.
   These and more than 700,000 other objects joined the vast
collections of the Smithsonian, a sort of large national cigar box
where Americans stuff their odds and ends, mostly odd.
   Also carted into the Smithsonian's complex of museums and art
galleries in 1989 were a sculpture made of grapevine roots, an Air
Force C-130A Hercules cargo plane, a satin Chinese hanging scroll
from the Ming dynasty and several thousand world's fair souvenirs
dating to 1850.
   The list includes 75 original paving bricks from the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway, the original propeller nose cone
removed from Charles Lindbergh's ``Spirit of St. Louis'' airplane
because of a crack, and 2,500 fossils containing imprints of ferns,
crabs and trilobites which lived in a northern Illinois swamp more
than 300 million years ago.
   Officials said the Smithsonian's holdings grew to nearly 138
million objects with last year's acquisitions, many of which came
from private collectors like Clifford Krainik of Alexandria, Va.,
whose passion was ballooning.
   The National Air and Space Museum bought Krainik's 400-item
collection of balloon memorabilia, including Matthew Brady
photographs of Civil War balloons, a balloon-shaped perfume bottle
and valentines, greeting cards, handbills and sheet music about
balloons.
   The biggest recipient was the National Museum of Natural
History. Its 674,817 new items included a pair of stuffed passenger
pigeons from Colorado, a flying lizard from the Philippines, a
football-sized Brazilian quartz crystal containing golden needles,
8,152 mounted specimens of wasps, 30 garments and household objects
used by Tibetan nomads and a piece of petrified timber from Cyprus
that has turned into copper.
   Only a tiny fraction of the Smithsonian's vast collections are
on display at its 14 museums and galleries in Washington and New
York, plus the National Zoo. The bulk of its nearly 138 million
objects are specimens housed in the Natural History Museum and used
for scientific research.
   The giant octopus, by the way, was captured off the coast of
Washington state near Seattle and shipped to the National Zoo,
which also acquired a Sumatran tiger from Indonesia and a three-ton
Asian elephant named ``Toni'' from Scranton, Pa.

<HEAD>City Votes To Go To Court, If Necessary, To Stop Medfly Spraying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to
take all possible steps to stop aerial pesticide spraying against
the Medfly, heating up the dispute between rural and urban areas
over how to fight the crop-killing insect.
   Disagreeing with official assurances the spraying is safe, the
council approved a motion to pursue lawsuits and administrative
appeals to force the state to halt spraying and to study the
potential risks of malathion.
   ``This is going to be a tough case. But it's a case we have to
fight,'' said Councilman Joel Wachs. ``The public has a right and a
demand to know if the goverment is leveling with them.''
   The council also voted 15-0 to look into blocking the movement
of all produce through Los Angeles airport and harbor facilities
until farm officials agree to discuss with the city the use of
malathion.
   Councilwoman Gloria Molina said state officials have failed to
look seriously at the possible risks of spraying because of
pressure from the powerful agricultural industry.
   The state is spraying 400 square miles of Los Angeles and Orange
counties at night to wipe out the worst infestation of the
crop-destroying bug since 1981-82. Helicopters drop a mixture of
malathion and sticky corn syrup bait.
   Agriculture officials contend the spraying poses no health risks
and is a necessary step to avert an estimated $200 million in crop
losses a year if the Medfly becomes established in the state.
   The Mediterranean fruit fly lays its eggs in more than 250
varieties of fruits, vegetables and nuts grown in California. The
crops are destroyed when the larvae hatch and eat their way out.
   Councilman Michael Woo called the spraying a ``blatant example
of the urban population of this state being held hostage to the
agricultural industry.''
   California Farm Bureau spokesman Clark Biggs said farmers
sympathize with Southern Californians for having to live with the
spraying, but contended that wiping out the Medfly is in everyone's
best interest.
   ``It's no fun to have helicopters flying over your house in the
middle of the night. We understand i's a great discomfort and
inconvenience for the urban residents,'' he said. ``We pray for
them to stay with us until we can get this one under control.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush Tries a New Twist on Line-Item Veto Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is nibbling at the edges of a
major constitutional confrontation with Congress, and so far
Democratic leaders are not calling his hand on it.
   In a calculated act of civil disobedience, Bush has told
Congress he won't carry out certain provisions of certain laws
because he believes them to be an infringement on his
constitutional powers.
   It's a new twist on the old argument over line-item veto powers
_ long sought unsuccessfully by Republican presidents from
Democratic Congresses.
   Bush's first act of defiance came, little noticed, last November
on a bill providing money for two federal agencies. He did it again
last Friday on a $9.8 billion State Department measure.
   So far, the president's actions have generated little heat in
Congress _ largely because he asn't done much to publicize them
and, consequently, members generally seem unaware of what he's been
up to.
   ``We're going to put someone on this right away,'' said Rep. Don
Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on
civil and constitutional rights.
   Edwards, who usually keeps track of such things, said he had not
been aware of Bush's assertions. ``It's totally unacceptable to
have a president who doesn't comply with the law,'' he said.
   In November, Bush signed a bill providing funds for the Treasury
Department and the Postal Service, but said he would refuse to obey
one section.
   The section would have prevented him from requiring government
employes to sign statements promising not to disclose classified
information. Bush said the provision interfered with his
``constitutional duty to protect such information'' and that he
wasn't going to obey it.
   On Friday, Bush signed a bill authorizing $9.8 billion for the
State Department for the next two years, but said he would not go
along with several key sections.
   Bush said he would refuse to obey a requirement that the
administration report to Congress future sensitive diplomatic
missions like national security adviser Brent Scowcroft's
clandestine trip last June to Beijing.
   Furthermore, he said he would disobey requirements that he
disclose any U.S. contacts with Palestine Liberation Organization
members who might be terrorists; and that he include members of
Congress in the U.S. delegation negotiating arms reductions in
Europe.
   In each instance, Bush cited interference with what he asserted
was his constitutional right to conduct foreign policy.
   Bush's initiatives were applauded by Mitch Daniels, who was
White House political director for former President Reagan and who
now is director of the Hudson Institute, a think tank in
Indianapolis.
   ``I think it's an important step by Bush to reclaim the rightful
presidential prerogative. This has really gotten to the ridiculous
stage, where massive authorization bills not only attempt to hogtie
the administration, but sometimes even with language that no one
really voted for,'' Daniels said.
   ``I like the style, he's done it quietly,'' he said.
   Since the Supreme Court, and not the executive branch, has the
final say on what's constitutional, Bush's strategy seems destined
to end up in a court challenge.
   Still, Bush ``has long been concerned'' over what he views as
the erosion of the executive's constitutional powers by Congress
and ``he feels as president he has the constitutional duty'' to
refuse to obey laws that he thinks jeopardize his constitutional
powers, said deputy White House spokesman Alixe Glen.
   Bush's actions do not constitute a line-item veto as such, but
have some of the same impact. A line-item veto is the ability to
veto specific lines or sections of a spending bill while leaving
the rest standing, a power enjoyed by 43 governors but not by the
president.
   Most legal scholars _ although, significantly, not White House
lawyers _ claim line-item veto powers require an amendment to the
Constitution.
   Some conservatives, including White House counsel C. Boyden
Gray, claim that the president may already have such powers.
Congressional Democrats have said they'll sue the president if he
attempts to exert them.
   Gray is searching for a test case on which to try to exercise
line-item veto powers, aides said.

   Great Britain's Prince Charles is
calling on business leaders for a ``new deal'' in which capitalism
is more humane.
   ``The crucial factor is whether such an approach can be
commercial. And yet, surely, it must be good business in the long
run,'' the Prince of Wales told about 100 corporate executives
gathered for an international business conference Tuesday.
   The two-day meeting of Business in the Community, a London-based
group founded by the prince, brings corporate leaders together to
discuss the roles and responsibilities of business.
   Charles said business leaders cannot leave problems of the
environment and education only to the government. ``These are no
longer frontier days when businesses can afford to make short-term
decisions,'' he said.
   The prince will be in Charleston through today.
   Meanwhile, the prince's spokesman refuted reports that Charles'
wife Diana, Princess of Wales, is expecting a third child. ``There
is no truth to that,'' Philip Mackie said.

   CBS Records honored singer Michael
Jackson as the label's biggest money-maker of the 1980s, when fans
bought more than 110 million of his records.
   ``I have to say now, no album sells itself,'' the 31-year-old
singer said at a Tuesday news conference. ``It is up to the people
to buy it.''
   In a typically truncated speech, the gloved one thanked ``all
the children of the world,'' several record industry executives and
his parents.
   Jackson's output in the decade included the era's two
largest-selling albums, ``Bad'' and ``Thriller.''
   Tommy Mottolo, president of CBS Records, said, ``If I stood here
10 years ago and told you any artist would accomplish what Michael
Jackson accomplished, you would probably have laughed me off the
stage.''
   ``Thriller'' was the first album to generate seven Top 10
singles, including the title cut and ``Beat It.''
   There was some rain on Jackson's parade, though. Jackson was
named in an amended class-action lawsuit filed Tuesday in Seattle
that accuses him of using illness as an excuse to get out of three
concerts in the Tacoma Dome.
   No dollar amount was set. Lee Solters, a Los Angeles spokesman
for Jackson, said he had no comment.

   Former talk show host Morton Downey Jr. is
asking a federal bankruptcy court for protection from numerous
creditors, including banks, businesses, restaurants and jewelers,
according to court documents.
   Downey lists liabilities of nearly $2.4 million in a petition
filed Friday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court seeking protection under
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law.
   Downey attorney Brian D. Spector would not comment on whether
Downey's financial troubles were related to the demise of ``The
Morton Downey Jr. Show,'' which featured the host ranting and
taunting guests. The program was canceled after two years.
   Spector said his client, who lives in suburban Englewood, was
out of town and that he would advise him not to comment.
   Downey's creditors include more than 75 banks, businesses and
agencies _ including New York boutiques and restaurants _ a New
Jersey limousine service and New York City's Parking Violations
Bureau, court papers said.
   Listed among the 20 largest unsecured creditors are the New York
jewelers Bulgari and Cartier, which he owes $24,000 and $9,000,
respectively.

   Joe Montana broke tradition in failing to
show up at the Maxwell Football Club as its choice for NFL Player
of the Year, but the club was understanding.
   For the first time in the 30 years of the Bert Bell Award, the
club's NFL pick wasn't on hand for the award Tuesday night.
   Francis ``Reds'' Bagnell, president of the club, called it a
``great disappointment'' that the San Francisco 49ers' star
quarterback did not join Indiana running back Anthony Thompson,
winner of the club's Maxwell Award as college player of the year.
   It didn't come as a surprise, however. ``There was every
indication on an ongoing basis that he was reluctant about coming
because of his other commitments _ if he did one, he'd have to do
the others,'' Bagnell said.
   Bagnell said he believed Montana was on vacation in the Virgin
Islands with his family.
   Thompson showed up in a tuxedo with his Indiana coach, Bill
Mallory, to accept his award.

   The star of ``Tonight Live Starring
Freddie Roman'' at Trump Castle says his show's success has helped
him in many ways.
   ``For the first time I feel like I have a job,'' Roman said this
week. ``I've never gotten to stay in one place for more than six
weeks since I started in show business.''
   ``Tonight Live'' begins with Roman delivering his monologue
before presenting the night's talent. He interviews each act, six
days a week, and steps into the audience for a question-and-answer
session that gives him a chance to do some improvisational comedy.
   ``Tonight Live'' has been doing so well that its original
three-month stint has been extended, with the show now scheduled to
run until Labor Day. The casino is in discussions with a cable
television station to put together a ``best of'' show to air
monthly, Roman said.
   Roman has been a frequent guest on television's ``The Merv
Griffin Show,'' and ``Mike Douglas Show.'' His last film appearance
was in 1987's ``Sweet Lorraine,'' starring Maureen Stapleton.

   ``Driving Miss Daisy'' drove hard at the box
office, powered by its nine Oscar nominations, to collect $9.8
million for the holiday weekend.
   The story of a Southern widow (Jessica Tandy) and her black
chauffeur (Morgan Freeman) was nominated for best picture last
Wednesday, with its two stars and Dan Aykroyd in a supporting role
receiving acting nominations.
   The film averaged $7,040 per screen over the holiday weekend,
Exhibitor Relations Co. said in figures Tuesday.
   In second place was the Steven Seagal action movie ``Hard to
Kill,'' which grossed $8.4 million and has made more than $20
million in just two weeks of release.
   It was followed in third by the new Kevin Costner film
``Revenge.'' The film, receiving mixed but mostly negative reviews,
collected $6.1 million. ``Madhouse,'' a new film with John
Larroquette and Kirstie Alley as a couple entertaining impossible
house guests, had ticket sales of $5.2 million for fourth place.
   In fifth was director Oliver Stone's ``Born on the Fourth of
July,'' which snared eight Oscar nominations last week. It
collected $4.4 million.
   ``Nightbreed,'' a horror film from novelist Clive Barker, opened
in sixth place with a take of $3.7 million and a lackluster
per-screen average of $2,493. In seventh was Bette Midler's remake
``Stella,'' with receipts of $3 million.
   ``Glory,'' the melodramatic account of an all-black regiment
fighting in the Civil War, finished in eighth on grosses of $2.7
million. The animated hit ``The Little Mermaid'' landed in ninth
with a gate of $1.8 million.
   Rounding out the Top 10 was the ensemble drama ``Steel
Magnolias'' on a take of $1.6 million.
   The illiteracy drama ``Stanley &amp; Iris,'' with a weak $1.4
million for 11th, was spelling out as a flop after two weeks.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Monday as
tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross,
number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and
number of weeks in release.
   Figures are based on a combination of actual box-office receipts
and studio projections where actual figures are not immediately

<HEAD>IRS Finds Tax Deadbeats Among Fellow Agencies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least one federal agency is among the ranks
of deadbeats who don't pay their taxes on time, adding as much as
$250 million to the total of taxes owed but not turned over to the
Internal Revenue Service.
   In fact, IRS officials hint that several federal agencies
delayed handing over withheld taxes at one time or another,
prompting Rep. Byron L. Dorgan, D-N.D., to complain such actions
carry ``the definition of a tax deadbeat to a new low.''
   ``If the IRS can't make a federal agency own up to its tax
responsibility, who can they influence?'' Dorgan said Tuesday after
a hearing by the House Ways and Means oversight subcommittee on
taxes owed but not collected. The total of those 13 million
accounts receivable is rising by $11 million a day, to as high as
$87 billion.
   Dorgan said members of the subcommittee have information that
one federal agency was late in turning over more than $250 million
it had withheld from workers' paychecks.
   IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg Jr. acknowledged only that one
agency _ which he would not identify because of privacy laws _ was
once listed among taxpayers with a delinquency of $100 million or
more.
   However, Senior Deputy Commissioner Michael J. Murphy said that
when he served as director of the Philadelphia district office,
``we did have problems with some federal agencies.''
   When Dorgan said there is evidence that two major federal
agencies routinely delay making tax payments _ perhaps to avoid a
temporary budget crunch _ Charly Brennan, deputy commissioner for
operations, said, ``We will give you a report on it.''
   Goldberg said that although the agency can impose stiff
penalties on employers that are late in making tax payments, there
is no authority to penalize government agencies for the same
shortcoming.
   Goldberg and Jennie Stathis, a director of the General
Accounting Office, agreed that as little as $30 billion of the
gross $87 billion total of accounts receivable may be collectible.
   ``It is going to be tens of billions of dollars,'' Goldberg
said. ``Whether it's $30 billion or $40 billion, it's a lot of
money.'' He said the IRS has to abandon efforts to collect up to $3
billion each year, because of a six-year statute of limitations.
   Goldberg acknowledged the IRS has no way of knowing how much can
be collected or even why the delinquency figure continues to grow.
   He said the IRS will be able to cut into accounts receivable if
Congress approves the $50 million that President Bush asked to add
1,000 personnel to the agency's 20,000-employee collection division
next year. He noted the IRS has under way a long-term plan to
modernize its computer systems.
   Goldberg and Robert M. Tobias, president of the National
Treasury Employees Union, which represents most IRS employees,
criticized the up-one-year, down-the-next spending for IRS workers.
   Goldberg said about $25 billion of the $87 billion accounts
receivable is considered currently not collectible and unlikely to
be collected in the future. An account is given this label when,
for example, a corporation goes out of business or the IRS
determines an individual is unable to pay.
   The remaining $62 billion involves about 13 million accounts
receivable, including 3,300 that total more than $14 billion.
Goldberg said 17 accounts totaling $5.4 billion involve at least
$100 million each. Much of the total is not collectible because it
is bloated by duplications and by errors by the IRS and taxpayers.
   Goldberg defended the IRS's record. ``Between 1984 and 1989 we
collected over $5 trillion in revenue,'' he noted. ``Our current
(accounts receivable) inventory is less than 2 percent of that
amount. And we will ultimately collect most of what is due.''

<HEAD>32nd Annual Awards Offers Chance for Beatles Reunion _ Sort Of</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 32nd annual Grammy Awards offered a
chance for a reunion of sorts for the three surviving Beatles at
the Shrine Auditorium.
   Two former members of the Fab Four, George Harrison and Ringo
Starr, were in contention for Grammys tonight and the third
surviving member, Paul McCartney, was chosen in advance to receive
an honor for his lifetime achievements.
   Former Beatle John Lennon was killed in a December 1980, attack
by a deranged fan.
   Harrison, as part of the all-star Traveling Wilburys, was up for
album of the year and best vocal rock group performance for the LP
``Traveling Wilburys Volume One.''
   Starr's teaming with Buck Owens on the single ``Act Naturally''
earned a bid for best country vocal collaboration.
   McCartney and jazz artist Miles Davis were chosen to receive
Lifetime Achievement Awards from the National Academy of Recording
Arts &amp; Sciences.
   The Academy said McCartney would be honored on stage, receiving
the award from actress Meryl Streep. It was unknown whether
Harrison and Starr would be on hand.
   A three-hour CBS-TV broadcast of top pop, rock, country and rap
awards, as well as the coveted song-, album- and record-of-the-year
awards was scheduled to be broadcast to the East at 8 p.m. EST and
by tape-delay to the West.
   The bulk of about six dozen winners out of nearly 400 nominees
were to be announced in a fast-paced, non-televised ceremony before
the broadcast.
   Top nominees for the best music recordings of 1989 included Don
Henley with four nominations on the strength of his ``The End of
the Innocence'' album and rock star Prince, who had four bids based
on his work for the ``Batman'' movie soundtrack.
   Bette Midler, Bonnie Raitt, Tom Petty, Billy Joel, Linda
Ronstadt, the Rolling Stones, the late Roy Orbison, Neil Young, Lou
Reed and Joe Cocker were among familiar names up for awards.
   Fine Young Cannibals, U-2, Janet Jackson, Bobby Brown, Anita
Baker, k.d. lang, Randy Travis, Lyle Lovett and Rodney Crowell were
also among nominees.
   Neneh Cherry, Indigo Girls, Milli Vanilli, Soul II Soul and Tone
Loc were best new artist nominees.

<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people crowded the
sidewalk of Bucharest's main street, waiting in line not for some
rarely seen delicacy but for copies of a previously banned book
full of drawings.
   The coveted book is the work of Romanian cartoonist Mihai
Stanescu, whose acid cartoons had belittled the ``Golden Epoch'' of
ousted and executed Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   The dictator banned Stanescu's books.
   The police and army were called to keep order as the lines
snaked toward the Dalles Gallery, where Stanescu was signing copies
of the book, ``Now Is Not the Moment,'' and a poster showing how
Romania had rejoined Europe after the December revolution which
toppled the Ceausescus.
   Most buyers who lined up last week knew about Stanescu's
cartoons bacause a photocopy of the volume had been smuggled into
the country bere the revolution and circulated all over Bucharest.
   Costel Despa, a 28-year-old mechanic, said waiting four hours in
line was worth it. ``This book is very good for all ages and can be
understood by everyone,'' he said.
   ``Mihai Stanescu is the only one who told the truth, and he was
not afraid,'' said another man, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In an interview later, Stanescu _ still nursing a sore hand from
signing his name about 5,000 times _ said his popularity helped
keep him from arrest under Ceausescu.
   He said that with his favorite targets gone, he now was eying
Romania's interim government and more than 40 political parties.
But so far, he hasn't found much humor in them.
   ``Before, when the regime was evil, my work was motivated by
hate,'' he said. ``Today I must base myself solely on humor _ it
can be more difficult.''
   While sipping passion fruit tea from an ``I Love London'' mug in
his studio, he said he was ``very optimistic'' about Romania's
return to democracy.
   ``I say this despite the fact that the Romanian people are not
politically mature,'' he said. ``I think the front is sincere and
we are on our way to pluralistic democracy,'' he added, referring
to the National Salvation Front.
   The front ruled Romania for six weeks after the revolution, and
now shares power with 37 other parties in the Provisional Council
of National Unity.
   ``Now Is Not The Moment'' was published in paperback in France
by Bernard Barrault several years ago. A hardback edition in color
will be published this spring.
   The preface was signed by Minister of Culture Andrei Plesu and
Octavian Paler, editor of Romania Libera, Romania's most widely
read newspaper, and a member of the Group for Social Dialogue,
comprised of the country's intellectual elite.
   Stanescu said 100,000 copies had been brought to Romania and a
few were still on sale.
   The book includes his cartoon of the Berlin Wall, with thousands
of people pressing against it and one man peering through a tiny
exit overlooking a cliff. It won first prize in the Third Yomiuri
International Cartoon Contest in Tokyo in 1982.
   Stanescu's studio is filled with cartoons, books and T-shirts on
subjects from New York City to glasnost.
   Foreign diplomats smuggled his cartoons out of the country
during Ceausescu's dictatorship.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Francis Keppel, a Harvard University lecturer who
was U.S. commissioner of education under Presidents Kennedy and
Johnson, died at the university at age 73.
   Keppel, who died Monday at Harvard's Stillman Infirmary, was
considered a leader in education. He was commissioner of education
from 1962 to 1966 and was dean of the Ivy League school's Graduate
School of Education from 1948 to 1962.
   Since 1974, Keppel had been director of the educational policy
program of the Aspen Institute and was an adviser to libraries, art
centers and the World Bank.
   Keppel led the drive for passage of the Elementary Secondary
Education Act of 1965, which focused resources on classroom
assistance for poor children. He was also closely involved in
enforcing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as it applied to equal
access to education, and created was the National Assessment of
Education Progress.
   ``Harvard and the nation lose one of their great public servants
with the death of Frank Keppel,'' Harvard president Derek Bok said
in a statement. ``He was a modest, ethical man; few can equal his
lifelong dedication to improving education.''
   Keppel received his A.B. degree from Harvard in 1938, and
studied sculpture for a year at the American Academy in Rome. He
resumed academic studies while serving as an assistant dean at
Harvard College from 1939 to 1941.
   During World War II, he was secretary of the Joint Army and Navy
Committee on Welfare and Recreation, then joined the Army, rising
from private to lieutenant. He left the Army in 1946.
   Two years later, Keppel became dean of the Graduate School of
Education. He promoted a master of arts in teaching program and
other innovations in teaching.
   Keppel is survived by his wife, Edith Sawin Keppel of Cambridge,
two daughters, a brother and four grandchildren.
   A mermorial service was to be held Friday at the Memorial Church
in Harvard Yard.

<HEAD>Democratic Leaders Weigh New Income Tax Credit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley says an income
tax credit could be good way to help workers offset some of their
Social Security payroll taxes.
   Foley told reporters Tuesday that the idea, one of several top
Democrats are studying to deal with the giant Social Security trust
fund surplus, is ``a very interesting proposal.''
   ``It would I think tend to restore some progressivity to the tax
system, and it has other features I think are worthy of very
serious consideration,'' said Foley, D-Wash.
   Leading House and Senate Democrats are looking for ways to
address questions that have been raised about the Social Security
payroll tax and the surplus it has raised that some say is
disguising the true size of the overall federal deficit. One option
under study would let workers take a credit on their income tax
return for a portion of the payroll tax they pay.
   Led by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., critics have said
the Social Security levy discriminates against low- and
middle-income people. Moynihan has proposed legislation slashing
the payroll tax rate.
   Workers pay a 7.65 percent Social Security payroll tax, an
amount that is in addition to their income tax. Employers must also
pay the government an equal amount on behalf of each employee.
   The tax is levied only on the first $51,300 of annual earnings.
People pay no payroll tax on their wages above that amount and pay
no payroll tax on income from interest, dividends, rents and other
non-wage earnings. As a result, wealthier people pay
proportionately smaller payroll taxes than lower-income people.
   Sources, speaking on condition they not be identified, said
Democratic aides have not decided how large the income-tax credit
would be, who would be eligible or when it would begin.
   By letting workers recover some of their payroll tax payments by
claiming income tax credits, the plan could blunt Bush
administration charges that Democrats want to make changes in the
Social Security system.
   ``Its one great source of appeal obviously is you don't have to
do anything about the Social Security trust fund,'' said one source.
   Moynihan's plan would cut the government's payroll tax
collections by $62 billion over the next two years, a sizeable
addition to what is already an expected $138 billion budget deficit
for this year. It has been criticized by Senate Finance Committee
Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas; House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.; the American Association of
Retired Persons and the National Association of Manufacturers.
   But the plan is believed to have the support of many members of
Congress because it would cut taxes.
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., said
Tuesday there is ``a large, fluid body'' of senators undecided
about Moynihan's bill. He predicted there ``could be a stampede in
favor of the Moynihan proposal'' should there be a vote on it.
   The group studying the Social Security question hopes to make a
recommendation as early as this week. It consists of Bentsen,
Rostenkowski, Sasser, Senate Majority Leader Richard Gephardt,
D-Mo., and House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif.
   This year, the Social Security trust fund is expected to have a
$66 billion surplus.

<HEAD>Union Calls on President to Salute the Flag With Holiday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Federation of Federal Employees
says President Bush should ``stand behind his words and embrace the
flag'' by making Flag Day a federal holiday.
   In a statement Tuesday, the union said it has written the
president, who has often expressed his devotion to the American
flag, urging him to give government employees the day off.
   Flag Day is June 14.
   Although it is printed in the calendar, ``it comes and goes
every year with little or no recognition,'' said James M. Peirce,
president of the union.
   Bush used the flag heavily in his presidential campaign and
wound up his acceptance speech at the 1988 Republican National
Convention by leading delegates in the Pledge of Allegiance.
   He later criticized his Democratic opponent, Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis, for vetoing a bill that would have penalized
schoolteachers who failed to lead their students in the pledge.
   He has also advocated a constitutional amendment to bar
desecration of the flag in response to a Supreme Court ruling that
burning a flag was a protected form of free speech under the First
Amendment.
   ``NFFE strongly agrees with the president that Americans should
salute the flag, rather than desecrate it,'' the employees' union
said. ``Now it is time for President Bush to stand behind his words
and embrace the flag by giving federal workers a day to honor and
celebrate this great American institution.''
   There was no immediate comment from the White House, where press
officers were in a meeting.
   Jane Polanksy, spokesperson for the federation, said the union
made no endorsement in the presidential campaign.

<TEXT>
   A janitor infected with the AIDS virus filed a
lawsuit against a hospital, saying he has been going through ``a
living death'' since a contaminated needle in trash he was ordered
to remove punctured his leg.
   The 22-year-old Guatemalan immigrant filed suit against Cedars
Medical Center Tuesday in Dade Circuit Court after negotiations
with the hospital's insurance carriers failed to reach an
acceptable settlement, his lawyer said.
   ``Cedars' negligence has effectively condemned the plaintiff to
a living and premature death,'' said Miami attorney Ellis Rubin in
the suit filed on behalf of the young man identified only as ``Jose
Doe.''
   The suit does not name a monetary figure, but Rubin said he will
seek several million dollars.
   ``Money can never give me back the rest of my life that has been
taken away from me,'' Doe said Tuesday in a statement. ``I can
never have children and I am going through a living death.''
   The suit claims the worker was ordered on Jan. 13, 1989, to
remove garbage and medical waste from a vacant room most recently
occupied by a patient being treated for human immunodeficency
virus, which causes AIDS.
   The worker, hired to clean floors and empty trash from
storerooms and snack rooms, was not told about the condition of the
patient and was never trained in the proper disposal of
contaminated medical waste, the suit said.
   The worker removed the medical waste in a red plastic bag and
was bumped by someone getting onto an elevator. A contaminated
needle inside the bag jabbed the worker's left calf, the suit
alleged.
   ``The live virus was pumped directly into the plaintiff's
bloodstream,'' the suit said.
   The worker was immediately given a blood test, which found no
trace of the AIDS virus. But the suit said a follow-up test on
March 7, 1989, found he had the AIDS antibodies.
   The suit said the worker had not had sex since late 1987, and is
not an intravenous drug user or transfusion recipient.
   Rubin said his client has experienced nightmares and severe
anxiety attacks since learning he has contracted AIDS.
   The suit claims Cedars was negligent for allowing an untrained
janitor to remove HIV-contaminated waste and carry it by elevator
to the incinerator, which violates rules on transportation of
medical waste.
   Miles McGrane, an attorney for the hospital, was in St. Louis on
Tuesday and unavailable for comment, his secretary said.
   Doe is still working at the hospital for Servicemaster Co.,
which contracts janitorial services. He is the sole financial
support for his mother, two sisters and three brothers, Rubin said.
   ``This is the most tragic case I've ever had,'' said Rubin.
``Fate, God, or whatever you want to call it touched Jose Doe on
Friday the 13th.''
   Since the early 1980s, 19 health-care workers in the United
States have been infected with the HIV virus from job-related
activities, including 12 from needle jabs, said Charles Fallis, a
spokesman with the national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
   In New York City last month, trial began in a $175 million
lawsuit filed by an AIDS-infected doctor who claims she was stuck
with a contaminated needle when she reached into a pile of gauze
and bed linens in 1983.

<HEAD>DOT Sees Greater Risk of Cancer in Airliners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Transportation says the risk
of cancer among airline crew members from cosmic radiation is
nearly 17 times greater than it reported last week.
   The DOT on Tuesday acknowledged an error in a major study
assessing airliner cabin environment. Officials said the error
occurred when a researcher copied figures from the wrong table.
   The report originally estimated that cosmic radiation could
cause from 5 to 61 additional deaths from cancer per 100,000 crew
members flying for 20 years.
   The revised figures put this at up to 1,000 additional deaths
per 100,000 for crew members who fly long routes about twice a week
and about 500 deaths per 100,000 among passengers who fly long
routes once a week.
   These deaths would be in addition to the expectation that 22,000
out of 100,000 _ about one out of five _ people will die of cancer
from all causes.
   Officials cautioned, however, that the risk data is not based on
any study of actual cancer cases but on mathematical models
projecting the effects of low-level cosmic radiation based on what
is known about higher radiation doses.
   Bob Marx, DOT spokesman, said officials are concerned about the
radiation risk to airliner crews and the Federal Aviation
Administration plans to issue a warning document.

   The House Agriculture Committee is questioning
the Bush administration's tight-money budget policy toward
agriculture while the White House calls for increases in
controversial weapons systems.
   During a hearing Tuesday on the 1990 farm bill, Rep. Jim Jontz,
D-Ind., asked Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter how much he
recommended that the Office of Management and Budget allow for
commodity programs in fiscal 1991.
   Jontz said that in light of increases in spending requested by
the administration for the B-2 stealth bomber, Strategic Defense
Initiative and foreign aid, ``we ought to do better.''
   Yeutter did not say how much he recommended, saying only he'd
asked for more than the $11.8 billion OMB projected for commodity
program outlays.
   ``We got all we could reasonably expect,'' said Yeutter.
   Before Yeutter testified, the Agriculture Committee approved a
letter to the House Budget Committee saying it ``must take
exception with the budget proposals submitted by President Bush.''
   ``The unspecified reduction of $1.5 billion in 1991 commodity
spending, increasing to over $19 billion through 1995, is an
unreasonably high 13 percent of commodity program outlays,'' said
the letter from committee Chairman Kika de la Garza and ranking
Republican Rep. Edward Madigan, R-Ill.
   ``Not only is this disproportionate when compared with other
major programs, it threatens disruption of a delicate recovery of
agricultural financial institutions,'' the letter said.
   De la Garza told Yeutter he thought it was wrong that
agriculture, although only 1 percent of the total federal budget,
was being asked to come up with 18 percent of the cuts needed to
reduce the deficit in fiscal 1991.
   The committee chairman said he was tired of the ``obsession with
bashing the farmer'' over the federal government's program for
guaranteeing farmers a certain price for particular commodities.
   ``It there is any subsidy, it's the American consumer being
subsidized on the backs of the American farmer,'' de la Garza said.
   Defenders of the farm subsidy programs often point out U.S.
consumers spend a smaller proportion of their disposable income on
food than consumers in other countries.
   The debate over commodity support in the 1990 farm bill, which
sets policy for five years, is expected to be heated. But Congress
is still in the developmental stage on the legislation.
   Another heavily debated issue is crop insurance, which Yeutter
wants eliminated in favor of permanent disaster aid legislation.
Nearly every member at the hearing showed support for improving
crop insurance rather than eliminating it.
   ``Crop insurance as we now have it will not continue,'' said de
la Garza. But he said the House will propose an ``actuarily sound''
system of insurance rather than permanent disaster aid.
   Congress established the federally subsidized crop insurance
program in 1980 to insure 50 crops that are vulnerable to drought
or other natural disaster, but farmer participation has been
largely voluntary. During the 1988 and 1989 droughts, Congress
provided additional money to cover crop losses that were not
insured.
   Yeutter said he didn't have confidence the insurance program
could be made actuarily sound because participation is so low.
   In other areas covered by the farm bill, Yeutter said:
   _the American Soybean Association's graduated equity loan
program proposal is ``an expensive proposition'' which the
administration does not think the country can afford.
   _he is not recommending any changes in the sugar program because
sugar ``is a multilateral issue. We ought to deal with it in the
Uruguay Round,'' the international trade talks scheduled to be
completed by the end of the year.
   _the Farmers Home Administration needs tightening because ``it
has tilted over the last decade or so into a grant agency. ... The
whole program has gone off on a tangent'' which is costing the
taxpayers too much money.

<HEAD>Mayor Barry to Move to New Treatment Clinic, Sources Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry, who was indicted last week
on cocaine possession and perjury charges, will continue his
substance abuse treatment at a South Carolina hospital, top city
officials say.
   The mayor, who has been receiving treatment for what an aide
described as an alcohol problem, planned to enter the Fenwick Hall
Hospital near Charleston, S.C., as soon as today, sources said.
   Barry decided to enter the new program at the urging of his wife
Effi, one city official said Tuesday. That official and the other
sources commented only on condition they not be named.
   Meanwhile, Barry's attorney, R. Kenneth Mundy, was granted a
one-week postponement of the mayor's federal arraignment on three
felony perjury and five misdemeanor cocaine possession charges. In
his motion, Mundy said the mayor's treatment would be interrupted
if he had to return to the nation's capital for a court appearance.
   Judy Smith, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens,
said Barry's appearance will be required at the arraignment, now
scheduled for Feb. 28.
   Mundy has said the mayor will enter innocent pleas to all
charges.
   In a political development Tuesday, Democratic mayoral hopeful
Sharon Pratt Dixon called on Barry to resign. Dixon said both Barry
and the city need time to heal.
   The mayor has resisted calls for resignation.
   Barry enrolled at the Hanley-Hazelden Clinic in West Palm Beach,
Fla., four days after his Jan. 18 arrest on a misdemeanor cocaine
possession charge. He had considered extending his treatment there
past the 28-day original program, sources said, but top city
officials told him that doing so would make it appear that the
treatment had failed.
   ``We convinced him that what he needs now is after-care,
convalescence,'' said one city official familiar with Barry's
planning.
   City Administrator Carol B. Thompson and Barry's chief of staff,
Maudine Cooper, met with the mayor in Florida over the weekend to
discuss new treatment options, the officials said.
   One source said both city officials and Mrs. Barry wanted the
mayor away from reporters. Barry issued a statement Monday asking
the news media to respect his privacy and that of other patients at
the Florida treatment center.
   Fenwick Hall is on John's Island outside Charleston.

   The nearly 1,700 Appalachian miners who
ratified a contract with Pittston Coal Group after a 10{-month
strike prepared to go back to their jobs this week, but not
everyone is happy about it.
   In the eastern Kentucky coal town of McAndrews, any plans to
celebrate were tempered by the uncertain fate of 13 miners facing
suspension during the bitter labor dispute.
   Pittston President Michael Odom, who announced the return to
work, says most of the United Mine Workers in Virginia, West
Virginia and Kentucky will be back on their jobs by Monday. The
first shifts begin Thursday night.
   ``We're going to go about the business now of mining coal,'' UMW
Vice President Cecil Roberts said Tuesday during a news conference
to announce that the contract, replacing an agreement that expired
in February 1988, was ratified by 63-37 percent.
   The miners got the job security and health and retirement
provisions they sought, and Pittston won the right to operate
round-the-clock, with voluntary labor Sunday morning and afternoon.
   Now the UMW leadership must turn its attention to Circuit Judge
Donald McGlothlin, who rejected a request by union and company
attorneys to drop $64 million in fines against the UMW but gave
them until Thursday to try to change his mind.
   Still on the minds of many was the fate of 13 miners the union
expects Pittston to suspend for alleged misconduct during the
strike.
   Members of Local 5737 at McAndrews campaigned to defeat the
contract because it failed to guarantee the miners' jobs.
   Many miners had expected the local to handily defeat the
contract as a statement of union solidarity for the 13.
   Afterward, some spoke bitterly about the local's rejection of
the agreement in a 96-93 vote.
   ``To me, it's the end of the union,'' said Ann Osborne, wife of
a striking miner. ``I still say a man who voted yes on that
contract is no better than a scab ... .''
   Jack Clevenger Jr., a retired miner, said those who voted for
the contract ``were independent people voting for themselves.''
   The contract's approval probably will cause tension in the
local, and he expected ``it's going to take time to heal it.''
   The specific allegations against the 13 miners would be detailed
after contract ratification, said Glenn Stanley, the local's
president. The cases then would be turned over to an arbitrator for
settlement.
   The Pittston dispute was marred by sporadic violence, but
Roberts said: ``We all learned some lessons from this strike; it's
better to talk than to fight.''
   Roberts and Odom agreed it will take some time for the harsh
feelings between the union and company to heal, but both predicted
the animosity will be short-lived.
   ``A lot of times two tough kids on the block have a fight and
become the best of friends afterward,'' Odom said.
   Odom declined to predict how long it would take to get back to
full production, but he noted the union employees were enthusiastic
as strikers and will be enthusiastic as workers.
   ``Everyone seems really happy to go back to work,'' said Roger
Caldwell, a field representative for the UMW in Logan, W.Va.
``Overall it's a contract they can live with.''
   In eastern Kentucky, residents and business owners in Pike
County were happy the strike was ending.
   ``Everybody's just tickled that it's over,'' said Eva Ryan, who
operates a motel in Toler near the Kentucky-West Virginia border.
``Everybody's for the miners. We want them to get what they want.''
   Logan County in West Virginia has been the focus of most
strike-related violence since about 300 miners walked off the job
at Pittston there.
   ``When the mining industry gets sick, Logan County gets
pneumonia,'' said Mark Spurlock, a Logan County commissioner.
``We're overjoyed that it's been settled, apparently with a
contract that's well thought of by the miners.''

<HEAD>Families Don't Always Win Battle Against Hunger, Congress Told</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hunger is not just an abstract political
debate _ it can be a daily battle for poor families, a pair of
mothers on welfare told members of Congress.
   And it's a battle the families don't always win, they said.
   ``My children are always asking for food,'' said Peggy Adams, a
mother of nine from Montgomery County, Md.
   ``You may think that's fairly typical for children, and maybe it
is, but half of the time I don't have enough food to feed them
whenever they are hungry,'' she said.
   Mary Tamper, a Prince George's County, Md., mother of two, told
a similar story Tuesday to members of the Senate Budget Committee.
   ``There were times when my son would say, `Mom, I know you just
fed me, but I'm still hungry,''' she said. ``This hurt me more than
any knife, especially when there was no food in the cupboard.''
   Both testified in the Senate committee's hearings on hunger and
the Bush administration's proposals for food and nutritional
funding.
   Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Budget Committee, said
the Bush administration's budget proposal for fiscal 1991 cuts $462
million from the child nutrition budget and freezes the food stamp
program.
   ``It is a budget that goes in the wrong direction as far as
hungry Americans are concerned,'' Sasser said.
   He said he believed Congress will support higher spending for
nutrition programs for families with children.
   Dr. Victor W. Sidel, a social medicine professor at Albert
Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, N.Y., cited estimates
that 2 million to 5 million low-income children in the United
States are hungry _ and that the figure could go as high as 9
million.
   He said hungry children suffer twice as many illnesses as other
children, and he charged the nation's record on child and prenatal
nutrition was ``obscene.''
   ``A nation that permits its children to go hungry cannot claim
moral leadership,'' Sidel said.
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., ranking Republican on the panel,
defended the Bush administration's budget proposal, saying some
cuts in eligibility for school lunch assistance may be warranted
and that food stamp assistance levels were adequate in some cases.
   Both Mrs. Tamper and Mrs. Adams said the federal Women, Infants
and Children program _ providing food assistance for pregnant
mothers and their children up to age 5 _ filled the gaps after they
found themselves thrust into poverty.
   ``All I can say is, thank God for WIC,'' said Mrs. Tamper.
   Although the assistance is provided for the youngest children
and their mothers, both mothers said they used the WIC food to feed
the whole family.
   Both described a sudden descent from middle class to welfare and
poverty after losing their husbands' income.
   Mrs. Tamper's husband died after being diagnosed with leukemia.
She said she was forced to give up her job as a teacher's aide for
a time, and that they moved in with her mother while relying on
Social Security Survivor Benefits, rent subsidies and other
assistance.
   Mrs. Adams said her family lost its $55,000 annual income when
she and her husband were separated and he was sentenced to prison.
She said her family has benefited from food stamps, public
assistance and WIC.
   Despite the aid, she said, her 9-year-old son's weight has
dropped from 65 pounds to 60 pounds, and her 5-year-old son has
dropped a size in clothing. Her 8-year-old twins haven't outgrown
their clothes in two years.
   ``I have seen my children's bodies stop growing like they
should, and I pray it's not their brains as well,'' Mrs. Adams said.

<HEAD>Hands of Clock May Move Away From Nuclear Midnight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Keepers of the Doomsday Clock say the world is
moving drastically away from the threat of nuclear war.
   For years the Doomsday Clock on the cover of The Bulletin of the
Atomic Scientists has been ticking back and forth toward midnight,
an indication of the state of superpower relations.
   After standing at six minutes before midnight _ or the threat of
nuclear war _ for two years, the Bulletin's April edition may turn
the clock back, reflecting recent reforms in the Soviet Union and
its Eastern European allies.
   Editor Len Ackland said Tuesday that a decision hasn't been made
on where the clock's hands will be in April.
   But Nobel laureate Leon M. Lederman, director emeritus of the
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory outside Chicago and one of
the scientists whose opinions influence the clock's movement, said,
``I wanted the hands to move back the most. The danger of military
confrontation between the superpowers and the credibility of that
threat is lessening every hour.''
   The clock first appeared on the June 1947 Bulletin to evoke the
image of the apocalypse _ universal conflagration bursting forth at
the darkest hour _ and of military attack, with the countdown to
zero hour, Ackland said.
   The clock was closest to midnight _ two minutes away _ in 1953,
after the United States successfully tested the hydrogen bomb.
   It was farthest from midnight _ 12 minutes _ in 1963, after the
signing of the Partial Test Ban Treaty, and again in 1972, when the
Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty was signed.
   It last moved in 1988, shifting back from three minutes before
midnight to six minutes away, due in large part to the U.S.-Soviet
treaty eliminating intermediate-range nuclear missiles, Ackland
said.
   The Bulletin was founded in 1945 by scientists who worked at the
University of Chicago on the Manhattan Project _ the successful
U.S. effort to build an atomic bomb during World War II. Among its
founders were J. Robert Oppenheimer, sometimes called the father of
the atomic bomb, and Albert Einstein.
   The magazine, published by the Educational Foundation for
Nuclear Science, has 17,000 subscribers in 70 countries.
   The magazine's worldwide Board of Scientific Sponsors debates
the international climate through letters and over the telephone to
determine whether the hands of the clock should move.
   The sponsors make their recommendations to the Bulletin's board
of directors and editors, who have the final say.
   Lederman, a member of both boards, said he believes that since
World War II, the world has never been further from nuclear war
than it is now, though he added it will be hard for bureaucrats to
stop asking for huge military expenditures.
   But despite the general view among Bulletin sponsors that the
threat of nuclear war is diminishing, some note changes that could
pose a threat to peace.
   ``They are concerned by the growth of nationalism, strident
nationalism in Eastern Europe and other places,'' said Lederman,
who won the 1988 Nobel Prize in physics.

   People in the 22nd century will no longer have
to go the store to shop but the kids will still go to school to
learn, say junior and senior high school students who responded to
a national survey.
   Results of the survey of 12,300 youngsters were announced by the
National Society of Professional Engineers Tuesday.
   The survey was conducted in December by the society's National
Engineers Week committee and Science World, a scholastic magazine
distributed in classrooms.
   Seventeen percent of the students said all shopping would
eventually be done from home. The remaining 83 percent said most of
it would be.
   Asked whether people would still go to schools to learn things,
68 percent said yes.
   Eighty percent of the students predicted Americans would be
working in space in the year 2100. Sixty-three percent said they
would also be living in space.
   Only 24 percent believed people would learn to control the
weather.
   More than one in every 10 students, or 11 percent, said the
average life span would be more than 125 years. Thirty-three
percent said it would be 100 years and 18 percent said it would be
80.
   Fifty-one percent of the students said people will be able to
buy artificial body parts, such as knees, ``off the shelf.''
   A slight majority, 51 percent, believed Earthlings will be
communicating with extraterrestrial beings in the 22nd century.
   The students also were asked how tall the tallest buildings
would be. Twenty-four percent said 300 stories, 28 percent 500
stories, 17 percent 1,000 stories and 32 percent even higher.
   Most of the students, 55 percent, said the average work week
will be shorter, but 17 percent said it will be longer. Twenty-nine
percent thought it would be the same.
   Just half of those responding predicted that solar energy will
be the main energy source in the century after the next. Sixteen
percent chose nuclear power.

   The rights of endangered children sometimes
outweigh an adult's right against self-incrimination, the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled in the case of a mother jailed for refusing to
disclose her son's whereabouts.
   The court ruled 7-2 Tuesday that Jacqueline Bouknight of
Baltimore may continue to be jailed indefinitely for refusing to
tell authorities where her 3-year-old son, Maurice, can be found.
   Social service workers fear the boy is dead.
   ``The bottom line is the court is following an equation that
says if we think it's important enough, individual rights have to
give way. Here we think the rights of children, the concern for
children, is important enough,'' said Mary Cheh, professor of
constitutional law at George Washington University in Washington,
D.C.
   But a defense attorney said the punishment has not worked, and
announced plans to file a motion in Circuit Court in Baltimore
seeking the immediate release of Bouknight, who has been held in a
city jail since April 1988.
   ``Twenty-two months of incarceration has had no effect on Ms.
Bouknight's position. It is against the law to keep her there.
There is no reason for the court to reasonably believe that
continued incarceration would do anything else,'' defense lawyer M.
Cristina Gutierrez said.
   Maurice has been missing since September 1987, when he was 11
months old.
   When he was 3 months old, Maurice was admitted to a Baltimore
hospital for treatment of a broken leg and other injuries. He was
held temporarily in protective care.
   He was returned to his mother after she agreed to undergo
training in parenting skills and said she would not physically
punish him.
   Maurice's father was shot to death two years ago and his mother
had a history of drug use, according to testimony in juvenile court.
   Nine months later, social workers said Bouknight was not
cooperating with them. She was held in contempt by a judge after
she refused to disclose Maurice's whereabouts.
   The Maryland Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, ruled
Dec. 19 that jailing Bouknight for refusing to disclose the
information violated her constitutional protection against
self-incrimination. That ruling was overturned Tuesday.
   Society's interest in protecting the boy from harm prevails over
the mother's claim that her right against self-incrimination will
be violated if she is forced to reveal the child's whereabouts, the
Supreme Court said.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the court that Ms.
Bouknight's claim that her constitutional rights are being violated
is particularly weak because of her agreement with welfare
officials.
   ``Concern for the child's safety,'' O'Connor said, ``underlay
the efforts to gain access to and then compel production of''
Bouknight's son.
   But Justice Thurgood Marshall, in a dissenting opinion, accused
the court of ``riding roughshod'' over individual rights.
   Public defender George Burns Jr., who represented Bouknight,
said the ruling indicated that if she were forced to disclose
information on the whereabouts of the boy, the information might
not be able to be used against her in a criminal proceeding.
   ``There is at least the suggestion that if the state forced her
to talk or produce something, that they may not let the state use
that in a criminal proceeding _ a kind of limited immunity
statute,'' Burns said.
   Some observers said the ruling could provide a new weapon for
officials seeking to protect children from parental abuse.
   Ernie Allen, president of the Center for Missing and Exploited
Children, in Arlington, Va., said the court recognized that the
privilege against self-incrimination is limited.
   ``In a case like this, there is a legitimate, valid public
purpose for the state to act and intervene to do what it can to
protect the safety of a child,'' Allen said.
   Mitchell Merviss, the attorney representing Maurice, said
parents have to be accountable to society for the care they give
their children.
   ``Our hope is the mother will cooperate now. That's her
choice,'' he said.

   A pharmaceutical company said today it will
make up to $10 million worth of an antibiotic available to homeless
families.
   The antibiotic, Suprax, will be distributed through vouchers
issued by community health centers, according to a statement from
Lederle Laboratories, the company making the grant.
   The vouchers will be issued through 600 community-based health
centers affiliated with the National Association of Community
Health Centers.
   Lederle, based in Wayne, N.J., also is giving $1 million to the
Children's Health Fund to help bring health care to homeless
families and children. The group, co-founded by Dr. Irwin Redlener
of the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, pioneered programs
to reach the homeless, including the first mobile health units for
the homeless in New York City.
   Lederle said the recently developed antibiotic is especially
suited for homeless families because it requires no refrigeration
and only one dose per day is necessary to treat both middle ear
infections and bronchitis.
   Middle ear infection is one of the most common childhood
diseases and bronchitis is a common ailment among homeless adults.
   The $10 million will cover the cost of treating 330,000
patients, according to Lederle. A course of treatment consists of 1
dose per day for 10 straight days.
   The grant was being formally announced today in Washington at a
news conference with Sens. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., and Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn.
   Dodd is chairman of the Labor and Human Resources subcommittee
on children, family, drugs and alcoholism, which has been holding
hearings on the problems of homeless children.

   A sheriff who took over a National
Guard armory as a remedy to jail overcrowding promised not to back
down as state lawyers worked to oust him.
   ``Right from the beginning, I planned on digging in,'' Michael
Ashe said. ``That's where I'm at. I want to indicate that I'm not
above the law. I don't feel I violated any law.''
   At a hearing in Hampden Superior Court Tuesday, Judge George
Keady granted state officials 48 hours to come up with arguments
why Ashe should stop using the armory. Attorneys representing the
county had asked that the situation be made permanent.
   State officials say Ashe has no business using the armory as
temporary quarters for overflow prisoners. But Ashe said the
alternative was putting the prisoners on the street.
   The sheriff said he is backed up by a 17th-century statute
commanding him to keep the peace.
   ``I can understand the National Guard feeling put upon, being
thrust into a situation ... all I can say is this was not done
irrationally,'' Ashe said.
   The sheriff fended off eviction Monday when a judge granted a
temporary restraining order ruling that the prisoners could stay
put. Life at the temporary jail became a little more comfortable
when the judge ordered the National Guard to turn over keys to the
showers and kitchen.
   Tuesday, a lone patrol car sat in the armory's parking lot.
Unauthorized visitors were shooed away by deputies keeping close
guard on the door. The 15 prisoners quartered in bunk beds on the
armory's drill floor were busy at their daytime jobs, said Richard
McCarthy, Ashe's spokesman.
   The Hampden County jail, built to hold 279 inmates and under
federal orders to house no more than 500, is a four-tier, red-brick
building featuring 6-foot by 8-foot cells and narrow hallways with
antique fixtures.
   With its narrow peep holes built into brick walls and a small,
dusty yard, it resembles lockups of 1940s gangster movies.
   A new jail is scheduled to be built in nearby Ludlow, but that
is at least two years away.
   Meanwhile, the 5-year-old, two-story armory seemed like a
solution, said Ashe, who has let 1,200 inmates go on early-release
programs since the federal cap took effect in the fall of 1988.
   The idea first came up last week when a Westfield district judge
detained two of Ashe's deputies, angry that they wouldn't take a
prisoner to the already full jail. The judge said Ashe had
responsibility for housing prisoners and should take whatever steps
necessary.
   Ashe, citing a 1648 law that he said gave him authority to take
necessary steps to preserve public safety, marched into the armory
on Friday and informed the National Guard he was taking over.
   He later installed 15 prisoners and guards were posted.
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis said Tuesday the armory takeover is not
a solution to the problem.
   ``The answer to this problem is (prison) expansion at Ludlow and
New Braintree,'' he said.

   Publishers, scholars and free-speech advocates
are bemoaning the Supreme Court's refusal to overturn a ruling that
drastically limits the right of authors to quote unpublished
material such as diaries and letters.
   The justices, without comment, refused Tuesday to hear an appeal
by a company that published a biography attacking the late L. Ron
Hubbard, founder of the Church of Scientology.
   That left intact a ruling last April by the 2nd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals that imposed strict limits on the use of
quotations from unpublished material.
   E. Gabriel Perle, a lawyer who represents the Association of
American Publishers, said the appeals court ruling could put a
permanent chill on the use of important source material by
biographers and historians.
   ``The 2nd Circuit decision is an inexplicable inhibition on
scholarly writing and publishing. It is a clearly a misapplication
of the law,'' Perle said. ``It makes it impossible for scholars to
use quotations without fear'' their works will be banned.
   But Michael Lee Hertzberg, a lawyer for the Scientologists,
minimized the importance of the appeals court ruling.
   ``There is, in effect, an important right in the creator of a
work to control the first dissemination of that work. The only
thing protected here is creative expression,'' he said.
   In a busy return from a four-week winter recess, the Supreme
Court also:
   _Ruled, 7-2, that parents suspected of child abuse sometimes may
be jailed indefinitely for refusing to disclose the whereabouts of
their children. The court permitted the indefinite jailing of a
Maryland woman for refusing to tell authorities the location of her
young son, who is feared dead.
   _Made it easier for disabled children to win some federal
welfare benefits. The 7-2 decision in a Pennsylvania case could
force the government to re-evaluate benefits for some 250,000
children.
   _Agreed to use an Ohio case to decide whether prosecutors who
exclude blacks as jurors because of their race violate the rights
of white defendants.
   _Left intact Baltimore, Md., ordinances requiring the city's
employee pension plans to divest themselves of all investments in
companies doing business with South Africa.
   In the Scientologists case, the 2nd Circuit court said federal
copyright law generally bars use of unpublished material without
permission. The appeals court rejected arguments that the ban
violates constitutionally protected free expression.
   The ruling relied, in part, on an earlier 2nd Circuit court
decision barring Random House from publishing a biography of author
J.D. Salinger unless quotations from, and paraphrases of,
Salinger's letters were deleted.
   Because of a technicality, the appeals court refused to block
further publication of the Hubbard biography, entitled ``Bare-Faced
Messiah.'' The appeals court said the copyright owners, who are
affiliated with the Scientologists, waited too long to seek a court
order blocking publication.
   Ironically, that made Henry Holt and Co., publisher of the
biography, the technical winner before the appeals court.
   It also may have contributed to the Supreme Court's refusal to
review the 2nd Circuit court ruling.
   In its appeal, Holt said the 2nd Circuit court ruling is a grave
threat to the publishing industry because the appeals court is
based in New York City, home to most of the nation's major book
publishers.
   Lawyers for Holt said the ruling means the copyright law that
was ``intended to promote the progress of the useful arts is now
repeatedly being used to muzzle responsible biographers and
historians.''
   Among the groups supporting the Holt appeal were the American
Historical Association and the Authors Guild.
   ``Bare-Faced Messiah,'' written by Russell Miller, accuses
Hubbard of fakery and deception. Holt said quoting from Hubbard's
unpublished letters and diaries was intended to expose the church
founder's lies.

<HEAD>Administration Looks at Slashing More Weapons Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, prompted by the
lessening Soviet threat to the West, is adding at least five major
weapons systems to its list of programs being studied for possible
cuts.
   Pressed by members of a Senate panel about scaling back
programs, Deputy Defense Secretary Donald J. Atwood said Tuesday
that the administration likely would review the two land-based
nuclear missiles and the SSN-21 Seawolf attack submarine.
   The Pentagon already is studying possible scaling back of plans
for the B-2 stealth bomber, the Advanced Tactical Fighter, the
Advanced Tactical Aircraft and the C-17 transport.
   Atwood told the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on defense
the review should be completed before midyear when the panel begins
crafting a defense spending bill for the fiscal year beginning Oct.
1.
   Atwood said among the additional candidates for review are the
already-deployed multiple-warhead MX missile, which the Pentagon
wants to base on rail cars, the planned single-warhead Midgetman
missile based on special trucks and the attack submarine.
   ``We do have these studies ongoing. They are looking at the best
assessments of the requirements based on our visualization of what
the defense needs will be and do they need them,'' Atwood said.
   Asked whether the SSN-21 submarine was under review, Atwood
said: ``We are considering ... picking up another five to seven
major programs, major issues, and this may well be one of them.''
He did not list all the programs he had in mind.
   Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, chairman of the panel, predicted
Congress will likely choose either the MX or Midgetman missiles
this fiscal year, instead of providing funds for both as it did in
past years.
   Inouye also warned that the administration's attempt to delay
$2.2 billion in Pentagon expenditures this year could prove costly
for the fiscal 1991 defense budget.
   Administrations routinely ask Congress to delay billions in
planned spending each year. By law, these requests _ called
deferrals _ are permissible because of unexpected contingencies or
a chance to save money through better management.
   The deferrals can be blocked by a majority vote of either house
of Congress.
   Policy considerations are not considered reasons for such delays
to be requested. Yet according to the documents Bush sent lawmakers
dated Feb. 6, the administration justifies many of the deferrals
with the statement, ``this proposal reflects changes in
requirements in view of promising developments in the Soviet Union
and Eastern Europe.''
   Inouye questioned Atwood on where the administration ``found
this authority to make such deferrals.''
   The deputy defense secretary said the deferrals ``all came about
as change in requirements.''
   But the committee chairman said he ``found the logic of changes
in requirements in view of the changes in the Soviet Union to be a
rather dangerous one that we also could use to do away with these
other programs _ SDI, B-2 and such.
   ``And I'm certain that many members of the Congress are looking
at this logic.''

<HEAD>Navy: Espionage Not Found in Trident Navy Base Shootings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM KLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy has found no evidence of espionage as a
factor in the fatal shootings of two sailors at a top-secret base,
the slaying of a pawnshop clerk and the apparent suicide of a third
sailor.
   But a lawyer for the third sailor's family, who raised the
possibility of spy involvement, said Tuesday that Naval
Investigative Service agents ``apparently are just not talking to
the right people.''
   The lawyer, Larry Scruggs Jr. of Milwaukee, also said in a
telephone interview he believed his safety and that of the sailor's
survivors had been jeopardized since he raised the espionage issue.
He refused to identify his sources on that question or disclose the
reasons for his safety concerns.
   Lt. Cmdr. Keith Arterburn at the Trident nuclear submarine base
at Bangor, about 20 miles west of Seattle, said Scruggs refused to
give Navy investigators his sources and never previously mentioned
any fears for his personal security.
   ``I've been, in my opinion, very cooperative with the Naval
Investigative Services investigators,'' Scruggs said. ``There are
some things I cannot disclose at this time because of concern for
my sources and my clients.''
   Relatives of 23-year-old Shyam David Drizpaul, whose body was
found Jan. 17 in a motel near Vancouver, Wash., said they hired
Scruggs because they did not believe the police and Navy accounts.
   Authorities believe that Drizpaul, a Guyana native who lived in
Milwaukee, killed David Allen Parker, 21, of San Diego, and Scott
Anthony Seely, 18, of North Ridgeville, Ohio, at the base on Jan.
16, and a few hours later fatally shot Julie Lynn Tuscher, 24, at
the Charleston Pawnshop in Bremerton.
   The clerk's brother, 28-year-old Allan Michaels, who was
critically wounded in the pawnshop shooting, identified Drizpaul as
the attacker and said he took a gun from the store that was found
with the body at the motel.
   The Navy believes Drizpaul committed suicide.
   Scruggs believes Drizpaul was killed.
   A Navy statement said 35 investigators had conducted more than
500 interviews, talking to some people more than once, and had only
a few people still to contact in the case.
   ``The investigation has not disclosed any indication of
espionage or espionage-related activity,'' the Navy statement said
Tuesday.
   ``That's pretty much settled,'' Arterburn said.
   Scruggs said Drizpaul apparently had a girlfriend identified to
the lawyer only as Cindy, who worked evenings, attended school by
day and may have obtained sensitive information on the Trident, a
key component of the nation's nuclear deterrent.
   Scruggs said the woman was mentioned by sources in Milwaukee and
the West Coast, including some ``who actually saw a photograph of
this individual.''
   Navy investigators have been unable to find anyone who said
Drizpaul had a girlfriend, nor has the name Cindy been mentioned in
interviews in connection with him, Seely or Parker, Arterburn said.
   He added that he had never heard before of any picture.
   A motel housekeeper, Marcy Plonski, initially told a reporter
she saw a woman's long evening jacket in the room where Drizpaul's
body was found, but Navy investigators found no sign of any
outerwear except ``a man's tan trenchcoat,'' the Navy statement
said.
   She also told a reporter she had seen a box of what appeared to
be business papers in the car Drizpaul drove to the motel. But
investigators said she told them she never saw such a box, the Navy
statement said.

<HEAD>New Study Finds Walls Of Jericho Did Tumble Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The walls of Jericho did come tumbling down as
recounted in the Bible, according to an archaeological study.
   ``When we compare the archaeological evidence at Jericho with
the biblical narrative describing the Israelite destruction of
Jericho, we find remarkable agreement,'' said archaeologist Byrant
G. Wood of the University of Toronto.
   After studying data from recently published excavation reports
of British archaeologist Kathleen Kenyon, Wood wrote in the
March-April issue of the scholarly journal, Biblical Archaeology
Review:
   ``Here is impressive evidence that the walls of Jericho did
indeed topple as the Bible records.''
   Ms. Kenyon had concluded after her excavations in the 1950s that
the fortified city was destroyed about 1550 B.C., and was no longer
there at the time of the Israelite invasion dated after 1400 B.C.
   As a result, for about 30 years, ``scholars by and large have
written off the biblical record as so much folklore and religious
rhetoric,'' Wood said.
   However, he said extensive ceramic remnants and a carbon-14
sample contradict Ms. Kenyon's dating of the city's fall, and other
evidence converged to support the biblical account.
   ``The correlation between the archaeological evidence and the
biblical narrative is substantial,'' he said.
   As described in Joshua 6, Joshua's army marched around the city
for a week, blowing rams' horns, and on the seventh day, combined
shouting with the piercing horns, ``and the wall fell down flat.''
   Wood noted that collapsed mud bricks were found outside a thick
lower revetment wall where they had fallen, and apparently served
as a ramp for the Israelites, described as going ``up'' into the
city.
   Also, the Bible relates the event occurred after spring harvest,
and that the Israelites burned the city _ both factors confirmed by
the archeological remains, Wood said.
   He said the siege of the city obviously was short as indicated
by the large amounts of scorched grain found.
   ``The presence of these grain stores in the destroyed city is
entirely consistent with the biblical account,'' Wood wrote. ``The
city did not fall as a result of a starvation siege, as was so
common in ancient times.
   ``Instead, the Bible tells us Jericho was destroyed after but
seven days.''
   Wood noted that Jericho is situated in the Rift Valley, an
unstable region where earthquakes are frequent, and he suggested a
quake could have caused both the tumbling wall and also temporary
blocking of the Jordan river.
   That is described in Joshua 3:16, allowing the Israelites to
cross on land.
   ``Historians and Bible scholars have focused on the `miraculous'
nature of the event, with little regard for the seismology of the
southern Jordan valley.''
   He said that mudslides caused by quakes have blocked the Jordan
``a number of times in recent recorded history. ... So the stoppage
of the Jordan's flow as described in the Bible is not so
far-fetched as it might at first seem.''

   PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) The Rev. James I. McCord, an
internationally known Presbyterian leader in the ecumenical
movement and longtime president of Princeton Theological Seminary,
has died at the age of 70.
   The cause of death was not immediately available. He died Sunday.
   He was president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches from
1977 to l982. His diplomatic intiatives contributed to unions of
Reformed and Congregational churches in many countries.
   A native Texan, McCord was president and professor of theology
at Princeton Theological Seminary from 1959 until his retirement in
1983. That year he became chancellor of Princeton's Center for
Theological Inquiry, which he had founded.
   He retired from that post last year.
   A graduate of the University of Texas, McCord got his divinity
degree from Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary and served
churches in Austin, Texas, and Manchester, N.H., before becoming
dean of the Austin seminary in 1952.
   He later became head of the Princeton seminary, one of the
oldest and most prestigious theological training institutions in
the country.

<HEAD>No Coca-Eating Caterpillars Without Invitation From Host Country</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration insists that ``neither
troops nor caterpillars'' will be dispatched to fight the cocaine
wars in South America without an invitation from the host country.
   The pledge came in reference to an Agriculture Department
program that is researching development of voracious caterpillars
to kill off coca plants.
   The department, in a research program that President Bush
proposes to increase by $5 million to $6.5 million in fiscal 1991,
is looking at a white moth that, when in its caterpillar stage,
eats coca plant leaves.
   ``We are not undertaking any biological war,'' said White House
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater. ``Neither troops nor caterpillars
will go in without prior request and consultation.''
   On a related topic, he said U.S. officials had known there was a
possibility that drug terrorists had surface-to-air missiles when
Bush flew to Colombia for last week's four-nation drug summit, but
that the reports were never confirmed.
   Ten such weapons were seized by Colombian police on Monday.
   ``There was intelligence before we left of various kinds about
missiles and rockets and other kinds of equipment, about people
with various plans,'' Fitzwater said.
   The summit was attended by the presidents of Peru, Colombia and
Bolivia, the three leading cocaine-producing countries.
   The unleashing of a defoliation caterpillar in those countries
would open a new era in coca eradication efforts.
   But Fitzwater and Don Hamilton, a spokesman for national drug
control policy director William Bennett, emphasized that the insect
research program is in the experimental stage.
   Hamilton said the proposal is to look ``at all drug plants to
try and learn as much as we can about them, including herbicides
and natural enemies of the plants. This isn't something that is an
option yet. It's a prospect of an option.''
   A Peruvian embassy spokesman said that after The Washington Post
ran a story on the caterpillar program Tuesday, U.S. officials
assured the ambassador that no such program would be initiated in
Peru without Lima's approval.
   A Bolivian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
his country's environmental concerns have prompted it to reject the
use of chemical agents against coca crops, and likely would also
reject biological agents.
   Some environmental activists also were wary about the idea.
   Coca growing and processing already are ``extremely
destructive'' to the environment because of the insecticides and
the harsh chemicals employed, said Sandra Marquardt, pesticide
information coordinator for Greenpeace U.S.A.
   But instead of the caterpillars producing ``a nice biological
control, you'll have growers adding ever more insecticides to an
already destructive production program,'' she said.
   Eric Christensen, a Natural Resources Defense Council attorney,
said he is ``extremely dubious that such a program could be
launched without producing potentially major environmental
consequences, either from spreading an exotic pest that could have
far-reaching consequences, or from producing a major increase in
pesticide usage.''

   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange plunged
amid fears of rising interest rates Wednesday, with the main market
index dropping more than 3 percent in the third largest single-day
dive in history.
   The U.S. dollar, meanwhile, firmed against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the most
widely-followed index, lost 1,161.19 points, or 3.15 percent, to
close at 35,734.33. On Tuesday it shed 327.08 points.
   It was the third largest single-day decline for the Nikkei index
and its sharpest since Oct. 23, 1987, when the benchmark index lost
1,203.23 points in the aftermath of the around-the-world stock
market crash known as Black Monday.
   Analysts attributed the plunge to a combination of negative
factors, particularly fears of rising interest rates, which also
depressed bond prices, and the poor showing of New York and London
markets overnight.
   Despite the sharp decline, some analysts and dealers said
investors remained calm, coolly watching the falling share prices
from the sidelines.
   ``There have been hardly any buying incentives in the stock
market since the beginning of the year,'' said Keiichi Nishida, a
dealer with the Kidder Peabody Securities. ``The 3-percent decline
today may look a lot, but at least I can say it was not the result
of investor's panic-selling.''
   In the currency market, the dollar closed at 145.15 yen, up 0.57
yen from Tuesday's close of 144.58 yen. After opening at 145.55
yen, the currency moved in a range of 145.10-145.60 yen.
   Currency dealers attributed the dollar's strength to
expectations that U.S. interest rates won't decline soon.
   Alan Greenspan, chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, said
in a U.S. congressional hearing Tuesday that economic growth was
likely to pick up, indicating the Fed will not relax monetary
policy any time soon.
   ``The speculation that Japan's central bank might raise its
discount rate has been making market players nervous,'' said a
dealer at Daiichi Kangyo Bank, who asked that his name be withheld.
   The discount rate, which Japan's central bank charges on its
loans to commercial banks, currently stands at 4.25 percent. Many
market participants have speculated that the Bank of Japan might
raise the country's key interest rate now that the parliamentary
elections are over.

<HEAD>Ag Department Sees Little Impact From Canada Trade Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The year-old Free Trade Agreement between the
United States and Canada is having little national impact on
farmers, according to an Agriculture Department report.
   One reason is that the U.S.-Canada agreement was negotiated at
the same time agriculture had the international spotlight in the
Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, said
Alan Webb of the department's Economic Research Service.
   The U.S.-Canada pact went into effect Jan. 1, 1989 and was
designed to remove all tariff and some non-tariff barriers to
agricultural trade between the two countries within 10 years.
   ``The GATT talks probably caused both countries to restrain the
scope of their bilateral agricultural negotiations,'' Webb said in
the February issue of Farmline magazine. ``Neither side wanted to
make major concessions that would have reduced their bargaining
chips in the larger multilateral GATT talks.''
   But the looming presence of GATT did help spur some progress on
agriculture in the U.S-Canada agreement, largely because it would
have appeared as bad form not to have some favorable results.
   ``For two relatively friendly, open countries to admit defeat on
negotiating something on agriculture would have sent a bad signal
to the international community, particularly since both countries
maintain that the real culprits in international agricultural trade
are the European Community and Japan,'' Webb said.
   Canada and the United States have similarities in agricultural
production and trade, meaning there are few reasons to negotiate
changes or opportunities for tradeoffs. Also, he said, agricultural
trade with the United States _ and the free-trade agreement _ are
far more important to Canada than the other way around.
   Webb said the U.S. view was that the small size of the Canadian
market did not justify large concessions.
   ``The United States would not make major changes in its domestic
agricultural policies, particularly those which would affect
head-to-head competition with Canada in other export markets, on
the basis of Canadian concessions on agriculture,'' he said.
   But Webb said that in the larger, multilateral talks of the
Uruguay Round, significant changes in domestic policies are more
likely.

   An Agriculture Department report shows 1990
farm income estimates are holding as predicted, although there is
some slippage from the record level of two years ago.
   Net cash income may be in the range of $52 billion to $57
billion, compared with an estimated $53 billion in 1989 and the
record of $57.2 billion in 1988, the report said Tuesday.
   That is the money left over after deducting cash expenses from
gross cash income during a calendar year. It can include proceeds
from sales of inventory commodities produced in previous years.
   Net farm income, another method of bookkeeping, may be in the
range of $44 billion to $49 billion this year, compared with $48
billion in 1989 and $42.7 billion in 1988.
   This method measures income from farming during a specific year,
including changes in the value of inventories, allowances for
family dwellings, depreciation and other factors.
   Figures for both accounting methods were unchanged from
projections made by the department's Economic Research Service the
last two months.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter noted in testimony before
the House Agriculture Committee earlier Tuesday, ``virtually all
indicators of farm sector well-being have improved'' the last few
years.
   ``Farm income is up, farm failures are down, farmland values are
recovering and debt-to-asset ratios have improved,'' Yeutter said.
``Commodity surpluses have all but disappeared, some idle land has
returned to production, and farm program spending is down.''
   The agency report said farmland values have been revised, based
on the 1987 census of agriculture. The average U.S. price of
farmland as of February 1989, for example, was revised upward to
$667 per acre from the earlier estimate of $597. No state figures
were included.

<TEXT>
   The top candidate for the presidency of
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology pulled out of
consideration, saying he'd rather continue his teaching and
scientific research.
   ``I know that the presidency of MIT is an office of
extraordinary importance, challenge and opportunity _ but in the
end, I discovered that it is not me,'' said professor Phillip A.
Sharp in a statement released Tuesday.
   ``As I anticipated dissolving my research program and teaching
duties, I came reluctantly to the realization that I could not fill
that void in my life with anything else,'' said Sharp, the John D.
MacArthur professor of biology, who directs the MIT Center for
Cancer Research.
   An MIT executive committee nominated Sharp last week after more
than 200 candidates were considered for the position, a spokesman
said.
   ``The committee has accepted this decision with great regret,''
said Paul E. Gray, the current president. Gray was scheduled to
leave July 1 to become chairman of the MIT Corporation, but may
stay longer, said school spokesman Kenneth D. Campbell.
   Sharp had undergone several interviews during the committee's
search to replace Gray, who is leaving after 10 years at the
university's helm.
   ``I apologize for my indecisiveness and for not more fully
understanding this personal need,'' he said. Sharp declined to
answer any questions about his decision.
   The MIT Corporation was due to vote on Sharp's nomination at its
March 2 meeting. Following his withdrawal, however, the corporation
would not consider any nominations at that meeting, Campbell said.

   The Red Cross' decision against spending
most of the $52.5 million in earthquake relief donations on other
disasters won praise from community leaders as necessary to prevent
a breach of faith with the public.
   ``When people indicate they want their money spent in a certain
way, I think their desires should be acknowledged,'' Oakland Mayor
Lionel Wilson said.
   In a reversal, the Red Cross promised Tuesday to spend the
entire $52.5 million for earthquake relief in Northern California.
The move followed criticism from San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos and
others over its plans to put at least $30.4 million of the money in
an account administered by its Washington, D.C., office for other
disasters.
   ``We needed to take some action to re-establish good faith with
our donors, to keep the trust and confidence with them,'' said
Barbara Lohman, a spokesman for the American Red Cross regional
office in Burlingame.
   The 109-year-old, nonprofit international relief organization
has spent $12.1 million on emergency relief for the 100-mile
stretch of Northern California devastated by the 7.1-magnitude
quake on Oct. 17.
   The agency had promised to spend only another $10 million on
long-term rebuilding programs, contending there had not been a
demonstrated need for using the rest of the money here.
   Oakland and Alameda County officials are seeking $18.7 million
from the agency for housing and other assistance programs for
earthquake victims.
   Agnos had sought at least $10 million from the Red Cross, much
of it to meet the needs of homeless people.
   Agnos had chided the Red Cross for considering taking that money
out of Northern California, which sustained $7 billion to $10
billion in damage from the largest quake here since the 1906 Great
Earthquake.
   ``There's a lot of unmet needs here,'' he said.
   The $12 million already spent by the Red Cross has supplied
food, clothing, emergency rents and medical aid, Lohman said.
   Several million dollars worth of other supplies also have been
provided by the Red Cross and will have to be paid for from the
relief fund, Lohman said.
   Following the quake, the Red Cross set up 45 shelters, helping
more than 14,000 families and providing 500,000 meals. The Red
Cross still operates two shelters, one each in Oakland and San
Francisco that serve a total of about 400 people.
   The decision not to transfer earthquake funds out of the region
was made over the weekend after discussions between George F.
Moody, national chairman of the Red Cross, and the agency's
executive committee of its Board of Governors, a volunteer group
that oversees Red Cross operations.
   Lohman said the Red Cross does not have a policy requiring it to
use all donations designated for a specific disaster in those
programs.
   The extra $30 million will be used to fund proposals already
submitted by officials of the quake-stricken areas, including the
cities of San Francisco, Santa Cruz, Watsonville and Oakland.
   The allocations will be announced in mid-March.

   The search for fake grill marks on hot
dogs has spawned a promising by-product that advertisers may
relish: frank ads.
   A peek between the buns could reveal ``Hebrew National,'' ``Go
Dodgers'' or some other promotional message tattooed on the
frankfurter, if Viskase Corp.'s idea takes hold.
   Viskase, one of the world's biggest producers of hot dog
holders, has developed the E-Z Mark Nojax cellulose casing. The
company says it allows a hot dog maker to transfer a message
printed in a ``USDA-approved food-grade ingredient'' from the
casing to the meat.
   Viskase spokesman Doug Morris says the company steamed up the
idea of making the hot dog an edible billboard while trying to
figure out how to put fake grill marks on franks to make them look
barbecued.
   Morris predicted that the printed dogs could begin turning up at
special events and promotions within two months.
   But John Trosper of ARA Leisure Services Inc., concessions
manager at Anaheim Stadium, said he's not sure the idea would work
at the ballpark's high-volume refreshment stands.
   ``Our hot dogs are already cooked and in a bun and wrapped when
they're sold,'' he said. ``You wouldn't see (the message). And by
the time you unwrap it, where is it? It could be face down.''

   The unofficial mascot of Phillips University
_ P.U. for short _ wandered through an open door and caused quite a
stink.
   A wayward skunk sprayed the floors of Marshall Hall on Tuesday
as animal control workers hustled it outside.
   ``You try to keep them as calm as possible,'' said David
Handley, manager of the Enid animal shelter. ``If you get them by
the tail, they won't spray. This one we got around the mid-section
and he let go. I kept him pointed at the floor.''
   The skunk, whose fragrance sometimes arouses a response similar
to the university's initials, was adopted by students more than 40
years ago as the school symbol.

<HEAD>Gov't to Sell Public Telephone Company To Raise Money For
Education</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANA HAYWARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon says
the U.S. commonwealth's public telephone company will be sold to
private investors and the proceeds used to improve education and
public services.
   ``This means there won't be one school in Puerto Rico that is
not painted, repaired,'' the governor said in his ``State of the
Commonwealth'' address Tuesday. ``That no school lacks desks,
blackboards, chalk. That no child lacks books or the necessary
supplies for an education.''
   Colon said the Puerto Rico Telephone Co. ``is the only company
which has enough value'' to generate the money needed to revamp
Puerto Rico's school system and the Caribbean island's
infrastructure.
   He said he would sell it for ``no less than $2 billion.''
   It was not immediately known if there is a buyer for the
telephone company.
   Hernandez Colon was in New York City in January and met with the
billonaire financier Donald Trump. The governor refused to provide
details but said then they discussed ways to invest in education
reform plans.
   At the time, Hernandez Colon said Trump ``was interested.''
   The governor said without elaboration that Telefonica Espanola,
the Spanish telephone company, ``is one of the enterprises that
could be interested'' in the long-distance service.
   Hernandez Colon said he wanted to create two ``perpetual funds''
from the telephone company sale: a $1 billion fund for education
and a $1 billion fund to modernize the island's highways, public
housing, airports, waste dumps and energy operations.
   The government would use interest from those funds for the
improvements, the governor said.
   Hernandez Colon said the government bought the telephone company
during his 1974 administration for $165 million when it ``was in
total abandonment'' and had only 300,000 telephone lines.
   He said the company, which made $70 million in net income last
year, now accounts for 1 million telephones in the Spanish-speaking
U.S. commonwealth of 3.3 million people. Hernandez Colon said that
in private hands, the telephone company can make at least $170
million a year.
   ``Technologically, Puerto Rico Telephone is among the most
advanced in the world,'' he said.
   The company's Puerto Rico Long Distance subsidiary has an
estimated $200 million long-distance market.
   Hernandez Colon said he will introduce legislation stipulating
none of the telephone company's nearly 8,000 jobs would be affected
by the sale and that there be no rate increases for three years
after it is bought.
   The governor has long said educational reform _ revamping
schools, classrooms and textbooks and providing salary increases
for teachers _ was a priority of his administration. He repeated
his pledge when he was re-elected in November 1988.

   President Bush's free trade approach to
Western Europe's drive towards a one-market economy by 1992 is
drawing fresh criticism in Congress as American companies relocate
plants and jobs across the Atlantic to avoid being frozen out.
   Officials in the State and Commerce Departments and the U.S.
Trade Representative's Office were barraged Tuesday with harsh
attacks by both Democrats and members of the president's own party.
   ``Let's be honest, our trade policy is to have no policy,'' said
conservative Rep. Toby Roth, R-Wis., who complained Bush ``is still
living in the 1950s and '60s'' with his free-trade beliefs.
   ``We're in a real economic battle ... and you say `free trade'
and nothing happens,'' Roth said during a hearing before the House
Foreign Affairs trade subcommittee. ``That's the problem.''
   The officials acknowledged they were unsuccessful in stopping
the 12-member European Community from adopting restrictions on
broadcasting last October that would allow member countries to keep
U.S. television shows and movies off their airwaves.
   ``But we have not left the playing field on that one, let me
assure you,'' said Peter Allgeier, the assistant U.S. trade
representative for Europe.
   Subcommittee Chairman Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., complained the
administration hasn't even put a full team on the field yet, citing
unfilled posts that Congress created last year to monitor the EC
'92 negotiations taking place in Brussels.
   ``Our single biggest trading partner is changing all the rules
of the game,'' he said, while the administration is treating the
issue as ``something we can get around to in the lazy, hazy days of
summer. It just boggles the mind.''
   Gejdenson cited recent decisions by General Electric Co. and
United Technologies Corp. to move some of their jet engine
facilities from the United States to Europe.
   He said several semiconductor manufacturers have reversed their
initial plans to build new plants here and instead are going to put
them in Europe in order to assure access to the market there after
1992.
   ``This isn't a simply a debate between liberalization and
protectionism,'' Gejdenson asserted. ``Companies in this country
have decided that you're not going to get the job done, so they're
moving their investments to Europe.''
   Administration officials acknowledged their prediction a year
ago that the EC '92 process would move slowly has been overtaken by
the overthrow of communist governments in Eastern Europe and the
crumbling of the Berlin Wall.
   Assistant Secretary of State Eugene McAllister said moves this
month to reunify East and West Germany ``could very well help speed
up'' the adoption of a single-market economy for all of Western
Europe.
   ``Many of the EC nations are intent upon keeping Germany western
oriented and they see EC '92 as a very important contributing
factor to that,'' he said. ``(French) President (Francois)
Mitterrand has stated that in very blunt terms.''
   Gejdenson complained Bush continues to shun threats of
retaliation while EC members draft protectionist directives against
imports of U.S. agriculture and big-ticket items such as
telecommunications and electrical equipment.
   He cited memorandums of understanding assuring Italy and the
Netherlands continued wide access to Pentagon procurement contracts
regardless of the trade talks.
   ``The one thing we have in our cards is access to American
defense procurement,'' he said. ``Did any of you guys ever play
poker? You have to have chips, you need cards in your hand. What
are you threatening the Europeans with? That you'll go home empty?''
   Allgeier called defense procurement a ``very sensitive issue''
within the administration but pledged, ``We will use whatever
leverage we can.''

<TEXT>
   Union leaders accused the Bush
administration of favoring Eastern Airlines in its bitter 11-month
dispute with machinists, but administration officials said the
president has remained neutral.
   AFL-CIO leaders, gathered at their annual winter meeting,
charged Tuesday that the federal government has a $120 million
contract with Eastern.
   Lane Kirkland, head of the 14.1-million member federation,
suggested that President Bush had been influenced by lobbyists for
Texas Air Corp., Eastern's parent.
   ``They're not collecting fees for nothing,'' he said.
   In a letter sent to Bush Tuesday, George Kourpias, president of
the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers,
said the contract ``is not the impartial act of an even-handed
federal executive. It is the biased antagonism of an underhanded
administration.''
   But U.S. Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole told reporters there was
no favoritism toward Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo.
   She said Lorenzo's labor practices ``leave a lot to be
desired,'' and promised to look into the alleged contract for
federal travel services.
   At the White House after labor leaders met with Mrs. Dole in
Florida, deputy press secretary Stephen Hart said, ``the Labor
Department assures us that there is no such contract.''
   An administration official speaking on the condition of
anonymity said the issue involves General Services Administration
guidelines on preferred city-to-city airline rates for couriers.
   The machinists' union calculated what the maximum benefit in
income to Eastern might be from these guidelines, and came up with
the $120 million figure, the official said.
   Eastern filed for bankruptcy reorganization law five days after
the machinists union walked out in March 1989, and the carrier has
hired replacement workers as it attempts to reduce its size.
Eastern faced a midnight Tuesday deadline for submitting a
reorganization plan to a federal bankruptcy judge.

<HEAD>Senate Debates `Armenian Genocide' Resolution</HEAD>

   The Senate is embroiled in debate over the
``Armenian genocide'' that is pitting GOP members against the Bush
administration and threatening to poison relations with Turkey.
   Led by Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole, R-Kan., supporters of
the controversial resolution say the measure is an effort to
remember the 1.5 million Armenians who were killed in 1915-1923
during the Ottoman Empire because of their ethnic background. The
Ottoman Empire is now Turkey.
   Opponents of the measure said it could sour U.S. relations with
Turkey, a NATO ally, and threaten the future of military bases in
the Moslem country.
   The Senate was expected to continue debate today, with a cloture
vote scheduled on Thursday to cut off debate. Sixty senators must
approve that motion before a vote on the measure can be taken.
   ``It is time for the Senate, the Congress, the United States
government _ it is time, finally, for all of us to do what is
right,'' said Dole. ``It's time for the United States, officially,
to commemorate the Armenian genocide.''
   Dole sponsored the resolution to make April 24 a national day of
remembrance of the anniversary of the ``Armenian genocide,
1915-1923.''
   Turkey is fiercely opposed to the measure and has objected to
the term ``genocide.'' Prime Minister Turgut Ozal has said the
measure has united all Turks.
   ``I am deeply concerned that if the Senate passes the
resolution, it will unwittingly slap the face of a very important
NATO ally,'' said Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., an opponent.
   Byrd was the only senator to speak against the measure Tuesday.
Others supporting it included Sens. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.,
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Pete
Wilson, R-Calif., a gubernatorial candidate in a state with a large
Armenian-American population.
   Much of the debate centered Tuesday over the term ``genocide,''
which Byrd said may not apply to the massacre of Armenians under
the strict definition of the Geneva Convention.
   Although the Bush administration opposes the resolution, the
measure is a potential source of embarrassment for President Bush,
who said during the 1988 campaign that he would be inclined to
support it.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., quoted Bush as saying during 1988 that
the United States ``must acknowledge the attempted genocide'' of
the Armenians. ``I would join Congress in commemorating the victims
of that period,'' Simon quoted Bush as saying.
   ``Clearly a different signal is coming from the White House
today,'' he said.
   Dole's spokesman, Walt Riker, said the senator and White House
officials had tried unsuccessfully to arrive at compromise language
on the resolution. Dole has rejected any effort to water down the
language, but said he might offer amendments that contain ``less
offensive'' words when the measure reaches the Senate floor.
   Dole complained about the ``massive lobbying effort'' to block
the measure, which was passed last year by the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
   He said the resolution had 61 co-sponsors last year, but today
has only 46 co-sponsors.
   ``What has changed is the launching of a massive lobbying effort
against the resolution _ by the administration, by the government
of Turkey, by American businesses who operate in Turkey and _
regrettably _ by some private organizations and individuals who
ought to be supportive of the resolution,'' he said.
   Last year, Dole wrote to the Israeli ambassador asking if Israel
had asked some Jewish groups to work against the measure, according
to Riker. Turkey is a Moslem country that has relations with Israel.
   Meantime, Turkey has already taken steps to show its displeasure
at the resolution. The country has banned ports of call by U.S.
nuclear-powered warships and barred flights by training missions
into a gunnery range, according to Mike McNamara, who represents
Turkey.

   The maiden voyage of Czechoslovakia's new
reformist government to the United States was a symbolic
full-circle return to values long cherished by Czechs and Slovaks,
but also an exciting personal experience for members of the
delegation.
   When President Vaclav Havel shook President Bush's hand inside
the White House, it was a beginning of a new era, a strong reminder
of 1918 when Woodrow Wilson played a key role in establishing free
Czechoslovakia, and an overwhelming victory for Havel, a former
dissident playwright.
   Havel, the first president in Czechoslovak history to visit
Washington with full honors of a head of state, still remembers the
first time 22 years ago when he visited the United States as a
promising writer and human rights activist.
   ``The difference is not that I am the president now, but rather
that we did not have freedom and now we do,'' Havel said on
NBC-TV's ``Today'' show on Tuesday.
   His countrymen have always looked up to American ideals of
democratic freedom and private enterprise, but often history took
them in a different direction.
   The Munich Pact stripped Czechoslovakia of meaningful defense
against Hitler in 1938, communists took over with Soviet support 10
years later, and Warsaw Pact tanks crushed Alexander Dubcek's
``Prague Spring'' in 1968.
   But in the tradition of his absurdist plays, it took Havel no
more than 41 days to lead his country from the spiritual depression
caused by four decades of communist rule to national euphoria
during his inauguration on Dec. 29.
   ``For some time I knew things had to change, but nobody was more
surprised when they did,'' Havel told about 500 students at the
Gaston Hall of Georgetown University on Tuesday.
   The presidential Ilyushin plane also carried a 7O-member
delegation of government officials, Havel's former
comrades-in-arms, fellow artists and friends.
   Many had never before visited the United States, while others
had to wait many years to return.
   Jiri Dienstbier once was sentenced by communists to four years
in jail and a menial job of a furnace stoker, only to come back as
Czechoslovak foreign minister to Washington where he worked as
Prague Radio correspondent in 1968.
   He still loves New York as the second best town in the world _
next to Prague _ and clearly enjoys the frantic schedule of a
highly popular foreign minister who visited more than 10 countries
in January alone.
   ``In two months more has happened in Czechoslovak diplomatic
life than in the last 10 years before that,'' Rozarka Hunatova,
Dienstbier's adviser, said at a party given Tuesday night by the
Czechoslovak embassy in Havel's honor.
   ``We have not seen anything like this as far as I can
remember,'' said Karel Huska, a senior Czechoslovak diplomat
serving his third year in Washington. More than 800 people thronged
the once-placid embassy, where an adjacent tent was built to
accommodate the guests.
   ``How do you like America?'' a reporter asked Olga Havlova, the
president's wife, who shook hands with teary-eyed countrymen who
came to see their hero.
   ``It's okay,'' she replied, while the president joined in the
chorus of the Czech version of ``On Top of Old Smokey,'' rendered
by Waldemar Matuska, an exiled Czech singer now living in Florida.
   Vaclav Klaus, the multilingual finance minister who spent 20
years in the obscurity of a bank clerk, asked a reporter, ``The
Village Voice? You mean the Village still exists? I remember it 20
years ago.''
   The mood was relaxed, in spite of another 16-hour working day
for the Czechoslovak delegation, frequent flights, countless
meetings and ceremonial receptions.
   ``We started out with having to sit through one of his (Havel's)
plays in a Reykjavik theatre for over two hours and listening to
the whole thing in Icelandic, but from then on it was just great,''
a delegation member quipped.
   During six hectic days of his tour, Havel visited Iceland and
Canada, met with Bush on Tuesday, addresses a joint meeting of
Congress today and attends a star-studded concert in his honor in
New York on Thursday.
   ``The trip will undoubtedly produce a better understanding of
economic and political relations between the two countries,'' Vice
Premier Vladimir Dlouhy said.
   ``What I like best are the motorcades,'' added his assistant.
``But somebody should find our luggage which got lost on its way to
the Blair House.''

<HEAD>Congressmen Predict Upset Chamorro Victory in Nicaragua</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three House members just back from Nicaragua
are predicting a stunning upset victory for opposition candidate
Violeta Chamorro over leftist President Daniel Ortega in Sunday's
national elections.
   ``If I were a betting man, I'd go with the longshot. I think
she's going to upset him,'' said Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., who
made the trip with Reps. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., and Doug Bosco,
D-Calif.
   ``I think she's got the votes,'' Ackerman said, basing his
prediction on the responses of crowds at UNO rallies last week in
the area around the capital of Managua and on conversations with
citizens who appear confident of the election's integrity.
   Ackerman said he went to Nicaragua sharing the widely held view
that Mrs. Chamorro's campaign has been so weak and that Ortega's
ruling leftist Sandinista party holds such a grip on the country
that the election was no contest.
   ``I came away with a different perspective,'' he said in an
interview.
   An ABC-Washington Post poll released Tuesday indicated that
Ortega held a 16 percentage point lead over Mrs. Chamorro, 48
percent to 32 percent.
   The ABC-Washington Post poll was based on interviews with 925
likely Nicaraguan voters on Feb. 11-15. The margin of error was
plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
   Polls have generally put the Sandinistas ahead. However, experts
caution that polling in less developed countries such as Nicaragua
is, at best, a tricky business.
   Ackerman said the group was impressed by the vigorous campaign
being waged by both the Sandinistas and the 14-party opposition
coalition known as UNO.
   ``There's a real, genuine, knockdown, drag-out, hometown
campaign going on,'' he said.
   The Sandinistas have erected billboards showing Ortega holding a
child and promising a better future for the country. Ackerman also
said the Sandinistas are using telemarketing to make calls that
feature a recorded message from ``your president.''
   ``One lady said she was called four times,'' Ackerman said.
   While Mrs. Chamorro's side has few of those political trappings,
she draws large, enthusiastic crowds at rallies, he said. The head
of the country's Roman Catholic Church, Cardinal Miguel Obando y
Bravo, has done everything but make an outright endorsement of UNO,
Ackerman said.
   But most telling, he said, was that voters questioned by the
congressmen consistently told them, ``My vote is secret,'' an
indication of faith in the voting process that bodes ill for Ortega.
   ``People remember they were hungry yesterday, and that their
kids couldn't go to school. ... They really have little hope except
in overturning things,'' Ackerman said.
   With the country's economy in a shambles after a decade of civil
war, ``you don't want to validate the past, you want a change,'' he
said.

   The State Department says it is not
threatening Cuba when it says it ``simply cannot tolerate'' such
developments as Cuba's receipt of a new shipment of
high-performance Soviet fighter planes.
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler confirmed Tuesday that
Cuba has received a delivery of new MiG-29 jet fighters. Although
Ms. Tutwiler gave no figure, The Washington Times reported in
Tuesday's editions that six were received.
   Ms. Tutwiler quoted Baker as saying, ``Cuba is actively
supporting the insurgency in El Salvador and it is these kind of
activities close to the shores of the United States that we simply
cannot tolerate.'' However, she said the statement intended no
threat to Cuba.
   Ms. Tutwiler referred reporters to Secretary of State James A.
Baker III's recent testimony before a Soviet legislative committee
in which he said Cuba posed no threat to the United States.
   The report said the combined total of MiGs in Cuba's arsenal has
risen to more than 300, most of them older models.
   Ms. Tutwiler noted Baker had told the Soviet legislators during
a visit to Moscow earlier this month that the United States has
difficulty understanding why the Kremlin continues to send MiG-29s
to Cuba, particularly at a time when Cuba has been so critical of
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform policies.

<HEAD>Bush Cites Faster Lifting of U.S.-Canada Tariffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush has notified Congress that the
governments of the United States and Canada have reached agreement
on the quick lifting of tariffs on some 400 products worth $6
billion in trade.
   For the products covered, the agreement announced Tuesday speeds
up the timetable for lifting duties under the landmark U.S.-Canada
free-trade agreement that took effect Jan. 1, 1989. That pact calls
for phasing out all tariffs by 1999.
   U.S. products on which duties will be eliminated at once under
the speeded-up agreement include chemicals, pharmaceutical
products, photographic film, telecommunications equipment, electric
motors and generators, hydraulic pumps, printed circuits and
scientific instruments.
   Canadian products that will benefit include diesel engines,
chemical plastics, machinery, textiles and certain food products.
   Two-way trade in goods and services between the United States
and Canada is roughly $200 billion. About 70 percent is currently
duty free.
   However, many products _ notably Canadian steel, lumber, paper
and other forest products _ remain under tariffs that are being
phased out under terms of the original free-trade agreement and
were not affected by Tuesday's action.

   Former members of the Panamanian Defense
Forces are among 15 people in custody in Panama in connection with
the murders of an American citizen and a U.S. Embassy employee, the
FBI says.
   Those in custody include both potential witnesses and ``possible
participants'' in the killings of Raymond Dragseth, an American
living in Panama City and Fernando E. Brathwaite, a U.S. Embassy
employee, FBI officials said Tuesday.
   Panamanian authorities are expected to bring formal charges in
the near future, according to the FBI.
   The bodies of both men were found Dec. 21, the day after U.S.
troops invaded Panama.
   The FBI said its investigation determined that members of the
PDF abducted Dragseth from his house at gunpoint on Dec. 20.
Brathwaite was abducted later in the day.
   Both men were taken outside the city and shot to death, the FBI
said.
   The former PDF members in custody were members of a special
anti-terrorism unit of the Panamanian military under the government
of deposed leader Manuel Antonio Noriega, said a law enforcement
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The investigation was conducted by the FBI along with the
Panamanian Technical Judicial Police and the U.S. Embassy.

<HEAD>Critics See Flaws in Social Security Toll-Free Phone Network</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Social Security's toll-free telephone network
is coming under fire from members of Congress who say the new
national phone system has depersonalized service and too often
offers busy signals and wrong answers to frustrated callers.
   ``When our nation's government starts throwing machines where
experienced people belong, service becomes disservice,'' Sen. David
Pryor, D-Ark., said in testimony prepared for a hearing today of
the House Ways and Means subcommittee on Social Security.
   Pryor, who chairs the Special Senate Committee on Aging,
complained of ``excessive busy signals and wrong or incomplete
answers'' when people call the Social Security phone network. The
senator said he would introduce legislation today requiring Social
Security to offer direct telephone access to its field offices and
to make use of the 800-line service optional.
   ``There can be little doubt that the 800 line has seriously
eroded the quality of the agency's service to the public,'' he said.
   The telephone network _ reached by dialing 1-800-2345-SSA _ is
staffed from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. across the country, and allows
callers to take care of many matters without going into a Social
Security office. In many cities, the toll-free number is the only
Social Security number listed in the phone book.
   But congressional critics complain people often are unable to
get through on the toll-free lines and that many don't get full and
accurate information when they do get through.
   Congressional caseworkers report people are frustrated when they
get connected to someone at a distant location who doesn't
understand local problems, and because they usually can't talk to
the same person if they call back.
   On Tuesday, Social Security Commissioner Gwendolyn King defended
the telephone network as a ``success story'' but acknowledged that
callers too often get busy signals.
   The telephone network, which went nationwide last October, was
expected to handle about 250,000 calls a day, but more than 1.5
million people try to get through on peak days, and many of them
call between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., she said.
   ``The 800-number is the biggest success story we've had,'' Mrs.
King said at a press briefing. ``We just have too a big a success
on our hands. ... the trick is how to manage it so that it works
better.''
   Mrs. King said the agency is preparing television and newspaper
public service announcements that encourage people to ``have
breakfast with Social Security'' by calling between 7 a.m. and 9
a.m. when the phone lines are less busy.
   Mrs. King said a new study by the Inspector General's Office of
the Department of Health and Human Services found that 67 percent
of those who used the toll-free line said they would use the
telephone again to do business with Social Security, up from 53
percent in 1984.
   Eighty-two percent of those who used the 800 number reported the
service was good or very good, she said.
   ``What we are finding is that when people do get through, they
find the service is courteous, they're very happy with the
information they received,'' she said.
   In January, traditionally a busy month for the agency, an
estimated 52 percent of calls to Social Security's 800 number were
met with busy signals, compared with 14 percent in December, 51
percent in November and 30 percent in October, Mrs. King said. Her
goal is to reduce the busy rate on peak days to 35 percent by the
end of the year.
   ``The busy rates are a lot higher than we or anyone would like
to have them on those peak days,'' she said.

<HEAD>Experts Say Asbestos Risk Still a Concern</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Recent articles in science journals that
claim asbestos is not as dangerous as once believed should be met
with skepticism by the public, a group of scientists said.
   Articles in the past year in such publications as The New
England Journal of Medicine and Science magazine and a Harvard
University symposium played down the risks associated with
asbestos, panelists at the National Asbestos Conference said
Tuesday.
   Warren Friedman, who coordinates the asbestos program at the
U.S. General Services Administration, said there is ample evidence
from recent studies that indicate asbestos exposure does pose
health risks, particularly long-term exposure. More studies are
needed, he said.
   ``You increase the duration of exposure, you're going to
increase the risk,'' he said.
   Asbestos was used for years in buildings as a fire retardant and
an insulator. But research in the 1960s found that inhaling
asbestos fibers increases the risk of developing lung cancer.
   The fallout from that research helped create a $51 billion
``asbestos abatement'' industry to remove asbestos from schools and
other buildings, and to monitor its presence elsewhere.
   ``At the very least, it's not yet time to say all is well,''
said Dale Keyes, a physicist with Environmental Sciences of Phoenix.
   Richard Kronenberg, a researcher with the University of Texas
Health Science Center at Tyler, noted that the asbestos articles
published the past year in scientific magazines were written by
reputable researchers, but he said any conclusions are still
``uncertain.''
   Current federal regulations do not require asbestos removal and
most contractors do not routinely expose workers or the public to
health hazards, Kronenberg said.
   ``By and large it's a very tightly regulated, excellent
industry,'' he said.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Announce Offensive Against U.S. Interests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pro-Cuban guerrilla group holding two
Americans captive says it will attack U.S. interests in Colombia
and if the United States intervenes, ``there will be an uprising
like in Vietnam and El Salvador.''
   The National Liberation Army declared ``Death to gringos.''
   President Virgilio Barco called an urgent meeting of the
National Security Council.
   Earlier Tuesday, at Barco's urging, a federal court pardoned 35
members of another guerrilla group _ the April 19 Movement _ who
were accused of taking part in the 1985 takeover of the Palace of
Justice that claimed the lives of 95 people, including 11 Supreme
Court justices.
   The National Liberation Army is one of six guerrilla groups in
Colombia and is under the command of Manuel Perez, a former Roman
Catholic priest.
   It sent a letter to the families of two Americans kidnapped last
week by its guerrillas in the northwestern city of Medellin,
according to Colombian news reports.
   The Medellin daily El Colombiano published the letter Tuesday.
   The letter was directed to the families of James Donnelly, a
65-year-old mechanical engineer from Detroit, and David Kent, a
40-year-old schoolteacher from Indianapolis.
   The guerrilla group said it abducted the two men Feb. 13 to
protest President Bush's visit to the port city of Cartagena
Thursday to attend an anti-drug summit.
   ``We are inclined to give a lesson in respect to the government
of the United States, and if it intervenes in Colombia there will
be an uprising like in Vietnam and El Salvador,'' the letter said.
   ``Our position will change only when North America suspends its
ways of intervening and of military aggression in Latin America.''
   News accounts read on the radio identified some of the U.S.
targets cited as Occidental Petroleum, Texaco and other U.S. oil
companies and enterprises.
   The Defense Ministry estimates the group has about 2,000 of the
10,000 guerrillas figured to be operating in Colombia.
   The National Liberation Army blew up an electrical tower shortly
before midnight Monday and blacked out most of Cartagena, the city
of 530,000 where Bush met with Presidents Barco, Alan Garcia of
Peru and Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia.
   Insurgents then attacked a police station and five neighborhood
police command posts, wounding five policemen, a national police
communique said.
   Also Monday, the guerrilla group set fire to equipment at a
government oil drilling camp and fought two battles with police.
One police officer and two guerrillas were killed and one policeman
wounded.
   A police communique also said Fabio Gomez, mayor of Almaguer in
southwest Cauca state, and Colombian anthropologist Jesus Bolivar
were kidnapped Saturday in Almaguer.
   In the last 18 months the National Liberation Army has kidnapped
16 mayors. The guerrillas have been releasing the mayors after
warning them to spend more money on projects for poor people.
   The guerrilla group late Monday freed an American priest,
Francis Amico Ferrari, 43, of Rochester, N.Y., who was kidnapped
Thurday from his parish in the slums of the western city of Cali.
   The pardons given to guerrillas on Tuesday are part of an
attempt by the Barco government to end three decades of rebel
violence in which more than 75,000 people have been killed.
   In all, five guerrilla groups have told the Barco government
they are interested in peace talks.
   In another development, Gen. Miguel Maza, chief of Colombia's
secret police, said 10 shoulder-fired, surface-to-air missiles
seized Monday from drug traffickers were to have been used to
attack the Bogota international airport and other major government
installations.
   A major drug cartel is based in Medellin.
   It has waged war against the government the last six months
because of the Barco administration's anti-drug crackdown, which
includes extraditing suspected drug traffickers to face charges in
the United States.

   The walls of 92-year-old Luella Wilson's
home are covered with the treasures of a lifetime.
   Trophies from the hunting expeditions of her younger years _
moose and coyotes _ hang on the walls, and her rooms are cluttered
with sentimental bric-a-brac.
   Now, for the first time in three years, Wilson is safe in the
knowledge that her home and 80-acre property will be hers for the
rest of her life. She agreed to a court settlement that lets her
keep both.
   Seated at the kitchen table Tuesday afternoon, surrounded by
family and friends and sipping a celebratory shot of whiskey,
Wilson looked markedly healthier and happier than she had just
hours earlier seated in a wheelchair at the start of the liability
trial.
   The settlement, reached during the noon hour on the first day of
the trial, in effect overturns a jury verdict in 1987 that Wilson
had to give up her home and life savings, valued at $950,000.
   ``Certainly I am (relieved),'' said Wilson. ``I don't feel so
damn good. I can't walk. But I did win.''
   The 1987 jury had found her liable for severe injuries suffered
by Mark Vince, who had been riding in a car driven by Wilson's
great nephew in a 1984 accident.
   Wilson had loaned her great nephew, Willard Stuart, the money to
buy the car and jurors felt she should have known Stuart lacked a
driver's license.
   Wilson learned of the settlement at home in a telephone call
from her lawyer. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed. Wilson
said she thought her insurance company, Vermont Mutual, was picking
up her share of the settlement tab.
   But an attorney for Vermont Mutual, Richard Bowen, denied that
scenario. Bowen, who attended the Tuesday trial, said the company
and Wilson had settled a separate suit, but he would not disclose
the terms of that settlement.
   In opening arguments Tuesday morning, Wilson's attorney
Frederick Harlow told jurors Vince, not Wilson, must bear the blame
for the fact he is mostly paralyzed and has lost a leg.
   ``Mr. Vince knew the designated driver was drinking beers,
having some marijuana. Mr. Vince knew that,'' Harlow told jurors.
   On Monday Wilson rejected settlement offers that she leave her
home and assets to Vince upon her death. ``My husband Harry would
roll over in his grave if I ever did that,'' she said.
   She said Tuesday that she would not have to leave the farm to
Vince after her death under the approved settlement.
   Rolf Sternberg, one of Vince's lawyers, had argued that Wilson,
the car dealership and the car salesman were negligent in loaning
Stuart money and selling him a car knowing he did not have a
license and was not competent to drive.
   ``Mrs. Wilson had no reason to consider her nephew an unsafe
driver, someone she should not lend money to,'' Harlow countered.
   Stuart said he had lived with Wilson for a short time and had
served as her driver during that time, even though he didn't have a
license.
   Shortly after he bought the car in 1984, Stuart drove it off a
bridge after drinking beer and Black Velvet whiskey and smoking
marijuana, with a group of young men, including Vince, according to
court records. Vince, a back-seat passenger, was partially
paralyzed as a result of the accident, according to records. He
later had one leg amputated.

   Mobs angered by a public
transportation strike looted a dozen grocery stores and burned a
truck, a TV news program reported. Rock-throwing students battled
police in Caracas.
   At least 50 people were reported arrested.
   The disturbances Tuesday in seven cities were among the worst
since February 1989, when 300 people were killed and more than
1,000 injured in widespread rioting over an increase in bus fares.
   In the cities of Barcelona and Puerto La Cruz, both about 120
miles east of Caracas, at least 12 grocery stores where sacked
before police fired tear gas to disperse the mobs, Radio Caracas
Television said.
   No casualties were reported during the violence but at least 30
people were arrested in both cities, the TV reported.
   At least 20 students were arrested after a two-hour battle with
police in a square outside Venezuelan Central University in
Caracas, witnesses said.
   The students threw rocks and set a truck on fire, students said.
   Minor disturbances broke out in Merida, Cumana, San Cristobal,
Barquisimeto and Maracaibo, police sources said.
   Many of the protesters were students angered by the strike and
by the refusal of some bus lines whose to grant student discounts.
The strike left most cities with only partial public transportation.
   The strike was called by unions protesting delays by the
government in paying subsidies that allow discounts of up to 50
percent over regular rates for students.
   Increases of 30 percent to 50 percent in public transport
tariffs and price gouging by bus drivers set off the rioting in
February 1989 _ the worst violence in Venezuela in 31 years.
   The nation of 18 million had been regarded as an island of
tranquility in a region of increasing violence and political and
economic instability.
   The price increases were part of a government austerity program
intended to halt the downward economic spiral that has gripped
Venezuela since the collapse of oil prices in the early 1980s.
   The Caracas-based Latin American Institute for Social research
surveyed 2.3 million families in 1981 and classified 22.5 percent
of them as poor. In 1987, it surveyed 3.1 million families and
categorized 54 percent of them as poor.

   Actor Kevin Costner says the Man of the
Year honor from Harvard University's Hasty Pudding Theatricals is
one of his first awards, and he treats it ``with more reverence
that you might think.''
   Costner, who has starred in such films as ``Bull Durham,'' ``No
Way Out,'' ``The Untouchables,'' and ``Field of Dreams,'' received
the traditional Hasty Pudding pot from the undergraduate theatrical
group Tuesday, then fell right in with the college hi-jinks.
   ``My father was terribly concerned that this kind of thing would
happen as a result of acting,'' Costner quipped after donning a
red-sequinned bra with a baseball motif over his tuxedo. He
accepted kisses from men in drag before a whooping crowd of 300.
   The theatrical group said some of Costner's lesser known roles
caught its attention.
   ``What first attracted our eye was the soul-searching in such
films as ``Night Shift'' and ``Sizzle Beach U.S.A.,'' joked Sharon
Owyang, a junior and one of the show's producers.
   Costner, who lives with his wife and three children in La
Canada, Calif., is the 24th recipient of the annual Hasty Pudding
pot, joining the ranks of such alumni as Paul Newman, Johnny
Carson, Robert Redford and Bill Cosby.
   Actress Glenn Close was named the club's Woman of the Year last
week, an honor that Kathleen Turner received in 1989.
   Costner, 34, began his career as a janitor, sweeping stages
until he gradually began working with film crews and taking acting
lessons at night. He got a big break when his wrists and hair
appeared in the early 1980s hit movie ``The Big Chill,'' in which
he played a dead man whose suicide brings together a group of old
college friends.
   Most of that appearance ended up on the cutting room floor, but
the film's director cast him in another role and his star has been
rising ever since.

<HEAD>Main Stock Exchange Takes Biggest Single-Day Dive Since '87 Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index fell more than
3 percent today in its third biggest single-day dive ever and worst
since the worldwide stock market crash in October 1987.
   Traders blamed heavy computer-guided selling by foreign
brokerage firms for the decline and said there was no panic-selling.
   Amid concerns about possible interest rate increases, the index
already had fallen a total of nearly 565 points on the previous two
trading days.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the most widely
followed index on the exchange, fell 1,161.19 points, or 3.15
percent, closing at 35,734.33.
   It was the index's sharpest decline since a plunge of 1,203.23
on Oct. 23, 1987, following a round-the-world stock market crash.
The largest single-day plunge in Tokyo was 3,836.48 points on Oct.
20, 1987.
   The dollar meanwhile rose moderately against the yen.
   Analysts and dealers said today's abrupt drop was largely due to
waves of computer-guided selling by foreign brokerages in the last
half-hour of trading. The computers figure out when to buy or to
sell to profit from price differences between shares changing hands
immediately and those promised for delivery in the future.
   With most investors on the sidelines, the analysts said, a lack
of buy orders allowed the index to fall sharply. They said market
sentiment was not necessarily as pessimistic as the plunge
indicated.
   ``The market has been very quiet since the beginning of the
year, and it was even quieter today,'' said Keiichi Nishida of
Kidder Peabody Securities. ``Then came a large volume of
index-linked program selling by foreign brokerage houses. It is no
wonder the index droped so sharply. At least, I can say today's
sharp decline was not a result of panic-selling.''
   Volume traded on the first section of the exchange, where most
major shares are listed, was estimated at 430 million shares, up
slightly from Tuesday's 335 million shares.
   Analysts also attributed the market's weakness to widening
speculation that the Bank of Japan would raise its official
discount rate, the interest it charges for loans to commercial
banks. Higher interest rates tend to dampen stock investment.
   ``There is general agreement in the market that the official
discount rate is going to be raised, but because of upcoming
overseas travels by Bank of Japan Gov. (Yasushi) Mieno, the timing
of the increase is unclear,'' said Michio Katsumata of Nomura
Securities Co. ``So participants are worrying about when it will be
raised and by how much.''
   Robert Alan Feldman of Salomon Brothers added: ``It appears the
institutions have finally woken up to the fact that interest rates
are up and will continue to be up.''
   A Bank of Japan spokesman said there is no change in the central
bank's stance that it will continue to study the impact of
spiraling long- and short-term interest rates that have resulted
from the December base rate increase.
   The discount rate now stands at 4.25 percent after three
increases last year. Many market participants had speculated the
Bank of Japan might raise it after Sunday's parliamentary election.
   In the currency market, the dollar closed at 145.15 yen, up 0.57
yen from Tuesday's close of 144.58 yen. After opening at 145.55
yen, it ranged between 145.10 yen and 145.60 yen.
   Currency dealers attributed the dollar's strength to prevailing
expectations in the market that U.S. interest rates would remain at
their current high level.
   Alan Greenspan, chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, said
in a U.S. congressional hearing Tuesday that the Fed would not
relax monetary policy any time soon.
   A dealer at the Bank of Tokyo, speaking on condition of
anonymity, added that Japan's weak bond market also contributed to
weakening the yen.

that for you, you're going to feel strongly about it.''
   Nicknamed ``Pappy,'' he was the oldest member of the PT-109 crew
because he enlisted in the Navy at age 37. Though exempt because of
his age, McMahon was determined to serve when his stepson, then 19,
enlisted in the Navy one day after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor.
   ``He felt, `If my son is in there, I couldn't face him after the
war if I was sitting around the house having a beer,'' said Kelly,
68, a submariner aboard the USS Greenling during World War II.
   The Wyanet, Ill., native was assigned to PT-109 as a Machinist's
Mate 1st Class. He served under Kennedy, then a 26-year-old
lieutenant junior grade and skipper of the patrol-torpedo craft.
   Over the years, McMahon often told the story of the night of
Aug. 2, 1943, when the crew was patrolling Blackett Strait in the
Solomon Islands. A Japanese destroyer burst out of the darkness and
smashed through their boat, slicing it in two and instantly killing
two of the 13 crewmen.
   McMahon suffered burns on his face, chest, arms and legs and
couldn't swim because of the pain, Kelly said, so Kennedy put him
across his back and kept him there by clenching McMahon's
life-jacket strap in his teeth.
   Other crew members clung to a plank from the sunken boat until
the exhausted survivors reached Plum Pudding Island four hours
later.
   ``Dad was burnt so bad,'' Kelly said. ``He thought he was
holding (Kennedy) up so he asked the president, `Just leave me.
I'll be all right by myself.' But of course, he would not think of
it.''
   Finding little food and no drinking water on the island, the
group left four days later for Olasana Island, requiring another
swim of several hours. Kennedy again towed McMahon.
   A few days later, with the help of island natives, American
forces rescued the PT-109 survivors.
   McMahon recovered from his burns and was discharged from the
Navy in November 1945.
   After the war, McMahon went to work for the U.S. Post Office. He
started as as a letter carrier, and eventually became postmaster in
Cathedral City near Palm Springs.
   McMahon moved to Encinitas after his 1975 retirement. He and
Kennedy stayed in touch after the war and through Kennedy's
presidency, Kelly said.
   ``I remember a couple of times when he was president and came
out to Palm Springs, the Secret Service would call dad, and they
would sit in the limo and talk for a few minutes,'' he said. ``The
president would always ask him if there was anything he could do
for him and my dad always said, `Mr. President, you've done enough
for me. You saved my life.'''
   McMahon also is survived by his wife of 62 years, Rose; a
daughter-in-law, Merlene Kelly, and four grandsons.

move. Picks up 3rd pvs, `Irish Foreign...'</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   In the first major dent in international
sanctions against South Africa, Britain has defied the rest of the
European Community and will unilaterally lift a ban on new
investment.
   Britain's move Tuesday, following its failure to persuade other
members of the 12-nation community to follow suit, underlined its
reputation as a reluctant member of the European Community.
   The African National Congress today accused Britain of breaking
its word on economic sanctions and said the action was part of a
pattern by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of favoring South
Africa's white minority government.
   ``She has been quite prepared to be out of step with the rest of
the world in her anxiety to accommodate the Pretoria regime,''
Pallo Jordan, the ANC's information chief, said at the guerrilla
group's headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia.
   Irish Foreign Minister Gerry Collins accused Britain of setting
a ``dangerous precedent'' and added: ``I would appeal to everyone
here not to embark on such a course.''
   In contrast to the fallout over South Africa, the community's
foreign ministers displayed marked unanimity over the upheavals in
Eastern Europe, declaring that the Western trade bloc sees itself
as a ``mooring for a future European equilibrium.''
   They urged that the officials of 35-nation Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe begin meeting by no later than
July to set up an East-West summit later this year.
   Assurances by Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West
Germany that a united Germany would not seek to dominate Europe and
would respect existing frontiers appeared to soothe even the most
wary, including Britain.
   ``It was the most open discussion we have had among the twelve
on German unification,'' said British Foreign Secretary Douglas
Hurd.
   Genscher, however, left open the question of Polish demands for
a treaty to enshrine Polish territory, one-third of which was part
of Germany before World War II. He said the issue could be
considered in six-power talks among the two Germanies and the World
War II allied powers, the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain
and France, and in the Conference on Security and Cooperation.
   On South Africa, only Portugal supported Britain's in arguing
that an easing of sanctions was warranted by the lifting of some
restrictions by South African President F.W. de Klerk this month
and the Feb. 11 release of black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela.
   ``It is not enough to sit back and say, `that's encouraging,
let's see what you do next','' said Hurd.
   Collins said the community view was that the reforms ``while
welcome ... do not yet go far enough ... Perhaps there is agreement
that we could look at our policy again when the state of emergency
is lifted and all political prisoners are released.''
   The community agreed to send a fact-finding mission to South
Africa comprised of representatives from France, Ireland and Italy.
Hurd said the move would be interpreted as a ``signal of the Twelve
delaying rather than encouraging.''
   The new investment ban was one of a series of non-binding
measures the community agreed to in 1986.
   Britain has long opposed sanctions and now argues that its
policy of seeking to encourage South Africa's white-led government
to move way from apartheid has helped push de Klerk into reform.
   Most other countries say he has moved because of the pressure of
sanctions and resistance by the black majority, which is denied a
vote in national affairs by apatheid.
   Mrs. Thatcher is already under attack for what critics say is
compromising British influence internationally by being out of step
on South Africa and being hesitant about German unification.
   Hurd indicated Tuesday that President Bush supports the British
view that de Klerk deserves a response from the international
community.
   Hurd said Bush wrote to Mrs. Thatcher on Tuesday and said he is
prevented by Congress from lifting U.S. sanctions.
   ``He went on to say the steps we are taking are positive and
added that he feels very strongly that when someone does what you
are asking you should recognize that fact,'' said Hurd.
   Britain is the largest single foreign investor in South Africa,
although several major British corporations and the London-based
Barclays Bank pulled out because of pressure from anti-apartheid
groups.
   South Africa's biggest foreign trading partners are four
European Community nations _ Britian, West Germany, Italy and
France _ and the United States and Japan.

   Men worry less than women about what they eat
and how it affects their physiques, a national poll suggests.
   Fewer than three in 10 men responding to a Gallup survey said
they feel guilty about eating foods they like; more than four in 10
women reported such feelings.
   The poll, released Tuesday, also found men were less worried
about chowing down and less conscious of dietary concerns.
   Fifty-seven percent of men said they were eating more fiber;
among women, that rose to 70 percent. Fewer than four in 10 men
sought more calcium; six in ten women did.
   Overall, 52 percent of the respondents said they were eating
more oat bran, which has been touted recently as an aid in lowering
blood cholesterol. Again, considerably fewer men than women said
they had made the change.
   The survey found fats and oils scarcer at everybody's table:
Nearly three-quarters said they were trimming fat from their diets
and roughly two-thirds reported cutting out saturated fats,
cholesterol and fried foods.
   But in spite of all this action against fat, only 56 percent of
respondents admitted worrying about it.
   More than nine in 10 people of both sexes said they enjoy food,
and nearly six in 10 said they enjoy it a lot.
   The Gallup Organization conducted the telephone survey of 772
American adults Dec. 11-28 for the American Dietetic Association, a
dieticians' group, and the food industry-funded International Food
Information Council. The poll had a margin of error of plus or
minus 4 percentage points.

   Nelson Mandela has attempted
to calm fears among business leaders with an assurance the African
National Congress would not impose drastic economic changes if it
takes control, a newspaper said today.
   Mandela was quoted as saying the ANC would consult business
before making any major changes in the economy. Business leaders
have been frightened by recent Mandela statements backing the ANC's
plan to nationalize the economy.
   ``This is an extremely important matter, and in any democratic
situation a free expression of opinion is absolutely vital. I also
expect compromise from both sides,'' Mandela was quoted as saying
by Business Day.
   A lawmaker of the liberal Democratic Party said today that the
ANC and the governing National Party were moving too slowly and
must accelerate efforts to bring about black-white dialogue on
ending apartheid.
   Tony Leon of the white opposition party said the ANC's decision
not to hold a congress on formulating policy until December was a
mistake. He told a meeting in Durban that the ANC and the
government had to move more quickly.
   ``Whether or not the ANC or the government anticipates events
achieving their own head of steam is almost irrelevant to the fact
that the country, and its people, are hardly likely to stand still
while the various parties get their act together,'' he said.
   President F.W. de Klerk released Mandela on Feb. 11 after
legalizing the ANC and other anti-apartheid groups. De Klerk says
he wants negotiations on ending white-minority rule and extending
political power to blacks.
   The ANC's exiled leadership in Zambia responded Friday to de
Klerk's initiative by announcing it would send delegates to meet
with the president to try and clear the way for constitutional
negotiations.
   The ANC wants release of all political prisoners and an end to
the state of emergency before taking part in formal talks. De Klerk
has said that political prisoners convicted of violent crimes
cannot be released.
   On Tuesday, Britain defied the rest of the European Community
and said it will unilaterally lift a ban on new investment to South
Africa in recognition of de Klerk's latest moves.
   Mandela, in the Business Day interview, said the ANC did not
want to take any major action on the economy without consulting
business leaders.
   ``We are very keen not to do anything without proper discusssion
with those interested and involved,'' he said.
   Mandela had expressed support for ANC plans for nationalization
of mines and other key sectors of the economy. The statements, made
after his release following 27 years in prison for taking up arms
to fight white-minority rule, caused widespread fear in the
white-dominated economy.
   Mandela, 71, also said other nations must continue sanctions
against South Africa to force the end of apartheid. ``What we set
out to achieve, we are far from achieving and there is nothing that
has happened that has required us to review this decision.''

<HEAD>New Bishop Says Cuomo Has `Problem' on Abortion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new bishop of the nation's fifth largest
diocese said he would bar Gov. Mario Cuomo from speaking in
parishes because of the governor's support for legalized abortion.
   Bishop Thomas V. Daily, who will be installed April 18 as the
spiritual leader of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, said
Tuesday that he rejects Cuomo's argument that a Catholic elected
official can personally be opposed to abortion, but support laws or
policies such as Medicaid funding of abortions for poor women.
   ``If anyone supports, either directly or indirectly, the
practice of killing babies in the womb, that is terrible,'' Daily
said.
   ``As a Catholic, he's got a problem,'' Daily said of the
governor, a New York City resident who has been a member of the
Brooklyn diocese all his life.
   A spokesman for the governor, Gary Fryer, said Cuomo would not
respond directly to Daily's comments until meeting him, but he
offered his congratulations.
   Daily, 62, who spent the last 5{ years as the head of the
Diocese of Palm Beach, Fla., succeeds Francis J. Mugavero, who has
reached the church's mandatory retirement age of 75.
   There are more than 1.5 million Catholics in the Brooklyn
diocese, fifth largest of 185 Catholic dioceses and archdioceses in
the United States. Pope Paul VI named Mugavero to head the diocese
in 1968.
   Daily also said there was ``no way'' he would allow Dignity, a
group of dissident Catholic homosexuals, to use diocesan churches,
as they had for a time under Bishop Mugavero.
   The bishop said he supports Courage, a group of Catholic
homosexuals who advocate chastity.
   ``Chaste,'' the new bishop said. ``That's a word we've got to
bring back into the vocabulary.''

   More rain fell in the soggy Southeast while clear, milder
weather in the Midwest and Northeast today preceded weekend
predictions of arctic chill.
   A cold front today brought flurries to the Northern Plains. Snow
continued in southern Colorado and northern Arizona. The Cascade
Mountains looked for accumulations of up to 10 inches by today.
   High winds lingered in the Front Range of the Rockies and in
Montana's upper Yellowstone Valley. Winds gusted to near 65 mph at
Cut Bank on Tuesday.
   The storm system that dumped snow in the West moved eastward
today, changing from mostly snow to rain along a warm front from
central Texas to southern Arkansas to Florida's Atlantic coast.
   In the Northeast and Midwest this weekend, an arctic wind is
expected to whip through both regions.
   Rain in the Tennessee and lower Mississippi valleys so far this
month is two to three times above normal _ and more precipitation
was forecast by tonight.
   The National Weather Service office in Mobile, Ala., predicted 5
to 8 inches of rainfall by Thursday. Meteorologist Jim Hyder said
the Tombigbee, Alabama and Mobile rivers are due for crests well
above flood stage this week and next.
   Snowfall diminished across western Kansas, although driving
conditions remained hazardous today. Tuesday's snowfall included 11
inches at Liberal, 10 at Tribune and in Lamar County; and 9 at
Elkhart and Garden City.
   By late Tuesday, a foot of snow blanketed Guymon, Okla.; Boise
City, Okla.; and Clayton, N.M. Ten inches fell on Las Vegas, N.M.,
and Spearman, Texas.
   International Falls, Minn., warmed to 48 degrees on Tuesday,
breaking the previous high by 5 degrees.
   Four Florida communities tied Tuesday for hottest spot in the
nation with readings of 86 degrees: Fort Myers, Lakeland, North
Dade County and West Palm Beach.

   Foreign currency dealers today said they were
surprised when the dollar fell in early European trading, after
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's suggestion that the Fed
won't lower interest rates further.
   Gold prices rose.
   The West German mark strengthened against the dollar and the yen
after weak stock markets in New York and Tokyo undermined
confidence in those currencies, dealers said.
   ``It is mostly a technical movement. Fundamentally there is no
special reason to be short on dollars at the moment,'' said
Jens-Uwe Fischer, senior trader at Manufacturers Hanover Trust in
Frankfurt.
   Paul Brewer, a senior dealer at Salomon Brothers International
in London, said: ``The trend still seems to be one of weakness
despite Greenspan's comments, which should have lent some support
to the dollar.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.57 yen to a closing 145.15 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 145.25 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.6653 West German marks, down from 1.6748
   _1.4744 Swiss francs, down from 1.4865
   _5.6595 French francs, down from 5.6875
   _1.8783 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8845
   _1,235.50 Italian lire, down from 1,243
   _1.1995 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2014
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.7143, compared with $1.7040 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $421.40 a troy ounce, up
from $419.75 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $420.60.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $421, up from $419.75 late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.18 to close at a bid $419.68.
   Silver was unchanged in London at a bid price of $5.35 an ounce.

   A suburban Maryland teen-ager who was the
object of a nationwide search for a bone marrow donor has died of
leukemia.
   JoAnne Johnson, 19, died Monday evening at her home in Silver
Spring, he family announced Tuesday. She had been undergoing
treatment at Georgetown University Hospital, but doctors had told
the family they had done all they could.
   Ms. Johnson was visited by the Rev. Jesse Jackson and singer
Dionne Warwick during her hospitalization.
   Ms. Johnson's parents, Howard and Sylvia Johnson, said they made
the decision last Friday to bring her home to die.
   The young woman's only chance for survival lay in a bone marrow
transplant, and no donor could be found in her immediate family.
Her parents over the last six weeks had organized a grassroots
campaign in an effort to find a matching bone marrow for their
daughter.
   They knew finding a donor of Ms. Johnson's ethnic background was
their best hope, but black Americans made up only a small fraction
of people listed in national bone marrow registries.
   The Johnsons set up mass screening drives with the help of
dozens of volunteers who worked out of their kitchen, and were able
to triple the number of blacks registered.
   A near-perfect match was found for Ms. Johnson last week, but by
then she was too weak to endure the procedure, said her aunt,
Henrice Taylor.

   Miles of scenic Southern California beaches
fouled by 400,000 gallons of crude oil, 7.6 million gallons of
sewage and untold amounts of filthy urban street runoff have been
reopened.
   A new stretch of Orange County shoreline tarred by an oil slick
was reopened to public use Tuesday, as were most of 18 miles of
beach fronting Santa Monica Bay closed after the storm-related
sewage spill.
   ``If I was a fish, I'd swim south for the rest of this winter,''
said Tim Little of Heal the Bay, an environmental group.
   A team of government surveyors, meanwhile, charted the mooring
area about 2 miles off Huntington Beach where the tanker American
Trader tanker spilled 400,000 gallons of oil Feb. 7.
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the federal
agency that draws underwater maps, was using sonar to examine the
approach to the area and the submerged pipeline that had been near
the ship.
   A 1{-mile stretch of oiled beach were reopened Tuesday. It was
part of more than a dozen miles of golden sand closed by the spill.
On Monday, 2 miles of affected beach were reopened.
   Off Santa Monica Bay to the north, nearly all of the 18 miles of
beaches closed by a 7.6-million gallon spill of partially treated
sewage over the weekend were reopened after tests found bacteria
levels within acceptable levels.
   The treated sewage was released from the Hyperion plant into
Ballona Creek because heavy rains could have caused backups and
sent sewage flowing onto city streets. The creek empties into Santa
Monica Bay.
   The weekend storm, which dumped 2.51 inches of rain on the Los
Angeles Civic Center, also washed pollutants from streets,
driveways and sidewalks into the ocean.

<HEAD>Coast Guard: Four Die In Escape</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMORADA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four Cubans seeking to escape their
homeland on rafts died in attempted crossings, while five other
refugees survived the dangerous trip across the Florida Straits,
the Coast Guard said.
   Two men died at sea and their bodies were thrown overboard by
their companions, a third disappeared overnight and the fourth was
dead by the time he reached a Florida Keys hospital.
   The Cubans, the latest of dozens this year who have tried the
journey of more than 100 miles, were in two groups sighted on rafts
Tuesday, officials said.
   The survivors brought to 66 the number of Cubans who have
successfully made the voyage since Jan. 1. The deaths were the
first known fatalities this year.
   Last year, 391 Cubans made it safely across the Florida Straits.
   ``It's a hazardous trip, very dangerous,'' Coast Guard spokesman
Luis Diaz said. ``At this time of year, the waters are much colder,
and exposure has to be a factor.''
   In the homemade rafts usually used, the journey can take several
days.
   Two Cubans were taken off a 6-foot-by-3-foot raft, made of
styrofoam pitched with tar, about 11 miles east of this Florida
Key, Diaz said.
   One, a teen-age boy, was dead on arrival at Mariners Hospital
while the other man was in serious condition, Diaz said. He
reported that a third passenger was lost at sea overnight.
   A second group of four Cubans was picked up 28 miles east of
here, hanging onto an inner tube, Diaz said. They told the Coast
Guard that two companions died on the voyage and their bodies were
thrown overboard.
   Newly arriving Cubans say the island's economy and repression
are worsening and that many more Cubans would leave if they could
do so safely. Some 125,000 Cubans came to the United States in 1980
when the Cuban government temporarily opened the Port of Mariel to
boats coming from Florida.
   On Monday, the motor vessel Pacific Prosperity rescued seven
Cuban men from a sinking innertube raft 25 miles south of Key West,
the Coast Guard said.
   Those Cubans, who ranged in age from 18 years to 27, all arrived
in good health, the Coast Guard said.

<HEAD>Steep Fall in Tokyo Putting Pressure on London Market</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with later market trading</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   London shares fell sharply in nervous but light
trading today, pressured by a sharp fall earlier in Tokyo.
   The already faltering London market couldn't buck the Tokyo
decline, which came on fears of a rise in interest rates, and
worries about the bond markets, market watchers said.
   Volume was ``pretty feeble,'' said Jeffrey Thompson, chief
equity strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd.
   ``We just haven't got the volume to resist'' nervous selling on
the back of Tokyo's losses, said Chris Stallard, a director of
Panmure Gordon Ltd.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was 16.1
points, or 0.7 percent, lower at 2,260.9 at 10 a.m.
   It opened 25.2 points lower an hour earlier.
   The Nikkei index tumbled 1,161.19 to 35,734.33 in Tokyo earlier
today. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 38.74 points to
2,596.84 on Tuesday.
   ``The equities are following the bond markets downward,''
Thompson said.
   He cited worries about inflation, uncertainty about German
unification, and concerns about corporate profitability.
   As bond prices fall, their yields, or their rates of interest,
rise.
   In addition, with Sunday's Japanese general election now out of
the way, many analysts are convinced it is only a matter of time
before the country's central bank raises its discount rate.
   Recent rises in West Germany's money market rates also have
increased investors' fears that West Germany's central bank might
raise its key interest rates soon.
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony before
Congress on Tuesday also suggested that the Fed wasn't likely to
lower interest rates.
   London's 100-share index will continue downward, through a key
2,250 support level, analysts predicted.
   ``My judgment would be that it (2,250) is not going to be strong
enough this time,'' said Randall Goldsmith, an equities analyst
with James Capel and Co.
   Goldsmith said he expected the Financial Times index to
eventually find support somewhere above 2,200.
   The early trend followed sharp losses in New York on Tuesday,
where the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 38.74 to 2,596.84, and
even steeper losses in Tokyo overnight, where the Nikkei index
tumbled 1,161.19 _ or 3.5 percent _ to 35,734.33.

<HEAD>Amnesty International Accuses Vietnam of Human Rights Violations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Amnesty International said today that
Communist Vietnam is still convicting people in unfair trials,
cutting food rations for some prisoners and putting some in
solitary confinement or shackles.
   The London-based human rights group said Vietnam has undertaken
major human rights reforms since pragmatists took over the
Communist Party leadership in December 1986 but many of the
measures have not yet been implemented.
   New legislation provides for development of an independent
judiciary and contains such principles as the presumption of
innocence, the right not to be detained without a court order, the
right to legal defense and to choose an independent lawyer, said
the report, released today.
   ``However, many of the reforms intended to protect specific
human rights have not been implemented and human rights violations
continue,'' it said.
   Many Western governments and human rights groups have accused
Hanoi of widespread human rights violations since North Vietnamese
forces defeated the U.S.-backed South Vietnam government in April
1975.
   The government told an Amnesty delegation that visited Vietnam
last May that it was committed to ``renovation'' in all fields and
stressed the importance of the rule of law, the report said.
   A copy of the report, ``Vietnam: Renovation (Doi Moi), the Law
and Human Rights in the 1980s,'' was received in Bangkok. Doi Moi
is the Vietnamese term for renovation.
   The 66-page study said reports of abuses of detainees ``suggest
that these practices are still common and that measures to combat
them are not yet adequate.''
   ``Abusive treatment in re-education camps includes the use of
solitary confinment in combination with beatings, the use of
shackles or leg irons and the reduction of food rations,'' it said.
   The report welcomed the release of thousands of people under
government amnesties in 1987 and 1988, including more than 1,500
political prisoners detained without charge or trial in
``re-education'' camps since the end of the war.
   It said Hanoi has told Amnesty it soon will free the remaining
130 former South Vietnam government and military personnel arrested
just after the war.
   But it added that Hanoi has not said anything about the many
political prisoners detained more recently who had no connection
with the former government.
   ``Among prisoners of conscience convicted in unfair trials have
been Buddhist monks, Jesuit priests, Protestant pastors, writers
and others believed to have been convicted solely because they were
critical of government policies,'' it said.
   The report said the 1989 Criminal Code Procedure contains no
provision for detention without trial and appears to make such
detention for re-education illegal. But the norms of the procedure
have not been comprehensively implemented, it said.
   Amnesty also expressed concern over the broad definition of
``crimes against national security'' in the code, and said this has
been used to convict prisoners of conscience in unfair trials.
   The report said prisoners of conscience include poet and writer
Nguyen Chi Thien, who has spent more than half his life in
detention. He is believed still under detention since he was
arrested for the third time in 1979, it said.

<HEAD>Rabbi Says East Germany Wants Jewish Investment To Slow Unity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ultra-Orthodox Jewish rabbi says East German
Communist officials have appealed for Jewish investment in their
crippled economy to help slow unification with financially powerful
West Germany.
   The Communist leaders also expressed disappointment that Israel
has not taken a strong stand against the prospect of German unity,
said Rabbi Zvi Weinman, who visited East Berlin this month to find
out how the state's 5,000 Jews are faring.
   During the private trip, Weinman met with several officials,
including Gregor Gysi, chairman of the former Communist Party, now
called the Party of Democratic Socialism, and Deputy Premier Lothar
de Maiziere.
   Israel and East Germany do not have diplomatic ties.
   Weinman on Tuesday quoted Gysi as saying only massive foreign
investment could slow down German reunification.
   ``Gysi appealed to Jews around the world to invest in East
Germany. He said he would give investors good conditions,'' Weinman
said in a telephone interview from his Jerusalem home.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government has rejected
East Germany's request for immediate aid of $9 billion, saying aid
would only be forthcoming when a new East German government takes
over after March 18 elections.
   During his Feb. 8 meeting with Weinman, Gysi also said ``he was
disappointed that Israel has not come out against unification,''
according to the rabbi.
   Since the Gysi-Weinman meeting, Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe
Arens has cautiously embraced unification, saying there was no
reason for Jews to be concerned if a united Germany was democratic
and recognized its historic obligations to the Jews.
   Arens' statement caused a furor in Israel, with some government
ministers demanding that he be rebuked. Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir has expressed concern about unification privately, but has
not taken a public stand opposing it.
   Israel's leaders cannot afford to disrupt flourishing ties with
West Germany but don't want to alienate the many Israelis whose
relatives were among the 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust.
   Weinman also quoted Gysi as saying East Germany would form a
special police unit to monitor the activities of emerging neo-Nazi
and fascist groups.
   Until the ouster of hard-liner Communist leader Erich Honecker
last year, East Germany's secret police, known as the Stasi, had
monitored right-wing groups. But the hated Stasi was dissolved
after the old government was toppled.

   Leaders of warring Cambodian factions
began peace talks today and guerrilla radio said government forces
launched a fierce counteroffensive against guerrillas in
northwestern Cambodia.
   There was no immediate confirmation of the reported attack by
Cambodian officials in Phnom Penh or in Bangkok.
   Government forces attacked this morning to try to retake a base
in the strategic northwestern district of Sisophon from the
guerrillas of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front, the
guerrilla radio said.
   ``Fierce fighting is going on'' for control of the base at
Kakaoh village, it said.
   Government forces captured another Liberation Front base in the
region Tuesday morning but the guerrillas retook it in the
afternoon, the broadcast said.
   Resistance officials and Thai military officers reported that
government forces also had struck Monday night near Svay Chek, a
gateway to Sisophon.
   The Liberation Front guerrillas seized the town in Battambang
province Dec. 5 as part of the stepped up guerrilla offensive.
   About 250 government soldiers backed by four T-54 tanks attacked
positions about six miles from Svay Chek for five hours, said Ok
Serei Sopheak, a senior official of the Liberation Front.
   He said the guerrillas lost no ground. Eleven government
soldiers were killed and 24 captured while only six guerrillas were
wounded, he claimed.
   A Thai military officer said the fighting could be termed the
start of a small counteroffensive.
   In Bangkok, Hun Sen, the premier of Cambodia's
Vietnamese-installed government, held talks over a lunch with
guerrilla leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk. They then went into a
second round at a Thai government building.
   A joint communique reaffirmed their agreement that a United
Nations presence ``at appropriate levels in Cambodia is essential
and should be encouraged.'' It also said they wanted a ``supreme
national body'' that would symbolize national unity, but they gave
no details.
   The communique said the two leaders thoroughly discussed issues
blocking a settlement, and ``felt there is now a better
understanding of the issues involved that may lead in the
not-too-distant future to a convergence of views on how to settle
the Cambodian problem.''
   The Thai-sponsored talks pave the way for wider negotiations
next week in Jakarta, Indonesia, said Suvit Yodmani, a Thai
government spokesman.
   The Cambodians have been quarreling over the composition of an
interim government that will manage the country before a proposed
general election.
   The Thai newspaper The Nation today quoted Cambodian Defense
Minister Gen. Tea Banh as saying the guerrillas have been receiving
more and increasingly sophisticated military aid since Vietnam
purportedly withdrew all its troops in September, ending more than
a decade of occupation.
   These arms, he said, were coming from China and the United
States and transported into the country by the Thai military.
   Hun Sen was to travel later to Indonesia for talks starting
Monday with guerrilla leaders and also involving Vietnam, France,
Indonesia and other nations.
   Son Sann, who heads guerrillas of the Liberation Front, said
Tuesday he would try to revive at Jakarta a guerrilla peace plan
Hun Sen already has rejected.
   That plan calls for a transitional government comprising the
Phnom Penh authorities, the Liberation Front, Sihanouk's group and
the third guerrilla force, the Khmer Rouge.
   Hun Sen will not have anything to do with the Khmer Rouge, which
killed hundreds of thousands of people during its 1975-1978 rule.
The Jakarta talks are expected to focus on an Australian proposal
for setting up a U.N. interim administration before an election.
   Sihanouk will not attend the Jakarta talks and instead plans to
go northwestern Cambodia Friday to end a decade of lavish living in
exile and reside in a bamboo hut in ``liberated'' areas of his
homeland, his spokesman said.

<TEXT>
   John Poindexter says former President Reagan's
testimony is favorable to his case, but the former national
security adviser wants to delay its release until after a jury is
sworn in for his Iran-Contra trial.
   Twelve news organizations on Tuesday suggested in a court filing
that the videotape and transcripts of Reagan's testimony Friday and
Saturday in Los Angeles be made available as soon as possible.
   Iran-Contra prosecutors told U.S. District Court Judge Harold
Greene, who is presiding in the case involving Poindexter, that
they have ``no objections'' to releasing the videotapes and
transcripts of Reagan's deposition now.
   But Reagan's lawyers filed court papers asking that the tapes be
withheld until the end of the trial.
   Poindexter's lawyers maintained in court papers that Reagan's
testimony ``is favorable to the defense.'' But the former president
did not support Poindexter in connection with key portions of
allegedly false letters which Poindexter sent to Congress in 1986,
according to sources familiar with Reagan's testimony who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Poindexter's letters embraced the White House's denials the
previous year that National Security Council aide Oliver North was
raising money or providing military advice to the Contras.
   In his initial answers about the letters, Reagan focused on
portions which stated the NSC staff was complying with the spirit
and the letter of the Boland Amendment barring U.S. intelligence
agencies from providing military aid to the Contras.
   Reagan, in his deposition in Los Angeles, supported those
sections of the letters. The ex-president has said publicly he did
not regard the NSC as being subject to the restrictions of the
Boland Amendment.
   However, under cross-examination by Iran-Contra prosecutor Dan
Webb, Reagan's attention was drawn to other statements in
Poindexter's letters referring to the earlier information provided
to Congress. That information included the denials that North was
fundraising or supplying military advice.
   Reagan agreed with Webb he didn't recall seeing those earlier
responses at the time Poindexter's letters were sent to Congress,
according to the sources. The earlier responses led to a guilty
plea by ex-national security adviser Robert McFarlane to
misdemeanor charges of withholding information from Congress.
   Poindexter's lawyers maintained in court papers that publicizing
Reagan's testimony now would have an ``incalculable impact'' on
prospective jurors.
   Disclosing Reagan's testimony prior to the March 5 trial date
could result in Iran-Contra prosecutors rejecting prospective
jurors who otherwise would be favorable to the defense, lawyers for
Reagan's former national security adviser said.
   They also said the testimony should be made public only ``after
the jury in this case has been sworn and instructed regarding trial
publicity.''
   Alternatively, Poindexter asked that the media before the trial
be provided only with a transcript of Reagan's testimony and that
access to the videotape be deferred until the jury is sworn in.
   In their own filing, Reagan's lawyers asked that copies of the
tape not be disseminated until the end of the trial, and that
public access to Reagan's testimony ``be limited to reviewing the
videotape at a location under control of the court.''
   Any earlier distribution of copies of the tape ``goes far beyond
the requirements of the First Amendment and may damage irreparably
the rights of the defendant and the former president,'' the former
president's lawyers argued.
   The news organizations told Greene that Cable News Network Inc.
would act as pool representative for distribution of copies of the
videotape to the news media.
   In addition, the news organizations suggested, transcripts
should be released at the same time as the videotape through a
commercial copying center selected by the news media.

<HEAD>Minister: Shamir's Peace Obstacles Lead to Anti-Israeli Terror</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAURICE GUINDI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Egyptian Cabinet minister said in an
interview published today that Israel's prime minister is blocking
Middle East peace efforts and creating a climate that leads to
terror attacks.
   Butros Ghali, state minister for foreign affairs, charged that
Yitzhak Shamir of Israel is the sole impediment to current efforts
to organize a peace dialogue in Cairo between Israelis and
Palestinians.
   Egypt initially proposed the dialogue last summer to discuss a
plan Shamir introduced in May for elections among Palestinians in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III became the prime sponsor
of the dialogue concept by making it the centerpiece of a
five-point proposal presented in October. No talks have taken place.
   ``The only obstacle so far has been Israel's reluctance to keep
up with the peace tide and the insistence of the Israeli prime
minister to plant obstacles after obstacles to prevent the start of
real movement toward peace,'' Ghali said in an interview with the
state-owned weekly Al-Mussawar.
   ``Israel's persistent refusal to talk with the PLO despite the
fact that it is the principal party qualified for the dialogue
under a full mandate from the Palestinian people ... shows a
position that is not serious about peace,'' he said.
   Israel considers the PLO a terrorist group, and Shamir has
sought assurances from Washington that it will be excluded from all
peace moves.
   Ghali blamed the absence of peace for terrorist acts such as a
Feb. 4 attack on an Egyptian tour bus in which nine Israelis died.
   He said the ambush was ``as much an aggression against Egypt as
an aggression against foreign nationals on our soil.
   ``But if we look for the roots of such incidents, be they in
Egypt or Israel itself or London or Paris, we undoubtedly will find
that the absence of peace remains a condition that spawns such
incidents.''
   The bus attack on a desert road between Cairo and the Suez Canal
was ``the product of anxiety, tension, lack of confidence and
despair that affect many parties because of continuing obstacles on
the road to peace and continuing intransigence,'' he said.
   Egyptian investigators say Palestinian gunmen carried out the
raid, during which Egyptians were ordered off the bus before two
masked men opened fire with automatic weapons and tossed grenades.
   Ghali also criticized the United States for tightened U.S.
immigration rules that he said are resulting in thousands of Soviet
Jews going to Israel.
   Arabs fear that many of the immigrants will settle in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, although Israeli government
officials deny there is a policy of settling them in the occupied
lands.
   About 12,000 Soviet Jews went to Israel in 1989, but under
liberalized Soviet emigration policies, 80,000 to 100,000 are
expected this year. More than 8,000 already have arrived.
   Ghali said Egypt ``cannot possibly interfere'' with the Soviet
Union's liberalization of travel for its citizens. ``All that
interests us is that they not be settled in the occupied
Palestinian lands,'' he said.
   ``The United States bears a fundamental responsibility, because
its decision to limit the immigration of Soviet Jews opens the way
for pressure on Moscow to route emigration in Israel's direction,''
he said.

<HEAD>Former Valdez Skipper Says Captains Were Advised To Stay on Bridge</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The skipper who commanded the Exxon
Valdez before Joseph Hazelwood testified that Exxon advised its
captains to remain on the bridges of their ships during any
hazardous passage.
   Michael Stalzer, who sailed the Exxon Valdez in 1987, read
Tuesday to jurors from a company manual that offered advice to
captains on the officer configurations necessary for operating the
high-tech tanker.
   ``What are the tanker captain's general responsiblities?'' asked
Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole.
   ``He's responsible for the safety of the ship, the crew and the
cargo,'' said Stalzer.
   He then read the section dealing with hazards including weather
or a voyage past rocks and shoals.
   ``Could ice be a hazard that presents a threat to a tanker the
size of the Exxon Valdez?'' Cole asked.
   ``If it's sufficient in quantity, yes,'' Stalzer said.
   Hazelwood has come under attack by the prosecution for leaving
the bridge of his ship in control of the third mate 10 minutes
before it grounded, spilling 10.92 million gallons of oil into
Prince William Sound. The March 24 disaster killed countless birds,
fish and wildlife and blackened hundreds of miles of rocky
shoreline.
   The 43-year-old former skipper is charged with second-degree
criminal mischief, a felony, and three misdemeanors, reckless
endangerment, operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent
discharge of oil. If convicted, his maximum penalties could be 7\
years in prison plus $61,000 in fines.
   The ship's third mate, Gregory Cousins, has blamed the ship's
helmsman for failing to follow steering commands that would have
kept the ship off jagged Bligh Reef.
   But Stalzer's testimony suggested that Hazelwood should have
been present on the bridge to direct the ship around chunks of ice
in the shipping lanes outside the Valdez Narrows.
   Cole has said he probably will rest the prosecution case against
Hazelwood by week's end.
   Another Exxon employee, William Deppe, at first appeared to
support Hazelwood's decision to let the third mate navigate through
the sound.
   ``One of the responsibilties a master has is to delegate a lot
of responsibility to other people,'' he said, adding, he would
entrust the command to another ``if I had an officer I had
confidence in to carry out commands.''
   But Deppe later said, ``I probably would have been on the bridge
and not left it to the third mate.''
   Deppe, who holds a captain's license and is assigned to a shore
job with Exxon, took over the Valdez after Hazelwood left the ship
to talk with investigators.
   In other testimony Tuesday, two marine engineers said three
backup systems built into the high-tech tanker to prevent accidents
were functioning perfectly when the tanker ran aground.
   One of the engineers, Stanley Andresen of Sperry Marine Inc.,
said the system, which includes an optional autopilot, is designed
to be as simple as possible for helmsmen to operate.
   Jurors also were shown a videotape of the crippled Exxon Valdez
stranded on Bligh Reef. Dan Lawn, who shot the footage, explained
the scene and pointed out the thick coating of black oil bubbling
up around the ship.

   The bomb slaying of an undercover narcotics
detective may be the result of a love triangle, not a revenge
bombing by drug dealers as was first suspected, according to a
police source.
   A Nassau police spokesman confirmed today that Nassau County
Police Officer Robert Horan is a suspect, although no arrest has
been made in the slaying.
   A second source, also involved in the investigation and who also
spoke on condition of anonymity, said Tuesday that the victim,
Suffolk County Police Officer Dennis Wustenhoff, 41, allegedly was
involved with Horan's wife, a federal Drug Enforcement
Administration employee.
   Wustenhoff was killed Thursday when a bomb exploded seconds
after he got into an undercover police car parked in front of his
home in Patchogue on New York's Long Island.
   Police at first thought drug dealers may have planted the bomb
to frustrate a current investigation or avenge one of Wustenhoff's
previous cases.
   The disclosure of the possible love triangle motive surfaced
Tuesday, a day after Wustenhoff was given a hero's farewell in a
funeral attended by more than 5,000 officers from 50 police
departments across the nation.
   Spokesmen for the Suffolk County police and Suffolk County
District Attorney James Catterson refused to comment.
   ``We are not going to give a progress report at this time,''
said William McKean, a Suffolk County police spokesman.
   Horan's name was confirmed by Nassau police spokesman William
Bendel. Horan, a 20-year veteran, was assigned to Emergency
Services Bureau for Nassau County, where officers receive bomb
detonation and explosives training.
   Police interviewed Horan on Tuesday in Cooperstown, N.Y., where
the officer recently bought a vacation home, the police source said.
   Suffolk police obtained a search warrant and used two
bomb-sniffing dogs to search Horan's Long Island home Tuesday, said
Kevin Cronin, a homicide detective who supervised the search.
   Wustenhoff's wife, a 14-year-old son and 10- and 12-year-old
daughters have been in hiding since the bombing because of
speculation it had been revenge.

<HEAD>City to Cite Low-Flying Choppers to Curtail Medfly Spraying</HEAD>

   Helicopters spraying a controversial
Medfly pesticide face prosecution under a new city ordinance
banning low flying helicopter formations at night.
   ``Realistically speaking, we can't stop them,'' said Lt. Terry
Blumenthal, who oversees city police helicopter operations. ``We
can only cite them afterward. ``It's going to be a tough situation
at best.''
   If convicted, pilots could face a $1,000 fine and a year in
jail, he said.
   The state is spraying 400 square miles of Los Angeles and Orange
counties with the pesticide malathion to wipe out the worst
infestation of Mediterranean fruit flies since 1981-82.
   Agriculture officials maintain the spraying is a safe and
necessary step to prevent the Medfly from harming the state's
multibillion-dollar farm economy.
   Pasadena's governing board early today approved the citywide ban
on nighttime helicopters formations below 700 feet. Emergency
helicopters will not be affected.
   Rick Cole, a member of the city's Board of Directors, said the
law was necessary to get the attention of agriculture officials who
have scheduled spraying tonight over a 53-square-mile area despite
objections from some of the municipalities encompassed.
   ``We need to do what we can to flex our muscle,'' Cole said.
   Earlier Tuesday, the Los Angeles City Council agreed to pursue
lawsuits and administrative appeals aimed at halting spraying and
to study malathion's potential health risks.
   ``This is going to be a tough case. But it's a case we have to
fight,'' said Los Angeles Councilman Joel Wachs. ``The public has a
right and a demand to know if the government is leveling with
them.''
   The city of Burbank adopted a similar measure Tuesday.
   Los Angeles Councilman Michael Woo called the spraying a
``blatant example of the urban population of this state being held
hostage to the agricultural industry.''
   Clark Biggs, spokesman for the California Farm Bureau, said
farmers sympathize with Southern Californians for having to live
with the spraying, but contended that wiping out the Medfly is in
everyone's best interest.
   The Mediterranean fruit fly lays its eggs in more than 250
varieties of fruits, vegetables and nuts grown in California. The
crops are destroyed when the larvae hatch and growing maggots eat
their way out.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was treated
to a demonstration of some of the U.S. Navy's most sophisticated
weaponry today as he witnessed a simulated sea and air battle
aboard an Aegis cruiser based in this port city.
   Cheney, in Japan on the last stop of his two-week tour of Asian
nations hosting U.S. forces, watched four huge blue computerized
screens aboard the USS Bunker Hill simulate an attack on the
American aircraft carrier Midway in the Sea of Japan.
   ``Got a mad, mad, mad at zero-15 miles,'' yelled one sailor as
Cheney observed the crew in the ship's Combat Information Center
fend off a series of submarine and air missile attacks.
   Cheney watched the pretend battle in the darkened command center
as the screens in front of him danced with spots and lines
reflecting the positions of various Soviet attack bombers and
submarines, as well as the U.S. ships.
   Capt. Rodney Rempt told Cheney the ship was designed to
simultaneously track a number of enemy ships, planes and incoming
missiles within a 280-mile radius with its state-of-the-art
computerized radar and weapons systems.
   ``We fire long before seeing the whites of their eyes,''
asserted the ship's motto, inscribed on one of the computer screens.
   Another Aegis cruiser, the USS Vincennes, shot down an Iran Air
jumbo jet over the Persian Gulf in July 1988, with the loss of 290
lives, after the ship's crew mistook the airliner for an F-14
fighter plane.
   ``We are capable of providing defense in all sorts of different
realms for the Midway battle group,'' the captain told Cheney.
   The sophisticated cruiser is one of 10 ships home-ported in
Yokosuka, where some 7,500 military personnel are based fulltime
about 35 miles south of Tokyo. The port is the home of the Navy's
7th Fleet, which cruises the waters from Hawaii to the Indian Ocean.
   The secretary also was escorted by the commander of the 7th
Fleet, Admiral Henry H. Mauze.
   Cheney left the command center to chat with the 350 sailors and
officers aboard the cruiser, some of whom asked him about
congressional moves to slash the defense budget and expressed
concern over possible pay cuts and promotion difficulties.
   ``If the Cold War is over and they cut ships and carriers, won't
our deployments be extended?'' asked one of the sailors.
   Cheney responded that his primary priority was to preserve pay
and quality of life for the armed forces even if defense budgets
are reduced.
   ``We'd rather shrink the size of the force to preserve the
quality than get in the business of cutting pay and benefits,''
Cheney said. ``We want to manage it so we don't do violence to the
all-volunteer force that we have today.''
   Cheney dines tonight with Japanese Defense Minister Juro
Matsumoto. He meets Thursday with high-ranking Japanese officials,
when he is expected to discuss Pentagon proposals for a 10 percent
to 12 percent cutback in U.S. troop strength in the Pacific Rim.
Cheney is also seeking a sizable increase in Japan's $2.4 billion
annual contribution to the $7 billion cost of basing America's
50,000 soldiers, sailors and marines in Japan and Okinawa.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said the Soviet
Union ``has an inalienable right'' to guard against political or
economic damage from a reunified Germany and said Europe's postwar
borders must be guaranteed.
   In an interview published today in the Communist Party newspaper
Pravda, Gorbachev said he believes it is up to the Germans to
decide the nature and timing of unification.
   But he said a united Germany must respect Europe's current
borders and that only the four victorious Allies of World War II
can determine Germany's final status.
   Emergence of a reunited Germany as a powerful economic and
military force in central Europe has aroused concern, particularly
among the Russians and Poles, who lost millions of people to Nazi
aggression and acquired territory after World War II that had
belonged to Germany.
   Kremlin spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said today that the
Soviet Union supports Poland's desire to join talks with the Allies
and the two Germanys on unification.
   ``We must discuss this with other participants, but we
understand that Poland has the right because Poland suffered most
during the war,'' he told a news conference in the Philippines.
   Progress toward reunification has accelerated in recent weeks.
Premier Hans Modrow of East Germany, plagued by mass emigration and
a crumbling economy, asked on Tuesday for immediate reunification
talks under the formula worked out with the Allies last week in
Ottawa.
   But Gorbachev cautioned: ``No one has a right to ignore the
negative potential formed in Germany's past, especially as it is
impossible to fail to consider people's memory of war, of its
horrors and losses. Therefore, it is very important that Germans,
deciding the question of unification, should be aware of their
responsibility.
   ``This applies particularly to our country, to the Soviet
people. It has an inalienable right to expect, and the possibility
to exert efforts to ensure, that our country should not sustain
either moral or political or economic damage from German
unification.''
   Gorbachev said Germans should decide the form and schedule of
unification, but emphasized that Germany unity also concerns others
and ``any encroachment upon the borders of other states must be
ruled out.''
   Gorbachev specifically mentioned Poland's western border. West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's failure to make a public pledge to
respect that border prompted Poland to request the role in talks on
unification between the two Germanys and the Allies.
   Kohl, speaking Tuesday in East Germany, promised that ``peace
will emanate'' from a reunified Germany.
   In Paris, Adam Michnik, editor of Poland's most influential
newspaper, Gazeta Wyborcza, said Tuesday that Kohl must ``openly
declare'' that he recognizes the existing border if he wants
``credibility with his neighbors.''
   Bronislaw Geremek, leader of the Solidarity bloc in Poland's
parliament, said: ``The only way to change the border is war.''
   The two were attending a conference on the future of Eastern
Europe.
   Both Germanys are bound by treaties to respect the frontier, but
a united country would not be, and some conservatives in West
Germany have suggested reunification be sought within the 1937
borders.
   In 1937, one-third of what is now Poland was German territory.
   Gorbachev spoke in the interview of the rights of nations to
protect their interests, and said: ``I refer primarily to Poland.
The inviolability of its postwar borders, like the borders of other
states, must be guaranteed. Only an international legal act can
provide such a guarantee.''
   Speaking about a united Germany's relationship with NATO and the
Warsaw Pact, he said the alliances will have a role as a new
European security system evolves, and any disruption of the
military-strategic balance is unacceptable.
   East Germany is Moscow's most important military ally and about
two-thirds of the 575,000 Soviet troops in Eastern Europe are
stationed there.
   However, Moscow has agreed to a proposal set forth by President
Bush to cut its troops in Eastern Europe to 195,000 and there is
considerable disagreement among NATO and Warsaw Pact members over
whether a united Germany will be neutral, belong to the NATO
alliance or be split into two security zones.

<TEXT>
   It was a con worthy of Tom Sawyer _ persuading
30 people to pay up to $500 each for an unauthorized job painting
stripes on elevated-train pillars.
   But it was no fresh-faced boy who allegedly pulled this con,
said police, who arrested 63-year-old Vincent Pannone of Brooklyn
on fraud and larceny charges Tuesday. He was later released.
   Pannone took $250 to $500 from at least 30 job seekers, telling
them it was a refundable fee for health insurance, said Edward
Barbini, a spokesman for state Attorney General Robert Abrams.
   The painters never saw their money again and got little or no
pay for painting hundreds of pillars with black and white stripes,
Barbini said. Some worked as long as four months before giving up.
   Someone, presumably a disgruntled worker, firebombed Pannone's
Cadillac on Jan. 24, Barbini said.
   Barbini said Pannone placed newspaper advertisements claiming
his Show N Tell Contracting Co. had a painting contract with the
Transit Authority and promising painters $92.50 a day.
   Unlike the Mark Twain novel in which Tom Sawyer persuaded other
youngsters to pay for the privilege of whitewashing his aunt's
fence, the pillar painting was not authorized, officials said.
   The painting, in a section of Brooklyn where the city subway
runs on elevated platforms, did not meet Transit Authority
specifications, which require zebra stripes only at intersections,
said spokeswoman Caren Gardner.
   Also, the paint covered only the lower sections of the pillars.
``We do not paint just pillars. When we paint, we paint an entire
structure,'' Gardner said.
   Authorities said Pannone has an arrest record dating back to
1957, when as a 30-year-old clerk earning $62 a week, he was
convicted of pilfering $174,000 from his employer, the American
Express Co.
   If convicted of the fraud and larceny charges, Pannone could
face a maximum penalty of four years in prison and $5,000 in fines.

   A 12-year-old girl who was the first
heart-liver transplant recipient returned to the operating room
today because doctors feared she was bleeding internally a day
after a second liver transplant.
   Stormie Jones' new liver was functioning, but a drop in blood
pressure Tuesday night prompted doctors to reopen the incisions
this morning, said Children's Hospital spokeswoman Lynn McMahon.
   ``They really are not considering this any type of setback,''
she said. ``Stormie is doing very well. She is incredibly strong.''
   Doctors estimated it would take several hours to determine if
she was bleeding and to locate the source, Ms. McMahon said.
   Stormie had asked her doctors for a new liver in November, after
she began to have symptoms of liver inflamation, her mother, Lois
``Suzie'' Purcell, 33, said at a news conference.
   Stormie became especially ill two weeks ago, suffering from
weakness, jaundice and itchiness.
   Doctors decided Feb. 13 that Stormie's liver should be replaced
because of damage from hepatitis caused by an unknown virus in
early January, when she was hospitalized for treatment of an
infection.
   Her family was notified Monday that a suitable donor organ was
available. The hospital declined to release information about the
donor.
   The 10-hour transplant operation began about 3:15 a.m. Tuesday,
nine hours after Stormie and her mother arrived from their home in
the Fort Worth, Texas, suburb of White Settlement.
   Stormie had no qualms about undergoing another major operation,
her parents said.
   ``It's kind of like poker _ you can't win if you don't play,''
said Stormie's stepfather, Alan Purcell. ``We had no choice but to
play the game.''
   Monday night, the girl spent her time asking why doctors and
nurses seemed to be delaying preparations for surgery.
   ``She was asking, `When are they going to get here?' `When are
they going to show up?' and `I want my liver,''' Mrs. Purcell said.
   Dr. Andreas Tzakis, who led a seven-member team of surgeons,
said the new liver ``seemed to start functioning right away.'' He
said Tuesday that doctors expected no complications during
Stormie's recovery because of her relatively good health.
   The girl's heart was not affected by the disease, Tzakis said.
   ``Her heart responded perfectly during the transplant,'' he said.
   Stormie received a new heart and liver on Feb. 14, 1984, to
control levels of cholesterol 10 times higher than normal. Her
cholesterol level has since decreased to nearly normal, Tzakis said.
   Starzl replaced the girl's heart and liver with those of a
4-year-old girl who had died in a New York car accident.
   The success rate of a second liver transplant is estimated at 65
percent to 70 percent, hospital officials said.

   Police stalking a bank robber who
preferred certain bank branches correctly predicted where the thief
would strike next and nabbed a suspect emerging from a bank after a
holdup.
   Allen Lorenzo Mills, 34, of Capitol Heights, was charged with
armed robbery and assault with intent to rob after he tried to
leave a Sovran bank branch Tuesday.
   Police said a man who had become known as the ``bearded bank
robber'' seemed to prefer Sovran Bank branches, striking three
times at one branch and once previously at the Bladensburg branch
that was held up Tuesday.
   Police guessed the robber might return to the Bladensburg branch
because his robbery there had been among the most lucrative, and
set up a stakeout.
   Shortly after noon, a man who resembled photographs obtained
during other bank robberies entered the bank, police said. Within
seconds, a special alarm in the bank alerted authorities that a
robbery was in progress.
   Undercover officers met the man as he walked out the door and
arrested him without incident, police said.
   ``We've had several banks under surveillance over the last two
weeks, but today, this was the only bank we were watching,'' said
Maj. Tony Leo, commander of the Special Operations Division. ``The
officers figured he would come back to this branch sooner or later
and he did.''
   Police are investigating whether Mills is connected to at least
six other robberies committed in the past two months, including
another Tuesday in District Heights.

   Henry Brandon, a Hollywood character actor
who ranged from Indian chieftains to the comic foil for Laurel and
Hardy has died of an apparent heart attack. He was 77.
   Brandon was working up to the time of his death Feb. 15,
primarily doing voice-overs for commercials, and was again cast as
an Indian in a television movie, said his agent, Gary Butcher.
   He was the animators' model for Captain Hook in Walt Disney's
``Peter Pan,'' Butcher said.
   Born in Berlin, Brandon came to Hollywood with his family as a
baby. He caught the attention of Hal Roach, the producer of the
Laurel and Hardy comedies, and was cast under his real name, Henry
Kleinbach.
   He played Old Barnaby in the 1934 classic ``Babes in Toyland.''
   His other film credits include ``Beau Geste,'' ``Nurse Edith
Cavell,'' ``Underground,'' ``Joan of Arc,'' ``Pony Express,'' ``The
War of the Worlds,'' and ``Auntie Mame.''
   He played Indian chiefs 26 times, including parts in director
John Ford's ``The Searchers'' and ``Two Rode Together.'' His film
work extended to the mid-1970s.
   Survivors include a brother and sister.

   Shiite Moslem militiamen opened fire at a
group of U.N. peacekeepers in south Lebanon today and wounded three
Irish soldiers, one of them critically, U.N. spokesman Timur Goksel
said.
   Goksel said the soldiers were attacked by gunmen from the Amal
militia in the village of Haddatha, just north of Israel's
self-proclaimed ``security zone.''
   The three soldiers were flown to the field hospital of the U.N.
Interim Force in Lebanon in the southern border town of Naqoura,
Goksel said. Their names were not immediately available.
   Amal leaders were investigating the incident. The militia is
known to have good relations with the 5,800-strong U.N.
peacekeeping force, which has been stationed in south Lebanon since
March 1978.
   A spokesman for Amal in Beirut, who refused to be named, said
the firefight could have developed due to ``personal reasons.'' He
did not elaborate
   ``The investigation is currently under way. Of course, we regret
the clash and stress that it was not politically motivated. Our
militiamen are under strict orders to respect UNIFIL,'' the
spokesman added.
   UNIFIL, drawn from nine nations, mans a narrow buffer of south
Lebanon separating Israel's security zone from predominantly Shiite
villages hostile to Israel.

<HEAD>Jury Finds Evangelist Guilty of Murder in Child's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILTON, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An evangelist has been convicted of
first-degree murder in the starvation death of a 4-year-old girl
she was allegedly trying to exorcise of evil spirits.
   Mary Nicholson, 40, of Pace, showed no emotion when the verdict
was read Tuesday and refused to comment afterward.
   Darlene Jackson, the mother of Kimberly McZinc, had pleaded
guilty last March to third-degree murder and child abuse in her
daughter's beating and starvation death on Feb. 8, 1988.
   Ms. Jackson, 33, who is serving a seven-year prison sentence,
told jurors last week that Ms. Nicholson convinced her that
Kimberly was possessed by demonic spirits that could be exorcised
only through strict diet and discipline. She was the state's key
witness in Ms. Nicholson's seven-day trial.
   Ms. Nicholson was also found guilty of aggravated child abuse.
Santa Rosa Circuit Judge George Lowrey ordered a pre-sentence
investigation into the evangelist and said sentencing would be
scheduled when it is completed.
   Assistant State Attorney Kim Skievaski said earlier he would not
seek the death penalty.
   The only other penalty for a first-degree murder conviction is
life in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years. The
aggravated child abuse conviction is punishable by up to life in
prison.
   ``I am glad to see someone's paying for my daughter's death,''
said Kimberly's father, Kenneth McZinc.
   Earlier Tuesday, Skievaski told the jurors in his closing
arguments that Ms. Jackson ``was led like a cow with a ring through
her nose to believe her child was possessed by evil spirits.''
   But defense attorney R. Glenn Arnold argued that Ms. Jackson, a
former schoolteacher, was having religious visions long before she
met Ms. Nicholson and that her testimony about his client's
participation in Kimberly's death was just another dream or
hallucination.
   Witnesses testified that Kimberly weighed 28{ pounds when she
died. A child her age and height should have weighed about 45
pounds.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Sandinista supporters on
foot or in cars, trucks, buses and wheelchairs began gathering
today for President Daniel Ortega's final campaign rally.
   Bands of youths stayed up all night raising black-and-red
banners across two parade routes, and crowded vehicles began
arriving from out of town before dawn for this evening's rally
alongside Lake Managua.
   ``We're here to flatten Violeta,'' said Jorge Luis Garcia
Castana, a Sandinista army veteran who was almost totally blinded
by mortar fragments in Nicaragua's civil war.
   He and other disabled veterans said they thought a vote for
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro was a vote for the U.S.-supported
Contra rebels who left them crippled for life.
   They were part of a group of about 250 disabled veterans, 23 in
wheelchairs, who made a 17-day, 160-mile trek from the Honduran
border under their own power.
   Meanwhile, the secretary-general of the Organization of American
States, Joao Baena Soares, arrived to head a contingent of more
than 400 OAS election observers.
   ``We are convinced that on election day there will be
tranquillity that will allow Nicaraguans the free exercise of their
right to vote,'' said Baena Soares in an airport arrival statement.
   Election observers said the biggest danger of violence might
come in small towns and rural areas where politics become part of
local feuds or ``Hatfield-McCoy situations,'' as one put it.
   The observers are important to both sides; Mrs. Chamorro's
United National Opposition hopes they will enforce a fair vote,
while the Sandinistas want to legitimize their government.
   On Tuesday, Mrs. Chamorro said she was certain of victory but
could accept defeat and called on the ruling Sandinistas to make
the same guarantee.
   ``We don't know if they have accepted the rules of the election
game,'' Mrs. Chamorro told about 400 of her UNO coalition workers.
   Sandinista campaign manager Bayardo Arce told reporters that
Ortega was willing to turn over the government in the
``hypothetical'' event of a loss.
   Three U.S. officials just back from Nicaragua predicted an upset
victory for Mrs. Chamorro.
   ``If I were a betting man, I'd go with the longshot. I think
she's going to upset him,'' said Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., who
made the trip with Reps. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., and Doug Bosco,
D-Calif.
   The election is being held as part of a Central American accord
also designed to disband the U.S.-supported Contra rebels who have
been trying to topple the Sandinistas since 1981.
   The voting pits the Sandinistas against Mrs. Chamorro's UNO, a
14-party coalition, and eight other opponents. A president,
vice-president, 90-member assembly and local officials will take
office April 25 for a six-year term.
   Arce said the Sandinistas were optimistic the United States
would change its hostile policy toward Nicaragua if the Sandinistas
won an election certified as fair by international observers.
   Alfredo Cesar, one of Mrs. Chamorro's top advisers, said Ortega
would have a chance to become a historical figure by becoming the
first head of a revolutionary government in the Americas to step
down voluntarily.
   ``We have lots of guys in Latin America who refuse to hand over
power,'' said Cesar in an interview with The Associated Press.
   ``If he didn't, he'd be just one more little dictator. But he
has a chance to make history,'' Cesar said.
   The Sandinistas were generally seen as leading, but the outcome
was considered uncertain because so many Nicaraguans were reluctant
to tell strangers who they support.
   Managua was festooned with red-and-black Sandinista party
banners and slogans, and a red-and-black hot air balloon floated
over the city briefly.
   Youths toted Sandinista backpacks. Only a few blue and white UNO
signs were visible.
   But an undercurrent could be felt even at a Sandinista reception
for the international press.
   One reporter asked for a drink that was renamed the ``Nica
libre'' after the Sandinistas took power in 1979 and was coldly
told, ``It's called a rum-and-Coke.''

   Rival Christian forces today used a
cease-fire to stockpile weapons and redeploy troops for their next
battle, while civilians fled their ruined neighborhoods for refuge
in safer Moslem areas.
   Samir Geagea, leader of the Lebanese Forces militia, refused to
give any concessions to Gen. Michel Aoun and said his fighters were
ready for war.
   A source close to Geagea's command said his militia had adopted
a new military plan to block any attempt by Aoun to storm its
strongholds if the current cease-fire collapses.
   ``If clashes break out anew, it will be a tough, crushing battle
throughout the Christian enclave,'' the source said.
   Snipers killed one person and wounded five in various parts of
the Christian enclave today, police said.
   By police count, the fight for the 310-square-mile enclave has
killed at least 673 people and wounded 1,877, in addition to
inflicting more than $750 million in damage. The dead include 97
soldiers killed since the confrontation broke out Jan. 30.
   The fighting began when Geagea refused Aoun's demand that he
disband the Lebanese Forces, the largest Christian militia in
Lebanon.
   Geagea's 6,000-strong militia has deployed about one-third of
its fighters in east Beirut, the military source said. They are to
defend its urban strongholds and deny Aoun access to the port
through the streets of the Ashrafiyeh district. Aoun lost the port
in the early days of the fighting.
   Military analysts believe Aoun must regain control of the port
to ensure safe supply lines by sea before accepting any peace
settlement.
   The Lebanese Forces moved new heavy fire power into place in the
Kesrouan mountains to harass Aoun's back if he tries to move into
the port area, the source said.
   The upgraded fire power includes about 120 truck-mounted
multi-barreled rocket launchers brought out of weapons depots. The
launchers, obtained from Iraq more than a year ago, can fire 40
122mm shells a minute.
   Geagea's men are outnumbered by Aoun's army at least 3-to-1 and
hoped to counter his superiority with their upgraded weapons, the
source said.
   Lebanese forces militiamen, with nearly 15 years' experience in
street battles, ``are waiting for Aoun's army in the narrow alleys
of Ashrafiyeh, which has become a huge garrison,'' the source said.
   The militia force defending the port, Ashrafiyeh and the
military headquarters of Karantina have been beefed up from 1,200
to 2,000 men, the source said.
   The surrender of Aoun's troops Saturday at Adma, an isolated
pocket in Kesrouan, freed the militiamen for the new deployment.
   The source said the bulk of the militia's fighting force, backed
by tanks and armored personnel carriers, was deployed along the
southern and eastern edges of Kesrouan province, separated from
Aoun's troops by a no-man's-land of just a few hundred yards.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with
regulations, confirmed that both factions were bolstering their
forces. Aoun's army stockpiled ammunition, especially tank cannon
and howitzer rounds, in depots in the Metin mountains northeast of
the capital.
   Meanwhile, civilians continued to desert the Christian enclave,
seeking refuge in the predominately Moslem areas outside the
enclave. The Christian communities, dispersed throughout Lebanon
before the civil war, have gradually consolidated in the enclave
since 1975.

   Storms have forced International
Trans-Antarctica Expedition members to remain in their tents for
extended periods as they near the end of their 3,600-mile journey
across the continent, a spokeswoman said.
   ``This is particularly frustrating as they get closer and closer
to their goal, and their thoughts begin to turn toward home,''
spokeswoman Jennifer Gasperini said Tuesday in a statement from the
expedition's St. Paul office.
   ``It is also worrisome for the team as they have only a two-day
supply of dog food.''
   However, rescuers with more supplies in a Soviet truck are
stationed about 40 miles ahead of the six-member team and could
turn back if necessary, Gasperini said.
   The team led by Minnesotan Will Steger and Jean-Louis Etienne of
France has an estimated 221 miles to go in the seven-month ski and
sled-dog journey.
   ``This expedition is crazy and we are crazy to have done it,''
Gasperini quoted team co-leader Jean-Louis Etienne of France as
saying.
   Over six days ending Monday, the team was able to travel just 56
miles, Gasperini said. It stayed Friday and Saturday at the
abandoned Soviet base of Pioneerskaya. The team traveled 26 miles
Sunday in temperatures as low as 53 degrees below zero with winds
of 33 mph and zero visibility, and it became tentbound Monday.
   Gasperini said that as the team descends toward Davis Sea and
the end of its trek, the weather is expected to get worse. The team
also is entering the worst area for crevasses, which are giant
cracks and fissures.

<HEAD>Court Sends Case of Retarded Texas Man Back to Appeals Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today told a federal appeals
court to restudy the case of a retarded Texas man who killed a
deputy sheriff in Houston 11 years ago.
   The justices unanimously sent John Henry Selvage's case back to
the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to determine whether the
constitutional claim he raises can be handled by a Texas state
court.
   When the nation's highest court agreed in October to hear
Selvage's appeal, it was expected to use the case to clarify the
scope and retroactive effects of a decision announced last July.
   In it, the court allowed states to execute mentally retarded
killers only if jurors were allowed to take a defendant's mental
condition into consideration.
   Selvage was convicted and sentenced to death for killing Albert
Garza, a Harris County deputy sheriff, during a July 30, 1979,
robbery of a Houston jewelry store.
   His lawyers argue that his death sentence is unconstitutional
because jurors did not consider his retardation.
   The justices were to decide whether there was a legitimate cause
for Selvage not raising that issue at some earlier stage. But in an
unsigned opinion today, they said the 5th Circuit court should
clarify whether Selvage's claim _ based on their July ruling _
could be made in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.
   Lawyers for Selvage and the state disagree over whether his
constitutional argument is procedurally barred in that state court.
   ``The (5th Circuit court) is more familiar with Texas law than
we are, and we therefore ... remand the case to it for
determination of whether (Selvage's) claim is presently
procedurally barred under Texas law,'' the court's brief opinion
said.
   The case is Selvage vs. Collins, 87-6700.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Federal Regulations on Social Security Overpayments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today upheld federal
regulations aimed at saving the government time and money when it
mistakenly overpays some Social Security recipients.
   The justices, voting 5-4 in a case from Colorado, said the rules
are a reasonable interpretation of the Social Security Act. The
court rejected arguments that needy recipients could suffer undue
hardship.
   The regulations apply to two Social Security programs: old age,
survivors and disability insurance benefits and supplemental
security income.
   Adopted by the Department of Health and Human Services, the
rules cover instances in which the government at different times
overpays and underpays recipients.
   The rules allow officials to balance the overpayments against
underpayments, arriving at a net amount that is owed either the
government or the receipient.
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals based in Denver ruled in
1988 that the regulations illegally may deprive needy recipients of
the chance to keep overpayments.
   The appeals court said federal law requires the government to
abandon recovery of overpayments when a recipient is blameless or
if returning the extra money would cause the recipient serious
hardship.
   But the Bush administration said the appeals court misunderstood
the way the rules work.
   Administration officials said the regulations would not deprive
needy people of the opportunity eventually to keep the extra money.
   Government lawyers said the regulations would spare federal
officials from paying out millions of extra dollars automatically
and then going through an elaborate procedure to recover some of
the money.
   From 1981 to 1986, about 4.7 million people a year received too
much or too little due to errors in the retirement and survivor's
insurance program alone, federal officials said.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the Supreme Court today,
said the rules are reasonable. He was joined by Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmun
and Sandra Day O'Connor.
   Dissenting were Justices John Paul Stevens, William J. Brennan,
Thurgood Marshall and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   The case is Sullivan vs. Everhart, 88-1323.

<HEAD>University President Criticizes Local School Official's Praise For
Mandela</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boston University's acting president has
criticized Chelsea public schools' superintendent for holding up
South African activist Nelson Mandela as a role model for students,
according to a published report.
   ``Nelson Mandela is not someone who should be held up as an
heroic example of patient commitment to a good cause,'' Jon
Westling wrote in a Feb. 8 letter to Diana Lam, saying the African
National Congress leader ``has thrown in his lot with killers.''
   Lam became Chelsea superintendent last year after the university
began managing the school system in an unprecedented educational
reform effort. Westling was named Boston University acting
president recently when John Silber took a leave of absence to run
for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.
   Lam received the letter after she cited Mandela's human rights
crusade during a speech before a group of 8th-grade students in
Chelsea, according to today's Boston Globe. The newspaper said it
obtained a copy of the letter Tuesday.
   Mandela was freed Feb. 11 after serving 27 years in jail for his
role in the anti-apartheid struggle waged by the ANC. He helped
launch the ANC's guerrilla campaign in 1961 and has said he
supports continued armed struggle against apartheid.
   ``Nelson Mandela could have sided with the advocates of freedom
and democracy and of the non-violent abolition of apartheid.
Instead, he has thrown in his lot with killers,'' Wrestling wrote.
   Lam told the Globe Tuesday that she ``was surprised at
(Westling's) reaction and quite honestly ... very upset.''
   ``Here was a timely `teachable moment' for young adolescents who
rarely view themselves as active participants in experiencing, let
along shaping, history,'' she wrote in a response to Westling's
comments. ``... I stand by my words. I would be honored to have Mr.
Mandela as a guest in Chelsea, or in my home.''
   Telephone calls to Wrestling's office for comment went
unanswered this morning.
   The university issued a statement Tuesday that said ``this kind
of interchange of communication is what would be expected between
academic professionals who have challenging points of view.''

<HEAD>Restart of Key Weapons Plant Not Likely Before Summer, Official
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Production of plutonium triggers for nuclear
warheads at the Rocky Flats plant in Colorado may not resume
completely before late summer, a senior Energy Department official
said today.
   Production was suspended indefinitely late last year to allow
EG&amp;G Inc., which runs the plant under an Energy Department
contract, to install new safety and management practices. The plant
is the only source of plutonium triggers and is considered a vital
link in the U.S. nuclear weapons production chain.
   Adm. J.M. Barr, a top adviser to Energy Secretary James D.
Watkins on nuclear arms production, said no firm target date had
been set for resuming production but that Rocky Flats was expected
to be in full swing sometime between July and September.
   Watkins had said shortly after the shutdown that he hoped
production could resume by February.
   Speaking to a reporter during a break in a meeting with a
department advisory committee, Barr said Watkins now hoped to get
the first plutonium processing facility, known as Building 771,
back in operation by June at the latest. Five other buildings at
the site, near Denver, also are involved in plutonium processing.
   Barr told the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Facility Safety,
which is monitoring efforts to get Rocky Flats back in operation,
that by early April he would offer a specific target date for full
resumption of plutonium trigger production.
   ``We're afraid anything we would give you now would be wrong,''
he told the panel.
   Rocky Flats has been plagued by a variety of operating and waste
handling problems in recent years. Last June, the FBI raided the
facility in search of evidence of criminal violations of laws
governing the handling of radioactive waste. Rockwell International
Corp. quit as Rocky Flats operator last September.
   Barr told the advisory committee that the top objective of
EG&amp;G's overhaul of Rocky Flats operations is to improve the
``margin of safety.'' He stressed, however, that there was no
imminent danger to the public from Rocky Flats operations last fall.
   Dave Van Leuven, EG&amp;G's associate general manager for defense
production at Rocky Flats, outlined for the committee the tasks to
be completed before production resumes. He said, for example, that
more than 1,000 engineering drawings of safety systems would be
checked for accuracy. About 150 of the drawings have been checked
already, he said, and it will take another eight weeks to do the
rest.
   Van Leuven said the technical competence of about 1,500 plant
operators would be verified before production is resumed. He did
not say how many already have been tested, but he said the failure
rate so far was about 30 percent.
   EG&amp;G, a Massachusetts-based private technology company, runs
several Energy Department nuclear facilities.

   An empty Exxon tanker awaited a marine
safety inspection after it briefly ran aground in a narrow channel
at the mouth of the Columbia River, a Coast Guard officer said.
   The Exxon Philadelphia was making a scheduled stop at Astoria
for the inspection before heading to Valdez, Alaska, when it ran
into trouble Tuesday in foul weather, said Coast Guard Lt. j.g. Ed
Gibbons.
   An off-duty radioman notified the Guard that the tanker was
aground and five tugs were working to free it, Gibbons said. ``By
the time we got to talk to them, they were apparently under way.''
   Gibbons said the tanker's master reported that the boat was
empty and there was no hull damage and the ship docked at Astoria.
   He said gusts of more than 30 mph could have made it difficult
for the ship to navigate the narrow channel.

<TEXT>
   A forecast of more heavy rain threatens more flooding in the
South, where nine deaths are blamed on high water in the past week,
and more than a foot of snow broke a dry spell in southern Colorado.
   A flash flood watch was posted for tonight over much of
Mississippi, where up to 5 inches of rain was forecast.
   ``Our winds are picking up southernly, bringing in Gulf
moisture,'' said Wayne Gasson, meteorologist with the National
Weather Service in Jackson, Miss. ``The surplus moisture will be in
place before the storm gets here. That's one of the ingredients of
why we think it's going to be a very good rain producer.''
   In east-central Illinois, a federal disaster assessment team
said a Valentine's Day storm caused $3.5 million dollars in
property damage in Champaign County. Seven people in Urbana were
overcome Tuesday by carbon monoxide from charcoal grills they were
using to heat their home, one of thousands that has been without
power since the Feb. 14 ice storm, authorities said.
   ``They were awfully, awfully lucky,'' said Urbana Assistant Fire
Chief Richard Dunn. ``If the one hadn't woken up, they probably
wouldn't have survived.''
   In Georgia, Gov. Joe Frank Harris asked for $15.7 million in
federal disaster assistance to help nine counties devastated by
floods and tornadoes.
   Interstate 25 over Raton Pass in northern New Mexico was closed
for a few hours because of poor visibility caused by blowing snow,
but authorities reopened the highway late Tuesday morning.
   The snow in Colorado was welcomed by most.
   ``This is a very good deal for southern Colorado,'' said Joe
Baskin, a weather service forecaster in Denver. ``They've been dry.
They're well below their usual moisture levels across the southern
part of the state.''
   Trinidad, Colo., got 15 inches of snow and 8 to 10 inches fell
at Walsenburg.
   Nearly a foot of snow fell in parts of southwestern Kansas,
closing some schools. A woman died when the car she was riding in
slid into another lane and was struck by a truck.
   The weather service posted winter storm warnings for the Texas
Panhandle, where 7 to 10 inches of snow closed schools and sent
trucks skidding.
   ``It's snowin' and blowin','' said Buddy Loften of the Texas
Highway Department in Dalhart. ``We've got some (snow plows) out
there, but you go up and you go back down there and you can't tell
you were there before.''
   The storm, which began dumping snow on the northern part of the
Panhandle late Monday, forced officials to close a 200-mile section
of Interstate 40 on Monday in Arizona, and New Mexico authorities
on Tuesday closed two highways westward out of Clayton, N.M.
   Since late last week, floods have been blamed for three deaths
each in Georgia and Alabama, two in Mississippi and one in North
Carolina.
   The high water from heavy rain that drenched northern and
central Alabama was flowing southward along rivers, inundating new
low-lying areas and forcing the evacuation of more homes.
   The Alabama River was cresting 8 feet above flood stage at
Montgomery and was expected to crest at about 6 feet above flood
stage at Selma today.
   At Selma, Chief Deputy John Howell said the predicted crest
would mean that about 70 families would be flooded out of their
homes.
   The Sucarnoochie River in Sumter County destroyed seven mobile
homes and two houses and damaged 47 other dwellings.
   The National Guard has moved families out of 19 homes in
west-central Alabama's Greene County, where the Black Warrior and
Tombigbee rivers converge.
   The weather service at Mobile predicted 5 to 8 inches of
rainfall by Thursday, and meteorologist Jim Hyder said the
Tombigbee, Alabama and Mobile rivers in Alabama can expect crests
well above flood stage this week and next.
   A spokesman for the Red Cross said at least 2,281 families in
more than 36 counties had been affected by recent flooding and a
Feb. 10 storm, which spawned tornadoes and violent winds that
wrecked homes and downed power lines, mostly in central Alabama.

<HEAD>Legislature Receives Draft of Law on New Powerful Post of
Presidency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislators got their first look today at a draft
of proposed constitutional changes that would strengthen the post
of the presidency, now held by Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Vladimir Tumanov, an official at the Institute of State and Law
in Moscow who helped prepare the draft, said copies were
distributed to members of the Supreme Soviet, the national
legislature, which held closed committee meetings today. He said he
had not seen the draft and could not give details.
   Gorbachev has appealed to the Supreme Soviet to approve his plan
for a Western-style presidential system.
   The Washington Post reported today that copies of the proposed
changes have circulated in the Kremlin. It said that the changes
would, among other things, provide for the president to be elected
to six-year terms and give him veto power.
   The New York Times today also carried a story on the proposed
changes. It quoted legislators who have seen the draft as saying
the plan would include creation of a strengthened presidency this
spring and the immediate selection of the president by the national
parliament.
   Sergei Stankevich, a progressive member of a parliamentary
commission that considers draft laws submitted to the Supreme
Soviet, said the changes would give the Soviet president most of
the powers of his French and American counterparts without many of
their constitutional limitations, the Post said.
   However, deputies from the northern Baltic states are alarmed
over provisions that impose severe restrictions on the rights of
republics to secede and permit authorities to crack down on
``nationalist'' organizations.
   ``I don't think this new legislation will be acceptable to
anyone who believes in a constitutional system of checks and
balances,'' Stankevich told the newspaper.
   Alexander Yakovlev, a key Gorbachev aide, said the presidential
system was necessary to ensure the stable development of a
democracy in the Soviet Union.
   Deputies who have read the proposed changes told the Post the
draft includes the following points:
   _A six-year presidential term, with the first president elected
by the 2,250-seat Congress of People's Deputies, the parent body of
the Supreme Soviet. Subsequent presidents would be elected by
universal suffrage.
   The Times said the president would be elected to five-year term.
It said a nationwide, direct vote would not be held the first time
because the feeling is that the country now cannot afford the time
required to plan such a vote.
   _The president would have the right to veto legislation adopted
by the Supreme Soviet. A presidential veto could be overridden by a
majority in both houses of the Supreme Soviet.
   _The president could declare a state of emergency in any region
without securing the consent of the relevant republic.
   _The president would have wide powers to rule by decree when the
Supreme Soviet is not in session.
   _The president would have the right to cancel legislation
adopted by the parliaments of constituent republics.
   The Times said the changes would give the parliament the right
to conduct a vote of no-confidence in the president's government
and that if the president lost he could disband parliament and call
new elections.
   The Post said the draft could be submitted by the end of this
month or the beginning of March to the 542-member Supreme Soviet.
The Congress of People's Deputies, the supreme state body, would
have to approve any constitutional changes.

   Carlsbad (N.M.) Current-Argus on the drug summit:
   While some still claim the futility of fighting a drug war,
contending we have already lost it, others forge ahead, however
haltingly, refusing to lie down and die.
   The drug summit in Cartagena, Colombia, concluded with President
Bush admitting to the presidents of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia that
the United States must do something to curb the demand. Without
demand, there would be no production and sales.
   We were encouraged by that conclusion, but we must see more
tangible efforts made to convince the American public of the
dead-end road exemplified by drug use.
   Too little is being done _ either in terms of funds for
education or in direct communication _ to show all our citizenry
how terminal their drug use activities are.

   The Kansas City (Mo.) Times on the drug summit:
   Although many Colombians found the additional security
surrounding the four-nation anti-drug summit in Cartagena an
annoyance, the Colombians did a good job in looking after the
safety of their president and the presidents of the United States,
Peru and Bolivia. ...
   The significance of this meeting was mostly symbolic, a
courtship. It was the chance for the presidents ... to come
together to respectfully discuss a common problem, if only from
different perspectives.
   Put another way, it was a meeting of coca-supplying nations and
the leader of the hemisphere's No. 1 consumer of cocaine.
   (President) Bush said that an anti-drug cartel was born. That
cartel is only as good as the commitment to it and the
understanding of situations unique to each nation.

treaty under his arm.
   We run our country with symbolism these days.

risk to the president was real.
   The president felt he had to go to the Cartagena summit,
however, because it was an event that most of all was symbolic.

   The Indianapolis Star on a reunified Germany:
   The reunification of Germany is only a matter of time.
   West Germany has the vigor to nurse the sick East back to
economic health and put it on a sound course.
   The question of keeping Germany in NATO is a stumbling block.
The Soviets are not keen about the prospect.
   But the stumbling block may not be insurmountable. ...
   Membership in NATO could widen a reunified Germany's ties with
the Western community and deepen mutual trust between Germany and
other members of the alliance.
   If the current era of good feeling between the USSR and the
Western community continues and progresses into a phase of general
demilitarization and disarmament, NATO could evolve eventually into
a peace-keeping alliance in which even the Soviet Union and former
Warsaw Pact members have votes.

<TEXT>
   In his first campaign stop in East
Germany, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl told cheering crowds
that ``peace will emanate'' from a united nation and that his
country's social security system will protect them.
   Kohl was kicking off a conservative alliance's campaign for East
Germany's March 18 elections, the country's first free vote after
40 years of Communist rule.
   But West German politicians, who themselves face the voters in
December, are increasingly using East Germany's election campaign
to promote themselves and their causes.
   Meanwhile, East Germany's deputy defense minister and chief of
staff said today the two countries' armed forces should merge and
be deployed on the entire territory of a reunited Germany.
   ``Every sovereign state has the right to defend its
sovereignty,'' Manfred Graetz told the East German newspaper Junge
Welt. ``There are also neutral states that have armed forces. I
believe that a future Germany must be allowed this right.''
   Graetz also rejected extending NATO's territory over what is now
East Germany, but said he did not believe it could become a ``no
man's land.''
   His remarks could further complicate discussions over the
military role for a united Germany. East Germany and the Soviet
Union have insisted that the future state be neutral.
   West Germany and its Western allies want the country to remain
in NATO. The West German government has said no NATO or German
troops should be stationed in what is now East Germany.
   On Tuesday, most of the 90,000 people who crowded in front of
Erfurt's cathedral for Kohl's speech chanted ``Helmut! Helmut!''
and ``Our Chancellor!'' Many waved West German flags.
   ``There are fears in East and West of a Germany that would have
80 million inhabitants ... (and) be a tremendous economic force,''
Kohl said.
   He also observed that a reunited Germany ``will have to live
with its past, with the horrors that were committed in the name of
Germany this century'' and noted fears that it could again threaten
its neighbors.
   ``I take these fears seriously. ... Peace will emanate from
German soil,'' he said. Germans have been seeking to assure their
European neighbors and the world that a unified Germany will not
pose a military threat.
   In Moscow, Mikhail S. Gorbachev proposed an international treaty
on Germany reunification, saying his country ``has an inalienable
right'' to ensure that it does not sustain moral, political or
economic damage from a united Germany.
   In an interview published in the Communist Party newspaper
Pravda today, Gorbachev said a united Germany must respect Europe's
current borders and only the four victorious Allies of World War II
can determine Germany's final status.
   Both Germanys are bound by treaties to respect their current
frontiers, but a united country would not be, and some
conservatives in West Germany have suggested reunification be
sought within the 1937 borders.
   In 1937, one-third of what is now Poland was German territory.
   Kohl said he would seek massive investment by West German firms
and extend Bonn's social security safety net to offset the economic
chaos caused by what he called ``40 years of red dictatorship'' in
East Germany.
   ``We have created in the Federal Republic (West Germany) a
social security system that is exemplary in Europe,'' Kohl said.
``We want this system for people in East Germany as well.''
   Specifically, he promised East Germans that they could draw the
same unemployment benefits as West Germans after reunificiation and
said East Germans would get adequate pensions.
   Retirees would also see the value of their savings protected.
   Kohl was campaigning for the Alliance of Germany, which includes
the East German branch of Kohl's Christian Democrats as well as the
Democratic Awakening and the German Social Union parties.
   The coalition, which polls show running behind the Social
Democratic Party, is one of the most outspoken champions of German
unification.
   Kohl was repeatedly jeered by about 100 hecklers waving East
German flags, and several anti-Kohl posters, apparently printed by
left-wing groups, were pasted up in the city.
   But cheering broke out for minutes after Kohl's hourlong speech,
forcing him to appear several times at an open window overlooking
Cathedral Square.
   ``Nothing better could have happened,'' retiree Hans Wagner said
from the square.

<HEAD>Sudanese Strongman: Israel, Cuba Giving Rebels Military Help</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sudan's military ruler alleged today that
Israel and Cuba are giving military aid to southern Sudanese rebels
and that Israeli experts are helping train the rebels.
   Israeli and rebel spokesmen denied knowing anything about an
Israeli presence among the rebels.
   Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir, who leads the military junta
ruling Sudan since a coup June 30, spoke at a news conference at
the end of an official visit, his third as head of state.
   ``We have definite proof of the presence of Israeli experts at
rebel centers for training and operational planning and of military
support reaching the (rebel) movement from Israel,'' he said.
   He said his government has ``information that there have been
human losses among Israelis in some battle areas.''
   The Sudanese leader gave no details. But his main field
commander in the south was quoted Tuesday as saying that three
Israeli experts were reported wounded in fighting in the Equatoria
region.
   Equatoria is one of three southern regions wracked by civil war
since renegade army Col. John Garang's Sudan People's Liberation
Army launched operations against the Moslem-dominated government in
1983. The rebellion was to press demands for autonomy and economic
reforms in the south, inhabited mostly by Christians or animists of
African descent.
   Maj. Gen. Nasr el-Din Suliman, the government's military
commander in Equatoria, told the Sudanese newspaper Al-Inkaz
Al-Watany that his command had received a report saying three
Israeli experts were wounded in a mine explosion while inspecting a
rebel camp in Equatoria.
   In Jerusalem, Israeli Defense Ministry spokesman Dan Weinreich
said: ``I don't know about such an accident, and I don't know about
Israelis in southern Sudan.''
   In Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, a spokesman for the Sudan People's
Liberation Army, Lam Akol, said: ``There has not been a single
Israeli that has gone to the south or near the border'' between
Ethiopia and Sudan.
   Akol said the rebel command has not ``contemplated or
anticipated any form of assistance from Israel'' and charged that
Sudanese government claims of involvement by the Jewish state were
intended to ``isolate us from the Arab world.''
   In his news conference, el-Bashir said the rebels sent ``very
large numbers of young southerners'' to Cuba for ideological
indoctrination and military training. ``They are there now, and our
information is that there is a school in Cuba called the Sudan
school,'' he added.
   Dominique Cassiano, a member of el-Bashir's junta, told the
newspaper Al-Inkaz Al-Watani the rebels have 12,000 men in Cuba.
   El-Bashir told reporters that he and President Hosni Mubarak of
Egypt discussed how to end the southern Sudan rebellion peacefully.
They dealt with a potential Egyptian role in peacemaking, he said.
   The rebels and the government held peace talks in Addis Ababa
last August and in Nairobi, Kenya, in December. Both rounds were
inconclusive.
   The Sudanese leader asked Mubarak after the December meeting to
try to organize a third round of talks in Cairo. President Mobutu
Sese Sekou of Zaire also has been mediating.

   Los Angeles Daily News on the U.S. Postal Service:
   The U.S. Postal Service plans to slow its service as well as
raise its rates. Currently 4 percent of letters scheduled for
overnight delivery arrive late. The new plan will increase that
figure to 7 percent.
   But Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank denied that this will
amount to a ``degradation of service.'' He said in a recent
interview that what Postal Service customers will lose in
timeliness will be offset by more important improvements in
consistency and reliability.
   That's another way of saying that if consumers lower their
expectations far enough, it will be easy for the Postal Service to
reach its own.
   The problem with the Postal Service's plan is that it assumes a
great public willingness to reduce standards. That's a lot to
assume along with a possible 20 percent rate increase next year.

   The Hartford (Conn.) Courant on military spending:
   In the wake of Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's presentation of
the military budget for (the) next fiscal year, the big word in
Washington is strategy.
   Rep. Les Aspin and Sen. Sam Nunn, respective chairmen of the
House and Senate armed services committees, are saying that the
budget lacks an overall scheme. ...
   Nunn says that Congress would be inclined to support a defense
secretary who could show that his numbers are part of a long-term
plan to redesign America's military capacity relative to a reduced
Soviet threat. ... Cheney admits he has no such plan.
   No one in Washington does.
   The reason no one has a grand strategy is that no one saw the
changes coming in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. ...
   Grand strategy emerges from bold choices. So far there has been
no perestroika in Washington.

   The Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin on nuclear arms control:
   Has anybody noticed that public concern about nuclear arms
control has practically evaporated? ...
   When President Bush announced that plans to reduce nuclear,
chemical and conventional forces were going smoothly, White House
correspondents were curious only about troop levels in Europe. This
subject has taken center stage in a way that once would have been
inconceivable, overshadowing the news of progress toward the START
treaty. ...
   The public has tuned the topic out: The Soviets (don't) seem
very dangerous anymore, and most of Eastern Europe has skipped out
of the Soviet orbit, practically without a shot being fired.
   That must mean something.
   Well, let us hope it means that the West has actually ``won''
the Cold War. But if so, the war had more than one loser.
Organizations that called for nuclear disarmament are suffering the
mortification of contradiction by the Kremlin itself, and now are
finding it difficult to keep members and friends. ...
   Their counterparts at the other end of the ideological spectrum
aren't doing so well, either, but at least they have some pleasure
of vindication.

   The Philadelphia Inquirer on cigarette marketing:
   The last time poor R.J. Reynolds lobbed an easy pitch over the
plate, Louis W. Sullivan, the secretary of health and human
services, knocked it outta here.
   The secretary has been benched for some contests the White House
does not want any part of, for instance, family planning. But he
has been a tiger on tobacco: Within 24 hours of blasting Reynolds
for planning to test-market a cigarette called Uptown in
Philadelphia, the company dumped the test.
   It does tend to mess up a test-marketing effort if the secretary
of health and human services says your product is fostering a
``culture of cancer'' among the target group _ young blacks, in
this particular case. ...
   Sullivan knew it and Reynolds knew it, so that was that.
   That brings us to the next inning in this business. The fellas
at Reynolds are planning yet another limited rollout of a new
product. This time the test market is Houston, where the target is
women aged 18 to 20, one of the few segments of the U.S. market
where smoking is still on the upswing.
   Well, we could have told Reynolds what would happen. ... We
suppose it's silly to expect a company that's burying folks as
often as Reynolds is to fully appreciate the term ``decent
interval.'' ...
   But give the White House points for unleashing the secretary.
Having hit a home run with his efforts to protect young blacks, he
is apt to rip the cover off given the chance to defend motherhood.
   You'd have thought the geniuses in the Reynolds promotion
department would have considered that.

   The Milwaukee Journal on baseball arbitration:
   Baseball owners have done to spring training what Buster Douglas
did to Mike Tyson. But, while Douglas' boxing victory was not
immediately recognized, there is no doubt that spring training _
and the spirit of winter-weary baseball fans _ has taken it on the
chin. Eventually, Tyson got up off the floor. Maybe there's a way
to revive spring training, too.
   The owners and players are sparring over _ what else? _ money.
The main issue is the complex process by which disputes over player
salaries are resolved. Because they couldn't reach an agreement
with the players, the owners have refused to allow spring training
camps to open. As a result, February is even more bleak than usual.
   Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent is trying to mediate this
dispute, but his efforts seem as futile as they are well-intended.
This disagreement seems too tough to yield to ordinary negotiation.
The financial stakes are too large _ it is not unheard of for
journeyman ballplayers to be paid $1 million a year _ and the
differences are too wide.
   It is time to submit this dispute to binding arbitration. Not
only are the two sides deadlocked; time is short. Unless this
dispute ends by mid-March, the regular major league baseball
season, set to begin in early April, may have to be delayed. That
would cost real money and deprive baseball-hungry fans of games
they have waited a long winter to see.
   Because of the nature of this dispute, the arbitrator would have
to be a person of unquestioned ability. Such a person will not be
found easily or quickly. That's another reason that the search
ought to start now.

   Charleston (W. Va.) Daily Mail on coal strike settlement:
   The means of reaching the agreement were ugly, but everyone in
Appalachia must be happy with the new contract between the United
Mine Workers and the Pittston Co.
   The contract seems to ba a model of negotiation. The union got
what it wanted most and company managers got what they wanted most.
   For union members, this means fully funded medical and pension
benefits, improved safety requirements, single-employer status and
wage increases that over a three-year period will be 15 cents an
hour higher than the industry average.
   For company managers, this means flexibility in work schedules
and a reduction in the amount of money it contributes to the 1950
pension fund.
   As for the general public, this contract agreement means an end
to the violence and the reopening of all public highways. That's
not much, but that's about as well as innocent bystanders usually
fare in these deals.
   Was it worth it? Pittston's profits fell $63 million last year
to less than $4 million. The 1,700 strikers went without paychecks
for 10 months _ losses they will never recoup. West Virginia lost
whatever claim it had to being a safe place to do business. The
public footed the bill of sending troopers and U.S. marshals to the
coalfields.
   But perhaps everyone has learned something, and the hope is that
future negotiations will be less violent _ and less costly both to
the participants and the spectators.

<HEAD>Officials To Review 1982 Coors Groundwater Contamination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight years after Adolph Coors Co.
discovered waste solvents in two springs beneath its brewery,
public disclosure of the problem has led to a state and federal
review.
   ``We have no evidence to indicate there is a public health
problem,'' Dr. Tom Vernon, executive director of the state health
department, said Tuesday. But officials said state and federal
agencies would investigate how Coors dealt with the problem and
whether environmental laws were being met.
   ``I'm confident that there were no levels of these chemicals in
the beer,'' Coors Brewing Co. president Peter Coors said.
   The brewery, which markets its beer as being made of pure Rocky
Mountain spring water, said it discovered in 1982 that the waste
solvents had leaked from a corroded sewer pipe into the ground and
reached two of Coors' 40 springs.
   Coors said the company immediately began pumping water from the
springs to reduce the contamination level, and removed the affected
springs from its water collection system. Coors also rebuilt sewer
lines and hired contractors to remove solvent traces from the soil.
   An anonymous tipster told the state health department about the
problem in June 1988, but it was not disclosed publicly until a
recent report by KMGH-TV.
   Theodore Halaby, a Denver lawyer hired by Coors to conduct an
independent investigation after the television report, said the
chemicals found in the groundwater, including cancer-causing
tetrachloroethylene, never exceeded limits suggested by the
National Academy of Sciences. There were no applicable federal or
state standards for the substances at the time, he said.
   Halaby said Coors should have notified the health department
when it learned of the problems.
   Vernon said the health department has asked Coors to supply
documentation of its efforts to correct the solvent leak. He said
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would be consulted about
Coors' claim that no beer was made with the contaminated water.
   ``We commend Coors for taking the initiative in beginning this
investigation,'' said Vernon.

<TEXT>
   An army unit has safely recovered a live bomb
that had been buried under a hotel in the coastal city of Ningbo
since 1949, a Shanghai newspaper said.
   The Shanghai Daily said in its Tuesday edition that an army
demolition crew found the 330-pound, 3-foot-long bomb under the
Jiangbei Dongya Hotel.
   It was thought the bomb was dropped in an air raid by
Nationalist forces in July or August 1949, shortly before the
Communists triumphed in the civil war and the Nationalists fled to
Taiwan.
   People who remembered the raid said the bomb entered through a
second floor window, crashed through the floor and lodged itself
under the hotel without going off.
   Several hundred thousand people have slept above the bomb since
then. However, when the hotel was razed recently for rebuilding,
older staff members remembered the bomb and warned that
construction pile drivers might set it off.
   A construction worker discovered the bomb Feb. 6 and the army
engineers safely removed and detonated it.

   Prosecutors have launched criminal proceedings
against Pamyat, a Russian nationalist group that has been accused
of anti-Semitic actions, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
   Jewish groups have been demanding for years that Pamyat, a
loosely knit organization with affiliates nationwide, be prosecuted
for provocations against Jews.
   Literaturnaya Gazeta, a literary weekly, said Moscow prosecutors
are pursuing charges against Pamyat of ``inciting national and
racial hatred and strife.'' According to the newspaper, Pamyat was
charged because of a statement published in another newspaper
calling for a campaign to ``de-Zionize'' the country.
   According to the report, the Pamyat statement said, ``Jews and
their relatives must not be allowed to defend dissertations, to
acquire knowledge and get academic titles, to join the Soviet
Communist Party ... to be elected to local governing councils, must
not be appointed to leading party, government and other posts.''
   The report called Pamyat a chauvanistic group and praised the
prosecutor's office because it ``realized the danger and
unlawfulness of such extremist actions.''
   Many of the thousands of Soviet Jews emigrating to the West say
they are doing so in part because of a reported rise in
anti-Semitism. The Soviet press has responded to the reports
recently by carrying statements from government agencies condemning
people who fan inter-ethnic strife and promising to investigate.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival forces exchanged sniper fire in the
embattled Christian enclave Wednesday and stockpiled weapons and
ammunition in case their latest cease-fire collapses.
   Despite the occasional crackle of snipers' bullets, scores of
people abandoned their homes and sought refuge in safer, Moslem
areas.
   Police said one person was killed and five people, including a
6-year-old boy, were wounded by sniper fire between Samir Geagea's
Lebanese Forces militia and Gen. Michel Aoun's troops in east
Beirut and the northern suburbs.
   A police spokesman said the intermittent exchanges continued all
day despite the cease-fire, which went into effect Saturday in an
effort to halt the intra-Christian power struggle for control of
the 310-square-mile enclave.
   It was the 12th cease-fire since fighting broke out Jan. 30.
Geagea has refused Aoun's demand that he disband the Lebanese
Forces, the largest Christian militia in Lebanon.
   By police count, at least 673 people have been killed and 1,877
wounded in the worst intra-Christian fight in Lebanon's nearly
15-year-old civil war. Aoun's command said at least 97 soldiers
have been killed.
   A military source close to Geagea's command said the Christian
militia has a new plan to thwart expected efforts by Aoun to storm
through its isolated pockets of resistance in east Beirut.
   The plan aims at defending the militia's main stronghold and
powerbase in the Christian hinterland of Kesrouan, north of Beirut,
said the source, who refused to be further identified.
   It also outlines a major tank-led attack by Geagea's men against
the rear of Aoun's troops if the general tries to penetrate the
militia's stronghold in east Beirut and retake Beirut's port to
secure maritime supply lines.
   Aoun lost the port in the early days of the fighting.
   ``If clashes break out anew, it will be a tough, crushing battle
throughout the Christian enclave,'' the source said.
   About one-third of Geagea's 6,000 militiamen were deployed in
east Beirut defending the city's harbor, the adjoining hilltop
district of Ashrafiyeh and their war council headquarters at
Karantina, the source said.
   About 300 other militiamen have been deployed in the Lebanese
Forces' other Beirut pocket of Nabaa north of Ashrafiyeh.
   Lebanese Forces fighters, with nearly 15 years' experience in
street battles, ``are waiting for Aoun's army in the narrow alleys
of Ashrafiyeh, which has become a huge garrison,'' the source said.
   The major part of Geagea's militia, according to the source, was
entrenched along the eastern and southern flanks of the Kesrouan
province, separated from Aoun's lines by a no-man's land of just a
few hundred yards.
   The militia force in Kesrouan is backed by Soviet-designed T-54
and T-55 tanks, a variety of armored personnel carriers and a dozen
U.S.-made M-48 tanks gained from Aoun's 19,000 troops in previous
battles, the source said.
   He said Geagea also has upgraded his firepower in Kesrouan by
120 truck-mounted multibarreled rocket launchers brought out of
weapons depots.
   The Soviet-designed launchers, capable of firing 40 projectiles
a minute, were obtained by the militia from Iraq more than a year
ago.
   The Christian militia also called up some of its 20,000
reservists and assigned them to non-combat duties, the source added.
   The police spokesman also confirmed that both sides have been
``heavily rearming and reorganizing their forces. They are
preparing for war.''
   He said Aoun's command was reorganizing its lines in east Beirut
and the Metin mountains northeast of the capital, which overlook
the Kesrouan province.
   The army also stockpiled ammunition, especially tank cannon and
howitzer rounds in mountain depots in the Metn region, the police
spokesman said.

<TEXT>
   A fire inspector said Amoco Oil Co.
officials failed to keep authorities informed about a refinery fire
that killed two workers at a liquefied petroleum gas loading
station.
   Amoco fire brigades controlled Tuesday's fire effectively,
preventing the blaze from spreading to 500,000 gallon petroleum
storage tanks, said Hammond chief fire inspector James Walsko.
   But Amoco failed to keep Hammond and Whiting officials informed,
establishing emergency headquarters separate from posts set up by
the cities' officials, Walsko said. The firefighters' decision to
evacuate about 100 residents and plan for a greater emergency was
made largely in an information blackout, he said.
   The city fire department learned of the blaze only when a
firefighter saw smoke in the sky and an Amoco official called the
city environmental protection office, Walsko said.
   Amoco spokeswoman Lisa Houghton said the company called local
authorities in Whiting, Hammond and East Chicago, the communities
adjacent to the refinery, within minutes of learning about the fire.
   Amoco is willing to talk with police and fire officials about
improving coordination, she said. ``We will seriously consider all
of their suggestions,'' she said.
   She said Tuesday that the fire broke out during the morning in a
loading area about a mile from the main refinery building and a
half-mile from the storage area. The state fire marshal's office,
city investigators and Amoco are investigating its cause.
   Killed in the fire were Delphin Flores, 40, of East Chicago, and
Rich Misiolek, 40, of Crown Point, said Lake County coroner Dr.
Daniel Thomas. Three tanker truck drivers remained hospitalized in
fair condition today.
   The massive refinery stretches across sections of Whiting and
Hammond in a heavily industrialized and populated corridor of
northwest Indiana.
   The accident was the worst at the refinery since an October 1988
explosion at an asphalt plant that killed three workers and
seriously injured a fourth.

<TEXT>
   The military ruler of this southern
African country stripped King Moshoeshoe II of his powers Wednesday
and said the military council would rule without him for the time
being.
   Since taking power in a January 1986 coup, Maj. Gen. Justin
Lekhanya and his military council have said they were governing the
country in consultation with the king, while outlawing all
political activity.
   On Monday, Lekhanya ordered the army to detain three members of
the military council who were regarded as allies of the king. Two
of them were royal cousins.
   After the king refused on Wednesday to officiate at a palace
swearing-in ceremony for replacement council members, Lekhanya said
he understood the king's feelings of family ties, but the military
council was not a family matter.
   ``His majesty's powers, for the time being, will be vested in me
... with the assistance of the military council,'' Lekhanya said.
He said the king would remain head of state.
   The army, which had been deployed around the palace and the
military headquarters on Monday, remained in barracks Wednesday.
But witnesses said they saw members of the Royal Lesotho Defense
Force taking other soldiers out of their homes to detention.
Witnesses said some soldiers were taking others out of cars and
leading them away.
   Lekhanya did not refer to any new detentions, but he said in his
statement that the army belonged to the state, not to the king.
   Lesotho, a country of 1.6 million people, is completely
surrounded by South Africa.
   There have been reports of turmoil within the government since
revelations that Lekhanya fatally shot a college student in
December 1988. At an inquest seven months later, Lekhanya said he
shot the student, George Ramone, after the man tried to rape a
woman and fled. The inquest ruled the shooting was justifiable
homicide.

   Cambodia's premier and its former

   The radio said government forces attacked Wednesday, trying to
recapture a base in the strategic Sisophon district of northwestern
Cambodia, where the guerrillas have advanced in recent weeks.
   Premier Hun Sen and Prince Norodom Sihanouk met over lunch in
Bangkok and for several hours. Sihanouk leads an alliance of two
non-Communist groups and the Khmer Rouge, strongest guerrilla
faction.
   Hun Sen and Sihanouk issued a vaguely worded statement saying a
U.N. role ``at appropriate levels in Cambodia is essential and
should be encouraged,'' but did not specify how completely they
accepted a proposal for the United Nations to administer the
country pending elections.
   It said they wanted a ``supreme national body'' that would
symbolize unity, but gave no details. The statement said they
discussed issues impeding a settlement and felt ``there is now a
better understanding of the issues involved that may lead'' to a
settlemnt.
   International pressure has grown for a U.N. role in Cambodia to
avoid a return to power by the Khmer Rouge, whose brutal rule in
the 1970s cost more than 1 million lives through execution,
starvation or death from disease. Vietnam invaded in December 1978,
ousting the Khmer Rouge.
   Hun Sen and Sihanouk, who agreed to meet again later, expressed
hope that a meeting of all parties next week in Jakarta, Indonesia,
will open the way for resuming the Paris conference on Cambodia.
The conference broke up in August after little progress.
   Guerrilla radio said the attack in the Sisophon district was on
a base of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front led by Sonn
Sann.
   ``Fierce fighting is going on'' for Kakaoh village, it said.
   Soldiers captured another Sonn Sann base Tuesday in the same
district, but the guerrillas regained it later, the radio reported.
   Resistance officials and Thai military officers said government
forces also attacked near Svay Chek, a gateway to Sisophon, on
Monday and Tuesday. The guerrillas seized Svay Chek on Dec. 5.
   About 1,300 soldiers attacked guerrilla defense lines 6 to 12
miles from Svay Chek, said a statement from Ok Serei Sopheak, a
spokesman for the Sonn Sann high command said.
   He said they were supported ``far more than ever before'' by
rocket launchers, heavy artillery and at least six Soviet-made T-54
tanks.
   The high command claimed 49 soldiers were killed and 20 wounded,
and the guerrillas lost only one killed and eight wounded. It said
the guerrillas held Svay Chek.
   A Thai newspaper, The Nation, quoted Gen. Tea Banh, the
Cambodian defense minister, as saying the guerrillas had received
greater supplies of more sophisticated weapons since Vietnames
troops withdrew at the end of September 1979.
   Tea Banh said they were being supplied by China and the United
States via the Thai military, the paper reported.
   He said the guerrillas had advanced less than 40 miles from the
Thai burder, and ``we left several towns to the resistance forces
because we believed they were not worth defending.''
   Hun Sen, whose government was installed by Vietnam, is to meet
in Jakarta next week with guerrilla leaders and representatives of
France, Vietnam, Indonesia and other Southeast Asian nations. The
talks are expected to focus on Australia's proposal for an interim
U.N. interim administration in Cambodia.
   Sihanouk will not attend the Jakarta talks. His spokesman in
Bangkok said the prince would go to northwestern Cambodia on Friday
and live in ``liberated'' areas until his entire country was free.

<TEXT>
   Cholera has killed at least 80 people out
of 906 reported cases in the Zambian capital and surrounding areas,
it was reported Wednesday.
   The epidemic broke out in Lusaka this month, health ministry
officials said.
   A World Health Organization spokesman, Dr. Eric van Praag, said
the disease was being contained.
   ``There are cases still coming in from rural villages but the
disease has definitely declined,'' he said. ``The situation is
being contained and a smaller number of cases are appearing every
day.''
   The government, he said, was spending hundreds of thousands of
dollars on controlling cholera and was improving Lusaka's
inadequate sanitation system.
   Only a third of the capital's homes have sewage systems, while
others have open-air pit latrines.
   Bad sanitation, heavy seasonal rains, erratic garbage collection
services and overcrowding of slums all contributed to the cholera
outbreak, officials said.
   Health Minister Mavis Muyundu has ordered restrictions on public
gatherings, including funerals, weddings and sports events to halt
the spread of cholera from the western suburbs and central areas of
the city.
   Street vendors were ordered not to sell foodtuffs, and city
dwellers were advised to boil drinking water.
   Cholera is an intestinal disease spread mainly by poor hygiene
and and sanitation.
   City authorities have said Lusaka has less than six garbage
trucks on the road out of fleet of about 60 vehicles several years
ago and admitted they did not have the facilities to clear open
garbage dumps that proliferated in residential areas.

<TEXT>
   Redoubt Volcano erupted with a plume of
gritty volcanic ash again early today, just hours after the Coast
Guard ordered the shutdown of an oil terminal along the Drift River
because of volcanic hazards.
   Just after midnight, the 10,197-foot peak spewed a cloud of
abrasive ash that headed eastward toward the Kenai Peninsula.
Moderate ashfall was reported in Nikiski and North Kenai.
   Redoubt Volcano last erupted Feb. 15, sending a jet of ash and
steam nearly seven miles high and scattering grit that led
authorities to cancel classes for 2,000 students.
   The mountain was quiet for 25 years until a series of eruptions
began in mid-December, disrupting air travel in and out of
Anchorage during the holidays. Ash clogged all four engines of a
KLM Boeing 747 on Dec. 15, and the aircraft fell more than two
miles before the engines could be restarted.
   The Coast Guard order cited the threat to oil storage tanks
posed by flooding after recent eruptions of the volcano, said Bill
Lamoreaux, regional supervisor of the state Department of
Environmental Conservation. Volcanic activity can melt snow and ice
on Redoubt, leading to flooding downstream on Drift River.
   Previous eruptions have flooded the river, sending water
coursing through the terminal and creating the potential for an oil
leak in Cook Inlet.
   Last weeks' eruption partially flooded the containment area of
one empty tank at the terminal and forced the evacuation of workers.

<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. paid bonuses of
between $300 million and $350 million in the weeks before its
parent company filed for bankruptcy protection, officials confirmed
today.
   A Drexel spokesman said the payments were determined in December
and were not made with any knowledge that the firm would go out of
business. Drexel's parent company filed for bankruptcy court
protection from creditors last week.
   ``We did what we believed we had to do competitively, and it was
within both the norms of what the longstanding practice had been at
the firm and within the norms of the industry,'' spokesman Steven
Anreder said.
   Several published reports today said some individual bonuses at
Drexel exceeded $10 million.
   Year-end bonuses are standard practice on Wall Street, although
Drexel has been known for paying huge bonuses.
   Anreder said the size of most of the bonuses was determined in
December, while others were committed to early in 1989. Some
bonuses were paid in late December and some in early January, he
said.
   ``If you're not going to pay a competitive level you're not
going to have your people,'' Anreder said.
   ``There was no sense of foreboding here at all,'' he said. ``It
was only in the last week and a half that things were difficult,
but even then no one thought'' the firm would go under.
   Drexel's parent, Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc., sought
bankruptcy court protection after defaulting on $100 million in
short-term debt.
   Representatives of Drexel's creditors said they would examine
the bonus payments to determine if they could be recovered as part
of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.
   Creditors may face a hurdle in trying to recover any bonuses
because Drexel's securities subsidiary, which paid the bonuses,
wasn't covered by the parent company's bankruptcy filing.

<HEAD>Students Boycott Classes, Opposition Leaders Arrested</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 1 graf with students dispersing.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has arrested seven
political opponents, an opposition party said Wednesday, as
protesting university students boycotted classes and armed soldiers
patrolled the campus.
   The clandestine Ivorian People's Front said seven of its members
were arrested between Friday and Monday, apparently in connection
with the distribution of leaflets urging the ouster of President
Felix Houphouet-Boigny.
   Students also have demanded the downfall of the conservative
leader, but it was not clear whether the demonstrations were linked
to the arrests.
   In the past, the government has accused the Ivorian Popular
Front and its leader, Laurent Gbagbo, of inciting student unrest.
   In a statement Wednesday, Gbagbo asked the people ``to mobilize
for the conquest, to win a multiparty state, justice and dignity.''
   He challenged Houphouet-Boigny's Democratic Party, the only
legal political group in this West African nation, to ``the only
debate that matters today: peaceful transition to democracy.''
   Students interviewed Wednesday said they were angered by
continuing police harassment of opposition politicians. ``But this
is just one sign of the lack of freedom and lack of democracy that
we are protesting,'' said Gregoire Tape, a law student and member
of the year-old National Ivorian Commission for the Defense of
Human Rights.
   Soldiers with rifles roamed the campus in the luxury suburb of
Cocody and police watched a university residence in the poor suburb
of Yopougon, three miles away.
   Between 200 and 300 students gathered on the main campus and
soldiers did not interfere during a rowdy meeting to discuss
strategy.
   But in Yopougon, police ordered students to stop forming groups.
Students said police blocked them from going to the main campus
Wednesday, but there was no violence.
   On Monday night, police and soldiers beat up students and
stormed their dormitories after they set two cars ablaze.
   On Tuesday, they fired tear gas to force demonstrators to
disperse.
   They also charged students at the main campus after the
protesters stormed two buses and smashed their windows.
   There has been no comment from the government about the
demonstrations or the arrests, although Houphouet-Boigny was said
to be chairing a weekly Cabinet meeting Wednesday where the events
may be discussed.
   Students say they are protesting the opulent lifestyles of
government leaders while the country struggles through a recession
that has brought salary cuts, unemployment and declining living
standards.
   The students dispersed peacefully later Wednesday after
presenting demands to Toure Bakary, the university rector. They
requested a meeting with Houphouet-Boigny, an end to police and
troop harassment, and the dissolution of a student body that
effectively is a youth league of the ruling party.

<HEAD>France to Sell Pakistan a Nuclear Power Plant</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France on Wednesday ended a 14-year
ban on sales of nuclear energy to Pakistan, announcing a commercial
venture that would set up a nuclear power plant in the country.
   ``France pledges to authorize French industrial enterprises ...
to make rapidly a technical and commercial offer for the sale of a
nuclear power plant to Pakistan,'' President Francois Mitterrand
told a news conference during a four-day visit.
   Mitterrand did not say how big the plant would be.
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said a French-supplied plant would
be ``open to all international safeguards and monitoring teams.''
   Pakistan, however, is not a signatory to the international
nuclear non-proliferation treaty and refuses to sign it unless
India does.
   Pakistan must convince Washington each year that it does not
have a nuclear weapon before Washington frees millions of dollars
in loans. Ms. Bhutto has often said Pakistan does not have a
nuclear weapon nor does it want to produce one.
   ``Pakistan is not trying to enter into a nuclear arms race,''
she said again today, adding that Islamabad has pressed India to
sign a regional nuclear weapons test ban. India has refused.
   Mitterrand's announcement only vaguely referred to a 14-year-old
dispute between Pakistan and France over a promised sale of a
nuclear reprocessing plant.
   France reneged on the deal because of U.S. pressure to drop the
sale unless Pakistan agreed to sign international nuclear treaties
and open its nuclear facilities to international monitoring teams.
   Pakistan lodged a variety of complaints until a French
arbitration board ruled in its favor and ordered Paris to pay a
fine. No figure was ever mentioned, but Pakistani media have cited
figures ranging from $250 million to $400 million.

Deputy Coroner Chuck Smith said.
   Police said the mother became angry when the child did not

   Griffin and Johnson face life in prison if convicted. They were

   George Volak had to dodge communist bullets
when he escaped from Czechoslovakia to Austria. More than two
decades later, he drove all night to witness a moment he'd thought
could never happen: Vaclav Havel's speech Wednesday to Congress.
   ``I think he's a great man. I hope he runs for re-election,''
said Volak, of Murfreesboro, Tenn. He and his wife spent 11 hours
on the road without even knowing if they would be able to see Havel
once they got to Washington. Their risk paid off when Sen. Albert
Gore Jr., D-Tenn, was able to get them tickets.
   Havel, the shy playwright who moved from prison to
Czechoslovakia's presidential castle in a matter of months,
demonstrated to the Volaks and hundreds of others in the packed
House chamber why he has become his country's beacon of democracy
and hope.
   In a speech unusual for its modesty, metaphors and metaphysics,
Havel noted that he had barely two months' experience as president
and felt more comfortable in the realm of philosophy. But he went
on to advise America's highest office-holders how to do their jobs.
   ``We still don't know how to put morality ahead of politics,
science and economics,'' Havel told his audience of senators,
representatives, Cabinet members and diplomats. He urged them to
follow their consciences rather than act on behalf of ``my family,
my country, my firm, my success.''
   Havel, a small blond man dressed in a dark suit and blue-striped
tie, read his speech in Czech from a written text, eschewing the
TelePrompTers that American politicians favor for the best
television appearance.
   He flashed the victory sign during a long, vociferous welcome
and was interrupted two dozen times for cheers and ovations, most
often during his calls for peace, morality and a return to the
ideals of Lincoln and Jefferson.
   Some House traditions were broken for the occasion. Czechoslovak
officials accompanying Havel brandished cameras and tape recorders,
usually forbidden on the House floor. Czech-born film director
Milos Forman, now a U.S. citizen, sat with them wearing a red
turtleneck instead of the customary dress shirt and tie under his
sport jacket.
   Seated in the last row of the gallery was tennis star Martina
Navratilova, now a U.S. citizen. As soon as Havel spoke her native
language, she began wiping her eyes and nose with a handkerchief.
``I started crying right away,'' she said later. ``I wish I could
make speeches that good.''
   Havel, author of numerous plays and books, punctuated his
address with poetic images and metaphors. His country, he said, had
been ``pinned under a boulder'' by communism. He said
Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary were Europe's ``wayward
children.'' He called the world's governing systems ``anonymous
megamachinery.'' And democracy, he said, is like the horizon _
``one may approach it ... but it can never be fully attained.''
   Volak, 44, was among those who took to the streets during the
``Prague Spring'' of 1968 to protest the Soviet presence in his
country. He escaped to Austria soon after, moving to Canada and
then the United States.
   ``When I was crossing the border, they were shooting at me,'' he
recalled while waiting for Havel's speech to begin. Volak worked as
a construction architect and now owns a campground. He said he and
his wife visited Czechoslovakia in December, shortly after the
``velvet revolution'' that ended communist rule.
   ``I couldn't believe it, especially because it was so
peaceful,'' Volak said. ``I met President Havel at that time,
except at that time he was not president. He didn't even want to be
president.''

   A storekeeper foiled a holdup by four
brothers by shooting to death the driver of the getaway car, and
police later charged two of the alleged raiders, one aged 11, with
the murder of their brother.
   The fourth brother, identified as Ed Sid Scott, was still at
large and may have been wounded, police spokesman Sgt. Steve
Weintraub said Wednesday.
   Police arrested two suspects, Robert Scott, 23, and the
11-year-old whose name was withheld, and charged them with armed
robbery and the felony murder of their 18-year-old brother, Timothy.
   In Florida, if a participant is killed during the commission of
a crime, others involved in the crime can be charged with murder.
   The cashier at Little Annie's Food Store, Claudette Jones, told
police that a young man came into the store at about noon Tuesday,
looked around for a while and then left. She said she told her
sister-in-law, store owner Betty Jones, that the youth was acting
suspiciously, Weintraub said.
   A few minutes later, the youth and three others returned. One
pulled out a sawed-off shotgun, took the money out of the cash
register and the four fled, Weintraub said.
   Betty Jones grabbed a .45-caliber pistol and ran outside after
them. As they sped away in a car, she fired several shots, one of
which hit Timothy Scott, who was driving, Weintraub said.
   The car ran off the road and crashed into a house about a half
block from the store. Scott died en route to a hospital.
   Robert Scott and the 11-year-old were arrested about 30 minutes
later.

<HEAD>Critics Lambast Social Security's Toll-Free Phone System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee heard a chorus of
complaints Wednesday about Social Security's new toll-free
telephone network from critics who said it can take days to get
through to operators who sometimes give bad information.
   Members of Congress and congressional caseworkers told the House
Ways and Means subcommittee on Social Security that frustrated
constituents report they cannot get through on the toll-free
800-number and no longer can call their local Social Security
offices directly.
   ``It's time now for Social Security to say `We goofed up,'''
Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., told the subcommittee. ``This system is
nuts.''
   The telephone network _ reached by dialing 1-800-2345-SSA _ is
staffed from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. across the country, and allows
callers to take care of many matters without going into a Social
Security office. In most cities, the toll-free number is the only
Social Security number listed in the phone book.
   In January, traditionally a busy month, an estimated 52 percent
of calls to Social Security's 800 number were met with busy
signals, compared with 14 percent in December, 51 percent in
November and 30 percent in October, agency figures show. The
telephone network went nationwide last October.
   ``I applaud efforts by the Social Security Administration to
improve productivity, but these efforts must not come at the
expense of service to the public,'' said Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich.
``The data and anecdotal evidence ... indicate that the 800 number
was not a step forward.''
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., released a letter to Social Security
Commissioner Gwendolyn King in which he said the problems go deeper
than busy signals in that they reflect ``a distressing shift toward
a technological form of service delivery, to the detriment of
personal contact in the local community.''
   Geneva Leasner of Baltimore testified that her Supplemental
Security Income benefits were incorrectly cut off for three months
after a Social Security operator failed to properly advise her on
how to file a timely appeal.
   ``I had to borrow money from friends just to keep my house,''
she said.
   A college professor from Connecticut assigned her entire class
to call the toll-free number for two days straight and no one got
through, said Gerald Martin, a caseworker for Rep. Barbara
Kennelly, D-Conn.
   Several people in western North Dakota who could not get through
by phone became so frustrated that they drove more than 100 miles
to the nearest Social Security office to get answers, said Gregory
Rohde, an aide to Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.
   ``Constituents complain about numerous transfers, busy signals
and having to listen ad nauseam to a recording that a
representative will be available soon,'' Rohde testified.
   Mrs. King admitted that the system is ``a lot less than
perfect,'' but said the program is being improved. She maintainted
that, overall, it enhances Social Security's ability to serve the
public.
   ``With teleservice representatives answering incoming calls, our
field employees are able to devote greater, uninterrupted time and
attention to those who come through their office doors seeking
personal assistance,'' she said.
   The phone network was expected to handle about 250,000 calls a
day, but more than 1.5 million people try to get through on peak
days. She said operators now are instructed to provide the
telephone number for local field offices to people who ask for it.
   ``I am committed to an 800-number system that delivers
high-quality, courteous, person-to-person service as an option and
enhancement to the face-to-face service local offices have provided
for so many years,'' she said.

   President Bush will travel to New York and
California next week for a series of Republican political events,
the White House announced Wednesday.
   Bush will leave Feb. 28 for a Staten Island fund-raising dinner
to benefit the congressional campaign of Republican Susan Molinari.
He then will fly that evening to San Francisco to stump for Sen.
Pete Wilson, who is running for governor of California.
   He will spend the night in Los Angeles, where the following day
he will address a fund-raising event for the Republican Governors'
Association and a centennial gala for the California Chamber of
Commerce, said White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   On March 2, Bush travels to Palm Springs where he will spend the
weekend as a guest at the lavish estate of former publisher Walter
Annenberg.
   Bush has stayed previously with Annenberg, who is a close friend
of former President Reagan and hosts Reagan every New Year's Eve.
   Fitzwater said there are no plans for Reagan, who now lives in
Los Angeles, to join Bush during the Palm Springs weekend.

   NASA today delayed the launch of the
space shuttle Atlantis' secret military mission for at least 24
hours because of the commander's health and weather conditions.
   A brief statement said the commander, Navy Capt. John O.
Creighton, had ``developed an upper respiratory tract infection. In
addition, the launch weather is not predicted to be favorable.''
   NASA said it would decide Thursday whether to try the launch at
the Kennedy Space Center on Friday.
   The space agency said a cold front was expected to move through
the area tonight, bringing with it clouds, rain and high winds at
the expected early Thursday launch time.
   The weather forecast had improved during the day, with the odds
for launch increasing from 30 to 50 percent. But that was not
acceptable, and shuttle managers decided to call off the flight in
early afternoon before technicians began pumping half a million
gallons of propellant into Atlantis' fuel tank.
   Officials had been anxious to launch Atlantis on Thursday
because long-range forecasts call for even worse conditions Friday
and Saturday.
   Early today, a service structure which provides workers access
to the space shuttle as it sits on the launch pad was rotated away
from Atlantis and parked to one side.
   ``They wouldn't do that if they had a problem,'' said NASA
spokesman Bruce Buckingham.
   Atlantis astronauts took advantage of a slight break in the
weather today to fly practice landings in the space shuttle
training craft. They spent the rest of he morning in briefings and
went to bed at noon.
   The early bedtime for the five-member shuttle crew is designed
to shift their sleep cycle to the rest schedule they'll follow in
orbit.
   In addition to Creighton, Atlantis' crew includes the pilot, Air
Force Col. John H. Casper and mission specialists Marine Lt. Col.
David C. Hilmers, Air Force Col. Richard M. Mullane and Navy Lt.
Cmdr. Pierre J. Thuot.
   Because of Atlantis' classified military cargo, NASA officials
did not announce the precise launch time, saying only that it would
come between midnight and 4 a.m. Thursday.
   The mission is the sixth of 34 shuttle flights to be dedicated
to a classified, military cargo.
   Once Atlantis is in orbit, communications to the space shuttle
will be blacked out to the public until just an hour before the
craft returns to Earth. The flight is expected to last four days.
   According to sources, Atlantis' payload is a 37,300-pound, $500
million spy satellite known by the code name AFP-731.
   The device is said to be able to take high-resolution
reconnaissance photos and to listen in on military and diplomatic
communications around the world.
   Placed into a high inclination orbit, the spy satellite will
pass over most of the Soviet Union, including northern areas not
previously probed by shuttle-launched satellites. This orbit may be
important in verifying Soviet compliance with disarmament
agreements now being negotiated between the U.S. and the Soviet
Union.
   The Soviets have spy satellites of their own to assure U.S.
compliance.

   The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation on
Wednesday announced grants to 15 cities in a $27 million program
designed to fight demand for illegal drugs and alcohol.
   The foundation, based in Princeton, N.J., said the program is
the largest private effort ever to help local communities fight
drug and alcohol abuse.
   The communities selected will receive one- or two-year planning
grants of $100,000 per year, and eight of them will be selected for
five-year, $3 million grants to carry out their strategies, the
foundation said.
   The 15 cities are Charlotte, N.C.; Columbia, S.C.; Gallup, N.M.;
Kansas City, Mo.; Little Rock, Ark.; Milwaukee; Newark, N.J.; New
Haven, Conn.; Oakland, Calif.; San Antonio; San Jose, Calif.; Santa
Barbara, Calif.; Vallejo, Calif.; Washington and Worcester, Mass.

   Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos said
Wednesday he would continue supporting federally guaranteed loans
for students in private vocational and technical schools despite
their default rate of 37 percent.
   ``I want to make it clear that in no way does the Secretary of
Education advocate stepping away from support of guaranteed student
loan programs for proprietary schools,'' Cavazos told a Senate
Appropriations subcommittee.
   Cavazos added, however, that the administration was determined
to crack down on institutions with high rates of default.
   Proprietary schools are privately owned institutions which teach
trades such as electronics or auto repair.
   Overall, counting loans for regular college attendance, there
were 1.9 million defaults in the guaranteed student loan program
overall in 1989, and the projected number this year is 2 million.
   Cavazos affirmed that ``I am a very strong advocate of
vocational and technical education.'' He said ``we have excellent,
first-rate'' associate degree programs in junior colleges, and
``there are also some very fine proprietary schools.''
   Cavazos was testifying on President Bush's eductional budget
request of $25 billion, up more than $500 million from the 1990
budget. He noted the federal contribution is about 6 percent of the
nation's total expenditure of $353 billion for the current school
year.
   He stressed state and local responsibilities for funding
education, saying the federal role has evolved into one of guidance
and evaluation.
   ``We have successfully changed the focus of the national debate
on education from inputs to outputs, from resources to results,''
he said.
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said the federal financial share just a
decade ago was 9 percent, and complained that ``The
administration's rhetoric ignores the fact that the federal
government is the major player in many critical areas of
education.''
   Harkin, chairman of the education subcommittee, said
``Seventy-five percent of all the student aid available to college
students in this country is derived from the federal government,
and in the area of rehabilitation services, it closely approaches
100 percent.''
   Harkin and others criticized the budget proposal as well for
relying on unrealistically low projected interest costs for the
guaranteed loan program. ``Unfortunately, almost all of the new
initiatives are paid for by a dramatic reduction in guaranteed
student loan costs, which result from the administration's rosy
interest projections,'' Harkin said.
   Cavazos said the lower interest rates, combined with reductions
in lower priority programs, will provide $1.8 billion for programs.

<HEAD>C-17: Long on Cost, Short on Range</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military's transportation chief
acknowledged Wednesday that the Douglas C-17 transport plane has
soared $4 billion over budget while coming up 90 miles short of its
specified range of 2,400 miles.
   Gen. Hansford T. Johnson also told the Senate Armed Services
Committee that production of the 210 Air Force planes, now
estimated to cost $41 billion, is six months behind schedule, with
the first model now expected in June of next year.
   The Pentagon currently is reviewing whether to proceed with full
production in light of the lessening Soviet threat overseas and
budget constraints at home.
   The Bush administration, in its $292 billion defense budget for
fiscal 1991, is asking for six C-17 transport aircraft. Requests in
later years include 12 planes in fiscal 1992 and 25 the following
year.
   Members of the Senate panel, including its chairman, Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., and conservative Republican Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming,
expressed concerns about the plane's mounting cost and its range
limitations.
   ``I would like to see ... what can be done with the purchase of
off-the-shelf programs versus the amount of money that we might be
able to spend on other military programs,'' Wallop told Johnson.
   The commander said the military uses commercial airplanes for
carrying passengers and transporting cargo, but those planes and
the aging fleet of C-141s cannot do the job of the C-17.
   ``I understand that, but I'm saying that these airplanes ... are
already in production and they're not $37 billion away,'' Wallop
said.
   Johnson said the $4 billion increase was triggered by
modifications the Congress and Pentagon demanded in fiscal 1990,
stretchouts in the program, and inflation.
   The commander argued that the military is using ``all the
commercial (transport) we believe we can.''
   ``We need the C-17 for three reasons at least,'' Johnson said.
``One, is the overall capacity. Two, ... we need a vehicle to
deliver forward from the battle area. Third, ... the C-141 is
becoming a very tired aircraft.''
   The current fleet includes 234 C-141 aircraft, which are about
25 years old, or three times as old as most commercial jets,
Johnson said.
   That comment prompted Nunn to note that life of a plane is
determined by its flying hours, not its age.
   On the range issue, Nunn noted that Pentagon specifications call
for the C-17 to carry 167,000 pounds a distance of 2,400 nautical
miles, but the Air Force and the contractor, Douglas Co., agree
that the plane cannot fly from Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to
the Azores, a major refueling base in the mid-Atlantic, a flight
which is exactly that distance.
   ``It seems to me that's a serious problem,'' the senator said.
   Johnson conceded that the Pentagon added new, heavier equipment
on the aircraft and if the Air Force used a typical type of fuel,
the plane would come up 78 nautical miles short, or 90 statute
miles.
   But the commander said if a new, higher-energy fuel is used, the
Air Force would go back to its original specifications.
   ``You're saying you had unrealistic specifications then,'' Nunn
said.
   ``No sir,'' Johnson answered.
   ``What's the purpose of the specifications if you don't intend
to meet the specifications?'' Nunn interrupted. ``You're basically
saying the specifications weren't needed, you overspecified.''
   Johnson said the specifications were part of the contract
between the Douglas Co., which is assembling the plane in Long
Beach, Calif., and the government, and if the contractor fails to
meet the arrangement, it will cost them financially.
   The commander also argued that the problems exist only on paper
since the first plane won't be ready until June 1991, six months
after the target date.
   ``We're confident that we can manage that weight to give us the
specifications, to meet the specifications, but right now, you're
correct, they're 78 (nautical) miles short,'' Johnson said.

   A team of three Ukrainian-Americans plans to
monitor the fairness of the March 4 election in the Ukraine on
behalf a politically conservative U.S. foundation, it was announced
Wednesday.
   ``Our aim is to determine whether you could call this a free and
fair election,'' said Askold Lozynsky, a New York attorney, who
will be accompanied by his wife, Ronya, and Borys Potapenko of the
Ukrainian Cultural Center in Detroit.
   Lozynsky said the group will form a moniotoring network, mostly
in the cities of Kiev and Ldiv, and will distribute a survey to
some 40 opposition candidates, political organizers and voters to
form at least a limited basis for evaluating the election process.
   The group's efforts are sponsored by the Free Congress
Foundation whose president, Paul Weyrich, has been involved in
offering campaign training to Soviet political opposition leaders.
   Lozynsky said his monitoring team proceeds with an admitted bias.
   ``We are not pro-Soviet,'' he said. ``We are anti-Soviet and
anti-communist. We support democracy.''
   Other international observers are attempting to monitor
elections in the Ukraine and throughout the Soviet Union, but
Weyrich said some are experiencing difficulty in obtaining visas.

   The State Department said Wednesday that
Nicaraguan authorities have been routinely threatening opposition
party activists as part of a campaign to influence national
elections set for this Sunday.
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said that UNO
sympathizers have told the U.S. Embassy in Managua that security
agents of the leftist government have threatened them with ``loss
of job or land, bodily harm or even death.''
   The embassy has been told that supporters of opposition
candidate Violeta Chamorro who are members of the armed forces have
had their voter registration cards confiscated. According to one
deserter, 100 soldiers in his unit were ordered to turn in their
cards because of questions about their political reliability, Ms.
Tutwiler said.
   Ms. Tutwiler said opposition poll watchers in the Boaco area and
in other regions ``have been threatened not to show up on election
day. As the international observers have emphasized, poll watcher
presence is a critical aspect of a free and fair election,'' she
said.
   Ms. Chamorro, who is receiving financial backing from the U.S.
government, is challenging President Daniel Ortega in Sunday's
election.

<HEAD>Homeless Man Claims He Had to Break Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A homeless man who said he broke into an
abandoned apartment house to escape bitter cold pleaded innocent to
trespassing Wednesday on grounds that he was justified in breaking
the law.
   The defendant, who gave his name as Benjamin Franklin Pierce,
44, was arrested in 7-degree weather Dec. 27.
   The justification defense maintains that a person may break the
law to prevent worse consequences.
   Pierce could get up to 90 days in jail if convicted.
   City Judge Roy Tepper said he will hear pre-trial motions March
22.
   ``It's the first time we know of that a homeless person claims
he was legally justified to break the law in order to seek shelter
in a life-threatening situation,'' said Douglas Colbert, a Hofstra
University law professor helping in Pierce's defense.
   Pierce broke into a building that had been vacant for two years
to save himself from freezing, Colbert said. ``Any reasonably
educated person would have done the same thing,'' he said.
   Colbert said Long Beach provides neither shelter nor
transportation to shelter for its homeless.
   Pierce, a Vietnam veteran, has worked mainly as a painter and
has been homeless for a couple of years since losing his apartment
to gentrification, Colbert said.

   Israeli officials said Wednesday that a U.S.
report alleging human rights violations in the occupied lands was
unfair because it did not take into account the violence
authorities face from Palestinians.
   Col. Renaan Gissin, the army's deputy spokesman, said any human
rights abuses were in response to violent incidents related to the
26-month-old Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``I agree that in the process of this excruciating struggle,
there may be violations of human rights. I disagree that there is
an intentional policy of violating human rights in the territories
or elsewhere,'' Gissin said.
   Moshe Raviv, the Foreign Ministry's deputy director general for
information, said, ``I believe Israel is receiving criticism
without people understanding that our policy is a reactive policy,
reactive to violence.''
   ``The criticism in the report emanated from the necessary steps
that the Israeli Defense Forces must undertake in order to react to
terror and violence'' he told a briefing on the annual U.S. State
Department report on human rights.
   The report, released Wednesday in Washington, expressed ``deep
concern'' about the human rights situation in the occupied
territories. It said Israeli soldiers often did not follow rules
intended to protect lives and that many unjust killings by soldiers
went unpunished.
   The report noted that new rules allow soldiers to shoot directly
at fleeing masked men, even if they are unarmed, after a warning
shot has been fired in the air. Earlier, soldiers could fire only
if their lives were in danger or at a felony suspect.
   Raviv said Israel ``has no problem in principle ... with the
reliability of the report,'' but at another point he said ``the
report has been inundated by false claims, false reports that
sometimes cannot be verified.''
   Gissin said the Israeli army itself has trouble verifying facts
on the weekly average of 250 violent incidents in the occupied
territories.
   He denied the report's allegations that 10 Palestinians died of
beatings in custody or while soldiers searched their homes. Gissin
said the figure was four, including two who died in custody.
   According to an Associated Press count, Israeli soldiers or
civilians have killed 658 Palestinians since the uprising began in
December 1987.
   The reference to the beating deaths was in a section of the U.S.
report quoting allegations of torture. Gissin said in response:
``There is no policy of torture.''
   The State Department repeated past U.S. criticisms on the
demolition and sealing of homes of Palestinians suspected of being
active in the uprising.
   Soldiers have destroyed 268 Palestinian homes and sealed 147
others during the uprising, according to the army.
   Two more homes were sealed Wednesday, the army announced. Both
were in the West Bank city of Nablus, and the residents were jailed
on suspicion of distributing uprising leaflets and taking part in
violent attacks on alleged collaborators, the army said.
   Arab reporters said a total of 13 people lived in the two homes.

   President Bush wrote British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher a ``positive'' letter discussing negotiations
between the South African government and the nation's black
majority, but did not discuss her decision to lift sanctions
against South Africa, the White House said Wednesday.
   Britain has announced it will lift its ban on British investment
in South Africa and end its attempts to discourage Britons from
traveling there.
   Bush, while indicating he is willing to review the U.S.
sanctions in light of positive moves by the white minority
government of South African President F.W. de Klerk, has proposed
no change in the sanctions.
   On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, House Democrats indicated they would
press ahead with move to tighten the sanctions.
   Bush's letter last week to Thatcher spoke approvingly of de
Klerk's leadership and said the South African government was
serious about negotiations with blacks, White House Press Secretary
Marlin Fitzwater told reporters.
   Bush wrote of steps he has taken in hopes of ending racial
violence in South Africa, such as telephoning de Klerk and recently
released political prisoner Nelson Mandela, leader of the African
National Congress.
   ``At the same time, the president took the opportunity to state
that the actions of the South African government do not yet fulfill
the conditions required by U.S. law to remove sanctions,''
Fitzwater said.
   Under the sanctions imposed by Congress in 1986, South Africa
would have to fulfill several conditions before the United States
would lift the sanctions. Among the conditions are the freeing of
all political prisoners and the beginning of good-faith
negotiations between the government and blacks.
   ``The president reiterated that once the criteria set by U.S.
law has been met, he will consult with the Congress,'' on whether
to remove the sanctions, Fitzwater said.
   Asked whether Bush had encouraged the Thatcher government's
decision to end British sanctions, Fitzwater said of Bush's letter:
   ``The president's response was positive in the sense of
encouraging a move toward negotiations in South Africa and taking
those general steps that could be helpful. He did not comment on
any individual actions in that process.''
   Asked specifically if Bush in his letter approved of Britain's
lifting of the ban on new investments, Fitzwater replied that Bush
``was positive on the overall encouragement of progress in South
Africa.''
   Britain has been criticized by its European Community allies for
its unilateral decision to ease sanctions against the Pretoria
government.
   The EC contends that de Klerk's freeing of Mandela and lifting
of a ban on political opposition groups do not go far enough to
warrant lifting sanctions.
   On Capitol Hill, Walter Fauntroy, the non-voting Democratic
delegate from the District of Columbia, said there is no guarantee
that de Klerk will ``bite the bullet'' and make fundamental changes
``unless pressure is maintained and intensified.''
   Fauntroy, chairman of a House Banking subcommittee, is pushing
for the adoption of a measure to prevent banks from rescheduling $8
billion in debt held by American banks.
   Anti-apartheid activists in Congress are upset that banks have
allowed South Africa to stretch out some of its debt repayment
until 1993. The repayment is on loans made before 1985.
   Rodney Wagner of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. in New York told a
joint hearing of the Banking subcommittee and a Foreign Affairs
subcommittee that banks oppose apartheid.
   But he said the proposed legislation is economically unfeasible
because South Africa doesn't have the money to repay 20 percent of
its principle each year.

   A team of divers with an underwater
video camera slipped into icy Convict Lake today to retrieve the
bodies of six of seven people who died in the frigid waters.
   The camera immediately located two bodies on the lake bottom at
a depth of 117 feet, said Mono County sheriff's Lt. Terry Padilla.
Divers were preparing to bring them to the surface.
   The body of U.S. Forest Service ranger Clayton Cutter, 31, was
recovered on Tuesday. But the bodies of three teens from a nearby
camp for young offenders who fell through the ice and three of the
adults who tried to rescue them were still missing in the lake,
authorities said.
   The six-member Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department deep-sea
diving team joined other divers today, said sheriff's spokeswoman
Gail Merritt.
   ``We've got state-of-the-art stuff up here now. We're sure we
will find them all now,'' she said. It was sunny, but 20 degrees
when the search resumed.
   The Los Angeles dive team, wearing iron helmets and outfitted
with surface air equipment that allows them to go deeper and stay
down for up to 30 minutes, was also equipped with a camera to
search the lake bottom.
   Cutter fell into the water as he tried to aid the victims, who
were bobbing and thrashing in holes broken in the ice.
   ``Just watching those heads bobbing up and down was too much,''
said Chris Baitx, 31, chief of the Long Valley volunteer fire
department. ``We figured we should have waited for the rescue team.
But when people are bobbing up and down, you know what's next.''
   The recovery could be hampered because the extreme cold may
force the bodies to the bottom of the lake, which is 140 feet deep
at its deepest point, said Mono County Sheriff-Coroner M.A.
Strelneck Jr.
   Twelve teen-agers and two adults from Camp O'Neal, a residential
facility for troubled youths, had been on a holiday outing Monday
when four youths fell through the ice. Four adults _ including two
camp counselors _ perished as they attempted to rescue the others.
   For those watching from the shore, horror turned to hysteria as
the tragedy was compounded again and again.
   ``It was a bad scene and it just kept getting worse,'' Baitx
said.
   Baitx also slipped beneath the splintering sheets of ice while
attempting to rescue the victims, but he was pulled to safety. He
was hospitalized overnight.
   ``I had to beat the ice out with my hands,'' Baitx said. ``I was
sure I was gone. I was thinking of my wife and kids and are they
going to be OK, because I'm history.''
   The still-missing adults included the two camp counselors, Dave
Meyers, 53, and Randy Porter, age unknown, and Vidar Anderson, 58,
a volunteer firefighter. David Christopher Sellers and Shawn Rayne
Diaz, both 15, and Ryan Charles McCandless, 13, were among the
missing.
   Two other youths fell into the water, but survived: a
15-year-old boy who was treated for hypothermia at Centinela
Mammoth Hospital and released and a teen-ager who clambered out of
the water on his own and didn't require treatment.
   A paramedic plunged through the ice when he tried to reach the
teen-agers and went down three times before a diver pulled him out.
He was hospitalized overnight.
   The eastern Sierra Nevada ski resort community of 5,000
residents, about 250 miles north of Los Angeles, was stunned by the
tragedy.
   ``We are a close-knit community and this accident touched
everyone. ... Any kind of tragedy like this has a tremendous effect
on our town,'' said Town Manager Paul Marangella.
   The privately operated probation camp is for young people
convicted of relatively minor offenses.
   Convict Lake, just south of the Mammoth ski resort, got its name
from a shootout between a posse and convicts in the late 1800s.

   The idled Rocky Flats weapons plant in
Colorado, the sole supplier of plutonium triggers for U.S. nuclear
warheads, is unlikely to resume full production until at least
July, a senior Energy Department official said Wednesday.
   The plant, situated about 16 miles northwest of Denver, was
closed indefinitely late last year for safety and management
improvements.
   Production of plutonium triggers is vital to maintaining the
nuclear weapons stockpile. Neither the Energy Department nor the
Pentagon has said how long Rocky Flats could remain out of service
before the arms stockpile would be jeopardized. The plant was
closed for a few months in 1988 after a worker was contaminated by
radioactivity.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins had said shortly after the
latest shutdown that he hoped Rocky Flats would resume production
by February, but the contractor that runs the facility says it
needs more time to install new safety procedures and retrain
workers.
   Adm. J.M. Barr, the deputy assistant energy secretary for
military application, said Wednesday that one of the key plutonium
processing facilities, known as Building 771, could be ready to
resume operation by the end of June.
   Barr, speaking to a reporter during a break in a meeting with an
Energy Department advisory committee, said current plans called for
the full resumption of Rocky Flats production sometime between July
and September. He stressed that this was a preliminary target that
was subject to revision.
   Barr told the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Facility Safety,
which is monitoring progress toward resuming operations, that he
would have a more specific target date ``very early in April.''
   ``We're afraid anything we would give you now would be wrong,''
he said.
   Barr stressed that the final decision to resume production
rested with Watkins, who in recent weeks has pledged to subject the
plant overhaul to a full review by independent observers.
   Rocky Flats has been plagued by a variety of operating and
waste-handling problems in recent years. Last June the FBI raided
the facility in search of evidence of criminal violations of laws
governing the handling of radioactive wastes.
   Rockwell International Corp. quit as Rocky Flats' operator last
September in a dispute with Watkins over legal liability for
environmental violations.
   EG&amp;G, a longtime weapons industry contractor based in Wellesley,
Mass., officially took over Rocky Flats on Jan. 1, but has been
working there since September.
   Barr told the advisory committee that the top objective of
EG&amp;G's overhaul of operations is to improve the ``margin of
safety.'' He stressed, however, there was no imminent danger to the
public from Rocky Flats operations last fall.
   Dave Van Leuven, EG&amp;G's associate general manager for defense
production at the facility, outlined for the committee the tasks to
be completed before production resumes.
   He said, for example, that more than 1,000 engineering drawings
of safety systems would be checked for accuracy. About 150 of the
drawings have been checked so far, he said, and 14 were found to
contain significant errors. He said it would take another eight
weeks to check the rest.
   Van Leuven said the technical competence of about 1,500 plant
operators would be verified before production is resumed. He did
not say how many already have been tested but the failure rate so
far was about 30 percent.

   Jaguar Cars Inc. is recalling more than
70,000 cars for braking and cruise-control system defects.
   The automaker said Tuesday it was recalling 38,315 1988 and 1989
Jaguar sedans, including the XJ6, Vanden Plas and Majestic, because
of a brake-system defect.
   Jaguar said high pressure hoses that supply fluid to the power
assist system could rupture, causing a loss of fluid. The escaped
fluid could lead to engine fire, smoke under the hood or loss of
braking power.
   The company also said hydraulic fluid may leak from the brake
system, which could damage electrical wiring or cause the power
assist system in the brakes to fail to recharge.
   If both mishaps occurred, the driver could lose the car's power
braking feature but still could stop the car without the power
system, Jaguar said.
   Jaguar said it also is recalling 31,835 1979-model XJ12 sedans
and 1982 to 1990 model Jaguar XJ-S vehicles because of improper
functioning of the cruise-control system. The cruise control could
fail to disengage normally, Jaguar said.
   These owners are being advised to avoid using the cruise-control
system until their cars are fixed.
   Jaguar owners affected by the recalls are being alerted by mail
to make appointments with their dealers to have the repairs done
for free.

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp., which some
analysts say has a stodgy, unbending personality, is offering some
employees the chance to quack like a duck and jump from a pole to
ring a little bell.
   The voluntary training program, designed to encourage teamwork
among employees, is running this week and next for workers in the
company's international export sales unit. It isn't sitting too
well with some.
   ``When adults are working and trying to earn a living, they
belong in an office,'' said a 53-year-old employee who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``They shouldn't be in some survival course
yelling, `Quack, quack.'''
   A second group of employees was proceeding through the 2{-day
course Wednesday. The first group began Sunday, and the final group
will run through the program next week, GM spokesman Mark Rollinson
said.
   He said about 175 people are eligible to participate, and groups
range from 25 to 40 workers. The program is operated by Pecos River
Learning Centers Inc. of Santa Fe, N.M.
   ``The point is to get you out of your comfort zone,'' said
Danlee Winegar, the company's director of marketing communication.
   At the beginning of the teamwork-building training, participants
are asked to quack and ride stick horses around a room.
   ``These fun types of things loosen people up.'' Winegar said.
``It can break down barriers to be goofy, to feel OK about doing
stupid things in front of the others.''
   The whole thing can be stupid, not to mention dangerous, said
William Dwyer, a 49-year-old GM employee.
   ``A lot of people, including myself, think they could get hurt
in the process,'' he said. ``Personally, I don't think I'm in shape
to do it.''
   Among the tasks participants perform are jumping off an 8-foot
wall to be caught by co-workers and climbing a ladder beside a
pole, standing on a wobbly disc and jumping off to ring a small
bell.
   ``We do run into the fear factor, but it's all in your head,''
Winegar said. ``On the pole, you're held up by a harness that keeps
you from falling more than a few inches.''
   GM spokeswoman Patricia Molloy and Dale Hermiller, a manager of
the export sales unit, stressed that all parts of the program are
voluntary.
   Detroit lawyer V. Paul Donnelly said about a dozen workers have
told him they were worried about the training.
   ``I can't advise them whether to attend or not,'' he said, ``but
they may be at risk if they go without legal representation.''

   Worries over chemical contamination forced a recall
of up to 2 million bottles of mineral water Wednesday, while
authorities warned 160,000 people in central and eastern France not
to consume polluted tap water.
   The moves came as a dispute began between environment and
agriculture officials over widespread pollution of drinking water
due to drought, heavy use of nitrate-based fertilizers and recent
floods.
   The Societe Generale des Eaux Minerales de Vittel announced it
would withdraw from sale an estimated 1 million to 2 million
bottles of Hepar mineral water to allay consumer worries some might
be contaminated with traces of hydrocarbons of the alkane type.
   The underground springwater is distributed and consumed almost
exclusively in France, Director Alain Dorfner told The Associated
Press. The company also produces the popular Vittel water for
domestic and foreign consumption.
   Supplies of Hepar were contaminated Jan. 10-11 when water
sitting in a tank awaiting bottling came into contact with a filter
exposed to air polluted with alkane, Dorfner said.
   Alkanes are a class of hydocarbon compounds, including methane
or ethane. They occur naturally in some types of petroleum.
   The water was bottled and shipped to points in France in
January, Dorfner said, and later quietly withdrawn from sale after
the company discovered the contamination.
   But the global recall of Perrier water after a U.S. laboratory
found traces of benzene in some samples put the spotlight on Hepar,
casting doubts on the water's purity.
   ``The water now on the shelves is pure, but we want to avoid
confusion in people's minds,'' Dorfner said. ``New bottles will be
on the shelves in 15 days.''
   Dorfner said he could not estimate the cost of the operation.
Hepar represents $21 million of Vittel's annual profits of $316
million, Dorfner said.
   In the eastern city of Belfort, meanwhile, health authorities
warned citizens to either drink bottled water or to add chlorine to
their drinking water after bacteria was found in taps Wednesday.
   About 100,000 residents cleared shop shelves of chlorine and
bottled water to last for a week _ the amount of time authorities
estimate it will take to clean the city's water system.
   Tests are still being run on the bacteria, which entered the
region's wells and reservoirs during last week's flooding in parts
of France, authorities said. The bacteria causes stomach problems
but is not life-endangering.
   A similar infestation struck over the weekend at Chateauroux and
Delos in central France, where 60,000 people remained on bottled
water Wednesday as health officials ran tests on the bacteria.
   Concern over France's water supply entered the political arena
Tuesday when Secretary of the State for the Environment Brice
Lalonde criticized farmers for dumping nitrate-based fertilizers
onto the soil that eventually wash into water systems.
   Lalonde estimated 800,000 people regularly drink water above
safe nitrate levels and called agriculture ``a black point'' in
environmental protection.
   High levels of nitrates are particularly bad in Britanny, parts
of northern France and Alsace, the daily newspaper Liberation
reported. Serious drought last summer compounded the problem,
Liberation said, as farmers dug irrigation ditches and diverted
streams to water their fields, disrupting the environment.
   Agricultural representatives said Lalonde's remarks were
off-base but admitted the drought prevented fertilizer from being
absorbed properly by the soil.
   The agriculture and environment ministries promised Wednesday to
work together with the 12-nation European Community to solve the
problem of nitrate pollution.
   Elsewhere, the president of the private water company Lyonnaise
des Eaux, Jerome Monod, estimated that only 40 percent of the
pollutants in urban tap water are cleared out by filtration plants.
   In an interview with the newspaper France-Soire, Monod said the
price of tap water could double in the next 10 years if French
consumers decide to make the investment to clean up their water.
   ``This price will still be minimal if we compare it to mineral
water, which today costs 500 times as much as tap water,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's two-week tour of
the Pacific Rim was barely a day old when Philippine President
Corazon Aquino declared she wouldn't receive him during his visit
to Manila.
   The snub was striking in light of the crucial air cover the U.S.
Air Force had provided in December to help her survive a coup
attempt.
   But Cheney reacted with characteristic equanimity: he fell
asleep.
   On the balmy Sunday the spat became front-page headline news in
Honolulu, the defense secretary declined to talk with reporters
about Mrs. Aquino. Instead, he sought some peace and quiet at a
friend's home, and promptly dozed off while lounging on the lawn,
associates said.
   He woke up when a light rain started to fall, so he went inside
_ and fell asleep again. Cheney's wife Lynne woke him up hours
later when it was time to go back to the hotel for dinner _ and
when he got there, he fell asleep again.
   In an appearance before a military support group later in his
visit, Cheney joked about the slight, telling his audience his
lengthy introduction lacked one title _ being Corazon Aquino's
``favorite defense secretary.''
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Cheney's visit to the hills above Honolulu brought to mind
Shakespeare's Macbeth:
   ``Macbeth shall never vanquished be
   ``Until Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane Hill shall come
against him.''
   Such tactics ultimately fooled Macbeth, and the defense
secretary learned first-hand they've become part of the Army's 25th
Infantry Division's commando training in Hawaii.
   As Cheney was escorted into the lush forests to meet the young
soldier-trainees, there was no one to greet him.
   That is, until the shrubbery started to shake and crawl his way.
   Up from the ground arose about two dozen camouflaged soldiers
with twigs, leaves, ferns and assorted lush greenery tied to their
shoulders and backpacks, their faces covered in green, black and
brown makeup.
   Cheney clearly was taken by the scene, and eager to speak with
the young warriors.
   That is, until a two-star general sat down next to him on a tree
stump to explain their training _ supplemented by an over-eager
officer with a plastic coated flip-chart.
   Cheney finally did get a chance to talk with the
greenery-attired young men who'd waited patiently for their general
to finish his lecture.
   The picture of the scene was later dubbed, ``Cheney Talks to the
Trees.''

   Cheney's arrival at the airport in Seoul got a fair amount of
attention from the South Korean press corps, given that the issues
he wanted to discuss _ U.S. troop cuts and increased Korean
contributions to their support _ are hot topics.
   As Cheney took the microphone to offer his thanks for being
received in Seoul, a South Korean anchorman stood nearby and began
to boom out a report on camera, drowning out the secretary's
remarks.
   Cheney plodded on, and so did the television reporter.
   Eyebrows were raised.
   The official South Korean delegation stared blankly forward,
acting as if nothing were happening.
   Both men continued, their Korean and English commentary tangled
in a jumbled mess.
   Finally, the wife of an American diplomat in the greeting party
elbowed a Korean aide, who in turn waited politely for the
anchorman to draw a breath before he tugged at his arm and silenced
the journalist.

<TEXT>
   A judge Wednesday gave the United Mine
Workers 10 more days to find a way to persuade him to drop or
reduce $64 million in fines against the union for its tactics
during the Pittston Coal Group strike.
   Circuit Judge Donald McGlothlin had set a Thursday deadline for
the UMW and Pittston to return to court after he rejected their
joint request Feb. 12 to drop the fines.
   McGlothlin last week called the union's offer of 10,000 hours of
community service ``an affront to this court'' because it would
amount to about five hours of work for each striker.
   Union officials said they needed time to develop a new proposal
because they were tied up arranging for about 2,000 Pittston
employees and laid-off workers in Virginia, West Virginia and
Kentucky to vote on a contract they ratified Monday. The
ratification ended the nearly 11-month strike.
   ``The whole ratification process created a big burden of work,
and we had to deal with that,'' UMW spokesman Gene Carroll said.
   UMW Vice President Cecil Roberts said he hoped the judge would
soften his position now that the miners have agreed to go back to
work. But he said he did not know what union attorney swould
propose to get the fines waived or reduced.
   The union originally planned to hold up a vote on the contract
until the legal action was disposed of. But during the hearing
before McGlothlin last week, he lectured the union on trying to use
judges as ``bargaining chips.''
   ``It was clear the judge was not going to be pressured,''
Roberts said.
   The fines were imposed for violations of judges' orders limiting
picket line activity and prohibiting the disruption of Pittston's
operations. About half of the fines were for violence aimed at
company personnel and property.
   McGlothlin also fined the union $5 million for taking over
Pittston's main coal processing plant in September for four days
and several million dollars for using sit-down demonstrations and
big bumper-to-bumper convoys of cars and trucks to block coal truck
traffic.

<TEXT>
   A movement to restore political pluralism
has gripped this Himalayan kingdom, pitting its Harvard-educated
monarch against two banned political parties inspired by the
changes sweeping Eastern Europe.
   Clashes between police and demonstrators who demand an end to a
29-year-old ban on political parties have killed at least 11 people
this week in usually tranquil Nepal, where crime is rare and
murders make front-page news.
   Activists claim the government has arrested more than 1,000
people in its crackdown on the movement for restoration of
multiparty democracy. The government says 175 people have been
arrested since the campaign was launched Sunday _ for the third
time in 11 years.
   ``I think this time the government is shaken,'' said a Western
diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``They have realized
that bullets and tough talk won't make the problem disappear.''
   Leading the agitation are the banned coalition of left-wing
parties and the Nepali Congress Party, which governed Nepal during
its only two years in history as a Western-style democracy.
   ``For the last 29 years we have faced atrocities,'' said Hari
Bol Bhattarai, a senior member of the Congress Party who has evaded
arrest. ``It's time to get rid of the system, bring in a fresh
system.''
   Bhattarai, who spoke in a telephone interview from an
undisclosed location, said the movement would continue until the
government gave in. ``We have waited enough. Now we won't give up
until our demands are fulfilled.''
   Nepal has witnessed startling political events since the Shah
dynasty began its rule in the mid-18th century. After almost a
century on the throne, the Shahs were reduced to titular heads by
the Ranas, who established a parallel line of hereditary prime
ministers.
   In 1951, King Tribhuvan of the Shah dynasty and the Nepali
Congress Party overthrew the Rana prime minister and established a
democratic constitution under which the monarch and an elected
government were to share power.
   The country's first general elections were not held until eight
years later, as Tribhuvan and later his son, King Mahendra,
appeared loath to accept the role of a semi-titular head of state.
   The Congress Party was voted to power in 1959, but Mahendra
dismissed its government two years later and banned all political
parties, accusing them of corruption and misleading the nation.
   That ban still stands, despite agitations and violence in 1979
and 1985. The 1979 movement led to a historic national referendum
the next year, in which the people narrowly voted to retain Nepal's
non-partisan Rashtriya Panchayat, or national assembly.
   Analysts say one reason the people voted for a partyless
democracy was the assurance by King Birendra, Mahendra's son, of
greater political freedom and genuine representation in the
assembly.
   ``We thought we would have it good either way,'' said Debendra
Raj Panday, a political commentator. ``But we remained where we
were. The palace still runs everything in this country.
   ``The legislators are voted with the government's support. In
effect, the prime minister is chosen by the king,'' he said.
   The government says the 1980 referendum remains valid and the
will of the people will not be changed.
   ``Nepal follows the middle path,'' chief government spokesman
Radhey Shyam Bista said. ``We rejected the one-party system of our
northern neighbor, China, and the multiparty system of our southern
neighbor, India.''
   ``For us the monarchy is the only institution. Democracy can
only grow with the cooperation of the monarch,'' he said. He
credited 44-year-old Birendra, a graduate in political science from
Harvard University, with ushering in ``remarkable progress'' in
Nepal, a mountainous kingdom of 18 million people and one of the
poorest countries in the world.
   According to government figures, life expectancy has risen from
38 years in 1960 to 47 at present. About 70,000 Nepalese receive a
university education.
   Still, half the population lives in poverty, with a per capita
annual income of $150, and more than 70 percent of the population
has no safe drinking water.
   ``I trace all economic problems to the political process,''
Panday said. ``It's a feudal economy and there are little fiefdoms
everywhere with no regard to the people's needs.''
   Economic problems apart, the demonstrators' tone appears to be
getting more strident, and they have increasingly aimed criticism
at the king, which is a punishable offense.
   ``Our king is trying to kill democracy,'' said Rishikesh Shaha,
a former foreign minister, who fell out with the palace and left
for India on Feb. 7, saying he feared he would be arrested.
   ``He is trying to put the clock back ... at a time when around
the world the voice of freedom, the voice of democracy is getting
stronger and stronger,'' Shaha said in an interview in the Indian
capital, New Delhi.
   ``You just can't talk about him. You are required to worship
him. But the pro-democracy movement has gone very deep down into
the hearts of the people,'' Shaha said.
   ``There is no question of turning back.''

<HEAD>Soviet Scientists Invite Swedes to Study Chernobyl Damage</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sweden will send radiation experts to a
badly contaminated area in the Soviet Union to study the effects of
the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident, Soviet scientists
said Wednesday.
   The agreement was announced at the end of three days of talks by
Soviet, Finnish, Swedish and Norwegian officials on international
cooperation in the event of nuclear accidents.
   Pavel Ramzaev of the Institute of Radiation Hygiene in Leningrad
said the Soviets hoped to gain a broader view of contamination
problems.
   ``Our vast material and data from the affected areas is only a
first step toward knowledge about the effects of the accident,''
Ramzaev said, adding that the Soviets were seeking ``new ways of
thinking.''
   A Swedish team will go this summer to an area in the Russian
republic several hundred miles northeast of Chernobyl, where
radiation levels were far higher than expected.
   ``We have a lot to learn about the medical effects on human
life, and how to measure and decontaminate agriculture land and the
environment in general,'' said Jan Olof Snihs, of Sweden's National
Institute of Radiation Protection.
   The Soviets said a conference in Vienna starting Friday will
discuss the organization of an international research institute to
be established at Chernobyl.
   The April 26, 1986, explosion at the No. 4 reactor of the
four-unit nuclear power plant in the Soviet Ukraine was the world's
worst atomic accident.
   The accident sent a cloud of radiation over large parts of
northern and central Europe, leading to bans on foodstuffs from
several countries. The plant is 80 miles north of the Ukraine
capital of Kiev.
   Two workers died immediately of burns they suffered in the
explosion, 28 died shortly after the accident from radiation
exposure, and one died of a heart attack while fighting the fire.
By 1989, officials said more than 250 people who had worked at the
polant or who were involved in the post-accident cleanup had died
of various causes, not all of them necessarily traceable to
radiation exposure.

<TEXT>
   Markus Wolf, the retired chief spy
of East Germany, has taken refuge in the Soviet Union to avoid
possible arrest at home in an arms export scandal, a West German
newspaper reported Wednesday.
   He lived in the Soviet Union for many years and once called it
his ``second homeland.'' Wolf is believed to have had close ties to
the KGB secret police.
   The Sueddeutsche Zeitung said East German prosecutors believe
Wolf was involved in the illegal arms operation and may even have
directed it.
   East German authorities have said the the exports were handled
by Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski, chief foreign trader for the
ousted Communist government.
   He fled to West Berlin when the operation was discovered in
December and spent several days in jail, but a judge said there
were no grounds in West Germany for holding Schalck-Golodkowski and
released him in January.
   Wolf retired in February 1987 from the State Security Ministry,
where he was in charge of the espionage section and directed such
agents as Guenter Guillaume, whose unmasking led to the resignation
of Willy Brandt as West German chancellor. Guillaume had been one
of Brandt's closest aides.
   The Sueddeutsche Zeitung said Wolf was living with his
half-sister in a villa near Moscow and writing a book on East
Germany politics of recent years.
   In its report, made available to other news media before
publication Thursday, the paper said he had offers for the book
from two West German publishers.
   East German TV carried the Sueddeutsche Zeitung report without
comment.
   The former spy turned to writing after retirement. In the
turmoil that brought down old guard Communist Party chief Erich
Honecker in October, he supported the type of political and
economic reforms championed by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet
president.
   Wolf's father, Friedrich, was a prominent author and physician
with Communist convictions. He fled when the Nazis came to power in
1933 and took his family to Moscow, where his son attended
Communist Party schools.
   When the younger Wolf arrived in the Soviet sector of occupied
Germany in 1945, he worked as a radio journalist.
   Later, Wolf returned to Moscow as an East German diplomat. He
described the family's life in Moscow during Stalin's rule in a
book published after his retirement.
   Wolf joined the State Security Ministry in 1951, became
espionage chief in 1957 and retired with the rank of general.
   His career was said to have inspired spy novelist John Le
Carre's character Karla, a fictional Soviet spymaster who finally
is forced to defect to the West by an elaborate plot devised by
British agent George Smiley.
   After decades of virtual invisibility, Wolf spoke at rallies in
the early days of East Germany's revolution and appeared in several
discussions on East and West German TV.
   There is an arrest warrant out for him in West Germany because
of his espionage activities.

   Genetic experiments with ordinary pond scum
show it may be an automatic dispenser of fertilizer in rice fields,
the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   But the department's Agricultural Research Service said it may
be another 15 years before rice growers are able to use the pond
scum, or blue-green algae, as a fertilizer source.
   If the procedure can be developed, the natural fertilizer
dispensed by the special algae could have a significant effect on
rice production around the world, including many Third World
countries that rely on the crop as a food staple.
   Stephen Albrecht, a plant physiologist at the agency's
laboratory in Gainesville, Fla., said greenhouse tests with the
altered algae boosted rice production eight-fold. However, he said
it didn't do well in the field, probably because the algae had not
been adapted to field conditions.
   Normally, pond algae produces just enough nutrient-rich ammonia
from nitrogen in the atmosphere to take care of its own needs. The
genetically engineered strains keeps producing as long as nearby
plants need it.
   When rice plants stop taking in ammonia, the algae stops
production before excess amounts spill over into the environment.
   Albrecht said the on-and-off fertilizing system could mean less
groundwater contamination. Tests showed that while rice with algae
at its roots had some ammonia, there was none in the environment.
   If the algae can be adapted to rice fields, Albrecht said
growers could grow algae alongside rice fields and flood it into
the rice areas at irrigation time. He said it would be cheaper and
require less work than with commercial fertilizers.

<HEAD>Congressmen Denied Permission to Observe Lithuania Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has denied permission to
four U.S. congressmen who want to travel to Lithuania for this
weekend's elections in the Soviet Baltic republic, the legislators
said Wednesday.
   The group, led by Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., was selected by
Congress to observe the local elections Saturday after an
invitation was received from the Lithuanian national movement
Sajudis.
   Other members of the party include Reps. Christopher Cox,
R-Calif., and John Miller, R-Wash., and Texas Democrat Bill
Sarpalius, D-Texas.
   The group had hoped to pick up its visas at the Soviet consulate
in East Berlin, Durbin said, then catch an Aeroflot flight to
Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital.
   ``To our surprise we were greeted with a cable from the Soviets,
sent at 11 o'clock Washington time last night advising us that we
would not be allowed towitness the Lithuanian elections,'' Durbin
said. ``We thought that things were on track and that the visas
would be issued.''
   ``It's very frustrating. We're running into the limits of
glasnost, apparently,'' Miller said.
   Asked if the Soviets had specified reasons for the denial,
Durbin said they were told they hadn't gone through the appropriate
procedures.
   ``But frankly that conflicts with the fact that other
parliamentarians from Canada and Austria are presently in
Lithuania. It appears that they have made some special ruling, as
(the denial) relates only to members of Congress from the United
States,'' he said.
   In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev said the
congressmen had not been invited by any officially recognized
groups and said their trip was not coordinated or discussed through
diplomatic channels.
   ``Taking all these facts into account, the congressmen were
informed that their trip to the U.S.S.R. at present would be
incorrect,'' he said.
   ``This decision of course is in no connection with the
personalities of the congressmen. They are welcome in the U.S.S.R.
at any convenient date which could be mutually agreed upon.''
   Durbin said the delegation would continue to press for
permission to go to Lithuania and would contact Washington ``to
rally some support'' to pressure the Soviets.
   ``We still have time to make it to Lithuania before the election
and we all consider that to be of the utmost importance,'' Durbin
said.
   Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were independent states between
World War I and 1940, when they were annexed by the Soviet Union.
   The Baltic republics are seeking to obtain a measure of
independence from Moscow, and the elections Saturday will test the
strength of the nationalist movement in Lithuania.

   Federal safety officials investigating the
crash of an Avianca jetliner in New York issued emergency
recommendations today aimed at clarifying how pilots should declare
fuel emergencies.
   Seventy-three people died when the fuel-starved airliner crashed
in Long Island while on approach to Kennedy International Airport
in New York.
   The National Transportation Safety Board urged the Federal
Aviation Administration to alert all air carriers with flights in
the United States that their crews must be ``thoroughly
knowledgeable'' about FAA rules, including specific phrases to be
used when a plane is running out of fuel.
   The board, with three of its four members concurring, also
called on the FAA to issue a general notice to air traffic
controllers on the circumstances of the Jan. 25 crash of the
Colombian airliner and to emphasize the need for controllers to
request clarification of ``unclear or ambiguous transmissions''
from airliners that may convey an emergency.
   Pilots of the flight from Bogota and Medellin, Colombia, told
controllers several times they were running out of fuel.
   However, they never declared a formal ``minimum fuel'' status or
``emergency fuel condition,'' which would have alerted controllers
to clear them for landing as quickly as possible, NTSB members said.
   The board said it was continuing investigation into the cause of
the crash and ``has not concluded that any specific communication
or coordination problems were causal to the accident.''
   The FAA is not required to adopt recommendations by the NTSB, an
independent agency.
   Eighty-six people survived the crash of the Avianca Boeing 707
in Cove Neck, N.Y.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Vermont Couples' Challenge of `Rails to Trails' Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal law aimed at creating new hiking and
biking trails along unused rail lines was upheld Wednesday by the
Supreme Court.
   The justices unanimously rejected an appeal by a Vermont couple
who said their property rights were being trampled to satisfy the
nation's back-to-nature and physical-fitness boom.
   The court upheld a 1983 law, known as the ``rails-to-trails''
act, that permits unused rail lines to be converted into nature
trails.
   In other decisions, the court:
   _Voted, 7-2, to limit the authority of the White House Office of
Management and Budget to revise federal job-safety rules to reduce
paperwork for private businesses.
   _Upheld, by a 5-4 vote in a Colorado case, federal regulations
aimed at saving the government time and money when it mistakenly
overpays some Social Security recipients.
   _Reinstated, by a 5-4 vote, a $6.1 million award against the
Arthur Young &amp; Co. accounting firm won by investors in the Farmer's
Cooperative of Arkansas and Oklahoma.
   In the abandoned rail line case, the court said J. Paul
Preseault and his wife, Patricia, of Burlington, Vt., have not
shown their rights were violated by a 7.2-mile bicycle path that
passes through their lakefront property.
   The bike trail replaced a Vermont Railway line after train
service ended in 1975 and the tracks were torn up.
   The Interstate Commerce Commission approved the conversion under
the 1983 federal law.
   Justice William J. Brennan, writing for the court, said the
Preseaults still can file a claim for compensation against the
federal government under a separate law.
   The Preseaults said they may continue their fight.
   ``I guess at this point I'm stunned,'' J. Paul Preseault said.
``I didn't do this, go all the way to the Supreme Court, to have
them tell me to file my case in another court. I wasn't looking for
money. I wanted my property rights honored.''
   The Preseaults said the 1983 law violates the Constitution's
Fifth Amendment, which bars the taking of private property without
just compensation, and also said it interferes unlawfully with
interstate commerce.
   Brennan said the rails-to-trails law is a legitimate exercise of
congressional power aimed at ``encouraging the development of
additional recreational trails.''
   The ruling could affect a large number of property owners. The
nation's railway system, at its peak in 1920 with 272,000 miles of
track, is now down to 141,000 miles and 3,000 more miles are
abandoned each year.
   Ownership of the land claimed by the Preseaults is in dispute.
Vermont officials say the property belongs to the state.
   But if the Preseaults own the property, they say they have a
right under Vermont law to use the land once the rail line is
abandoned.
   But the 1983 federal law _ an amended version of the earlier
National Trails System Act _ allows for railroad rights-of-way to
be maintained for possible future railroad use while the land is
converted at least temporarily to nature trails.
   This practice, known as rail banking, is at the heart of
Wednesday's ruling.
   Vermont entered into a lease with the city of Burlington that
allows the city to maintain the right-of-way as a trail while
preserving it for possible rail use.
   Citing the state-city agreement, the Interstate Commerce
Commission rejected the Preseaults' bid to have the rail line
declared officially abandoned.
   The Preseaults said the rail-banking provisions are a sham to
conceal the true purpose of the federal law _ preventing railroad
rights-of-way from being returned to their rightful owners after
abandonment.
   The couple said the rail-banking procedure disguises the fact
that the rail lines have been abandoned.
   Brennan rejected that argument.
   The law is not invalid ``merely because more Draconian measures
_ such as a program of mandatory conversions or a prohibition of
all abandonments _ might advance more completely the rail-banking
purpose,'' he said. ``The history of congressional attempts to
address the problem of rail abandonments provides sufficient reason
to defer'' to Congress, he added.

<HEAD>Authorities Impose Curfew in Kosovo</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government imposed a nighttime
curfew Wednesday in Kosovo province, where more than two dozen
people have died this year in ethnic clashes.
   The official Tanjug news agency said Soviet-built T-55 tanks and
armored personnel carriers patrolled the streets of most Kosovo
towns to enforce the 9 p.m. to 4 a.m. curfew.
   Tanjug said Yugoslav authorities decided Tuesday that the curfew
was needed ``to defend the constitutional order and prevent
violence.''
   MiG-21 fighters streaked at low altitude over several towns, and
small groups of heavily armed soldiers patrolled villages, sources
in the region said.
   Thousands of Serbs had rallied for three days in Kosovo Polje, a
suburb of the provincial capital of Pristina, demanding a curfew
and protesting what they claimed were threats by ethnic Albanian
``separatists and terroritsts.''
   Ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of the population in
Kosovo, a province of the Serbian republic. They oppose moves by
Serbian leaders to more tightly control the province.
   One person died Tuesday and dozens were injured in clashes
between security forces and tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian
demonstrators demanding free elections, an end to a year-old state
of emergency and the release of political prisoners.
   Since January, 28 ethnic Albanians have been killed in ethnic
unrest, according to official figures. The same number were killed
in all of last year.
   During the curfew, ``movements and gatherings of people for the
purpose of demonstrating'' were strictly forbidden, said Belgrade
radio.
   Some small protests were reported during the day, mainly
involving ethnic Albanian schoolchildren and youths who taunted
riot police in several towns.
   A journalist who spoke by telephone from the region said nearly
all ethnic Albanian students boycotted classes and at least 30,000
workers continued a 2-week-old strike to protest what they
described as ``police repression.''
   Serbian students at Pristina university demanded that
authorities ``guarantee their safety'' from ethnic Albanians,
Tanjug said.
   The students also demanded that all university officials who
supported past demonstrations by Albanian students be fired and
threatened to ``continue their education outside the province'' if
the demands were not met, Tanjug said.
   The students also want authorities to jail the leaders of seven
new opposition movements. The Serbs accused the students of
inciting demonstrations and strikes by ethnic Albanians last month.
   The independent groups on Wednesday appealed to Kosovo residents
not to demonstrate.
   ``The authorities are trying to provoke an intercommunal
conflict in Kosovo,'' said the appeal.
   Tanjug said several bus companies from outside Kosovo have
discontinued service to the province because they fear attacks.
Last month, at least five buses were badly damaged by
stone-throwing demonstrators, Tanjug said.

   To Zeke the Sheik, the giant heap of
manure in his back yard is a monument to worldwide salvation.
   Local authorities see it as a big pile of something else.
   Timothy Dundon, whose sartorial preference for turbans and
caftan robes has won him the nickname ``Zeke the Sheik,'' says he
started constructing the 30-foot-high pile of cattle and horse
droppings 17 years ago.
   He had a vision and a mission _ to create a ``living monument''
that would save everyone in the world from a coming firestorm of
destruction.
   The compost pile _ with onions and cactus growing out of it _
has taken on all sorts of symbolic significance, Dundon says.
   ``This is alive,'' he says.
   Horsefeathers, say Los Angeles County fire and health officials,
who see it as a giant, smelly health hazard that could catch fire
and set the neighborhood ablaze.
   Dundon, 57, is well known in this city 12 miles northeast of
downtown Los Angeles _ he likes to talk in rhyme and hum the theme
to ``Dragnet,'' and the manure mountain marks only his most recent
brush with notoriety.
   ``It's awful,'' said neighbor Elisha Harrison. ``Especially in
the summer. There's flies, flies, flies.''
   ``We've never had any problems with it,'' said another neighbor,
Greg Jones. ``He's a cool dude.''

   A historic gingko tree, believed planted
136 years ago by the founder of this village, attracts admirers
from all over.
   Phooey, says its owner, it's a nuisance and should be chopped
down.
   ``The tree is smelly, messy and very brittle, making it a hazard
to the children who are continually climbing it,'' said Patrick
Gillespie. ``Besides, I am the one responsible for maintaining it,
and it is quite a job.''
   Mayor Scott Newberg said a national society of gingko tree
admirers frequently has its annual meeting in here because of the
100-foot tree.
   Gillespie is aware of the tree's historic value and says he's
wrestled with his conscience for years before deciding the
``rational thing to do'' is cut it down.
   In addition to raking up its leaves in the fall, Gillespie says
he must have the tree sprayed to prevent the growth of its nuts,
which form inside plum-like fleshy fruits that stink like rancid
butter.
   ``Everyone else has the idea that I am calloused,'' he said. ``I
appreciate their point of view, but they are not looking at mine.
I'm the one who has to live with it in my backyard.''

   Atlantis' commander got a sore
throat Wednesday, forcing NASA to postpone for at least 24 hours
the launch of the shuttle on a secret, all-military mission to put
a spy satellite in orbit.
   A space agency statement said a bad weather forecast also was a
factor in the postponement, but officials said that if not for the
illness they would have continued the countdown, hoping for clear
skies by launch time early Thursday.
   Navy Capt. John O. Creighton has ``basically a sore throat with
a little head congestion,'' said agency spokesman Kyle Herring.
``He does not have a fever. It could be an indication of a cold
coming on.''
   Herring said Creighton would not be replaced on the flight
because his illness is not serious. NASA said Creighton's health
and the weather will be evaluated Thursday in deciding whether to
attempt a launch Friday morning.
   ``We've never had a postponement due to the illness of an
astronaut; this is the first time in the space program,'' Herring
said.
   In 1970, astronaut Thomas K. Mattingly was taken off the Apollo
13 crew a few days before the flight was to lift off for the moon.
But backuop astronaut Jack Swigert replaced him without delaying
the flight.
   Herring said Creighton and the other four Atlantis crew members
were healthy when they took a physical exam on Tuesday and that
Creighton had approached the flight surgeon Wednesday with his
problem. All have been in semi-isolation the last week, their
contact limited to immediate family members and essential launch
official to reduce the possibility of exposure to illness.
   The afternoon announcement came shortly before technicians were
to begin pumping more than half a million gallons of propellant
into Atlantis' fuel tank for the four-day mission, which was to end
at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   A bleak forecast early Wednesday had gradually improved
throughout the day to a 50-50 chance for a fiery night launch on
Thursday. But the outlook for Friday and Saturday was even worse,
with one cold front moving out and another moving in.
   Because the Pentagon mission is classified, the space agency
would not provide the exact launch time, saying only that it would
occur between midnight and 4 a.m. Thursday. However, sources said
that Atlantis was to lift off at 1 a.m.
   Atlantis' orbit reportedly will cover a greater area of the
globe than any previous shuttle so that the satellite, once
released by the five-member crew, can gather intelligence over
northern areas of the Soviet Union where there are numerous
military bases and missile sites.
   To reach the high latitude, the shuttle is expected to fly into
orbit on a course skirting the East Coast, flying within a few
hundred miles of shore.
   Thus, if weather conditions are right, residents along the
Eastern Seaboard as far north as New Jersey might see Atlantis'
fiery tail.
   This is the sixth secret military mission and fourth after-dark
launch in 34 shuttle flights. The launch time is dictated by the
destination of the cargo.
   Creighton's crew is Air Force Col. John H. Casper, the pilot,
and mission specialists Marine Lt. Col. David C. Hilmers, Air Force
Col. Richard M. Mullane and Navy Lt. Cmdr. Pierre J. Thuot.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, reported the
astronauts were to deploy a 37,300-pound, $500 million spy
satellite capable of taking super-sharp reconnaissance photos and
listening in on military and diplomatic communications around the
world.
   Placed into a high inclination orbit, the spy satellite will
pass over most of the Soviet Union, including northern areas not
previously probed by shuttle-launched satellites. This orbit may be
important in verifying Soviet compliance with arms agreements now
being negotiated between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.
   The Soviets have their own satellites to monitor compliance.
   Military officials said the secrecy surrounding Defense
Department shuttle flights is necessary to make it more difficult
for Soviet reconnaissance satellites and spy ship off Cape
Canaveral to track the spacecraft.
   But critics argue that Soviet intelligence agents undoubtedly
already know a great deal about Atlantis' mission and once the
shuttle is in orbit, they will be able to track it precisely and
know what it is doing.

<HEAD>Leahy Says Foreign Trade Policy Could Help Farmers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee on Wednesday called for a more coordinated foreign trade
policy in the 1990 farm bill as a way to bolster agricultural
income.
   ``I would love to come here and promise American farmers that
the federal government will have more money to help them compete
internationally,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. ``But the
realities of our budget deficit make this unlikely.''
   He said more needs to be done with the funds available.
   ``We should target the most promising markets (and) adopt a
long-term market development strategy for those markets,'' said
Leahy, suggesting that the developing world holds the brightest
future for U.S. exports.
   Leahy directed his comments to Richard Crowder, undersecretary
for international affairs and commodity programs at the Agriculture
Department, during the last hearing the Senate Agriculture
Committee has scheduled on trade issues in preparation for the farm
bill.
   The senator said several studies have criticized federal export
promotion programs. He said that one bank participating in one of
those programs is being investigated on fraud charges.
   The bank _ a branch of the national bank of Italy in Atlanta,
Ga. _ has extended millions of dollars in loans guaranteed by the
Agriculture Department's Commodity Credit Corp. to Iraq.
   Leahy questioned whether the country was a good credit risk. He
said there had been rumors that Iraq was diverting the commodities
for purposes other than feeding its citizens.
   Crowder said Iraq's repayment record had been ``excellent.''
   ``We have audited some of the exporter's records and found
nothing to conclude there had been diversions,'' said Crowder.
   He said the criminal investigation of the bank was being handled
by banking authorities, not the USDA, and as long as the loans were
being repaid, the USDA was satisfied.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., asked Crowder the department's
philosophy on using the Export Enhancement Program, a bonus program
for exporters that makes U.S. commodities less expensive for
foreign buyers.
   Crowder said the main criteria was whether the European
Community sells to a certain country and if the United States could
displace European sales.
   ``As long as the European Community is selling, we will provide
export bonuses,'' said Crowder. The Bush and Reagan administrations
both have characterized the subsidies the EC puts on agricultural
products it exports as trade unfair.
   U.S. negotiators engaged in the ongoing Uruguay Round of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talk are trying to get the
Europeans to soften their subsidy system, but administration
officials, including Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, have
said U.S. subsidies will not be dropped until there is a
multilateral agreement.
   The talks, usually referred to as GATT, are expected to be
complete at the end of this year. Their outcome could lead to
revisions in U.S. farm policy.
   Among the administration's proposals for the farm bill is a
lifting of the ceiling Congress put on the amount that can be
traded under the Export Enhancement Program.

   Two opposition party activists were
beaten to death and the tongue of one victim was cut out by party
opponents, the traditionally anti-Communist National Peasants Party
alleged Wednesday.
   Peasants Party spokesman Valentin Gabrielescu declined to make
specific accusations about who was behind the reported killings,
but suggested they were politically motivated.
   Three suspects have been arrested in the Feb. 11 death and
mutilation of Vasile Velescu, Gabrielescu said, refusing to
identify them or their possible motives.
   He said only that Velescu, 60, ``was killed because he was the
chief of our organization'' in Bacau, 180 miles northeast of
Bucharest.
   Another party activist, from Calarasi County in southern
Romania, also was murdered, Gabrielescu said. He refused to name
the victim or give further details, saying he was following the
wishes of the victim's family.
   There was no independent confirmation of the alleged murders,
which would be the first ones with apparent political motives since
the end of the revolution that overthrew and executed Communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in December.
   Gabrielescu warned of the possibility of further violence
against the Peasants Party, the strongest rival of the National
Salvation Front in Romania's elections in May. The front governed
alone for six weeks after the revolution before being pressured to
share power with 37 other parties in a provisional Council of
National Unity.
   Peasants Party members were ``afraid to go ... to investigate
exactly what happened,'' Gabrielescu said.
   Meanwhile, Romania's newly appointed minister of defense said
that the Securitate, Ceausescu's infamous secret police, had been
completely dissolved. The Securitate battled the army and civilians
in the December revolution.
   But Col. Gen. Victor Stanculescu said a new security force would
be formed to protect the state's interests. His comments were an
apparent attempt to quell persistent concern that Securitate forces
continued to operate.
   A new security apparatus ``composed of army officers who have
proved their loyalty to the state'' would be created ``to protect
it from those who would destablize society,'' he told the
independent Romania Libera.
   In Bucharest and elsewhere, 3,294 Securitate members were put on
reserve army status, including 611 officers of the former
counter-espionage unit, he said.
   ``The majority ... who gave illegal orders or contributed to the
repression of the revolution are under investigation, under arrest
... and will be tried,'' he said.
   Supervisory groups from the Ministry of Defense have been posted
in all the surveillance and bugging centers run by the Securitate,
and the listening equipment is being destroyed, Stanculescu said.
   Deputy Prime Minister Gelu Voican said 15,000 full time
employees _ each with an undetermined number of civilian informers
_ had worked for the Securitate.

   Earth's population of 5.2 billion
people will increase this decade by nearly 1 billion, the fastest
population growth in history, a United Nations official said
Wednesday.
   The population is increasing by three people every second, or
about a quarter of a million every day, said Nafis Sadik, executive
director of the United Nations Population Fund.
   In 1990 alone, 90 million to 100 million people, or about the
combined population of the Philippines and South Korea, will be
added in the world, she said.
   ``By and large, the biggest increases will happen in the poorest
countries, those by definition least equipped to meet the needs of
the new arrivals and invest in their future,'' Mrs. Sadik said in a
speech at the weeklong One Asia Assembly.
   In 1984 population growth was slowing everywhere except in
Africa and parts of South Asia, but the decline was not enough, she
said. ``Today, the situation looks less promising. Progress in
reducing birth rates has been slower than expected.''
   Unless the trend is reversed soon, she said, the world's
population by the end of the next century probably would reach 14
billion rather than the 10 billion to 11 billion now projected.
   She said many Asian governments have declared a determined
effort to reduce population growth, but many countries continue to
grow at an average of 2 percent to 2.5 percent annually.
   In Southeast Asia, she added, rapid population growth is
damaging the economic gains many countries have achieved.
   ``One consequence of rapid population growth is to hold back or
cripple altogether the prospects of balanced development,'' she
said. ``In rural areas, landholdings are already small, generation
by generation they are growing smaller, and their owners poorer.
... (Population growth) has swallowed up most of the benefit from
investment and services.''
   Population growth also threatens food supplies and the
environment, she added.
   Nations should not wait to become industrialized before
launching population control programs, she said. Indonesia, South
Korea and Thailand made great economic strides while at the same
time controlling population growth.
   ``My vision of the future, despite the gloomy statistics I
quoted earlier, is quite optimistic,'' she said. ``Asian countries
have shown that population programs can be successful. This is the
first step toward a sustainable development.''

   Congressional investigators issued subpoenas
Wednesday for three former officials of a New Jersey public housing
authority accused of receiving improper salaries, including one who
was paid for four jobs at the same time.
   The House subcommittee that has been investigating scandals at
the Department of Housing and Urban Development voted to subpoena
Paul A. Marguglio, who was suspended from his job as executive
director of the Passaic, N.J., Public Housing Authority following a
HUD audit.
   Also subpoenaed was his wife, Louise Marguglio, and the Passaic
authority's suspended deputy executive director, Donald V. Pieri.
Both were accused by auditors of receiving excessive pay.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of the Government Operations
subcommittee on employment and housing, said none of the three had
responded to requests to appear before the panel voluntarily.
   ``We have received no cooperation,'' Lantos said. ``Therefore,
the subcommittee has no option but to issue a subpoena for these
individuals.''
   The subpoena for each was approved on 7-0 votes, with
Republicans joining Democrats in voting to compel their appearance.
They were ordered to appear March 2, or at another date set by
Lantos.
   According to an audit by the HUD inspector general and testimony
before the Lantos panel, Paul Marguglio received more than $245,000
in salaries during 1988 for holding two full-time and two part-time
job titles with the Passaic Public Housing Authority.
   Louise Marguglio, according to the subcommittee, was paid more
than $95,000 as the authority's director of administration between
January 1986 and her retirement in April 1988 _ but worked only one
day. Auditors concluded she received at least $50,000 in improper
compensation.
   Pieri, according to auditors, also held more than one job and
received more than $106,000 in salary. His job as deputy executive
director was budgeted to receive $57,970 in annual salary.
   Bruce Nagel, a New Jersey attorney for the Marguglios, declined
to comment on the subpoenas or on the allegations against his
clients.
   Congressional staff investigators said in a memo prepared for
members of the panel that neither Nagel nor the three former
officials had replied to letters and phone calls from the panel's
staff.
   Nagel denied that he had failed to respond to the committee.
``That's absolutely not true,'' he said. ``I've responded
repeatedly. Every time I call, their subcommittee people are not
available.''
   Nagel said he did not represent Pieri. Efforts to reach Pieri
were unsuccessful. His telephone number was unpublished.
   The Passaic audit prompted HUD to begin a national investigation
to look for similar activities. HUD General Counsel Frank Keating
told Congress earlier this month, however, that the department
believed salary abuses uncovered at Passaic were ``a unique
situation.''
   Public housing authorities such as the one in Passaic are local
agencies that operate primarily with federal HUD money.
   Paul Adams, the HUD inspector general, said the federal
government was likely defrauded when the Passaic authority's
commissioners approved more than $245,000 in 1988 pay to Paul
Marguglio. He said his office is investigating further.

<HEAD>Quadriplegic Pleads for Change in State Laws on Disabled Care</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONYA ROSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A quadriplegic who won court permission to shut
off his life-sustaining ventilator told lawmakers Wednesday that
the state's way of caring for the severely disabled was a big
reason behind his wish to die.
   Larry McAfee, 34, appeared before the Georgia Senate to plead
for changes in Georgia's system of care for the disabled, which he
called obsolete and cruel.
   Although he has changed his mind and decided to live, McAfee
said the quality of his life since he was paralyzed in 1985 has
been poor, primarily because he has been in institutions.
   ``When you look at me, try to remember that, but for the grace
of God, you could be like I am,'' he said, speaking slowly and
sometimes gasping for breath. ``Imagine being 34 years old and
being forced to live in a nursing home, far from your family and
friends.''
   McAfee asked a Superior Court judge in Atlanta last year to
grant him permission to unplug the ventilator that has helped him
breathe since he was paralyzed from the chin down in a 1985
motorcycle accident.
   The court agreed and the ruling was upheld by the state Supreme
Court, but the case raised questions about the quality of life
states provide for the disabled. Advocates for the disabled later
persuaded McAfee to change his mind about dying and promised to
help him find employment.
   McAfee, a mechanical engineer and outdoorsman before his
accident, is dependent on Medicaid and Medicare to pay for the care
he receives in an Alabaster, Ala., nursing home equipped to care
for patients on ventilators.
   He has said that depression over becoming an indigent ward of
the state contributed to his wish to die.
   He described life with paralysis as ``existence without choice''
and said the disabled are ``prisoners of bureaucracy that doesn't
address the quality of our shattered lives.''
   ``I will never, never get used to being totally paralyzed and
helpless,'' McAfee said. ``But I have accepted it as my fate.''
   McAfee said the state should adopt programs of independent
living for the disabled and should not send them to out-of-state
nursing homes.
   ``Unless I and others like me have your help, we have no hope
for the future,'' he said. ``If only some of you would have the
courage to push for change.''
   Sen. Hildred Shumake, who invited McAfee to speak, said he will
work to change the system that forces disabled people to remain in
institutions.
   ``He went to school in my district and he's my age,'' Shumake
said. ``I felt that something should be done for him.''

<HEAD>World Bank Signing First Loans For Polish Economic Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World Bank President Barber Conable will
sign two loans totaling $360 million Thursday, the first to Poland
since it rejoined the development agency.
   ``The loans that we will sign are the opening part of an
extended program that can last as long as the courageous course
continues,'' Conable said at a news conference Wednesday.
   Poland, which rejoined the World Bank in 1986, stands to receive
half of the $5 billion the 152-country agency plans to make
available to Eastern Europe in the next three years to fuel
economic reform.
   Future lending being negotiated with the World Bank includes
environmental projects, energy development, telecommunications and
a structural adjustment loan to support Poland's balance of
payments and other potential casualities of the dramatic economic
restructuring under way.
   Conable said he envisions a ``strong pipeline of diverse loans
addressed to repair and improvement of the infrastructure.''
   He said the first loans ``signal the strength of support for the
Polish economic program.''
   ``We are not here to provide short-term relief but to contribute
to the long-term growth,'' he said.
   But Conable stressed that future borrowing depends on Poland's
resolve to stick to the harsh reform measures adopted Jan. 1 to cap
inflation, close the budget deficit and reshape the nation's
centrally controlled socialist economy as a market-driven system.
   ``It is an extremely difficult, complex and heroic program,''
Conable said.
   He said that after two days of meetings with government and
financial leaders, he finds the public mood ``strongly supportive
at this point'' and is ``encouraged by the courage the Polish
people are showing.''
   The economic reform plan has sent prices soaring as government
subsidies to state-run industries are cut _ inflation was put at
nearly 79 percent in January _ and substantial unemployment is
anticipated as unprofitable enterprises close.
   The World Bank loans follow International Monetary Fund approval
of economic reform plan drafted by Poland's new non-Communist
government.
   A $260 million loan will support industrial export, while the
second $100 million loan will finance agricultural development.
   Both are intended to ``break bottlenecks'' such as poor
packaging and lack of machine parts that stymie production in
Poland's outmoded industries and under-mechanized farming, said
Janel Loos, the World Bank's expert on Poland.
   The 17-year loans will be made available to Poland's national
bank, which will extend credit to commercial banks for lending to
industries that meet the World Bank's criteria for viability and
repayment potential.
   Conable said Poland must seek further agreements with the Paris
Club, the informal group of 17 countries that holds $27 billion of
the $40 billion foreign debt.
   The Paris Club agreed Friday to reschedule nearly $10 billion in
Polish debts, suspending all payments until March 1991 and
spreading out the rest over 14 years. Poland is seeking reduction
of the debt.
   Also on Wednesday, a European Community spokesman said Polish
and Hungarian farmers should lose fewer crops this year to disease
because of agricultural chemicals the trading bloc will supply in
the next two months.
   The $61 million in insecticides and herbicides will come from
the EC's $366 million aid package for Poland and Hungary.
   Nico Wegter, EC spokesman for foreign affairs, said the products
had to be supplied urgently so that they could be used before
spring sowing begins.

   President Bush was to press his appeal for
more volunteerism in a speech to the nation's most powerful
business leaders, his spokesman said Wednesday.
   Bush was to address the Business Council, composed of chief
executive officiers of the 100 largest U.S. corporations, later in
the day at a dinner at the Library of Congress.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush would ask
their support for ``the administration's legislative agenda.''
   The business community generally supports most of Bush's
proposals, including his advocacy of a lower capital gains tax _ a
subject he mentions whenever he addresses business groups.
   In his speech to the corporate executives, Fitzwater said, Bush
also wanted ``to discuss their involvement as voluntary leaders in
their communities.''
   As with most Business Council sessions with government
officials, the session was to be closed to the press. Fitzwater
said that ran against White House wishes, but that the president
would respect the organization's request for privacy.
   ``We always want these things open. The president makes the same
remarks whether it's open or closed,'' Fitzwater said.

   The Soviet Union has turned down visa requests
from four members of Congress who had planned to go to Lithuania
for legislative and local elections this weekend, the State
Department said Wednesday.
   Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler expressed regret over the decision
and said U.S. Ambassador John Matlock was raising the issue with
Soviet authorities.
   Soviet officials said the visas for the lawmakers were not
approved because the four had not been invited by the appropriate
authorities in Moscow, the spokeswoman said.
   An invitation had been extended instead by an independent
movement in Lithuania, where a pro-secessionist movement has been
gaining strength.
   The congressmen are Richard Durbin, D-Ill.; Bill Sarpulias,
D-Texas; Christopher Cox, R-Calif., and John Miller, R-Wash. They
departed on their trip Tuesday and were in West Berlin on
Wednesday, hoping the Soviets would reverse their decision.
   ``The Soviet refusal to issue visas is inconsistent with a
pattern of broad contacts between legislators in both countries,''
Ms. Tutwiler said, adding that the United States recently hosted a
visit by Soviet legislators.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Accuses Ex-minister of ``Egotism''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A special prosecutor Wednesday
accused a former justice minister of being stubborn and
egotistical, and he urged the supreme court to convict her of
leaking official secrets to her husband.
   Joseph-Daniel Piller, the state prosecutor in the nation's first
criminal trial of a former Cabinet member, also asked the court to
fine former Justice Minister Elisabeth Kopp $5,400.
   Mrs. Kopp, the only woman in Swiss history to sit in the
Cabinet, went on trial Monday and pleaded innocent. A verdict by
the five-man supreme court, the Federal Tribunal, is expected
Friday.
   At Wednesday's session, Piller accused Mrs. Kopp of ``egoism''
for trying to pin her one-time personal assistant with the blame
for the telephone call to her husband that is at the center of the
case.
   In a final statement to the court Wednesday, Mrs. Kopp rejected
Piller's portrayal and pleaded for acquittal. She cited her 20-year
record of public service.
   Her attorney, Peter Hafter, charged that Swiss news media
prejudiced the trial with their reporting on the scandal.
   In his summary, Piller also attacked Mrs. Kopp for what he
called showing ``stubbornness and untruthfulness'' in her halting
public disclosures during the affair, which forced her resignation
in January 1989.
   He also demanded convictions and lesser fines for Mrs. Kopp's
assistant, Katharina Schoop, and another former Justice Ministry
aide, Renate Schwob.
   All are charged with violating official secrets laws, an offense
that carries a maximum three-year prison term and fines of up to
$27,000.
   Mrs. Kopp, 53, admitted in court that she called her husband,
lawyer- businessman Hans W. Kopp, from her office on Oct. 27, 1988,
and urged him to break ties with a firm under scrutiny in
Switzerland's biggest inquiry into the laundering of drug money.
Kopp resigned as vice president at Lebanese-controlled Shakarchi
Trading A.G. the same day.
   No charges have been filed against Shakarchi, and the company
has denied involvement.
   Ms. Schoop testified that Schwob showed her department documents
containing the Shakarchi suspicions.
   Ms. Schoop said that when she rushed to tell Mrs. Kopp, the
information's source was never mentioned. However, she said she
believed Mrs. Kopp must have realized it came from inside the
ministry.
   Mrs. Kopp denied that version, saying she tipped her husband
believing the suspicions came from ``banking circles.''
   However, Mrs. Kopp acknowledged she told her husband to phone
Ms. Schoop for details.

<HEAD>FBI Won't Have to Cut 400 Agents, Justice Department Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI won't have to cut 400 agents from its
payroll next year because it has found new ways to save money under
President Bush's proposed 1991 fiscal-year budget, the Justice
Department said Wednesday.
   The cost-cutting measures were worked out in the last few weeks
since Bush's budget proposal was sent to Congress, said Justice
Department spokesman David Runkel.
   Under the proposed budget, the FBI would have been forced to cut
more than 400 agents from its payroll, probably through attrition,
in order to finance an estimated $42 million in additional overtime
expenses.
   A new law passed by Congress last year increases the overtime
pay for federal law enforcement officers, including FBI agents.
   After the budget was unveiled, FBI officials said the bureau
would be forced to cut more than 400 agents from its workforce of
more tan 10,000.
   But under the new plan to pay for the overtime costs, the FBI
will stagger the hiring of 338 new agents provided in the 1991
budget to investigate organized crime, drugs and white-collar
fraud, said an FBI official.
   The hiring of these additional agents will be spread out over
the 1991 fiscal year to save money, said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. The FBI will also save money by postponing
purchase of some new equipment, said the official.

   A man who went berserk on a city street and bit at
least eight people before he collapsed and died was suffering from
AIDS, police said Wednesday, and they encouraged his victims to
call health authorities.
   Experts say there are no known instances of AIDS being
transmitted by biting, but police said they were issuing the appeal
as a precaution.
   The incident occurred Feb. 7 when Jean Marc Rosius, 28, who gave
his address as a homeless shelter, began accosting passersby, said
police spokesman Ray Lang.
   At least four people were bitten seriously enough to be
hospitalized, including some who had flaps of skin hanging off arms
and faces.
   The arresting officer, Orestes Guas, was also bitten and
treated, Lang said.
   ``After Mr. Rosius was subdued, he had breathing difficulties,
and was transported to Jackson Memorial Hospital, where he died,''
said Lang.
   An autopsy found that Rosius, who had a history of mental
problems, had used cocaine and had AIDS.
   ``At this point, what we're doing is recommending that anyone
who had any contact with Mr. Rosius _ if they were bitten or
scratched or had any relationship at all,'' contact their local
AIDS hotline, he said.
   In addition to the four people hospitalized, three others
initially reported that they had been bitten. Authorities think
they may be illegal aliens who are reluctant to come forward.
   One of those bitten and hospitalized was Guillermo Herrada, 54.
   ``This is the worst news I've ever had in my life,'' Herrada
said Tuesday. ``I don't know what I'm going to do.''
   ``There aren't documented instances of HIV (the AIDS virus)
transmitted by a human bite, but in health care settings, there
have been instances of HIV transmitted by blood through a needle
stick,'' said Constance Wofsy, professor of clinical medicine at
the University of California at San Francisco.
   ``There's a theoretic possibility that falls between no reported
cases and the hypothetical risk of blood being exchanged through a
deep bite,'' she said.

<HEAD>Flooded Areas Brace for More Rain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A new storm system raised the threat of more flooding Wednesday
in the saturated South, where heavy rains last week were blamed for
nine deaths.
   ``There are places that have no room to put more rain _ I'm
talking about completely saturated,'' Dusty Perkins of the
Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said Wednesday.
   ``If heavy rain falls in areas that are already inundated, we
are going to certainly have an aggravated situation in terms of
more evacuations and additional damage.''
   The rain was associated with a strong low pressure system and
cold front moving eastward from the Texas Gulf Coast.
   By midday, showers and thunderstorms already extended from the
eastern half of Texas across Louisiana, southern Alabama,
southwestern Arkansas and southern through western Oklahoma, the
National Weather Service said.
   During the six hours up to noon, 2.66 inches fell at Palacios,
Texas and 1.25 inches at Victoria, Texas.
   Flood watches were posted to the east as far as northwestern
Florida.
   Since late last week, floods have been blamed for three deaths
each in Georgia and Alabama, two in Mississippi and one in North
Carolina.
   In southern Mississippi, residents along the Pascagoula River
system were told to prepare for what could be the worst flooding in
years. The Pascagoula at Merrill was up to 24.7 feet and still
rising Wednesday, heading toward a predicted 27-foot crest Friday.
Flood stage is 22 feet.
   ``The question now is how much more rain are we going to get,''
said Hank Turk, Jackson County public safety director.
   Rivers were receding over much of Alabama, but the ground was
saturated and the weather service predicted 2 to 4 inches of rain,
meaning some streams would likely jump their banks again.
   The additional rain comes while damage estimates for the floods
that began last week are still far from complete.
   ``Our damage figures continue to increase as flood waters recede
and we are able to get into areas that were under water,'' said
Rudy Duncan, who is directing the Red Cross operation in Alabama.
   Georgia Gov. Joe Frank Harris has asked for $15.7 million in
federal disaster aid for nine counties because of floods and
tornadoes.
   Up to 5 inches of rain was forecast from the new round of storms
in Mississippi, but the weather might be less severe in Georgia,
producing up to 2 inches instead of the 10 that hit parts of
Georgia last weekend.
   ``It will be cooler than last week, so that will limit the rain
a little bit,'' said weather service hydrologist Russell Post in
Atlanta. ``But there's still a potential for several inches of
rain.''

   A new round of storms moved into the flood-weary South on
Wednesday, and the Northwest received up to a foot of snow.
   By Midday, showers and thunderstorms extended from the eastern
half of Texas across Louisiana, Alabama, Arkansas and Oklahoma.
Flood watches were issued for southeastern Texas, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama and northwestern Florida.
   Morning thunderstorms generated wind gusting to 60 mph at Alice,
Texas.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to noon included 2.66
inches at Palacios, Texas, and 1.25 inches at Victoria, Texas.
   As much as 12 inches of snow fell overnight across the northern
Cascades and northeastern mountains of Oregon, with lighter
snowfall over the southern Cascades. Rain was scattered over the
northern Pacific Coast.
   Farther north, Kodiak, Alaska, got 6 additional inches of snow
Wednesday morning for a total February snowfall of 21 inches and
102 inches for the season to date. The record is 159 inches, over
13 feet, in the winter of 1970-1971.
   Elsewhere, snow was scattered over northern Maine and
south-central Kansas.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 11
degrees at Limestone, Maine, to 86 at both Fort Myers and Naples,
Fla.
   Wednesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 15 below zero at

   A convicted Palestinian terrorist has
dropped his appeal in a bombing case after a co-defendant confessed
to involvement, news reports said Wednesday.
   A district court in December sentenced Abu Talb and Marten
Imandi to life in prison for three bombings in Denmark and the
Netherlands in 1985 and 1986. Both pleaded innocent and later
appealed their convictions.
   However, Imandi confessed earlier this month to having carried
the trunks containing the bombs. One person was killed and several
injured in the explosions outside American and Israeli targets in
Copenhagen and Amsterdam.
   ``Since the confession of Marten Imandi has rendered a trial of
the case in the Appellate Court pointless, I hereby recall my
notice of appeal,'' the national news agency TT quoted Abu Talb as
saying in a letter to the court.
   Abu Talb has been named as a possible suspect in the explosion
of Pan Am's Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988.
A total of 270 people died in the bombing, which was linked to Abu
Talb through clothes found in the suitcase containing the bomb.
   Abu Talb's lawyer, Sven-Erik Sjogren, told TT the decision to
drop the appeal ``has no connection with the Lockerbie case.''
   Despite his confession, Imandi is still appealing to challenge
his life sentence.
   The appeals trial opens in Stockholm on Wednesday for him and a
third defendant, Moustafa Mougrabi. He was sentenced to one year in
prison.
   His brother, Mahmoud Mougrabi, also confessed to taking part in
the bombings and did not appeal his six-year sentence.

<HEAD>It's Back to Winter for Winter Wheat Growers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's winter wheat region has returned
to February reality after weeks of balmy temperatures, the
government's Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said Wednesday.
   ``Winter returned to the northern and central plains as Arctic
air plunged south and reversed the warm spell of the last two
months,'' the facility said in its report for Feb. 11-17.
   ``Rain benefited winter wheat in portions of the central and
southern Great Plains,'' the report said, although ``additional
moisture was needed in Kansas.''
   The facility is operated by the department's of Agriculture and
Commerce. The weekly reports cover weather and crop conditions but
do not include crop production forecasts.
   In a related report, the USDA said wheat inventories may drop to
443 million bushels by the beginning of the next marketing year on
June 1, the lowest in 15 years and down from 702 million bushels a
year ago.
   ``However, increases in planted area and a return to normal
yields in 1990 will likely allow modest stock rebuilding if use is
similar to the previous two years,'' the department's Economic
Research Service said.
   The U.S. area planted to winter wheat last fall is up 3 percent,
even though an additional 1.9 million acres of wheat base were
enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program during 1989.
   ``While the winter wheat crop in the southern plains was
stressed by dryness in the fall and early winter, precipitation and
relatively mild temperatures in January and February have raised
crop prospects,'' the report said. ``Nonetheless, timely rains will
be needed in coming months.''

<HEAD>Havel Says Europe `Will Decide for Itself' on U.S., Soviet Troops</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS grafs 3-4, bgng, At Bush's ... to UPDATE with meeting at
White House</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel told
Congress Wednesday that his nation welcomes U.S. help after decades
of Soviet domination but that eventually Europe must ``decide for
itself'' how long American and Soviet troops should remain.
   His speech, to a joint meeting of the House and Senate, came a
day after President Bush told the playwright-turned-president that
NATO would ``continue to play a vital role in assuring stability
and security in Europe'' and that the United States would maintain
a ``strong military presence.''
   At Bush's request, Havel returned to the White House after his
speech to Congress. White House aides said the 45-minute return
session was not designed to smooth over any differences on troop
levels, but to complete talks on economic issues and trade.
   ``They didn't get to all (the items) yesterday,'' said
presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. He said they talked at
length Wednesday about the future of Europe and agreed to stay in
close contact during this period of rapid change.
   Havel, the first of the new East European leaders to address
Congress, said the United States could best help his country by
pressing the Soviet Union to stay on its own road to democracy.
   He said he recognized a need for U.S. troops in Europe.
   But, he added, ``Sooner or later, Europe must recover and come
into its own, and decide for itself how many of whose soldiers it
needs.''
   In a speech that was largely philosophical, Havel said Americans
need to learn, along with his country, ``how to put morality ahead
of politics, science and economics.''
   Havel, who reluctantly accepted the popular mandate of his
country to lead during its time of rapid transition, received a
two-minute standing ovation in the crowded House chamber, and
appeared somewhat stiff and surprised at the reception.
   As he began to speak, U.S. tennis star and former Czechoslovak
citizen Martina Navratilova dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief
in the top row of the visitor's gallery.
   Speaking through a translator, Havel called Czechoslovakia one
of Eastern Europe's ``wayward children'' and said it wants to
coordinate its return to the economic and political mainstream with
Hungary, Poland and other nations emerging from 40 years of Soviet
domination.
   The United States can best aid that return, he said, by helping
the Soviet Union ``on its irreversible, but immensely complicated
road to democracy.''
   ``The more quickly and the more peacefully the Soviet Union
begins to move along the road towards genuine political pluralism''
and economic reform, ``the better it will be _ not just for Czechs
and Slovaks, but for the whole world,'' he said.
   Addressing reporters later, Havel declined to elaborate on that
call, saying it was not his place to suggest specific moves to the
United States.
   The members of Congress came to their feet when Havel said his
country's peaceful revolution was inspired by the U.S.
Constitution, Bill of Rights and Declaration of Independence.
``They inspire us to be citizens,'' he said.
   After his White House meeting, Havel was leaving Washington for
New York and meetings with business leaders _ and a rock concert in
his honor.
   Havel, the first head of state from his country to visit
Washington, said that Europe is leaving the ``antiquated
straitjacket'' of a world dominated by two superpowers for one in
which nations can stand more independently.
   Lawmakers applauded his conclusion that American troops will be
able to return home ``because Europe will at last be able to stand
guard over itself.''
   In the meantime, he declared, ``Czechoslovakia is returning to
Europe.''
   Havel called for the removal of ``as many Soviet (military)
units as possible'' from his country before national elections
scheduled for June.
   He also called for moving up the Helsinki II international
conference now planned for 1992 and turning it into a European
peace conference ``that would finally put a formal end to the
Second World War and all its unhappy consequences.'' At a brief
news conference later, he suggested such a meeting might come in
1991.
   Turning philosophical, he said years of repression have given
his countrymen time to ponder what is truly important, and said
Americans can learn from that experience as well.
   ``The salvation of this human world lies nowhere else than in
the human heart, in the human power to reflect, in human meekness
and human responsibility,'' Havel told the lawmakers.
   ``We are still under the sway of the destructive and vain belief
that man is the pinnacle of creation, and not just a part of it,
and that therefore everything is permitted.''
   His speech came a day after Havel got promises from Bush of
freer trade between the two countries and incentives for new
investment and economic development.
   The Bush administration and leading lawmakers also have proposed
expanding an aid program begun last year for Poland and Hungary to
include Czechoslovakia and other countries emerging from Soviet
domination.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, has proposed sweetening the program with an
additional $511 million next year and including new countries that
meet certain tests for economic and political reform.
   Havel did not directly address the question of aid, but at one
point commented that greater stability in Europe would lead to
reductions in U.S. military spending. ``The millions you give to
the East today will soon return to you in the form of billions in
savings,'' he said.

<HEAD>IRA Claims Responsibility for Explosion Near Army Van</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS thruout with police stoned while trying to arrest

<DATELINE>LEICESTER, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Irish Republican Army claimed
responsibility Wednesday for a bombing near an army van in the
center of Leicester that shook buildings, knocked down pedestrians
and slightly injured three people.
   In a separate incident, a stone-throwing crowd forced police
officers to release five people suspected of planning to attack an
army helicopter, authorities said Wednesday. Three suspects were
recaptured later, however.
   A forensic examination had established ``similarities'' between
Tuesday's bomb in Leicester, 100 miles northwest of London, and a
device found after an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Lt. Gen.
Sir David Ramsbotham in London's fashionable Kensington district on
Nov. 14, said Assistant Chief Constable Tony Butler.
   Both were homemade devices containing 4 to 5 pounds of
high-powered plastic explosive and mercury tilt switches and were
attached to the bottom of the vehicles by magnets, he said.
   On both occasions, the magnets failed and the bombs fell onto
the road, preventing death or serious injury.
   The IRA claimed responsibility for Tuesday's blast in a
statement Wednesday night to Britain's domestic news agency, Press
Association.
   The blast shook buildings within 200 yards and shattered more
than two dozen windows at a nearby unused factory, sending shards
of glass over a wide area.
   The van's driver, a Women's Royal Army Corps sergeant, and her
passenger, a Coldstream Guards sergeant, escaped with only minor
injuries, as did a passerby who was showered with glass.
   Home Secretary David Waddington on Wednesday described the blast
as ``another diabolical enterprise by the IRA.''
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite the province, where Protestants outnumber Catholics 3 to 2,
with the Republic of Ireland, where 95 percent of the people are
Catholic.
   In their report on the alleged plan to shoot down the
helicopter, police said the crew of the aircraft spotted masked men
preparing an ambush outside Cullyhanna village in South Armagh.
   The area is known as ``bandit country'' because of its links
with the IRA and because it is close to the border with the Irish
Republic.
   The crew radioed an alert to police, but the attack squad
apparently heard it on their own radio and fled toward the border,
authorities said.
   Police arriving at the scene reported finding three rifles and
two heavy machine guns that can fire 800 armor-piercing bullets a
minute. They have been used by the IRA in past attacks on
helicopters.
   The police chased the group, which hijacked and abandoned eight
cars in their escape attempt over narrow, twisting country roads.
They were finally cornered in Silverbridge village.
   However, the police said they had to set their captives free
when the officers were surrounded and stoned by a crowd of about 40
men in a housing project. The police managed to resume the chase
and make three arrests, but at least two suspects escaped.

<HEAD>Law to Create Powerful Presidency Goes to Legislature</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet legislators were given copies Wednesday of
proposed constitutional changes that would make the presidency, now
held by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, much more powerful.
   Gorbachev has urged the Supreme Soviet to approve the plan for a
Western-style presidential system of government.
   Vladimir Tumanov of the Institute of State and Law in Moscow,
who helped draft the proposal, said copies were distributed
Wednesday and the Supreme Soviet held closed committee meetings.
Tumanov said he had not seen the final version and could not give
details.
   News reports said the changes would provide for the president to
be elected to terms of either five or six years and give him the
power to veto legislation, which could be overriden.
   According to the published accounts:
   Sergei Stankevich, a member of a parliamentary commission that
considers draft laws submitted to the Supreme Soviet, said the
Soviet president would have most of the powers of his French and
American counterparts with few of the constitutional limitations.
   Deputies from the Baltic states are alarmed about provisions
that would impose severe restrictions on the rights of republics to
secede and permit authorities to crack down on ``nationalist''
organizations.
   Stankevich said: ``I don't think this new legislation will be
acceptable to anyone who believes in a constitutional system of
checks and balances.''
   Alexander Yakovlev, an aide to Gorbachev, said the presidential
system was necessary to ensure stable development of democracy in
the Soviet Union.
   The reports said the president would be empowered to declare an
emergency without the relevant republic's consent, to rule by
decree when the Supreme Soviet was not in session and to cancel
legislation adopted by the legislatures of Soviet republics.
   They said the parliament could take votes of no-confidence, and
if the president lost he could disband the parliament and call new
elections.

<HEAD>South African Minister's Visit to Angola Reportedly Postponed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Foreign Ministry sources said a visit to
Angola by South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha, expected
Thursday, was postponed and would take place March 1.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday
Angola was informed of the postponement by a telex from South
Africa's Department of Foreign Affairs.
   Botha reportedly will have confer with Foreign Minister Pedro de
Castro van Dunem, and possibly with President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos, on deteriorating peace prospects here.
   Bitter fighting intensified Wednesday around Mavinga, 700 miles
southeast in Cuanda Cubango province.
   An airstrip at Mavinga and a nearby rebel base block the
government forces' way to rebel headquarters at Jamba, more than
120 miles farther south.
   A statement released in Lisbon, Portugal, and signed by UNITA
chief Jonas Savimbi said soldiers retreated under rebel pressure.
   It gave no details of positions held in the town's
seven-square-mile area.
   The statement claimed that government planes were dropping
chemical bombs on civilian and military targets behind UNITA lines.
   It said rebels captured more than 15 pilots and tank engineers
in the clashes and would turn them over to Zairean President Mobutu
Sese Seko, who was appointed mediator after a short-lived truce
last June.
   UNITA _ the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
_ has been fighting to force the Marxist government in Luanda to
share power since shortly after Angola gained independence from
Portugal in 1975.
   The battle for Mavinga has raged since the government launched
an offensive late December.
   ``We will resist to the last, and in this sense we have been
able to count on the Americans, who have guaranteed us material and
moral support,'' the UNITA statement said.
   UNITA receives a reported $50 million in U.S. aid yearly,
including sophisticated Stinger ground-to-air missiles. Angolan
troops use Soviet weapons.
   Botha and Van Dunem will try to set a possible date for a
meeting here of Angolan, Cuban and South African officials, the
sources said.
   Angola, Cuba and South Africa signed U.S.-brokered regional
peace accords in December 1988 in New York that set terms for
withdrawal of about 50,000 Cuban soldiers from Angola, a halt in
South African aid to UNITA and independence for Namibia, formerly
ruled by South Africa.
   A meeting of the three nations with U.S. and Soviet observers
had been set for mid-February, but was postponed after Cuba
suspended its troop withdrawal on Jan. 25 after four Cubans died in
a UNITA raid in western Angola.
   Cuba and Angola said Tuesday in Luanda the pullout would resume
Sunday, after Savimbi apologized to Cuban President Fidel Castro
for the deaths.
   An Angolan-UNITA truce was agreed on last June, but it collapsed
within weeks and peace talks broke down.
   Mobutu's efforts to get the two parties back to negotiations
have failed, despite backing from the superpowers and African and
European leaders.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of police were mobilized Wednesday to
protect a Tokyo suburb from a war between an affilitate of the
Yamaguchi-gumi, Japan's largest underworld syndicate, and a smaller
gang.
   The violence began last Thursday when two members of the
Yamaguchi-gumi faction led by Masaru Takumi were beaten to death at
an office of the Nibiki-kai gang in the suburb, Hachioji.
   In a show of strength Wednesday morning, dozens of police raided
the Takumi group's headquarters and several other Yamaguchi-gumi
buildings in Osaka, western Japan.
   Later Wednesday, a two-ton truck was rammed into the home of
Kazuhiko Yanai, a Nibiki-kai leader in Yokohama, a city police
official reported. He said several shots were fired, but no one was
injured.
   After gang boss Yoshinori Watanabe, Takumi is the most powerful
leader in the Yamaguchi-gumi, which police say has about 21,000
members. They declined to estimate the size of the much smaller
Nibiki-kai.
   Nearly a dozen gang clashes have been reported since last
Thursday, including the fatal shooting of a Nibiki-kai leader in
Hokkaido, northern Japan. Thirteen Yamaguchi-gumi members and three
from Nibiki-kai have been arrested.
   On Tuesday, a Yamaguchi-gumi member turned himself in to
Hachioji police after mistakenly ramming a pickup truck into a
building he thought belonged to the rival gang, officers said. No
one was hurt.
   Because of that incident and nine shootings, police in Hachioji
mobilized 300 to 400 officers Wednesdy to crack down on gang
activity, a police official in the suburb said.
   Children have been told not to walk near the gang office, which
is near an elementary school.
   The official, who would not let his name be used, said Hachioji
police were joined by investigators from Tokyo's Metropolitan
Police Department, but he would not say how many.
   An official at Tokyo headquarters, who also spoke on condition
of anonymity, said the department held a strategy meeting Wednesday
morning. He would not comment further, to avoid ``giving away our
battle plan.''
   Handguns are illegal in Japan and violent crimes are relatively
rare, but police say a three-year war between the Yamaguchi-gumi
and the Ichiwa-kai that cost more than 25 lives led many gangs to
obtain more weapons.
   Police also say the Yamaguchi-gumi's lack of a decisive victory
in the war, which ended last year with the rival leader's
retirement, encouraged other gangs to challenge its turf.
   They estimate the total number of gangsters in Japan at 90,000
and say nearly half are associated with the three largest gangs _
the Yamaguchi-gumi, Inagawa-kai and Sumiyoshi Rengo.
   Total underworld income, derived mostly from drugs, extortion
and gambling, is believed to exceed the equivalent of $9 billion a
year.

<TEXT>
   Some workers at the Sellafield
nuclear reprocessing plant may be counseled not to have children
because higher-than-expected rates of leukemia have been found
among workers' children, a company official said Wednesday.
   Dr. Roger Berry, health and safety director for British Nuclear
Fuels Ltd., operator of the plant, said: ``Workers who want
individual counseling can get it and if they are so worried the
advice could be: `Don't have children.' It is not something,
however, that I hope would be widespread advice.''
   British Nuclear Fuels later issued a statement saying advising
workers not to have families ``is not company policy.''
   A research team headed by Martin Gardner, professor of medical
studies at the University of Southampton, reported in last week's
British Medical Journal that children of men who worked at the
plant had a higher-than-expected rate of leukemia.
   British Nuclear Fuels said the company had promised medical
counseling for all employees to ensure they understood the report
and the risks to them if its findings are confirmed. ``Ultimately,
it is then for each individual worker to reach a decision, not for
the company to advise on one course of action or another,'' it said.
   Gardner met with workers at the plant in northern England on
Wednesday and later said he was urging British Nuclear Fuels to
study whether it was possible to minimize radiation exposures of
younger workers.
   ``These would be the sort of people who were still capable of
having families and may prefer not working in higher radiation
levels,'' said Gardner, adding he did not wish to overstate the
risks involved.
   ``The risk of a child in this country getting leukemia is 1 in
2,000, while those whose fathers were exposed to the highest
radiation levels is about 7 in 2,000, or 1 in 300.
   ``What I am saying to them is that 299 out of 300 children will
not get leukemia even if their fathers have been subjected to the
highest exposure levels.''
   Gardner said he told workers his report did not prove a
connection between childhood leukemia and radiation exposure to the
fathers.
   ``It is something that I suggest could be associated and not
necessarily showing cause and effect,'' he said.
   Alan Johnson, director of reprocessing at Sellafield, said he
wanted to see more studies on possible links between leukemia and
radiation.
   ``We have always reduced radiation levels over the past 20 years
and will continue to reduce them,'' he said.
   Bernard Owen, a local official of the General and Municipal
Boilermakers Union, said that ``as a matter of urgency we want to
see a follow-up of his study and the collating of further studies
into the problem before we can come to a firm conclusion.''
   Martin Forwood, campaign secretary of CORE _ Cumbrians Opposed
to a Radioactive Environment _ said he hoped Wednesday's meetings
would calm workforce fears.
   ``Publicly, the workers may not state their worries because they
are a very loyal and captive work force,'' Forwood said.
   ``However, I am sure that behind closed doors there must be a
lot of doubt and concern among them, especially among those of the
reproductive age.''
   Gardner's study examined 52 victims of leukemia and lymphoma
under 25 years old, born in the West Cumbria health district and
diagnosed between 1950-85. They were compared with 1,001 control
children.
   One researcher, radiotherapist Michael Snee, said the radiation
probably caused a mutation in the fathers' sperm.
   In November, the Medical Research Council and the Imperial
Research Fund reported that an increased risk of leukemia is not
associated with exposure to radiation, with the possible exception
of the Sellafield plant, which has been plagued by radiation leaks.
   Gardner said the main finding of his study was that the risk was
highest for a father who received total exposure exceeding 100
millisieverts. One millisievert equals half a typical individual's
annual dose from natural radiation, or 50 times the dose of a
single chest X-ray.

<TEXT>
   Reconstruction of an East Berlin synagogue
that was once one of the most important in Europe will cost at
least $16.6 million, a Jewish community official said Wednesday.
   The Neue Berliner Synagogue, destroyed by air raids in World War
II, is being rebuilt as a synagogue and a Jewish center. It is more
commonly known as Oranienburger synagogue, after the street it is
on.
   Reconstruction began on Nov. 9, 1988, the 50th anniversary of a
pogrom in which Nazis beat and killed Jews and destroyed synagogues
and Jewish businesses. The Neue Berliner Synagogue was set afire
that night.
   Only about 400 practicing Jews remain in East Germany today,
about half of them in East Berlin. According to Heinz Galinski,
leader of the West Berlin Jewish community, there were 173,000
practicing Jews in Berlin before the Holocaust.
   Hermann Simon, director of the foundation overseeing
reconstruction of the synagogue and deputy leader of East Berlin's
Jewish community, said the project is relying mainly on donations.
The official news agency ADN distributed his remarks.
   He also is counting on help from the present and future East
German governments. The government under Erich Honecker, now
ousted, had agreed to finance 35 percent of the project.
   Simon praised West Germany for its recent contribution of about
$580,000.
   ``Every German government has to face this part of history, no
matter what the common future may bring,'' Simon said.
   He said projects at the new center will include continuing
education classes for teachers and art exhibitions about Jewish
life.

   A Palestinian who is considered a potential
peace negotiator said Wednesday that Jewish settlers in the
occupied lands could stay in a future Palestinian state if they
integrated into Arab villages.
   ``People who want to live in mixed Jewish-Moslem-Christian
villages, that's fine, but there will be no room for ghettos,''
pro-PLO activist Faisal Husseini said.
   He was speaking to about 200 Israeli activists of a newly formed
peace movement of Sephardic Jews from slums and poor towns.
   Husseini, speaking in Hebrew, said more than 70,000 Israelis who
live in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip would have to agree
to live under Palestinian rule if they wished to remain. The
Israelis live alongside 1.7 million Palestinians.
   The Sephardic group, called The Forum for Social Justice and
Peace, claims a membership of 2,000 Jewish Israelis of Arab origin.
Such people traditionally have been steadfast supporters of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc.
   However, the new group's leaders want the Israeli government to
begin peace talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   ``We have no choice but to talk to the Palestinians, even with
(PLO chief) Yasser Arafat. Arafat is showing openness. Why
shouldn't we be going for peace?'' said one organizer, Yehuda
Elush, a former Likud supporter from the southern town of Beersheba.
   Husseini's 20-minute speech was one of a series he has given
lately to Jewish groups as part of a new PLO-backed strategy to win
more grass-roots sympathy among Israelis for the Palestinian cause.
   Husseini, a 49-year-old historian from Israeli-annexed East
Jerusalem, has been named as a possible negotiator with Israel for
proposed talks in Egypt on Israel's plan for elections in the
occupied lands.
   He has also spent about 18 months in jail during the
26-month-old Palestinian uprising on allegations of inciting
anti-Israeli unrest.
   In response to a question, Husseini told his audience that
Palestinians could drop the stone-throwing and firebomb attacks if
Israel ends its strong-arm tactics.
   ``If we are offered another path, one of compromise from the
Israelis, and we are allowed to hold non-violent demonstrations
without being attacked by the army, then we will take a different
path. We won't need stones, firebombs or violence,'' Husseini said.
   More than 650 Arabs have been killed by Israelis in the unrest,
and 187 others been slain by fellow Palestinians as alleged
collaborators with Israel. Forty-three Israelis also have died.

<HEAD>Mothers' Milk Contains Natural Tranquilizers, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mothers' milk contains natural
tranquilizers, Swedish researchers reported Wednesday.
   The results could help explain why babies become calm and fall
asleep after breast feeding, said Professor Sven Dencker of
Lillhagens Hospital in Goteborg on Sweden's west coast.
   ``We studied the breast milk of women who were known not to take
benzodiazepine-substances (tranquilizers) and to our suprise we
found that such substances existed anyway,'' he said in a radio
interview.
   Dencker said the quantities were small but existed in all 10
women included in a control group for research on the effects of
tranquilizers on women who breast feed.
   He said research results were being published in the next issue
of the British medical journal Lancet.
   ``It is feasible that this calming effect ... played a greater
role in early history, when a family would be surrounded by wild
animals and it was necessary for survival that children kept
quiet,'' Dencker said.
   The Svenska Dagbladet daily said discovery of natural
tranquilizers in mothers' milk could explain why human cells have
natural receptors for benzodiazepines. The function of the
receptors has been a mystery, it said.

<TEXT>
   Slumdwellers reacting to months of
rampant inflation looted food stores Wednesday despite the efforts
of police and paramilitary border guards to keep order, news
agencies reported.
   Looting began before dawn with attacks on several delivery
trucks and small stores, the government news agency Telam said.
Fifteen arrests were reported.
   Police patroled the streets of Rosario, 185 miles north of
Buenos Aires, all day and the Interior Ministry described the city
as calm and ``absolutely normal'' by late afternoon.
   The private news agency Diarios y Noticias said, however, that
looters appeared at half a dozen stores just before dusk. It said,
quoting police in Rosario, that some of the looters were women and
children, who fled when officers approached.
   ``I felt sorry for them,'' the driver of a truck that was
stopped and looted of tons of flour, sugar, noodles and other food
said on television. ``They looked hungry. ... No one tried to hurt
me. They told me to get out and run. I did.''
   Similar looting in May 1989 grew to riots in which 16 people
were killed, nearly 200 injured and more than 1,700 arrested. Those
disturbances also were centered in Rosario, Argentina's
second-largest city.
   The cost of living soared by 79 percent last month and is
projected at about the same level this month. Wages have not kept
pace and unemployment has grown to 10 percent, with another 10
percent of the 12.5 million workers underemployed.
   In Cordoba on Monday, several dozen women ran through a market
grabbing fruits and vegetables. They were not caught.

<HEAD>Assault on World's Tallest Peak Has New Aims</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first American to scale Mount Everest is
planning another assault 26 years later, this time with a trash bag
on his back and Soviet and Chinese colleagues at his side.
   Jim Whittaker is leading the three-nation ``Peace Climb'' to
celebrate world peace and mark the 20th anniversary of Earth Day.
The 30-person expedition will clean decades of discarded oxygen
bottles and other debris left by previous climbers, he said.
   If all goes as planned, one climber from the United States,
China and the Soviet Union will set foot on the 29,028-foot peak on
April 22.
   Gaining the participation of climbing teams from the Soviet
Union and China, which only recently eased relations after decades
of mutual hostility, took a little shuttle diplomacy, Whittaker
said.
   When he approached the Chinese in 1987, they told him they were
interested but would only invite the Soviets if they knew in
advance the Soviets would say yes. ``They didn't want to lose
face,'' Whittaker said.
   In Moscow, he said, the Soviets told him they would participate
only if they knew for sure they were invited.
   ``They thought the Chinese may be trying to embarrass them,'' he
said.
   So he returned to China, where he finally was told, ``Mr.
Whittaker, you may bring your Soviet friends to our mountain.''
   ``When you get enough people behind a movement _ the environment
and peace _ leaders will get smart and get in front or be
toppled,'' Whittaker said.
   Whittaker said the team members will plant their national flags
and bounce signals off a U.S. space satellite to broadcast live
television footage of the event. Each will speak to their nation's
leader by telephone.
   The idea for the Peace Climb was hatched during a 1981 ascent of
the 14,411-foot Mount Rainier during which Whittaker and two
friends guided several disabled climbers to the summit.
   They wondered what else they could do to make the world a better
place to live, to show that people from entirely different worlds
can work together toward a common goal.
   On the day of the climb, children from several American schools
will climb nearby hills and pick up garbage as they go, Whittaker
said.
   On the Peace Climb, dozens of climbers hauling gear and food
from lower camps to higher camps to support the summit assault will
stop on their way down to fill empty duffels with trash left behind
by climbers over the past seven decades.
   An estimated two tons of discarded tents, empty oxygen bottles,
tin cans and other garbage littering the flanks of Everest will be
buried in a landfill near the base camp at 17,100 feet, team
members said.
   Whittaker, who scaled Everest in 1963 and led the first American
ascent of K-2 in 1978, doesn't plan to try for the summit himself,
preferring to leave that bid to younger and stronger climbers.
   ``An essential ingredient to this is that if one climber
falters, climbers from all three countries will turn back,'' said
Warren Thompson, the expedition's deputy leader. ``It's important
that what we accomplish is accomplished together.''

   The Labor Party Wednesday won a pledge from
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to allow the Cabinet to review U.S.
peace proposals offered at meetings later this week, a Labor
official said.
   Labor's leader, Finance Minister Shimon Peres, also said the
party will quit the coalition government if it rejects a proposal
for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens is scheduled to stop in Washington
for two days after a visit to Mexico. He will meet Secretary of
State James A. Baker III on Friday for a discussion of the stalled
Mideast peace process.
   Shamir, of the right-wing Likud bloc, ordered that no U.S. ideas
be immediately rejected, a senior Labor official said. He said
Shamir acted after his coalition partners in the left-of-center
Labor Party expressed fears that Arens would reject Baker's
proposals without consulting them, the Labor official said.
   The official said Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, also
of Labor, met with Shamir on Wednesday to tell the premier that
Arens ``cannot respond in a negative way to Baker's proposals
regarding issues on which there is no Cabinet decision.''
   ``Shamir is to instruct Arens he should not reject Baker's
proposals but pass them on to the Cabinet,'' the official said.
   He said Labor leaders were satisfied with the decision ``as this
is exactly what they wanted.''
   Shamir aide Avi Pazner would not confirm that any such specific
instructions would be given to Arens. However, he said U.S. ideas
would be passed on to the Cabinet.
   ``Arens is not going to conduct negotiations there,'' Pazner
said.
   Baker has proposed a three-way meeting with foreign ministers of
Israel and Egypt to discuss the peace process and resolve the
differences over the makeup of a Palestinian delegation for
proposed Israeli-Palestinian talks.
   The meeting would be aimed at reviving an Israeli proposal for
elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip as a first step
toward peace.
   Likud and Labor are deeply divided over the issue of Palestinian
representation in peace talks. Labor is ready to give a role to
Palestinian exiles and residents of Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem,
but Likud fears that would provide a back-door entry for the
Palestine Liberation Organization and put Jerusalem on the agenda.
   Official policy is to refuse to talk to the PLO, which Israel
considers a terrorist group.
   Peres said Wednesday that Labor would leave Shamir's government
and try to form a narrow coalition with religious and left-wing
parties if the Cabinet rejects the efforts to begin
Israeli-Palestinian talks.
   ``We have to make up our minds _ clear and now and decisively,''
he said. ``It is really a trying moment in the history of the state
of Israel, and I believe the coming two or three weeks will be of
crucial importance in deciding the destiny of our country.''
   He made the comments in a speech to about 600 delegates to the
Emergency World Jewish Peace Conference in Jerusalem.

<HEAD>Attorney General Approves Joint Operating Agreement in York, Pa.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh approved the
partial merger of the two daily newspapers in York, Pa., Wednesday
under the antitrust exemption of the Newspaper Preservation Act.
   Thornburgh, accepting the recommendation of the Justice
Department's antitrust division, approved the plan to merge the
production and commercial operations of the morning York Daily
Record and the evening York Dispatch.
   Thornburgh found that the Record qualified for a limited
antitrust exemption as a ``failing newspaper'' because it lagged
the Dispatch in both circulation and advertising revenue.
   ``This record reveals no plausible method by which the Record
could maintain its competitive position and its current revenues
while continuing to defer ... long-delayed capital expenditures,''
Thornburgh said in his opinion.
   Thornburgh said there did not appear be any alternatives to a
joint operating agreement ``that would allow the Record to remain
financially as well as editorially independent of the Dispatch.''
   The Record, owned by Buckner News Alliance, has a circulation of
40,408 weekdays and 38,328 on Sundays, according to 1988 figures.
That year the Dispatch, owned by Garden State Newspapers Inc., had
a weekday circulation of 48,310, and the company's Sunday News had
a circulation of 42,482.
   Under the joint operating agreement, the newspapers will
maintain separate reporting staffs and publish separate editions
during the week. The Record will discontinue its Sunday edition but
will produce its own comment section for insertion into the Sunday
News.
   The Dispatch will discontinue its Saturday afternoon edition.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Adviser Says No One Can Prevent Baltic Secession</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Andrei Grachev, an aide to Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, said Wednesday that no one could prevent Lithuania
from seceding from the Soviet Union if it wants to.
   Grachev, deputy chief of the Soviet Communist Party's
international department, was in Paris this week for a series of
conferences on Europe.
   He said the future of the three Baltic republics _ Lithuania,
Estonia and Latvia _ ``is an open question'' and ``should be
debated and resolved in the Soviet parliament.''
   Local elections this weekend in Lithuania are expected to test
the strength of the nationalist movement Sajudis.
   Free debate would convince the citizens of the Baltics that
their future belongs in the federated Soviet Union with power
passed on from Moscow to the separate republics, Grachev said.
   ``But if this discussion doesn't convince the Lithuanian people
that their interest is to remain in a renewed federation, they make
the decision and no one can prevent them from fulfilling it,''
Grachev said.
   Egor Yakovlev, editor in chief of the Moscow News, echoed
Grachev's sentiments at their appearance in a debate held at the
Ecole Centrale de Paris.
   ``An eventual separation of a Baltic republic from the Soviet
Union will be less pain from the point of view of progress and
perestroika than an attempt to keep it by force, by tanks,'' he
said.
   Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were independent states between
World War I and 1940, when they were annexed by the Soviet Union.
They now seek to obtain at least a measure of autonomy from Moscow.

   An hour after the Exxon Valdez struck a
reef causing the nation's worst oil spill, skipper Joseph Hazelwood
said the accident was his fault, an Exxon official testified
Wednesday.
   Paul Myers, now project manager for the 987-foot tanker's
repair, said he telephoned the ship in the early morning hours of
March 24 after being told it had run aground. He said he reached
Hazelwood, who told him oil was in the water and that the ship was
safe.
   ``What did he tell you had happened?'' asked Assistant District
Attrorney Brent Cole.
   ``He indicated the third mate zigged for ice and it went
aground,'' said Myers. ``He said he wasn't on the bridge.''
   ``What else did Captain Hazelwood say?'' asked the prosecutor.
   ``He indicated ... it was his fault. He was to blame,'' Myers
replied. ``He had just gone down to do some paperwork when this
happened and he should have been on the bridge.''
   The witness, who said he was testifying under a grant of
immunity from prosecution, said he thought Hazelwood felt
responsible as the ship's captain. But he was prohibited from
answering a question from the defense on whether Hazelwood was
accepting criminal responsibility.
   The 43-year-old former skipper is charged with second-degree
criminal mischief, a felony; and three misdemeanors: reckless
endangerment, operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent
discharge of oil.
   If convicted, his maximum penalties could be 7\ years in prison
plus $61,000 in fines.
   Earlier Wednesday, another Exxon Valdez skipper testified that
Hazelwood violated a company operating manual in commanding the
tanker, but acknowledged that broke no laws.
   Michael Stalzer, who preceded Hazelwood in commanding the ship
and since has succeeded him as captain, told jurors how Hazelwood
acted against the rules set down in Exxon's bridge manual.
   But during cross-examination by Hazelwood lawyer Dick Madson,
Stalzer conceded the manual was merely a guideline, a statement of
Exxon policies on how to run a tanker.
   During his cross-examination, Stalzer also told jurors for the
first time that Exxon is concerned about the outcome of Hazelwood's
trial.
   He said the company, which has employed him since 1973, is
paying for his lawyer as well as for attorneys representing other
crewmembers who have testified.
   ``I believe Exxon does have an interest in the outcome of this
case,'' he said in response to a question from Madson.
   During questioning by Assistant District Attorney Cole, Stalzer
said he felt the company was interested because Hazelwood was its
employee at the time of the March 24 grounding.
   ``I believe that perhaps the outcome of this case will have an
effect on some of the other pending litigation,'' he added.
   Stalzer, who said he personally followed the Exxon bridge manual
to the letter, described the Exxon Valdez as the newest and
probably most technically advanced of all the tankers in Exxon's
approximately 30-ship fleet.
   He also indicated he would have chosen different staffing than
Hazelwood did for a hazardous passage into Prince William Sound.
   Hazelwood left the ship in control of the third mate 10 minutes
before it grounded, spilling almost 11 million gallons of oil into
the clear waters of Prince William Sound. The disaster killed
countless birds, fish and wildlife and blackened hundreds of miles
of rocky shoreline.
   Stalzer said he would have followed a section of the manual
suggesting that the captain, an officer and a seaman be on the
bridge if hazards existed. He cited ice in the shipping lanes as a
hazard, but acknowledged that captains have the option to interpret
the manual as they see fit.

   Pope John Paul II on Wednesday hailed the
mostly peaceful revolution of Eastern Europe and recalled the
leading role played by the Solidarity Labor movement in his native
Poland.
   The pope's remarks were among reflections dedicated to Jasna
Gora, Roman Catholic Poland's holiest shrine, as part of
preparations for his fourth pilgrimage to his homeland next year.
   Democratic reforms have improved the status of the church in
Eastern Europe, and the Vatican also has announced papal trips to
Czechoslovakia in April and Hungary next year.
   Speaking to about 250 Polish pilgrims at his general audience,
the pope said Wednesday that most of the changes ``happened in a
bloodless fashion with only one painful exception,'' a reference to
Romania.
   The pope recalled the lack of violence in the Solidarity
movement in 1980-81, when the first independent labor movement in
the Soviet bloc was born. He also applauded the peaceful change
last year, when a Solidarity-led government took over from the
Communist Party.

   The Senate Energy Committee on Wednesday
approved President Bush's nomination of a former Battelle
Laboratories nuclear waste expert to supervise the government's
attempt to dispose of radioactive waste from nuclear power plants.
   John W. Bartlett, a chemical and nuclear engineer, won the
committee's unanimous support to be director of the Energy
Department's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management.
   Sens. Richard H. Bryan and Harry Reid, both D-Nev., had objected
to Bartlett because of a technical paper he presented last year
asserting that scientific evidence cannot assure with 100 percent
that any repository site for nculear waste will safely contain the
wastes for 10,000 years.
   Reid interpreted the paper as evidence that Bartlett endorsed
Congress' choice of Yucca Mountain in Nevada three years ago for
the site ``regardless of the scientific consequences.'' Bryan said
it showed Bartlett was ``blatantly biased against Nevada.''
   However, a committee source said Wednesday that veiled threats
by Bryan and Reid to attempt to block Bartlett's nomination on the
Senate floor appear to have dissipated.
   The waste in question is currently stored at power plants.
Nevada is objecting to the federal government's plan to bury it in
Yucca Mountain, if the geology proves acceptable, where it is
supposed to decay undisturbed for thousands of years.
   Also approved unanimously by the committee was Bush's nomination
of former Ohio coal operator Robert H. Gentile to be an assistant
secretary in charge of the Energy Department's fossil fuels program.

<TEXT>
   The AFL-CIO on Wednesday urged the Bush
administration to give the Soviet Union most favored nation status,
which would allow it to benefit from lower trade tariffs.
   The Executive Council of the 14.1 million-member federation,
which traditionally has taken a hardline stance toward the Soviet
Union, said the Soviets should receive the best trade treatment
possible from the United States for a one-year trial period.
   The 33-member board said the status should be subject to
congressional review and ``conditioned on Soviet respect for basic
worker and human rights.''
   The status should be granted separately to the Soviet republics
of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, where there are strong
pro-independence movements, the AFL-CIO said. The United States has
never recognized the incorporation of those three republics into
the Soviet Union.
   ``The AFL-CIO is convinced that reform in the U.S.S.R. is driven
primarily by the crisis afflicting the Soviet economy,'' the labor
leaders said.
   But they said the Soviet eagerness to participate in the world
economy could be used ``as a constructive lever to propel the
process of democratization'' in the Soviet Union.
   Congress prohibited the Soviet Union from receiving the most
favored nation trade status in 1974 with the Jackson-Vanik
amendment, a retaliation for the prohibition of immigration of
Soviet Jews and other dissidents.
   Because of that amendment, U.S. tariffs on Soviet goods can be
10 times as high as products from other countries.
   Soviet immigration policies have eased over the last year, and
President Bush has said he would consider granting the improved
trade status to the Soviet Union if it liberalizes its immigration
policies.
   At December's Malta summit, Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev said they would try to have a new trade treaty ready by
their scheduled June meeting in Washington. Trade talks between
both sides began last week.
   Also Wednesday, as labor leaders spent much of their closed-door
session debating international affairs, they offered their harshest
criticism so far of Bush's policy on China following that
government's bloody crackdown in Tiananmen Square last summer.
   AFL-CIO leaders said Bush _ by vetoing legislation to protect
Chinese students in the United States and sending high-level
emissaries to Beijing _ had undermined ``America's leading position
in the world as a defender of human rights.''
   The China statement came as the federation's board awarded
Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi the federation's George Meany Human
Rights Award.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland distributed a letter that Lizhi,
who has been in refuge at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing since July,
sent after learning he would receive the award.
   ``Today is a very cold day in Beijing. The heartening news sent
from you is like a burning coal to warm both my body and spirit,''
Lizhi wrote.

   President Bush hailed exiled Soviet conductor
Mstislav Rostropovich as ``a national treasure'' on Wednesday as he
welcomed the National Symphony home from its tour of the Soviet
Union.
   ``Your orchestra's long-awaited trip to the Soviet Union
reflects the drama of our changing world,'' Bush told Rostropovich
at a White House reception.
   The president noted that Rostropovich had received ``ovation
after ovation'' on his just-completed tour of the homeland he had
been forced to leave in disgrace in 1974. Bush said the conductor
and cello virtuoso had returned ``to a place he never really left''
in the Soviet tour.
   Rostropovich was stripped of his Soviet citizenship in 1978. He
got in trouble with the communist authorities at the time for his
vigorous defense of out-of-favor author Alexander Solzhenitsyn.
   His Soviet citizenship was restored last month and he was given
an official apology under political reforms undertaken by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Bush said the conductor of the Washington-based National
Symphony was ``inded a national treasure and America is very proud
of you.''
   Before an audience that included members of the orchestra,
Soviet Ambassador Yuri V. Dubinin and industrialist Armand Hammer,
Bush said: ``Maestro, you are a true virtuoso, not only of music
but of the heart and mind as well.''
   Rostropovich then led a string section of 12 cellos in a
performance of a work named ``Dodecacelli'' by American composer
David Ott.

   Medical experts announced plans Wednesday for
a week-long, nationwide educational campaign aimed at stopping the
use of snuff and chewing tobacco among young people.
   The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery
Inc. said the ``Through with Chew Week'' campaign, which begins
Sunday, is designed to educate teen-agers about the health risks of
smokeless tobacco _ including life-threatening cancers of the mouth
and throat.
   ``Our goal is to alert the public to the senseless risks of
smokeless tobacco,'' Dr. Jerome Goldstein, the academy's executive
vice president, told a news conference.
   The academy represents physicians who specialize in the medical
and surgical treatment of health problems of the ear, nose, threat,
head and neck.
   Goldstein estimated that 12 million people _ including 3 million
under the age of 21 _ use snuff and chewing tobacco. Most users are
male, he said.
   Among males ages 17-19, snuff use increased 15-fold and chewing
tobacco use grew more than four-fold from 1970 to 1986, according
to the 1989 surgeon general's report on smoking.
   The British government has decided to ban oral snuff, which is
powdered tobacco held in one place in the mouth for an extended
period, because of the growing weight of medical and scientific
evidence that it causes oral cancer and other diseases.
   The ban is intended ``to nip the new habit in the bud,'' said
Andrew Health, first secretary in the British Embassy.
   As part of the campaign announced Wednesday, the academy and the
National Federation of State High School Associations are
distributing a 10-minute video to all public and private high
schools. The video outlines the social and health risks of
smokeless tobacco use.
   Most of the 30,000 cases of oral cancers diagnosed in the United
States annually are linked to tobacco, said Dr. Roy Sessions,
chairman of the department of otolaryngology and head and neck
surgery at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington.
   About 40 percent of people with oral cancer will die from the
disease within five years of such a diagnosis, he said.
   He also said studies have shown smokeless tobacco is a more
difficult habit to kick than smoking.

   Members of a white supremacist group plotted to
put poison gas into a synagogue's air conditioning system as part
of their hate campaign, a former member of the group testified
Wednesday.
   The allegation came in early testimony during the trial of five
``skinheads,'' so-called because of their closely shaved heads.
   Members of a faction called the Confederate Hammerskins, they
are charged with violating the civil rights of Jews by defacing a
synagogue. Three are additionally accused of civil rights
violations by allegedly chasing blacks and Hispanics from a Dallas
park.
   On trial are Sean Christian Tarrant, 20, of Dallas; Jon Lance
Jordan, 19, of Garland; Michael Lewis Lawrence, 22, of Tulsa,
Okla.; Christopher Barry Greer, 25, of Irving, and Daniel Alvis
Wood, 20, of Dallas. Greer, Tarrant and Jordan are charged in the
park attacks.
   A former Hammerskin, Gordon Gene Buchanan, testified Wednesday
that Wood had discussed putting cyanide gas in the air conditioning
system of the Temple Shalom. He said he accompanied Jordan, Tarrant
and Wood to the temple on an August night in 1988.
   He said he saw Jordan and Wood near building's the air
conditioning units but could not see what they were doing.
   Dan L. Kraus of Temple Shalom testified a number of the
synagogue's members discussed leaving the congregation after the
1988 vandalism that included spray-painted anti-Semitic graffiti,
and gunshots that riddled walls and broke windows.
   One piece of graffiti said, ``6 million more,'' referring to the
Holocaust of Nazi Germany, when millions of Jews were gassed in
concentration camps.
   Another slogan said: ``6 million more, this time we'll do it
right.''
   Buchanan also testified said that, about July 1988, Tarrant
chased and kicked a black man at Robert E. Lee Park while Greer and
other youths followed, repeatedly yelling racial slurs.
   One black man, Alexis Charles Newton of Dallas, testified
Wednesday that he was chased from the park by a gang of 12 to 15
white youths, some with closely shaved heads.
   ``The first reaction was fear. I was scared. I knew what could
happen if they caught me,'' he said.
   Prosecutors have said that the skinheads believed the park,
named after a Confederate general, was a symbol of white supremacy
that should not have been frequented by non-whites.
   The group had heard that the NAACP was seeking to have the park
renamed in 1988, Buchanan said. To show their disapproval, Greer
suggested that the Hammerskins go to the park, put up racial
notices, and ``patrol the area,'' Buchanan said.
   He said he accompanied the group to the park about five times
during that summer. But Buchanan said he got into an argument with
Wood over a girl and was kicked out of the group in September 1988.
   Leon Carter, a black attorney representing Jordan, warned jurors
not to let emotion overtake them.
   ``There will be things in this trial that will inflame and
excite you. There will be fliers, writings on the wall and other
things that will get your emotions up,'' Carter said. ``But once
you have ridden that crest of emotion, I ask you to look closely at
the case and look to your reason and not emotion.''
   Attorney General Richard Thornburgh said after the indictments
were issued in September that prosecution of racial hate crimes is
a priority of the Justice Department.
   Each of the federal charges carries up to 10 years in prison and
a $250,000 fine.
   Wood already has been sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined
$5,000 by a state judge after admitting he sprayed swastikas and
anti-Semitic slogans at the synagogue.
   Eleven other Hammerskins associates were charged previously;
three out of five adults and four of six juveniles pleaded guilty.
   Security on the courtroom floor was tighter than usual. Visitors
were asked to empty their pockets for inspection.

   At Israel's request, Secretary of State James
A. Baker III will meet Friday with Foreign Minister Moshe Arens in
a renewed effort to open Mideast negotiations.
   The objective is to set up talks between Israel and Palestinian
Arabs on an Israeli election plan for the West Bank and Gaza.
   That has been Baker's goal for several months, but he has made
little visible headway. The meeting with Arens, who will come here
after a visit to Mexico, was announced Wednesday by Margaret D.
Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman.
   She said Baker had no immediate plan to hold a similar session
with Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid. But in response
to questions, Ms. Tutwiler said Robert Pelletreau Jr., the U.S.
ambassador to Tunisia, met Tuesday with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Ms. Tutwiler declined to provide any details of the conversation.
   The United States opened talks with the PLO 14 months ago after
chairman Yasser Arafat publicly renounced terrorism and said he
accepted Israel's existence.
   With Arens, the spokeswoman said, Baker obviously will be trying
to ``move the process forward'' and to set up a three-way
subsequent meeting with Meguid.
   Israel has proposed an election for Palestinian Arabs on the
West Bank and Gaza to chose negotiators to work out a formula for
limited self-rule in the territories.
   The PLO opposes Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's plan as a device
to block establishment of a Palestinian state on Israeli land. The
plan has Baker's support.
   In another development, spokeswoman Tutwiler said Egypt was ``a
leading candidate'' to receive an unspecified number of U.S. M-60A1
tanks that no longer are needed in Western Europe. She said Israel
had turned down a similar opportunity.
   Pentagon officials said 700 tanks were involved. Their value
when new was $1.4 million apiece or $980 million in all. The
officials said they tanks were being replaced by newer and more
powerful M-1 Abrams tanks.
   Ms. Tutwiler's office said Egypt or whoever gets the tanks will
not have to pay for them, but will have to pay transportation costs.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies
and Congress would be consulted. It was not immediately clear if
Congress would have the power to block transfer of the tanks as it
would a military sale.
   Ms. Tutwiler said Egypt would use the tanks to replacing
Soviet-built tanks, with no net increase in its arsenal of the
weapons.

<HEAD>Tough Measures in Store for Desert Poachers In Oman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MEREDITH CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MUSCAT, Oman (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservation officials on Wednesday said
they will crack down on desert poachers who smuggle rare animal and
bird species out of Oman for sale.
   ``Offenders will face six-month jail sentences and fines of up
to 900 rials for contravening environmental laws,'' conservation
department spokesman Yousuf al-Baloushi said. The fine is
equivalent to $2,320.
   He said the action follows the jailing in December of four Omani
tribesmen caught trucking Arabian gazelles over the United Arab
Emirates border. They were convicted under environmental
legislation banning the hunting of endangered species and are
serving six-month jail terms, Baloushi said.
   He added, ``We believe they were part of an organized gang
operating in the desert. Investigations are presently under way to
find out exactly what has been going on.''
   Baloushi said other prime targets included the Nubian ibex and
the Houbara bird, known biologically as the MacQueen's Bustard, a
resident breeder the size of a goose.
   Poachers catch them live and export them to neighboring
countries, where they fetch a good price, he said.
   ``It appears there is a ready market for rare species like
gazelles, which are said to fetch around 500 rials ($1,300) apiece
for private zoos,'' Baloushi said.
   He said the Arabian white oryx was not threatened. This beast
was extinct in the wild until it was reintroduced to the stony Oman
central desert preserve at Yalooni in the Jiddat al Harasis.
   ``The range wardens in the Jiddat are active and the oryx are
well guarded and protected. Elsewhere, though, we are bolstering
our conservation patrol efforts,'' Baloushi said.
   ``If we do not act now it will be too late. We are talking here
about species of animal and bird that are almost extinct, existing
only in Oman. It is a lobal issue in that respect.''
   Government notices, published in the local press on the orders
of Oman's ruler, Sultan Qaboos, warned that the hunting of rare
birds, deer and other wildlife was prohibited.
   The notices said police would maintain strict border
surveillance to apprehend violators.

<HEAD>China Tells Japan It Will Spare Life of Chinese Hijacker: Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China says it will spare the life of a Chinese
hijacker if Japan extradites him to face charges for forcing an Air
China jetliner to Japan in December, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
   The Mainichi Shimbun newspaper said the assurance was made
recently to Japanese judicial authorities.
   Zhang Zhenhai, 35, suffered a broken pelvis during the hijacking
on Dec. 16 and is being treated while under detention in Tokyo. No
one else was hurt.
   His three Japanese lawyers said last month that Zhang would face
the death penalty if sent back to China.
   The newspaper said China would try Zhang under Article 107 of
its criminal law concerning charges such as demolition or
subversion of aircraft, trains, cars and ships. The law stipulates
up to 10 years imprisonment, the paper reported.
   It reported that China also said ``no proof'' existed that Zhang
took part in pro-democracy demonstrations in Tienanmen Square last
June as he told Japanese officials.
   Justice Ministry officials refused to comment on the report.
   Zhang, of Heibei province, hijacked the Chinese airliner with
223 people aboard on a flight from Beijing to New York. The plane
flew to Fukuoka, in western Japan, after South Korea refused to let
it land.
   The plane was returned to China the next day with 208 passengers
aboard, including Zhang's wife and 13-year-old son. China has told
Japan the two will not be tried for criminal activity, officials in
Tokyo have said.
   Zhang said he was seeking political asylum, but Japanese
officials have said that even if that were true, hijacking is a
serious crime and he will be handed over when China makes its
formal request.

<TEXT>
   Crackdowns in China and Cuba drew strong
criticism from the State Department in its annual human rights
report to Congress on Wednesday in contrast to praise for ``a
remarkable opening of the political process'' in the Soviet Union.
   The human rights situation on the West Bank and in Gaza, where
Palestinian Arabs are in the 27th month of an uprising against
Israeli control, was described as ``a source of deep concern.''
   Assistant Secretary Richard Schifter, the principal compiler of
the 1,641-page document, contrasted suppression in China with giant
human-rights advances in Eastern Europe.
   He told a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee that the crackdown
on pro-democracy forces in China last year ``put into reverse, in
very short order, much of the significant movement toward a more
open society which had taken place in China during the last 10
years.''
   There was no indication, however, that the Bush administration
was about to harden its policy toward China, which several members
of Congress have likened to kid-gloves treatment. Schifter said the
United States must maintain ties to Beijing in order to bring about
improvements.
   In Cuba, meanwhile, the report said President Fidel Castro ``has
taken or fabricated opportunities to harass, detain or imprison''
50 human rights advocates while the Marxist government ``silenced
many of its leading domestic critics.''
   The picture in the Soviet Union was brighter. Under President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the report said, ``the past year witnessed a
remarkable opening up of the political process and improvements in
human rights practices.''
   Still, the report said, the Soviet Union ``has a considerable
distance to go before it will meet the standards set forth in the
Helsinki Final Act'' of 1975, a 35-nation pledge to foster human
rights, in which Moscow joined.
   Though the top leadership no longer fosters anti-Semitism and
appears embarrassed by it, ``there has been a sharp increase in
popular expressions of anti-Semitic attitudes,'' the report said.
``Jews have been increasingly concerned over the danger of
violence.''
   Schifter, in presenting the worldwide findings, said the
``specter of totalitarianism is at long last disappearing from
Europe.'' He added: ``As of today, Albania is the only relic of the
age of Hitler and Stalin left intact in Europe.''
   And yet, as a whole, the report sketched a gloomy globe.
   From beheadings and amputations in Saudi Arabia to student
detentions in Liberia and to disappearances in El Salvador, the
document catalogued man's inhumanity to man in virtually every
conceivable way.
   It said:
   _Pro-democracy demonstrators were gunned down in the area of
Beijing's Tiananmen Square last June, and independent observers
were cited as challenging the official toll of 20 executions as
unrealistically low.
   _In Myanmar, formerly Burma, men forced to walk ahead of army
troops in mine-infested fields were blown up.
   _In Iran, prisoners were flogged and suspended from the ceiling,
according to eyewitnesses and human rights groups.
   _In Iraq, effective opposition to government policy was stifled
and intelligence services engaged in extensive surveillance.
   ``The freedoms of speech and press and of assembly and
association are virtually nonexistent,'' the report said of Iraq.
``Other important human rights problems include continuing
disappearances and arbitrary detentions, lack of fair trial,
widespread interference with privacy, excessive use of force
against Kurdish civilians and an almost total lack of worker
rights.''
   Israel, a democracy, came in for little criticism. But there was
concern about the occupied West Bank and Gaza.
   A total of 432 Palestinians were reported killed in 1989 _ 304
by Israeli security forces and settlers and 128 by other
Palestinians.
   While the Israeli defense forces engaged in a severe crackdown,
the report cited a significant increase in Palestinian violence
against Palestinians, spurred by a growing Islamic fundamentalist
Hamas movement.
   Israeli government guidelines to restrict use of force were
violated and prosecution resulted only in a ``relatively small
number of such incidents,'' the report said.
   James Zogby, executive director of the Arab American Institute,
called the report a brutal indictment of Israeli occupation, said
pro-Israel groups applied pressure to mute the criticism and said
Congress should either cut the $3 billion in aid to Israel or make
it conditional on an improved record.
   Sheldon D. Comay, president of the American Jewish Committee,
noted that only 21 pages of the report dealt with Israel and said,
``The disproportionate media attention to these pages unwittingly
attets to the especially high standards by which Israel is judged.''
   In Jerusalem, Moshe Raviv, the deputy director general of the
foreign ministry, said U.S. criticism of Israel's handling of
Palestinian human rights failed to take into account that Israel
was reacting to violence by Palestinians.
   Rep. Gus Yatron, D-Pa., chairman of the House human rights
subcommittee, complimented the State Department for a report that
``pulls no punches in assessing dismal human rights records of such
dictatorial regimes as China and Iraq.''
   Yatron challenged the Bush administration to match the rhetoric
of the annual review with ``a policy which places America's
commitment to human rights and democratic institutions above
offending ruthless regimes, which the administration is currently
seeking to curry favor.''
   His statement reflected Congressional criticism of President
Bush as imposing only limited sanctions against China.
   The report found a dramatic deterioration in the human rights
climate in China in 1989. Apart form the Beijing crackdown, the
army killed scores of Tibetans in March in Lhasa and reports of
torture of persons accused of ``counterrevolutionary crimes'' are
persistent and consistent, it said.
   James O'Dea, director of the Washington office of Amnesty
International, a worldwide human rights organization, said there
were up to 10,000 people in prison, and that secret U.S. missions
and private diplomacy had not improved conditions.
   In Saudi Arabia, capital punishment is meted out for a wide
variety of crimes. Beheading is the usual method of execution and,
in some cases, it was followed by public crucifixion. In the first
10 months of 1989, at least 13 thieves had their hands severed,
including 11 non-Saudis, the report says.
   Nicaragua's Sandinista government, which faces national
elections on Sunday, is sharply criticized for maintaining ``an
extensive and repressive internal security apparatus'' that
includes surveillance and infiltration of the political opposition.

<TEXT>
   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
issued a stay Wednesday to halt the scheduled execution of a man
convicted in the slaying of a convenience store clerk whose body
was tossed over a cliff.
   The high court granted the stay of Thursday's execution pending
the outcome of a federal case challenging the use of the death
sentence against retarded inmates, a spokeswoman in Austin said.
   Attorneys for Carl Kelly, 30, of Waco contended psychological
evidence that could have swayed the jurors was not introduced at
his trial.
   Kelly faced lethal injection for the 1980 robbery, abduction and
murder of Steven Pryor, 18, of Waco. Also killed was David Wade
Riley, a transient who had been asleep in Pryor's car.
   Pryor and Riley were taken to Waco's Cameron Park in Pryor's car
and shot to death. Their bodies were then tossed over a 60-foot
cliff onto the banks of the Bosque River.
   Kelly's companion, Thomas Graves, then 20, pleaded guilty to
both killings, as well as to the slaying of a third man the
previous day. Graves, of Waco, received a life prison term.
   Kelly insisted on a trial, was convicted and received the death
sentence.
   Graves was arrested the morning after the killings driving
Pryor's bloodstained car. Kelly's billfold was found in the car.
   Kelly and Graves got about $30 in the robbery. Kelly has said he
was on drugs at the time of the incident.
   The U.S. Supreme Court last July refused to hear an appeal of
Kelly's case. Lawyers for Kelly could ask the court for another
hearing.
   Two other Texas death row inmates, Ronald Keith Allridge and
Mikel Derrick, also had executions scheduled for early Thursday
that were delayed. The Court of Criminal Appeals earlier this month
granted Allridge a stay, and State District Judge Michael McSpadden
of Houston reset Derrick's execution for March 22, according to
appellate court spokesman Rick Wetzel.
   Allridge was sentenced to be executed for the March 25, 1985,
murder of Carla McMillen Otto during a restaurant robbery in Fort
Worth. Derrick was sentenced for the stabbing death of Edward
Sonnier at the victim's Houston home on Oct. 11, 1980.

<HEAD>Court Limits OMB's Power to Change Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Office of Management and Budget may not
block or change government regulations through its power to reduce
paperwork requirements for private businesses, the Supreme Court
ruled Wednesday.
   The decision, a victory for labor unions, means that employers
at certain multi-employer job sites must obey rules of the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration requiring notice to
workers of the dangers of certain consumer products used on the job.
   The OMB's power over government regulations has been contested
by congressional committees and advocacy groups, especially
environmentalists, for several years. But the court said it was not
ruling on their broad concerns _ only OMB actions under the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.
   On a 7-2 vote, the court held that the act ``does not give OMB
the authority to review agency rules mandating disclosure by
regulated entities to third parties,'' in the words of the majority
opinion by Justice William J. Brennan.
   Brennan said the court was leaving undecided whether other rules
``might legitimately be subject to OMB review.''
   The dissenters, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice
Byron R. White dissented, said the court should defer to OMB's
interpretation of the law.
   The rules at issue were adopted by the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration in 1983 to inform workers about the dangers
of being exposed to hazardous materials.
   The OMB, an arm of the White House, objected four years later,
saying the multi-employer rules were unnecessary to protect
employees and merely added to employers' paperwork.
   The United Steelworkers union and others sued over the OMB
action, and the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled that the OMB lacked the power to order a substantive
change in another agency's rules.
   Wednesday's decision upheld the 3rd Circuit ruling.
   The justices last May refused to hear appeals by the
construction and feed grain industries that objected coming under
regulations for disclosing information on hazardous materials to
workers.
   The 1983 rules originally were imposed only on manufacturers,
but the federal government later was ordered to extend the rules to
non-manufacturing businesses.
   In 1981, President Reagan issued an executive order expanding an
earlier order by President Carter giving OMB the power to review
agency regulations, which have the force of law.
   Reagan's order gives OMB, to the extent not forbidden by law or
court decisions, the power to hold up regulations until agencies
satisfy OMB analysts that what they propose to do will be the most
cost-effective course possible.
   In the Reagan administration, advocacy groups charged the OMB
frequently went beyond its mandate in imposing its views.

contributing to the ``genocide'' of the tribe.
   Deputy Attorney General Carlos Mucci told a House session Sarney
and five Cabinet ministers were permitting the devastation of the
Yanomamis, the world's largest primitive tribe, and so were guilty
of ``crimes of responsibility.''
   In an interview, Mucci said further, ``The Yanomamis situation
is worse that what is reported. The government is contributing to
the quasi-genocide.''
   Despite protests by environmentalists, Sarney signed a decree on
Friday creating the Uraricoera and Catrimani mining areas in the
northwestern jungle state of Roraima, near the Venezuelan border.
   The areas, totaling about 1 million acres, border the
mineral-rich Yanomami reserves and are claimed by the tribe.
   Mucci, head of a Justice Department committee on Indian rights,
said Sarney violated the constitution and a judicial order by
giving about 40,000 miners two tracts of national park land in
exchange for the prospectors' promise to leave the Yanomami reserve.
   Mucci said only Congress could authorize the location of mining
sites and the type of minerals to be extracted on national forest
land.
   He threatened to bring charges against the ministers of justice,
health, interior, air force and mines and energy for co-signing the
decree.
   A House vote on the charges is expected this week. Further
action would be up to the Senate.
   When the compromise with the miners was announced last month,
Justice Department spokesman Vinicius Becker said, ``This is the
peaceful solution to the problem. There will be no shock or
confrontation.''
   Sarney, a civilian, took office in 1985, ending 21 years of
military rule. He will be succeeded by President-elect Fernando
Collor de Mello for a five-year term on March 15.
   ``There is time for the legislature to adopt a position before
March 15. It all depends on political will,'' Mucci said.
   A clandestine gold rush to the Yanomami territory began in 1987,
after government studies indicated a wealth of gold, tin, bauxite
and diamonds on Yanomami land.
   Since then, the prospectors have destroyed rain forests, chased
off fish and game, polluted rivers with mercury used in gold
panning and spread venereal disease and tuberculosis among the
peaceful tribe.
   Brazil's Roman Catholic Church says at least 1,500 Yanomamis of
the 9,000-member tribe have died of malnutrition, malaria and
venereal diseases since the invasion began.
   Under international pressure, the government last month
announced a $4 million campaign to expel the prospectors, by force
if necessary.
   But shortly after, it offered the miners three tracts of virgin
Amazon rain forest near the reserve to avoid a bloodbath with the
heavily armed miners.
   The National Indian Office says it fears the Yanomami tribe,
which once claimed 23 million acres of Brazil's northwestern Amazon
territory, could be wiped out by further intrusions.
   Over the years, the government carved up the Yanomamis claim,
leaving them 19 scattered reservations totaling 5 million acres. It
declared the rest national parks and forests.
   About 220,000 native Indians are left in Brazil. There were an
estimated 5 million when the Portuguese first landed here in 1500.
   Environmentalists say the miners will spill off into Indian
reservations in neighboring Amazon states and decimate other tribes.

   Doctors for 12-year-old Stormie Jones, the
world's first recipient of a heart-liver transplant, spent more
than nine hours Wednesday trying to stop internal bleeding that
began after her second liver transplant.
   A team of surgeons reconstructed a connection they made between
the donor liver's hepatic artery, one of the main arteries of the
liver, and Stormie's hepatic artery. Part of the connection had
given way, the doctor said.
   ``She had bleeding from one of her suture lines, the arterial
suture line,'' said Dr. Andreas Tzakis, the surgeon who headed the
operation. ``We fixed it by reconstructing the arterial blood
supply to the liver.''
   Stormie's second operation in two days began about 8:50 a.m. and
ended shortly after 6 p.m., hospital officials said.
   Tzakis said he remained optimistic about Stormie's recovery.
``The liver looks good and we expect her to recover promptly,'' he
said.
   During the procedure, doctors checked all other possible sources
of bleeding to try prevent further problems, he said. Internal
bleeding occurs in about 10 percent of all patients receiving a
second transplant, Tzakis said.
   Doctors suspected internal bleeding when the girl's blood
pressure started dropping about 8 p.m. Tuesday, seven hours after
her transplant ended.
   Stormie had regained consciousness and was listed in critical
condition in the hospital's intensive care unit.
   She did not appear to be distressed at the news she would
require more surgery, Tzakis said.
   ``She's determined to make it no matter what,'' he said.
   Stormie's stepfather, Alan Purcell, 27, said the girl's attitude
has helped other members of the family.
   ``How can we get down, when she stays up?' he said during a news
conference held after Wednesday's surgery.
   Doctors decided Feb. 13 that Stormie, a resident of the Fort
Worth, Texas, suburb of White Settlement, needed a new liver. Her
first transplanted liver had been permanently damaged by hepatitis
caused by an unknown virus.
   In White Settlement, Stormie's classmates at Brewer Middle
School were praying Wednesday that she would recover, said the
principal, Homer Dear.
   ``The students are thinking: `She's tough, she can handle it,
and she's going to come back to us,''' Dear said, adding that the
youngsters were trying to raise money to help pay for Stormie's
latest surgery.
   Stormie had asked for a new liver in November because she was
tired of problems with her health, according to her mother, Lois
``Suzie'' Purcell, 33.
   Symptoms of liver inflammation began to appear as early as four
months ago, but Stormie became especially ill two weeks ago,
suffering from weakness, jaundice and itchiness, her parents said.
   Her heart remained healthy and was not affected by the hepatitis.
   Stormie's first transplanted liver had shown some evidence of
rejection in November, Tzakis said. The problem, however, seemed to
clear up after doctors began administering FK-506, a new,
experimental Japanese anti-rejection drug.
   The girl and her family _ her mother, stepfather and her
16-year-old sister, Misty _ arrived in Pittsburgh for the
transplant Monday evening.
   Stormie received a new heart and liver at Children's on Feb. 14,
1984, to control a condition in which her cholesterol level was 10
times higher than normal. Her cholesterol levels have since
decreased to nearly normal, Tzakis said.
   Dr. Thomas Starzl replaced the girl's heart and liver with those
of a 4-year-old girl who had died in a New York car accident.
   Before the first transplant, Stormie suffered two heart attacks
and underwent two triple coronary bypass operations.

<HEAD>Judge Replaced in McMartin Preschool Molestation Retrial</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   LOS ANGELES _ William Pounders, the judge who presided for three
years over the McMartin preschool molestation trial, will not take
charge of the retrial of defendant Raymond Buckey, a Superior Court
judge ruled Wednesday.
   Judge Michael R. Hoff ruled that Buckey's retrial on 13 child
molestation counts will be assigned to another judge to be
identified later. A hearing on the matter was scheduled for Monday.
   Pounders had scheduled a new trial for March 9. It was not
immediately known how his removal would affect that date.
   Defense attorneys moved for Pounders' dismissal after he gave
media interviews following the first trial of Buckey and his
mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey.
   Defense counsel Danny Davis also argued Pounders was biased
because he had disallowed some attorneys' fees. But Hoff, in
reassigning the case, did not find Pounders was biased toward
either side.
   Instead, Hoff said that Pounders' post-trial interviews could
interfere with jury selection for the new proceedings.
   ``The judge knows what he said and what he meant by his remarks
but would be placed in the impossible position of interpreting what
the prospective juror thought about those remarks and perhaps the
judge himself,'' Hoff said.
   Pounders said he concurred with the decision. ``I'm finally free
after three years and three months,'' Pounders said. ``The only
problem is I won't see the case through to its conclusion.''
   In legal papers filed Feb. 8, Pounders said he publicly
commented on the case so he could defend the judicial system and
the jurors. He said he had denied some of Davis' legal fees because
they were excessive.
   Buckey and his mother were found innocent of 52 counts of child
molestation and conspiracy. The jury deadlocked on the 13
additional counts involving Buckey.

   Maoist guerrillas ambushed an army convoy in
the Andes Mountains on Wednesday and two soldiers and two rebels
were killed in the ensuing gun battle, officials said.
   In other violence, police in Lima said six Shining Path rebels
shot to death an explosives company executive and his assistant
near the company's plant.
   A military spokesman in Tarma, a highland city 90 miles
northeast of Lima, said soldiers captured four rebels who were
wounded in the mountain ambush.
   The battle occurred before dawn Wednesday when a column of
Shining Path guerrillas attacked the convoy on a road near the
village of Pian, about 10 miles east of Tarma, the spokesman said
on condition of anonymity.
   Lima police said the two businessmen were killed Tuesday
afternoon in an ambush near the Famesa company plant, 20 miles
north of Lima.
   Police said Juan Chacaltana, the company's director of
industrial relations, and his assistant Ricardo Cruces were driving
away from the plant and had stopped at a store when two men shot
them.
   Police said they did not know the motive for the killing, but
that Chacaltana's family said he had received death threats from
the guerrillas.
   The Shining Path began battling Peru's elected governments in
1980. The government says more than 17,500 people have died in the
violence, including police, soldiers, rebels, government officials
and civilians.

   Barnes &amp; Noble College Bookstores agreed
Wednesday to remove two branch managers from a store at Brandeis
University after more than a week of student boycotts provoked by
alleged racial harassment.
   Alan Kahn, president of the New York-based bookstore chain,
agreed to relocate a manager and an assistant manager in the wake
of allegations that several black students were unduly scrutinized
while shopping at the campus store.
   Student activist Johnny Williams, a graduate sociology student,
said he and other demonstrators would abandon their boycott
Wednesday because ``Barnes &amp; Noble has treated our claims with
concern and fairness and we applaud them for their sincere
response.''
   Lawrence Holcomb, also a graduate sociology student, spurred the
boycott with a letter published Feb. 6 in the independent campus
newspaper, The Justice, in which he charged the store managers had
harassed him and his companions and suspected them of theft because
they were black.
   ``We believe that our experiences have been validated by this
statement,'' Holcomb said at a news conference Wednesday. ``Until
we recognize racial harassment for what it is our society will
continue to believe that there is not a problem.''
   Students who demonstrated at the bookstore throughout the week
have demanded other changes designed to improve race relations at
the campus, where 77 of about 3,200 students are black.
   The list of demands includes establishing a racial harassment
policy, recruiting black students and faculty, altering the core
curriculum to introduce more courses with a non-European
orientation, and developing an intercultural center.

   Several thousand pounds of wet concrete fell from
a construction site onto a downtown street Wednesday, crushing a
cab driver to death, authorities said.
   The cab driver, 55-year-old Choong Soo In of Chicago, was
pronounced dead on arrival at Northwestern Memorial Hospital at
1:26 p.m., said Chicago Police Sgt. Norbert Holzinger.
   Holzinger said a crane operator working at a hotel construction
site had trouble while hoisting a bucket filled with about 6,000
pounds of wet concrete to the rooftop of the building.
   As the crane operator tried to lower the bucket to the floor
where it was to be poured, the bucket started going too fast.
   ``He tried to stop it and reverse it,'' Holzinger said. ``The
bucket hit the edge of the lower roof and spilled.''
   The cab, which was crushed by the wet concrete, sideswiped three
other vehicles before coming to a stop, Holzinger said. The wet
concrete covered several vehicles.
   ``At this time, we're treating it as an accident,'' Holzinger
said.

   Cuba on Wednesday accused the United
States of using the anti-drug fight as an excuse for trampling the
rights of other nations.
   Speaking at a special U.N. session on narcotics, Foreign Affairs
Minister Isidoro Malmierca of Cuba also said his country supports
international efforts to halt the illegal drug trade. However, the
offensive must focus on reducing consumption and offering economic
aid to poor countries where the narcotics are produced, he said.
   ``We shall support resolutely the international cooperation to
combat drug trafficking and related activities, but at the same
time we shall be on the alert and oppose any action or mechanism
which could be used to violate the borders of our nations, our
sovereignty and territorial integrity,'' Malmierca said.
   He described the U.S. invasion of Panama in December and the
U.S. Coast Guard's firing on a Cuban-chartered freighter on Jan. 31
as ``two criminal acts under the same pretext: the so-called combat
against drug trafficking.''
   The United States said it invaded Panama to oust military leader
Manuel Antonio Noriega and bring him back to the United States to
stand trial on drug charges.
   American officials say the U.S. cutter fired on the freighter
when the crew refused to allow a search of the vessel and U.S.
authorities suspected it was involved in illegal narcotics
trafficking. No one was reported injured.
   ``The United States does not have to deploy aircraft carriers or
paratroopers in other countries in order to combat the cultivation
and transport of that drug to the consumer centers,'' Malmierca
said.
   Earlier Wednesday, China's deputy health minister, Gu Yingqi,
said world efforts to fight drug trafficking must include
safeguards to protect the sovereignty of all nations.
   Gu said no country should ``threaten other countries with force,
even armed invasion, under the excuse of fighting drugs or carrying
out international cooperation for drug control.''
   He said heightened international efforts to halt the illegal
drug trade led to recent violations of the rights of some
countries. He was not specific.
   Britain and Pakistan, two nations facing mounting problems from
the illegal drug trade, said regional and global attacks on
trafficking and consumption must be coordinated to end the
narcotics plague.
   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd called it ``a problem of
nightmare proportions.''
   Pakistani representative Kalim Dil Khan said that despite
increased efforts to eliminate illegal narcotics production in
southern Asia, drug abuse and crimes linked to the illicit trade
increased there.
   Khan, federal secretary of Pakistan's Narcotics Control
Ministry, told the session, ``The loss of human lives resulting
from drug trafficking and abuse is also increasing. That shows that
something has gone wrong somewhere in our global strategy.''

<TEXT>
   About 400 people gathered Wednesday at the site
of Malcolm X's assassination to mark the 25th anniversary of his
death and to protest the planned demolition of the building.
   The black leader was shot to death Feb. 21, 1965, while giving a
speech in the Audubon Ballroom in upper Manhattan. Under a 1987
agreement by the city, the state and Columbia University, the badly
deteriorated structure will be torn down to make way for the
university's biotechnology research building.
   In its heyday in the 1930s and 1940s, the ballroom was a
showcase for big bands.
   ``It is a very historical site for the black community,'' said
Colette Pean of the group which organized Wednesday's rally.
``Twenty-five years after Malcolm's death, his message of
self-determination for black people is now more important than
ever.''
   Columbia says it has worked closely with the local community,
which is largely Hispanic, in developing the biotechnology project,
and consulted with leaders of the black community, including
Malcolm X's widow, Dr. Betty Shabazz, about what might be the most
fitting memorial.
   Bernhard Haeckel, Columbia's director of project development,
said the conclusion was that a proper show of respect for Malcolm
X's legacy ``is one that would be forward-looking rather than
nostalgic.''
   Columbia hopes the $25 million Audubon Research Building will be
a focus for industrial-university cooperation, bringing discoveries
in medical research out of the laboratory and into regular use. The
school also says an expected 300 permanent new jobs and planned
job-training can help the economically distressed neighborhood.
   Those benefits, in addition to a scholarship fund for minority
students in Malcolm X's name at Columbia's nearby medical school,
will do more for the black leader's legacy than pouring precious
funds into restoring the place of his death, Haeckel said.

   A New York hospital agreed to pay $1.15 million
and a medical provider in Texas will pay $2 million to settle
charges they defrauded Medicare of $2.1 million, the Department of
Justice announced Wednesday.
   Prime Medical Services of Dallas, formerly CP Rehab Corp. of
Bedminster, N.J., had been billing Medicare for procedures the
company said were performed by its doctors when they were actually
done by hospital technicians, a statement from the Justice
Department said.
   Victory Memorial Hospital of the New York City borough of
Brooklyn and two Manhattan hospitals also submitted claims for
reimbursement for the procedures, according to the statement.
   The double billing was discovered through an investigation by
the Department of Health and Human Services Inspector General and
the New York Medicaid Fraud Control Unit.
   The investigation also revealed that Victory Hospital received a
50 percent kickback from CP Rehab for every testing receipt the
hospital provided, the Justice Department said.
   The procedures Medicare was billed for, arterial punctures, are
performed to measure arterial blood gases, said Michael Robinson, a
spokesman for the Justice Department.
   Medicare is the federal health care insurance program for people
age 65 or over and for the disabled.
   Robinson would not comment on the status of the investigation
into the two Manhattan hospitals involved in the double billing.

<HEAD>New Oil Find Could Delay Beach Reopening</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Plans to reopen beaches fouled by 400,000
gallons of crude oil were set back Wednesday when cleanup officials
reported that more oil may have seeped into the sand than
previously believed.
   Unusual tides during a Feb. 13 storm may have washed thin layers
of oil above the normal high-tide line along 6 miles of beach,
British Petroleum America announced.
   The storm's winds also shifted sands that may have concealed oil
deposits, British Petroleum spokesman Jim Marino said. The oil
company operates the tanker American Trader and is directing
cleanup efforts.
   Initial findings indicate oil may have seeped between four and
six inches into the sand from Huntington Beach Pier to 18th Street
in Newport Beach.
   British Petroleum officials met with Coast Guard officers to
discuss a survey of the affected coastline and, if more oil is
found, how to recover it, Marino said.
   ``The worst case scenario would be to prematurely open the
beaches and have people go down and get oil on themselves,'' he
said. ``We're using an abundance of caution.''
   ``It will delay it (reopening beaches), definitely,'' said Coast
Guard Petty Officer Tim Rowe.
   However, Newport Beach Fire Capt. Ray Pendleton said surface
cleanup had gone so well on another section, from the Newport Pier
to 18th Street, that the beachn could be opened Thursday.
   No date for reopening other beaches closed by the Feb. 7 tanker
spill had been set Wednesday. A total of 3{ miles of affected beach
were reopened earlier this week after cleanup completion.
   About 350 people remained on cleanup detail Wednesday. At Bolsa
Chica State Beach, crews heated salt water to 140 degrees and
washed oil-coated rocks, followed by a salt water rinse at normal
temperatures.
   Workers employed the same technique at the Newport Beach jetties
but heated water only to 90 degrees because of concern about marine
life. Forty workers scoured sludge from the entrance of the Santa
Ana River.

<TEXT>
   Bonnie Raitt, a whiskey-voiced redhead who
fame eluded in a tough, 20-year career, soared to a stunning
comeback Wednesday night with four top Grammy awards.
   Her ``Nick of Time'' record was named album of the year and won
her top female pop and rock vocalist honors. She also shared the
traditional blues Grammy with John Lee Hooker for the ``I'm in the
Mood'' track on Hooker's ``The Healer'' LP.
   ``This means so much for the kind of music I do, and means those
of us who do rhythm and blues are going to get a chance again,''
Raitt, a four-time nominee during her career, told the 32nd annual
Grammy Awards show audience.
   The 1980s were difficult years for Raitt, 40, who switched
record labels and fought drug and alcohol abuse. ``Nick of Time''
chronicles her doubts about love and growing older.
   Her previous album, ``Nine Lives,'' was ignored by critics and
her record label, which refused to release it on compact disc.
   The daughter of Broadway musical star John Raitt (``Carousel,''
``Oklahoma'') and his wife and piano accompanist, Marjorie Haydock,
Raitt taught herself guitar at the age of 9.
   Her early influences included bluesman Junior Wells, who played
on her first album, ``Bonnie Raitt,'' in 1971. ``Nick of Time'' is
her ninth album.
   One of her best known singles was her 1977 cover of the late Del
Shannon's ``Runaway.'' In the interim, her work has been uneven as
she fought drug and alcohol abuse.
   Three years ago, she began psychotherapy and a year later she
joined Alcoholics Anonymous.
   On her recent concert tour, which played to packed houses across
the nation, she told audiences that vanity led to her rebirth as an
artist.
   ``I was going to make an album with Prince,'' she said in 1988.
   ``It's one thing to go on stage if you're a little chunky, it's
another to make a video with a guy who's known for looking foxy,''
she said. ``I decided to lose weight, which you can't do if you're
drinking all the time.''

   A man was arrested for trying to extort
$2,500 from a federal judge when he picked up a package delivered
to a park by an FBI agent posing as the judge, authorities said
Wednesday.
   Scott Wolf, 20, was accused of trying to extort money from U.S.
District Judge Frank Magill of Fargo, who sits on the 8th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Wolf was arrested Tuesday night after he retrieved a package
delivered to a Fargo baseball field by FBI Special Agent Kenneth
Aldridge, who was posing as the judge. In a court affidavit
released Wednesday, Aldridge said Wolf admitted the extortion
attempt.
   ``Wolf told me that he typed the two Magill extortion letters,
and later called the judge and attempted to gain money from the
judge,'' Aldridge's affidavit said.
   ``He further told me that he acted alone and took actions
against the judge because he needed money,'' Aldridge said.
   Magill declined comment Wednesday, said John Garry, one of the
judge's law clerks. But the FBI said Wolf may have tried to extort
money from the judge because he was acquainted with Magill.
   ``Mr. Wolf resided at one time in the neighborhood with the
Magill family. And there's reason to believe that he has known the
Magill family for a number of years,'' FBI Agent Perry Smith told
reporters.
   Wolf appeared Wednesday before U.S. Magistrate Karen Klein, who
said he was neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community and
released him without bail.
   Aldridge's affidavit said Magill received the first of two
extortion letters on Feb. 4 while attending judicial meetings in
Florida. The letter was postmarked Fargo and was addressed to
Magill and his wife Mary.
   The FBI agent said Magill was told in the letter that ``certain
fatal and painful actions will be taken against the Magill family''
unless he put $2,500 in a business envelope and placed it on home
plate at a baseball diamond.
   FBI agents delivered a package to the baseball diamond on Feb.
7, but no one picked up the package, Aldridge said.
   A second letter, which Magill found Saturday, repeated the
demand.
   ``You had better take us serious about this money, because we
want it and we want it now,'' the letter said, as summarized in
Aldridge's affidavit.
   Aldridge said McGill also received telephone calls Saturday and
Tuesday. The caller hung up when the phone was answered, but the
calls later were traced to Wolf's residence.

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega told a
campaign-closing rally of about 300,000 supporters that a
Sandinista victory in Sunday's elections would win U.S. respect for
Nicaragua after a decade of contempt.
   ``It is a respect that has been won with blood,'' he declared on
Wednesday night.
   ``We expect the United States will have the wisdom to establish
a respectful relationship with Nicaragua.''
   Ortega was elated by the immense throng, jumping and waving to
the crowd as he arrived on a truck.
   By law, all campaigning by the 10 parties competing in the
election had to end by Wednesday midnight.
   The crowd was one of the largest in Nicaraguan history,
comparable in size to the one that greeted Pope John Paul II in
1983.
   Streams of people flowed through town, buying food and drink
from vendors and dancing to rock, tropical music, reggae and
small-town brass bands along the streets.
   Ortega told his supporters the U.S. government should establish
``respectful relations'' with Nicaragua, the same as it does with
the Soviet Union _ ``without conditions of any type.''
   Ortega's main challenger for the presidency is Violeta Barrios
de Chamorro of the United National Opposition, a coalition _ known
as UNO _ of 14 parties and one native Indian organization.
   The election is seen as a referendum on 10 years of Sandinista
rule.
   Voters will choose a president and vice-president, a 90-member
National Assembly, municipal councils for 144 towns and two
regional councils for the Atlantic Coast.
   Ortega referred again and again to the opposition as GN-UNO,
uniting the initials of dictator Anastasio Somoza's national guard
with those of the opposition.
   He equated the opposition with the Somoza dictatorship and the
U.S.-supported Contra rebels, who have waged civil war here since
1981.
   ``We will present them with a complete bill,'' Ortega said of
the opposition, using a line that has become a catch-phrase for
both sides in the campaign.
   But then he struck a conciliatory note by saying that the
opposition's debt would be forgiven.
   ``We do not need to exchange an eye for an eye nor a tooth for a
tooth because they are already knocked out. They are already on the
canvas, the count has reached 20 and they can't get up.''
   The Sandinistas came to power in 1979 by ousting Somoza, who was
later assassinated in exile, and ended 40 years of authoritarian
Somoza family rule.
   Ortega blasted UNO for receiving U.S. aid, saying, ``Millions of
Yankee dollars could not buy the people of Nicaragua.''
   He said Nicaragua would not be affected by perestroika _ the
Soviet restructuring _ and the reforms sweeping Eastern Europe.
   ``Here we don't follow the Communist model or the capitalist
model, we follow the Sandinista model.''
   Many supporters began gathering before dawn.
   The Sandinistas have made a point of appealing to the young, and
the crowd reflected that.
   Nearly everyone under 25 wore a yellow, red, black or white
``Daniel Presidente'' T-shirt. Older folks sported red-and-black
party baseball caps.
   ``We have lots of reasons to be for the revolution. Before we
were on the margin. Today we have a voice and a vote,'' said Ramon
Murillo Lopez, 48, a poor peasant from Boaca, 60 miles east of
Managua.
   Ortega's speech began hours late, after dark, and tens of
thousands were already leaving the plaza before he spoke.
   ``We saw him already. We're satisfied. That's why we came,''
said Eleanor Bonilla, 27. She said her bus from Nandaime, 30 miles
away, was parked far from the plaza and she didn't want to miss her
ride home.
   Ortega claimed a crowd of 500,000, but experienced observers
estimated it at about 300,000 _ still almost five times what Mrs.
Chamorro drew at her closing rally Sunday.
   ``We are here to support the revolution and defeat Violeta and
her Contra friends,'' said Tomas Alvarado, one of about 250
disabled veterans of the war against the Contras.
   Alvarado said bitterly he had been unable to walk since Aug. 1,
1983, when he was blasted by a Contra grenade. He said he and 22
other paraplegic veterans wheeled their way to Managua on a 17-day,
160-mile trek from the Honduran border town of El Espino.
   Despite a huge campaign effort and opinion polls that generally
give Ortega the lead, uncertainty about the outcome lingered.
   Many of Nicaragua's 1.75 million registered voters are reluctant
to speak their minds to strangers and the large Sandinista rallies
appeared padded by public employees and others pressured to attend.
   UNO closed its campaign Sunday with the largest opposition rally
since the Sandinistas took power in July 1979, gathering 60,000
people at the Plaza of the Revolution.
   Wednesday also was the 56th anniversary of the assassination of
Gen. Augusto Cesar Sandino, a nationalist hero for whom the
Sandinistas are named.
   Observers from the Organization of American States, the United
Nations and other groups _ notably former President Jimmy Carter's
Council of Freely Elected Heads of Government _ will field 1,500
observers to watch the process at 4,394 polling places nationwide.
   On Tuesday, Mrs. Chamorro said she would call Ortega to
congratulate him if he won and challenged him to make the same
commitment.
   The Sandinistas have said they would turn over the government to
Mrs. Chamorro in the ``hypothetical event'' of a loss, but not
necessarily the armed forces or the police.
   In Tegucigalpa, Honduras, the Contras pledged to avoid any
military action that would interfere in Sunday's elections.
   Contra spokesman Alejandro Acevedo aid that if the election was
fair and the Sandinistas win, the Contras would have to enter a
``period of re-evaluation.''

   The nearly 1,700 Appalachian miners who
ratified a contract with Pittston Coal Group after a 10{-month
strike prepared to go back to their jobs this week, but not
everyone is happy about it.
   In the eastern Kentucky coal town of McAndrews, any plans to
celebrate were tempered by the uncertain fate of 13 miners facing
suspension during the bitter labor dispute.
   Pittston President Michael Odom, who announced the return to
work, says most of the United Mine Workers in Virginia, West
Virginia and Kentucky will be back on their jobs by Monday. The
first shifts begin Thursday night.
   ``We're going to go about the business now of mining coal,'' UMW
Vice President Cecil Roberts said Tuesday during a news conference

in February 1988, was ratified by 63-37 percent.

   The rights of endangered children sometimes
outweigh an adult's right against self-incrimination, the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled in the case of a mother jailed for refusing to
disclose her son's whereabouts.
   The court ruled 7-2 Tuesday that Jacqueline Bouknight of
Baltimore may continue to be jailed indefinitely for refusing to
tell authorities where her 3-year-old son, Maurice, can be found.
   Social service workers fear the boy is dead.
   ``The bottom line is the court is following an equation that
says if we think it's important enough, individual rights have to
give way. Here we think the rights of children, the concern for
children, is important enough,'' said Mary Cheh, professor of
constitutional law at George Washington University in Washington,

drastically limits the right of authors to quote unpublished

   The justices, without comment, refused Tuesday to hear an appeal
by a company that published a biography attacking the late L. Ron
Hubbard, founder of the Church of Scientology.
   That left intact a ruling last April by the 2nd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals that imposed strict limits on the use of
quotations from unpublished material.
   E. Gabriel Perle, a lawyer who represents the Association of

groups who pushed for the 99 percent ban that takes effect Sunday.
   The American heart and lung associations and the American Cancer
Society said Tuesday they are offering free advice to air travelers

17,000 daily domestic flights.
   Only flights of more than six hours to Alaska or Hawaii will

<HEAD>Hong Kong School Strives to Keep Democracy Spirit Alive</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto Planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Down a narrow street patrolled by scrawny alley
cats, beside a chicken market and up a flight of tenement stairs, a
little school with a big name is striving to keep the spirit of
democracy alive in Hong Kong.
   It's the Overseas Campus of Tiananmen Democracy University and
it looks ahead to 1997, when China takes over Hong Kong from the
British.
   ``It's a struggle to interest people in the future of Hong
Kong,'' says Lau Kin Chi, one of the half-dozen lecturers from Hong
Kong's colleges who banded together to form the school. ``Most have
no hope. They'd rather spend the time applying to emigrate.''
   The plight of the school encapsulates the peculiar situation of
this bustling colony of 5.7 million people. Many realize their fate
is tied to Beijing in seven years, but few believe they can do
anything to change the increasingly hardline regime in China.
   But a month after the school's opening it is falling on hard
times.
   Only 170 people enrolled in January for the first two months of
courses on democracy, Chinese politics and the the historic changes
in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Even fewer are expected for
the next session.
   On a recent night, a dozen students sat in the school's sparse
classroom as the sounds of vegetable hawkers echoed in the alley
below.
   University students, computer programmers, workers and teachers,
all of them praised the little school but bemoaned its shrinking
enrollment.
   ``Most of my friends are too busy making money or trying to
leave Hong Kong to think about China,'' said Andrew Yeung, a
27-year-old computer programmer who comes every Tuesday night to
learn about Chinese political movements. ``But I don't want to
leave Hong Kong. It's my home.''
   ``Call us `economic animals','' said his classmate Cheng Yeung,
a 35-year-old construction foreman. ``But I have no hope of leaving
so I must learn about China. Today's Beijing is tomorrow's Hong
Kong.''
   One high school teacher said she came to class because her
students were asking questions about China and she didn't know the
answers. A church worker said she needed the class because she
wanted to understand why the Communist Chinese arrested Roman
Catholics.
   ``I don't worry about the future,'' she said. ``My fate is in
God's hands.''
   The school takes its name from Tiananmen Democracy University,
founded by Chinese students and intellectuals in Tiananmen Square
just hours before the bloody June 4 crackdown on the movement for
freedom in Beijing.
   Lau and her colleagues decided to borrow the name and rented out
two cramped rooms in a five-story, run-down tenement on bustling
Stone Nullah Lane. Friends renovated and painted the rooms, built
plywood desks and a printing shop donated mimeograph services.
   The school's purpose is to teach about modern China, democracy
and political change, topics that are generally ignored by the
colony's government-run educational system. For 100 Hong Kong
dollars ($12.80) students can enroll in a two-month course.
   ``We want to raise people's consciousness,'' said Ms. Lau, who
teaches and translates modern Chinese literature at a local
college. ``We have been ignorant of China for too long.''
   Indeed, modern Chinese history after the 1949 communist
revolution is not taught in Hong Kong's secondary schools. In
addition, an education ordinance bans discussion of all politics in
high school.
   Political activism in general also has a bad name in the colony
where many are refugees from war and communism.
   ``We have a culture of apathy,'' said Yueng Sum, a Hong Kong
politician and a leader in the small pro-democracy movement.
``Politics has always been a dirty word in Hong Kong. It's meant
chaos, not freedom.''
   Changes in this perspective began last June and Lau and her
colleagues hope this bodes well for the school.
   China's movement for freedom sparked millions to flood Hong
Kong's streets in an unprecedented show of solidarity with the
student democracy movement on the mainland. But Beijing's crackdown
also convinced many that China could not be trusted to maintain
Hong Kong's free-wheeling economic and social system after it
assumes control of the territory. China has promised to allow Hong
Kong to maintain it's current economic and social systems for 50
years beyond 1997.
   Since June 4, the rush to emigrate, which already hovers at
around 1,000 people a week, appears to have accelerated. But the
crackdown in Beijing also sparked increased awareness of Chinese
affairs.
   Several informal surveys of young people in Hong Kong after June
found them increasingly interested in politics and ready to
participate in movements, said Stephen L.W. Tang, a sociologist at
the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
   ``For the first time words like democracy and freedom were more
common than salary and benefits,'' Tang said.
   Back on Stone Nullah Lane, there's little to do but wait and see.
   ``It's frustrating,'' said Cheng Yuk-shing, another lecturer at
the school. ``But our neighbors only talk to us when we don't shut
the gate.''

<HEAD>`Jewish Riviera' Fades Into Past</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's lunchtime at King David's
Delicatessen, and the customers, some wearing yarmulkes, are
ordering tongue sandwiches, briskets or pastrami.
   A few doors down, young people in jeans and T-shirts get the
spinach salad special at ``Don't Say Sandwich To Me,'' and nearby,
Spanish-speaking youths are buying ``pan con bistec'' and ``cerveza
fria,'' meat sandwiches and cold beer.
   For every kosher restaurant on today's South Miami Beach, the
so-called Jewish Riviera, there's a fern bar or a counter
restaurant featuring Cuban or Nicaraguan standards.
   The Jewish population is sharply declining on the famed
41-block-long stretch, spurred by an increase in Latin exiles,
modern phenomena such as condominiums, Marielitos and yuppies, and
that most ancient earthly problem: mortality.
   ``When I first came here, this building was 99 percent Jewish,''
said Rita Sors, 65, a Polish-born Holocaust survivor. ``Many left
or, of course, people die. They were replaced by Latin-American
people.''
   Mrs. Sors, who bought her beachfront condominium in 1980 after
living in Venezuela for more than two decades, speaks Spanish and
adjusted more easily to the change from Liebman to Lopez than many
other Jewish retirees.
   ``If your neighbors' names all used to be Rachel and Isidore and
now they're Jose, Pedro and Maria and they don't speak your
language, people get nervous,'' said Ira Sheskin, a University of
Miami geography professor who chronicles the movements of the
Jewish population in South Florida for various Jewish groups and
his Florida Jewish Demography newsletter.
   From a peak of an estimated 290,000 Jews in 1975, Dade County
now is down to 225,000. Miami Beach is down to 58,000 _ of an
overall city population of about 100,000 _ from 82,000 in 1982,
said Sheskin, who conducts random telephone surveys and counts
traditional Jewish names in city directories to track the
population.
   While there are varied reasons for the change, a catalyst came
in 1980, when Cuban President Fidel Castro opened the port of
Mariel to people who wanted to leave.
   Among the 125,000 Cubans who came to this country were thousands
of vagrants, criminals and other misfits unwanted by Castro's
revolution. Most of the Marielitos headed to the Miami area,
joining a half-million earlier Cuban refugees. Some without
relatives to join moved into South Beach, crowding into low-rent,
rundown apartments.
   Muggings, purse snatchings and smash-and-grab burglaries shot up
on the beach, with elderly retirees vulnerable victims.
   ``They pushed out a lot of the old people,'' said Abe Resnick, a
city commissioner and Russian immigrant. ``They really scared them
away.''
   Police responded by increasing street units, and city officials
beefed up enforcement of housing codes to reduce the number of
people sharing low-rent apartments.
   Ambitious redevelopment of the beach followed and the beach
population has become younger, and less Jewish. In the last decade,
up to 40 percent of the new residents have been Hispanic and the
median age has dropped from 67 in 1982 to the low 50s.
   Resnick, now 65, has lived in Miami Beach since 1960.
   ``It was a very interesting life for Jewish people,'' he said.
``There was everything catering to this type of life _ cultural
events, theaters, people gathering to speak Yiddish together. The
synagogues used to be so crowded they had to bring in chairs.''
   Sheskin, who's working on a history of Jews in South Florida,
noted the irony of the Latin influx causing Jews to leave an area
that in the 1930s and '40s had anti-Semitic traditions. Hotels had
``restricted'' clientele and some restaurants posted cruel signs:
``No Jews or Dogs.''
   New York-raised soldiers stationed in the area during World War
II fell in love with the beach and began the huge migration here
from the Northeast, along with European Jews drawn to a land of
sun, sand and fun.
   In 1940, there were 8,000 Jews in Dade County, Sheskin said. By
1950, there were 55,000. And in 1955, the number reached 100,000.
   But the jet age, opening up destinations in the Caribbean and
south, dulled some of the Beach's glamour, and the advent of
planned condominium retirement communities began siphoning away its
population.
   Many retirees simply died off or were priced out by the
redevelopment that lured the Young Urban Professionals discovering
trendiness in the funky Art Deco buildings and a chance to live
near the water.
   The beach that once featured Manhattan or Las Vegas-style
nightclub acts now is dotted with youth spots such as Club Nu or
Penrod's On The Beach offering Lambada nights or rock bands.
   Three of 10 synagogues on South Beach have closed in recent
years, and kosher butchers and Jewish bookstores have moved north.
   ``Little by little, it's disappearing,'' Resnick said.
   At Torah Treasures, there still is good business for editions of
the Talmud, Israeli newspapers, menorahs, cassettes such as
Mordechai Ben David singing ``Moshiach Is Coming Soon'' and treats
for children such as rabbi trading cards, Mitsvah gum and the board
game Kosherland, modeled after Candyland.
   But co-owner Aryeh Zak, here for 15 years, said the changes on
the street are many. People use his backdoor as a toilet, criminals
plague him and, in general, people are not as friendly or polite,
Zak said. ``But I think that's a change all over,'' he said.
   Many of his customers no longer live within walking distance,
but come from the Broward and Palm Beach county suburbs now home to
most of South Florida's Jews.
   While the shift from South Beach has been dramatic, the overall
Jewish population in South Florida has been increasing, Sheskin
said. Some 650,000 Jews live in the three-county Palm
Beach-Broward-Dade area today, he said, compared to 550,000 in 1980.
   They represent 17 percent of the three-county population _ more
than the New York area with 12 percent, or 2.2 million Jews _
making up the nation's most-concentrated Jewish population. Some of
the Latins are Jewish, too, and Sheskin estimates about 10,000
Cuban Jews, or ``Jewbans,'' as they're called, live in South
Florida.
   And Miami Beach still attracts new Jewish migrants, although
many familes settle in what's known as ``Middle Beach,'' north of
41st Street.
   ``I see a rebirth of Miami Beach in the sense that so many young
people and families are moving in,'' said Rabbi Irving Lehrman of
Temple Emanu-El. ``We've lost a lot of people who passed away, but
we've gained a lot of young people.''
   If the beach loses its Jewish identity, it's not a tragedy, some
say.
   ``There's nothing sacred about South Beach,'' said Rabbi Tibor
Stern, preparing to move his synagogue after 25 years to a
community to the north. ``It's not Jerusalem.''

   Jesse Jackson's new hometown may have a job
opening made to order for a once and future Democratic presidential
candidate _ but the fine print says he can't run for it. Another
slot almost as inviting is tied up in the city council.
   Neither job is mayor, the office Jackson could seek in November,
an option on which he so far won't say yes or no.
   The other posts involve Congress, one officially as a non-voting
delegate, one unofficially, as an city-elected lobbyist for
District of Columbia statehood. Either would carry some of the
advantages of office without the confining duties an elected post,
like mayor, usually entails.
   There has been speculation about Jackson for mayor ever since he
moved to Washington last summer, and he has done nothing to dampen
it. That's true to the form he has shown in national Democratic
politics. Jackson strengthened his influence by stirring political
guesswork about his post-convention roles in the 1984 and 1988
Democratic presidential campaigns.
   Transplanted from Chicago to the District of Columbia, he's got
them guessing again, this time in local politics. There are other
players, among them Walter E. Fauntroy, the district non-voting
delegate to Congress since 1971.
   With Mayor Marion Barry in a rehabilitation center and facing
drug possession and perjury charges, some of his leading supporters
have formed a committee to draft Fauntroy for mayor. Four Democrats
already are running to oust Barry, but none has the name
recognition that either Fauntroy or Jackson would command.
   Fauntroy says he is agonizing about the decision and will
announce by March 3 whether he'll run for mayor or stay in
Congress, where he can't vote but has the other rights of a member.
   Should he run for mayor, it would create what seems the perfect
vacancy for Jackson: a seat in Congress with a staff, committee
assignments and the right to speak and debate on the floor like any
other member. Even the lack of a vote would be an asset _ missing
House action while campaigning nationally or tending to other
interests wouldn't be the recorded disadvantage it sometimes has
been for members of Congress seeking presidential nomination.
   And Jackson has said that if he did become mayor, it would limit
his activities in national and international affairs.
   The hitch is in the law that grants the District a delegate, and
requires that on the date of his election ``he has resided in the
District of Columbia continuously since the beginning of the
three-year period ending on such date.''
   Jackson moved to Washington in summer 1989, in time to meet the
one-year residency requirement to run for mayor, but far short of
the three-year rule for delegate. That law could be changed by the
city and Congress. That means some potential Jackson rivals, local
in 1990, national in 1992, would have to go along. The law also
could be challenged as invalid, since it doesn't apply to
congressmen elsewhere and the House itself has the last word on its
members.
   There seemed to be another option in the planned election of a
shadow congressional delegation by district voters, but that has
been shelved indefinitely by a city council committee. The plan was
to have the voters elect two shadow senators and a representative
this year as part of the effort to make the District of Columbia
the 51st state. They wouldn't be seated in Congress, of course.
They would be cast as leading lobbyists for statehood, a cause for
which Jackson has been campaigning.
   Creation of those positions, which would cost an estimated $1.35
million a year, was approved in a city referendum on statehood a
decade ago. The elections already have been postponed three times.
   Statehood always has been a long shot, and the Barry-induced
political turmoil makes it even more so. Congress approved a
constitutional amendment to give the district voting representation
in 1978, but it died for lack of state ratification.
   Seventy-nine percent of district voters are registered
Democrats. Only 9 percent are registered as Republicans. So
statehood, if it came, would give the Democrats a lock on two new
seats in the Senate and one in the House, a prospect Republicans
are not about to accept.
   And that's not the only problem that goes with Jackson's new
voting address. Fauntroy has announced a campaign of
tax-withholding civil disobedience, saying district residents
should refuse to pay their federal income taxes until they get
statehood.
   That would risk penalties including imprisonment. ``Those of us
who have decided to take this action are prepared to accept those
consequences,'' Fauntroy said last week.
   Perhaps. But if there really is such a statehood campaign, it
would create a special dilemma for Jackson, who would have to
choose between local and national objectives. Tax disobedience
might play well in the District of Columbia, but it could be
disastrous in any future presidential campaign.

<DATELINE>TARRAFAL, Cape Verde (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Outside this drowsy town, a
hodgepodge of huts, overgrown with rambling purple creepers, is all
that's left of ``the camp of slow death'' _ once the most feared
prison of Portugal's African empire.
   In those days, it housed hundreds of Portuguese and African
dissidents in a myriad of cramped cells.
   But today's independent government would like to turn it into a
museum with beachside bungalows nearby to attract tourists and
their money to this barren, 10-island archipelago in the Atlantic
off northwest Africa.
   It is part of Cape Verde's turn off the Marxist-socialist road
taken after independence in 1975 into free-market square.
   Cape Verde's leaders have introduced sweeping economic reforms
and are even debating scrapping their guaranteed monopoly on power.
   ``We have no abstract model, no preconceived ideas,'' Prime
Minister Pedro Pires said, sitting in his modest office in Cidade
da Praia, the capital. ``We're trying a pragmatic and gradual
search for a better life.''
   The search includes tourism, fishing and light manufacturing _
and perhaps investment from Cape Verdeans who emigrated over the
years and now live in affluence in such places as the U.S. East
Coast.
   The governing African Party for Cape Verdian Independence
decided just over a year ago to remove state controls from all
sectors save the central bank and offer tax breaks to attract
foreign capital.
   ``The economy has been prudently managed, but the only avenue
out of chronic dependency is to become a sort of Singapore or
Mauritius,'' said Tom Luche, director of U.S. Agency for
International Development in Cidade da Praia. (Singapore and
Mauritius are duty-free zones.)
   ``This place is small and there's a considerable amount of
private cash here. ... It only needs a couple of sectors to work
well.''
   Luche estimates Cape Verde's fishermen could triple their
current 10,000-ton annual catch and improve canning and freezing
installations for tuna and other fish, which already account for
about 70 percent of exports.
   In addition to Tarrafal, another tourist prospect is Sal Island,
120 miles to the north, where stready winds, potent rum and cheap
lobster already attract the ritzy European windsurfing set.
   The government plans 10 new luxury hotels in the islands over
the next 10 years, boosting capacity by 2,500 rooms.
   But island life remains tough for most of the 360,000 Cape
Verdians who still live here, 385 miles off Senegal in Africa's
Sahel region.
   With few natural resources other than rich fishing waters, the
archipelago relies on foreign aid for 90 percent of its food
requirements.
   Famine killed an estimated 250,000 islanders from 1747 to 1960,
and violent storms that ended a 16-year dry period in 1984 washed
out corn and wheat crops.
   Last year, when rain fell for only minutes, vegetables were so
scarce that onions were sold by the slice and fetched twice the
price of lobster.
   Most rural housewives have miles to walk for water. Their neat,
pastel-painted houses have no electricity.
   Still, Cape Verde's per capita gross national product of $530
lands it in the World Bank's middle-income class, comparable to
Senegal, and one rung up the development ladder from countries like
Kenya and Indonesia.
   But GNP is propped some 30 percent by foreign aid and
remittances from an estimated 700,000 Cape Verdians living and
working abroad, mainly on the U.S. East Coast, Portugal, France,
the Netherlands and several African countries.
   In the 1800s, many Cape Verde whalers settled in Massachusetts
and Rhode Island, where today they number more than 350,000.
   They read their own newspaper _ The Cape Verdian _ and send
money and goods regularly to families and friends back home.
   ``We're still not in condition to stop emigration, but more and
more emigrants are investing here following the new regulations,''
said President Aristides Pereira.
   Besides financial incentives designed to tap exiles' cash
resources, the government is also wooing them with talk of
political pluralism.
   Next year, independent candidates will be allowed to run in the
first-ever nationwide municipal vote.
   ``We don't exclude the possibility of various parties, but it
really wasn't necessary until now; a genuine pluralism of ideas
exists within the party already,'' said Pereira, who enjoys
widespread popular support.

<HEAD>A New Twist on the ``Kiddie Tax''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many parents who must reckon with the so-called
``kiddie tax'' have a new choice in how they handle it when they
file their returns for 1989.
   They can, as before, complete separate federal income tax
returns for each of their offspring who must file. Or in some
cases, they may be allowed for the first time to incorporate the
childrens' income on their own tax returns.
   The difference may sound like no big deal. The main intent of
the change was to make filing a little easier by eliminating the
need for separate returns from children in relatively simple
circumstances.
   But experts on the subject say a decision for either option
should be made with care, since it could affect a family's overall
tax bill.
   The ``kiddie tax'' was born with the 1986 tax reform law, which
sought to curtail the popular practice of reducing taxes by
shifting income to children and other dependents.
   Henceforth, the law decreed, investment income received by
youngsters under age 14 would be taxed at their parents' tax rate
once it exceeded specified limits.
   This immediately transformed a good many small children into
full-blown Social-Security-card-carrying taxpayers. It turned out,
however, that hardly anybody _ not even the Internal Revenue
Service _ was entirely happy about all the extra paperwork
engendered by the change.
   So was born the new option for parents of a child under 14 who
has income of between $500 and $5,000 derived entirely from
interest and dividends, on which no estimated tax or withholding
has been paid.
   Whichever filing method you choose, a child in this situation
owes no tax on the first $500 of earnings. The next $500 is taxed
at a 15 percent rate.
   Past $1,000, the money is taxed at the parent's top rate, which
in many cases is 28 percent.
   If sheer convenience were the only influencing factor, a parent
might logically prefer the election not to file a separate return
for the child.
   But as specialists on tax matters point out, there may be other
considerations that tip the scales either way.
   For one thing, including the income on your own return prevents
you from deducting any expenses that children could claim if they
filed separately.
   Conversely, says the accounting firm of KMPG Peat Marwick, ``by
including your child's investment income on your return, you may be
able to deduct more investment interest expense because of your
child's investment income. This could effectively shelter a portion
of your child's income from tax.''
   In addition, lumping childrens' income with parents' can create
complications for high-income taxpayers who may be subject to the
alternative minimum tax.
   Still another possible side effect: ``Including your child's
income on your return may also increase your adjusted gross income
for purposes of the medical and miscellaneous itemized
deductions,'' cautions Price Waterhouse in the current edition of
its book Personal Tax Advisor.
   Medical costs and miscellaneous expenses, for such things as
professional dues and uniforms you buy, can be deducted only when
they exceed specified percentages of your gross income.
   So if you increase your gross income by including what the child
earned, you may reduce the medical or miscellaneous deductions you
can take.

<HEAD>CPI: Bad News, And Some Not So Bad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strip away weather factors in the Consumer Price
Index and you still have a serious problem, an inflation rate of
more than 7 percent a year. That is core inflation.
   If maintained, it would halve the purchasing power of a dollar
within 10 years. It is a rate high enough to feed itself _ to
trigger cost-of-living pay increases, higher interest rates and
anticipatory buying.
   But significant elements in the latest CPI reading make it
difficult to compare with readings in other decades. Some of these
differences might darken the picture, but others conceivably have a
brighter hue.
   The dark side:
   _The increase in energy prices is believed by many analysts to
be a short-lived phenomenon, caused largely by unusually cold
temperatures in December. Since then, most northern states have
been warmer than normal.
   Nonetheless, some economists fear higher energy costs will be
with us for a long time, good weather or bad. The country has
abandoned many fuel-saving efforts. Domestic production is
declining.
   In addition, nobody controls weather. Who can prove that the
rest of the winter and on into spring will not be colder and
snowier than normal, raising energy demands, forcing up food prices
and snarling transportation?
   _Much of the inflation is in services, where cost-savings are
often difficult to find. Some services, such as hotels, restaurants
and hospitals, are labor-intensive, and will be hurt further by
higher minimum wage rates.
   The service sector is growing. In fact, the economy these days
is often referred to as a service economy. Most older industries
are primarily goods producers.
   _There is a suspicion that price competition in transportation
isn't what it used to be. When airlines were deregulated, for
example, it was expected that competition would drive down fares.
   To some extent, that happened. More recently, some airlines have
been operating on the fringe of profitability and others on the
fringe of failure. It leads some analysts to believe an upward
price trend is inevitable.
   The brighter side:
   _Chonologically, most of winter is over. Temperatures should
rise from now until summer, helping to slow food and energy price
increases. But don't forget, averages include extremes. Weather is
often extreme.
   _Construction price increases contributed to the big jump in
January consumer prices. That too might be temporary; it occurs
almost every January, when contractors bid on jobs to be undertaken
during the busy summer.
   _Price increases in services are not always what they seem. They
cannot always be measured accurately. In fact, some increases are
unreal, reported mainly because methodology has failed to keep
abreast of change.
   Increases in productivity, for example, are seldom fully
measured. It is much more difficult to measure service output than
it is in the production of goods, especially manufactured items.
   How do you measure the quality, the productivity of health care?
How do you work that into inflation equations? Can you compare a
modern fast-food outlet with an old diner?
   Economist William Dunkelberg, dean of Temple University school
of business and management, puts it colorfully although rather
theoretically:
   ``Your doctor's fee might have doubled, but most likely you are
getting better health care, too. You're probably getting more
pounds of health care for the dollar. That is, the cost of a pound
of health care might have dropped.''
   Then we might assume that some of service inflation isn't real?
   ``It isn't an assumption,'' said Dunkelberg. ``It is a fact.''

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a bare, concrete back room at the Lowell Thomas
Law Building, there's a picture of Thomas, labeled simply, ``Thomas
with a man.''
   The man, consigned to oblivion, is TV personality Arthur Godfrey.
   Now Thomas himself is facing that same forgotten fate.
   ``We have students here at Denver University who don't know who
Lowell Thomas was,'' said Phil Gauthier, 63, head of the alumni
association and unofficial curator of the Lowell Thomas memorabilia.
   The school, which has 975 students, has no money and no room for
the museum Gauthier would like to build in memory of the man who
chronicled history for four generations, toured the world and
crossed both poles, befriended presidents, wrote more than 50 books
and was a pioneer in broadcast journalism.
   Gauthier says Thomas also was a frustrated lawyer, who left his
$3.5 million estate in Pawling, N.Y., to the school to build a
library in his memory. Gauthier would like to put up a museum,
featuring video presentations of Thomas' career and displaying some
of the 2,600 books and 700 photos left to the university.
   The mementos are now kept in a locked, bare-wall, concrete room
in the building he sponsored on the University of Denver law
campus, formerly Colorado Women's College. There are no displays
open to the public.
   Thomas grew up in Colorado, and fondly remembered the state. His
father became the doctor in Victor, Colo., and Thomas went to work
in the gold mines at the age of 11. He often bragged he was raised
in an ``ore house.''
   At 19, he became editor of the local paper, the Victor Daily
News. His memories of one day at the paper were vivid, as recalled
in a May 14, 1951, interview with the Denver Post:
   ``On Saturday, there was no pretty girl picture available so I
ran a story about a brawl in Denver in which the nephew of our
mayor was involved. To supply the needed art, I used the mayor's
picture. He came looking for me with a gun, and I apologized _
sincerely and quickly.''
   After a newspaper war with his rival, the late Gov. Ralph Carr,
Thomas left Victor and went on to international fame.
   ``I don't know who won, but I left,'' he said.
   In Denver, he attended the University of Denver and got his
bachelor's degree in 1913.
   He then left Colorado for a Chicago newspaper job, and went
overseas to cover World War I. There he sealed his fame and fortune
when he discovered Lawrence of Arabia (Thomas Edward Shaw
Lawrence), who was at the time taking up his cudgel against the
Turks on the Arabian peninsula.
   In 1930, he went into broadcasting, finding a career that last
nearly half a century. He began the first regularly scheduled radio
newscast on CBS radio and made the first television newscast in
1939. He also was host of a public television series called
``Lowell Thomas Remembers.''
   When he started his career, Eric Sevareid was 13, Walter
Cronkite 9, Harry Reasoner 2.
   He always began his broadcast saying, ``Good evening,
everybody,'' and ended his show with his trademark, ``So long,
until tomorrow,'' except when he retired May 14, 1976, and he said
simply, ``So long.''
   He died at his home in Pawling in 1981 at the age of 89.
   Among the items at the University of Denver are the entire
collection of radio scripts, from his first broadcast in October
1930 to his last in May 1976.
   Gauthier said very few people visit the faculty lounge where the
volumes are kept, and those who do want to find out what happened
the day they were born.
   Not everything Thomas touched turned to gold, Gauthier said.
Thomas was particularly disappointed with the lack of success of
Cinerama, a movie technique he helped perfect.
   ``Cinerama never did take off to the extent he thought it would,
but it was a forerunner of big-screen movies,'' Gauthier said.
   Among the collection stored in the back room are pictures of
Thomas with Franklin Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower, Jawaharal Nehru
in New Delhi, Chiang Kai-shek, Gen. Douglas MacArthur in Tokyo,
Herbert Hoover, cannibals in the New Guinea jungle, Jack Dempsey,
Lawrence of Arabia, Gen. George Patton and the Shah of Iran.
   There are also letters informing him he had an island off
Greenland and a mountain in Antarctica named for him, and a letter
from Secretary of State John Foster Dulles designating him the
official U.S. representative to the coronation of the king of Nepal.
   Gauthier said he is often asked why the university even keeps
the memorabilia Thomas left behind.
   ``People ask me, `Who cares?' and I say a lot of people care.
The older you get, the more you reminisce,'' Gauthier said.
   ``He chronicled history for several generations. He was our tour
guide.''

   IN-DIATAFANE, Mali (AP) _ Noumou Diakite put a finger to his
lips and pointed to a stand of acacias near the water where a tree
trunk seemed to step forward. There, at the edge of the pool, were
the Gourmas _ the last remaining wild elephant herd in sub-Saharan
Africa.
   A 6-ton bull raised his trunk in a graceful backward arc and
sprayed a cooling stream of water. About 50 other elephants bathed
languidly near some cattle drinking from the murky pool.
   Suddenly, for Diakite and a reporter, it was worth all the days
of dust and relentless heat of a bronze-and-cancer sun of northern
Mali.
   The U.S. ambassador to Mali, Robert Pringle, had a similar
experience with Diakite, leader of the regional livestock authority.
   ``It was marvelous, although a bit scary. You're on foot, not in
a vehicle, and really in the middle of nowhere near animals which
have never been tamed by anyone,'' he said.
   ``It is miraculous that they have survived here where wildlife
has generally been run ragged.''
   Hidden in the remote reaches of northeastern Mali the Gourmas
are the last remaining herd on the southern fringe of the Sahara
Desert, according to a report commissioned by the U.S. Agency for
International Development. They are the most northern herd on the
continent, one of the last to roam free.
   The Gourmas are fast in their pursuit of food, water and shade
across an arid 4,800-square-mile migratory zone, an area slightly
smaller than Connecticut.
   No accurate count has been made of how many elephants are out
there. But several international agencies and governments,
including the United States, hope to conduct a census soon.
   For the moment, the best estimate comes from Diakite, whose
World Bank-financed program has hundreds of agents in the brush
speaking with nomadic herders. The best they can estimate is 500 to
1,500 elephants share the vast expanse of golden savannah,
rose-colored dunes, oases and hard-pan flats.
   There are a lot of calves, they say, and the number of elephants
seems to have been on the rise since the devastating drought of the
mid-1980s that decimated the herd.
   Whatever their number, the Gourma elephants are a tiny remnant
of the enormous herds that less than century ago roamed this area
from Senegal to Chad. Drought killed some. Ivory poachers
slaughtered more.
   But the Gourmas were blessed with small tusks and good
neighbors. Unlike people living near elephant populations in other
parts of Africa, the Tuareg, Fulani and Songhai of Mali consider
the elephants good luck.
   ``When an elephant passes between two hills near my village, the
people say it will be a good growing season. This doesn't always
pan out, but we're fond of the elephants anyway,'' said Jean-Geny
Dao, a guide.
   Stephen Cobb, an elephant expert and director of the Environment
and Development Group at Oxford University, said that the Gourma
elephant's estimated foot-long tusks have protected them somewhat
from ivory-seeking poachers ``but the cultural tradition is far and
away the most important factor.''
   ``In Mali we find an ideal to which we should aspire in getting
people to live amicably with the elephants,'' Cobb said.
   The number of elephants throughout Africa has plummeted over the
last eight years from 1.2 million to about 600,000. In October, at
a meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, the signatories to the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species approved a
formal ban on ivory trade.
   Despite the ban, China has said it will continue to import ivory
for jewelry and other objects. Experts predict that at the current
rate of slaughter, Africa's elephants could be extinct before the
end of the century.
   Even in Mali, conflict has developed as the spreading desert
forces nomads to give up their animal herds and settle down near
water holes to plant crops.
   More and more, people are grumbling about elephants tromping on
turnips or munching on millet supplies and it may not be long
before they start looking upon them as pests rather than symbols of
luck.
   ``Elephants and gardens don't mix,'' said Pringle. ``There are
new and increasing conflicts with the local people. It seems a safe
bet that they will not survive another 10 years without a
management regime of some sort.''
   Cobb agreed: ``There is an urgent need for sensitive and firm
planning, limits on places that can be developed for agriculture
instead of a haphazard free-for-all.''
   Fences built around gardens might be one solution.
   ``A 10-foot-wide jumble of sharp stones will keep elephants
away,'' Cobb said. ``They have sensitive feet. ...''
   But he added that much can be learned from the little Gourmas.
   ``There must be a better solution to saving the elephant than
shutting them up in national parks and turning them into tamed
tourist attractions,'' he said. ``The Gourma elephants can teach us
ways of making elephant conservation work, hand-in-hand with the
economic development of people who share the land.''

   After Vic Monia headed a campaign that helped
persuade local voters to limit developments on surrounding
hillsides, he immediately had to fend off a $40 million defamation
suit filed by a developer.
   Citizens who crusade against local polluters or new developments
are increasingly likely to be hit with such suits, called
``SLAPPs,'' or Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation, two
University of Denver professors say. They say the suits are
unconstitutional and discourage citizen participation. Some SLAPP
targets, however, are SLAPPing back, with notable success.
   The suit against Monia, a computer engineer in Saratoga, Calif.,
never made it to court. Last year, nine years after it was filed,
he won $200,000 in a countersuit when a jury ruled he was the
victim of malicious prosecution.
   But the developer's SLAPP against Monia and his environmental
and homeowners group had an effect. Intimidated city council
members exempted the developer from some new restrictions and many
local homeowners' groups disbanded, Monia said.
   ``I saw the impact of the lawsuit in the community: a lot less
participation,'' he said. ``People were talking about: `You've got
to be careful. You speak out, someone's gonna sue you.'
   ``I got so preoccupied,'' he said. ``I ended up leaving my job.
I thought about moving out of the state. My daughters at the time
were quite young, we'd just moved into a new home, the payments
were pretty good-sized. And my wife said, `Are you sure you haven't
risked everything we've worked for?' It really began to weigh very
heavily on me.''
   Now, he said, he'd think twice before participating in local
politics.
   Monia's is one of hundreds of cases tracked by law professor
George Pring and sociology professor Penelope Canan as part of a
2{-year study financed by the National Science Foundation.
   Pring and Canan say there are thousands more and the numbers
have been growing since the 1970s, with the greatest concentration
in areas with a high quality of life and a large number of educated
newcomers, particularly California, New York and Colorado.
   Among the SLAPPs they studied:
   _A Louisville, Colo., woman circulated petitions opposing plans
for a housing development on nearby farmland and was sued by the
developer.
   _A Sutton, W.Va., blueberry farmer told federal authorities that
operators of a nearby coal mine had polluted a river and killed
fish in it. He was hit with a $200,000 libel lawsuit.
   _A group of citizens in Washington and Warren counties in New
York went to court to block a planned trash incinerator and were
countersued by the counties for $1.5 million.
   _The League of Women Voters in Beverly Hills, Calif., supported
a ballot initiative to stop a condominium project and wrote two
letters to a local newspaper criticizing it. The developer sued the
league for $63 million.
   SLAPPs aren't meant to be won _ they're meant to intimidate, the
professors concluded.
   They usually don't even get to court, and once there, more than
90 percent of the plaintiffs lose, Pring said. By that time,
though, the citizen opposition often is scared off or into
compromise, the professors said.
   The average SLAPP seeks $9 million in damages and takes 36
months to resolve.
   ``Hundreds of people we've talked to are literally terrified at
the thought of losing their homes under multimillion-dollar
lawsuits,'' Pring said.
   The suits also dissuade people who merely hear about them from
participating in politics, he said.
   State authorities are starting to act. A legislative proposal in
New York, for example, would require developers to prove actual
malice on the part of citizen opponents before they could file
SLAPPs, said Nancy Stearns of th New York Attorney General's
Environmental Protection Bureau.
   ``It's troublesome,'' Stearns said. ``Particularly in the
environmental arena, citizen participation is really key. The law
relies on the involvement of citizens in the environmental process.
It's not just exercising rights, but being a responsible citizen.''
   She said the increase in SLAPPs in the last 10 to 15 years could
be due to rising citizen concern about the environment.
   Pring and Canan said it also could be the result of a generally
more litigious society, noting that many SLAPPs are unrelated to
the environment but instead are filed by local or school officials
against citizens or parents.
   In a recent case in suburban Denver, for example, a teacher
accused by fundamentalist Christian parents of teaching witchcraft
sued the parents for slander. Police officers have sued citizens
who complained about their behavior, and elected officials have
claimed defamation when citizens called for their jobs, the
professors say.
   ``The right to tell our elected government representatives what
we think and what we want them to do for us is the most basic right
we have,'' said Pring. ``What is more basic than parents going to
school with complaints about their children's education?''
   Monia said he stewed about the ``injustice'' of the suit filed
against him for almost a year after it was dismissed before
deciding to sue the developer and the developer's attorney. In
addition to the $200,000 jury award from the developer last year,
Monia won an out-of-court settlement with the attorney.
   In a more prominent California case last year, a group of Kern
County farmers who successfully fought off a SLAPP by agribusiness
giant J.G. Boswell Co. in a water dispute countersued and won a
$13.5 million judgment against Boswell for infringing on their
constitutional rights.
   The court ruled Boswell filed the libel suit in 1982 to
intimidate the farmers so they would not support a state
proposition.
   ``Unlike SLAPPs, many SLAPP-backs are succeeding,'' said Pring,
who testified on the farmers' behalf. ``It used to be filers could
file these cases with impunity. ... Now I have to counsel would-be
filers and their attorneys they may be walking themselves into a
multimillion-dollar action.''
   Still, he said, the farmers told him they would never again
participate in politics.
   Monia, who said he was lucky enough to be able to weather nine
years of legal bills, hopes his victory encourages others.
   ``And I hope that they can feel that if they go after
individuals or companies who misuse the judicial system for
political purposes, that they can win,'' he said.

<HEAD>Jesuit Volunteers: Dying and Rising in El Salvador</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. J. Dean Brackley was surprised at how
deeply the murders of six Jesuit priests in El Salvador shook him
up.
   ``For a couple of days, I was disoriented,'' said the theology
professor at Fordham University. ``Then, somebody snapped me out of
it. You know, some good is going to come out of this.''
   Brackley's response was to become one of more than 20 Jesuits
from throughout the world to volunteer to replace their slain
colleagues at the Jose Simeon Canas Central American University. He
and five other priests from Ireland, Canada, Mexico and Spain have
been assigned to the Salvadoran university, and more may be sent
over.
   ``We feel the support of the whole society,'' said the Rev.
Carlos Cabarrus of the Loyola Novitiate in Panama City.
   Six priests, their housekeeper and her teen-age daughter were
dragged out of their beds on the night of Nov. 16 and fatally shot
by uniformed men. The director of El Salvador's Military College
and eight other soldiers were charged with the murders.
   In the aftermath of the killings, ``A lot of Jesuits volunteered
from all over the world to go to Salvador to keep the university
going,'' said the Rev. Richard Buhler, executive secretary of the
U.S. Jesuit Conference in Washington.
   ``The blood of martyrs becomes the seed of Christians,'' he said.
   Cabarrus said Jesuit officials in Central America are evaluating
the applications of at least 20 Jesuit volunteers from other parts
of the world. He said not all the applicants would be selected
because of problems with obtaining visas and matching skills with
needs.
   The Rev. Joseph O'Hare, president of Fordham University and
chairman of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities,
said following a recent three-day visit that the volunteers were
appreciated by their Salvadoran brethren.
   ``One of the things they told us was that the murders had really
been a devastating blow to them,'' O'Hare said. ``They really felt
terribly isolated and alone.''
   If past experience is a guide, the violence will serve only to
strengthen the religious order, Cabarrus said.
   He said the school for religious novices was started in 1975
with 10 students, and began to experience a substantial increase in
membership after the murder of El Salvador Archbishop Oscar Romero
in 1980. The two-year program now has 34 novices, the largest in
the Central American Province's history.
   Cabarrus said it is too early to tell how Central American youth
will react to the recent murders, ``but I hope it will be great for
us in vocations.''
   He said none of the current novices have dropped out. ``Just the
opposite. They are very encouraged by seeing the witnesses of those
Jesuits who were assassinated.''
   At the university, Cabarrus said, there is fear of further
violence among some of the lay faculty members, ``but not at the
level of students, and not for the Jesuits, of course.''
   Brackley, who did pastoral work in El Salvador in 1984 and 1988,
said he does not deny there is danger, but having worked most of
the last 10 years in the South Bronx in New York has helped him
live with insecurity.
   ``I don't want to be a martyr, and I don't think I will be,'' he
said.
   Without sounding ``too Irish'' about the whole thing, Brackley
said, he preferred a life of adventure to bordeom.
   There are few higher dramas in the world of religion than in El
Salvador, Brackley said.
   ``It's a drama of dying and rising,'' he said. ``On the one
hand, dying and suffering. On the other hand, great hope.''

   President Bush says that ``ugly forms of
discrimination and prejudice continue to mar the shining promise of
America'' and that the country must overcome those ills.
   ``Our nation's future depends on it,'' he said in a message to
the National Conference of Christians and Jews in connection with
the observance of Brotherhood-Sisterhood Week.
   He said its theme, ``America's Future Comes in All Colors,'' was
a ``wonderful reminder of the fact that every American _ of every
race, creed and walk of life _ has unique talents and abilities to
share with others.''
   The non-sectarian oranization, founded in 1927 to promote
religious, racial and ethnic inclusiveness in American society, has
distributed 150,000 color posters to schools, along with discussion
guides on the value of diversity.
   In an accompanying statement, the conference warned that
``violent incidents stemming from racial hatred have reached
alarming proportions'' and urged resistance to such bigotry to
``proclaim our shared common humanity.''
   Bush said, ``At home, in the workplace, and wherever we gather
as friends and neighbors, we must strive to uphold the dignity and
worth of every human being.''

   Walter Matthau, his reading glasses hanging
low on his nose, a yellow cap that says ``Mozart'' on his head,
runs a finger over the horse racing page in the morning newspaper.
   His sporting blood is not aroused and he folds the paper and
looks over the scene at the Beverly Hills Tennis Club where he has
come to talk about CBS's Sunday movie ``The Incident.''
   In ``The Incident,'' Matthau plays a lawyer, Harmon Cobb, who
reluctantly agrees to defend a German prisoner of war accused of
murdering a popular local doctor at a POW camp in the United States
during World War II.
   ``They tell me I have to defend him because they want a fair
trial and I'm the only qualified lawyer available,'' he says. ``I
don't want the case because my son's fighting in Europe, and during
the trial I get a telegram saying he's been killed in action.
   ``Harmon Cobb is an unassuming man, nondescript, quite ordinary.
He's not well off financially, he's intelligent and very fair.
That's the story. Regardless of his personal prejudices, he's going
to defend this man to the best of his ability.''
   ``The Incident,'' filmed on location in Colorado Springs, also
stars Susan Blakely as Matthau's daughter-in-law, Robert Carradine
as the prosecutor, Peter Firth as the German defendant, Barnard
Hughes as the victim, Harry Morgan as the judge and William
Shallert as the constable.
   It was directed by Joseph Sargent from a screenplay by Michael
and James Norell. Sargent directed Matthau in ``The Taking of
Pelham One Two Three.''
   Matthau began his career as a featured villain in ``The
Kentuckian'' in 1955. But he became a staple of screwball comedies
in the next two decades in such films as ``The Bad News Bears'' and
``The Sunshine Boys.''
   Among friends at the tennis club, Matthau also shows many sides
to his personality.
   Lifting his cap to examine the emblem, Matthau explains that
``Mozart'' is for the composer and not a race horse.
   ``I belong to the Mozart Club and you have to listen to 25 hours
a week of his music to join,'' he says.
   ``On my way here I was listening to his 24th piano concerto in a
minor key,'' he says, humming a few bars. ``Mozart was the only
composer who knew how to write music. Everyone else is a clumsy
oaf.''
   Matthau says he conducts the Los Angeles Mozart Orchestra and
the Beverly Hills Symphony for ``about 10 minutes'' once a year.
   Matthau had met the day before with playwright Neil Simon,
producer Howard Koch and Jack Lemmon to talk about a movie sequel
to ``The Odd Couple,'' the popular comedy about hopelessly
mismatched roommates.
   ``It's 25 years later and we see what's happening to `The Odd
Couple,''' says Matthau, who was the sloppy Oscar to Lemmon's
fastidious Felix in the 1968 movie version of Simon's Broadway
comedy. ``Felix's daughter and Oscar's son are getting married.
That's how we get together.''
   Matthau won a Tony for his role as Oscar in ``The Odd Couple''
on Broadway and a Tony for a supporting role in ``A Shot in the
Dark.'' He received an Academy Award as best supporting actor
playing with Lemmon in the 1966 movie ``Fortune Cookie'' _
portraying a lawyer who mixed greed and goofiness.
   The television movie is Matthau's first return to the medium in
a dramatic role since the 1970s. On PBS's ``Hollywood Television
Theatre'' in the 1970s he played Boris Thomashefsky, an actor in
the Jewish theater, in a play about Paul Muni. He recalls that he
narrated a PBS series on Shakespeare about 20 years ago. He starred
in the syndicated series ``Tallahassee 7000'' in 1961. He was
offered the role of Oscar in the series version of ``The Odd
Couple,'' but turned it down.
   Matthau's most recent American feature film was ``Couch Trip''
two years ago. Then he went to Italy to make ``Little Devils.''
   In ``Little Devils,'' he co-stars with Robert Benign. ``I play a
priest who exorcises the devil from this woman,'' he says. ``Then
the devil and I sort of pal around like `The Odd Couple.' It did
big business in Italy.''
   Matthau isn't sure what he's going to do next.
   ``Maybe I ought to do a play,'' he says. ``I'm getting tired of
waiting for a good script. I'll probably do more television. I'm
trying to do something with a little merit. I read a TV movie
script the other day, but they cast it with a younger guy.
   ``I've been asked to do a series, but I've sort of cooled that
idea. I don't want to do another series.'' He paused. ``Unless
something spectacular comes along. It's difficult to do good
quality scripts every week. The shows with good quality week after
week are few and far between.''

   The past seven months have seen rapid change in
South Africa's apartheid _ the system imposed more than 40 years
ago to keep the races apart. An Associated Press correspondent who
has watched the changes from his base in Johannesburg looks at
where apartheid stands now.

   ``Miracles are happening,''
said Olga Lutu, who runs a school in a black shantytown. ``Freedom
is a real possibility.''
   She was looking into the future.
   So, in his way, was T.J. Ferreira, a 39-year-old white service
station owner.
   ``I played sports with blacks and that didn't bother me,'' he
said. ``I didn't mind lunching with blacks. We just don't want to
be governed by them.''
   Apartheid, while not dead, is showing symptoms of terminal
illness and the question before South Africa now seems to be
whether it will die a peaceful or painful death.
   Growing numbers of South Africans across the political spectrum
_ from black activists to right-wing whites _ believe the last of
the major apartheid laws imposed in 1948 may be scrapped or
rendered ineffective within a year or two, possibly within months.
   However sweeping the legal changes, apartheid will leave a
legacy of mistrust, prejudice and economic inequality that may take
decades to overcome.
   But long-term worries are now coupled with a surge of optimism
among blacks following President F.W. de Klerk's decision to free
African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela and lift a 30-year
ban on his organization.
   ``Everybody came out of their houses when we heard the news, and
we were singing in the streets,'' said Mrs. Lutu, a robust,
energetic mother of four whose school is in a shantytown called
Orange Farms.
   She believes statutory apartheid will be gone within a few
years, a result of blacks' increasing willingness to challenge the
laws and the National Party government's increasing reluctance to
counter with repression.
   ``The people are liberating themselves,'' she said. ``Nothing
ever happens if people are quiet.''
   Apartheid has been crumbling slowly but steadily for more than a
decade. So-called ``petty apartheid'' _ segregation of theaters,
beaches and buses, among other things _ has ended in most areas,
and rural blacks no longer face legal barriers if they want to move
to a city.
   De Klerk has speeded up the pace of reform during his seven
months in office, asserting that discrimination is wrong and
proposing negotiations aimed at extending political rights to
blacks. Black militants are using their new maneuvering room to
press for abolition of the last crucial group of laws known as the
``pillars of apartheid.''
   These include the Group Areas Act, which mandates segregation of
residential areas; the Land Act, which prevents blacks from owning
land in more than 80 percent of South Africa; and the Population
Registration Act, which requires all South Africans to be
officially classified by race.
   These laws have enabled the government to exclude blacks from
national elections and persist with the last major categories of
segregation _ residential areas, state-run schools and public
hospitals.
   Service station owner Ferreira, an Afrikaner and a member of the
pro-apartheid Conservative Party, serves on the municipal council
in Boksburg, an industrial city near Johannesburg. He and other
Conservatives took control of the council in 1988 and reinstituted
``whites-only'' policies at recently integrated municipal
facilities.
   Ferreira, an outgoing man with a close-knit family, holds de
Klerk as a traitor to the Afrikaner people.
   He said white conservatives were prepared to fight _ or secede
into an all-white homeland _ if the government surrendered power to
blacks.
   If blacks moved into his comfortable middle-class neighborhood,
he said, ``they'll want what's ours. ... A group might decide they
like my house _ they'll come in and take it.''
   He expressed deep concern as well about the prospect of blacks
entering whites-only schools.
   ``Once that happens, there will be fights among the kids. Most
of our children have grown up wanting to be with their own
people,'' he said. ``And whose standard of education do we adopt?
The blacks are so far behind in evolution they'll never catch up.''
   But Theuns Eloff, a 34-year-old Afrikaner who has worked closely
with ANC-aligned groups, is happy with the way de Klerk is handling
things.
   ``The National Party has put into motion an irreversible process
which, within at the latest five years, will erode its power base
totally,'' he said.
   ``Apartheid is finished.''

   Eloff was reared in a loyal National Party family and became a
minister in the same branch of the Dutch Reformed Church to which
de Klerk belongs. But he quit this job and became a race-relations
consultant after church leaders criticized him for anti-apartheid
political activities that included participation in a 1987 meeting
with the ANC.
   Eloff says de Klerk's moves took him and other liberal
Afrikaners by surprise. He is now convinced the government will
remove the remaining apartheid laws and yield political power if
the ANC provides some sort of guarantees for minority rights.
   ``A majority of middle-ground Afrikaners will accept the change
_ grudgingly, but they'll accept it,'' he said. ``It will be
traumatic for some, but it's in fashion _ that will take them a
long way.''
   Other signs of the gradual softening of apartheid are in the
blacks themselves.
   Many have overcome immense economic and educational handicaps to
form a vast reservoir of professional and political talent.
   One is Cyril Dlova, 35.
   The son of a bank messenger, he now is the personnel director
for the South African subsidiary of a U.S. corporation, lives in
the well-off ``whites only'' Johannesburg suburb of Sandton and
sends his daughter to a private multiracial school.
   Officially, the only blacks allowed to reside in Sandton are
live-in servants. But Dlova says he's encountered no problems in
defying the now almost-unenforced Group Areas Act.
   ``Within days after we moved in, my neighbors came over,
bringing a cake to welcome me. My daughter swims in their pools,''
he said. ``It's the way this country should be.''
   Dlova, who asked that his company not be identified so he
wouldn't have to clear his remarks with his superiors, said racial
attitudes among white executives have changed slowly during his 10
years with the firm.
   ``When I came here, there was a feeling of `blacks can't do
anything.' Now they say maybe some blacks can do it. We must next
get to the stage where they believe all blacks can do it, if they
get the opportunity.''
   De Klerk is on record as saying whites should retain the right
to have segregated neighborhoods and schools. But the government
now allows communities the option of integrating, and education
officials recently dropped hints that at least some whites-only
schools could accept blacks if parents approved.
   The state-run television network, for years an unquestioning
defender of apartheid, now broadcasts news footage and interviews
that suggest integration might be a good thing.
   Mrs. Lutu says the government's attitude has changed markedly in
recent months, as evidenced by official willingness to let former
illegal squatters in her community gain ownership of property for
the first time in their lives.
   ``The pride they're showing now, in owning their own land, you
can see it,'' she said. ``Before, there was a feeling of despair.
They had lost dignity. The army would come in and wreck their
vehicles, take away goods, beat the youths. Now that has stopped.
The same people who used to raid us in the middle of the night are
helping provide land and facilities for us.''
   Many militant black leaders remain skeptical of the government's
ultimate intentions, but even ANC officials now say they believe
most whites are ready to give up on apartheid.
   Said Thabo Mbeki, the ANC's foreign affairs spokesman: ``I don't
imagine it will be terribly difficult to continue to be allies in
building a post-apartheid future if you have been allies in getting
rid of this unwanted past.''

   If South Africans need assurances that
apartheid can be dismantled peacefully and efficiently, they need
only look across their northern border into Namibia.
   For decades, the territory was subjected to virtually the same
system of racial segregation that prevailed in South Africa,
Namibia's ruler since World War I. The best equipped schools and
hospitals were reserved for whites, while blacks lived in rundown,
segregated townships or underdeveloped tribal reserves.
   Starting in 1978, the apartheid laws began to fall. By early
this year, as the territory headed toward independence on March 21,
the process was complete.
   Formerly all-white schools opened their doors to blacks without
incident. Hospitals did likewise. An assembly composed of political
parties on opposite sides during a 23-year guerrilla war
unanimously approved a constitution outlawing discrimination of all
kinds.
   At the ceremony in which the constitution was adopted, several
speakers said South Africa should take inspiration from Namibia's
harmonious independence process.
   ``We confounded the doubters,'' said Sam Nujoma, who led the
South-West Africa People's Organization during its long bush war
and now is Namibia's president-designate.
   One big difference between Namibia and South Africa is the size
of white population. About 75,000 of Namibia's 1.3 million people
are white, compared to 5 million out of 37 million in South Africa.
   But Namibia's whites play a comparable role to those in South
Africa, holding key posts in business, government, mining, health
care and other professions. Because of SWAPO's conciliatory
attitude, few whites have been leaving.
   ``Whites would like to offer their experiences, knowledge and
abilities to the country and its people. This will, however, only
take place if they are accepted as part of the country,'' said
Jannie de Wet, a leader of the largest white political party.
   Residential areas in Namibia have been opened to all races for
several years, although relatively few blacks have had the desire
or the money to move into well-to-do white neighborhoods.
   However, many SWAPO officials have settled in white areas since
returning from exile last year. Nujoma is one of the few
top-ranking SWAPO leaders to maintain residence in Katutura, the
main black area of Windhoek.
   Godfrey Gaoseb, named by Nujoma to be finance minister, said he
was escorted while house-hunting in white areas by a real estate
agent who is a conservative Afrikaner.
   ``We became such good friends that we now visit each other
frequently,'' he said.

<HEAD>Carol Burnett Stars in NBC Comedy Anthology</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carol Burnett may have come up with something
new on television, where recycling the past is usually the wave of
the future.
   In her anthology series for NBC, ``Carol &amp; Company,'' she'll
play a different character each week in what essentially are
one-act comedies.
   ``We put up a blank canvas every week and throw on the paint,''
Burnett said. ``Each story is character-driven and focuses on
relationships. In essence, it's a pilot every week. If someone
said, `Pick the most difficult form of television,' we'd pick this.
That's why no one's ever done it before.''
   The show will be shot live in front of an audience, featuring a
repertory company and, frequently, a guest star, Burnett said.
   ``Each week, we make a fresh start,'' she said. ``That's the
challenge for the actors, the writers, the set designers,
everybody. We're even doing a musical.''
   NBC has not yet set a premiere date for the show, but has said
it will begin in late March.
   Matt Williams, who created ABC's ``Roseanne,'' is the executive
producer and head writer. The repertory company is made up of Terry
Kiser, Meagan Fay, Richard Kind, Jeremy Piven and Anita Barone.
   Burnett, of course, starred for 12 years in ``The Carol Burnett
Show.'' But that show, like Fox's ``The Tracey Ullman Show,''
relied on skits.
   Most anthologies in the past were dramatic. There have been a
few comedy anthologies _ 1985's ``George Burns Comedy Week,'' for
instance _ but Burns merely introduced a filmed show with a
different cast each week.
   As with her old variety show, Burnett will come out and meet the
audience in the theater at the Disney Studio. Then she'll change
costumes and join the other actors. The story will be acted out in
sequence and, at the end, the actors will make a curtain call.
   ``It's important that the viewers see the audience,'' she said.
``We don't want anyone to think we're using canned laughter. I've
only done a few things for television without an audience. When I
started this, I said an audience was important, especially if
you're trying to be funny. Our players and guests are used to
working before an audience.''
   That wasn't always true on her variety series, where some of the
guests were movie stars who had worked only before a camera. Gloria
Swanson, who asked to take part after seeing Burnett's famous spoof
of ``Sunset Boulevard,'' was very nervous and had to be coaxed
through her song-and-dance role.
   Movie spoofs were a hallmark of Burnett's old show, an outgrowth
of a childhood filled with countless hours in movie theaters.
   Recently, she attended the American Cinema Awards.
   ``I was in heaven,'' Burnett said. ``Every old movie star was
there _ Ann Blyth, Huntz Hall, June Allyson, Turhan Bey. It took
almost an hour to introduce everybody. People were just dying at
seeing these people.
   ``We haven't done any spoofs yet on our new show,'' she said,
``but we did do a takeoff on the film noir detective films of the
1940s, the Dick Powell kind of thing in `Murder, My Sweet' in which
you spat out the dialogue like bullets. We did it mainly to
introduce our repertory company. That's as close as we've gotten to
a spoof. We're really doing stories.''
   In one show, Burnett plays the matriarch of a television soap
opera who appears to be a terror until you see her with a security
guard played by Robert Guillaume. In another, she's an eccentric
woman who shows up on a dock in Gulfport, Miss., where Nell Carter
is fishing. Her only concern is that she's going to be abducted by
space aliens.
   Glenda Jackson is a radio pop psychologist in another show in
which Burnett shows up at the station to say the psychologist's
advice ruined her life. Another spotlights a woman who surprises a
few people when she goes to her high school reunion. In yet
another, Burnett and Alex Rocco play a romantic couple who continue
to work together in a scientific laboratory.
   Burnett also has her own production company, Kalola Productions,
at the Disney Studio, in partnership with former television
newswoman Marcia Brandwynne. Kalola is doing an interview show for
the Disney Channel called ``A Conversation With ...,'' in which
Burnett so far has interviewed Bob Hope, George Burns and Betty
White.
   Kalola has a number of feature and television movies and a TV
series in development with various branches of Walt Disney
Productions.
   Anna Phelan Hamilton, who wrote ``Mask'' and ``Gorillas in the
Mist,'' is writing a movie based on Burnett's autobiography, ``One
More Time.'' A movie musical called ``Rehearsal Club'' is based on
Burnett's early life on Broadway, and a movie version of ``Once
Upon a Mattress,'' the stage musical that made her a star, is in
the works.
   ``I'm going to be like Alfred Hitchcock and have cameos in all
these movies,'' she said. ``In `Once Upon a Mattress,' I'll
probably be the queen. We'll have a big talent search for someone
to play my old role as Winifred.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: `Hunt for Red October'</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Film opens nationwide on March 2.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Tom Clancy's high-tech thrillers have been a phenomenon of the
publishing industry. Although jammed with scientific data, his
novels have been bought by millions of readers. Despite their
immense popularity and tense drama, none has been dramatized on the
screen until now.
   That's understandable. Clancy's labyrinthian plots and
dependence on military hardware for suspense require the most deft
of treatment on film. ``The Hunt for Red October'' is fortunate in
that regard. It is a nail-biter from beginning to end.
   Like the book, the film requires close attention; the slightest
blip on the sonar screen could mean destruction of a nuclear
submarine. The casual viewer should stay home.
   Red October (named for the month of the Russian Revolution in
1917) is the new Soviet submarine, one with fish-like gills that
allows it to voyage undetected. Capt. Ramius (Sean Connery) heads
the sub west on an unauthorized mission in the pre-Gorbachev era.
   Both the Soviet and U.S. fleets mobilize to chase Ramius. The
Soviets realize he and his officers plan to defect. The Americans,
misinformed by Moscow, fear he is a maverick who might launch a
nuclear attack on the United States
   CIA agent Jack Ryan (Alec Baldwin), with experience in analyzing
the Soviet navy, is enlisted to track down the Red October. Aiding
the pursuit is a Los Angeles-class nuclear sub commanded by Scott
Glenn, with a wizard sonar operator, Courtney B. Vance.
   Larry Ferguson and Donald Stewart did a terrific job of
compressing a huge novel into a playable screenplay. John McTiernan
proved with ``Die Hard'' that he can stretch suspense almost to the
breaking point, and he exceeds himself with ``The Hunt for Red
October.''
   What a marvel Sean Connery is. His dialogue is laconic, but that
great Scottish face reveals everything in his mind. Alec Baldwin
makes the leap to stellar status with absolute ease. Kevin Costner,
Harrison Ford and Mel Gibson: Make room for the new kid.
   Outstanding in the virtually all-male cast are Glenn, Vance,
James Earl Jones, Sam Neill, Richard Jordan and Peter Firth.
   Mace Neufeld as producer performed the almost superhuman task in
putting together the multitude of details for ``The Hunt for Red
October.'' The Paramount Pictures release is rated PG for minor
swearing and tension. Running time: 125 minutes.

   ``New York Stories'' (Touchstone. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated PG)
   
   ``New York Stories'' was a disaster during its theatrical
release. But it might play better on the small screen at home
because you can always zoom to your favorite vignette and skip the
others.
   It began as an excellent idea: Take three top American
filmmakers, set them out on the streets of New York and loop their
efforts into one full-length feature to celebrate those collective
talents and the city they supposedly enshrined.
   Unfortunately, the idea doesn't quite gel. The video consists of
three vignettes by Martin Scorsese, Frances Coppola and Woody
Allen. But only Scorsese's ``Life Lessons'' is worth the $89.95 or
cost of rental. It's also the first story in the production so you
don't even need to touch the remote. Unless you're an unconditional
Woody Allen fan, skip the next two.
    ``Life Lessons'' is the only vignette that truly mirrors the
spirit and attitude of New York _ in this case, the downtown art
world. It has a feel, texture and mood, thanks in part to the
gritty and witty original screenplay by Bronx-born writer Richard
Price, and the sensitive and probing lens of the celebrated
cinematographer Nestor Almendros. It is a tigHeinrich
Thyssen-Bornemisza, including works by 19 artists whose major
painting are rare in this country, including Ernst Ludwig Kirchner,
Emil Nolde, Paul Klee, Erich Heckel and Franz Marc. Through March
25.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Costner's Fond Memories of Puerto Vallarta</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PUERTO VALLARTA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kevin Costner has a special
memory about the sunswept seaside resort of Puerto Vallarta.
   ``I was here about 12 years ago on my honeymoon. At that time I
was considering being an actor. On the plane out of Puerto
Vallarta, I ran into Richard Burton and thought to talk to him. I
had to devise a plan to get at him, because he wanted his privacy _
which I completely understand now,'' Costner said.
   ``He had blocked out four seats so he could be alone. After we
were in the air, I sat down beside him, and I asked him about the
job of acting. He was very gracious and helpful.
   ``My wife and I had saved $20 to take the bus from LAX (Los
Angeles International Airport) back to Orange County. But we hadn't
counted on the Mexican airport tax of $10 apiece. So when we got
off the plane we had about $6 between us. We sat down on our
suitcases on one of those islands at LAX, just like the hitchhiking
scene from `It Happened One Night.'
   ``As we were sitting there, a limousine stopped right by us. The
window came down, and it was Richard Burton saying `good luck.' He
thought to say one last thing to me. The window went up and he
drove away. It was kinda nice, just like a scene out of a movie.''
The Costners managed to hitchhike home.
   When Costner returned to Puerto Vallarta last year, he didn't
stay at a tiny hotel near the airport, as he had on his honeymoon.
He came with all the perks of a superstar to do location work for
the movie ``Revenge,'' the love triangle in which he stars with
Anthony Quinn and Madeleine Stowe. As evidence of his new status,
Costner also served as executive producer.
   Costner, 34, returned here for a round of interviews at the
elegant Camino Real Hotel to publicize the opening of ``Revenge.''
Normally publicity-shy, he answered questions dutifully though he
seemed to be wishing he was back home in La Canada, near Pasadena.
   The actor chose to make ``Revenge'' before the Academy
Award-nominated ``Field of Dreams,'' though filming came afterward.
He found the Jim Harrison novel to be ``a fabulous piece of
material, a tough-line movie; I move toward that kind of writing.''
   e added that he has picked all of his films since ``The Big
Chill,'' in which his role as one of the Sixties radicals was
reduced to a scene at his own funeral.
   What does he look for?
   ``I look for the same thing that a lot of people do: fresh air,
originality of concept. Things that surprise me, little things
inside a movie that move me. All those things combined hopefully
become a satisfying experience. You can't do a movie just because
you've always wanted to do a violent one or a comedy. You have to
do one that makes sense to you.''
   His post as executive producer, he admitted, was ``not the
wisest move in a sense, because it's not a very meaningful title.
Not to put it down or the people who gave it to me. I've had as
much power on other films as to the quality of my arguments or
points.''
   In ``Revenge,'' Costner faced a legendary actor with great
screen presence, Quinn. He was unfazed.
   ``I've had a lot of experience with those kinds of guys: Gene
Hackman (`No Way Out'), Sean Connery (`The Untouchables'), Burt
Lancaster (`Field of Dreams'),'' he said.
   ``One thing is, you don't compete with them, that's for sure.
That's a lesson in acting: that you don't compete. These guys are
legendary, and the movie is so much better off by their being
there. I have plenty of time to get my own share of viewing. As far
as I'm concerned, when those guys are on the set, they're the stars
of the movie.''
   Costner was not only the star of his last movie, ``Dances With
Wolves,'' but director and co-producer. The story of a Civil War
soldier who moves into the world of the Sioux Indians has been the
subject of rumors that he soared over budget and schedule. Costner
bristled when asked about the reports.
   ``The control of that movie is entirely on my shoulders, so its
fate I take full responsibility for,'' he said. ``The rumors seem
to me kind of silly. There have to be more important things to talk
about than me going 2 or 3 percent over my budget.
   ``Budgets in movies are at best an estimation of things. I went
a lot of days over, but the interesting thing is that we went only
3 percent over budget. We managed our money very well.
   ``When you see the size of the movie, (you'll realize) no one in
town could make that movie except us. We made a movie that in a
studio concept would be a $30 to $40 million movie. The numbers
that are being mentioned are not correct. It's less than $18
million. I'm not going to tell you what it is, because I haven't
completed the movie.
   ``It's convenient to say `Kevin's Gate' (as in `Heaven's Gate'
or Watergate). That's kind of cute journalism that I don't really
like.''
   Kevin Costner is a California boy, son of an electric utility
worker who moved the family from town to town. He was a runt in
high school, and though he grew to 6-foot-1 in college, he remained
shy and dateless. Like many actors, he countered his shyness with
drama classes.
   After graduation from California State University at Fullerton,
he married his only date, Cindy Silva, and tried a marketing job
for 30 days. He quit in disgust to seek work in Hollywood. For six
years he worked by day on crews at Raleigh Studio and studied
acting at night. ``The Big Chill'' provided his breakthrough for a
major motion picture, but his role of the dead friend was edited
down to merely a scene showing him in his coffin. This was followed
by his riproaring gunslinger in ``Silverado.''
   Costner now faces the instant recognizability that he observed
with Richard Burton. Can he maintain any privacy?
   ``I can,'' he said. ``People are actually very good with me.
Sometimes they have strong feelings, and they want to talk to me.
I'm still a citizen, I'm a citizen of the world. I can go places.
I'm actually treated the way everybody should be treated. My
(private) world has closed behind me, but a new one has opened up.''

   Roll over Beethoven, go powder your wig Bach.
Meet the newest musical sensation: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
   ``I think that nowadays Mozart appeals to more people in more
countries on more levels than any other composer who ever lived,''
says musicologist H.C. Robbins Landon, whose ``1791: Mozart's Last
Year'' was a best-seller in 1988, and whose new book, ``Mozart: the
Golden Years,'' looks at the last decade of Mozart's life.
   ``It used to be Beethoven and Bach,'' he said. ``Now it is
certainly Mozart. Ambivalent music speaks to an ambivalent age.
   ``With Beethoven, the music starts stormily and ends
triumphantly in C major. The message is much more diffuse and
cloudy in Mozart. You often don't really know whether the music
you're listening to is very happy or unhappy. Maybe it is both. All
this appeals emotionally to people nowadays who have begun to think
the world is in dreadful danger and all is not straightforward.
   ``One of the most famous, the `Elvira Madigan' movement, is
ambivalent music. Is it happy? People don't know why they love it,
but they love it. It obviously has a very special message. ...
Nothing becomes a best seller by accident.''
   Robbins Landon, who was born in Boston in 1926 and now lives in
France, has written 16 books. Most are about Haydn and Mozart.
   ``My life has been dedicated to music,'' he said. ``The
principal thing I've done is to have published Haydn's music _
21,000 pages of Haydn in score. When I was young, nine-tenths of
Haydn wasn't published. Now nine-tenths of Haydn is published.
   ``That was a great labor of love. You don't live from that. I
used to do a lot of TV scripts, mostly for the BBC. I'm doing them
again now. At the moment I'm writing a five-part history of music
in Venice, a triple production by London, Paris and PBS in this
country.''
   From studying Mozart's music, Robbins Landon found the composer
to have had a split personality. ``He was writing music easily
comprehensible to 18th century buffs, and he was writing far-out
stuff with extreme violence. Why was of course a mystery. Then I
read this theory of Dr. Peter G. Davies that Mozart was manic
depressive or had those tendencies.
   ``Dr. Davies published long, scholarly articles on Mozart's
illness. I've quoted them. His ups and downs came in waves. When he
had downs, he felt compelled to compose in minor keys which were so
far out of their time. When Don Giovanni goes to hell, that's
far-out music. He must have known the public wouldn't have known
what to do with these things.
   ``His piano concertos in D minor and C minor began to alienate
the public. They began to be the cause of Mozart's concerts in
Vienna being less well attended and unattended. From 1787 on,
Mozart began to get into debt, because of the fact his far-out
music was not comprehensible to the average concertgoer. It wasn't
until 1791, the last year of his life, that he began to extricate
himself from a mountain of debts.''
   Robbins Landon called the Academy Award-winning ``Amadeus'' a
great film, which awakened much interest in Mozart. ``What people
don't understand is that it's not a biography of Mozart. They never
said it was. They said they were producing a film about mediocrity
and jealousy and they used Mozart's life as a very successful prop
to tell the story.''
   The musicologist's new book is based on Johann Pezzl's
day-by-day chronicle of Mozart in Vienna from 1786 to 1790.
``Mozart: the Golden Years'' is published here by Schirmer and
sells for $29.95.
   Robbins Landon was given the idea for his life's work by his
piano teacher when he was 13.
   ``He said: `You're never going to be the greatest pianist in the
world. You ought to do something for Haydn. All the other composers
have their collective works. We don't know how much Haydn wrote. A
lot of manuscripts are in private possession.' He said I had to
turn myself into a fully trained professional musician,'' Robbins
Landon recalled.
   ``I ended up going to Boston where I conducted and managed an
orchestra and formed a chamber orchestra. With some pals I studied
counterpoint and harmony. We were happy young people doing music
all day long.
   ``My parents, upper class New Englanders, said, `If we don't
help you, you won't make it.' They helped me up to writing a
five-volume biography of Haydn, which was published by Indiana
University Press. It's a real monster. It did end up making money
but you can't live from that. They sent me nice fat checks now and
then to keep me going.
   ``After I'd done what any single person can do for Haydn, then I
went to Mozart, always the great love of my life.''
   Robbins Landon has been married for 32 years to Austrian
historian Else Radant.
   ``She helps me,'' he said. ``She does a lot of research. We live
outside Toulouse with secretaries and assistants. We don't have any
cross words with anybody in our house. It's nice to work in an
atmosphere like that.''
   They all work hard, swim, take five-mile walks, eat garlic,
vegetables from their garden, often broil fish and drink the local
wine.
   The secret of a happy life, the musicologist says, ``is not your
career or money. If you have a happy marriage, everything else you
can work out.''
   The Mozarts loved each other, Robbins Landon said. ``He wrote
her pornographic letters from Leipsig which I published for the
first time in the new book. Nowadays it is nothing. It is sweet.''
   If he'd been in Vienna in Mozart's day, Robbins Landon says, ``I
would have been a good, routine kapellmeister (music director). I
can compose and conduct. If I'd had my wits about me I would have
thought Mozart was the greatest thing that ever happened. ... I'm
sure he was difficult.
   ``He couldn't stand mediocrity and was arrogant with
non-professionals. I hope I would have been his friend.''

   Mystic and spiritual are not usually terms
associated with a heavy metal band. Neither are introspective and
cerebral.
   But the British band The Cult is an exception.
   Lead singer Ian Astbury springs from the same mold that produced
Jim Morrison, the late lead vocalist of the Doors. With his long,
ink-black hair, vaulted cheekbones and penchant for wearing leather
and snakeskin, Astbury looks more like an ancient medicine man than
a rock singer.
   His foil, blond guitarist Billy Duffy, grounds Astbury's
otherworldliness with a hard rock perspective and balances the
singer's brooding seriousness with his own devil-may-care
personality. The band is rounded out by bassist-rhythm guitarist
Jamie Stewart and drummer Matt Sorum.
   The Cult's first U.S. release, 1985's ``Love,'' kept them in the
college radio spotlight with the meticulously arranged track ``She
Sells Sanctuary.'' The album's swirling psychedelic lyrics and
jangly, melodic guitar work pigeonholed the band into a genre known
as Gothic, a trend started in Britain in the early '80s.
   By their next album, ``Electric,'' in 1987, the bant released in England
and Europe,'' Duffy said.
   ``We did a lot of our dirty laundry in public. College
alternative fans in America liked those recordings. To us, they're
very fledgling, kind of experimental. They have their moments, but
they're not very relevant to where The Cult is now.''
   Part of The Cult's mystique stems from Astbury's interest in
American Indian myth and culture. Such songs as ``Brother Wolf,
Sister Moon,'' from ``Love,'' and ``American Horse,'' from ``Sonic
Temple,'' depict not only the Indian's struggle with the white man,
but the folklore he created in trying to determine his own destiny.
   ``The interest in Indians was more prevalent in the earlier days
of the band, in Southern Death Cult,'' Duffy says. ``Ian's interest
is still there, but he's matured. He has said, `I'm a white,
working-class guy from the northwest of England who happens to
personally feel very strongly an affinity for the American Indian.'
It's not to the point of a flag-flying exercise.
   ``Ian's angle is that they do their own thing, they exist, they
have their own dignity within themselves. The last thing they need
is some two-bob rock n' roll band carrying a flag for them.''
   Duffy said the band's philosophy is simple.
   ``The Cult got together because we had the desire to make music
together as individuals,'' Duffy said. ``We all wanted to make a
kind of music that no one in Britain seemed to be interested in
doing at the time.
   ``From that, we still maintain that basic desire _ we dig what
we do, we're genuinely excited about the records we make and the
songs we write. We like to go out and play that to people and share
it.''
   Duffy doesn't see another style change coming down the line. ``I
think that thick sound, that professional sound, will be there, but
it will still be very human,'' he said.
   The band began its current tour of the United States and Canada
in San Francisco on Dec. 27.

<HEAD>Books and Authors: The Enduring Navajo and Tony Hillerman</HEAD>

   Judging from Tony Hillerman's books,
you might think he's Navajo, and many Navajos are surprised to
learn he's not.
   That's because Hillerman has captured American Indian cultures,
particularly Navajo, as no other novelist.
   In 1987, he was given a ``Special Friend of the Navajo'' award
to go with his Edgar Allan Poe Award for best mystery of 1973,
``Dance Hall of the Dead.'' His last two books, ``A Thief of Time''
and ``Talking God,'' have been best sellers, and he now has a $1.25
million contract with Harper &amp; Row.
   His latest book, ``Coyote Waits,'' is scheduled for June _ just
in time to start making his first movie. Hillerman has a
three-picture deal with Robert Redford. Filming starts this summer
on an adaptation of his 1982 novel, ``The Dark Wind.'' Hillerman
serves as consultant.
   The author, Redford, producers Sarah Pillsbury and Midge Sanford
and film executive Bonnie Lee toured the reservation in a rented
station wagon with Redford driving, discussing which of Hillerman's
Navajo police mysteries should be the first film.
   ``Dark Wind,'' in which Navajo and Hopi cops solve drug-related
murders, was chosen because of its mixture of two Indian cultures.
It will be directed by Errol Morris (``The Thin Blue Line'').
   ``It seemed to me that since so many people who go to movies are
the kind of people who think all Indians are alike, it would be
good to put two quite different tribes in,'' he said.
   ``I had taken for granted Redford was going to start with `Thief
of Time.' He wants to direct that one himself,'' said Hillerman,
leaning back against the antique pigeonhole desk he got from an old
hotel office. Above is the ``Friend of the Navajo'' plaque and a
framed drawing of Navajo ceremonial masks.
   On his left, above his word processor, is a map of Indian
country _ eastern Arizona, western New Mexico and southern Utah and
Colorado _ and a window overlooking a back yard terraced with old
railroad ties and bricks.
   His is a modest brick home in an average Albuquerque
neighborhood.
   Redford, reached while filming in the Dominican Republic, said
he likes working with the 64-year-old author.
   ``He is very unfettered by either success or too much trouble
around him,'' Redford said. ``He travels his own route and at his
own pace. He's rare in that he has that wonderful sense of
structure of storytelling and a very clear eye as to the real
nature of the Navajo.''
   Born Anthony Grove Hillerman on May 27, 1925, in Sacred Heart,
Okla., the son of a storekeeper, young Tony was his high school
class historian but never gave much thought to writing.
   ``I kind of liked to write and I read a lot, but I didn't know
real human beings were writers,'' he said. ``I mean writers and
writing were not something in the imagination of a kid growing up
out there.''
   The idea took seed when a wounded Hillerman returned on
convalescent furlough from France during World War II. A land mine
explosion had shattered his left leg and severely burned his left
eye. The leg still bothers him sometimes, and he never regained
full use of the eye.
   Beatrice Stahl, a feature writer for The Daily Oklahoman in
Oklahoma City, had done a story based on Hillerman's letters home,
and now she wanted to interview him. ``So I went down there and
talked to her. She told me I ought to be a writer.''
   He took her advice and studied journalism at the University of
Oklahoma. He graduated amid a flood of war-delayed students in
1948, and he couldn't find a job on a newspaper.
   ``So I took a job with an advertising agency writing radio
commercials. It was just a try-out job doing ads for Cain's Better
Coffee and Purina Pig Chow,'' he said.
   At Oklahoma he met his wife, Marie. They now have six grown
children.
   He also took a job driving a truck hauling oil field supplies.
One stop was the Navajo reservation in New Mexico. On one run, he
saw Navajos on horseback in ceremonial attire for the Enemy Way, a
soul-cleansing ritual that follows combat. They, too, were
returning veterans.
   ``Of course most of them served in the Pacific,'' he said.
   Something about them touched him, and he never forgot. From then
on, he said, New Mexico was his ultimate destination.
   When Hillerman got the chance to be bureau manager for United
Press International in Santa Fe, he grabbed it. He served as
executive editor of The New Mexican in Santa Fe after leaving the
wire service.
   During the Santa Fe stint, he covered a story in which a
Jicarilla Apache police officer was shot to death. The
investigation showed the fallen officer had coolly shifted his
revolver from his wounded arm to his good hand and had shot one of
his assailants before dying. The Indian was the model for Navajo
detective Lt. Joe Leaphorn, mainstay of Hillerman's novels.
   Hillerman had sold some non-fiction through a New York agent.
When he offered her the manuscript in the late 1960s for his first
Leaphorn novel, ``The Blessing Way,'' she told him: ``Just get rid
of all the Indian stuff.''
   ``Probably it was fairly good advice, but it wasn't what I
wanted to do,'' he said. An editor at Harper &amp; Row liked it, Indian
stuff and all. It was published in 1970.
   Navajos tell Hillerman they like his books because they're true
to Navajo culture, and the Navajos come out winners. In fact, he
said, many Navajos express surprise upon learning he's not a Navajo
himself.
   ``I run into that when I sign books around the reservation,'' he
said.
   Despite the mystery, witchcraft and violence of his books,
Hillerman bristles at any suggestion the reservation might be a
dangerous place.
   ``In the Navajo culture, all goals are toward harmony, being
peaceful, working together. People who turn against this are the
worst kind of people,'' he said when asked to define a Navajo witch.
   What does he like most about the Navajo?
   ``I like their emphasis on taking care of the family,'' he said.
``I like the dignity they give their women. I like their attitude
about material possessions. They just don't attach any importance
to them. There's the idea that if you own too much, you probably
aren't taking care of your family.
   ``I like the emphasis they have on beauty, aesthetics _ so many
Navajos seem to have a good eye for the sunset, the pleasing design.
   ``I like their sense of humor, their stoic endurance of whatever
comes down. They endure.''

   For a mystery writer, there's probably
nothing more mysterious than Navajo culture. Author Tony Hillerman
is fascinated by it, and so, apparently, are his readers.
   Coming off his second straight New York Times best seller,
``Talking God,'' Hillerman continues to examine Indian cultural
themes in ``Coyote Waits,'' due for publication in June.
   A Navajo shaman is a pivotal figure in ``Coyote Waits.'' In
``The Dark Wind,'' the first of Hillerman's books destined for
film, Hopi religion comes into play. In ``Dance Hall of the Dead''
it is Zuni religion. In ``The Blessing Way'' and ``Skinwalkers''
Navajo witchcraft is a central theme.
   Navajo police Lt. Joe Leaphorn, Hillerman's main character, is a
skeptic about witchcraft, but in several books he refers back to
one of his early cases in which he failed to take it seriously and
several people lost their lives.
   In a recent interview, Hillerman said witchcraft is real enough
and common enough to the Navajo. Navajo acquaintances have given
him several anecdotes, but there are many examples in scholarly
literature, as well.
   Hillerman related a story one Navajo once told him about seeing
a witch.
   ``It always takes place in the evening or night,'' Hillerman
said. ``It was shearing time, lambing time, and it was one of those
copper sunsets. Right on the horizon a quarter-mile or so away, he
saw the witch, a skinwalker with the head of a coyote.''
   The boy's grandmother told him to run and get his .22-caliber
rifle, and the youth took a shot at the witch.
   ``I asked him, `Did you hit him, Kenneth?' He said, `Nah, it was
a Navajo .22.'''
   Another anecdote involves an elderly weaver who called in a
crystal gazer to counteract a witch. A Durango, Colo., businessman
and his wife drove the gazer out to the woman's home and watched as
he did his ritual, Hillerman said. Staring into the crystal, the
gazer claimed the witch was a neighbor and had buried something
down the road, presumably to cause her a problem.
   ``The wife sat next to the crystal gazer and got a real strange
look on her face,'' Hillerman said. ``She said, `My God, it was
just like watching television.' She saw the same things in the
crystal that he was describing.''
   Then they went to the spot in the road, and the gazer dug up the
thing.
   ``In the Navajo culture, all goals are toward harmony, being
peaceful, working together. People who turn against this are the
worst kind of people,'' he said.
   Hillerman, who says he has learned most of what he knows about
Navajos from books, has a framed drawing of Navajo ceremonial masks
above his desk. Each mask personifies a yei, or Navajo god. And the
ceremonies and masks continually turn up in his books.
   Kokopelli, the Water Sprinkler, is a key image in ``A Thief of
Time.'' A sacred mask of Talking God kept at the Smithsonian
Institution becomes a lethal weapon in the 1989 novel, ``Talking
God.'' And such rituals as the Blessing Way, the Enemy Way and
others give texture and color to Hillerman's stories, which mix
gentle Navajo traditions with the jarring intrusion of hard-edged
Anglo culture.
   For the latter, the author said, all he needs to do is read the
newspaper.

   Many of best-selling novelist Tony
Hillerman's characters are scholars _ archaeologists, professors,
curators and graduate assistants.
   His central character, Navajo detective Lt. Joe Leaphorn, has a
degree in anthropology.
   His lateset book, ``Coyote Waits,'' involves a train robbery and
a feud between two professors of Western history.
   Here's a bibilography of Hillerman's previous novels:
   _``The Blessing Way,'' 1970: Leaphorn and a professor friend
pursue a Navajo witch.
   _``The Fly on the Wall,'' 1971: A novel of legislative intrigue.
   _``Dance Hall of the Dead,'' 1973: Leaphorn tracks a mysterious
Zuni dancer while following a trail of bodies. Hillerman won an
Edgar Allen Poe Award from the Mystery Writers of America in 1974.
   _``Listening Woman,'' 1978: Leaphorn goes up against a militant
Indian activist amid more murderous machinations.
   _``People of Darkness,'' 1980: Introduces officer Jim Chee, a
bright young detective who falls in love with a white woman and
confronts a coldblooded killer.
   _``The Boy Who Made Dragonfly,'' 1980: A story for young people.
   _``The Dark Wind,'' 1982: To become the first of a series of
motion pictures based on Hillerman's books. Chee and Hopi deputy
sheriff Cowboy Dashee solve some drug-related murders.
   _``The Ghostway,'' 1985: Starts with murder at a Shiprock car
wash and leads Chee to Los Angeles.
   _``Skinwalkers,'' 1987: Leaphorn and Chee are united on a series
of apparently witch-related homicide cases.
   _``A Thief of Time,'' 1988: The Leaphorn-Chee tandem tackles
artifact thievery, an archaeologist's disappearance and, of course,
murder during an investigation that leads Leaphorn to the
art-auction jungle of New York.
   _``Talking God,'' 1989: A body dumped near the tracks sends
Leaphorn and Chee off in apparently unrelated directions only to
find they're working on the same case in Washington.
   Hillerman also has written or edited non-fiction books,
including ``The Great Taos Bank Robbery,'' ``Rio Grande,'' ``New
Mexico,'' ``The Spell of New Mexico'' and ``Indian Country.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Garth Brooks' Songs Are From the Heart</HEAD>

   Rising country music singer Garth Brooks
says his songs are ``a piece of my heart.''
   The 27-year-old singer-songwriter-guitarist has had two hit
records with the first two songs released from his debut album,
``Garth Brooks.''
   His ``If Tomorrow Never Comes,'' which was No. 1 on the country
music charts in December, is about the need to tell loved ones that
you love them.
   His ``Too Young (to Feel This Damn Old),'' about a rodeo
contestant whose only friends are lonely women and bad booze, was a
hit record last summer.
   ``You have to let your heart talk,'' Brooks said in an
interview. ``If you just let what's in your heart out, you are
true.''
   Brooks, a native of Tulsa, Okla., where he was the last of six
children, has had a rapid rise since moving to Nashville in June
1987. Prior to that, he was a student at Oklahoma State University
where he was a javelin thrower for the school track team.
   He also sang with the group Santa Fe, a regional band that
performed throughout Oklahoma, Texas and New Mexico.
   After relocating to Nashville, he took a job running a boot
store. He was able to earn a living while pushing his music career,
an arrangement some other aspiring singers do not have.
   ``I got the manager's job and got to hire one employee, my
wife,'' he said. ``I had a very fortunate start.''
   Brooks, whose stocky frame is usually capped off with a spiffy
cowboy hat, also began singing on songwriters' demonstration tapes:
tapes of new, unrecorded songs that composers play for record
companies in hopes of getting them chosen for albums.
   But his real break came when Capitol Records' executives heard
him perform at a Nashville Entertainment Association showcase.
Based on this performance, he signed a recording contract with
Capitol.
   Brooks has joined a handful of other young singers who are
apparently going to shape the country music sound of the 1990s.
   ``You just pray that you are going to be one of the chosen ones
still around in five, 15, 20 years,'' he said.
   He senses a change in country music themes, a change that has
earned his style of music a growing number of fans.
   ``Country music isn't `My dad got run over at the truck wash
right after my wife left me this morning.' The music is set in a
manner that everybody can relate to, not just the guy driving the
truck. It's very real and people are turning to it. It's not
stereotyped any more,'' he said.
   ``The music has got to be real. I look for things the common man
would say, such as the guy at Wal-Mart. Real people today are going
to Wal-Mart.''
   The cuts on his first album, many of which he wrote or co-wrote,
are touching tunes of emotion and life's roadblocks.
   The song ``Cowboy Bill'' is about a cowboy storyteller who
thrilled kids with stories about his days as a Texas Ranger. Adults
doubted his veracity until he was found dead with his badge.
   The cut ``The Dance'' is about the good times before losing a
loved one.
   In ``Every Time That It Rains,'' Brooks sings about a romantic
fling that loses its intensity the second time around.
   His ``If Tomorrow Never Comes'' was so evocative that he
received a letter from a Virginia woman who said she was
contemplating suicide until hearing the song and studying its
message.
   ``She said that ever since then, her life has been turned
around,'' Brooks said. ``Your songs are your swords, your power.
It's amazing the size of the sword you carry.
   ``I'm looking for beliefs that need to be stated in this day and
time.
   ``I try to let people know that they aren't working for nothing,
that what they see when they close their eyes at night doesn't
always have to be a dream.''

   Hoping to keep the film and television
industry happy and busy in New York, officials have canceled a plan
to charge $1,000 a day to use state parks as scenic backdrops.
   That charge would have applied to photographers and TV and film
crews working on movies, TV shows or advertisements. The plan was
unveiled last month as part of Gov. Mario Cuomo's $51.3 billion
state budget proposal.
   Officials from the State Office of Parks, Recreation and
Historic Preservation thought it would have been a good way to
raise about $200,000 a year for what Cuomo has said is a
cash-starved state treasury. And the fees could have been imposed
without legislative approval.
   Economic Development spokesman Harold Holzer said the filmmaking
in New York is important to the state's economy. Such movies as
``Ishtar'' and ``Arthur'' have made use of New York's state parks.
   Since 1985, the state has been allowing the industry to use its
150 parks and 34 historic sites without charge.

<HEAD>`Granny Bashing' Think Tank Strangled by Founder's Ethics Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP BRASHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Dave Durenberger had high hopes for a
think tank he founded in 1984, Americans for Generational Equity,
to sound an alarm about the bleak future he saw facing his
children's generation.
   The baby boomer lobby group stirred a national debate on such
issues as Social Security and housing while enraging advocates of
the elderly with claims older Americans were getting an unfair
share of federal largesse.
   But mounting ethics problems that threaten Durenberger's career
claimed his brainchild and silenced its voice at a time many people
think AGE was just growing up.
   AGE's blue-ribbon board of directors closed the organization's
doors and fired its staff last month after the group ran out of
money, facing $40,000 in unpaid bills.
   An ongoing ethics investigation of Durenberger and charges by
the group's former director that the Minnesota Republican used AGE
for political purposes made fund raising virtually impossible,
board members say.
   ``I hate to see it just evaporate,'' lamented board member
Richard Lamm, the former Colorado governor who harbors hopes of
resurrecting the group.
   AGE never had more than a few hundred members, and in its heyday
was run by a staff of four on the cluttered ground floor of a
Capitol Hill townhouse. But for good or ill, supporters and
detractors alike say AGE brought public attention to ``generational
equity.''
   Lamm, who once said terminally ill people ``had a duty to die
and get out of the way,'' says AGE's writings and conferences
raised valid allegations that government policies enriched the
elderly to the eventual detriment of children and working-age
Americans.
   ``Fair is fair. ... Money that's desperately needed for children
in St. Paul is being transferred to millionaires in St.
Petersburg,'' Lamm said.
   But AGE's detractors, whose ranks include the powerful American
Association of Retired Persons and Families USA, accused the group
of fomenting generational warfare with ``granny-bashing'' rhetoric.
   ``The message that came loud and clear is we've got to cut the
benefit programs for seniors. I think that's why people responded
to them so negatively,''' said Ron Pollack, executive director of
Families USA, an advocacy organization for the elderly and their
families.
   ``They sought to divide people up on generational grounds. Most
people really think in family terms and they don't think of grandma
and grandpa as being evil and young people as being saints.''
   Durenberger and the group's acting chairman, Rep. Tim Penny,
D-Minn., claim that was not the intention.
   Durenberger, who declined to be interviewed, formed AGE at a
time when Sen. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., was warning that more and
more children were growing up poor while the elderly enjoyed the
lowest poverty rate of any age group.
   ``We have entered an era in which the date of one's birth has
become the prime determinate of one's prospects for realizing the
American dream,'' Durenberger said in a 1987 interview.
   Besides Lamm, AGE's board included Stanford University President
Donald Kennedy and Carla Hills, now the U.S. trade representative.
Under the direction of former Durenberger aide Paul Hewitt, AGE
issued articles, speeches and reports that raised explosive
questions about rising Social Security benefits and other issues.
   One AGE pamphlet went so far as to suggest the nation was
``raising a generation of young Americans who will live in
financial slavery.'' Hewitt says AGE was calling attention to
legitimate questions.
   But the group's rhetoric soon became an embarrassment to
Durenberger, who was running for re-election in 1988, and to some
other board members.
   Durenberger fired Hewitt that spring, just as his difficult
campaign against Hubert H. ``Skip'' Humphrey III was gearing up.
Hewitt's antagonistic style had aliented the elderly and made an
enemy of the AARP, Durenberger said recently.
   The subsequent change in tone moved Boston Globe columnist Bob
Kuttner to write late last year that the generational equity issue
had ``come, so to speak, of age.''
   ``They certainly appeared to be less strident and shrill and
immature in their approach,'' said Families USA's Pollack.
   But the senator's difficulties with Hewitt and AGE were far from
over.
   The Senate Ethics Committee last year began investigating
Durenberger's financial conduct, including charges he used a book
contract to launder speaking fees, and that drove away the
contributors who underwrote AGE's $400,000-a-year budget, says
Penny.
   And in January, the trade magazine Podiatry Today published
Hewitt's allegations that Durenberger muzzled the group's staff and
tried to divert money to a Minnesota AGE chapter to assist his
re-election campaign.
   ``Nobody wants to support an organization that doesn't have
anything to say. It has had nothing to say in the last year,''
Hewitt said.
   Durenberger, who turned the chairmanship over to fellow
Minnesotan Penny in December, denounced Hewitt as a ``liar,'' and
other board members say the allegations that AGE was used for
political gain were ridiculous and unfounded.
   But the damage was done.
   ``With all the controversy involving the senator, which led to a
diminished fund-raising capacity, you add to that the allegations
made against the senator that were directly tied to his AGE
leadership, and it made fund raising virtually impossible,'' said
Penny.
   The $8,000 in donations received after he shut down the
operation will go toward paying off bills left over from recent
conferences.
   In the meantime, Lamm has asked the board for time to find
someone willing to run the organization with little or no pay so
AGE can at least continue sponsoring conferences on generational
issues.
   ``Somebody's got to be the voice of realism,'' said Lamm.
``That's what AGE was. That's not granny bashing.''

<HEAD>Study Tracks Elderly in Florida</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KRISTI UMBREIT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers are looking into how well the
elderly adjust in the Sun Belt without the support of family and
friends they left behind in the North.
   The Case Western Reserve University study tracks 800 people over
75 who moved from Northern cities to a Clearwater, Fla., retirement
community.
   ``We think the results would help health care professionals to
see what the needs of old people are who have relocated and to
counsel people as they plan relocation,'' said Eva Kahana, who
chairs the sociology department and directs the study.
   ``It would also help counsel families. It would either help
reassure them that the social support networks that people develop
in these communities are adequate or what kind of help is
available. We would be able to develop guidelines for doctors,
social workers and families in having a more realistic picture of
what to expect.''
   Her study is a spinoff of a 1984 Case Western survey, in which
150 people in their 60s or early 70s who had just moved to Florida
were asked how stressful the move was and how they were faring.
Researchers followed them for a year.
   Ms. Kahana said researchers found that the majority were
satisfied with their choice, that they didn't miss very much their
home communities or the people they had left.
   ``The question that remains is whether those findings (continue)
as they get older,'' she said.
   For the new study, field workers are interviewing people over 75
in the Clearwater community, which Ms. Kahana would not identify.
The 800 interviews should be finished by the end of April.
   Residents are asked about lifestyle, mental and physical health,
and long-distance communication with family and friends. They also
are asked to what extent paid helpers or agencies are used to get
groceries, clean houses, do yardwork or help them meet appointments
or activities.
   Researchers will keep in touch with the same people for eight
years.
   ``We should not make the inference ... that relocation to the
Sun Belt is good for people, period,'' Ms. Kahana said. ``It may be
that in the short run it works out very positively, but once they
become frail they would be missing the natural supports of the
family.
   ``But one of our hypotheses is that the neighbors and friends
(in the new community) take on the role of family members.
   ``We don't know the extent to which elderly people can make deep
friendships late in life. We're going to be looking in depth at
that, how friends and neighbors help one another.''
   In 1970, about 53,000 Ohioans aged 60 and over left Ohio. That
jumped to 86,000 in 1980, the last year for which the Census Bureau
has figures, said Charles Longino, associate director of the Center
of Adult Development and Aging at the University of Miami at Coral
Gables, Fla.
   In 1980, 44 percent of the 86,000 moved to Florida. Ten years
earlier, 36 percent went to Florida. California drew 8 percent in
1980 and 11 percent in 1970.
   Of the country's 226 million people in 1980, 35.6 million were
at least 65, and about 5 percent of that age group moved out of
their states, Longino said. Florida drew more of the elderly than
any other state, with about 437,000 people in 1980.

   A geriatric leadership project is
training health- care workers to meet the special needs of older
Indians.
   ``This is a vast new field that's really new to Indian health
care,'' said Bernard Long, who heads the gerontology program at
Sioux San Hospital in Rapid City.
   The Aberdeen Area Indian Health Service, which serves the
Dakotas, Nebraska and Iowa, is the only one with a program aimed
specifically at the needs of the elderly, Long said. The project
includes two seminars this year for nurses, aides and other
health-care workers, both Indian and non-Indian.
   ``What we're trying to do is sensitize service providers, to
expand their knowledge about the special needs of Indian elders,''
said Long. ``For example, the way you touch people. You have to be
aware of the culture.''
   Elders are held in high esteem in the Indian culture, but
geriatric health care for Indians has had a low profile, Thomas
Stenvig, an IHS program manager in Aberdeen, said.
   ``The elderly have not received a whole lot of focus as a
population in health care,'' he said. ``What we're doing with
Indian health care really mirrors what is happening nationally.''
   As the percentage of older Americans grows, increasing emphasis
will be placed on geriatric health care among all groups of people,
Long said, adding that 13 percent of the nation's population is 65
or older. The figure for clients of the IHS, which has 13 offices
covering the United States, is 6 percent and growing, he said.

   When Elizabeth Goucher moved to a
retirement community two years ago, she asked herself questions
many people would rather not.
   Should doctors keep her on life-support systems if she became
terminally ill? Would she donate her organs after death? Which
funeral home should she use?
   Residents and staff of Duncaster, a residential care center for
the elderly, have written a booklet to help people answer some of
the disturbing questions about death and terminal illness.
   ``Choices'' explores issues from arranging a funeral to ``living
wills,'' documents that indicates a person's feelings about
prolonging life through the use of artificial life-support systems,
to setting up a trust and designating power of attorney.
   A committee of seven Duncaster residents and staff members spent
more than a year talking with attorneys and other experts to
produce the booklet, which was published last month.
   Patricia B. Copp, director of resident services at Duncaster,
said she thinks planning for death is not as unthinkable as it once
was.
   ``For a long time, this was a no-no, but now, it's a hot
topic,'' Copp said. ``These people were making plans for the rest
of their lives when they came here and the rest of their lives
includes death. They decided they wanted to have strong input in
the decision of how things would be handled at and after death.''
   Goucher, 67, who helped write ``Choices,'' acknowledges that
some older people may not be comfortable planning for their deaths.
   ``Some people go through life with their heads in the sand
because they have someone else to take care of these things. ...
But I've seen what can happen when people don't make these
provisions,'' said Goucher, a retired social worker in psychiatric
hospitals.

   Is it plausible that plants, like people, do
better in congenial settings and that insect pests avoid
distasteful things? Concede the possibility, and you really should
try companion or repellent planting.
   Does it work?
   ``I've come to believe in it absolutely,'' says Jim Johnson of
Phoenix, president of the Arizona Herb Association. ``I haven't
used chemical pesticides in my garden for five years. And I'm
convinced plants grow best among their friends.''
   Jane Haynes of suburban Fountain Hills, another expert on herbs,
says she reacted with enthusiasm when first hearing of the idea 20
or 25 years ago, ``but I'm still not satisfied it happens that way,
much as I'd like to.''
   One thing is sure: College-trained horticulturists no longer
burst into gales of laughter when people say things like they never
plant peas near onions or they believe marigolds deter certain
pests and basil helps tomatoes grow. Definitive scientific studies
are in their infancy, however.
   In my landscape, I try to avoid chemicals but don't hesitate to
use them if natural forces seem to be losing, or if there's no
known natural control. And my records over the years seem to show
some plants do better or worse near others.
   The Rodale folks in Emmaus, Pa., publishers of Organic Gardening
magazine, began popularizing the companion-repellent theory a
couple decades ago.
   Details are spelled out in The Encyclopedia of Natural Insect
and Disease Control, published in 1984 by Rodale Press and
available in most bookstores ($24.95 hardcover). Even if you
question the concept, this is an excellent reference on how to work
with nature and minimize toxic chemicals.
   Author Roger P. Yepsen Jr. suggests the benefits of companion
planting ``may be due to the increased health of vegetables growing
near their friends; insects typically pass by healthy plants,
preferring to pick on weak or sick plants.''
   ``Why are companionate plantings healthier?'' Yepsen continues.
``Perhaps because the plants make complementary demands on the
environment. For instance, the compatibility of celery and leek can
be traced to the upright-growing leek enjoying the room and light
near the bushy celery plant. Or the roots of two friendly plants
may occupy different strata of the soil, as do those of Swiss chard
and beans.''
   The book lists many repellent plantings, such as rosemary vs.
snails and slugs; spearmint vs. ants, and garlic vs. aphids.
Garlic, it says, ``helps out no matter where you plant it'' and
keeps the potato bugs, bean beetles and stem borers from achieving
pest status. But Yepsen's main thrust is that a delicate balance of
life forms exists in any landscape, and troubles develop when you
upset the balance between pests and beneficial forces.
   To illustrate how the world changes, I recall an incident
involving my college professor in agricultural pest control. He was
an imposing physical specimen, a former pro football end. One day a
little bug invaded his demonstration garden. ``Ohmygod, a bug!'' he
cried. He literally shook as he drenched it with DDT, a pesticide
outlawed a decade or so later.
   Johnson believes insects follow smells, ``a cabbage worm is
attracted by the scent of cabbage and a tomato worm by the scent of
tomatoes, for example.''
   So he plants garlic and other members of the onion family
throughout his garden and flower beds to confuse insects, and uses
various herbs around specific plants.
   ``While I don't grow a lot of tomatoes, maybe a half-dozen
plants, I haven't had a tomato worm in five years. By planting a
lot of garlic cloves, the worst that can happen is I'll have a lot
of nice garlic,'' he says.
   Johnson also grows basil next to the tomatoes, reasoning they
like each other. What about garlic and roses?
   ``I think roses like garlic better than garlic likes roses,'' he
says. ``But no plants seem to like fennel, although bees seem to
love it. Since I want to draw bees for pollination, I grow fennel,
but plant it away from everything else.''
   Haynes says she has tried to keep track of companion plantings
for about 20 years and remains unconvinced.
   ``There's so many possible variants. I don't see any big
differences. Take planting marigolds to deter nematodes. How do you
know for sure you have nematodes, or that marigolds did any good?''
   She's sure, however, that the moon influences gardening. She
propagates her herbs by inserting cuttings in water.
   ``I get roots more quickly, four to five days quicker, before a
full moon than after one, and they seem to be much stronger, too.''
   Moon gardening has been around for generations, of course. Many
believers will not plant or prune or even turn the soil without
checking an almanac. The theory is that the moon's gravitational
pull influences fluids in plants, just as it does the ocean tides.

   If you own a second home in another state, for
vacation or investment purposes, or if you're thinking about buying
one, make certain it's included in your estate planning, experts
say.
   When considering multiple-home ownership in your estate plan,
it's important to understand the term ``domicile.'' Essentially,
domicile is legalese for primary residence. While it is possible to
have more than one residence, a person legally can have only one
domicile at a time.
   If it's not certain at the time an individual dies where his or
her domicile is, the intent of the will could be subverted, the
heirs may not receive the property rights intended by the decedent,
and the tax situation could be greatly complicated.
   In fact, courts have held an individual's estate to be subject
to double taxation under the estate laws of two states because each
state considered the dead person to be domiciled there.
   Consider an individual who has homes in Arizona, a community
property state, and Minnesota, a common-law property state. The
manner in which property is distributed at death is vastly
different under each type of property system. So if the owner dies,
and there is confusion as to where his or her domicile is,
settlement of the estate can be complicated.
   What constitutes a domicile may appear obvious at first. It
isn't.
   Traditionally, domicile has been defined as a place where a
person establishes his or her permanent residence. But many states
have laws that define domicile as a location where a person intends
to establish his or her residence for the time being.
   In today's mobile society, it is not unusual for a person to
have homes in several states, conduct business in a multistate
area, or move from one state to another beause of a change in
health, employment, marital status or retirement. Therefore, the
definition of domicile becomes blurred.
   Although most individuals live most of the year where they are
domiciled, the residence does not necessarily determine domicile.
Other factors that may be considered:
   _ How long has the individual lived at the primary residence?
   _ Where does he or she transact business?
   _ Where does the individual maintain community or professional
affiliations?
   _ What is the individual's motive for living in particular
state? (Evasion of creditors, for example, may negate an
individual's claim to domicility.)
   If you own a vacation home or investment property in a state
outside your home state, I suggest you consult an attorney, then
consider the following if domicile is unclear:
   _ If you own residence in more than one state, transfer or sell
any unnecessary real estate holdings not located in the same state
as your domicile.
   _ Transfer all tangible personal property (including household
furnishings and cars) to the state in which you want to establish
domicile.
   _ Transfer savings, checking accounts, CDs and, if possible,
IRAs and other retirement accounts to the domicile state.
   _ Obtain insurance coverage in the domicile state on personal
property, cars and houses. Do not continue insurance coverage
through an agent in the state of non-residence.
   _ If the state you want regarded as your domicile state has a
legal form declaring domicility, file one.
   _ If you do not have a will, execute one in the state in which
you want to establish your domicile. Or, if you have a will that
does not reflect your current domicile, have a new one executed,
including a clause revoking all prior wills in other states.
   _ Register to vote in the domicile state and vote at the
earliest opportunity, thereby reinforcing your intent to establish
residency.
   I do not discourage owning homes in more than one state, but it
is important to clarify which state is the domicile, because if
there is any question about it, the vacation home that produces so
much pleasure now may later cause tremendous inconvenience to you
and expense to your heirs.

   When a senior citizens home opened across
the street from Carver Middle School, Beth Cordingly saw an
opportunity for her sixth-graders that would span generations.
   So with $360 in ``lunch money'' from the Tulsa Education Fund,
she gave it a try.
   Once a month, pupils walk residents of the Jordan Plaza to the
school cafeteria for a meal.
   ``Senior citizens feel isolated at times, when they can't get
out,'' Ms. Cordingly said. ``They have enjoyed the interaction.
They have expressed many times that it's like a breath of fresh
air.''

   ``Most of the residents attended Carver many years ago,'' Ms.
Cordingly said. ``The students are intrigued with how life was 50
years ago. They see them growing old, and it causes them to think

   Sixth-grader Vicki Nelson said her senior friend, John Furch,
talks to her ``all the time'' about school and growing up.
   ``He likes to talk and I like to talk. He likes to eat and I
like to eat. We like a lot of things together,'' Vicki said. ``He
tells me neat stuff, not really stuff you need for education, but
stuff you just learn.''
   Taylor Nunley, a resident at Jordan Plaza, said he was surprised
how much the children talked. He said most children he has dealt
with in the past were ``very reluctant to talk to old people.''
   ``There's not as big a generation gap as there used to be in the
'60s and '70s,'' Nunley said. ``It seems as though the wall is
dwindling down. We need each other.''

   Now that he's finished law school, William
Shapiro is making a career of volunteer work for the Arizona Senior
Citizens Law Project.
   He knows what he's talking about: Shapiro is 76.
   Shapiro, who was graduated in December from the Arizona State
University College of Law, said he would take the state bar
examination at the end of February. A retired chemist and
businessman, Shapiro is the oldest student to graduate from the
22-year-old law school in suburban Tempe.
   Shapiro, a Phoenix resident, has been working as a volunteer at
the law project, which serves the low-income elderly in Maricopa
County, since 1985.
   ``I was able to help through my business background,'' Shapiro
said. ``But I decided I could do quite a bit more for the people
through the study of law.''
   John Schlosser, who directs the law project's small staff, said
Shapiro's legal skills will help in an office with only two
full-time lawyers.
   Shapiro said he has been involved in landlord-tenant disputes
and foreclosures, but plans now to concentrate on disputes
involving health benefits.
   Shapiro was a government chemist during World War II and owned a
paint-manufacturing business in South Bend, Ind., for 25 years.

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
expressed ``guarded optimism'' that the country can avoid a
recession this year, but his warnings on the dangers of
accelerating inflation helped send financial markets into a
tailspin.
   Greenspan said Tuesday the central bank was looking for the
economy to grow at a rate far below the one on which the
administration based its 1991 budget.
   Stock and bond prices fell, as Wall Street took Greenspan's
inflation warnings and growth forecast as evidence the central bank
will follow a tight money policy to battle inflation, dimming hopes
for lower interest rates.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. creditors say
they may try to switch the bankruptcy case to a Chapter 7
liquidation to exert greater control over asset sales by the
collapsed Wall Street firm.
   Drexel's brokerage subsidiary has sold off nearly $40 billion
worth of securities as well as other assets since the parent
company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last week.
   The brokerage, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., is not included in
the filing and creditors legally have no role in its dismantling.
But creditors said they are concerned about the speed and method of
breaking up what once was one of Wall Street's most powerful firms.
   ``We're the ones at risk here,'' William Schopf, general counsel
of First City Bancorp. of Texas Inc., said Tuesday. ``We're not
about to sit back and let someone else play with what is in effect
our money.''
   First City Houston, the bank's main subsidiary, is the largest
U.S.-owned bank on a list of top unsecured creditors included in
Drexel's bankruptcy court filing last Tuesday. First City is owed
$25 million.
   Meanwhile, a newspaper reported that Drexel paid as much as $350
million in bonuses to its executives in the weeks before it filed
for bankruptcy protection. Some top executives received payments of
more than $10 million, The New York Times said in Wednesday's
editions.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder declined to comment on the size
of individual bonuses. The payments were determined last year and
were part of running the firm's business, the Times quoted Anreder
as saying.
   ``If we didn't have bonuses, we wouldn't have had anybody
working for us,'' he said.
   Representatives of Drexel's creditors plan to examine the
bonuses to determine if they could be recovered during bankruptcy
proceedings, the Times reported.
   U.S. Trustee Harold Jones, who is supervising the bankruptcy
case, has set an organizational meeting for the creditors for Feb.
27 in New York.
   The Chapter 11 filing allows Drexel to manage, with the judge's
approval, its dismantling. Creditors could seek to force Drexel to
liquidate under Chapter 7, where the company's control over its
dissolution would be sharply reduced.
   ``People are going to be considering the pluses and minuses of
Chapter 11 vs. Chapter 7,'' said Margaret Shearer, deputy general
counsel of AmBase Corp., whose Home Capital Services Inc.
subsidiary is the second largest unsecured creditor at $42.7
million. ``That's a major issue.''
   Schopf said creditors want to make sure Drexel is receiving fair
value for any asset sales and transfers and to determine whether
Drexel insiders have benefitted from them.
   Drexel attorney Alan Miller said the subsidiaries want to get as
much as possible from asset sales because unsecured creditors will
have priority in the bankruptcy over employees' 54 percent stake in
the parent company.
   ``The people who are here at Drexel who are winding down the
business of the subsidiaries have a vital economic interest in the
success of the wind-down,'' Miller said.
   Drexel said Tuesday it had liquidated 82 percent of its
securities inventory, selling all but $8.6 billion out of $47.4
billion in holdings. The sales include government, high-grade
corporate, mortgage-backed, municipal and junk bonds, as well as
equity and convertible securities.
   ``Our objective was to maximize the asset values for creditors
and shareholders, and it could only be done through an effective
liquidation accomplished at market prices,'' Drexel said in a
statement.
   In its filing, Drexel listed more than 2,000 total creditors,
assets of $3.7 billion and liabilities of $2.89 billion.
   Drexel last week fired most of its 5,300 employees. Spokesman
Steven Anreder said Tuesday about 1,700 workers remained to finish
winding down the firm's operations. Employees also are being
allowed to use Drexel's offices temporarily to search for new jobs.
   Creditors may have a difficult time quickly gaining details
about the assets of Drexel's parent. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Howard
Buschman III last week gave the company a 90-day extension to file
a comprehensive account of assets and liabilities.
   First City filed motions Tuesday requesting the judge to
reconsider the 90-day extension and to compel an examination of
Drexel's assets, Schopf said. Buschman scheduled a March 1 hearing
to consider the motions, Schopf added.
   ``It seems to me we should get whatever information is available
now rather than having it tied up with a ribbon in 90 days,'' he
said.
   Other creditors said they would seek to interview Drexel
executives soon to investigate, among other things, what caused the
bankruptcy filing.
   ``We'll be looking at not only Drexel's current situation but
probably the circumstances leading up to the'' bankruptcy filing,
said DeWitt Bowman, chief investment officer for California's
Public Employees Retirement System, which is owed $25 million.

   The powerful investment bank First Boston Corp.
says it may abandon some businesses as part of a restructuring that
provides yet more evidence of the hard times on Wall Street.
   First Boston said last Friday it was phasing out its
fixed-income futures brokerage business in Chicago and laying off
29 employees.
   In response to reports that further layoffs were expected, the
privately held firm said Tuesday it was conducting a ``rolling
review'' of its businesses and was considering eliminating other
minor operations. First Boston denied that any major cutbacks were
imminent, though.
   ``We will in the future increase our emphasis in certain
business areas, and decrease our emphasis in others,'' First Boston
president and chief executive John M. Hennessey said in a
statement. ``As we did Friday, we may decide to exit certain narrow
and discrete business lines.''
   The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that some executives at
First Boston, which has about 5,000 employees, expect the
restructuring to cause hundreds of layoffs. Rumors that the firm is
on shaky financial ground also have been circulating on Wall Street.
   Spokesman Fred Garcia said First Boston's financial backing was
strong with nearly $2 billion in capital. He said Standard &amp; Poor's
Corp. and Moody's Investors Service had reaffirmed the investment
bank's credit ratings in recent weeks.
   Nevertheless, Garcia said the firm was considering selling a
bridge loan it had made to Ohio Mattress Co. to help finance a
buyout of the company last year. The company scrapped plans to
issue $475 million of junk bonds to raise long-term funds last fall
because of weakness in the junk bond market.
   Garcia maintained that First Boston's review included some
hirings, such as the recent addition of four top bond traders who
had left Salomon Brothers Inc. to form their own firm.
   ``The strategy is to be very strong in markets where we can add
value for our customers,'' he said. ``We don't want to be in
low-margin, commoditized businesses.''
   The strategy implies the firm will emphasize stronger
relationships with fewer clients, Garcia added.
   First Boston went private last year when it merged with its
London-based sister company, Financiere Credit Suisse-First Boston,
in a $1.1 billion deal. The combined entity, CS First Boston Inc.,
is 45 percent owned by Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank holding
company.
   The investment bank's strengths are in mergers and acquisitions,
stock and bond trading and underwriting, and merchant banking.
   According to Securities Data Co., First Boston was second on
Wall Street in merger advising last year, the same as in 1988,
posting gains in both the number of deals and their value. Its
stock underwriting increased by 26 percent and the firm, moving the
firm up a notch to third place on Wall Street.
   ``Our market share in high-margin businesses such as equity new
issues and M&amp;A continues to be strong,'' Hennessy said in the
statement.
   ``Furthermore, our European and Pacific enterprises also started
the year strong, both in terms of market share and profitability,
following a very good 1989,'' the statement read.
   Still, analysts said First Boston, like other Wall Street
houses, is likely to be hurt by a slowdown in underwriting and
mergers, as well as a lingering decline in stock and bond trading
following the 1987 stock market crash.
   Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical Services said more layoffs
would not be surprising given the general weak market conditions.
First Boston laid off 200 workers last spring.
   Because of Credit Suisse's strength and its in involvement in
the subsidiaries' activities, analysts do not expect First Boston
to face the kinds of problems that led the parent of Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. to seek bankruptcy court protection last week.
   The filing occurred after Drexel's parent, strapped for cash in
part by the drop in value of its holdings of junk bonsd, defaulted
on short-term loans.
   ``From what I can gather, it's a fairly integral part in the
strategy of (Credit Suisse) to be in these businesses,'' said
Lawrence Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``I would
think if they had trouble it would be more ... where the banks have
to shore them up if necessary.''
   Garcia said he did not know the size of the Ohio Mattress bridge
loan First Boston was considering selling, although analysts say it
totals at least $450 million. He also said First Boston had set
aside provisions last year to cover potential losses on the firm's
bridge loan to the U.S. retailing arms of Campeau Corp. and its
holdings of bonds issued by those companies.
   First Boston said last month its exposure to Federated
Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., which have filed
for bankruptcy reorganization, was $293 million.

   Georgia-Pacific Corp. says it is bolstering its
ability to compete in the global market for paper and wood products
with its $5 billion takeover over Great Northern Nekoosa Corp.
   ``Companies are becoming larger through mergers and
acquisitions. They're as a result becoming more efficient,
lower-cost producers and this is occurring all over the world,''
Georgia-Pacific Chairman T. Marshall Hahn Jr. said in a telephone
interview.
   Hahn spoke Tuesday after his company settled a four-month-long
battle and agreed to acquire Great Northern for $65.75 a share.
   The acquisition will create the nation's largest forest products
company, one that will be well positioned to deal with increasing
competition from companies in New Zealand, Japan, Canada and
Scandinavia, analysts and company officials said.
   ``Size alone is not enough to help you guarantee your success,
but it helps,'' said Clarence Brown, a forest products consultant
for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``It's a very capital-intensive, commodity-oriented and cyclical
business with an increasingly international flavor and getting more
so. And the fellows that aren't willing to compete on a global
basis probably won't be around in another 10 years, or won't be
growing too fast.''
   Great Northern had fought hard to remain independent since
Georgia-Pacific launched its first bid of $58 a share on Oct. 31.
But its resistance began to waver after the bid was upped to $63,
then gave way during negotiations in recent days that produced
agreement on the takeover price.
   ``The time has come for Great Northern Nekoosa to join
Georgia-Pacific,'' Nekoosa chairman William R. Laidig said in a
statement. ``I encourage our employees to work as enthusiastically
with their new associates as they have in the past to make the
combined concern the best in the industry.''
   Besides paying $65.75 for 57 million common shares outstanding,
Georgia-Pacific will take over $1.3 billion in debt.
Georgia-Pacific has lined up bank loans to finance the deal.
   The agreement cancels all litigation between the companies and a
March meeting at which shareholders were to consider replacing
Great Northern's board with a slate nominated by Georgia-Pacific.
   Great Northern's stock rose $1.50 a share to $65.37{ on the New
York Stock Exchange Tuesday. Georgia-Pacific fell $1.37{ to $43.75
a share.
   Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific had $10 billion in sales last year
from its wood products and building materials operations.
   Great Northern, based in Norwalk, Conn., makes paperboard
packaging and uncoated printing paper and has $4 billion in sales.
Both companies make newsprint and groundwood paper and have
significant timber holdings.
   The combined company's annual sales will be about 30 percent
greater than its closest U.S. competitors, Weyerhaeuser Inc. and
International Paper Co.
   During antitrust hearings in federal court in Bridgeport, Conn.,
Hahn said the new firm would be able to better adjust its machinery
to the types of paper and cardboard being made and would reduce
shipping costs by having mills and factories closer to customers.
   ``The combined company will be an even stronger company, better
able to compete in what we're confident will be increasingly
competitive global markets,'' Hahn said.
   Brown of Shearson said the combination would strengthen the
companies in a market that increasingly is measured in global
terms. Companies like New Zealand's Fletcher Challenge and Japan's
Jujo Paper Co. have boosted their presence in North America through
acquisitions and joint ventures, he said, while Virginia-based
James River Corp. has increased its presence in Europe.
   ``I think those parties happen to be outstandingly capable and
successful paper makers who will probably represent a typical two
plus two equals five situation,'' Brown said of Great Northern and
Georgia-Pacific.
   Great Northern's hopes of independence took a dramatic turn for
the worse after two recent setbacks.
   Georgia-Pacific sold off some check paper operations, removing
the most serious antitrust question raised in courts in Bridgeport,
Conn.
   Also, a federal judge in Maine struck down some of the company's
takeover defenses, ruling that only two-thirds approval was needed
for Great Northern shareholders to oust the company's board, rather
than three-quarters.
   Hahn said his company increased its offer to end the protracted
court fights.
   ``The sooner we can get on with combining the operations and
gaining the efficiencies, the sooner we get the benefits,'' Hahn
said. He reiterated that the company has no plans to sell off mills
in Maine, as Great Northern alleged.
   Georgia-Pacific has agreed to honor contracts with Great
Northern's 20,000 union and salaried employees, although some jobs
will be cut to eliminate duplication, Hill said. Georgia-Pacific
has 40,000 workers.

   The makers of Guess jeans staked their claim
to millions in denim profits by alleging that the owners of
Jordache bought half of Guess to pick its pockets of designs and
boost their own slumping sales.
   A Superior Court jury will determine whether to award $500
million in damages to the Marciano family, which founded Guess?
Inc. in 1981 and now seeks the return of half the firm bought by
Nakashe family, which owns Jordache.
   Marshall Grossman, representing the Marcianos, said in opening
statements Tuesday that the Nakashe family breached their trust as
part owners after purchasing half of Guess in 1983.
   ``You will see it was the Nakashes' plan and intention to take
information for Jordache and that is exactly what the evidence will
show they did,'' Grossman told the jury.
   Grossman said the Nakashes were supposed to have used trendy
Guess patterns for jeans made by a new Guess division, called GM
Gasoline Inc., but instead stole the patterns to make jeans for
Jordache Enterprises Ltd.
   The Nakashes were under the gun to develop new designs and were
told by the sales department that the situation was critical,
Grossman said.
   An attorney for the Nakashes denied the charges and said experts
who compared the jeans sold under the labels of Jordache, Guess and
Gasoline would say the designs were not copied.
   ``The evidence will not show the Nakashes intentionally took
designs and copied them, put their label on them and made money,''
lawyer Howard Weitzman said.
   This marks the second trial on the dispute between the
French-born Marciano brothers _ Maurice, Armand, Paul and Georges _
and the Israeli-born Nakashes, Joe, Ralph and Avi.
   A jury last year found the Nakashes intended to steal Guess
designs for the Jordache label.
   The second trial is to determine whether to award damages to the
Marcianos and how much.
   The Marcianos are seeking more than $500 million in damages plus
a return of the Nakashes' half ownership of Guess. The latter part
of the decision is up to Superior Court Judge Norman Epstein, who
is presiding over the trial.
   Also at issue is the division of a frozen account containing the
Nakashes' accrued share of Guess profits, totalling more than $93
million.
   The Marcianos also named as defendants a Hong Kong couple, Lee
Sec Mon and his wife, who manufactured Jordache products in the
British Crown Colony. They allege the Lees were to have
manufactured Gasoline designs but diverted materials to Jordache.
   The Lees are unlikely to appear at trial because of an
outstanding warrant for their arrest on customs violations
involving garments imports, according to a source close to the case
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Founded on an investment of $170,000, Guess last year sold $500
million worth of blue jeans, men's and women's casual wear,
swimsuits, shoes, watches, eyeglasses and children's clothing with
the distinctive inverted triangle logo. Over the last four years,
Guess profits have averaged $45 million a year.

   The tobacco business is taking a public
relations pasting from anti-smoking activists for doing what
effective marketers do _ identifying potential customers and giving
them what they think they want.
   ``All companies are looking for market niches,'' said John C.
Maxwell Jr., an analyst who follows the tobacco industry for First
Wheat Securities in Richmond, Va. `` ... But some people just don't
want people to smoke.''
   Maxwell was referring Tuesday to the outcry stirred by news
reports that the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. had been considering
marketing a new cigarette called Dakota to young women with no more
than a high school education.
   The plans were outlined in marketing documents being distributed
by The Advocacy Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based smoking
opponent which said they were intended for Reynolds. Officials
declined to say how they were obtained.
   Reynolds, based in Winston-Salem, N.C., confirmed that it
planned to test Dakota cigarettes in Houston starting in April, but
said they were designed for men and women in an effort to compete
against Marlboro, the top-selling cigarette from Reynolds' rival
Philip Morris USA.
   The Dakota disclosure comes only a month after Reynolds
cancelled plans to test a menthol cigarette called Uptown that was
to have been marketed mainly to blacks. Dr. Louis W. Sullivan,
secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and
civil rights groups strongly objected to those plans.
   Critics said tobacco companies are wrong to target the poor, the
young and minorities with products that are believed to cause
serious health problems.
   Edward Popper, a marketing professor at Bryant College in
Smithfield, R.I., said ``these are the groups that are showing the
lowest declines in per capita smoking rates.''
   According to the U.S. Office on Smoking and Health, the
percentage of the population over age 20 that smokes fell to 29.1
percent in 1987 from 40.7 percent in 1966. Among whites, the
percentage of smokers fell 30 percent to 28.3 percent; among
blacks, the decline was 22 percent to 33.5 percent.
   The percentage of men who smoke has fallen much more sharply
than women who smoke over the time frame. And among women aged
20-24, the government said the percentage of smokers with some
college education dropped 57 percent, while the percentage with no
more than high school education dropped about 11 percent.
   While there have been a number of recent actions to make smoking
off-limits in some public places such as restaurants and airplanes,
Maxwell said people who criticize the targeting of groups more
likely to smoke effectively are ``trying to ban a legal product.''
   The cigarette companies argue that their advertising is aimed at
persuading people who smoke to switch to their brands.
   But Dr. Ronald Davis, director of the Office on Smoking and
Health, said the tobacco industry is ``pushing a deadly addictive
product on the most vulnerable groups in our society.''
   The outcry against marketing cigarettes to some groups for comes
as tobacco companies post increasing profits despite declining
sales volume.
   Maxwell said cigarette production fell 6 percent to 525 billion
units in 1989. He said that number was depressed by a deliberate
effort by Reynolds to cut inventories, and estimates that
consumption fell by about 2.5 percent to 3 percent last year.
   Profits are up, however, because cigarette companies have cut
costs and introduced more efficient equipment, he said.
   Leonard Lodish, a marketing professor at Wharton School at the
University of Pennsylvania, said that by targeting groups that
smoke more often than others the cigarette companies are no
different than other marketers.
   ``They are finding out what particular market segments want and
are delivering products to them,'' he said, adding that ``I'm not
sure this is the place to draw the line'' on whether to outlaw
tobacco.
   But Philip Wilbur, director of the health advocacy resource
center at The Advocacy Institute, disagreed. ``Standard marketing
doesn't involve selling a product that is lethal when used as
intended,'' he said.
   And he said in the wake of the withdrawal of the Uptown
cigarette, society may have ``reached a point where they have said
`Enough.'''

<HEAD>Congressional Study: Exchanges, Banks Need Tigther Computer
Security</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two electronic funds transfer systems that
handle more than $1 trillion daily in inter-bank transactions need
better security measures to guard against fraud or computer mishap,
a congressional study has concluded.
   The study by the General Accounting Office called for beefed-up
security measures for the electronic funds transfer systems used by
the Federal Reserve System and most of the nation's banks: FEDWIRE
and the Clearing House Interbank Payments System, or CHIPS.
   A related GAO study noted that internal security weaknesses of
stock exchange computer systems raise risks of sabotage that
``could literally bring securities trading to a halt,'' even though
the systems are well protected against attack by outsiders.
   The GAO found a number of internal control weaknesses at the
computer centers of the nation's two major stock exchanges and the
National Association of Securities Dealers, which oversees the
over-the-counter market.
   Both studies were requested by Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass.,
chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's subcommittee
on finance, which was to conduct a hearing today on computer
security in the financial markets.
   The banking study found that ``there have not been any reported
incidents of fraudulent electronic funds transfers over the systems
by the employees who operate or oversee them. However, the results
of our review of the security measures in place to protect these
systems from misuse have not been satisfying.''
   The report said it found 17 FEDWIRE control weaknesses at the
four Federal Reserve banks investigators visited in New York,
Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco. Weaknesses ranged from
inadequate surveillance by cameras or motion sensors in critical
processing areas to inadequate control of software that allows
access to FEDWIRE.
   FEDWIRE is the primary wholesale electronic funds transfer
system used by the banking community to handle the payments banks
make to each other within the United States. In 1988, FEDWIRE
served over 11,000 depository institutions and government agencies
and processed transactions valued at $253 trillion.
   The computer security report said officials at the New York
Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the NASD and the
Securities Industry Automation Corporation, (SIAC), a jointly-owned
subsidiary of both exchanges that operates computerized systems,
``have implemented a wide range of security controls that protect
their systems from the external threat of a hacker or virus attack,
and as a result, the risk of such a threat is relatively low.''
   A hacker is a computer tinkerer who tries to gain access to
computer systems without authorization. A virus is a renegade
program that, once placed into a computer system, can reproduce and
spread among computer systems, disrupting or destroying computer
services.
   But the most significant threat of potential tampering comes
from the employees who have access to the exchange and NASD
computer systems, said the report.
   The report recommended the SEC periodically conduct or oversee
independent assessments of the exchanges' and NASD's computer
security programs, develop written information security plans and
policies and conduct periodic risk analyses.
   In November, the SEC issued a policy statement asking exchanges
and the NASD to review their computer systems periodically and
conduct studies to assess their capacity and vulnerability.
   The study found 10 security weaknesses at NASD, including
computer center staff performing tasks beyond their normal
responsibility.
   At the SIAC, the study found three security weaknesses,
including contingency planning in the event of a computer virus
attack.
   The American Stock Exchange had no immediate comment Tuesday
evening. A spokeswoman for the New York Stock Exchange, Sharon
Gamsin, said the Big Board had not seen the GAO report and would
not comment until it had reviewed it.
   Charles Justice, vice president for automation at the NASD, said
some of the GAO criticisms already had been addressed
   ``We agreed essentially that steps could be taken and we did
take them,'' he said. ``They were taking a federal standard and
were trying to apply it to a non-federal operation. We were kind of
in technical violation but we simply don't follow that standard. In
terms of a substantive violation I don't think there was anything
that was serious.''
   A Fed spokesman said the agency's comments would come in hearing
testimony by Fed Governor Wayne D. Angell.

<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp. said it ran into
technical problems with its new mainframe computer but said they
were minor and would not delay shipments.
   But The Boston Globe today said two Wall Street analysts said
they received reports of troubles that could delay some initial
deliveries.
   Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported today that Digial
faces the possibility of the first quarterly loss in its 32-year
history and is considering a voluntary severance program to cut its
work force by 8,000.
   The new computers are called VAX 9000s, and Digital planned to
begin deliveries with the entry-level Model 210 during its fourth
quarter, which begins April 1.
   Digital said Tuesday it found errors in an add-on product which
allows the Model 210 to do vector processing.
   Dallas Kirk, a company spokesman, said Model 210s with the
add-on feature were not scheduled for delivery until the 1991
fiscal year, which begins in July.
   Analysts said they were concerned about larger problems, that
the VAX 9000s were still being assembled in ones and twos, and that
concern would remain until product reliability was demonstrated.
   The new computers will have an average selling price of $1.4
million.
   Sales of the company's minicomputers have slumped, and earnings
dropped 39 percent during the six months ended Dec. 31.
   Meanwhile, the Journal said Digital's President and founder
Kenneth H. Olsen won't rule out a loss in the company's third
quarter ending March 31.
   Slumping sales and rising expenses as Digital makes long-term
investments in new products could cause the loss, the newspaper
said.
   Digital, based in Maynard, Mass., is the world's second-largest
computer maker after International Business Machines Corp.

<HEAD>Huntsman Gives Up Attempt to Acquire Aristech</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A consortium formed by a Japanese company and
top management of Aristech Chemical Corp. has outbid a Utah
industrialist who dropped his yearlong quest to buy the company.
   Jon M. Huntsman said in a statement Tuesday that after two weeks
of studying Aristech, he decided not to top the $27 per share offer
made by Mitsubishi Corp. and the managers. The $992 million bid has
been endorsed by a special committee of directors.
   Huntsman had said he would offer more than $27 per share unless
he found some materially negative information during his review.
   He said in a statement he may make another offer if the
Mitsubishi bid falls through. No other parties have expressed
interest in making a bid for Aristech.
   Huntsman started his quest for Aristech by buying nearly 9
percent of its stock last year.
   He intially proprosed a friendly buyout of the company or just
its polypropylene division. Both offers were rebuffed by Chairman
Thomas Marshall, who said neither the company nor the polypropylene
business were for sale. Huntsman then made a formal $25-per-share
bid in October, only to see it rejected as inadequate.
   Shortly thereafter, Aristech's managers began working with
Mitsubishi on an alternative bid. They submitted an initial offer
of $26 per share in January, then bumped it up to $27 after a
committee of non-management Aristech directors set up an auction to
determine the winning bidder.
   Under the offer, Aristech's managers would receive $6.5 million
in cash and 29.9 percent of the company's stock.
   Huntsman did not participate in the auction. He complained the
company had unfairly denied him access to non-public information
about the company and criticized management for inviting a Japanese
bidder while rejecting an American suitor.
   However, the Aristech board allowed Huntsman to begin an
in-depth review shortly after the auction and promised to leave the
company open to a new bid.
   Huntsman's company owns half of Donora-based Polycom Huntsman
Inc.

<HEAD>Daimler-Benz Chief: Move Slowly in E. Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. automakers should move quickly but
cautiously into Eastern Europe as the region liberalizes
economically, the head of West Germany's Daimler-Benz says.
   Edzard Reuter, chairman of the board of management for
Daimler-Benz AG, the maker of Mercedes-Benz automobiles, said
Tuesday he saw little chance of growth in the company's automobile
sales in Eastern Europe, but truck sales could benefit.
   He said any move by Daimler-Benz into Eastern Europe carries
economic and political overtones.
   Automakers currently are faced with risks in Eastern European
investment because most of the currencies there are not convertible
into West German marks, French francs or U.S. dollars.
   Reuter said Western businesses must ``do everything they can to
engage themselves in Eastern Europe as quickly as possible.''
   General Motors Corp. last month announced it would begin
building cars in a joint venture with the Hungarian truckmaker RABA
in 1992. GM executives have said that Czechoslovakia is the next
most-likely place for Eastern European investment by the world's
largest automaker.
   Politically, there is a risk for any West German company as
debate over reunification of the split nation heats up, Reuter said.
   ``We must be careful in trying to avoid these risks of a revival
of nationalism in Germany,'' Reuter said at a news conference
before addressing the Economic Club of Detroit. ``We must try to
supersede military security by some kind of economic partnership.''
   He said his company has begun talks with East German companies
about joint ventures in vehicle manufacture, railroad systems,
microelectronics and household goods.
   Many of those things, with the exception of railroads, are being
discussed with Japanese companies, he said.
   Daimler-Benz has a marketing agreement with Mitsubishi Motors
Corp. of Japan which Reuter hopes will boost sales of Mercedes-Benz
automobiles in Japan.
   Reuter said his company has doubled sales to 60,000 cars a year
in Japan, and would like more dealerships. Last year, Mercedes sold
74,851 cars in the United States.
   Reuter said even though he would like to see an expanded role
for Daimler-Benz in Japan, the company should move slowly because
of Japanese economic protectionist policies.
   Nevertheless, he said, ``We have no problem cooperating with
them. We should probably try to include the Japanese in the global
competition. We will not hesitate to do so.''
   The U.S. market is one place where Mercedes-Benz automobiles
compete with Japanese luxury cars _ Toyota's Lexus and Nissan's
Infiniti. But Reuter discounted the competition, mainly because of
price differences.
   ``Even if this sounds a little arrogant, we never were
frightened by Lexus or Infiniti,'' he said. ``What we offer, even
with a higher price, is a far better deal than anybody can offer.
   ``We are not going to reduce our prices on our models to face
our competition.''
   Base versions of Mercedes automobiles range in price between
$32,500 and $83,500. The most expensive versions of Lexus and
Infiniti cars sell for about $40,000.
   For the 1990 model year, BMW and Volkswagen, both West German,
cut prices and eliminated rebates on many of the cars they sell in
the United States.
   Several times during the news conference, Reuter said flatly
there would be no price reduction for Mercedes-Benz cars.

<HEAD>High Court Approves Administrators For Sock Shop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A High Court judge on Wednesday approved the
appointment of administrators to run troubled retailer Sock Shop
International PLC.
   Granting the administration order under Britain's Insolvency
Act, the judge, Sir Jean-Pierre Warner, said: ``I hope it comes
off.''
   Filing for administrators is a way of holding off creditors
while a company sorts out its financial problems.
   Company founders and co-managing directors Sophie Mirman and
Richard Ross had asked for the appointment of administrators with
the support of the company's bank Barclays Bank, ``to ensure the
survival of the company as a going concern.''
   Miss Mirman and her husband Ross now will lose control of the
company to the accountants Peter Du Buisson and Phillip Sykes.
   Sock Shop, which has the equivalent of about $27 million in
debts, said in a statement, ``The company continues to trade, and
talks on refinancing are being pursued.''
   On Tuesday, the company asked for a temporary suspension of
trading in its shares on London's Stock Exchange pending a further
announcement. The stock was trading at 58 cents a share when
trading was stopped, unchanged from Monday's close.
   Miss Mirman said: ``We believe the best way of ensuring our
financing discussions are productive is the appointment of
administrators.
   ``I am confident the Sock Shop concept will survive. We have an
exciting new series of products for the 1990s and enjoy strong
consumer support.''
   Sock Shop has been seeking financial rescue for weeks. The group
is expected to announce a new cash-raising exercise or a new
partner.
   Sock Shop announced earlier this month a $4.9 million loss for
the first six months of its fiscal year, blaming London's 14-week
transportation strikes last summer.
   Thirty of the retailer's socks and hosiery stores are in or near
London's subway stations, and the company was forced to close them
during the walkouts.
   The company closed its 17 U.S. stores, most of them in New York,
in December after high security costs put a dent into operating
profit.
   Sock Shop operates 109 outlets in Britain and 16 elsewhere in
Europe.

   General Motors Corp. will transfer more than
57,138 acres of Louisiana farmland, wetland and hardwood timberland
to two conservation groups.
   GM has owned the land through its Fisher Lumber Corp. subsidiary
since 1926, when wood was used extensively in automobile assembly.
The land involved in the deal is all the property Fisher Lumber
controls.
   Spokesman John Mueller said today that most of the land would be
swapped for smaller tracts elsewhere for automotive-related uses,
including dealerships. Mueller declined to give the number, size or
who currently owns the smaller parcels.
   About 46,000 acres will be handed over to Muirfield-Pitts, which
will maintain the property as a wildlife habitat and recreation
area.
   The rest will be transferred to The Nature Conservancy, an
international organization that has protected millions of acres of
wildlife habitat in the United States.
   No money is involved in the agreement, Mueller said, which is
expected to be completed in a year. Fisher Lumber will be dissolved
at that time.

<HEAD>Advanced Mirco Devices Sells Texas Plant To Sony</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SUNNYVALE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advanced Mirco Devices says it is
selling a semiconductor plant in San Antonio, Texas to Sony Corp.
for $55 million and a close look at how the Japanese company
manages chip factories.
   Experts said the deal announced Tuesday is one of the first in
which Japanese technological expertise will flow into the United
States rather than vice versa. The deal also would give Sony its
first U.S. chip-making outpost.
   Under the agreement, Sony will take over two Advanced Micro
Devices factories in San Antonio and hire about 650 AMD workers.
The Tokyo-based company plans to refurbish one now-idle production
line and use it to make advanced memory chips known as static
random access memory chips, or SRAMs.
   Meanwhile, AMD will continue receiving the chip output of the
other plant, and its engineers will study how Sony runs the
refurbished factory.
   ``You cannot succeed in this business if you are not in control
of your production processes,'' said Jerry Sanders, AMD's chief
executive.
   AMD, with $1.1 billion in sales, is the nation's fifth-largest
semiconductor maker about equal in size to Sony's chip business.
For the past five years, the two companies have collaborated on the
development of new SRAM products.
   The new agreement is not aimed so much at learning manufacturing
technology but at learning how Japanese companies use it, Sanders
said. Those companies are able to get more chips with fewer defects
from plants similar to those used in the United States.
   AMD has sent engineers to Japan to study Sony's techniques, but
the company said it expects to learn more by applying those methods
alongside Sony's engineers.
   Sony will benefit from the deal by acquiring the work force and
management at the San Antonio plans while AMD will receive both
cash and manufacturing expertise, said David Angel, vice president
of semiconductor research at Dataquest Inc. in San Jose.
   Others said that while the agreement means the sale of another
American asset to the Japanese, AMD saved U.S. jobs and probably
will improve its profitability.
   Sanders also expected the two companies to complete an
additional agreement to develop a new complementary metal-oxide
semiconductor process that he said could double the number of
circuits that can be put on a piece of silicon.

   Economy Minister Antonio Gonzalez
will travel to Washington within the next two weeks to lobby the
Bush administration and creditor banks for fresh loans to support
recently announced economic reforms, government officials said
Wednesday.
   Gonzalez plans to hold talks with senior officials at the U.S.
Treasury, International Monetary Fund and World Bank, the officials
said.
   The economic reforms unveiled by Gonzalez last Sunday aim to
reduce inflation of 8,314 percent during the past 12 months, and
its prime cause, a fiscal deficit equivalent to about 14 percent of
Argentina's approximately $75 billion gross domestic product.
   President Carlos Menem's government hopes the measures _ which
include new taxes, the sale of state companies to private investors
and a committment to deregulate the banking system _ will convince
the IMF to resume loan disbursement.
   The IMF last month suspended a second $230 million payment from
a $1.4 billion, citing Argentina's failure to comply with economic
targets including inflation, tax collections and the fiscal deficit.
   The IMF decision prompted the U.S. Treasury, World Bank and
private commercial banks to either postpone disbursement of
existing credits, or defer consideration of new ones.

   Stock prices declined broadly in early trading
today in response to a steep drop on the Tokyo Stock Exchange that
was echoed in London. The U.S. markets also were pressured by
government figures showing a jump in inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 21.85 points to
2,575.00 in the first half hour of trading.
   The decline was led by blue chip stocks, including American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, which lost { to 38{, and General Electric,
down | to 60\.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 8 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 129 up,
1,017 down and 316 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 28.88 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   In Tokyo, the key Nikkei Index plunged 1,200 points, or 3.15
percent, to 35,734.33. The index was pushed down primarily by
computerized selling of stocks in the last half hour of trading by
foreign brokerage firms.
   This morning, the Labor Department said the Consumer Price Index
for January rose 1.1 percent, the biggest rise in 7{ years.
However, the department said, seasonal factors such as an increase
in food and energy costs accounted for about 60 percent of the jump.
   Analysts interpreted the figures to mean the Federal Reserve
would not consider pressing interest rates lower anytime soon.
Higher interest rates tend to discourage investments in stock.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
1.59 to 179.78. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 2.62 at 352.26.
   On Tuesday, The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials lost 38.74
points to close at 2,596.85 as traders worried about increases in
interest rates worldwide.
   Declining issues outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
327 up, 1,257 down and 388 unchanged.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices fell broadly in early trading on Wall
Street today following sharp declines earlier on the Tokyo and
London stock markets and another negative report from Washington on
inflation.
   Rising interest rates, which have spooked financial markets
since the beginning of the year, were again the primary unsettling
influence today.
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 16.90 to 2,579.95 as
of 10:30 a.m. EST today after falling nearly 30 points earlier.
   The broader market also slumped. Declining issues had a margin
of nearly 8 to 1 over advancers on the New York Stock Exchange,
with 129 stocks rising, 1,017 falling and 316 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 28.88 million shares after the
first half-hour.
   Trading was active, but orderly. ``It's busier than it's been,
but nothing like in the mid-80s,'' said Thomas Jacobson, a
specialist with A.C. Partners on the floor of the NYSE.
   Prices fell after the Labor Department said the Consumer Price
Index for January rose 1.1 percent, the biggest rise in 7{ years.
The department said seasonal factors such as an increase in food
and energy costs accounted for about 60 percent of the jump.
   The CPI figure was the latest in what has become a series of
negative reports on inflation. It led analysts to again conclude
that the Federal Reserve _ which has kept interest rates higher in
an attempt to keep inflation in check _ would not move rates lower
anytime soon.
   Wall Street got some support from bond prices, which despite the
inflation report were holding steady. The Treasury's bellwether
30-year bond was up 1-16 point, and its interest rate was unchanged
at 8.66 percent.
   Some analysts said government bonds were being seen as a
relatively safe haven for investors right now.
   Interest rates also unnerved the stock market in Tokyo, where
the Nikkei Stock Average, the Japanese market's major index, fell
more than 3 percent, its third biggest single-day dive ever and
worst since the worldwide stock market crash in October 1987.
   The average, which reflects the performance of 225 selected
issues, fell 1,161.19 points, or 3.15 percent, closing at 35,734.33
after having fallen nearly 565 points over the previous two trading
days.
   Analysts attributed the market's weakness to increasing
speculation that the Bank of Japan would raise its official
discount rate, the interest it charges for loans to commercial
banks.
   Market watchers also blamed heavy computer programmed selling
for the decline but said there was no panic-selling.
   In London, prices fell sharply in response to the drop in Tokyo
but volume was so light one trader described it as ``feeble.''
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index, the London
market's main barometer, was 24.9 points, or 1.1 percent, lower at
2,252.1 in mid-afternoon trading.
   Traders there also cited interest rates as the cause for the
decline.

<HEAD>First Direct Broadcast Satellite Service Launched</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four media companies today announced they are
banding together to launch the first direct-to-home TV satellite
service that will beam High Definition Television and digital sound
on low-cost ``napkin-sized'' dishes.
   Cablevision Systems Corp., National Broadcasting Co., News Corp.
Ltd. and Hughes Communications Inc. signed a memorandum of
understanding to create the first high power Direct Broadcast
Satellite service in 1993.
   The companies plan to invest about $1 billion in the joint
venture, including up to one-third in equity and $325 million in
non-recourse debt.
   The service, called ``Sky Cable,'' will use the most powerful
space transmitter ever launched for commercial communications, the
companies said in a written statement.
   The high-power satellite system will make as many as 108 new
channels available through the use of digital video delivery; beam
High Definition Television and standard video signals and deliver
digital quality audio.
   Reception will be made by a flat, napkin-sized dish that can be
mounted on a windowsill or rooftop and purchased for about $300 at
consumer electronics stores, the companies said.
   A conventional 10-foot backyard satellite dish costs
approximately $2,000 to $3,000.
   ``The new service will give Americans a taste of the next
century's boundless range of video choices, sharply enhanced
picture reception and more realistic sound,'' said Stephen J.
Petrucci, president and chief operating officer of General Motors
Corp.'s Hughes Communications unit, which will provide the
satellite system.
   The companies said the new satellite venture likely would be the
first to introduce HDTV to the United States on a broad consumer
scale.
   Under the agreement, the equity will be divided evenly among the
partners and will be paid into the venture in equal amounts over
the next four years. The remaining funds will be financed as
working capital.
   Charles F. Dolan, chairman of Cablevision Systems Corp., said
Sky Cable will give viewers in areas not served by cable ``many of
whom don't have the space or funds for old-fashioned satellite
dishes'' a less cumbersome and more economical way to get
high-quality reception and a variety of programming.
   Australia's News Corp., owned by media magnate Rupert Murdoch,
currently uses direct broadcast satellite technology in its Sky
Television system.
   ``We expect to apply our experience to the development of Sky
Cable,'' Murdoch said.
   Bob Wright, president of General Electric Co.'s NBC unit, said
that while free, over-the-air broadcasting will remain ``the heart
of NBC,'' the venture will help further the company's programming
and HDTV goals.
   ``This system capitalizes on our substantial investment in the
development of an American High Definition Television system, as it
will provide an important means of delivering advanced TV to the
home,'' Wright said.
   Local cable operators will be able to market Sky Cable's
services along with their own, the companies said. Sky Cable will
provide subscribers with a choice of multi-channel packages, a la
carte subscription channels and pay-per-view programming.
   Sky Cable's programming also will be packaged for non-cable
homes and as a supplement for homes with wired cable.

<TEXT>
   Consumer prices shot up 1.1 percent last
month, the biggest gain in 7{ years, the Labor Department said
today in a report that reflected sharp increases in fuel and food
costs lingering from December's frigid weather.
   The seasonally adjusted increase in the Consumer Price Index,
the government's primary gauge of inflation at the retail level,
was the largest since a similar 1.1 percent gain in June 1982. The
steepest gain last year was a 0.7 percent rise in April.
   The increase represented an annual rate of 14.1 percent.
   The jump, following 0.4 percent advances in both November and
December, was foreshadowed by a 1.8 percent surge in wholesale
prices in January. But analysts said the spurts should be
short-lived and inflation should return to more moderate levels in
following months.
   ``Increases in food and energy prices accounted for over 60
percent of the January advance,'' the Labor Department said.
``Record monthly increases were recorded in the indexes for fuel
oil and fruits and vegetables _ up 26.3 and 10.2 percent,
respectively _ and gasoline prices rose 7.7 percent.''
   Fuel oil prices rose only 0.2 percent in December.
   Natural gas and electricity costs increased 0.3 percent in
January following a 1.5 percent hike a month earlier.
   Dairy prices, however, were up 2.4 percent after increases of
2.2 percent in December, 1.7 percent in November and 1.4 percent in
October. Analysts said the price hikes were due to last year's
drought, which caused many farmers to slaughter milk cows.
   Gasoline costs, which fell 2.1 percent in December, rose 7.7
percent last month as refineries switched to greater production of
fuel oil.
   Overall, energy prices were up 5.1 percent and food, 1.8 percent.
   However, prices excluding the volatile food and energy sectors,
considered a better gauge of underlying inflationary pressures,
were up 0.6 percent after rising 0.3 percent in December. It was
the largest increase since a similar 0.6 percent gain in January
1989. The previous high was 0.7 percent in January 1984.
   ``A small residual influence from the winter also should keep
food and energy prices up in February,'' said Donald Ratajczak,
director of economic forecasting at Georgia State University.
``However, our projections indicate that price moderation in these
areas is likely later this year.''
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan _ in congressional
testimony Tuesday that sent financial markets into a tailspin _
also said January's consumer price increase was temporary and that
a reversal ``is apparently under way.''
   Greenspan termed the January price spurt ``horrendous'' and said
the risks of higher inflation in the present circumstances were
``larger than we should be willing to tolerate.''
   Analysts interpreted Greenspan's comments as a signal that the
Federal Reserve is intent on pursuing a tight-money policy in an
effort to restrain inflation and thus will not move anytime soon to
push interest rates lower.
   ``The message is that interest rates will stay high and perhaps
go higher as the central bank keeps the economy throttled back to
bring down inflation,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the
Boston Co.
   Greenspan said the Fed had lowered its overall inflation
estimate for 1990 to between 4 percent and 4.5 percent, down from a
June forecast of 4.5 percent to 5 percent.
   Nevertheless, he emphasized that inflationary pressures remain
too high and he indicated the Fed would continue its tight-credit
and high-interest policies.
   The Bush administration is forecasting a 1990 inflation rate of
4.1 percent.
   Before taking into account normal seasonal changes, the Consumer
Price Index stood at 127.4 in January. That meant that a
hypothetical selection of goods and services costing $100 in the
1982-84 base period would have cost $127.40 last month, up from
$121.10 a year earlier.
   In a separate report, the Labor Department said Americans'
average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, fell 0.7
percent in January.
   The decrease stemmed from a 1.1 percent increase in prices as
measured by a special index for urban wage earners, which was
partially offset by a 0.1 percent increase in average hourly
earnings and a 0.3 percent increase in average weekly hours.
   Average weekly earnings in January before adjusting for
inflation were $338.24, up 2.8 percent from a year earlier. Taking
the 5.2 percent inflation rate for urban workers into account over
the 12-month period, real weekly earnings were down 2.3 percent.
   The Labor Department offered these other details of price
changes in January:
   _Reflecting the overall food price increase, grocery store foods
advanced 2.9 percent, their largest increase since a 7.1 percent
rise in August 1973. Nearly two-thirds of the gain was due to
fruits and vegetables.
   Fresh vegetables were up 22.6 percent, including a 75.6 percent
jump in the cost of tomatoes.
   Meat, poultry, fish and egg prices rose 1.9 percent, including
jumps of 2 percent for beef, 1.3 percent for pork and 1 percent for
fish. Poultry prices were up 0.6 percent and eggs advanced 9.1
percent.
   _Apparel prices were unchanged in January.
   _Entertainment costs rose 0.6 percent.
   _Housing expenses advanced 0.7 percent, half of which was
attributed to a 2 percent increase for fuel and other utilities.
   _Medical care also was up 0.6 percent to a level 8.4 percent
above a year ago.
   _Transportation costs jumped 2.1 percent. Public transportation
rose 1.9 percent, reflecting increases of 1.3 percent in airline
fares and 3.9 percent in intracity public transportation.

   Stock prices slid this morning in response to a
steep drop on the Tokyo Stock Exchange that was echoed in London.
The U.S. markets also reacted to government figures showing a jump
in inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 16.44 points to
2,580.41 in the first hour and a half of trading. Earlier, the Dow
was down by as much as 30 points.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 312 up, 996 down and
445 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 61.89 million shares as of 11
a.m. on Wall Street.
   In Tokyo, the key Nikkei Index plunged 1,161.19 points, or 3.15
percent, to 35,734.33. The index was pushed down primarily by
computerized selling of stocks by foreign brokerage firms in the
last half hour of trading.
   This morning, the Labor Department said the Consumer Price Index
for January rose 1.1 percent, the biggest jump in 7{ years.
However, the department said, hikes in food and energy prices,
which are subject to seasonal increases, accounted for about 60
percent of the increase.
   Analysts interpreted the figures to mean the Federal Reserve
would not consider pressing interest rates lower anytime soon to
stimulate the economy. Higher interest rates tend to discourage
investments in stock.
   Edward Collins III, head of institutional trading at Daiwa
Securities America, said the market may have overreacted to the
consumer price figure at the start of trading.
   ``This may just be an aberration that just occurred for one
month,'' he said.
   Among blue chip stocks, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph lost | to
38&rsqb;, Philip Morris was down { to 37\, American Express dropped \ to
28 and General Electric was down &rsqb; to 60{.
   Prices of U.S. Treasury bonds rose slightly this morning after a
sharp drop in government bond prices Tuesday that sent interest
rates upward. The higher interest rates in the United States and
abroad caused stock prices to slide sharply, with the Dow Jones
average losing 38.74 points.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
0.92 to 180.45. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 2.00 at 352.88.

<HEAD>Law Upheld Allowing Abandoned Rail Lines to Be Used for Nature
Trails</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today upheld a federal law
that allows abandoned rail lines to be used for nature trails.
   The court, in a case from Vermont, unanimously rejected
arguments that the 1983 law, known as the ``rails-to-trails'' act,
unconstitutionally deprives property owners of use of their land
without just compensation.
   Justice William J. Brennan, writing for the court, said a
separate federal law permits property owners to file a claim
against the government to determine whether they are entitled to
compensation.
   Brennan also said the rails-to-trails law is a legitimate
exercise of congressional power aimed at ``encouraging the
development of additional recreational trails.''
   The ruling could affect a large number of property owners. Some
10,000 miles of railroad rights-of-way have been abandoned in the
United States since 1985.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Limited the Office of Management and Budget's power to order
changes in federal job-safety rules.
   The court ruled 7-2 that the OMB, in trying to reduce paperwork
for private businesses, may not block or change rules made by other
government agencies.
   _ Upheld federal regulations aimed at saving the government time
and money when it mistakenly overpays some Social Security
recipients.
   The justices, voting 5-4 in a case from Colorado, said the rules
are a reasonable interpretation of the Social Security Act. The
court rejected arguments that needy recipients could suffer undue
hardship.
   _ Reinstated a $6.1 million award against the Arthur Young &amp; Co.
accounting firm won by investors in the Farmer's Cooperative of
Arkansas and Oklahoma.
   The justices, by a 5-4 vote, ruled that the financial notes held
by the co-op's investors are ``securities'' as defined by federal
law.
   A federal appeals court had thrown out the award after ruling
that the notes were not securities. Today's decision reversed that
ruling.
   The rails-to-trails law was challenged by J. Paul and Patricia
Preseault, who claim they own land on a right-of-way abandoned by
Vermont Railroad Inc. That claim is disputed by Vermont officials
who say the state owns the land.
   The railroad discontinued service in 1975 over a 1.7-mile
stretch of its North Burlington branch rail line in Chittenden
County, Vt.
   If the Preseaults own the disputed property, they have a right
under Vermont law to use the land once rail service is discontinued
and the railway's easement automatically expires.
   But the federal law _ an amended version of the earlier National
Trails System Act _ allows for railroad rights-of-way to be
maintained for possible future railroad use while the land is
converted at least temporarily to nature trails.
   This practice, known as rail banking, is at the heart of the
case decided today.
   Vermont entered into a lease with the city of Burlington that
allows the city to maintain the right-of-way as a trail while
preserving it for possible rail use.
   Citing the state-city agreement, the Interstate Comerce
Commission rejected the Preseaults' bid to have the rail line
declared officially abandoned.
   The Preseaults said the rail-banking provisions are a sham aimed
at disguising the true purpose of the federal law _ preventing
reversion of rights-of-way to property owners after abandonment.
   The couple said the rail-banking procedure is intended to
disguise the fact that the rail lines have been abandoned.
   Brennan rejected that argument.
   The law is not invalid ``merely because more Draconian measures
_ such as a program of mandatory conversions or a prohibition of
all abandonments _ might advance more completely the rail-banking
purpose,'' he said. ``The history of congressional attempts to
address the problem of rail abanondonments provides sufficient
reason to defer'' to Congress, he added.
   The Preseaults said the 1983 law violates the Constitution's
Fifth Amendment, which bars the taking of private property without
just compensation, and also said it interferes unlawfully with
interstate commerce.
   The case is Preseault vs. ICC, 88-1076.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, turning higher
after a lower opening linked to fears of a continued decline in
stock prices.
   Tuesday's 39-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrials average
prompted corresponding sell-offs in the wheat and soybean markets.
Crop futures opened slightly lower today in anticipation of further
weakness in the stock market but stock prices appeared to be
recovering after an opening plunge.
   Adding to this morning's bullish mood was Tuesday's weekly
Agriculture Department export inspections report, which indicated
better-than-expected foreign demand for U.S. soybeans and wheat.
   Strength in the wheat market was limited, though, by reports of
improved soil moisture in the winter wheat fields of the Southern
Plains.
   In early trading, wheat futures were { cent lower to } cent
higher with the contract for delivery in March at $3.81} a bushel;
corn futures were { cent to 1\ cents higher with March at $2.42 a
bushel; oat futures were { cent lower to 1\ cents higher with March

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today reinstated a $6.1
million award against the Arthur Young &amp; Co. accounting firm won by
investors in the Farmer's Cooperative of Arkansas and Oklahoma.
   The justices, by a 5-4 vote, ruled that the promissory notes
held by the co-op's investors are ``securities'' as defined by
federal law.
   A federal appeals court had thrown out the award after ruling
that the notes were not securities.
   Sold for many years by the co-op to thousands of farmers, the
notes were uninsured, payable on demand and yielded only interest.
   When the co-op filed for bankruptcy protection in 1984, about
1,600 of its 23,000 members held notes they had purchased for more
than $10 million.
   Among other legal actions, investors filed a ``class action''
lawsuit against Arthur Young &amp; Co., which had audited the co-op's
1981 and 1982 financial statements and issued reports on those
statements.
   The suit alleged that the accounting firm fraudulently had
misled investors about the co-op's financial strength, in violation
of a federal security law's anti-fraud provisions.
   A federal jury awarded the investors about $6.1 million in
compensatory damages, but the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
threw out the award when ruling that the notes were not securities.
   In disagreeing with the 8th Circuit court, Justice Thurgood
Marshall noted ``Congress' broader purpose ... of ensuring that
investments of all descriptions be regulated to prevent fraud and
abuse.''
   He was joined by Justices William J. Brennan, Harry A. Blackmun,
John Paul Stevens and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White,
Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia dissented.
   The case is Reves vs. Ernst and Young, 88-1480.

<TEXT>
   Apple Computer Inc. said today it would cut
its work force by 3 percent, eliminating 400 jobs because of
sagging profits and falling sales.
   The layoffs for Apple Computer _ the world's No. 2 personal
computer maker with sales of $5.3 billion last year _ become
effective in two months, the company said.
   Reductions will be made in the marketing and distribution
departments of Apple's domestic division and in personnel, finance
and customer service divisions throughout the company.
   About 280 of the jobs eliminated will be at Apple's headquarters.
   The Cupertino-based company will continue hiring workers for
research and development and for its domestic sales force. Hirings
also will continue in Apple's European and Southeast Asian
divisions.
   Chairman John Sculley blamed the layoffs on the slowing growth
of the U.S. personal computer industry.
   Analysts, however, have been criticizing the company for
neglecting _ and even alienating _ some of its traditional
customers.
   ``We expect that the cost reduction steps we have identified
will help ensure long-term profitability and will enable Apple to
continue to prosper in the 1990s,'' Sculley said in a prepared
statement.
   ``Most everybody left at the company is making a big sigh of
relief, but Apple will still have the problem of low morale in its
product developing division that remains to be corrected,'' said
Abigail Christopher of International Data Co., a market researcher
in Framingham, Mass.
   ``So this will add some stability, but they've got a way to
go,'' she said in a telephone interview today.
   On Jan. 15, Apple said it planned to make an undetermined number
of layoffs. At the time, it also froze the salaries of some
employees for at least six months, eliminated automobiles for
U.S.-based executives and cut back its profit-sharing plan.
   Analysts have criticized Apple for neglecting its low-end
products, particularly Apple II and the bottom-of-the-line
Macintoshes.
   Apple has been stressing more powerful, more expensive models
for corporate use, and as a result its sales of the other models
have plummeted in the past year, analysts said.
   The layoffs also follow a major restructuring that reportedly
will see the departure of Jean-Louis Gassee, Apple's new products
developer. Allan Loren, who had been president of Apple's domestic
division, left the company because of sagging sales of its U.S.
division.
   Gassee was criticized for failing to introduce new low-priced
models of the Macintosh and for the company's portable computer,
which many of the company's legions of stalwart users complain is
bulky, slow, expensive and difficult to read.
   The company's largest number of layoffs occurred in 1985, when
it cut its workforce by 20 percent because of the recession in the
personal computer industry. In that cutback, 1,200 jobs were lost.

   Into that already stuffed file of ``lessons we
should have learned but didn't'' you may drop the latest data on
oil imports, which in January reached the highest level in 12 years.
   Not only are imports rising, domestic production also is
falling, and is now lower than it was two decades ago.
   Petroleum imports in January reached 9.1 million barrels a day,
or more than half what is consumed in the United States, a nation
that has enormous fuel reserves available.
   At the same time, domestic crude oil production dropped in
January to just 7.4 million barrels a day, more than 5 percent
lower than a year earlier and 20 percent lower than levels of about
four years ago.
   Foreign oil sources are being relied upon more each year,
domestic sources less each year, a remarkable trend in terms of
history, geography, economics and national security. Among them:
   _The economic destruction in the form of inflation, soaring
interest rates and reduced domestic output that resulted from the
oil embargo of the 1970s.
   _A vow by Americans in all walks of life, from the individual
car owner and homeowner to the White House, never again to be
caught short of oil because of foreign limitations on supply.
   _The balance of payments problem. Oil imports probably account
for as much as $50 billion of the gap between imports and exports.
   _A successful conservation effort by the American people, one
that seemingly could have been maintained almost effortlessly.
   _An assured market for domestic production, made possible by the
long-term growth of the American economy.
   _The demonstrated ingenuity of Americans in developing more
fuel-efficient products, to say nothing about alternative sources
of energy.
   Incredibly, there is little observable effort being made to
rectify the situation by the federal government. Little mention of
the situation is made in the detailed forecasts of economists.
   On the edge of crisis, the oil problem is discussed like the
weather, the assumption being that tomorrow, no matter what anyone
does, there will be oil to burn as surely as there will be a sky up
above.
   The attitude is similar to that which preceded the crises of the
1970s. America, suggests economist Edward Yardeni, one of a
relative few economists who include the problem in their analyses,
is as vulnerable now as then.
   The impact of any increase in the price of oil, or shortage in
supplies, is almost instantaneous, and the reminder is as recent as
now, when oil prices still reflect the unexpectedly severe cold of
December.
   You cannot run factories, homes, schools or churches without
fuel. You cannot distribute food. You cannot draw water in high
buildings; in fact, without fuel you cannot even breath in some.
You cannot see in the night.
   It is one of the more awesome items in the file of ``lessons we
should have learned but didn't,'' because in these modern times we
couldn't live a day without it.
   More awesome, is that the problem can be ignored by so many at
so many levels of society.

   Stock prices ended lower on London's Stock
Exchange today amid nervousness over sharp falls on overseas equity
markets.
   Wall Street's early weakness, coming on the heels of Tokyo's
third-worst sell-off earlier, and a sharp fall in New York Tuesday,
unsettled London investors.
   The declines came on fears of hikes in interest rates, and
worries about the bond markets.
   But Wall Street's ability to recover some lost ground by the end
of the European day gave investors some encouragement.
   ``The Dow is bouncing back which is probably the best news to
happen in a long while,'' one equity strategist said. ``It probably
isn't going to encourage people to buy any new stocks, but it will
likely staunch the selling flow.''
   Said Geoffrey Lewis of the investment firm Smith New Court PLC:
``The market really behaved reasonably well considering the
overnight falls both on Wall Street and Tokyo. The market took the
falls in its stride.''
   But Lewis added, ``It's obviously nervous to see how Tokyo will
react tonight.''
   The Dow Jones industrial average was off 17.79 points at
2,579.05 as London trading ended.
   At the London close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was down 17.3 points, or 0.8 percent, at 2,259.7.
   It finished just below its session high of 2,261.7 points and
better than the minimum of 2,246.0.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was 15.2 points lower at
1,783.8 points at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index
fell 11.08 points to close at 1,228.19.
   Volume was a relatively active 427.8 million shares, compared
with 377.4 million shares Tuesday.
   With Sunday's Japanese general election now out of the way, many
analysts are convinced that Japan's central bank will raise its key
interest rate soon.
   Recent rises in West Germany's money market rates also have
increased fears that the West German central bank might raise its
key interest rates soon too.
   ``One is keeping an eye worldwide on interest rates, certainly
in Japan and over in Germany,'' Lewis said.

<HEAD>Japanese Electronics Giant Buys San Antonio Microchip Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time Sony Corp. will produce
semiconductor chips outside Japan at a plant Sony's U.S. subsidiary
bought from Advanced Micro Devices Inc.
   As part of the deal Advanced Micro Devices gets a look at how
Sony makes semiconductors.
   ``This is more than a sale of the plant,'' said David Frink,
spokesman for Advanced Micro Devices. ``It's a partnership with an
agreement providing for the transfer of state-of-the-art
manufacturing for semiconductors.''
   Sony said Tuesday it paid $55 million for the San Antonio plant
owned by Sunnyvale, Calif.,-based AMD. Sony also hired the plant's
650 employees, and officials said more workers may be hired this
year.
   ``We plan to make a tremendous capital investment in San
Antonio,'' Sony spokesman Jason Farrow said by telephone from New
York. He said this marks the first time Tokyo-based Sony will
produce chips outside its home country.
   Sony Microelectronics Corp., a new subsidiary of Sony USA, will
manage the semiconductor plant.
   The agreement also calls for AMD to continue using a section of
the plant at least until 1994. AMD engineers will observe Sony's
manufacturing methods.
   The plant currently makes programmable logic devices, known as
microchips or semiconductors, for use in such devices as CAT
scanners and facsimile machines, Frink said.
   Sony will make statistic random access memory devices _ SRAMS or
memory chips _ used in a variety of computer devices, he said.
   Advanced Micro Devices' other Texas plant, located in Austin and
employing 2,200 workers, is not part of the Sony deal.
   AMD chairman W.J. Sanders has criticized Japanese trade
practices, but in a statement Tuesday hinted that his criticism was
part of the past.
   ``This agreement between AMD and Sony, Japan's first commercial
semiconductor manufacturer, may be a model for international
cooperation in high technology,'' he said.
   Sanders added that access to Sony's manufacturing know-how will
improve his company's global competitiveness.
   Ownership of the San Antonio plant gives Sony a foothold in the
United States as a domestic producer. Sony customers have
complained of price increases accompanying the strengthening of the
yen, analysts said.
   Sony's semiconductor production is expected to exceed $1 billion
in the fiscal year ending March 31.
   ``What this does is bring in Sony, which has been quite healthy,
to AMD, which hasn't been so healthy,'' said analyst Jay Samstag of
Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago.

   Stock prices regained ground today after opening
sharply lower in response to a plunge on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
and elsewhere overseas. The U.S. markets also were depressed by
figures showing a jump in inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 8.34 points to
2,588.51 at 2 p.m. EST. The Dow had been down as much as 30 points
shortly after the market opened.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 2 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 487 up, 992 down and
452 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 114.66 million shares as of 2
p.m.
   In Tokyo, the key Nikkei Index plunged 1,161.19 points, or 3.15
percent, to 35,734.33, its third-worst drop ever. The index was
pushed down primarily by computerized stock selling by foreign
brokerages in the last half hour of trading. Other overseas
exchanges echoed the decline.
   This morning, the Labor Department said the Consumer Price Index
for January rose 1.1 percent, its biggest jump in 7{ years.
However, the department said, hikes in food and energy prices,
which are subject to seasonal increases, accounted for about 60
percent of the rise.
   Analysts interpreted the figures to mean the Federal Reserve
would not consider pressing interest rates lower anytime soon to
stimulate the economy. Higher interest rates tend to discourage
investments in stock.
   Edward Collins III, head of institutional trading at Daiwa
Securities America, said the market may have overreacted to the
consumer price figure at the start of trading.
   ``This may just be an aberration that just occurred for one
month,'' he said.
   Philip Puccio, a managing director of equity trading at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said the market was spared a
sharp decline by cash-rich institutional investors who saw buying
opportunites after Tuesday's 38.74-point drop in the Dow.
   Before that buying materialized, he said, ``Everybody was
worried we were going to see something close to a Black Monday or
October 13.''
   Puccio said traders also were encouraged by a rebound in U.S.
Treasury bond prices. On Tuesday, a sharp drop in government bond
prices sent interest rates upward, helping depress stocks.
   Among blue chip issues today, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
lost } to 38\, Philip Morris was unchanged at 37}, American Express
dropped &lsqb; to 28&lsqb;, IBM was up 1} to 104|, General Motors was up { at

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
0.37 to 181.00. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 2.44 at 352.44.

<HEAD>TV Station Sale Boosts Pulitzer Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pulitzer Publishing Co. said Wednesday that the
sale of a television station in Indiana helped more than double its
fourth quarter earnings over a year ago.
   The publishing company said net income totaled $18.2 million, or
$1.74 per share, on revenue of $110 million. That compared with
earnings of $7.7 million, or 73 cents, and $106 million in revenue
in 1988.
   Pulitzer said it had a one-time gain of $12.7 million from the
sale of WPTA-TV in Fort Wayne, Ind. Without that, quarterly
earnings would have dropped by 29 percent to $5.5 million, or 52
cents a share, reflecting lower profits at the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch, it said.
   The company said it suffered a 7.7 percent drop in full-run
advertising at the newspaper because of generally soft business
conditions and expanded competition from the September start-up of
the St. Louis Sun daily newspaper.
   It also said promotion and early-retirement expenses increased.
   Chairman Joseph Pulitzer Jr. said, ``Fourth-quarter results
demonstrate the necessity of reducing our operating expenses. We
are addressing this critical issue in our current labor
negotiations, as well as with our ongoing program aimed at
operating efficiencies.''
   For the year, Pulitzer earned $31.4 million, or $3 per share, on
sales of $402 million. That compared with earnings of $19.6
million, or $1.88, and $391 million in revenue, in 1988.
   Besides the Post-Dispatch, Putlizer publishes the Arizona Daily
Star in Tucson, and newspapers and shoppers in the Chicago area.
The company also owns seven network-affiliated television stations
and two radio stations.

   Litton Industries Inc. on Wednesday
said its second-quarter profit rose 3 percent on a 5 percent sales
gain.
   The conglomerate, which makes defense and electronics systems,
builds ships and automated factory lines and provides data for
energy exploration, said it earned $44.6 million, or $1.78 a share,
in the November-January quarter.
   That was up from $43.5 million, or $1.71 a share, in the
corresponding quarter a year earlier.
   Sales grew to $1.27 billion in the latest quarter from $1.2
billion the prior year.
   For the first six months of fiscal 1990, Litton's profit edged
up 1 percent, to $88.1 million, or $3.51 a share, from $87 million,
or $3.40 a share. Sales were up 2 percent for the half-year, from
$2.43 billion to $2.48 billion.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed
moderately higher Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, led by a
surge in soybean oil futures sparked by a burst of buying on the

   Soybeans for March delivery traded up to $5.74 a bushel, their

   Retail prices rose 1.1 percent last month, the
most in 7{ years, as consumers suffered from high food and fuel
costs brought on by December's frigid weather, the government said
Wednesday.
   Leaving food and energy aside, prices rose by 0.6 percent in
January, the steepest increase in a year and double the December
pace.
   The White House called the news disappointing and private
analysts also expressed concern.
   ``Unfortunately, this increase was not all food and energy,''
said Allen Sinai, chief economist at The Boston Co. ``This
indicates an entrenched inflation that will not easily recede.''
   The Labor Department said the increase in its seasonally
adjusted Consumer Price Index was the largest since a 1.1 percent
gain in June 1982. The department said that 60 percent of the
January increase came in food and energy prices.
   The frigid weather a month earlier _ it was the fourth coldest
December since records were first kept 96 years ago _ drove down
fuel stocks and damaged fresh fruits and vegetables, driving prices
up.
   Analysts said food and energy prices should ease by March.
   ``In fact, we're already beginning to see food and energy prices
come down,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic adviser for
the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. ``Certainly, starting with the
March CPI number, we'll see much smaller increases.''
   Nevertheless, there was concern that the so-called core
inflation _ prices excluding the volatile food and energy sectors _
rose 0.6 percent last month, double December's increase and the
largest since an identical 0.6 percent jump in January 1989.
   At the White House, presidential press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater called the jump ``disappointing news'' but said the
administration expects the core rate to decline steadily over the
year.
   ``We are hopeful that this is a bulge that will be temporary in
nature, but inflation requires eternal vigilance and we remain on a
policy of wanting steady growth with low inflation,'' he said.
   John Silvia, an economist with Kemper Financial Services in
Chicago, noted that in addition to food and energy, all other
categories posted increases except apparel, which was unchanged.
   ``The surprising breadth of the increases ... suggests that core
inflation is 4.5 to 5 percent,'' he said. ``If we're stuck there,
that means the Fed is stuck.''
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress on Tuesday
that a reversal of the ``horrendous'' January consumer price rise
was under way but added that inflationary pressures remain too high
and indicated the Fed would continue its tight-credit and
high-interest policies.
   Greenspan also said the Fed had lowered its overall inflation
estimate for 1990 to 4 percent to 4.5 percent, down from a June
forecast of 4.5 percent to 5 percent. The Bush administration is
forecasting a 4.1 percent inflation rate.
   Overall, food prices advanced 1.8 percent while energy costs
increased 5.1 percent, including a record 26.3 percent rise for
fuel oil. Gasoline prices rose 7.7 percent rise while natural gas
and electricity costs combined increased 0.3 percent.
   Prices of fruits and vegetables also posted a record increase in
January, up 10.2 percent. Tomato prices rose 75.6 percent.
   Grocery store prices overall were up 2.9 percent, their largest
increase since a 7.1 percent rise in August 1973. Meat, poultry,
fish and egg prices combined were up 1.9 percent.
   Dairy prices continued their upward spiral, rising 2.4 percent
after increases of 2.2 percent in December, 1.7 percent in November
and 1.4 percent in October. Analysts attributed the hikes to last
year's drought, which caused many farmers to slaughter milk cows.
   Economist Silvia found a 0.7 percent increase in new car prices
surprising in view of the sales incentives that were being offered
in January.
   ``Given that we supposedly had rebates, and prices rose about
the same as during the prior month, it suggest that rebates were
being cut back or that price increases are sticking,'' he said.
   Other categories showing price increases included entertainment
costs, 0.6 percent; housing expenses, 0.7 percent, half of which
was attributed to a 2 percent increase for fuel and other
utilities; medical care, 0.6 percent, and transportation costs, 2.1
percent.
   Before taking into account normal seasonal changes, the Consumer
Price Index stood at 127.4 in January. That meant that a
hypothetical selection of goods and services costing $100 in the
1982-84 base period would have cost $127.40 last month, up from
$121.10 a year earlier.
   In a separate report, the Labor Department said Americans'
average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, fell 0.7
percent in January.
   The decrease stemmed from a 1.1 percent increase in prices as
measured by an index for urban wage earners, but that was partially
offset by a 0.1 percent increase in average hourly earnings and a
0.3 percent increase in average weekly hours.
   Average weekly earnings in January, before adjusting for
inflation, were $338.24, up 2.8 percent from a year earlier. Taking
the 5.2 percent inflation rate for urban workers into account over
the 12-month period, real weekly earnings were down 2.3 percent.

<HEAD>Avon Selling Stake in Japanese Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Avon Products Inc. said Wednesday it plans to
sell its remaining 60 percent stake in Avon Japan to a private
Japanese mail order company and its president in a cash deal valued
at $450 million.
   The big beauty products company decided to withdraw from Japan
after concluding that it would be too costly to try to prosper
there, an intensely competitive environment in which Avon has had
little success expanding its market share.
   Friends of Freesia Co. Ltd. and Freesia President Veji Sasaki
will pay $408 million in cash at the closing _ $338 million plus
$70 million in advance royalties. Another $42 million in advance
royalties will be paid 18 months later, Avon said.
   The proposed deal, which must be approved by Avon's board of
directors, provides for Avon to receive 5 percent in royalties on
all Avon products sold by Avon Japan for the first 18 months after
completion of the deal. After a year and a half, Avon will receive
3 percent in royalties.
   Avon, which started the Japan subsidiary about 20 years ago,
sold 40 percent of the company, or 27.1 million shares, on the open
market in 1987 for $220 million.
   Avon Chairman James E. Preston said proceeds from the sale of
its remaining interest will be used to reduce its $600 million
debt. Avon last year reduced its $1.1 billion debt by $500 million,
he said.
   John Cox, Avon's spokesman, said the company decided it would be
too costly to continue trying to succeed in a highly competitive
market where it has only about a 4 percent market share. Cox said
Avon's assets could be put to better use in other Pacific Rim
countries.
   ``Japan has a mature cosmetics market with strong competition,''
Cox said. ``To grow would involve heavy investing in advertising,
marketing, plant and equipment.''
   Avon Japan earned $15.3 million in fiscal 1989 on sales of $285
million. The subsidiary employs 2,000 workers and has 350,000
independent sales representatives. About 25 percent of its sales
are by direct mail.
   Freesia, a private company with sales of about $180 million,
will retain current Avon management and operate the company as a
subsidiary. Avon will give Freesia exclusive use of its
``trademark, intellectual property rights and product technology''
for 10 years.
   Avon also will retain two seats on the board of Avon Japan and
will provide consulting and product research and development
services.
   Avon's board will consider the planned transaction at the next
regular meeting, scheduled for March 1.
   Securities analysts endorsed the sale plan and said it would
improve the bottom line of the New York-based direct sales company.
   Andrew Shore of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. estimated the sale
will contribute about 15 cents a share to Avon's 1990 earnings.
``It will go a long way to restoring the health of the balance
sheet.''
   The company's financial performance has been scrutinized over
the past year or so by several investors contemplating possible
takeovers. Avon rejected outright acquisition proposals of $2.1
billion from rival direct sales company Amway Corp. of Ada, Mich.,
and of $2.85 billion from Minneapolis-based investor Irwin Jacobs.
   It also fended off takeover feelers from Mary Kay Cosmetics,
another leading direct seller of beauty products.
   A limited partnership including a subsidiary of Mary Kay Corp.,
the Dallas-based privately held parent of the cosmetics marketer,
also has been building a stake in Avon stock. Chartwell Associates
announced in late December that it had increased its holding to 8.7
percent.
   Avon last week said it earned $54.6 million, or 34 cents a
share, in 1989 compared with a deficit of $404.5 million, or $6.79
a share, in 1988. The 1988 results reflected $546 million in losses
from discontinued operations. Sales in 1989 rose 8 percent to $3.3
billion from 1988's $3.1 billion.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert creditors said Wednesday
they will seek a bankruptcy court investigation of up to $350
million in year-end bonuses paid shortly before the firm's collapse.
   A Drexel spokesman said the payments were set in December and
were not made with any knowledge the firm would go out of business.
Drexel's parent company filed for bankruptcy court protection last
week.
   ``We're talking about bonus payments so large they arguably put
Drexel into bankruptcy,'' said William G. Schopf Jr., general
counsel of First City Bancorp. of Texas Inc., which is owed $25
million. ``If that's true, it would be something we would seek to
reverse if possible.''
   Schopf and other creditors said they would seek details about
the payments from Drexel executives during bankruptcy court
proceedings.
   Also, Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee's finance subcomittee, said the panel
planned to look into the bonus payments in the coming weeks.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Howard Buschman late Tuesday granted First
City a hearing on its motion seeking to force Drexel to detail
asset sales made in the liquidation of the brokerage subsidiary,
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Drexel has sold nearly $40 billion in securities positions as
well as other assets in its dismantling. The firm still is trying
to liquidate about 18 percent of its portfolio and sell equipment,
furniture and other assets.
   The creditors could face difficulties because the securities
subsidiary is not covered by the bankruptcy filing. But they said
they would seek to investigate the payments because of their size
and timing.
   ``It gives rise to concern, as does any large transfer made
shortly prior to the bankruptcy filing,'' said Wayne Davis, an
attorney with a New York law firm representing several large
creditors.
   Creditors may seek to recover payments made outside the normal
course of business for up to 90 days before a bankruptcy filing.
The period stretches to one year for payments to company insiders.
   Sources said the bonuses totaled between $300 million and $350
million. But Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said the size of most
of the cash payouts was determined in December, before the firm's
financial problems became critical.
   He said one executive chose to take his entire bonus in Drexel
stock _ the value of which was wiped out by the firm's demise.
   ``There was no sense of foreboding here at all,'' Anreder said.
``It was only in the last week and a half that things were
difficult, but even then no one thought'' the firm would go under.
   Anreder said the bonuses were paid in December and early
January. The size of some of the payments was determined in early
1989, he said.
   ``We did what we believed we had to do competitively, and it was
within both the norms of what the longstanding practice had been at
the firm and within the norms of the industry,'' Anreder said.
   Drexel insiders said some individual bonuses exceeded $10
million, with reports being circulated of payouts approaching $20
million. They contended the firm could have slashed its bonuses _
long regarded as among the industry's most excessive _ to save
money. The firm lost about $40 million in 1989.
   They also said the payouts raised questions about management's
handling of the firm's deteriorating financial condition in the
months leading up to the bankruptcy filing.
   Anreder said Drexel reduced 1989 bonuses, but he did not specify
by how much. Most Wall Street firms cut the payouts by up to 20
percent last year because of a severe securities industry business
slowdown.
   Drexel's parent sought bankruptcy protection Feb. 13 after it
defaulted on $100 million in short-term loans and banks refused to
extend credit. The firm had relied on such loans to sustain its
capital base.
   Anreder said Drexel, aware of its financial problems, late last
year moved to shore up its standing through employee payments,
requiring executives making more that $200,000 a year to take up to
18 percent of their salary in company securities.

   The dollar ended mostly higher in thin, nervous
trading Wednesday following a mixed performance overseas.
   Gold prices rose in New York and Hong Kong but slipped in Europe.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $418 a troy ounce, down $1.90 from late
Tuesday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for
gold at $417.80 an ounce, off $2.10.
   The dollar started out higher in Japan, but fell back in Europe
as dealers became unnerved by sharply falling stock prices in Tokyo
and a bond market rally in West Germany.
   Those worries, however, failed to have a major impact on traders
in New York.
   ``I don't think there's any incentive to buy or sell,'' said
Earl I. Johnson, of Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago. ``The market
needs more information on the U.S. economy.
   ``There's (also) a lot of uncertainty about a (proposed)
monetary union in Germany, and nervousness about firmer interest
rates abroad.''
   The dollar had little reaction to a government report showing an
unexpectedly high 1.1 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index in
January _ even though increased inflation lessens prospects for
lower interest rates, which would depress the dollar, dealers said.
   They said the market already had anticipated higher inflation
when Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan testified before
Congress on Tuesday.
   The dollar was quoted at 1.6645 West German marks in London,
down from 1.6748 marks, and 1.6725 marks in New York, up from
1.66835 marks Tuesday.
   But the dollar weakened against the British pound, largely due
to comparatively higher interest rates in Britain. Sterling bought
$1.7145 in London, up from $1.7040 late Tuesday, and $1.7125 in New
York, up from $1.7115.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.4795 Swiss francs, up from 1.4785;
5.6730 French francs, up from 5.6670; 1,238.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,237.50; and 1.19825 Canadian dollars, down from 1.20075.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Tuesday: 1.4735 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4865; 5.6500 French francs, down from 5.6875;
1.8780 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8845; 1,242.00 Italian lire,
down from 1,243.00; and 1.2008 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2014.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.57 yen to a closing 145.15 yen. The
dollar traded at 145.30 yen in London, and at 145.50 yen in New
York, up from 145.155 yen.
   Meanwhile, gold fell in London to a late bid price of $418.85 an
ounce from $419.75 late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold fell to $419.50 an
ounce from $419.75.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.18 to close at $419.68 an
ounce.
   Silver prices slipped. Silver bullion for current delivery
closed at $5.272 a troy ounce, down from $5.332 Tuesday. Silver
fell 2 cents in London to $5.33 an ounce.

<HEAD>Iacocca Unveils Ad Saying U.S. Cars Match Japanese</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca said
Wednesday that Japan should be stripped of the ``Teflon kimono''
image that implies its cars are better made than American autos,
but said Chrysler's new ad campaign along those lines didn't amount
to Japan-bashing.
   ``For the life of me, I don't know why there seems to be this
national inferiority complex,'' Iacocca told reporters on the first
leg of a six-city tour to showcase Chrysler products and its new
advertising campaign.
   He spoke in a hotel ballroom before a display of Chrysler autos
ranging from the minivan and Jeep to sports and luxury cars.
   ``Every time I pick up the paper, I seem to read another story
that reinforces the idea that anything made overseas, including
Europe, is somehow better than anything made in America,'' he said.
``We're not going to let that kind of crap go unchallenged any
more.''
   The nation's third-largest automaker, which last week reported a
$664 million loss in the fourth quarter of 1989 and a 65.8 percent
drop in profits for the year, is preparing a major advertising
blitz with the theme ``Advantage Chrysler.'' The message is that
Chrysler quality has improved sharply since the early 1980s and
equals or surpasses its Japanese counterparts.
   The centerpiece is a 60-second spot in which Iacocca gives a
boardroom pep talk to other Chrysler Motors chairman Bennett E.
Bidwell, Chrysler Corp. Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald, and other
company executives seated around a table.
   ``Americans just don't understand the quality of our cars. We've
gotta get people to wake up to the truth,'' Iacocca says in an
impassioned tone. ``The truth is we've got advantages over the
Japanese in every car we make, but nobody knows it. And that's
gonna change.''
   He insisted the campaign was not Japan-bashing, but complained
about media reports portraying Japanese cars as superior and
criticized as inadequate U.S. government efforts to open Japanese
markets to American cars.
   ``Japan today is wrapped in a Teflon kimono, especially when it
comes to cars,'' he said. ``Maybe it's time to just start peeling
back the kimono a little bit.''
   The campaign will have failed if consumers' primary reaction is
``there's Iacocca Japan-bashing,'' Greenwald said. ``We're not
angry at anybody; we're simply saying ... go look at the products.''
   Iacocca said the initial commercial will hit the airwaves in
early March.
   Chrysler is trying to cut costs by $1.5 billion this year
through reorganization and layoffs. It has closed its Jefferson
Avenue plant in Detroit and plans to close a St. Louis facility by
mid-September.
   Iacocca said it was too early to say whether further cutbacks
would be needed. ``It's an ongoing thing,'' he said. ``When we get
to a billion and a half, we're going to keep looking.''

   Upjohn Co. said Wednesday it was
consolidating its drug research, testing and treatment divisions
into a new corporate entity, Upjohn Laboratories.
   The consolidation is to be completed by April 1, Upjohn said.
   Upjohn said the change was designed to direct research toward
areas where developments are most in demand, such as cardiovascular
disease, cancer and viral diseases including acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   Upjohn Laboratories is to have facilities in Kalamazoo; Tsukuba,
Japan; and Crawley, England. It also is to oversee research efforts
in Sweden, France, England and West Germany funded through Upjohn's
European Discovery Center program.
   Dr. Jerry R. Mitchell, formerly vice president for
pharmaceutical research, will be president of Upjohn Laboratories,
the company said.
   Upjohn employs 20,000 people worldwide. The company develops and
manufactures human health care products, animal health products and
agricultural products such as vegetable seed and specialty
chemicals.
   Upjohn reported 1989 earnings of $176 million on net sales of
$2.91 billion.

   Stock prices closed moderately lower Wednesday,
rebounding somewhat from an early plunge caused by sharply lower
prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and a government report
indicating a jump in inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed down 13.29 points
to 2,583.56. In the first few minutes of the session it was down by
as much as 30 points before regaining ground on buying by bargain
hunters, analysts said.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
577 up, 963 down and 455 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled 159.24 million
shares, up from 147.30 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 190.68 million shares.
   In Tokyo, the key Nikkei Index plunged 1,161.19 points, or 3.15
percent, to 35,734.33, its third-worst drop ever. The index was
pushed down primarily by computerized stock selling by foreign
brokerages in the last half hour of trading. Other overseas
exchanges echoed the decline.
   Before the U.S. markets opened, the Labor Department said the
Consumer Price Index for January rose 1.1 percent, its biggest jump
in 7{ years. However, the department said, hikes in food and energy
prices, which are subject to seasonal increases, accounted for
about 60 percent of the rise.
   Analysts interpreted the figures to mean the Federal Reserve
would not consider pressing interest rates lower anytime soon to
stimulate the economy. Higher interest rates tend to discourage
investments in stock.
   Edward Collins III, the head of institutional trading at Daiwa
Securities America, said the market may have overreacted to the
consumer price figure at the start of trading.
   ``This may just be an aberration that just occurred for one
month,'' he said.
   Philip Puccio, a managing director of equity trading at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said the market was spared a
sharp decline by cash-rich institutional investors who saw buying
opportunities, especially among blue chips, after Tuesday's
38.74-point drop in the Dow.
   Before that buying materialized, he said, ``Everybody was
worried we were going to see something close to a Black Monday or
October 13.''
   Puccio said traders also were encouraged by a rebound in U.S.
Treasury bond prices. On Tuesday, a sharp drop in government bond
prices sent interest rates upward, helping depress stocks.
   Among blue chip issues Wednesday, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
lost \ to close at 38}, American Express was down \ at 28, IBM was
up 2 to 104~, General Motors was up 1 at 43} and General Electric
was down &rsqb; to 60{.
   Philip Morris was the most active issue on the NYSE, losing &lsqb; to
close at 37| in consolidated trading. The tobacco industry has been
criticized in recent days for marketing campaigns that target
specific groups of the population.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $7.401 billion, or 0.23
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 0.30 to 181.07.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index lost 0.52 to 378.14, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index lost 0.32 to 327.67.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market lost
2.31 to 421.52. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index fell 1.93 to 352.95.

   Energy futures prices closed mixed Wednesday as
wintry weather in many parts of the United States gave heating oil
prices a boost.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for No.
2 heating oil rose 0.15 cent to 57.53 cents a gallon. April heating
oil edged up 0.05 cent to 56.75 cents while contracts for later
delivery declined.
   All crude oil futures contracts finished lower. The April
contract for West Texas Intermediate, the main grade of U.S. crude,
fell 40 cents to $21.74 a 42-gallon barrel. May WTI dropped 33
cents to $21.60 and June ended at $21.40 a barrel, down 30 cents.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for March delivery lost 0.79 cent to
59.41 cents a gallon; April lost 0.69 cent to 60.20 cents a gallon
and May dropped 0.79 cent to 64.08 cents.
   ``Cold weather helped keep heating oil firm,'' said Peter
Beutel, oil analyst and broker at Elders Futures Inc.
   Expectations of lower demand for crude oil during the annual
refinery maintenance period in March and April continued to depress
crude prices, analysts said.
   Randall Rothenberg, an energy trader for Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc., said the price weakness started in the London market, where
warm weather has dampened demand expectations for crude as well as
refined products.
   Analysts said the market also was under pressure ahead of the
weekly American Petroleum Institute inventory report, released
after the close of trading.
   The API, the trade group representing large oil refiners,
reported a 3.7 million barrel drop in crude oil stocks to 344.9
million barrels for the week ended Feb. 16.
   Gasoline stocks rose 2.1 million barrels to 240 million barrels
and distillate inventories increased 2.6 million barrels to 119.3
million barrels, the API reported.

<HEAD>Cattle Futures Plummet in Delayed Reaction to Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Live cattle futures plummeted the permitted daily limit
Wednesday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in a delayed reaction
to last week's government report showing a larger-than-expected
number of cattle being fed for slaughter.
   On other commodity markets, feeder cattle futures also fell
sharply while pork futures advanced; coffee futures rose sharply;
grains and soybeans were higher; precious metals retreated; and
energy futures were mixed.
   Live cattle futures settled .43 cent to 1.5 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in April down the 1.5-cent limit at 75.62
cents a pound.
   Feeder cattle finished .20 cent to 1.22 cents lower with March
at 80.25 cents a pound; live hogs were .13 cent to .35 cent higher
with April at 47.92 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .02
cent to .57 cent higher with March at 52.15 cents a pound.
   Analysts attributed the sell-off in cattle futures to sluggish
beef sales and bearish interpretations of the Agriculture
Department's monthly cattle-on-feed report, which was released
Friday.
   The report showed an 11 percent increase over the previous year
in cattle placements onto feedlots during January in the seven
largest cattle-producing states.
   Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp. in Arlington
Heights, Ill., said the January feedlot placements were the largest
since 1974 and 25 percent above the 10-year average.
   The report initially was construed as extremely bearish and some
analysts were surprised that cattle futures fell less than 1 cent
on Tuesday, the first trading day after the report's release.
   The decline came Wednesday after some trading advisers finished
analyzing the report and added more urgency to their recommendation
to sell. ``It's becoming more and more apparent that we're going to
have a lot of cattle April through June,'' Morgan said.
   Coffee futures rose strongly on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange amid growing optimism that coffee producing and consuming
countries are moving toward reinstatement of export quotas to
support prices.
   The International Coffee Organization lifted export quotas in
July because the 74-nation cartel was unable to resolve U.S.
demands for more high-quality beans and an end to sales of coffee
at discount prices to non-member countries.
   After the quotas were lifted, coffee futures plunged from about
$1.20 a pound to 14-year lows of less than 70 cents.
   Analysts said a meeting of U.S., Colombian, Mexican and Central
American trade representatives next week in Guatemala is perceived
as a step toward eventual reinstatment of coffee export quotas.
   Coffee futures settled 1.25 cents to 2.73 cents higher with
March at 89.64 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures rose moderately on the Chicago Board
of Trade, led by a surge in soybean oil futures sparked by a burst
of buying on the cash market.
   Wheat futures settled 2 cents to 3} cents higher with March at
$3.84{ a bushel; corn was 1\ cents to 2 cents higher with March at
$2.43 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1{ cents higher with March at
$1.36\ a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 5\ cents higher with
March at $5.71 a bushel.
   Precious metals futures retreated on New York's Commodity
Exchange as the stock market rebounded from a steep opening decline.
   Gold futures settled $1.90 to $2 lower with February at $418 a
troy ounce; silver was 6 cents to 6.4 cents lower with March at
$5.28 a troy ounce.
   Petroleum futures finished mostly lower on the New York
Mercantile Exchange ahead of the American Petroleum Institute's
weekly inventory report.
   The report, released after the close, showed an unexpected
2.6-million-barrel decline in U.S. stocks of petroleum distillates,
which include heating oil.
   The API also reported an increase of 2.1 million barrels of
gasoline, as expected, and a decline of 3.8 million barrels of
crude oil, which was somewhat below expectations.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures finished 9 cents to 40
cents lower with April at $21.74 a barrel; heating oil futures were
.43 cent lower to .15 cent higher with March at 57.53 cents a
gallon; unleaded gasoline was .69 cent to .82 cent lower with March
at 59.41 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Texas Billionaire Plans to Run a Slate for Lockheed Board</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Billionaire investor Harold C. Simmons, who
has been battling with the management of Lockheed Corp., said
Wednesday he plans to nominate his own slate of candidates for the
defense contractor's board.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Simmons
said he will nominate a slate for election to the Lockheed board of
directors at the company's annual shareholders meeting March 29.
   A spokesman for Calabasas, Calif.-based Lockheed said the
company had no comment on Simmons' filing.
   But the spokesman, Ron Meder, repeated a statement Lockheed
Chairman Daniel M. Tellep made Feb. 2 after Simmons indicated he
might launch a proxy fight for shareholders' votes to oust board
members.
   Tellep's statement said in part that Simmons offered no plans or
proposals for Lockheed and ``provided no basis whatsoever for us to
determine his intentions with respect to the company or whether his
interests would be consistent with those of Lockheed and its other
shareholders.''
   Meder said Simmons had until Feb. 26 to present his slate before
the meeting. Under the company's by-laws, shareholders have 10 days
from when the annual meeting's date is publiclly announced to
submit a slate.
   In recent months, Simmons steadily has increased his holdings in
Lockheed, developer of the Stealth jet fighter plane, from 6.25
percent last fall to 18.9 percent two weeks ago.

   A title agency formed by the chief
executive officer of a Las Vegas casino is under investigation for
how it appropriated employee salaries and deductions, state
officials confirmed Wednesday.
   The Press of Atlantic City reported in its editions Wednesday
that former workers at Chelsea Title Agency claim the company
failed to put money deducted from their paychecks toward health-and
life-insurance premiums, state unemployment insurance, state and
federal taxes, and credit union accounts.
   The Northfield-based title agency was bought in July 1988 by
Clifford Perlman and the estate of his late brother Stuart for $1.3
million.
   Perlman is the chief executive officer of the MGM Grand Casino
Hotel and Theme Park, which is being built by Kirk Kerkorian in Las
Vegas.
   Calls Wednesday to Perlman's Los Angeles office were not
immediately returned.
   Chelsea Title went out of business Jan. 11 and its assets have
been placed under court protection.
   Michael McCarthy, enforcement head of the state Labor
Department's division of workplace standards, said authorities have
been unable to determine who sits on the title agency's board of
directors. Board members could be held liable for any
discrepencies, he said.
   McCarthy said the department has been unable to find anyone to
serve with a subpoena.
   ``The problem is not getting a subpoena, but who to serve it
on,'' he said. ``That's the mystery.''
   Beyond the question of funds, the investigation is also looking
into claims from about 20 of the company's 55 employees, who say
they were not paid in the two weeks before the company closed.
   Insurance Department spokesman Len Karp said Wednesday that the
department's investigation could take several months, but he would
not comment further. Atlantic County Prosecutor Jeffrey Blitz also
would not comment beyond that his office also is investigating.
   The New Jersey Casino Control Commission denied the Perlmans
gaming licenses in 1980 after the Division of Gaming Enforcement
said the two allowed corporate and personal business dealings with
two Florida businessman allegedly linked to reputed mob figure
Meyer Lansky.
   They were forced to sell their interest in Caesars World Inc.,
the parent company of Caesars Hotel Casino in Atlantic City.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Cos. Wednesday
reported a 45 percent jump in fourth-quarter profit, as higher
crude oil prices offset a decline in chemical earnings.
   The Anglo-Dutch oil giant said its net income for the three
months ended Dec. 31 rose to 1.02 billion pounds, or $1.6 billion
according to average exchange rates for the period, from 702
million pounds, or $1.3 billion, in the same period a year earlier.
   Earnings for Shell Transport and Trading Co. PLC, the British
arm which controls 40 percent of the group, increased to 11.3 pence
a share, or $1.08, from 7.8 pence a share, or 83 cents.
   Earnings per share for Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., the Dutch arm
which controls 60 percent of the company, rose to 3.63 Dutch
guilders, or $1.78, from 3.10 guilders, or $1.56.
   The company's financial statements are based on British
accounting methods and cannot be directly compared to those of most
American companies. Inventories are valued on the basis of first in
first out (FIFO), or on a historic cost basis, instead of the
typical American system of last in first out (LIFO), or on a
current cost basis.
   On a current cost basis, net income rose 17 percent to 892
million pounds from 765 million pounds.
   Sales for the three months advanced 28 percent to 18.2 billion
pounds, or $29 billion, from 14.2 billion pounds, or $25.5 billion,
a year ago.
   Net income for the year jumped 34 percent to 3.95 billion
pounds, or $6.5 billion, from 2.94 billion pounds, or $5.2 billion,
in 1988.
   British earnings per share rose to 44 pence from 32.4 pence.
Dutch earnings per share came to 15.98 guilders vs. 12.35 guilders.
   On a current cost basis, net income rose 13 percent to 3.58
billion pounds from 3.17 billion pounds.
   Annual sales gained 16 percent to 64.8 billion pounds, or $106.1
billion, from 55.8 billion pounds, or $99.4 billion.
   Royal Dutch-Shell, which is based in The Hague, the Netherlands,
and London, said that along with improved results from all areas of
operation, save chemicals, the company was helped by an improvement
in exchange rates, interest and other corporate items.
   Manufacturing, marine and marketing, which include Shell's oil
refining businesses, reported higher earnings on a decline in
sales. The earnings rise, however, was attributed chiefly to
inventory gains.
   U.S. refining operations were particularly depressed in the
latest year. Analysts say the company was hurt by low margins in
the U.S. gasoline market and a missed opportunity in U.S. heating
oil sales, where prices turned sharply higher at year end just as
the company began a planned withdrawal from the market.

<TEXT>
   Jaguar PLC, the luxury British automaker dogged
by an image of slipshod quality, is recalling nearly two-thirds of
the cars it has sold in the United States since 1988 because of
potential brake problems.
   The 38,315 models affected contain a high-pressure hose that
could rupture and spurt hot brake fluid onto an engine, causing
smoke, fire and loss of braking power, the automaker said. The
brake recall also affects 56,000 Jaguars sold in other countries.
   In addition, Jaguar said it is recalling 38,385 cars sold in
this country dating to 1979 for defects that could cause the
automatic cruise control device to jam, raising the risk of crashes.
   The company said it is unaware of any accidents or injuries that
may have resulted from these defects, which will be repaired free
of charge. Owners will be notified by mail.
   The recalls come at a particularly awkward time for Jaguar,
which is suffering from a protracted slide in sales in its most
important foreign market, the United States, just as Japanese and
German competitors are becoming more aggressive about selling
luxury cars in this country.
   The British company, which recently agreed to be acquired by
Ford Motor Co., has long been tainted by reputation for
inconsistent quality, temperamental cars and customer complaints
about service.
   In the brake recall, dealerships will check the brake systems of
all XJ6, Vanden Plas and Majestic cars sold in the United States
for potential leaks. The cruise control recall affects 1979 model
XJ12 sedans and 1982 to 1990 model XJ-S cars.

<HEAD>Bank of Canada Sues Campeau Chairman</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: All figures are in Canadian dollars</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Bank of Canada is suing Campeau
Corp. Chairman Robert Campeau for $50 million to reclaim losses
from an unpaid personal debt.
   In papers filed last week in the Supreme Court of Ontario, the
bank said it was seeking funds from the Toronto entrepreneur to
recover some of its losses on a $150 million loan Campeau defaulted
on last month.
   The National Bank is the third Canadian bank to sue Campeau,
whose Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp.
retailing divisions sought Chapter 11 protection from creditors in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court last month.
   Campeau acquired both retailers in buyouts that depended heavily
on junk bonds, and the companies have been unable to generate
enough cash to pay Campeau's $7.5 billion in debt.
   The other banks suing Campeau are the Bank of Nova Scotia and
the Bank of Montreal.
   The National Bank loan was borrowed by a company controlled by
Campeau to buy securities in Toronto-based Campeau Corp. Campeau
agreed to personally guarantee up to $50 million of the loan.
   The bank already has taken possession of securities pledged
against the loan, but the market value of the securities has
dropped to less than half the $150 million owed on the loan.
   In January, the National Bank stripped Campeau's voting control
of the company he founded in the 1940s when it took possession of
Campeau shares that had been pledged as collateral for the $150
million loan.
   When Campeau's troubles came to light last September, the news
devastated the junk bond market and brought the takeover business
to a near halt. The drop in junk bonds also contributed to last
week's Chapter 11 filing by Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc.

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Resorts International Inc. received a
two-year casino license extension Wednesday, but the gaming company
was ordered to report monthly on its troubled finances.
   The Casino Control Commission said it granted the license
renewal to Resorts International, the parent company of Merv
Griffin's Resorts Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, despite its
bankruptcy proceedings.
   ``The mere filing of a Chapter 11 action does not in and of
itself warrant a conclusion that a company lacks financial
stability,'' acting commission chairwoman Valerie Armstrong said.
``The bankruptcy action is but one, albeit significant, factor.''
   She said Resorts had shown during commission hearings last week
it could become financially stable within the two-year license
period under a ``flat growth'' scenario.
   Resorts filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors in
federal court in Camden last November. It is seeking approval for a
reorganization plan from creditors and a federal bankruptcy judge.
   Resorts last month ``won'' $14.3 million from gamblers, an 11
percent drop from the $16.1 million registered in January 1989,
according to commission figures. The casino's win for all of 1989
dropped 6.4 percent to $227.4 million compared to the previous year.
   Win is the amount of money gamblers lose, and does not take into
account expenses. It is not profit.
   Under the flat growth forecast, Resorts will post a $500,000
cash deficit at the end of 1990 because of an extensive
refurbishing program, the commission said in its unanimous ruling.
   The commission imposed conditions recommended by the Division of
Gaming Enforcement that Resorts file monthly balance sheets, income
statements and statements of cash flow and working capital.
   Resorts officials also must advise regulators on a monthly basis
of significant deviations from financial projections and from prior
financial performance.
   But the commission stopped short of requiring the casino to
report daily or weekly or to set a specific cash balance that would
trigger the imposition of restricted accounts to ensure that wages,
taxes and progressive jackpots are paid.
   Resorts President David C. Hanlon said he was pleased with the
decision and confident the opening April 2 of the neighboring Taj
Mahal casino would reverse the decline of the first gaming hall to
open on the Atlantic City boardwalk in 1978.
   The Taj Mahal, originally owned by Resorts, led to some of its
financial problems as construction costs since 1983 until its sale
to real estate developer Donald Trump in 1988 diverted money from
Resorts and its capital expenditures.
   Resorts reorganization plan seeks to shed about $400 million of
$927 million that Griffin assumed to finance his November 1988
purchase of the property from Trump. Griffin sold Trump the Taj
Mahal in return.

<TEXT>
   For Allen I. Questrom, it's almost like going
back home again to rescue the family from crisis.
   Questrom spent 23 years with Federated Department Stores but
quit when it was acquired by Campeau Corp. of Canada nearly two
years ago with billions of dollars in borrowed money.
   At the time, he feared such an enormous amount of debt would
force Federated to drastically change its philosophy, away from
quality and more toward high-volume selling and price-slashing
promotions _ not his way of running a retailer profitably.
   Now Questrom is in charge of resurrecting Federated and another
of Campeau's multibillion dollar debt-financed acquisitions, Allied
Stores Corp., which both sought protection from creditors last
month in the biggest retailing bankruptcy filing in history.
   Questrom has minimized his contact with the press since he took
over Feb. 2 as chairman and chief executive of Federated and
Allied. But at a news conference to announce his new job, he
laughed when asked whether he thought the task ahead would be the
biggest of his career.
   ``Yes, I think that's safe to say,'' he said.
   His new boss, Federated Stores Inc. chairman and chief executive
officer G. William Miller, was more direct.
   ``If you hadn't said that, I would have gotten out of here,''
said Miller, a former U.S. treasury secretary.
   Questrom, 49, was hired away from Neiman-Marcus, a 22-store
specialty chain based in Dallas. As an added inducement to help
lead the rescue, he will be paid $1.2 million a year _ although
Questrom has insisted that's not the reason he came back.
   Widely respected in the retail business, Questrom is known as a
believer in old-fashioned fundamentals _ clean stores, quality
service, merchandise appropriate to a shopper's income level. In
his view, a store that sells $700 women's dresses, for example,
should not be peddling $19 shoes.
   Questrom clearly faces an enormous problem, because he will have
to combine his philosophy with a strategy that produces more
revenue, cuts costs, satisfies the bankruptcy court and appeases
anxious creditors.
   The Massachusetts native began his tenure with Federated in 1965
as an executive trainee at the Abraham &amp; Straus chain, and by 1973
had become a merchandise manager. Later he ran both Rich's and
Bullock's, two of Federated's best-known subsidiaries (Bullock's
was subsequently sold), and advanced to executive vice president
then vice chairman of the company.
   In May 1988 when Campeau bought Federated for about $6.6
billion, Questrom turned down the new owner's offer to make him
chairman and moved to Neiman-Marcus.
   When he was approached about coming back to Federated after the
bankruptcy filing in January he originally rejected the idea, but
evidently changed his mind because many acquaintances in the
company pleaded with him to reconsider, including a daughter of the
company's founder.
   Questrom returns to work with Federated-Allied president James
Zimmerman. Both insist that the sister retailers, with 260 stores
and 100,000 employees in 28 states, can be healthy and profitable.
   Questrom, Zimmerman and Miller said the biggest obstacle is the
crushing debt burden of $7.7 billion that Federated and Allied
assumed when Campeau purchased the companies.
   Miller said some of that debt likely will never be repaid. The
most vulnerable creditors may be the holders of ``junk bonds'' that
were used to help finance the Campeau acquisitions.
   Questrom said he would concentrate at first on rebuilding
confidence of merchandise suppliers to ensure that Federated and
Allied can maintain their market positions in the spring season.
Zimmerman said sales were off in the first two months of this year.
   The challenge of competing against financially healthy retailers
is a problem that Questrom readily acknowledged.
   ``Obviously, in the short term, that's a key issue. But I think
we're working very aggressively with our vendors to be sure that we
do get deliveries on schedule,'' he said. ``Ninety-eight percent of
the vendors want Federated to be successful. They're working
towards that aim. We all get the same benefit out of being
successful.''
   Questrom said Federated and Allied were streamlined prior to
filing for reorganization to concentrate more on their core
businesses.
   ``We are a department store company now. We were, before, a kind
of a broad-based retail company. I believe the talents of the
organization now are much more focused,'' Questrom said.
   ``Really, it's for Jim and I and the company to really just put
the priorities in order and to focus our attention on running the
business to benefit our customers. And I think we can do it,'' he
said.
   Questrom said the reorganizations under Chapter 11 of the
federal bankruptcy laws give Federated and Allied one advantage in
luring merchandise suppliers. The supervision of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court means companies that deal with Federated and
Allied now receive first priority for payment _ over creditors who
dealt with Federated and Allied before their Jan. 15 filings.
   ``From a retail point of view or a vendor point of view, this is
the safest company to ship to today. This is the place to be
shipping in terms of making sure you get your payments,'' Questrom
said.
   A more natural advantage the company has is its geographical
reach in some of the most important U.S. metropolitan markets.
   ``We own the major properties in each of those cities,'' he
said. ``I think our competitive position will, in fact, come back
to normal in the next 30 to 45 days.''

<HEAD>New York Official Calls for Shuttle Fare Inquiry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state's consumer protection chief called
Wednesday for federal inquiries into rising fares for air shuttle
flights in the Northeast, which he said have soared by as much as
102 percent in four years.
   Richard Kessel, director of the Consumer Protection Board,
charged at a news conference that the Trump and Pan Am shuttles
were gouging captive passengers on their flights linking New York
with Boston and Washington.
   ``As far as air fares, the sky's the limit for the shuttle
flights out of New York,'' Kessel said. ``It's probably becoming
cheaper to send customers to the moon than to Boston or
Washington.''
   On Jan. 3, he noted, Trump Shuttle raised its one-way weekday
fares by 20 percent, from $99 to $119, and Pan Am followed suit.
   Moreover, since the Pan Am Shuttle started in 1986 its New
York-Boston fares have risen by 83 percent and its New
York-Washington fares by 59 percent, Kessel said. Fares on the
Trump Shuttle, which billionaire developer Donald Trump bought from
Eastern Airlines last spring, have increased by 102 percent to
Boston and 72 percent to Washington, Kessel said.
   In the same period, he said, the consumer price index measuring
retail inflation rose 14.3 percent.
   Officials for both shuttle services noted that jet fuel prices
have jumped recently and, more generally, said their fares
reflected their expenses.
   ``We believe today's fares are justified based on the costs that
are incurred in operating a shuttle service,'' said Pan Am
spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon.
   Trump Shuttle President Bruce Nobles said, ``We charge a fair
price in relationship to our cost. ... ``This gentleman does not
understand the economics of our business,'' he said, referring to
Kessel.
   Kessel said the root problem was deregulation of the nation's
airline industry in 1978, which he said stripped protection from
business travelers who have no practical alternative to the
shuttles. He called for investigations of the shuttle fares by
Congress and the U.S. Department of Transportation.

<HEAD>Settle Lawsuit By Ex Member of Leveraged Buyout Giant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former general partner of Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co. who sued the co-founders of the leveraged buyout firm
in a high-stakes dispute over money has settled out of court for an
undisclosed amount.
   A document filed in a New York State Supreme Court Feb. 7 shows
Jerome Kohlberg's claims against the company and the other
partners, Henry R. Kravis and George B. Roberts, have been
discontinued `with prejudice and without cost to either party.''
   The phrase ``with prejudice'' means those claims cannot be
raised in any future lawsuit. Nonetheless, the document's language
suggests Kohlberg could bring claims that may arise from the future
conduct of the defendants.
   The terms of the settlement evidently also require both sides
not to talk about the matter publicly. They declined to comment or
even confirm a settlement had been reached.
   The quiet resolution of this legal brawl came less than six
months after Kohlberg, a pioneer in the business of debt-financed
takeovers known as leveraged buyouts, slapped his ex-partners with
the lawsuit.
   He claimed the firm reduced his stake in several companies
acquired while he was one of KKR's general partners. Kohlberg
claims that violated an agreement he made with the firm when he
left its management in 1987. The defendants denied the claim.
   KKR is the leader in arranging leveraged buyouts, in which
companies are acquired with borrowed money repaid with their
earnings, sale of assets or a combination of both. KKR holds the
record for the biggest takeover in history, the $25 billion
leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc.
   The firm's operations, a mystery to the public, have made its
partners enormously wealthy but some of the most recent deals have
run into trouble because of difficulties in repaying or
renegotiating debt.
   Kohlberg, Kravis and Roberts formed their partnership in 1976,
with each serving as general partners who managed the firm and
directed its acquisitions and investments.
   Kohlberg remained a general partner until 1987, when after a
falling-out with Kravis and Roberts over the firm's strategy he
became a limited partner, sharing in Kohlberg Kravis' profits but
not in its management.
   Among the deals undertaken while Kohlberg was a general partner
were the 1986 leveraged buyouts of consumer products company
Beatrice Cos. for $6.1 billion and the grocery chain Safeway Stores
Inc. for $4.2 billion.

<HEAD>Horizontal Drilling Improves Chances Of Finding Some Oil</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Texas Oil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BIG WELLS, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil companies have brought a technology
learned offshore to the plains of South Texas, turning ``Heartbreak
Field'' into a gusher of activity.
   Horizontal drilling _ a modern term for ``slant hole drilling,''
once an illegal way of draining your neighbor's oil _ has resulted
in record-setting flow rates from wells drilled in the Pearsall
Field of the Austin Chalk, a geological formation running northeast
through Texas from the Mexican border to Carthage into Louisiana
and beyond.
   Oil in the Pearsall Field is contained in narrow, vertical
deposits that make vertical wells more chancy that usual. Even
successful wells have low flow rates, extending the time it takes
to recover investment.
   With horizontal drilling, however, several deposits can be
linked, increasing both the chances of finding oil and the
production once it is found. The technique, first used in undersea
drilling for oil, costs about twice much as an onshore vertical
well but flow rates can be four to five times higher.
   The Pearsall Field, which covers parts of five counties
southwest of San Antonio, is only one place where experts say the
technology could be used.
   Meridian Oil Co. has been using horizontal drilling in the
Bakken Formation of North Dakota since 1987. Other, older Texas
fields _ including parts of the mammoth Permian Basin of West Texas
and eastern New Mexico _ are considered likely candidates, as are
some shallow California fields where so much gas has escaped there
is nothing to carry the oil to the surface.
   ``There are a lot of places in the United States where
(horizontal drilling) will fit, any place where you have a
reservoir that's not continuous,'' said Jim Roberts, production
vice president for Oryx Energy Co., credited with pioneering the
technique in South Texas. Oryx already has begun drilling
horizontal wells in the Bakken Formation and the Ellenburger area
of the Permian Basin.
   The Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates oil production in
the state, is considering expanding to the rest of the state new
rules it put in place for the Pearsall Field.
   A report from the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University
of Texas says horizontal drilling ``holds significant promise'' and
could add 11 billion barrels of easily recoverable oil to Texas
reserves, an increase of more than 31 percent over current
estimates.
   While most of the attention has been focused on horizontal
drilling, other technologies also are enhancing discovery and
recovery of oil at the same time concern again is growing about
U.S. dependence on foreign supply.
   There is little chance that a major oil deposit remains to be
found in the United States, experts believe, so explorers are
returning to familiar fields, using new technology to pump more oil
out of old discoveries.
   ``Ninety percent of everything we get added (to reserves) is
from existing fields,'' said William Fisher, head of the Bureau of
Economic Geology, who estimates U.S. reserves of easily recoverable
oil at about 100 billion barrels.
   Enhanced recovery can get 230 billion more barrels, he said, but
only if the price reaches about $25 per 42-gallon barrel. The price
now hovers around $22, and analysts don't foresee $25 for several
years.
   The technologies range from using a mixture of molasses and
microbes to raise pressure in sagging wells to re-evaluating
seismic data to find missed oil deposits.
   One company, Western Resource Technologies Inc., is pushing five
methods it says it can use to turn dry holes and abandoned wells
into new gushers.
   ``We like to think of ourselves as the Mel Fisher of the oil
patch,'' said Western Chairman Steven S. McGuire, referring to the
celebrated undersea treasure hunter.

   Georgia-Pacific Corp. expects to pay some $200
million in fees and expenses to finalize its $3.8 billion
acquisition of Great Northern Nekoosa Corp., the company disclosed
in documents Wednesday.
   Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific disclosed the anticipated fees in
a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission updating its
$65.75-a-share takeover offer.
   The filing, however, did not disclose any individuals or
companies that would be getting those fees.
   During their protracted legal battles over the last four months,
Georgia-Pacific was advised by the investment banking firm of
Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co. while Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. advised Great
Northern. Neither firm's fees were disclosed in the SEC filing.
   In its filing, Georgia-Pacific said it estimates the total
amount of funds required to close the deal, announced Tuesday, for
Great Northern's 57 million outstanding shares ``is approximately
$3.8 billion, with another approximately $200 million being
required to pay related fees and expenses expected to be incurred.''

<HEAD>More Losses for Northrop, Which Blames Fixed-Price Development
Pacts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northrop Corp., the builder of the B-2
bomber, said it lost $16.6 million in the fourth quarter and $63.5
million in 1989, largely because of high costs on fixed-price
research and development contracts with the government.
   The fixed-price accords have been costly for many aerospace
giants. McDonnell Douglas Corp., whose fourth-quarter profits fell
58 percent, has run behind schedule in developing the C-17 cargo
plane and T-45 Navy training jet. And Lockheed Corp. showed about
$300 million in pretax fourth-quarter losses because of unforeseen
changes on a new submarine-hunting plane.
   Northrop took a total of $240 million in writeoffs for such
development losses in 1989, with $28 million of that in the fourth
quarter. About $81 million of the writeoffs were on development of
radar-jamming equipment, and another $159 million on classified
programs in Northrop's missiles and unmanned vehicles segment.
   Since early 1988, Northrop has refused to accept fixed-price
development contracts. Lockheed and Rockwell International Corp.
also refuse to do so, saying the risk of unforeseen expenses is too
great during the initial development of complicated programs for
the military.
   For the October-December quarter, Northrop lost $16.6 million,
or 35 cents a share, compared with a loss of $86.1 million, $1.83 a
share, in the same period of 1988. Sales plunged 23.2 percent to
$1.33 billion from $1.73 billion.
   For the full year, Northrop lost $63.5 million, or $1.35 a
share, compared with earnings of $104.2 million, or $2.22 a share,
in 1988. The 1988 profit figure included a favorable one-time tax
adjustment of $135.1 million. Sales fell 9.5 percent last year to
$5.25 billion from $5.8 billion in 1988.
   Separately, Northrop said it had completed the previously
announced sale of twin office towers in Century City that house its
headquarters, for $218 million in cash. Northrop, whose total debt
had been $1.2 billion, used the proceeds to reduce its short-term
debt to $424 million. The company is leasing back its headquarters
space.
   The sale yielded a pretax gain of $136 million, of which $102
million will be recognized in 1990 and the rest spread over the
next 10 years. After-tax earnings for the first quarter of 1990
will benefit by $67 million, or $1.42 a share, the company said.
   Fourth-quarter revenues fell in the aircraft segment as
development work on the B-2 wound down and fewer main body
assemblies were delivered for the FA-18 fighter.
   Sales also fell in the electronics segment, where deliveries of
guidance systems for the MX missile fell, and in the missiles and
unmanned vehicles segment. The latter decline stemmed from an
accounting change for work on a classified contract, causing a $120
million reduction in quarterly sales.
   For the full year, the effect of the fourth-quarter charges was
partially offset by higher revenues from startup of B-2 production
and increased delivery of parts for the Boeing 747 jetliner.
   Northrop said its business backlog stood at $5.6 billion at the
end of 1989, compared with $4.9 billion at the end of 1988. Kent
Kresa, the company chairman, has predicted 1990 sales will stay at
about the same level as in 1989.

   State environmental officials complained
Wednesday that Senate and White House negotiations are weakening a
proposed clean air bill so much that many urban areas would not be
able to meet the air quality standards.
   The officials, from 13 states, many of which are plagued with
some of the worst urban smog problems in the country, criticized
the closed-door deal-making and urged Senate leaders to bring the
measure to the Senate floor where it can be openly debated.
   Among the state officials who accused the Senate and
administration negotiators of weakening the Senate bill were those
responsible for air pollution controls in Southern California and
the New York City area, two regions facing the most serious smog
problems.
   Under the compromises already tentatively agreed to in the
private Senate negotiations ``we would not be able to obtain
healthy air in Southern California,'' said Norton Younglove,
chairman of the South Coast Air Quality Management District in
California.
   Thomas Joring, New York state commissioner of environmental
conservation, said some of the provisions worked out in the private
talks would make the new air pollution control law weaker than
current law, especially as it applies to curbing urban smog.
   The criticism came as Senate leaders and the Bush adminstration
continued the closed-door discussions for a third week in hopes of
crafting a bill that would have enough support to avoid a
contentuous debate and possible filibuster on the Senate floor.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said he hoped to conclude
by the end of the week the private discussions on the bill, which
would revise federal air pollution controls for the first time in
13 years.
   Mitchell said he expects ``plenty of debate on the Senate
floor'' once the private discussions are completed.
   While the talks have reached tentative agreements on some parts
of the bill such as curbs on acid rain, major differences remained
over how to reduce pollution for automobiles.
   The Senate bill calls for a second round of tailpipe controls,
while the administration says that's too expensive and favors using
cleaner motor fuels in the most polluted areas of the country such
as Los Angeles and the Northeast.
   But the state pollution control officials focused their
criticism on areas where the negotiators already have reached
agreement.
   Among the areas of concern were compromises that would: no
longer require the federal government to impose a smog cleanup plan
if local officials are unwilling or unable to do so; that would
exempt small industrial polluters from urban smog controls; reduce
the geographic areas that would be covered under urban air cleanup
programs.
   ``The pollution cleanup program envisioned by this (Senate-Bush
administration) deal will not work in practice,'' the state
officials said in a statement.
   The group included air pollution control officials from the
states of California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Colorado,
Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, Vermont and Maine.
   Meanwhile, a group of environmental organizations blamed White
House Chief of Staff John Sununu for the administration's stand on
the clean air bill, claiming that Sununu was undercutting the
president's environmental policies.
   The groups, including the National Wildlife Federation, National
Audubon Society and the Natural Resources Defense Council, asked to
meet with Bush to discuss their environmental concerns, including
those involving the clean air bill negotiations.
   Marlin Fitzwater, the president's spokesman, said Sununu
``ensures that all points of view are heard and that is a role that
he has played with regard to environmental policies.''
   ``And the president has made the decisions on environmental
policies; they represent his point of view and his priorities,''
Fitzwater continued. ``And environmnental groups, by the same
token, represent interest groups and pressure groups and it is
their job to keep the pressure on. They're doing it. The governor's
doing his job. I don't see any real difficulty here.''

<HEAD>Interest Rate Concerns Send Stock Prices Skidding</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 9th graf, `The retreat ...' to UPDATE with index down
405 points at end of morning session.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The specter of rising worldwide interest rates rattled major
global stock markets Wednesday, sending prices down in New York and
London after they skidded lower in the Tokyo market's third-worst
drop ever.
   On Wall Street, stocks declined sharply at the opening in
response to the wave of selling overseas and the release in
Washington of a report showing high January inflation that could
push interest rates even higher.
   The Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 40 points in
the early going before regaining some ground. The widely watched
index closed down 13.29 at 2,583.56, giving it a two-day loss of 52
points.
   Broader market indicators also dropped, with declining issues
outnumbering gainers by a margin of about 5 to 3 on the New York
Stock Exchange and the Wilshire Associates index of more than 5,000
stocks losing $7.4 billion in value.
   Stock prices fell on Wall Street after the Labor Department
reported food and energy price hikes helped push its Consumer Price
Index for January up 1.1 percent, the biggest jump in 7{ years.
   The report prompted renewed speculation that the Federal Reserve
_ which has kept interest rates relatively high in an attempt to
curb inflation _ would not move rates lower anytime soon.
   Similar worries sparked the Wednesday selloff in Tokyo, where
the Nikkei Stock Average, the Japanese market's major index, fell
more than 3 percent. That was the market's third biggest dive ever
and worst since the worldwide stock market crash in October 1987.
   The Nikkei average reflecting the performance of 225 selected
issues fell 1,161.19 points, or 3.15 percent, to 35,734.33, after
having fallen nearly 565 points in the previous two trading days.
   The retreat continued Thursday as the Nikkei average fell
another 405.97 points, or 1.13 percent, to 35,328.36 in morning
trading.
   Analysts attributed the Tokyo market's weakness to increasing
speculation that the Bank of Japan would raise its official
discount rate, the interest it charges for loans to commercial
banks.
   Later in London, stock prices fell as traders watched interest
rates rise on the British bond markets and reacted to the overnight
selloff in Tokyo and early weakness on Wall Street.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 issues, down 31
points early in the session, closed down 17.3 points, or 0.8
percent, at 2,259.7
   Inflation has spooked the financial markets since the start of
the year. Wall Street began 1990 with the Dow Jones industrial
average hitting a new high in the first session of the year. But
the market since has been stymied by the prospect of higher
interest rates, which can depress corporate profits.
   Wall Street analysts said the Dow industrials' partial recovery
from Wednesday's early lows represented bargain-hunting more than
an endorsement of the equity market.
   ``You have institutions waiting for the opportunity to buy,''
said Peter VandenBerg, a market analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc.
   The stock market also was aided by firmer prices and lower
yields on the Treasury bond market. Late Wednesday, the
government's bellwether 30-year bond was up $2.50 per $1,000 in
face value, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction
from its price, edged down to 8.64 percent from 8.66 percent late
Tuesday.
   Bonds had also fallen on the CPI report, compounding sharp
losses in the credit markets on Tuesday, but analysts said
Wedneday's declines were more than offset by bargain hunting and by
the decline on Wall Street, which prompted some investors to switch
funds out of stocks and into bonds.
   Similarly, such blue chips as International Business Machines
Corp., which are seen as better long-term bets, did relatively
better. IBM was up $2 to $104.87{ a share Wednesday, outdistancing
the rest of the market.
   Ralph Acampora, a stock market analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp;
Co., said the stock market has been in a ``two-tier'' system since
August, with stocks in the Dow industrial average outperforming the
rest of the market.
   ``It's not horrendous for the blue chips, it's horrendous for
everything else,'' Acampora said.

   Oregon's largest thrift institution, Benj.
Franklin Federal Savings and Loan Association, was seized Wednesday
by regulators who said it failed to meet the stringent financial
standards of the new savings and loan law.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., created last August to dispose of
failed S&amp;Ls, took control of the Portland institution, which has
about $5 billion in assets, after the Office of Thrift Supervision
said Franklin was operating in an unsafe and unsound condition.
   Franklin, largely because of the new capital standards, $106
million in the red at the end of November, according to Ed
Headlund, deputy district director of the thrift office's Seattle
office.
   That was after an accounting break of about $280 million, known
as supervisory goodwill, was removed from its books. It had booked
most of the goodwill as a result of its 1982 acquisition of
Equitable Savings and Loan, which it took over at regulators'
request.
   Goodwill is usually the difference between the purchase price of
an asset and its real value.
   The S&amp;L bill last August revoked the accounting break for
Franklin and scores of other S&amp;Ls. The law now requires
institutions to hold tangible capital of $1.50 for every $100 of
assets, and does not permit them to count good will in the $1.50.
   Also, Franklin suffered from problems in the Oregon real estate
market that surfaced several years earlier, according to Headlund.
   In an attempt to pull out of its problems, Franklin in October
announced a cost-cutting program that included layoffs and the sale
of its commercial lending operation.
   Kevin Shields, a Portland-based spokesman for the Resolution
Trust Corp., said the corporation will try to sell Franklin to or
merge it with another savings and loan.
   ``But that won't happen quickly,'' he said, estimating it would
take six months before buyers might be sought.
   Franklin Chief Executive Officer G. Dale Weight will be on paid
leave, he said.
   Unlike many failed S&amp;Ls, it did not invest heavily in commercial
real estate or in securities such as junk bonds. About 80 percent
of its holdings were residential mortgages.
   Franklin is the largest of Oregon's 12 thrifts. At the end of
September, it was the 41st largest S&amp;L in the nation, according
Sheshunoff Information Services Inc., an Austin, Texas, consulting
firm. In addition to Oregon, it operated branches in Idaho and
Washington state.
   Regulators said Franklin would maintain normal business hours
and stressed that all deposits up to the $100,000 insurance limit
are guaranteed. It had $3.2 billion in deposits in 448,612 accounts.
   Its takeover brings the number of S&amp;Ls under government
management to 320.

   The Federated and Allied department store
chains said they are reorganizing their merchandising services and
dropping store labels in men's suits and slacks, women's shoes and
women's accessories.
   The changes in the retailers' New York-based Federated@Allied
Merchandising Services will eliminate 25 of the division's 280
jobs, spokeswoman Carol Sanger said Tuesday.
   ``This is just refocusing the private label for the brands,''
Ms. Sanger said. ``It's getting out of a couple of areas the
private labels have been in and getting into areas that are more
profitable.''
   The company said merchandising division would concentrate on
women's ready-to-wear, men's home furnishings and children's
clothing.
   Under the reorganization, Lynne Jergensen has been promoted to
the new position of executive vice president for product
development. Ms. Jergensen, who joined Federated Merchandising
Services in 1973, has been a senior vice president for women's and
children's clothing.

<HEAD>Firm Reportedly Paid Out Millions in Bonuses Weeks Before
Bankruptcy Filing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. paid bonuses
totalling hundreds of millions of dollars to its executives just
weeks before its parent company filed for bankruptcy protection, a
newspaper reported.
   The payments totalled as much as $350 million since December,
The New York Times said in Wednesday's editions, citing Wall Street
executives.
   Year-end bonuses are standard practice on Wall Street, although
Drexel has been known for paying huge bonuses, the newspaper said.
   Several people inside the firm said some top executives received
bonuses of more than $10 million two to three weeks before Drexel's
collapse, the Times reported.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder declined to comment on the size
of individual bonuses. The bonuses were determined last year and
were part of running the firm's business, the Times quoted Anreder
as saying.
   ``If we didn't have bonuses, we wouldn't have had anybody
working for us,'' he said.
   Representatives of Drexel's creditors told the Times they would
examine the bonus payments to determine if they could be recovered
as part of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.
   Creditors may face a hurdle in trying to recover any bonuses
because Drexel's securities subsidiary, which paid the bonuses,
wasn't covered by the parent firm's bankruptcy filing.
   Federal regulations prevent securities firms from filing for
bankruptcy. Nevertheless, Drexel's securities arm already has sold
most of its nearly $50 billion in securities and the operationg
will be liquidated as a result of the parent company's bankruptcy
filing, officials at the firm have said.
