<TEXT>
   President Turgut Ozal of Turkey said Tuesday
neighboring Iraq's military strength has been exaggerated and he
doesn't expect Iraq to invade either Saudi Arabia or Turkey.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein ``lost that chance'' to attack
his neighbors with the arrival of U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia, Ozal
told a National Press Club luncheon.
   Recalling that it took Iraq's army eight years to gain the upper
hand in its war against Iran, despite backing from the Soviet
Union, France and most of the West, Ozal asked, ``how can you call
that (Iraq) a strong army?''
   James Dobbins, deputy undersecretary of state for European and
Canadian affairs, said Ozal gave President Bush a similar
unflattering assessment of Iraqi military prowess.
   Dobbins said Ozal stated that public perception of Saddam's army
being one of the strongest in the world was ``simply an exaggerated
concern, that you're not dealing with the kinds of crises the
Western world has dealt with in the past ... I don't think he was
saying it'll be a runover.''
   At the National Press Club, Ozal said neither he nor Bush knew
how long it would take for the economic embargo and other sanctions
to force Saddam to retreat. His own view was ``maybe four-five
months, maybe later, we'll see.''
   Asked if he took seriously Saddam's threats to attack oilfields
in Saudi Arabia, Turkey and other neighboring countries resisting
Iraq, Ozal replied, ``I never thought he was going to attack
because I thought he was going to take Kuwait and stop there.'' If
Saddam had met no resistance he would stay in Kuwait, controlling
the oil of both Iraq and Kuwait and ``probably have a tremendous
effect on the rest of the Gulf. Ozal said.
   ``Why should he attack Saudi Arabia, why Turkey?'' he asked.
   Ozal dismissed as ``speculative'' a reporter's suggestion that
Turkey wants to repossess oil-rich Mosul province from Iraq after
the Gulf crisis. Although the Ottoman Empire considered it part of
Turkey, the League of Nations gave Mosul to British-ruled Iraq
after World War I ``and I think it's all over,'' he added.

   A 12-year-old girl slain outside a housing
project - the 16th child shot in New York City in two months - may
have been killed in revenge rather than at random, police said
Tuesday.
   Laykama Taylor, whose nickname was ``Sugar,'' spent her last
days in fear of retaliation for a street fight, neighbors told
police.
   ``They're going to shoot me. They're going to get me,'' Laykama
had told a friend who was interviewed by detectives, said a police
source told the Associated Press, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The young girl was fatally shot in the back Sunday afternoon as
she sat on a bench braiding a friend's hair outside a housing
project in the city borough of Brooklyn. Another young girl was
shot at the same project on Monday.
   In all, 16 children have been shot in New York City since July
22, police said. Laykama was the sixth to die.
   Police initially described Laykama's shooting as accidental, but
the Daily News on Tuesday quoted police saying revenge was the
motive. Detective Lt. Robert Ceccarini disputed that report
Tuesday.
   Laykama had argued with another 12-year-old girl on Thursday,
and older boys from both of the girls' families became involved in
the fight, police said.
   ``We do know there was prior disputes involving her and a
girlfriend, and they made up, and brothers got involved, pushing
and shoving,'' Ceccarini said. ``But as far as that being a motive,
we haven't uncovered that.''
   The young men involved in the fight were questioned by police
and remain suspects in the shooting, Ceccarini said.
   Laykama was shot from an upper floor or the roof of the project
as she sat in a courtyard filled with playing children. Detectives
were awaiting ballistics tests, but said they believed the killer
used a 9mm handgun.
   ``That wasn't a stray, that bullet was meant for her,'' said the
girl's aunt, Pee Taylor.
   As police investigated Laykama's shooting, a 13-year-old girl
was shot in the head Monday night while sitting on a bench in the
same housing project. She was hospitalized in stable condition.
   Earlier Sunday, a 15-year-old girl was shot in the leg as she
stood with a group of friends in Brooklyn. A 12-year-old girl was
shot Friday while playing in a Harlem playground.

<HEAD>Twenty-Six People Murdered At Ranch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Men firing submachine guns massacred 26
laborers at a ranch in western Colombia on Tuesday, an official in
a nearby town said.
   Twenty-four workers were rounded up, taken to a soccer field and
shot as they huddled together, an official in the town of
Candelaria said in a live broadcast interview with the radio chain
RCN.
   The town government spokesman, Jorge Ramirez, said in the
interview with the radio chain RCN that two peasants on a road near
the ranch were shot to death by the killers as they fled in three
vehicles.
   Witnesses said the killers wore uniforms like those of
Colombia's anti-narcotics police, RCN said.
   Both leftist guerrillas and right-wing death squads often
disguise themselves in police uniforms. A war between two drug
cartels in Colombia also has claimed more than 150 lives in the
last two years.
   There have been more than a dozen such massacres in the last
three years in Colombia. Investigations have shown that all were
the work of right-wing death squads.
   The federal attorney general's office has said that the death
squads are run by drug traffickers who own immense ranches. Leftist
guerrillas frequently try to extort money from ranchers.
   The death squads kill people they suspect of being guerrillas or
rebel sympathizers.
   The reported massacre was at a ranch just outside Candelaria,
about 225 miles west of the capital of Bogota. The town is in the
state of Valle.
   Policemen answering the telephone at the national police
headquarters in Bogota on Tuesday night referred all questions
about the reported massacre to the department's public affairs
office.
   The office as closed Tuesday night when the Associated Press
attempted to verify the report.

<HEAD>Lab Tests Don't Link Suspects to Five Slayings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crime laboratory results given to
police investigating five student slayings failed to link any of
several suspects to the killings, a newspaper reported.
   It's uncertain whether the test results received last week
actually cleared any suspects, or if they just failed to support
existing suspicions, The Gainesville Sun said in its Wednesday
editions.
   Police last week increased night patrols in the area where the
college students were slain.
   The newspaper quoted unidentified law enforcement sources as
saying the beefed-up patrols were ordered after an investigative
task force received the results of tests, and after the apparent
failure of intense searches of woods frequented by the Edward Lewis
Humphrey. Humphrey, an 18-year-old University of Florida freshman,
has been mentioned most often as a suspect, though police say they
have eight suspects in the case.
   The tests didn't link any of the eight to the crimes, the
newspaper said.
   Investigators have taken pubic hair and blood samples from
Humphrey and Stephen Michael Bates, 30, the only other suspect
whose name has been made public. Both are jailed on unrelated
charges and neither has been charged in the Gainesville murders.
   Tests were under way on semen, blood and a single pubic hair
found at one or more of the murder scenes and on a knife found in a
milk jug at Humphrey's home in Indialantic.
   Humphrey's public defender, J.R. Russo, told the Sun he didn't
know about any test results.
   Task force members refused to comment on lab tests or on what
the findings might mean about Humphrey's viability as a suspect,
the newspaper said. Associated Press attempts to reach task force
members for comment on the report weren't immediately successful.
   The nude, mutilated bodies of Sonja Larson, 18, and Christina
Powell, 17, were found Aug. 26 in their apartment near the
University of Florida campus. The next day, the decapitated body of
18-year-old Christa Hoyt was found in her apartment nearby.
   On Aug. 28, the bodies of Manuel Taboada and Tracy Paules, both
23, were found in an apartment they shared. All were students at
either the University of Florida or Santa Fe Community College.
   Humphrey is being held on $1 million bond in the Brevard County
Jail in Sharpes. He has been charged with the Aug. 30 beating of
his 79-year-old grandmother. Police have searched the woods near
his Gainesville apartment and have executed search warrants on his
residences and car.
   Bates, 30, who is being held in Polk County, is charged with a
burglary in which he woke a woman and her daughter and threatened
them with a knife.

   At age 25, the Pillsbury Doughboy is on a
roll.
   A new series of television ads show the pudgy figure playing
``air'' guitar, wailing on a harmonica, rapping and zipping around
on a skateboard.
   ``This is a guy having fun doing what he's doing,'' said Craig
Evanich, vice president of marketing in Minneapolis-based Pillsbury
Inc.'s prepared-dough division.
   But other than updating his song repertoire, the Doughboy, also
known as Poppin' Fresh, hasn't changed much since he first popped
out of a can of ready-to-bake dough in 1965.
   To celebrate the Doughboy's 25th birthday, the downtown
Pillsbury Center atrium will be transformed Thursday into
``Doughland.'' Entertainer Steve Allen will toast the Doughboy's
birthday.
   The Doughboy was created when an advertising executive
fantasized about what would pop out of a tube of refrigerated
dough.
   Ads show the white Doughboy as a kitchen helper.
   ``He's not an authority. He doesn't come in the kitchen and tell
people what to do,'' Evanich said.
   For the last 16 years, the Doughboy's voice has been provided by
JoBe Cerny, a Chicago-area actor. Cerny said he tries to infuse
some of his own personality into Poppin' Fresh.
   ``He's warm, cute and just a likable guy. My job is to try and
help keep him that way,'' Cerny said.
   Poppin' Fresh has become a part of pop culture. In 1972,
Playthings magazine named him ``Toy of the Year'' after Pillsbury
introduced a doll Doughboy, and in 1987, Advertising Age declared
him America's most-loved character.
   The Doughboy's elfish personality is like that of the magical
helpers of ancient myths, said Ellen Havre Weis, founder and
executive director of the Museum of Modern Mythology in San
Francisco.
   ``It's very symbolic of the home and hearth,'' Weis said. ``He's
dough brought to life.'

<HEAD>Guatemalan Refugees Struggle To Preserve Dream of Return</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   From their shabby camp on this
arid hillside, Guatemalan refugees can see the green hills of their
homeland. For eight years their dream of returning has been
nurtured like an ember.
   The dream has helped them survive the precarious life of the
camps and memories of the terror that drove them here. But, year
after year, the political violence of their homeland has eroded the
dream.
   They've been here so long that the Mexican government has
offered them permanent settlements. That puts the refugees in a
painful dilemma - whether to choose relative security in a foreign
land or the uncertainty and violence of their home.
   ``Everyone says they are going home someday,'' said Pablo
Farias, a psychiatrist who works with refugees.
   ``But after a while, you realize it is sort of a speech. When
you get past that, you start getting to the real sadness.''
   The people of Las Cieneguitas are among the tens of thousands
who fled in the early 1980s during Guatemala's ``scorched-earth''
campaign to wipe out a leftist insurgency and depopulate remote
northern war zones.
   ``We didn't want to leave our homes,'' said 55-year-old Ramiro
Velazquez de Arturo. ``But we didn't want to die.''
   About 46,000 refugees ended up in U.N.-supervised camps near the
border in Chiapas, Mexico's southernmost state.
   In 1984, they were offered permanent villages in two other
states - Campeche and Quintana Roo. More than half refused, despite
the prospect of jobs or land, of better housing and education.
   They chose to stay in miserable camps such as Las Cieneguitas, a
collection of rickety shacks without water or electricity, where
diseases such as typhoid are epidemic.
   ``Those who stayed in the camps are the ones who want to go
home. They have been keeping alive the hope,'' said Sister Lucia
Jimenez, a nun who has worked with the refugees for a decade.
   ``The whole meaning of who they are, of what has happened to
them, is linked to being a refugee,'' Farias said.
   The 23,000 exiles in Chiapas - most ff them Indians - are now
dispersed in 123 camps, some with only a handful of families. Las
Cieneguitas, with 1,600 people, is one of the largest.
   The refugees survive on international aid and what little day
labor they find. It isn't much. Chiapas is a poor state where
Mexicans fight Mexicans for land.
   ``There is intense competition for the natural resources. We are
piling up problems between the Mexican and refugee communities,''
warned Jorge Santistevan, regional representative of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees.
   Mexican officials recently proposed creating a handful of
villages with farmland and projects aimed at self-sufficiency
within a few years. Permanent residence and citizenship for
children born in Mexico would be part of the deal.
   ``It's a recognition that things aren't going to get better in
Guatemala and that these people won't be going home,'' said Victor
Osorio, spokesman for an umbrella group of 16 private refugee
assistance groups in Mexico City.
   Although they resisted resettlement in 1984, the refugees in
Chiapas are considering the proposal.
   ``It is interesting,'' said Ricardo Kurtz, a 26-year-old
Kanjobal Indian who serves on a refugee negotiating commission.
``It would mean better health services and education.''
   The commission on which Kurtz serves was elected in 1987 to hold
repatriation talks with Guatemala's government. It is a symbol of
the unity and political awareness the refugees found in exile.
   ``They are not the same people who left Guatemala,'' said
Santistevan, the U.N. representative. ``They are far more
sophisticated.''
   The commission has drawn up a brief list of conditions for
returning to Guatemala, including guarantees of safety and
restoration of land.
   ``For a campesino, the land is like your mother,'' Velazquez de
Arturo told a recent visitor here.
   The exiles, many of whom cannot read or write, keep close track
of events back home. Most camps have at least one shortwave radio
and broadcasts from Guatemala and the BBC are carefully monitored.
   The news is bad.
   There has been an upsurge in the kidnapping, torture and murder
of peasant, student, labor and human rights activists. The army
still occupies isolated areas, although the ``scorched-earth''
campaign has ended.
   Guatemala's weak civilian government has not been able to meet
the refugees' demands or gain their trust.
   The exiles are also shocked by the campaign now under way to
chose a successor to President Vinicio Cerezo, who took office in
1986 after decades of military rule.
   Efrain Rios Montt, a brigadier general who took power after a
1982 coup, is doing well in the polls despite a legal ruling that,
as a former dictator, he cannot serve as president.
   ``It's incredible that he would run,'' said Velazquez de Arturo.
``It was in his times that most of the massacres took place.''
   Velazquez de Arturo knows. His village suffered three army
massacres before the inhabitants fled en masse in 1982.
   He says he cannot forget burying the mutilated bodies of friends
and neighbors, the burned-out ruins of their homes. Almost everyone
in the camps lives with such memories.
   ``We have peace here, if nothing else,'' he said.
   Over the years, only a few thousand refugees have gone back to
Guatemala. Farias recalls one who committed suicide the night
before he was to return.
   ``Whatever way it goes for these people - deciding to go back or
deciding to assimilate - I think there is going to be a lot more
suffering,'' he said.
   ``The balance they have struck is very fragile.''

<HEAD>Isakson Facing Uphill Struggle in Quest for Governorship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DICK PETTYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Johnny Isakson is attacking Georgia's ``old boy''
network in a bid to become the state's first Republican governor
since Reconstruction, but he faces an uphill fight against Lt. Gov.
Zell Miller.
   Isakson, the state House minority leader, has accused Miller and
others of squandering tax dollars to build individual offices for
state legislators while leaving some schoolchildren to attend class
in trailers.
   Miller and his Democratic gubernatorial campaign branded
Isakson's ad ``an exercise in rank hypocrisy.'' Isakson has two
state offices and even voted for the budget that financed the
legislative office construction, Miller's statement said.
   Miller has been lieutenant governor for 16 years, but Isakson
isn't a newcomer to state government either. The prosperous Atlanta
real estate executive has been a state legislator since 1976.
   Miller is a former Marine rifle range instructor who talks tough
on drugs while promising a sales tax exemption for food.
   Isakson has a reputation as a solid, no-nonsense legislator, and
his contacts in the business community are counted as a plus.
   But Isakson must overcome the momentum Miller built during his
drive for the Democratic nomination and state voters' preference
for Democrats in top state offices.
   ``Without question, it's still Zell's to lose,'' said Atlanta
pollster Claibourne Darden.
   Isakson's media consultant, Robert Goodman, disagrees, saying
the Democrat is vulnerable.
   Miller has been running as ``a media candidate trying to pose as
the champion of change,'' said Goodman. ``But Zell Miller is part
of the old boy network, as you will see as the campaign evolves.''
   Miller has political ties to highway builders and other
interests and until this year used a lakeside lot leased from a
utility.
   Miller outnumbers Isakson 2-1 in staff and money. Political
consultant James Carville heads the Democrat's campaign, stressing
opposition research.
   ``It is hard for somebody to hit you when you have your fist in
their face,'' Carville has been quoted as saying.
   President Bush plans to host a $1,500-per-couple fundraiser for
Isakson, who had raised $2 million through July compared with $4.4
million for Miller.
   Miller swept away five Democratic primary challengers -
including Atlanta's former mayor, Andrew Young - by promising to
legalize state lotteries.
   Miller said his campaign emerged from the primary in good shape
and ``is as strong as garlic in a milkshake.''
   Isakson had little trouble dispatching three rivals to win the
GOP nomination, then took a back seat while Miller and Young fought
a runoff battle.
   Miller usually has allowed his aides to answer Isakson and has
been adept at focusing attention on his favorite issues, especially
his proposal for a state lottery.
   When the candidates appeared together at a forum before
educators, Miller stole the headlines by proposing that parents be
allowed to choose which public schools their children should
attend.
   State spending is a key issue for Isakson, who for years as
House Republican leader criticized Georgia's spending process as
lacking discipline and priorities. Often, the dissent fell on deaf
ears because the Republican minority had little legislative impact
on state government, and because of Isakson's penchant of attacking
with a barrage of statistics.
   This year, Democrats have served the issue to him on a platter.
Just a year after passing the biggest tax increase in state history
- a one-cent sales tax increase to finance prisons, schools and
health needs - the state must cut spending by $332 million because
of an economic slowdown.
   Isakson still employs some of his old techniques of responding
to the issue with detail, recently releasing a 13-page budget
policy statement. But he also has gotten media savvy in the age of
the 30-second sound bite.
   ``It's up to Johnny to use the old George Patton technique -
attack, attack, attack,'' said Darden. ``If Johnny doesn't, he's
gone ... He has to attack and show Zell is not the one to vote for
and - by default - Johnny is.''

   Barbara Bush dipped into Sidney Sheldon and
Scott Turow over the summer, took a fancy to television's
``America's Funniest Home Videos'' but was baffled by Bart Simpson
and his acid-tongued cartoon family.
   ``It was the dumbest thing I have ever seen, but it's a family
thing, and I guess it's clean,'' she said in an interview in the
Sept. 23 issue of People magazine.
   During her summer vacation in Kennebunkport, Maine, the first
lady said she found time to work out daily and catch up on her
reading, which included Sheldon's ``Memories of Midnight'' and
Turow's ``Burden of Proof.''

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Viveca Lindfors, who won an Emmy last week
for her portrayal of an aging dance teacher on the ABC series
``Life Goes On,' says good roles for older women are rare because
most movies are made by men.
   Male directors and producers don't want to cast older actresses,
said the 69-year-old Miss Lindfors.
   ``Why is it there are so many interesting parts for men, 60, 65,
70?'' she said in an interview Monday.
   ``Male actors keep working, and they get better and better and
more and more interesting. And why don't they allow women the same
thing? We get better, too, and we get more interesting.''
   Despite her complaints, Miss Lindfors has kept busy over the
years.
   In the film ``Misplaced,'' which opened Friday, she plays a
Polish immigrant. Other recent credits include ``The Exorcist III''
and ``Luba.''

   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Arnold Schwarzenegger went to the aid of an
injured motorcycle patrolman who was struck by a car.
   The brawny actor was in town to stress the importance of
physical fitness in his role as chairman of the President's Council
on Physical Fitness and Sports.
   Officer Ronald G. Knight, 36, was preparing to direct traffic
for Schwarzenegger when his motorcycle collided Monday with a car
driven by an elderly woman, police said.
   ``He comforted the officer and ensured that the proper medical
assistance reached him,'' said sheriff's Capt. Steven A. Davis.
   The officer suffered cuts and bruises, authorities said.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Fashion model Lesly Brown, the wife of
``Wheel of Fortune'' host Pat Sajak, has given birth to a boy.
   Patrick Michael James Sajak weighed 7 pounds at birth Saturday
at an undisclosed Los Angeles-area hospital, Sajak spokesman Bob
Burton said Monday.
   It was the couple's first child. Sajak, 43, and Miss Brown, 25,
were married in January.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Gilbert Cates, who produced the 1990 Oscar
telecast and directed such films as ``I Never Sang for My Father,''
has been named dean of the theater, film and TV school at the
University of California at Los Angeles.
   The UCLA school has about 100 faculty members and more than 900
students.
   The two-time president of the Directors Guild of America has
also produced or directed ``One Summer Love,'' ``The Promise,''
``The Last Married Couple in America,'' ``Oh, God! Book II'' and
``Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams.''

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Luther Campbell of the rap group 2 Live Crew
has agreed to stop using the name Luke Skyywalker and pay a
undisclosed amount to settle a $300 million lawsuit filed by George
Lucas' film company.
   The lawsuit, filed in March, said Campbell's use of the name
violated the copyright on the ``Star Wars'' movie character Luke
Skywalker.
   Campbell has already changed his record company's name from
Skyywalker Records to Luke Records.
   Lucasfilm attorney Charles Shephard announced the agreement
Monday.
   The ``Star Wars'' character is a clean-cut space warrior; the
rap group's album ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be,'' has been declared
obscene by a Florida judge, and members of the group have been
arrested on obscenity charges.
   Campbell attorney Howard Frumes said the agreement was made in
order to focus on the Florida case, ``where the issues are more
important.''

<TEXT>
   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) - ``Sorry for inconvenience caused
by the criminal acts of frenzied looters,'' reads the sign in the
window of the closed Hometown Pharmacy. ``We'll be back as soon as
possible.''
   The suburban drug store was among scores of businesses plundered
after Moslem militants stormed Parliament and the government-run TV
station on July 27 and took the prime minister and more than 50
others hostage.
   Nearly two months later, Trinidadians are still feeling
aftershocks of the six-day siege and accompanying looting that left
24 people dead and 500 wounded on this tiny nation of 1.2 million
inhabitants off the coast of Venezuela.
   The fighting delvered a shock to the ailing Trinidadian
economy, causing an estimated $60 million damage to the devastated
main shopping district of Port-of-Spain. Tourism, not surprisingly,
was also hurt.
   But there is a touch of irony in the fact that only hours after
rebel Yasin Abu Bakr and his followers surrendered Aug. 1, Iraq
invaded Kuwait, sending oil prices skyrocketing. Trinidad produces
just under 1 percent of the world's oil.
   The worst long-term damage may be to the nation's sense of
itself as a land of British-style democracy, multiracial harmony,
oil wealth, cricket and calypso.
   For Harmony Pharmacy owner Jeffrey Marchack, who lost his entire
inventory of $100,000 worth of drugs and merchandise, the episode
has meant a decision to install an iron grille in the front window
and a cashier's cage.
   Such security measures didn't seem necessary before, he said
nostalgically, because ``we were always known to be happy-go-lucky,
peace-loving people.''
   ``The myth of exceptionalism has been blown apart,'' said Selwyn
Ryan, a sociologist and political pollster at the University of the
West Indies. ``The myth that we're a nonviolent society is just
that - a myth.''
   Industry Minister Bhoe Tewarie said Bakr and his Jamaat
al-Muslimeen (Society of Moslems) were a ``group of extremists''
with no popular support. ``And I think Trinidad and Tobago proved
to the world that it is a very stable democracy that was threatened
but never shaken by the events of July 27.''
   But fearing that supporters of Bakr and 113 other jailed rebels
might be plotting another attack, the government has extended a
state of emergency until mid-November. The proclamation gives
security forces unrestricted rights of search and arrest.
   By day, the capital of Port-of-Spain once again teems with
shoppers, street vendors and clogged traffic. Residents are growing
tired of being restricted to their homes at night under a 9
p.m.-to-5 a.m. curfew.
   ``We cannot expect that their sense of humor, which as been
bearing up quite nicely until now, can be maintained for undefined
periods,'' the Trinidad Guardian said in an editorial urging an end
to the curfew.
   Police, usually armed only with billy clubs in this former
British colony, now patrol with automatic rifles. Soldiers wearing
berets and camouflage jungle fatigues guard the bullet-scarred
Parliament building and television station.
   The capital's major hotels are open, but with mostly empty
rooms.
   Bulldozers and dump trucks remove tons of rubble from the main
shopping district, where fires destroyed almost every building in a
two-square-block area.
   The government is offering business loans and planning to
redesign the district, which had become badly rundown.
   But rebuilding could take months, if not years.
   Industry Minister Tewarie insists the coup attempt would not
have any lasting affect the economy. Tourism was hurt in the short
term, he said, but the industry accounts for a tiny proportion of
the nation's wealth.
   Despite the boom in oil prices, Tewarie said, the government has
no plans to significantly increase production because it is wary of
increasing its dependence on oil income.
   Trinidad has been gripped by recession since oil prices
collapsed in 1983. Bakr, 48, a former policeman who converted to
Islam and drew followers mainly among poor urban blacks, blamed
Prime Minister Arthur N.R. Robinson for the widespread poverty that
resulted.
   Robinson, 64, was shot in the left leg after the takeover of
Parliament. He has returned to work and now walks with a cane.
   The prime minister, who had introduced wage freezes, spending
cuts and layoffs to revitalize the economy, had become highly
unpopular before the coup attempt. He remains in danger of losing
the next election, due next year.
   Bakr and his men face a string of charges, including murder and
treason, which carry the death penalty. A preliminary hearing was
to begin today in a converted gym.
   The FBI has charged an American Moslem, Louis Haneef of Pompano
Beach, Fla., with supplying assault rifles, ammunition and other
equipment to the coup leaders.

   Five years and $15 million ago, the federal
government issued its only official earthquake prediction: The
central California town of Parkfield would be severely shaken by
1993.
   Recent rumblings suggest the forecast soon may come true.
   ``They definitely elevate my belief that the earthquake is
likely to happen in the next few months,'' said Evelyn Roeloffs,
scientist in charge of the U.S. Geological Survey's Parkfield
earthquake prediction experiment.
   After a three-year lull, seismic activity increased during the
summer and particularly this month near tiny Parkfield. The town is
halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco in grassy, oak-dotted
ranchland of the Cholame Valley, which straddles the mighty San
Andreas Fault.
   It was in the valley that actor James Dean died in a 1955 car
crash.
   Moderate to strong quakes measuring 5.5 to 6.3 on the Richter
scale have ruptured a 20-mile-long section of the fault near
Parkfield roughly every 22 years since 1857. The most recent was in
1966. The quakes caused little damage in the valley, where about
200 people now live.
   The temblors' regularity prompted a 1985 Geological Survey
prediction that another magnitude-6 quake was 95 percent likely
during a 10-year period centered around January 1988, which meant
by no later than January 1993.
   The Parkfield prediction is the only one ever issued by the
federal government and ndorsed by California and federal
scientific panels.
   The Geological Survey has spent $15 million installing scores of
seismometers and other sensors and instruments near Parkfield,
making it ``the most heavily instrumented piece of fault in the
world,'' survey spokeswoman Pat Jorgenson said.
   Researchers hope the sensors will help them recognize changes in
the Earth in the months, days, hours and minutes before the
predicted magnitude-6 jolt, allowing them to issue a short-term
public warning.
   ``I'm not hoping to rain death and destruction on Parkfield, but
I'm hoping we can have the event we set up all this instrumentation
to catch,'' Roeloffs said by phone from Menlo Park.
   The predicted quake is not expected to cause significant damage,
said Richard Andrews, chief deputy director of California's Office
of Emergency Services.
   He said it could shake things off shelves and damage chimneys in
Parkfield and surrounding towns such as Paso Robles, Avenal,
Coalinga and Atascadero.
   The streams of scientists visiting Parkfield spurred rancher
Jack Varian's family to open the town's only cafe and start
building a four-room motel.
   A sign outside the restaurant says: ``Parkfield Cafe, Parkfield,
Calif. Earthquake Capital of the World. Be Here When it Happens.''
   Varian's 27-year-old son, John, is excited about the impending
quake, but ``I just want it to wait until March until the motel's
open.''
   ``I'll be darned if I'm going to hope for an earthquake,'' said
Parkfield School teacher Duane Hamann, who works part-time making
measurements for scientists. ``Things are going to fly all over the
place.''
   To help people protect themselves, the Geological Survey and
state officials established a warning system in which alerts are
triggered by various combinations of small quakes and other signs.
   The highest alert, known as ``level-A,'' will spur officials to
issue a public warning that the predicted quake is at least 37
percent likely within three days.
   Since 1986, there have been no level-A or B alerts, 22 level-C
alerts and 53 level-D alerts, Roeloffs said.
   The latest level-C alert - a warning that the quake is between 3
and 11 percent likely within three days - was issued Sept. 9.
Roeloffs said the alert was triggered by a magnitude-3.3 quake
north of Parkfield on Sept. 9 and an unusual rise in well water
levels.
   Another 3.3 quake rattled the area Sept. 10. The small quakes
were followed by numerous aftershocks, and by magnitude-2.2 quakes
Sept. 14 and 15.
   There also was a steady increase in magnitude-3 quakes all
summer farther northwest of Parkfield - a pattern Roeloffs called
``similar to the seismicity in the six months before the 1966
earthquake.''
   Geological Survey scientists have said there is a 2 percent to
10 percent chance the Parkfield quake could grow into or trigger a
major, magnitude-7 jolt.
   If that happened, Parkfield and surrounding towns might
experience considerable damage, especially to unreinforced brick
buildings, according state officials. Slight damage might occur as
far away as San Luis Obispo, Hollister, Bakersfield and Fresno.
   In 1857, a moderate Parkfield quake was followed within hours by
an earthquake exceeding magnitude 8 that ruptured a 200-mile
stretch of the San Andreas from south of Parkfield to the Los
Angeles area. Recent studies, however, show that is extremely
unlikely to happen after the next Parkfield quake.
   Other studies raise doubts about the Parkfield prediction.
   Previous Parkfield quakes around magnitude-6 happened in 1857,
1881, 1901, 1922, but then the pattern was broken with one in 1934,
10 years early. However, the next magnitude-6 quake waited until
1966, seeming to restore the original pattern.
   Geological Survey geophysicist Jim Savage argues that
uncertainty created by the timing of the 1934 quake means the
likelihood the Parkfield quake will happen by 1993 is only 60
percent.

   The Metropolitan Opera opened its season with
Puccini's much-loved, melodic ``La Boheme,'' starring Mirella Freni
and Placido Domingo.
   Both were magnificent in the leading roles.
   With Mrs. George Bush, Prince Rainier and his son Prince Albert
in the State Box, the evening began with the audience standing for
an orchestral piece unfamiliar to most of them, the national anthem
of Monaco, where Rainier is head of state. That was followed by
``The Star Spangled Banner.''
   Usually Met artistic director James Levine conducts on opening
night, but Monday night Christian Badea held the baton. He took the
important duets and arias of the fourth act slower than usual. That
made them especially gentle and poignant.
   The slower tempo began with Rodolfo (Domingo) ad Marcello
(Brian Schnexnayder) lamenting the loss of their girlfriends. It
continued with Colline (Julien Robbins) saying goodbye to the
overcoat he's about to sell, and the final duet of Rodolfo and Mimi
(Miss Freni).
   Miss Freni, who made her Met debut as Mimi in the first week of
the 1965-66 season, is amazing. She sounded incredibly young at the
beginning of the opera and, with her small waist, looked young.
Unlike some singers who only sound good singing loud, her voice is
even more lovely when she's singing quietly and sweetly, as she did
all through Act 4, on Mimi's deathbed.
   Domingo was fine, though a couple of times he slipped from his
best voice. He was charming, blowing out his candle so that he and
Mimi are together in the dark, then shrugging, as seen in the
follow spotlight. He and Miss Freni conveyed that there was a
chemistry between them. Near the end of Act 1, when they're
supposed to kiss, a big smack was heard.
   Baritone Richard Cowan, a native of Euclid, Ohio, graduate of
Indiana University and winner of several vocal prizes, made a
sterling Met debut as Schaunard, the fourth bohemian roommate in a
Paris garret. Cowan sang Schaunard in a recent ``La Boheme'' film
and will sing the title role of ``Don Giovanni'' at the Met in
October.
   All the bohemians sounded young and strong. Schnexnayder was
especially impressive. Barbara Daniels sang Musetta well but
performed the part as though doing a Zsa Zsa Gabor imitation.
   Franco Zeffirelli's production, from 1981, has held up well. The
attic room is shown to be tiny by having the roof of the building
it's above much bigger and sloping toward the audience. It looks as
though the Met still has 218 people walking around Paris' Latin
Quarter at the beginning of Act 2.
   Mrs. Bush's gown was red, with long sleeves and a bodice shot
with gold threads. With it, she wore a triple strand of pearls. The
formally dressed audience chose, in general, to be attractively and
conservatively dressed this year.
   A champagne supper on the Grand Tier of the Met followed for 650
guests who paid $1,250 each. Performance tickets ranged from $35 to
$500.

   President Bush will veto any attempt by
Congress to postpone the $85 billion in Gramm-Rudman spending cuts
that loom next week unless a budget deal is reached, White House
officials said Monday.
   The compromise remained elusive because of a dispute over
whether to slash the capital gains tax rate. The Bush
administration insisted it would not agree to higher income tax
rates on the wealthy, a demand Democrats were making in exchange
for the capital gains tax reduction.
   As the standoff continued, the specter of massive cuts in
federal spending grew nearer and the administration promised to let
them take effect without a budget deal.
   ``We're T-minus seven,'' said presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater, referring to the number of days before the slashes
occur. ``We're sticking with it and still talking.''
   Administration officials and congressional leaders held an
evening meeting that lasted until nearly 12:30 a.m. Tuesday, trying
to work out a five-year, $500 billion deficit-reduction package.
With the new fiscal year beginning next Monday, the two sides
remain locked in a budget stalemate that has persisted all year.
   ``We're making progress in cutting spending, but we're not there
yet,'' White House chief of staff John Sununu said after the
session.
   Negotiators continued to reveal little about the details of
their closed-door discussions. The principal hangup remained a
dispute over a reduction in the capital gains tax rate, which Bush
wants and Democrats oppose.
   Currently, capital gains - gains from the sale of assets, such
as corporate stock or houses - are taxed just like ordinary income.
   White House budget chief Richard Darman said the administration
would continue to oppose higher income tax rates on the wealthy.
   ``We're not shifting our position on anything,'' he said. ``Why
should we?''
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., had said Sunday that
Republicans were looking for a tax boost on the wealthy that
Democrats would accept in exchange for a capital gains tax
reduction. It was unclear whether he meant to include higher tax
rates on the rich, a position GOP bargainers have fought all year.
   Frustration with the stalled budget talks caused debate on every
bill brought to the House floor Monday to deteriorate into an
argument over which party was to blame for the budget impasse.
   A day intended for action on 37 non-controversial bills became
one of parliamentary delays by Republicans, angry because a vote on
the budget had not been scheduled on this week's calendar.
Democrats said a vote couldn't be scheduled on a bill that didn't
exist.
   ``This place is in total disarray,'' said Rep. Gerald Solomon,
R-N.Y.
   Oct. 1 is the day the Gramm-Rudman law will automatically impose
$85 billion in cuts in the $1.2 trillion federal budget, an amount
that would hobble many federal programs.
   It's also the day the government will run out of money because
the budget gridlock has blocked all spending bills.
   Democratic congressional leaders planned to begin moving
legislation through the House on Tuesday, temporarily providing
financing to the government.
   House Speaker Thmas S. Foley, D-Wash., said if a budget
compromise is reached, the legislation would also delay the
Gramm-Rudman spending reductions. The postponement is expected to
last through Oct. 20 to give lawmakers a chance to enact the budget
into law.
   But Foley cautioned that without a budget pact, the House might
not try to delay the Gramm-Rudman slashes.
   ``If there is no agreement, we will have a different
condition,'' Foley told reporters. ``We don't have any policy at
the moment that isn't directed toward an agreement.''
   Even if the House measure failed to delay the Gramm-Rudman cuts,
the Senate could add the provision later in the week.
   By sending Bush a measure temporarily rolling back the automatic
cuts, Democrats would put the president in the position of having
to decide whether to hold off on the cuts slashes - and perhaps
taking the blame for them.
   White House officials reasoned that by refusing to put off the
Gramm-Rudman reductions, they could pressure negotiators to work
out a deal.
   ``If you get into the business of suspending and suspending and
suspending ... we'll be at it for 114 years,'' said Darman, one of
the bargainers.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Overall, it's been a pretty good year for dry,
edible beans, says the Agriculture Department.
   Department bean counters always refer to them as dry and edible
to distinguish the pintos, navies and small reds from green beans,
which aren't dry, and castor beans, which aren't edible.
   As of Sept. 1, total dry, edible bean production is expected to
be 31.4 million hundredweight, the most since the record 1981
harvest of 32.8 million hundredweight.
   Heat and drought conditions took a toll during the summer in the
northern Great Plains, or 1990 output would probably have exceeded
the old peak.
   Even so, prospects for this year's bean harvest are much
improved from 1989's harvest of 24.3 million hundredweight and the
drought-riddled 1988 production of 19.3 million.
   Catherine R. Greene of the department's Economic Research
Service said recent industry reports show ``excellent growth
conditions'' for much of the 1990 bean crop. Exceptions, she said,
include drought areas of the northern plains and California.
   Greene said Monday in a telephone interview that the aggregate
prices of dry beans in the 1990-91 marketing year are expected to
decline because of the larger harvest and a buildup in bean
inventories.
   In 1989-90, the season average price at the farm was about $28
per hundredweight, or 28 cents per pound. During the summer, farm
prices rose to record levels, averaging nearly $33 per
hundredweight.
   Greene did not make any new price predictions but noted that her
agency's most recent projection showed that bean prices might
tumble to less than $20 per hundredweight over the 1990-91 season.
   ``Dry beans have been up for a long time,'' she said.
   According to USDA analysts, the harvested acreage jumped 26
percent from last year to about 2.1 million acres, with North
Dakota accounting for about half of the increase.
   North Dakota production, which is mostly pinto and navy beans,
was indicated in September at 5.4 million hundredweight, compared
with 2.46 million in 1989 and 2.7 million in 1988.
   Another big dry bean producer is Michigan, with production
estimated at 5.25 million hundredweight, compared with 4.5 million
last year and 2.14 million in 1988.
   Nebraska, ranked third, is expected to produce nearly 4.66
million hundredweight, up from less than 3.5 million in 1989 and
3.76 million in 1988.
   Other commercial dry bean producers include California,
Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, New Mexico, New York,
Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - An experimental oral vaccine to control
coccidiosis, a parasitic disease of chickens, is being tested by
the Agriculture Department.
   So far, says microbiologist Mark C. Jenkins of the department
Agricultural Research Service, the vaccine appears ``virtually 100
percent effective'' in protecting young chickens against the
disease.
   Jenkins, who heads the research team at the agency's protozoan
diseases laboratory in Beltsville, Md., said none of the 200
chickens orally vaccinated became ill when exposed to the coccidial
parasite.
   The vaccine consists mainly of a preparation made from an
ineffective stage of the parasite that has been bombarded with
x-rays, making the organism sterile so it can't reproduce. But it
is still alive and can penetrate a chicken's intestines.
   ``Our theory is that when the chickens are fed the sterilized
coccidial parasite, they react by producing antibodies and immune
cells,'' Jenkins said in a report released Monday. ``This protects
them from infection when exposed to disease-causing parasites.''
   Coccidiosis costs U.S. poultry farmers more than $300 million a
year in lost weight gain and medication, he said. Most infected
birds usually look healthy, but the parasite prevents them from
absorbing nutrients from the gut, causing ``a sort of slow
starvation.''
   Scientists said the vaccine, although promising, is still a few
years from practical use. It will require at least another year of
laboratory testing and then extensive field studies to make sure it
is effective in large commercial flocks.
   Most poultry farmers now control coccidiosis by medicating the
feed. But the parasites often develop resistance to the drugs, and
new medications have to be developed.
   ---
   WASHINGTON (AP) - U.S. farm exports are expected to drop next
year as foreign production competes with sales of grain and other
products, the Agriculture Department reports.
   The department's Economic Research Service said Monday that a
drop in corn exports in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 will
help lead the overall decline.
   ``U.S. corn exports are expected to fall 7 million tons (more
than 275 million bushels) as overseas customers replace U.S. corn
with competitors' feed wheat,'' the report said. ``Wheat prices are
expected to average lower in 1990-91 due to larger crops. But
higher soybean prices will help offset some of this decline.''
   Overall farm exports in the current year are estimated at about
148.5 million metric tons worth about $40 billion, both up slightly
from 1988-89.
   The report did not include any figures to show U.S. export
values and volume in 1990-91. The department's first official
export estimates for next year will be issued in late November.

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jordan is wounded and its leaders are
confused and unable to understand what they see as an acrimonious
campaign against a tiny kingdom struggling to survive in peace.
   ``We feel that since the Americans and the Europeans and the
allies of the United States for that matter cannot punish Iraq,
what they are trying to do is punish Jordan. We don't know the
reason behind it,'' said Deputy Foreign Minister Mutasem Bilbeisi.
   Western diplomats contend privately that Jordan has not done
enough to condemn Iraq for its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. But they
agree the punishment does not fit the crime.
   Jordan's already faltering economy has been driven to its knees
by the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Perhaps Jordan was slow to adhere to the embargo, but the world
has been slower still with the aid Jordan needs to survive, the
country's leaders say.
   ``You cannot deny the fact that we could have made billions if
we wanted to out of this crisis,'' Bilbeisi said in an interview.
   Jordan would only have to violate the sanctions and continue to
deal with Iraq, a country that accounted for about 40 percent of
Jordan's trade, he said.
   ``I don't like to insinuate anything but there were monies thatwwere
easy to obtain under the table. Jordan could have done it, we
could have solved all our economic problems if we had taken a
position contrary to our position.''
   ``But at what expense?'' Bilbeisi asked. ``I don't think the
government is going to defy the whole world and break the
sanctions.''
   Bilbeisi and other Jordanian officials, speaking on condition
they not be identified, try to portray Jordan as a voice of reason
in a world gone mad.
   Like the United States, Jordan has called for Iraq to withdraw
from Kuwait and for a restoration of the emir.
   But it also has tried to prevent the deployment of foreign
troops in a region with bitter memories of colonalism and foreign
domination.
   King Hussein has tried to slow the steady march toward war by
seeking to negotiate an Arab solution to the crisis.
   But Western diplomats contend his efforts are unrealistic, that
none of the proposals meet even the minimum requirements of the
U.N. Security Council resolutions seeking to force Iraq to
relinquish Kuwait.
   ``The main principles inherent in any of these (peace) proposals
would be the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait and the return
of a legitimate government to Kuwait,'' said Bilbeisi.
   ``But whether this meets with the resolutions of the Security
Council or not is beside the point because we think some of the
resolutions of the Security Council are detrimental to any peace
effort because they are so tight,'' said Bilbeisi.
   He said the word ``unconditional'' in U.N. resolutions makes
peace efforts more difficult.
   Iraq and Kuwait had a border dispute even before the invasion.
Jordan is recommending that an Iraqi withdrawal to the line of
dispute, rather than the pre-attack border, would be a good
starting point for negotiations.
   ``Let's be pragmatic. He (Saddam Hussein) went to war to protect
his interests in those oil fields,'' said Bilbeisi.
   ``If we convince the man to withdraw to that point of dispute
and then if we can manage or can arrange negotiations between
Kuwaitis and Iraqis and if the Kuwaitis agree to a new boundary
between them then I don't think any country will object to this,''
he said.
   But diplomats, echoing the comments of British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, argue that King Hussein ``failed the first test
of principles'' by not publicly condemning Iraq.
   The king has said only that he opposes the acquisition of
territory by force.
   ``Our position is that we cannot condemn and mediate at the same
time,'' said Bilbeisi.
   Popular support for Iraq is overwhelming in Jordan. Bilbeisi and
others argue that the king could not possibly take a harder stance
or send troops to join a multinational force in Saudi Arabia.
   Jordanian officials argue it is easy for a Pacific Ocean state
or one in middle Europe to comply fully with the U.N. sanctions on
trade with Iraq.
   But they say it is something else for Jordan, which has no firm
guarantees of foreign aid and stands to lose $2 billion this year
alone because of the crisis. No one objected to Jordan's relations
with Iraq when its neighbor was fighting Iran and seen as a
deterrent to the spread of Islamic fundamentalism in the region,
the officials say.
   Bilbeisi also claimed that some in other countries were doing
more to help Iraq but not being subjected to the same condemnation.
   He said: ``Most of the smuggling in the world now is taking
place between Turkey and Iraq, between Iran and Iraq and you'll be
surprised that the best business of smuggling now going on is
between Syria and Iraq,'' the Arab world's bitterest rivals.

   A House panel approved a cut of 77,000 people
from the armed forces, conceding that a more significant reduction
would be unwise while President Bush continues to send troops to
the Persian Gulf.
   Meeting behind closed doors Monday, the House Appropriations
subcommittee on defense adopted the troop cut as part of its
defense spending plan for fiscal 1991, said a panel member who
requested anonymity. The lawmaker did not specify how many people
each service would lose.
   Nearly 2.1 million people are on active duty.
   The subcommittee is expected to finish work this week on its
$296 billion version of the military appropriations bill for the
fiscal year beginning next Monday.
   The panel's action came as the United States continues to send
forces to the gulf region to stop Iraqi aggression against its
neighbors. President Bush has called more than 21,000 reservists to
active duty in the crisis.
   The subcommittee's troop reduction is far less than the 129,500
cut set by the House last week when it approved a $283 billion
defense authorization bill. The authorization bill sets spending
ceilings; actual funds must be provided in separate appropriations
bills.
   The lawmaker said a higher troop cut was considered
inappropriate in light of the circumstances in the gulf region.
   The reduction of 129,500 in the authorization bill includes
68,500 from the Army, 36,500 from the Air Force, 20,000 from the
Navy and 4,500 from the Marine Corps.
   During debate on the authorization bill, a Republican effort to
cap the troop cut at about 100,000 while eliminating additional
funds for the F-A-18 aircraft failed.
   President Bush, in proposing a $307 billion defense
authorization budget and $303 billion in defense appropriations for
the coming fiscal year, sought a troop cut of 38,000.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said he would recommend that Bush
veto the authorization bill because of the hefty reduction in
troops and the major cuts in strategic weapons, including the B-2
stealth bomber and the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   The Senate, which approved a $289 billion defense appropriations
bill last month, adopted a 100,000 cut in U.S. troop strength in
fiscal 1991, including 50,000 in Europe.

<HEAD>Losses Seen Leveling Off at S&amp;Ls, But Another Slide Feared</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Losses seem to have leveled out at the
nation's privately run savings institutions, but analysts say the
spread of weak real estate markets could produce another slide.
   The 2,437 S&amp;Ls outside government control lost $196 million in
the April-June period, the Office of Thrift Supervision said
Monday.
   That was a modest improvement over the $219 million loss in the
first three months of the year. It also was a dramatic gain over
the $720 million loss in the last three months of 1989 but a
substantial deterioration from the $308 million profit earned by
the same institutions a year earlier.
   ``It's very difficult to predict that the trend of reduced
losses in the industry will continue or that the industry as a
whole will become profitable this year,'' thrift office Director
Timothy Ryan said.
   He noted a ``real disparity'' in thrift performance
geographically. Thrifts in the Pacific Northwest and in the upper
Midwest continue to be profitable, largely because these areas have
so far escaped the real estate downturn experienced in the
Southwest and, more recently, the Northeast.
   Private analysts, however, offered an unreservedly bleak
assessment of the industry's prospects.
   ``It's fairly clear the real estate correction process is
becoming national,'' said Richard C. Aspinwell, vice president of
Chase Manhattan Bank and a member of a private academic group, the
Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee.
   ``There's not a lot on the horizon to suggest we have turned the
corner,'' said University of North Carolina professor Robert A.
Eisenbeis, another member of the group.
   The second-quarter results did not include losses at the 247
failed but still-operating institutions under the control of the
federal Resolution Trust Corp. They are to be reported separately
later this week.
   They also did not include 15 institutions that had been rescued
close to the end of the quarter by the RTC, which was created last
year to manage the government's bailout.
   Also, the losses are being held down by government subsidy
payments to 61 thrifts bailed out in 1988 by the now-defunct
Federal Home Loan Bank Board. Excluding results from those
institutions, private-sector S&amp;Ls lost $315 million in the
April-June period.
   While avoiding forecasting future industry performance, Ryan
said the recent decline in losses shows that the program of seizing
failed institutions is helping solvent thrifts by reining in
competitors.
   ``The one thing we have seen is ... moving these institutions
into the RTC tends to provide opportunities for the rest of the
industry,'' he said.
   An analysis by the thrift office, which divides S&amp;Ls among four
groups based on their financial health, shows that 1,169 healthy
institutions have earned consistent profits over the last 18
months: $646 million in the second quarter of 1990, $641 million in
the first quarter and $582 million in the second quarter of 1989.
   However, in a worrisome sign, the performance of the next group
- 674 weak institutions that were nevertheless expected to survive
- deteriorated. Those institutions earned $31 million in the
April-June period, compared with $195 million in the previous
quarter and $296 million a year earlier.
   An additional 350 thrifts in danger of failing lost $153 million
last quarter, compared with a $332 million loss in the first
quarter and a $217 million loss a year earlier.
   And 244 S&amp;Ls considered all but certain to fail lost $720
million last quarter, compared with $723 million in the first
quarter and $353 million a year ago. Included among the 244 were 13
S&amp;Ls that had been bailed out by the thrift office's predecessor,
the bank board.

<HEAD>Notes from the Undercount: Census Coordinators Compare Woes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city of Chicago thinks the Census Bureau
has overlooked more than 300,000 of its denizens.
   Charleston, S.C., contends the bureau miscounted the number of
housing units on almost 40 percent of its blocks.
   Houston says its housing vacancy rate is about 10 percent - not
the 14.5 percent claimed by the agency.
   These and other complaints were voiced Monday by a group of city
census coordinators who met to map a strategy to force the federal
government to correct what they say is a drastic undercount.
   Ed Kobilarcik, a Census Bureau spokesman, said more than 8,300
governments have responded to the preliminary census results so
far. Of those, he said about 80 percent have challenged the
government's count.
   ``The census people, as honestly as I can put it - they blew
it,'' said Tom Kelly, coordinator from Highland Park, Mich.
   Kelly said that at first the Census Bureau thought Highland Park
was a Detroit neighborhood, not an independent city.
   ``I knew we were in trouble when all the Highland Park census
forms said Detroit,'' he added. ``We had to negotiate just to get
on the map.''
   Eleanor Tevnan, coordinator for Elizabeth, N.J., said the
bureau's preliminary count showed a 2.3 percent population increase
since 1980, making it the only major city in the Garden State to
post a gain.
   ``We still believe we have an undercount, despite that,'' she
said.
   The officials came from cities as small as Meridian, Miss., and
as large as Los Angeles. But all 21 cities represented have filed
challenges to the Census Bureau's preliminary population estimates.
   They are driven by the fact that the greater their population,
the more federal aid they will receive. Population also determines
how many representatives they will have in Congress.
   Kobilarcik defended his agency's work, saying, ``We don't feel
that it's been a disaster. We think we've had a very successful
census.''
   The bureau plans to respond to the governments in November, he
said.
   Census Director Barbara Everitt Bryant has already told Congress
there will be big changes in the initial numbers.
   ``The census count will increase in practically every
jurisdiction throughout the country because of ongoing coverage
improvement programs,'' she said.
   At Monday's meeting, each coordinator had a collection of
complaints about census procedures in his or her city.
   Barbara Kaplan of Philadelphia told how the Census Bureau missed
about 500 housing units in the four-block neighborhood of
Rittenhouse Square, for example.
   Hulbert James, New York City's census coordinator, said the
bureau cited a 54,000-pupil decrease in school enrollment as
evidence of the city's shrinking population. That decrease was
primarily due to students dropping out of high school, not people
moving away, he said.
   James called on the group to form a national coalition for
census correction to show a united front to the federal government.
   And Lance Simmens, who directed the meeting for the National
Conference of Mayors, said mayors would be invited to join an
``attack team'' charged with publicizing these problems. The team
will be led by New York Mayor David N. Dinkins and Meridian, Miss.,
Mayor Jimmy Kemp.
   Simmens also outlined three tracks cities will take to force the
federal government to correct its figures. Cities will try to
influence the administration directly, he said, noting that
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher has agreed to a meeting next
week with the conference.
   The conference is also pursuing legislation and a federal
lawsuit.

<HEAD>Angolans May Get Food Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials hope an international food
relief effort can get under way in Angola within the next 30 to 60
days to prevent widespread starvation.
   ``The crisis is upon us and we must act now,'' said Andrew
Natsios, head of the U.S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance.
   Angolan officials have committed themselves to a U.N. plan that
would permit emergency food deliveries from third countries.
   The leftist government had been worried that the United States
might use food deliveries to send weapons to the anti-communist
UNITA rebels.
   Natsios was snubbed by Angolan officials two weeks ago during a
visit to Luanda, the capital. They had a change of heart last week
and agreed in a communique to allow ``the prompt and efficient
delivery'' of food supplies to tens of thousands of Angolans who
face starvation because of drought.
   On Monday, Natsios made public the joint Angola-U.S. communique
he worked out with Gen. Antonio Dos Santos Ndalu. The talks were
secret and Natsios declined to say where they were held.
   Angola agreed to allow food deliveries to the hungry in both
government-and rebel-held territory.
   Angolan officials have said that up to 2 million people live in
the drought-affected area. UNITA spokesmen have said the number of
hungry Angolans could be as high as 750,000. The U.S. estimate is
that as many as 250,000 Angolans are at ``immediate risk of
starvation.''
   Natsios told reporters Monday he saw the effects of the drought
during a visit to Angola that began about two weeks ago. At one
location, he saw children who had eaten only two or three meals in
a week. At another, there were children who had only mice to eat in
the preceding days, he said.
   ``The U.N. plan must be implemented immediately,'' Natsios said.
He added that he is hopeful the international community will
respond generously to Angola's plight.
   A U.S. official, insisting on anonymity, said the Angolan
government may be showing flexibility on the aid issue in order to
influence pending congressional deliberations about future aid to
UNITA.
   The Angolan government strongly opposes such aid, which the
United States has been providing to UNITA since 1986. The civil war
has raged since 1975.
   The Namibian government agreed last week to allow food shipments
to be sent to Angola through its territory. Another possibility is
Zimbabwe, where there is a food surplus, Natsios said.

<HEAD>Candidate Says He Didn't File Returns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Democratic candidate for office in the
nation's capital says he deliberately failed to file federal or
local income taxes for several years, according to a published
report today.
   Charles J. Moreland, who is seeking to become the District of
Columbia's ``shadow'' representative in the House, told The
Washington Post he hasn't filed federal income tax returns for at
least five years and city returns for the past three years.
   The ``shadow'' House seat Moreland hopes to fill is actually an
unpaid advocate to lobby Congress for statehood for the city, and
Moreland says his non-filing was meant to draw attention to the
statehood issue.
   Moreland, who is the second candidate for citywide office to
acknowledge failure to file taxes, was quoted as saying he believes
his actions ``put me in a better position to achieve the goal of
statehood. We have to confront the system.''
   Eleanor Holmes Norton, who became the Democratic nominee for the
city's delegate to Congress, was plagued in the last week of her
primary campaign by disclosures that she and her husband had not
filed city income tax returns for seven years from 1982-1989.
   The couple subsequently paid the city more than $88,000 in back
taxes, interest and penalties.

<HEAD>Judiciary Committee's Swing Votes Announce Support for Souter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All three swing votes on the Senate Judiciary
Committee say they favor Judge David Souter's nomination to the
Supreme Court.
   Sens. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., and Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.,
announced Monday they would vote for the 51-year-old New Hampshire
jurist when the committee meets Thursday.
   Three years ago, Heflin and DeConcini, the committee's most
conservative Democrats, and the committee's most moderate
Republican, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., all came out against
President Reagan's nomination of Judge Robert Bork, who went on to
defeat.
   Now all three are supporting Souter. Specter announced his
support last week.
   In voicing his approval on Monday, Heflin said he saw in Souter
an ``endearing quality of being willing to listen, to be fair and
impartial.''
   He made clear Souter left a far different impression than that
made by Bork, who was seen by many as too dogmatically
conservative.
   ``Judge Souter will not bring a scorched-earth philosophy to the
court, but he will bring a sense of historic perspective and a
clearheaded approach to the analysis of legal issues,'' said
Heflin, a chief justice in Alabama before joining the Senate.
   ``He has not chosen to turn back the clock on the great
constitutional principles of our day,'' said DeConcini, turning
around some of the rhetoric used against Bork.
   So far, seven of the committee's 14 members have endorsed
Souter. Six of the eight Democrats and one of the six Republicans
have not yet stated their positions.
   No committee member has announced opposition to Souter, and only
one member of the entire Senate, Alan Cranston, D-Calif., has said
he would vote against confirmation.
   Cranston explained in a speech to the Senate on Monday that he
could not abide Souter's refusal to say whether he would vote to
overturn Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that
legalized abortion.
   ``I cannot support a nominee who refuses to acknowledge that a
woman's right to choose to terminate a pregnancy is a fundamental
right,'' Cranston said Monday.
   ``To me, the right of privacy in matters relating to family life
and procreation goes to the very essence of the liberty and freedom
from government control that Americans deeply cherish,'' Cranston
said.
   The large number of undecided Senate liberals appeared to be a
reflection of divisions within the national liberal community.
   Over the weekend, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, an
influential coalition of rights groups, called for the Senate to
reject Souter.
   ``We do not believe that David Souter has demonstrated that he
has a commitment to constitutional guarantees of individual rights
and liberties,'' the group said. It cited as ``astonishing''
Souter's statement during the committee's hearings that his home
state of New Hampshire does not have racial problems.
   But in its statement, the group listed members of its coalition
that specifically declined to be included in opposing Souter. Those
included the American Civil Liberties Union, several Jewish groups,
the League of Women Voters, People for the American Way and the
U.S. Catholic Conference.

   South African President F.W. de Klerk's
official visit to Washington is stirring protests from
anti-apartheid activists, but some black members of Congress are
joining colleagues to meet with him today.
   ``Our view is that (de Klerk) has not earned a trip to the Oval
Office,'' Randall Robinson, head of the TransAfrica group that has
led U.S. protests against apartheid, said Monday.
   ``President Bush has made a large mistake and has offended
freedom-loving people around the world and in the United States by
becoming the first president since apartheid was codified in 1948
to invite into the Oval Office the head of a country that practices
repression in an unprecedented way,'' Robinson said.
   Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., chairman of the Congressional Black
Caucus, said the 24-member group canceled its plans to meet with de
Klerk out of concern the session would be misinterpreted and could
lend symbolic support to the apartheid regime. Dellums joined
Robinson and other activists outside the White House gates to
protest Bush's meeting with de Klerk on Monday.
   But Dellums said he would join congressional foreign affairs
committee members in a large session with de Klerk today. And House
Majority Whip Bill Gray, D-Pa., the highest-ranking black in
Congress, planned to join House Speaker Thomas Foley and other
congressional leaders in a smaller session with the South African
leader.
   ``Many of us will raise questions that need to be raised in that
forum,'' Dellums said.
   ``We decided we would do it within the context of the Congress
as an institution,'' he said. ``To meet with the Congressional
Black Caucus separate and apart bestows a level of credibility that
at this point we weren't prepared to deal with.''
   De Klerk had sought the meeting with Dellums' caucus, but the
lawmaker canceled it over the weekend after Robinson attacked
Bush's plan to meet with the South African president.
   The change of mind reflects the black community's difficulty in
dealing with de Klerk's visit, said Milton Morris, director of
research for the Joint Center on Political Studies, a black think
tank.
   While de Klerk is a symbol of the racist apartheid system,
Morris said, he has brought change and black leaders may be able to
influence further change by meeting with him. He noted de Klerk
released African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela from
prison.
   ``I think it would have been a good opportunity to indicate some
satisfction at the general direction of change in South Africa,''
Morris said. ``Change has obviously been dramatic, and has been in
the right direction. ... One needs to take note of that.
   ``It is ironic that Mr. Mandela, whom we respect a great deal,
is in almost daily negotiation with Mr. de Klerk, who has been more
forthcoming than any other white South African, and here we are
boycotting Mr. de Klerk,'' Morris said. ``...There are strong
pressures for a united front on this. The fact they got off on
separate directions simply underscores the difficulty of the
situation.''
   NAACP Executive Director Dr. Benjamin L. Hooks said he supported
TransAfrica's protest of de Klerk's visit to the White House. He
said that while de Klerk has taken positive steps toward
establishment of a democratic society, the basic foundation of
apartheid remains in place.
   ``Until this is dismantled, we believe a visit to the White
House by South Africa's chief executive is totally inappropriate,''
Hooks said.

<HEAD>Pentagon Reports Drop in Soviet Military Spending, Arms Production</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet military spending and arms production
fell last year, and the Kremlin leadership is developing a military
strategy with more emphasis on defending the homeland and less on
``external adventurism,'' the Pentagon said today.
   The Defense Department's annual report on the Soviet military,
entitled ``Soviet Military Power 1990,'' described the Soviet Union
as a nation so entangled in internal unrest that its military
capabilities are hard to assess.
   ``Much that was once certain about the Soviet military is now
open to debate,'' Defense Secretary Dick Cheney wrote in the
publication's introductory essay. ``It is not clear how that debate
will be resolved.''
   Cheney said U.S. intelligence analysts believe Soviet military
spending fell 4 percent to 5 percent last year compared with 1989,
and that it cut back on some aput.
   The most pronounced cuts in arms production were in ground
forces materiel, the report said. Tank production, for example, was
cut in half, to about 1,700 tanks in 1989. Smaller but significant
cuts occurred in artillery and multiple rocket launcher output.
   The Soviets produced strategic, or long-range, offensive missile
systems in 1989 at about the same pace as the year before, the
report said. Production of bombers, fighters and fighter-bombers
declined by an unspecified amount, while production of surface
warships and submarines rose to 21 from 18 the year before.
   Cheney, in his essay, cautioned that despite some signs of a
less threatening Soviet military stance, the nation still has its
nuclear missiles aimed at the United States.
   ``All evidence indicates that this fact will not change,''
Cheney wrote. ``Furthermore, the threat is no longer clear cut; the
implications of change within the Soviet Union are not completely
known.''
   While the Pentagon report stressed that the Soviets still
possess a formidable arsenal of nuclear weapons capable of
destroying the United States, the publication was filled with
passages expressing hope for lasting change.
   Included were pictures of Soviet intermediate-range nuclear
missiles being destroyed in accordance with the 1987 INF treaty,
and of Soviet M-4 Bison long-range bombers with their tail sections
severed, making them unusable.
   The report said the Soviet economic crisis and a host of
internal political problems ``are bringing the Soviet Union to the
brink of economic breakdown and potential internal chaos.''
   ``As a result, the Soviets are developing a policy and strategy
that is oriented toward defense of the USSR and away from external
adventurism,'' it said.

   This is a quiz to see how you stack up against
1,139 other people who were surveyed about their survival skills as
consumers.
   Question: Mr. and Mrs. O'Brien sign a one-year lease for an
apartment at $400 a month but change their minds and never move in.
Legally, they owe the landlord: $400, $800, $1,200 or $4,800?
   If you said $4,800, you are among the 52 percent who answered
the question correctly.
   The discouraging thing about this, according to the Consumer
Federation of America, is the 48 percent who didn't have the right
answer.
   Question: Which of the following drugs can cause drowsiness and
therefore should not be taken before driving: Aspirin,
antihistamines, antacids or laxatives?
   Right, it's antihistamines. You are among the 79 percent who got
that right.
   Question: When a check bounces, who, if anyone, is usually
charged a fee?
   The multiple choices are: a. the check writer only; b. the
person to whom the check is written only; c. Both the check writer
and the person to whom the check is written; and d. neither the
check writer nor the person to whom the check is written.
   Only 29 percent got the answer, which was `c.'
   The Consumer Federation of America said Monday that it put these
and 246 other questions to 1,139 people in shopping centers in
seven states and found only 54 percent of its questions were
answered correctly. Five tests were given, each with 50 questions.
   ``Many consumers are not equipped to function competently in the
marketplace,'' said Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the
federation.
   The questions asked about definitions, the most efficient way to
buy goods and services, the use of household products and drugs and
solving problems related to products.
   The test results send ``a clear and acutely troubling message,''
said Michael Van Buskirk of TRW Foundation, which paid for the
study conducted by the Educational Testing Service.
   ``The test shows that those in the lower rungs of the economic
ladder are further disadvantaged in their attempts to climb up
because of their consumer skills,'' he said. ``The public and
private sectors have expended extraordinary resources in the name
of consumer protection and education but those tests give those
efforts a failing grade.''
   Scores were low on housing purchases, checking and savings
programs, food purchases and life insurance. Consumers were more
knowledgeable about drugs and housing rental.
   For instance, 87 percent knew the significance of co-signing a
loan; 78 percent knew the relation of salt consumption to high
blood pressure; 79 percent the relationship between use of
antihistamines and drowsiness; and 76 percent knew the meaning of a
full warranty.
   Brobeck said the less educated, the poor, the young and
minorities all scored less than 50 percent on the test, even though
a person could answer about 25 percent correctly just by guessing.
   Consumers were found to be knowledgeable in some areas,
automobiles for instance.
   Two in three of those questioned knew that comprehensive
insurance - rather than collision, liability or uninsured motorist
coverage - would pay for a replacement of a stolen car.
   Brobeck said the consumer federation, which represents 240
nonprofit groups with 50 million members, would meet with the White
House consumer office, top federal officials, educators and
business leaders to discuss the implications of the findings.
   There will be an effort, too, to beef up high school
instructions in consumer affairs. So that more than 38 percent can
correctly answer questions like this:
   ``Which deposit account usually plays the most interest?
Certificate of deposit, money market account, NOW account or
passbook savings account.''
   The answer, of course, is the CD.

   South African President F. W. de Klerk is
seeking to convince congressional leaders that he is serious about
his commitment to establish a non-racial system in his country.
   De Klerk planned meetings this morning with Senate leaders and,
after an appearance at the National Press Club, a visit with House
members.
   Part of de Klerk's mission is to persuade Americans that his
goal of dismantling apartheid is irreversible. But some black
activists said they are not yet convinced.
   The 24-member Congressional Black Caucus canceled a meeting it
had scheduled with de Klerk because it feared the session could be
misinterpreted.
   After de Klerk's meeting Monday with President Bush, Randall
Robinson, head of the TransAfrica anti-apartheid group, said the
two leaders' meeting sent a ``false and dangerous message'' that
South Africa is on its way to change.
   De Klerk, meanwhile, assured Bush that the process of democratic
reform cannot be reversed.
   ``We will not turn back,'' he said, promising a new system in
which all South Africans will have a ``vote of equal value.''
   Bush, in turn, hailed the ``dramatic progress'' away from
apartheid rule in South Africa.
   ``Clearly, the time has come to encourage and assist the
emerging new South Africa,'' Bush said after his 2{ hour session
with de Klerk.
   Behind the leaders, a black Marine held the flag of South Africa
and a white Marine held the American flag.
   It was just a year ago that de Klerk assumed the South African
presidency, a time when U.S.-South African relations were still
frosty because of the negligible progress toward ending white rule.
   Bush remarked on how far South Africa has come under de Klerk's
tutelage.
   ``Who among us, only a year ago, would have anticipated these
remarkable developments,'' Bush said.
   De Klerk has overseen the lifting of bans on democratic
political parties and the release of African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela, among other prisoners.
   Still, South Africa has not met the requirements for lifting
U.S. economic sanctions, which were imposed by Congress four years
ago over President Reagan's veto.
   U.S. officials said South Africa still must lift emergency rule
in Natal Province and release the remaining political prisoners
before the sanctions may be suspended.
   Later, Foreign Minister Pik Botha said Bush's characterization
of the dismantling of apartheid as irreversible should help
persuade European governments to lift sanctions. He said he
understood the difficulty in changing U.S. sanctions written into
law by Congress.
   ``We are aware of the sensitivities constraining the U.S.
administration and we are not here to ask the U.S. to do anything
about it at this stage,'' Botha said.
   The Congressional Black Caucus remains skeptical about de
Klerk's promises. Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., caucus chairman,
explained the decision not to meet with de Klerk, saying, ``To meet
with the caucus separate and apart bestows a level of credibility
that at this point we are not prepared to deal with.''
   But Dellums and other black members of the House were to be
among the lawmakers meeting with de Klerk this afternoon.

   While budget negotiators burned the midnight
oil, idling Bush administration limousines burned gasoline -
despite the president's pleas to the country to conserve energy.
   The limousines waiting to take White House Chief of Staff John
Sununu and budget chief Richard Darman from the Capitol after the
nearly four-hour session broke up past midnight this morning were
parked - their engines running for at least a large part of the
meeting.
   Darman had arrived on Capitol Hill at about 8:30 p.m., while
Sununu appeared about a half-hour later. The two men departed
shortly before 12:30 a.m., Darman in a Lincoln Towncar and Sununu
in a Chrysler New Yorker.
   Spot checks at about 11 p.m. and again at 12:15 a.m. revealed
that both vehicles, parked on Capitol grounds, were idling. Drivers
lounged in each car, apparently with heaters running to break the
chill of the fall night.
   A third automobile, a Lincoln Towncar used by Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady, was not running.
   Bush has made occasional calls for energy conservation in light
of the Persian Gulf crisis. He was criticized for repeatedly using
a gasoline-guzzling motorboat during his August vacation in
Kennebunkport, Me.

<HEAD>Hayden Wins Endorsement on Abortion Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Mike Hayden of Kansas has won the
endorsement of the president of the National Organization for
Women, who said she is abandoning the group's historical alliance
with women and Democrats.
   NOW president Molly Yard said at a news conference that Hayden's
support of abortion rights makes him more deserving of support than
Joan Finney, the Democratic nominee who opposes abortion rights.
   ``I do not know how anybody who is pro-choice can support Joan
Finney - no matter how Democrat you are. Nobody is more Democrat
than me,'' Ms. Yard said Sunday. Yard's endorsement was a personal
one and did not represent an endorsement by the women's group.
   Hayden was endorsed by abortion opponents in 1986, but his wife
said in a weekend interview in The Kansas City Star that he had
never sought the endorsement. Patti Hayden said in the interview
that she had an influence on Hayden, who calls himself an abortion
rights advocate.

Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican gubernatorial hopeful John
Engler is accusing Gov. James Blanchard's administration of
awarding contracts in exchange for campaign contributions.
   Engler on Monday asked Attorney General Frank Kelley to appoint
a non-partisan assistant attorney general to investigate any
linkage between individuals who have been awarded state contracts
and political donations.
   ``I believe in instances there have been'' contracts awarded in
exchange for political campaign contributions, Engler said at a
news conference.
   Blanchard administration officials called Engler's charges
ridiculous.
   ``Absolutely not,'' there is no linkage between contracts and
contributions, said Shelby Solomon, director of the state Office of
Management and Budget.
   The basis of Engler's charge was a series of stories in The
Detroit News. The newspaper said it found contracts totaling $183.5
million over the last three years have gone to people who gave
$114,000 to the governor's campaign and officeholder expense
accounts.

<HEAD>Durenberger To Raise Money In Advance of Possible 1994 Race</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sen. Dave Durenberger says he plans to get an
early start on fundraising for the 1994 election even though he
hasn't decided to seek another term.
   The decision will be based on ``whether I can make a
difference,'' the Minnesota Republican said in an interview
published in this week's issue of National Journal.
   Democrats called for Durenberger to resign after he was
denounced by the Senate this summer for financial misconduct, which
included the laundering of speaking fees and improper payments for
his Minneapolis condominium.
   Steve Moore, a spokesman for Durenberger, confirmed the accuracy
of the magazine interview. He said the senator was not available
for another interview.
   Durenberger's campaign treasury went into the red this year
after he dipped into it to help pay nearly $500,000 in legal fees.

<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hispanic leaders are overjoyed with President
Bush's pledge to improve federal efforts to promote quality
education for Hispanic Americans.
   Bush, flanked by Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos and Interior
Secretary Manuel Lujan, used a ceremony Monday marking National
Hispanic Heritage Month, Sept. 15-Oct. 15, to issue an executive
order on educational excellence for one of the fastest growing
minorities in America.
   Stressing ``too many Hispanic Americans are not getting the
first-rate education they need and deserve,'' Bush said the
executive order sets up an advisory committee to keep the education
secretary abreast of ways to improve federal educational efforts.
   The order, an outgrowth of an Hispanic task force report, also
directs Cabinet agencies to work along with individuals and
educational, business and community groups serving Hispanic
Americans to increase participation rates of Hispanics in federal
education programs.
   Cavazos called the order ``a demonstration of (Bush's) thorough
commitment to bringing Hispanics into the mainstream of American
life through education.''
   ``The president's intent in this policy is to improve education
for all children who face obstacles in the education system,'' he
said.
   Lisa Navarre, spokeswoman for the National Council of La Raza,
said officials are encouraged by the order because the research and
advocacy group, along with the Hispanic Association of Colleges and
Universities, had been working for nearly two years to win a
commitment from the administration.
   ``On a political and general level, this is a very significant
and symbolic act,'' said Navarrete. ``It shows an interest in the
federal government to do something about the crisis in Hispanic
education.''
   Antonio Rigual, president of the higher education group, said,
``We think that over the next six to 12 months, we will see how the
executive order translate itself into programs that begin to
address the needs of Hispanics.
   ``Our opinion has always been that our federal government has
really turned its back on Hispanic students. But (the order) begins
now to really position Hispanic education institutions and
Hispanics in general to make special gains,'' he said.
   The nation's Hispanic population reached 20.1 million in March
1989, a 39 percent increase over 1980.
   The president noted that in five years, Hispanics will make up
more than half the high school population in some major cities,
such as Los Angeles. Within 10 years, he said, 12 percent of all
school children will be Hispanic.
   The National Council of La Raza said Hispanics continue to have
the highest school dropout rates of any major group. About 43
percent of Hispanics age 19 or over have no high school diploma and
are not enrolled in school.
   ``We must find new strategies to boost graduation and literacy
rates - strategies that really do get the job done, strategies that
really work,'' said Bush.
   ``We must figure out how to help these young people, how to
equip them with the tool to enter a nation in a world where
technology advances so rapidly that literacy and analytical and
technical skills are not luxuries but essentials.''
   In other federal initiatives, the president said:
   -Cavazos will work with governors from key states, enrolling
large number of students in migrant education programs to develop
criteria for a high school diploma for migrant students.
   -Federal education programs will intensify efforts to increase
language development among preschool children. Head Start will
provide general guidance, he said.
   -The Education Department will increase emphasis on early
education programs under the Bilingual Education Act to achieve
English proficiency for preschool children lacking those skills.
   The order acts upon recommendations from a special Hispanic task
force formed within the president's Domestic Policy Council. With
Cavazos as the chairman, the task force held public hearings on
Hispanic education in San Antonio, Boston, Miami, Chicago and Los
Angeles.

<HEAD>New Tracing Center Tracks Victims of Holocaust</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEB RIECHMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Using newly released Soviet documents on
400,000 of Hitler's victims, a new Red Cross clearinghouse is
offering to help people track the fates of loved ones sent to labor
or death camps by the Nazis.
   The center opened here Monday to process a flood of expected
requests for access to the records in West Germany that the Soviets
began releasing last year. Soviet soldiers recovered the documents
when the camps were liberated at the close of World War II.
   Emmy Hubert Mogilensky, the daughter of Holocaust victims, said
at the opening of the Holocaust and War Victims Tracing and
Information Center that she sympathizes with relatives who still
don't know the fate of loved ones.
   The 67-year-old woman said she grieved with her brother when the
Red Cross sent them a message in 1946 saying their parents died in
a Nazi concentration camp.As time passed, she said the letter
became a ``comfort, a closure.''
   ``For us, the questions were finally answered and we could go on
with our lives,'' said Mogilensky, who was invited to speak at the
opening.
   Millions of people, mostly Jews, were sent to labor and death
camps under Hitler. An estimated 6 million Jews were killed.
   The Soviet papers include nearly 70,000 death certificates from
the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland. Also included are the
names of 130,000 prisoners used for forced labor and 200,000
victims in other camps, including Dachau, Sachsenhausen, Gross
Rosen and Buchenwald.
   ``The pain of not knowing where they were. If they were murdered
in the camp. Did they die in the cattle cars on the way to the
camp? It haunts you. It does not let you rest,'' Mogilensky said.
``Can you imagine after 45 years still wondering, still not
knowing?''
   Copies of the Soviet documents are housed at the International
Tracing Service in Arolsen, West Germany, a branch of the Central
Tracing Agency of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
   To use the Baltimore center, people can contact local American
Red Cross chapters to obtain inquiry forms. Caseworkers send the
completed forms to Baltimore, where they are translated into German
and forwarded to Arolsen.
   Center volunteers will provide progress reports so people don't
think their requests have been forgotten.
   Diane Paul, program director of the Central Maryland Red Cross,
said certifying a Holocaust victim's fate can take months. The
research is complex, involving cross-referencing with other lists,
she said. It is further complicated by the various spellings of
names and possible inaccuracies in the records.
   ``For example, the name Schwartz can be spelled 156 different
ways, and there are 400,000 persons filed under this name alone,''
Paul said.
   Western allies released concentration camp documents soon after
World War II. But Soviet authorities had kept the records sealed
despite repeated requests.
   There are 46 million documents already on file in Arolsen
covering 13 million people. Over 44 years, the center has responded
to 1.8 million people searching for information about missing
relatives.
   ``These people, their children, their brothers, their sisters,
their cousins, aunts and uncles were no longer able to give voice
to say, `Here I am,''' said Alfred Himmelrick Jr., a Baltimore
businessman who went to see the records in Germany on a liaison
mission for the new tracing center.
   ``It was then that the 13 million people on file became real,
not abstract.''

<HEAD>Senate Passes Bill Protecting Older Workers' Benefits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate has approved legislation bringing
older workers' job benefits under the protective umbrella of the
Age Discrimination in Employment Act.
   The bill, sent to the House Monday on a 94-1 vote, is aimed at
reversing the effects of a Supreme Court decision which held that
employee benefits were not covered by the 1967 civil rights law.
   Only Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, voted against the measure.
   ``This one Supreme Court ruling opened the door wide for
potential discrimination in older workers' health, disability, life
insurance and severance benefits,'' said Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa.
   ``It did so by threatening or permitting the use of deferred
compensation in the form of pension benefits to be converted to an
unintended and counterproductive use,'' Heinz said. ``The Supreme
Court decision sanctions discrimination in benefits solely on the
basis of a worker's age, without regard to who the worker is or
what he contributes to the work force.''
   The bill puts the Senate on record as saying it intended the
1967 law to prohibit arbitrary discrimination against older
employees in the administration of benefit programs - unless
separate treatment of workers on the basis of age could be
justified.

   The Justice Department is accusing the
Maryland lottery of bias against white men because it set aside
several top positions for women and minorities in 1983.
   The civil rights suit filed Monday alleged that Maryland and its
lottery agency violated Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act by
refusing to hire qualified white males for the four positions set
aside for minorities in 1983.
   The lawsuit was denounced by a state official as an unwarranted
attack on a one-time effort by Maryland to recruit more minorities
into the lottery agency.
   Two black men, a black woman and a white women were recruited
``in response to a Maryland Human Relations Commission
investigation and determination that the lottery agency was not
doing enough to meet affirmative action requirements,'' said Dennis
Sweeney, deputy state attorney general.

<HEAD>EPA Releases Cancer Estimates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People who regularly eat fish taken from
streams near pulp and paper mills that discharge dioxin run a
increased risk of developing cancer, says the Environmental
Protection Agency.
   The EPA made public Monday the results of a study showing that
dioxin concentrations in fish downstream from 19 such mills ``may
be high enough to pose an increased cancer risk greater than one in
10,000'' to average consumers of fish caught there.
   ``The estimated cancer risk is potentially higher for avid
sports fishermen and subsistence level fishermen because their
consumption of fish is generally higher than that of average
consumers,'' the EPA said.
   The EPA said its risk estimates are based on the consumption of
fish - such as catfish, bass, suckers and squaw fish - that spend
their entire lives near a paper mill and accumulate greater
concentrations of dioxin in their tissues.
   The risk estimates do not apply to migratory fish, such as
salmon, that spend only a short portion of their lives in the
contaminated waters.
   The one-in-10,000 estimate is an upper bound. Any actual risk,
if present, could be lower. The agency generally tries to act
against risks this large, and treats smaller risks with less
concern.
   The average risk in the United States of dying of cancer from
any source is about one in five.

   Federal health officials are collaborating
with several hundred physicians in the United States and Canada to
gather more information about the progression of the infection that
leads to AIDS.
   The study will give medical researchers a better picture of
which symptoms and diseases are most common in different groups of
patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV,
which causes AIDS, officials said in announcing the study Monday.
   It also will provide information on what treatments patients are
using and will help researchers identify medical changes that occur
as HIV infection progresses towards acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   The study will allow researchers to compile a data base on a
broad spectrum of HIV patients and will help physicians identify
patients who can participate in clinical trials of experimental
drugs, officials said.
   More than 30 community-based clinics and programs in the United
States and Canada will participate in the study. They include 18
sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases and 15 sponsored by the American Foundation for AIDS
Research.
   Several hundred physicians will be able to enroll patients they
see at these clinics and programs, as well as patients they see in
their private practices. These physicians care for more than 60,000
HIV-infected patients, according to the research foundation.

<TEXT>
   Early returns from a United Auto Workers vote
this week on a national contract with General Motors Corp. show the
agreement is headed for overwhelming approval.
   The union's 300,000 workers in 29 states were expected to ratify
the tentative agreement reached a week ago that guarantees full
income for laid-off workers. The voting ends Sunday.
   The union plans to use the three-year contract as a pattern for
agreements with Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.
   At GM's Arlington, Texas, assembly plant, with about 3,000
workers, Local 276 President David Perdue said Monday that
production workers voted 98 percent and skilled trades workers
voted 94 percent to accept the contract.
   ``There really weren't that many concerns,'' he said.
``Everybody for the most part is pretty happy.''
   Locals in Bedford, Ind., with about 1,200 workers, and
Baltimore, with about 3,100 workers, also voted overwhelmingly to
ratify the pact.
   Meanwhile, Ford of Canada workers went back to work Monday after
ratifying a new contract following a week-long strike. The shutdown
halted work in all nine factories operated by the Ford subsidiary.
   Company officials said the walkout did not disrupt U.S. Ford
factories or sales as feared.
   The GM contract includes a $4 billion commitment to guarantee
the income of workers who are laid off more than nine months. It
also maintains a program to hire one new worker for every two who
quit, retire or die.
   In addition, the contract provides for a 3 percent raise in the
first year and lump sum payments in the second and third years of 3
percent. Cost of living adjustments were retained.

<DATELINE>AZRAQ I TRANSIT CAMP, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time, large
numbers of children are joining the seven-week-old exodus from Iraq
and Kuwait.
   About one-third of the estimated 15,000 refugees who've arrived
daily at Jordan's desert transit camps since Saturday are children,
relief workers say.
   Some are just weeks old and many are suffering from heat
exhaustion after their long journeys through the desert and from
the lack of milk at the camps.
   ``We've no experience of this. More and more and more families
have begun arriving over the last few days, replacing the bachelors
we had before,'' said Red Cross relief coordinator Stefane Spang.
``It's a whole new problem.''
   About eight small children sat with 20 adults Monday inside a
sweltering green military tent, coated with yellow dust swirling in
clouds off the desert.
   They sweated and swatted flies. The adults fanned the children.
   ``My father said we can go after some days, but I'd like to go
now,'' said Shayam Lal, a 6-year-old Indian whose sober gaze made
him seem far older.
   ``We've reached too far away from Kuwait to go back, but this
place is too far from India,'' he said.
   About 30,000 people are in the transit camps of Azraq I and II.
Workers with the International Committee of the Red Cross said
there was not enough milk or disposable diapers.
   Spang, in Amman, said 1,100 gallons of milk would be delivered
to the camp today. But he did not know how long it would last
because it was unclear how many children are languishing in the
camps.
   Shayam Lal's father Agith Lal, a former bank clerk in Kuwait,
said his family came on a bus two days ago with 33 adults and 15
children, including four infants.
   Shayam sat beside his father and brother and read a dog-eared
comic book. He said it was too hot to go outside and play.
   ``I'd rather be in school,'' he said. ``I miss my friends.''
   But Shayam probably won't see his classmates in Kuwait again,
and his father fears that if the trip home takes too long, his son
may get home too late to enroll in school.
   ``Education is critical,'' Lal said. ``When the Iraqis took our
things, I didn't mind too much. But taking a year of school from my
son makes makes me very, very angry.''
   The refugee families, mostly Indian, said they remained in
Kuwait despite the Iraqi invasion after seeing reports on Kuwaiti
television of the appalling conditions in the first makeshift
transit camps at the Iraq-Jordan border.
   The newcomers said they decided to leave occupied Kuwait, where
life is getting increasingly difficult, after seeing Iraqi TV
footage of the new camps.
   In the Azraq I transit camp, trucks drive between the tents
distributing rice, tomatoes, apples, cucumbers and sometimes canned
fish.
   A Red Cross official said that with the huge increase in the
number of children, relief workers hope to increase protein in the
daily ration.
   The refugees stay in the transit camps for an average of four
days before leaving Jordan for India aboard specially chartered
aircraft.
   The evacuation has been running fairly smoothly for the last two
weeks. But there are still more people entering Jordan than leaving
it, and the population at the Azraq camps has been gradually
rising.

<TEXT>
   Honda will install air bags in all its
1994 cars, joining a growing list of automakers that plan to offer
the safety devices as standard equipment.
   Nobuhiko Kawamoto, president and chief executive officer of
Honda Motor Co., said Monday that air bags for drivers and
front-seat passengers will replace automatic seat belts.
   Chrysler Corp. equips all its U.S.-made cars with driver-side
air bags, but cars it receives from other companies, notably
Mitsubishi Motors Corp., lack the devices.
   General Motors Corp. said it will expand use of driver and
passenger side air bags to all of its domestically designed cars
for the 1996 model year.
   Ford Motor Co. said by the mid-1990s it will equip all of its
cars with driver- and passenger-side air bags.
   Under federal law, all cars made in the United States after
Sept. 1 must have either an air bag or automatic seat belt for
drivers and front-seat passengers.
   Kawamoto, on his first U.S. tour as head of Honda, would not
predict how many Honda and Acura cars the company will sell in the
United States by the time air bags became standard equipment.
   Through the first eight months of this year, Honda sold 593,508
cars, up 11.2 percent from the same time last year.

<HEAD>Some Equipment for U.S. Military Comes from East German Army</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About half the military aid pledged by
West Germany for U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf will be in the
form of East Germany military hardware, the chief government
spokesman says.
   The spokesman, Hans Klein, has also denied a news report that
Washington was angry about the decision to include the East German
equipment.
   He said officials would fulfill Chancellor Helmut Kohl's pledge
of ``modern equipment.''
   Pressed by Washington, Kohl last week promised about $2 billion
in aid for the U.S. government and poor nations hurt by the
suspension of trade with Iraq. The government set direct military
aid at about $1 billion.
   Klein told reporters Monday that about $470 million worth of
military equipment for the U.S. forces would be East German
military hardware.
   Parts of the East Germany military will be integrated into the
West German army when the two Germanys unite on Oct. 3. Other units
are being disbanded.
   West German military officials are still debating what to do
with Soviet-made East German military equipment they will inherit.
   Klein said U.S. officials were aware that some of the military
equipment for the U.S. forces would come from East Germany. He said
there were no complaints from the U.S. side.
   However, the West German newsmagazine Der Spiegel said in its
latest issue that Washington was angry about the East German
military equipment.
   Defense Ministry spokesman Max Reichert told reporters that
Soviet-built MiG-29 combat aircraft owned by the East German air
force are not part of the deliveries.
   Most of the equipment consists of tracked vehicles, water
tankers, trucks, radio equipment and similar hardware. No weapons
systems are involved.
   West Germany has already started delivering advanced Fuchs
vehicles that can detect chemical weapons. The vehicle is
manufactured in West Germany, and 60 of them are to be deployed in
Saudi Arabia.

   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 418.51
points, or 1.76 percent, ending the day at 23,359.32, its lowest
close since Jan. 27, 1988, when it ended trading at 23,335.91. The
index shed 174.85 points on Friday.
   Trading was thin, with only 230 million shares changing hands in
the first section.
   Meanwhile, the dollar closed at 136.70 yen, down 0.63 yen from
Friday's 137.33-yen finish. The currency opened at 136.75 yen and
ranged between 136.40 yen and 137.00 yen.
   In bond dealings, the yield of benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 8.675 percent by 4:00 p.m. from
Friday's 8.600-percent finish. The price fell to 80.79 from 81.09.
   On Monday, Tokyo financial markets were closed for a national
holiday.
   Stock traders said the Nikkei's plunge was largely due a sudden
surge in oil prices as well as a sharp decline in the Dow Jones
industrial average in New York.
   Tomoya Kohda, a trader with New Japan Securities Co., said the
index quickly fell due to index-linked large-scale selling in
reaction to the surge in oil prices.
   ``Although index-buying by a few foreign securities houses
narrowed the Nikkei's losses, the rise in oil prices largely
discouraged investors,'' he said.
   ``Fear of inflation is quickly growing in the market,'' Kohda
said.
   Convinced that an extensive war with Iraq is inevitable and
probably imminent, oil traders drove crude oil prices on several
world spot markets to a peak of about $40 a barrel Monday.
   Tuesday morning in Tokyo, West Texas Intermediate crude oil for
November delivery was sold at $38.71 a barrel, 46 cents higher than
its counterpart on the New York Mercantile Exchange. North Sea
Brent crude for November delivery was valued at about $38.80 per
barrel. Oil prices were more than $3 higher than last week's
closing figures.
   In currency dealings, trading lagged after the opening as
investors retreated to the sidelines to avoid risks before the end
of the first half of Japan's fiscal year, dealers said. The first
half of fiscal 1990 for most Japanese companies ends Friday.
Beginning Thursday, foreign exchange transactions will be settled
in the second half of the fiscal year.

<HEAD>Famed Jesuit Priest and China Watcher Dies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Lazlo Ladany, a Hungarian-born Jesuit
who ran the world's oldest journal of China-watching from a student
hostel at the University of Hong Kong, has died of lung cancer. He
was 76.
   Ladany, a trained violinist and lawyer, died Sunday at Canossa
Hospital, where he had been undergoing treatment for the last
month.
   He was born in Budapest on Jan. 14, 1914 and entered the Jesuit
order in Hungary when he was 22. Three years later, he was sent to
China to preach. For the next nine years, Ladany lived in Shanghai
and Beijing, studying Chinese.
   The revolution of 1949 forced Ladany and other Jesuits to flee
China. The victorious Communist Party cracked down hard on Roman
Catholics, executing thousands and forcing Chinese priests to break
all ties with the Vatican.
   Ladany arrived in the British colony of Hong Kong and began
publishing China News Analysis in 1953. It became his life work and
made him famous on university campuses and in embassies on both
sides of the Iron Curtain.
   Operating out of a small room in a student hostel at the
University of Hong Kong, Ladany would monitor news broadcasts from
almost every Chinese province.
   His gleanings from the broadcasts opened a window on China for
many, which was off-limits to most Western journalists at the time.
   In addition to engaging in the highly speculative tea leaf
reading of Chinese politics, Ladany's newsletters also gave a feel
for life in China.
   One newsletter during the Cultural Revolution was devoted to a
prissy Shanghai teen-ager who, like millions of others her age, was
sent to a commune to labor with peasants.
   She and other city girls were appalled at the poverty of their
peasant comrades and failed at gardening because they couldn't
bring themselves to spread human feces, the only fertilizer
available, near their house.
   Ultimately, she bribed the village headman with rubber shoes and
other treats from Shanghai and escaped to Hong Kong, where Ladany
interviewed her.
   The newsletter devoted a lot of coverage to hogs, China's main
source of meat and an important fertilizer source.
   Under the heading Pigs, the issues were spiced with barnyard
humor, such as Chairman Mao Tse-tung's statement that ``every pig
is a small fertilizer factory,'' and that China should push for a
``one man-one pig'' agricultural policy.
   ``China could very well exist without missiles or bombs,''
Ladany once said. ``It could not exist without pigs.''
   In another newsletter, Ladany was one of the first to report
that prostitution had returned to China.
   He also came close to predicting the fall of China's Gang of
Four, who along with the Mao, led China during the Cultural
Revolution of 1966-76.
   At the end of 1982, Ladany turned China News Analysis over to a
new editorial team which resumed publication on Jan. 1, 1984.
   He remained a close watcher of China and was a persistent
skeptic of China's reformers, especially Deng Xiaoping.

<HEAD>Council Refuses to Revive Tuition Tax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The City Council failed to revive the
nation's first tax on college tuition but voted to seek other ways
of raising extra money from Northwestern University and three other
colleges in this Chicago suburb.
   The council, in a 10-8 vote Monday, fell two votes short of
overriding Mayor Joan Barr's veto of a tuition tax of up to $60 a
year on students at Northwestern, Kendall College, Garrett
Evangelical Theological Seminary and Seabury-Western Theological
Seminary.
   ``The people who are opposed are always joined together on
anything the city administration wants,'' said Alderman Jack
Korshak, who proposed the tax.
   The tax would have generated an estimated $500,000 a year toward
the city's budget, which totaled $77.3 million in 1990-91,
officials said.
   The measure, adopted on Sept. 10, centered on Northwestern's
unwillingness to pay the city for police and fire protection. The
university has its own security force but occasionally asks for
assistance from Evanston police.
   Evanston schools are exempt from property taxes, and the measure
was intende to give tax relief to homeowners who saw higher bills
in this community of 73,000 because of reassessment last year.
   The council also voted 15-3 Monday to establish a three-member
committee to look for ways to increase the amount of money
Northwestern gives the city.
   Northwestern is willing to hold talks with city officials on
``all matters of mutual interest to the city, not just a financial
contribution,'' said spokesman Chuck Loebbaka.
   Opponents who labeled the tax ``anti-education'' and
``anti-business'' said it would destroy the relationship between
the city and its educational institutions. Northwestern, which owns
242 of the 5,400 acres in the community, has said it is typical for
such institutions to be exempt from property taxes.
   Most of the school's nearly 10,500 students are undergraduates
who pay tuition of $13,725 a year.

   The late-night news war is heating up with plans
by CBS and ABC to take on the Cable News Network and other
competitors.
   A half-hour show on CBS will premiere Monday opposite
``Nightline'' with Ted Koppel on ABC.
   ABC's overnight, to run from 1 a.m. to 6 a.m., will start Jan. 7
if plans are approved, ABC News Vice President Joanna Bistany said
Monday.
   Charles Kuralt and Lesley Stahl will be co-anchors of the new
CBS program to air at 11:30 p.m.
   Unlike ``Nightline,'' which usually tackles a single topic each
night, the new CBS show will examine several topics each night
through live interviews, extended news segments and essays, CBS
said.
   It also will report the latest developments in the United States
and the Middle East as long as the Persian Gulf crisis continues,
CBS said.
   There was no guarantee the CBS show will continue after January,
when the network plans to begin first-run entertainment programs in
the 11:30 p.m. slot.
   ``My hope is that by then we have a program of the type of
quality, the type of (affiliate) clearance and the ratings to
continue,'' CBS News President Eric Ober said.
   Kuralt will be the anchor here and Stahl will be the anchor in
Washington. Each will continue anchoring their other respective
Sunday shows - Kuralt on ``Sunday Morning'' and Stahl on ``Face the
Nation.''
   The two network projects are part of efforts to seek new
franchises for the news divisions and ward off inroads made by
cable, including CNN.
   In January, NBC plans to start a 24-hour news operation, serving
its affiliates with international, national and regional stories
for use in local newscasts.

   As rescuers searched debris for
victims, residents of this normally bone-dry northern city mourned
relatives lost in flash floods that wiped out gully settlements,
claiming at least 45 lives.
   Officials administered food and medical care to 2,000 flood
victims at 25 public schools converted into shelters on Monday
night, Red Cross spokesman Blanca Patricia Valles said. About 800
people were in shelters run by the army.
   About 5,000 were rendered homeless by flooding from downpours
that began late Saturday, state spokesman Jorge Macias said. He
described it as the worst storm to hit Chihuahua, the state
capital, in a century.
   Forecasters said about 5 inches of rain fell on the city.
   Alfonso Sanchez Gallo, spokesman for the Chihuahua state
governor's office, said nine people were missing from low-income
areas set in gullies.
   ``It rains very little here. Many humble people with scant
resources built their homes in the gulches. ... That's the only
reason why so many people, homes and vehicles were carried away,''
he said.
   More than 300 homes collapsed and 350 vehicles were swept away,
Sanchez Gallo said.
   Three coffins adorned with flowers lay in a back room of the
Vallejo family home Monday in the city's Francisco Villa
neighborhood, one of the hardest hit.
   Delvina Vallejo had tried to save her 4-year-old daughter from
the torrent that picked her up as it rushed through their home.
Both the mother, who was pregnant, and child perished as the
husband watched clinging to a doorframe.
   ``She saw her daughter on the waves and grabbed her. That's when
the water rushed at her and they drowned,'' said neighbor Margarita
Avita.
   She said Mrs. Vallego was ``in her coffin with her hands
crossed, in the same way she was when she was holding her little
girl.''
   Police patrolled the same neighborhood Monday afternoon, warning
people that a dam was about to break. Residents panicked and cried
as they rushed to higher ground, but the dam held.
   About 40 percent of the city of 600,000 was still without water
service, state spokesman Macias said. Electricity, which went out
during the storm, had been restored, but there wer still some
problems with telephone service.

   A definition of sexual intercourse has landed
Webster's Dictionary among such banned and challenged books in the
United States as the Bible, ``The Grapes of Wrath'' and ``Hamlet,''
a library group says.
   As part of its ninth annual Banned Books Week, the American
Library Association has released a list of censored books and their
authors, ranging from Dr. Seuss to Stephen King.
   ``We need to bring to the attention of the American public the
fact that our First Amendment rights are under attack,'' said
Judith Krug, director of the association's Office for Intellectual
Freedom.
   More than 1,000 attempts to challenge or ban books were reported
to the 51,000-member American Library Association in the year up to
May, Krug said.
   Webster's Dictionary was challenged in the Upper Pittsgrove
Township, N.J., school district by parents who objected to its
definition of sexual intercourse as ``the sexual joining of two
individuals,'' said Paul Whitman, secretary of the school board.
   Webster's 1986 edition was removed from fourth- and fifth-grade
classrooms last fall but is still used in upper levels, Whitman
said.
   A year ago, ``The Lorax'' by Dr. Seuss was challenged in a
Laytonville, Calif., school district. Parents working for a local
logging company said the children's book offered a negative
portrayal of the industry.
   The book remained on the second grade's required reading list
until teachers decided to put it on an optional list in the spring,
said Superintendent Brian Buckley.
   Stephen King's ``The Stand'' was restricted to ninth-grade
students with parental consent at a Beaverton, Ore., school after
parents raised objections to violence and sexual language.
   Another King novel, ``Christine,'' was removed from library
shelves at a Connecticut district after a parent complained about
offensive passages.
   Banned Books Week, which runs through Saturday, is ``a
celebration of our freedom to read,'' Krug said.
   ``We've proven time and time again that censorship dies in the
light of day,'' Krug said.
   Krug said she advises librarians and teachers to set specific
policies on censorship, but professionals aren't the only ones who
can get involved. Anyone who attends school board meetings or
writes letters to newspapers can have an effect.
   ``As individual citizens we have to stand up and be counted,''
Krug said.

<TEXT>
   Rival Shiite Moslem groups battled with
howitzers and mortars in southern Lebanon during the night, and at
least three people were killed and 12 wounded, police said.
   The clashes, which broke out Monday afternoon and tapered off
early this morning, pitted the Syrian-backed Amal and the
pro-Iranian fundamentalist Hezbollah on the northwestern edge of
the Iqlim al-Tuffah region.
   The thuds of exploding shells echoed for miles.
   Amal, which is backed by guerrillas of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, accused Hezbollah fighters of shelling its positions
in Kfar Hatta, five miles southeast of Sidon.
   A police spokesman said no change in the position of either
militia was reported.
   A force of about 1,000 guerrillas, drawn mainly from PLO chief
Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction, mans a narrow buffer
separating Amal and Hezbollah positions in the disputed region.
   Amal and Hezbollah have been fighting on and off over three
years for leadership of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the
country's largest sect. More than 1,000 people have died in the
clashes and more than 4,000 have been wounded.
   The disputed area is next to a 440-square-mile border strip
occupied by neighboring Israel.

<TEXT>
   About 4,500 gallons of Washington state
oysters distributed in 17 states are being recalled because of red
tide contamination.
   The state Health Department said Monday the oysters contaminated
with the shellfish toxin were harvested at Liberty Bay, west of
Seattle, by Coast Oyster Co.
   The shellfish were combined with uncontaminated oysters from a
different harvest area, then packaged for distribution, the
department said. The oysters recalled were valued at $100,000.
   The oysters were distributed under the brand name Hilton's
Willapoint Fresh Oysters with Washington state certification number
006. They had ``sell by'' dates of Sept. 27 to Oct. 16.
   The oysters were shipped in Washington state and to Texas,
Alabama, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Georgia, Nevada,
Missouri, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Maryland, New York, New Mexico,
North Carolina and Louisiana.
   As a precaution, the health agency closed Liberty Bay to
shellfish harvesting until further notice.
   Red tide occurs in shellfish that have consumed large amounts of
a microscopic organism.
   It can cause severe illness and in some cases can be fatal.
Symptoms include numbness, tingling of the lips, tongue, hands and
feet, and breathing difficulties.
   The toxin was discovered during a routine sampling of shellfish
for contamination at a state laboratory.

<HEAD>Japan's Justice Minister Apologizes for Remarks on Blacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese Cabinet minister who compared black
Americans to prostitutes apologized today after criticism from the
State Department and American black leaders.
   Justice Minister Seiroku Kajiyama, 64, told reporters his
comments were ``completely inappropriate.''
   ``So I retract the remarks and deeply apologize to those
concerned,'' said the newly appointed minister, who previously
served in two other Cabinet posts.
   The minister created the stir Friday while speaking at a news
conference after the arrests of foreign women allegedly working as
prostitutes in Tokyo.
   He said prostitutes ``ruin the atmosphere'' of neighborhoods and
added: ``It's like in America when neighborhoods become mixed
because blacks move in and whites are forced out.''
   On Monday, the U.S. State Department issued a statement saying
``such remarks are offensive to the American people.''
   Ralph Neas, executive director in Washington of the Leadership
Conference on Civil Rights, had called the minister's comment
``reprehensible and racist.''
   The justice minister's comments were the latest in a series of
remarks by Japanese politicians that have provoked outrage among
U.S. minorities.
   In 1986, then Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone caused a furor
when he said: ``On the average, the United States is lower because
of a considerable number of blacks, Puerto Ricans and Mexicans.''
   The prime minister said he was referring to literacy rate. He
later pologized and said he realized his comment had ``offended
many Americans.'' But he did no retract his remarks.

   Like a father laying down the law to his teen-age
son, the government says that as long as Iraq occupies Kuwait,
Saddam Hussein can't use the car.
   The Iraqi president's black, bomb-proof $300,000 limousine is
resting on its bulletproof tires at a repair shop in the suburb of
Livonia, where the Cadillac was sent to have its engine rebuilt,
the Customs Service said Monday.
   It will be held there under authority of President Bush's
executive order freezing Iraqi assets in the United States, the
agency said.
   ``We have reason to believe that this car might have been used
by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein,'' said Donald Watson, Customs
assistant regional commissioner of enforcement in Chicago. ``In any
case, he's not going to get it back.''
   The Customs Service titled its news release on the car ``Is
Saddam Hussein Walking?''
   The Cadillac was one of 12 bought by Iraq in 1988 from
O'Gara-Hess &amp; Eisenhardt Manufacturing Co., a maker of armored
vehicles in Cincinnati, the Customs Service said. The car has
bomb-proof armor and tear gas dispensers.
   Iraq returned the limousine to O'Gara-Hess &amp; Eisenhardt in June
for refurbishing, and the Ohio company then sent it to ECS-Roush in
Livonia for engine work, Turner said.
   Bush froze Iraqi assets after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.

<HEAD>Money Tops List of Reform Goals From Urban Educators</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taking issue with a set of school reform goals
backed by President Bush and the nation's governors, a group of
urban educators offered a reform agenda with money at the top of
the list.
   The set of six goals for improving struggling city districts was
released Monday at the annual meeting here of the Council of Urban
Boards of Education, a unit of the National School Boards
Association.
   The first goal is ``equitable and adequate funding of public
education.'' In contrast, the national education goals conceived
last February by the president and the governors skirted the issue
of money.
   The other goals on the urban agenda included achieving ``racial,
ethnic and socio-economic integration,'' promoting excellence,
providing ``multicultural education,'' promoting community school
boards as the primary governing bodies in urban districts, and
educating the public to convey ``the advantages of education in
urban settings and promote confidence in urban public education.''
   ``Let's face it, urban schools have been under attack, fairly or
unfairly. But you have to remember that we are the only country in
the world that tries to educate all,'' said Arlene C. Penfield,
president-elect of the National School Boards Association.
   The urban agenda had no timetable for achieving its goals. The
governors targeted the year 2000.
   ``We definitely endorse the national goals,'' said Ulysses V.
Spiva, chairman of the urban group and a school board member in
Virginia Beach, Va.
   ``But we did not feel they addressed all the needs of urban
school districts. We don't want the governors and the president to
withdraw, and say, `Hey guys, here are our goals, we're done,' ''
he said in an interview.
   The six national goals backed by Bush and the governors were:
assuring children arrive at school healthy and ready to learn;
cutting the dropout rate to less than 10 percent; having students
achieve competence in key subjects; making U.S. students No. 1
worldwide in math and science achievement; wiping out adult
illiteracy, and ridding schools of drugs and violence.
   The urban reform goals were developed by the board's 11-member
steering committee, made up of school board members from their
respective districts.

   Demonstrators tossed paint-filled
balloons, bottles and firecrackers at police outside a hotel where
Vice President Dan Quayle was addressing a fund-raiser, police
said. Forty-three people were arrested.
   No injuries were reported in Monday's protest by about 200
people outside the Portland Hilton.
   The protesters represented a variety of causes. Some carried
signs reading, ``No blood for oil'' - a protest against the buildup
in the Persian Gulf - and ``No fascist state.'' Among the chants
was ``Right wing go away, sexist, racist, anti-gay.''
   Demonstrators set fire to newspapers and made obscene gestures
at about 100 officers ringing the hotel, said police spokesman Dave
Simpson.
   Officers on horseback moved into the crowd, using night sticks
to drive the protesters back. Police seized American flags as
protesters tried to ignite them.
   Those arrested were charged with misdemeanors including
disorderly conduct, unlawful assembly and harassment.
   After Quayle left the hotel for the airport, the protesters
moved to a track a block away and delayed a commuter train during
the afternoon rush hour.
   Lanny Swerdlow of American Atheists said he came to the
demonstration because Quayle supports a local ballot measure that
would give tax credits of up to $2,500 to parents who send their
children to private schools.

   At least 51 people were killed when a
gas truck overturned and exploded at a busy Bangkok intersection,
quickly covering cars, shops and a women's dormitory in flames,
police said today.
   Another 92 people were injured, many seriously, said Bangkok
police superintendent Col. Kongbej Chooseekongdej.
   The 6-wheel truck overturned near the railway crossing at New
Petchburi Road on Monday night. The liquefied gas gushed out of its
two huge tanks, and flames swept over 43 cars and 30 shops and
other buildings on both sides of the street, said deputy commander
of the Bangkok police, Col. Wanlop Watjanapooka.
   The truck crashed into cars waiting to get onto an expressway,
said a witness who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``A huge ball of flames rose into the air. It may have been a
kilometer (half-mile) high,'' he said. ``Then I saw the line of
cars exploding in succession.''
   Gas had leaked under the cars and ignited and the fire raged for
two hours before 60 fire engines and hundreds of volunteers
extinguished it.
   ``We were driving back to the hotel after dinner and we got
caught in a traffic jam,'' said Peter Gillies, who was slightly
burned. ``We could smell gas but were just sort of trapped. About
30 seconds later everything just exploded.
   ``Once we smelled the gas we thought something was going to
happen, but we didn't get out quick enough,'' said Gillies, of
Nanaimo, British Colombia.
   ``There seemed to be like two blasts, one when we were in the
car and one when we got out. We had to run through the flame but my
wife wasn't quick enough.''
   Gillies' wife, Michelle, was seriously burned.
   There was no immediate information about where most of the
fatalities occurred.

<HEAD>Stocks Plunge To 33-month Low; Dollar Drops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices plunged to a 33-month low in Tokyo
today as surging oil prices discouraged investors, dealers said.
The dollar weakened against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar closed at 136.70 yen, down 0.63 yen from last
Friday's finish. The U.S. currency opened at 136.75 yen and ranged
between 136.40 yen and 137.00 yen, with an estimated $8.15 billion
trading hands in spot trading.
   On Monday, financial markets were closed in Tokyo because of a
national holiday.
   The dollar opened lower after weakening in New York. Trading
then lagged, with ``the dollar hardly moving in the afternoon'' as
investors retreated to the sidelines to avoid risks before the end
of the first half of Japan's fiscal year, said Naohiko Yasuda, a
dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
   The first half of fiscal 1990 for most Japanese companies ends
Friday. Foreign exchange transactions after Wednesday will be
settled in the second half of the fiscal year.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average lost
418.51 points, or 1.76 percent, ending the day at 23,359.32, its
lowest closing level since Jan. 27, 1988, when it ended at
23,335.91.
   The Nikkei shed 174.85 points on Friday.
   Today's trading was thin, with only 230 million shares changing
hands on the market's first section.
   ``The market was shocked when oil prices rose to $40 (a barrel),
although investors have expected prices could reach that level at
least temporarily,'' said Kenji Maeshiro, a trader with Yamaichi
Securities Co.
   ``But what investors are really afraid of is not the price. For
us, no matter how much oil rises, it is still okay as long as we
have oil supplies,'' he said. ``But we can't deny the possibility
of being able to get no oil as a result of the Gulf conflict.''
   Japan depends on imports for 99 percent of its oil needs, and 70
percent comes from the Middle East.
   An overnight surge in oil prices of more than $3 a barrel was
set off by a statement by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein that he
would rather go to war than let the U.N. trade embargo strangle his
country.
   Higher crude oil prices create a threat of inflation and
typically lead to increases in gasoline prices.
   Maeshiro predicted that oil prices of up to $25 to $30 a barrel
could be absorbed by the effects of the stronger yen if it remains
at about 135 yen per dollar. However, rising oil prices ``will
definitely slow down the nation's economy,'' he said.
   ``So far, Japanese companies, especially manufacturers, don't
seem to be affected by the higher oil prices, but the Bank of Japan
will have to reverse its tight monetary policy sooner or later,''
he said.
   Maeshiro said overnight declines in the Dow Jones average in New
York and a plunge in Japanese government bond prices contributed to
the Nikkei's drop.
   ``There is no positive element to encourage investors' buying
interest now,'' he said.
   The price of benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government bonds
closed at 80.77 points, down from 81.09 on Friday and their lowest
level ever. Their yield rose to 8.680 percent from last Friday's
8.600 percent.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was mixed against other foreign
currencies in early European trading today. Gold prices were
sharply higher, rising by more than $15 an ounce in Hong Kong.
   Dealers said the absence of any economic news this week and
signs that finance ministers from the seven major industrialized
countries aren't seeking changes in foreign exchange trends left
the market focusing on oil and the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``The direction for the dollar is certainly lower,'' said a
chief trader at a Frankfurt money center bank, adding that concerns
about the U.S. economy were pulling the dollar down.
   John Baker, senior dealer at Bank Julius Baer and Co., said he
expects the Swiss franc, considered a safe haven currency, to
benefit especially if the dollar continues to fall on oil price
jitters.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.63 yen from Friday's Tokyo closing
to a closing 136.70 yen. Japanese markets were closed Monday for
the Autumnal Equinox national holiday. Later in London, the dollar
was quoted at 136.50 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   -1.5592 German marks, up from 1.5565
   -1.2945 Swiss francs, down from 1.2965
   -5.2245 French francs, up from 5.2145
   -1.7527 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7665
   -1,167.00 Italian lire, up from 1,165.50
   -1.1485 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1483
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8895, compared
with $1.8810 late Monday.
   Bullion dealers said the price of gold shot up late Monday in
line with a strong rally in oil prices, which are inflationary.
Investors buy gold as a hedge against inflation.
   Dealers said the strong up trend continued in Far East trading
but profit-takers in London stopped the precious metal's climb.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$406.35 per ounce at midmorning, up from $396.55 bid per ounce late
Monday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $407.00, up from $392.20 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $15.03 to close at a bid
$404.45.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $4.93 a troy ounce,
from Monday's $4.89.

   Blue skies prevailed over much of the nation's interior today as
warm air chased away the weekend's chilly blast.
   Today's forecast calls for scattered showers and thunderstorms
in Oregon, Idaho, Nevada and Utah, and showers in Northern
California and Florida's southern tip.
   A warming trend was predicted for the East, with temperatures
rising into the 70s. The South was looking for a near-perfect day,
with sunshine, low humidity and highs in the 80s. Nighttime lows in
the 50s were expected.
   Temperatures were expected to soar into the 90s in parts of the
Plains and the Southwest. Highs were expected to be in the 80s for
the Rockies and in the 70s for the Pacific Northwest.
   Skies were mostly clear early today, with some clouds in the
Northeast and Florida.
   The high temperature for the nation Monday was 100 degrees at
Borrego Springs, Calif.

<HEAD>Iraqi Government Orders More Grain Planted</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Gulf Rdp</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ,
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) - Iraq has ordered farmers to plant 80
percent of their land wihh wheat to offset food shortages caused by
the international trade embargo, the ruling party's newspaper
reported today.
   Any farmer who violates the order will be fined double the value
of the production expected from him, the Agriculture Ministry said.
   Ministry Undersecretary Abdul Sattar Hussein was quoted by the
Baath party newspaper, Al-Thawra, as saying committees have been
formed in all provinces to supervise the program. Provincial
governors are heading the committees.
   ``Because of the economic blockade, we all should shoulder our
responsibilities in order to plant each inch of our land and
increase the production of grains, especially wheat because this is
the basic foodstuff for our people,'' the undersecretary was quoted
as saying.
   The U.N. Security Council has imposed an embargo on trade with
Iraq to punish it for its Aug. 2 invasion and seizure of
neighboring Kuwiat.
   Iraq has 43 million acres of arable land but little more than 13
percent of it is in use. Almost 57 percent of that is planted with
grains, mainly wheat, barley and rice.
   Iraq has been a major importer of foodstuffs, buying about 75
percent of its food abroad last year. Annual imports, especially
grains, totaled $1 billion before the U.N.-ordered embargo.
   The United States had been the major exporter of foodstuffs to
Iraq.
   Hussein said his ministry has provided cheaper seeds and
fertilizer, and has increased wheat prices to encourage farmers to
grow more, Al-Thawra reported.
   He also said special workshops are being set up to help maintain
and repair machinery and help farmers overcome technical problems.

<HEAD>Harold King, Reuters World War II Correspondent, Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British journalist Harold King, who covered the
battle of Stalingrad and forged close ties with French leader
Charles de Gaulle, has died. He was 91.
   The Reuters news agency's Paris bureau, which King headed from
1944 to 1967, said he died Monday at a clinic at Nogent-Sur-Marne,
near Paris.
   He died of heart failure following surgery for a bladder-related
ailment, the British agency said.
   ``Harold was larger than life, commanding attention and respect
among journalists, in political circles and among the best
restaurants in Europe,'' Reuters managing director, Glen Renfrew,
commented in London.
   King was born Harold Koenig in Berlin in 1898. The family moved
to London and his father, a German psychiatrist, changed the family
name to King when World War I broke out in 1914.
   King began his literary career in 1919 as secretary to writer
Jerome K. Jerome, author of ``Three Men in a Boat.''
   But he quickly shifted to journalism and moved to Paris in 1931,
where he became correspondent for The Wall Street Journal and the
Financial Times.
   King fled Paris for London in 1940 as Hitler's armies stormed
across France. He then began his long career with Reuters, covering
Gen. de Gaulle's exiled French forces.
   Reuters later sent King to the Soviet Union, where he wrote on
the Red Army victory at Stalingrad and covered Stalin's breakup of
the Communist International in 1943.
   King accompanied the Free French landings in southern France in
1944.
   He cultivated his contacts with de Gaulle during the general's
postwar withdrawal from political life. France recalled him as
president in 1958 during the height of the Algerian war.
   The two men enjoyed close relations, and King became one of de
Gaulle's favorite media contacts.
   After King stepped down as head of the Paris bureau, the agency
named him honorary assistant director for life. He later worked as
a correspondent for the Toronto Telegram.
   France named King a commander of the Legion of Honor, one of the
country's highest honors, in 1971.
   King had been in failing health for about a decade. His recent
surgery followed a broken hip suffered in a fall a few weeks ago.
   His wife, the Romanian dancer Irene Codreanu, died in 1985. The
couple had no children. Funeral arrangements were not immediately
announced.

<TEXT>
   Environmentalists who contend Yosemite
National Park has become over-commercialized have banded together
in an effort to take over the contract to run the park's hotels,
restaurants and concession stands.
   The Yosemite Restoration Trust, a non-profit group formed with
the backing of leaders of The Wilderness Society, the Sierra Club
and the National Audubon Society, launched an effort Monday to win
the contract that expires in 1993.
   The contract now is held by a company known as Yosemite Park and
Curry Co., a division of entertainment giant MCA that has operated
hotels in Yosemite for 91 years. If it won the new contract, the
trust would have to negotiate to buy Curry's vast holdings.
   If the trust's bid succeeds, it will be the first time
environmental advocates control tourist services in a national
park.
   The group claims the 100-year-old park in the Sierra Nevada is
being turned into a crowded resort replete with pizza and ice cream
stands, video rentals, moonlight tram tours and ever more cars.
   ``On a busy Sunday afternoon the air in the Yosemite Valley is
almost as bad as in Los Angeles,'' said Dr. Edgar Wayburn, a former
Sierra Club president. The park has 3.4 million visitors a year.
   The group said it wouldn't knock down the park's hotels and
motels but would try to change an atmosphere some consider overly
commercial.
   George T. Frampton Jr., president of The Wilderness Society and
a member of the new trust's board of directors, accused Curry Co.
of exploiting the park while giving the government a tiny share of
profits.
   ``We must put park protection ahead of private profits in our
national parks,'' Frampton said. ``Yosemite, as it enters its
second century, is far too precious a place to be run as a private
profit center.''
   Frampton and others claim Curry has failed to carry out a 1980
park managemetn plan that calls for reducing roads, traffic and
buildings.
   Curry spokesman John Poimiroo, however, said warehouse and
reservations operations, for example, have been moved out of the
park to Fresno, and the number of buildings in the park have not
increased in 20 years.
   Curry doesn't report its profits in Yosemite, but Poimiroo said
a reported estimate of $17 million is grossly exaggerated.
   The company pays the government 0.75 percent of its gross
revenue. In 1988, that amounted to $590,000 on revenue of $78
million.
   ``We admit that what we pay now we consider to be low,''
Poimiroo said. ``But in the 15 years since MCA took over this
company it has invested over $100 million in the park.''

<TEXT>
   Nearly a year after the World Series
earthquake, the city's supervisors have voted to tear down the
quake-damaged Embarcadero Freeway and replace it with a
ground-level or underground road.
   The resolution approved 6-5 Monday by the Board of Supervisors
is strictly advisory because state and federal authorities have
final say on what to do about the elevated freeway that has been
shut since the Oct. 17 quake.
   The 1.5-mile stretch of freeway, also known as Interstate 480,
extends from the Bay Bridge to Chinatown and the North Beach
restaurant district.
   Many longtime residents, backed by Mayor Art Agnos, want the
freeway replaced with a ground-level or underground road because
the elevated freeway blocks a view of San Francisco Bay and covers
prime real estate.
   Merchants in Chinatown have demanded speedy repairs instead,
saying their businesses have been in a slump since the earthquake.
   The earthquake damaged the freeway's underpinnings so badly that
the road was closed to all traffic.
   Agnos said a replacement roadway could cost about $135 million.
   ``What we're saying today is that we have a unified message that
will go to Sacramento and Washington that says San Francisco has
made a decision,'' said Agnos. ``We want to take down a structure
we do not believe can be made safe and replace it with a structure
that can be made safe.''
   The freeway, he said, has been ``a terrible blight on the face
of our city for the last 35 years.''
   Most of the earthquake's 67 victims were killed in the collapse
of a section of Interstate 880, an elevated freeway in Oakland.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq said today it will put President Bush
on trial Oct. 15 for ``crimes against the peoples of the world.''
   Iraq first announced its plan to put Bush on trial on Sept. 12,
shortly after Western officials suggested Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein be tried for crimes against humanity for the use of
chemical weapons in 1988 against Iraq's minority Kurdish
population.
   Baghdad accuses Bush of planning a war against Iraq, attempting
genocide by sponsoring U.N. sanctions on Iraq for its invasion of
Kuwait, and committing aggression against Panama and Grenada,
according to Hamid Al-Rawi, chairman of Iraq's bar association and
head of a panel preparing for the trial.
   ``Bush has committed many crimes since he took office as
president of the United States and also before that when he was
vice president,'' the English language Baghdad Observer quoted
Al-Rawi as saying in today's editions.
   He was quoted as saying the United States, which has sent more
than 150,000 troops to the Persian Gulf to counter Iraq, had
committed ``a crime against peace, punishable by international
law.''
   Al-Rawi said the trial would be an ``international process''
with witnesses from other countries and Arab and non-Arab jurists.
It would be conducted on the same basis as the Nuremberg trials of
Nazi war criminals following World War II, he said.
   Other accusations against Bush include the enforcement by the
United States ``of an economic blockade against the people of Iraq
with the aim of starving children, women and elderly to death, and
also preventing food, medicine and baby milk from reaching the
country in violation of the the U.N. charter.''
   ``This is a crime punishable by international conventions which
consider this an act of genocide,'' Al-Rawi was quoted as saying.
   AlRawi did not say what the punishment might be if Bush is
convicted during the three-day trial.

   President Hafez Assad of Syria left
Tehran today after a four-day visit, and sources said he failed to
win an Iranian pledge not to send food and other essentials to
Iraq.
   Sources close to the Syrian delegation said Tehran reiterated
its pledge to uphold embargo rules imposed by the U.N. Security
Council after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   But Iran insisted it is not breaking the sanctions because the
embargo allows ``humanitarian shipments'' of food.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Iranians had promised not to buy embargoed Iraqi oil, or to help
Baghdad export its crude.
   An Iranian newspaper had said Assad carried an appeal from the
United States against food shipments as well.
   Assad failed to see eye-to-eye with Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani on many issues, but those differences were not great
enough to drive a wedge between Iran and its main Arab ally, the
sources said.
   The first indication that things were not going well for Assad
came when he announced Sunday he was extending his stay, apparently
for a last-ditch effort in trying to impress upon Rafsanjani the
importance of witholding food shipments to Iraq.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia, said Assad was seen off at
Tehran's Mehrabad airport by Rafsanjani.
   Before departing, Assad said the results of his talks had been
``good and very effective.''
   He said his meetings with Rafsanjani had been ``friendly, and I
don't think anything relating to the region remained undiscussed.''
   Rafsanjani said ``in our talks we did not reach any point of
difference requiring a great deal of discussions.''
   The English-language Tehran Times said some of Rafsanjani's
discussions with Assad, conducted behind closed doors, had lasted
several hours.
   The report did not provide any details of those meetings.
   Besides the embargo, the two are also believed to have discussed
the fate of 13 Western hostages in Lebanon.
   The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

   Marines guarding a military supply port in
northeast Saudi Arabia said today the greatest danger to them was a
Beirut-style terrorist car bombing. But they said they were ready
to quash any threat.
   ``I think he'd be a pretty foolish terrorist to take us on,''
said Chief Warrant Officer Charles Rowe, who was shipped out of
Lebanon the day before the Oct. 23, 1983, car bombing that killed
241 American servicemen.
   ``This is a personal opinion, but I wouldn't mind evening the
score,'' Rowe said in a dockside interview as fellow Marines
marched and drove around the port perimeter.
   Of any potential terrorist attacker, he said: ``I know he's
going to suffer. I'll promise you he'll suffer. We're going to hurt
him.''
   The Marines search for answers about the impact of the Beirut
bombing on their units and psyches even as they insist there is no
comparison to the peacekeeping deployment in Lebanon and the
defensive mission in Saudi Arabia.
   In Lebanon, the Marines were grouped in a vulnerable barracks
building and all but the last layer of their security was in the
hands of the fractious Lebanese military.
   In Saudi Arabia, the Marines are spread across the port area and
have an elaborate security system that includes decoy guard posts
and targets. The Marines say they trust the Saudis who guard other
sectors of the port, which receives supplies for the entire
American military deployment.
   The commander of the security unit, Lt. Col. Tom Hayden, said
alert levels were at their maximum level for several days about two
weeks ago, after the military received intelligence about a
possible terrorist attempt on the port.
   He refused to provide details concerning the intelligence and
said security was back to routine alert status.
   The Persian Gulf port is far from the Iraqi troops to the north
in Kuwait, and Iraq has no navy to speak of, leaving the air and
ground as the only likely attack routes.
   Hayden said he is confident that Air Force, Marine and Navy air
power would block any Iraqi attempt to send fighter jets into Saudi
territory. And the Army has stationed several Patriot ground-to-air
missile lauchers at the port to protect the Marines against
incoming missiles.
   So as he discounts the comparisons with Lebanon, Hayden pointed
to a port gate and says his principal worry is a car bombing, ``the
favorite terrorist weapon in this part of the world.''
   But, with bravado much like that of Rowe, Hayden predicted any
attempt would fail.
   ``I think that terrorists would realize that would be a
mistake,'' Hayden said. ``It won't happen again.''

   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki will
make an unannounced trip to the United States this weekend and may
meet with President Bush, a government source said today.
   Mazowiecki left this morning for a four-day visit to Spain,
where he will meet with King Juan Carlos and Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez.
   He will travel on to the United States on Friday and may see
Bush on Saturday, according to the Gazeta Wyborcza daily. There was
no immediate comment on the report from the White House.
   A Polish government source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Mazowiecki would not be accompanied by an official delegation.
   However, several senior Polish officials are already in the
United States, including Deputy Prime Minister Leszek Balcerowicz,
who is appearing before the International Monetary Fund, seeking
forgiveness of part of Poland's $42 billion debt to the West.
   Also, Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski is attending the
United Nations General Assembly session in New York.
   Relations between the United States and Poland have become close
since Mazowiecki's Solidarity-led government took power just over a
year ago.
   But Polish officials have expressed concern that the recent
political split in the Solidarity camp, pitting Mazowiecki backers
against loyalists of Lech Walesa, could erode U.S. sympathy for
Poland.
   The visit would be Mazowiecki's second to the United States as
prime minister. He traveled to Washington in March and met with
Bush then.
   Walesa announced Sept. 17 that he is running for president.
Elections are to be held by the end of December but the exact date
has not been set.
   Political supporters of Mazowiecki met with the prime minister
Saturday and said they expected he would announce his presidential
bid shortly after lawmakers approve legislation setting up the
election.
   Walesa, chairman of Solidarity, 13 months ago picked Mazowiecki
to be prime minister. But he has criticized the government as too
slow in ousting Communists from positions of influence and
privatizing the economy.
   President Wojciech Jaruzelski, the former Communist leader who
tried to crush Solidarity through martial law in 1981, agreed to
end his term 4{ years early to allow popular presidential
elections.

<HEAD>Bulgarian Party Chief Re-elected After Resignation</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 4 grafs to UPDATE with background on defeated
reformer. Pickup 4th graf pvs, `Lilov announced...'
^By ROLAND PRINZ</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   A day after offering his resignation, the
chairman of the governing Socialists was re-elected today by
delegates to a party congress whose majority appears reluctant to
forge ahead with quick reform.
   Alexander Lilov, who was opposed by reforers in the party, was
re-elected during an all-night session of the long-ruling party
that shed its Communist appellation last spring, then won
multiparty elections.
   He gained 833 of the more than 1,300 votes, officials said,
defeating radical reformer Alexander Tomov.
   Tomov won election to the party's 151-member Supreme Council,
formerly its Central Committee.
   Lilov announced Monday that he was stepping down to make way for
a new, more ``pragmatic'' leader.
   But the announcement apparently was a tactical maneuver to
elicit support, and his re-election appeared a victory for
conservative forces.
   Lilov, 57, became party leader in February, four months after
hard-line leader Todor Zhivkov was ousted. Since then, however,
Bulgaria has made fewer changes in its Communist system than some
of its Eastern European neighbors.
   Lilov had served as chief ideologist of the Communist Party
until Zhivkov dropped him from the leadership in 1983. He rejoined
the top ranks only after Zhivkov's ouster.
   Progressive and conservative factions of the renamed party are
now vying for control. Throughout the congress, spokesmen for
reform factions repeatedly called for Lilov's replacement.
   But the reformers were outnumbered, and their candidates stood
no chance against Lilov. A Socialist Party official said Monday
that reformers numbered about one-third of the delegates.
   In June, the Communists won Bulgaria's first free elections in
58 years. Since then, however, their popularity has waned as the
economy sputtered. Basic foods like sugar and cooking oil are
rationed, and electric power is cut regularly.
   The Socialists ended weeks of deadlock over Bulgaria's
presidency by agreeing last month to elect Zhelyu Zhelev, leader of
the democratic opposition. He serves as the country's chief of
state.
   Despite his election, government opposition has sometimes turned
violent. An angry crowd of protesters attacked, burned and looted
the Socialist Party headquarters on Aug. 26.
   That attack was reportedly provoked by the Socialists' refusal
to remove a red star from its headquarters.
   On Monday, the party congress voted to remove all such symbols
of the Communist era from party buildings and adopted a new emblem
- a white rose on a red background.
   The congress decided Monday that its new chairman would be
chosen by the whole congress - not just the party's Supreme Council
of about 150 members. It has also elected a new party presidium and
council.

<HEAD>Protester Says KGB Threatened to Destroy Tent City</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who spends her days in a tent city near
the Kremlin said today the KGB had threatened to set fire to the
protest encampment at night when there would be no witnesses. The
KGB denied it.
   Valentina Philimonova, one of 50 people camped on the grass
every day outside the Rossiya Hotel, said that a man she identified
as a KGB agent had threatened to pour gasoline on the tents and set
them alight if the people didn't end their protest against the
failure of the government to provide adequate housing and jobs.
   ``He said they would come at night when no one would see what
was happening,'' she said.
   An officer at the KGB's press center said not only would the
agency ``never attempt such provocations now, but it would have
been unthinkable even during the time of stagnation,'' a reference
to the era of the late Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev.
   It was not the first case of people approaching the tent city,
identifying themselves as KGB agents and trying to intimidate the
protesters or provoking their anger, said the officer, who refused
to give his name.
   ``No one at KGB would allow it,'' he said of the alleged threat.
   Ms. Philimonova lives in a wooden shack covered with slogans
saying that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has failed to carry out
his oath, pledging to serve the people.
   She is among dozens of people who inhabit and gather around the
31 tents, hoping someone will listen to their problems and punish
those responsible for their plight.
   Some of the signs that adorn the tents and shacks denounce the
Communist Party; others tell of losing homes and jobs because the
protesters had dared to criticize their bosses.
   The protest began July 2 when the demonstrators arrived outside
the enormous hotel near Red Square and put up the tents and shacks,
made of wood and plastic, hoping to attract official attention and
help against the local government. They arrive at 8 a.m. and leave
at 9 p.m.
   So far, the government has not responded to their protest.

   One student was killed and four were
wounded by gunfire today as police battled to control a riot
touched off by a government policy setting job quotas according to
caste standing.
   A student who had set himself on fire at a crowded intersection
in the capital on Monday died at a hospital today, officials said,
and in surrounding neighborhoods, thousands of people pelted police
with bricks and stones.
   The army was reported on alert in New Delhi, and has already
been called out in at least seven other northern Indian cities.
   In Monday's incident, student Surinder Singh Chauhan, 22, doused
himself with gasoline in a busy intersection and set himself
alight.
   The student shot to death today was identified as 21-year-old
Pawan Sahni. Four other protesters were being treated at hospitals
for gunshot wounds, reporters at the hospitals said.
   In today's protests, housewives and middle-class Indians joined
the students in the streets. The crowds attacked and set on fire
police vehicles, school buses and public buses.
   The protests began after Prime Minister V.P. Singh announced
Aug. 7 that 27 percent of government jobs will be reserved for
people from lower castes, who have been downtrodden for centuries
by India's rigid caste system.
   Another 22.5 percent of the coveted jobs already were kept aside
for what the government described as the most backward castes and
native tribes. Five to 10 percent of jobs are proposed to be
reserved for the poor, irrespective of caste.
   The move triggered a wave of protests by upper-caste students
who say it will deprive them of job opportunities. At least 25
people have died in battles with police, and a score have attempted
suicide by setting themselves ablaze.
   On Monday, Singh gave a Cabinet minister and a senior party
leader the authority to open talks with protesting students and
explain the policy. But students have refused to negotiate until
the government scraps the quotas, which Singh has said he will not
do.
   Chandra Shekhar, a senior leader of Singh's Janata Dal party,
urged the government today to review its stand. It was the first
break in the leadership's refusal to respond to the students.
   ``History will never forgive us,'' said Shekhar. ``If they are
led by frustration and despair to this extreme position, there is
no hope for the future of the country,'' he was quoted as saying by
Press Trust of India.
   Police cordoned off the hospital where the burned student died,
but thousands of people gathered in streets nearby. Witnesses said
police fired tear gas and rifle volleys.
   Students responded by pelting the police with stones and
attacking police vehicles, ripping out car radios and smashing
windshields. At least seven police vehicles were damaged and one
was burned. Many state-owned buses also were set on fire.
   Hindus, who comprise 82 percent of India's 880 million people,
are divided into four castes and hundreds of sub-castes, which
determine a person's social standing.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere said today
that East Germans fear for their futures in a united Germany, and
that social guarantees are needed to ease the move to a new
society.
   In a wide-ranging conversation with The Associated Press board
of directors, de Maiziere also said the lingering specter of the
former secret police is ``one of the most difficult legacies we
have'' from the Communist past.
   East Germany's first freely chosen leader, in an address and
during a question-and-answer session, outlined his hopes for his 16
million people as they move closer to German unification on Oct. 3.
   He said East Germans had the misfortune of living for four
decades under a government in which their futures were decided by
the Communist hierarchy.
   A tremendous obstacle will be teaching them to take control of
their destinies to live successful lives in the competitive,
free-market society epitomized by West Germany, he said.
   ``The future in the past meant the future prescribed by the
Politburo,'' he said. ``Now the people see their future is not a
prescribed time, but a free time. This is something people did not
learn, and they are afraid of that.''
   He said the future government of a united Germany must have a
``strong social consciousness'' to help East Germans make the
transition.
   He also said the files on 6 million people compiled by the
notorious secret police known as the Stasi, and the tens of
thousands of people who worked for them, are among the most
difficult problems confronting the new society.
   He said German law enforcment officials should have access to
those files to punish people who committed crimes for the Stasi,
and to rehabilitate people whose lives were ruined by the dreaded
security apparatus.
   But there should not be wide public access because the
information contained in them could be damaging, de Maiziere said.
   About 5,000 Stasi workers were used exclusively to listen to
telephone conversations, and the details in the files not only
contain political views but information such as whether people were
faithful to their spouses.
   De Maiziere will relinquish control of his country to West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Oct. 3.
   He said he has viewed his role as prime minister as that of a
lawyer representing a very large client during the hard bargaining
on the terms of unification, and he would accept a similar role in
a united Germany.
   However, he said he has made no decision on whether to become
one of the four East German ministers who will be added to Kohl's
Cabinet when the Germanys unite.
   Meanwhile, East Germany's interior minister said today that he
believed extremists from both the left and right were planning to
disrupt unification celebrations next week in Berlin.
   Peter-Michael Diestel spoke hours after about 500 leftist
protesters rampaged in central East Berlin, smashing windows at a
major department store.
   Diestel, speaking to reporters, called Monday night's incident a
``general rehearsal'' for disturbances he said were planned at the
celebrations starting late next Tuesday. He did not say how he had
learned of the plans.

<HEAD>Waste Management Subsidiary Agrees to Pay Huge EPA Fine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A company has been fined $3.75 million fine for
violating licensing regulations for burning PCBs and other
hazardous wastes, an Environmental Protection Agency official said.
   The fine was the agency's largest ever assessed against a single
facility.
   The federal EPA cited CWM Chemical Services Inc., a subsidiary
of Waste Management Inc., for several technical violations,
including improper record-keeping and failing to monitor
continuously for oxygen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide
emissions when burning PCBs.
   The violations at the plant, located on Chicago's South Side,
did not endanger the environment, EPA spokesman John Connell said
Monday. CWM disposes of hazardous waste for government and private
industry clients.
   ``We wanted to take strong enforcement action to prevent any
future violations that could cause environmental problems,''
Connell said.
   The violations occurred mostly in 1986 and 1987, and the company
has corrected the violations since then, CWM spokesman Joe Pokorny
said.
   Cancer-causing PCBs - polychlorinated biphenyls - once were
commonly used in electrical transformers as a coolant. They since
have been banned.

   Bailet, 70, was assistant mayor and a close confidant of Medecin

municipal elections can be set.
   Medecin, 62, had been mayor of Nice since his father, Jean, died

   Medecin, who resigned Sept. 16, faces charges that he
overstepped his authority by acting as the city's accountant in
renegotiating the municipal debt.
   He is now in Argentina but must appear in a Nice court Wednesday
or be declared a fugitive.
   Medecin calls the charges a frame-up by his political enemies.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today rejected
exiled writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn's recent proposals for
replacing the Soviet Union with an all-Slavic state as
disrespectful to other ethnic groups.
   In his first public remarks on Solzhenitsyn's suggestions, the
59-year-old Soviet leader said they were unacceptable and sharply
conflicted with his own views on how to restructure relations
between the 15 Soviet republics.
   ``As a politician, his views on the future of our multinational
state are unacceptable,'' Gorbachev told the Supreme Soviet
legislature. ``They are far from reality. ... These views have a
destructive character.''
   Gorbachev's remarks put him into a competition with
Solzhenitsyn, a Nobel laureate, for the hearts and minds of the
Russian people and underscored the writer's increasing importance.
   In his article, which appeared Sept. 18 in the reformist
newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, Solzhenitsyn, 71, called for
spirituality over materialism and a unified Slavic nation. He
criticized Gorbachev's reforms.
   Solzhenitsyn suggested forming a ``Russian Union,'' which would
include the republics of Russia, Byelorussia and the Ukraine. A
large part of Kazakhstan would also be included. The other 12
Soviet republics, including the rest of Kazakhstan, have different
cultures and should be allowed to secede, he said.
   It was the first piece he has written directly for the Russian
people since he was exiled and stripped of his citizenship in 1974.
   Gorbachev said Solzhenitsyn's political views are ``all in the
past, the past Russia, the czarist monarchy.''
   ``For me,'' the president added, ``this is unacceptable.''
   Gorbachev told lawmakers his goal in restructuring relations
among the republics was a ``union of sovereign states where every
people feels well and realizes its potential.''
   He responded to Solzhenitsyn's article at the request of a
legislator from Kazakhstan, who objected to the call for Russians
to take control of some of his republic's territory.
   The lawmaker, Erkegali Rakhmadiev, said in an interview later
that what Solzhenitsyn was proposing was a ``Hitlerite, fascist
approach'' to ethnic relations.
   Some Ukrainians also bristled at Solzhenitsyn's proposed new
union.
   The independent news agency Postfactum said Tuesday the regional
governing council in Lvov, in the western Ukraine, approved a
statement saying that in Solzhenitsyn's article, ``We are once
again cast in the role of a small brother.''
   Most of the Soviet Union's republics already have launched
drives to wrest more power from Moscow or to secede, and the
discussion of Solzhenitsyn's article came during debate on a new
treaty to govern relations among the republics.
   The Soviet leader spoke from a lectern in the Supreme Soviet's
white marble meeting hall in the Kremlin in a soft and calm voice,
making a rare public reference to his own Russian heritage and to
his roots in southern Russia. His deliberative tone contrasted
sharply with his angry, loud pronouncements in recent days in
legislative debates on economic reform.
   After reading the article twice, Gorbachev said he was
``possessed by very conflicting feelings.''
   ``As a Russian, I fully grasped the pain and alarm for the fate
of the Russian people, for the fate of Russia. But at the same
time, as a Russian I resolutely cannot agree with Alexander
Isayevich's position in relation to other peoples. In the most mild
evaluation, this is a disrespectful position.''
   Despite his criticism of Solzhenitsyn's proposals, Gorbachev
praised him as a ``great person'' with interesting thoughts.
   Solzhenitsyn, who lives in Canvendish, Vt., described life in
Soviet prison camps in such acclaimed works as ``One Day in the
Life of Ivan Denisovich,'' and ``The Gulag Archipelago.''
   He was deported after the latter book was published in the West.
Gorbachev restored the writer's citizenship last month, although
Solzhenitsyn has expressed reluctance about returning.

   A resident of a Brooklyn housing project where a
12-year-old girl was killed says that if soldiers can be sent to
the Middle East they also should be sent to New York's war zones.
   ``The tenants here want the National Guard brought in. They feel
that if the National Guard can be sent to Iraq, then they ought to
be brought to Brooklyn,'' said the resident of the Cypress Hills
project, who identified herself only as Mildred.
   ``Just that nobody cares about us,'' she added.
   On Monday, children played near a patch of blood where Laykama
Taylor - known as Sugar - was shot in the back while playing Sunday
afternoon.
   The Daily News reported today that Laykama may have been killed
because of a family squabble, rather than being the victim of a
bullet intended for someone else.
   Her aunt, Pee Taylor, told the newspaper that Laykama had argued
with another 12-year-old three days earlier and that older members
of both girl's families had been dragged into the fight.
   ``That wasn't a stray. That bullet was meant for her,'' the aunt
said.
   On Friday in Harlem, another 12-year-old girl was shot and
wounded while playing in a playground.
   Yet another youngster, a 13-year-old girl, was shot in the head
Monday night while sitting on a bench in the same Cypress Hills
housing project.
   The girl, whose name was not released, was sitting on a bench
with a friend, said police Officer Scott Block. They heard shots
and started running when the teen-ager noticed she had been hit.
She was in stable condition at Brookdale Hospital, Block said.
   He said she was either shot with birdshot or pellets from a BB
gun.
   Sixteen children have been shot in New York City since July 22,
police said. Laykama was the sixth to die.
   Many Cypress Hills residents say they are so overwhelmed by the
drug-related violence they simply don't leave their apartments.
Some tenants, like Mildred, want the National Guard called in.
   ``It's like a terror all the time here,'' said Trina Williams,
21, who was walking near the project Monday with her daughter,
Tanara, 4. ``You have to look out for your life all the time here.
I was homeless before I came here and you'll take anything when
you're homeless, but I didn't know it would be this bad.''
   Mayor David Dinkins called Taylor ``the latest victim of the
epidemic of gunfire that is turning our cities into war zones.''
Dinkins called again for tighter gun controls.
   Another resident of the bleak complex in Brooklyn's East New
York section said there are about three shootings per week at
Cypress Hills.
   ``This is the OK Corral,'' said Latoya Williams, 16. ``I almost
been shot a lot of times. You just bend over and you hear some
bullet go whizzing by.''
   On Monday, two teen-agers who knew Laykama Taylor came to the
playground where she was killed. They said their mothers want to
move but have nowhere to go.
   ``It's getting worse. Kids can't even come out and play
anymore,'' said Myqueen Divers, 14. ``I'll be outside and I'll hear
shots. I get really scared and I start panicking. I run to the
closest place I can find.''
   Kareem Pope, 13, said his mother wants him to stay inside their
apartment when he's not in school.
   ``The place is terrible,'' he said. ``They should take the guns
away from people. There's guns and more guns all the time.''
   Also on Sunday in Brooklyn, 15-year-old Salima Brown was shot in
the leg as she stood with a group of friends in the
Bedford-Stuyvesant section.
   Brown said shooting at random at groups of youths is ``how they
have fun'' in her neighborhood.
   ``Usually they just shoot to make you run and they start
laughing,'' said Brown, who was treated at a hospital after a
bullet passed through her thigh.

   Tamil rebels shot and killed six
Sinhalese villagers and abducted 20 Moslems in northern and eastern
Sri Lanka, military officials and residents said today.
   The villagers were killed Monday night when a force of about 40
rebels raided the predominantly Sinhalese village of Gajabapura,
150 miles northeast of Colombo, the officials said. They said the
rebels had planned a massacre but were beaten back by
government-armed home guard units and villagers.
   The dead included a family of four and two elderly men, said the
officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. At least 10 homes
were burned by the rebels.
   The 20 Moslems, all males, were abducted early today from
Ullikulam village, eight miles south of the town of Batticaloa,
residents said. The residents, contacted by telephone, said they
heard gunshots shortly after rebels raided homes and seized the
Moslems, but the fate of the captives was not immediately clear.
   The village residents spoke on condition of anonymity.
   On Friday, Moslem home guards allegedly hacked to death at least
16 Tamil villagers at Podukudiyirru colony, seven miles east of
Batticaloa.
   Tamil politicians Monday demanded the disbanding of Moslem home
guards and accused the government of being indifferent to the
killings.
   Elsewhere, the military said seven Tamil rebels were shot and
killed Monday in skirmishes with government troops in the north and
east.
   At least 14,000 people have died since Tamil militia began a
campaign in 1983 against the Sinhalese-dominated government to
carve out a separate Tamil homeland in the north and east of the
island.
   The mainly Hindu Tamils, who make up 18 percent of the island's
16 million people, have long accused the Sinhalese, who make up 75
percent of the population, of discrimination.
   In another development, the government said it would investigate
allegations that Israel simultaneously trained Sri Lanka's security
forces and the Tamil guerrillas they were fighting.
   A statement from President Ranasinghe Premadasa's office said
the probe was ordered after the allegations appeared in a book by a
former member of the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad.
   The Israeli government has said the book, ``By Way of Deception:
The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer,'' by Victor Ostrovsky,
is full of lies.

<HEAD>Bush Asks Senate to Approve Treaty Ending Division of Germany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush today asked the Senate to
swiftly approve an historic treaty ending the division of Germany
and relinquishing all rights and responsibilities of the four
victorious powers from World War II.
   Bush called the accord ``the culmination of more than four
decades of Western resolve and determination, from the darkest
hours of the Cold War to the bright new horizons that stretch
before us.''
   At a ceremony in the Rose Garden, Bush signed a letter formally
transmitting the treaty to the Senate. Secretary of State James A.
Baker III and West German Ambassador Juergen Ruhfus witnessed the
signing.
   The treaty was signed in Moscow on Sept. 12 by the United
States, Soviet Union, Britain and France after six months of
negotiations. The four powers will formally retain their rights
over Germany until they all have ratified the treaty. However, the
four countries agreed to ``suspend'' their rights Oct. 1, two days
before Germany becomes unified through the merging of East and West
Germany.
   ``It is wholly fitting that Germany formally and irrevocably
achieve its unified status at the earliest possible moment,
unfettered by four-power rights, shared by the Soviet Union, which
are now outmoded and unnecessary,'' Bush's letter said.
   After the defeat of the Nazis in 1945, the four allies divided
Germany and its capital into four occupation zones, which became
East and West Germany and East and West Berlin.
   The treaty ends the division of the country and calls for the
Soviet Union to complete the withdrawal of its estimated 370,000
troops from East Germany by 1994. U.S., British and French troops
will remain stationed in Berlin during the interim.
   In his remarks, Bush said the treaty ``will end the artificial
division of Germany and Berlin and it will restore to Germany
sovereignty over all its territory and end all remaining four power
rights and responsibilities.
   ``This agreement clears the way to achievement of the goal we
Americans have long shared with the German people, a united,
democratic and sovereign Germany,'' the president said.
   In his letter to the Senate, Bush said the treaty ``represents a
major achievement for our German allies, who have not forgotten the
past or the role Germany once played in the horrors of 1933-45, but
who have demonstrated over four decades of steadfast support for
democracy and the Western alliance what the world can expect from
the united Germany.''

   A tour bus carrying members of a senior center
on a gambling junket hit a car and overturned down an embankment,
killing one person and seriously injuring 13, authorities said.
   Heavy rain was falling when the car skidded on U.S. 395 and the
bus ran into it, according to Nevada Highway Patrol Sgt. Marvin
Davenport. The Majestic Tours bus was carrying senior citizens from
Norwalk, Calif., to Bally's Resort-Hotel in Reno, about 10 miles
north of the accident site.
   The driver of the car, Lynne Hammill, an off-duty highway patrol
officer, was pronounced dead on arrival at Washoe Medical Cente
shortly after the accident Monday afternoon.
   The bus driver, Greg Armenta, 27, said Hammill's southbound car
appeared to spin out of control on the rain-slicked road.
   ``I tried to avoid hitting it, but I couldn't get out of the
way,'' Armenta said. ``After that, I don't know what happened. I
tried to control the bus, but I couldn't.''
   The bus overturned down an embankment.
   One passenger was listed in serious condition today; 12 others
were in fair or stable condition. Many of the remaining 45 bus
passengers were treated for minor cuts, bruises and sprains and
released, hospital officials said.

<HEAD>Keating's Lawyers Appeal $5 Million Bail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state appeals court will decide whether
jailed savings and loan executive Charles H. Keating's $5 million
bail is excessive in a criminal fraud case involving the collapse
of his Lincoln Savings.
   Keating, 66, contends he is being made a scapegoat, is broke and
cannot defend himself against the host of lawsuits against him if
he is locked up.
   ``He is more than $5 million in debt. He has no assets that are
not already pledged to creditors. At most, Keating could post a
$500,000 bail, and then only through the help of his children,''
his lawyers said in papers filed with the state appeals court
Monday.
   After a two-day hearing last week, Superior Court Judge Gary
Klausner refused to lower the $5 million bail, saying the charges
against him are so serious he might flee.
   That amount is far too high for Keating to meet and 50 times
higher than the bail imposed in identical cases, his lawyers said.
   They said he has shown he is no flight risk by never dodging any
proceeding against him, even though he's known for a year he was
under criminal as well as civil investigation.
   It wasn't clear when the 2nd District Court of Appeal would
issue a decision on the bail appeal.
   Three other defendants are free. They had their bails lowered
from the original $1 million each to $100,000 or $200,000, which
they posted.
   All four are due back in court Oct. 5 to enter a plea to charges
of defrauding investors in Irvine-based Lincoln.
   Keating and three former top officers of his companies are
charged with misleading investors about the safety of risky junk
bonds sold at Lincoln branches. The bonds were issued by Lincoln's
parent company, American Continental Corp., which Keating headed.
   Keating and the others are charged with ordering employees to
steer Lincoln depositors away from insured certificates of deposit
and into the bonds. Many of the buyers were elderly and lost their
life savings. All told, 17,458 investors lost more than $250
million, prosecutors said.
   The charges do not address the most central allegations in the
Lincoln case: that he looted the thrift and made huge political
donations to politicians who then pressured regulators to go easy
on Lincoln.
   Private analysts have estimated Lincoln's failure may cost
taxpayers $2 billion. That would make it the most costliest thrift
failure yet, surpassing the $1.7 billion bailout of Miami's
CenTrust Bank.

<HEAD>Sales of Existing Homes Rose 2.1 Percent in August</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of existing homes rose 2.1 percent in
August, continuing a three-month rebound, a real estate trade group
said today. It forecast a slowdown in the fourth quarter because of
rising mortgage rates.
   The National Association of Realtors said house resales totaled
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.40 million units compared to
July's revised 3.33 million rate. Sales rose 0.9 percent in June
from the 1990 low of 3.30 million units in May.
   ``Despite rising rates, the resale market is stable and slightly
better than July,'' said Norman D. Flynn, the Realtors president.
``The strength we see largely is due to people who are buying homes
in less populous areas and recreational areas.''
   However, Realtors chief economist John A. Tuccillo said mortgage
rates will rise during most of the fourth quarter, having a
negative impact on existing-home sales.
   Fixed-rate, 30-year mortgage rates rose from 9.84 percent to
10.24 percent in August, according to the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. They averaged 10.16 percent at the end of last week.
   The Realtors also said the national median existing-home price
was $97,000 in August, down 1.3 percent from July but up 1.3
percent from a year earlier. The median means half of the homes
cost more, half less.
   Flynn said a decrease in the national median home price from
July to August indicates sellers are bringing down prices in
response to rising interest rates.
   ``This is a typical occurrence,'' he said.
   Sales climbed 6.9 percent to 1.40 million in the South, where
the median price was $86,900. They rose 2.2 percent to 950,000
units in the Midwest. The median price there was $75,000.
   But sales fell 1.8 percent in the sluggish Northeast to 550,000
units. The median price in the Northeast was $144,900. They also
dropped 3.8 percent to 530,000 units in the West, where the median
price was $141,600.

   A Saudi civilian was killed and six
people, including four U.S. Marines, were injured in a two-vehicle
collision on a Saudi expressway, U.S. military officials said
today.
   They said the accident, involving a civilian taxi and a Marine
vehicle, occurred Monday afternoon on the six-lane highway 18 miles
north of Jubail, a major oil port on the Persian Gulf.
   A statement issued by U.S. officials said the Saudi victim was
``pronounced dead at the scene of the accident,'' and the six
injured were taken to a military hospital.
   The unidentified civilian was the first Saudi citizen reported
killed in an incident involving American military personnel since
the buildup in Operation Desert Shield began in early August.
   Four Americans are known to have died; three in mishaps
involving military vehicles and one aboard a U.S. navy ship.
   One of the two Saudis injured was listed in critical condition
with multiple injuries and trauma. The other was reported in stable
condition with skull fractures, the statement said.
   Three of the Marines were admitted for observation with injuries
ranging from concussion to cuts. The fourth Marine was treated for
minor injuries and released.
   The names of the injured Marines were withheld until their next
of kin had been informed. The statement said the cause of the
accident was being investigated.
   The type of Marine vehicle involved was not disclosed.

<HEAD>Jurors Find in Favor of Plaintiff In Tobacco Trial But Give No
Award</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jurors agreed that smoking killed a man
whose family pursued a $17 million wrongful death lawsuit against
the American Tobacco Co. and a distributor, but they did not award
any financial damages.
   ``We decided both parties were at fault,'' said David Roach,
foreman for the 12 Lafayette County jurors. ``We came to a decision
we could all live with when viewing the alternative of a hung
jury.''
   Roach said he and eight other jurors ``thought the American
Tobacco Co. acted in an irresponsible way. It was a very close
decision. We were fairly near a hung jury, frankly.''
   The jury decided 9-3 Monday that 35 years of smoking two packs
of cigarettes a day had caused the 1987 lung cancer death of
50-year-old Nathan Henry Horton.
   The jurors, half of them smokers, heard 11 days of testimony
about smoking risks and whether Horton ran them by choice.
Deliberations began Monday and took about 5{ hours.
   The suit, filed by Horton and continued by his family, named the
American Tobacco Co. and Greenwood distributor New Deal Tobacco and
Candy Co.
   A first trial ended in a mistrial last year when jurors could
not reach a verdict.
   It was considered the most significant such case since a New
Jersey jury awarded a widower $400,000 in 1988 after deciding a
cigarette company was partly responsible for his wife's death from
lung cancer. In that case, an appeals court this year overturned
the award and ordered a new trial.
   After Monday's verdict, Horton family attorney Don Barrett of
Lexington asked Circuit Judge Eugene Bogen to award some sort of
damages. He also asked for a new trial on the issue of punitive
damages.
   Bogen said he would rule later.
   Horton's widow, Ella Mae Horton of Lexington, refused to answer
questions as she left the courtroom.
   Tobacco company lawyers said the verdict showed jurors were
unwilling to decide whether Horton or cigarettes were more
responsible for his death.
   One of them, Jim Upshaw, told jurors in closing arguments Monday
that Horton was a ``risk-taker and he made a free choice to
smoke.''
   The family's attorneys contended Horton he was unaware of the
magnitude of the risks.
   The Hortons wanted $2 million in actual damages and $15 million
in punitive damages.
   Warning labels have been required on cigarette packages since
1966.

<TEXT>
   Entertainment giant MCA Inc., parent of
Universal Studios, confirmed today that it is in buyout talks after
a newspaper identified the potential suitor as Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co. of Japan.
   The news sent the company's stock price soaring 67 percent.
   The Wall Street Journal said people it did not identify who were
familiar with the talks said the huge Japanese consumer electronics
manufacturer was considering acquiring MCA for $80 to $90 a share,
or a range of about $6.7 billion to $7.5 billion.
   In Japan today, a Matsushita official who spoke on condition of
anonymity said MCA is one of the companies with which Matsushita is
involved in talks, but that nothing has been decided.
   Later, MCA issued a statement in which it confirmed it is ``in
discussions with a major international company regarding a possible
negotiated acquisition of MCA.''
   ``The discussions are continuing on a friendly basis. No
agreement has been reached. There is no assurance that an agreement
will be reached,'' the statement said.
   If the deal materialized, it would be the second major
transaction in which a Japanese manufacturer of electronic hardware
acquired a U.S. maker of entertainment programs.
   Last year, Sony Corp. acquired Columbia Pictures Entertainment
Inc. for $5 billion. The deal stirred criticism about Japanese
control of American assets. MCA, based in Universal City, Calif.,
is the parent of Universal Studios and produces films and TV shows
in addition to having interests in publishing and theme parks.
   MCA stock has been trading well below the deal price, and its
shares rocketed higher today on the New York Stock Exchange. MCA
climbed $23 to $57.50 a share when trading opened.
   Matsushita's brands include Panasonic, Technics and Quasar. The
company had revenue of about $44.4 billion in the year ended March
31.
   The Journal report said individuals with knowledge of the talks
cautioned that it was far from certain that a deal would
materialize.
   They said that regulatory barriers that did not figure in the
Sony-Columbia deal remain. MCA, for instance, owns an independent
television station, WWOR in Secaucus, N.J., which a foreign company
would be prevented from owning.
   MCA earned $191.77 million on revenue of $3.38 billion last
year, a 16 percent increase over earnings of $164.91 million and
$$2.90 billion in revenue during 1988.

<TEXT>
   The Marine Corps has grounded four Harrier
jets, similar to those deployed in Saudi Arabia, because of faulty
sensors that help stabilize the fighter-bombers, the service said
today.
   Col. Stuart Wagner said the jets, which can take off vertically
and hover like helicopters, were found to have defective ``rate
sensor assemblies.'' The assemblies are equivalent to the power
steering on a car.
   ``It's not critical to flying the aircraft safely, but it's
something we want to fix,'' he said. Officials determined the rate
sensor assemblies made by Northrop Corp. are wearing out faster
than projected.
   Wagner said the grounded Harriers are based at Kaneohe Bay
Marine Corps Air Station in Hawaii. The defects, he said, will have
no effect on the Harriers sent to Saudi Arabia in response to
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The spokesman did not know when the Harriers were grounded or
how long they would be out of commission.
   Northrop pleaded guilty in February to 34 fraud charges of
improperly testing the sensors and a cruise missile guidance system
for the Air Force.
   The Harrier groundings were first reported today by The New York
Times and the Los Angeles Times. The Marines' fleet of nearly 200
AV-8B Harriers was expected to come up during a hearing today
before the House Committee on Government Operations.
   ``We simply don't know whether the weapons will do their job,''
said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., a committee member. ``We may
find that some of what our soldiers depend upon will not perform up
to specification. It may threaten the lives of many of our men and
women in uniform.''
   No spare sensor assemblies are available, forcing the Marines to
park the $22 million planes as problems arise. No other company
produces the assemblies.
   A fifth Harrier was to be grounded soon and the grounding of the
rest of the fleet was scheduled at a rate of three planes every two
months, the newspapers said.
   Last year, Northrop was suspended from receiving new contracts
for the sensor, among other products.
   Northrop officials said Monday they had no knowledge of the
groundings.

   Crude oil is within striking distance of $40 a
barrel, which would be equal to the record set 10 years ago and
twice the price before the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``One piece of fresh news, and $40 is there,'' Dean Witter
Reynold  Inc. trader Ed Kevelson predicted Monday, after crude
futures crossed the $39 threshold for the first time on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
   The price of light sweet crude, the benchmark grade, peaked for
the day Monday at $39.20 before settling at $38.25 for November
delivery, a record close on the exchange, which began trading crude
futures in 1983.
   The oil markets slowed a bit this morning, with light sweet
crude trading 5 cents higher at $38.30 a barrel in early trading.
   ``We've just seen people step back,'' Ann-Louise Hittle, a
senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., said today.
``There really isn't fresh news from the Middle East.''
   Monday's rise came just a week after oil futures had first hit
$33 per barrel on the exchange, setting off a steady climb that has
shattered records in days or even hours.
   The surge Monday was set off by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
statement that he would rather go to war than let the U.N. trade
embargo strangle his country.
   ``Because of that radio broadcast on Sunday, people are
anticipating much higher costs in the future,'' Hittle had said
Monday. ``People in the market are talking about $40 a barrel as
being the next target.''
   That would be almost double the price before Iraq invaded Kuwait
Aug. 2 and right at the level of cash prices that were paid in
1980, after the Iranian revolution.
   Higher oil creates a threat of inflation and typically leads to
increases in gasoline prices at the pump. An industry survey
released Sunday said the average price at the pump hit an all-time
high of more than $1.38 a gallon, up about 20 cents since the
invasion.
   But $40 oil today would not be as expensive, in
inflation-adjusted terms, as $40 oil was in 1980.
   Oil would have to hit about $57 per barrel in 1990 dollars to
equal the real cost of oil from a decade earlier, said Philip L.
Dodge, an analyst with Nomura Securities International Inc.
   That is not far from the figure of $60 per barrel that some
groups have used as an estimate for how high oil prices could rise
during a shooting war in the Mideast.
   ``If there's a shooting war, the sky's the limit until
governments step in and put in price controls and rationing and all
that,'' Dodge said.
   Some experts have pointed out that gasoline has thus far not
kept up with the rise in crude during the crisis.
   ``Forty dollars for crude oil is up about $20 from where it was
before all this unpleasantness got started,'' Dodge said. ``That
$20 increase is about 48 cents per gallon, and so far, the price of
gasoline is only up about half of that. It eventually could go up
another 25 cents.''

<TEXT>
   The Texas system of financing schools
remains unconstitutional despite this year's overhaul by the
Legislature, a judge ruled today.
   State District Judge Scott McCown said the $14 billion-a-year
system is still flawed. But he deferred making any immediate
changes, giving the Legislature until Sept. 1, 1991, to act.
   ``Our need for education is too great and our wealth too modest
for inequitable funding our schools to be tolerated,'' McCown
wrote.
   The judge said the finance system doesn't give all schools
``substantially equal'' access to funds.
   The Texas Supreme Court ruled unanimously last October that
there were ``glaring disparities'' between rich and poor school
districts, violating a requirement in the state Constitution for an
``efficient system'' of public schools.
   Schools were funded with local property taxes, state aid and a
small amount of federal funds. But because of disparities in
property wealth, annual spending per student among districts ranged
from $2,112 to $19,333, the court said.
   The new school finance plan was adopted in June by the
Legislature after four special sessions. Lawmakers anted up an
additional $528 million for public schools in 1990-91 and made
numerous changes that backers said would improve education.
   But poor school districts challenged the new funding plan. They
argued that it was no different from the old system.
   The state will appeal today's ruling, Gov. Bill Clements said.
   ``I don't agree with his judgment at all,'' Clements said.
``He's a young judge. Perhaps the Supreme Court in its review will
reconsider that opinion.''
   Kevin O'Hanlon, a lawyer for the Texas Education Agency, said
the 52-page decision didn't give state officials enough direction
on how fix the system.
   ``He held it unconstitutional because it wasn't good enough, but
he didn't give us a heck of a lot of guidance on what would be good
enough,'' said O'Hanlon, a former assistant attorney general.
   He said that unless the courts tell the state how to make a
constitutional system, the litigation could last for years.
   Rick Gray, a lawyer for poor school districts that challenged
the school funding system, applauded the ruling. He said McCown did
``a very exhaustive, thorough analysis. ... We think it's a great
day for all schoolchildren and we hope the Legislature will set
about the task of fixing the system in the future.''
   State Rep. Paul Colbert, a member of the House Public Education
Committee, blamed Clements for blocking an alternative finance plan
that poor school districts would have accepted. Clements killed
that proposal by vetoing the taxes needed to pay for it.
   ``It's entirely because of Gov. Clements' foot-dragging and the
Republican legislators who upheld his veto that we're back in the
court again, and we're literally about to turn over the keys of the
schoolroom to the courts,'' Colbert said.
   Clements killed two school finance reform plans because they
each relied on a half-cent increase in the state sales tax. He
later agreed to a quarter-cent increase in the plan overturned by
today's decision.
   McCown allowed the school finance system to remain in place this
school year. But he retains jurisdiction over the case.
   The judge said that if the Legislature fails to devise a
constitutional school finance plan by next September, he would
consider stopping the spending of state and local tax money, or
imposing a school spending plan.

   U.S. immigration officers began checking passports
Tuesday at London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports in an effort to
reduce long delays clearing customs in the United States, the U.S.
Embassy said.
   The 45 officers will check travel documents on this side of the
Atlantic for four months as part of an expermental program.
   A record number of tourists to the United States has resulted in
routine delays of two hours at busy U.S. airports and waits of up
to five hours for some flights have been reported.
   Passengers from Britain represent a quarter of all international
travelers entering the United States, immigration officials said.
   All passengers on selected flights on nine airlines to New York,
Boston, Dallas, Los Angeles, Cincinnati, Charlotte, Newark and
Miami will be checked before boarding in London. Officers will use
a computer with access to U.S. immigration data.
   If the pilot program is successful, the British Home Office said
it would consider a reciprocal permanent arrangement with
immigration checks in major U.S. airports for travelers to Britain.

   Nine garden benches carved from exotic trees

auction Tuesday for $21,000, Sotheby's auctioneers said.
   The money will go to the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew for

white ash, a 75-foot North American red oak, a tulip tree, a Roble
beech from Chile and a Norway maple.
   One of the oak tree benches did not sell because it failed to
reach the minimum bid amount set by the auctioneers, a Sotheby's

   The other oak bench was sold for $2,170 to an unnamed British
buyer, said the spokeswoman at Sotheby's Billingshurst office,
where the auction was held, 40 miles south of London.
   The tulip tree benches fetched the highest price, Sotheby's
said. A Japanese buyer, bidding by telephone, paid $5,900 for the
pair, the spokeswoman said.

<HEAD>Mulroney Facing Awesome Range of Problems in New Political Season</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney heads
into the new political season with an awesome array of worries
ranging from rebellious Indians and unpopular taxes to threats of a
breakup of the confederation.
   Mulroney is in big trouble with voters, scoring 14 percent or
less in the polls. But the opposition Liberals have been unable to
capitalize on Mulroney's growing unpopularity and were drubbed in
two recent provincial elections.
   Many Canadians feel the country is leaderless and adrift.
   Both Mulroney and Liberal Party leader Jean Chretien slipped out
of sight for most of the summer and both may ultimately suffer for
that.
   Mulroney's government is the most unpopular since the Gallup
organization began taking polls in the country 50 years ago. The
polls say the Progressive Conservatives are favored by only 20
percent of the population.
   At the end of July, Gallup asked Canadians who would make the
best prime minister - Mulroney, Chretien or socialist New
Democratic Party chief Audrey McLaughlin.
   Of those questioned, 30 percent chose Chretien, 18 percent
McLaughlin and 14 percent Mulroney. Thirty-eight percent rejected
all three or said they didn't know which one they liked.
   ``There is a conjunction of events that has made the public
rather cranky about politicians in general, more so than usual,''
said Ron Watts, a professor of political science at Queen's
University and director of the Institute for Intergovernmental
Relations. ``We are going through an unusually bad patch.''
   The bad patch includes:
   -A country sliding into recession.
   -Failure of the Meech Lake agreement to get Quebec to sign the
constitution.
   -A standoff between Mohawk Indians and the army over land
rights.
   -A new 7 percent goods and services tax scheduled to go into
effect in January on virtually everything.
   -The commitment of Canadian ships and fighters in the Persian
Gulf crisis.
   -A series of patronage appointments to the Senate, including
Conservative Nova Scotia Premier John Buchanan, currently under
criminal investigation.
   Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa has formed a commission to study
what steps the French-speaking province should take next -
independence, sovereignty in association with Canada, or some other
form of relationship with the central government. A report is due
next spring.
   To make matters worse, Mulroney's former Quebec lieutenant,
Lucien Bouchard, betrayed him and formed a separatist Bloc
Quebecois in the House of Commons dedicated to independence for
Quebec.
   Mulroney dismisses the bad news in the polls.
   ``What matters is where you are on election night, not some two
or 2{ years before,'' he said.
   But Mulroney's low profile for much of the summer has led many
Canadians to feel he has been avoiding the tough questions.
   ``It seems to have been an eternity this summer, and through all
this, Mr. Mulroney has pulled a disappearing act,'' said Liberal
Jean-Robert Gauthier.
   Chretien, whose showing in the polls has slipped since he won
the Liberal leadership in June, also is suffering.
   Bad news for the Conservatives usually means good news for the
Liberals. But not lately. The fallout has become impossible to
read.
   Both parties were thrashed in the Ontario provincial elections
in August. The socialist New Democrats ousted the Liberals from the
government of Canada's richest province. And in the Manitoba
provincial elections a week later, the Conservatives won a
majority, shoving the Liberals into third place behind the New
Democrats - who are to the left of the Liberals.
   Ontario New Democratic Party leader Bob Rae profited from voter
unhappiness with Liberal Premier David Peterson. That
disgruntlement stemmed partly from new provincial taxes and a
political party financing scandal. But voters appeared to be put
off mainly because Peterson called an unnecessary election two
years early, a move seen as purely self-serving.
   Fringe movements are growing. The rightist Reform Party, a child
of western Canada, recently moved onto the national scene with 6
percent in the polls. Bouchard's Bloc Quebecois has 5 percent.
   ``Ultimately, if we end up with an array of regional parties,
that will seriously weaken the federal system,'' Watts said.
   No matter what one's opinion of Mulroney, he can hardly be
called a do-nothing prime minister, having worked hard for the free
trade agreement with the United States, the goods and services tax
and the Meech Lake agreement.
   ``The trouble is people are not happy with what he is doing,''
Watts said. ``The perception of weakness weakens the leader even if
the leader is not really weak.''
   It seems the Canadian people themselves are unsure of what they
want.
   Said University of Calgary analyst David Bercuson: ``Because
they don't really indicate any overall general direction to the
leadership, the leadership doesn't know what to do.''

Shevardnadze also calling for tribunal to deal with world
terrorists. Pickup 11th, `Secretary..' Security Council session

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze today said that war could break out in the Persian
Gulf at any moment, and called Iraq's invasion of Kuwait an ``act
of terrorism.''
   In a speech to the General Assembly, Shevardnadze referred to
Aug. 2, the date of the invasion, as ``Black Thursday,'' and called
the action ``irrational.''
   ``Iraq flagrantly violated the United Nations Charter, the
principles of international law, the universally recognized norms
of morality and the standards of civilized behavior,'' the minister
said. He spoke in Russian and his remarks were translated into the
many languages of those attending.
   Shevardnadze spoke on the second day of the General Assembly
sesssion. On Monday, leaders from France, Iran, Brazil, Argentina,
Poland and Indonesia condemned Iraq for invading Kuwait and
demanded an immediate pullout.
   The Soviet foreign minister hinted at the possibility of a
United Nations military operation in the gulf region, noting that
``the United Nations has the power to suppress `acts of
aggression.' ''
   ``There is ample evidence that this right can be exercised,'' he
said. But such an step should come only after all peaceful,
non-military forms of pressure have been applied, he said.
   Up until the invasion, the Soviet Union was Iraq's strongest
ally. But the Soviets have firmly sided with the U.S.-led effort to
isolate and pressure the Baghdad government. The Soviets have said
they might be willing to participate in a U.N. military effort in
the gulf provided that the Soviets share command.
   The Soviet foreign minister termed Iraq's actions a ``major
affront to mankind'' and added: ``Unless we find a way to respond
to it and cope with the situation, our civilization will be thrown
back by half a century.''
   ``A great war may break out on the gulf region any day, any
moment. An act of terrorism has been perpetrated against the
emerging new world order.''
   Shevardnadze also called for the creation of an international
tribunal to judge individuals who ``declare the threat ... for
purposes of blackmail of using weapons of mass destruction,
hostage-taking or mass terror.''
   It was a clear reference to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, who
has threatened to destroy Israel if the Security Council's economic
embargo causes his people to suffer, and has moved Western
detainees to strategic sites in Iraq to serve as ``human shields''
against any attack.
   Such a tribunal could also judge those who resort to torture,
terrorism, atrocities, or any other ``grave crimes against
humanity,'' said Shevardnadze.
   Later today, the Soviet minister was to preside over a special
meeting of the Security Council attended by up to 12 foreign
ministers. The session is expected to end with passage of a
resolution extending to air corridors the U.N.-ordered embargo on
trade with Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is expected to fill the
U.S. seat in the 15-member council.
   On Monday, after Shevardnadze and British Foreign Minister
Douglas Hurd held a two-hour private meeting, reporters asked if
the air embargo would be approved. ``I hope so,'' said Hurd.
   Shevardnadze nodded confidently. He said through a translator:
``We want action. There is no other way.''
   ``It is a fairly balanced draft that takes care of the safety of
air flights, but at the same time, continues the idea of sanctions
until Iraq agrees to withdraw from Kuwait,'' said Soviet Ambassador
Yuli Vorontsov, president of the Security Council.
   The air embargo would ask all nations to bar flights to and from
Iraq, but it would not authorize shooting down airplanes.
   On Monday, the council adopted a brief resolution calling for
aid to nations suffering economic hardship from loss of trade with
Iraq. They include Jordan and about a dozen other nations.
   Every speaker who strode to the rostrum of the General Assembly
on Monday denounced Iraq for its Aug. 2 seizure of Kuwait. In his
address, French President Francois Mitterrand declared: ``Kuwait is
a sovereign state, a member of the international community. In the
name of what can one decide that this state has ceased to exist?''
   The Iraqi U.N. Ambassador, Abdul Amir Al-Anbari, listened
impassively at his seat. Iraq's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz,
stayed away after U.S. officials barred him from coming on a
special Iraqi flight.
   Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, told the gathering
that his government would obey all Security Council sanctions and
embargoes targeting Iraq. However, a security and oil industry
sources have said Iran has agreed to provide ``humanitarian'' food
and medicine shipments across the common border with Iraq in return
for 200,000 barrels of refined oil a day.
   Velayati also criticized the U.S. military buildup in the
Persian Gulf region - which intends to counter Iraqi - as
destabilizing.

   Chief Warrant Officer
Charles Rowe shipped out of Beirut a day before the 1983
truck-bombing that killed 241 U.S. serviceman. He had a private vow
for any terrorist who tried it here.
   ``I'll promise you he'll suffer,'' he said. ``We're going to
hurt him.''
   Rowe and fellow Marines guarding a vital port in northeast Saudi
Arabia said no comparisons should be drawn between Lebanon and the
new mission in the Mideast, Operation Desert Shield.
   But they concede their security planning is shrouded by memories
of the Beirut attack.
   ``I wouldn't mind evening the score,'' Rowe said.
   The memories are so strong that the commander of the Persian
Gulf port's security unit that reporters visited on Tuesday said at
times he had to urge superiors not to go overboard with the
precautions.
   ``Any time you overdo it you bring attention to it,'' Lt. Col.
Tom Hayden said. ``Any dumb terrorist can say, `Hey, that looks
important.' I'd just as soon keep a low profile.''
   The port is far from the Iraqi ground forces to the north in
Kuwait and Iraq has no navy to speak of. So Hayden's main worries
are air or terrorist-style ground attacks.
   He says he's confident American fighter jets could turn back any
Iraqi fighters, and the Army is helping the Marines with a Patriot
missile battery at the port designed to destroy any incoming
missiles.
   That leaves a car or truck bombing as the main threat, Hayden
said, adding such an attack could come from a group sponsored by
Iraq's Saddam Hussein or any of the other groups ``who have been
trying to blow up Americans for 10 years.''
   His unit was on maximum alert for several days two weeks ago
after ``we were told something was possible and I reacted to it.''
He said the heightened alert was based on ``one specific piece of
information,'' but refused to discuss it.
   ``We have since lessened and we're at what I would call a
routine posture right now,'' he said.
   Routine still means constant patrols along the Persian Gulf and
the perimeter of the sprawling port, a camp for Marines as well as
a major arrival point for equipment and supplies for the thousands
of American troops here.
   Hayden, like the men below him, tries to steer visitors away
from the Beirut analogy.
   In Lebanon, the Marines were part of a peacekeeping force,
crowded together in a makeshift barracks in an airport
administrative building, ordered not to assume defensive positions
but instead to allow elements of the fractious Lebanese army to
provide their security.
   ``If we could have done in Lebanon what we're doing here it
wouldn't have happened,'' Hayden said.
   Hayden is deploying his security forces as he says it should
have been done in Beirut, if only the Marines there had the
authority to defend themselves.
   ``We'e constantly changing positions, changing patrols and
changing routines,'' Hayden said.
   The Marines also are engaging in a fair share of deception,
setting up mock guard posts and camoflauge tents over junk.
   ``There are some facilities that have guards that have no value
at all,' Hayden said.
   He concedes Marines would make an attractive terrorist target. A
successful attack would send shudders through an American public
that remembers well the Beirut bombing of Oct. 23, 1983, when a
suicide attacker crashed through the Marine barracks' gates in a
bomb-laden truck. Fundamentalist Shiites claimed responsibility.
   Hayden said it would be foolish for terrorists to target the
Marines again.
   ``I think it would be a mistake,'' he said. ``They would look
for a softer spot. It won't happen again.''
   Capt. Wayne Sparks was one of the replacements sent to Beirut
after the bombing. Younger Marines sometimes ask him about his
experience and whether they are as vulnerable.
   ``They ask what the terrorist threat is, what kinds of things
could an enemy do to us,'' said Sparks, 35, of Portsmouth, Ohio.
   Sparks said he had no qualms about returning to the Middle East.
   ``I'm a Marine,'' he said. ``I do what I'm responsible to do and
I don't question it.''
   Rowe said he was satisfied with the security here, which he said
relies on ``dispersion and great vigilance.''
   He says he knew 50 to 60 of the men killed in Beirut just after
he left, and was close friends with a half dozen of them.
   ``I think that every Marine is aware of it and those of us who
were in Beirut are more aware of it,'' Rowe said. ``But you can't
allow it to dominate your life. If you do, you give in to fear and
the terrorist wins.''

   A TV film tonight about Charles Stuart, who
allegedly shot his pregnant wife, summoned police over his car
phone and later apparently killed himself, sacrifices privacy to
profit, the woman's family says.
   ``While we agree that the First Amendment must provide
protection to legitimate journalists, we decry its use as a shield
by those who profit by producing `entertainment' without
authorization,'' Carol Stuart's parents, Giusto and Evelyn DiMaiti,
and her brother, Carl, said in a statement Monday.
   The CBS movie sets a ``dangerous precedent'' that could
sacrifice the privacy of other grieving families for the sake of
movie profits, they said.
   CBS publicist Ed Devlin said the network had no response to make
to the family's criticism. Producer Arnold Shapiro did not
immediately return a telephone call seeking comment today.
   In general, docudramas can be made without the consent of those
involved as long as they stick to public records. Individuals who
sell the rights to their stories to producers essentially sell the
rights to their private stories.
   ``Good Night Sweet Wife: A Murder in Boston'' stars Ken Olin of
``thirtysomething'' as Stuart.
   The movie was produced in association with Arnold Shapiro, who
was taping a segment of the show ``Rescue 911'' in Boston when Mrs.
Start was slain Oct. 30. The rescue of the Stuarts was shown on the
TV program.
   Mrs. Stuart was fatally shot in the head during what her husband
claimed was a robbery by a black man. The white couple's son, who
was delivered prematurely by Caesarean section, died 17 days later.
Stuart was shot in the side but recovered.
   In January, Stuart apparently jumped to his death from a bridge
after learning that his brother, Matthew, had implicated him in his
wife's slaying.
   Public interest in the crime was heightened by a dramatic,
tape-recorded telephone conversation between Stuart and an
emergency dispatcher who tracked down the Stuarts' location to send
an ambulance.
   The crime shocked Bostonians and heightened racial tensions. The
crime's hold on the public imagination grew greater still when it
became clear that the prime suspect was Stuart himself.
   Matthew Stuart's involvement in the slaying remains under
investigation. His lawyer, Nancy Gerttner, said he was distressed
by the movie.
   ``We deeply regret the television portrayal of these events at
this time which are based only on the media accounts, which are
distorted and which are obviously without the participation of any
of the principals,'' Gertner said.
   The DiMaiti family called on anyone profiting from the movie,
including advertisers, to donate money to the Carol DiMaiti Stuart
Foundation. It provides scholarships to youths in Mission Hill, the
poor neighborhood where she was shot.

<HEAD>Economy at Virtual Standstill; Some Say Recession Has Arrived</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's economy nearly came to a
standstill in the second quarter, edging up a feeble annual rate of
0.4 percent, the government said Tuesday. Many of the nation's top
economists believe a recession is imminent - if not under way
already.
   While White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said ``we don't
believe we are in a recession right now,'' he acknowledged the
latest Commerce Department report on the gross national product
``is certainly cause for concern. It's not good news.''
   The department's revised report on the GNP - the nation's total
output of goods and services - was the lowest since a 0.3 percent
rate during the last quarter of 1989 and showed the economy
weakening even before the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``The economy was headed toward a recession before Iraq, and
Iraq was just the nail in the coffin,'' said Allen Sinai, chief
economist for the Boston Co. A recession ``seems inescapable,'' he
said.
   Surveys following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait - and the
subsequent oil-price spiral - showed many top economists
forecasting an imminent recession.
   The National Association of Business Economists reported Tuesday
that more than half of the 71 professional forecasters responding
to its survey in late August and early September said a recession
already has begun or will begin in the fourth quarter of 1990 or
the first quarter of 1991.
   And half of the top economists surveyed each month by Blue Chip
Economic Indicators now believe the economy will enter a recession
this year.
   ``In a sharp revision of earlier views, 50 percent of the 50
panel members replying ... now think the long-delayed recession
will start this year,'' wrote R.J. Eggert, the newsletter's editor.
   ``Of those expecting the recession to begin this year, three
believe it actually began in the second quarter, six expect the
downturn to begin in the current quarter and 16 have pegged the
fourth quarter of this year as the starting date.''
   Sinai pointed to negative economic data already available for
July and August and said, ``It looks like the recession started in
the third quarter.''
   ``The economy ground to a halt in the second quarter and is in
the process of contracting right now,'' added Richard W. Rahn,
chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   A price index tied to the GNP was unchanged at an annual rate of
3.9 percent in the second quarter. But with the surge in oil
prices, inflation as measured in the Consumer Price Index jumped
0.8 percent in August alone. The higher prices will be reflected in
the third-quarter GNP report.
   The price of oil before the Iraqi invasion was less than $20 a
barrel. It reached a record $38 a barrel at one point on Monday.
   Since oil is used in producing so many consumer goods as well as
for heating and transportation, any price increase not only slashes
available funds needed to feed economic growth but also feeds
inflation.
   The department originally had estimated the economy grew at a
1.2 percent rate from April through June, after advances of 1.7
percent in the first quarter and 2.5 percent in 1989 and 4.5
percent in 1988.
   But it said Tuesday that more complete data showed weaker net
exports and lower inventory accumulation than first thought.
   The new data showed net exports declining by $9.2 billion rather
than $4.5 billion, and inventories totaling $19.8 billion rather
than $22.4 billion.
   ``But there really were no areas of strength,'' Sinai said.
   Consumer spending, which represents two-thirds of the nation's
economic activity, rose just 0.2 percent, down from 1.1 percent in
the first quarter. Business investment fell 4.7 percent after a 5
percent gain from January through March.
   Housing construction plunged 11.2 percent after advancing 15.1
percent in the first quarter. Government spending rose 6.2 percent
but most of that was by the federal government. State and local
spending was down 0.6 percent.
   If the economy were in a recession - generally described as two
consecutive quarters of negative growth - it would end the nearly
eight years of expansion that began after the 1981-82 downturn.
   The Commerce Department also reported today that after-tax
corporate profits fell a revised 0.6 percent, worse than the 0.2
percent drop first reported and their poorest showing since a 5.9
percent decline in the third quarter of 1989. They had risen 0.5
percent in the first quarter and 1.7 percent in the final quarter
of 1989.
   The various changes left the GNP growing by $4.5 billion in the
second quarter. After removing the effects of inflation, the GNP
totaled an annual rate of $4.16 trillion.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said today that the
Persian Gulf could be on the verge of war, and he hinted at the
possibility of a U.N. military operation in the region.
   As Shevardnadze spoke on the second day of the 45th General
Assembly, the U.N. Security Council prepared to vote on extending
the naval embargo on Iraq to the air.
   The financial markets, meanwhile, reflected world pessimism over
the possibilty of a settlement in the near future to the Persian
Gulf crisis. Gold prices rose $15 an ounce in Hong Kong, helped the
New York Stock Exchange hit a 14-month low and had oil prices
flirting with $40 a barrel.
   The General Assembly has become a forum for world leaders to
vent their rage at Baghdad.
   In his speech, Shevardnadze referred to Aug. 2, the date of the
invasion, as ``Black Thursday.''
   ``Iraq flagrantly violated the United Nations Charter, the
principles of international law, the universally recognized norms
of morality and the standards of civilized behavior,'' the minister
said.
   He hinted at the possibility of a U.N. military operation,
noting that ``the United Nations has the power to suppress `acts of
aggression.' ''
   Up until the invasion, the Soviet Union was Iraq's strongest
ally. But the Soviets have firmly sided with the U.S.-led effort to
isolate and pressure the Baghdad government.
   ``War may break out on the gulf region any day, any moment,''
Shevardnadze said.
   On Monday, French President Francois Mitterrand issued a strong
message to Iraq.
   ``There is no compromise as long as Iraq does not comply with
resolutions of the Security Council and withdraw from Kuwait. The
sovereignty of that country is not negotiable,'' he told the
assembly.
   But he also held out the possibility of peace.
   ``If Iraq were to withdraw its troops and free the hostages,
everything might be possible,'' Mitterrand said. Iraq is preventing
several thousand Westerners from leaving Kuwait and Iraq.
   Mitterrand was suggesting that after an Iraqi pullout, other
areas of discord in the Middle East could be discussed.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has said he will not consider
abandoning Kuwait unless Israel leaves the Arab territories it has
held since 1967.
   Although every foreign leader who spoke Monday joined Mitterrand
in assailing Iraq, Saddam did not appear to be backing down. The
French Foreign Ministry said today that Iraqi soldiers have taken
two new French nationals hostage in Kuwait and transported them to
an unknown destination.
   There was little indication today of a breakthrough in Tehran,
where Syrian President Hafez Assad, newly aligned with the West
since the crisis broke out, has been tryingto get leaders to pledge
full observance of the U.N. embargo.
   Assad left Tehran today after a four-day visit, but sources said
he failed to get an Iranian pledge not to send food and other
essentials to Iraq.
   Sources close to the Syrian delegation said Tehran reiterated
its pledge to uphold embargo rules, but insisted that the embargo
allows ``humanitarian shipments'' of food.
   On Sunday, Saddam declared he would rather go to war than let a
U.N.-ordered trade embargo ``strangle'' his country. A day later he
insisted that ``Kuwait belongs to Iraq and we will never give it up
even if we have to fight over it for a thousand years.''
   His comments have caused jitters in financial markets, because
oil prices would shoot up if war broke out and more expensive oil
would fuel inflation.
   The price of crude has already almost doubled since Iraq invaded
oil-rich Kuwait on Aug. 2, prompting President Bush to send tens of
thousands of U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia to lead a multinational
force standing up to Saddam.
   In Tokyo, where the market was closed Monday, the Nikkei Stock
Average today closed down 418.51 points, or 1.76 percent. The close
- 23,359.32 - was the index's lowest in 33 months.
   Analysts said that like the skyrocketing oil prices and market
declines elsewhere on Monday, the drop in the Nikkei reflected the
belief among investors that an extensive U.S. conflict with Iraq is
inevitable.
   Oil prices peaked at $39.20 before settling at $38.25 Monday on
the futures market in New York. Some say the price will reach $60
if war breaks out.
   Gold, which shoots up in value in times of uncertaint, rose
$15.03 today in Hong Kong to close at $404.45.
   In New York on Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled
59.41 points to 2,452.97, a 14-month low.
   As leaders from Brazil, Argentina, Poland and Indonesia
condemned Baghdad Monday at the United Nations, Iraq's U.N.
ambassador, Abdul Amir Al-Anbari, listened impassively from his
seat.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz, scheduled to address the
General Assembly next week, was not present. The United States has
not given its permission for an Iraqi Airways flight to bring Aziz'
delegation to New York and Iraq has so far refused to make
arrangements through another carrier.
   In his speech to the assembly, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati criticized both Iraq and the United States, which he
said was using the military buildup to back its imperial designs on
the Persian Gulf region.
   Bush issued his own tough message Monday. After speaking to
about 150 representatives of Arab-American groups in Washington, he
was asked by a participant why he would not talk directly with
Saddam.
   The president said Iraq would have to first pull out of Kuwait,
restore the former Kuwaiti leadership and assure the safety of
Americans.
   ``We're not going to yield one inch on those provisions,'' he
said.
   In other developments:
   -The exiled emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, left
today for New York for his first public appearance outside Saudi
Arabia since Iraq invaded his country. Sheik Jaber is to address
the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday and meet Bush on Friday.
   -A squadron of Italian fighter planes took off for the United
Arab Emirates. The Italian government said the eight Tornado will
provide air cover for the country's naval task force.
   -A Saudi civilian was killed and six people, including four U.S.
Marines, were injured in a two-vehicle collision Monday on a Saudi
expressway, U.S. military officials said today.

   Amy Irving wasn't sure she wanted to return
to the stage less than five months after giving birth, but the
producers made her a deal she couldn't refuse.
   ``My initial instinct was to say, `No, I want to stay home with
the baby,' '' said the actress during a rehearsal break from Wendy
Wasserstein's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, ``The Heidi
Chronicles.''
   As she spoke, she cradled 4{-month-old Gabriel, her son with
Brazilian director Bruno Barreto. Barreto directed Miss Irving's
recent film ``Show of Force.''
   The Ahmanson Theater, which is presenting ``The Heidi
Chronicles,'' arranged for a nursery next to Miss Irving's dressing
room and found rehearsal space near the home of her mother, actress
Priscilla Pointer.
   In addition, they slated rehearsals around the kindergarten
schedule of Miss Irving's 5-year-old son, Max, from her marriage to
Steven Spielberg.
   The production will run Oct. 14-Dec. 23 at the UCLA James A.
Doolittle Theater in Hollywood.
   Miss Irving plays the character Heidi Holland during the years
1965-1989. Heidi is an art historian and feminist who finds her
beliefs challenged by the changing times.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Gene Nelson, who tap-danced his way to
stardom in films such as ``Oklahoma'' and ``Lullaby of Broadway,''
says the popularity of rock 'n' roll nearly destroyed the art form
that made him famous.
   Nelson on Monday became the 1,919th actor to be honored with a
star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
   Nelson, 70, says the rise of rock 'n' roll and, later, country
music, led to the demise of the extravagant musical films that
showcased dancers.
   ``It's improving, thanks to Gregory Hines and others. These
people have been very important in the preservation of tap dance as
an art form,'' Nelson said before the ceremony on Hollywood
Boulevard. ``It's a tough row to hoe because rock 'n' roll and
country and western have taken over. They win all the music awards.
There are no more musical movies, really.''
   Nelson's other film credits include ``Tea for Two,'' ``West
Point Story'' and ``Follies.''

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Country singer Patty Loveless is coming
out in the open about her relationship with record producer Emory
Gordy Jr.: They're married.
   Loveless, whose current hit is ``On Down The Line,'' married
Gordy in Gatlinburg in February 1989.
   Loveless, 33, revealed her secret in interviews with People
magazine and on The Nashville Network's ``Crook &amp; Chase'' show,
scheduled to air Wednesday night.
   Loveless said one reason she had kept her marriage secret is
that she wanted to make it in Nashville on her own and not with the
help of Gordy's connections.
   Besides producing records, Gordy has played bass and other
instruments on the albums of Emmylou Harris and other country
artists.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Actor Corey Feldman, who recently underwent
drug abuse treatment, was charged with heroin possession following
his second narcotics-related arrest since March.
   Feldman, whose voice is heard in the ``Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles'' movie, was charged Monday. Arraignment was scheduled for
Oct. 1 in Van Nuys Municipal Court.
   Feldman, who has appeared in such films as ``Stand by Me'' and
``Gremlins,'' had been scheduled to be in British Columbia on Oct.
1 to begin filming the movie ``Cafe Romeo,'' publicist Jeff
Sullivan said.
   Los Angeles police detained the 19-year-old actor in North
Hollywood on Thursday night after responding to a call of a
possible auto theft, Sgt. Gil Rivera said.
   The actor was taken into custody after a check showed he was
wanted for three outstanding traffic warrants, police said.
   During a prebooking search, police found two balloons containing
one-third of a gram of heroin in Feldman's socks, Rivera said. The
actor was freed on $5,000 bail.
   Feldman was arrested during a traffic stop in March after police
officers found heroin and cocaine in his car, authorities said. He
pleaded innocent to charges of possessing heroin and cocaine for
sale and had finished a drug rehabilitation program following that
arrest, said narcotics Detective Robert Holcomb.

<TEXT>
   The last leader of a sovereign East Germany
said Tuesday his people are truly afraid as they prepare to join
the competitive, free-thinking and robust society next door.
   Lothar de Maiziere, in a wide-ranging talk with The Associated
Press board, said his nation's 16 million people will need help to
thrive in a new world based on initiative and free enterprise.
   He said East Germans, forced to live in a Communist society for
four decades, have grown accustomed to a life in which their
futures - and their jobs - were largely preordained by the
government.
   Although most East Germans desperately desire the German
unification that takes place Oct. 3, de Maiziere said they realize
they will be expected to take control of their individual
destinies.
   ``The future in the past meant the future prescribed by the
Politburo,'' he said. ``Now the people see their future is not a
prescribed time, but a free time. This is something people did not
learn, and they are afraid of that.''
   He said the government of a united Germany must have a ``strong
social consciousness'' to help East Germans make the transition and
avoid becoming a second-class population.
   De Maiziere, a 50-year-old lawyer, will turn over to West
Germany the leadership of his nation in just eight days.
   He was East Germany's first freely chosen leader and guided it
through a rocky, six-month period of tough negotiations on the
terms and timing of unification.
   He said he has made no decision on whether to accept one of the
four new Cabinet posts that will be filled by East Germans in the
newly expanded government of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   But de Maiziere said he has viewed his role as prime minister as
that of a lawyer representing a very large client, and he would
accept a similar role in a united Germany.
   He defended his people, who critics say will be bringing nothing
to a united Germany but debts, social problems, a questionable work
ethic and a crumbling economy.
   He said East Germans did not choose their system, which was
imposed by the Soviets and remains a legacy of the war started by
the Nazis. The nation, de Maiziere said, is part of German history
and the cradle of the culture that gave the world Bach, Goethe and
Handel.
   He said the former Communist secret police that entwined the
nation for 40 years remains one of the old regime's ``most
difficult legacies.''
   Tens of thousands of people worked for the dreaded security
apparatus, which compiled intimate dossiers on 6 million people.
   He said German law enforceent officials should have access to
those files to punish people who committed crimes for the secret
police, and to help others whose lives were ruined by it.
   But there should not be wide public access because the
information contained in them could be damaging, divisive and
distorted, de Maiziere said.
   About 5,000 secret police workers were used exclusively to
listen to telephone conversations, he said, and the details in the
files not only contain political views but reveal whether people
were faithful to their spouses.
   Each file on a particular person also contains, on average, the
names and activities of 40 to 50 other people who came in contact
with that person.
   De Maiziere said he chose not to read his own file when
questions arose about whether he cooperated with the secret police,
but allowed respected leaders to do it for him. He was subsequently
cleared.
   He also said he hoped for a political solution in the Persian
Gulf crisis, and believes a united Germany will refute critics who
say it is too preoccupied with itself to assume a role of global
leadership.
   He credited President Bush, former President Reagan and Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for creating the political climate
that made German unity possible.

   Sheriff's deputies lobbed ``flash-bang''
grenades into a McDonald's to divert a gunman and stormed the
restaurant early today, rescuing the last of 20 people held hostage
up to seven hours, authorities said.
   None of the hostages was injured, authorities said. The suspect
was taken into custody.
   The Los Angeles County sheriff's SWAT team, which never made
contact with the gunman, got help from an 18-year-old assistant
manager of the restaurant who hid in the kitchen. Ramiro Gironas
spied on the gunman, reporting his movements by telephone
throughout the standoff, authorities said.
   ``All I know was to take care of my people, my crew,'' Gironas
said. ``I'm glad I'm safe and that all my people are safe. I'm not
a hero. I just did what I had to.''
   Some hostages, including a 3-year-old girl and an 85-year-old
woman, had been forced to lie on the floor under tables at the
after-school hangout, authorities said. Several children were among
the hostages, La Verne police Lt. Jim Crawford said.
   The gunman had fled to the McDonald's from a holdup at a nearby
clothing store and took the hostages about 5:30 p.m. Monday. A
second participant in the earlier robbery was arrested outside the
McDonald's as the standoff began, authorities said.
   Six hours later, SWAT officers rescued 12 hostages from the
restaurant basement, authorities said.
   Shortly after midnight, they said, ``flash-bang'' grenades
intended to disorient with a burst of light and noise were used to
divert the gunman. Then, a deputy seized him and rescued the last
eight hostages.
   ``They were able to get inside without being detected,''
sheriff's Deputy Bill Wehner said. ``A deputy leaped over the
counter and took the suspect into custody.''
   Some of the freed hostages and onlookers broke into applause as
authorities took the suspect Douglas Girard, to a command post.
   The freed hostages were taken to nearby Lutheran High School,
where Deputy Dick Dinsmoor said they would get a chance to talk to
a psychologist. The children were given teddy bears, he said.
   The sheriff's department revised the number of hostages inside
the restaurant several times before finally settling on 20, said
sheriff's Deputy Roger Hom.
   Girard, 32, of San Jacinto and his alleged accomplice, Frank M.
Teresi, 38, of Anaheim, were booked for investigation of armed
robbery and false imprisonment, Hom said. Bail for Girard was set
at $500,000; no bail was set for Teresi because he is on parole for
robbery and being under the influence of a narcotic.
   Girard was treated at Pomona Valley Hospital for slight facial
injuries he suffered while being arrested, Hom said.
   A .38-caliber revolver was recovered inside the restaurant, said
police Sgt. John Ortega.
   It was earlier believed two gunmen were inside the restaurant,
authorities said.
   Negotiators had struggled to reach the gunman by telephone but
never made contact to learn whether he had any demands.
   The sheriff's 18-member Special Enforcement Team had been called
in to negotiate for the hostages' reease. Dozens of police
officers surrounded the restaurant.
   La Verne is about 25 miles northeast of Los Angeles.
   Gironas said he communicated with the 12 people in the basement
with a headset used by workers at the drive-up window.
   McDonald's employee Anis Hussain, 25, was among 11 restaurant
employees and one customer in the basement. He said the group
remained calm.
   ``It was hot down there, but no one cried and no one got
hysterical,'' Hussain said.
   Hussain recalled that when the man came into the restaurant, a
gun in his back pocket, ``he bought a couple of Big Macs, some
french fries and something to drink'' before taking the hostages.

   Ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
and her political foes launched campaigns Tuesday for next month's
elections, which are seen as a forum on whether her government was
wrongly dismissed.
   Ms. Bhutto's 20-month-old government was forced out Aug. 6 on
charges of corruption, incompetence and abuse of power. She has
been ordered to stand trial next week before a special one-judge
court in the eastern city of Lahore on charges of corruption and
misconduct.
   The army-backed caretaker government on Tuesday filed corruption
charges against Ms. Bhutto's father-in-law and two more former
Cabinet ministers.
   A special tribunal in Karachi is scheduled to decide later this
week whether Ms. Bhutto must stand trial on two other corruption
charges. If convicted by the tribunal, she could be disqualified
from next month's poll and barred from politics for seven years.
   The elections set for Oct. 24, three years ahead of schedule,
are seen as a referendum on President Ghulam Ishaq Khan's decision
to dismiss Ms. Bhutto's government. He used constitutional powers
to do so, but she called it a thinly veiled coup.
   The alliance opposing Ms. Bhutto, known as the Islami Jamhoori
Ittehad, or Islamic Democratic Alliance, is scrambling to prop up a
crumbling alliance long enough to defeat her in next month's
election.
   The alliance cut deals with smaller parties spanning the range
of the ideological spectrum, from Islamic fundamentalism to secular
socialism.
   ``This is a fight against Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party,''
said Ijaz ul-Haq, campaign manager for the alliance and son of the
late Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, who ruled Pakistan for 11 years
until his death in a 1988 plane crash. ``There is so much pressure
on everyone that we have to fight together to get the People's
Party out.''
   Alliance leader Nawaz Sharif launched its campaign at an
election rally at the eastern village of Gujranwala in Pakistan's
populous Punjab Province.
   Ms. Bhutto, who won election in November 1988 and became the
first woman to lead a modern Moslem nation, is a candidate for five
seats in the 217-member National Assembly, the policy-making lower
house of Parliament.
   The former prime minister said her party will participate in the
elections even if she herself is disqualified.
   ``If I'm stopped from taking part, don't lose heart. Work to
make the party successful,'' she told a crowd of about 4,000
supporters on Tuesday in a village on the outskirts of Karachi, her
hometown.
   Ms. Bhutto has vehemently denied any wrongdoing and repeatedly
accused the president of corruption and nepotism.
   The caretaker government has spent much of the past month trying
to portray Ms. Bhutto's administration as the most corrupt in
Pakistan's 43-year history.
   But many Pakistanis consider the special tribunals like the ones
that will consider her case to be kangaroo courts, and say the
scenario evokes memories of Ms. Bhutto's father.
   The late Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was overthrown in a 1977 coup, and
a special tribunal ordered him hanged in 1979.

<HEAD>Fewer Reserves Than Expected Likely to Get Call for Active Duty</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Subs 2nd graf with 2 grafs to update with additional Army
reserve callups due for Thursday</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon is continuing to activate reserve
forces for Operation Desert Shield, but the total call-up is likely
to fall well short of the 50,000 authorized by Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney, military sources say.
   The Pentagon today said call-ups of reserves from all services
have reached 21,970, an increase of 317 from its previous tally
announced last week.
   Pete Williams, the chief Pentagon spokesman, said another 4,620
Army National Guard and Army Reserve members will be called up on
Thursday, rassing the total to 26,590.
   Spokesman Maj. Doug Hart said the latest tally included a
decline of 156 in the previously announced total for the Army. He
said this was due to a counting error in the Pentagon's earlier
tally. The Navy's total rose by 183, the Coast Guard added 290 and
the Air Force total was unchanged.
   Additional callups late this week are expected to bring the
service-wide total to about 26,000.
   President Bush authorized use of the reserves on Aug. 22. It is
the first reserve call-up since the Vietnam war.
   Cheney told a House committee last week that he expected nearly
50,000 reserves to be on active duty by Sept. 30, but a military
source said Monday the total is unlikely to exceed 40,000 and that
it would take several more weeks to reach even that total. The
source spoke on condition he not be identified.
   ``It's not going to be anywhere near'' the 50,000 figure
projected by Cheney, the source said, unless war with Iraq breaks
out. In the case of war the Pentagon would be expected to activate
far more reserves, including combat units.
   It was not immediately clear whether the services had scaled
back their original projections of how many reserves would be
needed or whether Cheney had miscalculated.
   In response to a reporter's inquiry, the Pentagon issued a
statement Monday evening saying Cheney's original approval of the
call-up plan was ``designed to allow the services a maximum amount
of flexibility'' to meet their needs.
   ``At present, it is not possible to forecast whether the needs
of the services will come up'' to the nearly 50,000 total
authorized by Cheney, the statement said.
   Bush's decision to mobilize the reserves marked an important
political moment in the administration's campaign to try to force
Iraq's army out of Kuwait.
   ``Weekend warriors'' from around the country have been forced to
leave their jobs, families and communities to provide medical,
transportation, airlift and other services in support of Operation
Desert Shield in the gulf region.
   Those placed on active duty are obliged to serve 90-day tours,
and the period can be extended another 90 days if Cheney decides
the extra help is needed.
   When Cheney signed an order Aug. 23 approving a reserve
activation plan, his spokesman, Pete Williams, said as many as
49,703 reserves could be placed on active duty by Oct. 1. He said
the actual number was likely to be about 46,000 because the Marine
Corps did not plan to use the 3,000 reserves it was allowed to
call.
   Williams stressed that the services would call up ``only what we
need and only when we need it,'' but the total was likely to be
near the figure authorized by Cheney.
   Last week the Army, Navy and Air Force activated more than 7,000
reserves, and the Army announced that it had alerted 24 reserves
units in 13 states and Puerto Rico to prepare for activation.

   The European Community's chief executive Tuesday
challenged German leaders to pledge that the merger of East and
West would not weaken their support for European economic union.
   ``Are the Germans truly interested in economic and monetary
union?'' asked Jacques Delors, president of the European
Commission. ``We need clear, unambiguous political commitments. ...
Without them, there is a risk of a weak Europe with a strong
Germany in its midst.''
   Delors' unusually blunt remarks, at a forum on Germany's future
role in Europe, reflected apprehensions among Western European
leaders about the consequences of German unification next week.
   Some, such as British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, fear
Germany will aggressively dominate a unified Western Europe. Others
fear the Germans will lose interest in EC integration as they turn
their energies toward Central and Eastern Europe.
   French President Francois Mitterrand, another speaker at
Tuesday's forum, said unification will pose a formidable challenge
for businesses in neighboring countries.
   He accused some French executives of timidity, saying they
should be pursuing markets inside Germany.
   ``This sort of dynamism, this audacity, I expect it from the
French,'' Mitterrand said.
   Delors said the future of European integration was linked
entirely to Germany's ability to decide on key policy issues within
the next few months.
   ``I've felt disoriented by the contradictory declarations'' of
German officials in recent weeks, he said.
   Karl Otto Poehl, president of the West German central bank, has
rejected rapid moves toward European monetary union. Poehl and West
German Finance Minister Theo Waigel maintain the 12 EC nations are
not ready to create a European central bank.
   However, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher are pushing for rapid European monetary and
political union. Genscher has backed a plan offered by the EC
Commission to begin putting together a European central bank as
early as 1993.
   Delors said the Germans were being unrealistic if they expected
``perfect economic convergence'' among all 12 EC members before
monetary union occurred. He said the time had come to ``fix the
dates'' for union.
   Mitterrand said he accepted the fact that Germany would emerge
from unification with greater economic clout.
   ``If the development of Germany is incitement to do more, than
it's a good thing,'' he said. ``This competition will enable us to
show what France is capable of.''
   Mitterrand said he considered unification to be a right of the
German people, ``who cannot pay the price forever for a horrible
war lost in 1945.''
   No government official in Western Europe has been as outspoken
about German unity as Britain's former trade and industry
secretary, Nicholas Ridley. He resigned in July after telling an
interviewer that the ``uppity'' Germans were trying to dominate
Europe.
   The push for monetary union was ``a German racket designed to
take over the whole of Europe,'' he said.
   Of the European Commission, he said: ``I'm not against giving up
sovereignty in principle, but not to this lot. You might just as
well give it to Adolf Hitler, frankly.''
   Ridley's views were regarded widely as being shared privately by
a large segment of Thatcher's Conservative Party.
   Britain and France were offered advice Monday in an op-ed
article in the International Herald Tribune.
   Dominique Moisi, associate director of the French Institute of
International Relations, and Lawrence Freedman, professor at King's
College in London, said their governments should increase bilateral
security cooperation.
   ``They both recognize a need to balance growing German power,''
the authors wrote. ``They must show the rest of Europe that they
work in concert and not just in parallel.''

   Congress today took the first step to delay
$85 billion in imminent spending cuts while the White House said it
would rather ``negotiate into the night'' than accept a delay.
   Republicans were almost unanimous in opposition as the House
Appropriations Committee approved, 32-20, a catchall bill that
would keep government operations going for an additional 20 days -
until Oct. 20 - to provide more time for negotiatiors to reach an
agreement on deficit reduction.
   In an effort to discourage President Bush's promised veto, the
committee attached to the bill an additional $2.1 billion to
finance U.S. participation in Operation Desert Shield in the
Persian Gulf.
   ``Why hold American troops in Saudi Arabia hostage?'' demanded
Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla. ``This (the Desert Shield money) won't
protect it. The president does intend to veto it.''
   The legislation would double - to 12 months - the time for which
the president may call up reserves for the Middle East operation.
   The committee sidestepped another major foreign policy question,
Bush's proposal to forgive $6.7 billion worth of Egyptian debt in
appreciation of Egypt's assistance in the Persian Gulf.
   Amid indications the committee would have refused to forgive the
debt. Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., offered - and the panel approved -
an amendment that would allow aid to Egypt to continue despite a
failure to repay past assistance.
   Stripped from the legislation - known as a continuing resolution
- was a section aimed at discouraging the National Endowment for
the Arts from supporting ``any indecent, anti-religious or obscene
picture, play or writing.''
   Rep. Jamie Whitten, D-Miss., chairman of the committee, said
failure of Congress to block arbitrary spending cuts due to take
effect next week would ``bring the economy to its knees ... We
can't afford the risk.''
   Rep. Silvio Conte of Massachusetts, senior Republican on the
panel, said one extension of the deadline would only lead to
another delay. ``A full-blown crisis'' may be the only way to force
a deficit reduction, he said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater repeated today that Bush
would veto any legislation that would delay across-the-board
spending reductions. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., and
other Democratic leaders are urging an extension in hopes of
resolving the year-long budget stalemate.
   The cuts - called a ``sequester'' - will take place unless the
targets of the Gramm-Rudman law are modified or delayed and will
mean across-the-board reductions of up to 40 percent throughout the
government.
   ``We want to avoid a sequester. We are willing to negotiate into
the night,'' Fitzwater said.
   He was asked about reports that one immediate impact of the
spending cuts would be the cancellation beginning Monday of all
U.S. commercial flights after 6 p.m.
   The flights would be cancelled because of sharp cutbacks in air
traffic controllers and in evening operation of U.S. weather
forecasting stations.
   ``We're concerned about it, just like we're concerned about all
the cuts,'' Fitzwater said. ``But if you think this seems
draconian, you ain't seen nothing yet. You're going to see a lot
more dramatic and difficult things to deal with than night
flights.''
   Negotiators from the two sides met in a back room of the Capitol
until nearly 12:30 a.m. today, emerging to say they were still
searching for a deal.
   ``We're making progress in cutting spending, but we're not quite
there,'' White House chief of staff John Sununu told reporters.
   The major sticking point to a five-year, $500 billion
deficit-reduction deal has been over whether to slash the tax rate
on capital gains, the profits from the sale of investments. Bush
says the reduction would boost the economy. Democrats, insisting
the break would aid the wealthy, have refused to accept it without
a compensating tax increase on upper-income people.
   The seemingly endless negotiations have left the government
staring at the start of the new fiscal year next Monday with no
budget, spending bills or other fiscal legislation in place.
   ``It's a game of chicken, that's all it is,'' said Rep. Silvio
Conte, R-Mass., who was a negotiator from May until top
congressional leaders took over last week.
   To prevent a complete government shutdown, the Democrats who
control Congress planned to begin working on a bill that would
temporarily finance the government through Oct. 20. The date was
chosen to give budget bargainers a chance to work out a pact and
enact it into law.
   ``If you get into the business of suspending and suspending and
suspending ... we'll be at it for 114 years,'' said budget director
Richard Darman.
   The same legislation is expected to provide about $2 billion
toward the expenses of Operation Desert Shield, the U.S. military
deployment in the Middle East.
   Unless some combination of tax increases and spending cuts are
found, the fiscal 1991 deficit is expected to exceed a record $250
billion in a budget of about $1.2 trillion.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev needed sweeping new
powers to quickly carry out economic reforms, not to introduce a
``state of siege,'' his economic adviser said Tuesday.
   Nikolai Petrakov fended off charges that Gorbachev was amassing
too much power.
   The Supreme Soviet parliament voted overwhelmingly Monday to
give Gorbachev broad authority to order the switch to a market
economy without consulting legislators every step of the way.
Dissenting lawmakers said the special powers would make Gorbachev a
virtual monarch, despite his vow to act responsibly.
   The resolution permits Gorbachev to issue presidential decrees
for the next 18 months on property, wages, prices, the national
budget, the financial system, and law and order.
   ``So why does the president need these extraordinary powers? Of
course not for the purpose of introducing a state of siege or ...
president's rule,'' Petrakov told a news briefing.
   ``Some of the problems will have to be resolved in one, two or
three days and those decisions should be taken instantaneously,''
he said. ``It will be difficult to convene the parliament and
discuss every issue.''
   The Supreme Soviet also voted in principle Monday to end seven
decades of inefficient, centrally planned economics and take the
leap toward a Western-style free market. Lawmakers were unable,
however, to decide which of three conflicting plans they liked
best.
   Gorbachev appointed a commission, headed by himself, to try to
merge the plans by Oct. 15. Previous attempts have failed. The
commission held its first meeting Tuesday.
   Petrakov expressed surprise at a weekend challenge of
Gorbachev's request for expanded powers by leaders of the Russian
Federation, the largest and wealthiest of the 15 Soviet republics.
   Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin and other leaders of the
republic's legislature read a statement on the popular ``Vremya''
television news program calling Gorbachev's request unacceptable.
Yeltsin said it was an attempt to introduce presidential rule in
the republics and disband their governments.
   ``It was a reaction based on rumor,'' Petrakov said Tuesday.
   Seven decades of Communist-style economics have left the Soviet
people short of adequate housing, food and consumers goods.
   Eggs and vegetables are the latest scarcities in Moscow.
   The egg shortage was blamed on last year's campaign against
salmonella, which has lowered egg production without eliminating
the dangerous bacteria.
   The Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper said Moscow warehouses had
only 6 percent of the potatoes they expected to store this winter,
and only 13 percent of other vegetables. It said there had been
many reported thefts from personal vegetable cellars.
   Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov, the author of the most
conservative economic reform program, has become a lightning rod
for public disenchantment, and has been fighting demands for his
resignation.
   Petrakov, asked why Gorbachev doesn't fire the beleaguered chief
minister, replied: ``The president is a very resolute and
independent person and I believe that you should understand that
there is a certain apprehension regarding the consequences of a
government crisis.''

<HEAD>`Cool' Club Admissions Policy Called Biased</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The doorman who decides whether you look cool
enough to get into a hot nightclub may be about to get his own
comeuppance under California civil rights law.
   The state Alcoholic Beverage Control Department and a private
lawyer, in separate actions, have accused two fashionable Los
Angeles night spots of arbitrary discrimination based on
appearance. The state's Unruct prohibits any
arbitrary discrimination by businesses.
   ``It's a subjective policy,'' Carl Falletta, the ABC's deputy
division chief in Los Angeles, said Monday. ``It depends on who the
doorman wants to let in.''
   He said a nigh Civil Rights Ahtclub open to the public can legally
enforce a
neutral dress code or a ban on disruptive customers, but can't rely
on a subjective, eye-of-the-beholder standard like ``no nerds
allowed.''
   The ABC is seeking a 30-day liquor license suspension of a
downtown club called Vertigo, where undercover officers allegedly
were excluded because of their appearance.
   Lawyer Kenneth Lipton, excluded from the nearby Mayan, has sued
that nightclub in small claims court seeking the $250 damage award
provided by state law. He said other spurned customers should
besiege the clubs with similar lawsuits and force a change in
policy.
   ``The people have the power to do this if they would stop
allowing themselves to be treated conomy was headed toward a recession
before Iraq, and
Iraq was just the nail in the coffin,'' said Allen Sinai, chief
economist for the Boston Co. A recession ``seems inescapable,'' he
said.
   Surveys following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait - and the
subsequent oil-price spiral - showed many top economists
forecasting an imminent recession.
   The National Association of Business Economists reported Tuesday
that more than half of the 71 professional forecasters responding
to its survey in late August and early September said a recession
already has begun or will begin in the fourth quarter of 1990 or
the first quarter of 1991.
   And half of the top economists surveyed each month by Blue Chip
Economic Indicators now believe the economy will enter a recession
this year.
   ``In a sharp revision of earlier views, 50 percent of the 50
panel members replying ... now think the long-delayed recession
will start this year,'' wrote R.J. Eggert, the newsletter's editor.
   ``Of those expecting the recession to begin this year, three
believe it actually began in the second quarter, six expect the
downturn to begin in the current quarter and 16 have pegged the
fourth quarter of this year as the starting date.''
   Sinai pointed to negative economic data already available for
July and August and said, ``It looks like the recession started in
the third quarter.''
   ``The economy ground to a halt in the second quarter and is in
the process of contracting right now,'' added Richard W. Rahn,
chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   A price index tied to the GNP was unchanged at an annual rate of
3.9 percent in the second quarter. But with the surge in oil
prices, inflation as measured in the Consumer Price Index jumped
0.8 percent in August alone. The higher prices will be reflected in
the third-quarter GNP report.
   The price of oil before the Iraqi invasion was less than $20 a
barrel. It reached a record $38 a barrel on Monday.
   Since oil is used in producing so many consumer goods as well as
for heating and transportation, any price increase not only slashes
available funds needed to feed economic growth but also feeds
inflation.
   The department originally had estimated the economy grew at a
1.2 percent rate from April through June, after advances of 1.7
percent in the first quarter and 2.5 percent in 1989 and 4.5
percent in 1988.
   But it said Tuesday that more complete data showed weaker net
exports and lower inventory accumulation than first thought.
   The new data showed net exports declining by $9.2 billion rather
than $4.5 billion, and inventories totaling $19.8 billion rather
than $22.4 billion.
   ``But there really were no areas of strength,'' Sinai said.
   Consumer spending, which represents two-thirds of the nation's
economic activity, rose just 0.2 percent, down from 1.1 percent in
the first quarter. Business investment fell 4.7 percent after a 5
percent gain from January through March.
   Housing construction plunged 11.2 percent after advancing 15.1
percent in the first quarter. Government spending rose 6.2 percent
but most of that was by the federal government. State and local
spending was down 0.6 percent.
   If the economy were in a recession - generally described as two
consecutive quarters of negative growth - it would end the nearly
eight years of expansion that began after the 1981-82 downturn.
   The Commerce Department also reported today that after-tax
corporate profits fell a revised 0.6 percent, worse than the 0.2
percent drop first reported and their poorest showing since a 5.9
percent decline in the third quarter of 1989. They had risen 0.5
percent in the first quarter and 1.7 percent in the final quarter
of 1989.
   The various changes left the GNP growing by $4.5 billion in the
second quarter. After removing the effects of inflation, the GNP
totaled an annual rate of $4.16 trillion.

   Matthias Rust, the young West
German pilot who stunned the world by landing a small plane on
Moscow's Red Square, has been charged with attempted murder,
authorities said Tuesday.
   Rust, 22, was charged in the November 1989 stabbing of a nurse
in a Hamburg hospital, said an official of the Hamburg prosecutor's
office.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Rust was
charged at the beginning of the month.
   Rust allegedly stabbed the nurse after she fended off his
attempts to kiss her. He was held briefly in custody, then released
on bail.
   Rust flew a single-engine Cessna plane undetected across a vast
space of Soviet territory and landed at Red Square in May 1987.
   The landing triggered a shake-up in the Soviet military - the
retirement of defense minister Gen. Sergei Sokolov and the
dismissal of air defense chief Gen. Alexander Koldunov.
   Rust was held in a Soviet prison for 14 months before he was
released in August 1988.

   Twelve-year-old Lissette Rodriguez insisted she had to go to
church in the middle of the night.
   At 2 a.m. Tuesday, her nurse, Holly Popovich, dressed her and
drove her to the St. Elizabeth's Hospital chapel in Elizabeth, N.J.
   Lissette prayed for her life for 20 minutes. ``God, please help
me, please help me,'' she implored. ``I don't want to be like this.
I'm scared. I don't want to die. I want to live.''
   Sandy, as she is nicknamed, saw her nurse crying at her side. In
tears herself, she told Ms. Popovich not to cry.
   She carried with her from the church a book, ``Christ The
King,'' and a cup of holy water.
   After church, there was one more stop, an all-night supermarket.
Sandy bought some gum, candy and a Mickey Mouse book.
   Back at her home in Elizabeth, she gave the religious book to
the woman she called her mother, Carmen Candelaria, who is really
her aunt. Sandy blessed her with the holy water. ``Mommy, I love
you,'' she said.
   She ought sleep because it represented a death that stalked her
until she finally slipped away shortly after 9 a.m. Barely 12 years
old, she was another victim of AIDS, one of the more than 1,300
children who have died in the United States.
   Sandy was born four weeks prematurely in New York City. Mrs.
Candelaria took Sandy from her own sister when she was born because
the sister was unable to care for her. Sandy contracted AIDS
through a blood transfusion needed because of her early birth, Mrs.
Candelaria said.
   The girl's mother died two years ago, at age 41, after mixing
Valium and alcohol at a party, Mrs. Candelaria said. She said she
knows nothing about Sandy's father. Her own husband, the man Sandy
knew as her father, was killed when she was 7 in a holdup in the
video store he owned in Puerto Rico, where the family lived for
five years.
   Sandy died without fulfilling a few simple dreams: to walk
again, to go to school, to see her classmates and New Kids on the
Block, to have another party, to fly to Puerto Rico to visit her
grandmother, to see the clouds from the plane.
   For Sandy, death was represented by the concept of heaven, where
everything is beautiful and she could walk again.
   ``You close your eyes and your body is not working,'' she said
in a interview. ``Then you go to God, go to Jesus in a big place
where he lives. My father is in there. Everyone who dies goes
there.''
   Those around Sandy say they think she had a premonition she
would die Tuesday morning.
   ``It's not uncommon for people who are dying to have a
premonition that they're going to die,'' said Ms. Popovich. ``She
was cold to the touch all night.''
   ``She kind of knew what was going on yesterday,'' said her chief
nurse, Doreen Small. ``She was bleeding through her nose and her
ear.''
   An earlier news story about Sandy brought letters and cards to
her and the gift of an airplane ticket to Puerto Rico.
   Now she will fly back in death to be buried in her family's
native land.

   The United States received a 76-minute
videotaped message from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Tuesday,
the State Department said.
   The tape was delivered to the department by Iraqi Ambassador
Mohamed al-Mashat. Officials were making a copy of the tape before
handing it to the news media later in the day.
   Saddam taped his address in response to an eight-minute message
delivered on Iraqi television by President Bush 10 days ago.
   Despite U.S. urging that Iraq hand the tape directly to the
media, Iraq insisted on delivering it to the State Department. All
media in Iraq are state-run.
   In his message, which was aired in its entirety, Bush said that
Saddam had brought his people to the brink of war.
   Most U.S. television networks have said they are unlikely to
broadcast the entire tape. Bush, when told last week that Saddam's
message might run 90 minutes, said the tape would put Americans to
sleep.

   Mickey Rourke and Carre Otis, co-stars of the
steamy movie ``Wild Orchid,'' have reached a settlement with the
movie's producers over the selling of nude photos to two magazines,
Rourke's lawyer said.
   The attorney, Ralph Loeb, declined to reveal details of the
agreement, only saying Monday that it had been reached within the
past 45 days.
   The actors filed suit in May, accusing Vision of the
unauthorized release of movie photographs, which were printed in
Playboy in June and the German magazine Kino in April.
   Miss Otis and Rourke filed separate lawsuits seeking general and
punitive damages.
   Rourke's suit charged that the producers ``had no intention of
obtaining Rourke's approval prior to their dissemination of
explicit photographs of Rourke to various magazines for use in
tawdry sex pictorials. ... ''
   Miss Otis claimed she had signed a contract with Kruger-Bent
Group, a subsidiary of Vision Entertainment, that guaranteed her
control over the use of nude photos from the movie. She also
charged that her reputation had been harmed.
   Miss Otis' attorney, Peter Laird, declined comment Tuesday, as
did Scott Cooper, an attorney for Vision Entertainment.

<DATELINE>A MARINE BASE, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Marine Cpl. Janice
Brautigam joined up, she didn't even know where Saudi Arabia was.
Now she lives in a tent on the edge of its vast desert, as close to
the front line as women are allowed to be.
   ``I never knew it existed, to tell the tuth,'' Brautigam, 22,
of Clearwater, Fla., said of the desert kingdom by the Persian Gulf
she is helping to defend.
   She and fellow female Marines are among the tens of thousands of
U.S. troops deployed in Saudi Arabia after Iraq's Aug. 2 takeover
of Kuwait.
   Those interviewed at their base were uniformly proud of tasks
they perform.
   Although the U.S. military restricts the combat roles of the
women, they still come in for their share of difficult and even
dangerous work.
   Lance Cpl. Melanie Roberts, 20, of Richmond, Va., a crew member
on a crash rescue truck, was on duty Sept. 12 when a big CH-53 Sea
Stallion helicopter crashed on takeoff. She helped to pull out the
five injured crew members and control the fire.
   After a month in Saudi Arabia, she says she prefers it to boot
camp at Parris Island, S.C.
   ``No sand fleas here,'' she said.
   Brautigam, who weighs in at 105 pounds, is a truck driver.
``Eighteen wheelers, you name it,'' she said. ``I can haul anything
from tanks to supplies to buses.''
   She said she joined the Marines ``because they ask the most. You
have to to work harder physically and mentally.''
   Sgt. Susan Ritter, 26, of Weiner, Ark., agreed. ``You might as
well go for the gusto,'' she said.
   Lance Cpl. Stephanie Bowlin, 20, of Modesto, Calif., a military
policewoman assigned to base security, said she joined the Marines
``for the challenge.''
   She was in a patrol vehicle perhaps 50 yards from the Sea
Stallion helicopter when it crashed. She was among the first to
reach the blazing wreck and helped one of the burned crewmen to
safety.
   Nothing quite that dramatic has happened to Brautigam or Cpl.
Coe Hart, 26, of Binghamton, N.Y., but they say they're ready for
whatever comes up.
   Both Brautigam and Hart have Marine husbands, who are also in
Saudi Arabia and stationed several miles from their base.
   Brautigam and her husband, Lance Cpl. Thomas J. Buday, were
married seven months ago. Now they meet for a few minutes whenever
possible.

<HEAD>Rockefeller Says Health Insurance Overhaul Inevitable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of a national bipartisan
commission said Tuesday that its $70 billion plan to guarantee
universal access to health care is ``absolutely inevitable''
because of growing public anger over the current health system.
   ``People who predict we can't do this are going to be wrong,
because the American people are going to make us do it,'' said Sen.
Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va.
   The panel, headed by Rockefeller and known as the Pepper
Commission - after its former chairman - released the final report
of its two-year study. While the basic elements of its proposal,
for overhauling Medicaid and the health insurance system, were
decided last spring, the panel provided supporting details and
cited potential tax increases to pay its $70 billion price tag.
   The recommendations drew criticism from opposite sides, with
some saying it was unrealistic and too expensive, and others saying
it fell short of a national health insurance solution.
   ``The Pepper Commission report is a start but needs to be taken
with a grain of salt,'' said a Republican member, Sen. David
Durenberger of Minnesota. ``We didn't finish the job of building
political consensus behind a solution. But we did help define the
problems and narrow the options. And that sets the stage for the
president to make his contribution.''
   The commission's recommendations were opposed by the Bush
administration, which lobbied the commission members to oppose
them, Rockefeller said.
   The U.S. Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive Health Care was
established out of concern that more than 30 million Americans have
no health insurance and millions more face impoverishment by
long-term care. Its first chairman was the late Rep. Claude Pepper,
D-Fla., the long-time champion of America's senior citizens.
   The commission plan calls for requiring all businesses with more
than 100 employers to provide private health insurance or
contribute to a new public plan for all employees and their
dependents.
   Smaller employers would be given financial incentives to provide
their employees coverage. If, after five years, such coverage is
not widespread, those employers would be required to provide
private insurance or participate in a new federal public health
insurance plan.
   The commission also would improve Medicare coverage for the
elderly and would establish a program to cover long-term care
services, including provisions for care within the home.
   All would be guaranteed coverage for the first three months of a
nursing home stay, with extended benefits based on financial need.
People needing long-term care would not be required to spend
themselves into poverty before receiving federal coverage, as
Medicaid requires.
   Cost of the package was estimated at $24 billion for
recommendations involving people under age 65, $3 billion for
elderly health care and $43 billion for long-term care, when fully
implemented after five years.
   The commission said the $70 billion total amounts to $8.25 a
week for every non-poor adult in the country.
   The plans face an uphill struggle in Congress, and bills to
fully implement them won't even be ready until next year.
Rockefeller is sponsoring with Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a bill
that would make a first step by extending Medicaid to cover all
low-income children and pregnant women.
   But with the administration and congressional leaders still
debating ways to lower the budget deficit, prospects for any action
on expanding health care coverage are considered dim. Still,
Rockefeller said the commission's plan or something like it will be
enacted eventually.
   ``It is absolutely inevitable,'' Rockefeller said. ``Before the
end of this century, well before, the Pepper Commission or a plan
similar to that will be the health care system of this country.''
   The commission's initial recommendations drew fire for failing
to include recommendations for how to pay for it.
   The commission made no financing recommendations, but its final
report includes six potential finance packages as possibilities.
Key elements of include an increase in the top income tax rates, a
surcharge on all federal income taxes, imposing a new value-added
tax and increasing Social Security taxes.
   The report includes dissenting views from members, including
Rep. Pete Stark, chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee
on health. He said a job-based plan will not provide coverage to
all Americans, and that the Pepper Commission failed to include
realistic health cost containment proposals.
   ``A single national plan is the only realistic way to make
health insurance affordable to small employers,'' said Stark,
D-Calif., who has sponsored his own universal health care bill.
   Rep. Bill Gradison, R-Ohio, also on the commission, pronounced
the recommendations ``so costly that they are unrealistic.''

   An Iranian town where 40,000 people died
in an earthquake in June was rocked by a strong quake Tuesday, but
no injuries or damage were reported, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
   The temblor that struck Rudbar in western Iran on Tuesday
measured 5.5 on the Richter scale, said the IRNA dispatch,
monitored in Nicosia. The quake struck in the afternoon.
   The devastating June 21 earthquake in Rudbar, 125 miles
northwest of Tehran, injured 60,000 residents and left half a
million homeless.
   The Richter scale is a guage of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. An earthquake registering 5 on the Richter scale can
cause considerable damage, especially in populated areas.

<HEAD>Bush Promises Increased Trade with Turkey</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Inserts grafs 14-16, At the Pentagon, with further on Iraqi

<TEXT>
   President Bush, vowing anew that Iraq's
conquest of Kuwait ``will not stand,'' today promised increased
trade with Turkey to help it economically weather the international
embargo against Iraq.
   Meanwhile, a Pentagon spokesman said Iraq has increased the
number of troops and tanks in Kuwait and southern Iraq over the
past week. About 430,000 Iraqi soldiers are now in southern Iraq
and occupied Kuwait, said spokesman Pete Williams, an increase from
the 360,000 total reported last week.
   Bush met at the White House with Turkish President Turgot Ozal
and, separately, with Portugese Prime Minister Cavaco Silva. Both
leaders voiced strong support for the U.S.-led effort to isolate
Saddam Hussein.
   The president praised ``staunch allies like Turkey'' for joining
in telling ``the world we will not tolerate this invasion, it will
not stand.''
   In a brief White House ceremony after his meeting with Ozal,
Bush said the United States would seek a new agreement to increase
textile imports from Turkey.
   He also pledged to work closely with Congress to ``make sure
that Turkey gets its fair share'' of military aid in the coming
year. ``We will also work to help modernize the Turkish armed
forces by the future sales of F16s and provision of other military
equipment,'' Bush said.
   ``We stand by those who stand up for civilized values around the
world,'' Bush said.
   For his part, Ozal praised Bush for ``his firm stand against
aggression.''
   Turkey was one of the first nations to help the United States
after the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait by closing a major
pipeline carrying Iraqi oil. Portugal is allowing U.S. airlift
flights to Saudi Arabia to use an airbase in the Azores for
refueling.
   Silva, speaking with reporters after his meeting with the
president, said the ``international community must stick together
and be very firm'' in enforcing the United Nations' sanctions
against Iraq.
   ``Nobody can accept that such a brutal aggression will pay
off,'' he said.
   Ozal, who had lunch with Bush, told reporters at a
picture-taking session in the Oval Office that ``we're going to
talk now'' about prospects for more aid to his battered economy.
   Asked how long Turkey could hold out without trade with Iraq or
with oil-related revenues, Ozal said, ``as much as it requires.''
   At the Pentagon, Williams said the Iraqi deployments still
appear to be ``essentially a defensive force,'' but are capable of
readily converting to an offensive strike force.
   He said the reported increases in Iraqi troops and tank
deployments are due in part to the Pentagon including a larger
geographic area in its count. Williams said he could not estimate
how much of the increase was due to this factor. He said some of
the extra soldiers had been moved from the Iranian border area.
   The number of tanks in the Kuwait theater has jumped by 700 from
last week, to 3,500 tanks, Williams said. He said the number of
armored personnel carriers has risen to 2,500, an increase of 700.
Artillery pieces now total about 1,700, up by 250.
   U.S. officials said in advance of today's meeting that the
administration was not prepared to provide any additional direct
assistance to Turkey or other troubled economies in the Middle
East.
   The Turkish government put its economic cost at $4 billion or
more annually, including millions of dollars in construction
contracts. About 6,000 Turkish workers have lost jobs as a result
of the pipeline closure, the government says.
   Bush was prepared to tell the 152-member International Monetary
Fund later today and its sister lending organization, the World
Bank, that the two organizations should take a more active role in
the Middle East crisis, administration aides said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush would ask the
international agencies to match political leadership shown by the
United Nations with economic leadership in helping ease the shock
to poor nations of the Iraqi embargo.
   World Bank President Barber Conable outlined today emergency
plans to help resettle hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing
Iraq and Kuwait.
   On Monday, Bush told a group of Arab-American business leaders
at the White House there will be ``no, no, no negotiation'' with
Iraq until it fully withdraws from Kuwait.
   He encountered some sharp questioning after he finished prepared
remarks to about 150 representatives of Arab-American groups -
including one from a participant who told him that ``as Moslems, we
object to Saudi Arabia inviting the foreign troops to our land.''
   ``The objective is to see that naked aggression does not pay
off, sir,'' Bush replied.
   Asked by another participant why he would not talk directly with
Saddam, the president said the United States would not negotiate
until Iraq pulled out of Kuwait, the former Kuwaiti leadership was
restored and the safety of Americans was assured.
   ``We're not going to yield one inch on those provisions,'' he
said.
   Bush also said ``I am not going to be distracted'' by Saddam's
suggestions that the atmosphere for a settlement would be improved
if Israel withdrew from occupied territories.
   ``We are going to resist his attempts to justify what he did
based on other regional concerns. So I think these are merely, on
his part, an effort to create additional pretexts so that he can
stay in Kuwait,'' Bush said.
   Asked why the United States was depriving the children of Iraq
of food in the international trade embargo, the president said the
Iraqi government would not permit relief organizations to send in
supervised food shipments.
   ``I am much less interested in feeding Saddam Hussein's army at
this point,'' he said.

   NASA said Tuesday it will try to
launch the shuttle Discovery with a sun-probing satellite on Oct.
6, while the search goes on for mysterious hydrogen leaks that have
grounded Columbia.
   Discovery is scheduled to lift off at 7:35 a.m. with five
astronauts who will send the European satellite on a five-year
journey to study the sun's polar regions. It would be the first
spacecraft to orbit the solar poles.
   ``This date is a little success-oriented and is dependent on not
encountering any unusual problems,'' said shuttle director Robert
Crippen. ``But I think the shuttle team has a good chance of making
the 6th.''
   NASA's last shuttle flight was in April, when Discovery carried
the flawed Hubble Space Telescope into orbit. Soon afterward, the
rest of the fleet, Columbia and Atlantis, were crippled by hydrogen
leaks.
   Columbia is not expected to fly until late this year or early
next year. NASA's fourth attempt in as many months to send Columbia
on an astronomy mission failed last week.
   Atlantis has been in the hangar since early August, undergoing
repairs for leaks in hydrogen lines between the orbiter and its
external tank. Its classified Pentagon mission, originally
scheduled for July, is now set for early November.
   NASA officials repeatedly have said they are confident
Discovery's fuel lines are leak-free because of the shuttle's
flight performance in April and the minimal amount of work
performed since then in its engine compartment.
   NASA faces an Oct. 23 launch deadline for Discovery and the
plutonium-powered sun probe, named for the legendary Greek
adventurer Ulysses. If Discovery does not lift off by then, the
mission will have to wait until the planets are properly aligned
again in late 1991.
   To enter an orbit passing over the sun's poles, Ulysses must
travel to Jupiter, a 16-month trip, and use that planet's gravity
to throw it back toward the sun. Ulysses is expected to pass over
the sun's south pole in 1994 and the north pole the following year.
   The White House on Monday approved Discovery's launch with
Ulysses. Such approval is necessary when radioisotope
thermoelectric generators, or RTGs, are used.
   Ulysses' one RTG will convert heat from 24{ pounds of decaying
plutonium into electricity. Anti-nuclear activists and
environmentalists oppose the generator's use, saying a
Challenger-like accident would spread the deadly plutonium over
Florida.
   But officials of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration contend the health risk would be small, even in the
worst circumstance.
   The $750 million mission initially was scheduled for May 1986
but was delayed by the Challenger explosion earlier that year.

   President Bush urged the Senate Tuesday to
swiftly approve a historic treaty to end the division of Germany,
45 years after the defeat of the Nazis.
   At a ceremony in the Rose Garden, Bush called the agreement
``the culmination of more than four decades of Western resolve and
determination, from the darkest hours of the Cold War to the bright
new horizons that stretch before us.''
   The accord formally relinquishes all rights and responsibilities
over Germany by the four victorious allies in World War II. It was
signed in Moscow on Sept. 12 by officials from the United States,
Soviet Union, Britain and France.
   The treaty must be ratified by the four allied powers before
their rights in Germany are formally terminated. However, the four
countries have agreed to ``suspend'' their rights on Oct. 1, two
days before the merger of East and West Germany.
   In the transmittal letter to the Senate, Bush said, ``It is
wholly fitting that Germany formally and irrevocably achieve its
unified status at the earliest possible moment, unfettered by
four-power rights, shared by the Soviet Union, which are now
outmoded and unnecessary.''
   He said the treaty ``represents a major achievement for our
German allies, who have not forgotten the past or the role Germany
once played in the horrors of 1933-45, but who have demonstrated
over four decades of steadfast support for democracy and the
Western alliance what the world can expect from the united
Germany.''
   After the defeat of the Nazis, the four allies divided Germany
and its capital into four occupation zones, which became East and
West Germany and East and West Berlin.
   Aside from ending the division of the country, the treaty calls
on the Soviet Union to complete the withdrawal of its estimated
370,000 troops from what is now East Germany by 1994.
   U.S., British and French troops will remain in Berlin during the
interim.
   In his remarks, Bush said the treaty ``will end the artificial
division of Germany and Berlin and it will restore to Germany
sovereignty over all its territory and end all remaining four-power
rights and responsibilities.
   ``This agreement clears the way to achievement of the goal we
Americans have long shared with the German people, a united,
democratic and sovereign Germany,'' the president said.
   He congratulated West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the
German people ``for keeping their dream of national
self-determination ever alive.''

   South African President F. W. de Klerk said
today he believes the economic sanctions imposed by the United
States against his country slowed down the reform process that he
has instituted.
   De Klerk, speaking to a press luncheon as he neared the end of
his official visit here, said his government nonetheless plans to
carry out all of the reforms the sanctions were designed to
promote.
   Asked about the impact of the sanctions legislation, de Klerk
said, ``To a great extent it was counterproductive.
   ``People under threat tend to react negatively. We don't like as
a country to be prescribed to by other countries. And there's an
emotional reaction which is brought about by that.''
   Among other measures, the sanctions, approved in 1986 over
President Reagan's veto, forbid new U.S. investment in South Africa
and deny South African air carriers landing rights in the United
States.
   De Klerk spoke to reporters at a National Press Club luncheon
after conferring with Senate leaders. Since his arrival here
Sunday, de Klerk has sought to convince Americans that he is
serious about his commitment to establish a non-racial system in
his country. But some black activists remain skeptical.
   The 24-member Congressional Black Caucus canceled a meeting it
had scheduled with de Klerk because it feared the session could be
misinterpreted.
   After de Klerk's meeting Monday with President Bush, Randall
Robinson, head of the TransAfrica anti-apartheid group, said the
two leaders' meeting sent a ``false and dangerous message'' that
South Africa is on its way to change.
   De Klerk, meanwhile, assured Bush that the process of democratic
reform cannot be reversed.
   ``We will not turn back,'' he said, promising a new system in
which all South Africans will have a ``vote of equal value.''
   Bush, in turn, hailed the ``dramatic progress'' away from
apartheid rule in South Africa.
   ``Clearly, the time has come to encourage and assist the
emerging new South Africa,'' Bush said after his 2{ hour session
with de Klerk.
   Behind the leaders, a black Marine held the flag of South Africa
and a white Marine held the American flag.
   It was just a year ago that de Klerk assumed the South African
presidency, a time when U.S.-South African relations were still
frosty because of the negligible progress toward ending white rule.
   Bush remarked on how far South Africa has come under de Klerk's
tutelage.
   ``Who among us, only a year ago, would have anticipated these
remarkable developments,'' Bush said.
   De Klerk has overseen the lifting of bans on democratic
political parties and the release of African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela, among other prisoners.
   Still, South Africa has not met the requirements for lifting
U.S. economic sanctions, which were imposed by Congress four years
ago over President Reagan's veto.
   U.S. officials said South Africa still must lift emergency rule
in Natal Province and release the remaining political prisoners
before the sanctions may be suspended.
   Later, Foreign Minister Pik Botha said Bush's characterization
of the dismantling of apartheid as irreversible should help
persuade European governments to lift sanctions. He said he
understood the difficulty in changing U.S. sanctions written into
law by Congress.
   ``We are aware of the sensitivities constraining the U.S.
administration and we are not here to ask the U.S. to do anything
about it at this stage,'' Botha said.
   The Congressional Black Caucus remains skeptical about de
Klerk's promises. Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., caucus chairman,
explained the decision not to meet with de Klerk, saying, ``To meet
with the caucus separate and apart bestows a level of credibility
that at this point we are not prepared to deal with.''
   But Dellums and other black members of the House were to be
among the lawmakers meeting with de Klerk this afternoon.

   Illusionists Siegfried &amp; Roy, who dreamed
20 years ago of someday playing Las Vegas, have raised $150,000 for
eye research with their 10,000th performance here.
   The veterans of the Las Vegas Strip used the milestone show at
the Mirage Hotel on Monday night to stage a $300-per-ticket gala to
raise money for the Baltimore-based Retinitis Pigmentosa
Foundation.
   After the show, Siegfried, whose last name is Fischbacher, said
he and partner Roy Uwe Ludwig Horn, came to the United States from
West Germany two decades ago with the dream of playing Las Vegas.
   ``We are living proof that you should never give up your
dreams,'' he said.
   Roy told of being approached 16 years ago with the idea of
bringing blind children to the estate where the two keep a
menagerie of tigers and other exotic animals.
   He said his fondest memory of the day was of a blind girl
approaching him and asking to ``feel'' what a tiger looked like.
   ``She asked me to put her hands on the tiger, to run her fingers
along his stripes.''
   Mirage Chairman Steve Wynn sat with Retinitis Pigmentosa
President Gordon Gund, who is blind, and described the show to him.
   ``I have a vested interest in this subject,'' Wynn said of the
Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation. The gaming executive suffers from
partial sight impairment.

   The Soviets' stumbling transition to a free
economy is unleashing a wave of economic crime, and the black
market is thriving on the sale of scarce goods, senior police
officials said Tuesday.
   Investigators have found corruption at half of the 160,000
businesses they have inspected so far this year, and cases of
serious embezzlement are running at twice last year's rate, Col.
Vyacheslav I. Runyshkov of the Ministry of Internal Affairs told a
news conference.
   The release of such alarming statistics on black marketeering
indicated that law enforcement officials are concerned about social
and economic problems stemming from the zigzag path to reform.
   For a year, the Soviet government and legislature have been on
the verge of moving from a planned to a market economy but have
balked repeatedly, throwing the system into chaos.
   Severe shortages of consumer goods, such as bread and tobacco,
not only have caused widespread dissatisfaction, but have fueled
the already extensive black market.
   The disappearance of goods between factories and state-owned
retail outlets means the system will be able to provide only 32
percent of the national requirements for medicine, but purchases
abroad could raise that figure to 68 percent, said Runyshkov, who
is in charge of the nation's chief anti-corruption unit.
   He cited similar shortages of vegetables, potatoes, grain and
other staples.
   Runyshkov strongly denied the shortages were caused either by a
conspiracy among hard-line Communist Party opponents of reform, or
by an organized crime network.
   ``It is often said that this is a result of the actions of some
destructive forces or the mafia,'' he said. ``I declare that
neither the Ministry of Internal Affairs nor the KGB have
established this.''
   ``What is at hand is just negligence,'' he said, describing case
after case in which workers diverted goods from state enterprises
and sold them illegally.
   Asked to provide more specific reasons for the disappearance of
bread or vegetables, Runyshkov and five other police officials
laughed nervously and replied: ``We don't understand it.''
   The phenomenon they described was one of many small- and
medium-sized thefts in which the goods turn up for sale in private
shops, called cooperatives, or on the black market.
   The chaos that has surrounded economic reform led the national
legislature on Monday to grant President Mikhail S. Gorbachev broad
powers to steer the country from a planned to a market system
without consulting lawmakers every step of the way.
   The resolution allows Gorbachev to issue presidential decrees
for the next 18 months on property, wages, prices, the national
budget, the financial system, and law and order.
   The surge in economic crime indicates that the state
distribution system appears to be disintegrating.
   Black market prices run two to three times those in state stores
for most goods, and three to five times for automobiles, Runyshkov
said.
   On Sept. 20, he said, 650 state-owned butcher shops did not have
meat, 799 did not have sausage, 1,069 dairy shops had no eggs and
1,803 grocery stores had no sugar. He did not cite the number of
stores overall for comparison.
   Runyshkov said the number of people tried on major embezzlement
charges doubled from last year to this year, but he did not say
specifically how many people were involved. The number of people
tried for economic crimes of all types was 188,000 in the first
eight months of this year, he said.

<HEAD>Pentagon Reports Shift in Soviet Defense Spending, Arms Output</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet military spending fell last year for
the first time since President Mikahil Gorbachev came to power in
1985, reflecting the impact of a domestic economic crisis and ``new
thinking'' in the Kremlin, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
   The Defense Department also said in its annual assessment of
Soviet military strength that Moscow slowed the pace of arms
production last year, particularly of tanks, artillery pieces and
other equipment for its ground forces.
   The report, the ninth in a series started by then-Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger, departed from previous editions by
striking an encouraging tone in describing the security threat to
the West posed by the Soviet military.
   ``The likelihood of a conflict stemming from U.S.-Soviet
confrontation is lower than it has ever been in the post-war era,''
the report said, noting the historic changes of the last year,
including the breakup of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe.
   ``Prior to the advent of `new thinking,' Soviet military
policies sought to build and maintain forces capable of defeating
the combined forces of all potential adversaries,'' it said. ``...
the Soviets now set less ambitious goals.''
   In an introductory essay, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said he
was encouraged by signs of Soviet eagerness to cooperate with the
West, but he added that domestic political and economic turmoil
made it difficult to be sure of Soviet intentions.
   ``In such an atmosphere, it is difficult to predict what will
happen next month, let alone next year,'' Cheney wrote, adding a
note of caution:
   ``The Soviet Union remains an enormous military superpower. The
intentions of that regime are changing. But intentions are not
enough to support dramatic changes in our level of preparedness.''
   The report said Soviet defense spending last year fell by 4
percent to 5 percent from the 1988 level. Pete Williams, a Pentagon
spokesman, said that in the period from 1985, when Gorbachev
assumed power as General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party,
to 1988, Soviet military spending rose by an annual average of 3
percent.
   U.S. defense spending since 1985 has declined by an annual
average of about 2 percent and is headed for a bigger drop as a
resulf of current negotiations between the White House and Congress
over the 1991 budget year, which starts Monday.
   Gorbachev announced in January 1989 that he intended to cut
defense spending by 14.2 percent by 1991.
   The Pentagon report said the most pronounced reductions in
Soviet arms production in 1989 came in ground forces materiel.
Moscow built about 1,700 tanks last year, half the previous year's
total. Production of artillery pieces fell by nearly 20 percent and
multiple-rocket launchers dropped to 300 from 480.
   Cheney stressed that while Gorbachev was reducing arms
production in most areas he was maintaining Soviet strength in
strategic, or long-range, nuclear forces.
   The Soviets, for example, are modernizing their arsenal of
intercontinental ballistic missiles, including continued deployment
of the SS-24, a multiple-warhead missile, the mobile SS-25 and a
new version of the SS-18, which carries 10 warheads.
   The Pentagon report said that domestic crises, including
nationalist movements and economic turmoil, pose grave dangers to
the stability of the Soviet Union - and thus made it impossible to
be sure if military reforms will be lasting.
   ``Domestic crises ... are bringing the Soviet Union to the brink
of economic breakdown and potential internal chaos,'' the report
said. ``As a result, the Soviets are developing a policy and
strategy that is oriented toward defense of the USSR and away from
external adventurism.''
   In a departure from past practice, Cheney did not personally
present the Pentagon report at a news conference. His spokesman,
Pete Williams, said Cheney's decision reflected in part U.S.
appreciation of Soviet cooperation in the multinational effort to
force Iraq, a former Soviet arms customer, out of Kuwait.

<HEAD>Two Students Killed In Clashes With Police</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIJAY JOSHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police shot and killed two students and
wounded seven others Tuesday in street battles with upper-caste
Hindus protesting a quota policy that reserves many government jobs
for lower castes, police said.
   In Haryana state, north of New Delhi, one student committed
suicide by consuming insecticide and two more tried to burn
themselves to death Tuesday, Press Trust of India reported.
   The trouble in the capital started after hospital authorities
announced the death of Surinder Singh Chauhan, a 24-year-old
student who had set himself ablaze Monday to dramatize the protest.
   Students rampaged for more than six hours, burning government
and police vehicles and clashing with policemen. About 400 people
were detained, a senior police official said, but said they were
expected to be released Wednesday without charges.
   ``The situation is tense. The (police) action had to take place,
but I don't think the situation is beyond control,'' said the
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The protests were the most violent in eight weeks of
demonstrations against the new quotas. Under them, 27 percent of
government jobs are reserved for people from low castes in an
effort to make up for centuries of oppression imposed by India's
rigid caste system.
   An additional 22.5 percent of the jobs already were kept aside
for what were designated as the most backward castes and native
tribes. Five percent to 10 percent of jobs are to be reserved for
the poor, irrespective of caste.
   Upper-caste students say the policy will deprive them of jobs
which will go to less qualified applicants.
   Former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi demanded Prime Minister V.P.
Singh's resignation, saying it would pave the way for
reconciliation.
   The Bharatiya Janata, or Indian People's Party, which supports
Singh's minority government, called for a general strike in New
Delhi on Wednesday to protest the police action.
   In the anti-quota protests, at least 27 people have died in
battles with police in northern states. At least 27 other
protesters have attempted suicide.

<HEAD>Strike in Disputed Territory in Soviet Caucasus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people went on a 24-hour strike
Tuesday in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh in the southern
Soviet Union, demanding the restoration of rule by its Armenian
majority, the Tass news agency reported.
   The protest was peaceful, and Soviet Interior Ministry troops
did not interfere, Tass said. The troops are enforcing the state of
emergency in the enclave, located inside the republic of Azerbaijan
in the Caucasus mountains.
   In the past two years, more than 200 people have been killed in
a dispute between Azerbaijan and neighboring Armenia over who
should govern Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Soviet authorities gave the mountainous territory to Azerbaijan,
which is predominantly Shiite Moslem, in 1923. Like
Nagorno-Karabakh's population, Armenia is predominantly Christian.
   Tuesday's demonstrators expressed support for Soviet parliament
deputies from Nagorno-Karabakh who are on a hunger strike to
protest the dissolution of regional councils and the regional
Communist Party committee by the Soviets, Tass and the independent
Interfax news agency reported.
   Neither agency said when the legislators began their hunger
strikes.
   Armenians are upset over what they perceive as President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's failure to respond to their complaints that
Azerbaijani authorities violated a Soviet parliament decree in
November 1989.
   That action abolished a Soviet government committee that had
controlled Nagorno-Karabakh for the previous 10{ months, and
returned it to Azerbaijani rule.
   Armenians complain that Azerbaijani authorities have been
altering the administrative boundaries in Nagorno-Karabakh and
resettling Azerbaijani refugees there.
   Protesters sent a telegram to Gorbachev on Tuesday that said
concentrations of Azerbaijani militants were growing in the region.

<HEAD>Homosexuals Taking Precautions Following Slayings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Male homosexuals have started carrying guns
when they go to bars since they heard rumors that a murderer may be
stalking them.
   ``At least six of my friends are carrying guns now, too,''
Richard Todd said recently in Our Place, a gay bar.
   In the past decade, the bodies of 11 slain young men in their
teens and 20s have been found dumped in remote areas of central
Indiana and western Ohio. All were nude or partially clothed; seven
were strangled and the causes of death of four were not determined.
   The first 10 had ties to the Indianapolis homosexual community,
investigators say. It is not known if the latest victim, found
Sept. 12 in Darke County, Ohio, had ties to that community, said
Larry Swihart, a Preble County, Ohio, sheriff's investigator.
   Authorities believe the slayings may be the work of one person,
although they stop short of calling the deaths serial killings.
   David Morse, manager of Our Place, said he and others believe
the killer is a gay man who believes he is heterosexual.
   ``He experiences sexual urges and acts impulsively upon them,
then feels guilty and afraid because of it,'' Morse said. ``It's
very hard to come to terms with homosexuality because there is so
much discrimination against it.''
   Morse added: ``Whoever is killing these people has a good
knowledge of the gay community. He knows where to go to find his
victims.''
   Todd says he and other gay men have changed their lifestyles
since the slayings were linked.
   ``You can't have one-night stands. If it is a one-night stand,
then you are chancing dying,'' he said.
   But Morse said the community is not afraid, just more cautious.
He has asked employees to keep an eye out for strangers and plans
to post newspaper articles about the slayings.
   ``We're encouraging them to read the articles and to know the
people they meet,'' he said.
   ``I know people pick up the paper and say, `This won't happen to
me,' '' said David Roettger, whose son was one of the victims.
``Well, not everything happens to somebody else.''
   Investigators say they are no closer to finding a suspect.
   ``We have no answers,'' said Darke County, Ohio, Sheriff Robert
Sullenbarger. ``We don't even know where the homicides occurred.
Now we pray for a little luck.''

<HEAD>Vatican Issues Rules for Catholic Universities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II issued rules for the
world's Catholic universities Tuesday, a compromise document that
instructed schools to uphold official doctrine but dropped
proposals to give bishops wide powers.
   The long-awaited document pleased many U.S. Catholic educators,
who had protested earlier drafts that would have given bishops a
say in hiring and firing of theology teachers. The final document
assigns bishops a watchdog role in protecting the universities'
Catholic identity.
   American officials were surprised, however, by the pope's
stipulation that a majority of a university's teachers be Catholic
- a decree Vatican officials acknowledged will be difficult to
carry out in certain countries.
   Archbishop Pio Laghi, head of the Vatican's Congregation for
Catholic Education, said finding a Catholic-majority faculty in
nations like Japan and Indonesia might be impossible.
   ``This should be considered a principle, something that should
be put into effect as much as we can,'' he said.
   The 49-page document, drawn up over 10 years and issued in the
form of a constitution, upheld the right ff academic freedom and
independence. But it also stressed that students and teachers,
particularly theologians, must not stray from official church
teaching.
   ``All Catholic teachers are to be faithful to, and all other
teachers are to respect, Catholic doctrine and morals in their
research and teaching,'' it said.
   American Catholic educators had complained that earlier drafts
threatened to undermine academic freedom and give the church
hierarchy too much control.
   The United States, with 235 Catholic institutes of higher
learning, has the world's largest Catholic university system.
   Sister Alice Gallin of Washington, D.C., executive director of
the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities, said she did
not believe the U.S. system would have to make major changes to
comply with the church's new policy.
   The document says the constitution will go into effect at the
start of the 1991 academic year and applies to all 935 Catholic
universities and institutes throughout the world.
   Four years ago, the presidents of 110 U.S. Catholic institutions
said imposition of the Vatican's original proposals could force
some of the nation's schools to close, drive theologians away and
cost the colleges federal and state student aid.
   The final document says the local bishop ``has a responsibility
to promote the welfare of the Catholic universities in his diocese
and has the right and duty to watch over the preservation and
strengthening of their Catholic character.''
   The document said relations between universities and bishops
should be marked by ``mutual trust, close and consistent
cooperation and continuing dialogue.''
   ``That statement in itself would not disturb anybody here,''
said the Rev. Joseph A. O'Hare, president of Fordham University in
New York and part of a U.S. delegation that conferred with Vatican
officials in April 1989.
   The church recognizes freedom of research and teaching in each
discipline, it says, but stresses that this must be ``in accordance
with its own principles and proper methods.''
   The document singled out the role of theologians, saying they
must ``respect the authority of the bishops and assent to Catholic
doctrine.''
   During John Paul's papacy, several theologians have been
punished for straying from church teaching on sexual and other
issues. They include the Rev. Charles E. Curran, barred from
teaching at Catholic University of America in Washington in 1987.
   Three months ago, the Vatican issued a document ruling out
public dissent by theologians, telling them to uphold church
doctrine or keep quiet.

   The City Council, unable to override a
mayoral veto of its proposed tax on college students' tuition, has
decided to look at other ways of increasing revenue from
Northwestern University.
   Council members voted 10-8 Monday in favor of overriding Mayor
Joan Barr's veto. Twelve votes were needed.
   But the council did establish a three-member committee to look
for other ways to increase the revenue Northwestern brings into the
city.
   Officials said that if approved the tuition tax would have been
the first in the nation.
   Supporters of the tax said it would have offset revenue lost
because Northwestern's 242 acres are not subject to property taxes.
   School officials complained the tax would hurt students.
   The measure called for most students at Northwestern and three
other colleges in the Chicago suburb of 73,000 to pay about $45
annually.
   Alderman Jack Korshak said the measure would have generated more
than $500,000 a year.

   Sandinista peasants and demobilized
Contra rebels fought over land in remote northern Nicaragua, and
seven people were killed, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
   It was the latest in a series of violent incidents in the
hinterland involving land-hungry peasants from the two sides, and
comes amid increasing tensions elsewhere in the country.
   Striking workers at the main government bus depot in Managua
burned tires Tuesday and said they would not allow the vehicles to
leave the yard.
   The strikers, who oppose privatizing public transport and are
demanding higher pay, took over the facility Sept. 17 and since
then have been ousted twice by police.
   On Tuesday morning, they remained outside the locked gates of
the yard, and citizens were forced to use private buses and pickup
trucks to get to work.
   The leftist Sandinista Front and its powerful labor unions
announced a march by teachers Wednesday to kick off a civic protest
that is to culminate next Monday with a nationwide strike.
   On Wednesday President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro is scheduled
to leave for New York, where she is to speak at the United Nations.
   Barricada, official newspaper of the Sandinista Front, said in a
front-page story that seven people were killed and four were
wounded when a group of demobilized rebels tried to take over a
Sandinista cooperative farm called La Dalia.
   The farm is near San Juan de Rio Coco, a village 150 miles
northeast of Managua, in the mountains near the Honduran border.
   Official confirmation of the incident, which Barricada said
occurred Monday afternoon, was not immediately available.
   Spokesmen for the Interior Ministry, in charge of rural police,
and the Sandinista People's Army were in a meeting and not
immediately available for comment, their offices said.
   According to Barricada, the former Contra rebels are in control
of the narrow dirt roads leading into the zone and have erected
roadblocks where passing vehicles are checked.
   Agrarian Reform Minister Gustavo Tablada's deputy, Nemesio
Porras, said Tablada was out of the country, but did not say where.
Tablada's ministry is in charge of more than 3,000 agriculture
cooperatives established during the 10 years of Sandinista rule and
of distributing land to nearly 20,000 rebels who laid down their
weapons earlier this year and returned to civilian life.
   Most of the former Contras are peasants and many had their lands
confiscated by the Sandinistas when they took up arms against the
leftist regime, who lost Feb. 25 elections to Mrs. Chamorro.
   Government officials say they have distributed as much land as
they can to the former guerrillas, who say they want more land
because much of what has been given them is unusable.
   Mrs. Chamorro's government has met with strong Sandinista
opposition in its attempts to rescue Nicaragua's economy.
   Among measures announced by the government is the planned firing
of 25,000 civil servants starting Oct. 1 and the privatization of
hundreds of enterprises confiscated by the Sandinistas.
   The Sandinistas have vowed not to allow that to happen and plan
staggered strikes nationwide, beginning with teachers on Wednesday.

   A bit of high-tech sleuthing enabled burglary
victim Marvin Valento to get back most of his stolen goods, and
enabled police to round up a group of teen-agers on charges in
three robberies.
   ``He's unique. What he did opened up a Pandora's box,'' said
Sgt. John Ballis of the St. Paul burglary unit.
   Valento, 30, reported that his house was broken into Aug. 28 and
a shotgun, audio gear and two telephones were missing. He had
modified the cordless phone's base to pick up sounds whether the
phone was in use.
   ``I told my wife, `I bet those guys are going to use that
phone,' '' Valento said. ``I punched in the phone's frequency on my
police scanner and, sure enough, I got a signal. I said, `I want to
bust these guys.' ''
   Shortly before midnight, Valento discovered the signal in a
nearby house with the aid of the scanner, a directional antenna and
200 feet of extension cord.
   Then he heard a voice describing the burglary. He got a cassette
tape from an all-night convenience store and started recording.
   The next day Valento presented his findings and cassette tape to
detectives.
   The detectives were skeptical, but Ballis said he had heard
enough to apply for a search warrant, which Ramsey County District
Judge David Marsden approved.
   The detectives burst into the house late Aug. 29 and found
everything taken from Valento's house but the shotgun. The cordless
phone was on the second floor, where Valento had said it would be.
   Ballis started asking the youths in the house about other recent
burglaries in Valento's neighborhood. Some of them confessed, and
started naming others. By the time investigators closed the books
on the case, three burglaries had been solved and seven teen-agers
were facing charges.
   ``I outsmarted the criminals. That's the philosophy I'm taking
on it,'' Valento, a computer manufacturing entrepreneur and
electronics hobbyist, said Monday.
   So far, two 14-year-olds and a 16-year-old have been sent to
juvenile institutions, a 17-year-old has been charged with
transporting stolen property, and three 18-year-olds were charged
with burglary.
   ``It just snowballed,'' Ballis said. ``We even got an auto thief
out of the deal. We wouldn't have gotten any of them without Mr.
Valento.''

<TEXT>
   Alexander Solzhenitsyn's proposal to replace the
Soviet Union with an all-Slavic state is destructive and
disrespectful to the country's other ethnic groups, President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Tuesday.
   Solzhenitsyn, the Nobel Prize-winning author who was expelled
from the Soviet Union for treason in 1974, made his proposal in an
article published a week ago by two Soviet newspapers.
   In his first public comment on the article, Gorbachev told the
national legislature that Solzhenitsyn was an ``undoubtedly great
man,'' but ``his views on the future of our multinational state are
unacceptable.''
   Gorbachev cast himself as a politician dedicated to preserving
the Soviet Union as a multiethnic country.
   Several lawmakers also attacked Solzhenitsyn, and none supported
him or came to his defense.
   Solzhenitsyn believes Russia has a unique heritage and destiny,
and he condemns Soviet efforts to bind dozens of disparate cultures
into a single nation.
   Solzhenitsyn, 71, wrote his rambling, philosophical article,
titled ``How We Can Make Russia Comfortable,'' at his home in
Cavendish, Vt. It was published Sept. 18 by the reformist newspaper
Komsomolskaya Pravda and a day later by the literary weekly
Literaturnaya Gazeta.
   The newspapers have a combined circulation of 26.5 million, and
the article was an immediate sensation throughout the country -
discussed on Moscow streets, read by lawmakers and mentioned on the
nightly TV news.
   But until Gorbachev was asked by a lawmaker to comment on the
article Tuesday, there was no public reaction from a top government
official.
   The article, which took up the equivalent of four full newspaper
pages, said communism had taken a flourishing country and turned it
back into a ``half-savage state.''
   But it also expressed disdain for Western ``pop-mass culture''
and urged Russia not to follow the West blindly.
   Solzhenitsyn urged a populist revival ``from below,'' saying
that Russia's villages and rural areas should be the starting point
for the creation of democracy and a healthy economy.
   He also advocated the breakup of collective farms, called for
free enterprise and warned against a political system in which
parties compete for power. ``Every party tries to do its best not
for the whole nation but for itself and its own members,'' he
wrote.
   Gorbachev focused on just one of Solzhenitsyn's many
suggestions: that Russia, Byelorussia, the Ukraine and much of
Kazakhstan, which are inhabited primarily by people of Slavic
extraction, should form a single nation and let the other 11 Soviet
republics secede.
   ``The article and the author's personality demand a very srious
analysis,'' Gorbachev said. ``I am seized by very contradictory
feelings. ... As a Russian, I fully share concern for the destiny
of the Russian people and Russia.
   ``But at the same time, as a Russian, I definitely cannot agree
with Solzhenitsyn's attitude toward other ethnic groups. Even by
the most generous appraisal, it is a disrespectful stand. I cannot
agree with it.''
   Gorbachev added that Solzhenitsyn was ``living entirely in the
past, the past Russia, the czarist monarchy.''
   The writer's views ``are far from reality and ... have a
destructive character,'' he said.
   Gorbachev's remarks came as the national legislature began
debate on how to negotiate a new union treaty with the 15 Soviet
republics. Gorbachev said he wants a ``union of sovereign states''
in which every ethnic group ``feels good and realizes its
potential.''
   Among the lawmakers who criticized Solzhenitsyn was Boris
Oleinik, deputy chairman of the legislature's Council of
Nationalities, who said the writer's views ``belittle the national
dignity'' of many ethnic groups and ``could lead to separatism.''
   Yurii Shcherbak, a lawmaker from the Ukraine, said
Solzhenitsyn's proposals were underlined by ``messianic,
neo-monarchist ideas of great power chauvinism.''
   The lawmaker who asked for Gorbachev's comments was Erkegali
Rakhmadiev of Kazakhstan, who objected to Solzhenitsyn's appeal for
Russians to take control of some Kazakh lands. He said in an
interview later that the writer's proposal was a ``Hitlerite,
fascistic approach.''
   Even delegates from republics that are seeking independence from
the Soviet Union - such as Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Georgia -
did not try to defend Solzhenitsyn.
   One bit of support for Solzhenitsyn came Tuesday from Ryazan,
the city 100 miles southeast of Moscow where Solzhenitsyn wrote his
books ``One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' and ``The Cancer
Ward.'' The city council officially gave him ``the freedom of
Ryazan,'' an honor much like receiving the key to a city.
   Solzhenitsyn's works describe life in Soviet labor camps and
were banned in the Soviet Union from the mid-1960s until after
Gorbachev came to power in 1985. His books, including ``The Gulag
Archipelago,'' are now being published but are still not widely
available.
   Gorbachev restored the writer's citizenship last month but
Solzhenitsyn has expressed reluctance about returning.

   A bathrobe worn by Sherlock Holmes'
creator, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, was sold for more than $2,000 on
Tuesday.
   The century-old, calf-length garment of thick tweed in a light
brown check pattern was offered for sale by a collector and bought
by an anonymous telephone bidder, said Vennett-Smith Auctions of
Goatham near Nottingham.
   The dressing gown was described in a short story, ``The Man with
the Twisted Lip,'' said auctioneer Trevor Vennett-Smith.
   He said Conan Doyle often wore it when writing, and it later
belonged to Sidney Paget, who used it as a model in six of his
illustrations for stories about the fictional detective.
   ``We sell only postcards, cigarette cards and autographs, but we
were offered the dressing gown by a good client and we know that
anything with a Sherlock Holmes connection always sells,'' the
auctioneer said.
   The sale price was 1,100 pounds, or $2,068.

   Syrian President Hafez Assad left Tehran
on Tuesday after a four-day visit, and sources said he failed to
win a pledge from his Iranian allies not to send food and other
essentials to Iraq.
   Sources close to the Syrian delegation quoted Assad as saying
Tehran did promise not to buy embargoed Iraqi oil, or to help
Baghdad export its crude through Iranian pipelines.
   Iran has said it will enforce sanctions on neighboring Iraq
imposed by the United Nations after Saddam Hussein's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.
   The United States has formed a new alliance with Syria since
Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. Assad, who met earlier this month in
Damascus with Secretary of State James A. Baker III, is believed to
have gone to Tehran at Washington's behest to gauge the seriousness
of Iran's suggestions it would send essentials to Iraq.
   But the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Washington's main concern was whether the Iranians intended to help
Iraq export oil, its main source of revenue, through their
pipelines.
   In his meetings with Assad, Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani
insisted that food supplies to Iraq - Iran's foe in the 1980-88
Persian Gulf war - did not violate those sanctions because
``humanitarian shipments'' are permitted, the sources said.
   Assad has sent 4,000 commandos to join the U.S.-led
multinational force in Saudi Arabia and has pledged to send an
armored division as well.
   Saddam, internationally isolated and squeezed by the embargo,
suddenly made peace with Iran last month, ending two years of
deadlocked peace talks.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency reported Sunday that Iranian
authorities had arrested 29 smugglers trying to move foodstuffs
across the border into Iraq - the first report of Iran taking steps
to enforce the sanctions.
   The sources said Assad carried a message to Rafsanjani from
Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, calling for an improvement in the
strained relations between the Moslem rivals if Tehran blocked
supplies to Iraq and sent troops to join the multinational force
confronting Saddam.
   Iran rejected the Saudi conditions, the sources said.
   The Saudi Foreign Minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, flew to
Damascus shortly before Assad to get a first-hand account of the
talks in Tehran, Arab diplomats said.
   Rafsanjani, leader of the country's so-called pragmatists, is
eager to rebuild bridges with the West and is believed to favor
abiding by the sanctions.
   But he is under pressure from his powerful, vehemently
anti-American radical rivals who want Iran to help Iraq confront
``The Great Satan.''
   The Iranians have condemned the Iraqi invasion. But they have
also criticized Fahd for allowing non-Moseem Western forces into
Saudi Arabia, where Islam's holiest shrines at Mecca and Medina are
located.
   Riyadh severed ties with Tehran in 1987, citing subversion and
terrorism.
   The sources reported that Assad had some differences with
Iranian leaders. But they said these were not so great as to drive
a wedge between Tehran and its Arab ally.
   Before leaving Tehran, Assad told a news conference that he and
Rafsanjani were in ``complete agreement'' on issues concerning the
gulf, Tehran Radio reported.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Rafsanjani as
confirming that ``on the gulf crisis our stance was completely in
line with Syria's.''
   Assad was originally due to leave Tehran on Sunday, but he
extended his stay an extra day.
   The sources said another item discussed in the meetings was the
fate of 13 Western hostages held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon,
where Syria is the main power broker.
   No results of the meetings were announced.
   Iranian diplomats said last week when Assad's visit was
announced that some hostages could soon be freed.
   Most of the captives - six Americans, four Britons, two West
Germans and an Italian - are held by Shiite Moslem factions linked
to the fundamentalist Hezbollah, Tehran's main ally in Lebanon.
   The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was abducted March 16,
1985.

   The United States is considering a
Romanian offer to put up thousands of U.S. troops on their way to
and from the Arabian peninsula in luxury resorts free of charge,
officials said Tuesday.
   The offer would apply through the winter and would be extended
to British and Canadian troops as well, Economics Minister Eugen
Dijmarescu said.
   If the offer is accepted, Romania would become the first member
of the crumbling Soviet-led Warsaw Pact to permit U.S and other
NATO troops on its territory.
   The Romanian proposal was revealed two days before the departure
of President Ion Iliescu for the United States.
   Iliescu, a former Communist who took power during the December
revolution that ousted Nicolae Ceausescu and won popular elections
in May, is seeking to repair his image in the United States.
   An official at the U.S. Embassy described the Romanian offer as
``a gesture of support for the West in the gulf crisis.''
   The official, speaking on condition on anonymity, said Romanian
officials contacted the embassy last week and offered ``R-and-R
facilities for American troops both in the mountains and on the
Black Sea coast, on favorable terms.''

<HEAD>New Bolivian Law Returns Rain Forests to Indians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER McFARREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bolivia on Tuesday gave its Indians
control of vast tracts of troical rain forest and moved to limit
exploitation by logging companies.
   ``I have the feeling we are writing one of the most beautiful
and clean pages in the contemporary history of Bolivia,'' President
Jaime Paz Zamora said Monday night during a meeting with leaders of
Bolivia's lowland Indian community.
   The measures were enacted after 800 Indians from the lowland
rain forests made a 35-day march across the Andes to the capital,
La Paz, to bring attention to the destruction of their environment.
   The destruction of South America's tropical rain forests has
become a major international concern, because of the loss of
irreplaceable species of plants and animals and because it may
contribute to global warming.
   Under the new law, 1.9 million acres of land in the Beni
tropical lowlands will be under the control of Chimane Indians.
   Two logging companies with operations in the area will be able
to take wood from the forests only until Dec. 31. After that, they
will be allowed to bid for logging in new areas, under
government-established ecological guidelines.
   Four other logging companies that have contracts for another
year will be able to continue with operations, the government says.
But once the contracts expire, new concessions will not be granted
on the lands whose control was ceded over the Indians.
   Bolivia's lumber companies and some other business leaders
warned that limiting logging concessions would hurt foreign
investment in the country.
   Logging companies mainly harvest mahogony trees, most of the
wood bound for the lucrative export market. Bolivia exported $40
million worth of fine woods in 1989, the government says.
   ``We are returning to our homes with dignity and with the
knowledge that we have recovered our territories,'' said Indian
leader Ernesto Noe. ``We have managed to have doors opened to us
and that our proposals be heard.''
   The group of Indians, including women and children, marched 470
miles from the city of Trinidad to La Paz, which is 13,000 feet
above sea level.
   At least 150,000 Indians live in the tropical rain forests
northeast of La Paz. Two-thirds of Bolivia is made up of tropical
lowlands. The Indians are mainly nomadic hunters, fishermen or work
as hired hands at cattle ranches.

   Congress today took the first step to delay
$85 billion in imminent spending cuts and President Bush vowed to
veto such a measure.
   ``So if there is no budget agreement with real spending
reductions and real process reform by the end of the week, I will

the Oval Office.
   ``I do not want to see further delay in kicking this problem on

   The president said he would veto any congressional resolution
that postpones the deadline for the administration and Congress to
agree on deficit reductions.
   He made the comments after a key House panel voted to do just
that. THe president commended Republicans who opposed the action
and accused Democrats of trying to avoid their fiscal
responsibility.

leaders have said they will press for an extension if a budget deal

<HEAD>Surgeon General Offers Same Word to Smokers: Quit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Smokers who quit can attain within 10 to 15
years nearly the same chance for a long life as those who never
smoked at all, according to Surgeon General Antonia C. Novello.
   Her first report on smoking - the 21st by a surgeon general
since 1964 - said 50 million Americans continue the tobacco habit,
though nearly half of all living adults who ever tried it have
quit. It said 390,000 die each year from diseases attributed to
smoking.
   ``The earlier one quits, the greater the benefits,'' Novello
said. But ``even people who quit smoking at older ages can expect
to enjoy a longer and healthier life compared with those who
continue to smoke.''
   Her report echoed many of the findings of her predecessors, but
it was the first to stress the benefits of quitting, rather than
the risks posed to those who ignore the medical warnings about
tobacco.
   For example, it emphasized that people who quit before age 50
have half the risk of dying in the next 16.5 years compared with
continuing smokers. And for all age groups, it said, 10 to 15 years
of abstinence can improve an ex-smoker's outlook for life to nearly
the level of those who never smoked.
   Novello's report is based largely on previously unpublished data
from an American Cancer Society study.
   Because the health benefits of quitting are so great, health
insurance plans routinely should cover smoking cessation programs,
said Dr. William Roper, director of the federal Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta.
   States also should add that benefit to their Medicaid programs,
he said. Federal officials are considering whether to add the
coverage to Medicare, which provides health care for the elderly
and disabled, but congressional action would probably also be
necessary to accomplish that, he said.
   Officials did not have cost estimates for adding coverage of
smoking cessation to health plans. However, they said 90 percent of
people who quit smoking do so on their own without the aid of a
program.
   Among other findings of the Novello report:
   -Men with a pack-a-day habit are 27 times more likely than
nonsmokers to die of lung cancer, the nation's leading cause of
cancer death. Women who smoke at this rate have 16 times the risk
of nonsmokers.
   -Quitting smoking steadily reduces the lung cancer risk. After a
decade of abstinence, ex-smokers have 30 percent to 50 percent the
risk of dying of lung cancer as continuing smokers. The risk
continues to decline as the period of abstinence lengthens.
   -Quitting also reduces the risk of cancers of the larynx, mouth,
esophagus, pancreas and bladder.
   -Smoking during pregnancy doubles the risk of having a
low-birthweight baby. About 25 percent of pregnant women smoke.
Those who quit after three to four months of pregnancy can reduce
the risk to the child, but simply cutting back without quitting
appears to have little or no benefit.
   -Smokers are twice as likely to die of heart disease, the
leading cause of death, as nonsmokers. They can cut the excess risk
in half after only a year of not smoking, the report said. The risk
keeps declining with future years of abstinence.
   -Quitting also reduces risk of dying from stroke, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, influenza, pneumonia, peripheral
artery occlusive disease and aortic aneurysm.
   Additionally, quitting smoking lowers the risk of developing
gastric or duodenal ulcers, the report said.
   The average weight gain by smokers when they quit is five
pounds, but this poses very little health risk, the report said.
Less than 4 percent who quit gain more than 20 pounds, it said.
   The extent to which quitting the habit will improve health and
reverse the health damages caused by smoking depends on how long
and how much someone has smoked, the report noted.
   But even smokers who have already have developed smoking-related
disease or symptoms can benefit from quitting, it said. Studies
have found that cancer patients who quit smoking lower their risk
of getting a second primary cancer.

<HEAD>Former Governor's Aide Sentenced to 46 Months in Money-Laundering
Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The onetime chief of staff to former Gov. Jerry
Brown has been sentenced to 46 months in prison for conspiring to
launder $300,000 that an undercover FBI agent told him was
Colombian drug money.
   U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving on Monday also fined
Richard Silberman $5,500 and said he would decide by next week
whether to raise that to the maximum $75,000.
   Silberman was arrested at a San Diego hotel in April 1989.
Prosecutors said he was attempting to negotiate a $1.1 million
money laundering deal with FBI agent Peter Ahearn, whom Silberman
thought was an associate of Colombian cocaine traffickers.
   Silberman apologized before his sentencing ``for the hurt and
the pain'' he caused his wife, San Diego County Supervisor Susan
Golding, and other family members.
   ``I accept full responsibility for what I did and it won't
happen again,'' he told Irving.
   Silberman, 61, was Brown's chief of staff in the 1970s and an
influential Democratic party fund-raiser for years. The former
financier also served on several state commissions and donated
money to many non-profit groups in San Diego.
   ``It is clear to me that you have achieved more than most men
could ever dream of. Your contributions to this community have been
significant,'' Irving told him during sentencing.
   ``What boggles my mind is that you chose to become ... part of
the chain that brought poison into the community that you had
supported for years.''
   Silberman was accused of masterminding the laundering of
$300,000 in purported drug profits during the FBI scam.
   A jury convicted him in June of structuring a financial
transaction to avoid federal currency laws, but deadlocked on six
other counts, including conspiracy.
   He pleaded guilty Aug. 24 to the single conspiracy count in
exchange for the dropping of the other charges.
   Authorities say Chris Petti, a reputed mobster, introduced
Silberman to Ahearn through Robert Benjamin, a longtime
acquaintance of Petti's who was working secretly as a government
informant. Petti faces trial Oct. 3.
   In his plea bargain, Silberman admitted exchanging $100,000 for
shares of Yuba American Gold Ltd. stock for Ahearn in November
1988. The company was a financially strapped Northern California
gold-mining venture Silberman headed at the time.
   Ahearn and Silberman conducted a $200,000 transaction three
months later. Silberman testified during his trial that it was the
agent's idea to buy U.S. Treasury bonds that time instead of more
Yuba American Gold stock.
   He also testified he didn't want to complete the second deal,
but Benjamin threatened to harm him and his family if he didn't.
   Golding appeared dejected as she sat behind her husband with her
teen-age daughter and other family members at Monday's sentencing.
   ``I love you,'' she called out as he was led off to jail.
   ``The only thing I can say is that when someone you love is in
trouble, you do the best to stand by them,'' she said outside
court.

<HEAD>FDA Clears Most Foods On Pesticide Threat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly all U.S.-produced foods and 96 percent
of imported foods tested last year met government standards for
pesticide residues, the Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday.
   In its annual study of pesticide residues, the FDA said most of
the violations found during the regular testing involved pesticides
being used on types of produce for which use of the chemicals is
not allowed.
   The violation rate in regular testing was about the same as for
the three previous years for both domestic and imported foods, the
FDA said.
   However, the violation rate in targeted testing of U.S.-produced
food where residue problems were known or suspected jumped from 25
percent in 1988 to 33 percent last year.
   Still, FDA Acting Commissioner James Benson said the report
``again demonstrates that the American food supply is the safest in
the world - and far freer from pesticide residues than many
Americans imagine.''
   But the U.S. Public Interest Research Group called the FDA's
assessment ``an outrageous distortion.'' Rick Hind, environmental
program director for the group, said some of the sample sizes were
too small to be meaningful.
   For example, he said, the FDA tested only 18 cranberries.
Pesticide residues were found in 16 of them, though the level in
each was under the tolerance limit set by the Environmental
Protection Agency. Such a finding should have prompted more testing
of that food type, he said.
   The report also shows that of the domestic samples, 63 percent
of apples, 86 percent of grapefruit and 75 percent of celery had
residues, though within tolerance limits, he said.
   ``The federal government is presenting these numbers to prove
the long-held political opinion that pesticide residues are not a
problem,'' he said.
   Hind's group also takes issue with the tolerance levels set by
EPA.
   The FDA tested 7,394 samples of commonly consumed domestic foods
and 10,719 imports during regular surveillance monitoring in fiscal
1989.
   Of these, 1 percent of the domestic samples and 4 percent of
imports violated pesticide residue limits, the report said.
   The agency also analyzed 304 domestic and 381 imported samples
in compliance testing last year. Of these, 33 percent of domestic
and 16 percent of imports were in violation.
   The agency tested for 270 pesticides and found 108. The report
said this is about the same as found in previous years.
   Imported foods had higher levels of pesticide residues across
most of the food groups, according to the repor.
   Milk, eggs and other dairy products were most often found to be
free of residue. The FDA was unable to detect any residues in 90
percent of the imports and 87 percent of the domestic samples in
this category. Also none of the samples in this group was in
violation of the tolerance limits.
   Fruits were more likely to contain residues. The report said 56
percent of the domestic samples and 60 percent of imports had no
trace of pesticides, while 43 percent of domestic and 38 percent of
imported fruit samples had residues within the tolerance levels.

<HEAD>House Panel Sends Along Measure to Rescind China's Favored Trade
Status</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plans were laid Tuesday for a showdown in the
House on whether to allow China to export billions of dollars in
toys and clothing to the United States under low tariffs despite
Beijing's alleged human rights abuses.
   The House Ways and Means Committee, on a voice vote without
dissent but contrary to the views of most of its members, sent to
the full House a measure that would undo President Bush's decision
to continue China's ``most favored nation'' trade status.
   The vote effectively allows the measure to be paired against a
bill the committee endorsed in July that would maintain low tariffs
on Chinese imports another year but condition them after that to
``significant progress'' by Beijing on human rights issues.
   ``While I disapprove this resolution, I don't want to play games
with it,'' said Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., chairman of the panel's
trade subcommittee and a leading proponent of untying trade to
human rights and diplomatic issues.
   The Bush administration vigorously opposes suspending China's
10-year-old status as a most-favored-nation trading partner, which
effectively reduces the tariffs on Chinese imports by 90 percent.
   A Chinese-made sweater with an import price of $20 now carries a
tariff of $1.20 cents. Without most-favored status, it would cost
$32 to import the sweater.
   The United States imported about $12 billion in Chinese goods
last year and sent to China some $5.8 billion in U.S. exports.
   Amnesty International and a coalition of other human rights,
labor and Chinese student groups want normal trade status suspended
because of Beijing's forced suppression of Tiananmen Square
demonstrators in June 1989.
   ``So what if the president vetoes this resolution and Congress
fails to override him,'' said Rep. Richard Schulze, R-Pa. ``At
least the Chinese government will understand that the ground it
stands on in the eyes of Americans is, at best, extremely shaky. A
conditionality bill ... just won't get this message across.''
   Similar measures disapproving Bush's continuation of
most-favored-trade status for China have been introduced in the
Senate by Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and Sens.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., and Alan Dixon, D-Ill.
   However, none of them have the support of Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which has
postponed action until after the full House acts.
   In a related action, the Ways and Means panel on Tuesday also
approved granting lower most-favored-nation tariffs to
Czechoslovakia under a trade agreement signed between the two
countries last April.

   Kentucky First Lady Martha Wilkinson, who
hopes to succeed her husband in office, has some work to do on her
image before next year's elections, according to poll results
released Tuesday.
   Bluegrass State Poll results published in The Courier-Journal,
showed just 22 percent of the state's registered Democrats had a
favorable opinion of Mrs. Wilkinson. Forty-four percent held an
unfavorable view.
   When asked about the survey's findings, Ed Lynch, Mrs.
Wilkinson's press secretary, said, ``We can't be too discouraged
this far away'' from the election.
   The poll also found that Gov. Wallace Wilkinson's
job-performance rating has dropped significantly from five months
ago.
   In the latest poll, 49 percent of Kentucky adults approved of
the job Wilkinson is doing as governor, while 41 percent
disapproved and the rest had no opinion.
   In April, 57 percent approved of Wilkinson's work as governor.
Since then, the tax increases the governor supported in the 1990
General Assembly have taken effect, and his wife has begun
campaigning to succeed him.
   The survey also asked respondents to rate three other major
candidates running in next year's Democratic gubernatorial primary.
   Lt. Gov. Brereton Jones had the best overall standing among
registered Democrats, with a favorable-unfavorable ratio of
slightly more than 3 to 1. Lexington Mayor Scotty Baesler's ratio
was a little better than 2{ to 1, while Dr. Floyd Poore's was about
even.
   Although Mrs. Wilkinson had twice as many viewing her
unfavorably as favorably, she is by far the best-known candidate.
Most Democrats had an opinion of her.
   Sixty-eight percent said they were undecided or hadn't heard
enough about Jones to have an opinion, as did 73 percent for
Baesler and 84 percent for Poore.
   The poll was conducted from Sept. 13-19. The margin of error for
the governor's job rating was plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
The margin for the favorable-unfavorable ratings was plus or minus
5 points.

<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo, widely viewed as a
potential 1992 presidential candidate, raised the prospect Tuesday
that he might run for a fourth term as New York's governor in 1994.
   Democrat Cuomo is running for re-election to a third term this
year and already has reported raising about $8 million for his
campaign.
   His comments about his political future came as the governor
defended his contribution of just $55,000 from his campaign war
chest to crucial state Senate races.
   ``You have to be very judicious about how you spend the money,''
the governor said. ``How much do I need here? Will I run a fourth
time if I win now? Where will I get the money for it?''
   In contrast to Cuomo, Republican gubernatorial candidate Pierre
Rinfret has reported raising less than $1 million and has said his
campaign is broke.
   Cuomo has said that having Democrats take control of the Senate
this year is one of his priorities. Cuomo noted that he has
conducted fundraisers to benefit Senate Democrats that had raised
at least $300,000 for them.

<HEAD>Preston Calls Off Recount in New Hampshire Governor's Race</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Democrat Robert Preston has called off the
recount he requested of last week's New Hampshire gubernatorial
primary results, acknowledging his rival, Joe Grandmaison, as the
Democratic nominee.
   The recount was little more than half finished when Preston
called it off on Monday, saying it appeared there would be no
further significant changes in the vote totals.
   Grandmaison came out of the primary 1,134 votes ahead, but,
before the recount began, revisions cut his lead to 593. Other
minor adjustments during the rcount cut the lead to ``about 550
votes,'' according to Preston.
   Preston, the state Senate Minority Leader, wished Grandmaison
well in his campaign against Republican Gov. Judd Gregg and thanked
his supporters.

<HEAD>Imelda Marcos, Granted Immunity, Testifies Before Grand Jury</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Imelda Marcos testified with immunity Tuesday
before a federal grand jury investigating allegations that
Westinghouse Electric Corp. bribed her late husband to secure a
nuclear power plant contract.
   The former first lady of the Philippines, who was greeted by
cheering supporters as she entered and left the courthouse,
testified for more than two hours in the morning and returned in
the afternoon.
   The questioning was led by Theodore Greenberg, deputy chief of
the U.S. Justice Department's fraud division.
   Mrs. Marcos' attorney, James P. Linn, said she was questioned
more ``about the jewelry on her hands'' than her knowledge of any
illegal payoffs to her husband, Ferdinand, the former Philippine
president.
   ``That's not the purpose of the United States government,'' Linn
told reporters before climbing into a limousine with Mrs. Marcos
and some of her entourage.
   The grand jury subpoenaed Mrs. Marcos in connection with
allegations that Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse paid $17.3 million
in bribes to associates of Marcos and to the former president, who
held office from 1965 until he was deposed in 1986. Officials
haven't named the targets of the criminal probe.
   The bribery allegations were made in a civil lawsuit Philippine
government filed in 1988 against Westinghouse.
   Linn said Mrs. Marcos knows nothing about any payments.
   ``Ferdinand Marcos was not the kind of man who sat down every
night and discussed business with his wife,'' he said.
   Many in the crowd of about 100 Filipino-Americans said they
thought Mrs. Marcos is being made a scapegoat by the U.S.
government at the request of Philippine President Corazon Aquino.
   Signs they carried read, ``U.S. Stop Harassing Imelda,''
``Imelda Not Guilty, Send Her Home,'' and ``Enough is Enough, Free
Imelda Now.''
   In addition to the bribery allegations, the Philippine
government also charges that the never-used nuclear plant, located
on the Bataan Peninsula about 60 miles west of Manila, was flawed
and its construction was substandard.
   Westinghouse, in a statement issued Tuesday, said the Philippine
government has refused to operate the plant for political reasons.
The company said it never has been charged with wrongdoing in
connection with the plant, despite more than a dozen years of
investigations.
   ``The allegations of improper conduct are stale, unfounded and
should be finally put to rest,'' Westinghouse said.
   ``Mrs. Marcos has no connection with Westinghouse, and she will
have nothing to add to this drawn-out investigation,'' the company
said. ``We do not understand why she has been subpoenaed to
testify. Apparently, neither does she.''
   The company said in another statement, issued last week, that it
paid $17 million over 10 years to sales representatives who helped
secure the contract for the $2.3 billion plant.
   Mrs. Marcos was acquitted in July of unrelated federal fraud
charges after a 10-week trial in New York. Prosecutors in that case
alleged she helped her husband loot their country's treasury of
more than $220 million, using the money to buy New York real
estate, art and jewelry.
   She still faces several federal lawsuits, Linn said.
   He dismissed suggestions that his client needed immunity to
testify.
   ``The government requested it and we had no objection,'' he
said. ``No lawyer in his right mind would decline immunity.''

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki will
make a quick visit to the United States to meet with President
Bush, the government said Tuesday.
   Mazowiecki, who is expected to announce his decision soon to run
for president against Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, was to arrive
Friday in the United States and see Bush on Saturday.
   He also planned to take part in the UNICEF-sponsored Convention
on the Rights of the Child in New York, said government spokesman
Krzysztof Bakalarski.
   Walesa picked Mazowiecki to be prime minister after Solidarity
triumphed in June 1989 elections over the Communists. But recently
Solidarity has split into two camps. Walesa claims the government
is going too slow in transforming the country from Communism.
   Polish officials are worried the political split in Solidarity
could erode U.S. sympathy for Poland. They would like the feud to
be viewed in the West as part of the normal process of democracy.
   The Polish elections are to be held by the end of December to
replace President Wojciech Jaruzelski, the former Communist Party
leader who has agreed to curtail his six-year term by 4{ years.
   Mazowiecki is on a four-day visit to Spain, where he is meeting
with King Juan Carlos and Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez.
   On Monday, Mazowiecki committed a Polish field hospital and
medical ship to the gulf region in support of the U.S.-led economic
blockade of Iraq.

   NEW ORLEANS (AP - Call it body art.
   Robert Fleisher, who calls himself an art collector, scrutinized
the field at the Tattoo Expo '90 and then stripped to the waist,
leaving his body in the hands of Ronald Bonkerk of Amsterdam, a man
Fleisher refers to as a ``Dutch master.''
   ``I have well over 100 tattoos. I'll keep going until I run out
of places to put them,'' said Fleisher, a 53-year-old retired
automobile salesman from Philadelphia. ``The human body is just a
canvas for these artists.''
   Fleisher was just one of hundreds at the Clarion hotel during
the four-day Tattoo Expo '90 that ended Sunday.
   Needles buzzed constantly at the booths. Women in bikinis and
bare-chested men showed off their tattoos or added new ones. Others
were more circumspect.
   ``All of my tattoos are covered,'' said Janet Rivard, a
34-year-old registered nurse from Sacramento, Calif. ``I don't mind
showing them, but I like it to be my choice.''
   Rivard started with a small flower design on her right breast,
then added a full color lynx that covers her entire left buttock,
before having a lion's head done on her stomach to cover an
appendectomy scar.
   ``Our shop is near a college, and we have a lot of college girls
come in,'' said Susan Agan of Susan and Critter Tattooing in Troy,
N.Y. ``They don't want their tattoos seen. They want them to be
something they can share in intimate situations. Something only
seen when they're undressed.''

<HEAD>Investigators Cite Pilot Error, Poor Management In Hawaii Air
Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigators said Tuesday that one of
the worst commuter air crashes in U.S. aviation history occurred
last year when the pilot flew into a bank of clouds at a
dangerously low altitude and slammed into a mountain ridge on
Hawaii's Molokai Island.
   All 20 people aboard the Aloha IslandAir plane were killed in
the Oct. 28, 1989 accident, including eight members of the Molokai
High School volleyball team.
   The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the
probable cause of the accident was the decision of the pilot,
Captain Bruce Pollard, 30, to continue the flight into clouds that
obscured the rising mountainous terrain.
   But it also blamed the management of the commuter airline, Aloha
IslandAir, for inadequate supervision of its personnel and for
inadequate training and operations.
   And it said the Federal Aviation Administration had failed to
provide adequate supervision of Aloha IslandAir operations,
particularly at a time when it was rapidly expanding its
operations.
   ``When you're operating, carrying passengers, there is an
enormous responsibility there to the public,'' said Susan Coughlin,
the safety board's vice chairman, after the board's morning-long
examination of the accident.
   ``They were not taking the care that was necessary to assure
safe flight, and that is the responsibility of an air carrier,''
she told reporters.
   Safety board members said that any one of a dozen factors could
have resulted in preventing the Aloha IslandAir accident, plus two
earlier ones in Hawaii.
   And they said it could have been avoided altogether had the
plane been equipped with a ground proximity warning device.
   The safety board said radar data revealed that the aircraft had
descended from its intended cruising altitude of 1,000 feet to 500
feet when the crash occurred.
   Safety board staff members said flying at such a low altitude is
prohibited by FAA regulations and is ``basically illegal.''
   Ms. Coughlin noted that investigators had discovered that Aloha
IslandAir had cut back required pilot training from the 44 hours
ordered by the FAA to 24 hours.
   ``I would consider that a pretty important factor in this
accident,'' she said.
   The board said Pollard had a record of ``performance
difficulties'' before joining AlohaAir, including a 180-day
suspension.
   And it faulted airline management for not adequately checking
Pollard's background before hiring him.
   It also said that the first officer on the flight had not
received FAA-approved ground training and was therefore
disqualified to serve in that capacity.

   The head of the International Monetary Fund
welcomed Soviet officials to its annual meeting for the first time
Tuesday and told them that a study underway could help them get aid
from the West.
   The Soviet delegation was led by Viktor Geraschenko, head of the
USSR State Bank, and included Soviet Finance MinisterValentin
Pavlov.
   IMF managing director Michael Camdessus welcomed the Soviet
``invitees.''
   ``The Soviet Union is not a member,'' Camdessus said. ``Yet we
are all watching with interest, and sympathy, the efforts of the
Soviet Union to move toward a market-oriented and more efficient
economy.''
   He noted the United States and other major governments have
asked the fund and three more international organizations to study
the Soviet economy. The study, due by the end of the year, would
``make recommendations for its reform and ... establish the
criteria under which Western economic assistance could effectively
support these reforms,'' he said.
   The Soviets sat toward the back of the vast hotel ballroom used
for the speech-making plenary session. There are 152 governments in
the fund and its sister organization, the World Bank, including
China and some Eastern European nations.
   Barber B. Conable, president of the World Bank, also welcomed
the Soviets.
   ``The welcome presence here of guests from the Soviet Union is a
symbol of the mutual willingness to explore the great issues of
reform,'' he said in his opening speech.
   Conable is American, Camdessus is French.
   Soviet leaders have said they want to join all international
organizations, including the bank, the fund and the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The Bush administration have
opposed their membership.
   An international monetary official, who asked that his name not
be used, said a major reason for delay at this point is the
political turmoil inside the Soviet Union. Several of the Soviet
republics have sought independence from Moscow.

   Here are the Environmental Protection Agency's
fuel economy ratings for 1991 model cars, vans and light trucks.
   The first column gives the manufacturer and the model. A ``d''
after the name indicates the vehicle has a diesel engine; a ``g''
indicates the car is subject to the gas guzzler tax; and a ``p''
indicates the car uses premium gasoline.
   The second column shows miles per gallon in city driving; the
third column miles per gallon in highway driving; and the fourth
column miles per gallon combining both city and highway driving.
   The fifth column indicates engine displacement in cubic inches
and the number of cylinders.
   The last column indicates the type of transmission and the
number of gears. An ``A'' designation indicates automatic
transmission. An ``L'' designation indicates automatic transmission
with a fuel-saving device that eliminates slippage. An ``M''
designation indicates manuel transmission. For example, an ``A4''
means a four-speed automatic transmission; an ``M5'' means a
five-speed manuel transmission; and an ``L3'' means a three-speed
automatic transmission with a fuel-saving anti-slippage device.
   In some cases identical car listings with the same engine
displacement, cylinders and transmission may show slightly
different mileage because of equipment or other differences not
shown in the table.
   The mileage figures reflect test conditions. For some years the
EPA has adjusted the test results through the use of a weighting
formula so the mileage more closely reflects actual driving
conditions. The combined mileage is calculated on an assumption
that 55 percent of the miles driven are driven under city
conditions.
   The mileage tests are conducted by the manufacturer with about
30 percent confirmed in separate tests by the EPA. Some
manufacturers may not have completed tests in time and their cars
are not listed.

<HEAD>AMA Complains to Bush About Medicare Investigator</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Medical Association asked
President Bush on Tuesday to fire a government official who
physicians say has been reckless and unfair in his investigation of
Medicare and Medicaid fraud.
   The AMA, in a letter to the president, said that in carrying out
his oversight duties at the Department of Health and Human
Services, Inspector General Richard Kusserow has discredited the
administration.
   ``Competent and honest physicians have been damaged and many
more have been unnecessarily harassed,'' the AMA letter said.
   Kusserow was out of town Tuesday and could not be reached for
comment. His spokeswoman, Judy Holtz, said the office was surprised
by the AMA's action. She said she ould not comment, except to say:
``The inspector general's record speaks for itself.''
   Rep. Fortney ``Pete'' Stark, D-Calif., chairman of the House
Ways and Means subcommittee on health, quickly came to Kusserow's
defense, putting out a statement shortly after the AMA released its
letter to reporters.
   ``Criticism from the AMA is a red badge of courage to Mr.
Kusserow,'' said Stark, whose proposals often are opposed by
physicians.
   ``Anyone who resists giving the AMA completely free access to
the Treasury and the taxpayer's wallet is immediately branded by
the AMA as anti-doctor,'' he said. ``Dick Kusserow should get a
medal for saving the taxpayer fortunes. That he is being criticized
today is a sure sign he is doing his job.''
   Dr. Robert McAfee, vice chairman of the AMA Board of Trustees,
said frustration over Kusserow's actions has built up over the last
five years to the point that ``physicians don't trust him any
more.''
   McAfee said the AMA wants incompetent and dishonest physicians
out of the Medicaid and Medicare programs and out of the medical
profession as much as Kusserow.
   But, McAffee said, the AMA has had to go to court to win
fundamental protections for physicians accused of misconduct and to
dismantle a reward system for enforcers working for Kusserow.
   The AMA was particularly upset by Kusserow's statements last
week on ABC's ``Prime Time Live,'' in which he said a physician who
had been kicked out of the Medicare program and later killed
himself had been a drug abuser. Later in the segment, Kusserow was
reported to have retracted his comment a week after the interview
was taped, saying drug use was not an issue in the case.

<HEAD>House Committee Votes Extra $2 Billion For Persian Gulf Operations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Appropriations Committee voted an
extra $2 billion Tuesday to pay for U.S. military operations in the
Persian Gulf and proposed that the president be allowed to activate
reservists for up to 12 months.
   Present law limits such callups without congressional approval
to a total of six months.
   The votes came as the committee approved legislation designed to
keep the government operating until Oct. 20. The stopgap measure is
necessary because Congress has not enacted any of the 13 annual
appropriations bills for the budget year, which begins Oct. 1.
   There was no debate on the additional money for Persian Gulf
operations or on giving the president authority to call up
reservists for longer periods. A related provision, appropriating
$20 million in ``imminent-danger'' pay for U.S. forces in the gulf
region, also was approved without controversy.
   But President Bush's recommendation that $6.7 billion in
Egyptian debt be forgiven in recognition of Egypt's support in the
gulf was put aside for fear it would fail if brought to a vote.
   Instead, the committee accepted a plan by Reps. David Obey,
D-Wis., and Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., to make Egypt eligible for
additional aid. Under the law, aid may not be extended to a nation
that is a year or more in arrears in repaying earlier assistance.
Egypt will be a year behind in payments starting Oct. 4.
   Several members of the panel praised Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak's courage in sending thousands of troops to Saudi Arabia to
help U.S. forces defend against a possible attack by Iraq.
   ``His life is really on the line,'' said Rep. Bob Livingston,
R-La.
   The debt is bound to be forgiven sooner or later, said Rep. C.W.
Bill Young, R-Fla. ``Why do we hang President Mubarak out to dry
while we play with smoke and mirrors? Why give radical Arabs in
Egypt a reason to go against President Mubarak?''
   Rep. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., said forgiving the debt might send a
signal that the United States was trying to buy Egypt's support.
``We are rapidly approaching a crisis in our country. What is the
message to the American people on forgiving a $7 billion debt'' at
a time when many Americans fear loss of jobs because of a slumping
economy, he asked.
   The bill could be considered by the House on Thursday, giving
mebers their first opportunity to cast a meaningful vote on the
gulf operations.

<HEAD>Senate Approves $7 Billion Increase for Agriculture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate voted Tuesday to spend $52.3
billion on agriculture and rural development programs in fiscal
1991, an increase of about $7 billion over the current year.
   The 79-19 vote sends the bill to a conference committee with the
House, whose version is about $1.9 billion less costly.
   Unlike the House, the Senate supplied $325.8 million in its bill
to continue federal crop insurance, a subsidized program through
which private insurance companies protect farmers from the
potential financial ruin of weather disasters.
   The House, favoring direct aid for weather disasters, voted to
spend $101.5 million on a phase-out program for crop insurance.
Agriculture interests in the House counted on the Senate to save
the program and planned to fight for it in conference committee.
   All but about $10.17 billion of the total appropriations bill is
earmarked for entitlement programs, such as food stamps, which are
protected from deficit reduction cuts.
   Many of these programs require increased spending because of
increased participation.
   Food stamp participation, for example, was up to 20 million
people by the end of the fiscal year, the highest since 1985. The
Senate voted to spend $19 billion on food stamps next year, about
$12 million more than the House approved.
   The bill also provides $2.35 billion for the popular WIC feeding
program for poor pregnant women, nursing mothers and their infants.
It funds the special milk program in schools, subsidizes school
lunches and breakfasts and supplies money for several other
nutrition programs.
   Other agriculture programs supported by money in the bill
include administrative operations, rural development and
international programs. The bill also funds the Food and Drug
Administration and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
   The money that goes for subsidies on certain commodities is
subject to deficit reduction cuts and could be adjusted after a
budget agreement is reached.

<TEXT>
   Reducing world poverty remains the major
challenge of the World Bank, despite new efforts to deal with the
Gulf crisis and emerging democracies, the bank president said
Tuesday.
   ``As the 1990s unfold, success in reducing poverty should be the
measure of global economic progress,'' bank President Barber
Conable told the opening session of the bank and International
Monetary Fund's annual meetings.
   ``We meet in the shadow of the Gulf crisis,'' Conable said. ``We
meet as Eastern European nations are attempting to transform
themselves into pluralistic, market-oriented societies. We meet
when a billion of our fellow human beings continue to live in
abject poverty.''
   This triple challenge occupied the opening session, where
President Bush announced creation of a multi-nation clearing house
to coordinate financial help for countries suffering from the
results of Iraq's takeover of Kuwait.
   The world has experienced unprecedented development in the last
two decades, Conable said, citing what he called ``impressive
advances against poverty,'' including per capita annual consumption
in developing countries, up from $590 dollars to $985, life
expectancy up from 51 to 62 years, and primary education enrollment
up from 73 to 84 percent.
   But one billion people still live on less than $1 a day, he
said.
   Living standards in Latin America have fallen below those of the
1970s, while parts of Sub-Saharan Africa have suffered ``a
veritable collapse of living standards, institutions and
infrastructure,'' he said.
   Bank projects stress the productive growth and efficient use of
labor, he said, while protecting against environmental damage.
   Conable said the number of poor people in developing countries
can be reduced by at least 300 million by the end of the decade,
reducing child mortality and making primary education ``almost
universal.''

<HEAD>Task Force Studies Immigration Penalties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harsher penalties should be levied against
employers who discriminate against foreign-looking workers to avoid
hiring illegal aliens, an administration task force said Tuesday
   The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act ``was not intended
to be a barrier for persons who are eligible to work, but the
evidence shows that many employers are discriminating by adopting
exclusionary hiring practices,'' the task force said in its report
to Congress.
   Those practices include hiring only applicants who prove they
were born on U.S. soil and rejecting legal immigrants who present
work-authorization documents issued by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, the study said.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh endorsed the work of the task
force.
   ``Our nation's continuing commitment to fighting discrimination
in all its guises requires that there be sufficient penalties to
deter discrimination and adequate enforcement of prohibitions
against discrimination,'' Thornburgh said. ``The task force's
recommendations will further these goals.''
   The task force said fines for discriminating against
foreign-looking workers should be commensurate with the penalties
for employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens. That would
increase the maximum fine for repeated discrimination from $2,000
to $10,000, it said.
   The Justice Department's Office of Special Counsel for
Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices should open three
regional offices to investigate complaints and conduct programs to
educate employers about their legal obligations, the report said.
   The special counsel now has one office in Washington.
   The task force also recommended streamlining the procedures for
employers to check documents that applicants present to prove
citizenship or legal status.
   The interagency panel, consisting of representatives of the
Justice Department, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and
the Civil Rights Commission, adopted many of the findings of an
earlier study by the General Accounting Office.
   The 1986 immigration reform law provided amnesty for hundreds of
thousands of illegal aliens living in the country when it was
enacted.

   After weeks of shipping tanks and other tools
of war to the Persian Gulf area, the Pentagon is now looking for a
few lighter items to supply the troops.
   Things like squirt guns, nerf balls, macrame and kite-making
kits.
   The Pentagon on Tuesday invited the public to donate a variety
of recreational items to the troops in the desert and in the
Persian Gulf. It also cautioned that reading materials should not
include pictures of scantily clad women.
   Among other desired items: electronic and board games such as
Nintendo and Trivial Pursuit; music and video tapes as well as Arab
language tapes; comics and editions of USA Today; fitness equipment
such as jump ropes and stair-climbing machines, and sports
equipment such as portable basketball goals, soccer balls, rubber
footballs, volleyball nets and horseshoes.
   Also suggested: writing materials, including Christmas cards,
and personal items such as sun visors, insect repellant and sun
block.
   People planning to send items should check first with a Defense
Logistics Agency hot line at 703-274-3561.

   Politicians, consumer activists and labor
representatives said Tuesday they will lobby Congress to remove the
burden of the savings and loan bailout from average taxpayers.
   ``Today we say that enough is enough,'' Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy
II said at a news conference organized by the Financial Democracy
Campaign.
   ``The Bush (S&amp;L) bailout has already cost working families close
to $150 billion,'' he said. ``Now the administration is telling us
that hundreds of billions more are needed to pay off the depositors
of failed thrifts.''
   The Financial Democracy Campaign is a coalition of consumer,
labor and religious groups.
   Others speaking at the news conference included Boston Mayor
Raymond Flynn; Ed Garvey, a former president of the National
Football League Players Union; Michael Waldman, director of Public
Citizen; and Maude Hurd, president of the Association of Community
Organizations for Reform Now.
   Jesse Jackson and consumer activist Ralph Nader had been
scheduled to appear, but did not attend.
   The news conference was held on the first day of a public
hearing in Denver on conflict-of-interest charges against President
Bush's son Neil, who was a director of a failed Colorado savings
and loan.
   Another group, the September 25th Coalition, demonstrated
Tuesday at the Washington headquarters of the U.S. League of
Savings Institutions, the industry's main lobbying group.
   About 20 people protested what they called ``S&amp;L robbery.'' Some
played cymbals, drums and tambourines as they carried signs that
read: ``Hey, hey we won't pay. Throw them all in jail today.''
   Kennedy, a member of the House Banking Committee, has introduced
legislation that would create a special surtax on affluent
individuals and corporations to pay for the S&amp;L bailout.
   He said the measure would raise $21.2 billion a year; the S&amp;L
bailout will cost taxpayers an estimated $500 billion, or $2,000
per person.
   The measure would create a 7.5 percent surtax on the unearned
income of individuals who earn more than $100,000, excluding the
first $7,500 of such income.
   Unearned income includes interest, dividends and capital gains.
The bill also would impose a 5 percent surtax on the income of
corporations earning more than $75,000 a year.
   ``Working people received nothing from the deregulation of our
nation's thrifts except higher rates on their mortgages and small
business loans,'' Kennedy said. ``The people who went to the
deregulatory party - the wealthiest Americans ... - should be the
ones to pay for it.''

<HEAD>Cease-Fire Maintained Among Warring Liberian Factions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cease-fire among warring factions
held for the fourth day Tuesday, but two rival rebel groups
disagreed on how to form a new government and one of the groups was
building up its troops, officials said.
   The spokesman for a five-nation West African army sent to halt
Liberia's tribal war, Maj. Chris Otulana, said no violations had
been reported in the truce since it began Saturday.
   But Otulana said rebel leader Charles Taylor, who initiated the
cease-fire in the 9-month-old war, had started building up forces
in areas under his control. Taylor has reportedly threatened to
suspend the truce if the West African force sends in more troops.
   Nigerian warships bringing reinforcements and a new field
commander for the force were expected to arrive in Monrovia on
Wednesday or Thursday. Otulana said the additional troops would
help the force set up checkpoints to keep the rebel factions apart.
   He said rebel leader Prince Johnson and Brig. Gen. David Nimley,
commander of remnants of the army loyal to slain President Samuel
Doe, were cooperating with the West African force.
   According to news reports on Monday, Taylor was supposed to meet
with the commander of Doe's mansion guard on Tuesday. It was not
known if the meeting was held.
   Johnson, in a radio telephone call to the British Broadcasting
Corp., rejected Taylor's plan to hold elections on Oct. 10.
   Johnson said Taylor had no right to call elections and that the
proposal was unrealistic because of the collapse of the country's
infrastructure.
   More than half a million Liberians have fled to neighboring
countries, and another million of the 2.3 million population have
been displaced within the country.
   Johnson also said he would accept an invitation by the West
African group to meet Taylor Friday in Freetown, Sierra Leone.
   Taylor opposes a plan proposed by the Economic Community of West
African States for an interim government to run the country until
elections can be held next year. The community, which sent the
five-nation task force, said the temporary government could make
sure none of the warring groups manipulates the voting.
   Taylor, who accused Doe of corruption and nepotism, started the
civil war on Dec. 24 when his forces invaded from Ivory Coast.
Johnson later split with Taylor and formed his own rebel faction.
More than 5,000 civilians have been killed in the fighting.
   Doe was captured earlier this month by Johnson's forces and
tortured to death.
   The capital has been cut off from the outside world for three
months and people are dying of starvation because food supplies are
gone.
   Substantial relief supplies, including 50,000 tons of rice from
the U.S. government, have been waiting in neighboring Ivory Coast
and Sierra Leone for a stable cease-fire.
   ``Once ships can begin to call in the port of Monrovia, which
has been essentially closed to traffic since the end of June ...
these supplies will be brought in,'' a U.S. government official
said.

   A special KGB team foiled an attempt to hijack a
Soviet jetliner on Tuesday by a man who said he had a bomb hidden
in his briefcase, the state news agency Tass reported.
   The man threatened to blow up the plane while at the same time
wishing the crew ``a pleasant flight,'' Tass said.
   It was the latest in a rash of Soviet hijackings and hijack
attempts, most involving diversion of flights to Nordic countries.
   The would-be hijacker, Grigory Polyakov, 53, boarded the flight
from Leningrad to the White Sea port of Arkhangelsk on Monday night
and tried to divert it to Stockholm, Sweden, the report said.
   A note he handed to the flight crew said, according to Tass:
``We propose to you that the plane be directed to Sweden and head
toward Stockholm. If you do not do it, the plane will be blown up.
We will control the course. Do not approach me and do not ask
questions. We wish you a pleasant flight. Let us be mutually polite
and avoid crime in the name of the passengers' health and
welfare.''
   The crew persuaded Polyakov the plane had to land at Arkhangelsk
for fuel. Once on the ground there, authorities negotiated the
release of the 66 passengers, Tass said.
   A trained unit of KGB security police then captured Polyakov,
the report said, but gave no details, including any further
information about whether there actually was a bomb. It said
Polyakov had three previous convictions, including one in 1988 for
``attempting to leave the Soviet Union illegally.''
   Tass said Polyakov earlier was diagnosed as suffering from
chronic paranoia.

   Police groups Tuesday accused House Speaker
Thomas Foley of handing law enforcement a setback by barring
consideration of handgun controls as part of a major anti-crime
package.
   The law enforcement leaders launched their criticism of Foley as
the House first started debate on the anti-crime package and then
shelved it as rebellion broke out among conservatives over its
death penalty provisions.
   Foley spokesman Jeff Biggs, responding to the criticism of the
speaker, said the House could still consider the handgun plan
before Congress adjourns in a few weeks. But he said there was no
guarantee.
   Police groups told a news conference that stringent controls on
semiautomatic assault weapons and handguns are needed if police are
to be effective in fighting crime.
   ``Should we wait until the blood of law enforcement officers an
peaceful citizens is running in the halls of Congress before we
pass sensible gun legislation?'' asked Fraternal Order of Police
leader Dewey Stokes.
   The anti-crime bill calls for the death penalty for 10 offenses
ranging from presidential assassination to treason and espionage.
It is designed to curb delays of a decade or more in carrying out
executions. Under the bill, courts would be able to consider
evidence gathered with flawed warrants if police carried out their
searches ``in good faith.''
   President Bush has been urging approval of an anti-crime package
but said recently that the one before the House would hamper
police. He urged approval of warrantless searches if police acted
in good faith and called for more stringent provisions to prevent
unwarranted delays in death penalty cases.
   Leaders of police organizations criticized a Rules Committee
decision on Monday barring consideration of an amendment that would
require a seven-day waiting period for handgun purchases.
   The seven-day waiting provision has been dubbed the Brady Bill
by its sponsors, in honor of former presidential Press Secretary
Jim Brady, severely wounded by John Hinckley in his attempted
assassination of President Reagan. The aim of the measure is to
give police time to check the backgrounds of would-be handgun
purchasers.
   Police officials blamed Foley for the Rules Committee's decision
to keep the measure separate from the anti-crime package.
   ``Right now, Speaker Foley is not permitting the Brady bill to
come to a vote on the floor of the House, so who else can we
blame?'' Stokes said.
   Biggs noted the House Judiciary Committee had approved the
anti-crime package and the handgun bill as separate measures and
noted that Foley often goes along with the wishes of committee
chairmen. He also said that Foley had not ruled out consideration
of the plan as a separate item.
   ``Can we guarantee it? The answer is no,'' he added. He said the
crime bill itself as well as the budget dispute and major farm
legislation are guaranteed to absorb a large chunk of the House's
time in the weeks ahead.

<TEXT>
   Police imposed a 9 p.m.-to-4
a.m. curfew Tuesday on some black townships wracked by chronic
faction fighting.
   The curfew, announced last week, was included in police measures
designed to halt fighting that has killed about 800 people since
Aug. 12 in townships around Johannesburg.
   Black organizations asked supporters to defy the curfew, but
several areas appeared calm after it started.
   Reporters said streets were empty in parts of Soweto included in
the curfew area. Police checked vehicles at a roadblock. Two
armored police vehicles were seen patrolling.
   ``We are quite prepared for dealing with some resistance,''
police Brig. Gen. Leon Mellett said Tuesday. ``We certainly will
meet some resistance.''
   Much of the fighting has pitted Xhosas and other blacks linked
to the African National Congress against Zulu supporters of the
conservative Inkatha movement.
   The ANC, the largest black opposition group, said the curfew
would leave township residents unprotected while permitting Inkatha
vigilantes and other ``agents of darkness'' to launch attacks.
   It has accused police of aiding Inkatha in the fighting, and
also alleged that right-wing extremists have taken part in attacks.
The government says individual police may have acted improperly,
but the force as a whole has been impartial.
   ``These non-aggressive measures are aimed at protecting
defenseless, law-abiding residents and to ensure they sleep in
peace,'' police Maj. Gen. Herman Stadler said in a statement. He
said the curfew would check ``the movement of criminal elements and
radical thugs.''
   Township fighting has eased following periods in which dozens of
blacks died daily. The fighting spread from eastern Natal Province,
where five years of political and tribal warfare have killed 5,000
blacks.
   Police said Monday the curfew would be enforced in Tokoza,
Vosloorus, Katlehong and several areas of Soweto.
   Violators could get up to six months in jail or a $400 fine.
   Township residents who work at night must provide a letter of
proof to be exempt, police said. Soweto police also would accept
ticket stubs to concerts, movies and soccer matches for exemption.
   Other measures included weapons searches, roadblocks, police and
military reinforcements, and isolating flash points such as worker
hostels and squatter camps.
   Police in Durban, the largest Natal city, said Tuesday they had
seized 785 illegal firearms. They also said they increased the
rewards for people aiding the discovery of some weapons, such as
missiles, rocket launchers and machine guns.

<TEXT>
   Descendants of Indians who were killed or
wounded 100 years ago at Wounded Knee appealed Tuesday for an
apology, reparations and a national monument to atone for their
``blackest day.''
   ``History has to be rewritten to show the Indians' side,''
Claudia Iron Hawk Sully told the Senate Indian Affairs Committee.
``Apologies and memorials have to be made to the victims'
descendants.''
   Sully's grandmother was among the victims of the battle - or
massacre, depending on the view - that marked the end of the Indian
wars Dec. 29, 1890, at Wounded Knee, S.D.
   The remote site on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation was made a
national historic landmark 25 years ago, but the victims'
descendants hope to use the 100th anniversary to win the
compensation and official apology they have long sought.
   The government should ``stand tall, admit it was wrong and atone
for that massacre,'' said Mario Gonzalez, an attorney for the
Wounded Knee Survivors' Association.
   The group wants Congress to declare the site a national
monument, which would make it a part of the National Park Service,
and compensate the survivors for the estimated $20,000 in property
taken from the victims, plus interest.
   The compensation could be made in the form of benefits to Indian
tribes.
   Their chances of getting any of that in the waning days of the
101st Congress are slim.
   The Wounded Knee descendants insisted that event was a massacre
and that many more Indians were killed than was officially
acknowledged.
   ``We hurt and cry deep in our souls as we remember the stories
told to us by our families,'' said Sully. ``Each of us here knows
more about the truth of the blackest day, than any historian or
Indian expert or classroom book will every know.''
   Sully said 426 Lakota Sioux Indians, including warriors, women,
elderly people and children were killed when they were attacked
while in the custody of drunken members of the U.S. 7th Cavalry.
   Her grandmother, then 16, was wounded in the arm and suffered
psychologically for the rest of her life, Sully said.
   The Department of the Interior, however, puts the death toll
lower and gives a differing account of the event that is more
charitable to the troops.
   About 153 Indians were killed of the 400 present and 44 were
wounded, said Knute Knudson, deputy assistant interior secretary.
The firing began when an Indian fired his gun as soldiers were
trying to disarm him, Knudson said.

   Failed savings and loans managed by the
government added $1.02 billion to the cost of the thrift bailout in
the April-June qurter, regulators said Tuesday.
   The Resolution Trust Corp. said operating losses at the 247 S&amp;Ls
in its control at the end of June rose 22 percent from the previous
quarter, when they totaled $840 million at the same institutions.
However, they were down 1 percent from the second quarter of 1989
when they totaled $1.04 billion.
   Operating losses represent the cost of keeping the institutions
open until regulators can sell or close them.
   Analysts said the increase in operating losses underscores the
urgency of handling failed thrifts as soon as possible. However,
the trust corporation will hit a cash crunch after this month
unless congressional and administration negotiators at the budget
summit agree to provide more money.
   Total losses at the government-run thrifts were $2.62 billion in
the second quarter, a deterioration from $2.22 billion in the first
quarter and from $2.45 billion a year ago. Total losses include
recognition of bad loans and other assets that went sour before the
government seized the thrifts.
   The report on government-controlled S&amp;Ls came one day after the
Office of Thrift Supervision disclosed losses for the 2,452
privately-run thrifts.
   Combining the two reports, the entire industry lost $6.3 billion
in the first half of the year, nearly as much as the $7.7 billion
in the first half of 1989 and $7.1 billion in the first half of
1988.
   Nevertheless, trust corporation officials said their analysis of
the most recent data shows that the government cleanup is reducing
losses. At the end of the first quarter 350 S&amp;Ls operated under
government control and lost $3.5 billion.
   ``By eliminating a large number of institutions that were
generating losses, RTC resolution activity has had the effect of
reducing the costs of operating the conservatorship program,'' said
L. William Seidman, chairman of the agency.
   As of Monday 220 institutions were run by the government. The
agency said that if it had managed to reduce its inventory of
failed thrifts to those institutions six months earlier, then
losses in the second quarter would have been $1.94 billion instead
of $2.62 billion.

   Following is the official English-language
version of the air embargo Resolution 670, adopted 14-1 Tuesday by
the U.N. Security Council:
   The Security Council:
   Reaffirming its resolutions 660, 661, 662, 664, 665, 666 and
667, condemning the continued Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, its
failure to rescind its actions and end its purported annexation and
its holding of third State nationals against their will, in
flagrant violation of resolutions 660, 662, 664 and 667 and of
international humanitarian law;
   Condemning further the treatment by Iraqi forces of Kuwaiti
nationals, including measures to force them to leave their own land
and mistreatment by Iraqi forces of persons and property in Kuwait
in violation of international law;
   Noting with grave concern the persistent attempts to evade the
measures laid down in Resolution 661;
   Further noting that a number of states have limited the number
of Iraqi diplomatic and consular officials in their countries and
that others are proposing to do so;
   Determined to ensure by all necessary means the strict and
complete application of the measures laid down in Resolution 661;
   Determined to ensure respect for its decisions and the

   Underlining to the Government of Iraq that its continued failure
to comply with the terms of resolutions 660, 661, 662, 664, 666 and
667 could lead to further action by the Council under the Charter
of the United Nations, including under Chapter VII, with

the present resolution, and for this purpose the aircraft may be
detained for as long as necessary; or
   b. the particular flight has been approved by the Committee
established by Resolution 661; or
   c. the flight is certified by the United Nations as solely for
the purposes of UNIIMOG;
   5. Decides that each State shall take all necessary measures to
ensure that any aircraft registered in its territory or operated by
an operator who has his principal place of business or permanent
residence in its territory complies with the provisions of
Resolution 661 and the present resolution;
   6. Decides further that all States shall notify in a timely
fashion the (sanctions) Committee established by Resolution 661 of
any flight between its territory and Iraq or Kuwait to which the
requirement to land in paragraph 4 above does not apply, and the
purpose for such a flight;
   7. Calls upon all States to cooperate in taking such measures as
may be necessary, consistent with international law, including the
Chicago Convention, to ensure the effective implementation of the

<HEAD>GAO Says Consultants Worked for Government and Developers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consultants assisting the government on the MX
nuclear missile and a fiber-optic guided missile also worked for
defense contractors on the same weapons, congressional
investigators said Tuesday.
   The General Accounting Office said it found no basis to conclude
that any of the three cases they examined resulted in a conflict of
interest, but one lawmaker expressed reservations.
   ``Taken separately, each of the GAO findings in this report is
cause for concern,'' said Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark. ``Taken
together, they paint a very grim picture indeed of the system by
which the Pentagon procures hardware for the national defense.''
   The watchdog agency of Congress found that consultants were
trusted to certify that they had no associations that represented a
conflict of interest.
   Pryor said such a system would not work ``because dishonest
consultants will not volunteer their guilt.''
   The Defense Department estimates it spends about $1.6 billion a
year on defense consulting.
   The GAO said the department did not accurately identify or
report its use of consulting services because of problems
interpreting the definitions of these services or other internal
control weaknesses.
   ``Without improvement in these areas, the Defense Department and
the Congress will continue to lack accurate information on how much
the Defense Department is relying on consulting services to develop
its weapon systems,'' the GAO said.
   In addition to examining the consulting work on the missiles,
the GAO also found that Bell Helicopter Textron hired a former Navy
admiral to confer with U.S. government officials on the V-22
Osprey, a tilt-rotor aircraft.
   The Defense Department, in comments included in the GAO report,
said it agreed with the findings and recommendations and was taking
steps to strengthen its management and reporting system.
   Pryor and Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee, requested the report.

<TEXT>
   Smoking two packs of cigarettes a day for
35 years killed a man who sued a cigarette maker, but he shares
responsibility for his death and his family doesn't deserve money
as compensation, a jury decided.
   The family of Nathan Henry Horton, who died of lung cancer in
1987 at age 50, sought $17 million in the suit against the maker
and a regional distributor of Pall Mall cigarettes.
   Jurors, half of whom smoke, agreed 9-3 Monday that American
Tobacco Co. and Greenwood distributor New Deal Tobacco and Candy
Co. were partly to blame for Horton's death. Horton's decision to
continue smoking despite the risk kept them from awarding the
family a penny.
   ``It is possible we could have let down both sides, but the
alternatives were this or a hung jury,'' jury foreman David Roach
of Oxford said in a telephone interview.
   ``This was the only agreement we could come up with. Whether or
not that is better than a hung jury is for other people to
decide,'' he said.
   The suit sought $2 million in actual damages and $15 million in
punitive damages. The trial, the second in the case, was moved to
Lafayette County from Holmes County. The first ended in January
1988 when the jury deadlocked.
   Attorney Don Barrett, who represents Horton's relatives, said he
has filed motions asking Holmes County Circuit Court Judge Eugene
Bogen to award oome money for actual damages. He also asked for a
new trial on the issue of punitive damages.
   ``They set out to see justice done, and they are determined to
see it through,'' Barrett said by telephone.
   Horton, a Durant homebuilder, began the suit and his family
pursued it after his death. His widow, Ella Mae Horton, declined to
comment on the case Tuesday.
   Roger Baker, director of communications for Connecticut-based
American Brands Inc., of which American Tobacco Co. is a
subsidiary, said Tuesday that the company planned further motions
in the case, but refused to say what they were.
   Baker said since the matter is pending in court, the company
wouldn't comment further.
   In a similar case, a New Jersey jury awarded a widower $400,000
in 1988 after deciding a cigarette company was partly responsible
for his wife's lung cancer death. An appeals court this year
overturned the award and ordered a new trial.
   Defense lawyers argued during the latest trial that Horton knew
the risks of smoking, but chose to continue. Barrett claimed Pall
Mall cigarettes are defective and dangerous.
   ``We decided both parties were at fault,'' Roach said Monday,
adding that he and eight other jurors ``thought the American
Tobacco Co. acted in an irresponsible way. It was a very close
decision. We were fairly near a hung jury, frankly.''
   Mary Aronson, a Washington analyst who was at the three-week
trial on behalf of tobacco investment clients, said Monday: ``As
long as damages are not awarded, I believe Wall Street will view
this as a win for the industry. This was considered the best case
(against tobacco companies), yet no award was made.''
   Barrett said that the jury verdict should have led to a damage
award.
   ``We proved overwhelmingly that he suffered horrible damages,
but the jury punted on that,'' Barrett said.

<TEXT>
   The government, which
already has more than doubled gasoline prices in the last seven
weeks, on Tuesday began rationing gas because of shortages brought
on by the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Drivers will be allowed to buy gasoline every other day,
depending on whether their license plates end in even or odd
numbers. Gas station hours were curtailed. Gas will be sold from 6
a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and only until noon Sundays
and holidays.
   Since Aug. 7, the price of gas here has soared from 55 cents a
gallon to $1.42, with long lines at stations.
   The government has cut back fuel imports by 30 to 40 percent
since crude oil prices began their climb after Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait. This Caribbean country, with a population
exceeding 6.7 million, has no oil production of its own.
   The government effectively controls oil imports, refining and
pricing through the Dominican Petroleum Refinery, which is 51
percent state-owned and 49 percent owned by Shell Oil. Gas stations
are privately owned.
   Chaotic scenes occurred at some gas stations Tuesday as the plan
went into effect before many drivers knew about it. Soldiers were
posted at several stations, but there was no violence.
   The Dominican Republican has been operating under an austerity
program - recommended by the International Monetary Fund - which
has brought steep increases in the price of basic consumer goods.

<HEAD>Government Announces Plan to Tackle Pollution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUE LEEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Tuesday issued a policy paper on
tackling pollution, improving the environment and changing
Britain's image as ``dirty man of Europe.''
   Environment Secretary Chris Patten called the 300-page policy
document ``the first really comprehensive statement of government
policy on the environment, ranging from the street corner to the
stratosphere.''
   But environmental agencies said the plan, entitled ``This Common
Inheritance,'' contains few new initiatives and is simply a listof
good intentions.
   ``It is a woolly wish-list of what the government might like to
see happening towards the end of the century, without making any
commitment to action now,'' said a statement from Greenpeace.
``Britain remains the dirty man of Europe.''
   The European Commission has attacked Britain for its plan to
continue dumping more than 200,000 tons of industrial waste in the
North Sea annually until 1992, despite an agreement among European
nations that was to have stopped industrial dumping by last
January.
   Britain also is one of eight European nations dumping mercury,
lead, cadmium and dioxins into the North Sea.
   Patten said several of the major efforts listed in the document
are already under way. These include a $52.6 billion program to
improve water quality and a $11.28 billion industry initiative to
fight acid rain.
   The government's Environmental Protection Bill, introduced in
December and to be debated by Parliament later this year, includes
measures such as fines for unlicensed waste dumping at sea, new
restraints on radioactive substances and tougher standards of waste
disposal.
   Patten said the government also would work toward increasing
regenerating capacity from renewable resources such as wind and sea
power to 1,000 megawatts by the year 2000, a tenfold increase on
current capacity.
   He also promised efforts against carbon dioxide release.
   The Greenpeace statement said the government had failed to act
on radioactive pollution, marine and river pollution, toxic waste
imports, global warming, energy policy, transport policy, acid rain
and ozone layer protection.
   Britain is a ``radioactive dustbin,'' it said, importing
thousands of tons of nuclear waste from all over the world.
   Toxic waste from Europe, especially Italy and Germany, is being
processed at British plants.
   A spokesman for Friends of the Earth, who spoke on condition he
not be named, said the document was ``a program for discussion
rather than a program for action. We are disappointed.''

   As crude oil approaches $40 per barrel, some
analysts say consumers should enjoy $1.35 a gallon gasoline while
they can.
   Gas prices are likely to go up, perhaps even beyond $2 per
gallon, if a shooting war breaks out in the Persian Gulf, experts
said Tuesday. And if oil should stay high for a sustained period,
the fallout will be widespread, running up the cost of practically
everything while slowing economic growth.
   ``This is not good news for the consumer,'' said Peter Beutel,
an oil analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc. in Hoboken, N.J.
``The problem with energy is it permeates the economy like a ripple
in a pond. It's not just the price of heating oil and the price of
gasoline.''
   Not all analysts believe oil will stay as high as it is. They
say that too much war hysteria may have been built into the market,
that Iraq's ability to take out Saudi Arabian oil facilities may be
overestimated, and that replacing a bombed oil well is much simpler
than replacing a bombed factory.
   Others, including Beutel, say $40 barrels of oil seem inevitable
in the near future. Some estimates have put oil at $60 to $65
during a war.
   On Tuesday, oil prices dipped as traders took profits from a
surge a day earlier and awaited developments in the Persian Gulf.
   The benchmark grade light sweet crude fell 72 cents to $37.53
per barrel for November contracts on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Some analysts suggested prices would resume their climb
Wednesday because of the U.N. Security Council vote - taken after
markets closed - to extend the embargo on Iraq and Kuwait by
authorizing an air blockade.
   Oil prices have climbed steadily since Iraq invaded Kuwait last
month. Saddam Hussein's saber-rattling this week put them less than
$1 away from the ominous $40 figure. Crude last reached that
plateau a decade ago, in the last oil crisis.
   ``What it means, I'm afraid, in solid terms, is the consumer is
probably going to be lucky to find $1.35 gasoline, and probably a
lot more of us are going to find $1.60 to $1.85 gasoline,'' Beutel
said. ``We're probably going to see the average consumer pay 50
percent more for heating oil than he did last year.''
   Stanley Feldman, a finance professor at Bentley College in
Boston, does not predict sustained oil prices at $40. But consumers
would be hit hard if it happens.
   ``At $40-a-barrel oil, you're probably looking at somewhere
close to $1.90 for regular gasoline, maybe $2,'' Feldman said.
   Oil at $60 could push gasoline over $2 at the pump, the experts
said.
   Gasoline and heating oil are commonly watched when crude starts
getting more expensive. But America is so dependent on oil that the
price of many other items would also be affected.
   Air fares, for instance, have increased to accommodate higher
jet fuel, while drugs and foods would also be affected. They depend
on oil for their production, transportation and refrigeration.
   ``Oil is the basis of plastics, and we still have a lot of
oil-fired electrical generating plants,'' said David Farnsworth, a
political science professor at Wichita State University. ``There
are many ways that it's used. It has its impact on asphalt in the
highways and how much street repair you can do.''
   Feldman estimates $40 oil could push up consumer prices from 5
percent to 8 percent once all the economic ripples set in.
   ``That assumes the oil price stays at $40 for a sustained period
of time, namely a year,'' he said.
   Buetel said each $10 increase in oil adds about 1 percent to the
inflation rate.
   In addition, oil at $40 per barrel could cut about 1 percent out
of the nation's economic growth, said Feldman, who termed such a
scenario ``significant when the economy's already in the midst of a
recession.''
   Farnsworth puts gasoline at only about $1.50 per gallon if oil
stays around $40. He thinks much of the increase consumers have
already felt was based on panic.
   But higher oil could have broader implications, Farnsworth said,
because oil prices are set in dollars, and the dollar has been
weaker in Europe. If high oil prices persist until 1992, when
European nations hope to integrate their economies, the United
States could find itself at a disadvantage in trade talks, he said.

   Saudi Arabia expelled 12 more diplomatic
staff from Jordan's consulate and embassy Tuesday, and Jordan
recalled its ambassador in protest, the Foreign Ministry said.
   The Saudi government's order left a skeleton staff of four
employees each in the Jordanian embassy in Riyadh and its consulate
in Jiddah, according to the announcement read on state Jordan
Radio.
   No comment was available immediately from Saudi authorities.
   Naser Batayneh, Jordan's ambassador to Saudi Arabia, was
recalled to protest the ``inexcusable'' Saudi action, the Jordanian
announcement said.
   Last week, Saudi Arabia expelled 20 Jordanian embassy and
consulate employees for activities ``incompatible with their
status'' - a diplomatic euphemism for espionage.
   Saudi officials said the diplomats were spying on military
installations in collaboration with Iraq. The Saudis expelled 46 of
the 50 Yemenis at the embassy in Saudi Arabia for the same reason.
   Jordanian Foreign Minister Marwan Kassem denied the spying
report, but several Jordanian officials, including a Cabinet
minister, privately confirmed it.
   The expulsions showed Saudi irritation with Jordan's pro-Iraqi
stance following the invasion and annexation of Kuwait last month.
The Saudi government also was unhappy about a conference of radical
Palestinians in Amman last week at which calls were heard for
suicide attacks against the U.S. military buildup in Saudi Arabia.
   Saudi Arabia last week cut off oil supplies to Jordan, claiming
$46 million in unpaid bills. Saudi grants to Jordan also were
likely to be cut, officials said.

``Maybe it's the spontaneity of it.''
   In what is believed to be first student testing via touch-tone
telephone, students at suburban Governors State University called
in the answers to their Psychology 519 quiz over the weekend.
   They answered by punching in numbers that were registered with
computerized voice-mail equipment.
   ``Seeing things in print in front of you gives you more time to
go back and change the answers,'' said Pajak, 35, who returned to
school seeing a master's degree. ``With this you really have to
concentrate.''
   Pajak and classmates took a 10-question multiple choice quiz,
punching the numbers 1 through 4 on the phone to register their
answers with a school computer.
   Students taking Management 421 will try the program this week,
taking an exam of 15 true-false questions by pressing 1 for true or
2 for false.
   ``It's a replacement for the old-fashioned No. 2 lead pencil,''
said Donald Fricker, a professor of management information systems
who developed the idea.
   Fricker said Telequiz saves time and money.
   ``I can administer any quiz in just two or three days as opposed
to where the secretary has to type it, I have to copy it, the class
has to meet, and I still have to grade it,'' he said.
   The system also eliminates the need to travel to the college in
suburban University Park. The 5,000-student school has no
dormitories and many students have outside job and family
responsibilities.
   The system lets instructors record up to 30 questions. It can
handle just one student at a time.
   Quiz takers have six or seven seconds to think of an answer
before the next question is asked - too short a time for a student
to cheat by looking up the answer in a book, Fricker said.
   Telequiz will be demonstrated in November to representatives of
600 schools at the annual Computers on Campus conference in Myrtle
Beach, S.C.
   Teresa Barker took the test Sunday night, sitting at the kitchen
table after she had cleared the dinner dishes.
   ``Being at home, it was different than being somewhere where
there's a lot of pressure,'' said Barker, 52, a child-welfare
worker pursuing an undergraduate degree.
   Some students called as early as 8 a.m. Saturday and Sunday. The
last student to call Saturday phoned in at at 10:38 p.m.
   The system ``gives a student tremendous flexibility,'' Fricker
said. ``The student can be at his most relaxed. He can call in at 4
a.m. if that's when he's achieved nirvana and feels he knows the
material.''

   Temperatures tumbled to record lows across the Southeast for a
second day Tuesday, but record highs in the 80s and 90s were posted
across the Plains as far north as North Dakota.
   At 2 p.m. EDT, North Dakota was warmer than Alabama, and
Minnesota temperatures were about the same as those across Georgia.
   The low of 42 at Montgomery, Ala., toppled a record of 45 that
had been on the books since 1887.
   Other record lows were 53 at Apalachicola, Fla.; 44 at Athens,
Ga.; 42 at Augusta, Ga.; 50 at Beaufort, S.C.; 47 at Cape Hatteras,
N.C.; 42 at Greenville, S.C.; 44 at Huntsville, Ala.; 51 at

and 65 at Tampa, Fla.
   Records were tied at 36, at Asheville, N.C.; 46 at Auburn, Ala.;
43 at Birmingham, Ala.; 51 at Charleston, S.C.; 43 at Columbia,
S.C.; 45 at Meridian, Miss.; 56 at New Orleans; 50 at Savannah, Ga.
   Tuesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 31 at Lewisburg, W.Va.
   But while the South chilled, afternoon temperatures climbed into
the 70s and 80s over the Mississippi Valley and Plains.
   A record high was set at 91 at Norfolk, Neb., and tied at 93 at
Concordia, Kan.; 88 at Sheridan, Wyo., and 86 at Williston, N.D.
   Most of the nation was dry Tuesday.
   Afternoon showers and occasional thunderstorms reached from
southwestern Oregon across northern California, from central
Louisiana into west-central Mississippi, along the southwestern and
east-central coasts of Florida, over western New York state and
over east-central Lower Michigan.
   There were no reports of significant rainfall during the six
hours up to 2 p.m. EDT.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 53 at
Truckee, Calif., to 95 at Palm Springs, Calif.

   Democrats on the House Appropriations
Committee shouted down President Bush's veto threat Tuesday and
voted to delay for 20 days deep spending cuts that will be
triggered unless Congress and the White House agree on a
deficit-reduction plan.
   If the $85 billion in arbitrary spending reductions are allowed
to take effect as scheduled Oct. 1, Chairman Jamie Whitten,
D-Miss., told the committee, ``it threatens to bring the economy to
its knees. We can't afford the risk.''
   ``A full-blown crisis'' may be required to force negotiators
into solving the deficit, said Rep. Silvio Conte of Massachusetts,
the senior Republican on the committee.
   At the White House, an angry Bush told reporters: ``If there is
no budget agreement with real spending reductions and real process
reform by the end of the week, I will have to veto it. I do not
want to see further delay in kicking this problem on down the
road.''
   The House is likely to consider the bill later this week.
   No deficit agreement was in sight, although top leaders of
Congress and the administration claimed some progress. The goal is
a combination of targeted spending reductions and tax increases
that would cut the deficit by $50 billion during the 12 months
beginning Monday and an additional $450 billion in the following
four years.
   House Republican Leader Bob Michel of Illinois told reporters he
is ready to drop Bush's coveted capital-gains tax cut, which has
been the thorniest issue in the negotiations. ``In my opinion the
doggone price is too steep,'' he said.
   Michel said the administration is considering other options for
stimulating the economy - options that might be more acceptable to
Democratic leaders, who consider a capital-gains cut nothing but a
windfall for the rich. Democrats are insisting that any
capital-gains reduction be offset by raising other taxes on the
wealthy.
   The stopgap spending legislation approved by the House panel is
necessary because none of the 13 annual appropriation bills has
been enacted - and a new budget year begins in less than a week.
For the first time in several years, federal workers are taking the
threat of furloughs seriously.
   ``People are literally losing sleep over this,'' said Tom
Doherty, an Occupational Safety and Health Administration inspector
from Allentown, Pa. ``They have kids to feed and house payments to
make, and now they're having the rug swept out from under them by
the system they work for,''
   With the Monday deadline in mind, the House panel agreed by a
nearly party-line 32-20 vote to continue spending basically at
present levels through Oct. 20 and to block any threatened
across-the-board spending cuts - including those that could bring
mass furloughs of federal workers - before that date.
   In an effort to discourage a veto, the Democratic-controlled
committee attached to the measure $2 billion of money to support
the large-scale deployment of U.S. military forces in the Persian
Gulf.
   ``This won't protect it,'' said Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla.
``The president does intend to veto it.''
   ``His (Bush's) political advisers are not crazy enough to tell
him to veto this,'' said Rep. Neal Smith, D-Iowa.
   Whitten said he had talked to Bush earlier in the day and ``he
didn't tell me he was going to veto it.''
   For anyone ``to let the whole country go to pot - it's a
question of whether he's patriotic or his judgment has gone sour,''
Whitten said.
   Despite the looming financial breakdown in the government, the
committee spent more of its session talking of the other major
crisis: the Persian Gulf. The panel:
   -Voted to double to 12 months the maximum time for which
military reservists may be activated for Operation Desert Shield.
   -Approved an extra $20 million to provide ``imminent danger''
pay to troops in the gulf.
   -Sidestepped Bush's request to forgive $6.7 billion in Egyptian
debt in appreciation of that nation's contributions to protecting
Saudi Arabia from Iraqi attack. Both sides agreed that domestic
political pressures - the unpopularity of foreign aid - would have
defeated the proposition if it had been brought to a vote.
   Instead, the committee agreed by voice vote to waive a law that
would have barred Egypt from further U.S. aid because of failure to
repay past debts.
   -Made clear that other countries' contributions to the costs of
Operation Desert Shield must be channeled through the regular
congressional appropriations process. The administration had
proposed to let the Pentagon handle such funds without intervention
by Congress.
   The committee stripped from the bill a section aimed at
prohibiting the National Endowment for the Arts from supporting
``any indecent, anti-religious or obscene picture, play or
writing.''
   The panel's explanation of the stopgap spending resolution
mentions what could happen if the spending cuts - called a
sequester - mandated by the Gramm-Rudman law are allowed to take
effect. ``The effect ... would be disastrous not only to the
nation's economy, but ... would have a dangerous impact on a weak
economy,'' the report states.
   Among the possibilities: ``the air traffic control system would
turn into chaos''; a major influx of illegal aliens; a shortage of
money to pay jurors; compromised safety for nuclear facilities; 1
million children would miss shots; Social Security checks for new
applicants could be threatened; Internal Revenue Service
enforcement could suffer by $8 billion; the Space Shuttle would be
grounded until 1993, and farm loans would be slashed.
   Top representatives of Congress and the administration began
negotiating a deficit reduction more than four months ago. By most
accounts, the major obstacle has been Bush's insistence that the
tax on capital gains be reduced to increase incentives for
investment.
   Democrats have resisted cutting that tax, which applies to
profits on the sale of investments, because 80 percent of the
direct benefits would go to those with incomes of $100,000 a year
or more. They have insisted any such cut be accompanied by a tax
increase of some other kind on upper-income people, but the two
parties have been unable to agree on the type of tax increase.

<HEAD>William Hurt Stars in Chekhov's `Ivanov' at Yale Rep</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oleg Yefremov's adaptation at the Yale
Repertory Theater of ``Ivanov,'' starring William Hurt in the title
role, begins and ends with a gunshot.
   But what happens in between is what really counts in this dark,
moody and unrealized production of one of Anton Chekhov's early and
lesser-known plays.
   ``Ivanov'' has attracted attention not only because of Hurt, one
of the few film stars willingly to put himself on stage with any
degree of regularity, but also because of Yefremov, artistic
director of the Moscow Art Theater.
   The revival certainly looks authentic. The design by David
Borovsky, head artist of the Moscow Taganka Theater, is a marvel of
the power of suggestion. The decrepit facade of a country mansion,
its columns covered with gnarled, leafless vines, fills the wide
playing area at the University Theater.
   With a few chairs strategically placed on stage in front of this
haunted house the director conjures up the deadening bourgeois
activity of two different families in vastly different financial
situations.
   Yefremov is not afraid to tamper with the text. For example, he
reshuffles scenes, opening the play with a second-act party that
has the guests commenting on Ivanov's tribulations before the
audience has seen him.
   And the title character has enough troubles for several dramas.
Ivanov is a man in despair. ``I don't believe anymore,'' he says.
He doesn't believe in his marriage to Sarah, his rich Jewish wife
whose parents cut off love and money to her after she married. And
he spends more time worrying about his debts than trying to earn
money to pay them off.
   But an articulation of his anxiety is hard to find in Hurt's
muffled portrait of Ivanov. The blond, bearded Hurt can be a
galvanizing actor on stage, as audiences who saw his jumpstart
performance off and on Broadway in David Rabe's ``Hurlyburly''
know.
   Here his acting is muted, his voice rarely rising above a drone.
Whatever magic Yefremov has worked on the play's atmosphere has not
filtered down to his star.
   Other members of the large, underrehearsed cast seem to be left
to their own resources, losing both the comedy and the tragedy of
the piece. Some fare better than others. Frances Conroy, as the
dying Sarah conveys the evening's only real sense of sadness.
Zeljko Ivanek has mastered the outrage of a young doctor amazed at
Ivanov's treatment of his critically ill wife. And Lee Richardson
has the right amount of charm as Ivanov's reprobate uncle.
   But Austin Pendleton and Susan Kellermann flounder as Ivanov's
prosperous neighbors and Leo Burmester is more All-American
farmhand than savvy country bumpkin.
   The result is an incomplete production, tantalizing for the
atmosphere Yefremov is able to coax from a production team that
also includes costume designer Jess Goldstein and lighting designer
Geoff Korf.
   This ``Ivanov,'' which runs in New Haven through Oct. 13, is an
inviting shell of a play, but not a world inhabited by real people.

<HEAD>Another Congressional Fight Over Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supported by a lobbying blitz by the President
of El Salvador, the Bush administration has revived efforts to head
off deep cuts in next year's military aid to the Central American
country.
   Administration officials said Tuesday they were preparing to
fight the issue when the 1991 foreign aid bill comes to the Senate
floor in the next few weeks, and were lining up support for a cut
that would be less than the 50 percent slash already called for by
the House.
   Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani, in Washington for four
days of meetings with administration and congressional officials,
continued his sales pitches Tuesday in separate meetings with
lawmakers and reporters.
   Cristiani promised to speed the investigation into the murders
last November of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her
daughter, and proposed to bring three American judges to his
country to study how the case is being handled.
   ``The case is testing the administratio of justice in El
Salvador,'' Cristiani told reporters at a luncheon. It also has
been the primary impetus behind congressional efforts to cut the
country's $85 million in military aid.
   Cristiani also said he would accept a 50 percent cut in military
aid, but only if Congress made it contingent upon agreement of both
sides in the decade-old conflict to a cease-fire.
   Rep. Joseph Moakley, D-Mass., who heads a House Democratic task
force on El Salvador that has been critical of the Salvadoran
government, said he was not persuaded by the president's proposals.
   Reform of the Salvadoran military must come before an effective
cease-fire can be reached, Moakley said. That is the issue which
has stymied United Nations-sponsored peace talks between the two
warring sides.
   But Moakley, who last month accused the military of a coverup in
the case, said he was encouraged that senior military officers were
now agreeing to testify personally before the investigating judge.
   Eight officers have been arrested in the case, but none has been
brought to trial. Moakley's task force found that some key evidence
has been destroyed and that testimony has been withheld.
   The State Department apparently is pinning its hopes for
continued military aid on the Senate.
   Administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said they would seek to draft a milder version of the aid cut that
could be offered as an alternative to the 50 percent cut being
pushed by Sens. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.
   The State Department has largely ignored the issue for the last
two months, but has taken a renewed interest as the end of the
fiscal year on Sunday forces action on appropriations bills.
   Cristiani said he still hoped that the military aid could be
rescued, but added that if it were cut it would not jeopardize his
government. ``It would be creating more economic problems for the
country,'' he said. But he added: ``We do not feel the government
is going to topple because of this.''

   Israeli leaders on both left and right raged
Tuesday against a rare common enemy: a scheme that allows
middle-aged ultra-Orthodox Jews to get veteran's benefits without
ever serving in the army.
   Public disclosure of the arrangement renewed the simmering
resentment many non-observant Israeli citizens feel for
ultra-Orthodox Jews and their demands to change Israeli society to
fit their religious beliefs.
   Shulamit Aloni, head of the left-wing Citizens' Rights Movement,
suggested the doling out of military benefits to men who never
serve was a way to reward ultra-Orthodox political parties.
   ``This is part of an agreement to take advantage of the defense
minister's authority to give money to this public who eats but
never pays,'' Aloni said.
   Parliament member Ran Cohen, who uncovered the scheme, said the
ultra-Orthodox were insulting the average Israeli man who is
drafted into the army for three years and serves in the reserves
until age 54.
   ``They play act as if they want to go into the army, but they
don't want to contribute to the army. They want the money,'' Cohen
said.
   He said hundreds and perhaps thousands of religious Jews 35 to
50 years old were receiving benefits without ever serving in the
army.
   As Cohen explained the arrangement, ultra-Orthodox Jews enlist
in the army after getting exemptions for the draft for years of
study of the Torah.
   Typically, the men are in their late 30s or 40s when they
enlist, and they are never called up to actually serve because of
their age and because they often are fathers of large families,
Cohen said.
   But, he added, they are still eligible for higher benefits as
``veterans.'' The benefits are especially important to big Orthodox
families because every Israeli with three or more children gets a
government stipend.
   For example, an Israeli family of seven receives $213 monthly,
but the same size family headed by a veteran is eligible for $408.
The difference rises with the number of children.
   Israel television said a senior military forum headed by Chief
of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron debated the issue Tuesday.
   The military command also issued a statement insisting it was
not responsible for the government stipends, which are handled by
the Labor and Social Affairs Ministry. It said religious Jews
drafted into the army ``serve in active reserve duty in accordance
with the needs.''
   The army said it saw as its duty to draft religious men who have
completed their studies at religious seminaries. Their number the
last five years has totalled 4,000, it said.
   Of these, 24 percent were found unfit for service, more than 50
percent were drafted into regular and 24 percent into reserve
units, the military said.
   ``It should be stressed that there was no major increase in the
last year in the number of seminary students drafted into the army,
and those mobilized cannot know beforehand what they would do
during reserve service,'' the statement said.
   Lawmaker Uriel Lin of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's ruling
right-wing Likud bloc reacted to Cohen's charges by calling for an
army investigation. ``The law cannot be made into a joke and the
people of Israel cannot be turned into a joke,'' he said.
   Cohen's complaints, printed on front pages of Israeli newspapers
Tuesday, also brought angry phone calls to radio talks shows.
   Israelis, most of whom are non-observant Jews, regularly
complain about military exemptions for the ultra-Orthodox.

<HEAD>End of the Road Seen For San Francisco's `Berlin Wall'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES O. CLIFFORD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It looks like the end of the road for the
earthquake-damaged Embarcadero Freeway, a double-decker span
likened to the Berlin Wall for the way it separates San Francisco's
downtown and waterfront.
   The Board of Supervisors voted Monday to tear down the mile-long
stretch of the road that's been closed since the 7.1-magnitude
quake did widespread damage in October 1989. The freeway's concrete
support columns were damaged.
   ``The Embarcadero Freeway has been San Francisco's environmental
Berlin Wall,'' Supervisor Bill Maher said. ``It has been a blight
on our city and our waterfront ever since it was built.''
   At the time of the quake, the Embarcadero carried 60,000 cars a
day along the waterfront to Chinatown, the North Beach restaurant
district and Fisherman's Wharf, the city's prime tourist
attraction.
   Chinatown merchants oppose its destruction because the highway
made it easy for tourists and other customers to get there.
   Technically, the board's 6-5 vote was strictly advisory, but
federal and state officials have made it clear they will go along
with the city's decision.
   No formal demolition request has been filed by the city. Mayor
Art Agnos said he is waiting while he tries to secure funds for an
underground replacement highway.
   The California Department of Transportation has said it would
cost $54.6 million to repair the freeway. Agnos believes he can get
more federal quake-related emergency transportation relief funds
after completion of new soil studies, which could raise the
estimate.
   ``I intend to make sure that we get every single dollar that
we're eligible for,'' Agnos said.
   Agnos declined to put a timetable on its demolition, but he said
the board's vote goes a long way toward helping him get the $135
million he needs to replace the freeway.
   State transportation spokesman Breg Bayol said Tuesday that
tearing down the 30-year-old freeway would take at least six
months.
   ``There's more to it than just tearing it down,'' Bayol said.
``There's the engineering and traffic control studies to do before
we put it out to bid. Some portions could be troublesome because
they're so close to buildings.''
   Chinatown merchants led the battle against demolishing the
structure, pushing for a quick reopening to get traffic flowing
into their area again.
   They even closed their shops for one day in April and converged
on City Hall to protest the mayor's plan.
   ``There's still some opposition, but most of it's political,''
said Rose Pak, spokeswoman for the Chinatown Chamber of Commerce.
``The real turning point came when we realized the cost and time to
repair the Embarcadero. This way, the mayor's plan didn't look so
bad.''
   The freeway was controversial even before it was built in 1959.
Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic Allan Temko has called
the Embarcadero ``one of the chief horrors of the 1950s, when
technocrats started ramming freeways through cities.''
   He said tearing down the freeway will give San Francisco a
chance to once again be the ``ideal of a civilized American
metropolis, as it was before the freeway transformed one of the
loveliest waterfronts in the world into one of the most obscene.''

<HEAD>No Home for Bust of Former Soviet Leader Chernenko</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk want
a bust of former Soviet leader Konstantin U. Chernenko removed from
a city square, but they can find no takers, a newspaper reported
Tuesday.
   The likeness of the predecessor to Mikhail S. Gorbachev was
erected in the city about 1,950 miles east of Moscow after
Chernenko was awarded his third ``Hero of Socialist Labor'' title,
the Trud newspaper reported.
   But the Krasnoyarsk City Council decided to dismantle the bronze
bust, saying ``established procedure'' calls for such monuments to
be erected in the recipient's birthplace, Trud said.
   That would be quite impossible in Chernenko's case, Trud noted,
since the village of Bolshaya Tes, where he was born, is now
underwater because of a dam built for the Krasnoyarsk hydroelectric
power plant.
   The residents of Sharypovo, a town 130 miles west of
Krasnoyarsk, don't want the bust either, Trud said. Until recently,
Sharypovo was named for Chernenko, but it has since been given its
old name back.
   Krasnoyarsk's City Council decided to put the bust in a cultural
museum, but can't move it there until Kremlin authorities rescind
the decision that placed it in the square in the first place.
   Chernenko, a crony of the late Leonid I. Brezhnev, led the
Soviet Union from Feb. 13, 1984, until he died on March 10, 1985.
Under Gorbachev, memorials to Brezhnev and his proteges have been
removed and their leadership has been denounced.

<TEXT>
   Nine people were executed in the south Chinese
city of Canton and four others were sentenced to life for robbing
passengers on long-distance buses, an official newspaper reported.
   The executions were the latest of a yearlong anti-crime campaign
that Amnesty International says has seen at least 500 people
executed.
   Two county courts on Monday sentenced the 13-member gang for 37
robberies in a 10-month period, the Canton-based Yangcheng Daily
reported.
   The highway bandits robbed 98 passengers of $36,544. Thirteen
people were stabbed during the robberies, said the paper, seen
Tuesday in Beijing.
   Ringleader Gao Shiming was responsible for 26 robberies, during
which he injured three people, the paper said.
   Gao, Lin Jinquan, Lin Guanghong, Fan Tiansheng and five others
were sentenced to death and executed. Four other gang members were
given life sentences, the paper said.
   Executions in China are usually carried out with a bullet to the
head.
   Monday's executions came less than a week after 65 people were

<HEAD>Appeals Court Rejects Keating's Bid to Cut $5 Million Bail</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An appeals court refused Tuesday to reduce
the $5 million bail for Charles H. Keating, the savings and loan
executive accused of fraud in selling American Continental Corp.
junk bonds.
   The 2nd District Court of Appeal said in a one-paragraph ruling
that it considered an appeal filed Monday by Keating's lawyers and
had examined transcripts of bail proceedings before Superior Court
Judge Gary Klausner.
   ``The petition is denied,'' the three-judge panel wrote.
   The court apparently rejected arguments by Keating that he is
being made a scapegoat in a criminal fraud case involving sales of
the now-worthless bonds through branches of Irvine, Calif.-based
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. Lincoln, an American Continental
subsidiary, has been seized by federal regulators.
   District Attorney Ira Reiner said he was pleased the court had
upheld $5 million bail, but said he expected further efforts by the
Keating defense to win reduction of the bail by a higher court.
   Reiner acknowledged that $5 million is a high price for freedom.
   ``It is an exceptionally high bail and Mr. Keating is an
exceptional defendant,'' Reiner said. ``The principal factor
involved is risk of flight. You can't consider Mr. Keating without
thinking of Robert Vesco.''
   Vesco, a fugitive financier, fled the United States while being
investigated by authorities.
   Keating, who has been held at the downtown Men's Central Jail
for a week, contends he can't adequately defend himself if he
remains in custody.
   Stephen C. Neal, Keating's main attorney, said Monday night that
he would pursue every avenue to get Keating out of jail. The next
appeal would be to the California Supreme Court, and after that, to
a federal court.
   Keating and three co-defendants surrendered to face a 42-count
state grand jury indictment on Sept. 18. Klausner set Keating's
bail at $5 million and held the other defendants on $1 million
bail.
   After a hearing last week, the judge reduced the co-defendants'
bail to $100,000 or $200,000. Klausner refused to lower Keating's
bail, saying the possibility of 10 years in prison made him a
flight risk.
   Keating's attorneys argued that he had not fled any of the
numerous legal problems that have arisen since federal regulators
seized Lincoln and American Continental went to bankruptcy court.
   They also said he is about $5 million in debt and, with the help
of his children, could only post bail of $500,000.
   The co-defendants, officers of American Continental or Lincoln,
posted bail last week and are free.
   All four are due back in court Oct. 5 to enter a plea to the
charges of misleading investors about the safety of the risky junk
bonds sold at Lincoln branches.
   Keating and the others are charged with ordering employees to
steer Lincoln depositors away from insured certificates of deposit
and into the bonds.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Amendment Permitting Abortion Counseling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate voted Thursday to reverse Bush
administration regulations that prohibit federally supported family
planning clinics from offering information on abortion.
   The regulations, which are the subject of a case before the
Supreme Court, were imposed in 1988 by the Reagan administratin and
continued after President Bush took office. They have become the
focus of debate between both sides of the abortion issue.
   The Senate voted 63-35 to approve an amendment offered by Sen.
John Chafee, R-R.I., saying the clinics must provide ``information
and counseling concerning all legal and medical options'' to
pregnant women who ask for it, including ``pregnancy termination.''
   The clinics provide helth care and family planning services for
the poor. The amendment was added to a Senate bill that extends the
life of the family planning program, established 20 years ago by
Title X of the Public Health Service Act.
   The Senate continued to debate other amendments to the
reauthorization bill into the evening, and a vote to limit debate
was tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
   Opponents of abortion opposed the amendment, arguing that the
federal government should not encourage abortions or make them more
available.
   ``Most Americans do not want their tax dollars used in any way
to facilitate abortions,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
   Advocates of abortion rights argued that the regulatory ban
discriminated against poor women, preventing them from having the
same information that women who could afford their own doctor would
receive. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, called them a ``gag
rule.''
   ``This program isn't about abortion. It's about options,'' said
Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md. ``Whether it's abstinence, adoption or
abortion, I believe young people have a right to know.''
   Since enactment in 1970, Title X has prohibited aid from going
to ``programs where abortion is a method of family planning.'' But
until 1988 that was interpreted as barring the use of federal money
to pay for abortions.
   The Reagan administration's Department of Health and Human
Services in 1988 adopted a broader interpretation that said federal
money couldn't go to family planning programs that provide
counseling and referral for abortion.
   The action touched off a series of lawsuits, and federal appeals
courts have delivered conflicting rulings. One of the cases is
scheduled for argument before the Supreme Court in its October
term.
   ``Why not let the court make this decision, because it's
probably going to have to in the end anyway,'' Hatch said.

   A young man who helped authorities
capture a gunman who held 20 people hostage inside a McDonald's
restaurant said Tuesday he was a reluctant hero.
   ``All I knew was to take care of my people, my crew,'' said the
restaurant's assistant manager, Ramiro Gironas. ``I'm glad I'm safe
and that all my people are safe. I'm not a hero. I just did what I
had to.''
   Police said Gironas, 21, hid in the kitchen during the
seven-hour standoff Monday night and Tuesday morning and kept them
informed by phone of the gunman's movements.
   Officers were eventually able to distract the man with explosive
charges and overpower him shortly after midnight. None of the
hostages was hurt.
   Douglas Girard, 32, of San Jacinto, was arrested for
investigation of armed robbery and false imprisonment, authorities
said.
   He was treated for minor facial injuries suffered during his
arrest and jailed in lieu of $500,000 bail.
   A second man, Frank M. Teresi, 38, of Anaheim, surrendered to
police shortly after the standoff began about 5:30 p.m. Monday in
this suburb 35 miles northeast of Los Angeles, said police Lt. Ron
Ingels.
   Teresi, on parole for robbery and being under the influence of a
narcotic, was jailed on a no-bail parole hold, said police Sgt.
John Ortega.
   Police said the standoff began after Girard allegedly robbed a
nearby Kids Mart clothing store of $200, while warning he had an
armed partner outside.
   Authorities said Girard and Teresi ran from the store to the
McDonald's.
   Eleven employees and one customer hid in the basement when they
noticed a .38 caliber revolver in Girard's back pocket. Authorities
said he forced the remaining eight people to lie on the floor.
   An 18-member Los Angeles County sheriff's SWAT team, along with
dozens of Pomona and La Verne police officers, surrounded the
restaurant and negotiators tried unsuccessfully to talk with the
gunman.
   Officers finally lobbed ``flash-bang'' percussion grenades into
the restaurant as a distraction.
   ``They were able to get inside without being detected,'' said
Deputy Bill Wehner, a sheriffs' spokesman. ``A deputy leaped over
the counter and took the suspect into custody.''

<HEAD>Police Blame Vendetta by 14-Year-Old Girl for Picnic Poisoning</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUBURN, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 14-year-old girl took a page from the
script of the movie ``Heathers'' in plotting revenge against two
11-year-old playmates she allegedly fed poisoned picnic fare,
police said Tuesday.
   Other girls invited to the picnic and croquet party were aware
that a peanut butter sandwich had been laced with rat poison and
some grape drink mixed with a household cleanser, police spokesman
Tony Burtt said.
   They stood by while the victims tasted the poisoned food and
drink Sept. 16, and didn't report the plot until afterward, police
said. Then the children told their parents.
   One 11-year-old girl vomited after tasting the grape-flavored
drink and the other girl suffered stomach pains after taking
several bites of the tainted sandwich, police said. Neither had any
serious aftereffects.
   None of the children was identified.
   The mother of the 14-year-old denied that her daughter planned
the poisoning. In an interview for Wednesday's editions of the
Valley Daily News, she blamed two other 11-year-old playmates at
the picnic. The paper withheld the mother's name to avoid
identifying the children.
   ``At the very least, they were more than just witnesses,'' she
said.
   Burtt agreed the 11-year-olds may have been involved, but said
investigators believe the teen-ager staged the picnic to get
revenge.
   A dispute over possession of a ``Heathers'' videotape and
clothing and jewelry allegedly taken by one of the victims prompted
the poisoning, he said. Friends told police the teen-age girl said
she got the idea from the plot of ``Heathers,'' an R-rated dark
comedy featuring teen-age murder and a tight clique of popular
girls.
   In the film, the leader of the in-crowd is killed with household
poisons. The movie opens and closes with characters playing
croquet.
   Two girls told investigators they were at the 14-year-old's home
the day she came up with the plan for the picnic, Burtt said.
   The teen-ager allegedly made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches
and put them in plastic bags. Rat poison was hidden in one
sandwich, which was cut and wrapped differently so it could be
picked from the others.
   The girl told her friends she expected the food to make the
girls sick but not to seriously harm them, other children later
told police.
   No charges have been filed pending completion of the police
investigation, said Dan Donohoe of the King County prosecutor's
office. It was being investigated as a possible criminal assault,
police said.
   The food was seized as evidence.
   ``It's scary because the girl that's supposed to have done all
this was a friend of my daughter's,'' the mother of the girl who
got the grape drink told the newspaper. ``They've been good friends
for a year, and they used to spend the night at each other's
houses.''

   The army demolished or sealed 37 Palestinian
shops and houses on Monday night and Tuesday in the Gaza Strip's
Bureij refugee camp, where a soldier was killed last week, the
military command said.
   It said 26 shops and seven houses were demolished and four
additional houses were sealed ``to allow safer transportation in
the area.''
   The camp remained under curfew imposed soon after reserve Sgt.
Amnon Pomeranz, 46, was stoned to death. Searches continued for
accomplices in the death, the military said.
   Bulldozers leveled 15 buildings in Bureij on Monday night before
a temporary restraining order halted razing. The Supreme Court
canceled the order Tuesday and demolition resumed.
   Palestinian journalists said about seven bulldozers, backed up
by 25 army trucks, destroyed buildings on the main road at the
camp's entrance after dark Tuesday.
   The army said the road had to be widened to improve security and
that the demolitions were not punitive.
   Pomeranz was killed after his car hit a donkey cart, injuring
two Palestinian teen-agers. A Palestinian mob set his car and body
afire.
   He was the 12th soldier to die since the Palestinian uprising
against Israeli occupation began in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in
December 1987.
   The restraining order was obtained Monday by the Association for
Civil Rights in Israel, which said Palestinians should be given a
chance to appeal the deolition order.
   A three-judge Supreme Court panel canceled the order Tuesday,
but did not make its findings public.
   Maj. Gen. Matan Vilnai, chief of the Southern Command, told the
judges the demolitions were required to meet ``an immediate and
urgent military need.''
   He said Palestinians not involved in the killing would be
compensated with ``alternate shops and houses.''
   Shmuel Ovenboy, spokesman for the military government, which is
responsible for administration in Gaza, said: ``I don't know a
thing about this.''
   The army has demolished more than 300 homes as punishment for
Arab suspects since the uprising began 34 months ago.
   Human rights groups and the U.S. State Department have condemned
the demolition as collective punishment.
   Israeli newspapers say the government also is considering
deporting Palestinians suspected in the sergeant's death.
   Journalists have been barred from entering Bureij, home to
20,000 Palestinians.
   Nearby Nusseirat camp and Jabaliya camp to the north were put
under curfew Tuesday to prevent violence, the army said.
   Pomeranz was the 48th Israeli to die in the uprising. Israelis
have killed 730 Palestinians. At least 265 Palestinians have been
killed by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of collaboration.
   Masked Palestinian gunmen killed Ibrahim Abu Obeid, 35, on
Tuesday in the Gaza town of Rafah as a suspected collaborator, Arab
reporters said.
   The army said it was checking the report.

<HEAD>President Gaviria Presents New Peace Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAVIER BAENA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Cesar Gaviria, confronted with
a resurgence of guerrilla attacks, agreed Tuesday to rebel demands
for international supervision of any possible cease-fire.
   Gaviria made the announcement at a news conference in Bogota
shortly before leaving for the United Nations.
   He said international supervision of a cease-fire is possible
``any time the guerrillas halt their kidnappings, taking of
hostages, terrorist attacks and their recruiting of children 15 and
younger.''
   ``We are thereby removing any obstacle that might keep rebelious
groups from adhering to the government's position of peace,''
Gaviria said.
   There was no immediate response from the two main rebel groups
that Gaviria's statment was aimed at: the National Liberation Army
and the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces.
   The groups have been fighting in the mountains and jungles of
Colombia for more than 20 years. Their attacks contribute to a
climate of violence that includes murders and kidnappings by
right-wing death squads and drug smugglers.
   The cease-fire would be the first step toward convincing the
guerrillas to disband and form civilian groups to participate in
the country's politics.
   A constituent assembly will meet next February to consider
proposals to change the country's constitution, including a wider
distribution of power now held mostly by the country's traditional
parties, the Liberals and Conservatives.
   The government has said that if guerrillas want to participate
in the assembly, they must sign a peace agreement and take steps
toward disbanding.
   The guerrillas have been ambushing army patrols and attacking
towns in the last few weeks. On Sept. 5 they blew up the main oil
pipeline in the country.
   A third major guerrilla group, the April 19 Movement, disbanded
last February in exchange for amnesty and the right to form a
political party. Antonio Navarro, one of the movement's leaders, is
serving as health minister for Gaviria.

   President Bush appealed Tuesday for a
``generous response from the world community'' for countries rocked
by the Persian Gulf crisis as the Pentagon reported new buildups of
Iraqi troops and armor in Southern Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
   Bush, speaking to the annual meeting of the 152-member
International Monetary Fnd, announced he was forming an
international clearing house to coordinate financial help for the
most seriously affected countries.
   ``We are determined not to allow the brutal behavior of one
aggressor to undermine the historic process of democratic change or
to derail the movement towards market-oriented economic systems,''
Bush told the gathering of world financial leaders.
   Meanwhile, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said about 430,000
Iraqi soldiers are now in southern Iraq and Kuwait, within striking
distance of Saudi Arabia. Last week, the total was put at 360,000.
   Williams said the Iraqi deployments still appeared to be
``essentially a defensive force,'' but were capable of readily
converting to an offensive unit.
   But Bush was told earlier by Turkish President Turgot Ozal that
western estimates of Saddam Hussein's military capability may be
overstated, a State Department official said.
   Deputy Assistant Secretary of State James Dobbins, briefing
reporters on the Bush-Ozal meeting, said that Ozal and his aides
told Bush that ``there is an inordinate concern with Iraqi
capabilities. It is an exaggerated concern.''
   Ozal himself, answering questions at a National Press Club
luncheon, said Saddam in his war with Iran ``was supported heavily
by Russia, by France, by many Western nations, and also heavily
supported by his neighbors, Arab neighbors, including Kuwait, Saudi
Arabia - maybe more than $200 billion. And on the other hand,
Iranians were not supported by the West, there was even an
effective embargo on them for arms sales. The war took eight years.
How you can say this is a strong army?''
   In his speech to the IMF and the World Bank, Bush said he was
creating a Gulf Crisis Financial Coordination Group to help
``transform commitments into concrete contributions.''
   And, while the group will first meet under the auspices of the
U.S. Treasury, Bush made it clear he would welcome an increased
role by the IMF in the panel's deliberations.
   ``The political leadership of the U.N. must be matched by the
economic leadership of the of the IMF and the World Bank,'' he
said.
   Earlier in the day, World Bank President Barber Conable outlined
emergency plans to help resettle hundreds of thousands of refugees
fleeing Iraq and Kuwait.
   Bush noted the refugee crisis, as well as unemployment problems
and serious disruptions in the price and flow of oil.
   ``This staggering burden, which is pressing upon those most
seriously affected countries, calls for a generous response from
the world community,'' Bush said.
   He noted that the United States had already begun mobilizing
financial help for front-line states such as Egypt, Jordan and
Turkey. The United States has extracted pledges of $20 billion in
military and financial aid from allies.
   Bush said that the new group, expected to hold its first meeting
on Wednesday, would be chaired by Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady. Its members will also include Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the
United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Germany, Britain, Italy, France,
Canada, South Korea and the European Community.
   An administration official said Wednesday's meeting of the new
group was an organizing session among donor countries to discuss a
wide variety of issues - including how much needs to be raised.
   He would not predict whether the group, an informal clearing
house to coordinate the flow of money, would be able to reach a
consensus on the funding amount.
   A West German official, who briefed reporters on condition of
anonymity, said that the United States was seeking approximately
$4.5 billion in assistance for Egypt, Turkey and Jordan for this
year and an additional $10 billion in 1991.
   The German official said some countries may balk at the size of
the contribution being sought by the United States. He suggested
that the U.S. fund-raising drive should be expanded to include
Switzerland and Sweden.
   Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, whose country has
pledged $4 billion so far in the campaign against Saddam Hussein,
said the Japanese are willing to participate in Bush's crisis
coordinating group but he indicated numerous details on the
proposal remained to be negotiated between the large donor
countries.
   ``President Bush gave one idea. Whether it will go ahead will
depend on the response of the countries involved,'' Hashimoto told
reporters.
   Earlier Tuesday, Bush met with Ozal and, separately, with
Portuguese Prime Minister Cavaco Silva. Both leaders voiced strong
support for the U.S.-led effort to isolate Saddam Hussein.
   In a brief ceremony after Bush's meeting with Ozal, Bush praised
``staunch allies like Turkey'' for solidarity with the United
Nations and the United States in telling ``the world we will not
tolerate this invasion.''
   ``It will not stand,'' Bush added.
   Bush said the United States would seek a new agreement to
increase textile imports from Turkey. And he said he promised Ozal
the administration would continue to support Turkey's bid to become
the 13th member of the European Community.
   Bush also pledge to work closely with Congress to make sure
Turkey gets ``its fair share'' of military aid in the coming year.
``We will also work to help modernize the Turkish armed forces by
the future sales of F-16s and provision of other military
equipment,'' Bush said.
   Asked by reporters at a picture-taking session in the Oval
Office how long Turkey could endure hardships caused by the
embargo, Ozal said, ``as much as it requires.''
   Turkey was one of the first nations to help the United States
after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait by closing a major pipeline
carrying Iraqi oil. Portugal is allowing U.S. airlift flights to
Saudi Arabia to use an air base in the Azores for refueling.
   The Portuguese leader said after his meeting with Bush that the
``international community must stick together and be very
firm...Nobody can accept that such a brutal aggression will pay
off.''
   The Pentagon said call-ups of reserves from all services have
reached 21,970, an increase of 317 from its previous tally
announced last week. Maj. Doug Hart, a Pentagon spokesman, said a
larger increase is likely to be announced late this week.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has said up to 50,000 reserves may
be on active duty by Sept. 30. In all, there are over 150,000 U.S.
troops in the Middle East.

   Thousands of people went on a 24-hour strike
Tuesday in the disputed Caucasus mountain region of
Nagorno-Karabakh, demanding the restoration of rule by its Armenian
majority, according to Soviet news reports.
   The protest was peaceful, Tass reported, with no interference by
Soviet Interior Ministry troops that are enforcing the state of
emergency in the enclave, which is inside the republic of
Azerbaijan.
   In the past two years, more than 200 people have died in the
dispute between the predominantly Christian republic of Armenia and
neighboring Azerbaijan, which is predominantly Shiite Moslem, over
control of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   The protesters expressed support for parliament deputies from
Nagorno-Karabakh who are on a hunger strike to protest the
dissolution of regional councils by the Soviets, according to Tass
and the independent Interfax news agency.
   Interfax said thousands of people participated in unspecified
acts of civil disobedience in Stepanakert, the enclave's
administrative center, and other areas of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Armenians claim President Mikhail Gorbachev has done little to
protect them since the Soviet government's Special Administration
Committee, which controlled Nagorno-Karabakh for 10 months,
returned it to Azerbaijani rule in November.
   Azerbaijani authorities have been altering administrative
boundaries in Nagorno-Karabakh and resettling Azerbaijani refugees
there, the protesters claim.
   Protesters sent a telegram to Gorbachev on Tuesday that said
concentrations of Azerbaijani militants were growing in the region.

   A federal judge Tuesday threw out
campaign contribution limits imposed by California voters in 1988,
saying they give an unfair advantage to incumbents.
   U.S. District Judge Lawrence Karlton knocked out the limits
created by Proposition 73 and also tossed out the proposition's ban
on transfers of funds between candidates.
   The ruling sent a shock wave through California's political
establishment, although it was uncertain what effect the ruling
would have on the gubernatorial race between Democrat Dianne
Feinstein and Republican Pete Wilson.
   Both national political parties, concerned over the outcome of
the governor's race because of reapportionment stemming from the
1990 census, have targeted the California governor's race as a top
priority.
   If allowed to stand, the decision means candidates for governor,
other statewide posts and, in some cases, local offices will have
no contribution limits during the remaining six weeks of the
election campaign, a spokeswoman for the Fair Political Practices
Commission said.
   But FPPC chairman John Larson warned candidates not to start a
``fund-raising frenzy,'' saying the commission would ask Karlton to
stay his rling. Proposition sponsors also said they would appeal
the decision.
   Larson said that if the decision remains in place, the FPPC will
enforce similar contribution limits in Proposition 68, but that
measure applies only to legislative candidates.
   Voters approved both Propositions 68 and 73 in June 1988, but 73
took effect because it got more votes. However, a few minor
provisions of 68 also became law.
   Proposition 73's limits, which, among other things, allow
individuals to give no more than $1,000 to a particular candidate
per fiscal year, apply to state and local candidates.
   The measure also allows political action committees to give up
to $2,500 or $5,000 per candidate per fiscal year, depending on the
size of the committee.
   Assembly Minority Leader Ross Johnson and state Sen. Quentin
Kopp, I-San Francisco, two of the co-authors of Proposition 73,
said they planned to ask the 9th Circuit Court of Appeal on
Wednesday to overturn Karlton's ruling.
   ``The timing of this decision is most unfortunate,'' Johnson
said. ``Closing arguments were heard April 19 and we finally get a
ruling just six weeks before Election Day. There will be enormous
confusion now as hundreds of candidates at all levels of government
try to figure out what the new rules are.''
   Proposition 73 was sponsored as an alternative to the
reform-group-supported Proposition 68 and bases its contribution
limits on fiscal years that start on July 1.
   Since state election campaigns typically span two calendar
years, the measure creates three contribution periods: the first
six months of the non-election year, the last six months of the
non-election year and the first half of the election year, and the
last half of the election year.
   That means that an individual contributor can give a candidate
$3,000 over two calendar years.
   Critics say the fiscal-year format helps incumbents because they
usually start raising funds earlier than challengers. Karlton
agreed.
   Karlton issued the decision in response to a lawsuit filed by
the state Democratic Party and labor unions, which said Proposition
73 unfairly limited constitutional rights to free speech and
association.

   Two Canadians tourists beaten by a gang that
mistook their help for an elderly woman as a mugging got some help
from neighborhood merchants - including $100 in cash, auto repairs
and a free lunch.
   Merchants in Bensonhurst, the predominantly white Brooklyn
neighborhood where black teen-ager Yusef Hawkins was killed by a
mob in August 1989, took up a collection for the tourists Tuesday.
   ``With all the bad, with the Hawkins killing last year, I'm glad
something good came out of the neighborhood, instead of something
negative,'' said Vinny Pinello, owner of Reliable Auto Repair.
   Eric Plourde, 19, and Patrick Chartrand, 20, both of Quebec,
were beaten with baseball bats and pipes Monday afternoon while
assising an elderly woman who fell, police Detective Joseph
McConville said.
   ``Apparently these kids thought these two guys were mugging the
old lady,'' McConville said. The group numbered between 10 and 12
members, he said.
   The Canadian men were treated at Coney Island Hospital for
bruises after the beating, and released, spokesman Daniel Armstrong
said.
   Gang members also smashed their car's windshield and two other
windows, police said. Pinello said he began organizing assistance
after officers asked him for some plastic to cover the shattered
windows.
   No arrests were made in the case, and authorities were searching
for the youths and the woman, who left the scene before police
arrived.
   Tourists have suffered notable crimes in New York this summer,
with a Utah tourist stabbed to death while protecting his mother
during a Manhattan subway mugging and a Soviet visitor slain by
thieves who snatched his wife's purse.
   After learning that Plourde and Chartrand only had $25 between
them, merchants ``got up $100 in maybe 90 seconds,'' Pinello said.
``I'm sorry we didn't give them more.''
   While the money was being collected, a customer at the auto
store bought the young men sandwiches. By late Tuesday, the car's
smashed windows were fixed at no charge.
   ``They were so appreciative, when we handed them the money, they
looked like they were going to cry,'' said Fred Alvaro, owner of
Fre-Val Home Improvement, who added that he helped ``so that they
don't get the impression that all New Yorkers are bad.''
   ``These kids are like a pack of wild dogs, they follow the
leader,'' Alvaro said of the gang that attacked the tourists, whom
he described as ``nice kids who weren't looking to hurt a fly.''

   In a decision that could have a
profound impact on the November governor's election, a federal
judge Tuesday threw out campaign contribution limits imposed by
California voters in 1988.
   The decision, if allowed to stand, means candidates for
governor, other statewide posts and, in some cases, local offices
will have no contribution limits during the remaining six weeks of
the campaign, said a spokeswoman for the state Fair Political
Practices Commission.
   U.S. District Judge Lawrence Karlton said the limits give an
unfair advantage to incumbents. Karlton also tossed out the a ban
on transfers of funds between candidates that was imposed by the
same ballot initiative.
   The ruling invalidated Proposition 73, which, among other
things, limits individuals to a maximum of $1,000 in contributions
to a particular candidate per fiscal year. The measure also limits
political action committees donations of $2,500 or $5,000 per
candidate per fiscal year, depending on the size of the committee.
   The ruling sent a shock wave through California's political
establishment, although it was uncertain what effect the ruling
would have on the gubernatorial race between Democrat Dianne
Feinstein and Republican Pete Wilson.
   Wilson, who had only token opposition in the June primary,
raised $12.5 million through June and had $3.9 million in the bank
as of July 1. Feinstein raised $8.1 million through June but had
only $645,344 left over from her primary campaign against state
Attorney General John Van de Kamp.
   Aides to both candidates claimed not to know how much they have
raised since June.
   Wilson challenged Feinstein to join him in abiding by
Proposition 73 if Karlton's ruling is upheld. But spokesman Bill
Livingstone would not commit the candidate to following the measure
if Feinstein doesn't follow suit.
   Feinstein spokeswoman DeeDee Myers said Feinstein hadn't decided
what to do.
   She said that removal of the limits ``gives us a chance to close
the gap a little,'' but she predicted Wilson would still raise more
money.
   But John Larson, chairman of the Fair Politicial Practices
Commissio, warned candidates against a ``fund-raising frenzy,''
saying the commission would ask Karlton to stay his ruling. The
proposition sponsors also said they would appeal the decision.
   The decision was in a lawsuit filed by the state Democratic
Party and labor unions, which said Proposition 73 unfairly limited
constitutional rights to free speech and association.
   Proposition 73, which was sponsored by three legislators as an
alternative to the reform-group-supported Proposition 68, bases its
contribution limits on fiscal years that start on July 1.
   Since state election campaigns typically span two calendar
years, the measure creates three contribution periods. That means
that means an individual contributor can give a candidate $3,000
over two calendar years.
   In this election, for example, a candidate who began
fund-raising early could collect up to the limit from a particular
contributor for the period from January through June of 1989. Then
the same person could again donate the limit for the fiscal year
that ran from July 1989 through June 1990. And he could give again
before the election, in the fiscal year that began July 1.
   Critics say the fiscal-year format helps incumbents because they
usually start raising funds earlier than challengers. Karlton
agreed.
   Voters approved both Propositions 68 and 73 in June 1988, but 73
took effect because it got more votes. However, a few minor
provisions of 68 also became law, where they didn't conflict with
Prop 73.
   Some provisions of the competing measure, Proposition 68, also
took effect, including one that limits contributions in races for
the state Legislature. If the court decision isn't suspended or
reversed the political commission will enforce those limits, Larson
said.
   Assembly Minority Leader Ross Johnson, R-Fullerton, and state
Sen. Quentin Kopp, I-San Francisco, two of the co-authors of
Proposition 73, said they planned to ask the 9th Circuit Court of
Appeal on Wednesday to overturn Karlton's ruling.
   ``The timing of this decision is most unfortunate,'' Johnson
said. ``There will be enormous confusion now as hundreds of
candidates at all levels of government try to figure out what the
new rules are.''
   Former Gov. Jerry Brown, the chairman of the state Democratic
Party, which was one of the plaintiffs in the case, said the
decision ``strikes down one of the most pernicious campaign laws
ever enacted and puts an end to the pervasive state censorship of
grassroots activism imposed by Proposition 73.''

<HEAD>Chicago Power Company Agrees to One-Year Franchise Extension</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commonwealth Edison Co. agreed to a one-year
extension of its contract Tuesday while the city investigates a
recent series of power failures.
   The old contract expires Dec. 31, but city officials month
halted negotiations for a new deal, saying it wanted to extend the
existing apct while it examines whether Edison is dependable.
   ``While we had hoped to reach agreement on a new franchise
before Dec. 31, an extension will preserve what we believe is
already the best set of benefits held by any major city in the
country,'' Edison Chairman James J. O'Connor said Tuesday in a news
release.
   The extension of the 42-year-old contract calls for continued
payment of Edison's municipal franchise fee, which is 4 percent of
the company's gross revenues. The 1990 payment is estimated at $66
million, O'Connor said.
   Chicago Mayor Richard Daley was welcomed the extension agreement
reached while the Illinois Commerce Commission and the city
investigate recent power failures, Daley spokeswoman Carolyn Grisko
said.
   Edison is trying to salvage its image after blackouts including
one in late July that left 40,000 West Side customers without
electricity for three days. Some small stores were looted during
the outage.
   About a week later, another outage cut power to 25,000
customers. Four less severe power failures have hit the city and
suburbs in recent days, affecting thousands of customers.

   The U.N. Security Council ordered an air embargo of Iraq on
Tuesday and warned of worse to come unless Iraq quits Kuwait. The
vote was 14-1, with only Cuba opposed, and extended the powers of
an earlier U.N. trade embargo.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III cautioned, ``Acts
have consequences. . . . For international society to permit Iraq
to overwhelm a small neighbor and to erase it from the map would
send a disastrous message.''
   Iraqi Ambassador Abdul Al-Anbari, who had been attending as an
interested party, stalked out after the vote, saying ``boycotting a
country by enforcing a naval embargo as well as an air embargo is
an act of aggression, an act of war.''
   He said Iraq has ``been practicing self-restraint because we
know that if war were to break out, it would destroy everything in
the region.''
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, who presided at the
special council meeting, said war was an option, if not a desirable
one, but ``I hope that peaceful ways will be found to find a way
out.''
   Earlier, Shevardnadze joined a world chorus of rage and
indignation against Iraq, calling the lightning takeover of Kuwait
an ``act of terrorism'' and warning of possible U.N. military
action.
   Echoing a growing pessimism over the possibility of a diplomatic
solution soon, Shevardnadze warned: ``A great war may break out in
the gulf region any day, any moment.''
   The painful economic impact of the invasion, which left Saddam
Hussein's Iraq in control of 20 percent of the world's oil
reserves, grew more apparent.
   Crude oil prices approached $40 a barrel, nearly double the
price before the Aug. 2 blitzkrieg. Some U.S. analysts said Tuesday
in New York that gas prices may exceed $2 a gallon if a shooting
war breaks out in the Persian Gulf. They said the fallout will be
widespread if oil prices should stay high for long, running up the
cost of practically everything while slowing economic growth.
   The New York Stock Exchange has sunk to a 14-month low and gold
has passed $400 an ounce.
   President Bush appealed on Tuesday for a ``generous response
from the world community'' for countries hardest hit by the crisis.
He spoke at the annual meeting in Washington of the International
Monetary Fund.
   World Bank President Barber Conable on Tuesday outlined
emergency plans to help resettle hundreds of thousands of refugees
fleeing Iraq and Kuwait.
   The U.S. Defense Department meanwhile reported new buildups of
Iraqi troops and armor in southern Iraq and Kuwait, within striking
distance of Saudi Arabia and its vast oil fields. Pentagon
spokesman Pete Williams said about 430,000 Iraqi soldiers now are
in the area, up from 360,000 last week.
   He said Iraqi deployments still seemed to be ``essentially a
defensive force,'' but could readily convert to offense.
   Saddam showed no sign of yielding. He said in a message to
Americans broadcast Tuesday that Bush was sending Americans to a
war more terrible than Vietnam.
   In a rambling, 75-minute address taped last week, Saddam warned
that if Bush were to launch war against Iraq, ``It would not be up
to him to end it.''
   He repeatedly accused Bush and Kuwait's rulers of plotting to
impoverish Iraq and steal its oil.
   ``Bush, ladies and gentlemen, is sending your sons to war for no
purpose save fatal arrogance,'' the Iraqi president said.
   He spoke in Arabic, with English subtitles supplied by Iraqi
authorities.
   Security Council Resolution 670 sks all states to prevent use
of airspace by any passenger or cargo flight to or from Iraq or
occupied Kuwait, except for approved mercy missions.
   It bans use of force, but calls for searches and detention of
aircraft. It calls for halting Iraqi shipping and freezing Iraqi
assets overseas.
   The air embargo was one more step to completely isolate Iraq. A
naval force is currently enforcing the trade embargo.
   The council said it would consider ``serious action'' if Iraq
continued to defy the will of the international community, hinting
at a U.N. military operation. It said countries that evade the U.N.
embargo against Iraq may themselves face secondary sanctions.
   The resolution was the ninth passed by the Security Council
condemning Iraq over Kuwait.
   The session was unprecedented, with 13 foreign ministers
attending from among the council's 15 member states.
   Syrian President Hafez Assad meanwhile ended his four-day visit
to the Iranian capital, Tehran, having failed to persuade Iranian
leaders not to send food and other essentials to Iraq.
   Sources close to the Syrian delegation said Tehran insisted that
the embargo allows ``humanitarian shipments'' of food.
   Saddam has said he would rather go to war than let the
U.N.-ordered embargo ``strangle'' his country.
   On Tuesday, Baghdad announced it would put Bush ``on trial'' for
``crimes against the peoples of the world,'' and it set a date -
Oct. 15.
   Shevardnadze suggested the same should be done to Saddam.
   He told the General Assembly that people who take hostages, use
torture, threaten nations with destruction and are ``guilty of
particular ruthlessness in the use of force'' should be tried by an
international tribunal for their ``crime against humanity.''
   Saddam has threatened to destroy Israel, and has detained
thousands of Westerners, moving some to strategic sites to serve as
shields against potential Western attack.
   The Soviet foreign minister noted that the United Nations has
the power to suppress acts of aggression. ``There is ample evidence
that this right can be exercised,'' he said, adding that such a
step should come only after peaceful, non-military options have
been exhausted.
   Although the Soviets have not joined the U.S.-led multinational
force amassing in the gulf, they have said they might be willing to
participate in a U.N. military effort - provided they share
command.
   In other developments Tuesday:
   -Saudi Arabia expelled 12 more diplomatic staff from Jordan's
consulate and embassy Tuesday, and Jordan recalled its ambassador
in protest, Jordan said. It said that left eight Jordanian
diplomatic employees in Riyadh and Jiddah.
   Last week, the Saudis expelled 20 Jordanian diplomatic employees
for activities ``incompatible with their status'' - a diplomatic
euphemism for espionage.
   -Two Argentine warships left for the gulf on Tuesday to become
the first Latin nation to help enforce the U.N. trade embargo on
Iraq. Legislators complained that President Carlos Menem acted
unconstitutionally in not getting Congress' consent.
   -The French Foreign Ministry said Iraqi soldiers have taken two
new French nationals hostage in Kuwait and transported them to an
unknown destination.
   The news came a day after French President Francois Mitterrand,
opening the General Assembly, called Iraq a warlike state and
expressed outrage over Iraqi raids on European embassy compounds in
Kuwait.
   -U.S. military sources said the Pentagon was continuing to
activate reserve forces for Operation Desert Shield, but that the
total call-up was likely to fall well short of the 50,000
authorized by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   The Pentagon said call-ups of reserves from all services had
reached 21,970.

Assassination</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge operating in secrecy has charged
Pablo Escobar, leader of the Medellin drug cartel, with last year's
assassination of a presidential candidate during a campaign rally,
the court said Tuesday.
   Colombia's new president, Cesar Gaviria, has said Escobar would
be extradited to the United States if captured.
   Escobar was charged with planning and ordering the murder of
Luis Carlos Galan, cut down by automatic weapons fire as he
prepared to deliver a speech in a poor Bogota neighborhood on Aug.
18, 1989.
   The killing provoked then-President Virgilio Barco to begin a
crackdown on drug traffickers that developed into a bloody war with
the cartel.
   The name of the judge ordering Escobar's arrest was kept secret
lest he be murdered, according to a communique from Colombia's
federal court system.
   In the last nine years, 228 judges and other court employees
have been slain, mostly by drug traffickers who could not bribe or
threaten them into silence.
   Escobar also has been charged in the March 1989 killing of
leftist presidential candidate Bernardo Jaramillo and in the
December 1987 slaying of Guillermo Cano, owner of the Bogota daily
El Espectador.
   He also is wantedfor planning a car bomb explosion which killed
63 people last December in front of the secret police headquarters
of Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez.
   Gaviria has said fewer extraditions will take place under his
government, but prominent cartel leaders still would be charged in
the United States. Colombia has major problems in prosecuting the
powerful drug lords, who can easily pay off or threaten police,
judges and jailers.
   Last week, Eduardo Rueda, an alleged triggerman in Galan's
shooting, escaped from La Picota Prison in Bogota. The daily El
Tiempo quoted investigators as saying Rueda paid more than $250,000
in bribes to walk out.
   In a speech Tuesday, Gaviria attacked the latest round of
intimidation by drug traffickers - the kidnapping of seven
Colombian journalists.
   ``Millions of Colombians are closing ranks to demand the safe
return of these people,'' he told reporters and others who began a
drive to free the reporters.
   Six of the journalists, including Diana Turbay de Uribe,
daughter of former President Julio Cesar Turbay, disappeared on
Aug. 30.
   Francisco Santos, 28, news editor of El Tiempo, was kidnapped
last Wednesday.
   El Tiempo said it later received an anonymous phone call from a
man claiming to speak for the Medellin cartel, who said its members
want the government to grant them full pardons, as it has done with
leftist guerrillas who surrender weapons.
   Gaviria has said there will be no negotiations with drug
traffickers.

   Ford Motor Co. on Tuesday recalled about
14,500 Aerostar minivans and about 18,000 L-Series heavy trucks for
possible safety problems.
   The company said latches on optional second-row, right-hand
captain's seats on 1989-90 Aerostars could fail, allowing the seat
to tilt forward unexpectedly.
   Ford said it was unaware of accidents involving the latches.
   The company also said a valve in the air-brake systems of the
heavy trucks could malfunction causing a loss of pressure in
front-wheel brake assemblies. Should such a pressure loss occur,
the company said, there should be warnings and automatic
application of emergency brakes.
   There were no reports of brake failures stemming from the valve
problem, Ford said.
   Owners will be notified by mail and repairs in both recalls
would be performed free of charge.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - After scrapping together funds and
convincing politicians it is safe to campaign, Haiti's Electoral
Council set Dec. 16 as the date for presidential and municipal
elections, an official said Tuesday.
   The elections have been postponed several times. They were last
set for Nov. 4, but the Electoral Council had to drop that date
because the impoverished government couldn't provide the money to
organize the voting.
   Last week, the Haitian government came up with $4 million. The
government will get an additional $1.5 million through the U.N.
Development Program and the U.S. government. West Germany and
France have made pledges as well.
   Jean Casimir, who heads the Electoral Council, said the Canadian
government confirmed paper to be used for ballots would arrive in
Haiti the first week of November. Without Canada's contribution of
the costly, imported paper, the election date could not be set, he
said.
   Many leading politicians had refused until recent days to
participate in any elections organized by interim President Ertha
Pascal-Trouillot, who was appointed in March. They claimed she was
unable to control the corrupt and violence-prone military.
   But several prominent parties announced Monday they had decided
to participate. Because of Haiti's weak democratic tradition, there
did not appear to be a front-runner in the election.
   The president-elect will be sworn in Feb. 7, 1991, the fifth
anniversary of the fall of the dictator, Jean Claude Duvalier. The
Duvalier family ruled Haiti for almost three decades.
   In 1987, the last attempt at free elections collapsed when thugs
supported by the army shot and hacked to death at least 34 voters.
Since its independence from France in 1804, Haiti has been ruled
mainly by dictators.

   The Marine Corps has grounded four Harrier jet
fighter-bombers similar to those sent to the Persian Gulf because
of faulty sensors that stabilize the aircraft, the service said
Tuesday.
   The vertical takeoff AV-8B planes were found to have defective
``rate sensor assemblies,'' a system which includes three
gyroscopes and provides direction information for the jet, said
Col. Stuart Wagner.
   ``It's not critical to flying the aircraft safely, but it's
something we want to fix,'' Wagner said of the assemblies, similar
to the power steering on a car.
   The rate sensor assemblies are wearing out faster than expected,
he said.
   Wagner said the grounded Harriers were based at Kaneohe Bay
Marine Corps Air Station in Hawaii. But Tuesday night, the Defense
Department said no Harriers were based there.
   The Defense Department spokesman, Army Maj. Mike Dibble, said he
was unable to determine immediately where the grounded planes were.
   The action has no effect on the Harriers deployed in Saudi
Arabia as part of the U.S. military buildup against Iraq, Wagner
said.
   The announcement on the grounding came as the House Government
Operations subcommittee on legislation and national security again
examined procurement and testing irregularities by Northrop Corp.
involving the Harrier jet and advanced cruise missile.
   Northrop pleaded guilty in February to 34 fraud charges and
agreed to pay $17 million in fines, which according to the Justice
Department is the largest criminal fine ever imposed on a defense
contractor.
   The charges stemmed from Northrop's work on the Harrier and the
nuclear-armed air-launched cruise missile. The Navy, which handles
procurement for the Marine Corps, suspended Northrup from further
contracts and recommended a suspension from all defense work. The
Air Force, however, is buying B-2 stealth bombers made by Northrup.
   Testimony before the House panel Tuesday detailing the
procurement and testing irregularities was similar to what the
Justice Department told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee in
July.
   Witnesses Tuesday described how Northrop never performed life
expectancy tests on the rate sensor assemblies.
   The assemblies were supposed to have undergone a vibration test
at 32 times the acceleration imparted by gravity, but instead were
tested at half that acceleration. They also were to have been
operated continuously for 4,000 hours to determine life expectancy.
   ``We decided that it would cost too much to perform this test at
an outside lab,'' Howard Hyde, a former chief engineer with
Northrop who is serving a one-year sentence for falsifying tests on
the Harrier jet, said of the vibration tests.
   No spare sensor assemblies are available, forcing the Marines to
park the $22 million planes as problems arise. No other company
produces the assemblies.
   The Marine Corps officer for the Harrier program told the panel
that it has waived the suspension against Northrop to buy a package
of spare rate sensor assemblies for $300,000.
   Col. James Hart said the service is working out a contract with
another manufacturer that will likely cost $1 million.
   ``Who will supply the new rate sensor assembly components to the
the Harriers back off the ground? The corporation that bilked us to
begin with,'' complained Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., chairman of
the Government Operations subcommittee.
   ``It looks like business as usual for Northrop. It has a corner
on the market and national security needs override all other
considerations.''
   The Marine Corps has nearly 200 Harriers, made by
McDonnell-Douglas Corp. under license from a British manufacturer.
   The Harriers, needing no runway to take off, can be based in
forest clearings and other unorthodox places to provide close
support and air cover for Marine units.
   Their swiveling jet exhaust nozzles give them outsanding
maneuverability in the air that enabled British pilots to dominate
their Argentine opponents in the 1982 Falklands War.

   Several dozen passengers were treated at
hospitals for ear problems Tuesday after a jetliner lost cabin
pressure over the Atlantic and had to return to Bangor
International Airport, officials said.
   About 20 passengers underwent minor surgery to relieve pressure
in their ears, said airport marketing director Bob Ziegelaar.
Seventy-two of the 206 people aboard the Air Europe Boeing 757
received hospital treatment, he said.
   The flight, which originated in Orlando, Fla., and was bound for
Newcastle, England, landed about 2:30 a.m. It had left Bangor
around midnight Monday and lost cabin pressure about an hour later,
Ziegelaar said.
   An emergency landing was not necessary and the passengers were
never in serious danger, he said. The cause of the pressure loss
was undetermined.
   All 206 passengers boarded an alternate flight Tuesday evening,
said Dave Bellomy, an airport dispatcher.

   Indicted state Rep. Robert Kohn, who
prosecutors said had worked undercover for the FBI in its
investigation of vote-buying in the South Carolina Statehouse,
resigned Tuesday.
   Kohn, 45, a Republican, is among ten state lawmakers indicted by
a federal grand jury looking into Statehouse corruption. A
representative since 1975, Kohn was suspended from his seat
following his Aug. 24 indictment.
   His resignation takes effect at noon Wednesday. Two hours later,
he is to appear before U.S. District Judge Falcon Hawkins in
Charleston for a plea hearing.
   Kohn is charged with one count of conspiring to violate the
federal Hobbs Act, which among other things outlaws bribery of
officials. He faces up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine if
convicted.
   Nine South Carolina lawmakers were indicted in an investigation
of vote-selling related to a bill to let voters consider
pari-mutuel betting. A tenth lawmaker and a registered lobbyist
were indicted on drug charges unrelated to the vote-buying probe
dubbed ``Operation Lost Trust.''
   Three lawmakers have pleaded guilty and await sentencing.
   The grand jury charged that Kohn and another lawmaker met with
lobbyist Ron Cobb and agreed to accept money for supporting the
pari-mutuel bill and to get other lawmakers to support it too. Cobb
was working undercover at the time.
   Prosecutors said Kohn also worked secretly for the FBI, in its
case against former GOP Rep. Daniel Winstead.
   When Winstead pleaded guilty earlier this month, prosecutors
showed a grainy videotape of Kohn giving him an envelope at a
restaurant. Prosecutors said the envelope contained $1,000 given to
Kohn by the FBI.
   Prosecutors also presented transcripts of a conversation between
Kohn and Winstead that Kohn secretly recorded. In it, the lawmakers
discuss the investigation and Winstead tells Kohn, ``Let it roll,
and deny everything.''

   An Israeli woman's dream of resettling in Florida
was snatched away by a robber who grabbed her purse with more than
$275,000 in cash and jewels inside, officials said.
   Marie T. Spector, 58, of Tel Aviv was robbed Sunday morning and
lost family heirlooms including diamond earrings, an opal necklace,
pearls and a gold necklace, police said.
   ``She was screaming, she was crying, she was hysterical, she was
sick, she needed Valium,'' said Mara Meir, who was with her friend
when she was robbed.
   Mrs. Spector had planned to open a bank safe deposit box on
Monday. The $273,700 in jewels and $1,300 in cash she was carrying
weren't insured.
   Ms. Meir and Mrs. Spector were going to her hotel to meet her
husband when the two heard footsteps from behind. Ms. Meir told
police she threw her purse at a young man who charged her.
   Mrs. Spector tried to fend off the other mugger and was dragged
along the sidewalk until he ripped her bag out of her grasp.
   The Spectors, who left Israel Saturday, hired Miami attorney
Norman Funt to see how they might recover the loss. Funt said the
couple had left Miami.
   ``Mrs. Spector was a little disenchanted with the welcome she
received,'' Funt said.

   The U.N. Security Council voted 14-1
Tuesday to impose an air embargo against Iraq in an effort to force
Iraqi occupying forces to quit Kuwait. Iraq's envoy called it ``an
act of war.''
   The council warned Baghdad it may take further punitive action
and hinted at sanctions against nations that fail to observe U.N.
measures against Iraq.
   Cuba cast the only vote opposing Resolution 670, which directs
all states to bar use of airspace by any passenger or cargo flight
to or from Iraq or occupied Kuwait, except for approved mercy
missions.
   Iraqi Ambassador Abdul Al-Anbari, who attended as an interested
party, stalked out after the vote, saying, ``You know, boycotting a
country by enforcing a naval embargo as well as an air embargo is
an act of aggression, an act of war.
   ``But up to now we have been practicing self-restraint because
we know that if war were to break out, it would destroy everything
in the region.''
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, who presided, said
in response that ``even if this resolution is not observed, there
are certain other things that can be done short of war, because
this is not yet a full blockade of Iraq.''
   Shevardnadze said war ``is not a desirable option, but it is one
of the options contained in the U.N. Charter. Anyway, I hope that
peaceful ways will be found to find a way out.''
   He spoke in Russian through a translator.
   Tuesday marked the ninth time the Security Council has condemned
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and demanded immediate withdrawal.
   The resolution prohibits use of force, but calls for searches
and detention of aircraft; for halting Iraqi shipping, and freezing
Iraqi assets overseas.
   The council warned it would consider ``serious action'' if Iraq
continued to flout international will, hinting at a U.N. military
operation. It said countries that evade the U.N. embargo against
Iraq may themselves face secondary sanctions.
   At a breakfast meeting with journalists Tuesday, British Foreign
Secretary Douglas Hurd remarked, ``I don't see much in the way of
next steps except against sanctions-busters.''
   The presence of 13 foreign ministers among the council's 15
member states underscored the determination of the international
community to compel Iraq to quit Kuwait.
   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said it was the first time in
the United Nations' 45-year history so many foreign ministers
attended a meeting to vote on a substantive issue.
   On only three previous occasions have the foreign ministers of
all five permanent members - the United States, the Soviet Union,
Britain, China and France - attended a Security Council meeting.
   ``Rarely has the international community been so united and
determined that aggression should not succeed,'' U.S. Secretary of
State James A. Baker III told the council.
   ``Iraq has been quarantined because its brutal actions have
separated it from the community of nations. There can be no
business as usual. In fact, there can be no economic exchanges with
Iraq at all.''
   The Security Council earlier adopted a trade embargo against
Iraq that includes a ban on air traffic. The new resolution makes
the air embargo explicit and gives states the power to enforce it.
   Cuba has said it is against any sanctions on Iraq.
   Earlier resolutions authorized ships to implement a maritime
embargo and to stop and search vessels that may be violating trade
sanctions.
   Other resolutions repudiated the annexation of Kuwait, demanded
the release of hostages and condemned Iraqi raids on foreign
missions in Kuwait.
   Baker warned, ``Each day that Iraqi officials flout norms of
elementary decency makes it that much more difficult for Iraq to
resume its place in the international community.''
   The resolution did not spell out the mechanics of
implementation. Diplomats said lawyers would be studying the text.
   Baker said the council puts Iraq on notice that continued
failure to obey the international community could lead to further
action under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which provides for U.N.
military intervention.
   Shevardnadze said earlier: ``This (Iraqi invasion) is a major
affront to mankind. . . . The United Nations has the power to
suppress acts of aggression. There is ample evidence that this
right can be exercised. It will be, if the illegal occupation of
Kuwait continues.''
   The foreign ministers of all but Cuba and the Ivory Coast
attended.
   Beside the five permanent members with veto power, the council
includes Canada, Colombia, Cuba, Ethiopia, Finland, Ivory Coast,
Malaysia, Romania, Yemen and Zaire.

<HEAD>Chancellor to Propose Condom Distribution in High Schools</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The schools chancellor is preparing a plan to
distribute condoms to students through health clinics in 20 junior
high and high schools, a city official said Tuesday.
   ``We see this as an effective preventive measure for pregnancy
and in slowing the spread of AIDS,'' said Carmen Rivera, director
of the mayor's office of health policy. ``We see both these things
as in crisis proportions in certain communities.''
   A spokesman for Chancellor Joseph Fernandez said the plan was
still being formed.
   But Ms. Rivera said the condoms would be distributed through the
20 clinics, which also offer examinations and other services to
tens of thousands of students.
   The school system briefly distributed condoms through the
clinics in 1986, but stopped the program because of opposition from
several Board of Education members.
   The school clinics referred students seeking contraceptives to
private physicians and other clinics.
   Ms. Rivera said most of the seven school board members now
support the plan.
   James Vlasto, the chancellor's spokesman, said Fernandez had
asked the city health commissioner, Dr. Woodrow Myers, to speak to
the board Wednesday on health issues of young people.
   ``The proposal has to come from the chancellor, but it has to be
a cooperative effort,'' Vlasto said.

   National Guardsman Felipe Cardenas II
soon will arrive in the Saudi Arabian desert, and one of his first
orders of businesss will be to find a familiar face - his son.
   Felipe's 19-year-old son, Phillip Cardenas III, has been
stationed in the desert for three weeks with the Army's 101st
Airborne Division.
   Cardenas, 41, a National Guardman for 17 years and a Vietnam War
veteran, said he learned this week that volunteers from his unit
will soon be leaving for the Middle East.
   The elder Cardenas went to Vietnam at age 18. He now serves as a
staff sergeant in the Longmont tank unit of the Army National
Guard.
   His son, an infantryman, has been in the Army a little more than
a year. Like his father, he shipped out to face possible combat
while still a teen-ager.
   ``Of course I worry about him, but I know that the Army prepares
people, just like theydid me,'' Cardenas said.
   He hopes he can find his son in Saudi Arabia, although there are
thousands of other U.S. service men and women stationed there in
reaction to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in early August.
   ``I know if we go to battle, I'll probably be in front of him,''
he said. ``The tanks will cross the front line ahead of the
infantry.''

<TEXT>
   A civil rights lawsuit was filed Tuesday
against the Sheriff's Department on behalf of 75 people who
allegedly were victims of brutality or racial harassment by
deputies at one sheriff's station.
   The suit claims more than 40 incidents, including two killings,
as well as beatings, chokings and use of racial epithets, said
Patrick Patterson of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, a nonprofit
civil rights law firm.
   All but one incident occurred within a three-month period this
year and all but two involved either a black or Hispanic person,
Patterson said.
   The Sheriff's Information Bureau declined to respond on behalf
of Sheriff Sherman Block.
   The U.S. District Court suit named the Sheriff's Department,
Block, Los Angeles County, the city of Lynwood, where the station
is located, sheriff's Capt. Bert Cueva, the commander of the
Lynwood station, state Attorney General John Van de Kamp and
District Attorney Ira Reiner.
   The suit seeks damages for the plaintiffs but doesn't state a
sum.
   ``The point of this lawsuit is to recompense the individual
plaintiffs for their injuries and damages, but each of them is
aware the point is also to change a very bad situation,'' said
George V. Denny III, the lead attorney.
   The NAACP Legal Defense Fund is unaffiliated with the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People. It retains the
initials because of an affiliation that ended in the 1950s.
   The Lynwood station is one of 17 stations which serve
unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County or cities which contract
with the Sheriff's Department for police services.
   The lawsuit seeks a permanent injunction against the defendants
to stop the alleged abuses, and appointment of a receiver or
special master for the Lynwood station.
   The city of Lynwood, 10 miles south of Los Angeles, has about
54,000 citizens. The city is about 43 percent Hispanic, 34 percent
black and 19 percent white.
   One allegation of the lawsuit was that a motorist, William
Leonard, was ordered out of his car on Feb. 10 by deputies who
thought he was armed and then shot more than 30 times by 12 or more
deputies standing in a half-circle around him as he tried to kneel
down with his hands behind his head.
   Another incident included in the lawsuit occurred the next day,
Feb. 11. Lloyd Polk purportedly fled from two deputies because of
outstanding warrants for minor infractions. When he was caught,
deputies allegedly beat him with batons, kicked him for 10 minutes
and broke both his arms. He was then arrested for assaulting a
deputy with a board.

   South African President F.W. de Klerk's
official visit to Washington is stirring protests from
anti-apartheid activists, but some black members of Congress are
joining colleagues to meet with him today.
   ``Our view is that (de Klerk) has not earned a trip to the Oval
Office,'' Randall Robinson, head of the TransAfrica group that has
led U.S. protests against apartheid, said Monday.
   ``President Bush has made a large mistake and has offended
freedom-loving people around the world and in the United States by
becoming the first president since apartheid was codified in 1948
to invite into the Oval Office the head of a country that practices
repression in an unprecedented way,'' Robinson said.
   Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., chairman of the Congressional Black
Caucus, said the 24-member group canceled its plans to meet with de
Klerk out of concern the session would be misinterpreted and could
lend symbolic support to the apartheid regime. Dellums joined
Robinson and other activists outside the White House gates to
protest Bush's meeting with de Klerk on Monday.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush says he's ``not going to yield
one inch'' to Saddam Hussein and won't be distracted by the Iraqi
leader's efforts to link the Persian Gulf crisis with the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
   Bush said he appreciates concerns of U.S. partners in the region
over economic hardships, food shortages and the continuing
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
   But he told a group of Arab-American business leaders at the
White House on Monday there will be ``no, no, no negotiation'' with
Iraq until it fully withdraws from Kuwait.
   Bush encountered some sharp questioning on Monday after he
finished prepared remarks to about 150 representatives of
Arab-American groups - including one from a participant who told
him that ``as Moslems, we object to Saudi Arabia inviting the
foreign troops to our land.''

   Automakers are showing little or no gain in
fuel economy for the fifth straight year, with 1991 model cars
having on average as much thirst at the gas pumps as they did in
1987, the government reported today.
   The Environmental Protection Agency released the new fuel
economy figures as the Senate considered legislation that would
require sharp improvements in automobile fuel efficiency over the
next decade.
   According to the EPA's annual fuel economy statistics covering
about 1,000 cars, the 1991 models - both domestics and imports -
show an overall average of 28.1 miles per gallon, slightly better
than last year and identical to the fleet average in 1987.
   While the most miserly cars such as the minicompact Geo Metro
attain more than 50 mpg, more than half of the cars on the list
achieved no better than 22 mpg. The increasingly popular passenger
vans and specialty vehicles could on average do no better than the
high teens.

contentedly without any country's oil if it only would harness the
wind.
   The American Wind Energy Association brought together 300
engineers, consultants, manufacturers, scientists - and visionaries
- to discuss the possibilities of using wind power to produce a
substantial percentage of the nation's electricity.
   Today the wind generates only a trifling fraction of the
nation's power.
   More than 15,000 wind turbines are in commercial use in

   BALTIMORE (AP) - Using newly released Soviet documents on
400,000 of Hitler's victims, a new Red Cross clearinghouse is
offering to help people track the fates of loved ones sent to labor
or death camps by the Nazis.
   The center opened here Monday to process a flood of expected
requests for access to the records in West Germany that the Soviets
began releasing last year. Soviet soldiers recovered the documents
when the camps were liberated at the close of World War II.
   Emmy Hubert Mogilensky, the daughter of Holocaust victims, said
at the opening of the Holocaust and War Victims Tracing and
Information Center that she sympathizes with relatives who still
don't know the fate of loved ones.
   The 67-year-old woman said she grieved with her brother when the
Red Cross sent them a message in 1946 saying their parents died in
a Nazi concentration camp. As time passed, she said the letter
became a ``comfort, a closure.''

   An Israeli soldier stares through binoculars to
penetrate the privacy of a Palestinian home. He sees laundry
billowing in the breeze, falls secretly in love with a young
Palestinian woman and witnesses a tragic explosion.
   In the scenes from the new movie ``Lookout,'' the soldier is
largely passive. Director Dina Zvi Riklis says her intent was to
shake Israelis out of their complacency about the 31-month
Palestinian uprising.
   The film, the latest in a series of Israeli movies on the
Palestinian conflict, won the Golden Dove Award as the best short
film at this summer's Jerusalem film festival.
   It starts with an anonymous soldier in a lookout post above a
neighborhood in the occupied Gaza Strip. He twists a radio's dial
to the station whose Hebrew news and chatter, along with American
and Israeli rock music, will be almost the only sound for the
film's 28 minutes.
   Riklis' camera shows the life of a Palestinian family through
the eyes of the brown-haired reservist in his late 20s.
   He sees a Palestinian father builds a pigeon coop atop his roof,
and his son sets free the birds. On the street, two soldiers
confiscate a soccer ball from Palestinian boys.
   As the soldier looks down on the dusty streets in Gaza, the
radio deejay brightly announces, ``A day on the Mediterranean. We
love the weather here.''
   The soldier's glance is drawn across the street to an old Arab
house built of stones with arched windows. A 7-year-old boy lives
there and his teen-age sister, innocent and stunningly beautiful.
   The girl knows she is being watched and seductively lingers near
her window. In his only descent from the lookout post, the soldier
walks by the house and encounters the girl. They stare into each
other's eyes but do not speak.
   When the girl marries a Palestinian activist, she changes. Her
dark, lush hair is covered by a scarf in Moslem fashion. The
husband closes the bedroom window shutters, blocking the soldier's
view.
   In the living room, the family watches a television news report
showing troops savagely beating Arabs. A youth unfurls a
Palestinian flag.
   The soldiers sees the family's life, but his only line in the
movie, ``I didn't see anything,'' comes as troops raid the house
and arrest the woman's father.
   In the gripping climax, the woman's husband sends her brother to
deliver a package to the father as he returns from a military
lockup. An army patrol appears, and the boy hurriedly tosses aside
the package. It explodes. The boy dies before his father's eyes.
   Now the lookout's passivity ends. He stares at the boy's limp
body, raises his rifle and kills the young husband.
   In an eerie epilogue, the Palestinian woman paces her porch
months later singing to her newborn child, still watched by a
lookout. But the reservist is gone. A different, wide-eyed soldier
gazes on.
   For Israelis, Riklis' film presents the unfamiliar world of
Palestinians in the Gaza Strip juxtaposed with the familiar chatter
of an Israeli radio show.
   ``Radio is almost the second voice of the nation. It is still
not a medium of entertainment here, but taken very seriously,''
said deejay Dori Ben-Zeev, whose show was on the soundtrack.
   ``What the soldier sees is a story,'' Riklis said. ``What he
hears on the radio is reality. I wanted to take a difficult
situation and hit the audience with our indifference. The events
(in the territories) are the same, only we get used to hearing them
and they don't phase us anymore.''
   The film is more a mix of documentary with drama than two recent
Israeli films that focus on relations with Palestinians.
   ``Green Fields,'' winner of the feature-film award at the 1989
Jerusalem festival, follows an Israeli family on a destructive
journey in the West Bank. ``One of Ours,'' Israel's entry in this
year's Academy Awards, is about the slaying of a Palestinian
prisoner.
   The stars of ``Lookout'' are both young Israelis, Uri
Ram-Klausner plays the soldier and Esti Yerushalmi is the
Palestinian girl. The supporting cast is made up of Israeli Arabs
from Jaffa, where the film was shot.
   Riklis got the idea for the film more than two years ago when
the Palestinian uprising was just starting, but it took time to
raise the money for the film.
   ``Unfortunately,'' she said, ``the issue has remained
relevant.''

<HEAD>Steve Allen Brings the Golden Age of TV to HA! The TV Comedy
Channel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thanks to Steve Allen, an entire generation soon
will learn that the idea of hot, young comedians doing live, hip,
sketch comedy on a TV variety show is older than NBC's ``Saturday
Night Live.''
   At last, another generation can wonder whether there's a fern in
its creel. On Oct. 1, Ha! The TV Comedy Network, debuts the first
of 100 half-hours from ``The Steve Allen Show,'' a live, weekly
variety show that ran head-to-head against ``The Ed Sullivan Show''
on Sunday nights from 1956 to 1959.
   Elvis Presley made his TV debut on the Allen show, but the
program was known more for its daft, inspired comedy by a troupe of
brilliant comics that included Don Knotts, Louis Nye, Tom Poston,
Pat Harrington and Allen himself.
   ``We all had a kind of vibration of mutual craziness and
creativity that first of all made our work pleasurable and,
secondly, very effective,'' Allen said.
   The show was a jumping-off point for pop culture. Allen's
wordplay with the band (``Smock! Smock! Smock!'') and the cast's
doubletalk (``How's your fern?'') on Sunday night would echo in
schools and businesses on Monday.
   For the record, Allen said, he does not have a fern in his
creel.
   ``Well, I had it removed several years ago,'' Allen said, ``but
it didn't hurt much.''
   Barump-bump!
   ``When the Sunday show started, there were just three of us
writing it: Stan Burns, Herb Sargent and myself,'' Allen said.
``Today, a show like that would have literally 22 or 23 writers.
   ``In four or five days, we were putting together each week
something that was literally on the level of a Broadway musical
comedy revue,'' he said. ``And yet we were so young and energetic
and having such great fun, we never even thought to complain about
it.
   ``Believe it or not, we were having such fun with it, we never
looked upon it as a burden. It was hard work, oh yeah, but we loved
it.''
   Allen, 67, is the author of 35 books - three of them coming out
this year - and he's still one of America's most prolific popular
music composers.
   The Ha! shows came from his own collection.
   ``I was saving them for my great-grandchildren, should they ever
be curious as to what I did,'' he said, ``but a combination of
economic and cultural factors has created a vacuum, a market, for
the good comedy of that 1950 period.''
   The underlying sociological fact, Allen said, is that today's
generation is the first in human history to have been exposed to
comedy since birth.
   Children are ``literally hearing group laughter and the verbal
cues that occasion it as part of their early exposure to human
language of any sort,'' he said.
   ``I think this must have something to do with the fact that when
they get to be 5 and 6 and a little more discriminating, they all
expect comedy.''
   In an essay Allen wrote back in the '50s for The Atlantic
Monthly, he remembers observing that there were only 50 comedians
in show business.
   ``Just think: The whole funny business . . . was being taken
care of by a little group that you could have fit on a school
bus,'' he said. ``Now we have over 2,000. That's an explosive,
mushrooming growth.
   ``Many of today's comedy performers are funnier than the
old-timers - no names of the old-timers - but that is not the
problem. What is highly objectionable now . . . is the degree to
which wit, which was once characteristic of American comedy, is
being replaced by shock vulgarity.''
   Vulgarity is creeping into TV comedy as well, Allen said.
Viewers, he said, should try to induce a sense of guilt or shame in
television executives who either are permitting or demanding
shock-vulgar TV shows.
   ``Even if it turned out that those who say `Hey, don't knock it,
it's the way to get ratings' were right, they still should be
discouraged,'' Allen said.
   ``Somebody should still say to them, `Does the condition of the
national consciousness mean nothing to you? Is it all dollars and
cents?' ''

<HEAD>A Woman's Perspective: Reporting in Male-Dominated Saudi Arabia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women reporters covering the U.S.
military buildup in male-dominated Saudi Arabia exulted when the
invitation came to join female soldiers in their exercise classes.
Exclusive! We gloated.
   But the chance to swim and sweat with the U.S. women in uniform
nearly backfired when the three reporters - myself included -
walked through the front door of the $80 million gymnasium at a
Saudi air base.
   Several Saudi custodians, all men, leapt up and followed us to
the registration desk, complaining loudly that we had violated
custom by using the front entrance. Women, they said, must enter
through the rear door.
   Our timing, it appeared, couldn't have been worse: we had
committed this faux pas on a Friday - Islam's holy day - during
Moslem prayer time.
   The Saudis were not the only ones who were annoyed.
   `You nearly ruined it for all of us,'' one angry Air Force nurse
told the sheepish reporters. ``They almost kicked us out.''
   The military women had fought hard for the privilege of using
the gym three times a week, and they dreaded the idea of losing it.
   The culture clash was an example of the hidden challenges that
American women encountered in Saudi Arabia, a country where females
don't vote, don't drive, don't go out in public without covering
their faces and heads with veils, don't socialize in meeting places
and rarely hold jobs that bring them in contact with the general
public.
   Most Saudi women seem to accept the social structure that is
based on the laws of Islam. They say they are put on a pedestal in
their homes and treated generously by their men.
   The female reporters - writers, television and radio
correspondents, photographers and television camera crews - have
been treated fairly by both Saudi and American officials in terms
of access to events and opportunities to cover the U.S.-led
military deployment.
   We have slept on cots in the desert with the 82nd Airborne out
of Fort Bragg, N.C. We have visited Egyptian paratroopers near the
Saudi-Kuwaiti border; interviewed the powerful Saudi petroleum
minister; and toured the strategic petroleum refinery at Ras
Tanura.
   In deference to Saudi custom, we cover our arms, wear longer
skirts and keep bare skin to a minimum. But none of us wear the
black cloaks known as abayas or head coverings. The heat argues
against wearing stockings.
   We act generally as we do in the United States: eating in
restaurants, sipping coffee in the hotel lobbies. But we remain
oddities on the social scene, the only women attending an Arabian
nights dinner under a big tent hosted by Saudi prince, for example.
   We were warned about the muttawa, the so-called religious police
who enforce the Islamic dress code and insist conservative
standards are upheld. But an informal survey indicated none of the
reporters has been accosted by the muttawa, who have the power to
make arrests.
   On the streets or in the souks (markets), our small cadre of
female reporters has grown accustomed to sares from curious
Saudis, but the incredulous looks did not interfere with work.
   The major complaint - and the biggest frustration - is the ban
on driving. We must hire taxis, drivers or rely on male colleagues
to ferry us around, an expensive inconvenience in a country with a
modern system of interstate highways. The U.S. Embassy also advised
women not to sit next to a man to whom she was not married.
   In one case, I drove to a remote post on the Saudi-Kuwaiti
border with a male colleague, 300 miles from the coastal city of
Dhahran, to meet with the governor of the province. The trip would
have been impossible without a male escort.
   Air travel was potentially a problem because Saudi custom
dictates women must be accompanied by a male relative. Expatriate
women have to obtain a letter approving their travel from their
sponsoring company. Airports have check-in lines designated for
``males'' and ``families.''
   Saudi officials seemed to ignore the rules for the foreign
reporters. I was never asked about my marital status, for instance,
when I flew to Riyadh, the Saudi capital, in the company of an
American male reporter.
   Female reporters benefit from the famed Saudi hospitality and
generosity. When one reporter mentioned she had lost a contact
lens, her host insisted on having his driver take her the next day
to the clinic for a replacement.
   At Prince Mohammed Bin Fahd's daily Majlis - a combination of a
town meeting and a magistrate's court - Saudi citizens ask the
governor of the Eastern Province to resolve problems ranging from
land disputes to homelessness.
   After meeting the prince, I jokingly told himII had some
problems he could solve. Pressed on what theywere, I assured him I
was only kidding.
   That night, I received a call from the prince's worried press
officer. ``You mentioned you had some problems and the prince
wanted to know if there was anything he could do,'' the press
officer said.
   ``A car to take you shopping? Some interviews? Anything?''

<HEAD>Islamics in Algeria Dominate Arab Country's Rush to Democracy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This capital now boils with political
activity as Algeria undertakes an Arab-style transition toward
democracy.
   One question dominates: will free elections in this North
African country replace a Marxist-style dictatorship with an
Islamic one?
   The potent brew of politics and religion bubbles to life each
evening in the Casbah, where bearded young men sip mint tea and
dissect democracy and the Koran in a capital long derided as
``Moscow on the Med.''
   ``Vive FIS'' (``Long Live The Islamic Salvation Front'') reads
the graffiti on the Ketchaoua mosque, a bastion of Algeria's most
potent political movement.
   ``This is a Moslem country,'' said Ali Hamidouche, 32. ``It's
only natural that people would want a Moslem government.''
   The 28 political parties and lively free press born since
constitutional rforms in 1989 contrast sharply with an Arab world
ruled by monarchs, dictators and one-party states.
   But vows by Islamic councils elected last June to impose Koranic
law fuel fears that the democratic experiment may be short.
   ``If the FIS wins, we're dead,'' a leading women's rights
activist said.
   The Islamic Salvation Front took control of more than half the
country's municipal and regional councils June 12 in Algeria's
first free elections since independence from France in 1962.
   The verdict repudiated the ruling National Liberation Front
(FLN) and its 28-year monopoly on power.
   But local councils hold little power. The fundamentalists cannot
effect changes while the FLN holds all seats in the National
Assembly.
   Their complaints forced President Chadli Bendjedid to move
legislative elections ahead a year to next spring.
   ``No matter who wins, the first success of these elections will
be stability and legitimacy for the National Assembly,'' FIS leader
Abassi Madani said in a recent newspaper interview.
   The 59-year-old philosophy professor presents the moderate face
of a movement encompassing classical scholars and pro-Iranian
radicals.
   His alter ego is Ali Belhadj, 31, whose fiery speeches attract
thousands. He blames ``infidels'' - France chief among them - for
Algeria's woes.
   For the young men outside the Ketchaoua mosque, the FIS heralds
an end to the Soviet-inspired system the National Liberation Front
imposed on Algeria, one of the continent's largest countries and
situated on the Mediterranean.
   The fundamentalists' message is clear: the old regime was
corrupt. It brought poverty and unemployment. An Islamic regime
will stop corruption and, thereby, social problems.
   The FIS vows to end to secular practices that let men and women
mingle at school and work.
   ``For us, secularism means liberty from God,'' Hamidouche said
with a grimace.
   Ranged against the fundamentalists are dozens of political
groupings, but only a handful with significant support.
   The FLN remains the best organized. Thousands of its adherents
run the public sector to which most Algerians owe their livelihood.
   But the FLN managed only to win a quarter of the June vote.
   ``They'll be lucky to keep 25 percent next time,'' a Western
diplomat said. ``People are fed up, and they've thrown up no young,
charismatic leader.''
   The oppostion includes the liberal Rally for Culture and
Democracy, the centrist Front for Socialist Forces and the populist
Movement for Democracy in Algeria.
   The Rally received a boost when the other two parties boycotted
the June voting, claiming the FLN would rig the results. Their
leaders are heroes of the war for independence - Berber chief
Hocine Ait Ahmed and Algeria's first president, Ahmed Ben Bella.
   Ben Bella, 73, is the man Algerians are watching. He hopes to
weld a ``democratic consensus'' to lead the country out of its
economic ills.
   Ben Bella's stature is unrivaled by any living Algerian. He
planned the 1954 uprising against France and ruled three years
after independence until toppled in a military coup.
   Half his life has been spent in exile or prison. He currently
lives in Geneva though a return to Algiers is considered imminent.
   ``They never broke him,'' said Hocine Guermouche, spokesman for
the Movement for Democracy in Algeria.
   ``You've seen Mandela. He spent 27 years in prison and never
lost his spirit. Ben Bella has done more ... he won the war.''
   But he also gave Algeria ills it is only now shaking off: secret
police, a single-party system, a Marxist economy.
   Whoever wins next year's elections will struggle to revive the
sagging economy.
   In October 1988, thousands of Algerians rioted over living
standards that plummeted along with prices for the country's chief
export, oil.
   Scores of people, including many fundamentalists, died when the
army crushed the uprising. The deaths robbed the FLN of popular
legitimacy.
   Bendjedid, whose term expires in 1993, distanced the government
from the FLN and drafted last year's constitutional reforms. He
appointed technocrats to impose market economics.
   No party seems likely to meddle with the privatization program.
But the pace of economic change remains slow.
   Unemployment officially stands at 25 percent. Families of 12
often live in two-room apartments. The government estimates 800,000
new dwellings are needed.
   Long lines form at shops often empty of basic foodstuffs.
Jobless young men survive by hawking black-market cigarettes.
Strikes proliferate.
   As the meuzzin at Ketchaoua mosque called the faithful to
prayer, one young man said lots of political parties are fine, as
long as they adhere to Islam.
   ``If the people vote for the FIS, fine. If they vote for ...
some other party and they win, that's good, too,'' said Boumari
Nacer Edde, a Casbah candy seller.
   ``The important thing is that there's democracy. We want
democracy.''

<TEXT>
   It was 11:30 a.m. when rude laughter and the
whoosh of rushingwater sundered Deborah Terrell's algebra lesson.
   The odds against the lesson already were high enough for Ms.
Terrell and her 19 eighth-graders at Burnet Street Elementary
School, a magnet school where 200 of 500 children are homeless.
   This day, like most Ms. Terrell has spent here for the last
decade, would be a melange of frustration, fatigue, self-doubt and,
perhaps, a small victory or two.
   But as she spoke of equations, a former student in a prankish
mood gleefully sprayed the glass in her classroom door with jets
from the hallway fire extinguishers.
   ``See that?'' she said, pointing angrily to the truant. ``This
is fun? What kind of life is that?''
   Later that day, as if sent to restore her faith, a second
visitor dropped in: Tawana Woolridge, a prim, polite 12th-grader at
Newark's tough Central High whom Ms. Terrell had taught five years
earlier.
   ``She was my favorite teacher,'' Tawana said. ``She wasn't too
strict, but she didn't let you get away with anything, either.''
   ``When one kid like that comes back and is making it, that's
what makes it all worthwhile,'' said the teacher.
   ---
   3 p.m. at last.
   Most of the students leaving Room 303 headed for Baxter Terrace
or other downtown Newark housing projects. Three caught buses for
homeless shelters at the Lincoln or Carlton Hotels.
   Ms. Terrell slumped back in her chair, exhausted.
   She hadn't always wanted to be a teacher. She studied psychology
at Rutgers University but quickly lost her taste for it after an
internship at a mental health center: ``Too depressing.''
   ``When I went to school, everyone wanted to be a teacher. I came
here to Burnet to do my student teaching. The seventh-grade teacher
left one day, and the principal just gave me her class. The rest is
history.''
   At age 36, her chosen career now earns her about $33,000 a year.
   ``I don't see myself here for another 10 years. But I guess I
wonder: if I leave, who's going to be here for these kids?''
   Later, back home in her neat, wood-frame house on a
tough-looking downtown Newark street, she'd make sure her sons
Malcolm, 8, and Toussaint, 9, buckled down to homework, as her own
mother once had for her.
   But now, as the last pupil straggled out, she needed to
decompress.
   ``I have to wind down before I can see my kids,'' she said. ``If
I don't take half an hour to wind down, I might take things out on
them.''
   After dinner, homework awaited - grading neatly bound projects
her students had prepared on the evils of drugs to mark National
Drug Awareness Month. Then she planned to phone parents to exhort
them to attend open school night.
   She wondered aloud: ``Am I just speaking to the air? Did anyone
learn anything today?''
   She thought.
   ``Well, I know Murad learned something.''
   Murad, a bright, cocky, reed-thin boy, is quick with excuses and
short on study habits. Ms. Terrell had forced him to sit in a desk
alongside hers, a spot known in her class as ``Out of Society.''
   But today Murad actually had taken notes in class and used them
to solve a math problem.
   A small victory.
   And Ronald. A big day for him, too. Quiet, withdrawn, homeless
for the last year, Ronald had stood up for the first time and given
an oral presentation. The class had applauded. Ronald had smiled
shyly.
   Another victory.
   Victories come hard at Burnet Street, designated four years ago
a magnet school for homeless children in kindergarten through
eighth-grade. Only last year did the board of education add staff
and resources to help the school accommodate this most troubled
population. Teachers say they have yet to get any formal training
on how to deal with them.
   ``Kids wre sleeping on desks, had to meet bus schedules, had to
make stops at the grocery stores,'' Ms. Terrell said.
   Average daily attendance at Burnet Street is just 87.6 percent;
the national average is more than 92 percent. Twenty percent at
Burnet need special help with basic skills, and 15 percent have
been held back a grade or more. Only 5 percent of parents
participate in school activities, according to New Jersey state
statistics.
   For Ms. Terrell, teaching is a daily gantlet of delays,
interruptions, excuses.
   The PA system squawks messages. The bell rings every 45 minutes.
   In the space of a morning, the attendance teacher knocks on the
door to take roll. Four Hispanic students get pulled out of class
for special English classes. Eight others are summoned for remedial
classes to boost low English and math test scores. Still another
group goes for computer instruction. In the afternoon, Ms.
Terrell's homeless students are called away early to catch buses to
shelters.
   And then there are the excuses.
   A kid tells her she didn't do her homework because ``I left the
book in school, OK?''
   At that, Ms. Terrell's mouth twists upward in a streetwise curl
that says without words: You think I haven't heard that nonsense a
thousand times before? You think you're kidding me? I was raised in
the same streets you were.
   ``No,'' she finally says. ``That's not OK. You know how I feel
about excuses and that's not even a good one. And get rid of the
gum!''
   She has a way of mixing humor, affection and discipline. On her
desk is a small sign: ``U toucha My Desk, I breaka U face!''
Sometimes she'll say with a hint of a smile: ``You know how
un-rational I am.''
   How do the kids feel about her?
   Defiant. Yet dependent. She sometimes invites her students to
write what they think, without signing their papers. They write her
things they wouldn't tell their parents: about drugs, AIDS, their
neighborhoods, being homeless.
   ---
   Her kids say Ms. Terrell sometimes gets teary during her ``life
lectures,'' when she speaks about what she wants for them, why
she's there.
   One such talk comes minutes after the class's standardized state
test scores arrive.
   The 7th grade scores, the ones her kids took the spring before,
show only 28 percent testing above average in math - the lowest
passing rate in the school by far.
   ``Oh brother,'' she says. ``We're the lowest on the list.
   ``Everyone has so much time to talk and play, talk and play.
What bothers me is I know you can do better. These scores are
garbage. That's a reflection on me. Whatever I have to do to get
this up, I will do.
   ``You always should expect to do the best for yourself. There's
too much potential in this room. I'm just here to help you. But you
have to help me help you. You already have the strikes against you.
You're minorities, blacks, Puerto Ricans. So people look at these
scores and say, `What did you expect?'
   ``I know where you belong, and I want to take you. I certainly
don't want any of you in here next year shooting fire extinguishers
at the window.''

   Nearly 40 percent of the nation's minority students and about 30
percent of its poor children are educated in large, urban school
districts, according to data collected by the Council of Great City
Schools.
   About 11 percent, or 4.5 million U.S. schoolchildren, attend
school in the nation's 37 largest urban districts, according to the
council.
   Urban districts with the biggest enrollments are New York,
940,000; Los Angeles, 592,000; Chicago, 394,000; Miami-Dade County,
Fla., 268,000; Philadelphia, 191,000; Houston, 190,000; Detroit,
174,000; Dallas, 131,000; San Diego, 117,000; Baltimore, 107,000,
and Memphis, Tenn., 106,000.
   The families of nearly 1.5 million urban schoolchildren are
below the poverty line; 408,000 are enrolled in classes for the
handicapped; 293,000 have limited English proficiency.
   Forty-five percent are black, 26 percent white, 23 percent
Hispanic, and 5 percent Asian.
   Daily attendance averages 94 percent in urban elementary
schools, 91 percent in middle schools and 87.6 percent in high
schools. The national average for all schools is 92 percent.
   Excluding federal funds and capital spending, Pittsburgh spent
the most per pupil among the 50 largest school districts: $7,163,
according to 1988-89 data from the American Federation of Teachers,
the latest comparable statistics available. Memphis, Tenn., at
$2,521, spent the least. The 50-district average was $4,365.
   Average class size in the the 50 largest U.S. districts is about
17 students, compared with the 17.4 average for the entire nation,
according to AFT statistics.
   Newark, N.J., had the best pupil-teacher ratio, 11.5, followed
by St. Louis, 12.4, Boston, 12.6, Baltimore County, 13.5,
Pittsburgh, 14.0, Orange County (Orlando) Fla., 14.5, Denver, 14.5,
and Columbus, Ohio, 14.5. Los Angeles had the most crowded classes
among the 50 largest districts, with a student-teacher ratio of 24.
   Some 203,000 teachers work in inner-city schools.
   Among urban districts with settled contracts in 1990-91,
Philadelphia teachers earn from $24,000 to $49,600; Newark
teachers, $23,867 to $50,757; Minneapolis teachers, $22,192 to
$47,273; Cincinnati teachers, $21,679 to $44,847; Baltimore
teachers, $22,162 to $43,002; and Dade County, Fla., teachers,
$26,500 to $49,400.

<HEAD>450 Years Later, El Greco's Hometown Celebrates the Artist</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NIKOS KONSTANDARAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>IRAKLION, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   El Greco's hometown is holding its first
major exhibit of paintings by its most famous son, celebrating his
450th birthday a year early.
   Domenicos Theotocopoulos, as the artist was born and as he
signed his work, is represented by 30 paintings, five early
Byzantine icons and by a wealth of documents and books illuminating
his life.
   He died in Toledo, Spain, in 1614. It was there that the
visionary artist became known as El Greco - the Greek - and created
his mannerist masterpieces.
   His flamelike lines, brightly lighted figures and elongated,
distorted forms depicting religious ecstasy and ascetic nobility
have been brought to his hometown on Crete for the first time ever.
They are on display at the Basilica of St. Mark.
   Although it is believed that Theotocopoulos was born in 1541,
Iraklion held his 450th anniversary a year early.
   ``We guessed that next year major museums will be holding their
own exhibitions and we wouldn't be able to get any paintings. We
wanted to get in first,'' said Nicos Hadjinicolaou, professor of
art history at the University of Crete, who spent two years
organizing the exhibition.
   For Cretans, the exhibition of El Greco's work and life has
become a source of pride, with over 2,500 people flocking to it
each day since it opened Sept. 1. It runs until Oct. 10.
   A five-day international congress on his life and work pointed
out the Greek and Byzantine influences in El Greco's work and
illuminated aspects of his life in Crete.
   Iraklion was a busy port called Candia controlled by the
Venetian republic when Theotocopoulos left in about 1570 to study
under Titian in Italy.
   The town does not own a single painting by its most famous son.
But it certainly remembers him. Overlooking the basilica square in
which a large crowd gathered for the exhibition's inauguration is
the huge neon sign of the El Greco Hotel. Further away is the
Theotocopoulos Hotel.
   ``The atmosphere at the exhibition is very interesting. We see
people here who have never been to an exhibition,'' said
Hadjinicolaou in an interview.
   ``It is a symbolic honor by us to a young artist who lived and
worked here ... before making a great career abroad. We owe it to
honor someone who honors us,'' he said.
   The costs were borne by private donors and the municipality in
this town of about 100,000 people. Hadjinicolaou would not specify
what they were.
   When the carefully wrapped paintings began arriving from museums
in Washington and Leningrad, crowds gathered and applauded every
time a crate was lowered from a truck.
   Irene Florou, a historian at the Athens School of Fine Arts,
believes that the exhibition could inspire Cretans and remind them
of the flowering of art and literature the island experienced in
the 16th and 17th centuries.
   At that time, painters such as Theotocopoulos and Mihalis
Damaskinos picked up the Byzantine tradition. Writers such as
Vincenzios Kornaros and Giorgos Hortatzis wrote Venetian-inspired
epics that are sung to this day in the distinctive Cretan dialect
in remote villages.
   ``This exhibition creates a counterbalance to the general
climate of the time,'' Florou said in an interview. ``People will
be reminded that there is more to life than buying cars and
building hotels. They will remember the arts that they carry about
inside them.''
   Crete is currently enjoying an unprecedented economic boom, with
high European Community subsidies for agriculture and construction
of hotels touting the Mediterranean island's beauty.
   Hadjinicolaou says that the town hopes to find a way to gather
850,000 pounds ($1.6 million) to buy El Greco's ``View of Mount
Sinai and the Monastery of St. Catherine,'' currently in a private
collection in Vienna.
   ``Fortunately, both candidates for mayor in the (October)
municipal elections support our effort,'' he said.
   The first major congress on El Greco was held in Toledo in 1982.
No Greeks were invited to it and there was no mention of the Greek
side of his life and work. The second such gathering was held at
Iraklion's harbor fortress last month.
   ``This was a small reply to their `El Greco of Toledo.' Our
catalog is called `El Greco of Crete.' A quarter of the speeches
concerned El Greco's Cretan period,'' Hadjinicolaou said.
   Most of El Greco's work in Crete was on icons.
   One of the major results of the congress was that participants
appeared to have accepted the authenticity of an icon found on the
Aegean island of Syros bearing Domenicos Theotocopoulos' signature.
It was discovered in 1983 and would have been painted when the
artist was in his early 20s.

<HEAD>Judas Priest Says They Were Scapegoats in Unnecessary Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNE M. PETERSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the heavy metal band Judas Priest
would like to put the recent past behind them, but they're not
about to change their tune.
   The band is recovering from a recent Nevada court battle, which
questioned whether subliminal messages exist on their 1978 album,
``Stained Class,'' and ultimately prompted two young men to enter a
suicide pact.
   Lead singer Rob Halford and guitarist Glenn Tipton said their
court victory, clearing them of deliberately placing the subliminal
messages on the album, was bittersweet. But they're not about to
quit making the music they've been driven to make for the past 16
years.
   ``We won't back down to that kind of legal terrorism,'' said
Tipton. The Priest's new hard-driving album, ``Painkiller,'' and
upcoming tour demonstrate their tenacity.
   The band was cleared on Aug. 24 by Washoe County District Court
Judge Jerry Carr, who ruled the plaintiffs' alleged subliminal
message ``do it'' on the song ``Better by You, Better Than Me,''
was an unintentional exhalation of breath and a drum beat.
   ``We were fighting a case on an issue based on something that
doesn't exist. We had to sit in court while they were discussing
Freudian theories on subconscious levels and whether the
subconscious mind could pick up sub-audible signals and act upon
it,'' said Tipton. ``We had to sit through that when all the time
we wanted to just stand up and say, `But there are no messages!' ''
   Raymond Belknap, 18, died from a self-inflicted shotgun blast to
the face on Dec. 23, 1985. James Vance, then 20, shot himself also.
He lived but suffered horrible facial disfigurement, and died in
1988 of complications from his injuries and a reaction to
medications. Both had listened to ``Stained Class'' before making
the suicide pact.
   Their families sued Judas Priest and CBS Records for $6.2
million in damages, claiming the subliminal messages were on the
album and influenced their sons' actions.
   Defense lawyers, however, countered that the youths came from
troubled homes and had been drinking and smoking marijuana that
day.
   The judge did order CBS Records to pay the plaintiffs $40,000
for refusing to comply with discovery orders involving the original
master tape of the album.
   Both Halford and Tipton, recently in New York before three weeks
of rest in England and Spain, said they were sorry the young men
died, but the band was the unnecessary scapegoat for the tragedy.
   ``People try and shoulder the burden of guilt on any one else's
shoulders. They should look a little closer to home for the real
issues and the real reasons that cause incidents like this,''
Tipton said.
   Halford added that it was ridiculous to place the blame on the
band or the music. He said at times during the court battle he felt
it was heavy metal on trial, not just Judas Priest.
   ``There's absolutely never been, and never will ever be, any
scientific proof evidential that heavy metal music, or any kind of
music, can physically make somebody to do something, or change, or
be someone else.''
   So-called ``backward-masking,'' or conveying a subliminal
message by recording it backward, also became a well-publicized
issue in the trial.
   Halford testified on the stand he had put a backward message on
one Judas Priest song, but it was not on the album or song cited by
the plaintiffs. And he disagreed that backward messages are
``masked'' to influence behavior.
   ``No, it's not backward-masking. And that's the confusing issue
about that. When I made that statement in court, the prosecution
was jumping up and down in glee, because they thought they won the
trial,'' Halford said.
   ``The fact is, it's just a sound effect. It's been going on
since Jimi Hendrix and before him. It's a simple operation of
recording an instrument - a cymbal, a guitar, a voice - backwards
to create a sound effect. It's been going on for 30 or 40 years,''
he added.
   Tipton agreed, saying it was impossible to prove whether
backward messages are effective.
   ``In the whole history of there world there is not one instance
that's been proven that anybody can interpret anything backwards,
particularly something below audible level,'' he said.
   Halford, 39, wearing a T-shirt imprinted with the words ``Free
Speech'' formed from the American flag, is the group's primary
lyricist.
   He said that although Judas Priest is known for
``no-holds-barred'' heavy metal, he's never written lyrics that are
obscene, or advocate satanism or violence.
   ``That's what's so ludicrous about the whole controversy
supposedly surrounding this band,'' Halford said.
   Tipton agreed: ``We've never condoned the use of drugs or
alcohol or doing bad things.''
   Although the band does use words such as ``hell'' and ``damn''
on the new-release ``Painkiller,'' the words are not used in a
violent manner.
   ``It depends on how these words are used. We don't say `Take
these babies down into hell and kill them.' It's like `Hell's a hot
place.' The word hell is used, but its not used in what I would
consider a bad or influential way,'' Tipton said.
   Judas Priest, which includes Halford, Tipton, K.K. Downing, Ian
Hill and Scott Travis, will go on the road in October with their
new album. The worldwide tour starts in Canada, moves into the
United States in November, and ends up in Europe next year.
   Judas Priest is one of the founding fathers of modern-day heavy
metal. Known for cultivating the leather, studs and motorcycle look
in heavy metal, the band has cut 14 albums.
   Although Judas Priest has been around longer than many in its
genre, Halford says competition with younger groups is no longer an
issue with the band.
   ``What I've noticed in the past few years, particularly in heavy
metal, is that the substance is the most important issue now. It's
not how much hair you've got and how pretty you look. It's the
validity of your work,'' he said.

   Lt. Enrique Torruella swooped the
UH-1H ``Huey'' helicopter below 1,000 feet into the range of
guerrilla rifle fire. He banked the craft steeply in a tightening
gyre, then abruptly landed in the combat zone.
   The copter's deafening rotor flattened the waist-high grass.
Pvt. Manuel Zepeda, squinting through swollen eyes, his face
bloodied by shrapnel from a grenade, ran to the waiting ship. So
did another soldier carrying on his back Pvt. Santos Alfaro, badly
wounded in the head and arm by the same explosion.
   The aircraft was on the ground less than a minute. Torruella
revved the turbo-jet engine and raced off. Before the aircraft
reached safety beyond the range of enemy fire, medic Cpl. Tomas
Vasquez had a needle in Alfaro's arm and plasma dripping into his
veins.
   The Grupo de Helicopteros at Ilopango air base five miles east
of San Salvador embodies the single most significant tactical
advantage government forces have over the FMLN leftist rebel army.
   Military analysts consider the infusion of helicopters and pilot
training provided by Washington from 1982-85 crucial in preventing
the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front from winning the
civil war.
   The fleet provides transport of troops and supplies, rocket and
machine-gun support for ground troops and evacuation of nearly all
the wounded government soldiers.
   According to casualty statistics, no job in the military is as
dangerous as that of the squadron's 60 pilots. During the past 18
months it has become more so.
   The guerrillas since early 1989 have worked diligently on
anti-aircraft tactics. Virtually all the approximately 65 aging
Hueys and the few, newer Hughes 500s making up the squad have been
hit by ground fire.
   Several, perhaps a dozen, have been shot out of the sky. The
precise number is classified.
   Thirty pilots have been killed in action since the group was
formed in 1982. Most of the survivors have been wounded. Part of
Torruella's right foot was shot off in August 1989 when rifle fire
pierced the floor.
   Charcoal portraits of 26 of those killed adorn a wall of the
lobby of the group's headquarters. Once the four pending portraits
are added, there will be space for only two more before room will
have to made on another wall.
   The air force jealously guards information on rebel
effectiveness against its planes and helicopters. But, by way of
indication, on both days an AP correspondent and photographer
accompanied crews on ``medivac'' missions, at least one ship was
struck by gunfire.
   Most of the time, damage is limited to perforations of the
fuselage. But if 7.62mm fire from guerrilla AK-47s strikes the
engine, the tail rotor or hydraulic hoses, the helicopter may crash
or be forced to land off base.
   ``Rene,'' a guerrilla squad leader based on the slopes of
Guazapa Mountain 20 miles north of San Salvador, sat in the shade
one recent afternoon and described ``triangulation.'' The tactic
concentrates fire of up to 15 AKs on helicopters descending to
either pick up wounded or deliver supplies.
   The circling and dipping practiced by the pilots are intended to
minimize guerrilla efficiency.
   ``If you approach in a straight line, they get a bead on you,''
said Torruella, a smooth-faced 24-year-old. Like several of the
squad's members, he looks out of uniform more like an adolescent
than a combat chopper-jockey.
   All the pilots except one - a recent graduate of the local
aviation school - were trained at the U.S. Army's Fort Rucker in
Alabama.
   ``They have the same training as U.S. pilots. That instruction
combined with constant combat has made them among the best in the
world. Practice makes perfect,'' said Lt. Col. Arch Kielly, U.S.
Air Force attache in El Salvador.
   Military analysts say the air force, especially the helicopter
squadron, was essential to beating back November's large-scale
guerrilla offensive.
   The FMLN accused the government of indiscriminate rocket fire
and strafing of densely populated urban neighborhoods where
guerrillas had dug in.
   Air force authorities and U.S. advisors dispute the allegation,
saying dozens of requests from ground troops for air support were
denied for fear of inflicting unacceptable civilian casualties.
   Judging from what reporters saw during the offensive and from
inspections of battle-scarred neighborhoods afterward, the truth is
somewhere between the government and guerrilla claims.
   Aerial machine-gun fire perforated roofs in several areas and
rockets were launched into a few residential districts. But intense
use of air power appeared to have begun on the offensive's fourth
day, when most civilians had evacuated the battle zones.
   With the insurgents talking of a new offensive in coming weeks,
the pilots face a new peril. The rebels' reported acquisition of
scores of shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles could prove to be
a strategic watershed in the nearly 11-year-old war.
   Employment of similar weapons in the 1980s by U.S.-backed Afghan
guerrillas was one of the keys to the success of their campaign
against Soviet forces.

<DATELINE>TIPASA, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The burst of repression expected to
follow this summer's election victory by Islamic fundamentalists
hasn't materialized.
   Take the case of Tipasa. This Mediterranean resort welcomes tens
of thousands of European and Algerian tourists a year to pristine
beaches and extensive Roman ruins.
   Not long after the 15,000 residents elected a council dominated
by the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), posters went up announcing a
ban against shorts.
   The news quickly reaching Europe was portrayed as evidence the
fundamentalists knew no limits in imposing strict morality. How
could shorts be banned in a beach town?
   The impression of fire-breathing fundamentalists imposing a
draconian crackdown killed the season.
   ``June and July were just dead - there were almost no
Europeans,'' Ahmed Mansour remarked on the empty terrace of his
restaurant.
   But town administrator Mohammed Essamelli says the reality of
the ban was more complicated.
   ``First, this law's been here since 1965,'' said Essamelli.
``All the new council did was say they intended to enforce it.''
   Second, the law does not affect Tipasa's beaches, where men and
women in Western swimwear outnumber those in long robes 20 to one.
   It covers only the town center and was modeled on similar rules
on the French Riviera 25 years ago, Essamelli said.
   The law permits shorts in town if they reach the top of the knee
for men or the bottom of the knee for women. Essamelli finds this
reasonable.
   Mansour notes that no police officer has bothered to enforce the
ordinance and says the fundamentalists don't want to bite the
economic hand that feeds the electorate.
   ``Nobody has come here asking us to stop selling alcohol,'' he
said. ``They may be for Islam, but they know this country needs
other things, too.''
   The Tipasa case finds echoes elsewhere. Stories proliferate of
official crackdowns on ice cream and alcohol. Most turn out to be
exaggerated.
   Many of the reports originate with the official APS news agency,
an organ of the ruling National Liberation Front. The
fundamentalists thrashed the party in the elections.
   The fundamentalists certainly hope to change Algerian society.
Councils have moved to segregate boys and girls at school. The
movement debates whether women should work.
   But in the absence of holding national power - legislative
elections are planned next spring - the changes are mostly limited
to cosmetics.
   In Oran, Algeria's second city, humor made a difference.
   Fundamentalist councilors there denounced a festival of the
popular rai music, which celebrates youthful revolt. They said one
devoted to Islamic music would be better.
   A rai singer responded with a number featuring a compromise
refrain: ``I voted for the FIS, I voted for the FIS.''

   Oil prices approached $40 per barrel on the
futures market, about double the price before Iraq invaded Kuwait
and close to the level of cash prices paid 10 years ago during the
Iranian revolution.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline and home heating oil shot over $1
per gallon Monday as the market responded to amplified fears about
the Persian Gulf crisis.
   After peaking at $39.20 per barrel in the afternoon, light sweet
crude for November delivery settled up $2.82 at $38.25 per barrel -
a new record on the New York Mercantile Exchange, where oil futures
have been traded since 1983.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The federal budget deficit jumped $52.8
billion to a record $241.7 billion in August, but could be reduced
before the fiscal year ends Sept. 30, the Treasury Department
reported.
   The 67 percent surge over the comparable 11 months of 1989
boosted the spending imbalance well over the record of $221.1
billion posted in fiscal 1986, the department said Monday. The
August total, however, fell short of the one-month record of $53.3
billion set last March.
   ``We used to have years that were that bad,'' economist Bruce
Steinberg of Merrill Lynch said of the August deficit.
   ---
   NEW YORK (AP) - A federal judge ordered the release of
pre-sentencing documents about convicted financier Michael Milken,
ruling the public had a right to the information before she
pronounces his punishment.
   But Judge Kimba Wood said the released documents would be edited
to delete possibly incriminating information about others, and she
left unclear whether Milken's sentencing would proceed as scheduled
next Monday.
   Her ruling was part of last-minute legal maneuvers surrounding
the sentencing of Milken, the biggest and richest figure to fall in
a federal crusade against securities fraud crimes that began in the
late 1980s.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Losses at the nation's privately-run savings
and loans stabilized in the April-June quarter, the government
said, but analysts warned that deteriorating real estate markets
threaten the industry.
   The Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision said
Monday that 2,437 S&amp;Ls operating outside of government control lost
$196 million in the second quarter of 1990.
   That was a modest improvement over the $219 million loss in the
first three months of the year, a dramatic gain over the $720
million loss in the last three months of 1989 but a substantial
deterioration from the $308 million profit earned by the same
institutions a year earlier.
   ---
   NEW YORK (AP) - Chase Manhattan Corp.'s announcement that it
will slash its dividend and eliminate 5,000 jobs could signal
impending cutbacks by other major banks, analysts said.
   The nation's second-largest bank plans to halve its dividend
this quarter because it planned to set aside more than $650 million
by Sept. 30 to bolster reserves for loans that may go bad. Most of
the loans financed commercial real estate.
   But analysts said Monday that real estate is just one trouble
spot for major banks as the economy deteriorates.
   ---
   CHICAGO (AP) - The city is threatening to pull the plug on
Commonwealth Edison Co., which is reeling from recent power losses
that blacked out thousands of residents and raised doubts about the
utility's dependability.
   Edison's problems come just as it's trying to negotiate its
first new franchise with Chicago in 42 years.
   The contract expires Dec. 31, but the city this month halted
negotiations, saying it wanted to extend the current deal another
year while it figures out whether Edison is dependable.
   ---
   CHICAGO (AP) - The United Airlines pilots' union, contending
management is trying to discredit an employee buyout effort, has
urged its members to voice support for the proposal in a
letter-writing campaign to UAL directors.
   The Air Line Pilots Association said in a letter to members that
if the effort toward employee ownership falls through, it is ready
to ``confront senior management ... up to and including a strike.''
   Union spokesman James Hanson said Monday that the letter merely
spells out the ultimate option and is not a strike threat.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Many Americans are dumb consumers. Some don't
know much about buying a house, about compound interest, about unit
pricing at the grocery store or what a used-car disclosure must
contain.
   The Consumer Federation of America said Monday that it tested

   The stock market fell sharply to a 14-month low Monday, battered
by the one-two punch of rising oil prices and trouble in the
banking industry.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 59.41 to
2,452.97, its lowest close since it stood at 2,452.77 on July 3,
1989.
   The dollar sank against all major currencies. Prices of gold
jumped.
   Coffee prices sagged. Grains and soybeans were mostly higher.
Cattle futures fell. Pork futures were mixed.
   Bond prices fell, with the bellwether 30-year bond falling 19-32
point, or $5.94 per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which rises when
the price falls, had climbed to 9.17 percent from 9.11 percent late

<HEAD>Polly Peck's Asil Nadir Fights For His Business Reputation</HEAD>

   Asil Nadir, a Turkish-Cypriot who built up his
Polly Peck conglomerate over more than two decades, is fighting a
battle on two fronts as he tries to impede the erosion of the
company's stock market value and his own business reputation.
   The company's board of directors and the Turkish government have
rallied around the chairman and chief executive officer of Polly
Peck, a firm whose interests are as diverse as Del Monte pineapples
and Sansui stereos.
   The company's shares dove 55 percent last Thursday on rumors of
a possible Serious Fraud Office investigation into the company.
Later that day, Nadir was interviewed by the office, which
investigates and prosecutes cases of serious fraud.
   British newspaper reports in recent weeks have alleged the
company's share price may have been supported illegally, as was the
case in the headline-making Guinness scandal, which resulted in a
five-year prison term for the brewer's former chairman.
   The Department of Trade and Industry is considering a request
made Sunday by Polly Peck's board for an independent inquiry into
the conglomerate's dealings, a department spokeswoman said Monday.
She was not identified, in accordance with British practice.
   Trading in Polly Peck's shares, a high-flying stock of the
1980s, remained suspended Monday. London's Stock Exchange agreed to
the company's request to halt trading Thursday after the shares
slumped by 135 pence ($2.50) to 108 pence ($2).
   The exchange says it allows trading in a company's shares to be
suspended pending an announcement by the company. It says it does
not impose a deadline for such an announcement, but presses for one
as quickly as possible.
   Nadir said in a letter to the trade department requesting the
independent inquiry: ``So intense and severe is the attack on
myself that we, on our own, are unlikely to be able to find a fair
hearing.''
   Nadir also issued a statement Sunday saying he would start legal
proceedings for alleged defamation against Times Newspapers Ltd.
and The Observer Ltd.
   The newspapers reported Sunday that a former Polly Peck
executive has given information about Polly Peck activities to the
Serious Fraud Office.
   After a board meeting Friday, Polly Peck's directors said it
``deplores the recent attacks on the chairman'' and that there
would be a ``more detailed statement next week.''
   The Turkish government has accused Greek Cypriots of a smear
campaign against Nadir. A Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman
recently said ``this ugly campaign begun at the instigation of
Greek Cypriots was aimed at bringing the Turkish Cypriot republic's
economy to its knees.''
   Nadir, an ally of Turkish President Turgut Ozal, has extensive
publishing and electronics interests in Turkey and is the largest
private employer in the Turkish-controlled part of Cyprus.
   Polly Peck's shares crashed once before, in the early 1980s,
after Greek Cypriots claimed the company was exploiting land seized
from Greek Cypriots after Turkey's 1974 invasion divided the island
in two. The shares also were hurt because the company's earnings
weren't matching analysts' forecasts.
   The company's stock has fallen sharply since August, when Nadir,
who owns 28 percent of the company's shares, said he wanted to take
the company private and then withdrew the plan after five days. The
Stock Exchange criticized him for his hasty actions.
   William de Winton, an analyst with the London investment firm
Hoare Govett Ltd. said the company has been doing well. ``The
business is not in an untenable position. As far as I can see they
are going to have a relatively successful year,'' he said.
   Polly Peck's after-tax profit rose 16 percent last year.
   Nadir, the son of a wealthy Cypriot, came to England in the
1960s and set up his own clothing company in east London. He then
branched out into fruit distribution, electronics and tourism.
   In 1980, he took control of the ailing British textile company
Polly Peck and used the firm as his stock market vehicle for
expansion. Polly Peck bought the Del Monte fresh fruit operations
last year and control of Sansui Electric Co. in December.
   In the process of building his company, Nadir became one of
Britain's richest persons last year with a personal fortune valued
at 213 million pounds ($396 million). That fortune is worth
considerably less at today's market price.

<TEXT>
   A judge has ordered the release of
pre-sentencing documents about Michael Milken, which could provide
revealing information about the convicted financier before his
punishment is officially announced.
   But the ruling Monday by U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood said the
released documents would be edited to delete possibly incriminating
information about others.
   She also left unclear whether Milken's sentencing would proceed
as scheduled Oct. 1, less than a week away.
   Her ruling was part of last-minute legal maneuvers surrounding
the sentencing of Milken, the biggest and richest figure to fall in
a federal crusade against securities fraud crimes that began in the
late 1980s.
   Milken reversed claims of innocence in April, pleaded guilty to
six felonies and paid a record $600 million in fines and penalties
to settle the biggest securities fraud case ever against a single
person.
   In the past few weeks, prosecutors and defense attorneys have
given Wood exhaustive documents to guide her in determining a
sentence for Milken, who faces a possible 28 years in prison.
   News organizations sought copies of the documents before the
sentencing date, but Milken's lawyers opposed an early release on
grounds it could unfairly prejudice the sentencing.
   ``I reject that contention. There's no jury here,'' Wood told a
hearing at Manhatttan federal court. Delaying the release of the
information, she said, ``may prejudice the ability of the press to
understand it.''
   She ordered prosecutors to release edited versions of their
sentencing memos that avoid references to other individuals or
pending criminal investigations. They were expected to be available
later today.
   Defense lawyers declined to comment on Wood's ruling but said
they would release similarly edited versions of their sentencing
memos at about the same time.
   Although the documents are edited, people familiar with the case
said Monday they could provide revealing insights into the scope of
government's enormous case against Milken, as well as the depth of
his defense.
   Milken is widely perceived as one of the most influential
financiers in the 1980s, who made a fortune by parlaying high-risk
securities known as junk bonds into a $200 billion market.
   Although Milken pleaded guilty to only six crimes related to
securites and tax crimes, prosecutors have been seeking to persuade
the judge to consider a list of other illegal acts they say Milken
committed.
   They have asked for an extraordinary hearing on this question,
which could delay Milken's sentencing. Wood did not say whether she
would grant such a hearing but asked Assistant U.S. Attorney John
Carroll to provide examples of other cases in which similar
hearings were requested.
   The case against Milken is by far the most important result of
an intensive federal crackdown on securities fraud that surfaced
nearly four years ago when stock speculator Ivan Boesky paid the
government $100 million to settle charges of trading on inside
information.
   Boesky's revelations led to numerous prosecutions and played a
role in the downfall of Milken's former employer Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc., the once-feared Wall Street powerhouse that is now
out of business.
   Milken pioneered Drexel's use of junk-bond financing for
takeover deals, and he had extensive and close links with a number
of leading American investors and speculators.

<TEXT>
   The city is threatening to pull the plug on
Commonwealth Edison Co., which is reeling from recent power losses
that blacked out thousands of residents and raised doubts about the
utility's dependability.
   Edison's problems come just as it's trying to negotiate its
first new franchise with Chicago in 42 years.
   The contract expires Dec. 31, but the city this month halted
negotiations, saying it wanted to extend the current deal another
year while it figures out whether Edison is dependable.
   ``We can't bargain in the dark,'' Mayor Richard M. Daley said
recently.
   Edison hasn't said yet whether it will agree to the extension.
Utility spokesman John Hogan said Comm Ed would like to see the
deal completed this year and that, in any case, its reliability is
unimpeachable.
   Even if eependability weren't an issue, the city holds a wild
card: the option under the current franchise of buying Comm Ed's
facilities in the city.
   Other major U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, have public
utilities, and some smaller cities have recently used franchise
buyout clauses to purchase private utilities, said Deborah Nuttall,
a spokeswoman for the Washington, D.C.-based American Public Power
Association.
   But no large cities have made such a buyout in recent years, she
said.
   Edison is trying to salvage its image after a series of
crippling blackouts, including one in late July in which 40,000
West Side customers were without electricity for three days. Some
small stores were looted during the outage.
   About a week later, an outage cut off 25,000 customers,
infuriating many people.
   Four less severe power failures have hit the city and suburbs in
the past three days, including two Monday that briefly knocked out
power to more than 2,000 customers.
   On Saturday, 15,000 West Side customers were without power for
up to seven hours, and on Sunday a brief blackout hit about 2,500
South Side customers.
   Other unrelated failures cut off power to the downtown area of
the city of Streeterville and the Chicago Board of Trade, where
trading was suspended for about an hour last Tuesday.
   Hogan said that because of the two major summer blackouts, the
media is reporting minor problems that previously would have been
ignored.
   Edison has blamed the West Side blackouts on a problem at a
generating plant, and other failures on damaged cables and animals
chewing power lines.
   Still, Hogan said Edison maintains ``a 99.98 percent reliability
factor.''
   ``We don't have any reason to believe the total infrastructure
is in jeopardy,'' Hogan said.
   Even so, the Daley administration insists a buyout is a real
alternative.
   ``This is not a bargaining chip,'' Daley spokeswoman Carolyn
Grisko said Friday. ``This is a possibility.''
   The current agreement gives the city the right to purchase Comm
Ed's system within the city's limits - an option first given
serious consideration in 1985 under the late Mayor Harold
Washington's administration.
   The utility serves 3.2 million customers in 25 counties of
northern Illinois.
   Other issues besides the buyout are on the table, including how
much money the utility pays the city for the right to operate here.
Currently, the utility pays Chicago 4 percent of its gross receipts
- which last year was in excess of $72 million, Hogan said.
   Consumer groups, such as Citizens Utility Board, are asking the
city to consider a new franchise that would require Commonwealth
Edison to work harder to cut customer costs.
   Residential Commonwealth Edison customers paid 10.7 cents per
kilowatt hour for electricity in 1988, compared with a national
average of 7.5 cents, according to the power association.
   Edison financial analysts say the utility also has a lot to lose
in the talks.
   Chicago represents ``a large portion of the company's sales,''
said Linda Byus, a utility analyst for Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago.
Its image also is linked closely to the city, which may help forge
an amicable agreement between the two, she said.

<HEAD>United Pilots Union Urges Letter-Writing Campaign to Support
Buyout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Still struggling to obtain financing for an
employee buyout of UAL Inc., union pilots of United Airlines now
are trying to beat back emerging opposition within the company.
   Officials of the Air Line Pilots Association sent letters over
the weekend asking members to let the company directors know they
support employee ownership.
   The union, in a letter to its members, said a broad showing of
support is needed to counteract efforts by UAL Chairman Stephen
Wolf to undermine the buyout. The union also said there has been an
anonymously sponsored anti-employee ownership letter-writing
campaign within the company.
   UAL spokeswoman Sara Dornaker said Monday she did not know the
origin of the letter-writing campaign. But she said ``several
hundred'' employees have written to Wolf expressing concern about
an employee buyout would burden the company with too much debt.
   ``There is a growing concern in the industry and among employees
about being a highly leveraged carrier in these highly uncertain
times,'' she said.
   Doug Wellman, vice president of the Association of Flight
Attendants' United local, said his union will join the pilots in
urging its members to write to UAL directors.
   He denied the union letters have anything to do with the
struggle to obtain financing for the buyout.
   ``It has to do with the ill-conceived, (anti-buyout)
propaganda'' surfacing within the company, he said.
   Wellman said several hundred letters opposing employee ownership
are inconsequential considering the number of company employees -
more than 71,000.
   It was not known whether the third union in the buyout attempt,
the Machinists, also would write the directors. Spokesmen were not
in their offices late Monday and could not be reached for comment
by telephone.
   The pilots union said in its letter that if the effort toward
employee ownership falls through, it is ready to ``confront senior
management ... up to and including a strike.''
   Union spokesman James Hanson said the letter merely spells out
the ultimate option and is not a strike threat.
   The pilots, flight attendants and machinists unions have offered
$201 a share, or $4.38 billion, for UAL, the parent of United
Airlines. The company's directors accepted the offer, but the
employee group has had trouble coming up with the financing.
   Union officials said it was within days of arranging financing
with some lenders - and within hours with others - when Iraq
invaded Kuwait. The effect on oil prices, the cost of running an
airline and the uncertainty introduced into the economy ``may
continue to cause difficulty'' with financing, the union said.
   A $300-a-share offer collapsed for lack of financing last
October.
   The UAL board meets Thursday, but the union has until Oct. 9 to
arrange financing. The employee group failed t meet a deadline in
August and was given a two-month extension by the directors. The
board said then that if the financing was not in place by Oct. 9,
the deal would be off.

<NOTE>EDS: With PM-Auto Mileage-Best &amp; Worst and PM-Fuel Economy. EPA
mileage list of all cars moved in advance Sept. 21 as b0245-b0262.

<TEXT>
   Automakers are showing little or no gain in
fuel economy for the fifth straight year, with 1991 model cars
having on average as much thirst at the gas pumps as they did in
1987, the government reported today.
   The Environmental Protection Agency released the new fuel
economy figures as the Senate considered legislation that would
require sharp improvements in automobile fuel efficiency over the
next decade.
   According to the EPA's annual fuel economy statistics covering
about 1,000 cars, the 1991 models - both domestics and imports -
show an overall average of 28.1 miles per gallon, slightly better
than last year and identical to the fleet average in 1987.
   While the most miserly cars such as the minicompact Geo Metro
attain more than 50 mpg, more than half of the cars on the list
achieved no better than 22 mpg. The increasingly popular passenger
vans and specialty vehicles could on average do no better than the
high teens.
   The manufacturers want to ``sell bigger engines, more muscle and
acceleration which they call performance,'' said Joan Claybrook,
president of Public Citizen, a Washington-based consumer
organization, and a frequent critic of the automakers.
   Auto industry executives have pointed to the significant
improvements in fuel economy of cars since the 1970s, when the
fleet average was only about 14 mpg, and attribute the more recent
figures to consumer demand for larger and peppier cars.
   Similar views are found in automobile showrooms.
   ``It's not the industry pushing performance. It's the consumer
that's been demanding it in the last few years,'' said Ray Turk, a
salesman at a Nissan dealership in suburban Maryland.
   Janice Walsh was one of those consumers the other day as she
prepared to take a sporty Nissan 300ZX for a test spin, taking
little notice of its skimpy 18 mpg mileage rating for city driving.
``I like a car that's fun,'' she said.
   Down the road at another dealership, retiree John Webb and his
wife said the 17 mpg city driving estimate on a Mercury Marquis
didn't bother them. ``When we travel we want a good-sized car and
lots of trunk space,'' said Webb. ``We really haven't talked about
mileage.''
   The EPA noted that between the mid-1970s and early 1980s
significant gains were made in making automobiles more
fuel-efficient. ``Since 1982, however, the overall fleet fuel
economy figures have increased only slightly, partly because stable
oil prices reduced the demand for fuel-efficient vehicles.''
   Since 1987 the fleet-wide averages have been virtually at a
standstill. They were 28.1 mpg in 1987, 28.6 mpg in 1988, 28.1 mpg
in 1989 and 27.8 mpg in 1990.
   As in previous years, the 1991 figures showed a wide range of
gas mileage, from the minicompact Geo Metro that gets 58 mpg on the
highway and only a few miles less in the city to the luxurious
two-seater Lamborghini Diablo that gets 9 mpg on city streets.
   Four of the 10 best performing cars were variations of the Geo,
a Japanese-made minicompact that is sold through General Moors.
The others were two versions of the Honda Civic CRX, two varieties
of the Suzuki Swift, a Daihatsu Charade and a diesel-powered
Volkswagen Jetta. All get at least 37 mpg in the city and 42 mpg on
the highway.
   At the other extreme were the Lamborghini, five versions of the
Rolls-Royce, two Ferraris and two BMWs - none of which attained
more than 12 mpg in city driving and generally only slightly higher
on the highways.
   Even within various size categories the fuel efficiency of
different cars varied widely. As expected, small economy cars
generally showed much better fuel economy than expensive and
performance-leaning luxury models.
   The EPA listed only 35 cars subject to the so-called ``gas
guzzler'' tax, which in the case of the Lamborghini Diablo amounts
to $3,200. But those figures can be misleading.
   The guzzler tax, which kicks in if a car gets less than 22.5 mpg
in combined city and highway driving, is based on raw test results,
while the EPA figures are adjusted downward by a mathematical
formula so the mileage figures more closely reflect actual driving
conditions.
   Using the adjusted EPA figures, 393 of the 728 cars, specialty
vehicles and passenger vans on the list attained gas mileage of
less than 22.5 mpg. All but a handful of the nearly 300 trucks on
the list also failed to meet the 22.5 mpg figure.
   Trucks, passenger vans and specialty vehicles are not covered by
the tax, which is assessed only on cars based on a sliding scale
depending on miles per gallon.

<HEAD>Toyota Exec Favors Mid-American Site for New Toyota Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decision has yet to be made about where Toyota
Motor Corp. will put its new U.S. assembly plant, but one executive
favors mid-America.
   Bob McCurry, executive vice president of Toyota's U.S. sales and
marketing arm, said Monday that the company needs the capacity of
another car plant to meet its goal of selling 1.5 million cars and
trucks in the United States by the mid-1990s.
   About 80 percent of those vehicles, or 1.3 million, will be
cars, said spokesman John McCandless.
   If that goal is met and if current sales trends continue into
the mid-1990s, Toyota could overtake Chrysler Corp. as the nation's
third-largest automaker. Before that can happen, Toyota has to
develop more manufacturing capacity, McCurry said.
   ``To do the volume we're talking about, with 50 percent (of
production) in this market, we need new facilities,'' McCurry said.
   Toyota officials have said an announcement about the location of
a new assembly plant should be made within two months. But McCurry
hedged Monday, saying only that a decision would be made soon.
   A possible place is next to Toyota's assembly plant now
operating in Georgetown, Ky. There is available land on the site
and supply lines already are in place.
   Toyota also has the option in 1996 to buy General Motors Corp.'s
share of the companies' joint New United Motor Manufacturing Inc.
plant near Fremont, Calif., which builds the Toyota Corolla and
GM's Geo Prizm.
   When asked about the possible location of a new plant, McCurry
said, ``I'm one who believes your plants should be in
mid-America.''
   In 1989, Toyota sold 707,357 cars and Chrysler sold 1,077,651
cars. But through the first eight months of this year, Chrysler's
car sales of 560,057 were down 21.6 percent from last year, while
Toyota's 602,562 were up 15.7 percent.
   Toyota's sales in August set a company record, partly because of
an aggressive sales campaign, and inflated the year-to-date figure.
   McCurry's comments came during the introduction of a newly
designed Tercel entry-level car. He said the two- and four-door
models of the car, which looks similar to a Ford Tempo, is the
``lowest-priced car in America with a trunk.''
   The base price for the two-door is $6,488. McCurry said he
expected the price for a typically equipped Tercel, with all dealer
handling costs, taxes and fees included, would cost about $8,400.
   The car targets the Hyundai Excel, Nissan Sentra and Ford
Escort. McCurry said he expected 1991 Tercel sales to be about
130,000 cars, up from about 100,000 of the 1990 models.

<HEAD>Sears Slashes Catalog Headquarters Jobs By 20</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears Roebuck and Co. has trimmed 213 jobs from
its unprofitable catalog division in an effort to cut costs, a
company spokesman said.
   The cuts represent 20 percent of the company's catalog
headquarters staff and are part of a plan to consolidate hundreds
of corporate-level jobs.
   Last year, the suburban Skokie-based catalog division logged
about $4 billion in sales, but the segment hasn't turned a profit
since 1985.
   But despite these difficulties, a company spokesman said Sears
Chairman Edward A. Brennan intends to remain in the catalog
business. Brennan vowed ``to stay in the business and to address
our problems more aggressively,'' the spokesman told the Chicago
Tribune in comments published in today's editions.
   The newspaper did not name the spokesman.
   Including the latest cuts, the catalog headquarters staff has
shrunk by more than half, to 821 from about 1,700 in January 1989.
   The cuts affect both full-time managers and hourly employees in
Skokie and in support offices in Downers Grove and Northbrook, Ill.
More than half work in advertising, marketing and buying, the
spokesman said.
   In contrast to previous cuts, the catalog division employees
weren't given the choice of remaining with Sears. Managers informed
the employees Monday and outlined severence-pay plans based on the
number of years each worker has spent with the company, the
newspaper said.
   Sears officials said the catalog division has improved and they
expect it to show a profit again by 1991.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Approves Assignment of Stotler Commodity Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McCormick Capital Inc. has received court
approval to acquire seven commodity funds belonging to Stotler
Group Inc., a recently collapsed futures company.
   The transaction, approved Monday by U.S. District Judge Milton
Shadur, is subject to certain conditions, including approval by the
limited partners of the funds.
   McCormick Capital's subsidiary, McCormick Futures Management
Inc., will become general partner and commodity pool operator of
the funds: Advanced Portfolio Management Limited Partnership II,
Stotler Futures Fund, Stotler Heartland Futures Fund I, Thomson
Commodity Partners I, Thomson Commodity Partners II, Thomson
Financial Futures Partners I and Thomson McKinnon Futures Fund.
   The federal bankruptcy court suspended proceedings against
Stotler Group to allow McCormick to assume control of the funds.
   McCormick said that it expects the acquisition to be completed
before the end of the year and that it may begin acting as clearing
broker for the funds in October.
   Stotler wasone of the nation's largest futures brokers and
until this summer was headed by Karsten Mahlmann, who resigned
under pressure as chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade.

<HEAD>Peabody Cuts About 275 White Collar Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 275 white collar employees are being
dismissed as part of a cost-cutting move by Peabody Holding Co.
Inc., the coal mine operator.
   Peabody said Monday it would trim 70 employees from its
250-member headquarters payroll and another 70 from its Henderson,
Ky., Peabody Coal Co. subsidiary.
   All corporate activities at Henderson are to be reassigned to
St. Louis and to operating divisions throughout the country, said
Ronald Greenfield, vice president of public relations. Henderson
will serve as the headquarters for Peabody's Midwest division,
which includes mining operations in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and
Oklahoma.
   Other cuts will be made in offices in 11 states where Peabody
mines coal, the company said. The dismissals represent 2.5 percent
of Peabody's total workforce.
   The company had 11,107 salaried and hourly workers at the end of
1989, according to Peabody Holding's annual report.
   Greenfield blamed the layoffs on ``competitive pressures that
the whole industry has been under since the mid-1980s.''
   He said the payroll cuts were initiated by Hanson PLC, the
British conglomerate that assumed control of Peabody earlier this
year.
   The layoffs, which were announced Monday in a letter to
employees by John H. Wimberly, acting president of Peabody, were to
take place Tuesday.
   ``Those employees terminated or who resign with management's
approval...will be eligible for a special package in lieu of notice
which doubles the current severance payments and includes an extra
two months of medical benefits,'' Wimberly's letter said.
   Dismissed workers will get five months' worth of health benefits
and will be able to purchase up to 15 more months of coverage. The
company also will provide placement services.
   According to its 1989 annual report, Peabody Holding owns or
controls 8 billion tons of coal reserves, and its subsidiaries
operate 43 mines. Peabody reported $136.5 million in operating
profits on revenue of $1.74 billion in 1989.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Hears Arguments in Eastern Pilots Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines has asked a federal appeals
court to overturn a Florida judge's decision that the company must
give former strikers some of the jobs taken by replacement pilots.
   Eastern hired about 900 replacement pilots during the 1989
strike by the Air Line Pilots Association. ALPA walked out with
Eastern's Machinists, who remain on strike, but ended the action
about nine months later.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Davis of Miami, where Eastern is
based, ruled last month that the union is entitled to the jobs of
trainees. But Eastern attorney Joseph Manson argued before the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday that Davis erred in ruling
that replacement pilots did not have permanent employee status if
they were in training when the ALPA strike ended.
   James Linsey, an attorney for the union, said the replacement
workers cannot be given permanent protection until they are
``transformed into fully qualified employees.''
   The three-judge 11th Circuit panel did not indicate when it
would rule. The number of jobs at issue also must be determined by
the court; Eastern puts it at about 190, while the union says it's
400.

<TEXT>
   Kobe Steel Ltd. said Tuesday it has agreed with
Aluminum Company of America to set up a joint venture in Japan to
produce and market aluminum sheet for beverage cans.
   The plan would give Alcoa, the world's largest aluminum
producer, better access to the Japanese market and provide Kobe
Steel with a steady source of aluminum ingot, a Kobe Steel official
said.
   As a part of the proposal, Kobe Steel and Pittsburgh-based Alcoa
will exchange technical information and the U.S. company will
supply Kobe Steel with primary aluminum ingot, the official said.
   The official said the two companies also agreed to collaborate
on developing aluminum products for the automotive industry in both
Japan and the United States.
   The official said the venture, to be capitalized at abouyt $71
million and equally owned by Kobe Steel and Alcoa, will be
established in Tokyo by the end of this year.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
venture will build a plant by early 1993 with an annual production
capacity of 180,000 metric tons of aluminum sheet for manufacturing
aluminum cans for the Japanese and Asian markets.
   He said the plant would be located in Moka city, 48 miles north
of Tokyo.

   The stock market struggled to rally today as
prices seesawed in a narrow range and flirted with the 14-month low
reached in the previous session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 2.97 points at
2,455.94 in the first hour and a half of trading. But the broader
market suffered as losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 5 with
708 issues declining, 510 advancing and 533 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 52.43 million shares as of 11
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Stock prices inched higher on the opening as traders drew
encouragement from lower oil prices. The benchmark crude contract
had fallen $1.03 to $37.22 a barrel early today after record-high
crude prices helped drive the Dow down by nearly 60 points on
Monday.
   But equities' move upward was shortlived. ``It shows that any
rally should be sold in this marketplace,'' said Emmanuel
Geronimous, senior vice president at Lehman Brothers. ``Uneasiness
continues to take hold with any rally.''
   He noted, however that the market has been able to stabilize
somewhat in the absence of wholesale institutional selling.
   Separately, the economic outlook dimmed as the government
reported a downward revision in second-quarter gross national
product figures.
   MCA led the Big Board's actives list, skyrocketing 25 to 59{.
The company is discussing a possible buyout with Japan's Matsushita
Electric Industrial Co. at a price reported to be between $80 and
$90 a share. That would value the deal at as much as $7.5 billion.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid a lack of
news that would have a significant impact on prices.
   Soybean futures opened modestly higher, wheat was up slightly
and corn futures were narrowly mixed following gains Monday in all
those markets, largely in reaction to powerful rallies in oil and
precious metal prices.
   The energy and metal markets provided little direction this
morning, however.
   The Census Bureau's monthly report of an August soybean crush of
92.8 million bushels contained no surprises, analysts said. Neither
did Monday's weekly crop-progress report, which showed corn and
soybean maturity still lagging behind the normal pace.
   The next scheduled event that could affect grain prices is
Thursday's quarterly Agriculture Department grain stocks report,
said Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice president in the grain
trading division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   In early trading, wheat futures were unchanged to } cent higher

was } cent lower to 1 cent higher with December at $2.28\ a bushel;
oats were { cent lower to { cent higher with December at $1.12 a

   Condor, the Lufthansa airline
charter subsidiary, said it has placed a $1.3 billion order with
Boeing for 17 new aircraft in what the charter company said was its
largest order to date.
   Condor Flugdienst GmBH made the announcement on Monday.
   The company said it will take delivery through the middle of
1995.
   The acquisition is in line with the Neu Isenburg-based airline's
fleet expansion plans.
   At present Condor operates a fleet of 22 aircraft, of which
three are Mcdonnell Douglas DC-10s, three are Airbuses made by
Airbus Industrie, seven are Boeing 757-200s and nine are Boeing
737-300 aircraft.
   The spokesman said Lufthansa, a 51-percent state-owned German
flag carrier, will acquire Condor's Airbus planes next year as
Boeing replacements arrive.
   Condor said its new Boeing order consists of nine 757-200 type
aircraft as well as eight long-range versions of the 767-300.
   Lufthansa itself has a multibillion dollar fleet overhaul
program under way with a large volume of Boeing aircraft on order.
   The Condor Spokesman said his airline will retain the DC-10s it
currently is flying.

<HEAD>Officials Announce Settlement in Price-Fixing Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSH LEMIEUX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys general in Missouri and
Kansas on Tuesday announced an antitrust settlement in principle in
a $1 billion natural gas price-fixing case.
   Bob Stephan of Kansas and William Webster of Missouri said the
settlement with Amoco Production Co. and Oxy USA, a subsidiary of
Occidental Petroleum, in Tulsa, would benefit natural gas consumers
in four states who paid excessive rates from 1979-85. The consumers
were from Kansas, western Missouri, southern Nebraska and northern
Oklahoma.
   Officials said details of the settlemene three
major dt with two of thefendants could not be released until Friday, the
deadline
for lawyers to put the deal in writing.
   The attorneys general spoke at the federal courthouse in Kansas
City, Kan., where a consolidated lawsuit had been scheduled to
begin Tuesday against the two gas producers and Williams Natural
Gas Co.
   Williams has not agreed to the settlement, and jury selection
for the suit against Williams was scheduled for Wednesday morning.
   Several utility companies who distributed the gas to consumers
were also involved as plaintiffs. Webster and Stephan said they
believe those utilities would sign on to the settlement.
   ``I'm sure the terms will benefit the consumers for many years
to come,'' Stephan said at the newn that gets 18 mpg in the city, John
Webb and his wife looked
over a Mercury Grand Marquis - a big car with a V-8 engine and a
cavernous trunk.
   ``When we travel we want a good size car and lots of trunk
space,'' said Webb, a retiree who says the Marquis fits the bill
although its city mileage is a thirsty 17 mpg.
   ``We really haven't talked about mileage,'' Webb said.
   The Persian Gulf crisis has prompted renewed efforts in Congress
to require automakers to improve fuel economy. A bill before the
Senate would require fleet averages to reach 40 mpg by 2001, a 40
percent increase from today's averages of roughly 28 mpg.
   Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen and a frequent
critic of the auto industry, accused automakers of pushing ``bigger
engines, more muscle and acceleration which they call performance''
instead of trying to make cars more fuel efficient.
   ``They want to sell speed instead of fuel economy,'' said
Clarence Ditlow, head of the Washington-based Center for Auto
Safety. ``The performance cars are the higher priced cars and the
ones with more options and more profits.''
   But those in the auto business say they're only giving the
customer what he or she wants.
   ``It's not the industry pushing performance. It's the consumer
that's been demanding it in the last few years,'' argues Ray Turk,
the Nissan salesman at Herb Gordon AutoWorld in suburban Maryland
where Ms. Walsh was shopping.
   As in previous years, the 1991 models reflected a wide range of
mileage from the minicompact Geo Metro that gets 58 mpg on the
highway and only slightly less in city driving to the luxurious
two-seater Lamborghini Diablo that guzzles at 9 mpg on city
streets.
   In between are about 1,000 models and variations of models of
cars, trucks and vans.
   The EPA list includes only 35 cars subject to a gasoline
``guzzler'' tax that kicks in for cars getting 22.5 mpg or less and
in the case of the Lamborghini Diablo amounts to $3,200.
   But those numbers may be misleading.
   For tax purposes, only the raw fuel economy test scores are
used, not the lower EPA figures that are adjusted through a
mathematical formula to better reflect actual driving conditions.
Increasingly popular passenger vans, speciality vehicles and trucks
also are excluded.
   Using the adjusted EPA figures, more than half the cars listed
showed a fuel economy of fewer than 22.5 mpg with the average
mileage for increasingly popular passenger vans and 4-wheel drive
speciality vehicles coming in at fewer than 20 mpg.
   Four of the 10 cars with the best fuel economy were variations
of the Geo, a Japanese-built car sold through General Motors.
   The others were two variations of the Honda Civic, two versions
of the Suzuki Swift, the Daihatsu Charade and the diesel-powered
Volkswagen Jetta, all with mileage estimates of between 37 mpg and
49 mpg in the city and 43 mpg to 52 mpg on the highway.
   At the other extreme were the Lamborghini Diablo, five versions
of the Rolls-Royce, two BMWs and a pair of Ferraris. None of the 10
vehicles achieved more than 12 mpg in city driving.
   According to industry figures, those worst and best performers
account for only a small fraction of the vehicles likely to be on
the nation's highways. The industry estimates cars that get better
than 40 mpg account for less than 3 percent of sales, while the
luxury cars that make up the worst mileage performers are far fewer
in number.
   Energy conservation advocates and environmentalists said the
latest figures demonstrate the failure of the auto industry to push
fuel economy in marketing and research.

   The U.S. dollar ended mixed against major
currencies in European trading today.
   Gold prices rose again amid anxieties over the Persian Gulf
crisis, increasing as much as $11 an ounce.
   Foreign Exchange dealers said the dollar benefitted from
technical factors linked to cross trading between the Japanese yen
and major European currencies.
   They said the dollar could be helped if oil prices lose momentum
and Wall Street remains relatively steady.
   The dealers reported that concern about the effect of rising oil
prices on the Japanese economy, which depends heavily on imported
oil, was driving investors out of the yen to major European
currencies, particularly the safe-haven Swiss franc.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.8765 from $1.8810 late
Monday. A pound fetched $1.8710 in early afternoon trading in New
York.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
levels were: 1.5630 German marks, up from 1.5565; 1.2990 Swiss
francs, down from 1.2965; 5.2340 French francs, up from 5.2145;
1.7618 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7665; 1,168.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,165.50; and, 1.1493 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1483.
   Selected dollar rates around midday in New York included: 1.5655
German marks; 1.3035 Swiss francs; 1,14975 Canadian dollars; and
1,172.50 Italian lire.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 136.70 Japanese yen from
137.33 yen at Friday's close. Japanese markets were closed Monday
for a national holiday. Later, in London, the dollar was quoted at
136.50 yen and in the New York afternoon the dollar traded at
137.52 yen.
   Precious metals dealers said their markets were busy but trading
was choppy as operators tried to carve out a new trading range
following the surge through $400 an ounce.
   Dealers said if there is no improvement in the Middle East
conflict they expect gold to continue firming.
   Gold closed in London, the major market, at a bid of $403.25 a
troy ounce, up from $396.55. The late Zurich bid was $404.25, up
from $392.90.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $405.85, up from Monday's
late $389.75.
   Silver bullion closed in London at a bid of $4.87 a troy ounce,
down from $4.89 Monday.

<HEAD>Tests: Arco's `Clean Gas' Has Higher Concentration of Suspected
Carcinogen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The environmental benefits of Atlantic
Richfield Co.'s new premium unleaded gasoline outweigh any possible
health risks suggested by private tests, scientists said.
   The tests indicate the gasoline, designed to reduce pollutants,
produces a 34 percent increase in emissions of a suspected
carcinogen.
   But scientists said the fuel's overall benefits to clean air and
health are worthwhile, and the increased concentrations of
1,3-butadiene were too small to pose a health threat.
   ``I don't personally think the emissions are anything to worry
about. I think we're buying a lot more by reducing the benzene and
the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons,'' said Rogene Henderson, an
inhalation toxicologist at the Lovelace Inhalation and Toxicology
Research Institute.
   Arco unveiled its new EC-Premium on Sept. 6, calling theffuel
the ``cleanest burning'' gasoline available in Southern California.
   Environmentalists became concerned about the new formula after
obtaining previously undisclosed results of Arco's testing.
Compared to conventional unleaded premium, Arco had said the new
fuel reduced emissions of cancer-causing benzene by 36 percent,
carbon monoxide by 28 percent and smog-forming hydrocarbons by 21
percent.
   But the company made no mention of the 34 percent increase in
emissions of 1,3-butadiene and a possible 9.8 percent increase in
smog-forming nitrogen oxides.
   Arco confirmed the butadiene results Monday, the Los Angeles
Times reported in its Tuesday editions. However, the company said
the 9.8 percent nitrogen oxide increase was based on unreliable
data.
   Butadiene, used in manufacturing some rubber, is a toxic
component of tailpipe emissions that is considered less threatening
to health than benzene.
   Emissions of 1,3-butadiene from EC-Premium were measured at 3.3
milligrams per mile, compared to 2.5 milligrams per mile for
conventional unleaded premium gasoline.
   Scientists at the Lovelace Institute in Albuquerque, N.M., and
the Health Effects Institute in Cambridge, Mass., said that even
with a 34 percent increase, the 1,3-butadiene concentrations were
too small to be significant.
   Dan Townsend, manager of Arco's clean fuels task force, said
that despite the increase in butadiene, EC-Premium reduces
pollutants overall.
   ``While the butadiene is up, all of the other toxics are down
enough that the overall cancer risk is down by 28 percent,''
Townsend said.

   The stock market sputtered higher today, but
analysts criticized the bounce as unimpressive because it was
linked to a single potential takeover.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 17.57 points at
2,470.54 at midafternoon. But the broader market suffered as losers
outnumbered gainers by about 10 to 9 with 748 issues declining, 688
advancing and 489 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 110.21 million shares at 2 p.m.
on Wall Street.
   The Dow climbed higher on the opening but then spent much of the
morning struggling to remain in positive territory. Even when the
Dow rose, however, the broader market eased.
   The market drew strength from heavy trading in MCA, whose stock
erupted after it was disclosed the company is discussing a possible
buyout with Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. at a price
reported to be between $80 and $90 a share, or as high as $7.5
billion. MCA led the Big Board's most-active list, skyrocketing 21{
to 56.
   Michael Metz, a vice president at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. said the
news served as ``a tonic to speculators, who had nothing to feed
upon for a while.''
   Echoing that sentiment, Alfred E. Goldman, a vice president at
St. Louis-based A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc., noted that for ``the past
10 years, any time merger mania came back in the market, the
conclusion is that stocks are pretty cheap.''
   But he termed the rally ``puny,'' especially on the heels of
Monday's 60-point drop in the Dow. Today's rise is more an
indication that sellers are exhausted, he said, that a signal of
renewed interest in equities.
   Separately, the economic outlook dimmed as the government
reported a downward revision in second-quarter gross national
product figures.
   Among other actively traded issues, Paramount Communications
rode MCA's coattails, rising 2&rsqb; to 34; Philip Morris was up { at
44&rsqb;; Chase Manhattan Bank was up | at 11}, and IBM was up &rsqb; at
105&rsqb;.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 0.83 at 168.34. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was off 0.54 at 312.30.

<HEAD>Satellites Will Expand Communication for Airline Passengers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Communications Satellite Corp. said Tuesday
that beginning next year, it will offer telephone and data
communications to airlines for use by passengers flying anywhere in
the world.
   The company also is collaborating with Sony to develop a service
to display breaking news to passengers on international flights,
said Elizabeth L. Young, vice president of Comsat Aeronautical
Services. It expects to offer that service by 1991.
   By the end of next year, Comsat also expects to offer facsimile
service to air travelers.
   Sony Trans Com Inc. will provide the cabin display equipment and
Comsat will provide the satellite service.
   Comsat is a user and 25 percent owner of Inmarsat, the
International Maritime Satellite Organization, which operates
satellites around the globe for 60 member nations.
   ``We will be providing a digital news feed of 70 to 75 pages
with news type,'' Ms. Young said.
   GTE Airfone Inc., which supplies telephone services to 1,300
planes flying over the U.S. and Canada, has signed an agreement to
use Comsat's ground earth stations in Southbury, Conn., and Santa
Paula, Calif., for international flights. The use of satellites
will allow communication over oceans.
   Comsat announced last week that it had signed a long-term
agreement under which Aeronautical Radio Inc. will use Comsat
satellite facilities for operational and passenger communications
to airlines.
   ``United, Northwestern and American airlines signed,'' Ms. Young
said.
   Other American, European and Asian airlines are planning to
equip their planes for data and voice services, she said.
   Inmarsat will launch the first of four second-generation
satellites in October and three more in 1991, she said. Comsat will
bear 28 percent of the $650 million cost.

<TEXT>
   A hearing on conflict-of-interest allegations
against Neil Bush opened today with a judge rejecting a witness'
attempt to invoke the Fifth Amendment and offering to take
testimony in private. A second witness refused to talk voluntarily
and faced a subpoena.
   The federal Office of Thrift Supervision is trying to bar the
president's son from the banking and savings industry. The
regulators in February accused Neil Bush of wrongdoing in his
former role as a director of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan,
which failed in late 1988 at an cost to taxpayers of $1 billion. He
could be banned from the banking and savings industry.
   The president's 35-year-old son, a Denver oil and gas developer,
was not present when the hearing began today before a nearly full
courtroom. Bush, who adamantly denies wrongdoing, was expected to
be the final witness of 11 scheduled to testify this week.
   After the hearing was called to order today, former Silverado
Chairman Michael Wise asserted his Fifth Amendment right to refuse
to answer questions on the ground that he could incriminate
himself.
   Administrative Law Judge Daniel J. Davidson disagreed that the
right could be claimed at such a hearing, saying, ``I do have the
authority to require Mr. Wise to answer despite his claim to the
Fifth Amendment.''
   He then adjoured the opened hearing, and the participants went
into a closed session in his chambers.
   It was not immediately clear whether Wise agreed to testify in
private or continued to take the Fifth. Wise left the closed
hearing after about a half-hour and would not respond to reporters'
questions.
   Davidson had said that Wise's testimony in his chambers would be
on the record and that a transcript would be made available later,
probably at the end of today's hearing.
   Another former Silverado director scheduled to testify, Florian
Barth, today gave a letter to OTS lawyers saying he will not
testify voluntarily. Davidson promptly announced he would sign a
subpoena aimed at forcing Barth's testimony.
   The open hearing finally got under way with former Silverado
executive vice president Russell M. Murray. He answered questions
put by Bush's attorney, James Nesland, who attempted to show that
Murray was aware that Silverado had guidelines for approving loans
and lines of credit to board members.
   The OTS is seeking an order against Bush banning him from the
industry to avoid alleged conflicts of interest. The president has
said he will not interfere with the disciplinary process.
   Last week, Bush and other former Silverado directors were also
sued for $200 million by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The
lawsuit alleged that gross negligence on the part of Silverado
directors contributed to the S&amp;L's collapse.
   OTS contends Bush failed to disclose adequately to Silverado his
business relationships with Kenneth M. Good and Bill L. Walters,
two big borrowers from Silverado who defaulted on loans totaling
more than $130 million.
   The two Denver developers helped finance Bush's oil and gas
company, JNB Exploration, at the same time Bush voted on the men's
requests from Silverado for millions in loans and a line of credit,
the OTS has alleged.
   Bush could have avoided the hearing by agreeing not to dispute
the charges, as other S&amp;L officials have done. By fighting the
government, he has taken the case out of attorneys' and regulators'
offices into a rare public forum.
   ``The swords are drawn,'' his attorney, James Nesland, said
recently.
   The judge has until Dec. 6 to recommend a ruling to OTS Director
Timothy Ryan, who has until April 8 to make a final decision on
whether to impose the sanctions. Bush could appeal, most likely to
a federal appeals court in Denver.
   In his testimony today, Murray discussed a $900,000 line of
credit that Bush and Denver developer Kenneth Good obtained from
the Silverado board in 1986 for an oil and gas exploration
partnership in Argentina.
   The line of credit never was tapped, but the board's approval of
the request is one of the conflict-of-interest counts leveled by
the OTS against Bush, who voted as a board member on the
transaction.
   Murray said he talked to Good, Bush and Wise about the line of
credit and decided to submit the matter to the Silverado investment
committee and then to the Silverado board because of Bush's
involvement in the deal.
   ``I knew there were some limitations on loans to officers and
directors,'' Murray said.

<HEAD>Ailing Financier Fined in Guinness Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Multimillionaire financier Sir Jack Lyons was
fined 3 million pounds, or $5.6 million, Tuesday for his part in
the Guinness takeover scandal, but escaped a jail sentence because
of ill health.
   The judge also announced that Guinness Chairman Ernest Saunders,
sentenced to five years in the same case, would not have to face a
second trial on related charges because the prosecution had decided
it would not be in the public interest.
   At Southwark Crown Court, Judge Sir Denis Henry said Lyons was
``guilty of dishonesty on a major scale'' and could have expected a
three-year prison sentence.
   But after medical testimony that Lyons, 74, had cancer, heart
problems, high blood pressure and chronic bronchitis, the judge
said he would not send Lyons to jail.
   Lyons was ordered to pay 440,000 pounds ($831,000) toward
government legal costs.
   Lyons was convicted Aug. 27 on six counts of conspiracy to
commit fraud, false accounting and theft.
   He and three other figures in London's City financial district
were charged with organizing an illegal operation to boost the
stock market price of shares in Guinness during a successful
takeover battle for Distillers Co., a Scotch whisky and gin maker.
   The Distillers takeover involved buying large blocks of Guinness
shares to make them more attractive than those of rival bidder
Argyll, a supermarket operator.
   The prosecution claimed Guinness paid about 25 million pounds
($48 million at the time) in unlawful indemnities against losses in
share dealing and in fees for a successful outcome.
   Lyons bought Guinness shares for himself and clients and was
paid more than 3 million pounds ($5.8 million) in illegal success
fees and indemnities. He later repaid nearly 2 million pounds
(nearly $4 million) of the money he received.
   The other three tried with Lyons were sentenced earlier.
Saunders, 55, chairman and chief executive of the Guinness brewing
giant, received five years.
   Stockbroker Anthony Parnes, 45, was sentenced to 2{ years while
Gerald Ronson, 50, received one year and a record fine of 5 million
pounds ($9.75 million).

   Michael Milken's lawyer has asked the judge who
will sentence him for fraud to spare the former junk-bond king from
imprisonment and let him repent by helping inner-city youth, court
papers released today said.
   ``Such a sentence would constitute a most serious punishment;
but it would be purposeful punishment,'' wrote his lead attorney
Arthur Liman in a sentencing proposal to U.S. District Judge Kimba
Wood.
   He said Milken could work under the auspices of the Los Angeles
Police Department, near the financier's home, and that its chief
Daryl F. Gates supported the idea. It would ``not only embody the
concept of social restitution, but would also hold him fully
accountable and punish him for his behavior in the most appropriate
way,'' Liman said.
   The lawyer also asserted that Milken, 44, already has been
punished severely by nearly four years of intense public scrutiny,
payment of a record $600 million in fines and penalties and a bleak
future fighting civil lawsuits.
   ``We cannot adequately describe the anguish and devastation that
this experience has caused Michael, an intensely private and
sensitive individual,'' the memorandum said. ``Everyone who has
come into contact with him speaks of his acute pain and
suffering.''
   Liman's sentencing proposal portrayed Milken as a brilliant,
selfless family man who spurned the life of the rich and famous,
despite amassing enormous wealth in the securities industry over
nearly two decades.
   ``Michael's passion lies in his ideas. His life has been devoted
to seeking value for others ... For Michael, substantial
compensation was a by-product of his ideas,'' the defense said.
   The proposal was hundreds of pages long and was accompanied by
lengthy appendices with statements of support from more than 240
people ranging from close relatives and leading business figures to
Milken's family rabbi.
   Milken's lawyer released the sentencing proposal to Wood with
less than a week to go before she is scheduled to pronounce
punishment for Milken, the most influential financier of the 1980s
and the biggest figure to fall in the Wall Street securities fraud
scandal that broke in 1986.
   Such sentencing proposals are usually released on the day a
defendant is sentenced. But because of the enormous interest in the
Milken case, Wood ordered versions released early, edited to delete
incriminating references to others. The government was working to
make its version available later.
   Milken, former head bond trader at the once powerful Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., reversed longstanding claims of innocence and
pleaded guilty to six felonies in April. Most of the charges were
linked to his relationship with fallen stock speculator Ivan F.
Boesky.
   There has been intense speculation about what sentence will be
imposed by Wood, who has been swamped with letters both in support
of leniency and heavy punishment. He faces a maximum of 28 years in
prison.
   Wood has given no indication what she will do, but the
government has urged her to consider a vast array of unproven
crimes Milken allegedly committed.
   In its reply to the prosecution's sentencing memorandum, the
defense argued that the judge should not consider any evidence
relating to other alleged crimes. It also asked the court not to
punish the financier for the collapse of Drexel or in reaction to
his considerable wealth.
   The defense said the government's strategy of presenting
additional allegations prior to sentencing violated Milken's
constitutional rights.
   It also said that imposing a provisional sentence - subject to
possible reduction based on the value of Milken's cooperation with
the government's continuing investigation of insider trading -
would violate both his constutional rights and his earlier plea
agreement.

<HEAD>Trade Representative Complains About Northwest Loan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills, who is
complaining about European subsidies to Airbus Industrie, finds the
jet maker's loan to Northwest Airlines ``particularly disturbing,''
a spokeswoman said Tuesday.
   In a Sept. 14 letter to the European Community, Hills said she
wants ``clarification and information'' about the loan as soon as
possible, said spokeswoman Torie Clarke.
   Hills believes the $500 million loan was an unfair inducement to
get Northwest to buy 75 jets built by Airbus, a four-nation
European consortium.
   The United States has threatened to go to an international
tribunal, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, with
complaints about the $13 billion in government subsidies that
Airbus receives. Hills believes the subsidies are unfair to
American manufacturers.
   The loan ``is a new element of concern and the industry is quite
concerned,'' Clarke said.
   Hills has given the EC until Sunday to respond satisfactorily to
her complaint about Airbus subsidies, Clarke said.
   Representatives of Airbus and the EC deny the Northwest loan was
unfair.
   ``The facts as she states in the letter cannot be
substantiated,'' said Ella Krucoff, a spokeswoman for the EC
delegation in Washington.
   Alan Boyd, chairman of Airbus' North American division, said the
Northwest loan was strictly a commercial transaction financed by
private banks.
   Boyd told the Saint Paul (Minn.) Pioneer Press that the loan
follows a precedent established in 1987 when Boeing Co. bought $700
million in convertible notes from Allegis, then the parent company
to United Airlines, as part of a jet sale.
   Northwest, based in Eagan, Minn., must repay the loan within
seven years, Boyd said. He said it is secured with non-Airbus
aircraft and parts and the interest rate is not below 10 percent.

<TEXT>
   The Senate decided against cutting off debate
today on legislation requiring more fuel-efficient cars, a major
setback for a bill automakers claim would require them to stop
making large cars.
   The Senate rejected 57-42 a petition asking that the measure be
brought to a vote. Sixty votes were needed to cut off debate.
   The bill would require cars to achieve a fleet average of 35 mpg
by 1995 and 40 mpg by 2001. The bill's sponsor, Sen. Richard Bryan,
D-Nev., said that eventually would save 2.8 million barrels of oil
a day.
   Bryan had said he was optimistic about the legislation's passage
and argued the higher automobile fuel efficiency requirements were
needed to curb America's thirst for foreign oil.
   But opponents, led by Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., waged an
intense campaign against the measure, maintaining that the tougher
fuel economy requirements would lead to the production of smaller
cars and increased traffic deaths.
   The automakers in recent week lobbied intensely against the
legislation and auto industry unions sent thousands of telegrams to
senators urging the legislation not be approved.
   The measure's chances all along appeared brightest in the
Senate.
   Even some supporters expressed doubt that the bill would be
approved in the House, where it is staunchly opposed by Rep. John
Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee,
through which the bill normally must be channeled.
   Aides to President Bush have said they would recommend a veto if
the bill is approved by Congress.
   Late Monday, the Senate rejected 49-46 an amendment by Sen. Paul
Simon, D-Ill., that would have provided special unemployment aid
for workers who lose their jobs because automakers must shift to
producing more fuel-efficient vehicles.
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., a bill cosponsor, said the Simon
amendment would ``doom this bill'' because of many senators'
opposition to a worker assistance proposal.
   Meanwhile, an amendment was approved 55-40 to include new
incentives for automakers to produce vehicles that can run on
alternative fuels such as methanol, ethanol or compressed natural
gas. The measure would let manufacturers claim more credits against
fuel efficiency requirements if they produce such vehicles.
   The floor debate Monday centered on whether the high fuel
economy requirements would force manufacturers to dramatically
reduce the size of their cars and doom the future of the
six-passenger family sedan.
   ``It means smaller cars, it means less safe cars,'' declared
Riegle, whose state is home to the major U.S. automakers.
   Bryan disputed such claims, arguing that higher fuel efficiency
can be achieved without sacrificing car size. He noted that auto
executives made the same claims in the 1970s when faced with
tougher fuel economy requirements.
   ``That just didn't happen. The six-passenger vehicle is here
just as it was before,'' said Bryan.

<TEXT>
   From the boxing ring to the trading ring, Ray
Pace never has been one to back down.
   But in a federal courtroom that is the venue for his latest
confrontation, Pace fights the feeling that he is already whipped.
He says it's not because he has no hope of winning his case but
because the cost of his defense has nearly wiped him out.
   ``To see that everything you've saved is gone because of this
trial, it's a hard pill to swallow,'' said Pace, an amateur boxer
in the Chicago area from 1976 to 1981.
   Pace, 34, is one of 14 commodity traders from the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange standing trial on charges of defrauding
customers while executing their orders in the Merc's busy Japanese
yen futures pit.
   He also is accused of racketeering conspiracy, a charge that
carries a maxmimum penalty of 20 years in prison and possible
confiscation by authorities of his home and personal property.
   Pace is not a poor man. For several years before his indictment
in August 1989, he could gross more than $1,000 in commissions on a
good day working as a broker in the yen pit.
   But neither is he one of the relatively few millionaire
speculators personifying the popular perception of Chicago's
commodity traders as high-rolling fat cats with expensive German
cars and luxurious homes on the Lake Michigan shore.
   In an interview in his lawyer's office, Pace said he owns a 1988
Chevy Blazer and his wife Cleo, a real-estate broker, drives a 1988
Cadillac.
   He said their cars and their three-bedroom home in Westmont, a
middle-class suburb not far from his blue-collar hometown of
Cicero, are the only assets left to seize in the event of a
racketeering conviction.
   Like many of the total 47 traders and a clerk who were indicted
last year on commodity fraud charges in Chicago, Pace contends he
is a little fish caught in an indiscriminate FBI net.
   ``It could have been anybody who was down there filling orders
at that time,'' he said.
   Pace's defense is that he only did what everybody else was
doing. Defense attorney Steven Rosenberg told the U.S. District
Court jury in an opening statement Sept. 13 that Pace and every
other Merc trader routinely violated exchange rules. He said they
changed or invented the prices at which customer orders were
executed to repay other traders who absorbed their trading errors.
   Rosenberg said such rule violations did not constitute
racketeering, fraud or losses to customers. He said exchange
officials tolerated such activities, although they deny it.
   The son of a factory worker, Pace entered the risky world of
commodities trading after a dissatisfying stint as a high school
football and baseball coach. During part of that time, he was in
the boxing ring.
   ``I enjoyed it a lot but I just didn't see it financially,''
said the ruggedly handsome Pace, who remains physically fit. ``I
was making $13,000 or $14,000 my first year. I didn't know if I
wanted to stay in coaching for 25 years to start making some decent
money.''
   His wife was employed at that time by a commodities trading
firm. Another trading company offered Pace a job and he took it.
   He began in 1982 as a runner, carrying papers between the
trading pits and his company's desk on the Merc floor, for $150 a
week.
   Late in 1984, Pace passed a series of exams and received his
broker credentials. He took ajob as an assistant to a more
experienced broker who belonged to a broker association.
   Broker associations are groups of independent traders who fill
customer orders for the major brokerage houses. They pool a portion
of their commissions to pay their shared expenses.
   Pace's job was to stand next to his employer in the Merc's Swiss
franc futures pit, one of the pits that was later infiltrated by
FBI agents, and deal him the customer orders.
   Pace's salary rose to $200, then $300 a week. Most of it went
toward the exchange membership, or seat, that he leased through the
broker association for about $800 a month. The seat allowed him to
trade in the pit.
   ``I went through five to 10 grand of my own money to stay in
business at that time because I wasn't making enough to pay the
bills,'' he recalled.
   By 1988, Pace said he was making enough money from commissions
and personal trades to give up his salary. He leased a more
prestigious exchange seat for $3,500 a month and moved from the
Swiss franc pit to the more active Japanese yen pit.
   FBI agent Dietrich Volk also was in the yen pit in 1988, posing
as corrupt trader Peter Vogel while he secretly recorded
conversations among traders inside and outside the pit.
   Pace was indicted in August 1989 along with 20 other traders
from the yen pit, representing about one-fifth of the pit's normal
trader population. Seven of them have pleaded guilty to reduced
charges.
   Pace said his income has fallen dramatically since his
indictment while legal fees have consumed his life savings. He has
dropped back to the less expensive exchange membership and said his
wife is seeking work with a steadier income than real estate sales.
   Pace said he and several other indicted yen traders have
continued to fill customer orders despite the exchange's request
that they refrain from doing so. But his tradingThree new names were proposed
Tuesday for the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, including two that do away
with the word ``Soviet.''
   In a parliamentary debate on the union treaty that is being
drawn up between the Kremlin and the 15 Soviet republics, these
names were proposed: the Union of Sovereign Socialist States; the
Union of Soviet Sovereign Republics, and the Union of Euro-Asian
Republics.
   Rafik Nishanov, chairman of one of the Supreme Soviet's two
chambers and an ethnic Uzbek, revealed the names. He said the
proposed name change to the Union of Sovereign Socialist States,
first reported Sept. 8, came from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The Union of Soviet Sovereign Republics came from a group of
legislators from Kazakhstan.
   The Union of Euro-Asian Republics was one entry in a contest
organized by radical members of the parliament.
   The word ``Soviet'' is disliked by nationalist movements in some
republics because they consider the Soviets to be invaders who
forced them to accept Communist and Russian domination.
   Nishanov has said a name change may be approved as part of the
new union treaty, which is expected to redefine the country as
somewhere between a federation and an economic alliance. Action on
the treaty is expected before the end of the year.

<HEAD>Bush Announces Creation of Clearing House for Help to Needy
Countries</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush, decrying the ``staggering
burden'' suffered by many nations because of the Persian Gulf
crisis, today announced creation of an international clearing house
to coordinate financial help for needy countries.
   Bush announced the initiative at the annual meeting of the World
Bank and International Monetary Fund.
   Today's session opened with an announcement by World Bank
President Barber Conable of emergency plans to help resettle
hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing Iraq and Kuwait.
``Superpower rivalry has dissipated, but the gulf crisis poses an
obvious threat to world peace,'' Conable said.
   In his remarks, Bush said Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has had
devastating reprecussions, with serious disruptions in trade and
the flow of oil, as well as major problems with refugees and
displaced workers.
   ``This staggering burden, which is pressing upon these most
seriously affected countries, calls for a generous response from
the world community,'' Bush said.
   He said the United States already has begun to mobilize
financial help for front-line states, such as Egypt, Jordan and
Turkey, suffering as a result of a loss of trade with Iraq because
of sanctions against Baghdad.
   On a recent trip, Secretary of State James A. Baker III secured
promises of $20 billion in military and financial aid.
   Bush said that ``to transform commitments into concrete
contributions,'' he was establishing a Gulf Crisis Financial
Coordination Group ``with the aim of achieving effective, timely
and sustained financial support to these most seriously affected
countries.''
   The group will be under the chairmanship of Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady. Its members also will include Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Germany, Britain, Italy, France,
Japan, Canada, South Korea, the European Community and possibly
others.
   The IMF and World Bank will provide technical advice and
support.
   ``The political leadership of the U.N. must be matched by the
economic leadership of the IMF and the World Bank,'' Bush said.
   Top finance officials from 152 member nations and, for the first
time, an invited delegation from the Soviet Union, are attending
the meetings. Soviet representatives were not in earlier
closed-door, policy-making sessions, but sat toward the back of the
hall in the plenary session today.
   Soviet officials have said informally they want to join all
major international lending institutions, but the United States has
always opposed Soviet membership in the World Bank or the IMF.
   ``The bank is not a relief agency,'' Conable said in announcing
an emergency assistance program, ``but it can help by financing
expenditures for rehabilitation and other services which generate
immediate employment and income, while building productive
assets.''
   ``The World Bank is already taking action,'' he said. ``We have
the flexibility to respond quickly in such crises.''
   Conable said the bank also is taking other steps. These include
speeding up existing loan programs for countries affected by rising
oil prices and other results of Iraq's takeover of Kuwait.
   President Bush was to address the finance officials this
afternoon. The president planned to call on the IMF to show
economic leadership in the gulf crisis to match the political
leadership already taken by the United Nations, presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, told the delegates they
had to face critical questions in dealing with the gulf crisis.
They include what policies to adopt to ward off a global recession
and how to improve global trade and the international monetary
system.
   ``The crisis in the Middle East has reminded us all that peace
is fragile and that economies are always vulnerable,'' Camdessus
said.
   In closed-door sessions of world finance ministers who oversee
the institutions, both the bank and the IMF put together plans for
helping nations affected by Iraq's takeover of Kuwait and the
subsequent rise in oil prices.
   Details were being worked out, but the two institutions were
expected to supply billions of additional dollars to poor countries
hurt by the crisis.
   At a news conference Monday night, Conable declined to say how
much assistance the bank or the fund would provide in response to
the gulf crisis.
   ``You tell us how long the crisis is going to last and maybe we
can help you on that,'' he said in response to a reporter's
question.
   In the case of refugees, he said, it is difficult to predict how
many there might be, with 1 million or more still in Iraq and
Kuwait.
   The refugee workers had traveled to Iraq and Kuwait from
surrounding countries and from as far away as Korea and the
Philippines. Salaries sent to families at home are a significant
source of hard cash for the countries to buy goods abroad.
   In some countries, the workers will be returning to areas where
jobs and housing are scarce.
   Earlier Monday, the IMF's policymaking interim committee
promised in a communique that it would respond on an ``expedited
basis'' to the Mideast crisis.
   Among IMF programs that could be tapped for money is a
compensatory fund used in the past to aid nations hit by
earthquakes and hurricanes.

<HEAD>TVX Board Backs Sweetened Paramount Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paramount Communications Inc. raised
its offer Tuesday for the 17 percent of TVX Broadcast Group Inc.
stock it does not own to $9.50 a share from $7.50, and the TVX
board of directors recommended the offer.
   New York-based Paramount already owns 83 percent of TVX stock.
TVX owns and operates six independent television stations.
   The transaction would cost about $63 million, up from $53
million under the initial offer for the roughly 7.1 million shares
Paramount does not own.
   Completion of the transaction is subject to negotiating an
acquisition agreement and to approval of TVX shareholders at a
yet-to-be scheduled meeting.
   A special committee of independent TVX directors recommended
acceptance of the latest proposal, and the board accepted that
recommendation.
   Paramount, which has extensive holdings in movies and TV show
production as well as in publishing, is getting a foothold in the
broadcast television business with the TVX purchase.
   In September 1989, Paramount agreed to buy the 79 percent TVX
stake that the investment firm Salomon Brothers held in a deal
worth about $140 million.
   It subsequently bought another 4 percent, and offered in July to
buy the remainder at $7.50 a share. TVX's special committee
rejected that offer.
   In national over-the-counter trading Tuesday, TVX rose $1.25 a
share to $8.87{.
   ``With the acquisition of the remaining TVX capital stock, we
can now fully realize the outstanding potential of the TVX stations
which together have access to nearly 10 percent of the nation's
television viewers,'' Paramount said in a statement.
   The TVX stations are WTXF-TV, Philadelphia; WDCA-TV, Washington,
D.C.; KTXA-TV, Dallas; KTXH-TV, Houston; WLFL-TV, Raleigh-Durham,
N.C.; and KRRT-TV, San Antonio, Texas.

<TEXT>
   The president and chief executive
officer of Norton Co. has been forced from his job less than a week
after a French conglomerate completed a $1.95 billion takeover of
the abrasives firm.
   John M. Nelson played a key role in the takeover last spring by
Compagnie de Saint Gobain. But he resigned Monday at the first
meeting of Norton's new board of directors, saying he did so at the
request of the new owner.
   Michel L. Besson, a longtime Saint Gobain executive, was elected
to succeed Nelson. The company said Nelson, who has been with
Norton for 31 years, would remain as a consultant.
   Since 1980, Besson has been vice chairman, president and chief
executive officer of CertainTeed Corp. of Valley Forge, Pa., a
subsidiary of the Saint-Gobain Group.
   Norton is the world's leading manufacturer of abrasives and a
producer of engineering materials, including advanced ceramics,
performance plastics and chemical process products. The firm
employs 16,800 people and operates 92 plants in the United States
and 19 other countries.
   Saint Gobain ranks among the top industrial companies in the
world, with annual sales of more than $14 billion. It employs
88,000 people and operates 350 plants in the United States and 20
other countries.
   Amory Hall, a Saint Gobain spokesman, said the French firm asked
Nelson to resign because ``they thought it would be best to have
one president of the American operations.'' He said he did not
expect large scale layoffs at Norton.

   Boise Cascade Corp. said Tuesday it has
tightened its procedures to head off unsolicited takeover bids.
   The Boise-based wood products company announced it has reduced
the amount of stock a single person or group can obtain before
triggering the compay's shareholder rights plan.
   Under the revisions, the plan will be triggered if a person or
group obtains 15 percent of the company's voting securities, down
from 20 percent.
   ``The revised plan encourages a potential acquirer to negotiate
with the board of directors earlier than was likely under the
previous plan,'' the company said in a statement.
   The new plan also lowers from 25 percent to 15 percent the
amount of stock ownership that will trigger a process under which
stockholders can exercise their right to acquire additional shares
of stock at a market value equal to twice the exercise price of the
right.
   Company officials said they adopted the revisions so they could
better represent stockholder interests in the face of a takeover
bid.

   The stock market rallied today as investors
focused on blue chip issues at the expense of the broader market.
   Analysts said the market was ripe for an advance after the Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials fell to a 14-month low in the
previous session. But today's gains were spotty, and market
watchers doubted the advance would be sustained.
   Investors prefered blue chip issues because of their ``high
visibility of earnings and growth,'' said Charles Jensen, chief
technical analyst at MKI Securities Corp. But the broader market
languished.
   While investors went bargain hunting, the market drew support
from a number of factors, including the possibility that there will
be a resolution this week on the budget deficit, a firming bond
market the fact that stock prices remained buoyant despite Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze's assessment that war could
break out at ``any moment'' in the Middle East.
   Separately, enthusiasm for potential takeover targets was
rekindled by hectic trading in MCA, whose stock skyrocketed after
it was disclosed the company is discussing a possible buyout with
Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. at a price reported to
be between $80 and $90 a share, or as high as $7.5 billion.

<HEAD>The Wind Alone Could Meet America's Energy Appetite, a Study Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With oil approaching $40 a barrel, a group of
energy visionaries said Tuesday that a study finds America windy
enough to provide all the energy the country needs - if only it
would harness the breezes.
   The American Wind Energy Association met in convention to
promote wind power - already providing one-tenth of 1 percent of
the nation's electricity - as one answer to energy crises like
those generated by the upheaval in the Persian Gulf.
   Dale Osborn, president of U.S. Windpower, Inc., said wind is not
only plentiful but also ``environmentally benign'' - abundant,
clean, non-polluting and domestic. His California company that has
sold 2 billion kilowatt hours of wind-generated electricity since
1982.
   The turbines wind turns emit no carbon dioxide, the villain in
acid rain, and don't contribute to the greenhouse effect, the
warming of the atmosphere.
   At a news conference, Osborn, president-elect of the
association, called wind power ``a proven, functioning and
ever-increasing economic success.''
   The study, conducted for the Energy Department by Pacific
Northwest Laboratories, a unit of Battelle Memorial Institute,
establishes ``the immense potential of wind energy to meet
America's energy needs,'' said Randall Swisher, the organization's
executive director.
   The study said 1.5 percent of the area of the 48 contiguous
states has usable winds averaging 16 mph or more at 50 meters above
the ground, the wind speed generally needed to produce electricity
competitively.
   That's the average speed of the winds that turn the 15,000
turbines already in commercial use in California, the world's wind
energy pioneer.
   Swisher said North Dakota and Texas together offer enough wind
to replace the energy produced by two billion barrels of oil,
making each of those states a ``virtual Saudi Arabia of wind.''
   If both were fully utilized, they would provide 80 percent of
the nation's electricity, he said.
   The report said California has developed only one-fifth of its
areas with 16 mph winds. They produce 2.2 billion kilowatts a year,
the equivalent of 3.5 million barrels of oil, somewhat less than
half of one day's imports.
   But California's wind potential is exceeded in 13 other states -
North Dakota, Texas, Kansas, Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska,
Wyoming, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Iowa, Colorado, New Mexico and Idaho
- and equalled in three others, New York, Illinois and Michigan,
the study said.
   Only four states - Alabama, Mississippi, Florida and Louisiana -
were found to lack ``commercial wind potential,'' Swisher said.
   New technology soon will make it possible for winds that blow at
an average of only 14 mph winds to produce commercial electricity,
Swisher said.
   He said the report established that - theoretically, at least -
the United States has enough harnessable wind to produce 100
billion quadrillion BTUs of energy a year. The country consumes 82
billion quadrillion BTUs.
   But investment costs and storage and transmission problems are
barriers and esthetic concerns rule out some windy landscapes as
the sites of wind turbines, Swisher said.
   So a realistic goal is for wind to provide 10 to 20 percent of
the nation's electricity over the next 20 to 30 years, he said.
   The downside is that wind is ``intermittent'' - it blows on and
off - so wind power ``needs to be integrated with other
technologies'' to make sure electricity is on hand when it is
wanted, he added.
   But developments in storing electric power are coming along fast
enough, he said, ``to render the problem of intermittence
irrelevant.''
   What's more, said Carl Weinberg, research manager for Pacific
Gas and Electric, ``we have learned that utilities can manage
energy sources turned off by nature just as well as we manage
energy sources turned off by man.''
   Osborn said that potentially, at least, wind power could provide
all the nation's energy, But he shies from making that claim, he
said, because ``our credibility will be challenged. People would
say, `There go those wild-eyed Californians again.'''

   The Spanish airline Iberia and
its Argentine partner have three days to come up with a $130
million down payment for the national carrier Aerolineas
Argentinas, or lose the bid, the Public Works minister said
Tuesday.
   Minister Jose Dromi told a congressional committee that
President Carlos Menem told him to convey that message to the
consortium, the private news agency Noticias Argentinas reported.
   Iberia and the small Argentine airline Cielos del Sur agreed to
buy an 85 percent stake in the airline for $130 million in cash
plus the assumption of $2 billion in face value of Argentina's
foreign debt.
   The group presented a letter of credit, arguing it did not want
to tie up the cash until the government fulfilled it obligation to
obtain permission for the sale of a national asset from commercial
creditors owed $46 billion.
   Opponents of the sale, including congressional members, claim
the consortium lacks funds and is trying to buy the airline using
its own assets instead of new capital.
   Iberia and Cielos del Sur have acknowledged they intend to sell
and then lease back some of Aerolineas' planes to generate revenue.

   A leading maker of computer data storage systems
unveiled a new device Tuesday it says represents the next
generation of such technology.
   The system from EMC Corp. of Hopkinton, Mass., is designed to
allow computers to get at information more quickly and reliably
than traditional computer storage devices called hard disks.
   The new storage system, called redundant arrays of inexpensive
disks, or RAID, takes up less space than traditional hard disks
while providing faster processing speeds and better reliability,
EMC said at a news conference here. The device costs $240,000 to
$400,000.
   EMC, a major supplier of storage devices for International
Business Machines Corp. computers, said it was introducing its
device at least 18 months ahead of similar systems planned by other
manufacturers.
   Traditional mainframe computer storage devices consist of a
single ``hard'' disk, a 14-inch magnetic device weighing about 144
pounds. The new EMC technology combines several 5\-inch, 10-pound
magnetic disks with a computerized controller that pulls data off
the disks and another device that can temporarily store
frequently-used data.

   Marriott Corp. announced Tuesday it will
delay construction starts on most of its new projects, including
hotels and senior citizens housing units, following a review of its
financial position.
   William J. Shaw, executive vice president and chief financial
officer, said Marriott would reduce its capital expenditures by
approximately $650 million in 1991, compared to a $1.3 billion
outlay in 1990.
   A statement said the action was taken because a slowing economy
had created a glut of hotel rooms.
   ``We believe this delay .. will provide us with an extra margin
of flexibility in the present uncertain financial, real estate and
lodging markets,'' Shaw said.
   The company sold approximately $900 million in assets so far
this year, and Shaw said the firm expects to sell another $700
million in assets in the next few months.
   The company's financial situation has already forced the layoffs
of 70 workers at its headquarters.
   Shaw also commented on a move by Standards &amp; Poor's Corp., on
Monday placing certain Marriott single A-minus-rated long term debt
on CreditWatch with negative implications.
   ``Obviously, we're disappointed with...the action,'' Shaw said.
``We have financial flexibility as well as strong, stable cash
flow.''

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Ahead in U.S.; Gold Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar advanced in the United States Tuesday
against all major currencies except the Japanese yen, which took
center stage on world foreign exchange markets.
   Gold prices pulled back slightly in domestic dealing but moved
sharply higher abroad.
   Strength in the dollar came largely as a reaction to a selloff
Monday against every major currency but the yen.
   David Marshall, chief currency analyst at MMS International
Inc., said the dollar benefited from technical factors linked to
cross trading between the yen and the German mark.
   Comments by an unidentified West German finance ministry
official, carried on news services, also sparked yen purchases.
   Concern about the consequences that rising oil prices could have
on the Japanese economy, which depends heavily on imported oil,
lately had caused dealers to dump yen mostly in favor of European
currencies.
   In an interview with a small group of reporters, the German
government official said the yen could appreciate further against
the mark. He also said that he did not foresee a ``free-fall'' in
the dollar, a statement that tended to boost demand for dollars.
   A rebound on Wall Street, combined with a steadying in oil and
gold prices in New York, also renewed interest in dollars, Marshall
said.
   The dollar's trading day began in Tokyo with a decline to 136.70
yen from 137.33 yen at Friday's close. Japanese markets were closed
Monday for a national holiday. Later, the dollar was quoted at
136.50 yen in London and at 136.70 yen late in New York, down from
137.50 yen late Monday.
   The British pound lost ground, falling to $1.8765 late in London
from late Monday's $1.8810. A pound was quoted at $1.8785 late in
New York, down from $1.8805 late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's late
quotes, included: 1.5735 German marks, up from 1.5595; 1.3080 Swiss
francs, up from 1.2980; 5.2665 French francs, up from 5.2210;
1.15055 Canadian dollars, up from 1.14975; and 1,177.00 Italian
lire, up from 1,167.75.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's levels
were: 1.5630 German marks, up from 1.5565; 1.2990 Swiss francs, up
from 1.2965; 5.2340 French francs, up from 5.2145; 1.7618 Dutch
guilders, down from 1.7665; 1,168.25 Italian lire, up from
1,165.50; and, 1.1493 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1483.
   Precious metals dealers in Europe said their markets were busy
but trading was choppy as operators tried to carve out a new
trading range followin a surge through $400 an ounce.
   Dealers said if there is no improvement in the Middle East
conflict they expect gold to continue firming.
   But, after a strong session Monday, gold and silver prices
posted modest declines in the United States.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold settled at $402.40 a
troy ounce for the September contract, off 60 cents from Monday.
Later, Republic National Bank quoted an ounce of gold bullion at
$401.25, $1.25 lower than Monday's 4 p.m. EDT bid.
   Gold closed in London at a bid of $403.25 a troy ounce, up from
$396.55. The late Zurich bid was $404.25, up from $392.90. Earlier
in Hong Kong, gold closed at $405.85, up from Monday's late
$389.75.
   Silver prices finished lower. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery fell to $4.834 a troy ounce from
$4.915 on Monday. Silver bullion closed in London at a bid of $4.87
a troy ounce, down from $4.89 Monday.

   Federal workers who usually disregard the
political rhetoric of the annual budget brouhaha fear the threat of
mass furloughs and pay cuts may be real this year.
   ``People are literally losing sleep over this,'' said Tom
Doherty, an Occupational Safety and Health Administration inspector
from Allentown, Pa.
   ``They have kids to feed and house payments to make, and now
they're having the rug swept out from under them by the system they
work for,'' Doherty said.
   The cuts, should they occur, would mark the first
government-wide furloughs since 1986.
   Most of the nation's 2.2 million federal employees already have
been warned they may be furloughed 22 days or more in fiscal 1991
if Congress and the White House fail to agree on a deficit
reduction plan before the Oct. 1 deadline.
   The forced, unpaid days off would be part of $85 billion in cuts
to be triggered Monday by the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law.
Additional cuts would follow.
   The Office of Management and Budget has said the cuts would mean
a 32.4 percent spending reduction in non-defense areas. Among those
exempt from the cuts would be all presidential appointees, active
military personnel and some medical personnel at VA hospitals.
   ``At first, everybody was like, `Oh, boy, here we go again.' But
when you hear President Bush talking about tightening your belt and
pitching in, it seems a lot more serious,'' Doherty said.
   On Tuesday, the House Appropriations Committee ignored President
Bush's veto threat voted to delay for 20 days deep spending cuts -
including those that could bring the mass furloughs - that will be
triggered unless Congress and the White House agree on a
deficit-reduction plan.
   The House is expected to consider the bill later this week.
   At the White House, an angry Bush told reporters: ``If there is
no budget agreement with real spending reductions and real process
reform by the end of the week, I will have to veto it.''
   Agencies have come up with different layoff plans.
   Some OSHA offices, for example, would have workers take two days
off each week for 11 weeks to get the cuts over with as quickly as
possible. Doherty said that would cost him about $568 every pay
period through December.
   Government services, in turn, would be trimmed dramatically.
   A cutback in air traffic controllers would will mean canceled
flights and lengthy airport delays; fewer guards would man the
nation's prisons; meat and poultry inspectors would miss shifts;
Medicare and Social Security checks could be delayed.
   ``Right now, a large percentage of federal employees don't
believe that it's really going to happen, or that it would only
last a day or so if it did because Congress will pass a resolution
or something to take care of it,'' said Dwight Bowman, a
Smithsonian photographer active in the American Federation of
Government Employees.
   But Bowman said this year's cuts appear more likely in light of
the overall state of the nation's economy, the savings and loan
crisis and the American military buildup in the Middle East caused
by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   ``There's just a lot of reasons to think that this is serious,''
Bowman said.
   Workers, many of whom already feel underpaid and unappreciated,
say the possibility of cuts have hurt morale.
   ``We're responsible for the safety and health of workers in four
counties,'' Doherty said. ``It's notsomething you do for just a
paycheck, but also because you believe in it.
   ``When your employer kicks you in the teeth like this, it makes
you kind of lose that enthusiasm for what you're doing,'' Doherty
said,
   Rose Seaman, who processes Social Security claims in Akron,
Ohio, said budget negotiators don't realize how damaging the cuts
will be, especially for couples who both work for the government.
Her husband is a federal meat inspector.
   ``The pay will stop but rent's the same, child care's the same,
gas for your car is the same or going up,'' she said. ``This is not
a `Poor Rose and George thing.' ... We're just working people out
here in the heartland trying to do a job and get paid for it.''
   Mike Grotefend, a union leader for federal prison workers based
at the 800-inmate facility in Oxford, Wis., said morale there is at
an all-time low and that employees ``feel like ... pawns.''
   Most prison guards make between $22,000 and $24,000 a year.
   ``These people have car payments and house payments. The horror
stories are already starting to get around,'' he said.
   ``We're trying to look at providing some relief within the
union, but how do you administer something on such a grand scale
when you have so little for so many?''

   Cracks inside the shafts of 12 Pratt &amp;
Whitney PW4000 jet engines have prompted a federal investigation
into why the problems occurred and why the flaws were not detected
immediately during inspections.
   Pratt, the jet-engine division of Hartford's United Technologies
Corp., publicly acknowledged the potentially disastrous problem
Monday after several industry sources alerted The Hartford Courant
about the cracks, the newspaper reported Tuesday in a copyright
article.
   The Federal Aviation Administration is expected to release
within the next week the findings of its investigation, launched
earlier this month after Pratt alerted the agency that cracks had
been found.
   One of the engines had been in service before it was grounded.
Pratt spokesman Mark Sullivan would not identify the airline that
had used the defective engine.
   ``(We) expect to present a solution to the industry in the next
four to five days,'' said Michael Ciccarelli, spokesman for the
FAA's regional office in Burlington, Mass.
   The defective shafts had cleared inspections at Pratt and at
LeFiell Manufacturing Co., the California subcontractor that forged
the engine shafts for Pratt, the newspaper said.
   In addition to the engine that had entered service, two with
cracked shafts were shipped to Boeing Co. in Seattle, and one to
Airbus Industrie in Toulouse, France, for installation on their
jumbo passenger jets.
   The other eight were in various stages of assembly at Pratt's
plants in Connecticut. Most of the cracks were big enough to have
been seen with the naked eye.
   Sullivan said his company sent a letter to all its customers
advising them of the cracks.
   He said Pratt is completing emergency inspections on 174 engines
delivered to aircraft builders and air carriers around the world.
Most have been inspected, with only the 12 found defective.
   ``We're confident that we reacted very quickly,'' Sullivan said.
``And we see no problems to our airline customers or their
passengers.''

   The stock market rallied Tuesday as
institutional investors snapped up blue-chip issues, but analysts
dismissed the advance as insignificant.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 32.67 to close at
2,485.64. The move erased roughly half the loss the key barometer
registered in the previous session, when it settled at a 14-month
low.
   Advancing issues only slightly outpaced decliners in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 770 up, 745
down and 471 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 155.94 million
shares, down from 162.21 million in the previous session.
   ``It's not the kind (of volume) that suggests there's a stampede
into stocks,'' said Hugh Johnson, senior vice president at First
Albany Corp.
   Analysts said the market was poised for a rebound given the
sharp selloff in the previous session. But Johnson joined a number
of other market watchers in characterizing the day's advance as
``puny'' and ``unsustainable.''
   As investors focused on blue-chip issues, the broader market
languished. ``Given the tentative nature of the rally, a lot more
needs to happen before you can say things have turned around,''
Johnson said.
   A number of factors worked to support quality stocks, namely
moderately higher prices in the bond market, where a downward
revision in the second-quarter gross national product supported the
notion that the Federal Reserve would be encouraged to lower
interest rates. In addition, lower oil prices also took some
pressure off both the stock and bond markets.
   Separately, enthusiasm for potential takeover targets was
rekindled by heavy trading in MCA, whose stock skyrocketed after it
was disclosed the company is discussing a possible buyout with
Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. at a price reported to
be between $80 and $90 a share, or as high as $7.5 billion.
   MCA led the Big Board's most-active list, skyrocketing 19{ to
54. The activity in MCA, which had been up as much as 25, spilled
over to other entertainment issues. Paramount Communications, the
third most-active issue, jumped 3\ to 34~.
   Michael Metz, a vice president at Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said MCA's
news served as ``a tonic to speculators, who had nothing to feed
upon for a while.''
   Among other actively traded Big Board issues, Philip Morris rose
1 to 44~; Chase Manhattan Bank was up ~ at 12; General Electric
gained 1&lsqb; to 55|, and IBM was up 1&rsqb; at 106&rsqb;.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 186.45 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $26.21 billion, or 0.91
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.69 to 169.20.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 4.44 to 363.73, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index adfanced 3.67 to 308.26.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
2.62 to 354.78. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 313.17, up 0.33.

   The government on Tuesday turned down a request by
Polly Peck International PLC for an official investigation into its
share dealings.
   The company's board made the request in a letter Sunday to John
Redwood, parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Department
of Trade and Industry, following extensive articles about the
company in London's Sunday newspapers.
   The company's shares crashed 55 percent last Thursday on rumors
of a possible Serious Fraud Office investigation into the company.
Later that day, company chairman Asil Nadir was interviewed by the
office, which investigates and prosecutes cases of serious fraud.
   On Thursday, the London Stock Exchange agreed to the company's
request to halt dealings in its shares, which slumped by 135 pence
($2.50) to 108 pence ($2).
   The stock has fallen sharply since August after Nadir attempted
a buyout of the company and withdrew it after five days. British
newspaper reports alleged the share price may have been supported
illegally.
   Redwood said he was satisfied the Serious Fraud Office had the
necessary powers to investigate all the allegations ``of which we
are aware.''

<DATELINE>STOUGHTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reebok International Ltd. forecast
Tuesday a third quarter drop in profits due to declining U.S.
footware sales and higher advertising costs.
   The sneaker manufacturer said it expects third-quarter earnings
to be 33 to 35 cents per share, about 25 percent lower than the 44
cents per share earned the comparable period last year.
   Sales were off because the company took action to stop its
high-priced sneakers from ending up in discount stores, said chief
executive Paul Fireman.
   Distribution problems with The Pump model this year hurt sales
and raised expenses, said Richard Newman, executive vice president
of Investor Access Corp. in New York. The sneaker allows the wearer
to pump air into the shoe.
   Newman said company officials estimated that cutting off sales
to ``diverters'' - buyers who send Reebok shoes to discount outlets
- will cost the company about $20 million in the third quarter.
   Delays in shipping The Pump resulted in another $20 million loss
in sales, he said.
   The company said it expects sales to rebound in the next
quarter. The backlog of orders is up 15 percent over the past five
months compared to the same period in 1989, officials said.

   Closer inspections and stiffer
penalties await coal mine operators who fail to emphasize safety,
Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said Tuesday.
   Mrs. Dole issued the warning on the final day of the United Mine
Workers' 100th anniversary convention.
   She said her agency is using a new computer program to target
mines with a high risk of explosion or fire.
   She also said inspectors from the federal Mine Safety and Health
Administration have orders to pinpoint companies that ``continue to
endanger their workers despite repeated warnings.''
   Mine managers who fail to maintain a safe and healthful
workplace, ``believe me, will run afoul of the Department of
Labor,'' Mrs. Dole said. ```MSHA, after all, was chartered to be an
enforcement agency, not a guidance counselor.''
   Prior to adjournment, UMW President Richard Trumka announced
contract negotiations will resume Oct. 3 between the union and
Decker Coal Co. in southern Montana. About 220 Decker workers have
been on strike for three years.
   The talks will be the first in two years.
   Union miners praised Mrs. Dole for helping to settle the
10-month Pittston strike this year. As part of the settlement, she
appointed a special commission to offer solutions to the UMW's
troubled health care program for retired miners.
   She had little to say about the commission's findings. A final
report is expected next month.
   The 1,000 UMW delegates have been meeting at the Fountainebleau
Hotel since Sept. 17. Before heading home, miners were urged ``to
get up out of the trenches and get offensive and attack and get
going.''
   United Steelworkers President Lynn Williams also reinterated the
convention's theme: solidarity. By sticking together, organized
labor can rebound from the 1980s, when Reagan administration
policies sent many unions into retreat.
   The convention ended with a concert of mine-related songs,
including ``Which Side Are You On'' and ``Solidarity Forever.''

<TEXT>
   Sales of existing homes rose 2.1 percent in
August, continuing an upward trend that began in June, a real
estate trade group said Tuesday.
   The National Association of Realtors said home resales totaled a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.40 million units compared to
July's revised 3.33 million rate. Sales rose 0.9 percent in June
from the 1990 low of 3.30 million units in May.
   But mortgage rates jumped back into double digits in August.
Realtors chief economist John A. Tuccillo predicted rates would
continue to rise during most of the fourth quarter, having a
negative impact on sales.
   Realtors President Norman A. Flynn attributed any strength to
``people who are buying homes in less populous areas and
recreational areas.''
   According to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., fixed-rate,
30-year mortgage rates rose from an average of 9.84 percent to
10.24 percent in August. They averaged 10.16 percent at the end of
last week.
   The Realtors also said the national median existing-home price
was $97,000 in August, down 1.3 percent from July but up 1.3
percent from a year earlier. The median means half of the homes
cost more, half less.
   Sales rose in the South and Midwest, but fell on both coasts.
They were up 6.9 percent to 1.40 million units in the South, where
the median price was $86,900. They rose 2.2 percent to 950,000
units in the Midwest. The median price there was $75,000.
   But in the Northeast, where housing activity has been sluggish
for months, sales fell 1.8 percent to 550,000 units. The median
price in the Northeast was $144,900. They dropped 3.8 percent to
530,000 units in the West, where the median price was $141,600.

<HEAD>Persian Gulf Crisis Curbs Corporate Securities Issues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Persian Gulf crisis put a further damper on
the already depressed market for new issues of corporate securities
in the third quarter, a business research firm said Tuesday.
   Initial public offerings of common stock fell to $1.5 billion
from June through September, their lowest level in five years,
according to Securities Data Corp. That brought the nine-month
tally of IPOs to $8.4 billion, down 13 percent from 1989's slow
pace.
   The volume of all common stock issues for the first three
quarters totaled $16 billion, only $1 billion ahead of the slack
volume of a year earlier. Securities Data did not provide figures
for the third quarter alone.
   The New Jersey-based company attributed the slump to Middle East
tensions that caused oil prices to soar and stock and bond prices
to plunge and made investors wary of the financial markets.
   The volume of new issues of corporate debt excluding mortgage
and asset-backed securities also fell, Securities Data said,
attributing the slide not only to the Persian Gulf conflict but
also to the growing federal deficit, increased levels of defaults
on loans and higher interest rates.
   For the first nine months of the year, $72.1 million in debt was
issued, down 28 percent from a year earlier. Securities Data did
not provide figures for the third quarter alone.
   The analysis also ranked underwriters of corporate securities by
volume. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. led all other investment firms during
the first nine months, underwriting nearly $35.3 million in U.S.
securities.
   Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., with nearly $29.6 million in underwritten
securities was ranked second, with First Boston Corp. third with
nearly $23.5 million.

<TEXT>
   Commonwellth Edison Co. agreed Tuesday to a
one-year extension of its franchise to provide electricity to
Chicago customers, company officials said.
   Edison's old contract expires Dec. 31, but a string of power
failures have raised questions about the utility's reliability as
it has been trying to negotiate its first new franchise with
Chicago in 42 years.
   ``While we had hoped to reach agreement on a new franchise
before Dec. 31, an extension will preserve what we believe is
already the best set of benefits held by any major city in the
country,'' Edison Chairman James J. O'Connor said in a prepared
statement.
   The extension will ensure Edison's continued payment of its
municipal franchise fee of 4 percent of the company's gross
revenues. The 1990 payment is estimated at $66 million, O'Connor
said.
   Chicago Mayor Richard Daley expected the move and was pleased
that the utility agreed to continue dialogue while the Illinois
Commerce Commission and the city investigate recent power failures,
said Daley spokeswoman Carolyn Grisko.

<HEAD>Gold Holds Own Despite Oil's Drop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices held nearly steady Tuesday despite a drop in
energy prices and similar reversals in other markets that usually
are regarded as signposts for the precious metals.
   Silver and platinum futures fell sharply, though, lending
support to the growing perception that gold is losing its
traditional appeal as a store of value during times of rising
consumer prices and international political turmoil.
   On other commodity markets, livestock and meat futures were
mostly lower, and grains and soybeans were mixed.
   Gold futures settled 50 cents to 70 cents lower on New York's
Commodity Exchange with the contract for delivery in September at
$402.40 a troy ounce. Silver futures ended 8 cents to 8.8 cents
lower with September at $4.834 a troy ounce.
   Platinum futures fell $7.70 to $8.90 on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for September delivery finished at
$451 a troy ounce.
   Analysts had no problem explaining the declines in silver and
platinum as reactions to the government's report that the economy
grew at a barely perceptible 0.4 percent annual rate in the second
quarter.
   The white metals are used in a variety of manufactured products,
so the report of unexpectedly slow growth led to expectations for
reduced silver and platinum consumption, said Bette Raptopoulos,
metals analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Harder to assess was gold's relatively strong performance in
light of sharply lower oil prices, sharply higher stock prices and
a stronger dollar vs. European currencies - all reversals of the
factors that were viewed as contributing to gold's strong advance
Monday.
   John Jonat, a precious metal trader with the New York-based
metal and currency dealer Deak International Inc., said gold's
stubbornness was further evidence of a change in investor attitudes
toward the metal.
   But he and others were at a loss to define what Jonat called ``a
new school'' of thought about gold. Some believe investors are
turning to other markets as safe havens against inflation. Some
concede they just don't know.
   ``It's a real confusing market to call,'' Jonat said.
``Something's changing here - it's not the same old rules.''
   Prices for near-term deliveries of crude oil and petroleum
products fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange as the likelihood
of war in the Middle East seemed to fade.
   After the close, the American Petroleum Institute released a
weekly report that confirmed perceptions of a decline last week in
U.S. supplies of crude oil and an increase in heating oil stocks.
   Gasoline stock rose by more than 5 mllion barrels, which
exceeded expectations.
   Light sweet crude oil settled 72 cents lower to 1.25 cents
higher with the November contract down 72 cents at $37.53 a barrel;
heating oil was 2.72 cents lower to 3.11 cents higher with October
down 2.72 cents at $1.012 a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 2.18
cents lower to .76 cent higher with October down 2.18 cents at
$1.0205 a gallon.
   Cattle futures extended Monday's losses on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange amid ideas that demand for beef will slow if
the economy weakens further.
   Hog futures also fell, largely reflecting profit-taking after
last week's strong gains.
   Live cattle were .02 cent to .70 cent lower with October at
78.55 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .23 cent to .55 cent lower
with September at 89.02 cents a pound; live hogs were unchanged to
.45 cent lower with October at 54.80 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .15 cent lower to .20 cent higher with February at
56.52 cents a pound.
   Soybean futures rose but most corn and wheat futures fell in a
lackluster session on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat settled 1} cents lower to \ cent higher with December at
$2.74} a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to 2{ cents higher with
December at $2.27} a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 2\ cents higher
with December at $1.14{ a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 6 cents
higher with November at $6.17{ a bushel.

   A U.S. magistrate fined Nippon Steel Corp.
$10,000 for failing to disclose information in Allegheny Ludlum
Corp.'s patent lawsuit against the Japanese steel maker, Allegheny
Ludlum said Tuesday.
   Allegheny Ludlum has accused Nippon Steel of infringing on
Allegheny Ludlum's patent for melting and heating a high-grade,
magnetic steel used in electricity transformers and generators.
   The civil trial is scheduled to begin in November in U.S.
District Court in Philadelphia.
   U.S. Magistrate Edwin Naythons ruled Nippon was in contempt of
court for violating an order requiring Nippon to produce
information related to the case, Allegheny Ludlum said. Nippon has
until Oct. 5 to pay the fine.
   ``A contempt finding is rare, particularly against a foreign
corporation,'' said Allegheny Ludlum attorney John Williams.
   The high-grade steel patent Allegheny Ludlum is seeking to
protect in the lawsuit accounted for $200 million of the company's
$1.2 billion in 1989 sales, said company spokesman Bert Delano.

   Janice Walsh was eager to take the Nissan
300ZX for a test drive. Like many potential buyers, she wants ``a
car that's fun,'' regardless of its gas mileage. Automakers are
giving her what she wants.
   Mileage statistics for 1991 model cars released Tuesday by the
Environmental Protection Agency show virtually no gains in average
fuel efficiency since 1987 with more than half the cars getting
fewer than 23 miles per gallon.
   While midsize and many of the ``performance'' cars such as the
Nissan 300ZX are getting much better mileage today than a decade
ago, the EPA said ``overall fleet fuel economy figures have
increased only slightly'' since 1982.
   Over the last five model years, the average fleet figures have
been stuck at about 28 mpg. The EPA said the 1991 models about to
be introduced average 28.1 mpg, a shade higher than last year, but
no better than figures for 1987.
   Down the road from where Ms. Walsh and her young son eyed the
Nissan that gets 18 mpg in the city, John Webb and his wife looked
over a Mercury Grand Marquis - a big car with a V-8 engine and a
cavernous trunk.
   ``When we travel we want a good size car and lots of trunk
space,'' said Webb, a retiree who says the Marquis fits the bill
although its city mileage is a thirsty 17 mpg.
   ``We really haven't talked about mileage,'' Webb said.
   The Persian Gulf crisis has prompted renewed efforts in Congress
to require automakers to improve fuel economy.
   But Tuesday, the Senate voted 57-42 to block legislation that
would require automakers to dramatically increase the average
mileage of their fleets to 40 mpg by 2001, a 40 percent increase
from today's average of about 28 mpg. The vote ended any chance the
bill will pass this year.
   President Bush had threatened to veto the bill if it had cleared
Congress and there was formidable opposition in the House as well.
   Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen and a frequent
critic of the auto industry, accused automakers of pushing ``bigger
engines, more muscle and acceleration which they call performance''
instead of trying to make cars more fuel efficient.
   ``They want to sell speed instead of fuel economy,'' said
Clarence Ditlow, head of the Washington-based Center for Auto
Safety. ``The performance cars are the higher priced cars and the
ones with more options and more profits.''
   But those in the auto business say they're only giving the
customer what he or she wants.
   ``It's not the industry pushing performance. It's the consumer
that's been demanding it in the last few years,'' argues Ray Turk,
the Nissan salesman at Herb Gordon AutoWorld in suburban Maryland
where Ms. Walsh was shopping.
   As in previous years, the 1991 models reflected a wide range of
mileage from the minicompact Geo Metro that gets 58 mpg on the
highway and only slightly less in city driving to the luxurious
two-seater Lamborghini Diablo that guzzles at 9 mpg on city
streets.
   In between are about 1,000 models and variations of models of
cars, trucks and vans.
   The EPA list includes only 35 cars subject to a gasoline
``guzzler'' tax that kicks in for cars getting 22.5 mpg or less and
in the case of the Lamborghini Diablo amounts to $3,200.
   But those numbers may be misleading.
   For tax purposes, only the raw fuel economy test scores are
used, not the lower EPA figures that are adjusted through a
mathematical formula to better reflect actual driving conditions.
Increasingly popular passenger vans, speciality vehicles and trucks
also are excluded.
   Using the adjusted EPA figures, more than half the cars listed
showed a fuel economy of fewer than 22.5 mpg with the average
mileage for increasingly popular passenger vans and 4-wheel drive
speciality vehicles coming in at fewer than 20 mpg.
   Four of the 10 cars with the best fuel economy were variations
of the Geo, a Japanese-built car sold through General Motors.
   The others were two variations of the Honda Civic, two versions
of the Suzuki Swift, the Daihatsu Charade and the diesel-powered
Volkswagen Jetta, all with mileage estimates of between 37 mpg and
49 mpg in the city and 43 mpg to 52 mpg on the highway.
   At the other extreme were the Lamborghini Diablo, five versions
of the Rolls-Royce, two BMWs and a pair of Ferraris. None of the 10
vehicles achieved more than 12 mpg in city driving.
   According to industry figures, those worst and best performers
account for only a small fraction of the vehicles likely to be on
the nation's highways. The industry estimates cars that get better
than 40 mpg account for less than 3 percent of sales, while the
luxury cars that make up the worst mileage performers are far fewer
in number.
   Energy conservation advocates and environmentalists said the
latest figures demonstrate the failure of the auto industry to push
fuel economy in marketing and research.

<HEAD>Japan's Matsushita In $7 Billion Buyout Talks with Entertainment
Giant MCA</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-MCA-Profile and BC-MCA-Glance</HEAD>
<HEAD>Graphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A huge Japanese electronics
concern said Tuesday it is negotiating to buy entertainment giant
MCA Inc. in a deal valued at $7 billion, the latest move in
Hollywood globalization.
   The proposal by Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. also
demonstrates anew the foreign craving for American trophy holdings.
   The merger, if completed, would mirror the 1989 acquisition of
Columbia Pictures Entertainment by Japan's Sony Corp. for $5
billion, which includes the assumption of debt.
   One of the world's largest electronics manufacturers, Matsushita
makes video equipment and audio and visual components under the
brand names Panasonic, Technics and Quasar.
   MCA owns Universal Pictures (``E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial''), a
record and book publishing division (Guns N' Roses, ``Clear and
Present Danger''), theme parks, real estate and a robust television
division (``Quantum Leap,'' ``Major Dad'').
   In Japan, a Matsushita official who spoke on condition of
anonymity said MCA was one of the companies with which Matsushita
is involved in talks, but said nothing had been decided. He said he
could not comment further.
   Later, MCA issued a statement in which it confirmed it is ``in
discussions with a major international company regarding a possible
negotiated acquisition of MCA.
   ``The discussions are continuing on a friendly basis. No
agreement has been reached. There is no assurance that an agreement
will be reached,'' the statement said.
   Two MCA board members said in interviews that they could neither
confirm nor deny that a deal with Matsushita was being discussed.
MCA President Sidney Sheinberg did not return telephone messages.
   In Tuesday's edition, the Wall Street Journal said Matsushita
was offering between $70 and $80 a share for MCA stock, or a range
of about $6.7 billion to $7.5 billion for the conglomerate.
   Stock in MCA Inc., which struck a 52-week low of $34.12{ in
trading Monday, surged $19.25 Tuesday, or more than 57 percent, to
$53.75. Other entertainment stocks also advanced in trading, with
Paramount Communications up $3.12{ to $34.75 a share.
   The new enterprise would merge Matsushita's prominent
entertainment hardware division with MCA's profitable movie and
television divisions.
   ``The long-term advantages are that when you make hardware you
can benefit from the software producer's success,'' said Jeffrey
Logsdon, an entertainment analyst at Seidler Amdec Securities.
``There's an insatiable consumer demand for entertainment
software.''
   Logsdon speculated that other suitors might follow Matsushita's
bid.
   U.S. entertainment companies offer wise investments for all
purchasers, especially foreign investors with surplus cash.
Entertainment is the United States' second leading export behind
aerospace, accounting for a net positive trade balance of more than
$5 billion a year.
   More than a quarter of Matsushita's revenues are generated by
sales of video equipment. Audio and electronic components combine
for another 22 percent of revenues. The company had revenues of
about $44.4 billion in the year ended March 31.
   If completed, the MCA buyout would surely renew criticism of
Japanese control of American assets that surfaced last year in the
deals for New York's Rockefeller Center and Columbia Pictures
Entertainment.
   The Japanese had been keeping a low profile in such transactions
until a Tokyo golf tycoon purchased the Pebble Beach golf resorts
in California for about $950 million.
   The merger also might face regulatory barriers. MCA owns
independent television station WWOR in Secaucus, N.J., which a
foreign company would be prevented from owning.
   Michael Ovitz, the head of the talent agency Creative Artists
Agency Inc., has represented Matsushita in its attempts to find a
software counterpart. A CAA spokesman said Tuesday it was premature
to speculate if Ovitz would have any role in the new enterprise.
   Ovitz served as an adviser to Sony in its purchase of Columbia,
and Columbia discussed with him the possibility of running the
studio.
   Since its purchase, Columbia has floundered and has yet to
release any box-office blockbusters. The new studio managers, Jon
Peters and Peter Guber, inherited a production wing with few
projects in the works.
   The two immediate beneficiaries of the sale would be MCA
Chairman Lew Wasserman, who owns about 7 percent of MCA's shares
and, with other officers, has control of about 11.6 percent of its
stock, and record producer David Geffen, who sold his record label
to MCA in May for $550 million. Geffen collected 1 million shares
of preferred stock, convertible to 10 million shares of MCA common
stock, or 12 percent of the company, in the transaction.
   The Journal said Matsushita wants to keep MCA management in
place.
   MCA earned $191.77 million on revenue of $3.38 billion last
year, a 16 percent increase over earnings of $164.91 million and
$2.9 billion in revenue during 1988. In its most recent quarterly
earnings, the entertainment giant earned $44.8 million, up 7
percent from $41.9 million during the same period in 1989.
   At the end of last year, MCA had approximately 17,000 employees.
   Universal Pictures, the company's motion picture subsidiary, is
known as one of Hollywood's more daring studios. Its films include
the X-rated ``Henry and June,'' Spike Lee's films, the boycotted
``Last Temptation of Christ'' and a variety of stylish horror
titles.
   While the studio has not produced and released many recent
blockbusters, its film library is loaded.
   The titles include ``E.T. the Extraterrestrial,'' the all-time
box office champ with a domestic gate of $400 million and the
best-selling video ever with more than 15 million cassettes sold.
   Other hits in the MCA vault include ``Jaws,'' ``Back to the
Future'' and its two sequels, ``The Sting,'' ``Twins,'' ``National
Lampoon's Animal House'' and ``American Graffiti.''
   These films continue to generate revenues in ancillary markets
such as television and home video. MCA-Universal Home Video has 500
titles in its library, including some pre-1948 Paramount titles.
   Universal Television produces the shows ``Murder, She Wrote,''
``Quantum Leap,'' several ``Columbo'' movies, the comedies
``Coach,'' ``Major Dad'' and ``Uncle Buck'' and the dramas ``Over
My Dead Body'' and ``Law &amp; Order.''
   Universal Studios Hollywood was the nation's third most popular
theme park in 1989, drawing 5.1 million visitors.
   The company's theme parks have received some bad publicity
recently. MCA's $650 million, 3-month-old amusement park in
Orlando, Fla., has been bothered by an array of mechanical problems
with some of its rides, and the company has sued the designer of
the park's ``Jaws'' and ``Earthquake'' attractions.

<HEAD>H. Laurance Fuller Named Amoco Chairman; Mobil Vice Chairman
Retires</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amoco Corp. President H. Laurance Fuller will
succeed Richard M. Morrow as chairman and chief executive officer
of the oil, chemical and natural-gas company at the end of
February, Amoco announced Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, Mobil Corp. said Vice Chairman Richard F. Tucker, who
is also president of Mobil Oil Corp., will retire May 1, 1991.
   Morrow, Amoco's chairman and CEO since 1983, will retire upon
reaching age 65 as previously announced, the company said in a
statement. Fuller, 51, will retain the title of president, a
position he has held since 1983.
   Fuller, a native of Moline, Ill., joined Amoco in 1961 after
graduating with a degree in chemical engineering from Cornell
University. He also has a law degree from DePaul University.
   He worked in Amoco's engineering, law, refining, marketing and
supply operations and became president of Amoco Oil Co., the
company's petroleum refining, marketing and transportation
subsidiary, in 1978.
   Fuller serves on the boards of directors of Chase Manhattan
Corp., Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., Abbott Laboratories and the
American Petroleum Institute.
   Morrow, a West Virginia native, joined Amoco through the
company's Amoco Production Co. subsidiary in 1948. He was elected
president of Amoco Corp. in 1978.
   Morrow is a director of First Chicago Corp., First National Bank
of Chicago, Westinghouse Electric Corp., R.R. Donnelley and Sons
Co., Potlatch Corp. and the American Petroleum Institute.
   Amoco was the nation's seventh-largest producer of crude oil
last year, the second-largest producer of natural gas and the
largest owner of natural gas reserves in North America.
   Mobil, based in Fairfax, Va., said Tucker would retire at the
end of his three-year term as a director. Allen E. Murray, chairman
and chief executive officer of Mobil, also said Tucker will conduct
a review of the oil giant's business environment.
   The review, beginning Oct. 1, will include ``major changes that
will influence Mobil's future direction,'' Murray said, citing
turbulence and uncertainty facing the industry due to a range of
issues, from the Middle East crisis to environmental concerns.
   Tucker ``will consult widely with government and industry
leaders throughout our areas of operations to assure that we have
the broadest possible access to informed views on the outlook for
Mobil's core businesses,'' Murray said.

<TEXT>
   Kerr-McGee Refining Corp. will sell 95
company-operated retail properties in the Southeast in order to
concentrate marketing efforts in the Midwest, the company said
Tuesday.
   ``We want to focus future retail growth where we have brand
recognition,'' said Myron Cunningham, a spokesman for the energy
and chemical company.
   The properties to be sold include 52 operating stations, 31
closed stations and 12 undeveloped sites in Alabama, Arkansas,
Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee.
   Cunningham said money from the sales will be used to build and
acquire additional retail units in the company's primary branded
marketing area, where the company continues to emphasize both
branded wholesale and retail operations. That includes the Midwest
and certain Texas markets.
   He said Kerr-McGee and its Triangle Division would continue to
expand unbranded wholesale operations in the Southeast and other
states where the company markets wholesale petroleum products.

   Thomas J. Usher on Tuesday was appointed

   Usher succeeds Thomas C. Graham. The company's board voted
Tuesday to name Graham to the new post of vice chairman of the

   USX spokesman William Keslar said the change was ``simply a
matter of transition'' because Graham, who joined USX in 1983, will
retire in about a year.
   ``You want to season a new guy into the new job,'' Keslar said.
   Usher, a native of Reading, was named executive vice president

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moody's Investors Service on Tuesday downgraded
the credit rating of Chase Manhattan Corp., citing concern about
the deterioration of the bank's real estate loan portfolio.
   Moody's, one of the two major credit rating agencies, said
Chase's announcement Friday that it would halve its dividend this
quarter and boost its bad-loan reserves were positive steps for the
nation's second-largest bank.
   However, Moody's said it was concerned by ``the continuing
growth in Chase's non-performing real estate assets.'' Moody's also
said it was troubled by the deteriorating Northeast economy and the
bank's exposure to commercial real estate loans, Third World debt
and loans that went to high-debt corporate buyouts.
   Moody's added that the bank's basic financial structure remained
sound.
   ``We are disappointed in the downgrade,'' said Chase spokesman
Fraser Seitel. ``We don't think it's justified.
   ``The actions we took on Friday were designed to strengthen the
institution, and even after those actions our capital today exceeds
$11 billion and our capital ratios exceed the federal guidelines
that take effect in 1992,'' he said.
   Moody's downgraded by one notch the long-term debt rating and
commercial paper rating of Chase and several of its subsidiaries.
About $8.4 billion in long-term debt was affected, Moody's said.

<HEAD>Roadway Services Reports Nearly $11 Million Rise in Net Income</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roadway Services, Inc., on Tuesday reported a
46 percent increase in net income in the third quarter as customers
fearful of a strike at rival UPS boosted revenues.
   Roadway reported net income of $34.5 million, or 88 cents per
share, on revenues of 703.5 million in the quarter that ended Sept.
8. In the same period last year, the company reported net income of
$23.4 million, or 60 cents per share, on revenues of $623.3
million.
   The quarter's results reflected a surge in demand during late
July and early August because of shippers' concern over the
potential for a work stoppage at United Parcel Service, the company
said.
   ``While felt to some degree at our LTL carriers, the impact was
most significant at Roadway Package System, our small package
specialist,'' said Joseph M. Clapp, Roadway chairman and president.

<BYLINE>Shearson Lehman Settles Futures Rules Violation Charges
^By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wall Street giant Shearson Lehman Brothers
Inc. settled administrative charges with federal futures regulators
Tuesday and agreed to pay $220,000 in fines for allegedly letting a
customer break the rules.
   Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, Shearson and two
employees agreed to settle an administrative action by the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission charging numerous alleged
rules violations.
   In another CFTC administrative action, three floor brokers at
the Commodity Exchange in New York were accused of defrauding
customers in silver futures trading.
   The defendants have not settled in that case.
   In the Shearson case, the CFTC accused the securities firm -
which is also a registered futures commission firm - of aiding or
allowing a customer to violate exchange limits on how many open
contracts in orange juice futures could be traded by one person who
is speculating rather than hedging.
   A speculator trades commodity futures to profit from
anticipating price movements while a hedger tries to minimize risk
by taking offsetting positions in both the cash and futures
markets.
   The CFTC charged that Shearson and Charles M. Barley, an account
executive at Shearson's Winter Park, Fla. office, allowed or
assisted a Brazilian trader violate speculative position limits for
frozen concentrated orange juice futures on the orange juice
section of the New York Cotton Exchange.
   The trader, Horst J. Happel, of Sao Paulo, general manager of
Citrosuco Paulista S.A., a Brazilian frozen orange juice processor,
also was charged in the CFTC administrative action. He has not
settled with the agency.
   Shearson and the manager of the Winter Park office, Gerald W.
Helmich, were accused of improper supervision.
   Barley, of Windermere, Fla., agreed to pay a $35,000 fine and a
30-day suspension of his registration. Helmich, of Longwood, Fla.,
agreed to a two-week ban from supervisory work.
   In addition to the $220,000 civil penalty, Shearson agreed to
improve its record-keeping procedures.
   In the other action, the CFTC accused Craig H. Bell, of
Muttontown, N.Y.; Mark B. Dickstein and George J. Fox Jr., both of
New York of engaging in 19 non-competitive trading in silver
futures between march and October 1987.
   They were among the latest individuals named in administrative
actions stemming from a federal investigation last year into
potential trading abuses at some of the commodity futures exchanges
in New York's World Trade Center.
   ``It is not the first one and we do not expect it to be the
last,'' said Dennis Klejna, chief of the CFTC's Enforcement
Division.

<HEAD>Portions of Milken Sentencing Documents Released By Defense</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Milken, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from a sentencing memorandum
by Michael Milken's defense lawyers to U.S. District Judge Kimba M.
Wood, released Tuesday in advance of his scheduled sentencing on
Oct. 1.
   The memorandum outlines Milken's personal background, business
activities at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the nature of his
offenses, a proposal to sentence him and a rebuttal to government
charges to which he hasn't pleaded guilty.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PERSONAL BACKGROUND</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Michael Milken's unusual talents and compassion became obvious
at an early age. By the first grade, Michael could perform
complicated multiplications in his head, and he received the
highest grades in his classes.
   . . . Michael's work ethic also became evident at an early age.
Beginnning at the age of 10, Michael helped in his father's
accounting office - at first, sorting checks and performing
ministerial functions; later, reconciling checkbooks and assisting
in the preparation of tax returns.
   . . . By the time Michael was 30, he had earned vast sums of
money. But as everyone who knows him confirms, the accumulation of
money and material goods has never motivated Michael.
   . . . Until the publicity surrounding this investigation began,
not even his closest friends and colleagues had any idea of the
extent of his wealth or, for that matter, the vast sums of money
Michael gave away to charities. In stark contrast to the ``rich and
famous'' lifestyles led by other financiers, Michael eschewed
conspicuous consumption. He lives in a comfortable but not
extravagant home in Encino . . . His children receive a weekly
allowance. He prefers to spend his evenings with his family.
   . . . Michael is actively involved in all aspects of his
children's life. He helps his children with their homework. He
rarely misses a school function or a doctor's appointment. Michael
has even coached his boys' basketball teams.
   . . . As the court can well imagine, Michael's greatest
punishment is his knowledge that, by virtue of his offenses, his
children have suffered greatly and are living with the nightmare
that they may become separated from their father who has been a
continual presence throughout their lives and upon whom they are
deeply dependent.
   . . . Michael Milken will live for the rest of his life with the
knowledge that he has inflicted enormous emotional and physical
pain upon his wife and his children whom he loves more than
anything else in the world. For him, this punishment is more severe
than any this court could possibly impose.
   . . . Michael has immersed himself in philanthropy, having
volunteered thousands of hours to assist charities and community
organizations around the world.
   . . . Michael Milken's lifetime of charitable work cannot negate
his criminal conduct. But it can serve to underscore that his
offenses stand in sharp contrast to the philanthropic values he has
displayed throughout his life.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HIS HARD WORK</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Michael strove, through the use of innovative capital
structures, to provide financing to companies previously denied
access to capital. The sincerity of Michael's business beliefs and
the goals he set for himself are central to an understanding of
both the offender and the context in which the offenses occurred.
   . . . By 1985, Michael's business day was devoted both to
supervising the numerous researchers, traders and salespersons in
the multibillion-dollar high-yield department and to talking on the
phone and meeting with scores of customers and other Drexel
employees regarding the underwriting of millions of dollars of new
securities. His day began at approximately 4:30 a.m. and ended at
approximately 7 p.m.
   . . . Some have suggested that Michael Milken should be punished
less for his offenses than for his role in pioneering high-yield
finance. Such suggestions are not only improper, they are misguided
as well. People are perfectly entitled to call high-yield
securities ``junk bonds'' just as they are free to call shareholder
rights plans ``poison pills'' but that does not make either
illegal.
   . . . Michael Milken's high-yield business prospered long before
Drexel ever financed a single hostile takeover. Michael was not in
Drexel's mergers and acquisitions department, and did not suggest
targets for unsolicited takeovers. In fact, he often recommended
against such maneuvers.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>NATURE OF HIS OFFENSES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Michael should be sentenced based on the offenses to which he
pleaded guilty. He should not be sentenced for crimes that he did
not commit. He should not be sentenced on charges for which the
government expressly has foregone prosecution in return for his
guilty plea.
   . . . Although inexcusable, Michael's offenses (deletion) were
neither venal nor motivated by greed. He did not personally profit
by them. They did not involve trading securities on the basis of
inside information. Nor did these offenses infect the core of his
business.
   . . . Moreover, the majority of offenses to which Michael
pleaded guilty had rarely, if ever, been subject to criminal
prosecution at the time of Michael's acts.
   . . . While Michael aided and abetted in deferring payment of
taxes, Michael himself has never improperly deferred or evaded any
taxes that he owed. To the contrary, from 1984 through 1988,
Michael paid approximately $750 million federal and state income
taxes.
   . . . Michael today recognizes the gravity of his actions. He
understands that no one - especiallt someone in a position of
leadership and trust - can ever decide that it is permissible to
commit acts, no matter what one's motivation may be, that violate
the law. Michael Milken is a changed person. He will be tormented
for the remainder of his life by the realization that his family
was devastated, his reputation destroyed and his life's work
tainted by virtue of his having committed these acts.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SENTENCING PROPOSAL</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   If this court concludes that incarceration is required, we urge
that any period of confinement be brief - consistent with the
precedents in this district - and that it be served in a halfway
house or local facility (deletion).
   . . . Based on the sentencing principles developed in this
district, we propose that Michael Milken be sentenced to work
full-time with, and under the direct supervision and control of,
the Los Angeles Police Department to develop and participate in
specific educational and vocational programs designed to combat the
problems of drugs, crime, unemployment and illiteracy threatening
to destroy the lives of inner-city youth in Los Angeles.
   . . . The proposed sentence fully satisfies the goals of
punishment and general deterrence. Although the sentence imposed by
this court must serve to punish Michael for the crimes to which he
has pleaded guilty and must strive to deter others similarly
situated from committing these and similar crimes, the goals of
sentencing need not always be achieved through incarceration.
   . . . The retributive purpose of punishment has also been served
in this case by Michael's agreement to pay a $200 million criminal
fine and establish a $400 million civil settlement fund. Moreover,
these unprecedented amounts are not the limit of Michael's economic
exposure. His remaining assets are vulnerable to the more than 50
civil lawsuits that already have been commenced against him and
others, seeking billions of dollars in damages. Michael may well
spend the remainder of this century defending these and future
lawsuits.

<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ConAgra Inc. reported Tuesday a 16.7 percent
increase in earnings in the quarter that ended Aug. 26, boosted by
a strong performance from its prepared foods segment.
   Contributing for the first time to ConAgra's performance were
the Beatrice Cos. businesses - Hunt-Wesson, Swift-Eckrich and
Beatrice Cheese. ConAgra acquired Beatrice Aug. 14.
   ConAgra reported net income for the first quarter of fiscal 1991
of $57.17 million, or 45 cents per share, on sales of $4.5 billion.
That compared with net income of $48.97 million, or 40 cents per
share, on sales of $4 billion for the same period last year.
   The company realized a $2.1 million gain on nonrecurring items
last fiscal year.
   ConAgra officials said that virtually every one of its
operations showed good earnings. Prepared foods, the Omaha-based
company's largest segment, had a substantial operating profit.
Beef, pork, chicken and turkey products also had profit growth.
   While unit sales in the consumer frozen food business were up,
operating profit was down because of heavier spending on marketing,
company officials said.
   Operating profits in the agri-products segment declined because
heavy rains reduced plantings in some areas, officials said.

<HEAD>DeSoto Plans $35 Dividend, Pension Plan Termination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   DeSoto Inc., is asking shareholders to approve
a plan to sell off most of the manufacturer's assets and terminate
its pension plans in return for a one-time dividend of $35.50 per
share.
   In documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
and disclosed Tuesday, DeSoto outlined its list of issues for
shareholders to vote on at the company's annual meeting Oct. 24 in
Chicago.
   Among them, Des Plaines, Ill.-based DeSoto wants shareholder
approval of a restructuring ``under which the company would sell
substantialy all of its businesses'' including its domestic
consumer paint business, which has supplied Sears, Roebuck and Co.
for 80 years.
   The company's detergent business would be the only operation
retained by DeSoto, which has been battling a hostile takeover by a
New York investment group, Sutton Holding Corp.
   DeSoto estimated that the partial liquidation and restructuring
would raise about $222 million before taxes with $85 million
earmarked to retire corporate debt.
   The remainder would go toward paying a special cash dividend of
$35.50 per share but DeSoto conceded that there was ``no
assurance'' it would be able to pay the cash dividend.
   It noted that its plan to terminate pension plans and recover
some $28 million in excess assets is subject to approval by the
Internal Revenue Service and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. the
federal agency that guarantees workers pensions much like the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. guarantees bank deposits.

   One witness invoked the Fifth Amendment 14 times
and another refused to appear voluntarily as a hearing began
Tuesday on conflict-of-interest allegations against Neil Bush, the
president's son.
   Outside, the federal courthouse was surrounded by news media,
security officers and protesters.
   The only thing missing in the savings and loan case was the
center of all the attention.
   Neil Bush, 35, did not show up for the first day of what is
anticipated to be a four-day proceeding before Administrative Law
Judge Daniel J. Davidson.
   ``He has the option of being here. He only has to be here the
day he testifies,'' said Office of Thrift Supervision spokesman Tom
Mason. Bush is the last witness, and is expected to testify at the
end of the week.
   The federal Office of Thrift Supervision is trying to bar Bush
from the banking and savings industry for his alleged actions as a
director of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan, which failed in
late 1988 at a cost to taxpayers of $1 billion.
   At Tuesday's hearing, Michael Wise, Silverado's former board
chairman and chief executive officer, invoked his Fifth Amendment
right to refuse to answer questions on the grounds that he could
incriminate himself.
   Davidson then allowed him the opportunity to testify in his
chambers in order that Wise be ``spared the ordeal of going through
a futile gesture of taking the Fifth.''
   But a transcript released later in the day showed Wise still
refused to answer any of the 14 questions he was asked. Those
questions ranged from whether he could identify exhibits to his
knowledge of Bush's business ties to two Denver developers who
eventually defaulted on Silverado loans exceeding $130 million.
   Wise also declined to speak with reporters as he left the
judge's chambers.
   Meanwhile, Florian Barth, a former Silverado board member and a
Denver car dealer, announced Tuesday he refused to testify
voluntarily.
   The judge said he would sign a subpoena to bring Barth to court
if either side requested one. At the end of the day, OTS officials
said they hadn't yet requested one.
   Federal regulators accused Bush last February of violating his
duty as a Silverado director from August 1985 to August 1988. The
OTS claims Bush may have improperly voted on loans and lines of
credit for developers Kenneth Good and Bill Walters, both of whom
contributed to Bush's JNB Exploration oil company. The two
defaulted on Silverado loans totaling more than $130 million.
   Last week, Bush and other former Silverado directors also were
sued for $200 million by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The
lawsuit alleged that gross negligence on the part of Silverado
directors contributed to the S&amp;L's collapse.
   Bush could have avoided this week's hearing by agreeing not to
dispute the charges, as other S&amp;L officials have done. By fighting
the government, he has taken the case into a rare public forum.
   Russell Murray, former Silverado executive vice president, was
the first scheduled witness to actually testify Tuesday.
   He reviewed a 1986 proposal for a $900,000 line of credit for
Good International Inc., which wanted to search for oil in
Argentina with Bush's JNB as a partner.
   Murray said he did not recall anyone questioning the
no-collateral line of credit even though Good and Bush had a
business relationship.
   He indicated the line of credit was for show only, to impress
Argentine officials.
   Murray said he knew Bush and Good had a business relationship.
He said he discussed the request for a line of credit with Bush,
Good and Wise, and then wrote a memo to the directors about the
relationship before the line of credit was approved.
   He said he did not have all the details of the relationship and
that he would have asked for an opinion from counel if he had had
all the facts.
   Later, J. Donald Wright, chairman of the board of Lakewood Bank
and Trust of Dallas, was called by the government as an expert
witness to give his opinion of Bush's role in approving $100
million in loans to Walters. Walters had invested $150,000 in
Bush's company and his bank gave Bush's company a $1.75 million
line of credit.
   ``Mr. Bush should have disclosed his relationship with Mr.
Walters'' when the Silverado board voted on the loans, said Wright.
   ``He was obligated to Mr. Walters. It would have been difficult
to move to defeat Mr. Walters' loan,'' he said. ``Mr. Bush is
responsible for that judgment.''
   The judge has until Dec. 6 to recommend a ruling to OTS Director
Timothy Ryan, who has until April 8 to decide whether to impose the
sanctions. Bush could appeal.
