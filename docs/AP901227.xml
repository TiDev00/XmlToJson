   A red-faced Gov. William Donald Schaefer is
promising to replace seven trees felled by state work crews in what
some residents of this Washington suburb are calling the Bethesda
Chain Saw Massacre.
   ``I'm really sorry because we try not to mess up,'' Schaefer
said Wednesday, surveying the seven tree stumps. ``We made a
mistake and we're going to do everything we can to rectify it.''
   The blunder by crews working for the state comes at a miserable
time for Schaefer, who is a third of the way through a ballyhooed
campaign to plant 1 million trees as a means of enhancing the
Maryland environment.
   ``I am tree conscious,'' he reminded reporters.
   They accompanied him on a visit with mechanical engineer Arun
Vohra, whose home had been shielded from a nearby roadway by the
seven trees.
   Schaefer, with state Transportation Secretary James Lighthizer
in tow, apologized to Vohra, a 46-year-old native of India who
moved here three years ago.
   Actually, it was Vohra's call to state officials months ago that
started the painful chain of events.
   Vohra told the state highway administration he believed a pine
tree on a public right of way near his property was diseased and
should be removed.
   Authorities later determined that the pine tree was not diseased
and had merely come under heavy attack from woodpeckers.
   By that time, though, crews had visited the site on two
occasions and cut down seven other, perfectly healthy trees - two
pines, three blooming dogwoods, a giant lilac and a cedar that
soared 80 feet to 100 feet.
   The pine tree a few yards away was left untouched.
   Vohra was upset. ``I acted a little crazy,'' he said. He called
the governor's mansion, his state delegate, his congresswoman and
other state officials. The ruckus found its way into the news
reports and was dubbed the Bethesda Chain Saw Massacre.
   Wednesday's visit was friendly enough, though.
   Vohra served coffee and snacks to the governor and his aides
while Schaefer surveyed the damage and pronounced it a result of
poor communications, misunderstandings and a failure to properly
mark the tree that originally had been the target of concern.
   ``We made a mistake ... we learned,'' said Schaefer.
   The governor was glum about the massive cedar.
   ``That was a great tree,'' he acknowledged. He and Vohra posed
for cameras standing on its stump.

   For Garry Kasparov, it was the world chess
title and something more. It was the ultimate vindication of him
and his flamboyant style over the surgical precision of his
introspective rival, Anatoly Karpov.
   Kasparov defeated Karpov, a fellow Soviet, for the fourth time
in a world chess championship on Wednesday by playing him to a draw
in the 22nd game.
   The half point each player received put Kasparov ahead 12-10 and
let him retain the crown. He had won four games to Karpov's two.
The rest were draws.
   At age 22 in 1985, Kasparov won the title from Karpov to become
the youngest champion in history. He defended the crown by beating
Karpov in 1986 and 1987.
   On Wednesday, Kasparov declared himself, in measured tones that
may belie the magnitude of the accomplishment, a better player than
his 39-year-old rival.
   ``I am a really good professional player,'' Kasparov said.
``Today I play chess better than Karpov. I can concentrate and do
things a little better, as I did during this match when I had
problems.''
   Interest in the 24-game series was heightened by the dramatic
contrast in style and temperament between the two players.
   Kasparov is talkative and flamboyant. He plays with creativity
and decisiveness and his politics are strictly anti-Communist.
   Karpov is often portrayed as a colorless introvert who shys away
from bold strategies. ``I have two loves,'' Karpov has said.
``Communism and chess.''
   ``Normally chess is a battle between two individuals,'' Kasparov
once said. ``But in my case, with Karpov, it's a fight between two
different mentalities in Russia. I identify him with the system
I've been fighting.''
   After winning just one match and drawing 10 of 12 games in the
first half of the competition beginning Oct. 8 in New York,
Kasparov rallied to three victories and six draws in the French
portion played in Lyon.
   The turning point came in game 16, which Kasparov won after 102
moves during more than 12 hours over three days of playing.
   Kasparov won the last three times he played white, but playing
white again Wednesday made him jittery.
   ``I was really nervous because I didn't know what to do, whether
to play for the win or draw,'' Kasparov said afterward. ``Then my
life became much easier when I had the worse positions and I had to
fight for the draw - and I obliged.''
   Though Kasparov clinched the title, the two must play the final
two games to determine how the $3 million purse is split.
   If the series ends in a 12-12 tie, Kasparov will still have won
but the purse will be split evenly; if Kasparov gets another draw
or win, he gains $1.7 million.
   On Wednesday, Kasparov triumphed by maneuvering into position at
the 40th move to keep putting Karpov in check - a perpetual check
that trapped Karpov in a no-win situation.
   After the 43rd move, Kasparov simply offered his hand to Karpov.
Realizing the draw inevitable, Karpov looked back at his opponent
and then shook hands, giving Kasparov the world title again.
   Kasparov showed little emotion and talked over the game briefly
with Karpov.
   But he smiled during interviews afterward. ``It is not easy to
retain the championship for so many years,'' he said.
   Wednesday's game had been delayed a week. Karpov had called a
timeout Saturday, and the organizers again postponed the match by
calling a technical timeout on Christmas Eve.
   Karpov won the championship in 1975 when American Bobby Fischer,
then the reigning wonderboy of chess, refused to defend the title
he won in 1972.
   That anomaly allowed Kasparov another dig.
   ``Karpov was the only world champion not to have beaten another
world champion for the title, '' he said.
   At Lyon, after a draw or decision, the two often discussed the
play in a tone that seemed almost amicable.
   But even Kasparov's compliments imparted a sting. ``I know him.
He knows me,'' Kasparov said. ``You have to realize he is the only
serious opponent for me. I am talking chess with the No. 2 in the
world.''

<HEAD>Poor Blood Flow May Signal Post-Surgery Heart Attacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Early detection of poor blood flow to the heart
may be an important step toward preventing heart attacks that
commonly occur after surgery, according to a report today.
   Researchers found that patients who develop poor blood flow to
the heart - a condition called ischemia - soon after surgery are
nine times more likely than other patients to suffer heart attacks
within a few days.
   ``Early detection and treatment of ischemia may well be the key
to decreasing heart attacks and deaths after surgery,'' Dr. Dennis
T. Mangano said in a study in today's New England Journal of
Medicine. ``The potential savings in lives and medical costs are
enormous.''
   Of at least 1 million Americans with coronary artery disease who
have non-cardiac surgery each year, about 50,000 suffer heart
attacks soon afterward and 20,000 die, researchers said. Treating
these heart attacks costs more than $500 million a year.
   Mangano conducted his study at the Veterans Administration
Medical Center in San Francisco. It was based on 243 men with
coronary artery disease and 231 who were at high risk of it. All
underwent elective, non-cardiac surgery.
   Forty-one percent developed ischemia in the first 12 to 48 hours
after their operations, and 17 percent suffered some kind of
cardiac emergency while still in the hospital.
   Those who developed ischemia within two days of surgery were
nine times more likely to have a heart attack than those who had no
post-operative ischemia.

<HEAD>Census Shows 249.6 Million Americans; Sun Belt Still a Gainer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation grew to 249.6 million people in the
1980s as more Americans left the industrial and agricultural
heartlands for the South and West.
   The Census Bureau's first ``final'' figures from the 1990
census, released Wednesday, showed the pull of the Sun Belt
remained strong, despite efforts by the industrial North to promote
growth and the collapse during the 1980s of the oil and savings and
loan industries - two mainstays of the Southern and Western states.
   The census figures are used to adjust the number of
representatives each state sends to Congress so that political
clout is in line with population. The figures also determine the
division of federal money among states and localities.
   The numbers could change next summer when the Commerce
Department decides whether to adjust the count. Some states and
cities are likely to challenge the tallies, whichever way the
adjustment decision goes.
   More than 6,000 local governments challenged the accuracy of a
preliminary count based mainly on the April 1 census taken by mail.
The Census Bureau responded with a series of recounts and an ad
campaign urging people who thought they had been missed to come
forward.
   In New York, Mayor David Dinkins criticized the count released
Wednesday, saying it underestimated the city's population and as a
result will cost the city millions of dollars in federal funds each
year.
   ``Since at least 1940, the Commerce Department and the Census
Bureau have systematically under counted Americans of color and
Americans who live in cities,'' Dinkins said at a City Hall news
conference.
   The Census Bureau's final national population total was nearly 4
million people more than the preliminary number it released earlier
this year.
   Five states, all in the South or West, grew by more than a
fourth in the decade: Nevada, up 50.7 percent; Alaska, 37.4
percent; Arizona, 35.3 percent; Florida, 33.4 percent; and
California, 26.1 percent.
   The six states having growth of less than 1 percent included
some industrial powerhouses: Illinois, up 0.4 percent;
Pennsylvania, 0.5 percent; Michigan, 0.7 percent; and Ohio, 0.8
percent. Grain-growing Nebraska grew by a bare 0.9 percent.
Louisiana, hard hit by the collapse in oil prices in the 1980s,
grew 0.8 percent.
   Five states lost population. The biggest percentage loser was
West Virginia, whose population dropped by 7.6 percent to
1,801,625. Other states losing population were Iowa, down 4.3
percent; Wyoming, down 2.9 percent; and North Dakota, down 1.7
percent. The District of Columbia also lost population, 4.5
percent.
   America's population grew at a slower pace in the 1980s than in
decades past: 10.2 percent, compared with 11.4 percent in the 1970s
and 13.4 percent in the 1960s.
   This year's population count, 249,632,692, for the first time
included some Americans living abroad. The 1980 population figure,
226,504,825, counted only people living within the nation's
borders.
   Wednesday's release was only the first burst of what will be a
barrage of census numbers detailing not only the number of people
but their ages, races, housing situations, incomes and a wealth of
other data.
   The last figures in the $2.6 billion census won't be released
until 1993.
   All regions had more people in 1990 compared with 10 years
earlier. The Pacific, Mountain and South Atlantic regions had the
sharpest growth, and the East North Central, West North Central and
East South Central regions had the slowest.
   The Pacific states were the fastest growing region, 23.4
percent, followed by the Mountain states, 20.6 percent, and the
South Atlantic states, 18.8 percent. In the 1970s those regions had
each showed double-digit growth.
   By contrast, the East North Central states grew a bare 1.1
percent; the West North Central states, 3.1 percent; and the East
South Central states, 3.9 percent. Those numbers represented a
falloff from each region's growth in the 1970s.
   Other facts from the census release:
   -Besides California, states gaining representatives will be
Florida, four; Texas, three; and Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina,
Virginia and Washington, one seat each.
   -States losing representatives will be New York, three;
Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, two each; and Iowa,
Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey and
West Virginia, one each.
   -The 1990 census counted 922,819 members of the armed forces,
civilian employees of the federal government and their dependents
living abroad. Other Americans living overseas weren't counted.

<HEAD>American Diplomat Rejected Almost Daily By Iraqis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly every day, Joseph C. Wilson IV, the
American diplomat in charge of the skeleton-sized U.S. Embassy in
Baghdad, telephones or visits the Iraqi foreign ministry with
standing instructions from Washington.
   It is to find out if Secretary of State James A. Baker III would
be welcome for a visit before Jan. 3 to talk to President Saddam
Hussein about releasing his grip on Kuwait and pulling out the
400,000 Iraqi troops there.
   That session, should it come to pass, could be the last
diplomatic encounter between the two countries before the crisis
over Iraq's seizure of Kuwait erupts into war.
   The reply to Wilson, with slight variation, is either a
repetition of Jan. 12 as the only acceptable date or no reply at
all, U.S. officials said Wednesday as the deadlock in arranging
talks continued.
   ``The Iraqis don't have much to say,'' one official remarked.
``They just stick to Jan. 12.''
   Wilson talks sometimes to Nizar Hamdoon, an experienced diplomat
who was once Iraq's ambassador to Washington and now is deputy
foreign minister. Or sometimes Wilson deals with a stand-in.
   They talk also about routine embassy matters. And until Saddam
relented, according to U.S. officials, Wilson's daily routine
included insisting on release of the American hostages in Iraq and
Kuwait - and then writing a cable to Washington about their plight.
   On Aug. 6, just days after Iraqi troops conquered Kuwait in a
blitzkrieg attack, Wilson was summoned to the foreign ministry for
what he thought would be a meeting with Foreign Minister Tariq
Aziz.
   Instead, he was brought to Saddam, who told Wilson that Kuwait
belonged to Iraq and that the annexation was irreversible.
   On Wednesday, Wilson, 41, and a veteran of 15 years in the
foreign service, telephoned Hamdoon again.
   There had been a report in an Israeli newspaper, Maariv, that
Baker probably would be in Baghdad on Jan. 9.
   Wilson found the Iraqis still insisting on Jan. 12, while Baker
has not budged from his position that he would make the trip only
on or before Jan. 3.
   ``There has been no Iraqi movement on the question of dates,''
Sondra McCarty, a State Department spokeswoman, told reporters in
Washington.
   The Israeli Embassy disputed the report in Maariv, which quoted
unidentified Israeli diplomats.
   ``We have no knowledge of anything of the sort,'' embassy
spokeswoman Ruth Yaron said. She called the newspaper report ``pure
speculation.''
   The disagreement over dates, which shelved a Dec. 17 call by the
Iraqi foreign minister on President Bush at the White House, could
soon become academic. Don Davidson, a White House spokesman, said
Jan. 3 remained the last possible date for Baker to go to Baghdad.
   Baker, who is on vacation in Houston, has rejected Jan. 12 as
too close to the Jan. 15 deadline set by the United Nations
Security Council for Iraq to leave Kuwait or be forced out.
   Baker proposed any time between Dec. 20 and Jan. 3.
   ``We've offered 15 dates,'' Richard Boucher, a State Department
spokesman, said. ``We were forthcoming, but they have not shown
themselves willing to avail themselves of our offer.''

<HEAD>Sainthood Drive for Spanish Queen Angers Jews, Moslems</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   She sent Christopher Columbus on his voyage
and opened up the New World for the spread of Catholicism, but did
Queen Isabella I of Spain have the stuff of saints? Jews and
Moslems are outraged by the idea.
   The Vatican is studying a petition that supporters hope will put
the queen on the road to possible sainthood in time for 1992, when
the church plans to celebrate 500 years of Christianity in the
Americas.
   One of the most significant figures in Spanish history, Isabella
commissioned the voyage of Columbus in 1492 to the New World.
   Isabella is also remembered as the queen who expelled the Jews
and Moslems from Spain and for the dreaded Inquisition that began
during her rule with her husband, Ferdinand II.
   Samuel Toledano, head of the Federation of Spanish Jewish
Communities, calls Isabella ``a symbol of intolerance.''
   The Vatican petition, he said, ``would reopen old wounds that we
thought were closed forever.''
   But an Argentine-born priest pursuing her cause says her
contributions to unifying Spain and spreading Catholicism were
immense and worthy of recognition.
   ``She was one of the great women of history,'' said the Rev.
Anastasius Gutierrez, who is serving as postulator to argue her
case before Vatican commissions.
   Gutierrez, who is representing the Spanish archdiocese of
Valladolid, near the site of Isabella's death in 1504, says the
church in many countries of Latin America has given its support.
   The Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of Saints must decide
if there is merit in a cause for a candidate's heroic virtue or
martyrdom and then send it on to the cardinals of the congregation
and eventually the pope.
   If approved, the candidate would be declared ``venerable,'' the
first step up the ladder.
   Gutierrez said he is hoping for this approval by the fall of
1991 but admitted the next step - beatification - may be more
difficult.
   ``We need a miracle that doesn't exist,'' he said.
   One miracle attributed to the candidate is needed for the
declaration of ``blessed.''
   The petition appears to have touched a sensitive nerve at the
Vatican. The sainthood congregation referred queries to the
Vatican's press office.
   Chief spokesman Joaquin Navarro insisted the Vatican is not
working under any deadline. ``There is no special desire to
complete it by 1992,'' he said.
   Jewish representatives in Spain, Italy and Britain have called
on the Vatican to shelve the petition for the time being.
   ``I do hope the Vatican will listen and not place an obstacle in
the path of dialogue,'' said Tullia Zevi, president of the Union of
Italian Jewish Communities.
   She said Isabella's reign destroyed ``a unique example of
fruitful cooperation among Jews, Moslems and Christians,'' and a
move toward beatification would only encourage extremists.
   Hesham el-Essawy, chairman of the Islamic Society for the
Promotion of Religious Tolerance, was quoted in The Times of London
as saying: ``Moslems and Jews were forced at the point of a sword
to covert to Christianity or die. She is more of a demon than a
saint.''
   The Inquisition began in Spain in 1478 and was originally aimed
at discovering and punishing Jews whose conversions were considered
insincere. It was later extended to Moslems and then to any
Spaniard suspected of heresy.
   Meanwhile, plans to celebrate the 500th anniversary of Columbus'
arrival in America are under fire from native American groups that
say the Spanish conquest of the New World involved the devastation
of their way of life.
   The Spanish conquerors transferred tons of gold and silver to
Spain from the newly discovered land, especially from Mexico and
Peru, after dominating the natives in bloody wars.
   The National Council of Churches, which includes most of the
leading Protestant churches in the United States, is planning
counterdemonstrations to the Catholic Church's 1992 celebration.
The council wants to call attention to what Columbus did to exploit
native Americans.

<HEAD>Cabinet Reshuffle Tests Kaifu's Leadership</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In perhaps his biggest political battle, Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu is trying to block attempts by his party's
leaders to return scandal-tainted allies to the Cabinet.
   Analysts see the fight over a Cabinet reshuffle, expected no
later than early next month, as a test of Kaifu's lightly regarded
political muscle and of the governing Liberal Democratic Party's
pledge to reform the political system.
   ``It is going to be a leadership test for Kaifu,'' said
Keiichiro Nakamura, a noted political analyst who served as a
secretary to the late Prime Minister Takeo Miki.
   If he blocks the entry of scandal-linked politicians to the
Cabinet, it will show he exercises some political clout, Nakamura
said.
   ``If he allows any of them in, the public will see him as only a
puppet of the party's big bosses.''
   An obscure member of Parliament at the time, Kaifu was chosen by
party leaders to head the government in August 1989 after two prime
ministers resigned in quick succession following the Recruit
scandal.
   The party turned to Kaifu because he was untarnished by the
affair, in which the Recruit business conglomerate offered
lucrative unlisted stock to influential politicians.
   He since has kept tainted politicians out of his Cabinet to
preserve the ``Mr. Clean'' image that buoyed his public approval
ratings and gave him some leverage over party bosses.
   But recent opinion polls show eroding support for Kaifu because
of his indecisiveness on how to respond to the Persian Gulf crisis,
particularly over whether Japanese troops should be sent to the
Middle East for non-combat duty.
   Some party leaders, seeing a chance to enhance their positions,
are insisting on Cabinet posts for allies who they believe have
been kept out of the political limelight long enough because of
Recruit.
   The personnel debate has little to do with public policy.
   Among the Recruit-tainted politicians mentioned as possible
Cabinet ministers are Koichi Kato, the former secretary general of
the Defense Agency, and Yoshiro Mori, the former education
minister. They were among the party's rising stars before the
scandal.
   But Kaifu appears to back a new Cabinet lineup that is not
supported by top party leaders. No agreement was reported after he
met with powerful party Secretary-General Ichiro Ozawa on
Wednesday.
   Toshio Yamaguchi, a senior Liberal Democrat legislator, said
politicians linked to Recruit already have paid their dues by being
kept out of the Cabinet for more than a year.
   ``Mr. Kaifu needs to realize who are the real supporters of his
administration,'' he said.
   But Tadatoshi Akiba, a lawmaker for the Japan Socialist Party,
the largest opposition party, said reappointing scandal-linked
politicians would prove the governing party's reform plans are ``no
more than a fake.
   ``If they are serious about political reform, how can they act
so shamelessly?,'' he said.
   Akiba said resurrection of the Recruit politicians would be
especially galling at a time when a Liberal Democratic Party
legislator is under investigation for alleged tax evasion on stock
profits of about $21 million.
   Distribution of Cabinet seats is based on the power balance
among the five factions of the Liberal Democratic Party, which has
ruled Japan since 1955. The groups, which are non-ideological, are
headed by senior politicians who aspire to become prime minister
and to win plum government posts for their allies.
   Because Kaifu belongs to the smallest group, he needs the
support of larger factions. He therefore cannot easily resist their
demands on policy and personnel matters.
   The annual rotation of Cabinet posts has become a party
tradition because lawmakers expect to assume a ministerial post
after serving five or six terms in Parliament.

   Roseanne Barr's husband wants a gag to work -
one from a court, not from her hit TV show.
   Tom Arnold filed a lawsuit Wednesday in Superior Court charging
that Miss Barr's former husband and his attorney violated a court
order by discussing the comic's divorce publicly.
   Arnold said ex-husband William Pentland and his attorney,
palimony lawyer Marvin Mitchelson, discussed the divorce on the
``Donahue'' show in November.
   Arnold's lawyer, Martin Singer, asked a judge to sentence
Mitchelson to 30 days in jail and Pentland to 15 days for contempt
of court. Singer said Mitchelson ``has engaged in a widespread
publicity campaign to try to maliciously disparage and defame Tom
Arnold in direct violation of the order.''
   Mitchelson said he would file a countersuit, saying it was Miss
Barr who called into ``Donahue'' and discussed the divorce. She
also made disparaging remarks about the divorce on Arsenio Hall's
talk show, he said.
   Pentland, who was married for 14 years to Miss Barr, filed a
palimony lawsuit in August seeking at least $15 million from her
and $3 million from Arnold.
   Miss Barr plays a sarcastic, overweight housewife on ABC's
``Roseanne.''

   EATONTON, Ga. (AP) - Officials in the town where Alice Walker
was born want to build a trail honoring the Pulitzer Prize-winning
author of ``The Color Purple.''
   Ms. Walker, 46, now is honored in Eatonton only with a street
named for her and with books on display at the Chamber of Commerce.
   Organizers of The Color Purple Educational Fund Foundation,
which helps needy students, want to create a trail passing Ms.
Walker's birthplace, her mother's home and the cemetery where her
father and other relatives are buried.
   Plans also call for erecting a monument in the courthouse
square.
   ``I wish we had a museum,'' said City Councilman Ulysses Rice.
   Ms. Walker's novel about Celie, a poor black woman forced to
live with a man who loves another woman, was made into a movie
starring Whoopi Goldberg, Danny Glover and Oprah Winfrey.
   Other works by Ms. Walker include ``You Can't Keep a Good Woman
Down,'' ``I Love Myself When I'm Laughing'' and ``Meridian.''

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Tom Cruise married Nicole Kidman, his co-star
in ``Days of Thunder,'' in a private ceremony at a Colorado ski
resort.
   Few details about the Christmas Eve wedding were disclosed, but
Cruise's spokeswoman, Andrea Jaffe, said the 30-minute civil
ceremony was witnessed by a handful of family members. Honeymoon
plans weren't disclosed either.
   It was the first marriage for the Australian actress and the
second for Cruise, whose nearly three-year marriage to actress Mimi
Rogers ended in January in divorce.
   Cruise, 28, met Miss Kidman, 23, while filming ``Days of
Thunder.''
   The couple are in pre-production for their next film together,
``The Irish Story,'' directed by Ron Howard.
   Cruise's movies include ``Risky Business,'' ``Top Gun,'' ``The
Color of Money,'' ``Rain Man'' and ``Born on the Fourth of July.''
   Miss Kidman is filming ``Billy Bathgate,'' co-starring Dustin

   The survey released Wednesday showed the biggest gains for the

   It said the increase at four-year colleges and universities

   Attorney Andrew L. Frey has been named to
handle appeals for the office of Iran-Contra independent counsel
Lawrence E. Walsh.
   Frey, 52, a former deputy solicitor general, will be responsible
for arguing against the appeal by former national security adviser
John Poindexter, said a statement Wednesday from the independent
counsel's office.
   It said he also will be responsible for continuing appellate
proceedings against former National Security Council aide Oliver

ethics case.
   Poindexter is appealing his five convictions of April 7 - one
count of conspiring to obstruct inquiries and proceedings, two
counts of obstructing Congress and two counts of false statements.
   North was convicted May 4, 1989, of three counts - altering and
destroying official documents, accepting an illegal gratuity and
aiding and abetting in the obstruction of Congress.
   One of those convictions was reversed by the U.S. Court of
Appeals here on July 20 and the others were vacated for further

<HEAD>Political Committee Agrees to Pay $3,000 Fine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A political committee founded by Rep. Dick
Armey, R-Texas, has agreed to pay a $3,000 fine to settle charges
that if violated campaign financing law, the Federal Election
Commission says.
   The Policy Innovation Political Action Committee, founded by the
conservative lawmaker, was accused of accepting an illegal
contribution and failing to file proper and timely reports with the
commission in 1988.
   Commission spokesman Fred Eiland said the group agreed on Oct. 2
to pay the civil penalty as a means of settling the case and the
agreement was approved by the six-member panel on Dec. 20.
   Army founded the committee in 1988 to raise funds and make
campaign contributions to like-minded conservatives seeking
election to the House.
   It furnished campaign contributions to 30 candidates this year
and 12 of them won their races.
   Eiland said the committee accepted three $2,000 campaign
contributions from a retired executive for a total of $6,000, or
$1,000 over the legal limit. He said the total contributions were
reported as $5,000.
   He said the group was 110 days late filing one report with the
commission
   and 11 days late in filing another.
   Armey spokesman Ed Gillespie described the violations as ``just
basically technical errors.'' He said the extra $1 000 contribution
should have been attributed to the executive's wife.

<NOTE>EDS: Subs 4th graf, ``The news xxx to CORRECT last time

   In the politics of the future, California will
exercise more clout than any smoke-filled room of politicians ever
did.
   California emerges from the 1990 census as a political behemoth,
with 52 House seats, a population bigger than Canada's and 20
percent of the electoral votes needed to be elected president.
   Add together the congressional representation of 21 states and
they still will total fewer than the delegation from California,
which swells by seven in 1992, the result of a 26 percent surge in
population in the last 10 years.
   The news is nothing but promising for Republicans. California
hasn't voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1964;
except for Jimmy Carter in 1976, no one has won the White House
while losing California since 1912, when Democrat Woodrow Wilson
lost the state but defeated Bull Mooser Theodore Roosevelt and
Republican William Howard Taft anyway.
   Republicans can find more cheer in most of the other shifts in
political power ordered up by the population figures released by
the Census Bureau on Wednesday.
   The industrial Northeast and Midwest will lose standing in
Congress and the electoral college. The West, the South and the Sun
Belt, increasingly Republican, gain.
   ``The political consequences advantage the Republicans,'' summed
up Stephen Hess, political analyst at the Brookings Institution, a
Washington research organization.
   The census sets the stage, as well, for brutal redistricting
battles from coast to coast, promising to generate nasty
colleague-versus-colleague races in some of the 13 states where the
number of House seats must shrink.
   New York will suffer the biggest loss, three seats, and on the
streets of Brooklyn, that could come down to a brawl between two
Democratic incumbents, Reps. Charles Schumer and Stephen Solarz.
They may have to compete for a single seat.
   It is no coincidence, Hess observed, that Schumer and Solarz
have built up campaign warchests in the million-dollar range, each
anticipating a costly battle - or perhaps a race elsewhere, maybe
taking on Republican Alfonse M. D'Amato for his Senate seat.
   Four states lose two House members - Illinois, going to 20;
Michigan, to 16; Ohio, to 19; and Pennsylvania, to 21.
   Eight states will lose one each - Iowa, down to five; Kansas, to
four; Kentucky, to six; Louisiana, to seven; Massachusetts, to 10;
Montana, to one; New Jersey, to 13; and West Virginia, to three.
   Among the gainers are Florida, up four to 23, and Texas up three
to 30. And one additional seat in the House will go to five states
- Arizona, going to six; Georgia, to 11; North Carolina, to 12;
Virginia, to 11; and Washington, to nine.
   But it is California where the gains are most dramatic. In
January 1993, that state will have more representatives than 21
other states combined - Alaska, Delaware, Montana, North Dakota,
South Dakota, Vermont, Wyoming, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Nevada, New
Hampshire, Rhode Island, Nebraska, New Mexico, Utah, West Virginia,
Arkansas, Kansas, Iowa and Mississippi.
   All states except the six which now have only one representative
- Alaska, Delaware, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming
- will have to redraw congressional boundaries. The purpose is to
give each representative 572,466 constituents, or as close to that
figure as possible.
   The cry of gerrymandering - rigging election lines to favor one
party - is sure to be heard. In California, the election of
Republican Pete Wilson as governor will serve as a check if the
Democratic legislature tries to squeeze out Republicans, already
outnumbered 27-18.
   Elsewhere, black leaders in Virginia, Alabama, North Carolina,
South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and Texas have served notice that
they want the new lines drawn to create districts where blacks have
substantial majorities and a chance to elect a member of Congress.
   ``We will oppose any friend or fight any foe to ensure that
there is a black congressional district in Virginia in 1991,'' Jack
Gravely, president of that state's NAACP, announced last fall.
   Curtis Gans, director of the non-partisan Committee for the
Study of the American Electorate, disputed what he said was the
widespread view of the census figures as a ``windfall for the
Republicans.''
   Most states that picked up new seats did so because of growing
Hispanic populations, Gans said, and he predicted that Hispanics
will become increasingly loyal Democrats.
   ``Hispanics of the class that is expanding the population in
California, Florida, New Mexico and Arizona tend to vote 2-1
Democratic,'' he said. ``Eventually that's going to tell - probably
within the next decade.''
   Only in Florida, where Cuban-Americans favor conservative
candidates, can the Republicans anticipate long-term gains, he
said.

   Scores of rusting old ships float in

   Congressional critics want to junk the 66-ship Suisun Bay

   ``Many of these ships go back to service in World War II, Korea,
Vietnam,'' said Johnston, 40, the fleet's acting superintendent.
   Hanging on a wall was a board with the name and location of each
ship, 33 of them World War II Victory ships, all part of a fleet
that once numbered 700.
   ``Pick one. You call it,'' he said to assure that a tour
wouldn't steer the visitor toward a specially prepared ship. A CIA
spy vessel is off limits, though.
   During the last session of Congress, the ships here and at Fort
Eustis, Va., and Beaumont, Texas, came under fire from the House
Small Business Committee's subcommittee on regulation, business
opportunities and energy.
   ``The taxpayers are getting repeatedly fleeced ... for these
maritime cadavers,'' said Rep. Ron Wyden of Oregon, subcommittee
chairman. William S. Broomfield of Michigan, ranking Republican on
the House Foreign Affairs Committee, described the ships as
``glorified rust buckets.''
   The array of ships local landlubbers call the ``mothball fleet''
is impressive from a distance, and the spookiness that earned it
the nickname ``ghost fleet'' is evident while approaching in a
tugboat.
   They're tied in rows, anchored at the bow and stern and joined
to each other by gangplanks. Almost all are gray, and rust stains
their hulls.
   They include the Glomar Explorer, the CIA ship built to retrieve
a sunken Soviet submarine. Since the secret voyage off Hawaii in
1974, the 618-foot ship has been waiting for a new role.
   ``We keep the Explorer here for the Navy,'' Johnston said,
explaining the Glomar isn't Maritime Administration property like
nearly all the other ships.
   You can't visit the Glomar, but the Meredith Victory, dubbed
``The Gallant Lady'' for rescuing thousands of Korean War refugees,
is a good substitute.
   Rust was rampant. Paint chips littered the deck, leaving metal
naked to the elements. Painters used to keep busy on the fleet, but
money ran out in the mid-1980s.
   ``Besides, to us rust is no big deal as long as the metal is
sound,'' Johnston said as he stamped his foot to show the steel's
hardness. ``If it really got bad we could put another plate over
it.''
   Unlike the outside, the ship's interior was clean, almost
spotless - and creepy.
   Charts, books, spare parts, bedding and other items were left
where they were in 1971 when the ship returned from Vietnam. The
lack of interior rust is maintained by systems that keep airborne
moisture low.
   Below deck, it must look much as it did in December 1950, when
it evacuated 14,000 Koreans as Chinese troops besieged the city of
Hungnam. Five babies were born during the voyage that ended in
Pusan on Christmas Day.
   Built in 1945, the cargo vessel served in World War II. It
became part of the reserve fleet after Korea, only to be pulled out
for duty in Vietnam.
   Could it happen again?
   It would take a presidential act to call out the reserve fleet,
which is supposed to be ready to sail on 30 to 120 days' notice.
The Ready Reserve, 96 newer ships kept at several ports, was set up
to carry heavy military gear on five to 20 days' notice.
   Much of the Ready Reserve, including some ships from here, were
called up after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August.
   ``Sealift ships carried 90 percent of the Desert Shield
equipment,'' Johnston said with obvious pride. ``Planes just can't
do it.''
   The older ships are routinely sold for salvage and the money
goes to buy ``newer'' vessels for the fleet, its caretaker said.
   ``To us,'' he said, ``a 20-year-old ship is still new.''

   ``The Godfather Part III'' made U.S. holiday
audiences an offer they couldn't refuse, a chance to catch the
final chapter in the saga of the fictional Mafia family, the
Corleones.
   Another long-awaited offering, ``The Bonfire of the Vanities''
went down in flames. In the five-day holiday period ending Tuesday
night, director Brian De Palma's adaptation of the Tom Wolfe best
seller made $4.2 million, finishing in eighth place.
   ``Home Alone,'' the comedy about an 8-year-old boy outsmarting
two bungling burglars, held its grip on first place. It earned
$15.1 million to claim the top spot for the sixth straight week.
   The latest ``Godfather'' episode, starring Al Pacino, Diane
Keaton and Andy Garcia, grossed $6.4 million on Christmas Day, the
day it opened, according to figures released Wednesday by Exhibitor
Relations Co. Inc.
   ``Godfather'' played only on the last day of the period, yet
placed third. Paramount Pictures said it was the biggest Christmas
Day box-office take in movie history.
   The Arnold Schwarzenegger film ``Kindergarten Cop'' finished
second, with $11.3 million in ticket sales.
   ``Edward Scissorhands'' was fourth with $6 million. Kevin
Costner's ``Dances With Wolves'' was fifth with $5.91 million. The
sequel ``Look Who's Talking Too'' landed in sixth with $5.86
million.
   In its first weekend of wide release, the international spy
thriller ``The Russia House'' was seventh with $4.4 million.
   Robert Redford's ``Havana'' fell to 13th in a lackluster third
week of release, with $1.6 million.
   In limited release, Woody Allen's ``Alice'' made $36,274 on
three screens and director Penny Marshall's ``Awakenings'' grossed
$417,076 on 12 screens.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales Friday through Tuesday as
tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross,
number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and
number of weeks in release.
   Figures are based on a combination of actual box-office receipts
and studio projections where actual figures are not immediately
available.
   1. ``Home Alone,'' 20th Century Fox, $15.1 million, 2,108
screens, $7,059 per screen, $118.8 million, six weeks.

   At least 390 people were reported killed in traffic accidents
during the Christmas holiday period.
   The toll, from reports Wednesday by law enforcement officials
from across the nation, included accidents from 6 p.m. Friday
through midnight Tuesday. It was on the low end of the projection
of 380 to 480 deaths from the National Safety Council in Chicago.
   California, the nation's most populous state, had the highest
number of traffic deaths with 55, followed by Florida with 32 and

<HEAD>Tiny Luxembourg Faces Huge Task in EC Presidency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAF CASERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LUXEMBOURG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Luxembourg takes over the European Community's
presidency on Tuesday, with war looming in the Persian Gulf, world
trade talks in disarray and Europe in full transformation.
   The Grand Duchy, a tiny speck on the map with only about 0.1
percent of the population in the 12-nation community, has a good
track record in handling the rotating six-month EC presidencies.
   Jacques Santer, prime minister of the 378,400 Luxembourgers, is
convinced the mouse will roar again when his country takes over the
community's presidency from Italy as 1991 begins.
   ``During all of our presidencies we always came up with
results,'' Santer said in a recent interview.
   Five years ago, the Luxembourg presidency paved the way for the
Single European Act, an updated constitution that pushes the trade
bloc toward creating a truly unified market after 1992.
   This time around, new initiatives to create economic, monetary
and political union by the turn of the century have been thrust
into Santer's lap.
   The Christian Democrat plans to act as a mediator between the
EC's powerhouses - Germany, France and Britain - to finalize the
blueprint for European unity.
   ``Because we are so small, the others do not suspect us of
having ulterior self-serving motives,'' he said.
   Shoehorned between Germany, France and Belgium, Luxembourg
occupies a key crossroads on the continent, straddling Europe's
main cultures - the Romanic and Germanic. It is also well-connected
with both the rich north and poor south in the community.
   The Persian Gulf crisis might prove the first test of
Luxembourg's mettle.
   The EC has said it would not hold talks with Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz unless the United States first reaches
agreement with Iraq on exchanging foreign ministers' visits.
   If the EC agrees to talk with Iraq, that task would fall to
Luxembourg's Foreign Minister Jacques Poos.
   During Luxembourg's six months, a lot of energy will be spent on
two conferences - one on economic and monetary union, the other on
political union -to pave the way for a more unified Europe.
   Disarray reigns on how fast monetary union should be achieved,
Santer said.
   He said calls for an independent EC defense organization are not
realistic and it remains ``essential that we keep a partnership
with the United States'' within NATO - the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   The partnership with Washington has been strained in global
trade, where the EC has resisted U.S. proposals that it reduce
price supports and subsidies for farmers.
   The agricultural dispute blocked an agreement in world trade
talks held in Brussels, Belgium earlier this month. The talks are
to resume in Geneva next month.
   Santer, stressing the progress that has been made in the other
14 sectors covered by the trade talks, said farming should not
block an overall accord. He argued in favor of a final deal that,
if need be, excludes agriculture.

   Violence erupted in three movie
theaters showing ``The Godfather Part III.'' In the worst outbreak,
four bystanders were shot, one fatally.
   All the incidents happened on Christmas, the day the movie
opened.
   A man was slashed at a ``Godfather'' screening in New York City
and a woman was charged with menacing another moviegoer with a
knife in a dispute over noisy popcorn eating in Independence, Mo.
   Four people were shot in a Long Island theater when two groups
of teen-agers exchanged gunfire, spraying shots in the movie house
packed with about 700 people, who fled in panic.
   The shootout came about an hour into show, after an argument
escalated into a shouting match between two groups seated in
different parts of the Sunrise Cinema theater, Nassau County
Detective Sgt. William Cocks said Wednesday.
   A group of about 10 teen-agers moved and surrounded the other
group before opening fire, Cocks said. The second group apparently
returned fire.
   When officers arrived, the gangster film was still running in
the virtually deserted movie house. Spent shells showed that at
least four handguns were used. The subject of the argument was
unknown. No arrests were made.
   A 15-year-old from New York City was shot in the head and died
while undergoing surgery Wednesday. Another teen-ager, shot in the
eye, was listed in stable condition.
   A married couple, both 23, were treated for gunshot wounds to
the arm and shoulder.
   In Missouri, Marilyn McMahon said her heart jumped during a
scene in the gangster film in which a knife is held to a woman's
throat, but it didn't compare to the real thing later during the
screening.
   Ada L. Young, 58, of Raytown, was arrested as she left the
theater and was charged with assault Wednesday in Independence
Municipal Court.
   ``Maybe those things are true that you read - that violence
maybe begets violence,'' Mrs. McMahon said Wednesday. ``My heart
was beating very fast for a long time after that.''
   Mrs. McMahon said she was sitting in back row with her daughter
and two of her daughter's friends during an afternoon show. While
they ate popcorn, a woman and her son turned around to complain.
   When Mrs. McMahon suggested they move to other seats, they got
up and walked behind her.
   ``One of them grabbed my hair and pulled my head back,'' Mrs.
McMahon said. ``That knife was right there at the side of my
neck.''
   Mrs. McMahon said she jerked free and ran to the lobby to alert
theater workers, who called police.
   Charlie Hobbs, manager of the Blue Ridge Cinema, said he didn't
think the incident was related to the violence in the movie.
   ``If we had Walt Disney's ``Bambi,'' it probably wouldn't even
hit the newspaper,'' he said.
   In the other incident, New York police said a man was cut during
an altercation with several men at a Manhattan theater. The victim
was treated at a hospital. No arrests were made and the cause of
the fight was undetermined.

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Roswell P. Barnes, a leader of
the ecumenical movement who headed the U.S. conference of the World
Council of Churches, has died at age 89.
   He died Friday at Doylestown Hospital after a long battle
against heart disease, said his daughter, Margaret Lehrecke.
   Barnes, a Presbyterian, was a member of a dedicated group of
Christian ecumenists who built the Geneva-based organization of
Anglican, Eastern Orthodox, Protestant and old or national Catholic
churches.
   In 1958, he was appointed executive secretary of the World
Council's U.S. conference. A heart ailment forced him to retire in
1964.
   Barnes served as associate general secretary of both the Federal
Council of Churches from 1940 to 1950 and its successor, the
National Council of Churches, from 1954 to 1958.
   Barnes wrote many articles and two books, ``A Christian
Imperative,'' published in 1941, and ``Under Orders,'' published in
1961. He was born into an Iowa family with generations of
Presbyterian ministers.

   A federal judge granted American
Airlines a temporary restraining order barring pilots from staging
job actions that could delay flights or cause them to be canceled.
   The pilots union has said no such organized moves were taken.
   U.S. District Judge John McBryde granted the order late
Wednesday and will rule next week whether to make it permanent.
   American's lawyers complained that sick leave, delays blamed on
equipment and other stalling tactics skyrocketed after its contract
with the Allied Pilots Association became eligible for
renegotiation last Jan. 1. The airline accused the pilots of taking
job actions that violate federal law.
   The APA, which represents about 8,000 pilots, wouldn't comment
immediately. The airline said flight delays blamed on pilots have
run as high as 215 on Dec. 19, compared with an average of 89 daily
delays in 1989. Flight cancellations this month because of a lack
of pilots reached 194 Wednesday, American said.

   In 1968, Filipino seamen sailed a
cast-off U.S. warship across the Pacific for service in their navy.
In November, the 48-year-old vessel finally sank in a typoon.
   The saga of the patrol ship Nueva Vizcaya, which sank Nov. 14
off Cebu, typifies the problems facing the navy, the stepchild of a
poorly equipped armed forces.
   Although a nation of 7,100 islands, with a longer coastline than
the continental United States, the Philippines has the most
primitive navy in Southeast Asia.
   ``Being an archipelago, we must become a sea power or we will be
powerless,'' navy chief Rear Admiral Mariano Dumancas said in a
recent interview. The reality makes Dumancas' words seem comical.
   The navy's inventory consists mostly of World War II
hand-me-downs from the United States, including the Nueva Vizcaya,
built in July 1942 and once known as the Altrus.
   The vintage ships have poor navigational equipment and
inadequate anti-pollution maritime devices, according to a secret
navy report obtained by The Associated Press. The report said
Philippine warships average 41 years of age, compared with 19 for
the Indonesian navy and 13 for the Malaysians.
   ``It's not safe or effective to have these floating coffins
used,'' admitted a senior navy officer, who spoke on condition he
not be named.
   The demise of the Nueva Vizcaya, which spent its last few years
being towed from dock to dock because its engine was inoperable,
left the navy 22 patrol ships, 21 transport vessels, 85 small craft
and 14 aircraft.
   ``On the surface, this inventory looks huge,'' the classified
report said. ``In reality... they have very limited operational
capabilities, and have become very expensive to operate and
maintain.''
   The report admitted that ``in an honest-to-goodness encounter,
the capacity of our men-of-war to sustain as a viable naval force
is extremely doubtful.''
   Among its other deficiencies, the Philippine navy has no
capability against submarines, missile attack or mine warfare.
   While the U.S. Navy has a formidable fleet of carriers,
destroyers and assault ships in Subic Bay, 50 miles northwest of
Manila, Philippine sailors patrol their own waters with three
wooden outriggers.
   Occasionally, the navy must borrow private boats for raids
against pirates and smugglers, according to navy officers in Subic.
   ``Countries in this region are modernizing their navies and some
are in good shape,'' said Joris Janssen-Lok, naval editor of the
respected Jane's Defense Weekly in London. ``But this country is
indeed deplorable.''
   Since independence from the United States in 1946, land forces
have traditionally received the largest share of the defense budget
because of persistent internal security problems, including Moslem
and Communist insurgencies.
   Meanwhile, Filipino officials grew lax in building an effective
navy because there was no immediate threat and even if there were,
they could always rely on the Americans.
   But the Mutual Defense Treaty obligates the United States to
defend the Philippines against foreign aggression and not combat
smugglers, pirates or incursions by foreign navies.
   ``The prolonged presence of the U.S. military in our country
made us neglect to undertake the necessary long-term steps to build
our external defense over the years,'' said Sen. Leticia Shahani,
chief sponsor of a congressional bill to modernize the navy.
   Dependence on the U.S. Navy is often illustrated during
typhoons, air and sea accidents and other disasters when Philippine
authorities turn to the Americans because they lack the capability
for their own search and rescue.
   ``We have become too dependent on the Americans,'' said Sen.
Juan Ponce Enrile, a former defense minister. ``We have neglected
to modernize our navy.''
   The psychological blanket that the U.S. presence provides has
resulted in giving less priority to buying, repairing and
modernizing ships.
   Last year, the navy received 16 percent of the defense budget
with the army and the Philippine Constabulary receiving more than
half.
   Realizing the need to modernize, the navy proposed an additional
allocation now equal to $430 million to buy new ships over 5 years.
But inflation and the falling peso are threatening to increase
costs beyond those projections.
   ``There is an urgent need to upgrade the navy, but
realistically, we cannot afford it,'' said Sen. Ernesto Maceda,
chairman of the Senate defense committee. ``We have to subsidize
rice, fuel, schools, buy medicines - basics first.''

   A founder of the right-to-life group
Operation Rescue alleged that the hospital where Nancy Cruzan died
is ``lining people up'' for euthanasia. Officials denied it.
   Ms. Cruzan, 33, who had been in a persistent vegetative state
for nearly eight years, died at the Missouri Rehabilitation Center
on Wednesday. The feeding tube that had kept her alive since a 1983
car crash had been removed 12 days earlier at her parents' request,
approved by a judge.
   ``I'm curious to see who's going to be next at this facility,''
said the Rev. Joseph Foreman of Atlanta. The co-founder of
Operation Rescue said he learned from hospital sources whom he did
not identify that several patients are candidates for euthanasia.
   Don Lamkins, the rehabilitation center's director, said one or
two patients at the center have about the same extent of brain
damage as Ms. Cruzan did.
   ``But I have never had any indication from the families of those
people that they want to do that (euthanasia),'' he said.
   Ms. Cruzan's parents, Joe and Joyce Cruzan, fought a three-year
legal battle to remove their daughter's feeding tube, saying she
would not want to live in a persisitent vegetative state.
   The legal efforts led to a landmark Supreme Court decision on
June 25 stating that patients like Ms. Cruzan could be allowed to
die, but only if there was ``clear and convincing'' evidence that
was their wish.
   Several of Ms. Cruzan's former co-workers then testified in
state court that she said she would never want to live ``like a
vegetable.'' Judge Charles Teel Jr. ruled Dec. 14 that her feeding
tube could be removed.
   Making history was a woman friends and family members remembered
as a free spirit who loved children and animals and had embraced
life with joy until her car ran off the road as she returned home
from work on Jan. 11, 1983.
   ``She lived life to the fullest pretty much all her life,'' her
mother said. ``That's more than a lot of people do.''
   ``She was always the clown, but not a smart aleck,'' her father
said. ``And yet for all her orneriness, she was just as cute as she
could be.''
   Foreman complained that Ms. Cruzan's family let a tragedy occur
that holds grave implications for the future.
   ``I think in the next few years you will see an entire industry
spring up around putting people to death whom family, friends and
so forth have deemed to be no longer of use to anybody,'' he said.
   The family stood by its decision in a statement released at the
hospital hours after Ms. Cruzan's death.
   ``Knowing Nancy as only a family can, there remains no question
that we made the choice she would want,'' the family said.

<HEAD>Roh Shuffles Cabinet In Pre-Election Housecleaning; More Dissidents
Arrested</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLY SMITH TUNNEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo today named a
new prime minister and reshuffled his Cabinet in a bid to polish
his party's image before a series of elections starting next year.
   Also today, authorities announced more than 50 more arrests as
party of a continuing crackdown on anti-government activity.
   Some opposition and dissident groups charge the arrests are part
of a scheme to suppress dissent as Roh's Democratic Liberal Party
approaches its first local elections in 30 years.
   After Roh named him as prime minister, Ro Jai-bong immediately
issued a statement calling for law and order and said the
conservative government will make further talks with longtime rival
North Korea a priority.
   ``The priorities will be on establishing social discipline as
well as law and order, progress in inter-Korea dialogue and
multilateral diplomacy,'' said Ro, a former presidential aide.
   ``I am disappointed,'' Kim Dae-jung, head of the leading
opposition Party for Peace and Democracy said of the Cabinet
changes. He said they made the government more conservative and
rightist.
   But the naming of a new prime minister and nine new Cabinet
ministers indicate little substantive changes in policy, either
domestic or foreign.
   Some appointments reflected emphasis on dialogue and exchanges
with archrival North Korea.
   A government intelligence agency today announced the arrest of
53 radicals on charges of infiltrating campuses and the military,
allegedly to foment violent revolution.
   The arrests bring to 84 the number of people charged in the last
two days with anti-government activity. The people were arrested in
recent weeks and police and intelligence agencies said dozens more
radicals are being sought.
   The president is midway in a five-year term which ends in 1992.
   He has made dramatic progress in foreign relations by expanding
Seoul's ties with Communist and former Communist nations. But
support for domestic policies is at an all time low as he prepares
for next year's local elections.
   No date has been set for the balloting, but it is expected in
the first half of the year.
   Three more national elections, including those for Parliament
and a new president will be held in the next two years.
   The largely ceremonial post of prime minister has become
increasingly significant because it acts as chief delegate to
high-level talks on easing tensions with Communist North Korea.
   A fourth round of talks is scheduled for February.
   In another move seen to reflect changing relations with the
north, Choi Ho-joong was moved from foreign minister to unification
minister and will serve as deputy prime ministerr.
   Choi was instrumental in helping Seoul forge dramatic new ties
with former Communist allies of North Korea. The government hopes
its actions will force the north from its isolation and lead to
eventual unification of the peninsula, divided since 1945.
   The new foreign minister is Lee Sang-ok, a career diplomat
currently posted in Geneva with the rank of ambassador as chief of
mission to international agencies.
   The economic ministers were unchanged, but Lee Bong-suh, a U.S.
educated economist, was named trade and industry minister. The
government hopes he will mend escalating trade frictions between
Seoul and Washington.
   Roh has changed the 24-member Cabinet several times since he
took office in February 1988.

<HEAD>Maine Stores Prepare for End of Blue Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GLENN ADAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Department store manager Jon Saucier says
he transferred from New Hampshire to Maine so he could get away
from having to open for business on Sundays.
   But a blue law that kept large stores in Maine from opening on
the sabbath passes into history this weekend. For Saucier, it will
be business as usual on Sunday, just like it is in every other
state except North Dakota.
   Saucier, manager of Service Merchandise in Augusta, sees the
Sunday sales law approved by voters Nov. 6 as more of a convenience
for consumers than a boon for business.
   Other retail officials agree but most - knowing that their
competitors will be open Sunday - will be ready too.
   ``I think they'll wade into it,'' said Saucier. ``I think it'll
be a gradual thing.''
   Spokeswoman Margaret McEwan of Shaw's Supermarkets Inc., which
operates 17 stores in Maine, said ``it's almost like deja vu''
because no one knew what to expect when Massachusetts lifted its
Sunday sales ban a few years back.
   ``My expectation is that at first, those who resisted (Maine's
change) will not shop Sundays, but as time goes on, that will
change,'' McEwan said.
   Sunday has become Shaw's third busiest day of the week in
Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Hampshire, she said.
   Robert Reny Sr., president of Reny's department stores, doubts
consumers will buy more with an extra day to shop.
   ``There are no more dollars in that pie,'' Reny said.
   Reny, a leading opponent of the blue law change, said
competition and consumer demand are the only reasons he plans to
open his 14 stores Sunday.
   The new law applies to stores with more than 5,000 square feet
of selling space.
   The old law had a number of exemptions. One let large stores
open from noon to 5 p.m. on the four Sundays before Christmas.
Another let the L.L. Bean outdoor goods company in Freeport stay
open 365 days a year.
   Most Maine stores took advantage of the pre-Christmas loophole,
but saw business drift to New Hampshire when the holiday shopping
season was over, said marketing director Marc Letendre of the Maine
Mall in South Portland.
   He predicted that the mall's 140 stores will gain a significant
amount of business from customers who used to shop out of state.
   Service Merchandise's Saucier isn't so sure. He said figures he
gathered during his 12 years in New Hampshire showed that Maine
stores did more business on Saturdays, while Sundays were better
for those in the Granite State.
   ``When the weekend was over, we were even,'' Saucier said.

   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has written personally
to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein urging an immediate and
unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait, the Foreign
Ministry said today.
   Officials said Japan's ambassador to Iraq, Kunio Katakura,
delivered the letter, the first of its kind from Kaifu, to First
Deputy Premier Taha Yassin Ramadan on Wednesday.
   Kaifu appealed for a peaceful settlement of the Persian Gulf
crisis in accordance with U.N. resolutions, and cited the enormous
pain and toil Japan experienced in World War II and in
rehabilitating the nation from the ruins of the war, they said.
   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, Japan has pledged $2
billion in assistance for U.S.-dominated multinational forces
deployed against Iraq.
   It also has pledged $2 billion in aid to states in the gulf
region that have suffered economically from the U.N.-ordered
embargo on trade with Iraq.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge known for sending lawyers
scurrying to dictionaries to understand his rulings has added more
obscure vocabulary to the legal record, including a reference to
gladiators forced to fight blind.
   On Wednesday, Judge Ferdinand Fernandez of the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals delved into antiquity to compliment the losing
side in a series of lawsuits over land in Hawaii.
   ``They have been effective gladiators, and we do not by this
decision convert them into andabatae,'' he wrote.
   An andabata, according to the second unabridged edition of
Webster's New International Dictionary, was a gladiator who fought
blinded by a helmet.
   Fernandez added to his reputation by calling a motion in the
case ``otiose,'' or futile, and saying it was ``pellucid,'' or easy
to understand, that the state was immune from the lawsuit.
   Previously, Fernandez had pulled ``facinorous'' (atrociously
wicked) and ``ensorcell'' (bewitch) from his bag of big words.

<HEAD>Southwestern Soldiers In Blistering Middle East Miss Their Hot
Sauce</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like good jalapeno peppers, letters from
Southwestern soldiers in the Middle East lonely for some hot sauce
are enough to bring a tear to the eye.
   ``I am desperate,'' wrote Army Staff Sgt. James A. Miller of the
82nd Airborne Division. ``San Antonio is my home and Pace Picante
sauces are on my table all the time. And if you could spare a few
quarts, this paratrooper would be grateful.''
   San Antonio-based Pace Foods Inc. obliged by sending 2,000
bottles of the spicy sauce to troops in the Persian Gulf, but the
letters from soldiers tired of bland military chow keep coming in.
   One letter from a soldier was enclosed with picture of six GIs
holding four empty hot sauce bottles upside down.
   ``If y'all find it all in y'alls heart to send us a sizable
donation of medium Picante sauce to my unit, it would be a big
morale booster,'' wrote Army Spc. Charles R. Moulder, a soldier
with an artillery unit.
   The company's top executive said the mouth-burning sauce even
could help military men and women somehow beat the Saudi Arabian
heat.
   ``Nobody nows for sure, but a lot of people think chili peppers
cool the body by making it perspire more,'' said R.J. Sands, Pace's
president and chief executive officer. ``That's why people in warm
climates eat more chilies.''

   As frigid weather swept the country around
Christmastime, Minneapolis was minus 24.
   That's cars, not degrees.
   Police tallied 24 reports of cars stolen while the owners left
them running so the engines could warm up.
   One of them was Jeffrey Persons, whose 1979 Dodge Colt was
purloined on Sunday, when temperatures dipped to 20 below in the
Twin Cities.
   ``I blame the cold weather for my stolen car,'' Persons said
Wednesday. ``Right now I'd like to move south.''
   Persons, 22, said he went outside to start his car and when it
started, he returned to the warmth of his apartment.
   Five minutes later Persons watched from his window as two men
darted into his car and drove off. By the time he got to the
street, the car was a block away.
   ``This always happens in the cold weather,'' said Lt. Robert
Vanusek, head of the police department's auto theft unit. ``People
start the car, leave it running and then some nitwit jumps in there
and drives away.''
   Locking the car doesn't solve the problem, Vanusek said. In
about a third of the 24 cases reported during the holiday period
the doors were locked, he said.
   ``If you're going to warm up the car, put on some heavy clothes
and sit there,'' Vanusek said.

<HEAD>Report: Britain to Go Ahead With New Generation Of Nuclear Arms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper today quoted ministers as saying the
government has decided to deploy a new generation of nuclear
weapons to replace Britain's ageing free-fall nuclear bombs.
   The report in The Independent said ministers had told the paper
that despite the end of the Cold War, Britain will go ahead with
the deployment of tactical air-to-surface missiles (TASMs) to
replace the free-fall bomb system known as AW177.
   The paper did not name the government ministers.
   Britain and France are the only two West European powers which
maintain nuclear deterrent forces of their own, independent of the
NATO defense alliance.
   The Independent's report said: ``The only question still open is
over the type of (TASM) system to use and a decision is expected in
the New Year.
   ``Ministers are preparing a study of the options, including two
American systems and a possible Anglo-French missile. French
scientists have been involved in top secret talks at the Nuclear
Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston (45 miles west of London),
where the warheads would be designed and built...
   ``Britain's decision, yet to be announced, could be conveyed to
the NATO planning group at its meeting in late March. One
ministerial source said: `We are definitely going ahead with the
TASM. The only question is what type.'''
   The TASM project is in addition to the $9 billion Trident
nuclear missile system Britain has ordered to replace its aging
submarine-borne Polaris missiles.
   The Trident missiles, bought from the United States but to be
carried aboard submarines built in Britain, are due to become
operational in the mid-1990s.
   The Independent said the likely cost of the TASM program ranges
from $187 million for a system brought from the United States to
$1.87 billion if Britain decides to collaborate in a new
Anglo-French weapon.
   The paper said the TASM program would be highly controversial,
that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has urged the United
States not to sell any more nuclear technology to Britain after
delivery of the Trident missiles.
   ``If Britain sought to purchase U.S. TASMs, it would upset the
Soviets and could put back progress on confidence-building measures
leading to other arms reductions. But Britain is bound to point out
the number of warheads would be smaller than the bombs they
replace,'' the report said.
   It said government ministers are satisfied that TASMs are the
only credible way Britain can maintain the right mix of nuclear
weapons in its arsenal.

<HEAD>Eastern Gets Government Contract Worth Up To $100 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines got a badly needed boost with a
$100 million contract to carry federal employees traveling on
business next year.
   Financially troubled Eastern announced the contract Wednesday.
It is for more than 345 domestic and international routes. In 1990
the airline received 220 routes worth an estimated $52 million.
   The airline's court-appointed bankruptcy trustee, Martin R.
Shugrue, said in a statement he was ``pleased that the government
recognizes our fine record in providing safe, reliable
transportation at a good value.''
   The contract came while the federal prosecutors pursue a
60-count criminal indictment against Eastern and nine top managers,
charging that as recently as last month safety records and
maintenance documents were falsified to keep the airline's planes
flying. Eastern has denied the allegations.
   Miami-based Eastern, which has shriveled in size and lost
millions of dollars, has been operating under bankruptcy protection
since soon after an unresolved strike began in March 1989.
   In bankruptcy court last month, the airline's creditors sparred
with Eastern officials over whether the carrier could survive. U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland agreed to a life-saving cash
infusion.

<HEAD>Hotel Managers Turn Away Teens After Atlanta New Year's Eve
Trashing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On New Year's Eve, downtown hotels will hide
welcome mats.
   Last New Year's Eve teen-agers ran amok and trashed the Marriott
Marquis. This year, they're invited to go elsewhere.
   ``There will be no real party this year at the hotel,'' said
Steve Clanton, Marriott marketing director. ``We obviously don't
want anything like what we had last year.''
   Bottles, furniture and huge potted plants were tossed off
balconies into the atrium of the hotel. About 50 people, most
between 17 and 21 years old, were charged with crimes, including
assault, vandalism and reckless conduct. Paramedics treated more
than a dozen injured people.
   Only adult guests will be admitted and no large parties will be
allowed in rooms, Clanton said. Other downtown hotels are taking
similar precautions.
   ``You cannot check in here on that day unless you're 21 or
older,'' said Andre Schaefer, general manager of the Hilton. ``You
won't even come in the building.''
   Some hotels will have New Year's Eve parties, but security will
be extra tight and teen-agers will not be welcome.
   ``We close the hotel at noon on the 31st,'' said Nancy Ziprik,
Hyatt Regency spokeswoman. ``All our entrances will be closed off
and staffed by managers from that time on. Only those attending
parties or staying overnight are going to be allowed in. Also
starting at noon, we'll start carding guests. You must be 21 or
older to get in here.''

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, who suffered a
heart attack two days ago, was in serious condition today but his
health was not deteriorating, Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the
Congress of People's Deputies.
   ``We have called in the very best specialists. They are working
around the clock,'' the president said.
   Earlier in the day, Radio Moscow quoted Gorbachev's spokesman,
Vitaly Ignatenko, as saying Ryzhkov's condition had worsened and
``gives rise to grave concern.''
   But Gorbachev, who personally announced Ryzhkov's illness on
Wednesday, described his friend and political ally's condition in
more optimistic terms.
   ``His condition is serious but is not worsening ... Everything
possible is being done,'' he told the Congress, the country's
highest legislative body.
   Ryzhkov, 61, suffered a heart attack Tuesday night after
lawmakers voted to eliminated the Council of Ministers he heads.
The Congress of People's Deputies voted to replace it with a new
Cabinet under Gorbachev's direct control.
   It was unclear what role if any Ryzhkov might have in the
revamped system.
   Reformers seeking a swifter transition to a market economy have
long demanded Ryzhkov's resignation. But Gorbachev has steadfastly
stood by the man he appointed prime minister in 1985 shortly after
his own rise to power.
   Valery Ovcharenko, a spokesman for the Council of Ministers,
said today there were ``no negative changes'' in Ryzhkov's
condition.

<HEAD>Accused Mailbox Vandal Leaves Calling Card - Friend's Thumb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAYS, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An accused mailbox vandal left a calling card
- his friend's thumb.
   ``We had a perfect fingerprint,'' Ellis County sheriff's Deputy
Dave Zellmer said. He discovered the thumb Dec. 9 while
investigating a wrecked mailbox at the Victoria home of Bill
Berger.
   ``There was blood everywhere,'' Zellmer said. ``At first, I
thought it was a nose, then I saw it was a thumb.''
   Police say Darin Engel, 25, of Hays, hit the mailbox with his
pickup truck. He probably didn't know the mailbox - an ornate
sheet-metal box depicting two cowboys roping a cow - was mounted to
an iron pipe.
   The mangled box and pipe got hung up on the truck's underside.
While Engel shifted gears to rock the truck back and forth, Stephan
Lantz, 27, also of Hays, tried to loosen the box, Zellmer said.
   In the process, part of his thumb was severed.
   ``I never found any piece of the pickup, just the thumb,''
Zellmer said.
   The deputy checked a local hospital and found that Lantz had
been treated for a torn-off thumb and was sent to a Wichita
hospital for further treatment.
   Nearly a week later, Engel turned himself in. He took full
responsibility for the vandalism, Zellmer said.
   Vandalizing a mailbox is a federal offense, but U.S. officials
waived the right to prosecute Engel, Zellmer said.
   He will be prosecuted in state court on vandalism charges. If
convicted, he faces up to one year in prison and a $1,000 fine.

<HEAD>West Girds for Another Cold Snap While Rest of Nation Shivers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The frostbitten West got a brief respite today from cold that
ravaged citrus fruit, snapped water pipes and threatened lives, but
it still was unusually brisk for the rest of the United States.
   A mass of warm air spread across parts of Washington, Wyoming,
Idaho, California, Oregon, Arizona and Nevada, raising temperatures
in some areas by as much as 40 degrees.
   But the National Weather Service cautioned people not to get
used to it. Forecasters say a new cold front, as chilly as the last
one, will hit Washington full force by this evening and move south,
reaching Southern California by the weekend.
   Snow fell in Spokane, Wash., early today.
   ``It will be just as cold and the roads will get just as sloppy
and iced over,'' said Carl Cerniglia a weather service
meteorologist in Washington. ``People should be prepared with snow
tires and chains.''
   Before the last cold front dissipated, most of Washington was
paralyzed by heavy snowfall, broken water pipes and gas lines,
traffic gridlock and other weather woes.
   California was socked with hundreds of millions of dollars in
agricultural losses and workers preparing for the Tournament of
Roses Parade in Pasadena on New Year's Day had to scramble to find
replacements for wilted flowers.
   Frozen water pipes burst all over the West, even in normally
non-freezing areas, like California's seaside Santa Cruz area. The
state capital of Sacramento recorded seven consecutive days of
record low temperatures, including a 23 on Wednesday.
   Other record lows set around the nation Wednesday were:
Aberdeen, S.D., 29 degrees below zero; Albuquerque, N.M., 5
degrees; and Amarillo, Texas, 5 degrees.
   Across the nation, the cold spell has caused more than 80
weather-related deaths.
   While the West was much warmer today, more frigid weather was in
store for much of the Midwest, East and South, with rain or snow
expected in parts of West Virginia, Mississippi, Missouri,
Kentucky, Oklahoma and Illinois.
   Freezing rain was falling in Arkansas early today and officials
worried about exhausting supplies of salt and gravel used to melt
ice and snow.
   ``We used more this weekend than we used all last winter,'' said
Fayettville Public Works Manager David Cox.
   Out West, people were still digging out from the first storm.
   Broken water pipes flooded buildings all over Seattle, including
the Kingdome basketball arena, and officials searched for the
source of a break that was releasing as much as 10 million gallons
of water a day somewhere in southwest Seattle.
   Northern Californians also dealt with broken and frozen water
pipes that shut off service to 5,000 homes in the Santa Cruz area
earlier in the week.
   California citrus growers reported that cold destroyed 80
percent of the state's $248 million navel orange crop. The state's
avocado, lemon and strawberry crops also sustained heavy losses.
   Meanwhile, Florida continued to escape the cold wave, with
temperatures generally in the 70s and 80s. But some tropical fish
farmers, devastated by last year's cold snap were taking no chances
this time.
   ``We're trying to sell every blessed fish we can before the cold
weather hits,'' said David Stahl, who estimates he lost 90 percent
of his stock during a three-day freeze last year.

   The West got a brief break today from a week of paralyzing cold,
while the rest of the nation endured another dose of frigid
weather.
   Rain fell on Arkansas and Tennessee early today, while in
Washington state, rain pelted Seattle and snow fell on Spokane.
   The brunt of the storm was expected to hit Washington tonight,
dropping several inches of snow across most of the state and
lowering temperatures dramatically.
   The storm front should then move south, hitting Southern
California, Arizona and Nevada by the weekend with more freezing
temperatures. Frost over the last week devastated much of
California's citrus crop.
   Winter weather advisories were in effect today for snow, sleet
and rain in parts of Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri,
Montana and Washington state.
   High temperatures were expected to vary widely across the
nation, with lows from zero to 10 degrees along the Canadian border
states; in the 20s and 30s along the Mid-Atlantic states, most of
the Midwest and Pacific Northwest; in the 40s in the Southwest; the
50s in parts of the South and Southern California; and the 70s and

   Kuwait's exiled foreign minister said today that
he believes it is too late for peace initiatives and that war is
thus inevitable in the Persian Gulf.
   ``The whole world has given enough time for a peaceful
settlement of the gulf crisis,'' Sheik Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah told
a news conference.
   He and Kuwait's ousted emir, Sheik Jaber Al-Sabah, arrived
Wednesday for a three-day visit.
   Chinese President Yang Shangkun told the emir on Wednesday that
before considering war the international community should first
exert more economic and diplomatic pressure on Iraq, the official
Xinhua News Agency said.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing wa asked at a news
conference today what new sanctions China would suggest, but was
unable to name any.
   He simply reiterated his government's position that
``unremitting efforts'' should be made for peace.
   A militarily enforced U.N. embargo imposed after President
Saddam Hussein seied Kuwait on Aug. 2 has halted virtually all
trade with Iraq, which had been heavily dependent on imports, but
has failed to persuade Saddam to back down.
   Saddam faces a U.N.-imposed deadline to withdraw by Jan. 15 or
face possible attack.
   The Kuwaiti foreign minister said he had not heard of any
Chinese peace initiatives, but he maintained that only military
force would dislodge Iraq from Kuwait.
   ``Whether by the Arab world, whether by the friendly countries,
whether by the Third World countries, or by the big powers, it is
very late for such (peace) initiatives. It would not be useful,''
he said.
   The foreign minister said Yang told the emir China would
continue to press for an unconditional Iraqi withdrawal.
   The Kuwaiti foreign minister said the emir came to thank Chinese
officials for their support in international efforts to dislodge
Iraqi troops from Kuwait. He said Kuwaiti leaders appreciate
China's position on the gulf crisis, even though it refused to back
the United Nation's authorization of the use of force to dislodge
Iraq from Kuwait.
   China abstained in the vote on the U.N. Security Council
resolution last month, but supported all previous U.N. measures
seeking to pressure Saddam into withdrawal.
   The Kuwaiti emir ends his three-day China visit on Friday and
will return to exile in Taif, Saudi Arabia, Kuwaiti officials said.

<TEXT>
   Who wants to buy a bunch of Belgian
stretcars that have been around for 25 to 30 years?
   At least three major European cities.
   The prospect was problematic for Belgian foreign trade
officials.
   Seems the streetcars are practically indestructible. The foreign
cities that buy them - Bucharest, The Hague, and Marseille are
interested - will be lost markets for new Belgian streetcars.
   On the other hand, there's pride at stake.
   The ``Societe des Transports Intercommunaux de Bruxelles''
(STIB), which owns the cars, recalls that it sold some of its old
streetcars to Cairo, which later resold them to Copenhagen.
   And 40-year-old Belgian trolleys are still running in the
streets of Asuncion, Paraguay.
   The cars' owner said Wednesday that it has offers from those
three major European cities for 92 old trolleys, and would like to
sell at least 50 at $50,000 apiece.
   That will make for more room in jammed depots, for one. The
company has 48 new trolleys on order - from Belgian firms, of
course - for $100 million.
   STIB says Bucharest wants to reuse the old streetcars, Marseille
is mainly interested in their bogies, the same as those on its own
cars, and The Hague wants them for spare parts.
   The company gave up the idea of modernizing the old cars. That
would cost more than new streetcars.

   A transformer exploded in Manhattan's Financial
District today, sending flames eight stories high and possibly
spewing hazardous PCBs on seven floors of a skyscraper, officials
said.
   Twenty-six firefighters and 14 others were treated for possible
exposure to the carcinogenic polychlorinated biphenyls, said Lt.
Jim Powell, a Fire Department spokesman.
   The transformer exploded just after 12:30 a.m., Powell said. The
resulting blaze blew out windows in the fifth, sixth and seventh
floors of a nearby building and caused a small fire in the second
floor, he said.
   The fire was under control at 3:16 a.m.
   Officials from the Department of Environmental Protection were
on the scene, he said, and samples from the building were taken to
the department's chemical lab for analysis.
   Of the 26 firefighters treated for possible PCB contamination,
four were hospitalized, he said.

<TEXT>
   Helicopter gunships killed 10 Tamil
rebels who attempted a suicide attack on an army camp in tractors
loaded with explosives, government officials said today.
   Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne said Wednesday's
operation was the third suicide attempt on the Elephant Pass camp
in the past week. Wijeratne, who is in charge of the government
campaign against the Tamil Tiger rebels, said that in each case the
attack was foiled by helicopter gunships.
   ``Troops in helicopter gunships Wednesday killed a large number
of rebels when they destroyed some vehicles loaded with explosives
and being driven into the Elephant Pass camp,'' Wijeratne said at
the weekly Cabinet briefing.
   He did not give details of the previous attempts.
   Military officials said 10 Tigers were killed in the attack
Wednesday. They said the helicopters fired on the Tigers while they
were driving four tractors and a jeep into the Elephant Pass camp.
   The camp, 180 miles northeast of Colombo, guards one of the main
entrances to the Tiger-controlled Jaffna Peninsula.
   There was no confirmation of the report from the remote area or
from the Tigers, who seldom disclose casualties or details of their
operations.
   Five other Tamil Tigers were shot and killed by government
troops in two other encounters in northern Sri Lankan on Wednesday,
the military officials said, speaking as usual on condition of
anonymity.
   The rebels launched the war for a separate Tamil homeland in
1983, accusing the Sinahlese-controlled government of
discriminating against the Tamil minority. More than 14,000 people
have been killed since then.
   Wijeratne said he was unaware of a Tiger truce offer to mark the
new year. Sathasivam Krishnakumar, a London-based leader of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, said in a Christmas Day telephone
interview the Tigers would offer a unilateral cease-fire starting
Dec. 31 and lasting two or three days.
   The latest battles between the government and the Tigers started
six months ago when the rebels broke a 13-month-old cease-fire,
overran police stations and massacred hundreds of police officers.
   Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
have long complained of discrimination by Sinhalese in jobs, the
economy and use of the Sinhala language.
   Sinhalese comprise 75 percent of the population and have
controlled the government since the Indian Ocean island became
independent from Britain in 1948.

   Israeli troops shelled Shiite Moslem
villages in the Syrian-policed Bekaa Valley of east Lebanon during
the night, wounding one person, police reported today.
   They said more than 50 155mm howitzer shells were fired into the
villages of Qalia, Dellafi and Mazraat Luci between 8 p.m.
Wednesday and 1 a.m. today.
   The shellfire came from an artillery battery on a hill near the
Israeli-occupied town of Shebaa, police reported.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said the shelling began shortly after guerrillas
attempted t infiltrate Israel's self-proclaimed ``security zone''
in south Lebanon.
   ``After foiling the infiltration attempt, the Israelis opened up
with artillery fire, apparently in retaliation,'' the spokesman
said.
   The violence came amid increased action in the region, with
Palestinian and Lebanese guerrillas stepping up their attacks on
the Israeli buffer zone.

   A 3-year-old girl was revived after she
wandered out into the snow and froze to the point of clinical
death, her body temperature 24 degrees below normal.
   Brittany Eichelberger was in critical but stable condition
Wednesday at Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh, nursing supervisor
Patty Wentroble said.
   Her fingers and toes were frostbitten, but she was sitting up in
bed and talking, Wentroble said.
   ``The remarkable thing was that the child's body temperature was
74 degrees and she was successfully resuscitated,'' said Dr. John
Veach of Davis Memorial Hospital, where Brittany was revived.
   ``She was in complete cardiac arrest with no heart activitiy and
no breathing,'' Veach said. ``Because she was so cold, she had a
deathlike appearance, and in fact she was dead.''
   Brittany was found lying in snow Monday morning clad only in a
nightgown. It was 27 degrees at the time. Her mother had last
checked on her five hours earlier.
   Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed and a tube put down
Brittany's throat to get her breathing again while she was rushed
to the hospital, where she became responsive about three hours
later, Veach said.
   Brittany likely will remain hospitalized another three weeks,
Wentroble said.

<HEAD>Nation's Capital Faces Financial Disaster, Financial Adviser Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's capital faces a financial crisis
rivalling that of New York City when it tottered near bankruptcy in
the 1970s, a financial adviser to Mayor-elect Sharon Pratt Dixon
says.
   Franklin D. Raines, chairman of Dixon's Transition Financial
Management Committee, says Washington's deficit for this fiscal
year could reach $300 million, $100 million more than the
administration of outgoing Mayor Marion Barry estimated.
   ``In five or six months the district will run out of cash and be
unable to meet payrolls or pay its bills unless drastic actions are
taken immediately,'' Raines wrote in a Dec. 21 memo obtained by The
Washington Post.
   Aides to Mayor Marion Barry and an advisory commission made up
of business and civic leaders projected a $200 million deficit. But
Raines said it would be between $275 million and $300 million by
Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year.
   The difference will come from ``additional unbudgeted spending
and a further deterioration of tax revenues due to the recession,''
wrote Raines, a partner in the investment finance firm Lazard
Freres.
   Raines, who has also advised the cities of Chicago and
Cleveland, wrote: ``In my 11 years of working with governments in
financial difficulty, I do not believe I have ever encountered a
situation as potentially disastrous as this one.''
   ``The nation's capital is at serious risk. Its problems are as
big as those that faced New York City in the 1970s but despite the
lessons of New York and other big cities which experienced
financial crisis all the major actors in Washington have avoided
their responsibility for many years.''
   Dixon said Saturday that she was familiar with a tendency
politicians have to feign surprise at problems they face after
taking office in an effort to buy more time to effect change.
   ``I know that approach,'' she said. ``I thought about using it
myself. I don't have to use any props. Good ol' Marion, he left me
with something that's for real.''

<HEAD>Council Backs Old Plan to Change Member Makeup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The City Council, under orders to change how
members are elected in order to better represent minorities, has
decided to back a plan that would expand the council and draw new
districts.
   The 11-member council agreed Wednesday to request a November
1991 election under a plan that voters approved in August 1989. The
plan was forced by a settlement in a 1988 federal lawsuit that said
the election system made it difficult for minorities to be elected.
   The move comes after voters earlier this month defeated a
government overhaul that called for the election of 14 council
members by districts and the mayor by the city as a whole.
   Under the current system, instituted in 1975, eight members are
elected from districts and three others, including the mayor, are
elected from the city at large.
   Supporters said the plan would have helped ease racial
inequities that make it difficult for minorities to get elected.
   Opponents said the system would have resegregated Dallas. They
backed a plan calling for 10 candidates to be elected by district,
four by larger districts, or regions, and the mayor by the city as
a whole.
   On Wednesday, a majority of council members agreed to request
the November 1991 election following the opponents' plan, with
districts to be drawn later, using new census figures.
   Using 1980 census figures, the council was unable to draw City
Council district lines that a majority of the members would
support.
   Consequently, the council decided against submitting a specific
plan to the U.S. Justice Department or to U.S. District Judge Jerry
Buchmeyer of Dallas, in whose court a voting rights lawsuit against
Dallas was filed in 1988.
   The action increases the likelihood that a federal judge will
decide on his own a new system of government upon Dallas.
   The referendum earlier this month was part of the settlement of
the 1988 lawsuit brought by Roy Williams and Marvin Crenshaw,
blacks who failed in their at-large council bids. They charged that
the election system made it difficult for minorities to win office.
   Black and Hispanic leaders nationwide have long charged that
at-large elections dilute minority voting strength.

   Two college students were thrown into
the brig and could face desertion charges after failing to show up
when their Marine Corps Reserve unit left for a Persian Gulf
deployment, officials said.
   James E. Summers Jr., 20, and Demetrio R. Perez, 21, longtime
best friends and roommates in Gainesville, surrendered at the Armed
Forces Reserve Center on Wednesday and asked for
conscientious-objector status.
   ``We're confident we are doing the right thing,'' Perez said.
   ``I am following my conscience,'' Summers said, ``and that comes
first.''
   Maring Maj. Reggie White in Jacksonville said they were
processed in Jacksonville and then taken to Camp LeJeune, N.C., for
possible court-martial ``for their 29-day deserter status.''
   Maj. Bill Grein, a Marine spokesman in New Orleans, said the two
will probably be held in the brig until they can speak with their
commanding officer.
   Their lawyer, Ellis Rubin of Miami, said there was a federal
warrant for their arrest so he advised them to turn themselves in.
   The military could either discharge the pair, hold a hearing on
their conscientious-objector status or order them court-martialed
on the desertion charges. Rubin said the charges also could be
reduced to ``unauthorized absence.''
   Marines can face up to one year in the brig for unauthorized
absence and one year for missing the unit, which left town Nov. 27.
   The Army had 77 conscientious objector applications through
November this year, said Pentagon spokesman Maj. Doug Hart. Last
year, there were 74 applications and 22 soldiers were discharged.
   ``Basic warrior training exposed me to darkness, death, killing
and war,'' says Perez in his application for conscientious-objector
status. ``This is when I realized that my conscience would not
allow me to participate in any war.''

   Jordan has increased its security forces
along the cease-fire line with Israel as a precaution against any
surprise attack by the Jewish state, military sources said today.
   ``We can't afford to be taken by surprise by the Israelis, and
the beef-up is a precautionary measure in response to a massive
military deployment by the Israelis on the other side of the
demarcation line,'' one source said, referring to the border set up
after the 1967 Middle East War.
   Information Minister Ibrahim Izzeddine declined comment on the
reported buildup.
   Israel's 141,000-strong armed forces have been on alert since
Kuwait was invaded Aug. 2 by Iraq. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
has repeatedly threatened to attack Israel if the U.S.-led
multinational force launches a military strike on Baghdad. Israel
has warned Saddam it would retaliate if he carries through with his
threat.
   The Jordanian military source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said: ``We have no intention of launching any military
strike against anyone, but we have to be on alert to protect our
national security.''
   He declined to give any figures of military strength along the
western border. Jordan has a 100,000-man army, including
conscripts, and 40,000-strong militia known as the Popular Army.
   A visitor to the Jordan Valley, 15 miles west of Amman, reported
seeing a heavy buildup of tanks, artillery and soldiers in recent
days.
   U.S. officials said on Wednesday they believe Saddam will attack
Israel if he believes that a gulf conflict is inevitable. By
hitting the Jewish state, the Arabs' main enemy, the Iraqi leader
would hope to split the Arab states aligned with the United States
from the coalition.
   Senior Israeli legislator Eliahu Ben-Elissar declared on
Wednesday that Jordan was included in the Israeli warnings to
retaliate because it is ``in such close alliance with Iraq'' and
because of its location.
   Ben-Elissar said Saddam's missiles and combat jets ``cannot do
much against Israel without Jordan.''

   A box containing 143 pounds of uncut
cocaine washed ashore just two blocks from the State Police
Training Academy.
   The cocaine is worth at least $1.8 million and would be worth
even more after being cut or diluted with other substances for
street sale, said First Assistant Monmouth County Prosecutor Alton
Kenney.
   A federal drug agent said it's not uncommon for illegal drug
shipments to wash ashore like the cocaine found last week.
   ``One of the things (smugglers are) starting to do is tow the
stuff. They'll hook a tow line on it, fix it so it goes under the
water,'' said Donald Ashton, agent-in-charge of the Newark office

   ``Occasionally, the tow lines will break, or if a Coast Guard
cutter was approaching, they'd cut the line.''
   He said smugglers also drop shipments from planes or freighters

<HEAD>Supreme Court OKs Repatriation of Marcos Money</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a ruling published today, the
Supreme Court conditionally approved returning to the Philippines
$350 million sent to Switzerland by late President Ferdinand E.
Marcos.
   The court said the money, frozen in several Swiss banks since
March 1986, must be returned as soon as a criminal court in the
Philippines issued a ``legally binding'' verdict in the case. That
verdict, it said, should indicate whether the funds would be
confiscated or returned to claimants.
   It gave the Philippines a year to open the criminal proceedings.
If no verdict were returned within the deadline, Swiss banks would
end their seizure of the assets ``upon request of those affected,''
the court said.
   It said the Philippine trial must conform to the standards set
in the Swiss federal constitution and the European Human Rights
Convention, covering chiefly the independence of the judiciary and
the impartiality of judges.
   Before returning the funds, Swiss authorities must determine
that all conditions have been met, the court said.
   Bank records seized in Zurich and Bern, however, can be turned
over to Philippine authorities under the ruling, dated Dec. 21.
   Marcos, his family and aides have been accused by the Philiipine
government led by President Corazon Aquino of looting the treasury.
Marcos was forced out of office in a 1986 ``people power''
revolution.
   Zurich District Attorney Dieter Jann said the court's warning
about failure to meet the Dec. 21, 1991 deadline did not mean the
assets would automatically revert to the Marcos family. He said the
family would probably have to prove its claim to the money in
protracted civil law proceedings.
   Jann said the deadline was ``relatively short.'' He said it
seemed to make plain the Swiss desire that the Philippines ``take
concrete action at last'' in preparing a criminal trial in the
case.
   The ruling rejected 11 appeals against lower court decisions to
release funds totaling $350 million that are now blocked at Credit
Suisse in Zurich and at Swiss Bank Corporation in Fribourg.
   The appeals were filed by lawyers on behalf of Marcos' widow,
Imelda, and other family members, as well as of three foundations
based in the principality of Liechtenstein.
   The decision ended more than four years of litigation in Swiss
courts.
   Following Marcos' flight to the United States, all Swiss assets
linked to Marcos and his family were provisionally frozen March 24,
1986 under an unprecedented government decree.
   The freeze was extended indefinitely after the Philippine
government requested Swiss judicial assistance in efforts to
recover the money, originally estimated to total about $1 billion.
   Marcos' lawyers frequently cited the absence of formal criminal
charges as a reason why the request for judicial assistance should
be turned down. But in a July 1, 1987 ruling, the Supreme Court
authorized such assistance.

   Russia's finance minister has resigned, saying the
largest and richest Soviet republic has made no progress in the
transition to a market economy, the Russian legislature's newspaper
reported today.
   Boris Fyodorov, 33, was quoted as telling Rossiiskaya Gazeta
that lawmakers in the Russian republic have been unwilling to take
responsibility for necessary but unpopular measures, such as
lifting artificial price controls.
   ``Regrettably, there is nothing like progress toward the
market,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Fyodorov told the newspaper important decisions, such as forming
private companies, setting up a stock market and bringing Russian
accounting practices in line with international norms, ``get bogged
down in the depths of the apparatus ... for months on end.''
   ``Cabinet ministers seem to believe in all seriousness that they
can run the economy as they would run a factory,'' he was quoted as
saying. ``Populist measures involving ever new outlays are taken
one after another, while the revenue base is being curtailed.''
   ``This is a shortcut to financial bankruptcy for the republic
and for the (Soviet) Union as a whole,'' he reportedly said.
   On Nov. 1, the Russian Federation began a program to switch from
a centrally planned, command economy to a free market within 500
days. Russian lawmakers said they wanted to move faster than the
national government, but their policies often conflict and create
confusion rather than reform.

   Trading on the New York and American stock
exchanges was delayed 90 minutes today after a fire broke out in
the Wall Street-area building that houses their computer
operations.
   The exchanges opened at 11 a.m. because of the fire, which
followed a transformer explosion.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission asked all other exchanges
to refrain from trading until the information system was up and
operational, spokeswoman Mary McCue said.
   ``It's only fair that market participants have access to the
same information,'' she said.
   The over-the-counter market began trading at 9:30 a.m.
   Regional exchanges, which include the Midwest, Pacific,
Cincinnati, Boston and Philadelphia exchanges, trade some of same
stocks as the New York and American exchanges, but handle only a
small percentage of the total volume of stock traded on the major
exchanges.
   The blaze erupted at the building that houses the Securities
Industry Automation Corp., which controls the computer system for
stock trading, said New York Stock Exchange spokeswoman Sharon
Gamsin. The stock exchanges are located several blocks away.
   The company, a joint venture between the two major stock
exchanges, was evacuated about 2:30 a.m., about two hours after the
explosion, she said.
   Officials said earlier that the fire may have caused hazardous
PCBs to spew onto seven floors of the building.
   The Environmental Protection Agency gave Securities Industry
Automation permission to re-enter the building at midmorning.
   Over-the-counter stock trading is conducted independently of the
New York and American exchanges. The National Association of
Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System, or NASDAQ, reports
quotes for over-the-counter stocks.
   Trading is usually light in the week between Christmas and New
Year's.
   Twenty-six firefighters and 14 others were treated for possible
exposure to carcinogenic polychlorinated biphenyls as a result of
the fire, said Lt. Jim Powell, a New York City Fire Department
spokesman.
   Of the 26 firefighters treated for possible PCB contamination,
four were hospitalized, Powell said.
   It was not immediately known if any Securities Industry
Automation employees were among the injured.
   The transformer exploded just after 12:30 a.m., Powell said. The
fire was under control at 3:16 a.m.
   Trading disruptions are relatively rate. More than a year ago,
trading on the New York Stock Exchange was halted when a
fire-related power problem at Securities Industry Automation
briefly delayed the opening one day.
   Last month, a power failure disrupted trading for 90 minutes.
The exchange shut down after trading began Nov. 23 and resumed
later that morning.
   In mid-August a fire at a Con Edison power substation forced the
American Stock Exchange, New York Mercantile Exchange and other
futures markets in lower Manhattan to close by early afternoon. The
New York Stock Exchange was unaffected by the outage but trading
volume slowed.

   When hunters legally killed 569 potentially
diseased bison outside Yellowstone National Park two winters ago,
citics complained that they wounded Montana's proud reputation as
a refuge for wildlife.
   Now officials are thinking of modifying the hunt to make it
clear that the purpose is to keep Montana cattle herds
disease-free. But conservation and animal-rights groups still
aren't satisfied.
   Montana's Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks is considering
a change in rules that now call for state game wardens and national
park rangers to join private hunters in killing adult bison that
cross from Yellowstone into Montana in search of winter forage.
   The department plans to make its decision on Friday after
today's hearing.
   ``I think the plan we have now is a good plan and will work,''
Gov. Stan Stephens said in a recent interview.
   But the New York-based Fund for Animals has sued to stop all
bison killing. The Greater Yellowstone Coalition, an environmental
group, says the state should consider non-lethal alternatives.
   The Montana Board of Livestock, frustrated with the long debate,
has asked the U.S. Department of Agriculture to quarantine
Yellowstone.
   About half of the 2,500 to 3,000 bison in the 2-million-acre
park are believed to carry brucellosis, a disease that causes
cattle to abort. Montana spent millions of dollars over a decade to
eradicate brucellosis in its cattle.
   ``Why should we have one vestige of infection left?'' asked
James Glossen of USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.
``From an agricultural perspective, we don't want that reservoir of
infection in Yellowstone.''
   Under the current plan, negotiated with the National Park
Service, private hunters are called to kill bull bison, and game
wardens and park rangers may be called in to kill cows that wander
out of the park, sometimes onto private land. Calves would be
captured, neutered and sold.
   Bison that remain inside Yellowstone may not be harmed.
   Officials say the plan seeks to spread the responsibility for
the killings and mitigate some of the outrage that followed the
killing of 569 bison by private hunters during the winter of
1988-89. Eleven have been killed so far this season.
   Officials also say cows are more likely to carry brucellosis
than bulls, and putting the responsibility for their killing in the
hands of wardens and rangers should reduce the chances of their
spreading disease.
   But the Montana Wildlife Federation, a conservation group whose
ranks include hunters, says the bison killing ``is damaging the
Montana record as a progressive wildlife conservation state.''
   ``The eyes of all America are watching,'' Wayne Pacelle, Fund
for Animals' executive director, said last week. ``The Park Service
clearly is not going to benefit by having the public see its
rangers shoot its very symbol.''
   K.L. Cool, the state's Fish, Wildlife and Parks director, has
agreed there is no sport involved in shooting the slow-moving
animals, likening it to ``shooting cattle in a feed yard.''
   He said he would be willing to consider a better alternative but
that in the end the spread of brucellosis must be controlled.
   Ranchers in the area are watching the debate especially closely.
   ``Bison in Yellowstone Park are of great value to all of us,''
said James Stermitz, a rancher near the park's northern gate.
``Bison outside of Yellowstone Park can only offer problems that
would not get better.''

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today condemned the
parliament of the Russian Federation, the largest of the 15 Soviet
republics, for passing a 1991 budget that he said was dramatically
at odds with national plans.
   Gorbachev, speaking to the national parliament, said Russian
lawmakers agreed to provide only 23.4 billion rubles toward the
national budget for next year, 119 billion rubles less than the
republic's contribution this year.
   If other republics follow Russia's lead and cut their
contributions to the 250 billion ruble national budget, he said,
the result would be ``a collapse, not only of the economy, but of
the union.''
   ``What are we supposed to do, disband our military entirely and
stop all fundamental scientific research? That's not serious,''
Gorbachev said.
   The Soviet president urged the Russian parliament to suspend its
decision.
   He also asked the Congress of People's Deputies national
legislature to pass a resolution calling for actions to resolve the
budget dispute, including creation of a national economic
stabilization fund.
   The Congress was expected to vote on the resolution later today
or early Friday. Its session was originally scheduled to end today
but was extended by one day because of the vice presidential
voting, which Gorbachev's nominee, Gennady I. Yanayev, won on the
second ballto.
   The Soviet Union is passing through turbulent times of bare
grocery store shelves, ethnic violence and nationwide political
paralysis. The national government has been at odds with Russia
over how to proceed with the economy.
   The Russian legislature's newspaper reported today that the
republic's finance minister has resigned, saying the federation had
made no progress in the transition to a market economy.
   Boris Fyodorov, 33, was quoted as telling Rossiiskaya Gazeta

   Fire raced through a garment factory in
a Dhaka suburb today, killing at least 30 people, police and
hospital sources said. Hundreds fled from the flames, causing a
stampede.
   About 100 other people suffered burns.
   Police said most of the bodies were found on the third floor,
which houses a cutting room where cloth is piled before being made
into garments.
   Survivors said the room usually was kept locked so workers
couldn't smuggle anything out of the factory.
   Twenty-four charred bodies were pulled from the rubble, and
doctors said five people succumbed to injuries in hospitals.
   Another victim, a 9-year-old girl, died in the stampede as the
500 employees fled the flames, the police said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Parveen Akhtar, a worker whose hands were badly burned, said the
worst devastation was in the cutting room.
   ``There were at least 100 people in the cutting room with heaps
of clothes. The room usually remains locked,'' she said.
   It was not immediately known whether the third-floor cutting
room door was locked when the fire started, but other workers said
factory's the main entrance on the ground level was locked.
   ``Initially they (the guards) prevented many from escaping. The
guards thought the fleeing people may run with shirts that the
factory produce,'' said Amena Begum, a sewing machine operator.
   ``It was like a hell. There was screaming all around,'' said
Mohammad Ali, a 25-year-old factory worker.
   Police said they suspected the fire was started by a short
circuit in the five-story building occupied by the privately owned
Sareka Garments Co. They said the company's managing director was
among the dead. Firemen fought the blaze for about three hours
before bringing it under control.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Rules Indiana's Out-of-State Trash Law
Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG RICHARDSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge today ruled Indiana's new
law regulating out-of-state trash are unconstitutional, saying the
flow of rubbish into the state is all part of commerce.
   U.S. District Judge John D. Tinder concluded that the law's
three key provisions violate the Constitution's commerce clause
that allows free trade among the states.
   ``However noble and popular these three provisions of House
Enrolled Act 1240 appear to be, they must give way to the
constitutional principles,'' Tinder wrote.
   ``The same protection that the commerce clause gives to the
citizens of other states who feel the need to import waste into
Indiana protects Indiana citizens when they export hazardous waste
to other states.
   ``Commerce, even in such `bads' as waste, is a two-way street.''
   Tinder's ruling comes five months after the conclusion of a
trial on a lawsuit filed by two Pennsylvania trash haulers who
challenged the law shortly after it was signed last spring by Gov.
Evan Bayh.
   Bayh, vacationing in South Carolina, was preparing a statement
in reaction to the ruling, his office said.
   Attorney General Linley E. Pearson, whose office handled the
legal defense of the new law, said he knew it would be difficult
for the state to overcome the commerce clause argument. About a
half-dozen other states have had similar trash laws struck down on
the same ground, he said.
   ``I've always maintained it would be an uphill battle,'' said
Pearson.
   The provisions struck down today required a trash hauler to
certify where the largest part of the waste in a shipment was
generated, and required a hauler to receive a health officer's
certification that the shipment contained no hazardous or
infectious waste. The third provision imposed a dumping fee equal
to the fee charged at the landfill closest to the point of origin
of the trash shipment.
   The law was passed with bipartisan support after Bayh and
legislators expressed alarm that Indiana had become a dumping
ground for trash from Eastern states.
   Tinder said his ruling doesn't prevent Indiana from regulating
out-of-state trash, but the law requires that refuse should be
treated the same as in-state waste, not in a tougher fashion.
   Those efforts could include ``imposing and enforcing stringent
regulations on infectious or hazardous waste,'' Tinder wrote.
   The judge also noted that his ruling doesn't disturb other
provisions of the law that require solid-waste management plans
within Indiana, impose a tipping fee on all waste deposited within
the state, and require haulers of waste within Indiana to certify
the county of origin of the trash shipment.

   Mohammed Abdo, a Saudi Arabian
singer famous in the Arab world, has ``repented'' and given up
singing, the Arriyadiyah newspaper reported Thursday.
   Some fundamentalist Moslems consider singing to be ``haram,'' or
sinful.
   The newspaper, which usually concentrates on sports news, said
Abdo wept when he declared his repentance at prayers in a mosque
Wednesday night and vowed ``he would never sing again for the rest
of his life.''
   It said he recited some verses from the Koran, Islam's holy
book, asking for forgiveness and ``in melodious sound'' led the
congregation in prayer.
   The newspaper said ``the congregation shouted Allahu Akbar (God
is great) while welcoming Abdo back to the fold of Islam.''
   It added that Adnan Akbar, a famous Saudi fashion designer who
also gave up his profession ``out of fear of Allah,'' was in the
mosque when Abdo announced his decision to give up show business.
   Abdo, of Yemeni origin, began his career in the mid-sixties in
Lebanon. He usually spent summers performing in Cairo or London.

<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of Algerians marched
through the streets today protesting a new law forbidding foreign
languages. They said the measure is a product of the government's
political and religious intolerance.
   The law passed Wednesday night makes Arabic the national
language and exacts stiff fines for using anything else in official
transactions. French is now used commonly in the workplace in this
former French colony, and Berber is spoken by nearly a third of
Algeria's 27 million people.
   A leftist opposition leader, Hocine Ait-Ahmed, a Berber, called
the law a ``veritable coup against democracy.''
   ``Under the pretext of defending the Arab language, (they) are
fingering democracy,'' he told French radio earlier today.
   The protesters, estimated in the tens of thousands, marched past
the presidential palace. They erected a tent to show their anger at
the government's refusal to allow Ait Ahmed's Front of Socialist
Forces party to set up a headquarters in Algiers.
   The law, which passed the National Assembly 173-8 with 13
abstentions, must be signed by President Chadli Bendjedid before it
can take effect. He has not said whether he will do so, but members
of his party support the law.
   According to the law, the use of Arabic in all official and work
transactions as well as in schools is to be ``total'' by 1997.
   TV programming must also be in Arabic, but existing French
newspapers are not affected.
   Ait-Ahmed accused the government of ``complicity'' with Islamic
forces that he blamed for pressuring the government into the new
law.
   The Moslem fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front has emerged as
the main opposition party.
   Bendjedid moved toward pluralism following riots in October
1988.
   The Islamic Front, winner in municipal and local elections this
summer, has tried to enforce the Islamic dress code in several
towns where it has the majority.
   Under the new law, all documents prepared by the government or
private businesses in a language other than Arabic will be
``nullified'' and fines from $100 to $500 levied.
   Political parties will be fined from $1,000 to $10,000 for not
complying with the law.

   Three people suffered gunshot wounds Thursday
when an Uzi submachine gun carried by a security guard accidentally

   The man with the gun was one of two security guards for a group

a 54-year-old woman passerby were shot in the legs and slightly
wounded.
   The Ben Yehuda mall is one of Jerusalem's main shopping areas

Some tour groups in the city have armed guards because of tension
between Jews and Arabs.
   Police said the guard was questioned and released without

   Franco Piga, the state industry minister who
recently mediated a battle for control of Italy's chemical
industry, has died of a heart attack, his family said Thursday.
   The 63-year-old Cabinet minister died while an ambulance was
taking him to a hospital late Wednesday night in the Dolomite
resort of Cortina D'Ampezzo, where he was spending Christmas
holidays, the family said.
   A Christian Democrat, Piga received the post in Premier Giulio
Andreotti's government in July, after five ministers quit in a
political dispute.
   He served as head of the Italian stock market regulatory agency,
Consob, from 1984 to 1988.
   As industry minister, Piga played a key role in working out an
agreement between the state energy group ENI and the private
chemical industry giant Montedison, allowing ENI to buy a
controlling stake in their long-disputed joint-venture Enimont.
   The premier's office announced that Andreotti will temporarily
hold the ministry post until a replacement is named.

<HEAD>President's Resignation Expected, Military Denies Coup Attempt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army today said it had been
constitutionally empowered to force the civilian government from
power on Christmas Eve. It denied the characterization of the
ouster as a military coup.
   Cmdr. Ivan Graanoogst, acting army chief, said the National
Assembly would receive resignations today from President Ramsewak
Shankar and Vice President Henck Arron and would elect new chief
executives by Saturday.
   The military forced the civilian government from the National
Palace on Monday, following a dispute between Shankar and military
Cmdr. Desi Bouterse, a former dictator of the South American
nation.
   ``There is no coup at all,'' Graanoogst said on television.
``The United States, the Netherlands, France and others who have
protested are premature.''
   Graanoogst referred to two articles in the constitution that
charge the army with the responsibility to ensure ``a peaceful
transition to a democratic and socially just society.''
   He said the military had been assured by jurists that it had
acted constitutionally.
   Graanoogst, No. 2 in the five-member military command headed by
Bouterse, said
   Many nations have condemned the military action and demanded
that the legitimately elected government be reinstated.
   The assembly convened today for the first time since Graanoogst
announced Monday night that the president had been deposed.
   Resignations of the civilian leaders were expected. One
journalist, speaking on condition of anonymity, said said if they
resign, ``they'll be doing it at gunpoint.''
   The constitution requires the assembly to appoint new chief
executives if the president and vice president resign.
   Bouterse seized power in 1980 from Arron, who was president, and
headed a military dictatorship for seven years being allowing
democratic elections in 1987. He continued to wield considerable
power as army chief, a post he angrily resigned Monday in a dispute
with Shankar.
   Shankar and Arron were elected by the National Assembly in 1988
after Shankar's three-party coalition, the Front for Democracy and
Development, won a landslide victory in the 1987 elections.
   Suriname is an ethnically diverse country of 400,000, bordered
on South America's northeastern Atlantic coast by Guyana and French
Guiana, and to the south by Brazil.

   Two bombs went off at a bank today after
a man put a package on the counter and started counting backward.
   The blasts - one inside the bank and the other outside the bank

   A bank employee told a radio station a man walked into a First

   After the man began to count down loudly from 10, the employee
said, he fled.
   About 10 people were in the bank at the time, officials said.
   They realized what was happening and fell to the floor before
the blast, said the employee, who asked not to be identified.
   The blast shattered a window and damaged the teller counter.
Debris was strewn across the floor.
   A second bomb went off outside, said FBI Agent Tom Lusby.
   Details were sketchy, but Police Assistant Chief D.R. Stone said
they were investigating whether the explosions were part of a bank
robbery.
   ``I heard a very large explosion,'' said Beth Allen, manager of
Camera World, next door to the bank. ``It sounded like the heater
in our building had exploded, it was so loud.''
   ``When I came out of the store, I saw all the bank employees
running out of the bank and into our store,'' Ms. Allen said.
``They weren't screaming, but they were in a hurry to get here.''
   Bank spokeswoman Sandy Deem said officials were on the scene and
that she could not comment.
   Police said they believed the suspect escaped in a white
four-wheel drive vehicle.

   Television director and producer Richard
Irving, whose credits included ``Columbo'' and the ``Six Million
Dollar Man,'' has died at the age of 73.
   Irving died Sunday after heart surgery at an undisclosed San
Diego hospital, and was buried Wednesday following a funeral at
Hillside Memorial Park in Los Angeles, according to the mortuary.
   Irving, a onetime Broadway and film actor, was a dialogue
director at the RKO film studio before entering television. Later
he helped establish Revue Productions, the MCA Universal television
production subsidiary.
   He oversaw the production of 36 TV films during one six-month
period in 1971. In 1949 and 1950, he produced 22 episodes of the
90-minute ``Mystery Theatre'' features.
   Irving produced the Gruen and Chevron Theater anthologies,
``Pepsi-Cola Playhouse,'' ``Name of the Game,'' ``Columbo,'' and
``Wagon Train.''
   He also directed the pilot film for ABC-TV's ``Six Million
Dollar Man'' and the NBC-TV miniseries ``Seventh Avenue.''
   He was executive vice president of Universal TV until 1979.
Shortly after his departure, he directed the mini-series ``The
Jesse Owens Story.''
   Most recently, Irving directed the ABC series ``The Insiders''
and NBC's ``Hell Town,'' and produced the TV movie ``The Last Days
of Pompeii.''
   Irving is survived by his wife, Joanne; a daughter, a son, three
stepchildren and seven grandchildren.

<HEAD>Oscar-Winning Art Director Dead At 67</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Academy Award-winning art director and
set designer Gene Callahan, who worked on more than 50 movies and
1,000 television programs, has died at age 67.
   He died at his Baton Rouge home Wednesday. No cause of death was
given.
   Callahan won Oscars for his set designing work in ``The
Hustler'' starring Paul Newman and Jackie Gleason and for art
direction in ``America, America.'' He received a third Academy
Award nomination for ``The Cardinal.''
   In a 1969 interview, Callahan, a Baton Rouge native, described
his work:
   ``As a production designer, I am responsible for the `look' of
the show - from locations, or exterior scenes, and how they are to
be shot, to the design sets themselves, their constructions, their
painting, and then the set decoration. Sometimes I design the
titles, too.''
   From building a village in Greece to painting a mountainside a
different shade to building shores in Turkey, his work ran the
gamut.
   Callahan, who started working in theater by designing opera sets
in the 1940s at Louisiana State University, recently worked as
production designer for the movie ``Steel Magnolias,'' shot in
Natchitoches, La.
   As set decorator, his many film credits included ``Butterfield
8,'' ``Splendor in the Grass,'' and ``Long Day's Journey into
Night.''
   As art director, he earned film credits for ``Funny Girl,''
``The Stepford Wives,'' ``Julia,'' ``The Eyes of Laura Mars,''
``Seems Like Old Times,'' ``Whose Life Is It Anyway?'' ``Grease
II,'' ``Places in the Heart,'' and ``Children of a Lesser God.''

   Lance Cpl. John Scott is a Marine
grunt, training for the dangerous job of breaching Iraqi defenses.
   He is also Kashim Ishmael Elijah Scott, a follower of Islam who
feels he has a special purpose defending the birthplace of the
religion despite differences with his hosts and the U.S. military
over his faith.
   ``I feel like I have more of a purpose than the average Marine.
Most people here are wondering why, they are trying to grasp a
reason. I feel I am defending Mecca and Medina, which is sacred
ground,'' Scott said.
   The 20-year-old from Los Angeles is a member of the Alpha
Company in the 1st Battalion, Third Marine Regiment, which was
deployed in September.
   When he got to Saudi Arabia he reaffirmed his Islamic faith in a
Saudi mosque, ``just to feel that I did it in the homeland.''
   Lance Cpl. D. Carlos Timmons, 21, of Atlanta, Georgia, decided
to convert to Islam while in Saudi Arabia.
   ``Not many brothers can say `I made shahada in Saudi Arabia,'''
he said. Making shahada, which means witness in Arabic, is one of
the five main tenets of the faith.
   An adherent must say ``I witness that there is no God, but God,
and Mohammed is his prophet,'' in the presence of a learned prayer
leader.
   He also must accept the other four principles: praying five
times a day, fasting during the holy month of Ramadan, donating
money for the poor annually and making a pilgrimage to the holy
cities of Mecca and Medina - where Mohammed founded the faith - at
least once in his lifetime.
   Members of the predominately black Islamic sect in the United
States are sometimes called Black Muslims.
   In the United States, charismatic Black Muslim leaders like the
late Malcolm X used Islam to stress black nationalism. Some have
called for creating a separate, black nation in the United States
that would be loosely based on Islam.
   ``The Saudis stress we have to come back to the principles, that
U.S. Muslims have strayed from the faith, its books, the oneness of
God,'' Scott said.
   ``They said we were getting too much into the social aspect of
things and not praising God enough. That was the only derogatory
thing we heard from them,'' he added.
   For their part, the Saudis have been trying to counteract the
negative image Islam has in the United States due to a decade of
confrontation with some of its more extremist elements, especially
Shiite Moslem kidnappers in Lebanon and others fueled by the
revolutionary zeal of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   ``Islam was introduced in the picture of Khomeini, of terrorists
and so forth. This is not Islamic,'' said Mohammed Al-Okat, a Saudi
who organizes lectures for the troops on Saudi culture.
   Here, the holy book the Koran is considered the constitution.
   Followers of Islam recognize Jesus as a prophet, but reject that
he is the son of God and don't accept Christmas as a holiday.
   ``Such honoring is only for God, not for any human being,'' said
Dr. Mohammed Al-Dabbal, director for literary criticism at Imam
Mohammed Ibn Saud Islamic University of Riyadh, in an interview.
   Scott and Timmons said they do not celebrate Christmas. Other
tenets of the faith they do not follow strictly, but they pointed
out that Mohammed himself allowed soldiers fighting a war some
leeway. They only pray three times a day, for example.
   ``We do too much'' to pray five times, said Timmons.
   They want recognition from the U.S. military in the form of
enlisted prayer leaders and time out for prayers on Friday.
   There is no firm statistic on how many of the 300,000 U.S.
troops here have converted, but Christian chaplains said they have
heard of dozens. It is not clear how many were Black Muslims.
   The office of the senior Defense Department chaplain in
Washington said there are about 2,700 followers of Islam in all
U.S. military services, but no prayer leaders.
   It stressed in a statement that the U.S. military respects the
right of all Armed Forces members to practice any religion, as
guaranteed in the Constitution.

<HEAD>Military Buildup Costs Small Towns Heavily When Doctors Leave</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PALISADE, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The callup of reservists for the Persian
Gulf buildup is striking medical care hard in rural America,
leaving some small towns without doctors and forcing retired
physicians back to work.
   Dr. Victor Hoefner Jr., 70, was enjoying his retirement last
month when his son, Dr. Victor C. Hoefner III, an Army National
Guardsman, was called up for duty the Persian Gulf.
   Now the elder Hoefner has taken over his son's family practice
in this western Colorado community.
   The Pentagon won't say how many doctors have been called up,
citing security. In addition to the activation of members of the
Army, Navy and Air Force reserves, the Army has begun forcing some
retired medical officers back into uniform.
   The effect of the callup is quickly felt in small towns, and the
indefinite duration of the crisis is adding to the problem,
according to rural health experts.
   ``Are we talking three months, six months or a year?'' asked
Toby Turner, spokeswoman for the National Rural Health Association
in Kansas City.
   ``Rural health has been in crisis anyway, and losing 50 percent
of your small hospital's staff at one time is just too much of a
blow. The military is just filling slots in these units without
paying any attention to a medical reservist's role at home.''
   ``The pattern we're seeing is that when people are called from a
small community, it's felt much more because the likelihood of a
critical position being affected is greater and the likelihood of
having adequate backup is less than a large hospital,'' said Al
Chechik, spokesman for the Wisconsin Hospital Association.
   The call-up of physicians, nurses and technicians has the
potential to strip the U.S. Public Health Service staffs on Indian
reservations, although not too many have been called as yet,
officials said.
   The Public Health Service hospital in Crownpoint, N.M., serving
Navajos and other tribes in the area, lost its only ear, nose and
throat specialist.
   ``The Public Health Service is part of the armed services, and
we sign a statement that we can be pulled for non-combatant duty,''
said Dr. Annie Kusava, a pediatrician in Crownpoint, who carries
the rank of lieutenant colonel.
   In Verdigre, Neb., the lone physician was called up, leaving the
northeast Nebraska community of 617 without a doctor.
   Dr. Ken Pavlik, an Army Reservist, leaves a medical clinic and
patients in the Knox County hospital and nursing home.
   He arranged for Dr. D.J. Nagengast, who lives 25 miles away in
Bloomfield, to make rounds and check on his patients.
   ``There is no question that this is going to be an inconvenience
to a lot of people,'' Pavlik said.
   While the number of physicians pulled out of rural areas
apparently isn't great, their departure leaves a far larger gap
than would that of their big-city counterpart.
   ``It hurts the rural hospitals where there have been shortages
anyway,'' said Pete Moberg, spokesman for St. Mary's Hospital in
Grand Junction.
   St. Mary's is a regional hospital, with accident victims or
emergency surgery patients transferred from lesser-equipped rural
hospitals.
   ``If a little hospital loses its doctor and a scrub nurse,
there's going to be no surgery done there at all,'' Moberg said.
   St. Mary's is receiving more patient referrals from doctors and
other hospitals in the Western Slope region because of the call-up,
Moberg said.
   Dr. Jose Luis Rodriguez, the only plastic surgeon in Glenwood
Springs, 90 miles east of Grand Junction, closed his office and
referred patients to doctors in Grand Junction after he was
activated. He is a lieutenant colonel in the National Guard.
   In Wyoming, even more sparsely populated than Colorado, there
are only about 600 doctors in the entire state and seven are
already gone or on standby.
   ``In a state like Wyoming, the impact of losing physicians is
great,'' said Rich Johnson, executive director of the Wyoming
Medical Society. ``There are not a lot of choices in medical care
in many communities.''

   An uncle of Steven Stayner, the youth who
survived a seven-year kidnapping ordeal and later died in a
motorcycle accident, has been slain in his home, authorities said.
   Jesse ``Jerry'' Stayner, 42, died Wednesday.
   The victim's brother, Delbert Stayner, is the father of Steven
Stayner, who was kidnapped in Merced in 1972 when he was 7. Eight
years later, Steven escaped with another kidnap victim near Ukiah,
200 miles north of Merced; he died nine years later in a motorcycle
accident. The man who abducted them, Kenneth Parnell, was convicted
and served five years of an eight-year prison term.
   Jerry Stayner was shot in the chest in his home just outside
Merced, said Merced County sheriff's Detective Rick Marshall.
   ``Maybe someone was in there (the house) when he came home for
lunch, but we have no leads,'' Marshall said. He said the victim's
pickup had been taken.

<TEXT>
   Iran is neutral in the Persian Gulf crisis,
but whatever the outcome it will have an impact on Iran's future in
the region and beyond.
   The crisis also will have a profound effect on President Hashemi
Rafsanjani's efforts to steer Iran away from the legacy of the late
revolutionary patriarch, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Iraq was Iran's foe in the 1980-88 Persian Gulf war. If Iraq
emerges from the current crisis with its military power intact,
Iran would be wooed by the countries of the region as a
counterweight to Saddam Hussein's ambitions.
   If Iraq is driven out of Kuwait and its military might destroyed
or seriously weakened, Iran would be left in a powerful position
that would make its Arab neighbors uneasy.
   A victory for America and the international force and any
continuation of a U.S. presence in the region might incense Iran's
anti-Western radicals and create the possibility of new turbulence
in the region.
   Rafsanjani, leader of the country's so-called pragmatists, has
largely pushed aside radical rivals in a political power struggle
that surfaced following Khomeini's death in June 1989.
   But the hard-liners, opposed to his drive to repair relations
with the West and Iran's Arab neighbors, are seeking to undercut
Rafsanjani by whipping up anti-American passions.
   Some even want to align Iran with Iraq in a new Islamic front
against ``the Great Satan.''
   ``The Iranians are faced with a dilemma: They don't want the
Iraqis to further tip the regional balance by coming out of this
situation in possession of parts of Kuwait,'' said Philip Robins,
an analyst with London's Royal Institute of International Studies.
   ``On the other hand, they are concerned about the buildup of
Western forces, particularly the Americans, in the region,'' he
noted in a telephone interview.
   Shireen Hunter, an analyst with Washington's Institute of
Strategic and International Studies, fears that war ``could set
back the process of moderation, consolidation and reconstruction
going on in Iran now.
   ``If war erupts, and if it extends into Iraqi territory, the
radicals are going to try to use the opportunity to undermine
Rafsanjani's moderate policies,'' she said in a telephone interview
with The Associated Press.
   ``A solution where Iraq is not destroyed but is left weakened is
in Iran's best interests,'' Hunter noted.
   Parliament Speaker Mehdi Karrubi, who has emerged as the
foremost leader of the radicals, said: ``I would not support a
confrontation with the United States hand-in-hand with Iraq.
   ``But if it was a pan-Islamic thing, together with all the other
Moslem countries, I'd support that,'' he said in an interview.
   `The radical position is that if possible, the way should be
paved for the humiliation of American forces in the Persian Gulf,''
said Morteza Firozi, a senior commentator on the influential
English-language Tehran Times daily.
   Iran's 55 million people are Persians, not Arabs. But they are
overwhelmingly Shiite Moslems and, despite the Persian Gulf war,
feel kinship with fellow Shiites who make up 55 percent of Iraq's
population.
   Hunter said that if the Shiites' holiest shrines in the Iraqi
cities of Najaf, Karbala and Kazimain, all south of Baghdad, are
damaged in any hostilities, ``popular passions in Iran would really
rise.''
   Iran has insisted Iraq withdraw from Kuwait. But Rafsanjani also
has condemned the foreign forces sent to the Persian Gulf, which
Iran considers its turf.
   The Kuwait crisis has brought considerable gains for Rafsanjani,
including as much as $4 billion in oil price increases that boost
his drive to rebuild the economy. The crisis has also led to
improved relations with the West and the other Arab states and
Iraqi acceptance of Tehran's conditions for formally ending the
1980-88 war.
   Robins noted: ``It would be highly unlikely that Iran will in
any way become involved in a military conflict on either side.''
   Deputy Foreign Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati said in an
interview: ``If there is a war, our policy is clear: We do not
intend to join any forces in the gulf or to help one side against
another. Our policy is to seek a peaceful solution to the crisis.''

<TEXT>
   Crop damage from the cold wave that gripped
most of the nation before Christmas was mostly confined to fruit
and vegetables in California, a government report said Thursday.
   The severe cold in California ``caused extensive damage to the
citrus and vegetable crops,'' the Joint Agricultural Facility said.
But Arizona and Texas crops escaped serious freeze damage, it
added.
   ``Rain and snow over the eastern third of the nation provided
moisture to growing crops and delayed late harvest of corn and
soybeans,'' the report said. ``Lack of moisture in Florida resulted
in continued use of irrigation in fruit groves.''
   The facility is operated by the Agriculture and Commerce
departments. Weekly reports show the general effects of weather on
crops but do not foretell actual losses or production estimates.
   While the low temperatures in California damaged the citrus
crop, the report said ``damaged fruit can be processed but will be
limited by processing capacity.''
   In southern Texas, growers in the Rio Grande Valley ``reported
little damage to growing crops'' from cold weather, the report
said. However, there was some minor damage to spinach and beet
crops in the San Antonio winter garden area.
   The Agriculture Department has forecast 1991 consumer food
prices will increase an average of 2 percent to 5 percent from this
year. Retail food prices gained and estimated 6 percent this year.
   Ralph L. Parlett Jr. of the department's Economic Research
Service said it was ``too early to tell'' for certain what impact
the western freeze last week will have.
   But Parlett said fruit and vegetable prices will go up ``a
little more'' next year than has been forecast.
   Overall, however, Parlett said he is sticking with the agency's
forecast of a 2 percent to 5 percent food prices increase next
year.

<HEAD>Iran Gets Advanced Soviet Anti-Aircraft Missiles, Radio Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran test-fired a Soviet-made, SA-6
anti-aircraft missile Thursday, acknowledging for the first time it
had acquired the advanced long-range weapon.
   The SA-6, known by the NATO code-name ``Gainful,'' is a
long-range missile capable of hitting targets 40 miles high. It
carries an 88-pound, high-explosive warhead at nearly three times
the speed of sound.
   The acquisition of radar-guided SA-6 missiles was believed part
of a $6 billion defense and industrial deal signed by Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani in Moscow in June 1989.
   A Tehran radio broadcast, monitored in Cyprus, said the
surface-to-air missile was fired at the Fajr missile base by the
Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. It did not say where the base
was, or how many missiles the Iranians have bought.
   The missile purchase is a big boost for Iran's badly depleted
military, which suffers a chronic shortage of advanced weapons.
   The Iranians are known to have U.S.-made, HAWK anti-aircraft
missiles, some obtained in former President Reagan's clandestine
arms-for-hostages deal in 1985-86. They also are believed to have
Soviet SA-7s, Swedish RBS-70s, British Rapier and Chinese HQ-2Js,
the Chinese version of the Soviet SA-2 system.
   Iraq, Iran's foe in the 1980-88 war, has at least 300 SA-6s
along with other surface-to-air missiles.
   In August, Iraq agreed to Iranian conditions to end the war,
enabling Baghdad to send thousands of troops from its border with
Iran to its frontier with Saudi Arabia. A U.S.-led multinational
force was deployed in Saudi Arabia and the gulf region following
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Iran has urged Baghdad to pull out of Kuwait, but it has also
condemned the presence of U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia.
   In September, the Iranians unveiled Soviet-built, MiG-29
advanced fighter jets acquired under the 1989 deal with Moscow.
   The Iranian air force, believed to have less than half its
estimated 170 U.S.-built combat aircraft serviceable, is thought to
have one squadron of 14 MiG-29s.
   The Revolutionary Guards, an elite miltiary force in Iran, have
their own naval and air wings, independent of the regular armed
forces.

   Gov.-elect Pete Wilson has named a
former executive director of the Sierra Club to be his cabinet
secretary in charge of all state water, parks, fish and game and
wildlife agencies.
   Douglas Wheeler, 48, currently the executive vice president of
the Washingotn, D.C.-based World Wildlife Fund and Conservation
Foundation was named Wednesday as secretary of the state Resources
Agency.
   The Republican governor-elect said his appointment of Wheeler
``makes good on one of my campaign promises ... to very vigorously
pursue the preservation of our physical environment.''
   Wheeler served 16 months in the Sierra Club post, resigning in
1986. Although Wheeler clashed with some Sierra Club leaders, his
appointment was taken as a strong signal from Wilson to
environmentalists, and applauded by spokesmen for those groups.
   Corey Brown, general counsel to the California Planning and
Conservation League, said Wheeler ``has a very good reputation
working closely with environmentalists and the private sector in
managing our natural resources.''
   ``It's a very positive thing that Wilson has done,'' said Sierra
Club state director Michael Paparian. ``Wheeler has worked with
with the environmental community. He is someone who builds
consensus.''

   ``On the other hand, they are concerned about the buildup of
Western forces, particularly the Americans, in the region,'' he
noted in a telephone interview.
   Shireen Hunter, an analyst with Washington's Institute of
Strategic and International Studies, fears that war ``could set
back the process of moderation, consolidation and reconstruction
going on in Iran now.
   ``If war erupts, and if it extends into Iraqi territory, the
radicals are going to try to use the opportunity to undermine
Rafsanjani's moderate policies,'' she said in a telephone interview
with The Associated Press.
   ``A solution where Iraq is not destroyed but is left weakened is
in Iran's best interests,'' Hunter noted.
   Parliament Speaker Mehdi Karrubi, who has emerged as the
foremost leader of the radicals, said: ``I would not support a
confrontation with the United States hand-in-hand with Iraq.
   ``But if it was a pan-Islamic thing, together with all the other
Moslem countries, I'd support that,'' he said in an interview.
   ``The radical position is that if possible, the way should be
paved for the humiliation of American forces in the Persian Gulf,''
said Morteza Firozi, a senior commentator on the influential
English-language Tehran Times daily.
   Iran's 55 million people are Persians, not Arabs. But they are
overwhelmingly Shiite Moslems and, despite the Persian Gulf war,
feel kinship with fellow Shiites who make up 55 percent of Iraq's
population.
   Hunter said that if the Shiites' holiest shrines in the Iraqi
cities of Najaf, Karbala and Kazimain, all south of Baghdad, are
damaged in any hostilities, ``popular passions in Iran would really
rise.''
   Iran has insisted Iraq withdraw from Kuwait. But Rafsanjani also
has condemned the foreign forces sent to the Persian Gulf, which
Iran considers its turf.
   The Kuwait crisis has brought considerable gains for Rafsanjani,
including as much as $4 billion in oil price increases that boost
his drive to rebuild the economy. The crisis has also led to
improved relations with the West and the other Arab states and
Iraqi acceptance of Tehran's conditions for formally ending the
1980-88 war.
   Robins noted: ``It would be highly unlikely that Iran will in
any way become involved in a military conflict on either side.''
   Deputy Foreign Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati said in an
interview: ``If there is a war, our policy is clear: We do not
intend to join any forces in the gulf or to help one side against
another. Our policy is to seek a peaceful solution to the crisis.''

<HEAD>Orders for `Big Ticket' Goods Plummet 10.5 Percent in November</HEAD>

   Orders to manufacturers for ``big ticket''
durable goods plummeted 10.5 percent in November, the government
said Thursday. The report likely signals more layoffs in the
factory sector, which lost 200,000 jobs last month and more than
800,000 in the last two years.
   The orders drop matched the post-1958 record falloff for one
month, set in January of this year. It reduced orders to a
seasonally-adjusted $115.9 billion, the lowest level since May
1988, the Commerce Department said.
   On Capitol Hill, the chairman of the Joint Economic Committee,
Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., predicted that nationwide unemployment
could hit 8 percent in the current downturn. The jobless rate rose
to 5.9 percent last month.
   ``We will in fact have a recession'' said Hamilton in his 1991
economic forecast. He said it could prove moderate or severe,
depending on the outcome of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``A settlement in the gulf could reduce inflation and encourage
an early recovery,'' Hamilton said. ``But if the crisis
intensifies, the downturn will be longer and deeper. If war comes,
all bets are off.''
   Orders for durable goods - items expected to last three or more
years - had risen 3.6 percent in October, but have been down in six
of 11 months so far in 1990.
   ``To me this is the last nail in the coffin for the recession,''
said economist Sung Won Sohn of Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis.
``It's such a whopping and across-the-board decline that it
indicates we are in a deep recession.''
   ``I think employment will continue to take a pretty significant
beating,'' said Sohn, who is forecasting a loss of an additional
75,000 manufacturing jobs in December.
   However, some analysts saw a glimmer of hope amid the gloom.
They said pressure from overseas competitors has forced
manufacturers to trim payrolls sooner than in previous recessions.
That could help avoid even bigger layoffs later, they said.
   ``We look for a bad (employment) number in December. But, to the
extent that manufacturers have succeeded in keeping payrolls in
line with what they feel will be the worst-case outlook for demand,
I am hopeful that the worst of the job loss may be behind rather
than ahead of us,'' said economist Stephen S. Roach of Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co.
   In November, declines in new orders were widespread, but deepest
in the transportation and defense industries.
   Transportation orders fell 27.4 percent in November. That
included a drop of 38.8 percent in aircraft and parts, more than
offsetting October's 20.4 percent increase. Boeing Co. earlier
reported new orders of $5.2 billion, down from $10.7 billion a
month earlier. Automobile and parts orders also fell.
   Excluding the volatile transportation sector, orders fell 3.5
percent to their lowest levels in two years after edging down 0.2
percent in October.
   New orders for defense equipment dropped 24.5 percent. Orders
excluding defense were down 9.6 percent.
   Non-defense capital goods - a barometer of business' investment
in expansion and modernization - fell 16.4 percent in November.
   Only orders for non-electrical machinery - which includes
computers - showed no decline. They were unchanged from October to
November.
   Electrical machinery orders fell 7.6 percent and primary metals
orders, which often decline when orders for autos decline, dropped
9.8 percent.
   ``You are seeing cascading weakness spreading from industry to
industry,'' said economist Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch.
   The backlog of unfilled orders - a good indication of how busy
factories will be in months ahead - dropped 1.1 percent to $497.5
billion. It was the largest one-month decline since November 1985.
   Shipments dropped 3.6 percent to $121.7 billion, the lowest
level since last January.

   Coal is still king in West Virginia,
but it's a monarchy where more and more subjects are opting for a
new realm.
   A dip in the market in the mid-1980s, as well as the automation
of the industry, were among factors in a mass exodus in the 1980s.
   According to U.S. Census Bureau figures released Wednesday, West
Virginia's population was 1,801,625 this year, a 7.6 percent
decline from the 1,949,644 counted in 1980.
   West Virginia lost a higher percentage of residents than any
state. No bordering state lost population and West Virginia was one
of only four states to lose people.
   ``I think it's a red flag in economic planning,'' said John
Hurd, president of the state Chamber of Commerce.
   ``I think when people don't stay here or come here, I think it's
pure and simple they can't make a living in West Virginia,'' Hurd
said. ``There's just not enough job opportunities for them.''
   Mark Polen, vice president of the West Virginia Coal
Association, said there are 40,000 fewer jobs in the state's coal
industry than in 1976, when the market for metallurgical coal still
was booming.
   In the mid-1980s, that market bottomed out and southern West
Virginia, where metallurgical coal is the main product, suffered.
   Despite unemployment as high as 40 percent in some counties in
the state's southern coal fields, the industry is having a bumper
year.
   It will produce 152 million tons of coal this year with a work
force of 24,500. That's the best production since 1951, when 163
million tons were mined, said Gary White, president of the state
coal association.
   In 1980, the mines employed 43,600 and each miner produced 10.97
tons. Today's more-mechanized mines produce 23.6 tons of coal per
miner, White said.
   Unemployment isn't a statewide problem.
   ``If we're still losing population it means we have a labor
surplus,'' said Ed Merrifield, director of the state's office of
labor and economic research. ``Eventually, you'll reach a point
where supply equals demand.''
   In 1979, 658,600 people were working in West Virginia. This
year, there are 625,000, Merrifield said.
   Manufacturing has declined from 117,200 in 1979 to 87,600.
Employment in the glass industry dropped from 16,500 to 7,500;
metals employment slipped from 24,800 to 14,400 and chemical work
dropped from 25,800 to 17,500.
   Gov. Gaston Caperton believes the economy has turned the corner.
   ``The decade of the '80s was a decade of despair for West
Virginia, but the '90s will be a decade of growth,'' said
gubernatorial spokesman George Manahan.
   Others, however, are concerned the state's population is
gradually aging.
   In 1979-80, 387,786 children were in West Virginia schools. That
number had fallen by 64,000 this year, Department of Education
officials said.
   ``The loss of population has been a constant bleed for three
decades now,'' said Troy Stewart, political science professor at
Marshall University.
   ``You have fewer people consuming fewer items and fewer people
left to pay the bills,'' Stewart said. ``The tax structure must be
shaped in a way to cover the services, but ensure someone is left
to pay the bills, too.''
   Caperton's administration imposed record-high taxes of $457
million in the past two years. That included reimposition of the
sales tax on food at 6 percent.

   The chairman of Congress' Joint Economic
Committee predicted Thursday that unemployment during the current
economic downturn could rise to nearly 8 percent.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., in an economic forecast for 1991,
said he based the estimate on jobless increases during recessions
since World War II.
   The rate in such periods has increased by at least two
percentage points, he said. In November, the rate went up to 5.9
percent.
   Hamilton, who issued a written report and held a news
conference, said ``we will in fact have a recession'' next year,
but it will not be typical of past downturns.
   This recession will be more unpredictable, Hamilton said,
because of record debt piled up during the expansion of the 1980s
and the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``A settlement in the Gulf could reduce inflation and encourage
an early recovery,'' Hamilton said. ``But if the crisis
intensifies, the downturn will be longer and deeper. If war comes
all bets are off.''
   Hamilton, emphasizing he spoke only for himself, said last
year's deficit reduction agreement was ``a step in the right
direction, but did not finish the job.'' He said a new agreement
will be needed beyond 1991.
   The key to long-term recovery is to increase national savings,
which would require an additional $80 billion of budget savings in
fiscal 1995, Hamilton said. .
   To ease suffering during the current downturn, Hamilton proposed
reinstating the extended benefits program for those out of work for
longer than six months.
   The program, virtually eliminated, should be renewed because
``many jobless workers could exhaust their benefits,'' Hamilton
said. The proportion of the unemployed who receive jobless benefits
has dropped from about 50 percent 10 years ago to about 33 percent
today.
   Hamilton said the best way to shorten the downturn is by
lowering interest rates to encourage construction and investment.
   Noting the Federal reserve already has eased credit, the
chairman pointed out that the Fed does not control the long-term
rates that influence investment.

   Federal marshals say they have spent more than
$360,000 on security and transportation for Manuel Noriega since
the deposed dictator was escorted out of Panama after the U.S.
invasion.
   The Marshals Service has cited ``the extraordinary costs of
security details'' each time Noriega has been shuttled from and to
his private prison suite for court appearances 24 miles away.
   The information was obtained by The Miami Herald on a Freedom of
Information Act request and published Thursday.
   Noriega is awaiting trial on charges of accepting $4.6 million
from the Medellin cocaine cartel to protect U.S.-bound drug
shipments.
   The security bill through November totaled $363,694, including
everything from decoy vehicles to overtime for Noriega's flight
aboard a C-130 cargo plane from Panama to Homestead Air Force Base
south of Miami.
   ``It's not cheap, but it's not unique,'' said Marshals Service
spokesman Steve Boyle in Washington. ``In situations where there's
high potential for media interest or security concerns, the costs
are quite extraordinary.''
   Noriega has appeared in court five times since Jan. 3, when he
surrendered to face drug indictments in Miami and Tampa.
   Boyle refuses to say how much each courthouse trip costs because
``we don't want to give anyone the basis to calculate the level of
security he gets.''
   He notes that marshals have handled other costly inmates, such
as Colombian cocaine kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas. The
transportation bill for the Medellin cartel smuggler ``exceeded $1
million before we were finished'' with his 7{-month trial in
Jacksonville.
   Federal expenses for Noriega's quarters at the Metropolitan
Correctional Center southwest of Miami already have raised some
eyebrows.
   His custom-built cell features an exercise bicycle, telephone,
copying machine and computer - equipment the government installed
to guarantee his rights to physical exercise and attorney access
without endangering his security.

   Iraq on Thursday sent a group of senior diplomats back to their
overseas posts, saying it was ready for ``serious and constructive
dialogue'' to avert war. But it denied it was launching a new peace
initiative.
   Kuwait's foreign minister said it was too late for peace
initiatives in the Persian Gulf, maintaining that only military
force would dislodge Iraq from the oil-rich emirate that it invaded
Aug. 2.
   Less than three weeks before the Jan. 15 U.N. deadline for Iraq
to pull out of Kuwait or face possible force, President Bush sought
to dismiss newspaper accounts that his two senior military advisers
told him U.S. forces are not fully ready to fight.
   ``Don't believe these reports you're reading,'' Bush told
reporters outside the White House. He interrupted his Christmas
vacation for a day of work.
   Bush also met with Soviet Ambassador Alexander Bessmertnykh, who
delivered a letter from Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
Aides said they did not know the content of the message.
   On Wednesday, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein met with 20
diplomats who had been recalled to Baghadad, diplomats said on
condition of anonymity. They included the envoys to the United
States, the Soviet Union and the United Nations.
   ``We are ready for a serious and constructive dialogue based on
mutual respect and the rejection of the course of hegemony and
arrogance which the American administration tries to impose on
us,'' the state Iraqi News Agency quoted Saddam as telling the
diplomats. The report Thursday was monitored in Cyprus.
   But Saddam repeated his demand to link an Israeli withdrawal
from the West Bank and Gaza Strip with any Iraqi pullout from
Kuwait, the Iraqi diplomats said on condition of anonymity. The
United States has refused to link the two issues.
   Saddam showed little willingness to compromise on the issue.
Iraq is ``ready to take any sacrifice for the battle it wages
against the United States and its allies,'' the news agency quoted
him as saying.
   Iraq also denied reports in recent days that Saddam was
preparing a diplomatic initiative ahead of the Jan. 15 U.N.
deadline.
   The diplomats said the envoys were beginning to leave Iraq on
Thursday to return to their posts overseas.
   Iraq said it still has not agreed to any direct talks with
senior U.S. officials to try to avert war. Bush also denied any
movement on direct U.S.-Iraqi talks.
   On Thursday, Saddam met with Soviet Deputy Premier Igor Belousov
about the gulf crisis, a Soviet diplomat said. There were no
details on their discussions.
   Kuwait's foreign minister, Sheik Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, said
that only military force would dislodge Iraq from Kuwait.
   ``The whole world has given enough time for a peaceful
settlement of the gulf crisis,'' the Kuwaiti official told a news
conference in Beijing.
   ``Whether by the Arab world, whether by the friendly countries,
whether by the Third World countries, or by the big powers, it is
very late for such (peace) initiatives. It wuld not be useful,''
the sheik said.
   Iraq has more than a half-million troops, 4,000 tanks, 2,500
armored personnel carriers and 2,700 artillery pieces in Kuwait and
southern Iraq, U.S. officials said.
   It test-fired a surface-to-surface missile Wednesday within its
own borders, aimed away from the multinational forces, U.S.
officials said. No further details were disclosed.
   Previous tests put some of the 300,000 American forces deployed
in Operation Desert Shield on a heightened state of alert. The U.S.
Command would not comment on the current alert status.
   In other developments Thursday:
   -Thousands of women and children demonstrated in Baghdad to
protest the U.S. interception of an Iraqi freighter in the Arabian
Sea. The protesters marched from downtown Baghdad to the U.S. and
British embassies, singing patriotic songs and shouting slogans
denouncing the interception of the ``peace ship.''
   The Iraqi freighter was seized Wednesday by U.S. and other
forces. It was reportedly carrying sugar to Iraq in violation of
the U.N. trade embargo.
   -Iran test-fired a Soviet-made, SA-6 anti-aircraft missile,
acknowledging for the first time that it had acquired the advanced
long-range weapon. A Tehran radio broadcast did not say where the
surface-to-air missile was fired, or how many of the advanced
weapons Iran has bought. Iraq in August agreed to Iranian
conditions to end the 1980-88 war between the two nations.
   -Jordan has beefed up its security forces along the cease-fire
line with Israel as a precaution against a surprise attack by the
Jewish state, Jordanian military sources said. They declined to
give any figures of military strength along Jordan's western
border.
   Israel's military has been on alert since Iraq invaded Kuwait
and said it would retaliate if Iraq attacks.

   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis signed a clean air bill
Thursday that goes beyond new federal requirements for auto
emissions in limiting pollutants blamed for acid rain and the
greenhouse effect.
   The measure is based on California's tough new standards.
Supporters said Massachusetts is the first state in the nation to
go along with California's tighter controls.
   State Rep. David Cohen, who sponsored the bill, said last week's
passage of the standards in Massachusetts may encourage other
states to follow.
   ``There are many, many states that are looking at doing what we
did, but they were afraid,'' Cohen said. ``Massachusetts was a
trailblazer in this action.''
   ``We hope to create a domino effect,'' said Jenny Carter of the
Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group.
   Massachusetts air quality failed to meet federal health
standards on at least 40 days during the past three summers. ``This
law will help reverse that trend,'' Carter said.
   New York also is considering the California standards, said
Benjamin Marvin of the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation.
   The Massachusetts bill says the new standards will be phased in
beginning in 1993, but in reality state officials reached a verbal
agreement with automobile manufacturers to start the program with
the 1995 model year.
   Carter said she expects most manufacturers will adapt to the new
law by refining catalytic converters.
   She estimated that the measure would cost consumers an extra
$170 when they buy a new car, but tighter warranty standards
included in the new law would help defray that one-time cost.
   The plan calls on car makers to cut smog-causing hydrocarbon and
nitrogen oxide emissions by 50 percent to 75 percent beyond what is
required under the new federal Clean Air Act, averaged over their
entire fleet.
   Dukakis said the federal government must do more to fight
pollution and to save energy so that the United States becomes less
dependent on foreign energy supplies.
   ``There's one other way to clean the air and that's to make
automobiles more efficient,'' Dukakis said.
   An operator at General Motors Corp. in Detroit said company
officials would not be available to comment because of the
holidays, and a recorded message at Ford Motor Co. said offices
there are closed until Jan. 2.
   Dukakis also signed two other environmental bills, one to
protect endangered species and the second to make local
conservation commission members front-line agents in monitoring
wetlands protection laws.
   The endangered species bill protects the habitat of threatened
species from alteration. It also establishes a process for listing
species as endangered, threatened or of special concern and
prohibits the taking or selling of species that make the list.
   The wetlands conservation measure gives local conservation
commissioners the power to protect wetlands. In 1988, the state's
Supreme Judicial Court ruled that the conservation commission
lacked authority to enforce the wetlands protection act.

   Police say the larcenous hopes of two
boat burglars were dashed when they realized they were up a creek
without a paddle.
   ``Their master plan is to burglarize the boat, load up the
dinghy and make good their escape,'' said Detective Bill Wagner.
``What happens is they get the dinghy loaded and realize it has no
oars.''
   A 19-inch television, a 13-inch television and several bottles

thieves then turned their attention to a nearby house.
   Rolex watches, 40 figurines and other household goods were

   Police later arrested Marvin Lee Jones, 25, in the house
burglary. A second suspect remains at large.

   President Bush said today he was ``very
comfortable'' with the state of readiness by U.S. military forces
in the Persian Gulf, despite concerns expressed by military
commanders that the force won't be fully prepared for offensive
action until mid-February.
   ``I feel that the situation is exactly where I was told it was
going to be at this time,'' Bush told reporters at the White House.
``Don't believe those reports you're reading'' that readiness is
lagging.
   The United Nations has set a Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq to
withdraw from Kuwait, and has authorized the use of force after
that date to evict Iraqi forces. The United States will have more
than 400.000 troops in the region by the time the current buildup
is complete.
   Bush also said there had been no progress in efforts to work out
a date for Secretary of State James A. Baker III to visit Baghdad
to discuss a peaceful situation to the gulf situation.
   The president, briefly interrupting a Camp David vacation, also
met with Soviet Ambassador Alexander Bessmertnykh. The diplomat
delivered a letter from Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. Aides
said they did not know the content of the message, which came as
the Soviet Union is embroiled in domestic political turmoil.
   Bush's comments on the Persian Gulf were the latest in a series
of mixed signals about readiness for military action. Lt. Gen.
Calvin A.H. Waller, a senior commander in Saudi Arabia, told
reporters last week that U.S. forces would not be fully ready for
offensive action until mid February.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who met with area commanders in
the Middle East, concluded his visit by saying ``the situation is
not improving'' with regard to Iraqi occupation of Kuwait and ``the
days are drawing closer when we may be forced to resort to military
force.''
   Bush said that Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, made a report to him after their trip to the
Gulf that was ``quite different than most stories I've been reading
in the last few days'' in newspapers.
   At the same time, Bush did not directly deny reports from the
New York Times and other news organizations that Cheney and Bush
had relayed the concerns of military officers about U.S. troop
readiness.
   ``I'm not going to tell you what they said, but I'm going to
tell you, don't believe these reports you're reading.''
   ``It's under control. I've got total confidence in the chairman
of the joint chiefs, and the secretary of defense and our commander
out there to whom I talked over the holidays ... don't be misled by
these rabbit trails running through the snow out there.''
   He challenged reporters to ``show me the quotes'' from Cheney
and Powell and dismissed the stories as ``rumors of what somebody
is alleged to have told me.''.
   Told the stories were in the newspapers, he said, ``That doesn't
make it right.''
   Bush also expressed seeming irritation with the public comments
made in recent days on the subject.
   ``I think it would be very useful if from the president and
others there were fewer comments about readiness ... There's been
enough said about readiness,'' Bush said.
   The president addressed the subject twice during the day - once
in a hallway encounter with reporters and again before boarding his
helicopter for a return trip to Camp David.
   Bush, a well-known workaholic, denied he had returned to the
White House for the day because he was bored, as an official had
said.
   ``Do I look bored?'' he said.
   Bush telephoned French President Francois Mitterrand and former
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Monday from Camp David,
said spokesman Doug Davidson.
   He told reporters today that while on vacation, he was ``staying
in very close touch'' with the developments in the Gulf.
   Asked about prospects for the proposed meeting between Baker and
Iraq's President Saddam Hussein, he said, ``There's nothing going
on on that front.''
   The two countries have been unable to agree on a date for the
meeting to discuss the gulf situation.
   U.S. officials say the Iraqis insist on Jan. 12, while the
administration wants the meeting no later than Jan. 3, contending
that a later date would give Saddam Hussein time to stall on
getting his troops out of Kuwait by the deadline.

<HEAD>Menem Reluctantly Says He'll Turn Over Controversial Ferrari</HEAD>

   President Carlos Menem weathered
a month of criticism before reluctantly deciding he'll turn over
the keys to a controversial red Ferrari - once he gets out of
office.
   The luxury sports car, reported to be worth $100,000, became a
political lemon for Menem after it was first seen parked at his
official residence Nov. 20.
   Menem, an avid sportsman and amateur rally car driver, at first
was thrilled by the gift from the Italian motorcycle company Ducati
Meccanica. But last week he grudgingly told the weekly newsmagazine
Gente:
   ``As I am very respectful of laws, I'm going to leave this car
as property of the nation (when my term ends in 1995).''
   Argentine law stipulates that any gift over a certain value
belongs to the presidency, and must be handed over upon completion
of office.
   By Menem's own admission, before the criticism he had no
intention of turning over the keys. ``It's mine, mine, mine,'' the
60-year-old president told a nationally broadcast interview show.
   The car was a gift from Ducati chief G. Franco Castiglioni. In
an accompanying letter, he said he felt honored by Menem's visit to
Rome during the soccer World Cup matches last summer, and bestowed
the Ferrari 348 TB on Menem ``So you don't forget Italy.''
   But questions kept popping up in newspaper columns, magazine
stories, radio talk shows and cocktail conversations.
   How could Menem, who is cracking down on tax evasion, accept a
personal gift that bypassed customs duties of $170,000 and arrived
apparently free of charge via the state airline?
   What kind of example was Menem, who has denounced corruption
among public officials, setting by saying it was acceptable to
accept a gift worth several times one's annual salary?
   And what did it say about a president who urges his countrymen
to tighten their belts amid a recession as severe as any this
century, but who doesn't appear willing to share their sacrifices?
   ``What is at issue is his reputation for political shrewdness,''
the English-language Buenos Aires Herald commented. ``His `mine,
mine, mine' attitude ... suggests a dangerous lack of restraint or
willful greed or a childish streak or a tragic flaw of some kind.''
   In the Gente interview, Menem called suggestions he should have
immediately donated the car to charity ``stupid hypocrisy.''
   ``They (Ducati) gave it to me. Why should people be
scandalized?'' he was quoted as saying.
   Argentine law stipulates that any gift over a certain value
belongs to the presidency, and must be handed over upon completion
of office.
   Menem, a touch grudgingly, said he will do just that.
   ``But meanwhile, I'm going to use it myself,'' he said.

<HEAD>OAS Calls Meeting on Suriname Coup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Organization of American States summoned
member states to a special meeting Friday to discuss a Venezuelan
request for prompt action to restore the constitutional government
in Suriname.
   The president of the Washington-based OAS's permanent council,
Juan Pablo Lohle of Argentina, on Thursday issued a formal
communique calling the meeting at Venezuela's request.
   Venezuelan Ambassador Guido Grooscors said the Christmas Eve
coup was a ``severe violation of the principles of the OAS
charter'' and should not be sanctioned.
   Grooscors called for the OAS to convene in emergency session in
Washington but said the meeting may have to be delayed because many
ambassadors are away for the holidays.
   On Wednesday, the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry said it would
refuse to recognize Suriname's new military government, and asked
for a ``firm response'' to the bloodless coup that ousted President
Ramsewak Shankar.
   Shankar had served two years of the term to which he was elected
in November 1987.
   Shankar was ousted in an uprising led by acting army chief Cmdr.
Ivan Graanoogst, who has pledged to hold elections within 100 days
and relinquish power.
   The Bush administration has condemned the takeover and has
advised Americans not to travel to the former Dutch colony.
   Brazil, which holds good trade relations with Suriname and is
reportedly its largest South American creditor, Thursday did not
appear to consider any special action necessary.
   A spokesman for the Brazilian embassy in Caracas said that
Brazil viewed the coup as an ``internal affair,'' and said: ``The
position of Brazil is not to intervene.''

   A fourth grade class was studying electricity and
the image of a lightning bolt was frozen on the TV screen. Then
teacher Rodelle Tompkins touched the remote control and zapped the
bolt to life, and her science class was off on an energetic
discussion.
   It was just the sort of reaction educators hope videodisc
textbooks will create, especially in once unapproachable subjects
such as science.
   ``It's more funner than reading a book,'' said Nathan Young.
   ``It's easier - there's no reading and writing,'' said classmate
Martin Maniha.
   Laser videodisc textbooks have been in use in an estimated 7,000
U.S. schools, but Texas is the first state to allow districts to
use textbook money to buy them.
   The 12-inch discs, resembling the smaller compact disc used for
music, can show still and moving pictures on a television screen,
and without having to close window shades and turn out lights.
   The discs also provide higher quality sound and image than
videotape, allow the use of freeze frame - like the lightning bolt
- without loss of detail, and can hold information equivalent to
54,000 photographic slides on each side.
   Mrs. Tompkins, who says her former school district in the Rio
Grande Valley ``was lucky to get a book, let alone videodiscs,''
says the videodiscs provide more information by exciting a greater
portion of the class.
   And she says they're better than movies.
   ``When you turn off the lights (to show a movie), the bottom 3
percent of the class goes to sleep, and the top 5 percent have
already seen it,'' she said.
   But a noisy minority of Mrs. Tompkins' pupils at Lamkin
Elementary School prefer curling up with an old-fashioned book to
watching their science project go by at MTV speed.
   ``It's better to learn when you read by yourself,'' said Colleen
Wade.
   And Brian Bassi added: ``I don't like it that much. I think
reading is better than just watching and listening.''
   ``Reaching kids is an extra big problem in science teaching
these days,'' said Phyllis Marcuccio, assistant executive director
of the National Science Teachers Association in Washington.
   ``The volume of scientific information is so much greater these
days, it's hard to get across in books,'' Ms. Marcuccio said,
adding that videodiscs also allow children to see people working,
which could ``open up career dimensions for them.''
   The videodisc program Windows on Science, produced by Optical
Data Corp. of Warren, N.J., comes with a suggested script for
teachers and workbooks for the students.
   One laserdisc program costs about $1,000, but that's considered
comparable to textbooks for a class because of the amount of data
each one provides and that it can be used over and over.
   Although Optical Data's ``Windows on Science'' program, which
teaches biology, geology and elementary physics, is the only
approved electronic textbook in Texas, other programs in social
studies and health are becoming popular, said Optical Data
spokeswoman Pam Herber.
   Those programs include a history-through-geography program,
similar to National Geographic television shows, and a program
partly produced by ABC News on current events such as the Middle
East, the 1988 presidential campaign and AIDS.
   Although some pupils may still prefer books, educators say that
teaching science electronically can increase the number of video
generation children turned on by once unapproachable subjects.
   ``Just because he can't read doesn't mean he can't think,'' Mrs.
Tompkins said.

<HEAD>Tapping from Capsized Barge Indicates Some Crew Alive</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rescuers working Thursday in a
snowstorm and heavy winds off the Finnish coast said they heard
tapping inside a capsized barge, a sign that some of the 10 men
aboard may be alive.
   Rescuers worked into the night, long after winter darkness fell
over the Baltic Sea at mid-afternoon. Winds of 54 knots were
expected to slow overnight but the water temperature was 36
degrees.
   The Finnish barge Finn-Baltic overturned at about 1 p.m. (6 a.m.
EST) in rough waters off the southwestern port of Hanko. The
550-foot-long, 15,000-ton vessel was carrying iron ore between
Finnish ports.
   Rescuers expressed concern that the coastal pilot and 9 crewmen
aboard the pusher section of the craft had drowned. The barge was
reported entirely submerged, several yards below the surface of the
sea.
   Jan-Eric Dahlberg of FG Shipping, the barge owner, said divers
who tapped on the hull heard answering taps from the men inside,
all believed to be Finns.
   Finnish news media quoted Captain Lars Boxstrom of the Gulf of
Finland Maritime Rescue Center as saying, ``If there are people in
the vessel, it is completely possible they are still alive because
inside the vessel there is an air pocket.''
   Later, officials said the barge drifted into shallower water and
that part of it was 13 feet above the surface, enabling rescuers to
walk on the hull. They speculated that the craft became stuck on
the seabed.
   Dahlberg said an attempt could be made to cut open the hull with
an acetylene torch, if the water was not too rough.
   News reports said oxygen was being pumped into the upturned
barge.

   The Environmental Protection Agency announced
Thursday that employees may no longer routinely smoke inside EPA
offices and facilities.
   The EPA directive, aimed at protecting nonsmokers from passive
smoke, applies to 120 agency facilities nationwide. The agency said
that employees will be provided with separate smoking lounges
equipped with special ventilation systems.
   The previous EPA policy allowed smoking in other designated
areas as well as in restrooms and sections of cafeterias.
   The new smoking policy comes as the EPA staff is considering a

passive smoke causes lung cancer. A final report on the draft
study, which has been widely distributed, is expected to be issued
sometime next year.

<HEAD>Unwanted Boulder Has a New Owner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOMER, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of Alaska's most famous rocks - a cause
celebre after a car wash owner sued city hall to move it - has a
new owner.
   Mac Mackintosh lost his fight in small claims court last week
when he tried to get $3,000 in back rent from the city of Homer for
a boulder left in his car wash parking lot.
   But the saga of the unwanted rock had a happy ending Wednesday,
when Shawn Kinney bought it for $1 and paid $125 to have it
delivered by forklift as a Christmas present for her husband, Mark.
   ``He's one of those people who for years, at birthdays and
Christmas, says, `Oh, I don't need anything,''' Shawn Kinney said.
``Then my son came home one afternoon and said, `I found out what
Dad wants. He wants the rock at the car wash.'''
   Movers hoisted the boulder Wednesday with a 26-ton forklift used
for unloading containers from ships. Even the forklift proved
barely up to the task. It took all afternoon to pry the rock from
the soil and carry it 100 yards uphill to the Kinneys' house.
   The boulder, which weighs between 25 tons and 35 tons and is the
size of small sports car, became news after Mackintosh sue the
city last October. He claimed the boulder was excavated during a
city street-widening project and left in the lot when the car wash
had a different owner.
   Mackintosh told the city that its boulder was blocking his
efforts to expand his business.
   ``They were laughing me out of their office like it was a big
joke,'' said the 45-year-old entrepreneur. ``It may seem like a
joke to an outsider, but it's not a joke if you're stuck with a
rock this size.''
   City manager C.E. Swackhammer said the boulder wasn't the city's
responsibility. He said he spent several thousand dollars in
employee time fighting Mackintosh's lawsuit because he was
concerned about a precedent putting the city in the boulder-moving
business.
   ``It would have been cheaper for me to have moved the rock,''
Swackhammer said. ``But other people have rocks.''

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev turned defeat into
victory Thursday by persuading lawmakers to approve his choice for
the Soviet Union's first vice president, a new post in a
reorganized federal government.
   The vote came on the last day of a stormy, 10-day session of the
Congress of People's Deputies. It was representative of the entire
legislative meeting, during which Gorbachev got much of what he
wanted - but not without a struggle.
   The Congress had endorsed Gorbachev's draft of a treaty to hold
together the crumbling union, and approved his proposals for
national referendums on whether to allow private ownership of land
and whether to preserve the union. It also accepted his plan to
strengthen presidential power.
   Early Thursday, legislators handed Gorbachev what appeared to be
his biggest defeat, rejecting his candidate for the vice presidency
- Gennady I. Yanayev - by 31 votes. But Gorbachev insisted on his
choice, requested a second vote, and Yanayev was approved.
   Yanayev, a relatively obscure 53-year-old Communist bureaucrat,
said he saw the vote as a referendum on Gorbachev.
   ``The vote this afternoon relates not only to me, but the
policies of the president,'' Yanayev told reporters.
   Yanayev was the only candidate for vice president, a post
created as part of the reorganized federal government hierarchy
that was adopted by legislators Wednesday.
   The vice president assists the chief executive and, under a
constitutional amendment, ``replaces the president of the U.S.S.R.
in case of his absence and inability to carry out his duties.''
   Legislators at first balked at giving the relatively unknown
Yanayev such a potentially powerful, visible job,. Some said they
wanted a candidate who had more experience with the economy.
   The first vote Thursday by the country's highest legislative
body was 1,089 for Yanayev and 583 against. He needed at least
1,120 votes, a simple majority of the 2,239 registered deputies.
   But Gorbachev, stone-faced, ignored calls from lawmakers to put
forward a different candidate. He said it was important the vice
president be someone in whom he had complete confidence.
   ``The fact that only 583 deputies or 25 percent of the Congress
voted against Comrade Yanayev persuades me to ask the Congress to
vote again,'' he said.
   Radical economist Oleg Bogomolov, a Congress delegate, said
Yanayev lost the first vote because the bureaucrat is ``a
representative of the party leadership and central committee
apparatus. He's very obedient, very conformist.''
   Yuri Golikh, chairman of the law enforcement committee of the
Supreme Soviet legislature, said: ``I think he didn't win because
the deputies didn't have a feel for him as a leader.
   ``He has not spoken on serious, philosophical, conceptual topics
in either the Congress or the Supreme Soviet,'' Golikh said.
   Yuri Kalmykov, chairman of the jurisprudence committee, said
many deputies wanted ``someone with experience in industry and
economics.''
   Nevertheless, after the renomination, several lawmakers rose to
praise Yanayev and to urge support for Gorbachev.
   Marshall Sergei F. Akhromeyev, a presidential adviser and former
armed forces chief of staff, urged all deputies to vote in the
second round.
   On the second ballot, deputies voted 1,230-563 for Yanayev. The
remaining ballots were not filled out or were declared invalid.
   After an official announced the result of the ballot,
legislators, joined by Gorbachev sitting on the rostrum, applauded.
Yanayev, sitting in a special section for party and government
officials, stood to acknowledge the applause.
   Gorbachev had initially planned to nominate Eduard A.
Shevardnadze for the job. But Shevardnadze resigned as foreign
minister last week to protest what he said was a drift toward
dictatorship.
   In comments to the legislature after being nominated Wednesday,
Yanayev, an ethnic Russian, supported Gorbachev's reformist
policies but also took a somewhat hard-line tack, calling for law
and order.
   Yanayev belonged to the Communist Party youth organization,
Komsomol. In the early 1970s he came to Moscow as chairman of the
U.S.S.R. Committee of Youth Organizations. He wrote his
dissertation on international youth movements.
   In the 1980s, he served for six years as deputy chairman of the
Soviet Friendship Society, which maintains non-governmental
contacts with foreigners.
   He later returned to party work, becoming a secretary of the
policy-making Central Committee. He was elected to the party's
ruling Politburo in July after a party shake-up that also
significantly reduced its authority.
   Yanayev is leader in parliament of the 730-member Communist
bloc.

   John Davis, one of the real voices behind
the pop music facade Milli Vanilli, says he's finally getting some
recognition.
   ``Everywhere I go now, when I'm getting on a plane, people wave
and say, `There goes the Milli Vanilli guy,' '' Davis said during a
holiday visit to his parents.
   Davis, 36, gained attention when German record producer Frank
Farian revealed Rob Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan did not sing a note
of Milli Vanilli's mega-selling debut album.
   The real voices were Charles Shaw, Brad Howell and Davis, a 1972
graduate of Anderson's Westside High School.
   The group, minus Pilatus, Morvan, and the name ``Milli
Vanilli,'' has an Arista Records album coming out Jan. 20,
tentatively titled, ``Keep on Running.''
   The pop duo was forced to give back their Grammy won for best
new artist after it was revealed that they did not sing on their
hit album ``Girl You Know It's True'' and were lip syncing the
words in concert.

   A man pleaded guilty Thursday to felony sex
charges for feeding drug-laced spaghetti to two women and then
sexually assaulting them.
   Nicola Iannone, 35, who had fled to Italy, was ordered jailed
without bail pending sentencing Jan. 24 on two counts of gross
sexual imposition involving the women on Feb. 23, 1988.
   He could be sentenced to 1{ years in prison and fined $2,500 on
each count.
   As part of a plea bargain, prosecutors dropped charges of rape
and corrupting another with drugs. They also dropped similar
charges involving an alleged victim in October 1987; the person in
that case moved out of state and could not be found, said Chris Van
Harlingen, an assistant prosecutor.
   Ms. Van Harlingen said the two women who were assaulted in 1988
did not object to the plea bargain.
   An arrest warrant was issued for Iannone after he failed to show
up for arraignment in May 1988. The FBI announced in March 1989
that Iannone had been found in Milan, Italy.
   Iannone had lost an extradition proceeding in Italy and was
appealing it when he decided to return to the United States and
face the charges, said his lawyer, Martin Pinales. Iannone was
jailed for 15 months in Italy while the extradition proceedings
were pending.
   Iannone returned from Italy last week.
   ``It gets the entire matter behind him,'' Pinales told reporters
after the hearing. ``He didn't want it hanging over his head.''
   Iannone's victims alleged that after he fed them a pasta dinner
at their Cincinnati apartment, they lost consciousness and woke up
the next day with their clothes off. The charges Iannone pleaded
guilty to alleged that he gave the women drugs, either by force or
deception, and had sexual contact with both of them.
   Police said laboratory analysis found the leftover spaghetti
contained codeine and the prescription sedatives Valium and Elavil.
   Iannone, an Italian-born naturalized U.S. citizen, worked as a
restaurant consultant in Cincinnati and Chicago.

<HEAD>General Extradited From U.S. To Be Pardoned</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Carlos Menem said
Thursday he will pardon a general who was extradited from the
United States to stand trial for murders committed during the
1976-83 dictatorship.
   The general, Carlos Suarez Mason, commanded an army corps
responsible for the greater Buenos Aires area during the military's
``dirty war'' against suspected leftist subversives.
   More than half of the 8,960 people who the government said were
arrested and presumed killed during the crackdown came from his
area.
   Menem said the general will be included in a pardon that will
also free from jail former generals and military presidents Jorge
Videla and Roberto Viola, and Mario Eduardo Firmenich, co-founder
of the leftist Montonero guerrillas.
   The presidential decree, due by year's end, is necessary for
national reconciliation, Menem told reporters.
   ``The pardons are going to cancel a sad stage of the past that
we have to overcome,'' said Menem, referring to four army
insurrections since 1987 and other signs of unresolved emotions
that stem from the military's ``dirty war'' against subversion.
   The pardon is opposed by religious and human rights groups,
jurists, leftist political parties and, polls show, between 60 and
80 percent of all Argentines.
   Suarez Mason, 66, has been in jail since arriving in handcuffs
from California in May 1988. However, his trial on 39 separate
charges of murder was continually postponed, in part because of the
political nature of the case.
   Suarez Mason led the First Army Corps following the March 1976
overthrow of President Isabel Peron. In 1978, he was promoted to
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. Upon retiring in 1981, he
was named president of the state oil monopoly YPF, a post which he
held until 1982.
   Raul Alfonsin, president from 1983-89, personally ordered Suarez
Mason's trial. Prosecutors wanted to charge him with 635 human
rights abuses, including 23 counts of kidnapping and 43 counts of
murder; and misappropriating $2 million from YPF.
   However, under terms of the extradition, Suarez Mason may be
prosecuted only for the 39 charges of murder, which allegedly were
committed by troops under his command.
   For fleeing in 1984, when Videla, Viola and other junta leaders
were about to go on trial, Suarez Mason was cashiered by his fellow
generals.
   Suarez Mason eventually settled under an assumed name in Foster
City, Calif., a suburb of San Francisco. He was arrested in January
1987.
   The Menem government, in power since July 1989, apparently first
intended to exclude Suarez Mason from the pardon of the handful of
officers and terrorists not already pardoned.
   However, Menem said the trial of Suarez Mason would only inflame
public passions if he called officers to appear in his defense.
Menem said such a trial would only renew public debate about the
crackdown.

it will test raw milk weekly around the nation to determine if it
contains certain antibiotics.
   The agency said 250 locations across the country will be chosen
for testing and raw milk samples will be collected each week from
five of these sites, selected randomly.
   The samples will be tested for the presence of eight sulfa drugs
and three tetracycline drugs. The FDA said that when residues are
found, the states will be told and the agency will help track down
the source.
   ``As newer analytical methods become available, milk will be
monitored for additional drugs,'' the FDA said in a statement.
``The system will add another layer of protection for consumers.''
   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., attacked the plan as inadequate.
   ``Testing five milk samples per week means that each processing
location in FDA's program will be visited only once a year,'' he
said in a statement. ``FDA's attempt to describe this as a
nationwide program is ludicrous. To even call it a modest proposal
is a wild exaggeration.''
   Weiss, who is chairman of the House Government Operations
subcommittee on human resources, conducted hearings earlier this
year on the FDA's milk-testing methods.
   He said more hearings may be needed ``to examine whether the
agency purposely designed a plan that would not find any residues.
   ``FDA's paltry effort will tell the public virtually nothing
about the true extent of animal drug residues in milk,'' said the
congressman.
   In November, Weiss released a General Accounting Office study
that recommended the FDA work with dairy states to improve
screening tests for residues of drugs in milk. The GAO study said
the agency should also test, on a random basis, the types and
amounts of drug residues found in state screening samples.
   Raw and processed milk that is susceptible to interstate
shipment is now tested by states for penicillin and
penicillin-related drug products. The tests are not conducted
routinely, however, for other antibiotic residues, such as sulfa
and tetracycline drugs. Under the current program, the 50 states
and the District of Columbia test milk samples from every U.S.
dairy farm at least four times every six months.
   Antibiotics are often used by veterinarians to treat infections
in dairy cattle. Testing is conducted to determine if residues from
the drugs are present in the milk.

   Texas House Speaker Gib Lewis, who
weathered charges of unethical conduct to win re-election last
month, admits he went on a lobbyist-paid junket to Mexico.
   A topless dancer reportedly went along but Lewis says he doesn't
remember.
   The trip is one of a variety of issues a grand jury apparently
is examining as it investigates ties between Texas legislators and
lobbyists.
   Since the grand jury convened in November, the investigation has
spread into allegations of misconduct by up to 20 current and
former lawmakers and lobbyists, according to Travis County District
Attorney Ronnie Earle.
   ``The general subject has to do with the Legislature and its
relationship to the lobby,'' Earle said. The grand jury's session
was expanded for three months beyond its original Dec. 31
expiration date.
   Lewis, 54, is the best known legislator caught up in the
investigation. He was invited to appear before the panel Thursday,
but said he would decline the invitation unless Earle would say how
he is connected to the investigation.
   Like Lewis, speakers in New York and California are under a
cloud as the three states prepare for new legislative sessions.
   New York state Assembly Speaker Mel Miller has pleaded innocent
to federal mail fraud charges stemming from an alleged real estate
scam. Miller claims the charges, which are not connected to his
legislative office, are politically motivated.
   California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown reportedly is being
investigated about allegations that he was involved in legislation
aimed at helping a regional garbage company get around local
restrictions on landfills. Brown has not been charged with any
crime and his spokesman has denied any impropriety on Brown's part.
   The Texas investigation reportedly has focused on trips taken by
Lewis, one of the top three officials in state government, to
Mexico and the Caribbean with members of the law firm of Heard
Goggan Blair &amp; Williams.
   During the past eight years, Heard Goggan has used a
little-noticed revision in state law to become one of only a few
firms that can collect delinquent taxes.
   The law allows a private firm hired by local governments to
collect a 15 percent fee on top of overdue tax bills. County
attorneys collecting taxes cannot add the fee, and legislative
records show that numerous bills that would have diminished Heard
Goggan's tax-collecting business died in House committees.
   Oliver Heard Jr., a spokesman for the San Antonio law firm, said
he was not on the trip and had no personal knowledge of it.
   ``We're cooperating fully with the investigation,'' Heard added.
   Lewis, a Democrat from Fort Worth, has been speaker for eight
years, controlling the House by assigning bills to committees,
naming their chairmen and directing floor debate. He is seeking an
unprecedented fifth term in January.
   Lewis' admitted trip to Mexico in April 1987 appears to have
attracted most of the investigators' attention.
   Six women, including a topless dancer named Chrissee,
accompanied Lewis, four partners in the law firm and an Austin
lobbyist to a resort on the Pacific coast of Mexico, the Houston
Chronicle has reported.
   Lewis denied any wrongdoing and said he doesn't remember a
topless dancer or anyone named Chrissee on the trip.
   He said he welcomes the inquiry bu has accused Earle of
``spoonfeeding'' grand jurors selective evidence.
   ``I think they are pretty much on a rabbit chase,'' Lewis said.
``But I'm glad they're doing it. ... I want to cooperate with them,
do everything I can, because I think the air needs to be cleared.''
   The media have reported for two years about lavish spending by
special interest lobbyists trying to influence the Legislature and
other state officials.
   Gov.-elect Ann Richards and Lt. Gov.-elect Bob Bullock have
promised that ethics reform will be a top priority when the
Legislature convenes Jan. 8.
   Despite the grand jury investigation, Lewis' re-election as
speaker appears secure.
   Lewis has been involved in such controversies before. He was
fined for failing to disclose his business ties, criticized for
taking other lobbyist-paid trips, embroiled in a scandal involving
state stocking of deer, elk, turkey and black bass on his ranch,
and accused of killing bills opposed by his lobbyist friends.
   He recently retained two former prosecutors who worked for Earle
to represent him in the current ethics investigation. And he hired
two former aides to Richards to handle relations with the media.

   California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, a San Francisco
Democrat, reportedly is being investigated by federal authorities
for his alleged involvement in legislation aimed at helping a
regional garbage company get around local restrictions on landfills
during the mid- to late 1980s.
   The company was a client of Brown's at the time the various
bills were moving through the Legislature, paying him at least
$70,000 in legal fees. Some of the bills were approved, others
vetoed by the governor.
   Brown, the second-most powerful state official in California,
has not been charged with any crime.
   According to newspaper reports, witnesses who testified before a
federal grand jury said that the panel's interests appeared to be
focused on Brown. Brown's spokesman, Michael Reese, has denied any
impropriety on Brown's part.

   Assembly Speaker Mel Miller pleaded innocent Dec. 20 to federal
mail fraud charges involving allegations of a real estate scam.
Miller, a Democrat from New York City, and top aide and former law
partner Jay Adolf were indicted on 19 counts of mail fraud,
conspiracy and falsifying documents.
   The charges relate to Miller's private law practice and not his
position as a legislator. Miller, 51, has been in the state
Assembly since 1970 and was elected speaker in 1987. He is state
government's second most powerful Democrat, behind Gov. Mario
Cuomo.
   Miller has charged that the indictment amounted to a political
witch hunt.
   ``The only thing I'm guilty of is being speaker of the New York
state Assembly. I have done nothing,'' Miller said. ``We believe
the crimes are being brought because I'm a very nice victim and it
would be wonderful to put my scalp in someone's belt.''

<TEXT>
   Albania's Communist president has pledged
to relinquish the party's constitutionally guaranteed leading role
in society, the state news agency reported Thursday.
   But the new opposition party said the Communists were not moving
toward real democracy. It said it would continue to press for
postponement of Feb. 10 elections so it has time to prepare, and
suggested that a referendum be held to set the date for the first
multiparty ballot since the Communists took power in 1944.
   President Ramiz Alia, facing mounting student protests and the
threat of economic collapse, has sped up reform in this Stalinist
nation. He legalized an opposition party this month for the first
time since the country fell under Communist rule.
   Speaking at a national party conference Wednesday, Alia said
officials must ``deviate from many principles of socialism'' as the
nation dismantles its hard-line system.
   According a report Thursday from the official ATA news agency,
Alia also said Parliament would begin action on constitutional
amendments immediately after the Feb. 10 elections, in which the
party will face opposition candidates for the first time.
   The Communist Party would demand ``upon its own initiative and
free will ... changing the article in the constitution fixing
juridically its leading role in the state system,'' Alia said.
   Until student protests earlier this month, Albania had refused
to stray from Communist orthodoxy. In his speech Wednesday, Alia
stressed that despite the reforms the party ``does not intend to
abandon its Marxist ideology.''
   He promised, however, to reform the party and, in a further sign
of the country's emergence from decades of self-imposed isolation,
to allow Albanians to work abroad.
   In the unusually frank speech, he acknowledged that the economic
situation was ``grave'' because of a severe drought this past year,
reduced exports and productivity, and a failure to fulfill
centrally-planned targets.
   But a Democratic Party co-founder, Gramoz Pashko, said from
Tirana Thursday that the Communists were ``not moving forward for
realistic democratization of the country.''
   He charged that Alia's pledges for economic reform ``were only
on paper'' as long as the party continues to cling to Marxism.
   Pashko said that in the opposition's view, the Communists had to
``make a detailed analysis of the crisis. ... This is needed to
figure out how to emerge from the situation.''
   Alia has edged cautiously toward reform but the Communists still
control virtually every sphere of public life.
   On Monday, the government rejected the opposition's request to
postpone the elections for two or three months to allow it more
time to prepare an effective campaign.
   In July, thousands of Albanians complaining of political
repression and economic hardship streamed into foreign embassies
and refused to leave until they were allowed to emigrate.
   Passports have been theoretically available to Albanians since
May, but few of the backward nation's 3.2 million citizens have the
hard currency needed for foreign travel.

<HEAD>Court Throws Out Case Against Omni Magazine</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York state's top court Thursday threw
out a $30 million lawsuit filed against Omni magazine by a couple
angered that their family photo illustrated an article about
coffee's effect on fertility.
   The state Court of Appeals said in a unanimous decision it was
reluctant to second-guess an editorial decision. Trial level and
appellate courts also had rejected the family's lawsuit.
   Joseph and Ida Finger of Saugerties, N.Y., and their six
children were pictured beside an article titled ``Caffeine and Fast
Sperm'' in Omni's June 1988 issue. The article discussed medical
research that indicated in vitro fertilization rates may be
enhanced by exposing sperm to high concentrations of caffeine.
   ``Want a big family?'' the photograph's caption read. ``Maybe
your sperm needs a cup of java in the morning. Tests reveal that
caffeine-spritzed sperm swim faster, which may increase the chances
for in vitro fertilization.''
   The couple, who conceived their children naturally, had been
photographed for an article in a Catholic publication, said their
lawyer, Paul Gruner. They weren't aware that a photo service had
given their picture to Omni until a friend showed Mrs. Finger the
magazine, he said.
   ``When it became known in a small community, the children were
the subject of some ridicule,'' Gruner said.
   The couple argued that their civil rights were violated because
the picture was used without permission. State law prohibits the
use of a photograph without consent for purposes of advertising or
trade.
   Court of Appeals Judge Fritz Alexander noted that courts have
consistently refused to apply the civil rights law to news
articles, limiting those interpretations to advertising.
   ``Questions of `newsworthiness' are better left to reasonable
editorial judgment and discretion,'' Alexander wrote.
   Alexander said the Fingers had a misperception about the theme
of the article, which the judge said was more about increased
fertility than in vitro or ``test tube'' fertilization.
   The judge said there's clearly a ``real relationship'' between
the fertility theme and a picture of six healthy, attractive
children who all bear a striking resemblance to their parents.
   Laura Handman, lawyer for Omni, said the article made it very
clear that the medical findings are only in the laboratory stages.
   ``You have to assume a certain degree of common sense by the
reader,'' Handman said. ``I don't think there's been any family
created by six cases of in vitro fertilization - coffee or no
coffee.''
   But Gruner said the decision gives the press too much freedom to
use pictures of people with articles that have nothing to do with
them.

   President Bush on Thursday sought to stem
reports that U.S. forces aren't yet ready for offensive action in
the Persian Gulf, saying he was ``very comfortable'' with the
firepower on hand.
   However, he declined to directly deny reports that the troops
will not be prepared to launch an attack by Jan. 15, the deadline
set by the United Nations for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
   At one point during questioning on the matter, Bush told
reporters at the White House ``I've said all I want to say about
readiness.''
   ``I think it would be very useful if from the president and
others there were fewer comments about readiness,'' he said.
   ``I feel that the situation is exactly where I was told it was
going to be at this time,'' Bush said. ``Don't believe those
reports you're reading,'' he said, referring to accounts that his
military advisers have warned him that the U.S. force will not be
suitably prepared for offensive action until mid-February. By then,
more than 400,000 troops and much more armor will be deployed in
the region.
   ``We're going to fully implement the United Nations
resolutions,'' which authorize force to get Iraqi troops out of
Kuwait, he said. ``The United States will do its part to fulfill
every single one of them.''
   He made the comments to reporters who encountered him in a White
House hallway, and later to a group gathered to watch him fly off
to resume his vacation at Camp David, Md., after returning to the
White House for part of the day.
   Bush met Thursday morning with the Soviet ambassador, Alexander
Bessmertnykh, who delivered a message from Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   Bush said the message contained ``friendly words of greeting
from President Gorbachev, and I had a chance to ... ask the
ambassador to give him our best wishes for a happy new year.''
   He said he discussed with the Soviet envoy the current domestic
turmoil in the Soviet Union, where Gorbachev is struggling to keep
a lid on the explosive tug-of-war between reformers and
conservatives, and the challenge to his own position.
   Bush said there had been ``no progress'' on setting a meeting
between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein to discuss a peaceful solution to the gulf crisis.
   Still, he said, he hopes for a peaceful solution.
   The Iraqis have insisted the Baghdad meeting be Jan. 12, but
Bush said there will be ``no compromise'' on the U.S. position of
scheduling it no later than Jan. 3.
   Referring to a meeting earlier this week with Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, after their visit to the gulf, Bush said, ``I'm very
comfortable with the briefing, and the briefing I had was quite
different than most of the stories I'm reading in the last day or
two.''
   The New York Times and Washington Post both cited unidentified
sources this week as saying the top military advisers warned him
the troops would not be ready to launch an attack by Jan. 15.
   The president challenged reporters Thursday to ``show me the
quotes'' from Cheney and Powell, and dismissed the stories as
``rumors of what somebody is alleged to have told me.''.
   Asked what they did tell him, Bush said, ``I'm not going to tell
you what they said, but I'm going to tell you, don't believe these
reports you're reading.''
   ``It's under control,'' he said, adding he has ``total
confidence'' in his Pentagon team. ``Don't be misled by these
rabbit trails running through the snow out there.''
   The president's comments were the latest in a series of
mixed-message statements by officials on preparations for a Persian
Gulf war.
   The administration has been casting about since last week to put
a positive spin on statements by Lt. Gen. Calvin Waller in Saudi
Arabia, who was the first to publicly state that he would recommend
Bush wait until mid-February to attack, if that proves necessary.
   But Bush on Saturday said the allied forces ``are ready to
respond vigorously'' within 10 minutes if provoked.
   Cheney said last week that U.S. forces would be in position to
attack ``soon after Jan. 15,'' if necessary.
   Also on Thursday, 101 members of Congress wrote Bush urging him
to hold off on a military strike to give international economic
sanctions more time to take hold.
   The letter, drafted by Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., contends
that the U.N. vote authorizing use of force in the Gulf ``does not
commit, or authorize the use of the United States armed forces,''
in an armed conflict.
   That authorization ``lies solely with the Congress of the United
States,'' the letter said.

   The Internal Revenue Service message
about giving taxpayers a Christmas break apparently never reached
all the people at the Postal Service.
   University of Florida student Gerald Rose had just finished
reading a news account about an IRS decision to delay the mailing
of tax forms from the day after Christmas to Friday when he found
the IRS packet in his mailbox.
   ``I thought, `No, this isn't right,''' he said Wednesday after
collecting the unwelcome mailing.
   IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg had decided to postpone the
annual mailing of 108 million tax packages to extend feelings of
holiday cheer.
   But the plan backfired in this Broward County community.
   IRS spokeswoman Barbara Nichols explained the IRS delivers the
forms to the Postal Service at least a week before Christmas to be
held for delivery after the holiday rush.
   ``If some got delivered, it was by mistake,'' said Postal
Service spokeswoman Cesta Ayers in Miami. ``Probably one or two
stationmasters got antsy.''
   Rose said the early delivery was ``not too nice - especially
after they made a big thing out of it that they were going to mail
them later.''
   But he may have the last laugh. Rose expects a refund.

   President Carlos Menem said
Thursday he no longer supports the idea of executing by firing
squad the leaders of the Dec. 3 army rebellion.
   ``Here, there won't be any executions,'' Menem told reporters
over breakfast at Government House.
   He said his earlier statements in favor of the death penalty
``were the product of the moment and the indignation which the
action of the insurgents provoked in me.''
   More than 600 officers and troops face hearings before the
Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, the military's highest
tribunal. Nearly all were expected to be drummed out of the
military.
   At least 13 people - eight soldiers and five civilians - died in
clashes when rebels seized the joint chiefs of staff headquarters,
an infantry base and a tank factory in the Buenos Aires area and
other installations elsewhere.
   The military prosecutor last week recommended the death penalty
for retired Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin, who also led a December
1988 barracks revolt, and four other rebel leaders.
   A decision by the council, which may be appealed in civilian
court, was expected by next month. If the death penalty is upheld,
Menem could commute it to life in prison or some other punishment.

   The parliament of the Russian Federation, the
largest Soviet republic, voted Thursday to make the Jan. 7 Russian
Orthodox Christmas an official holiday for the first time since the
1917 Revolution.
   Its decision came in response to an appeal by the Patriarch of
Moscow and all-Russia, Alexy II, the national news agency Tass
reported, and is effective only in Russia, which comprises
two-thirds of all Soviet territory.
   Ruslan Khasbulatov, leader of the Russian Congress of People's
Deputies, said other religious groups ``will be respectfully
considered in the same spirit'' if they apply for recognition.
   The Orthodox church marks Jan. 7 as Jesus' birthday. Most other
countries celebrate Christmas on Dec. 25.
   The Bolsheviks banned official religious celebrations after the
Communist revolution. Since then, Jan. 7 has not been an official
holiday, although many clandestine services were held.
   It wasn't known how the resolution would affect celebrations in
other republics, particularly the predominantly Catholic Baltic
states that have led the way in declaring sovereignty from the
Kremlin.
   The national legislature has passed a law on freedom of religion
but has not declared any official holidays on religious dates.

<HEAD>Japanese Legislator Charged with Tax Evasion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A legislator has been charged with evading more
than $12 million in taxes on stock profits, prosecutors announced
Thursday, a day after he resigned from the governing party.
   The case represents a new blow to Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's
Liberal Democrats. The party was discredited last year by a
separate scandal over political donations and bargain stock deals
for dozens of influential politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen.
   Toshiyuki Inamura, 55, who served as a Liberal Democrat in the
House of Representatives, was charged with evading $12.7 million in
taxes on profits of $20.8 million from stock dealings from 1986 to
1988, according to the Tokyo Public Prosecutors Office.
   Inamura's personal physician, Akiyuki Yamaguchi, was also
charged with evading $6.13 million in taxes in 1986-87, chief
prosecutor Yusuke Yoshinaga said. The doctor allegedly provided
insider information to Inamura from a third man now being tried on
charges of manipulating stock prices.
   Inamura, a former director general of the Environment Agency,
could be fined up to $23.7 million in back taxes and penalties,
local news reports quoted tax officials as saying. Tax officials
contacted by telephone refused to comment on the reports.
   Last year's scandal contributed to the resignations of two prime
ministers. The Recruit Co., an information services conglomerate,
was accused of trying to influence government policy with
sweetheart stock deals and political donations.
   Kaifu, chosen for his clean reputation, was installed as prime
minister in August 1989. He immediately vowed reform to restore
public trust in politics.
   However, reforms are still under debate, and Kaifu is locked in
a struggle with powerful party faction leaders to prevent
politicians implicated in the Recruit scandal from gaining
ministerial posts.
   In the Inamura case, the stock earnings were found to have been
put to his personal use. The Prosecutors Office said Inamura used
part of his stock profits to buy a luxury home in Tokyo. The
remainder was reinvested in stocks, it said.
   The legislator, who resigned Wednesday from the Liberal
Democratic Party, remains free because of a law prohibiting police
from arresting legislators during a parliamentary session. He will
face trial in Tokyo District Court.

Unconstitutional</HEAD>

<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Key provisions of Indiana's new law
regulating out-of-state trash are unconstitutional because they
inhibit commerce among states, a federal judge ruled Thursday.
   U.S. District Judge John D. Tinder permanently banned the state
from enforcing three provisions, concluding they violate the
Constitution's commerce clause allowing free trade among states.
   ``The same protection that the commerce clause gives to the
citizens of other states who feel the need to import waste into
Indiana protects Indiana citizens when they export hazardous waste
to other states,'' Tinder wrote.
   ``Those provisions (in the Constitution) will protect future
generations of Hoosiers should they find the need to export even
solid municipal waste to another state,'' the opinion said.
   Tinder's ruling came five months after the end of a trial on a
lawsuit filed by two Pennsylvania trash haulers. Theychallenged
the law shortly after Gov. Evan Bayh signed it last spring.
   One provision struck down Thursday required a trash hauler to
certify where the largest part of the waste in a shipment was
generated. Another required an out-of-state hauler to receive a
health officer's certification that the shipment contained no
hazardous or infectious waste. A third provision imposed a dumping
fee equal to the fee charged at the landfill closest to the
shipment's point of origin.
   Bayh, vacationing in South Carolina, issued a statement saying
he will meet with the state's congressional delegation and contact
other governors to solicit help in getting federal law changed.
   ``We will not let down in the fight against the indiscriminate
dumping of East Coast trash on Indiana,'' Bayh said.
   At the state level, Bayh said he has instructed the Indiana
Department of Environmental Management to provide more inspections
and tougher enforcement to stop illegal hazardous or infectious
waste from entering Indiana.
   He said he also will meet with legislative leaders and consult
with volunteer legal experts to consider new laws to stem the flow
of out-of-state trash.
   Attorney General Linley E. Pearson said about a half-dozen other
states had similar trash laws struck down on the commerce clause
argument.
   The Indiana law was passed with bipartisan support after Bayh
and legislators expressed alarm their state had become a dumping
ground for trash from Eastern states.
   The ruling doesn't disturb other provisions of the law that
require solid waste management plans within Indiana, impose a
tipping fee on all waste deposited within the state and require
haulers of waste within Indiana to certify the county of origin of
the trash shipment, Tinder said.
   Those provisions are in effect.
   The trash shippers' attorney, Bruce L. Thall, said the same
provisions that made the law politically popular undermined its
chances to withstand legal challenge.
   ``This was a palpably unconstitutional attempt just to stop
out-of-state trash at the borders,'' said Thall, who represented
Government Suppliers Consolidating Services Inc. and Jack Castenova
Inc.

   President Fidel Castro declared ``a general
amnesty for pigs,'' meaning Cubans will forgo their traditional
holiday meal of pork because of hard times, Cuba's official news
agency Prensa Latina said Thursday.
   ``About 200,000 pigs will survive the New Year festivities in
Cuba as part of the official strategy to protect livestock,'' it
said in a dispatch from Havana, monitored in Mexico City.
   Castro personally defended the porkless holiday when questioned
by lawmakers during the yearend parliamentary session on farm
production.
   ``People asked why there was no pork in the markets,'' Prensa
Latina said. ``It was necessary to explain the reasons.''
   Castro said massive holiday slaughter would have cost the lives
of young pigs in the prime of their reproductive lives and made
pork scare in January, February and March.
   ``We have decreed a general amnesty for pigs,'' he said as
parliament burst into laughter and applause.
   Communist Cuba is in the grip of its most serious economic
crisis since Castro took power 32 years ago. The president has been
bracing his island nation for even tougher times when Soviet aid is
sharply reduced. Castro says he is putting Cuba on the sort of
austerity footing that would come in wartime.
   Oxen are replacing tractors, city dwellers are being sent to the
countryside to work in the fields, and food, fuel and manufactured
goods are being rationed.
   Cuba now relies on the Soviet Union for 90 percent of its oil
and 70 percent of its trade. But the Soviets will stop paying Cuba
above-market prices for sugar next year and will start charging
market prices for oil.

<HEAD>Snow From Missouri To Appalachians, Rain Over South</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow fell Thursday on the central Appalachians and across the
Ohio Valley, and rain dampened the Southeast and South, including
areas plagued by flooding last week.
   At midday, snow fell in portions of Pennsylvania, Maryland,
Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and
Missouri.
   In Missouri, snow sent workers home early, canceled airline
flights and high school basketball tournaments, and prompted
several hospitals to issue pleas for four-wheel-drive vehicles to
drive doctors and nurses to work.
   The St. Louis area received about 4 to 6 inches of snow and
other parts of southeastern Missouri were hit with up to 8 inches,
the National Weather Service said.
   Bollinger County Sheriff Januare Peters said about 8 inches of
snow fell there and roads were just about impassable with anything
but a four-wheel-drive vehicle.
   ``It's snowing so hard no one can get out of the house. And I'm
glad about that,'' Peters said.
   Freezing rain was scattered over northern Arkansas, western and
north-central Kentucky, northern Georgia and northern North
Carolina.
   Rain extended over southeastern Virginia, much of the remainder
of North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, northern Alabama,
Mississippi, the remainder of Arkansas, Louisiana and eastern
Texas.
   Snow and rain across Tennessee raised water levels that were
already swelled by persistent precipitation.
   In Obion, Tenn., about 70 people remained evacuated from their
30 homes following the worst flooding in the town of 1,300 in
decades. The Obion River was at 24.8 feet Thursday morning near
Bogota - almost 3 feet above flood stage. A slow fall was forecast
despite additional rain Thursday.
   Pre-Christmas floods that claimed one life receded in northern
Alabama but downstream the draining water pushed some rivers above
flood stage in largely rural southwestern regions of the state,
where some residents traveled from home to home by boat.
   In the Northwest, rain fell over western Washington state and
northwestern Oregon, and snow was scattered over the Washington
mountains, the Idaho Panhandle, western Montana, eastern Idaho and
west-central Wyoming.
   At midday, Washington's Stampede Pass had a 41-inch cover of
snow.
   Blizzard warnings were posted through Friday over nrthern
Montana, with winter storm warnings in effect into Friday across
southern Montana. Wind gusted to 77 mph at Livingston, Mont.,
during Thursday morning.
   Winter storm warnings also were posted through Friday across the
northwestern interior section of Washington state, with a winter
storm watch over the southwest interior area.
   Elsewhere, snow fell from central Minnesota into northwestern
Wisconsin.
   The heaviest snowfall during the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST was
4 inches at Kalispell, Mont., and 2 inches at Joplin and
Springfield, Mo.
   Record lows Thursday were 23 below zero at Alamosa, Colo., and 9
below at Marquette, Mich. Sacramento, Calif., tied its record of 26
and Winslow, Ariz., tied its record of 3 below.
   Thursday's low for the Lower 48 states was 23 below at Alamosa
and International Falls, Minn.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from zero at
Cut Bank, Mont., to 83 in Florida at Naples and Tampa.

<HEAD>Israeli Finance Minister Says He `Bought' Coalition Partners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai, in remarks
broadcast Thursday, said he has used public funds to buy the
support of coalition partners and keep the right-wing government's
Cabinet from collapsing.
   Modai's remarks follow reports that some ultra-Orthodox parties
in the Cabinet were demanding more government money for their
religious schools and other institutions as a price for support.
   On Wednesday, State Comptroller Miriam Ben-Porat issued an
unusually harsh report accusing the ultra-Orthodox Torah Guardians
faction of concealing records of transactions with state funds.
Israeli reports said the money amounts to hundreds of thousands of
dollars.
   The faction's support is crucial to maintaining Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's narrow majority of 62 in the 120-member
Parliament.
   In his remarks broadcast on army radio, Modai said the
government was in danger of collapse. He was speaking Wednesday
night to supporters in the coastal city of Netanya.
   ``If you only knew how many government crises I have bought off
in the past few months, not with jobs as Cabinet ministers, but
with money,'' he said. ``There is no other way of preserving this
structure.''
   ``We have lost the component of personal example in leadership.
Our government doesn't project stability,'' Modai was quoted as
saying.
   The finance minister, who heads a breakaway faction of Shamir's
right-wing Likud bloc, did not elaborate. His spokesman could not
be reached immediately for comment.
   The reports of demands for funds by orthodox parties have
stirred controversay bcause they come at a time when the government
is increasing income taxes to finance an unprecedented wave of
Soviet immigration. Nearly 200,000 Soviet immigrants are expected
this year.
   In her comments Wednesday, Ben-Porat, the state comptroller,
said on Israel television that parliamentary financial records kept
by Communications Minister Rafael Pinchasi of the Torah Guardians
Party, were ``intentionally hidden from me.''
   Reading from her report, Ben-Porat added that evidence suggests
``the main reason for hiding the listings'' is that much of the
money went to religious seminary students who worked in the party's
election campaign.
   ``Exposure of their names was liable to hurt them ... in terms
of army recruitment and taxes,'' she added.
   Many religious youths are exempted from compulsory military duty
if they can prove their time is being devoted to study of the
scriptures.
   She also sent a copy of her inquiry to State Attorney General
Yosef Harish, a step usually taken when a criminal suit is being
considered, Israeli reports said.
   Police have been investigating the issue for three months after
evidence of graft surfaced during a separate inquiry centering on
Interior Minister Aryeh Deri, a prominent member of the Torah
Guardians, Israel radio said.
   Deri has denied any wrongdoing. The investigation is reportedly
still under way.

<TEXT>
   The Census Bureau's day-old population count
came under swift criticism Thursday from a key congressman and some
state and local officials who argued it had missed many urban
Americans and would cost large cities federal funds.
   The Bush administration official in charge of the census,
Michael Darby, defended it as ``full, fair and accurate.''
   Rep. Tom Sawyer, D-Ohio, chairman of the House census
subcommittee, said the ppulation count ``may be the first one to
be less accurate than its predecessor.'' He noted the total was 4.7
million people below an estimate made in October, and added,
``We're saying the apparent discrepancy is cause for concern.''
   The count released on Wednesday pegged population in the United
States - excluding nearly 1 million Americans living abroad - at
248.7 million, an increase of nearly 10 percent from a decade ago.
In general, it showed large population gains in California,
Arizona, Florida and other Sun Belt states, and far smaller
increases in the industrial northern states and the agricultural
heartland.
   The governor of New York and the mayor of Meridian, Miss.,
called separately for continued legal challenges to the count. The
census process has been criticized throughout the year by municipal
and state officials, who say it skips people in urban areas,
particularly the poor.
   The census numbers are important to those officials because they
determine how many representatives each state sends to Congress and
how much federal aid states, counties and cities will get. An area
that's undercounted, for example, will have less political clout
and will get less federal money.
   ``New York will continue to make every effort both in the courts
and elsewhere to have all New Yorkers counted, so that we can
maintain our vital and important voice in Washington and ensure our
fair share of federal dollars,'' said New York Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   ``We know where those 5 million folks are,'' Jimmy Kemp, mayor
of Meridian, Miss., said of the difference between the October
estimate and this week's count. ``You're going to find them in your
cities where you have the most economically disadvantaged folks.''
   Rep. Thomas Ridge, R-Pa. and senior Republican on the census and
population subcommittee, said it was wrong to call the difference
between the October ``guesstimate'' and this week's count a
discrepancy.
   ``The fact that you couldn't hit the projection, in my view, is
not legitimate grounds for criticizing the enumeration process
itself,'' Ridge said.
   The Census Bureau said this week that there were in fact 249.6
million Americans. But it isn't accurate to compare that figure to
the 1980 tally because it includes 1 million Americans living
abroad, who weren't counted ten years earlier.
   Darby, the under secretary of commerce in charge of the Census
Bureau, said he believed the 1990 census was ``full, fair and
accurate,'' but he added no one now can say how accurate.
   ``Right now we don't know just how good the census is'' and
won't know until statistical checks have been completed this
summer, Darby said. ``Certainly there's no valid basis for making a
judgment about an undercount or overcount at this point.''
   More than 6,000 local governments - including the nation's 51
largest cities - filed challenges against preliminary figures with
the Census Bureau. The resolution of those local challenges will
help determine the final census totals.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, under whose direction the
Census Bureau operates, has until July 15 to decide whether to add
people that the local officials say were not counted.
   Ralph Munro, secretary of state of Washington state, expressed
concern that eastern cities challenging the census results might
prevail.
   ``We're thinking of intervening on the other side to argue that
the numbers should stand,'' he said.
   New York City Mayor David N. Dinkins said he was ``mad as hell''
with the census figures.
   ``We will fight it to the hilt, because it means to us about a
billion dollars over 10 years and of course a loss of
representation, which is tremendously important,'' he said.

   Masked and armed with knives, students from
Mozambique staged a riot in Cuba that left one person dead and
another hospitalized, the Cuban government news service Prensa
Latina said Thursday.
   The rioters vandalized buildings and vehicles on Wednesday and
threatened to destroy their dormitories and classrooms in Isla de
la Juventud, an international student community in southern Havana
province, it said.
   Prensa Latina, based in Havana and monitored in Mexico City,
quoted the official Agencia de Informacion Nacional as saying the
students demanded that the government of Mozambique pay them dollar
stipends for their grant studies program.
   They brawled among themselves and leveled threats at other
students in an attempt to force them to join in the rowdy protest,
the agency said.
   It said Mozambican Ambassador Ammur Zacaria Kupela asked Cuban
authorities to subdue the rioters after negotiation attempts
failed.
   Cuba reaffirmed its support for continued diplomatic ties with
the southeast African nation and promised to maintain an atmosphere
for continued studies by international students in the Communist
island nation, Prensa Latina said.

<HEAD>State Puts Off Decision On Whether To Continue Killing Bison</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE MOORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HELENA, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State wildlife officials put off a decision
Thursday on a temporary plan to kill wandering bison from
Yllowstone National Park to ensure they don't spread disease to
cattle.
   The plan, which was the subject of a hearing, includes a
provision to have federal rangers help state wardens kill the cows
that wander outside the park.
   Officials say cows are more likely to carry the disease
brucellosis than bulls, and putting the responsibility for their
killing in the hands of wardens and rangers should reduce the
chances of their spreading disease.
   About half of the 2,500 to 3,000 bison in the 2-million-acre
park are believed to carry brucellosis, a disease that causes
cattle to abort. Montana spent millions of dollars over a decade to
eradicate brucellosis in its cattle.
   Hunters would continue killing bulls outside the park and calves
would be captured, sterilized and sold at auction.
   Animal rights groups are lined up solidly against killing the
animals, contending the threat of passing brucellosis from bison to
domestic cattle is minimal or non-existent.
   The Montana Department of Livestock and the Montana
Stockgrowers' Association are equally adamant in demanding the
invading bison not be allowed even the slightest chance to
contaminate public and private rangeland abutting the park's
northern and western boundaries.
   The plan has caused a furor this winter, with critics -
including some sport hunters - complaining that killing the bison
has wounded Montana's reputation as a refuge for wildlife.
   ``Let's get hunters out of the business of shooting bison,''
Brian Kahn of Helena said during Thursday's hearing.
   He characterized himself as a life-long hunter and supporter of
hunting, and said state officials must take a serious look ``at
what this bison hunt is doing to the image of hunting.''
   Knute Hereim, a rancher from Martinsdale representing the
stockgrowers' association, said livestock producers support the
state's attempt to keep infected bison from possibly reinfecting
Montana herds.
   He said officials in Yellowstone have not taken steps to control
the animal health risk. ``Immediate action must be taken,'' he
said.
   Pat Graham, associate director of the state Department of Fish,
Wildlife and Parks, said all comment submitted at Thursday's
hearing, a previous hearing Dec. 14 and written comment would be
assessed before a final decision is made, probably next week.
   A decision had been scheduled for Friday. Graham said there is
no immediate threat of hundreds of bison moving from the park into
Montana, giving the department longer than originally anticipated
to make its decision.
   During both public hearings this month and in much of the
written comment, the National Park Service has been criticized for
not controlling bison movements or cleansing the herds of
brucellosis.
   Yellowstone Superintendent Robert Barbee said earlier that the
park is cooperating fully with attempts to find a long-term
solution to the bison problem. He also said the call by Montana
officials for the U.S. Department of Agriculture to issue a
quarantine order for the park was inappropriate.
   The Fund for Animals, based in New York City, filed suit in
federal court against the bison control plan. It contends the plan
reflects a ``shoot-anything-that-moves'' mentality by state
wildlife officials.
   In written testimony, the fund contended the plan is biased in
favor of ``the self-serving interests'' of Montana's livestock
industry. It called for non-lethal means of controlling the
infected animals.
   So far this winter, only hunters have been used to kill bison
wandering across the park's border in the region near West
Yellowstone. Eleven bulls have been killed.
   Two seasons ago, 569 bison were killed.

<TEXT>
   The Chinese characters that can be
used to name babies in South Korea will be legally restricted
starting next year to make it easier for the government to keep
computer records of its citizens.
   In a ruling published Thursday, the Supreme Court said 2,731
Chinese characters will be legally recognized beginning in April,
eliminating thousands of others.
   The court said the ruling is meant to facilitate computerization
of family registers and avoid the confusion that often arises from
having to transliterate complicated Chinese characters.
   Fewer and fewer Koreans read Chinese and many prefer the simpler
Korean Hangul alphabet for naming children.
   Critics of the decision say the number of strokes in a name is a
crucial determinant of fate, and claim that the restriction
infringes on their right to choose their child's name.
   In 20 to 30 years, when babies born after 1991 are adults, the
use of Chinese characters will have declined to such an extent that
nobody but the name-carriers themselves may be able to read such
names, the court said.
   Unlike China, Hong Kong and Japan, which belong to the same
language group as Korea, Korea has not transfigured or simplified
the Chinese characters it uses.

<TEXT>
   A leading rabbi has outraged Holocaust
survivors and secular Israelis by claiming that the Nazi genocide
was God's punishment for sins such as violating the Jewish Sabbath
and eating pork.
   Hundreds of Israelis called a radio talk show Thursday to let
off steam about the remarks of Rabbi Eliezer Schach, 97, an
ultra-Orthodox rabbinical sage who, by a quirk of the electoral
system, also happens to be the kingmaker of Israeli governments.
   About 6 million Jews perished in the Holocaust, and tens of
thousands of survivors live in Israel. The uproar over Schach's
remarks reflected the deep sensitivity still felt in this country
over the Holocaust, 45 years after the last death camp was
liberated.
   ``Not for a long time has any single remark caused such an
emotional reaction,'' said Razi Barkai, the host of the Israel
radio talk show. He said calls ran about 3-2 against the rabbi.
   At one level, Schach was simply repeating a theme common in the
Bible: of divine retribution against the Jewish people for straying
from the path of their religious law.
   But at another level, many took his remarks to mean that the
Jews somehow were to blame for the Nazis' behavior.
   ``The Almighty keeps a balance sheet of the world, and when the
sins become too many, he brings destruction. We don't know how long
his patience holds out, sometimes 20 years, sometimes 10, and
sometimes only a year,'' Schach told Jewish seminary students
earlier this week.
   ``The last time he brought destruction, it was the Holocaust.
... Because of the sins, the Almighty may bring another Holocaust
upon us, and it may already be tomorrow,'' he warned.
   These sins, according to Schach, include violating the sanctity
of the Sabbath and eating pork, which is banned by Jewish dietary
law.
   Some of Schach's sharpest critics were Holocaust survivors.
   Menahem Russak, a survivor of the Auschwitz concentration camp
and a former commander of the Israeli police unit investigating
Nazi war crimes, said Schach ``shamed and humiliated'' millions of
Holocaust victims.
   His voice shaking, Russak told listeners that Schach ``not only
exonerated the Nazi murderers, but turned them into messengers of
God who were sent to punish the people of Israel for not observing
the Torah.''
   But another caller, an ultra-Orthodox woman who lost relatives
in the Holocaust, defended the rabbi.
   ``With all the pain I have, I can understand his words. We
believe in the link between sin and punishment,'' said the woman,
who did not give her name.
   Sociologist Menachem Friedman, an expert on religious
communities, said Schach's views reflect ultra-Orthodox thinking
prevalent since the 1950s.
   But secular Israelis only began listening after the
ultra-Orthodox left their self-chosen isolation and entered Israeli
politics in the 1980s, Friedman said.
   ``Rabbi Schach today is one of the most powerful men in Israeli
politics and each one of his words creates a lot of noise,''
Friedman said in an interview.
   Earlier this year, Schach in effect made Yitzhak Shamir prime
minister by ordering his political supporters to join Shamir's
coalition.
   Five percent of Israel's Jewish residents are ultra-Orthodox,
another 5 percent are sympathizers, and 20 percent are observant
but not fundamentalist. Another 70 percent define themselves as
secular, according to Friedman.
   The secular public tends to stereotype ultra-Orthodox Jews like
Schach as throwbacks to the Jews' ghetto years who never embraced
the Zionist cause. For one thing, they speak Yiddish, the language
of the ghetto in Europe, rather than Hebrew, the symbol of reborn
Israel.
   Indeed, Schach delivered his controversial remarks in Yiddish,
and Israel radio had to give listeners a translation into Hebrew.
   ``The visibility of the ultra-orthodox, those speeches, are
creating a harsh antagonism,'' Friedman said.

<TEXT>
   Abstract artist Harold Town, a
founding member of Painters Eleven, a group of 1950s modernists who
marked a new direction for art in Canada and brought Canadian
painting into the international mainstream, died Thursday. He was
66.
   Town, who had been battling cancer, died at his farm near
Peterborough, authorities said.
   A graduate of the Ontario College of Art, Town for a while
dropped painting altogether, after working on 40 canvasses at a
time, and turned to lithography, drawing, collage, etching and
sculpture.
   For years he was unsuccessful at selling his abstract work,
which was received with contempt and shock by a conservative art
community.
   By the late 1950s, he was becoming a name artist in the national
and international art circuit.
   Painters Eleven had its first exhibition in 1954. It drew large
crowds and served as a springboard for the artists involved.
   Town created a stir with his articulate, witty and outrageous
personality as much as with his art.
   He lampooned other artists, picketed against pop art, marketed
one of his paintings as a jigsaw puzzle, and illustrated books that
sold for $150 a copy.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete, and survivors were not
immediately divulged.

   Video retail giant Blockbuster
Entertainment Corp. on Thursday denied a newspaper report that it
plans to sell mailing lists of customers' rental selections.
   The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Blockbuster
plans to sell customer lists next year to direct mail companies.
The customers' names would be organized by the type of movie
rented, the newspaper said.
   A 2-year-old federal law bars video stores from disclsing the
actual titles of movies rented, but the subject matter of the
videotapes is not protected.
   Blockbuster separates its videotapes into 37 categories by
subject matter. The company has an estimated 30 million customers
who have rented videotapes.
   The Journal story quoted Allan Caplan, the Blockbuster vice
president overseeing the database record-keeping project, as
saying: ``I can turn around and promote all the John Wayne names to
the national Republican Party.''
   Wally Knief, Blockbuster's corporate communications manager,
said the story was the result of ``miscommunication.'' He said the
company has no intention of disclosing its customer lists.
   ``That does not represent company policy,'' Knief said.
``Blockbuster will not rent or sell its mailing lists. The only use
will be to provide value-added services to clients that our
customers can benefit from.''
   Caplan referred calls from The Associated Press on Thursday to
Knief's office.

   A cold wave that ruined California's navel
orange crop, which could make the fruit scarce and pricy, is
robbing thousands of citrus workers of their jobs, agriculture
experts say.
   About 450 people were fired Wednesday at LoBue Bros. one of the
biggest packing houses in the San Joaquin Valley.
   ``It was with deep regret that we had to discharge that many
people the day after Christmas,'' said general manager G.A.
Wollenman. ``That's no kind of Christmas present.''
   Joel Nelsen, manager of California Citrus Mutual, a growers
organization, estimated 15,000 people will be out of work; the
state's estimated 70 citrus packing houses will have nothing for
them to do. An undetermined number of harvest workers will also
have to look elsewhere for jobs, he said.
   The damage to crops inflicted by the sustained freeze that
gripped much of the country before Christmas occurred mostly in
California, said a report by the federal Joint Agricultural
Facility in Washington.
   Hardest hit was the California navel orange crop, which
comprises nearly 2 percent of the state's annual $16.5 billion
agricultural yield.
   About 80 percent of the current crop remained unpicked when the
freeze hit and thus was destroyed.
   ``I do not believe there is a lemon or orange in the San Joaquin
Valley,'' said farmer Don Laux. ``We basically don't have anything
left. It's over.''
   California navels generally are sold fresh, in contrast to
Florida's $1.3 billion orange crop, which mainly becomes juice.
   The dollar loss to California's navel orange crop was estimated
Thursday at $286 million to $288 million by agriculture officials
in the three San Joaquin Valley counties where they are grown
commercially.
   Industry observers said the frost caused the worst damage anyone
can remember.
   ``Prices could double because of the severe damage in the
Central Valley,'' said Claire Peters of Sunkist Growers, marketing
cooperative for about 6,000 California and Arizona growers.
   ``The fruit will be well-tested, so the quality should be fine,
but there won't be as much and it will be more expensive,'' Peters
said.
   No price increases were found at several major Southern
California supermarket chains checked Thursday. But produce
department managers for the Vons and Ralphs chains said they
expected a rise in the current price of 69 cents per pound.
   Meanwhile, some growers and packers are seeking federal relief
and workers are lining up at unemployment offices.
   Brad Stark said he would have to lay off between 200 and 300
people at his packing shed. In a normal year, his plants pack more
than 3 million cartons of oranges. This year, less than 5 percent
of the fruit can be salvaged and Stark expects his losses to
approach $30 million.
   As citrus farmers are trying to reckon the damage wrought by the
pre-Christmas freeze, others are concerned about a second cold snap
headed their way.
   Third-generation farmer Gary Cavilia knows he's already lost
this year's crop of oranges, but so far his trees have withstood
the cold.
   Another freeze, predicted for the weekend, could cause tree
splits. Extensive tree splits could set farmers back up to five
years. That's how long it would take to have trees fully producing
crops again.
   ``Most farmers, myself included, are not quitters,'' said Dave
Daguerre, who owns a 30-acre orchard. ``But the thing that is
really scary is this next storm. If it drops rain and freezes, I
don't think anyone has any hope.''
   Cavilia has invested about $1,100 an acre on his 150-acre
orchard this season.
   ``It's going to be a belt-tightening year,'' he said. ``I'm just
struggling to keep my trees alive.''

<HEAD>Bus, Park Fees to Soar in Beijing on Jan. 1</HEAD>

   Beginning Jan. 1, residents of Beijing will have
to pay double the regular fare for bus and subway tickets and up to
10 times as much to stroll in a park as the city tries to reduce
price subsidies, an official report said Thursday.
   The new rates still fail to cover the city's costs to run the
public transit and parks systems, the Beijing Evening News said.
But it did not indicate whether further increases were likely soon.
   Even for Chinese, the new rates remain relatively low. A bus
ride across the central city will cost 3 cents, for example, or
less than 3 percent of the average worker's daily wages.
   Most city parks have charged less than 1 cent for entry and now
will charge 9 cents.
   For years, governments at all levels in Communist China have
heavily subsidized virtually every public service and product sold
to urban residents, from housing to rice, at a cost of billions of
dollars annually.
   Prices have been increased selectively the past decade in an
effort to reduce the burden of subsidies. But authorities have
failed to overhaul the entire price system, as economists have
urged, for fear of causing social unrest that might threaten the
Communist Party's rule.
   After striving through most of 1989 and 1990 to hold prices
down, officials said recently that the public is ready to accept a
new round of increases. In November, sugar prices went up about 45
percent nationwide, and cotton cloth prices rose about 25 percent.
   In Beijing, the price of coal briquettes used by most families
in cooking stoves more than doubled. None of these increases
prompted public complaints.

   Four Moslem fundamentalists on Thursday
appealed to Israel's Supreme Court to overturn an army order
deporting them from the occupied Gaza Strip.
   In the occupied West Bank, three Arabs were wounded by shots
fired into their car. An anonymous caller said Jewish extremists
were responsible for the attack.
   The U.N. Security Council condemned the expulsion order last
week in a resolution that also urged more protection for the 1.7
million Palestinians living under Israeli occupation in the West
Bank and Gaza.
   Three high court judges will hear the appeal, but no hearing
date has been set, Israel radio reported. The high court has never
overturned an expulsion order.
   The deportation order, issued earlier this month, was the first
in 16 months and came despite a plea by Secretary of State James A.
Baker III for Israel not to expel Palestinians.
   Also Thursday, the Supreme Court upheld a police decision
banning Israeli and Palestinian women from holding a joint peace
march this weekend along the ``Green Line,'' which separated Arab
east Jerusalem from the Jewish western sector until 1967.
   The court accepted the police argument that public
demonstrations should be banned this week and next to prevent any
disturbances connected with Tuesday's 26th anniversary of the
founding of Fatah, Yasser Arafat's mainstream PLO faction.
   After the three Arabs were wounded, an anonymous caller told
Israel army radio: ``We are Zionist Jews, and we attacked three
Arabs near the Gush Etzion junction.''
   The army command said the Arabs were wounded near the Jewish
settlement Efrat. It said no soldiers were involved.
   In the West Bank, a 30-year-old Palestinian died Thursday of a
bullet wound suffered in a clash with Israeli troops on March 15,
1988, Arab reports said. He had been hit in the back and paralyzed
from the waist down.
   The Arab was identified as Khiary Mahmoud of the village of
Anza. Doctors said he had been treated in Jordan before being
returned to Al-Ittihad Hospital in Nablus this week.
   Mahmoud's death raised to 781 the number of Palestinians killed
by Israeli soldiers or civilians in the 3-year-old uprising against
Israeli occupation.
   An additional 332 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs,
most on suspicion of collaborating with Israel. Fifty-seven
Israelis have died in the violence.
   The army issued its deportation order on Dec. 15, a day after
three Israelis were stabbed to death in a suburb of Tel Aviv and
slogans painted at the murder scene claimed responsibility for
Hamas, an outlawed Moslem fundamentalist organization.
   The army blamed the four men for inciting the murders, not for
the crime itself. The two suspects in the slaying have not been
caught.
   On Tuesday, a military appeals panel upheld the deportation
order, saying the four incited anti-Israeli violence as ``senior
activists'' in Hamas, Arabic for Zeal.
   Defense attorney Abdul Malek Dahamshe, who filed the high court
appeal, said Thursday the hearing before the military panel
violated proper legal procedures.
   ``We had no chance to bring witnesses, we couldn't consult with
them (our clients) and we couldn't consult with other attorneys,''
Dahamshe told Israel radio.
   The men facing expulsion are Fadel Khadel Zaabut, 34, a college
instructor in Gaza City; Emad Khaled el Alami, 34, a civil
engineer; Mustafa Youssef Abdul el Lidawi, 26; and Mustafa Ahmed el
Qnuih, 45.
   Israel has expelled 60 Palestinians from the occupied
territories to neighboring countries since the beginning of the
uprising.
   Western nations, including the United States, have deplored the
practice as a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which bars
expulsions from occupied lands.
   Also Thursday, police blocked a handful of Jewish zealots from
going up to Jerusalem's Temple Mount, saying their planned
demonstration was raising tension in the Moslem community.
   A planned march by the Temple Mount Faithful group on Oct. 8
initiated a riot in which at least 17 Palestinians died in police
gunfire.
   The group's goal is to rebuild the ancient Jewish temple on the
Temple Mount, which is known to Moslems as Haram es-Sharif or Noble
Sanctuary and is the site of two historic mosques.

   The wife of Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov on
Thursday blamed ``deliberate'' criticism of her 61-year-old husband
for his suffering a heart attack after a session of the Congress of
People's Deputies this week.
   Ryzhkov, felled Tuesday, was reported in serious condition
Thursday but his wife Ludmilla said he could smile again and that
he wants to return to work after his recovery.
   She also told Tass in what the state news agency called a
tearful interview that the prime minister disagrees with some
government changes, but she gave no details.
   ``We failed to take a leave and Nikolai was nearly exhausted,''
she said. ``But his fatigue resulted not so much from work, which
he liked very much, and not from critical remarks, but from
excessive attacks that were clearly exaggerated, persistent and
deliberate.''
   Earlier Thursday, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told parliament
Ryzhkov's condition ``is serious but is not worsening.''
   Mrs. Ryzhkov said her husband suffered a myocardic infarction
``of medium gravity. ... The pain has somewhat subsided, but some
time will be needed to stabilize his emotional state.
   ``Thousands of letters and telegrams have arrived wishing
Nikolai a speedy recovery.''
   She said he never had heart problems before. He felt pains
Tuesday morning during parliament debate, but said nothing ``hoping
it would pass by itself.'' The Congress on Tuesday began debate on
constitutional amendments. One will replace Ryzhkov's Council of
Ministers with a smaller Cabinet under presidential control. A
prime minister will head it, but nobody has been named to the job
yet.
   His wife said Ryzhkov wanted to remain in government ``to work
not for individual politicians but for the state.''
   Ryzhkov was assailed by reformists after a political battle last
fall over an economic reform plan to create a market economy in the
Soviet Union. His announcement of price increases over the summer
set off a rush on stores until the government canceled the plans.
   Russian republic President Boris N. Yeltsin repeatedly demanded
Ryzhkov's removal as prime minister and called his economic
proposals too conservative.
   Tass paraphrased Mrs. Ryzhkov as saying her husband's address to
the Congress on its third day last week was ``too heavy a load.''
   Ryzhkov delivered a gloomy report on the Soviet economy while
defending Gorbachev and himself against criticism from both right
and left.
   The heart attack followed a long day of parliamentary debate.
Ryzhkov returned home about midnight, but could not sleep and woke
Mrs. Ryzhkov up at 3 a.m., she said.
   ``He was very pale, and his forehead was covered in cold
perspiration,'' she said.
   She called a doctor and he was taken to a hospital at 4 a.m.,
she said.
   ``They told me that on the way to the clinic, he tried to keep
up the doctors' spirit by attempting to joke,'' Mrs. Ryzhkov said.

   A Tel Aviv court on Thursday reversed the
dismissals of 57 Jerusalem Post employees, saying the action
violated a labor-management accord.
   The dispute began with the company's announcement in November it
would lay off the employees in economic cutbacks. On Dec. 3rd, 27
journalists were dismissed.
   About 70 staffers walked out, demanding that management uphold
an October agreement.
   The accord outlines specific procedures for dismissing workers.
It also limits the number of private contracts the company may sign
with workers.
   In response to the walkout, management told some journalists to
sign private contracts or leave within 48 hours, staffers said.
``This was an attempt to break the union as well as a flagrant
violation of the agreement,'' said Dan Izenberg, a member of the
staff committee.
   An additional 30 journalists were dismissed following the
walkout.
   The labor court ruled Thursday in favor of the staff committee,
which filed the complaints. It said the company must operate in
keeping with the October agreement.
   The Post, Israel's only English-language daily, has a daily
circulation of about 25,000 nationally. It prints an overseas
edition with a circulation of 50,000.

   Boris Fyodorov, Russia's 33-year-old finance
minister who led efforts to create a market economy in the vast
republic, has resigned in frustration over stalled progress on his
plan.
   He said in an interview published Thursday with Rossiiskaya
Gazeta, the official newspaper of the Russian Supreme Soviet
legislature, that Russian lawmakers have been unwilling to take
necessary but unpopular measures such as lifting artificial price
controls and allowing private ownership.
   ``Regrettably, there is nothing like progress toward the
market,'' Fyodorov was quoted as saying.
   The impact of Fyodorov's resignation Wednesday could not
immediately be gauged, but it was certain to raise questions by
fledgling investors and entrepreneurs in the largest of the Soviet
Union's 15 republics.
   Russian Federation President Boris N. Yeltsin, Moscow Mayor
Gavriil Popov and other reformers have been trying to attract
foreign investors and cultivate Russian businesses to stimulate the
economy.
   Two stock exchanges recently have been founded in Moscow,
although with few stocks or bonds to be traded. Hundreds of
joint-venture companies and independent ``cooperative'' businesses
already are operating in the republic despite a maze of government
ministries, laws and red tape.
   Fyodorov told the newspaper that decisions such as forming
private companies, setting up a stock market and bringing Russian
accounting practices in line with international norms ``get bogged
down in the depths of the apparatus ... of the Russian Council of
Ministers for months on end.''
   The chairman of the Council of Ministers, or Cabinet, is Ivan
Silayev, a former minister under Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev who was elected to the job over Yeltsin's objections.
   Silayev criticized Fyodorov in the Russian republic parliament
on Thursday and proposed Deputy Finance Minister Igor Lazarev as a
replacement.
   But after a ``heated debate,'' a final decision was put off
until the next session, the state news agency Tass reported.
Parliament made Lazarev acting finance minister until a replacement
is found, it said.
   ``Cabinet ministers seem to believe in all seriousness that they
can run the economy as they would run a factory,'' Fyodorov was
quoted as saying. ``Populist measures involving ever new outlays
are taken one after another, while the revenue base is being
curtailed.
   ``This is a shortcut to financial bankruptcy for the republic
and for the (Soviet) Union as a whole.''
   On Nov. 1, the Russian Federation began a program to switch from
a centrally planned, command economy to a free market within 500
days. Russian lawmakers said they wanted to move faster than the
national government, but their policies often conflict and create
confusion rather than reform.
   Fyodorov is credited with helping draft Russia's version of the
500-day plan and was a member of the joint Russian-Soviet committee
that tried to merge the governments' divergent plans.
   A devotee of British economic policies under former Prime
Minister Magaret Thatcher, Fyodorov holds a doctorate in economics
from the Moscow Institute of Finance. He has worked for the huge
Soviet economic planning agency, Gosplan, and the prestigious
Institute for Economics and International Relations.
   A serious dispute between the Russian Federation and the central
government threatens the nation's solvency.
   Gorbachev told the Congress of People's Deputies that Russian
lawmakers agreed to provide only $37.4 billion toward the national
budget for next year, $190 billion less than the republic's
contribution this year.
   The Russians complain they don't get enough back from the
national budget to justify their contribution.
   Gorbachev said that if other republics follow Russia's lead and
cut their contributions, the result would be ``a collapse not only
of the economy, but of the union.''
   He urged the Russian parliament to suspend its decision.

   Disgraced former President Chun
Doo-hwan has decided to en his two-year rural exile and may return
to the capital over the weekend or next Monday, news reports said
Thursday.
   Yonhap, the national news agency, said Chun accepted President
Roh Tae-woo's request to leave a 14th-century Buddhist temple in
the remote eastern mountains before New Year's Day.
   Kim Young-iel, one of Roh's senior secretaries, visited the
temple Thursday for talks with Chun, who went into exile in
November 1988 after apologizing for his authoritarian rule.
   Roh now says the former president should be allowed to live in
his old house. When Chun left Seoul, he said the house and other
properties would be turned over to the government to atone for his
wrongdoing.
   Chun and his wife, Lee Soon-ja, have lived in the Paektam-sa
temple for two years, isolated from the public and protected by
guards.
   A dozen of Chun's associates and relatives have been convicted
of corruption and imprisoned.

   Seventy-five percent of adults in a survey say
Americans should volunteer to help the less fortunate, but few
follow through and many shy away from helping the homeless, poor
and ill, the study found.
   Three-quarters of the 1,000 people who responded to the random
telephone survey said they would like to volunteer to help the less
fortunate, but are too busy, said Donald E. Banker, a vice
president at Lions Club International, which commissioned the
study.
   The Lions Club claims to be the world's largest service
organization, with nearly 1.4 million members in 171 countries.
   ``We're concerned about the lack of participation in our
association by the younger generation,'' Banker said Thursday in a
telephone interview from California. ``There seems to be a
hesitancy to get involved.''
   Forty-one percent of the respondents said they would rather
donate money than volunteer their time. The survey, conducted last
spring, questioned people ages 25 to 40, and had a margin of error
of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
   The survey found that among the respondents who said they had
performed any volunteer work, including helping at church or
school, many shied away from long-term commitments.
   Eighteen percent of volunteers said they spent time with
children, compared to 5 percent with the homeless and 4 percent
with people with mental disabilities or cancer. Twelve percent of
volunteers said they worked with people with physical disabilities.
   ``Children are always No. 1 because volunteers can make an
immediate difference there,'' said Jean Davis, a spokeswoman for
the Midwest regional office of the Salvation Army in Chicago.
   ``With the homeless it takes a monumental effort to make a
change. Sometimes you can't solve the problem and it's
frustrating,'' she said.
   John Donahue, executive director of the Chicago Coalition for
the Homeless, said Americans should give more time to volunteer
efforts.
   ``To really resolve the problem nationally people have to make
the commitment, rearrange their priorities,'' Donahue said.
   The Washington, D.C.-based National Coalition for the Homeless
estimates 3 million homeless people live in the United States,
Donahue said.
   Davis said the Salvation Army takes any help it can get and
designs its volunteer programs to accommodate people's hectic
schedules.
   ``We don't really have any problems getting people to volunteer
so long as we keep it short-term,'' Davis said. ``We have always
had short-term projects where a person does not need to commit for
a year or two years. They can take on one family or visit one
home.''

<TEXT>
   More than 100,000 Algerians marched
through the capital and past the presidential palace Thursday to
protest plans to ban use of foreign languages in all official
business.
   Protesters said the proposal stems from political and religious
intolerance and from excessively rapid Arabization of this NorthAfrican
country.
   Hocine Ait-Ahmed, leader of the opposition Front of Socialist
Forces, accused the government of ``complicity'' with Islamic
forces who he said championed the law.
   He was not specific, but the Moslem fundamentalist Islamic
Salvation Front has emerged as the main opposition party. After
winning local elections last summer, it tried to enforce the
Islamic dress code in several towns.
   The language restriction would impact most on French speakers.
French is the working language for many residents of this former
French colony, but is considered elitist.
   It competes with Berber, spoken by nearly a third of Algeria's
27 million people.
   In his comments during the protest Thursday, Ait-Ahmed spoke
Arabic and Berber.
   Under the proposed law, Arabic must be used in all official
transactions and schools by 1997, with fines of up to $10,000 for
violators.
   The Algerian Constitution cites Arabic as the national language,
but does not forbid use of foreign languages.
   The national legislature passed the measure, 173-8. It must be
signed by President Chadli Bendjedid before it can take effect.

   The acting army chief of Suriname
said Thursday the armed forces had acted legally in ousting the
elected president and pledged that legislators will elect a new
chief executive this week.
   Cmdr. Ivan Graanoogst said the military's overthrow of President
Ramsewak Shankar was constitutional because the National Assembly
had been left in power. He denied the takeover was a military coup.
   The assembly convened Thursday morning for the first time since
Shankar was overthrown. The constitution requires it to elect a new
president and vice president when their posts are vacant.
   Graanoogst said Shankar and Vice President Henck Arron would
present their resignations to the assembly.
   It will elect new chief executives to be installed Saturday, and
they will set the date for elections to be held within 100 days,
Graanoogst said. The assembly will also pick a new Cabinet, he
said.
   ``There is no coup at all,'' Graanoogst said on television.
``The United States, the Netherlands, France and others who have
protested are premature.''
   Surinamese returned to work after the traditional two-day
Christmas holiday. There was no unusual military presence in the
streets of the capital of Paramaribo or any sign of protest.
   However, the U.S. State Department advised Americans not to
travel to Suriname and for those living there to remain indoors.
   Suriname, a former Dutch colony, is an ethnically diverse
country of 400,000 people on South America's northeastern coast.
   The Organization of American States summoned member states to a
special meeting Friday to discuss a Venezuelan request for prompt
action to restore the constitutional government in Suriname.
   Venezuela announced a day earlier it would not recognize the new
government and demanded a ``firm response'' to the bloodless
ouster.
   However, neighboring Brazil, a major power in South America,
said through its embassy in Venezuela that it was opposes
intervention.
   In defense of the military action, Graanoogst referred to two
articles in the constitution that give the armed forces authority
to ensure ``a peaceful transition to a democratic and socially just
society.''
   Graanoogst is No. 2 in the five-member Military Authority headed
by Cmdr. Desi Bouterse, who is believed to be a key power behind
the scenes.
   Bouterse ruled as dictator from 1982-87 and resigned as military
chief just before the takeover. Graanoogst, head of the military
police, stepped in as acting military head.
   A journalist who asked not to be identified for fear of
reprisals said Shankar and Arron were resigning ``at gunpoint.''
   Shankar was quoted by the newspaper De Ware Tijd as saying he is
allowed to move freely but is staying home ``to prevent any
escalations.''
   Shankar was elected by the assembly in 1988 after his
three-party coalition, the Front for Democracy and Development, won
parliamentary elections a year earlier by a landslide. Shankar's
ouster coincided with growing popular discontent over Suriname's
deepening economic crisis.
   High inflation and unemployment have made it difficult for most
Surinamese to pay for their basic needs. The government has a
monthly trade deficit of $10 million.
   The downward spiral began during Bouterse's rule. Major factors
were the military's inexperience in managing the economy; a drop in
the world price of bauxite, the country's major export; and
guerrilla warfare that disrupted production.

<TEXT>
   American Airlines Inc. said Thursday it will
reduce its schedule by about 4 percent and lay off an unspecified
number of employees because it can't count on pilots showing up for
work.
   The Fort Worth-based carrier, the nation's second largest,
claims pilots have been staging sickouts, taxiing slowly to waste
fuel and filing frivolous requests for equipment maintenance.
   The Allied Pilots Association, which represents the carrier's
8,700 pilots, have been in contract talks since October 1989. The
old contract expired Jan. 1.
   The carrier won a temporary restraining order late Wednesday
barring pilots from actions designed to influence contract
negotiations, which have grown increasingly tense.
   But even with the court order ``we cannot count on all of our
pilots coming to work,'' American spokesman Tim Smith said
Thursday.
   By late Thursday, 24 flights were canceled, 13 of them
crew-related, Smith said. Since Sunday, 352 flights have been
canceled, including 78 that were crew-related.
   The airline handles about 2,300 flights per day.
   In a letter to cockpit crews sent Dec. 26 and released Thursday,
Robert W. Baker, American's executive vice president for
operations, said the job action will force the carrier to reduce
its schedule.
   ``Unhappily, that will cause us to issue layoff notices to a
number of employees in various categories and to increase the
number and percentage of pilots on reserve,'' Baker said.
   Placing a pilot on reserve effectively reduces pay to a
guaranteed minimum number of hours.
   A Jan. 3 hearing date has been set by U.S. District Judge John
McBryde to determine whether the temporary injunction should be
made permanent.
   The Allied Pilots Association called the temporary restraining
order a ``rush to judgment'' and said it would challenge the ruling
later.
   American spokesman Marty Heires said about 60 pilots called in
sick shortly after the injunction was announced, but other pilots
apparently decided to obey the court order.
   ``It's difficult to tell, but I would say that last night we saw
a pretty substantial spike in the number of pilots who were calling
in sick,'' Heires said. ``However, as the evening wore on, that
number was offset by the number of pilots reporting back to work.''
   Under the Railway Labor Act, airline employees cannot strike
unless a federal judge declares talks to be at an impasse and sets
a 30-day ``cooling off'' period.
   American's complaint alleged pilot actions also are prohibited
under the act.
   Since last April, American Airlines officials said, there has
been a marked increase in pilots' sick leave. Pilot sick hours
peaked at 28,082 for November, compared with 19,319 pilot sick
hours in November 1989.
   On Nov. 27, 386 American Airlines pilots were out sick, tying
the company record for most out in one day.
   American said daily flight delays attributable to pilot actions
have run as high as 215 on Dec. 19, compared with an average of 89
delays per day in 1989.
   The chief issue in the talks is money. The pilots say they want
to eliminate the so-called B-scale salary schedule, or narrow the
differences. Under the scale, pilots hired after 1983 are paid less
and advance at a slower rate, compared with pilots hired before
1983.

<HEAD>Skeptics Say Psychics' 1990 Predictions Flopped</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As predicted, the nation's most famous
psychics failed to accurately forecast 1990 news events and in most
cases were just plain wrong, the San Francisco Bay Area Skeptics
said Thursday.
   Predictions that fizzled included a Jackie Onassis marriage to
rock star Jon Bon Jovi and a tidal wave flooding New York City.
   Did you hear the one about the meteorite landing in the White
House Rose Garden? Or the Japanese finding a cure for the common
cold?
   ``These predictions can prove harmful, even dangerous,'' said
Robert Steiner, the skeptics' spokesman. ``It becomes dangerous
when you let other people control your lives with them.''
   Each year the skeptics ``dig up the predictions made the year
before to the embarrassment of those who made them,'' Steiner said.
   Steiner said no psychic predicted the genuinely surprising news
stories of 1990, including the stunning electoral defeat of the
Sandinistas in Nicaragua.
   The year's top stories were ``so unanticipated that someone
would have had to be really psychic to have predicted them,'' the
group said in a statement.
   The skeptics describe themselves as ``a group of people from all
walks of life who support the critical examination of paranormal
claims.''
   Psychic Jeane Dixon predicted that President Bush's greatest
challenge would come over the summer when he would be forced to
make ``life and-death decisions about troubles in Latin America and
China.''
   While those regions were relatively quiet over the summer
``Dixon somehow failed to foresee Bush having trouble with Iraq,''
the skeptics said.
   In a supermarket tabloid in July, Irene Hughes predicted
Jacqueline Onassis would marry Bon Jovi and Bryant Gumbel would be
fired from the ``Today'' show after a barroom brawl.
   In the same article, Marie Graciette of Los Angeles said the
largest earthquake on record would hit the sea bed near New York
City, producing a tidal wave that would flood Manhattan.
   She's also the psychic who predicted the meteorite in the Rose
Garden and the cure for the common cold.
   ``Not one prediction which was both specific and surprising came
true,'' the skeptics scoffed.

<HEAD>Unusual Tides Expected Next Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rare alignment of the sun, moon and Earth
will produce higher and lower tides than usual from Sunday through
Wednesday, raising the chances of coastal flooding, government
forecasters said Thursday.
   It will be the second round this month of unusual tides. A
similar astronomical arrangement Dec. 1 through Dec. 4. caused
local flooding on the coast of the Gulf of Maine.
   Forecasters from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration said Thursday they expect the turn-of-the-year tides
to be more pronounced on the West Coast than the East Coast.
   The Weather Service forecast no major storms on either coast,
but onshore winds are possible on the New England coast on Tuesday
and the mid-Atlantic coast Tuesday and Wednesday.
   The extra tidal displacement should amount to less than a foot,
higher at high tide or lower at low tide, the forecasts said. But
that could be enough to make a difference in some places.
   Heavy rain, snow or onshore winds could bring localized
flooding, NOAA said. Extremely low tides could expose mariners to
low-water hazards but could reduce the threat of flooding during a
storm.
   People living and working in coastal areas were urged to consult
tide tables and to be alert to weather forecasts.
   The positions of the sun, moon and earth which produce the
unusual tides occur about once a year, like so:
   -Sunday, tropic tides, where the moon is at its maximum northern
point above the equator during its monthly trip around the earth.
   -Monday, a full moon, or syzygy condition, in which the moon is
on the opposite side of the earth from the sun.
   -Monday, perigee, where the moon is closer to the earth than at
any other time in its monthly path.
   -Wednesday, perihelion, where the earth is closer to the sun
than at any other time of the year.
   In addition, on Dec. 22 the sun passed the winter solstice, its
maximum point south of the equator during the year.

<HEAD>Children Essayists Say Love, Togetherness are Important for

<TEXT>
   Divorce, drugs and child abuse are
taking a toll on the American family, but a national essay contest
asking children to define kinship showed they still believe family
values are important.
   ``A family is like a stack of bricks, one depends on each other
and that main brick is love,'' wrote one of about 1,800 children
who submitted entries.
   ``A family is like a field of mice, they stick together. They
don't wander alone,'' wrote another child.
   The winner of the contest for fifth-graders in 43 states was
Courtney Whetstine of Mount Shasta, Calif. She wrote about her
parents' divorce when she was 4.
   ``I was ready for the worst, but it worked out better than I
thought it would,'' wrote Courtney, who is 10.
   She said she appreciated her parents' efforts not to fight in
front of their children and their friendly relations after the
divorce.
   A recurring theme in the entries was that love was more
important than legal ties.
   The Springfield-based Mass Mutual Life Insurance Co. sponsored
the contest through its American Family Values Program. The winner
was announced earlier this month.
   The contest was advertised through Scholastic Magazine, a
publication for children. Entries ranged from ``the brightest and
most articulate to those who spoke from the heart,'' said Eva Dion,
the project's director.
   Entries were mainly from middle-class students, including some
who wrote as part of class projects, said Dr. Albert Solnit, senior
research scientist with the Yale Child Study Center and a contest
judge.
   ``It's important for people to realize that this was not an
effort to create an epidemiological sample, it was an effort to get
an articulate sample of what we might call the ideals in practice
in the United States,'' Solnit said.
   In many cases, students wrote to impress judges with the warmth
of their families. Solnit said the essays of about 170 finalists
showed how families handled adversity.
   A panel of judges winnowed the finalists for Solnit's review,
Ms. Dion said.
   ``We really were looking for something that we felt got to the
heart of what they considered a family,'' she said.
   Sticking together seemed to be true measure of family for many
contestants.
   ``Where do you go when your heart is broken?'' queried a
Portland, Ore., girl. ``The Family Doctor. Your mother, father,
sister even your brother no matter how rude weird or disgusting he
is.''

   An explosion damaged the passenger
terminal at the international airport in the Angolan capital of
Luanda on Thursday, but caused no casualties, Portuguese television
reported.
   It quoted Angolan government officials as saying the blast was
caused by a bomb planted by UNITA, the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola -the U.S.-backed rebel group fighting a
15-year-old civil war against Angola's leftist government.
   The explosion destroyed the VIP lounge, according to the
late-night report on state-run RTP network.
   UNITA officials are scheduled to meet a government delegation in
Portugal next month for peace talks. The two sides have met five
times this year under Portuguese mediation.
   The civil war has raged since Angola gained independence from
Portugal in 1975. According to Angolan government figures, it has
killed 350,000 people.

   Amnesty International said Thursday it has urged
Equatorial Guinea to release Antonio Ebang Mbele, a leading member
of that African country's parliament arrested for advocating
multiparty democracy.
   It said it received reports Mbele was under house arrest for
proposing that parliament debate introducing multiparty democracy
in the former Spanish colony.
   Mbele is vice president of the Chamber of People's
Representatives, the national assembly. He reportedly was stripped
of parliamentary privileges last month and placed under house
arrest in Micomeseng, his home village.
   Amnesty, a world human rights group with headquarters in London,
said 30 other people, including senior officials, have been
arrested since Dec. 6 for their political views. It sent a letter
Dec. 20 urging their release, the text of which was released
Thursday.
   It expressed concern over reports that some of those held were
ill-treated in custody.
   Equatorial Guinea, on the Atlantic coast between Gabon and
Cameroon, is ruled by the sole legal party, the Equatorial Guinea
Democratic Party, led by President Teodoro Obiang Nguema.

   An armed gang abducted and raped
teen-aged girls from a Salvation Army home in a Christmas attack,
news reports said Thursday.
   Salvation Army official June Dwyer said nine girls were abducted
and six of them raped by 16 attackers who broke into the Salvation
Army Girl's Home after midnight on Christmas, according to the
independent South African Press Association.
   The news agency quoted her as saying the attackers forced open a
rear security door to enter the building that housed 72 girls.
   ``They smashed the windows, damaged beds, took the presents we
had for the girls, destroyed clothes and abducted nine girls,'' it
quoted Ms. Dwyer as saying. ``Six of the girls were raped. All but
one of them made it back to the home by (Wednesday) night.''
   A police spokesman told the news agency the girls were raped
near a Soweto train station. Police launched a search for the
missing girl and the attackers, a local radio station reported.
   All the girls were moved from the home after the attack, media
reports said.

   About 2,000 Soviet Jews are arriving in Israel
daily, setting a record pace that could push the number of
immigrants from all countries to more than 200,000 this year,
officials and news reports said Thursday.
   On Thursday, 2,000 Soviet Jewish immigrants poured into Israel,
surpassing last weekend's high rate of 1,500 a day, said Yehuda
Weinrab, a spokesman for the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency. The
organization helps resettle immigrants.
   Israeli officials have attributed the surge this month to
increasing uncertainty about the political climate in the Soviet
Union and better Israeli-sponsored transportation arrangements.
   Israel army radio said the latest surge likely would push the
overall December immigration total to 35,000 and the year-end
figure to 205,000. The totals include Ethiopians and other
nationals, but Soviets make up about 90 percent.
   About 1 million Soviets are expected by the end of 1992. While
Israeli officials encourage the immigration, it is causing major
housing shortages and unemployment problems.

   A robber put a sizzling pipe bomb on a
bank counter Thursday, sending workers and customers running for
cover and fleeing with a bag of cash before the device exploded.
   The masked man walked into the bank with the lighted bomb in one
hand and a black gym bag in the other. He placed the pipe on a
counter and ordered a teller to, ``Fill it up,'' said police Capt.
Randy Johnson.
   The robber threw a second, simliar bomb at a customer who chased
him into the parking lot of the First Union National Bank branch.
That bomb also exploded but caused no damage.
   No one was injured in the holdup.
   The robber counted backward from 10 as the teller gave him the
money, then he fled. About 10 people in the bank ran out about 45
seconds before the bomb made of a 7- to 10-inch pipe exploded
inside, said Paul Daly, an FBI special agent.
   ``It sounded like thunder,'' said Brent Peters, a salesman at
Pep Boys Auto Parts next door. ``It got real quiet, then it
happened again.''
   The inside blast shattered a window and created a large hole in
the counter. Debris was strewn on the floor.
   Police said the robber ran behind the bank and through woods to
a white four-wheel drive vehicle. No arrests were made by late
Thursday.
   ``I saw all the bank employees running out of the bank and into
our store,'' said Beth Allen, manager of Camera World next to the
bank.
   ``They weren't screaming, but they were in a hurry to get
here,'' she said.
   The holdup was taped by bank surveillance cameras.

<TEXT>
   States have spent only about two-thirds of the
anti-drug money provided by the federal government in the past four
years, according to figures released Thursday by the Office of
National Drug Control Policy.
   Of the $5.0 billion given out through three major block grant
programs from the first quarter of 1987 through the third quarter
of 1990, only $3.4 billion, or 68 percent, has been distributed by
state and territorial governments to anti-drug programs, the
figures show.
   Even top-ranked Arizona had spent only 83.4 percent of the $77.7
million it had received. Ranked second was Nevada, which had spent
79 percent of $26.7 million, followed by the U.S. territories,
which had spent 77 percent of the $63.3 million they received.
   Coming in last was Puerto Rico, which had spent only 34.2
percent of the $31.7 million it had received. Next was Hawaii,
spending 52 percent of $27.4 million, and Wyoming, spending 55
percent of $14.1 million.
   ``I think what's bringing the spending level down is the law
enforcement grant, because there were such enormous increases in
that in the last two years,'' said Bruce Carnes, director of
planning, budget and administration for the drug control policy
office.
   Justice Department anti-drug block grants jumped from $119
million in fiscal year 1989 to $395 million last year. They rise to
$423 million this year.
   ``Some states have gone ahead and spent it pretty aggressively,
some haven't,'' he said.
   Grants distributed by Health and Human Services for drug
treatment and prevention are being spent at a much higher level -
82 percent - than those for education - 46 percent - and law
enforcement - 40 percent, Carnes said.
   Carnes said of the overall spending level: ``Obviously I'd like
to see it higher, but I'm not prepared to say they're not doing
their jobs.''
   However, he added, ``States that have low spendout rates, it
would be desirable for them to step sharply on this.''
   Hawaii's attorney general, Warren Price, said his state's fiscal
procedures made the spending percentage misleadingly low. Eighty
percent of the money is used by county prosecutors and police
departments, but those agencies do not spend the federal dollars
directly - they spend their own funds and later claim reimbursement
from the federal money, which makes it seem as if the federal
dollars are not being spent quickly, Price said.
   Though states and territorial governments have not distributed
as much of the grant money as the drug control policy office would
like, a report issued by the drug policy office Thursday said
giving the grants directly to cities would unnecessarily delay
delivery of the money to those who need it.
   The sum involved is substantial: $1.4 billion in the current
fiscal year, provided under three programs run by the departments
of Justice, Health and Human Services and Education. These grants
go to the states for disbursement. Other federal anti-drug grants
bring the total to $2.6 billion this year, or one-fourth of the
total budget for the war against drugs.
   The report said the time it takes the federal government to
distribute the money to the states has been reduced in the past few
years. For example, the federal government's review process dropped
from 46 days last year to 28 days this year.
   But cities complain they're not getting what they need to combat
the severe drug problems they face, and they have argued for direct
federal funding to local governments.
   The report, however, said that trying to speed up the process by
having direct federal funding of city programs would put a
tremendous burden on the federal government, which would have to
review thousands of applications from local governments. This would
sow the process considerably, the report said.
   Patrick V. Murphy, former New York City police commissioner who
now directs the U.S. Conference of Mayors' police policy board,
argued that the time lag isn't the point.
   ``The mayors feel that although the drug problem is being driven
by recreational users ... and many of them are in the suburbs, the
worst problems - the murder and violence among the kids who get
into the traffic and the delays for treatment for low-income people
who don't have health insurance - are in the cities,'' Murphy said.
   The drug control office's report acknowledges such criticisms
but asserts: ``States are closer to the problem than federal
administrators and can more quickly react to changes in local
requirements.''
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Select
Committee on Narcotics, said: ``The administration can claim credit
if it wants to for quickly dispatching these billions of dollars to
the states, but the fact is, they are not reaching the right
people.''

<TEXT>
   The Pentagon plans to begin vaccinating U.S.
troops in the Persian Gulf against possible germ warfare, according
to a published report.
   The New York Times reported in its Friday editions that senior
administration officials have recommended proceeding with the
inoculation program. The plan is part of an effort to protect
military personnel from biological weapons, including the use of
masks and other protective garments.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has repeatedly denied having
biological weapons although Iraq used chemical weapons against some
rebellious Kurds in its own country and against Iran during its war
with that country.
   Army Lt. Col. Steve Roy, a spokesman for the Department of
Defense, declined comment Thursday night about the report of
inoculations of Desert Shield troops.
   ``We wouldn't comment on anything that might be an operational
matter,'' he said.
   Administration officials told the Times the plan was prompted by
CIA reports that Iraq had stockpiled chemical and biological
weapons.
   The Times said it was unclear how many troops might be
vaccinated but said officials believe it will be those Americans
who are most likely to be threatened by biological weapons, such as
anthrax.
   Unlike chemical weapons, biological weapons are based on living
agents like viruses and bacteria. They can be used to spread
diseases like typhoid, cholera and bacteria.
   The Times said the inoculations could begin ``in a matter of
weeks.''

   The makers of three denture adhesives
recalled the products Thursday because traces of cancer-causing
benzene were detected, authorities said.
   The adhesives are Orafix Special, Brace and Cushion Grip.
   Richard Kessel, chairman of the state Consumer Protection Board,
said the agency found benzene in the adhesives after receiving a
tip from ``someone in the industry.''
   The adhesives pose no immediate health threat and the Food and
Drug Administration is testing all denture adhesives as a
precaution, Kessel said.
   The FDA encouraged consumers to stop using the three products
that were voluntarily recalled nationwide.
   ``While this is not believed to be an acute health hazard, it
could pose a danger to denture adhesive users over many years, the
FDA and state agree,'' Kessel said.
   Tests of Orafix Special showed it contained 191 parts of benzene
per million, the FDA said in a statement. Brace contained 190 ppm
and Cushion Grip contained 65 ppm.
   Benzene, a naturally occurring chemical used in solvents, was
also detected in Fasteeth at 29 parts per billion and Fixodent at
12 ppb.
   ``These benzene levels, although detectable in the laboratory,
are considered by the agency to present a negligible risk,'' the
FDA said.
   FDA officials consider any benzene exposure above 5 ppb to have
possible adverse health effects.
   No benzene was found in five other denture adhesives: Super Poli
Grip, Orafix Original, Effergrip, CVS and Confident.
   Smithkline Beecham Consumer Brands of Pittsburgh, Pa. recalled
Orafix Special and Brace. Cushion Grip was recalled by Plough Inc.
of Memphis, Tenn., a subsidiary of Schering-Plough Corp. of
Madison, N.J.
   Smithkline said in a statement that it recalled the two brands
``due to minute amounts of benzene in the products.''
   Schering-Plough spokesman Lewis Nowlan said the company
``believes the trace concentration do not pose a health hazard.
However, in accordance with long-standing corporate policy, the
company suspended all manufacturing of the product.''
   Benzene forced a recall this year for French mineral water giant
Perrier. The company withdrew 160 million bottles worldwide,
including 72 million bottles in the United States and Canada.
   Perrier officials said benzene entered their water in trace
amounts when workers failed to change a pipe filter at the
company's plant in southern France, where water from a natural
spring is mixed with naturally-occurring carbon dioxide gas.

   The nation grew to 249.6 million people in the
1980s as more Americans left the industrial and agricultural
heartlands for the South and West.
   The Census Bureau's first ``final'' figures from the 1990
census, released Wednesday, showed the pull of the Sun Belt
remained strong, despite efforts by the industrial North to promote
growth and the collapse during the 1980s of the oil and savings and
loan industries - two mainstays of the Southern and Western states.
   The census figures are used to adjust the number of
representatives each state sends to Congress so that political
clout is in line with population. The figures also determine the
division of federal money among states and localities.
   The numbers could change next summer when the Commerce
Department decides whether to adjust the count. Some states and
cities are likely to challenge the tallies, whichever way the
adjustment decision goes.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Most Americans have not planned for critical
medical decisions they some day may have no control over, but Nancy
Cruzan's ``right-to-die'' struggle made them more aware of their
options, experts say.
   The publicity surrounding Ms. Cruzan's case, said Doron Weber, a
spokesman for the Society for the Right to Die, ``generated a 500
percent increase in the requests we receive.''
   Weber said his New York-based organization has filled 800,000
requests for sample living wills and similar documents since the
Supreme Court's decision in the Cruzan case last June.
   ``The volume from all over the country, which we tracked
directly from the Cruzan case, was incredible. We had to start a
night shift,'' he said.

   LYON, France (AP) - For Garry Kasparov, it was the world chess
title and something more. It was the ultimate vindication of him
and his flamboyant style over the surgical precision of his
introspective rival, Anatoly Karpov.
   Kasparov defeated Karpov, a fellow Soviet, for the fourth time
in a world chess championship on Wednesday by playing him to a draw
in the 22nd game.
   The half point each player received put Kasparov ahead 12-10 and
let him retain the crown. He had won four games to Karpov's two.
The rest were draws.
   At age 22 in 1985, Kasparov won the title from Karpov to become
the youngest champion in history. He defended the crown by beating
Karpov in 1986 and 1987.

   VATICAN CITY (AP) - She sent Christopher Columbus on his voyage
and opened up the New World for the spread of Catholicism, but did
Queen Isabella I of Spain have the stuff of saints? Jews and
Moslems are outraged by the idea.
   The Vatican is studying a petition that supporters hope will put
the queen on the road to possible sainthood in time for 1992, when
the church plans to celebrate 500 years of Christianity in the
Americas.
   One of the most significant figures in Spanish history, Isabella
commissioned the voyage of Columbus in 1492 to the New World.
   Isabella is also remembered as the queen who expelled the Jews
and Moslems from Spain and for the dreaded Inquisition that began
during her rule with her husband, Ferdinand II.
   Samuel Toledano, head of the Federation of Spanish Jewish
Communities, calls Isabella ``a symbol of intolerance.'' The
Vatican petition, he said, ``would reopen old wounds that we
thought were closed forever.''

<TEXT>
   English writer Evelyn Waugh hated television.
He called it ``insufferable.''
   London Weekend Television adapted Waugh's classic novel
``Scoop'' for the small screen. British TV critics called it
``disappointing.''
   If you're a British journalist, there's plenty to be
disappointed about in this 1937 book that pillories the boozing,
lying and lazy meanderings of His Majesty's supposedly noble and
learned overseas press corps.
   But if you're not a British reporter, or if you actually know a
foreign correspondent, ``Scoop'' is hilarious. And right on the
mark.
   Americans will have a chance to see it Sunday on PBS'
``Masterpiece Theater,'' the 20-year-old epitome of good taste
hosted by Alistair Cooke.
   This version, made three years ago by London Weekend Television,
was roundly criticized when shown on British television for leaving
out some of the book's more biting anecdotes.
   The two-hour movie is a little long on spectacle, having been
filmed in London and Morocco and populated by long, wide sets
boasting staircases that rival the Tower of Babel.
   It is, however, far from shallow. Waugh's humor stings like gin
poured over a paper cut. In keeping with that, the British
television movie is true not only to the book's details, but to its
tone as well.
   It stars Donald Pleasence as Lord Copper, the megalomaniac
publisher of The Beast, owned by Megapolitan Newspaper Corp.;
Denholm Elliott as Salter, his fawning, felicitous foreign editor,
and Michael Maloney as William Boot, the dimwitted garden columnist
whose prose is so dense only a hand grenade can dislodge its
cumbersome sentences.
   How Boot is sent overseas as a foreign correspondent is such a
ridiculous instance of mistaken identity it qualifies as a Marx
Brothers routine. Trouble is, in the time in which ``Scoop'' is
set, such absurdities were only too possible.
   Written more than 50 years ago, Waugh's story skewers Fleet
Street's popular press and its warring newspaper correspondents who
invented quotes and even entire battles to titillate readers and
tweak competitors.
   Waugh knew of which he wrote. In 1935, as a correspondent for
London's Daily Mail, he covered Benito Mussolini's war with
Abyssinia (now Ethiopia). Waugh's journalistic credentials for this
foreign posting? He had previously visited Abyssinia.
   In ``Scoop,'' Boot is sent by The Beast to the make-believe
African country of Ishmaelia, where war has broken out. Boot
arrives, collapsible canoe and full Christmas dinner in hand, to
find a horde of tight-knit, whiskey-filled correspondents. No one,
however, can find the war.
   They don't call it pack journalism for nothing.
   Former Waugh colleagues have recently written that ``Scoop's''
portrayals are infinitely closer to fact than fiction.
   During the Abyssinian war, one British journalist came equipped
with a camel. When his paper questioned the purchase submitted on
his expense account, the intrepid correspondent cabled back ``Glad
you reminded me - cremation of one camel, 10 pounds.''
   Waugh himself, despite his sense of humor and the absurd, was
anything but a happy soul. He abhorred television and driving. He
loved to drink. Shortly before his death in 1966 at age 62, he
described his daily routine thusly:
   ``I get up late. I try to read my letters. I try to read the
paper. I have some gin. I try to read the paper again. I have some
more gin.''
   He hung out with Oxford grads in a men's club that included
Graham Greene, Anthony Powell, Cyril Connolly, Harold Acton and
John Betjeman.
   ``Masterpiece Theater'' has had good luck with Waugh's works.
Its adaptation of Waugh's ``Brideshead Revisted'' was a programming
milestone.
   ``Scoop,'' despite bad reviews from its British debut, is well
worth the attention of American viewers - if for no other reason
than its delivery of things not frequently seen on the U.S. telly:
   Very witty dialogue and a script that provokes thought.

<HEAD>Mega-Musical Producer Offers One Hit ``Moe''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cameron Mackintosh, Britain's leading producer of
the mega-musical, has an unexpected hit in a small-scale production
that leaves its audience shouting for ``Moe.''
   ``It's a marvelous accident; the pieces fell in together,''
Mackintosh said of ``Five Guys Named Moe.'' The musical revue of
American jazzman Louis Jordan opened Dec. 14 at the Lyric Theater.
   Its West End arrival follows a sellout run at the ``fringe''
Theater Royal, Stratford East, in east London. Mackintosh saw the
show there in October and decided during the intermission to fund a
commercial transfer.
   ``I literally went for a fun night out at the theater; I was
bowled over,'' the producer recalled in an interview, before
hopping a plane to Madrid to tend to that city's staging of ``Les
Miserables.''
   The most successful producer in the theater today, the
44-year-old Mackintosh, has ``Cats,'' ``Les Miserables'' and ``The
Phantom of the Opera'' running in London, on Broadway and around
the world. His current London smash ``Miss Saigon'' opens April 11
in New York, where the advance sale exceeds $31 million.
   ``Five Guys Named Moe'' has a budget of about $770,000, less
than two weeks running costs for ``Phantom of the Opera'' on
Broadway.
   ``In the end, I never get hooked on scale,'' Mackintosh said.
``I do a show because I like it.''
   Others like it, too. Kate Kellaway in The Observer said this
``tremendous show comes closer to a party than anything I have seen
on stage before.'' If attendance continues at present capacity
levels, the show will recoup in 10-12 weeks, Mackintosh said.
   The show pays exuberant tribute to Jordan, the alto saxophonist
who died in 1975 at the age of 66. Its two hours of calypso, swing
and bebop embrace such songs as ``There Ain't Nobody Here But Us
Chickens,'' ``Messy Bessy,'' ``Saturday Night Fish Fry'' and the
title song.
   The audience chimes in, too, joining the cast in a conga line
and singing to the words ``push ka pi shi pie - eh eh'' printed on
pieces of paper which the ushers distribute.
   The six singer-dancers - three Britons and three Ameicans -
include the musical's creator, Clarke Peters, an American based in
London on and off since 1973. The director-choreographer is fellow
American Charles Augins.
   Peters has had his share of previous successes, starring in the
London companies of ``Driving Miss Daisy'' and August Wilson's ``Ma
Rainey's Black Bottom.''
   The 38-year-old Peters is reaping the benefits of five years
work on ``Five Guys,'' which began when he was appearing in
``Carmen Jones'' in 1985 at the Crucible Theater in Sheffield,
south Yorkshire.
   ``We were doing an evening of good company, and I had this idea
of five guys coming out of this guy's bed just as he was about to
crash out after a depressing evening with his lady,'' Peter said.
   In the current version, Nomax (Dig Wayne) is a depressed radio
deejay taken by surprise early one morning when five song-and-dance
men leap out of his radio to offer advice to the lovelorn of the
most rollicking and bluesy sort.
   Mackintosh said the musical found ``exactly the right weight:
It's not a compilation show, but it's not striving to be a
biopic.''
   ``It treads that line so wonderfully cleverly,'' he said.
   ``Five Guys Named Moe'' is rare for Mackintosh in that he tends
to produce his musicals from scratch, spending years getting them
in shape. In November, he opened another small musical, ``Just
So,'' at northwest London's Tricycle Theater, where it runs through
Jan. 12.
   Has ``Five Guys'' put him in the market for other shows, once
``Miss Saigon'' is up and running on Broadway?
   ``Absolutely not,'' Mackintosh said. ``Look, this is a very
extraordinary circumstance; this sort of show doesn't happen very
often.''
   And what about the future of ``Five Guys''?
   ``I think this is a Broadway show myself,'' he said. ``It will
be a nice problem to worry about whilst I'm hopefully in New York
with `Saigon.'''

<HEAD>New Freedom To Worship in Eastern Europe Top Religion Story</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wave of religious freedom sweeping over
Eastern Europe and the efforts of Western religious groups to bring
the church in from the cold was the top religion news story of
1990, according to a poll.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, who won the 1990 Nobel Peace
Prize for his role in introducing democratic changes in Eastern
Europe and easing East-West conflicts, also was selected as
religion newsmaker of the year for the second year in a row in the
voting by 45 members of the Religion Newswriters Association.
Evangelist Billy Graham finished second.
   In the Soviet Union, official tolerance for religion has
increased greatly since Gorbachev came to power in 1985. In the
last two years, many churches have been reconsecrated and Soviet
citizens have flocked to services in record numbers.
   The Soviet legislature this fall approved a freedom of
conscience bill promised by Gorbachev when he met with Pope John
Paul II at the Vatican last December. The law forbids the
government from interfering in the practice of religion, formally
ending decades of repression.
   With the door to evangelism opened, many Western churches are
sponsoring missionary efforts in Eastern Europe, bringing in
teachers, preachers, equipment, building funds and Bibles.
Organizations from the United Methodist Church to the Southern
Baptist Convention have planned projects in Eastern Europe.
   U.S. Roman Catholic bishops have established a special committee
on ways to aid Eastern Europe, and Jewish groups concerned about
the dangers of a renewal of anti-Semitism have jumped in to help
long-dormant churches realize the fruits of decades of ecumenical
advances in the West.
   Sex scandals took second place in the poll. Roman Catholic
Archbishop Eugene A. Marino resigned July 10 after revelations of
an ``intimate relationship'' with a young woman, and the Rev. Allen
Boesak resigned Aug. 10 as president of the World Alliance of
Reformed Churches after admitting an extramarital affair with a
married television producer. The Rev. Bruce Ritter left the
Covenant House organization he founded amid accusations by male
youths of sexual affairs. He has denied wrongdoing.
   The continuing conflict in the nation's largest Protestant
denomination, the Southern Baptist Convention, ranked third.
Conservatives elected a fundamentalist to the presidency and fired
the two top editors of the denomination's press service, and
moderates withheld some funds from convention agencies.
   In fourth place was the suspension of two Lutheran congregations
in San Francisco by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America for
ordaining and installing acknowledged homosexuals. Presiding
Episcopal Bishop Edmond L. Browning reprimanded Bishop John Spong
of Newark, N.J., for ordaining a declared homosexual, the Rev.
Robert Williams. Spong later suspended Williams for making public
remarks disparaging monogamy and the celibacy of Mother Teresa.
   A historic conference of South African black and white churches
condemning the policy of racial separation known as apartheid
ranked fifth. Anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela, released from
prison Feb. 11, received financial and moral support from U.S.
religious leaders on a summer tour.
   A Supreme Court ruling upholding the denial of unemployment
benefits to two drug counselors fired for using peyote, an illegal,
hallucinogenic drug, in an American Indian religious ceremony
ranked sixth. Religious leaders expressed concern the ruling
overturned past precedent that the governent must show a
``compelling state interest'' to force compliance with a law that
conflicts with a religious practice.
   In seventh place was the efforts of U.S. religious leaders to
urge non-military solutions to the Persian Gulf crisis. The
National Council of Churches has urged the administration to halt
its military buildup in the Persian Gulf and begin withdrawing
troops, and the National Conference of Catholic Bishops has
repeatedly expressed reservations about the possibility of a U.S.
offensive.
   The assassination of Rabbi Meir Kahane, an anti-Arab militant,
ranked eighth. Many considered Kahane a bigot and a demagogue for
calling Arabs dogs and advocating their expulsion from Israel, but
some considered him a freedom fighter determined to avoid another
Holocaust.
   In ninth place were Catholic guidelines on theologians and
church-affiliated universities. The Congregation for the Doctrine
of the Faith ordered theologians to refrain from publicly
challenging church teaching, and Pope John Paul instructed Catholic
universities to uphold official doctrine but rejected a proposal to
give bishops wide powers over the schools.
   The decision by U.S. Catholic bishops to hire a public relations
firm to oppose abortion rounded out the top 10. Some groups
favoring legalized abortion criticized the decision as being
politically motivated and a waste of money, but church leaders
defended the decision.
   ``We believe that the most critical issue in the United States
is the problem of abortion, and if we believe that, then we should
try to use the best possible means to communicate,'' Cardinal John
J. O'Connor of New York said.

   A booklet issued by the American Jewish
Committee contends that a ``new activism'' by pro-Palestinians
within Christian churches seeks to undermine sympathy for Israel
and is putting Israel at risk.
   Advocacy in the churches of Palestinian Arab political goals has
taken an increasingly anti-Israel tilt ``in that failure to achieve
either peace or stability in the Middle East is laid almost
entirely at Israel's door,'' the booklet says.
   Called ``Israel at Risk, the Campaign to Erode Christian
Support,'' the booklet says the anti-Israel campaign ``projects a
negative and hostile view of Israel's motives, combined with a
frequently uncritical endorsement of Palestinian claims.''

   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) - A United Methodist bishop says the next
missionary challenge for U.S. Christians is not overseas, but among
teen-agers and young adults in American communities.
   Bishop Leroy C. Hodapp of Indianapolis, president of the
denomination's 100-member Council of Bishops, attributed the
church's membership decline in recent years to its failure to
involve the young.
   Unless it finds ways to do so, the denomination could ``die in
one generation,'' he said at a news conference.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Gillian Martin Sorensen, who from 1978 until
this year served as the city's liaison officer with foreign
diplomats posted in New York, has been elected president of the
National Conference of Christians and Jews.
   She succeeds Jacqueline Greenan Wexler, who headed the
organization for eight years in its work to promote religious,
racial and ethnic harmony in American society.

   LYNCHBURG, Va. (AP) - Lutheran, Episcopal and Roman Catholic
bishops in Virginia have entered into a covenant billed as one of
the closest such working partnerships in the country.
   The agreement was signed by bishops and 160 other
representatives at the close of the state's annual LARC (Lutheran,
Anglican, Roman Catholic) Conference.
   Bishops of the three denominations committed themselves to
various programs and actions to strengthen unity, ranging from
praying for each other to developing cooperation in institutions,
chaplaincies and campus ministries to working together in
evangelism and social justice.
   In a related move in Minnesota, a Lutheran-Catholic covenant was
signed between Catholic Archbishop John R. Roach of St.
Paul-Minneapolis and bishops of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America in those two cities.
   This was believed to be the second Lutheran-Catholic covenant,
an earlier one being signed in Chicago. Catholics and Lutherans are
reported working toward such accords in North Carolina and New
England.

<TEXT>
   MISSISSIPPI: The call-up of Mississippi National Guardsmen and
reservists as a result of Operation Desert Shield. Nearly every
community, large and small, across the state was affected as 50
units were activated for military service.
   MISSOURI: The earthquake that didn't happen. Climatologist Iben
Browning shook up people living along the New Madrid fault in
southeastern Missouri and nearby states when he said there was a 50
percent chance of a major earthquake on or about Dec. 3. The
comment caused school closings and prompted some people to leave
their homes temporarily.
   MONTANA: Violence on college campuses. On May 15, two freshmen
at Montana State University were killed in their dormitory with a
shotgun. Police said another freshman apparently believed the pair
had vandalized his truck. Three days later, a man shot at a group
of Carroll College employees, killing one and wounding another.
Police said the man offered no motive.
   NEBRASKA: Democrat Ben Nelson's narrow election as governor over
Republican incumbent Kay Orr. Nelson, a lawyer, had to wait 48 days
after the May primary before being declared winner of the
Democratic nomination by 42 votes. He defeated Orr in November by
about 4,000 votes.
   NEVADA: A compromise agreement in Congress on allocating water
from Lake Tahoe and the Truckee and Carson rivers. The deal sets
shares for the states of California and Nevada and the cities,
utilities, farmers and Indian tribes in Nevada who have dueled over
water rights for more than 80 years.
   NEW HAMPSHIRE: The woes of New Hampshire's once-thriving
economy, battered lately by a slumping real estate market and by
layoffs at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and the state capital. The
state ranks first in growth of welfare cases and bankruptcy
filings, and second in business failures.
   NEW JERSEY: Gov. Jim Florio's $2.8 billion tax package and
school finance reform program. Florio pushed the program through
the Legislature in June, touching off a storm among voters already
distressed about high property taxes and a weakening economy.
   NEW MEXICO: The disappearance of a 6-year-old Clovis boy in May
and the discovery of his body about two weeks later in a storage
compartment of a station wagon in the family driveway. The search
for Matthew Roberts drew up to 8,000 volunteers in a community of
about 35,000. The asphyxiation death was ruled accidental.
   NORTH CAROLINA: Republican Jesse Helms' re-election to the U.S.
Senate in a campaign marked by charges of racism. Television ads
for Helms in the final week of the campaign tied the Democratic
challenger, Harvey Gantt, to racial quotas for hiring, a charge
Gantt vehemently denied.
   OKLAHOMA: The state's hotly debated education reform and tax
package. The law includes $223 million in new taxes and teacher pay
raises, school consolidation and a plan to close schools not
meeting certain accreditation requirements.
   OREGON: Protections for the northern spotted owl and the impact
on logging. The federal government put the bird on the threatened
species list in June, forcing a cutback in logging to preserve the
owl's habitat. Mills across Oregon shut down as they were caught in
a squeeze between a national downturn in construction and high
prices for raw materials.
   PENNSYLVANIA: Passage of the nation's most stringent abortion
control law. In August, a federal judge threw out key provisions of
the law, including notification of the father before an abortion
could be performed, a 24-hour waiting period and parental
permission for minors.
   RHODE ISLAND: A listless economy that deteriorated into
recession. Rhode Island's real estate industry collapsed and
problems spread to overextended banks. The economy also was hit by
layoffs at the state's largest private employer, the Electric Boat
division of General Dynamics Corp.
   SOUTH CAROLINA: Bribery and corruption at the Statehouse. The
scandal broke in July when the FBI subpoenaed campaign records of
all 170 legislators. Ten legislators and one lobbyist were
indicted. Seven have pleaded guilty and one was convicted at trial;
three await a trial.
   SOUTH DAKOTA: The activation of almost 1,000 South Dakota
National Guard and reserve members because of Operation Desert
Shield. As the year's end neared, two Guard and one Army Reserve
unit were on duty in the Persian Gulf and five units were at U.S.
camps awaiting further assignment.
   TENNESSEE: The call-up of Tennessee National Guardsmen and other
military reservists to bolster the U.S. military preparations for
Operation Desert Shield. Approximately 3,000 Tennessee residents
were called to service.
   TEXAS: A long and loud gubernatorial campaign. Democrat Ann
Richards overcame a 15-point deficit in the polls six weeks before
the election and upset gaffe-prone millionaire Clayton Williams in
a contest of big spending and mudslinging.
   UTAH: The role of Utah National Guard and reserve units in the
U.S. buildup for Operation Desert Shield. Some Utah hospitals were
left shorthanded when the Guard's 114th Evacuation Hospital and the
Army Reserve's 328th General Hospital were activated.
   VERMONT: The election of socialist independent Bernard Sanders
to the U.S. House. Sanders rode a wave of discontent with Congress
to oust first-term incumbent Peter Smith, a Republican. He will be
the only member of Congress not affiliated with the Republican or
Democratic caucuses.
   VIRGINIA: The inauguration of Gov. L. Douglas Wilder. The
Democratic official made history when he took the oath of office on
Jan. 13 as the nation's first elected black governor.
   WASHINGTON: Problems in the timber industry. Loggers were hit by
habtitat protections for the northern spotted owl and by a
congressional ban on exporting logs from government forests. Timber
product sales also slowed from the national downturn in
construction.
   WEST VIRGINIA: The imprisonment of former Gov. Arch A. Moore Jr.
Fifteen months after losing a re-election bid, the Republican who
dominated politics in a largely Democratic state pleaded guilty May
8 to extortion, obstruction of justice, mail fraud and two counts
of tax fraud.
   WISCONSIN: The Lawrencia Bembenek case. The 32-year-old former
Playboy club waitress and policewoman became a folk hero after her
July escape from prison, where she was serving a life sentence for
the 1981 killing of her husband's ex-wife. She and her lover were
captured in Canada in October.
   WYOMING: The latest delay in the execution of Mark Hopkinson for
murder. On death row since 1979, Hopkinson, who maintains his
innocence, came within two days of being executed in September when
a federal judge stayed the execution so he could consider defense
motions challenging the sentence.

<HEAD>Reflecting On the Big Economic Expansion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In its early years it was robust, but by the
mid-1980s it was bogging down in excesses and inconsistencies, and
for the past few years it has just been stumbling along.
   Now it is over, the great economic expansion that began in the
fall of 1982, the longest since the end of World War II, and by
some measures the mightiest ever generated.
   There are those who disagree about that, of course, and they
have good reasons. Federal budget deficits are uncontrolled. Debt,
much of it never to be repaid, permeates and undermines the
foundation.
   Those weaknesses are obvious. Less evident are defects that
emerge only after scrutiny, such as that real earnings of workers
in the non-farm economy have declined for most of the past 20
years. It's seldom referred to.
   Perhaps the most fundamental defects of all, the violations of
old standards and the corruption of values, rate very little
attention. But they are there, right at the base of most of the
problems.
   Volumes are written about fixing up the system, but will it do
much good if the same wild breaches of business decorum erupt
again? Such as:
   - So-called victimless, white-collar securities crimes. One
defense of convicted inside traders, stock manipulators and other
securities law violators of the 1980s is that their crimes caused
no deaths. Maybe not, but they caused lost jobs and distressed
companies.
   - Bankers who made loans of other people's money to borrowers
they knew were reckless and undeserving. They placed billions of
dollars at risk, sometimes while turning down more deserving, more
productive corporate citizens.
   Those were so-called business decisions, and so long as the
letter of the law, if not its spirit, was observed, nobody will go
to jail. Some perpetrators will escape without even a tarnished
reputation. Some might get bonuses.
   - Members of corporate boards of directors who didn't do their
jobs. The director's job is to protect interests of the
shareholders, to be their agent, and to see that the company is
properly run in their interest.
   Clearly, hundreds of boards failed in this reponsibility. Some
directors didn't know what was going on, some didn't care, and
judging by events, some appear to have acquiesced in activities
they should have prevented.
   One of the most common violations of trust involved repeated
raises to managers who failed to handle their duties properly. Some
directors, for example, agreed to bonuses for inferior performance.
   - Executives who lived off their companies rather than
contributed to them, seemingly more interested in perks than
profits.
   - The departure from old standards that caused people we like to
consider most astute to make the most stupendous blunders. Who made
those blunders? Bankers, brokers, attorneys, accountants, members
of Congress.
   - The Congress, which repeatedly told America it was cutting
spending, but which raised spending and deficits to levels that a
decade ago would have been incomprehensible, by quietly seeking and
getting funds for pet projects.
   The list could go on. Almost anyone can make a different one,
but they can demonstrate the same point: Yes, there was an erosion
of standards and values during the great expansion of the past
eight years, and it too has to be fixed.

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For Stan Edmister, bridges are a canvas. Where
an engineer sees a mass of concrete and steel, he sees a potential
masterpiece.
   ``If paint is going to be put on a bridge to sustain its life,
why should it be brown or gray or pastel green, when it could be a
lively combination of colors?'' says the 51-year-old artist.
   Two years ago, Edmister won a $10,000 grant from the National
Endowment for the Arts to design a color scheme for the Guilford
Avenue bridge in Baltimore. The result was so pleasing, one NEA
official said, that Edmister was awarded a second $10,000 grant to
select colors for 15 other bridges that cross Interstate 83.
   As the bridges are rehabilitated, they will be painted according
to Edmister's design.
   Jeff Soule, special project manager at the NEA in Washington,
said the award committee hopes Edmister's work will spur other
cities to treat their public works as art.
   ``We felt it would be a national model in improving the
appearance of ordinary structural elements in the urban
environment. It is a very, very pragmatic application of art. It
elevates public works and at the same time, it makes art
accessible,'' Soule said.
   He's uncomfortable with muted hues that allow behemoths to
settle anonymously into the background. So he experiments with
vibrant greens, yellows, oranges and foil appliques that change
color.
   He selects colors to highlight the design of a bridge and its
setting, he says.
   He wants to treat the bridges over Interstate 83 as a continuum
- related, yet each with its own temperament.
   ``Driving under and through the city, there is a series of
tunnel arches or bridge covers that sets up a natural rhythm. There
should be some sort of color theme uniting them, but there should
not be a bland blanket similarity from one to another,'' he said.
   The arches of the Guilford Avenue bridge are bright green, gray
and henna. Vertical yellow bands link arch to deck. Girders on the
underside are green and yellow. Iridescent green stripes along the
bridge's gray fence appear to change color when the sun strikes
them.
   The painting was part of a $3.8 million bridge rehabilitation.
City officials say they don't know whether the special treatment
cost more than if a single color had been used. Harry McCullough,
chief of Baltimore's interstate bridge division, said the city
sought just one contract and didn't seek a comparison bid.
   The cost of cleaning and painting the bridge was $137,000, well
below the engineer's estimate of $210,000, he said.
   The federal government provided 85 percent of the rehabilitation
money. Porter Barrows, division administrator of the Federal
Highway Administration in Maryland, said the government allowed the
special painting after determining the additional cost would be
minimal.
   ``I don't want to say that the cost isn't important, because it
is,'' he said. ``But we felt the proposal was legitimate and
interesting. It resulted in some interesting comments, I think.''
   The federal government must approve Edmister's colors, which
include the vibrant green used for road signs and the bright yellow
used for center lines. Foils must be used in moderation. The
government toned down Edmister's initial idea for the Guilford
Avenue bridge, fearing it would be too distracting to motorists.
   Not everyone approves of his concepts, Edmister said, although
the Guilford bridge has converted some skeptics.
   ``I remember a few engineers who said they disliked an artist
tampering in their arena and certainly didn't like a carnival-like
color scheme being used,'' he said. ``Now that the bridge is done,
and the newness is starting to settle in, or the familiarity is
becoming apparent, these same engineers are accepting it.''

<TEXT>
   On the stage where one expects the great plays of
Shakespeare, Chekhov and Arthur Miller, audiences instead are
finding a mole, a rat, a badger and a toad.
   ``The Wind in the Willows,'' adapted by Alan Bennett from the
much-loved Kenneth Grahame book, has provided the National Theater
with the kind of smash usually associated with big West End
musicals.
   Set alongside Grahame's famous River Bank, the play charts the
burgeoning friendships of four variously furry and scaly creatures
whose lessons for humanity are clear. Toad, the mansion-owning
braggart, learns modesty, even as Rat and Mole cross social and
class barriers to strike up an enduring friendship.
   The play ends with a garden party celebrating the best traits of
Englishness: restraint, humility and gentility which the characters
collectively embody.
   The show, which opened Dec. 12 in the theaterhis
country has, according to figures put together by an American
economist. Slug AM-US Competitiveness.

   Hard-fought election campaigns, statehouse scandals and other
political developments were the top stories in many states in 1990,
according to polls of Associated Press newpaper editors and
broadcast journalists.
   In several states, the call-up of military reservists as a
result of Operation Desert Shield was voted the top story.
   Here is a look at the top story in the 43 states where the AP
polled editors about a state's important news in 1990:
   
   ALABAMA: The Alabama National Guard's leading role in the
Persian Gulf callup. Guard officials say more guardsmen were called
into service from Alabama than from any other state following
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. Some 4,600 men and women were
activated from Alabama's Army and Air National Guard, and the
Pentagon also called up 884 from the Army Reserve and 400 from the
Marine and Navy reserves.
   ALASKA: Wally Hickel's political comeback to the governor's
mansion on a third-party ticket almost a quarter-century after he
first served there. Hickel jumped into the race in September,
upsetting the Republican Party by pulling Jack Coghill, then the
GOP candidate for lieutenant governor, onto his Alaskan
Independence Party ticket.
   ARIZONA: The Senate Ethics Committee investigation of Arizona's
two U.S. senators, John McCain and Dennis DeConcini, and the rest
of the ``Keating Five.'' It was the second straight year that the
saga of Charles Keating Jr.'s crumbling financial empire topped the
news in Arizona.
   ARKANSAS: Attorney General Steve Clark's conviction on charges
related to use of his state credit card to wine and dine friends,
girlfriends, political supporters and family. Clark, who was fined
$10,000 and resigned his office, is appealing the verdict. He had
been considered the top candidate for governor when 1990 began, but
he was forced to quit the race.
   CALIFORNIA: Republican Pete Wilson's victory in the governor's
race against Democrat Dianne Feinstein, who was the state's first
major female contender for the job. The campaign was the most
expensive state race in the nation's history, ultimately totaling
nearly $50 million for all candidates in the primary and general
elections.
   COLORADO: A tornado that devastated the farming community of
Limon the night of June 6. The tornado tore an S-shape path through
the community of 1,800, destroying 117 homes and 23 businesses and
causing $12.4 million in damage. More than 150 people were left
homeless, but the town was spared any deaths or serious injuries.
   FLORIDA: The grisly murders of five college students in
Gainesville. The slayings of four women and a young man at the
beginning of the school year terrorized the university town. No
killer has been caught.
   IDAHO: The fight over abortion. Legislators passed what would
have been the nation's most restrictive abortion law in March, but
Gov. Cecil Andrus vetoed it a half-hour after the Legislature
adjourned. In the November election, two pro-choice Democrats
defeated two incumbent anti-abortion Republicans to throw the
Senate into a 21-21 tie.
   ILLINOIS: The activation of Illinois National Guard and Army
reserve units for Operation Desert Shield. Most of the hundreds of
men and women called went willingly, including Air Force Reserve
Sgt. Lorain Kuryla, 63, whose grandchildren called her ``Grambo.''
More publicized was the case of Spec. 4 Stephanie Atkinson, 23, who
refused to join her unit, saying she had become a conscientious
objector. She was arrested and later discharged ``under other than
honorable conditions.''
   INDIANA: The story of a child ripped from his mother's arms by
fierce winds and killed as 20 tornadoes killed 10 people in
southern Indiana in June. Hardest hit was Petersburg, a community
of 3,000 people where six died and about two-thirds of the town's
buildings were destroyed or severely damaged just two weeks after a
flood.
   IOWA: The re-election of Gov. Terry Branstad and Sen. Tom
Harkin, both of whom had begun the year facing what appeared to be
strong challenges. Brandstad, a Republican, easily beat House
Speaker Don Avenson, while Harkin, a Democrat, defeated Rep. Tom
Tauke in a race that cost the candidates $11 million - the most
ever in an Iowa election campaign.
   KANSAS: The upset victory in the governor's race by Joan Finney,
the state treasurer who will become Kansas' first woman governor.
She beat former Gov. John Carlin in the Democratic primary and then
defeated Gov. Mike Hayden in the general election.
   KENTUCKY: The revamping of Kentucky's public school system, in
response to a state Supreme Court ruling that the previous system
was unconstitutional. The reform law set more equitable financing
for school districts and created teacher-parent councils to set
curricula and make other local decisions. A $1.3 billion tax
increase, biggest in state history, was passed to help finance the
reforms.
   LOUISIANA: The second-place finish of David Duke in the U.S.
Senate race. Duke, a Republican state representative whom state and
national party leaders repeatedly repudiated because of his past
connections with the Ku Klux Klan and American Nazi Party, got 44
percent of the vote in a four-man race against incumbent Democrat
Bennett Johnston, who got 54 percent.
   MAINE: The acquittal of a deer hunter who accidentally killed a
woman in woods behind her suburban home. The case of Donald
Rogerson, charged with manslaughter in the 1988 death of Karen
Wood, focused unprecedented attention on the rights of hunters and
non-hunters as the state's fields and woods give way to housin
subdivisions.
   MASSACHUSETTS: The public unraveling of the Stuart murder case
after Charles Stuart's fatal plunge from a bridge Jan. 4. Stuart
received nationwide publicity after telling police a black mugger
kidnapped, robbed and shot him and his wife, Carol. The truth did
not become known until Stuart was implicated Jan. 3 by his brother
in the fatal shooting of his wife, and he apparently committed
suicide the next day.
   MICHIGAN: Republican state Sen. John Engler's upset victory in
the governor's race with two-term, Democratic incumbent James
Blanchard. Blanchard was hit with negative publicity when he
dropped his two-term running mate, Martha Griffiths, from the
ticket, saying she was too old.
   MINNESOTA: The turbulent gubernatorial campaign that ended with
the election of late-comer Arne Carlson. Jon Grunseth had defeated
Carlson in the Republican primary, but Grunseth was forced to
withdraw from the race nine days before the election after
allegations of sexual impropriety. Carlson was named the new
nominee and defeated three-term Democratic incumbent Rudy Perpich.
   MINNESOTA: The turbulent gubernatorial campaign that ended with

Carlson in the Republican primary, but Grunseth was forced to
withdraw from the race nine days before the election after
allegations of sexual impropriety. Carlson was named the new

<HEAD>You Probably Recognize the Voice, But Not the Person Behind It</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By JAMES O. CLIFFORD</BYLINE>

   Joan Kenley sometimes talks to herself,
but that's understandable. After all, millions of people listen to
her.
   Among other things, Kenley is the ubiquitous voice of Voice
Mail, Pacific Bell's computerized answering service that more
businesses are turning to instead of human operators.
   She might also tell you how much to drop in a pay phone.
   When you pick up the phone at a hotel, Kenley could be on the
other end. She's the voice of Guest Messenger, a Sheraton Hotel
chain service similar to Voice Mail. Or you might hear her rattling
off the prices at computerized grocery store checkout counters.
   ``I guess I have made hundreds of thousands of them,'' said
Kenley, whose voice is becoming familiar to even more people.
PacBell in October brought the Voice Mail service to home phones
under the name ``The Message Center.''
   ``I'm even the English-speaking voice on pay phones in Japan,''
said Kenley, who is also the voice on software designer Northern
Telecom's Meridian Mail and the interstate long distance voice for
several companies, including Michigan and Ohio Bell.
   ``I think people who work with my voice would be sick of it, but
they actually love it,'' said Kenley, who lives in Oakland.
   One reason her voice is so popular is that the melody ``tends
not to go away'' and so allows sound technicians to mix old tapes
with new ones, Kenley said in an interview.
   If there is a criticism of her voice, it's that ``it's too
real.''
   ``People can easily start talking to it, but that's a compliment
as well.''
   She even does it herself.
   Kenley said she was checking into a hotel recently ``and when I
picked up the house phone I ended up talking to myself. It's kind
of spooky.''
   Kenley has done price-voicing for 50 grocery store chains. The
automated service sounds out the cost of an item when it is passed
over the checkout machine.
   ``My uncle in Cleveland was leaving a checkout where I say
`thank you' and he answered, `You're welcome, Joan,''' she said.
   Kenley's career includes voice coaching and acting, with guest
parts in shows that have ranged from ``The Honeymooners'' to a
revival of ``Call Me Madam'' with Ethel Merman.
   She is also a voice-over artist who has narrated ads for several
leading corporations, including Coca-Cola Co. and General Motors
Corp.'s Chevrolet division.
   But don't get the idea that Kenley is just another pretty voice.
   She earned a Ph.D in psychology and is the author of ``Voice
Power,'' an $18.95 hardcover described by the publisher, Aslan
Publishing of Boulder Creek, Calif., as ``a breakthrough method to
enhance your speaking voice.''
   Kenley said her big break came 10 years ago when she was
contacted by University of California professor Forrest Mozer, who
developed a way to put the human voice on a computer chip. Mozer
felt the best way for humans to ``interface'' with computers would
be vocally.
   ``He said he wanted a voice that was warm, but not too sexy,''
Kenley recalled. ``Now my voice is everywhere - elevators,
airplanes, even talking alarm clocks.''
   National Semiconductor Corp., a computer electronics company
that pioneered the talking checkout counter, had high standards for
its device.
   ``They wanted a voice that wasn't too perky or too saccharine or
too monotonous,'' Kenley said. ``They didn't want a voice that was
threatening, or that clerks would go crazy listening to.''
   Kenley says her work is ``a kind of immortality.''
   ``A hundred years from now, I'll be long gone. But my voice will
still be going out into the stratosphere saying, `Two dollars and
fifty cents, please.'''

<HEAD>War or Peace? That's What Waits for Congress on Thursday</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the new Congress convening on Thursday,
the questions of peace and war are waiting, with added urgency as
the days dwindle toward the Jan. 15 for Iraqi withdrawal from
Kuwait.
   Five months of intermittent debate and a dozen House and Senate
hearings have produced no answers and scant guidance to define the
role of the Democratic Congress in a crisis under Republican
management.
   At this point, it's a crisis on hold for the holidays.
   At a quiet Capitol, recorded telephone messages report some
offices closed until after the New Year. President Bush is at Camp
David, Md., on an 11-day break.
   There's little traffic and less tension in the capital, even as
reinforcements are deployed in the Persian Gulf and the Saudi
Arabian desert, building to the troop strength that could deliver
on the U.S. threat to take the offensive after mid-January. That's
when the United Nations has authorized the use of force if
necessary.
   According to the Democratic leaders of Congress, U.S. forces
cannot be sent to fight without congressional approval. According
to the Republican administration, Bush already has all the
authority he needs to act.
   That debate will resume when Congress does. It won't be
conclusive. The answer has been elusive for two centuries under a
constitutional system that makes the president the commander in
chief and empowers only Congress to declare war.
   There were demands during the fall that Congress be summoned
back to declare war. There were calls for a resolution of approval
for Bush's policy of threatening military action against Iraqi
occupation of Kuwait. There were proposals to invoke the creaky
machinery of the war powers system, under which a president can't
send troops into danger unless Congress approves.
   None of that happened, and none of it is likely to happen now.
   But in one form or another, the 102nd Congress is going to have
to come to clear, majority decisions on the Persian Gulf, possibly
but not necessarily on direct questions of policy, certainly on the
money and manpower to back up that policy.
   The administration will need a supplemental appropriation of up
to $20 billion early this year to finance Operation Desert Shield.
Call-up authority for some support units summoned to active duty
will begin expiring in March unless Congress extends it or Bush
declares a national emergency.
   And there may have to be action later in the year to change the
timetable for cutbacks that are supposed to reduce active duty
military forces by at least 80,000 before next Sept. 30.
   An attempt to write a policy resolution and get it through House
and Senate would be risky for both Congress and the White House.
Bush has been quoted as telling members of Congress that he would
welcome a resolution of support, along the lines of the United
Nations resolution authorizing force after Jan. 15, but ``if you're
going to debate this for months and not reach a conclusion and
argue about it, then that may not be helpful ... ''
   Resolutions endorsing his policy were adopted by overwhelming
votes in the House and Senate early in October, backing ``continued
action by the president ... to deter Iraqi aggression and protect
American lives and vital interests.'' But the authors of those
measures said they covered only what had been done to that point,
and did not authorize the use of force.
   When those measures passed, the strategy for forcing Iraq's
withdrawal from Kuwait was built around economic sanctions against
Iraq, with the United States assigned to defend Saudi Arabia
against any attack by Saddam Hussein's forces.
   On Nov. 8, Bush ordered U.S. forces doubled, to create the
capability and raise the possibility of military action to retake
Kuwait. Democratic leaders were told of the decision shortly before
Bush announced it. And support that had been almost unanimous began
to fray, with Democrats urging patience, to give economic sanctions
more time to work.
   But Democrats can't risk becoming the party of dissent while
American forces are at risk. That could weaken the U.S. position in
the current confrontation, at a time when Bush says the best way to
avoid war is to convince Saddam Hussein that he faces war unless he
relents. And it could do them lasting political damage. Vice
President Dan Quayle produced a preview of a Republican
counterattack, saying earlier this month that ``patience at any
price'' would amount to appeasement of Saddam Hussein.
   As the debate resumes, Sen. George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, the
majority leader, says whatever the differences on timing and
tactics, the United States is united on the goal of getting Iraq
out of Kuwait.
   The question is how.

   In a sunlit New England meadow, Kolya
stretches out among his sheep for a snooze.
   Even in dozy repose, he investigates anyone approaching the
flock.
   And when eyes meet, there is little doubt who's in charge - it's
the Shar Planinetz, a huge, lion-like dog with majestic blue mane
bred to protect the flocks in the mountains of Yugoslavia from
wolves.
   Kolya is one of the first of the breed to be used successfully
against coyotes by a pair of Hampshire College biologists.
   Nearly 15 years after Ray and Lorna Coppinger began
experimenting with rare breeds from remote corners of Europe,
thousands of the big dogs are watching over flocks in the American
West.
   And like good shepherds, the Coppingers are keeping an eye on
the big, deceptively placid breeds.
   ``They are still the best non-lethal method we've got to protect
sheep against coyotes and other predators on the open range,''
Coppinger said.
   ``We thought we'd place out and follow 100 dogs and that would
be the end of the research, but we're up to 1,221 now and still at
it,'' Mrs. Coppinger said. ``The sheep producers wouldn't let us
stop.''
   She estimates that with offspring of dogs and the work of other
groups, there are 4,000 to 5,000 guard dogs protecting flocks.
   ``They are an answer to all of us,'' said Sandy Petersen, a
rancher in Sidney, Mont., who leaves her two guard dogs alone with
her flock of 350 purebred sheep. ``They eat a lot, but it's nothing
compared to the cost of losing the lambs to coyotes and you don't
have to get involved in poison. They keep us in business.''
   Initially skeptical, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is now
promoting sheep-guarding dogs with pamphlets and videos.
   In some areas of the West, the dogs have significantly changed
the way ranchers manage flocks, said Tom MacDonald of the American
Sheep Producers Association. They are particularly effective on
desert range, where a pair of dogs can protect 1,000 ewes, he said.
   Some Colorado ranchers have told the association their losses
have been cut from 450 sheep a year to a dozen or so.
   And not just from coyotes.
   At the Coppingers' farm recently a student was training a pair
of beguiling, white Maremma pups headed for the area around
Yellowstone Park, where ranchers are nervous about plans to
reintroduce wolves.
   In a test in Minnesota, a single dog kept a small wolf pack from
a bait station for 30 nights, until the wolves finally combined
forces to drive off the dog, Coppinger said.
   ``We put him back the next night with a second dog and it went
back to a standoff,'' he said. Despite nightly confrontations, the
two dogs deterred the wolves until the experiment was ended 30
nights later.
   Typically, the dogs chase away, rather than kill.
   ``One of the primary aims of any predator is to keep itself
healthy, because it can't hunt for food when it's hurt. So they
will back off in the face of the threat of likely harm,'' Mrs.
Coppinger said.
   Supported by a newly created association of guard dog users,
Mrs. Coppinger is compiling a computerized registry of dogs on
American farms and ranches, their working characteristics and blood
lines.
   Although some crossbreeds have been successful, and the Tibetan
mastiff also is used, most of the sheep-guarding dogs in the United
States are European breeds.
   Some, such as the Great Pyrenees from the mountains along the
French-Spanish border and the Komondor and Kuvasz from Hungary, had
also become popular as pets. But others - the Anatolian shepherd,
the Akbash dog from Turkey, the Maremma from Italy, the Shar
Planinetz of Yugoslavia and the Polish Tatra - were little known
outside the sheep-raising areas of the Old World.
   The only American entry is a smaller strain, developed by the
Navahos in Arizona to defend flocks against coyotes, Mrs. Coppinger
said.
   Little research had been done linking dogs' personality traits
to genetics when the Coppingers first began their studies in the
1970s.
   They found that through years of breeding, the guard dogs'
psychological development had been arrested in the beguiling stage
f puppyhood when little animals affectionately lick and touch
their litter mates. They stay close to the nest and are suspicious
of anything new, reacting to an intrusion with a panicked bark or
snap.
   The dogs also lack good species recognition patterns and when
raised with sheep or other animals are ``unclear about who or what
is and isn't a dog,'' Coppinger said. ``They may think of sheep as
dogs, or llamas as dogs or people as dogs.''
   So a Shar Planinetz will lie down peacefully with its lambs but
will stand menacingly between its flock and danger.
   ``They seem to be able to set up limits and lines that are not
to be crossed,'' Mrs. Coppinger said. ``And once they have bonded
with the sheep, that's really the only training they need to guard.
''
   Roger Woodruff, a researcher at the University of Oregon, and
Jeffrey Green of the University of Idaho also began importing guard
dogs in the 1970s in a separate program. Woodruff, now with the
USDA, said their basic behavioral findings were similar.
   ``We were more oriented to immediate application and let it go
after placing 60 dogs,'' he said. ``The Coppingers have done a lot
of real in-depth behavioral and basic scientific research.''
   The dogs only watch and protect; they won't herd sheep.
   ``They don't see sheep as prey as a border collie does, but as
another dog,'' Coppinger said. ``You can't even get them to chase a
ball. It's just not in their makeup.''

   Physicians and scientists who consult
sports groups on steroid use say a new male contraceptive opens the
door to abuse by young athletes.
   A study done for the World Health Organization said weekly
injections of 200 milligrams of testosterone enanthate were a
``safe, stable, effective and reversible'' contraceptive
administered to males.
   But testosterone enanthate is an anabolic steroid banned by the
governing bodies of most sports. The hormone adds muscle mass and
strength to those who use it.
   ``Two-hundred milligrams will make me bigger and it will make
any man bigger,'' said Charles Yesalis, a consultant to the NCAA,
high schools and the National Football League Players Association.
   ``I can see guys saying, `You don't need to take the pill,
honey. I'll gladly take these shots,''' Yesalis said.
   A Seattle researcher who directed a part of the WHO study said
the dosage to induce infertility is too low to cause any problems,
but conceded that many of the 157 men who completed the study
reported weight gain.
   ``Some men who had been chronically underweight gained, and they
liked that. It was muscle. It wasn't flabby fat,'' said Dr. C.
Alvin Paulsen of the University of Washington Medical Center.
   Yesalis and Steve Courson, who played for the Pittsburgh
Steelers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League,
fear athletes will arrange to receive shots from several doctors a
week.
   ``For many athletes, their sports are just as important as
contraception,'' said Yesalis, a health and human development
professor at Penn State University who in the 1980s studied steroid
use among high school athletes.
   Courson, who started out using 35 milligrams of steroids a week
and once was up to 1,300 milligrams weekly, said: ``You can get
mighty big on 200 millgrams. It can be used as a performance
enducer at that level.''
   And if an athlete begins using steroids at too young an age, his
muscles can outgrow his still-growing bones, Courson said.
   ``Kids aspire to be what the superstars are, so they try to use
the drugs they perceive the athletes are using,'' he said.
   Courson was interviewed from a Pittsburgh hospital, awaiting a
heart transplant for a degenerative heart disease. He said his
doctors aren't sure whether his heavy steroid use contributed to
his health problems.
   Testosterone occurs naturally, but is on the NCAA's list of
banned substances with other anabolic, or strength-enducing,
steroids. Players can lose eligibility if levels of the hormone are
six times the level of epitestosterone.
   Steroid use also is banned by the International Olympic
Committee and state and local high school sports federations.
   ``It opens the door to abuse because testosterone is the
granddaddy of all the anabolic steroids,'' said Dr. Richard
Strauss, a professor of medicine at Ohio State University and
editor of the monthly journal Physician and Sportsmedicine.
   The WHO study was reported in a recent issue of the medical
journal Lancet in London. The study said men had to be injected for
an average of four months before enough hormone built up in their
bodies to stop sperm production. Of the 157 men tested, only one
fathered a child.
   After the injections were stopped, normal sperm production
resumed in an average of 6.7 months, the report said.
   If the male contraceptive comes into wide use, and Strauss and
Paulsen think it will, sports agencies either will have to change
their rules to allow its use by athletes or tell athletes to use
other methods while in competition.
   ``In the past, some asthma medications used were actually
stimulants and athletes made the argument they needed to take
them,'' Strauss said. ``They were told to use other medications.''
   Frank Uryasz, the director of sports sciences and drug testing
for the NCAA, said there now appears no way around the testosterone
ban.
   ``To make exceptions in this area would create a tremendous
loophole,'' he said.
   ``Right now, there are no legitimate uses,'' Uryasz said. ``If
you have to use them (now), you're going to be so sick you're not
going to be competing in intercollegiate athletics.''

<HEAD>Mother Vows To Search for Cure to Son's Rare Disease</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW CANAAN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Lisa Livingston stands over her son's
crib and strokes his hair as a lullaby plays softly in the
background. It's nap time for Brett Livingston Seber.
   Except the little boy spends his life in a perpetual state of
half sleep, the victim of a disease so rare that doctors knew
almost nothing about it until a decade ago.
   Brett was born with 4-hydroxybutyric aciduria, a hereditary
disease in which a missing enzyme in the brain causes severe brain
damage and loss of muscle control.
   ``For reasons that we don't fully understand, missing this
enzyme interferes with normal early brain growth and development,''
said Dr. Darryl De Vivo, chief of pediatric neurology at
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York. ``He really is
kind of in a chronic stage of sleep.''
   Fewer than two dozen children in the world have been diagnosed
with the disease, De Vivo said.
   Brett, who just turned 4, has the most severe case of the
disease ever seen, De Vivo said.
   At an age when he should be running, playing and learning new
words, Brett lies motionless in a stainless steel crib with a
feeding tube in his nose. Round-the-clock nurses monitor his every
breath. He cannot move any part of his body without help except his
eyelids.
   The disease has robbed him of his eyesight, although no one
knows if he is totally blind. He has never spoken a word. He hasn't
been outside in more than a year.
   His only response to the outside world is the soft humming sound
he makes when his mother talks to him.
   Doctors don't know how to treat the disease. So few people
suffer from it that they don't know the long-term prognosis - the
oldest victim is now 6 years old - and little research is being
done.
   Livingston, who is divorced from Brett's father, recently set
out to change that. In November, she established a foundation to
raise money for research into 4-hydroxybutyric aciduria and other
rare childhood diseases.
   Her goal is to find a corporate sponsor to donate money for
research. But for now, all she has is a post office box, and the
dream of a cure.
   ``I will do anything humanly possible so tat no other child and
parent have to go through this,'' she said.
   Livingston spends hours reading, singing and talking to Brett.
Her 6-year-old daughter, Courtney, performs plays for her brother
and scampers back and forth into his room.
   To an observer, Brett seems awake because his eyes are always
open. In fact, his brain does not go through all the normal sleep
cycles, and a nurse must give him a sedative so he can rest.
   Brett was born a seemingly normal child. The only hint that
something was wrong was his inability to crawl, but doctors said he
was just slow to develop because he was a big baby.
   When he was 11 months old, he slumped over in his high chair and
fell into a coma.
   Livingston found topnotch pediatric neurologists at
Columbia-Presbyterian. There she met De Vivo, who has since become
an authority on Brett's disease.
   The medical bills have been in the hundreds of thousands of
dollars, Livingston said. She has insurance, but that runs out in
July and she is having trouble finding another carrier.
   ``I'm totally wiped out,'' said Livingston, a part-time
elementary school teacher.
   She receives alimony from her former husband, and the Colleen
Giblin Memorial Foundation, a private charity that provides money
for research in pediatric neurology, also has helped.
   Livingston kicked off her own fund-raising effort at a local
card and gift store, where the manager offered to put a jar on the
counter to collect money.
   Within a week, more than $350 was deposited in the jar, said
Lillian Tyska, manager of Miller's Hallmark Shop in Stamford.
   ``One man stood there and cried,'' Tyska said. ``And I said,
`Are you related?' He said, `No, but this breaks my heart.'''

   It's tough being a major leaguer, what with
the huge paychecks, fans who idolize you, and a job that lets you
do what you've loved since you were a kid.
   You don't think that's tough?
   Then talk with Dr. Herndon P. Harding Jr., psychiatrist to the
Los Angeles Dodgers.
   ``The degree of the pressure they experience is much more
heightened than for most people,'' said Harding, who quit as
director of Ohio's Department of Mental Health to become the Dodger
organization's first psychiatrist.
   Not that being a Dodger is harmful to your mental health.
Harding figures that if you can make it to the pros, you've
probably learned to handle stress fairly well. But the way he sees
it, counseling can make you even better.
   For instance, he said, a pitcher may concentrate on ``I gotta
throw this fastball'' instead of ``I'm gonna burn this thing down
the middle.''
   The ``gotta'' is a negative thought that shows fear of failure -
and, if you concentrate on failure, you'll find it, Harding said.
On the other hand, he said, the ``gonna'' assumes you'll like doing
it and encourages success.
   He and other experts say, however, that their focus is on more
than improving concentration. They say relieving long-term problems
from on and off the field can free an athlete to play his best.
   ``My role has been a preventative one, to see no talent's lost
for psychological reasons,'' said Bruce C. Ogilvie, a professor
emeritus at San Jose State University in California and a longtime
sports psychologist.
   There are plenty of chances for talent to be lost. Those huge
paychecks, for instance, can come with a mental-health deduction,
said Dr. Richard G. Rappaport, a sports psychiatrist in Rancho
Santa Fe, Calif., a suburb of San Diego.
   ``Who's got the biggest income becomes the way they compete,''
Rappaport said.
   And, the experts say, competing is what athletes may do too much
of, against their own goals or each other. Non-pros also may carry
their own excess pressures, driving themselves constantly and never
forgiving failure, but the pros do it in the public eye, Rappaport
said.
   ``The requirements are so total and absolute,'' said Ogilvie.
``You really are denied a private existence, not permitted to have
failures as a human being.''
   A player who's losing playing time finds himself facing ``one of
the most traumatic realities he has to confront,'' Ogilvie added.
Without help, the athlete might turn to substance abuse, he said.
   And if a player succeeds, he can get the big head. ``Who's ever
prepared for that sudden rush of exaltation?'' Ogilvie asked.
   It's no wonder that a lot of elite athletes seem to love
themselves a lot, Harding said. They've been told how good they are
since they were kids.
   By giving them breaks on everything from homework to chores,
their supporters limit athletes' understanding of the real worl,
Harding said. ``It's not their fault. They've been given this life
and they don't know anything else.''
   Star athletes also attract women, which can mean trouble for
marriages - or, as Ogilvie put it, ``They have special problems in
maintaining a primary relationship.'' Long, repeated road trips
away from family create a loneliness that can make things worse, he
said.
   The pressure can come to bear on performance, Harding said.
``That's the first line of intervention - to find out what's
interfering with the specific performance - and then explore what
kind of things might be occurring outside of playing the game.''
   Long-term treatment might not be needed, but rather short-term
therapy might do it, Rappaport said.
   A lot of athletes just lack the maturity to figure out where
their lives are going, he said. ``I would try to reorient them, to
look at things in perspective.''

<HEAD>Realistic Resolutions To Eat Better in 1991</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Resolving to go on a diet is probably one of the
most common resolutions any year, but doing it all at once is too
hard for many people to sustain past the New Year's Day football
game halftime.
   ``It's very difficult, particularly if you love good food,''
said chef Julia Child.
   But she and a few others who pay close attention to what
Americans eat offered a few specific resolutions to make the task
easier:
   - Jane Brody, author of ``Jane Brody's Good Food Gourmet'':
   ``Change one meal a week to be lower in fat, higher in fiber,
and richer in the health-promoting complex carbohydrates, like
potatoes, rice, pasta and beans.''
   Every other week, she suggested, change one more meal. ``By the
end of the year, you will have a far more nutritious diet and
probably have lost a considerable amount of weight.''
   - Bonnie Liebman, nutrition specialist, Center for Science in
the Public Interest:
   ``Eat red meat no more three times a week.''
   ``Use 1 percent or skim milk,'' rather than whole milk or 2
percent milk.
   ``Eat five to nine fruits or vegetables a day. People have
heard, `Eat more vegetables,' since they were 2. It goes in one ear
and out the other. But if people have a number, it helps.''
   - Julia Child:
   ``Unfortunately, cocktails and wine and liquor add an awful lot
of empty calories. So I think, when you're having a sparkling soda,
put in some lime, pretend it's a cocktail. Put it in a nice stem
glass and sit back.''
   On toast, use marmelade instead of butter, she said. Butter has
about 100 calories per tablespoon, around twice that of marmelade.
   ``Be conscious of everything you eat,'' she said. ``Eat a lot of
filling things so you feel satisfied.''
   - Ruth Lahmayer, registered dietitian from Atlanta and
spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association:
   ``A lot of people cut out starches. I would encourage four to
six starch servings a day, even if you're trying to lose weight,''
Lahmayer said. A serving, she said, is a half bagel, a slice of
bread, or a half-cup pasta, rice or cereal.
   ``And the good old basic one is be sure to have a good breakfast
every day, consisting of one to two starches, one fruit, either
fresh or half-cup of juice, and one cup of low-fat yogurt or skim
or low-fat milk,'' she said.
   Lahmayer also said to cut meat to two small protein servings a
day, two to three ounces, which is about the size of a deck of
cards or cassette tape case.
   - Katherine Eakin, editor of Cooking Light magazine:
   ``Don't say, `I'm never going to eat a specific food again.' Be
realistic. Just say I'm going to eat less,'' she said. ``If you say
never, you'll only want it more.''
   Eat at home more often and cook more. ``If you're trying to eat
a moderate, balanced and varied diet, if you have more control, you
have more confidence,'' Eakin said.
   - Clark Wolf, New York restaurant consultant:
   ``I travel a lot and I eat a lot. It's my job to eat a lot. And
I'm pushing 40 and am trying to keep in shape,'' Wolf said.
   ``My secret weapon is popcorn. I buy it in airports. I go into
movie theaters and buy popcorn'' - without butter - even when he's
not going to the movies.
   It tastes good and is filling, Wolf said. Eating some before a
big dinner leaves him with a reasonable appetite, he said.
   ``The good news is in train stations and airports, they're
serving popcorn,'' usually fresh and usually popped in vegetable
oil, he said.
   And Wolf has a trick not available to most people: ``My other
secret for keeping thin is I'm allergic to chocolate.''

<HEAD>School Staff Should Be Trained for Emergencies, Panel Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least two non-medical members of a school's
staff should be trained to handle medical emergencies, a committee
of pediatricians says.
   Training should include first aid, cardiopulmonary resuscitation
and treatment of anaphylaxis, a serious allergic reaction,
according to the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on School
Health.
   Trained staff members should be able to handle emergencies until
the school nurse or physician or other emergency personnel can be
reached, the committee says in the December issue of the journal
Pediatrics.
   Emergencies related to athletics could be handled by a trainer
or athletic staff member trained in sports medicine and emergency
care, the committee suggested.

<HEAD>Farmers Shouldn't Try To Eradicate Fire Ants, Just Manage Them</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's no way to wipe out fire ants
permanently, so it's more economic to work on keeping infestations
manageable, a Texas entomologist says.
   ``We're still hoping for a magic bullet,'' said Bastiaan
``Bart'' Drees of Texas A&amp;M University's agricultural extension
service.
   He said the best hope for fire ant control appears to be in
using fungi and insects that prey on fire ants in South America,
the ants' original home.
   Florida researchers have patented one kind of South American
fungi for use against fire ants, but it is likely to be years
before enough organisms are available to keep down the numbers of
fire ants, he said while in town to speak to the Entomological
Society of America.
   When fire ants showed up in this country in the 1920s, farmers
tried to wipe them out with chemicals, Drees said. DDT and similar
chemicals kept the numbers down only temporarily, and killed or
threatened many animals higher up the food chain.
   The chemicals also eradicated many of the native ants now
recognized as the best defense against fire ants. ``They competed
with fire ants for resources. And they mated with fire ant
queens,'' he said.
   The safer pesticides now available offer only a one-year respite
and are too expensive to spread on every field, he said.
   ``The cheapest chemicals are $10 per acre per year. That may not
provide an economic return,'' said Drees. ``So ... the management
goal becomes to solve the problems caused by ants without
necessarily eliminating the fire ant from the ecosystem.''
   Fire ants can be helpful, too, Drees said. ``The ants feed on
pests that eat cotton - the boll weevil, the fleahopper, boll
worms. They reduce the need for chemical treatment of those
pests.''
   And although fire ants attack calves during birth, they also eat
pests that live on cattle, such as the lone star tick, horn flies,
house flies and stable flies. ``Instead of treating a 600-acre
cattle ranch, people are just treating the calving pasture,'' Drees
said.

   Sales of existing homes showed a modest 3
percent increase in November, a real estate trade group said. Some
analysts took the report as a possible harbinger of better days
ahead for the slumping housing industry.
   The National Association of Realtors said Wednesday that sales
of existing single-family homes last month posted their first
increase since a 5.1 percent advance in August.
   Sales had fallen 9.4 percent in September and 3.8 percent in
October, pushing the annual sales rate to its lowest level in
almost six years.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Brokendown merger talks between TWA and Pan Am
reached a standoff Wednesday as the two struggling airlines
bickered over whether TWA should give Pan Am documents detailing
its offer.
   In a letter to TWA Chairman Carl C. Icahn, a top Pan Am official
said his company believes TWA is not willing to go through with its
offer to pay an estimated $375 million for Pan Am.
   In response, Icahn wrote that the buyout offer stands as long as
Pan Am does not go into bankruptcy. An aide to Icahn said TWA does
not intend to give Pan Am the term sheet now.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Crude oil futures posted their biggest gains in
three weeks, rising above $27 a barrel on increasing fears of a
Middle East war.
   Oil market strategists said rising tension between the United
States and Iraq since the U.S. market closed last Friday gave
prices a boost.
   Light sweet crude oil for February delivery increased $1.30 to
$27.22 per 42-gallon barrel on Wednesday. It was the biggest
single-day gain since a $1.51 per barrel jump Dec. 4.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Despite some high-profile deals like the planned
$7.4 billion buyout of MCA Inc., merger activity fell by nearly
half this year as the U.S. takeover market cooled following the
hectic pace of the 1980s.
   Merger activity fell 47 percent in 1990 to 4,486 deals valued at
$199.9 billion from the 4,763 deals valued at $377.9 billion for
all of 1989, Securities Data Co., a financial research firm based
in Newark, N.J., reported Wednesday.
   The figures include deals announced during each year. The 1990
total includes Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.'s planned
acquisition of MCA and the $6.2 billion stock-swap merger between
GTE Corp. and Contel Corp.

   NEW YORK (AP) - A bankruptcy judge has barred the New York Stock
Exchange from seeking a record $50 million fine from Drexel Burnham
Lambert Group Inc., saying the firm's securities law violations had
been punished adequately.
   The ruling by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Francis Conrad means the
stock exchange can't proceed with disciplinary action against
Drexel related to the investment firm's 1989 guilty plea to six
felony counts related to illegal trading.
   The NYSE had planned to seek $25 million each from the parent
company and the securities subsidiary, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. and the Chicago Board

   The two sides said Wednesday they had signed an agreement
extending the CBOE's exclusive license to trade options on the S&amp;P
500 Index and the S&amp;P 100 Index, two important measures of stock

   S&amp;P, a subsidiary of McGraw-Hill Inc., last minth charged the

suggestions at home that he step aside in the wake of ethical
questions raised in the savings and loan scandal.
   Riegle said he intends to convene hearings early next year on

   Despite some high-profile deals like the planned
$7.4 billion buyout of MCA Inc., merger activity fell by nearly
half this year as the U.S. takeover market cooled following the
hectic pace of the 1980s.
   Merger activity fell 47 percent in 1990 to 4,486 deals valued at
$199.9 billion from the 4,763 deals valued at $377.9 billion for
all of 1989, Securities Data Co., a financial research firm based
in Newark, N.J., reported Wednesday.
   The figures include deals announced during each year. The 1990
total includes Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.'s planned
acquisition of MCA, the $6.2 billion stock-swap merger between GTE
Corp. and Contel Corp. and Georgia-Pacific Corp.'s $3.6 billion
hostile takeover of Great Northern Nekoosa Corp.
   The planned MCA-Matsushita marriage - the most recent of the big
deals - and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s pending $6.1
billion hostile bid for NCR Corp. has led to some speculation that
the merger boom of the mid-to-late 1980s might be reviving.
   However, said Bernard Black, a corporate finance professor at
Columbia Law School, ``It's a mistake to assume that an overall
trend has changed because there happens to be a couple of big deals
announced.''
   ``It's very hard to do a highly leveraged deal, and neither the
Matsushita nor the AT&amp;T deal is inconsistent with that,'' he said.
``They're both one big company buying another and there's no reason
to think that kind of deal is going to disappear.''
   Black referred to the scarcity of financing - particularly debt
financing - that has slowed the merger business to a crawl over the
past year.
   Mergers and takeovers peaked in late 1988 with the record $24.53
billion debt-financed takeover of RJR Nabisco Inc. by Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. Activity declined early in 1989 and then
skidded sharply after the failure of several big buyouts, most
notably the $6.6 billion takeover of Federated Department Stores
Inc. by Campeau Corp.
   The Federated deal foundered in September 1989 after Campeau was
unable to meet payments on junk bonds used to finance that takeover
and the earlier $3.6 billion buyout of Allied Stores Corp. The
market for the risky high-yield bonds crashed after Campeau's
troubles became known, and financing for mergers and acquisitions
was suddenly hard to come by.
   Most of the mergers and buyouts done these days are known as
strategic deals, undertaken by companies looking to expand or build
market share. The MCA-Matsushita deal, GTE-Contel merger and the
Georgia-Pacific-Great Northern takeover are all examples of such
transactions.
   While this trend remains in place, Black predicted another kind
of strategic deal would become more commonplace: mergers or buyouts
involving companies in trouble because of the difficult economy and
in need of help to compete.
   He pointed to the proposed merger between Trans World Airlines
and Pan Am Corp. as a deal based on such concerns, and added, ``I'm
sure we're going to see a whole lot of bank acquisition activity
related to competitive pressures.''
   On Friday, Pan Am said it was receptive toward a buyout offer
from TWA that values Pan Am at about $375 million, but the two
companies are haggling over an interim loan for Pan Am. Both are
considered among the weakest U.S. airlines.
   While the U.S. merger market shrank considerably in 1990,
Securities Data reported a boom in deals involving European firms.
The company reported 667 transactions with European partners with a
total value of $61.1 billion, up 109 percent from 717 deals worth
$29.1 billion in 1989.
   But the surge was confined to the continent, the company said.
Worldwide merger activity was down 31 percent this year, as 8,157
deals worth $441.6 billion were announced, compared with 8,822
transactions valued at $643.6 billion last year.
   In compiling its figures, Securities Data said it considered
mergers, acquisitions, share repurchases, offers to exchange stock,
spinoffs, self-tenders of stock, minority stake purchases and
leveraged recapitalizations.

<HEAD>Pan Am, TWA Merger Talks Reach Standoff, Two Sides Bicker Over
Documents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   NEW YORK (P) - Merger talks between Pan Am and TWA have broken
down over Pan Am's request that TWA put details of its offer in
writing.
   Executives of the struggling airlines exchanged letters
Wednesday blaming each other for the standoff.
   Richard H. Francis, Pan Am chief financial officer, wrote to TWA
Chairman Carl C. Icahn complaining that TWA has not provided a term
sheet with details of its offer.
   ``If you wish to send us a term sheet spelling out in detail any
TWA current proposal, ... we would be pleased to consider it and
meet with you if it provides an acceptable basis for further
discussion,'' Francis, wrote in the letter to Icahn Wednesday.
   TWA officials responded that Pan Am executives would have gotten
the details if they hadn't called off a meeting scheduled for
Monday.
   ``We're not going to give them the documents and have them go
shop them around,'' Mark Buckstein, TWA general counsel, said in a
telephone interview. ``Or quote portions of it out of context.
We'll only go over it with them if they are serious.''
   Buckstein said the details have been given to Pan Am orally.
   Icahn's letter responding to Francis said the buyout offer
stands as long as Pan Am does not go into bankruptcy, sell assets
for less than fair value, default on major debts or make similar
moves.
   Icahn also raised the possibility that Pan Am may see an
imminent bankruptcy filing and is concerned whether the offer would
remain in place. He repeated his proposal to provide a bridge loan
as long as TWA was classified as a debtor-in-possession, which
would put the airline first in line for repayment if Pan Am filed
for bankruptcy protection.
   ``When you are ready to discuss that proposal, or the
shareholder proposal ... we are ready to meet,'' Icahn wrote in his
response to Francis.
   Icahn launched his offer for Pan Am Dec. 16 as he announced
plans to sell all of TWA's London routes and some other assets to a
healthier rival, American Airlines, in a package worth $625
million.
   Pan Am agreed to sell key London routes and other assets to UAL
subsidiary United Airlines in a $400 million deal.
   That deal has been held up as U.S. and British officials
negotiate over whether United will be able to use London's Heathrow
Airport, as Pan Am does, or be switched to the less-desirable
Gatwick. UAL officials have said the deal depends on approval to
use Heathrow.

   Cut-rate ornaments, Christmas cards and other Yule paraphernalia
attracted the affections of shoppers, but retail analysts were
skeptical that an after Christmas buying spree would rescue the
season.
   ``Cards half price, wrapping half price; the bargains are good.
It's all for next Christmas,'' shopper Sandy Runte said as she
pushed her young son and a half-dozen bags in a stroller around the
Grand Avenue Mall in Milwaukee.
   The day after Christmas historically is one of the busiest
shopping days of the year and retailers are hoping a late surge
that began just before the holiday will continue, boosting retail
sales undercut by a slumping economy and worries over the Persian
Gulf situation.
   A spot check of stores by AP staff around the country showed one
of the biggest draws for shoppers on the first day after Christmas
was in marked-down decorations.
   ``It's incredible. It's a shopping frenzy,'' said Liz Gillespie,
marketing director at Park Plaza Mall in Little Rock, Ark. ``I
mean, the stores are just jammed, especially the ones with seasonal
products.''
   Karen Moody, of New York, visiting family for the holidays,
headed to Marshall Fields and Co. in downtown Chicago to buy cards
and wrap for next year.
   ``I've never paid full price for my Christmas cards yet,'' Moody
said. ``It's pandemonium up on the 6th floor (where seasonal items
are sold). I was so glad to get out of there.''
   ``We're bargain hunting for crystal,'' said Stacia Van Heuklon,
of Rochester, Minn., visiting family in Indiana. She, her two
brothers, two sisters and mother came to Chicago for an annual
tradition. ``It's early Christmas shopping for next year. We do
this every year. Everything is 50 percent off.''
   Even for those stores that show gains of a few percentage points
in sales over a year ago, those gains translate into declines when
the effect of inflation is taken into account. For the first 11
months of the year, inflation at the retail level averaged 6.4
percent, government figures show.
   ``The cake was baked for this season in August and September.
The ingredients for failure were there early on. This season was
like a souffle that never rose,'' said Alan Millstein, publisher of
Fashion Network Report, in New York.
   ``It's been worse than disappointing. For major department
stores, it's been a calamity. It's the worst year for major
department stores since the Great Depression. They not only didn't
meet last year's figures, they fell behind the rate of inflation,''
he said.
   ``Retailers used every trick in their bag and nothing seemed to
work. The trick now will be, how big will the clearance sales in
January be?''
   ``Consumers were very tight with their dollars,'' said David A.
Williamson, a retail analyst for the Advest Group Inc. ``Retailers
had to be very promotional just to get customers into the stores,
let alone buy stuff.''
   On Wednesday, however, some retailers were encouraged by what
they saw.
   ``The parking lot's packed and there are people in the store.
It's generally one of the busier days of the year,'' said Julie
Sertner, special events manager at the Macy's store in the Dallas
Galleria.

   The dollar rose against the Japanese yen for the
sixth consecutive day today, and Tokyo share prices edged up.
   The dollar closed at 136.65 yen, up 0.40 yen from Wednesday's
close of 136.25 yen. After opening at 136.75 yen, it ranged between
136.45 yen and 137.10 yen.
   Gaining 3.62 yen in six trading days, the dollar closed at its
highest since Oct. 3, when it also closed at 136.65 yen.
   Spot trading totaled $6.02 billion, up from Wednesday's $2.85
billion.
   Currency dealers said importers were buying dollars for
month-end settlements, and even small amounts of buying had an
impact on the thin year-end market.
   The dollar has been pushed up recently by instability in the
Soviet Union, as well as the Persian Gulf crisis, as investors look
for a safe haven in dollar holdings.
   The dollar closed higher despite being sold later in the day on
reports that Iraq had expressed willingness to talk with the United
States, said Tomoko Hirai, a dealer at Citibank.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average
closed at 23,940.70 points, up 53.14 points, or 0.22 percent, from
its close on Wednesday at 23,887.56 points. The Nikkei average
gained 119.68 points Wednesday.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 330 million shares,
up from 223.5 million shares Wednesday.
   The market's mood picked up after an overnight rise in share
prices in New York, traders said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
gained 15.84 points, closing at 2,637.13 points Wednesday.
   ``Optimism about the new year is beginning to be reflected on
the market,'' said Masayoshi Yano, a dealer at Nikko Securities.
   He said speculation that the Middle East situation may be
heading toward a peaceful resolution also helped boost market
sentiment.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 88.15 points from Wednesday's
close of 87.96. Their yield fell to 7.040 percent from 7.080
percent.

   Orders to U.S. factories for ``big ticket''
durable goods plunged 10.5 percent in November to the lowest level
in two and a half years, the government said today.
   The decline matched the post-1958 record for one month set in
January of this year and indicates the recession most economists
believe started this fall is deepening.
   The drop likely is a harbinger of further layoffs at
manufacturing plants, where payrolls have hrunk by 800,000 jobs
over the past two years - 200,000 in November alone.
   Order declines were widespread, but were biggest in the
transportation and defense industries.
   ``It's a precipitous decline indicative of a U.S. economy that
is ending 1990 on a very harsh note,'' said economist Stephen S.
Roach of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. ``I think the manufacturing sector
right now is in the worst of the recession.''
   Overall, orders for durable goods - items from bicycles to
battleships expected to last three or more years - totaled a
seasonally-adjusted $115.9 billion last month. That was the lowest
since May 1988.
   Orders had risen 3.6 percent in October, but have been down in
six of 11 months so far in 1990.
   Transportation orders fell 27.4 percent in November. That
included a drop of 38.8 percent in aircraft and parts, more than
offsetting October's 20.4 percent increase. Boeing Co. earlier
reported new orders of $5.2 billion, down from $10.7 billion a
month earlier. Automobile and parts orders also fell.
   Excluding the volatile transportation sector, orders fell 3.5
percent to their lowest levels in two years after edging down 0.2
percent in October.
   New orders for defense equipment dropped 9.6 percent. Orders
excluding defense were down 9.6 percent.
   Non-defense capital goods - a key barometer of business'
investment in expansion and modernization - fell 16.4 percent in
November.
   Only orders for non-electrical machinery - which includes
computers - showed no decline. They were unchanged from October to
November.
   Electrical machinery orders fell 7.6 percent and primary metals
orders dropped 9.8 percent.
   The backlog of unfilled orders - a good indication of how busy
factories will be in months ahead - dropped 1.1 percent to $497.5
billion. It was the largest one-month decline since November 1985.
   Shipments dropped 3.6 percent to $121.7 billion, the lowest
level since last January.

<HEAD>Judge Bars Pilots' ickout for One Week</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge temporarily has barred
American Airlines pilots from staging sickouts and other job
actions that would further delay and cancel flights.
   American's lawyers complained that sick leave, equipment-caused
delays and other allegedly illegal acts had skyrocketed since
American's contract with the Allied Pilots Association became
eligible for renegotiation last Jan. 1.
   U.S. District Judge John McBryde on Wednesday issued the
temporary retraining order and scheduled a hearing for next
Thursday to devided whether it would be made permanent.
   Union officials declined comment until they study the ruling.
Previously they have denied charges of a work slowdown in response
to stalled contract negotiations.
   American's complaint alleged pilot actions that are illegal
under the Railway Labor Act, the federal law governing airline
labor contracts.
   The airline in its court complaint accused the pilots of
``capricious and excessive'' reporting of alleged equipment
problems, increase sick leave, slow taxiing and other actions.
   American has accused the APA, which represents about 8,000
pilots, of staging a sickout to compel management to agree to
pilots' contract terms.
   Airline officials said that pilot sick hours peaked at 28,082
for November, compared with 19,319 in November 1989. On Nov. 27,
386 American Airlines pilots were out sick, tying the company
record, officials said.
   American said daily flight delays attributable to pilot actions
have run as high as 215 on Dec. 19, compared with an average of 89
delays per day in 1989. Flight cancellations this month due to lack
of pilots reached 194 Wednesday, American said.
   American said that since negotiations turned sour, the company
has attributed to pilots 55 delays per 1,000 flights. In 1989, the
average was 38.6 delays per 1,000 flights.

<HEAD>Wheat, Corn Futures Slip, Soybeans Gain In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat and corn futures prices were fractionally
lower while soybeans were mostly higher in quiet early trading
today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat and corn opened lower after a weekly Agriculture
Department report released late Wednesday showed
lower-than-expected amounts of those commodities were inspected for
export last week.
   Losses in wheat were tempered by forecasts for another blast of
Arctic air this weekend in the Great Plains, renewing the threat of
frost damage to the winter wheat crop.
   ``You won't really know how much winterkill there is until later
in the year,'' said Joel Karlin, a grains analyst with Research
Department Inc. in Chicago.
   ``The wheat seed that is used nowadays has become fairly
resistant to these winter freezes,'' he said.
   Soybean export inspections were higher than expected, which lent
light support to the soybean complex this morning.
   In early trading, wheat futures were { cent lower to 1 cent
higher with the contract for delivery in March at $2.65{ a bushel;
corn was unchanged to } cent lower with March at $2.34\ a bushel;
oats were { cent to 1} cents higher with March at $1.15\ a bushel;
soybeans were unchanged to { cent higher with January at $5.67 a
bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly lower and pork futures were mixed in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .13 cent lower to .07 cent higher with February
at 77.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent to .33 cent
lower with January at 89.17 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent
to .28 cent higher with February at 49 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .15 cent lower to .35 cent higher with February at
64.65 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on Wednesday.

   Most countries that compete successfully with
the United States for trade have stronger labor unions than this
country has, according to figures put together by an American
economist.
   ``The U.S. has among the lowest unionization rates in the world
today,'' wrote Thomas Karier, who teaches economics at Eastern
Washington University in Cheney, Washington.
   ``It is especially difficult to argue that unions have impaired
U.S. competitiveness when much stronger unions in Japan, Canada and
West Germany seem to have had no such effect,'' Karier said.
   His study, ``Trade Deficits and Labor Unions,'' was done for the
Economic Policy Institute. The group is financed by labor unions,
foundations and corporations.
   Unions bargain for higher wages and better working conditions
that raise the costs of production. Higher production costs raise
the prices of products and make them less competitive with products
from other countries. But Karier argues that Japan, Canada and what
used to be West Germany - which together account for most of the
U.S. trade deficit - are already high-wage countries.
   But Fariborz Ghadar, professor of business administration at
George Washington University, found Karier's reasoning too simple.
Competitiveness has to be judged over time and industry by
industry, he said in an interview.
   ``The fact is, the industries where the United States is most
competitive - biotechnology, aircraft, computers - are the least
unionized,'' he said. ``If I were doing a study, I would start from
there and try to find the relationships.''
   At the Brookings Institution, Senior Fellow Robert Z. Lawrence
also suggested that the approach to competitiveness should be
broader, taking into account standards of living.
   Labor union strength in the United States has declined in recent
years. Karier estimates that 18 percent of the U.S. workforce was
unionized in 1985.
   The economist compared the United States in this regard with 13
of its leading competitors. Only Hong Kong with 15 percent and
South Korea with 10 percent had lower unionization, according to
figures Karier quoted from the CIA in its World Fact Book for 1987.
   Japan, which usually has the biggest surplus in trade with the
United States, was quoted as 30 percent unionized, while West
Germany was 34 percent and Canada was 31 percent. But Taiwan,
another big competitor of the United States, was at the same level,
18 percent.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia will begin to
auction off small shops and state-owned businesses next month in
its first round of privatizations, the state CTK news agency
reported Thursday.
   The privatization is part of the government's program of
economic reforms. It is designed to turn over to private hands some
130,000 small shops and enterprises.
   The first auctions are to be held on the last weekend in January
in Prague, CTK said. Auctions will be held in two rounds, with the
first accessible only to Czechoslovak citizens and those who left
the country after 1948 when the Communists took over.
   Shops and enterprises unsold in the first round will be
auctioned in the second, at which some foreigners will be allowed
to bid.
   The privatization process is a key part of reforms aimed at
transforming Czechoslovakia's centralized economy into a
Western-style market system.
   Thousands of vendors across the country staged symbolic strikes
in September demanding they be given first crack at buying the
shops and a chance to pay up to half the price in installments
spread over a seven-year period.
   However, a law approved in October did not grant preferential
treatment to any potential buyers.
   CTK said the government would take at least a year to sell the
130,000 shops and enterprises at auction.
   Privatization of large industrial plants and the agricultural
sector is expected to begin later in 1991.

<HEAD>Gas Prices Fall, Biggest Weekly Drop Since Persian Gulf Crisis
Began</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gasoline at the pumps has fallen nearly 9 cents
a gallon since the week before Christmas, the biggest weekly drop
in prices since Iraq invaded Kuwait, the American Automobile
Association said Thursday.
   Self-serve unleaded cost $1.282 a gallon this week, an AAA
survey of stations nationwide showed. That's 8.9 cents lower than
the price on Dec. 18, and the lowest since a gallon of gas cost
$1.273 on Sept. 5.
   Oil and gasoline prices have been volatile since Iraq invaded
Kuwait on Aug. 2. Persian Gulf countries produce a substantial
portion of the world's crude oil, and any disruption of supplies
likely would cause prices to soar.
   But prices have been moderating since mid-October on increased
prospects for peace in the gulf. Oil buyers have also been worried
about a glut of oil, because users have reduced consumption and
oil-producers have accelerated their output to make up for the loss
of oil from Iraq and Kuwait.
   AAA said prices also fell this week for higher grades of
gasoline. The average price for a gallon of mid-grade unleaded was
$1.368, down 9.8 cents from Dec. 18. The average price for a gallon
of self-serve premium was $1.45, down 8 cents.
   The average price for self-serve regular gas was $1.287, down
7.4 cents.
   The AAA Fuel Gauge Report is based on a nationwide survey of
stations conducted by Computer Petroleum Corp. of St. Paul, Minn.
AAA is based in Orlando, Fla.

   Mayor Art Agnos today signed the nation's
strictest law regulating video display terminal use by workers,
despite a political rival's last-minute charges that the ordinance
is illegal.
   The law requires 15-minute breaks and other safety measures,
including proper lighting, anti-glare screens and adjustable
furniture and equipment for VDT users.
   Tom Hsieh, a city supervisor opposing the measure, charged
Wednesday that the ordinance violates the city charter. But
Jonathan Holtzman, special assistant in the city attorney's office,
said it clearly does not.
   ``I am gravely concerned that the city is about to enact a law
that is extremely vulnerable to legal challenge,'' said Hsieh.
   Hsieh said a section of the city charter mandates that
supervisors can't make changes in working conditions for city
employees until the city's civil service commission makes various
studies. But Holtzman said the section cited by Hsieh applies only
to changes in their pay.
   The law would take effect in 30 days. It applies to employees of
private businesses and city workers.
   Agnos said Sunday that he would sign the ordinance after his
staff, labor and businees officials reached agreement on
compromises on certain provisions that gave businesses four years
instead of two to comply.
   Opponents of the ordinance said the law would be so costly - an
estimated $36 million to about $70 million citywide - that it could
drive some business away.

   Consumer confidence edged lower in December but
Americans had a slightly more optimistic outlook for the economy in
the next six months, the Conference Board reported Thursday.
   The business-supported research group said its consumer
confidence index, compiled from a survey of consumers across the
country, slipped to 61.3 from 61.7 in November.
   A year ago, the index stood at 113.
   The index inched lower earlier this year as the economy weakened
and then plunged after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August. It
stood at 101.7 in July and fell to 84.7 in August.
   A lack of consumer confidence was cited consistently as the main
reason for a drop in retail spending after the Middle East crisis
began. Many retailers reported they had a difficult Christmas
season as consumers shopped frugally.
   The Conference Board survey found consumers expect to remain
very cautious in their spending. Of those questioned, 5.9 percent
said they planned to buy a car, down from 6.5 percent in November
and from more than 7 perct a year earlier.
   But the survey also found some easing in consumers' bleak
outlook. While 26 percent of those surveyed said they expected
business conditions to worsen over the next six months, that figure
was down from 30 percent in November.
   There was more pessimism about unemployment, as nearly 33
percent of the respondents said jobs are hard to come by, up from
29 percent in November.
   The consumer confidence survey was conducted by National Family
Opinion Inc. of Toledo, Ohio, which questioned 5,000 households.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed
moderately lower Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade, erasing
the previous day's gains amid profit-taking and reduced fears of
cold-weather damage to the winter wheat crop.
   Trading volume was light as many players remained on holiday

deliveries against the January contract on Monday, the first day
for traders to attempt physical delivery of soybeans purchased for
January delivery. The occasion is known as first notice day.
   At the close, wheat futures were unchanged to 3} cents lower

   Southwest Airlines is cutting fares between
Phoenix and seven other cities to $20, during what is traditionally
a slow time of year for the airline industry.
   The $20 fares are good each way between Phoenix and Las Vegas,
Albuquerque, El Paso, Los Angeles, San Diego, Oakland and Ontario,
Calif. The tickets must be purchased before Jan. 21 for travel from
Jan. 3 through April 5.
   Southwest is tying its promotion to a 20th anniversary
celebration, but industry observers see it as a way to fill planes,
grab some publicity and possibly force competitor America West
Airlines to sell seats at money-losing prices.
   ``It's a slow time of year, and crazy things happen during slow
times of the year,'' said Steve Litvin, president of USTS-Freedom
Travel, a travel agency in Phoenix.
   Don Valentine, vice president of marketing for Dallas-based
Southwest, said the airline was using Phoenix as a test market for
the $20 fares. He said he expected the promotion to increase
business on the routes and attract new customers.
   America West spokesman Dick Shimizu said his airline was
studying Southwest's move and ``will remain competitive.''

<TEXT>
   The labor market continues to weaken, judged by
the volume of help-wanted advertisements in newspapers around the
country, the Conference Board reported Thursday.
   The Board said ad volume declined last month in all nine major
regions, with the Pacific, East North Central and Middle Atlantic
regions posting the steepest drops.
   The Board's Help-Wanted Advertising Index stood at 108 in
November, down from 116 the previous month and a sharp 35 points
below the year-ago level. The seasonally adjusted index registered
100 in 1967.
   ``The labor market has been weakening for the last six months,
and it may be another six months before it turns around,'' said
Conference Board Economist Ken Goldstein.
   But he said the news ``sounds bleaker than it really is. Want-ad
volume is unlikely to lose another one-fifth of its total of the
next six months. In fact, we could see signs of a turnaround ...
six months from now, and maybe even sooner.''
   A survey of help-wanted ads in 51 newspapers nationwide revealed
that labor conditions in oil-producing states have held up better
than anywhere else, the Board said.
   Still, the regions reported ad declines of between 10.8 percent
for the Pacific region to a drop of 1.9 percent in the Mountain
region.
   Want-ad volume has proven to be sensitive to labor market
conditions. The Labor Department reported the nation's unemployment
rate registered 5.9 percent in November.

   The stock market's nervous system is a bank of

another site to avoid accident-induced shutdowns.
   Little known outside Wall Street, the Securities Industry

stock exchanges after the markets no longer could handle the
trading paperwork load manually.
   A transformer fire Thursday at SIAC delayed the start of trading

settlement of trades.
   In addition, SIAC also ties together data on securities listed
on the nation's regional exchanges and over-the-counter market,
though those trading systems can operate independently of SIAC.
   ``We're basically the industry processor for the U.S.A.'s stock
exchanges,'' said Richard E. Leyh, SIAC's executive vice president
and chief operations officer. ``Outside, the world sees the
exchanges. They don't necessarily see us standing behind the
exchanges.''
   Thursday's fire was caused by a transformer explosion shortly
after midnight. None of SIAC's computers were damaged, but fire
officials closed off the building while checking for chemical
contamination.
   It was the second fire at SIAC in 13 months. In November 1989,
the NYSE and Amex were shut down for one hour by an electrical
fire. In both instances, the lack of an off-site backup system
meant delays in restoring normal trading operations.
   SIAC - which is two-thirds owned by the NYSE and one-third by
the Amex - is moving its base of operations to a new facility
across New York harbor in Brooklyn deigned to avoid unforeseen
shutdowns.
   SIAC is shifting about half its computers to the new location
and designing the system so that in the event of a failure at one
site, the other site could be reconfigured handle the full
processing load. The new facility is expected to be fully
operational by mid-1992, Leyh said.
   ``Our goal is that in the event of a catastrophic failure we
would be back in business within a day,'' he said. ``In lesser
events we would be back sooner.''
   The Brooklyn and Manhattan systems will operate on separate
power and telephone grids served by different electric company
substations to minimize the possibility of both systems going down
because of an outage.
   In the 1989 fire, in a basement electrical vault, SIAC was
forced to switch to backup generators. Delays were caused because
some of SIAC's older computers needed 30 minutes or more to be
activated on the backup system. Most of the older models were
replaced this year, Leyh said.
   While the outages have illustrated the financial system's
vulnerability, some market experts said short shutdowns shouldn't
be cause for alarm.
   ``Technology brings a price,'' said William J. Breen, a finance
professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg Graduate School of
Management.
   ``There are snowstorms, power lines come down, the Federal
Reserve has to fiddle with the money supply because an airport got
closed,'' he said. ``I would doubt if there's a whole lot of people
who got hurt by the market not opening for an hour and a half this
morning.''

<HEAD>IBM Makes Comeback After Slashing Costs, Revamping Products</HEAD>

   A few years ago, some experts feared that
IBM, one of the nation's most important companies, had slipped into
a dangerous slump.
   Its products were outdated and overpriced, and its payroll and
cost structure too bloated to deal with a slowdown in computer
industry sales, these critics said.
   Instead of its sales growing 15 percent or better a year as IBM
predicted, annual growth averaged less than half that from 1984-89.
   IBM's profit fell from $6.6 billion in 1985 to $3.8 billion in
1989, and its stock price slipped from as high as $173 a share in
1987 to a low of $93 a share in December 1989.
   The downturn was troubling not just because International
Business Machines Corp. is the nation's fourth-largest industrial
company, but because IBM's health is a benchmark for the U.S.
economy and its technical prowess.
   Some said IBM - which employs more people than live in
Minneapolis - was too big and bureaucratic to change.
   But in the past year or so, the world's largest computer company
appears to have executed a neat turnaround.
   Its profit and stock price are on the rebound, its product
lineup has been revitalized and thousands of unneeded employees are
gone. IBM also has become more customer-oriented, helping dispel
its reputation as an arrogant giant, industry analysts say.
   ``In the mid-80s, other (computer) companies started to do well.
IBM was marking time,'' said Barry Bosak, an analyst at Smith
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. ``Now, in 1990, IBM seems to be doing
better in general than the computer industry.
   ``I'm impressed by the ability of IBM to make a good number of
cutbacks and at the same time roll out what is a fairly extensive
line of new computers,'' he added.
   IBM had been losing ground in the product area to nimbler,
younger competitors. Compaq Computer Corp. lured away corporate
customers for personal computers, while Sun Microsystems Inc.
outshined IBM in the fast-growing computer workstation market.
   In 1990, IBM replaced its slow-selling workstations with
machines that won critical praise and strong orders. It made a
promising return to the home computer market, while selling off its
low-tech typewriter business. Most important, it announced the
biggest overhaul of its mainframe computers since the 1960s.
   Mainframes, the room-sized computers that store huge amounts of
data for companies such as airlines, are IBM's most important
business. The machines and associated equipment and services
account for more than half of IBM's revenue and profit.
   Analysts say they generally are pleased with IBM's revamped
products. Rick Martin of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. calls it
the company's most competitive lineup since the early 1980s.
   Analysts also applaud the way IBM handled the transition to its
new mainframe line, announced in September. Such transitions to a
new generation of technology often disrupt orders while customers
await the announcement. While IBM felt that lag, it was not as
severe as some analysts expected.
   IBM is now ``shipping all we can build'' of the new mainframes,
said Bill Grabe, an IBM marketing vice president.
   IBM needed the new machines to meet increased competition for
its once-exclusive mainframe customers. Two U.S. companies that are
partially Japanese-owned, Hitachi Data Systems Corp. and Amdahl
Corp., offer competitive machines that are fully compatible with
IBM models.
   IBM's mainframes also face competition from the No. 2 computer
maker, Digital Equipment Corp., which began shipping its first
mainframes in 1990.
   In the past few years, IBM also has increased its presence in
software - an area of growing importance - by buying minority
stakes in dozens of small software houses. These companies have
developed programs that tailor IBM computers for specific
industries.
   Under Chairman John Akers, who took charge in 1986, IBM reduced
its worldwide payroll from a high of 407,000 that year to 383,000
at the end of 1989 through voluntary severance offers. The figure
is a few thousand lower now, though the company hasn't disclosed
the exact total.
   Under the most recent cutback, announced in December 1989, IBM
said it would eliminate 10,000 U.S. workers. The company took a
$2.4 billion charge against its 1989 profit to pay for the
severance deals, resulting in the steep earnings drop that year.
   IBM also has reassigned workers from factory floors and
headquarters to sales offices, where they are helping improve
customer service and beef up orders.
   IBM's transformation began after the company reported a 27
percent drop in earnings in 1986, which it blamed in part on a
downturn in the U.S. economy and the computer industry.
   ``We also did some real introspection and concluded that part of
the problem was ours,'' said Frank A. Metz Jr., IBM's chief
financial officer.
   That self-examination led to the recognition that IBM's overhead
was too costly. Its payroll and plants were at a level that
required annual revenue growth of 13 percent to 15 percent to turn
a profit, while revenue actually was growing at about half that
rate.
   IBM also decided it must ``re-emphasize our commitment to our
customer,'' Metz said in a recent interview at the company's
hilltop headquarters, about 25 miles north of New York City.
   ``We concluded that although our products were good, it was
taking us far too long to get our products to the marketplace, and
too often they weren't as responsive as they needed to be to our
customer requirements,'' he said.
   That led IBM to loosen the centralized decision-making that had
long been its hallmark.
   ``There are a lot of decisions made in this company today -
important decisions, operational decisions - that we're not
involved in here,'' Metz said.
   An association that represents IBM customers says it has noticed
the company's new attitude.
   ``The openness has changed tremendously,'' said Merrikay Lee,
secretary of Common, which represents users of IBM midrange
computers. ``They used to listen but never really incorporated
their customers into the fold. Now they're much more willing to
talk and listen.''
   Metz said the process of downsizing IBM will continue, though he
doesn't expect another major restructuring.
   IBM's moves already have boosted its profit. For the first nine
months of 1990, IBM earned $3.56 billion compared with $3.17
billion in the same period a year earlier.
   Analyst Cliff Friedman of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. predicts IBM will
earn $10.20 a share for 1990, up from the $9.05 a share IBM earned
in 1989 before the restructuring charge slashed profit to $6.47.
   IBM's improving fortunes have been reflected in its stock price,
which has risen to about $113 a share.
   Although rejuvenated, IBM isn't out of the woods. One looming
threat is the recession. Another is the increasing competition in
the computer industry as its growth rate slows.
   In addition, IBM's profit could be squeezed by the increasing
interest among computer uses for ``open'' systems, those that
follow industry standards so that machines from differ makers can
work together easily. Open-system computers have a lower profit
margin than proprietary models such as IBM's mainframes and
minicomputers.
   ``Over the long term, IBM's going to wind up losing market
share,'' claimed analyst Stephen Cohen of SoundView Financial Group
Inc. ``Industry (profit) margins are going to be declining because
it's a maturing industry. I think IBM is going to face some very
stiff competition.''

   Two U.S. communications companies, Millicom Inc.
and U S West Inc., said Thursday they have signed an agreement to
provide cellular telephone service in the Soviet Union, starting in
Moscow.
   The companies signed the agreement with the Soviet Ministry of
Communications last week, Millicom said. Also part of the pact is
Dr. Svyatoslav Fyodorov, a Soviet eye surgeon and entrepreneur who
helped negotiate the deal.
   The value of the agreement was not disclosed.
   The companies plan to provide cellular service in Moscow
starting in the third quarter of 1991. The exact role of each
partner has not been defined, said Millicom spokeswoman Andrea Van
Raalte.
   The group would build one of two cellular phone systems
envisioned for Moscow, Millicom said. The group would build systems
in other Soviet cities subject to the negotiation of further
agreements, it said.
   U S West and Millicom are the latest of a number of Western
phone companies that have signed agreements to modernize phone
systems in the former East bloc.

   The family of former President Lyndon Johnson has
put the KLBJ radio stations on the market, a company executive said
Thursday.
   John Barr, executive vice president of The LBJ Co., said the
family has retained the Ted Hepburn Co. to entertain offers for the
AM and FM stations.
   He said their value has been placed at $13.5 million.
   The Johnson family has owned the business for more than 40
years. The family tried to sell it in 1987 for $27.5 million, but
the deal fell through when The Chase Group, a New York-based
investment company, did not meet the deadline to complete the sale.
   Bill Jamar, whose Jamar and Associates handled the 1987 sales
attempt, said it would be hard to get $13.5 million in today's
economic climate.
   But Barr said, ``The stations are basically making money. They
always have.''

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar settled mostly lower in extremely
thin trading Thursday.
   Gold prices also were mostly lower. On the New York Commodity
Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery slipped 30 cents a troy
ounce to settle at $385.30. Republic National Bank quoted a late
bid for gold of $384.40, up 20 cents an ounce.
   A report showing U.S. durable goods orders fell a
steeper-than-expected 10.5 percent in November influenced trading.
Analysts had been expecting a decline of about 2.2 percent, and the
much larger drop fueled concerns that the U.S. recession is
deepening.
   European markets, which had closed for the Christmas holidays,
reopened Thursday to find traders mostly selling the dollar.
   Domestic trading was extremely light. ``We had about an hour's
worth of trading after the durable goods numbers, and that was it
for the whole day,'' said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at
Mitsubishi Bank Ltd.
   Despite the weakness of the durable goods report, it was ``not
enough to make people reopen their books and dump dollars before
the New Year,'' said Michael Malpede, an analyst at Refco Group
Ltd. in Chicago. He noted that a good portion of the decline
reflected auto plant shutdowns rather than declines in a variety of
industries.
   The German mark was boosted by the confirmation of Gennady I.
Yanayev as Soviet vice president. He was Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
choice for the newly created office, and the approval offered an
air of stability to the politically torn Soviet Union.
   ``The focus was on U.S. economic fundamentals, the Soviet Union
and the Persian Gulf crisis,'' Malpede said. ``The dollar has been
bouncing off that triad, with no clear direction in trading.''
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 136.65 yen, up 0.40 yen from
Wednesday's close. Later in London, it was quoted higher at 136.75
yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 136.40 yen, up from 136.10
yen on Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8870, compared
with $1.8740 late Monday. In New York, it cost $1.8895 to buy one
pound, more expensive than Wednesday's $1.8815.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates included: 1.5255 German marks, down from 1.5348;
1.3040 Swiss francs, down from 1.3082; 5.1935 French francs, down
from 5.2080; 1,151.75 Italian lire, down from 1,155.00, and 1.1616
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1595.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.5310 German marks, down from 1.5390; 1.3090
Swiss francs, down from 1.3120; 5.2050 French francs, down from
5.2200; 1.7292 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7345; 1,152.75 Italian
lire, down from 1,158.00; and 1.1618 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1601.
   Gold was quoted at a late bid price of $382.25 per troy ounce in
London, down from $383.00 bid per ounce late Monday. In Zurich, the
bid price was $382.20, down from $382.50 late Monday. Gold in Hong
Kong dropped 11 cents an ounce to close at $384.07.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $4.093 a troy ounce, down slightly
from Wednesday's $4.095. In London the metal traded at a bid price
of $4.08 a troy ounce, up from $4.04 on Monday.

   A transformer explosion and fire in Lower
Manhattan delayed stock trading nationwide for 90 minutes Thursday,
a reminder that Wall Street's sophisticated computer systems are
vulnerable to unforeseen calamities.
   The trading halt marked the third such disruption this year, but
stock exchange representatives emphasized that none of the problems
centered on their own computer operations.
   The fire at the 55 Water St. skyscraper in southern Manhattan
broke out shortly after midnight, sending smoke into the Securities
Industry Automation Corp., a joint venture between the New York and
American stock exchanges controlling the computer system that
supports trading.
   The New York and American exchanges were the first to announce
that the usual 9:30 a.m. opening would be delayed. But the nation's
regional stock exchanges also refrained from trading, bowing to a
request from the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   SEC spokeswoman Mary McCue said the regulatory authority wanted
all the markets to reopen at the same time to give all investors
equal opportunity to buy or sell.
   Regional exchanges, which include the Midwest, Pacific,
Cincinnati, Boston and Philadelphia exchanges, trade some of same
stocks as the New York and American exchanges, but they handle only
a small percentage of the total volume of stock traded on the major
exchanges.
   Hundreds of workers milled about the chilly streets while others
followed instructions on handwritten notes by the doors of the
building and reported for work elsewhere. For example Citibank, the
nation's biggest banking company which occupies several floors of
the building, relocated employees to other offices in the city.
   Despite the upheaval in the streets, market observers said the
fire did not cause too much of a problem for investors, since
trading is typically thin during the Christmas-New Year's holiday
week.
   ``Fortunately it happened at a time ... when there's very little
to do,'' said Michael Metz, a vice president at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.,
adding that most large institutional investors already have
realigned their portfolios ahead of the new year and were not
actively buying or selling stocks.
   Short-term traders and other professionals were the most
affected. ``With the market closed for part of the day, they have a
smaller arena in which to operate,'' Metz said. ``It amounts to an
unprofitable day.''
   Trading disruptions are relatively rare, but the Thursday delay
was the third this year. On Nov. 23, a power failure delayed
trading on the NYSE for 90 minutes shortly after the opening bell.
   On Aug. 13, a fire at a Con Edison power substation forced the
American Stock Exchange, New York Mercantile Exchange and other
futures markets in southern Manhattan to close by early afternoon,
but the New York Stock Exchange was unaffected.
   More than a year ago, another fire-related power problem at SIAC
briefly delayed NYSE trading.
   ``I'm surprised there isn't some failure-proof source of
power,'' Metz said.
   NYSE spokeswoman Sharon Gamsin said in the next 12 to 14 months,
SIAC will have a back-up facility across the East River in
Brooklyn.
   The facility, located at what is called the MetroTech complex,
will allow SIAC to switch to an alternative computing source, which
can process 500 million trades a day, in case of a fire or other
emergency.
   Though the blaze was under control at 3:16 a.m., officials
feared hazardous polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, may have
contaminated several floors of the 54-floor skyscraper. Samples of
the building were taken to an Environmental Protection Agency lab
for analysis, but the building was later found to be untainted by
the cancer-causing substance.
   SIAC was allowed to enter the building at midmorning, and its
computers were up and running by 11 a.m., when the New York and
American stock exchanges opened trading. The markets closed at the
normal 4 p.m. time.
   Trading in over-the-counter issues began as usual at 9:30 a.m.
Over-the-counter stock trading is conducted independently of the
NYSE and the American exchange. The National Association of
Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System, or NASDAQ, reports
quotes for over-the-counter stocks.
   Twenty-six firefighters and 14 others were treated for possible
exposure to PCBs as a result of the fire, said Lt. Jim Powell, a
New York City Fire Department spokesman. Four firefighters were
hospitalized.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Drop As Winterkill Fears Ease</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices fell Thursday on the Chicago Board of
Trade, erasing most of the market's recent gains amid reduced fears
of weather damage to the Great Plains winter wheat crop.
   Other grain and soybean futures also retreated.
   On other commodity markets, crude oil futures dropped; precious
metals were little changed; orange juice futures slipped; and
livestock and meat futures were mostly lower.
   Volume was light in most markets as many traders remained out on
holiday vacations.
   Wheat futures settled unchanged to 3} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March down 3} cents at $2.62\ a bushel;
corn was \ cent to 2 cents lower with March at $2.33 a bushel; oats
were } cent to 1} cents lower with March at $1.13 a bushel;
soybeans were 1} cents to 5\ cents lower with January at $5.61} a
bushel.
   The sell-off wiped out most of the 5.5-cent gain that March
wheat racked up in the three previous trading sessions on
speculation that several days of bitterly cold weather had caused
significant damage to winter wheat.
   Analysts said the downturn suggested the winterkill fears were
exaggerated.
   ``The feeling that there was a lot of damage done has started to
be dispelled,'' said Don Roose of U.S. Commodities Inc. in Des
Moines, Iowa.
   ``The wheat seed that is used nowadays has become fairly
resistant to these winter freezes,'' said Joel Karlin, a grains
analyst with Research Department Inc. in Chicago. ``You won't
really know how much winterkill there is until later in the year.''
   Roose said soybean prices were pressured by expectations for
heavy deliveries against the January contract on Monday, the first
opportunity for traders to attempt physical delivery of soybeans
purchased for January delivery. The occasion is known as first
notice day.
   Crude oil futures ended modestly lower on the New York
Mercantile Exchange after a day of erratic trading that reflected
mixed news from the Middle East.
   After the close, the American Petroleum Institute's weekly
inventories report said U.S. crude oil stocks rose by 3.3 million
barrels last week, a greater increase than most analysts had
expected.
   A 960,000-barrel decline in gasoline stocks and a 1.2
million-barrel drop in heating oil stocks were within expectations.
   Light sweet crude oil settled 1 cent to 21 cents lower with
February at $27.01 a barrel; heating oil was .38 cent lower to .17
cent higher with January at 80.88 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .16 cent to .50 cent higher with January at 68.64 cents a
gallon; natural gas was 3.9 cents lower to 1 cent higher with
February at $1.96 per 1,000 cubic feet.
   Gold and silver futures, which have mainly shadowed the crude
oil market since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, were little changed
in light trading on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   Gold settled 30 cents lower to 20 cents higher with December at
$385.30 a troy ounce; silver was 0.2 cent to 0.5 cent lower with
December at $4.093 a troy ounce.
   Orange juice futures fell moderately on the New York Cotton
Exchange as profit-taking ended a five-day rally linked to the
extensive frost damage sustained by the California orange crop.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice finished .40 cent to 1.6 cents
lower with January at $1.165 a pound.
   Livestock futures ended mostly lower on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange on profit-taking and slow cash markets.
   Pork bellies fell sharply in response to lower fresh-belly
prices and a weekly exchange report showing active movement of
bellies into commercial freezers outside of Chicago.
   Live cattle finished unchanged to .32 cent lower with February
at 77.25 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent lower to .02
cent higher with January at 89.20 cents a pound; live hogs were .23
cent lower to .10 cent higher with February at 48.82 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were 1.48 cents to 1.93 cents lower with
February at 62.87 cents a pound.

   Assets of the nation's 533 money market mutual
funds fell by $1.1 billion in the latest week to $427.90 billion,
the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The decline in the seven-day period ended Wednesday followed a
$1 billion rise in fund assets the previous week to a record
$429.01 billion. The Washington-based mutual fund trade group
originally reported fund assets rose $856.2 million to a record
$428.86 billion but later revised it upward.

   The stock market posted a moderate loss Thursday
in a quiet session shortened by problems that resulted from an
overnight transformer explosion in the financial district.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had risen 15.84
points on Wednesday, dropped 11.63 points to 2,625.50.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
598 up, 892 down and 514 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 102.90 million
shares, against 78.73 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 128.88 million shares.
   The New York and American stock exchanges began trading at 11
a.m. EST, 90 minutes later than usual, after operations were
restored at the Securities Industry Automation Corp.
   SIAC reports and records transactions that take place in issues
listed on the NYSE and Amex.
   Once activity got going, analysts said it was hard to discern
any clear-cut shifts in the mood among investors, even though
interest rates fell in the credit markets.
   Prices of long-term government bonds rose about $5 for each
$1,000 in face value, reducing their yields to the 8.24
percent-8.26 percent range.
   Often at this time of year there is much excitement about the
so-called January effect - a historical tendency for stocks in
general, and smaller issues in particular, to rally once the
pressure of December tax selling is lifted from the market.
   But interest in such phenomena apparently has been muted this
winter by uncertainty over the direction of events in the Middle
East.
   Losers among the blue chips included American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, down &lsqb; at 30&lsqb;; General Electric, down &lsqb; at 57\; Exxon,
down { at 51\, and General Motors, down &rsqb; at 34&rsqb;.
   Tiffany &amp; Co. fell 2\ to 35 on top of a 4&rsqb;-point loss Wednesday,
when the company said its holiday sales in the United States came
in below expectations.
   Bank stocks were also weak. J.P. Morgan dropped 2 to 44;
BankAmerica } to 26{; First Chicago 1\ to 16{; Citicorp \ to 13;
Chase Manhattan { to 10&lsqb;, and Manufacturers Hanover &rsqb; to 22}.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $18.82 billion, or 0.61
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.12 to 179.48.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 2.72 to 384.37, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 2.56 at 328.29.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slipped 1.35 to 371.05. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 303.67, down 1.32.

<HEAD>Delta Asks Federal Hearing on Pan Am, TWA London Route Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delta Air Lines Thursday asked the U.S.
Department of Transportation to hold a formal hearing on plans by
Pan Am and TWA to sell trans-Atlantic air routes to the country's
two largest airlines.
   Chicago-based UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines, agreed in
October to buy most of Pan Am's London routes and other assets for
$400 million. Fort Worth-based American said in mid-December it
would buy TWA's routes to London and other overseas points for $445
million.
   The deals hinge on whether American and United will be allowed
to serve London's Heathrow Airport. Britain has resisted American
carriers' attempts to fly to Heathrow, forcing them to use less
convenient Gatwick.
   Delta is concerned that it and other U.S. carriers will bear the
burden of any concessions the U.S. government makes to get British
support for the deals.
   ``The DOT should not approve these transactions until it knows
what `price' must be paid to the British to obtain their
approval,'' Delta said in its filing.
   The transfers ``are so massive that they raise fundamental
policy issues affecting competition and market structure
internationally and domestically,'' Delta Chairman and President
Ronald W. Allen said. ``Never before has such an enormous
restructuring of the international air travel market structure been
proposed.''
   Delta is seeking to add to its two U.S.-London routes.
   If the deals are completed, United and American would both serve
London from Los Angeles and two New York-area airports - Kennedy
and Newark.
   American also would fly between London and Chicago, Boston,
Philadelphia, St. Louis and Baltimore, while United also would fly
between London and Washington, San Francisco and Seattle.

   Crude oil prices fell slightly Thursday in
extremely light trading that brokers attributed to little
significant news from the Persian Gulf.
   Unleaded gasoline prices rallied on reports that refineries were
cutting back production because of marginally reduced demand,
traders said.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light sweet crude for
February delivery fell 21 cents to $27.01 per 42-gallon barrel
after rising $1.30 on Wednesday. Other contract months also fell.
   ``The market was trendless,'' said Christian Gohler, a trader
with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   Traders said a statement by Iraq that it was ready for ``serious
and constructive'' dialogue on the Middle East crisis was offset by
a denial it was launching a new peace initiative ahead of a United
Nations deadline.
   The U.N. has given Iraq until Jan. 15 to withdraw from Kuwait,
and has authorized the use of force after that date to evict Iraqi
forces.
   Furthermore, President Bush said there had been no progress in
efforts to work out a date for Secretary of State James A. Baker
III to visit Baghdad to discuss a peaceful situation to the gulf
situation.
   The crude oil market ``is just drifting lower as the whole Jan.
15 date looks like it could be pushed back. That has had a calming
effect on the market,'' said Brian Tagler, a broker with Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc.
   Crude oil prices have risen on the prospects of war since oil
supplies likely would be curtailed during a war, increasing their
value.
   Market professionals also said crude oil contracts were being
sold in advance of the end of the month and the year as traders
liquidate positions.
   Among refined products traded on the Mercantile Exchange,
unleaded regular gasoline for January delivery rose .50 cent to
68.64 cents a gallon after a 1.90-cent rise Wednesday. Later months
also were higher.
   Tagler said oil refineries reported they were reducing gasoline
production because gasoline per barrel was selling for only
slightly higher than crude oil, due to slightly lower demand. Lower
production means less supplies, which pushes prices higher.
   Home heating oil futures fell 0.38 cent to 80.88 cents per
gallon on contracts for January delivery after rising 2.32 cents on
Wednesday. Traders attributed the drop to reports that cold weather
would not last in the Northeast. Later months were mixed.
   Natural gas for February delivery was down 3.9 cents at $1.960
per 1,000 cubic feet. Later months were mostly higher.
   After the market closed, the American Petroleum Institute
reported that the nation's crude oil inventories rose in the week
ending Dec. 21 to 334.7 million barrels from 331.5 million barrels
the previous week. But that was still down sharply from 342.0
million barrels a year ago.
   Crude oil imports rose in the week to 5.6 million barrels daily
from 5.1 million barrels the previous week, API said. Imports were
lower, though, than 6.2 million barrels daily a year ago.
   Among other products, API reported that distillate inventories,
which include home heating oil, fell to 131.5 million barrels from
132.6 million barrels a week ago. But inventories were higher than
112.2 million barrels a year earlier.
   Gasoline inventories dropped to 223.7 million barrels from 224.6
million barrels a week ago, but were up from 221.7 million barrels
a year earlier, API said.
