<HEAD>Charges Dismissed Against `Ill Wind' Figure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge dismissed new charges against
a figure in the defense industry probe Friday, saying a second
indictment was an act of revenge because the man was appealing his
conviction on earlier charges.
   Thomas E. Muldoon, a former consultant to Norden Systems,
already had been convicted on eight felonies, including conspiracy
and bribery of a public official. Soon after his attorney filed an
appeal on that conviction, Muldoon was indicted on charges of
trafficking in secret defense information.
   U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. in Alexandria, Va.,
wrote that there was ``a realistic likelihood of vindictiveness on
the part of the United States in causing the return of the present
indictment in retaliation for the defendant Thomas E. Muldoon's
going to trial or noting an appeal for his prior conviction or
both.''
   Muldoon, 60, was sentenced to 27 months in prison and fined
$10,000 for his conviction arising from the investigation of fraud
in defense procurement, code named ``Ill Wind.''
   Muldoon's lawyer, Albert J. Ahern Jr., told The Washington Post
that the second indictment against his client was to send a message
to other defendants in the case to ``take the plea agreement as
tendered, or face a splitting of the charges and multi-count
indictments as the certain consequence.''

   A mistrial was declared Friday in the bank
fraud trial of U.S. Rep. Harold Ford after the jury said it was
hopelessly deadlocked.
   The congressman was accused of taking political favors in the
form of loans that prosecutors said he was never expected to repay
to Tennessee banking brothers Jake and C.H. Butcher Jr.
   Jury foreman H.O. Robinson reported the deadlock after U.S.
District Judge Odell Horton removed one of the 12 panel members for
failing to disclose a past felony conviction. That development did
not figure in the mistrial.
   Ford, a 44-year-old Memphis Democrat, had been on trial since
Feb. 12 on charges of conspiracy, bank and mail fraud. A conviction
could have brought a sentence of up to 95 years.
   The congressman said he regarded the mistrial as a victory,
though he had hoped for acquittal.
   ``I'm hopeful now that I can put this episode behind me,'' Ford
said.
   But U.S. Attorney John Gill in Knoxville said there would be
another trial.
   ``The only thing I can say is we had a case we felt we were
obligated to bring based on the evidence we had,'' Gill said.
   Ford stood trial with former Butcher accountant David Crabtree
and former Butcher lawyers Karl Schledwitz and Douglas Beaty.
   Ford, the state's only black member of Congress, has complained
often since his indictment that he is the victim of racist
prosecutors, an allegation the government has denied.
   The government called 29 witnesses in the case. The defense did
not call any, and Ford said he decided not to testify because he
regarded the government's case as weak.
   On Wednesday, after their first two days of deliberations,
jurors returned to the courtroom to report they were deadlocked.
Horton told them it was too early to give up work.
   Before the mistrial was declared Friday, assistant U.S. Attorney
Dan Clancy asked Horton to question juror Juanita Ruffin because
the government believed she had a criminal record that she did not
disclose during jury selection.
   Every juror picked for the trial signed a form on which they
answered a variety of questions, including whether they had ever
been convicted of a crime.
   Horton confronted Mrs. Ruffin in the courtroom about her record
and she acknowledged she had been convicted in 1970 in connection
with the theft of $160. She said she was placed on probation for
that felony offense.
   Mrs. Ruffin also said she was convicted twice for shoplifting in
the 1970s.
   Horton asked her why she didn't disclose the felony conviction
during jury selection. She said she thought she didn't have to
because the offenses occurred more than 10 years earlier.
   While being questioned, Mrs. Ruffin said the jury was split on
reaching a verdict by a vote of 9-3. She did not say if that vote
was in favor of acquittal or conviction.
   The jury was down to 11 members when the mistrial was declared,
but lawyers said the judge could have allowed the deliberations to
continue.
   First elected to congress in 1974, Ford has faced little
opposition since then for his 9th Congressional District seat.
   He was charged with 19 criminal counts in an indictment handed
down by a grand jury in Knoxville in 1987.
   His co-defendants, accused of helping him get and hde Butcher
money, faced charges of conspiracy and mail fraud, five counts for
Crabtree and 16 each for Beaty and Schledwitz.
   C.H. Butcher Jr. was brought to a nearby jail in Wynne, Ark.,
but was never asked to testify. He and Jake, a two-time candidate
for Tennessee governor, are serving 20-year prison terms for bank
fraud.
   The 1983 collapse of their banking chain was one of the worst in
U.S. financial history.
   The government said Ford and his family drew Butcher loans
totaling more than $1 million between 1976 and 1982, but Ford put
the total at $650,000. He said those debts were settled.

<HEAD>Despite Wide Publicity, `Twin Peaks' Continues Ratings Drop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC's ``Twin Peaks'' is continuing its downward
slide in the ratings despite being one of TV's most written-about
new shows this year, Nielsen audience estimates showed Friday.
   Ratings for Thursday's episode showed that it was seen in nine
million fewer homes than the two-hour April 8 premiere of the David
Lynch series. The premiere was seen in more than 19.4 million homes
and ranked fifth nationally in ratings for that week.
   Although its 11.3 rating made the show second in ratings in its
one-hour time period Thursday, it only drew 18 percent of the
audience then, compared to 33 percent for the show's premiere.
   NBC's ``Cheers'' and ``Wings'' easily beat ``Twin Peaks'' on
Thursday, averaging a 19.4 rating. CBS' ``Falcon Crest'' was a
distant third with an 8.1 average. Each ratings point represents
921,000 homes.
   ``Twin Peaks,'' a surreal soap opera set in the Pacific
Northwest, has been acclaimed by most critics. But it also has
steadily lost audiences each week since its much-publicized
premiere.
   ``I think what's happening is that the show is solidifying
around its core audience'' of young adults, said Alan Wurtzel,
senior vice president for research at ABC. He said he thought its
ratings will stabilize now.
   The show has lost most of its viewers in two categories, women
over 50 and men over 35, he said.
   But it also has lost occasional viewers of television ``who may
have watched (the show) becase of all the hype and word of mouth''
about the series, he said. ``I think what you're seeing is the
inevitable shakeout.''
   Although the ``Twin Peaks'' premiere did much better than ABC
had expected, ``to a certain extent I'm disappointed that it didn't
hold the higher numbers'' in episodes shown afterwards, he said.

   A 15-year-old girl who said she was
kidnapped, chained to a tree and raped repeatedly for three weeks
told police she escaped and killed her captor with his own shotgun
while he slept.
   Her escape prompted a search Friday for remains of two other
missing girls after police found a crudely drawn map suggesting two
girls had been killed and dismembered.
   The map was discovered at the LaRue County campsite of Phillip
E. Clopton, 39, of Louisville, who was found dead Thursday after
the Louisville girl called the State Police from a store several
miles away.
   Kentucky State Police Detective Robert Foster said the girl who
shot Clopton initially had left Louisville with him willingly.
   ``But there obviously came time when she wanted to get away,''
Foster said.
   The girl's 18-year-old sister, however, told The Courier-Journal
of Louisville that her sister was abducted.
   ``She didn't run away,'' her sister said. ``Everybody thought
she ran away, but she didn't.''
   Another man, 41-year-old James R. Cable, was arrested Thursday
night in Louisville and charged with first-degree rape and sodomy
in connection with the case. Cable was being held in the LaRue
County jail under $250,000 bond on each count.
   Edlin said Cable wasn't suspected in the killings but may have
distributed the body parts. His relationship with Clopton, who had
been previously imprisoned for sodomy and rape, was not immediately
clear.
   A journal found at the campsite chronicled ``at least three
homicides in ... Jefferson County,'' located about 50 miles
northeast of the search area, said state police Lt. Wayne Edwards.
It contained ``some names of missing juveniles,'' he said.
   The Louisville girl, who was returned to her father, told police
she had been held against her will for three weeks, chained to a
tree and raped repeatedly.
   The girl said she took a shotgun while the man slept in a tent
and killed him with a single shot to the head.
   A police report didn't indicate how she freed herself, said
LaRue County Sheriff Merle Edlin.
   ``Apparently he didn't keep her chained at all times,'' Edlin
said. ``I think she stayed there under threats, under fear for her
life.''
   Authorities unsuccessfully searched a three-county area in
central Kentucky on Friday for the bodies of the two other missing
girls.
   They tried to follow a map roughly sketched in pen on a piece of
typing paper with the girls' names and the spots in which various
body parts supposedly were buried.
   The task was difficult because the map was ``not too detailed''
and covered areas in LaRue, Nelson and Hardin counties, Edlin said.
   At the campsite Friday, police found two footlockers full of
canned goods and other supplies and a makeshift toilet. A nearby
creek served as a cooler. There were also cooking supplies,
sleeping bags, clothing and survival books.

   With a third presidential candidate
assassinated, Colombia's government refused Friday to put off next
month's election and vowed to keep up the fight against drug
traffickers.
   A telefaxed communique, purportedly from the Medellin drug
cartel, denied responsibility Friday for the assassination of
presidential candidate Carlos Pizarro, who died in a hail of
bullets Thursday aboard a Colombian jetliner carrying 97 people.
   But on Thursday, within hours of Pizarro's assassination, a man
had called the national radio network station Caracol and related
in detail how the cartel had allegedly ordered the former
guerrilla's killing.
   The authenticity of neither claim could be verified. That is not
the first time there have been contradictory communiques, verbal
and faxed, claiming and and then denying responsibility for
assassinations and terrorist acts.
   Friday's telefax accused police of instigating violence in order
to force the government to continue its crackdown on traffickers,
and accused the police of putting out false communiques purported
to be from the cartel.
   The August assassination of another candidate, Sen. Luis Carlos
Galan of the governing Liberal Party, prompted the government to
launch a U.S.-backed crackdown on Colombia's cocaine cartels.
   Since then, drug traffickers have killed more than 230 people,
including judges, politicians, policemen, soldiers, newspaper
employees and two other presidential candidates.
   Leaders of the leftist Patriotic Union Party, whose candidate
was slain last month, urged the government to cancel the May 27
vote.
   But Interior Minister Horacio Serpa told reporters Friday that
the elections will not be postponed or canceled. In a televised
speech late Thursday, Serpa said the government will fight
terrorists ``without rest.''
   On Friday, thousands of men, women and children filed past
Pizarro's coffin, displayed in an open patio in the Congress
building. Supporters of Pizarro's M-19 movement burned buses and
threw rocks at police in clashes in several cities.
   Hundreds of leftist guerrillas belonging to the M-19 rebel group
laid down their arms last month and formed a political party with
Pizarro as its presidential candidate. Government officials had
said Pizarro could have helped mediate peace agreements with other
leftist insurgents.
   Governing party candidate Cesar Gaviria, the presidential
front-runner, suspended campaign activities following the Pizarro
killing. In a radio interview, he condemned the killing as another
act by ``powerful organizations'' trying to impose an ``empire of
evil and crime.''
   The other candidates are Alvaro Gomez Hurtado and Rodrigo
Lloreda, both of the Conservative Party.
   Gomez, suggesting that Barco does not have the confidence of
Colombia's military, urged the president Friday to name a three-man
council to run Colombia's security forces. He said such a move
would help ensure peace in the last month of the presidential
campaign.
   Barco, through a spokesman, rejected the proposal.
   The Patriotic Union's presidential candidate, Bernardo
Jaramillo, was fatally wounded March 22 at the Bogota airport by an
assassin with a machine gun.
   Pizarro's killer, 25-year-old Alvaro Rodriguez, was sitting two
rows behind Pizarro on the flight and apparently retrieved the
machine gun from an airplane bathroom before returning to his seat,
Capt. Fabio Munevar told Caracol.
   Minutes later, he stood up, pulled the weapon from his black
leather jacket, leaned forward and fired at Pizarro's head from
about a foot away, Munevar said. Pizarro's bodyguards immediately
killed the assassin.
   The plane, en route to the Caribbean coastal city of
Barranquilla, returned immediately to Bogota. Pizarro died about an
hour later at a hospital. The Bogota morgue said he was struck by
13 bullets.
   Two men with machine guns were arrested at Barranquilla airport,
a police spokesman there said. They apparently were part of an
assassination squad with orders to kill Pizarro if he survived the
flight, police said.
   In another development, church officials in Medellin said they
had foiled a plan to kill Colombia's Roman Catholic prelate,
Cardinal Alfonso Lopez Trujillo.
   The city's Catholic church said it discovered the plan to kill
Lopez Trujillo after intercepting messages on a radio frequency
used by the men plotting the crime.
   Three men disguised as police agents entered Lopez Trujillo's
offices on Wednesday and Thursday asking for the prelate, but he
was not in, said the church statement late Thursday. Lopez is
archbishop of Medellin, the country's second-largest city, and
chairman of Colombia's Bishops Conference.

   East German police blasted their way into
three abandoned buildings to arrest 19 right-wing radicals,
confiscating weapons and Nazi paraphernalia, the state-run ADN news
agency said.
   The report said police had to use explosive devices to force
their way into the blocked entrances of the buildings in East
Berlin's Lichtenberg district on Friday.
   The report did not further describe the Nazi material.
   It said those arrested also had material from the extreme-right
Republican party, which surpised West Germans last year by winning
seats in several local elections. The party was banned from taking
part in East Germany's first free elections on March 18.
   Officials suspect those arrested of taking part in a rampage a
week ago in which passers-by were attacked in East Berlin's main
square, Alexanderplatz, ADN said.
   Police at the time said about 300 soccer rowdies were joined in
the melee by groups of neo-Nazi skinheads shouting tributes to
Adolf Hitler on the 101st anniversary of his birthday.
   Two people were seriously hurt and four policemen suffered
lesser injuries in the April 20 fracas.

   An instructor of metaphysics, questioned after
nine people associated with her died during a 13-year period, has
been the victim of a witch hunt, her attorney says.
   ``It's Salem all over,'' Fred Time, attorney for Terri Hoffman,
said Friday. ``They've called her a Manson, a Jones in Guyana. It's
crazy, without facts, and a defamation of character.''
   Dallas County District Attorney John Vance said Thursday that
prosecutors lack evidence to send the matter to a grand jury for a
possible criminal indictment.
   The case had been set for presentation next week and subpoenas
had been issued to witnesses, including Ms. Hoffman. Those
subpoenas have been canceled.
   ``I have to remain calm and quiet,'' said Ms. Hoffman, who
referred questions to Time. ``But one of these days I will tell my
story.''
   Prosecutors began looking into Ms. Hoffman's affairs after a
former college professor and his wife who followed her teachings
were found dead last fall. Police said two may have killed
themselves.
   Four other followers of Ms. Hoffman have committed suicide,
including two of her husbands. Two other followers died in apparent
accidents, as did the housekeeper of one of the followers.
   Some accounts of the case have included mention of Ms. Hoffman's
son, who died on the job in a construction accident. His death did
not come up in the investigation.
   Some of the followers had given or bequeathed her money and
property.
   Ms. Hoffman ran a concern called Conscious Development of Body,
Mind and Soul Inc., through which she sold books and tapes. She ran
classes on meditation and spiritual sessions.
   Assistant District Attorney Cecil Emerson, who directed the
investigation of Ms. Hoffman, said earlier this year that he was
trying to determine whether ``mind control'' could legally be
blamed for contributing to a death.
   After Thursday's announcement, Emerson said: ``I would just hope
that if something further presents itself, we will consider it.''
   Ms. Hoffman still faces a civil lawsuit filed by two
stepchildren, who claim she contributed to and profited from their
father's September 1988 suicide and the deaths of six other
associates. Trial is scheduled in August.

   The presidential runoff election between
novelist Mario Vargas Llosa and agricultural engineer Alberto
Fujimori will probably be held June 3, the National Election Board
says.
   Official results of the April 8 general elections will be
announced over the weekend, board spokesman Juan Chavez Molina said
in a radio interview on Friday.
   Peru's constitution says at least four weeks must elapse between
the release of the official vote count and the runoff election.
   Fujimori won a surprising 30 percent of the vote to Vargas
Llosa's 32 percent in the April 8 balloting, and recent polls
suggest Fujimori now has a strong lead.
   Both candidates have been in virtual seclusion since the April
election. Vargas Llosa's aides have said he will probably begin
campaigning next week.

year?
   The value of each card? ``I think it's up to $600 now. Something

   Jackson has a lot of memorabilia from his own career in his auto

   ``I buy for investment,'' Jackson said. ``I buy Hall of Famers

Campanella. I've got a 1951 Mickey Mantle card.''
   Jackson, now a broadcaster for the California Angels, got his

   Four cars belonging to comedian Redd Foxx,

his tax debt, the Internal Revenue Service says.
   Foxx and the IRS clashed over $755,166 in back taxes for 1983,
1984 and 1986, an agency spokeswoman says.
   All the IRS left was Foxx' bed when they raided his Las Vegas
home in November. A truckload of his personal property was returned
after his attorneys successfully argued in court that the
possessions were protected under a bankruptcy reorganization plan.
   The IRS spokeswoman said a 1927 Model T, a 1975 Panther, a 1983

and will be auctioned in Las Vegas, along with his Vespa motor

   Country music fans know singer Clint Black
best for his single, ``A Better Man,'' and his album, ``Killin'
Time.'' That's because he has no other tunes out there in radio
land.
   The album, which contains the single, is Black's first. But the
singer's mantel piece already is crowded with spanking new awards
from the Academy of Country Music.
   The 28-year-old former ironworker earned four of the 12 major
trophies passed out during the academy's awards show Wednesday
night.
   Black was named top male vocalist, top new male vocalist and got
single record of the year and album of the year.
   ``One thing I always felt was that I wouldn't go hungry with my
singing. I knew that,'' Black said Wednesday night.
   And Black already has some advice for young singers and
musicians.
   ``Make sure you've got a good manager,'' he said. ``You will end
up with a good label and you'll have somebody to watch out for your

   A radical opposition politician will join
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other top Communist leaders
Tuesday to view the annual May Day parade through Red Square,
officials said.
   Gavriil Popov, the newly elected mayor of Moscow, will join
officials viewing the spectacle from atop the Lenin mausoleum,
Moscow Communist Party chief Yuri A. Prokofiev told a news
conference Friday.
   Popov was elected on April 20 by the new city council, which was
swept by his Democratic Russia bloc of reformists in elections in
March. He is a leader of the Inter-Regional Group, the
parliamentary opposition that Gorbachev frequently has denounced.
   In pre-glasnost days, the lineup of leaders on hand for the May
Day parade was scrutinized by Kremlin-watchers, who speculated on
which officials were in or out of favor according to where they
stood.
   The Communist Party will help organize May Day events but not
dominate planning as in past years, Prokofiev said, and the columns
of marchers will gather freely to converge on Red Square instead of
being tightly controlled by party committees.

   Education officials approved a plan for
rewriting New York's elementary and high-school history lessons to
include more about the contributions of minority Americans.
   The plan calls for appointment of a 20-member committee of
academics and others to decide on such matters as teacher
retraining and selection of textbooks for the nation's
third-largest public school system.
   It was approved Friday by the state Board of Regents at the
request of Education Commissioner Thomas Sobol, who said his staff
has already held talks with educators in other states about
approaching textbook publishers.
   The board approved the idea of rewriting the history curriculum
in February and on Friday endorsed Sobol's blueprint for getting
the job done by 1992.
   The vote followed more of the acrimonious debate that erupted
following release last summer of a report by another
Sobol-appointed committee, which charged the state's textbooks were
filled with ``hidden assumptions of white supremacy.''
   That report said New York's history courses minimize the
contributions of minorities and largely ignore the wrongs committed
against nonwhites by whites. One of the reasons minority children
do poorly in school is because they don't read about their
ancestors in history texts, the report said.
   Without naming the review committee, Sobol set strict guidelines
on who it would include: elementary, middle and high school
teachers, school administrators, department heads, college
professors and scholars in social studies.
   Committee members will be appointed on the basis of ``racial and
ethnic diversity,'' Sobol said. The 17-member committee that
delivered the original critique of state's curriculum included one
white member.
   One regent, former teacher Adelaide Sanford of New York City,
worried that the new committee would water down recommendations
made by last summer's task force. She accused the regents of
retreating from a commitment to wipe bias from schools because of
concern about inflammatory language in the report.
   A representative of New York state's largest teachers union
urged a careful approach to the rewrite.
   ``I have grave concerns that we maintain the theory that we as
Americans share a common culture,'' said Antonia Cortese, first
vice president of New York State United Teachers. ``Our very basis
for a democracy is tolerance for other people. It's not
separatism.''
   The regents approved the plan on a unanimous voice vote. Sanford
sat silent.
   Sobol said in February that he had begun discussions with
educators in other states, including California, about presenting a
common front in requesting changes from textbook publishers. Ahead
of New York, Texas has the nation's largest school system and
California's is second.

<HEAD>Legislation Sought to Take Away Discretion on Targeting Unfair
Traders</HEAD>

   Some members of Congress, upset over President
Bush's removal of Japan from a ``hit list'' of unfair traders, are
introducing legislation to take away the president's discretion in
the matter.
   The bill is just one example of the firestorm created by the
administration's decision Friday to remove Japan from a list of
countries deemed to have erected the most offensive barriers to the
sale of U.S. products.
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., took to the Senate floor to declare
that he was ``thunderstruck'' by the action.
   ``Excuse me, Mr. President, but this boggles the mind,'' he
said. ``Letting Japan off the hook is a serious mistake and I think
Congress ought to take a look at it.''
   The dispute involves the toughest section of the 1988 trade law,
known as Super 301. It required the administration to target
countries in 1989 and 1990 for intensive negotiations aimed at
removing trade barriers.
   If the negotiations were unsuccessful, then the administration
had the power to retaliate with higher U.S. tariffs on imports from
the offending country.
   Last year, the administration named Japan, Brazil and India. But
this year, Bush said he was retaining only India because of that
country's refusal to remove its barriers to foreign investment and
foreign insurance companies.
   The administration dropped Japan and Brazil from the list
because of market-opening moves they have made.
   While the Super 301 provision was due to expire after this year,
several members of Congress said they planned to push for it to be
extended indefinitely, thus forcing the administration to face the
question of targeting Japan in future years.
   Two senators, Democrat Carl Levin of Michigan and Republican
Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, said they planned to introduce a
bill taking away the administration's discretion over whether to
target Japan.
   Their measure would require the president to target any country
for negotiations if its trade surplus accounted for 15 percent or
more of America's overall trade deficit.
   Last year, that provision would have only applied to Japan.
America's $49 billion deficit with Japan accounted for 45 percent
of the total U.S. trade deficit of $109 billion.
   Owen Bieber, president of the United Auto Workers, supported a
move to limit the president's discretion, saying that the
administration's decision Friday added ``insult to injury by
reaching the preposterous conclusion that Japan suddenly deserves a
clean bill of trade health.''
   But the administration defended its action, saying that
targeting Tokyo again would have undermined the efforts of Japanese
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu to reform his country's trade
practices.
   ``We believe that the most effective way to achieve results is
through cooperation, not confrontation,'' said U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said the message to Japan
was: ``Congratulations on a job well done to date.''
   The administration pledged to keep pressure on Japan to live up
to its commitments including insisting that monitoring provisions
be placed in an agreement reached April 5 to attack a broad array
of structural barriers blocking American and other foreign
companies from doing business in Japan.
   But many members of Congress accused the administration of
making a serious tactical error. They said removing Japan from the
target list took pressure off Kaifu's government.
   ``When we have a persistent $49 billion trade deficit with Japan
and that nation will not abide by a variety of agreements, freeing
them from the threat of trade sanctions makes no objective sense,''
said House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt.
   A year ago, Japan was cited for barriers to sales of U.S.-made
supercomputers, satellites and wood products. In the past month,
U.S. and Japanese negotiators have reached market-opening
agreements in all three areas.
   Brazil was targeted for restrictive import licensing practices.
Hills said recently enacted legislation in that country should meet
U.S. concerns in this area.
   But India, which was cited last year for a ban on operations of
foreign private insurance companies and for controls on foreign
investment that distort trade, has refused to make concessions. The
1990 target list names those barriers again.
   The Indian government issued a statement saying it would
continue to refuse to ``negotiate bilaterally under threat of
sanctions.''
   Members of Congress said it made no sense to target India, with
its modest $850 million trade surplus with the United States, and
neglect Japan, whose trade surplus is more than 50 times higher.
   In a separate action Friday, the administration said it was not
targeting any country for possible sanctions relating to violations
of U.S. copyright and patent protections.
   However, it placed four countries _ Brazil, India, China and
Thailand _ on a ``priority watch list'' as countries deserving
``special attention.''
   Another 19 countries with lesser problems were placed on a watch
list. They were Argentina, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, Greece,
Indonesia, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan,
Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Taiwan, Turkey, Venezuela and
Yugoslavia.

   The chairman of a Soviet parliamentary
delegation says he will try to find out which Soviet official
rejected offers of international aid after the 1986 explosion at
the Chernobyl nuclear reactor.
   With the full dimensions of the Chernobyl disaster now becoming
clear, the Supreme Soviet has reversed course and is urgently
seeking scientific, medical and material aid from the world
community.
   At a news conference at the Soviet Embassy on Friday, five
Soviet parliamentary deputies said the official secrecy that
shrouded the aftermath of the April 26, 1986, fire and explosion at
the Chernobyl reactor was a damaging mistake because it masked the
scope and scale of the disaster.
   In addition, they said efforts to clean up radiation
contamination and deal with the medical effects of the accident
might have been far more advanced by now if most foreign assistance
had not been rejected.
   The radiation that spewed from the plant poisoned millions of
acres of farmland and forests in the Ukraine alone. It is now
believed to pose a potential health threat to at least 4 million
Soviets, especially children, pregnant women and the elderly.
   Delegation members said cases of leukemia and thyroid cancer are
appearing.
   And scores of thousands of homes and apartments will have to be
found _ and new jobs as well _ for those evacuated from
contaminated regions.
   ``I know there were offers of help from foreign organizations,
but they were turned down,'' said Kakimbek S. Salykov, the
delegation leader and chairman of the Supreme Soviet's Committee on
Ecology and Rational Use of Natural Resources.
   ``We are going to investigate who was the person who ruled that
such offers be turned down,'' he said.
   Salykov contrasted the aftermath of Chernobyl to the earthquake
that devastated large sections of Soviet Armenia on Dec. 7, 1988,
and triggered an outpouring of aid from around the world.
   He said he believes the difference in the official attitude was
caused by the fact that Chernobyl occurred at the beginning of
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or
openness.
   ``The earthquake occurred when the policies of openness and
reform were quite well developed,'' he said. ``So all offers were
accepted.''
   Lev A. Kuznetsov, a member of the delegation, said it is now
clear that in the case of Chernobyl, ``The assistance required from
the world community will be required for a long period of time.''
   ``It is very sad for us that it is four years after the
catastrophe that we parliamentarians have to talk to you like
that,'' he said.
   As to the Chernobyl reactor, it is considered obsolete and
``accident prone'' and will be shut down permanently either this
year or in 1991, said Yuri N. Shcherbak, another deputy from the
Supreme Soviet.
   ``But it will not be closed today or tomorrow,'' he said. ``Very
great preparatory work is needed.''

<HEAD>Auditors Cite Potentially Lethal Problems at Arms Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Managers of the Savannah River nuclear weapons
plant in South Carolina put some of its workers at an unnecessarily
high risk of ``gross contamination'' by plutonium, according to an
Energy Department audit report.
   Plutonium, a key ingredient in nuclear warheads, is one of the
most toxic elements known. Lethal lung doses of plutonium are
measured in the billionths of a gram.
   The defense contractor that runs the plant, Westinghouse
Electric Corp., said Friday it was taking action to correct the
problem. It was discovered during a two-month probe of health,
safety and environmental conditions at Savannah River, which makes
plutonium and other special materials for nuclear weapons.
   The audit ended March 23 and results were made available Friday
at the Energy Department, which owns Savannah River and 16 other
major nuclear arms plants and laboratories.
   The audit team of federal officials and private contractors said
they found a potentially dangerous combination of problems at a
building called the SED Facility, which is on the grounds of
Savannah River's research laboratory near Aiken, S.C.
   Dean Hoffman, a Westinghouse spokesman, said the SED Facility
performs classified work and that he could not comment on it beyond
saying the problems were being fixed.
   The auditors said they were concerned about conditions in an
area of the facility that contained glove boxes, or work stations
that allowed workers to handle plutonium with lead-lined gloves
inserted through the side of the box.
   They said the gloves were severely deteriorated. This was
particularly troubling because the gloves were contaminated with
plutonium and were in the vicinity of combustible objects,
including plastic, plywood, cardboard and plexiglass, the report
said.
   Making matters worse was a lack of adequate fire protection in
the building, the auditors said.
   ``The combination ... results in a high potential for the spread
of plutonium contamination to surrounding areas and their
occupants,'' the report said. At another point the report said the
result could be ``gross contamination'' of the SED Facility and the
unspecified number of people working in it.
   The nuclear weapons makers learned a painful lesson about the
dangers of plutonium processing 33 years ago. In September 1957 at
the Rocky Flats weapons plant in Colorado, plutonium shavings
ignited spontaneously in a plexiglass glove box, creating a huge
fire that quickly went out of control and spewed unknown amounts of
plutonium into the atmosphere just 16 miles from Denver.
   The problems at the SED Facility were rated at ``category 2,''
which the Energy Department defines as ``a significant risk'' but
not presenting a clear and present danger to workers or the public.
Problems of this type are serious enough to require considering
whether to shut down the facility until corrections are made.
   The auditors also said the problems had the ``potential for
causing a severe occupational injury, illness or fatality'' or
destruction of the building.
   In all, the audit found 11 sets of problems at Savannah River in
the ``category 2'' level. Besides the SED Facility, they included
inadequate procedures for evacuating workers from a high-level
nuclear waste storage area in the event of accidental releases of
radioactivity from nearby processing buildings.
   The auditors also gave a ``category 2'' rating to their finding
that operators and supervisors at Savannah River's waste management
facilities _ which are among the largest in the nation _ have not
been properly trained to operate the facilities.
   Hoffman said all 11 of the ``category 2'' concerns are being
addressed, and that most of them already have been corrected.

<HEAD>Freed Hostage to Undergo Biopsy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Freed hostage Robert Polhill may remain
hospitalized for as long as three or four weeks and will undergo a
biopsy soon to determine the nature of a growth on his vocal cords,
an Army doctor says.
   Dr. Russ Zajtchuk, deputy commander of clinical services at
Walter Reed Army Medical Center, said Friday that Polhill is not
considered strong enough yet to have the general anesthesia that is
necessary for the biopsy.
   He said it probably will be performed ``about Monday.''
   Polhill, 55, a diabetic, lost 25 pounds during his three years
and three months in the hands of Shiite Moslem extremists in
Lebanon.
   Zajtchuk said the growth on Polhill's left vocal cords could be
a tumor or an infection. An infection could be an outgrowth of his
captivity, but a tumor most likely would not be, he said.
   Zajtchuk said Polhill also has ``some extent'' of tingling and
numbness in his hands as a complication of his diabetes. He said
the ex-hostage had told other physicians that his captors supplied
him with insulin to treat his condition.
   A Shiite physician, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told
The Associated Press in Nicosia, Cyprus, that the militants holding
Western hostages sometimes bring in doctors from Iranian-funded
hospitals to care for ailing captives.
   ``The hostages have common health problems such as diabetes,
high blood pressure or high levels of uric acid,'' said the
physician. ``Medicines for such health problems are not a problem.
They can be obtained anywhere in Lebanon.''
   Zajtchuk said Polhill ``appears to be in reasonably good spirits
considering the ordeal he has undergone.''
   ``There is no evidence that he was beaten,'' the Army doctor
said. He said Polhill had indicated to other physicians that he was
not.
   Polhill was released Sunday and flown to Washington on Thursday
from Wiesbaden, West Germany, where he spent three days in another
Army hospital.
   Seventeen Western hostages, seven of them Americans, are still
held in the Middle East. The longest-held of the U.S. hostages is
Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press.
   Zajtchuk appeared at a news conference along with Polhill's
Lebanese-born wife, Ferial, who said her husband ``is physically
weak, but mentally very, very strong.''
   Polhill did not appear at the news conference, but his wife read
a statement from him, saying, ``I regret that, at the moment, I am
unable to thank you more directly and personally. But my voice
decided to go on vacation before I did. However, I do want you to
know how very much I appreciate the warmth and sincerity of your
welcome and the support you've given my wife and family, who join
me in hoping that this is the beginning of the end to the hostage
situation.''
   ``I am, happily, now free to join you in your continued support
for the loved ones of those who remain in captivity and in
welcoming the hostages home in the very near future,'' Polhill
said. ``Let's show the world that we, the American people, want to
leave the past behind us, look positively to the future and, once
and for all, close the file on the hostage issue.''
   Polhill was abducted with two other American educators on Jan.
24, 1987, from the campus of the U.S.-affiliated Beirut University
College. The other two remain among the seven American hostages.
Mrs. Polhill said her husband had told her that both of them, Alann
Steen and Jesse Turner, ``are doing very well.''

   American University will survive the
resignation of its president amid an investigation of obscene phone
calls because ``no institution is dependent on one person,'' the
university provost says.
   AU President Richard Berendzen resigned earlier this month,
citing exhaustion. However, authorities said later that Berendzen
was being investigated for allegedly making obscene telephone calls.
   No charges have been filed against Berendzen.
   Provost Milton Greenberg, who has assumed the duties of the
president, said Friday the school had ``undergone an unbelievably
extraordinary turn of events filled with human tragedy, legal
complications, media interest and the blessed but complicated
expectations of openness.''
   ``We won't pretend now that we are not sad, baffled and
worried,'' he said.
   ``No institution is dependent on one person,'' Greenberg said at
a meeting in the campus athletic building.
   Berendzen, who is being treated at Johns Hopkins University
Hospital in Baltimore, issued an apology Thursday through his
lawyer. Berendzen did not describe the nature of his treatment.
   ``I cannot begin to convey my embarrassment, or my torment,'' he
said in the three-paragraph statement.
   Berendzen, a former astronomy professor with degrees from MIT
and Harvard, came to American University in 1974 as dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences. He became provost three years later
and president in 1980.
   ``We are affected. We are hurt by what has happened,'' staff
member Haimdat Sawah, 28, said after Greenberg's speech.
   ``But I don't think the integrity of the university has been
diminished that much, or the quality of the degree has diminished
that much.''
   Several students said they were disappointed Greenberg didn't
discuss specifics of the allegations against Berendzen.
   ``I just feel that a lot of things weren't cleared up about what
happened,'' said sophomore Susan Demel, a native of Puerto Rico.
``I think he (Greenberg) was very vague.''
   Andrew Bloom, a sophomore from Chicago, said the university was
withholding facts.
   ``They are trying to protect the university's reputation and
they are going about it all wrong,'' Bloom said.
   Officials said Berendzen resigned after he became the subject of
an investigation based on complaints to police in suburban Fairfax
County, Va.
   Fairfax Commonwealth Attorney Robert Horan is expected to
complete the investigation in a few days, but he refuses to detail
allegations against Berendzen.

<TEXT>
   Senate leaders hope to send an aid package for
Central America to President Bush next week, but lawmakers first
must resolve disputes over abortion and the death penalty that are
slowing the bill.
   The Senate was unable to make much progress with the $3.4
billion spending bill on Friday.
   The measure's centerpieces are $300 million for Nicaragua and
$420 million for Panama, which both have new democratic
governments. But unrelated provisions and dozens of potential
amendments have slowed work on the bill.
   Much of Friday's session was spent debating language permitting
the District of Columbia to use local funds to pay for abortions
for poor women. The bill survived two attempts by conservatives to
remove the language, 51-45 and 54-42.
   Work on the bill bogged down again after senators gave
preliminary approval, 60-27, to an amendment allowing the death
penalty for drug-related murders in the District of Columbia.
   When the vote ended, capital punishment foe Sen. Mark Hatfield,
R-Ore., pulled out a 1,000-page study entitled, ``The Case Against
the Death Penalty.'' He announced that he was prepared to debate at
length on the issue.
   After 40 minutes, the Senate agreed to postpone debate on the
bill until Monday.
   The delays provoked expressions of frustration from Senate
leaders, who had hoped to send the legislation to Bush for his
signature earlier this week.
   ``This is supposed to be an urgent supplemental bill for Panama
and Nicaragua,'' lamented Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   ``We've forgotten that because we want to debate abortion all
day. We have a responsibility to the president'' to expedite aid to
the two fledgling democratic governments, he said.
   Surveying a list of dozens of amendments proposed by both
Democrats and Republicans, Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, added: ``I don't think either side has displayed any
restraint.''
   When passed, the measure still must go to a conference with the
House to work out differences with that chamber's $2.4 billion
version. The money is for the rest of this fiscal year, which ends
Sept. 30.
   The aid to Panama and Nicaragua, as well as money for a number
of domestic programs added by members of Congress, is being paid
for largely through cuts in the Pentagon budget.
   From Bush's original request for $870 million, House and Senate
add-ons pushed the total price tag of the bill to roughly $3.4
billion. Domestic spending initiatives ranged from $8 million to
wage war on grasshoppers in the upper Midwest to $185 million for a
West Virginia FBI fingerprint lab.
   Also included by Congress was hundreds of millions of dollars to
make up shortfalls this year in a variety of programs, including
veterans' benefits, food stamps, Forest Service firefighting and
disaster relief.
   Among amendments adopted Friday was a requirement that the
government study how foreign aid can be used to promote the
fortunes of American businesses overseas, proposed by Sen. Robert
C. Byrd, D-W.Va..

<HEAD>EPA Ordered to Explain Acid Rain Position</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency is under
orders from a federal appeals court to explain why it has not
written regulations to reduce acid rain.
   In a separate but related decision, the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia rejected Friday an industry
challenge to current standards for smoke, dust and soot.
   The court gave EPA 60 days to explain its acid rain position.
   The issue could become moot, since revisions to clean air
legislation now before Congress are expected to include new
controls on acid rain precursors such as sulfur dioxide, the
pollutant at issue before the court.
   Longstanding EPA ``primary'' regulations aimed at protecting
public health govern the permissible concentration of sulfur
dioxide in the ground-level atmosphere around pollution sources
such as power plant smokestacks.
   The agency also may issue so-called ``secondary'' standards
aimed at protecting economic and other assets without regard to
health.
   Sulfur dioxide may be transformed chemically in the atmosphere
into sulfuric acid, which may fall in rain hundreds of miles from
the pollution source. The acid may form a haze in the atmosphere
that reduces visibility.
   The National Resources Defense Council, an environmental group,
and several Northeastern states argued that the agency must issue a
secondary sulfur dioxide standard aimed at acid rain. One asset to
be protected was visibility, the plaintiffs argued.
   ``EPA has taken no formal action indicating that it is moving in
the direction of making a decision whether or not to establish a
secondary standard'' on acid rain, wrote judge Patricia Wald.
   While the ruling implies ``no conclusion as to the merits of
EPA's lack of movement,'' the court directed the agency ``to
provide us with clear and cogent reasons why'' it has taken no
action.
   ``We're very pleased that the court agreed with us that the EPA
had not satisfactorily explained why it was continuing to refuse to
address acid rain,'' said James Sevinsky, a lawyer in the office of
New York state Attorney General Robert Abrams.
   David Doniger, a lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense
Council, said: ``In one sense this is vindication. In another
sense, it's a sad commentary on how the legal process works.''
   In the Reagan administration, EPA argued that more study was
needed before acid rain could be addressed. The Bush administration
favors action and is supporting a far-reaching provision in
Congress to require a 10 million ton reduction in annual sulfur
dioxide emissions, almost half the current annual total.
   The American Iron and Steel Institute challenged as arbitrary
and capricious EPA air quality standards for particulate matter _
smoke, dust and soot _ on the grounds that they were based on
inadequate scientific data. The court found the federal agency's
standards conclusions reasonable, based on the available data.
   The industry group had asked the court to delay its decision,
saying that the National Institutes of Health is investigating
allegations that an author of some studies relied on by the EPA had
suppressed evidence of errors.
   But those studies were only part of the evidence the EPA used,
said the appeals court. The significance of the opening of the
investigation is ``too speculative to provide grounds'' for
delaying its decision, said the court.

   A federal court jury ended the bank fraud
trial of U.S. Rep. Harold Ford in deadlock, but a prosecutor says
the government will try again for a conviction.
   A mistrial was declared Friday after nearly two months of
testimony over political favors Ford was accused of performing in
exchange for loans from two fallen banking brothers.
   The Democrat said he considered the mistrial a victory, but had
expected an innocent verdict.
   ``I'm hopeful now that I can put this episode behind me,'' Ford
said.
   U.S. Attorney John Gill had a different idea.
   ``There will be a retrial,'' Gill said from his Knoxville
office. ``The only thing I can say is we had a case we felt we were
obligated to bring based on the evidence we had.''
   Ford, Tennessee's only black congressman, has complained often
since his 1987 indictment that he is the victim of racist
prosecutors. The government has denied the allegation.
   Ford, 44, was accused of taking political payoffs disguised as
loans from former bankers Jake Butcher and his brother, C.H.
Butcher Jr.
   The Butcher brothers in 1983 set off one of the worst banking
collapses in U.S. financial history. Both brothers are serving
20-year prison terms on guilty pleas stemming from their banking
empire's collapse.
   Ford was indicted in Knoxville on conspiracy, bank and mail
fraud charges. The trial was moved to Memphis at his request. He
was charged with 19 counts and faced up to 95 years in prison if
convicted.
   Federal rules require a retrial within 70 days, but Gill said
pretrial motions could push back the date.
   Ford stood trial with former C.H. Butcher Jr. accountant David
Crabtree and former lawyers for both brothers, Karl Schledwitz and
Douglas Beaty.
   Crabtree, Schledwitz and Beaty were accused of helping Ford get
and hide Butcher money and faced charges of conspiracy and mail
fraud _ five counts for Crabtree and 16 each for Beaty and
Schledwitz.
   The government's trial witnesses outlined a complicated string
of loans to Ford and said few, if any, payments were made on them
prior to the Butchers' financial collapse.
   The government said Ford and his family drew Butcher loans
totaling more than $1 million between 1976 and 1982, but Ford put
the total at $650,000. He said those debts were settled.
   The trial began Feb. 12. Testimony began March 1 and the
government called 29 witnesses. The defense did not call any
witnesses, and Ford said he decided not to testify because he
regarded the government's case as weak.
   U.S. District Judge Odell Horton removed one of 12 jurors
earlier Friday for failing to disclose a past felony conviction,
but lawyers said the trial could have continued with 11 jury
members.

   Movie mogul Raymond Chow recalls his initial
response to a suggestion he produce a film called ``Teen-Age Mutant
Ninja Turtles.''
   ``It's quite impossible! What is this?'' Chow responded.
   ``When you hear the title it is difficult to relate the four
words to each other. To make sure I heard it right, I really had to
ask the guy to spell it out for me,'' he said during a recent
interview at his studios in Hong Kong.
   But Chow, 62, refused to dismiss the movie out of hand when the
suggestion was made two years ago.
   He agreed to produce the movie based on four crime-fighting,
human-sized turtles who devour pizza, speak surfer lingo
(Cowabunga!!) and are named after the Renaissance artists Raphael,
Leonardo, Michelangelo and Donatello.
   ``My gut feeling told me we should give it a try,'' said Chow,
whose Golden Harvest Group first landed on the international
movie-making map with martial arts idol Bruce Lee.
   ``It's very weird, very unique and very interesting. ... You
have to be unique these days to be a big success,'' he said.
   The rest is Hollywood history. The idea that was rejected by
U.S. studios eventually became ``Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles''
and smashed box office records to become the top-grossing
independent film in the United States.
   The movie's box office should reach $100 million this weekend
and could hit $150 million in the United States alone, with much of
the receipts coming from children buying half-priced tickets.
   Tens of millions more will be earned as the radioactive
reptillian warriors head to other countries later this year.
   The movie, which cost $15 million, stands to earn Golden Harvest
at least $25 million.
   It isn't the first time movies about martial arts heroes have
been kind to Chow's studio.
   In the early 1970s, Golden Harvest made five Bruce Lee movies
including ``Enter the Dragon,'' which was co-produced by Warner
Bros. and grossed nearly $50 million in the United States,
according to one studio executive.
   Chow, a former Voice of America reporter, has many smaller
successes among the more than 300 films he has made since 1970,
most low-budget films made for the Asian market. Popular kung fu
sagas, action comedies and ghost stories are market staples.
   That formula for success has made Chow's studio a target of
critics who say he is only concerned with making money, not quality
films.
   But Chow rejects the arguments and says both the Bruce Lee and
Ninja Turtles movies carry social messages.
   ``Most of our films have a general good message, sort of the
Buddhist belief that good guys will be rewarded and bad guys will
be punished. So everybody should be a good guy,'' he said.
   Another company in this British colony is joining in the golden
harvest from the terrapins. Playmates Holdings Ltd. has seen its
sales and profits rise dramatically as the licensed manufacturer of
Ninja Turtle toys.
   ``We are amazed at this tremendous response,'' its finance
director, B.F. Chu, said from the company's showroom.
   Also in the showroom was Retromutagen Ooze (the turtles mutated
after contact with radioactive sewer slime), a Turtle Blimp and
many more of the dozens of turtle-related toys made at factories in
China and the nearby Portuguese territory of Macao.
   After suffering a loss of $4.8 million in 1987, Playmates'
turtle toys went on the market and helped the company earn $2.3
million in 1988 and $21.4 million last year.
   More than 70 percent of the company's sales came from the turtle
line last year, and Chu said orders have further jumped since the
movie came out a month ago. Playmates expects sales to increase
again this year.
   The good fortune may just be starting for the company. A new
line of licensed Dick Tracy toys is about to be released in
conjunction with the Warren Beatty movie on the famed comic cop,
scheduled for release in June.

<HEAD>Judge Offers Offenders a Choice of Fines or Learning</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES JEFFERSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EL DORADO, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Judge Erwin Alderson offers petty
offenders who are illiterate a choice: crack the books or pay the
price.
   The municipal court judge will reduce or suspend fines if
offenders take part in a 20-week literacy program at Oil Belt
Vo-Tech.
   Alderson, whose rulings range from fines of $85 for violation of
a local leash law to hundreds of dollars for driving while
intoxicated, got his idea last year when he attended the kickoff of
a program at a local school that uses computers to help teach
illiterate adults to read.
   ``I believe in trying innovative things,'' he said. And the
criminal justice system, particularly municipal court, is a good
place to locate people with literacy problems, he added.
   ``There's no question that people who are involved in lives of
petty crime, a lot of the reason for that is because they don't
have anything to do, a lack of alternatives, lack of self-esteem,
hopelessness,'' he said.
   ``But it has been hard,'' he said, because of ``the natural
reluctance of a person to admit in front of others that they cannot
read, plus the fact that we're learning. We don't have many
precedents to follow.''
   One defendant who declined Alderson's offer is Otis King, a
60-year pulpwood cutter from Louann in Union County who never
learned to read or write.
   King decided in November to pay a $90.25 fine for public
drunkenness because, he said, ``I don't have no transportation, no
way of getting back and forth up there.''
   From an early age, King went to work to support his mother, and
acknowledges that poring over books would be frightening.
   ``I've worked all my life around sawmills and in the woods, ever
since I was big enough,'' he said. ``At the time, it would have
been nice if I could have (learned to read), I wanted to. But a man
at my age, no, I just can't see it.''
   Authorities in some other states also have been trying to get
offenders to better themselves.
   In Virginia, a new ``no read-no release'' Learning Incentive
Program requires state prison inmates to read above sixth-grade
level to be eligible for parole, and offers programs at 52
Department of Corrections schools.
   The prosecutor's office in New York's Bronx borough began
offering jail inmates a range of educational services about four
years ago.
   Those who appear in Alderson's court are read their rights and
must sign a waiver saying they understand them.
   ``I use that as kind of a primitive way of screening,'' Alderson
said. ``It's real easy when I see an X (signature). More often than
not, though, it's someone who cannot read and struggles signing
their name.''
   Alderson recommends participation in the learning program
``based on instinct.''
   Wanda Sturdivant, an assistant municipal clerk, said ``everyone
he's sent through has needed the program'' at Oil Belt, but none
has completed the course.
   One man fined for having a dog at large wanted to attend but had
no transportation, she said. Another man who attended for a while
and quit may be getting help on his own, she said.
   Still, Alderson said he was convinced the program eventually
will succeed.
   ``Each and every one of God's creatures is terribly important,
and if one person can learn to read because of something we might
have done here, I think it's a success,'' he said.

   The shuttle that put the Hubble Space
Telescope into orbit also carries an instrument used in the 1920s
by astronomer Edwin Hubble: the eyepiece from what once was the
world's most powerful telescope.
   ``It's a great pleasure to have something of such historical
significance and something that so directly symbolizes Edwin
Hubble's fundamental contributions to astronomy,'' astronaut Kathy
Sullivan said Friday as she circled the Earth in space shuttle
Discovery.
   The eyepiece from the Mount Wilson Observatory's 100-inch Hooker
Telescope was carried into orbit by Sullivan. After she brings the
eyepiece back to Earth, it will be placed on display at the
observatory.
   ``It's basically a symbolic gesture from the past of astronomy
to the future of astronomy,'' said Lyn McAfee, spokeswoman for the
Mount Wilson Institute. The Pasadena-based group runs the
observatory, located in the San Gabriel Mountains outside Los
Angeles.
   ``The discoveries made by Hubble on the 100-inch telescope at
Mount Wilson gave us a giant leap forward in our understanding of
the universe,'' McAfee said. ``We believe the Hubble Space
Telescope will do the same thing.''
   The Hooker Telescope was the world's most powerful telescope
from its construction in 1918 until 1948, when the 200-inch Hale
Telescope was placed in operation at Mount Palomar Observatory
northeast of San Diego.
   Using the Hooker Telescope, Hubble was the first to determine
the distance to a galaxy outside the Milky Way, the institute said
in a statement.
   ``This crucial discovery provided the first definite proof that
other galaxies existed far beyond the confines of our own local
galaxy,'' the institute said.
   During the 1920s and 1930s, Hubble and an assistant used the
Hooker telescope to take thousands of photographs of faint
galaxies, showing that most of them were moving away from each
other very quickly.
   ``This provided observational evidence for the concept,
suggested by Einstein's Theory of Relativity, that the universe is
expanding,'' the institute said.
   Hubble's work helped convince scientists the universe was
created in a giant explosion, called the ``big bang,'' an estimated
15 billion years ago.
   The Hooker Telescope was mothballed in 1985 by the Carnegie
Institution, former operator of the observatory, in a money-saving
move. The institute hopes to obtain funds to reopen it.

   Sausage made by two Michigan food processors
is being recalled voluntarily because the meat may contain sulfite.
   Dave's Sausage Factory in Detroit recalled 3,000 pounds, and
Mancini Sausage Co. in Harpers Woods 500 pounds, the Agriculture
Department said Friday.
   ``Sulfites can pose serious health risks for people who are
sensitive to these compounds,'' said Lester M. Crawford, head of
the department's Food Safety and Inspection Service.
   The sausage links produced by Dave's are sold under the names
``Wisbisky's Polish Sausage,'' ``Vetro's Italian Sausage'' and
``Dave's Pork Links.''
   The first two products are sold in clear plastic bags and weigh
about 1{ pounds each. The label shows the product name and has
``Est. 10198'' printed inside the USDA inspection seal.
   ``Dave's Pork Links'' are repackaged by stores and may be sold
under a private brand name, Crawford said. All three products are
distributed to grocery stores, delicatessens and restaurants in
Michigan.
   The Mancini Sausage Co. product is sold only to delicatessens
under the name, ``Polish Brand Sausage'' and is also in clear
plastic bags, with a weight of 1{ pounds each. White printing on
the bag shows the product name, ``Est. 10210'' printed inside the
inspection seal, and the words ``produced by Mancini Sausage
Company.''

   Federal charges against a figure in the
defense industry probe have been dismissed by a federal judge who
said the indictment may have been an act of retaliation.
   Thomas E. Muldoon, a former consultant to Norden Systems,
already had been convicted on eight felonies, including conspiracy
and bribery of a public official. Soon after his attorney filed an
appeal on that conviction, Muldoon was indicted on charges of
trafficking in secret defense information.
   U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. in Alexandria, Va.,
wrote Friday that there was ``a realistic likelihood of
vindictiveness on the part of the United States in causing the
return of the present indictment in retaliation for the defendant
Thomas E. Muldoon's going to trial or noting an appeal for his
prior conviction or both.''
   Muldoon, 60, was sentenced to 27 months in prison and fined
$10,000 for his conviction arising from the investigation of fraud

<TEXT>
   Two moderate earthquakes struck the San
Francisco Bay Area on Friday night, causing scattered power outages
and shaking Candlestick Park during a baseball game. There were no
reports of damage or injuries.
   The largest earthquake struck about 9:40 p.m. and was centered
in the Walnut Creek area, about 25 miles east of San Francisco, and
had a preliminary reading of 4.6 on the Richter scale, said Lou
Page, a spokesman for the U. S. Geological Survey.
   An aftershock with a reading of 4.3 struck at 9:47 p.m. followed
at 9:59 p.m. by a 2.5 shake, Page said.
   The quakes occurred along the Concord fault and is one of a
recent swarm of tremors there, Page said.
   ``We really felt it. There was a sudden crack and then a rolling
that goes on and on,'' said Mary Bacon, nursing supervisor at Mt.
Diablo Hospital in Concord. ``Some of the patients and some of the
employees were shook up and were sick to their stomachs.''
   Pacific Gas &amp; Electric reported 1,300 customers in Concord lost
power, and scattered outages were reported in Alamo, said Brad
Thomas, PG&amp;E spokesman.
   The first quake was felt at Candlestick Park where the San
Francisco Giants were in the sixth inning of a game against the St.
Louis Cardinals.
   An earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale struck the San
Francisco area on Oct. 17, killing 67 people and causing an
estimated $7 billion in damage. That quake struck moments before
the start of a World Series game at Candlestick between the Giants
and the Oakland Athletics; the series was delayed more than a week.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.

   A 2-year-old boy was in stable
condition after he was mauled by his family's pit bull, the same
dog that apparently attacked his brother two years ago, authorities
said.
   Bruce Scott Herrin suffered deep bites on his face, shoulders
and chest when the pit bull, Kone, attacked him as they played in
their back yard on Thursday.
   His mother, Athena Herrin, pulled the 90-pound animal off her
son, carried the boy into the house, called rescue workers then
shot the dog to death, said Lake County Sheriff's Capt. Glen
Perkins.
   The boy underwent five hours of surgery Thursday night, and on
Friday his condition was upgraded from extremely critical to stable.
   In the summer of 1988, the dog apparently attacked Bobbie
Herrin, then 2, when the boy tried to hug the dog as it slept, said
Dennis Burke, Lake County animal control officer. The boy suffered
cuts and a fractured skull when his head hit the table.
   The dog then was locked up until an investigator reported that
Kone was calm and friendly and showed no signs of aggressive
behavior.

   A strong earthquake shook a province
near the Costa Rican border, knocking out electricity in one town
and snapping a gasoline pipeline.
   However, no major damage or injuries were reported, fire
department personnel told The Associated Press by telephone.
   The quake, which measured 6.1 on the Richter scale, struck
Chiriqui province, 275 miles west of Panama City, Friday night.
   Electricity was cut off for a few minutes in Puerto Armuelles,
along the Costa Rican border, and a gasoline pipeline broke but was
quickly repaired, a fire department employee said.
   Physicist Jaime Toral of the University of Panama's Seismic
Institute said by telephone that the epicenter of the quake was
near Golfito, Costa Rica, along the Panamanian border. He said it
struck at 8:24 p.m. and that an earlier tremor registered 4.3 on
the Richter scale.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means the ground motion
is 10 times greater.
   An earthquake of 6.0 can cause severe damage.

<HEAD>Visiting Nurses Say Inner-City Care Dangerous</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Caring for the sick and homebound in
America's inner cities has become increasingly hazardous, and many
visiting nurses won't venture into crime-torn neighborhoods without
a security escort.
   But some nursing organizations say they're having a tough enough
time collecting adequate health-care insurance reimbursements
without having to worry about forking out money for security guards.
   In Providence, the Visiting Nurse Association of Rhode Island
has threatened to stop taking on new patients in areas of the city
it considers dangerous.
   The need for security escorts has grown dramatically, but the
city cannot be persuaded to kick in money for protection services,
said its president, Jane A. Mackenzie. The threat may be drastic,
but no choice exists, she said.
   Several weeks ago, one nurse, Mary Seccareccia, was making her
rounds at a housing complex in the city when someone fired a shot
as she got out of her car, shattering the rear window, Mrs.
Mackenzie said.
   ``I have never seen the same degree of personal threat in my
whole time in public health nursing,'' said Mrs. Mackenzie, who has
worked in nursing for 40 years. ``I think we've avoided a lot of
problems by having the escort with the nurses.''
   Val Halamandarias, president of the Washington-based National
Association of Home Care, said violence is rife in some drug-ridden
neighborhoods and nurses are increasingly getting caught in the
crossfire.
   ``It's a huge problem nationwide, particularly in the big urban
centers,'' she said. ``I can't think of a city over a million
(population) that doesn't have a problem.''
   In Providence, security escorts have helped. No nurses have
reported being physically assaulted since the Visiting Nurse
Association began using unarmed security escorts almost a decade
ago, said VNA spokeswoman Cheryl Lisi.
   But as the violence has escalated, so has the need for security
_ and for money to pay for guards, Mrs. Mackenzie said.
   Insurance once paid for health care to patients, while support
from philanthropists and charitable organizations covered
administrative costs for interpreters and security escorts, she
said.
   Now, insurance companies don't always cover all of the
health-care costs and the VNA has to dip into its pot of
administrative money for patient care.
   Last year, she said, Medicaid and Medicare payments to the VNA
fell short of covering the actual costs of the services provided by
$460,779.
   The association has turned to the city for help. If it doesn't
get $156,000, it will stop taking clients in dangerous
neighborhoods, Mrs. Mackenzie said. Providence is the only
community in Rhode Island that does not help fund the association,
she charged.
   But the city's administration director, John Simmons, said
Providence gave the association $22,000 from a federal grant this
year, and he also questioned whether its financial or security
concerns were as bad as the nurses claim.
   ``We're not sure at this time that the VNA needs money,'' he
said. ``There are other agencies that go into the city and do not
need escort services.''
   Simmons said city officials would be happy to work with the VNA
to find new ``approaches in how you provide services.''
   Providence is not alone in its funding difficulties, and home
health services around the country have had to try to tap other
sources to stay afloat, Halamandarias said.
   The Visiting Nurse Society of New York turned to Broadway
earlier this month, sponsoring a benefit performance of ``Cat On A
Hot Tin Roof'' to raise money, she said.

   Actress Elizabeth Taylor, who was
gravely ill last weekend in her three-week battle with pneumonia,
is improving and was moved from a hospital intensive care unit to a
private room, officials said.
   ``According to her physicians she is responding well to
treatment for pneumonia. She continues to improve and her condition
is listed as stable,'' said a prepared statement issued Friday by
St. John's Hospital and Health Center.
   The actress was moved to a private room Thursday evening, it
said.
   A ventilator used to help Miss Taylor breathe earlier this week
was removed Wednesday.
   Miss Taylor, 58, entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital on April
9 with a persistent fever and sinus infection. Her condition
worsened and she was transferred April 16 to St. John's.
   She had been in serious condition in the intensive care ward at
St. John's since last Sunday. Doctors said that at one point last
weekend she nearly died.
   The Oscar-winning star of ``Butterfield 8'' and ``Who's Afraid
of Virginia Woolf'' has been troubled with health problems for
years, particularly recurring back troubles.
   She suffered a nearly fatal bout of pneumonia in 1961 and in
1983 acknowledged a 35-year addiction to sleeping pills and pain
killers prescribed for a wide range of health problems.
   Miss Taylor has been treated for alcohol and drug abuse problems
at the Betty Ford Clinic in Rancho Mirage, Calif.

   The Kremlin has again rejected Lithuania's

   The radio, monitored by the BBC in London on Friday night,
quoted Bronius Kuzmickas, the deputy chairman of Lithuania's
Supreme Council legislature, as saying that a parliamentary
delegation had met with some high-ranking officials in Moscow.
   But the officials reiterated President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
position that no talks with the government would take place unless
Lithuania rescinded its March 11 declaration of independence, the
radio said.
   Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene said her
government still hopes to begin talks without rolling back on
independence decisions, but it is considering a proposed temporary
freeze on secessionist actions as the maximum concession it might
offer Moscow.
   ``This is a compromise which should be viewed as the maximum.
This is the limit,'' she told a Friday night news conference,
according to the Soviet news agency Tass.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis has said the
republic's legislature, the Supreme Council, will consider the
freeze proposal, which came from the leaders of France and Germany.
The legislature is scheduled to reconvene Wednesday.
   A Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman in Moscow, Vadim Perfiliev,
said Friday he had no official reaction to the French and German
suggestion.
   Lithuania wants an immediate dialogue, Landsbergis said Friday,
and ``a termination of the Soviet economic blockade against
Lithuania would be beneficial to the atmosphere of this dialogue.''
   The Kremlin has imposed a blockade on gas, oil and other
supplies to Lithuania to pressure its leaders to rescind their
March 11 declaration of independence.
   Tass reported today that coal had been added to the embargo
list. Much of the coal Lithuania consumes is imported from Poland,
and the republic owes about $1.6 million for coal supplies, so they
have been stopped, the news agency said.
   Vilnius Radio reported that medicines including antibiotics were
in short supply, but that the situation was not believed to be
critical.
   On Friday in Washington, State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher said Mrs. Prunskiene had been granted a U.S. visa for
unofficial, business travel and said she was expected to visit
sometime next week.
   The United States and other Western countries have refused to
impose sanctions on the Soviet Union for its efforts to stop
Lithuania's independence drive.
   On Thursday, 52-year-old Stanislovas Jamaitis died of burns
suffered when he doused his clothes with gasoline and set himself
ablaze in front of the Bolshoi Theater in central Moscow to protest
the Kremlin pressure.
   Jamaitis left suicide notes to his wife, Stasala, and to
Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis. The Supreme Council
released the texts on Friday, said spokeswoman Rita Radzavicius.
   She translated them from Lithuanian to Russian and read them by
telephone.
   Tass also reported the existence of the note to Jamaitis' wife,
saying it ``spoke of an impossible family life and a desire to
commit suicide.''
   The version released by Lithuanian authorities apologized for
``something bad'' in his marriage, but stressed political motives.
   ``I went to Moscow to set myself on fire in Red Square,'' he
said in both notes. The Bolshoi is a few blocks from Red Square,
where security is heavier.
   ``The occupiers have cut off energy supplies and people are
being thrown out of work,'' Jamaitis wrote.
   He would kill himself to ``let Gorbachev know that Lithuanians
will not live in a Lithuania that is not independent,'' said the
note read by the spokeswoman.
   Kremlin officials have said Lithuania may become independent,
but at a slower pace and within the framework of the Soviet
constitution. A new law calls for a referendum and a maximum
five-year period to negotiate specifics of secession.
   Many non-Lithuanian residents of the republic oppose
independence and on Friday they staged a truck blockade during rush
hour in Vilnius, the capital.
   Supporters of the Lithuanian popular front Sajudis dragged the
trucks from the streets with tractors, Tass said.
   The blockade was organized by members of a Lithuanian Communist
Party splinter still loyal to the Kremlin and by members of
Yedinstvo, consisting mostly of Russian residents of Lithuania, Ms.
Radzevicius said.
   Just over 80 percent of the republic's population is Lithuanian,
and some Russian, Polish and other minority residents fear their
rights will be violated after independence.

<DATELINE>ST. REGIS INDIAN RESERVATION, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Factional fighting
between Mohawk bands who disagree over whether gambling should be
allowed here sent hundreds of residents fleeing the reservation
straddling the U.S.-Canada border.
   The St. Regis Mohawk Reservation had the look of a war zone
Friday. Burned cars lined the roads, many buildings had bullet
holes or broken windows and residents, including children, were
armed with guns or baseball bats.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo so far has refused to send New York State
Police or National Guardsmen to restore order, despite pleas from
one Indian leader and some outsiders.
   ``We want this situation resolved,'' Cuomo said. ``We're working
very hard to figure out how to do it. I think what we've done so
far, what the state police have done so far, has been appropriate.''
   Residents of the reservation just south of the St. Lawrence
River have been divided for months over the presence of gambling
casinos and bingo halls on the American side that draw thousands of
non-Indian visitors.
   The U.S. government has declared the gambling halls illegal, but
the Mohawks don't recognize federal or state jurisdiction on the
reservation.
   In recent weeks, the feud has exploded into violence, with
gambling opponents setting up armed blockades of roads leading to
the reservation and sounds of gunfire nightly.
   Pro-gambling Mohawks tore down the blockades in a bloody battle
Tuesday night. On Thursday night, four opponents of gambling were
injured, one seriously, when they were beaten with baseball bats.
Authorities said another person, an observer invited by
anti-gambling forces, was missing.
   Amid further violence, about 400 evacuees were taken on barges
Friday to Cornwall, Ontario, where they were housed overnight in an
army transport center.
   About 5,000 Mohawks live in the Canadian sector of the
reservation and authorities estimated that at least 2,000 will be
evacuated. The reservation's total population is about 14,000.
   Police said the reservation was quiet Friday night.
   But this weekend the casinos are to reopen for the first time
since the roadblocks were removed, and authorities feared violence
would flare anew.
   Mike Mitchell, chief of the Canadian Mohawk Council, said he
decided to evacuate women, children and the elderly from the
reservation Friday because of the previous trouble.
   ``Everybody was in a state of fear,'' Mitchell said. ``I
couldn't see another night of putting people through that. ...
Violence all night, machine gunfire ... every five minutes gunfire
all over the village.''
   Security was tight on a bridge across the Canadian border
leading to Cornwall. Local police armed with shotguns stopped cars
leaving and entering the bridge, asking for identification and
searching suspicious vehicles for weapons.
   Cornwall Constable Scott Hanton said police had heard reports
that weapons might be smuggled into the evacuation center.
   ``We're in a heck of a situation,'' he said. ``We don't have any
jurisdiction on the reservation, and we're stuck in the middle of
it.''
   On the American side of the bridge, state police and U.S.
Customs officials also stopped cars and checked for weapons.
   Barbara Barnes, an opponent of gambling, said some of the
residents of the American side of the reservation were also scared.
   ``I think anybody who has bullets coming at them should be
scared,'' she said. ``It's been a very harrowing experience.''
   Barnes said some people had voluntarily left their homes and
gone to live with friends or relatives off the reservation.
   Barnes criticized the governor for refusing to get involved.
   ``We have to have law enforcement here,'' she said. ``We can't
continue with this lawlessness. Any non-Indian community you
wouldn't have what's happened here.''
   The Canadian Embassy in Washington has contacted the U.S. State
Department Thursday to underline concerns about the violence and
the lack of U.S. policing on the reserve.
   ``We made no specific suggestions, but our government finds the
situation alarming and we are concerned that something needs to be
done,'' said Patricia Low-Bedard, a spokeswoman for the Canadian
Department of External Affairs.
   On Thursday, U.S. Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, chairman of the
select committee on Indian affairs, wrote Cuomo expressing his
concern about the ``most grave situation'' at St. Regis.

<HEAD>Colombian President Vows to Double Anti-drug Forces</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Virgilio Barco pledged to
double the size of an anti-terrorist police force following the
assassination of a presidential candidate that authorities blame on
drug traffickers.
   Carlos Pizarro, a former guerrilla leader turned politician, was
shot to death Thursday aboard a jetliner carrying 97 people. His
bodyguards then gunned down the assassin.
   The slaying was the latest of many blamed on the country's
leading cocaine cartel in the city of Medellin, and it prompted two
political leaders on Friday to call for a reorganization of the
military to help keep order before the May 27 elections.
   In a nationally televised speech Friday night, Barco said he
will double the size of the anti-terrorist police force, which now
has about 3,000 members.
   Acknowledging that political candidates are afraid to appear in
public, he said the government will order more free television time
for them and also provide free radio time.
   Government-controlled television now allows each candidate a
half-hour of air time during the entire campaign. Barco didn't say
how much more time they would get.
   Pizarro was the third presidential candidate assassinated in the
past eight months. He was a former leader of the M-19 guerrilla
movement. Hundreds of leftist guerrillas belonging the group laid
down their arms last month and formed a political party with
Pizarro as its presidential candidate.
   Other assassinations in the last six years have included a
justice minister, an attorney general, several judges, journalists,
students, professors and union leaders.
   A man called the Bogota radio station Caracol within hours of
Pizarro's death and said the Medellin Cartel had ordered his
killing.
   However, a faxed communique Friday supposedly from the cartel
denied reponsibility. It accused police of making phony statements
purporting to represent the cartel.
   Presidential candidate Alvaro Gomez, suggesting Barco lacks the
confidence of the military, said the president should name a
three-man council to run the army to avoid a military coup.
   In a written statement, Gomez said: ``Never has there been such
a great and pathetic image of anarchy.''
   Former president Alfonso Lopez Michelsen said the entire armed
forces must be reorganized.
   ``The credibility of the authorities is on trial, and the
successive display of inefficiency shown by the deaths of three
presidential candidates forces us to consider reogranization of the
army and other security forces,'' he said.
   Lopez, of the governing Liberal Party, was president from 1974
to 1978.
   A Barco spokesman, Minister of Government Horacio Serpa, flatly
rejected Gomez's suggestion of a triumvirate to run the military.
As for Lopez's idea, Serpa said Barco would reorganize the armed
forces if it becomes necessary.
   The August assassination of another candidate, Sen. Luis Carlos
Galan of the Liberal Party, prompted the government to step up its
crackdown on the cocaine cartels. Since then, drug traffickers have
killed more than 230 people.
   About 100 ticketed passengers Friday refused to board a domestic
Avianca flight in the coastal city of Barranquilla when they
learned that a leftist congresswoman and her heavily armed security
contingent would be traveling with them, radio reports said.
   It was on a flight to Barranquilla from Bogota that Pizarro was
shot to death.
   The radio chains Caracol and RCN said that in Friday's incident,
the plane stayed on the ground for 2{ hours until about 50
passengers finally decided to board. The plane then departed.

<HEAD>Nicaraguans Complain of Devaluation Of Currency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nicaraguan tempers are flaring over
the new government's devaluation of the national currency, which
has caused prices to shoot up in an economy already plagued by
soaring inflation.
   ``This new government will be good for nothing. Everything is
more expensive,'' a housewife with two children in tow said Friday
to nobody in particular as she walked among the stalls at a Managua
market.
   She was one of only a handful of customers at the sprawling
market, which is usually packed with shoppers.
   Francisca Guevara, a vendor, said she had raised only the price
of cooking oil because it was imported from Guatemala and she
needed to buy dollars to obtain it.
   ``But I'll have to raise the price of everything else, too, this
afternoon,'' she said. ``I first have to figure out my costs.''
   Other vendors already had raised their prices.
   The 2-day-old U.S.-backed government of President Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro slashed the value of the cordoba in half.
   Prices for many items increased, while the wages of most
Nicaraguans stayed the same. Many earned just $30 a month before
the devaluation.
   At the new prices, a pound of rice, one of beans and one of beef
would cost a total of 205,000 cordobas, or $1.46.
   Mrs. Chamorro inherited an economy damaged by more than a decade
of mismanagement by her leftist Sandinista precedessors, war with
the U.S.-backed Contra rebels and a U.S. trade embargo that has now
been lifted.
   Inflation was a world-record 36,000 percent in 1988. The
Sandinistas managed to bring it down to 1,800 percent in 1989 with
their own austerity program.
   The exchange rate of the cordoba went from 70,800 to 140,000 per
U.S. dollar in the so-called parallel market. Thus, anyone buying
dollars at the legal exchange houses that constitute Nicaragua's
parallel market had to pay twice as much Friday as Thursday.
   The official exchange rate had been 53,800 cordobas to the
dollar since the last devaluation April 17. The official market
sells a limited amount of dollars set aside for importing only
crucial goods such as medicines, oil and fertilizer.
   The parallel market provides a greater but still limited amount
of dollars for less crucial imports, but at a higher price.
   The black market meets the rest of Nicaragua's demand for
dollars.
   The devaluation was a blow to Nicaraguans who buy dollars to
import goods. But that was the idea: to make it more expensive to
import goods and cheaper to export Nicaraguan items.
   The government hopes the move will help cut the country's trade
deficit, which was $413 million in 1989.

   Connecticut is set to become the first
state to guarantee a woman's right to choose abortion under state
law even if the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion is
struck down by the Supreme Court.
   The state Senate on Friday overwhelmingly approved a bill that
effectively codifies into state law much of Roe vs. Wade. It also
repeals the state's unenforced criminal anti-abortion statutes.
   The bill now goes to Democratic Gov. William A. O'Neill, who has
said he will sign it.
   Dawn Johnsen, legal director for the National Abortion Rights
Action League, called the bill an important victory for
abortion-rights forces.
   ``This is the first state law that says a woman has a right to
choose an abortion, not just under the Constitution, but under
state law,'' she told The New York Times. The New Hampshire
legislature recently passed similar legislation, but Gov. Judd
Gregg vetoed it.
   The Pro-Life Council of Connecticut also claimed victory,
however, because the bill requires girls under 16 to get counseling
before getting an abortion and encourages them to tell their
parents.
   The Connecticut Right To Life Corp. firmly opposed the measure.
   In a slight variation on the Roe vs. Wade decision, the bill
allows abortions late in pregnancy, when the fetus is capable of
living outside the womb, only when the life or health of the mother
is in danger.
   The Senate approved the bill by a 32-3 vote after about 45
minutes of debate. The House endured five hours of debate on the
bill last week.
   States have taken a more prominent role in the abortion issue
since the Supreem Court last summer decided in a Missouri case to
let pass more restrictive abortion laws. The court indicated it
might modify or reverse Roe vs. Wade.
   ``Even if the Supreme Court were to reverse Roe v. Wade ... this
statute would be the governing standard for the state of
Connecticut,'' said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, the Democratic
vice-chairman of the Judiciary Committee and a co-sponsor of the
bill.
   ``I think what the Supreme Court is saying in effect to the
states ... is we're going to turn this issue over to you.
Connecticut has taken the gauntlet and said we're ready to face
that issue and we're going to be pro-choice,'' he said.
   The Senate easily rejected three Republican amendments. One
would have restored criminal sanctions against anyone performing an
abortion and permitted the father or grandparent of the fetus to
sue for $10,000 in damages. Another would have required minors to
notify parents before an abortion could be performed.
   ``It's a sad day in the state of Connecticut when we would
intervene to deny parents fundamental rights,'' said Republican
Sen. Thomas Scott, a sponsor of the parental notification
amendment. Allowing a child to make such a decision on her own,
Scott added, ``is unconscionable.''
   But some Republicans criticized Scott for the amendment.
   ``I don't think we can mandate morals or conscience or anything
else ... and that's what we're trying to do'' with such amendments,
said Republican Sen. M. Adela Eads.

   Floodwaters in north-central Texas were receding early today,
while the northwestern tier got snow and rain dampened parts of the
South and Midwest.
   Tornadoes spawned by thunderstorms touched down Friday near
Magee, Miss., and near the Texas towns of Waco, Coolidge, Groesbeck
and Hearne, the National Weather Service said.
   At least 200 homes in the Texas community of Horseshoe Bend,
which is ringed by the rain-swollen Brazos River, remained under
water Friday, authorities said.
   Water stood 4 feet deep in the streets of Brownwood, Texas,
receding slowly. Lake Brownwood couldn't handle 16 inches of rain
since Wednesday, authorities said.
   ``It's going to be a long-term thing, two or three weeks minimum
before businesses are back in operation,'' Brownwood Mayor Bert
Massey said.
   ``It's the worst disaster to ever hit Brownwood. We're talking
about millions upon millions of dollars in damages in the business
district alone,'' he said.
   Hail also battered Texas, including hailstones nearly an inch in
diameter southeast of Dallas and north of Kerens. Hail the size of
golf balls fell on Hillsboro and several other Texas cities.
   Rain early today fell in St. Louis, Des Moines, Iowa, Little
Rock, Ark., Nashville, Tenn., Birmingham, Ala., Boise, Idaho,
Medford, Ore., Spokane, Wash.
   Rapid City got snow.
   The National Weather Service posted a winter storm warning for
today over the western mountains of Montana. Snow advisories were
posted today elsewhere in Montana and parts of Idaho, Washington
state, Oregon and Wyoming.
   Unseasonably cold temperatures, with snow in higher elevations,
were predicted today for the northern Sierra Nevada region and the
northern mountains of California.
   Utah could receive a foot of snow in higher mountains by Sunday
night.
   High temperatures Friday from the northern Atlantic Coast to the
upper Great Lakes were milder than usual. The weather service said
more than 36 high temperature records for the date were broken or
tied.
   The new temperature records include a high of 86 degrees in
Bridgeport, Conn., 89 degrees in Cape Hatteras, N.C., and 92
degrees in Boston.
   The high Friday in the Lower 48 states was 105 degrees in
Borrego Springs, Calif.

   His ticket from the Minnesota Lottery showed
the man had won $1,000, but when he left the lottery office, he
owed the state money and had the police on his trail.
   The lottery winner, whose named was not released, checked into
the suburban Roseville lottery office with a winning $1,000 ticket
last week, lottery spokeswoman Judy Hohmann said. Office employees
looked through his records, however, and found he owed the state
more than $1,000.
   To close its transaction with the unlucky winner, the state
issued him a check for $0.00 _ and a tax form.
   Even though the winner didn't receive the money, he did, for a
fleeting moment, have income to offset his debt, Hohmann said, so
he wound up owing tax on a jackpot he never saw.
   The man threatened a guard before he left the office, and police
were looking for him in connection with the threat, Hohmann said.

<HEAD>Papp Raises Enough Money After Rejecting NEA Grant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Producer Joseph Papp has received pledges of
more than $60,000 after rejecting a $50,000 federal arts grant
because he doesn't like the Jesse Helms-inspired strings attached
to it.
   Donations to Papp, director of the New York Shakespeare
Festival, ranged from a $50,000 pledge from television producer
Mark Goodson to much smaller pledges, The New York Times reported
today.
   Papp rejected a $50,000 National Endowment for the Arts grant
because NEA recipients now must sign a form saying they agree to
abide by federal anti-obscenity legislation.
   The legislation was sponsored last fall by Helms, the Republican
senator from North Carolina, who objected to government funding for
exhibits by Robert Mappelthorpe and Andres Serrano.
   ``I cannot in all good conscience accept any money from the NEA
as long as the Helms-inspired amendment on obscenity is part of our
agreement,'' Papp wrote in a letter to the NEA on Thursday.
   Papp said that while he was happy with the private pledges, ``an
institution like mine needs the continuity of support that the NEA
provides. But maybe this will create a climate in which this
obscenity issue can be dealt with in a different way.''
   The NEA money was supposed to be used for Papp's annual Festival
Latino, a month-long showing of theater, movies and music from
Latin American cultures. Papp said the festival would be sponsored
from private foundations.
   Papp said his organization has applied for $550,000 in grants
for the 1990 season. But he told the NEA, ``We are prepared not to
accept this money should it be awarded while the Helms restriction
remains in force.''
   The law says NEA grants cannot be used to fund works that depict
``sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the sexual exploitation of children
or individuals engaged in sex acts and which, when taken as a
whole, do not have serious literary, artistic, political or
scientific merit.''

(BST) until June 1, 1991, allowing it only for research.
   Republican Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, who signed the legislation
Friday, vetoed an alternative bill that would have forbidden use of
the protein until six months after its commercial use is approved
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
   Thompson said he did not want the moratorium to extend later
than 1991 because BST use by farmers in other states could put
Wisconsin's dairy industry at a market disadvantage.
   The Minnesota Legislature approved a bill Thursday establishing
a one-year moratorium if the Wisconsin legislation became law.
   Supporters of the hormone warned that Wisconsin dairy farmers
could be hurt if the state became an ``island'' surrounded by
states that permitted its use. Opponents contended increased
production could push milk prices down, thus driving smaller dairy
farmers out of business.
   Democratic Sen. Russell D. Feingold, a leader of the
Legislature's campaign against BST or bovine growth hormone (BGH),
called the bill ``the first moratorium ever on BGH in the nation.''
   ``It's more than a victory. It's a start of what will be a
national movement,'' Feingold said.
   Democratic Rep. Barbara Gronemus said that although the new law
temporarily prevents farmers from buying the drug, the Republican
governor's vetoes may not prevent marketing of milk from test
animals.
   ``It appears that the milk from these test herds could be
used,'' she said. ``I'm really disappointed about that aspect of
it. To allow the byproducts to go into the food chain is really
unacceptable to me.''
   The moratorium stems from concern by the Legislature that
consumers will be leery of milk from treated cows, reducing sales
of cheese and other dairy products important to Wisconsin's economy.
   Some farm organizations argued the drug's ability to increase
milk production as much as 20 percent would help corporate farms
with large herds to dominate the market, putting smaller family
farms out of business.
   ``It's not feasible for ourselves to build a wall around this
state and prevent new technology from coming in here,'' the
governor said. ``It's going to be a sad day in Wisconsin when we
stop research.''
   The diet given treated cattle contains more fat than usual.
Critics say the process means added production expense that only
big farms can afford.
   Jeffrey Remsik, a spokesman for the Animal Health Institute,
said chemical companies that are developing BST are disappointed
with the moratorium.
   The new law damages the Dairy State's chances of attracting
biotechnology research, Remsik said. The governor's action ``tends
to undermine the traditional federal regulatory system and sends a
strong message that Wisconsin is not interested in new
technologies,'' he said.
   Remsik said a court may have to decide whether the measure
Thompson signed actually triggers the Minnesota moratorium.

   Two would-be burglars died when they became
stuck in the bricked-up chimney of a grocery store, police said.
   The owner of the store in the Bronx borough noticed a smell
coming from the chimney and police found two decomposed bodies in
it, police spokesman Fred Weiner said Friday. The bodies had been
there about a week.
   ``They found one body at the base of the chimney and underneath
they found a second body,'' Weiner said. ``It was an apparent
burglary that went wrong.''
   The corpses were not identified.

   A sharp earthquake jolted the
eastern San Francisco Bay area, rattling windows and sending
merchandise tumbling from the shelves of stores.
   The quake, which measured 4.6 on the Richter scale, occurred at
9:41 p.m. Friday and was centered in Walnut Creek, about 25 miles
east of San Francisco, according to the U.S. Geological Survey in
Menlo Park.
   The quake and two aftershocks, one at 9:47 p.m. measuring 4.3
and another at 9:59 measuring 2.5., occurred on the Concord fault
and were part of a swarm of mild quakes that shook the normally
placid fault earlier this month, said USGS spokeswoman Lou Page.
   There were no reports of injuries or serious damage, but the
quake spilled items into store aisles in several communities.
   Susanne Desser, a waitress at the Denny's restaurant in
Danville, said that while some customers ``kind of get a kick'' out
of earthquakes, others lose their appetites.
   ``A lot of people ordered, the quake hit and they didn't want to
eat,'' she said.
   In Concord, the six-story Mt. Diablo Hospital ``really shook,''
said nursing supervisor Mary Bacon.
   ``There was a sudden crack and then a rolling that goes on and
on,'' she said. ``Some of the patients and some of the employees
were shook up and were sick to their stomachs.''
   The quake knocked out power to 1,300 customers in Concord, east
of Walnut Creek, and scattered outages were reported in nearby
Alamo, said Pacific Gas &amp; Electric spokesman Brad Thomas. The Bay
Area Rapid Transit district stopped service to check the tracks,
but trains resumed running at 10:05 p.m.
   Mild shaking also was felt at the press box at Candlestick Park,
where the San Francisco Giants were in the sixth inning of a game
with the St. Louis Cardinals.
   Tremors of up to 5.5 on the Richter scale were felt in the Bay
Area on April 6 and April 18. None caused any major damage.
   The 7.1-magnitude quake that hit the region Oct. 17 claimed 67
lives and caused about $7.1 billion in damage.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 4 on the Richter scale can cause moderate
damage in the local area, a 5 considerable damage. A 7 reading is a
``major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage.

<TEXT>
   A paralyzed woman stricken with an incurable
disease died within an hour of being taken off a respirator after
she convinced a judge she wanted to be allowed to die.
   Albert Stussy said his 51-year-old wife, Thelma, was
disconnected from a respirator at 4:20 p.m. Friday and died between
5:05 and 5:10 p.m. He and their teen-age son and daughter were at
her bedside at Neumann Medical Center.
   ``We made sure she knew we loved her,'' Stussy said Friday
night. ``She was sedated very well with Valium. They gave her a
shot every 10 minutes and made sure she wasn't in any pain.''
   Mrs. Stussy had suffered from Lou Gehrig's disease, or
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, for two years and was admitted to
the hospital in late December. The degenerative disease destroys
the nervous system and paralyzes its victims.
   Mrs. Stussy was paralyzed from the neck down and had been in
constant pain. She could not speak, but communicated by blinking to
answer ``yes'' and moving her head slightly from side to side to
answer ``no.''
   In an emotional bedside hearing Wednesday, Mrs. Stussy blinked
once to tell Common Pleas Court Judge Nicholas M. D'Alessandro that
she wanted to be taken off the respirator. In a two-page ruling the
next day, the judge granted her wish, giving the hospital one week
to comply.
   The ventilator was turned off by hospital staff, not by her
regular physician, Dr. Leonard M. Popowich.
   ``He had some emotional hang up,'' Stussy said. ``I didn't
realize it until today.''
   Popowich testified Wednesday that he had no objection to taking
Mrs. Stussy off the respirator, but said he did not want to do it
personally.
   She and her family had asked to have the respirator removed, but
hospital officials, fearful of a lawsuit on criminal charges, asked
the judge to decide.
   Hospital attorney Claire Obade added that the hospital also was
forced to go to court because Pennsylvania has no statutes and only
a handful of legal precedents to guide it in right-to-die cases.
   In asking the court for permission to remove Mrs. Stussy from
the respirator, Obade cited a 1987 case in Philadelphia involving a
woman in a similar situation. The woman, known only as ``Jane
Doe,'' was granted her request.

   Thousands of police backed by armored
vans stormed the world's largest shipyard by land and sea today to
crush a three-day strike.
   Police said at least 24 people were injured, including 10
policemen, in the dawn raid on the Hyundai Heavy Industries Co.,
and 499 were arrested. Arrest warrants were issued for six fugitive
union leaders.
   Thousands of workers later battled police wielding clubs and
shields in hand-to-hand combat near the shipyard in Ulsan, a port
city about 200 miles southeast of Seoul.
   Some estimates said as many as 20,000 workers were involved in
the street protests, including many from affiliated Hyundai
companies in the area. As evening approached, the numbers of
protesters dwindled to several thousand.
   The riot police stormed the closed shipyard to rout about 2,000
workers holed up there.
   Authorities fired hundreds of tear-gas shells from at least 10
armored vans as bulldozers tore down 9-foot-high barricades erected
by the workers. An estimated 10,000 riot police rushed in, wearing
gas masks and helmets and carrying clubs and shields.
   Hundreds of workers retaliated by throwing firebombs, steel
bars, rocks and pieces of metal. Strikers fired several rounds from
at least one of about a dozen homemade canons, but it was not known
if anyone was injured from the blasts.
   About 600 combat police arrived in two patrol boats and
surrounded buildings along the shipyard's four-mile seafront. Three
police helicopters hovered overhead, urging workers to give up
peacefully.
   About 100 workers climbed up a crane to throw firebombs and
metal pipes at police below. Some strikers ran into buildings and
threw debris, firebombs and rocks from windows.
   Columns of black smoke, small fires and clouds of tear gas
filled the shipyard and surrounding area for several hours.
   Most of the strikers inside the shipyard fled during the morning
attack. Police said late today that only pockets of resistence
remained.
   ``Get out, police! Police, get out!'' chanted about 150 workers
who climbed a 240-foot crane erected on the docks.
   After today's raid, thousands of workers gathered in the streets
to denounce the police action, and some threw stones and firebombs
and fought with police. Protesters damaged or destroyed 22 police
vehicles, including two buses and five fire engines, police and
news reports said.
   Hyundai had requested government action to end the strike, which
threatened to spread to other industries. Negotiations broke down
just hours before the raid.
   The strike was not over wage issues but involved workers'
demands for the release from jail of four union leaders charged
with starting earlier protests.
   The company said the matter was a judicial issue and out of its
domain.
   The government issued a statement defending the shipyard raid,
saying ``the survival of the national economy was at stake.''
   Opposition politicians demanded a special session of the
National Assembly to investigate labor unrest.
   ``It is extremely regrettable the government carried out a
military-style operation to suppress the worker's strike,'' said
Kim Tae-shik, spokesman for the opposition Party for Peace and
Democracy. He called on the government to release the four jailed
union leaders.
   Last year, about 12,000 police firing tear gas stormed the
shipyard to end a 109-day strike.
   The Hyundai Group, owner of the shipyard, is one of South
Korea's largest conglomerates. It produces cars, ships, electronics
and other products. Shipyard sales last year were $1.5 billion, the
company said.
   About 20,000 of the shipyard's 24,000 employees are unionized.
According to the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Association, it is the
world's largest, capable of building 14 large ships simultaneously.
   Union leaders at other Hyundai subsidiaries issued a joint
statement threatening to stage sympathy protests.
   Hundreds of radical students protested today at campuses in
Inchon and the provincial city of Kwangju denouncing police action
against strikers, the South Korean news agency Yonhap said.
   In a labor dispute in Seoul, Ahn Dong-su, union leader at Korean
Broadcasting System, said operations would return to normal April
30, ending a 17-day strike over a new government-appointed
president.
   Ahn said he had received assurances the president would resign
``at an early date.'' Workers claimed the president was restricting
their press freedoms.

   The government today applauded a U.S. decision to
drop Japan from a list of unfair trade partners, but it said the
Bush administration was wrong to single out India as a violator.
   President Bush announced Friday he would cite only one country,
India, as a ``priority nation'' under a provision of a U.S. trade
law that provides for mandatory economic retaliation if foreign
trade barriers are not removed within a fixed period.
   A leading group of private businesses in India today called
Bush's action an ``unfortunate and an avoidable development.'' The
group, the Associated Chamber of Commerce and Industries, said both
the United States and India could have shown greater flexibility in
dealing with the trade issue.
   In a statement in Tokyo, Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama said,
``The government of Japan welcomes the decision by the U.S.
government not to name Japan a `priority foreign country' and
regards this as the proper one.''
   ``It has been the policy of the government of Japan that
economic issues between Japan and the United States should be
resolved through dialogue in the spirit of cooperation and joint
efforts,'' he said.
   Kabun Muto, minister of international trade and industry, also
welcomed Bush's announcement, but he expressed concern about the
naming of India.
   ``The (United States) one-sidedly cited India as a priority
nation, and I must say this may impair the framework of the
multilateral free-trade system,'' he said.
   The dropping of Japan from the list, however, came as a relief
to Japanese business leaders.
   Tokumasa Yoshida, president of Mazda Motor Co., told the
nationally circulated Asahi Shimbun newspaper that it was
reasonable for the United States to appreciate recent Japanese
efforts to lessen trade barriers.
   But many commentators said the relationship could turn hostile
unless the Japanese continue efforts to open their markets to U.S.
products.
   In today's editorial, the Asahi Shimbun said U.S. retaliation
may still come if Japan cannot show significant improvement in
allowing foreign competition.
   India has steadfastly refused to modify its restrictive trade
policies, which are designed to protect domestic industries by
limiting foreign investment and imposing high import duties.
   India has an $850 million trade surplus with the United States,
compared to Japan's surplus of $49 billion. The Japanese surplus
represents 45 percent of the total U.S. trade deficit of $109
billion.
   The United States is India's largest trading partner. India's
exports consist primarily of clothing, diamonds, crude oil and
cashew nuts. Its chief American imports are fertilizers, chemicals,
electronic parts and industrial materials.
   Under the 1988 U.S. Omnibus Trade Act, Washington can levy
tariffs of up to 100 percent on goods imported from a nation judged
as an unfair trader.

   A Chinese man who said he hijacked a plane to
Japan to escape political repression flew back to China today under
heavy police custody.
   A traveler on the same Air China flight said Zhang Zhenhai was
brought onto the plane before the other passengers and taken off
last, with police surrounding him on each end. He and his guards
sat in first class.
   The traveler, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he could
not tell if Zhang was handcuffed.
   China's official Xinhua News Agency reported Zhang's arrival but
did not say when he would be tried.
   Zhang, 36, hijacked a New York-bound Air China flight on Dec. 16
and demanded it fly to South Korea. The pilot landed in Fukuoka,
Japan, when Seoul refused landing rights.
   Zhang asked for political asylum, saying he took part in last
year's pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing that ended in an
army attack, and would face the death penalty in China.
   But Japan's high court said it doubted Zhang had been a
dissident and ordered his extradition. Japanese officials handed
him over to Chinese police earlier today.
   Human rights groups in Japan and abroad, including Amnesty
International, criticized the extradition order. They said Zhang
should be tried in Japan for the hijacking.
   Zhang's wife and child accompanied him during the hijacking but
did not appear to understand what was going on. They were returned
to China shortly after, and Chinese officials have refused to
comment on their fate.

   Authorities have jailed six Mexicans for
questioning about the abduction of a doctor taken to the United
States to face trial in the murder of an American drug agent, the
government announced.
   Officials also said that an informer for the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration had masterminded the kidnapping. The Los
Angeles Times today quoted the informer as saying he did so with
the approval of two DEA agents.
   Washington has denied that the DEA was involved in the
kidnapping or that U.S. officials had paid bounty hunters to abduct
the doctor.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and other Mexican officials
contend the April 2 kidnapping of Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain
violates Mexican law. Mexico has threatened to stop cooperating
with the United States in drug enforcement if it is proved that the
DEA was directly involved in the abduction.
   The Guadalajara gynecologist, abducted from his office and flown
to the United States, awaits trial in Los Angeles for alleged
involvement in the 1985 torture and murder of U.S. drug agent
Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena.
   Seven other Mexicans were being sought in the kidnapping case,
government spokesman Fernando Arias said late Friday.
   Reading from a prepared statement, Attorney General Enrique
Alvarez del Castillo said that the people who carried out the
kidnapping were armed and told the doctor they were Mexican federal
police.
   When the doctor arrived in El Paso, Texas, ``10 people
surrounded the plane, showed their Drug Enforcement Administration
credentials, and took Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain off the plane,''
the attorney general said.
   ``The kidnapping of Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain was organized
by Antonio Garate Bustamante, a self-styled DEA agent or informer
who has been sought by Mexican authorities since 1985,'' Alvarez
del Castillo said.
   He did not provide details of any earlier charges. He said a
warrant has been issued for the arrest of Garate Bustamante and six
others.
   The Los Angeles Times today quoted Garate Bustamante as saying
he arranged the abduction with the approval of two DEA agents. The
kidnapping was carried out by 10 Mexicans, including Mexican
federal policemen, who were promised a total of $100,000 to deliver
Alvarez to U.S. authorities, the Los Angeles Times quoted
Bustamante as saying. It identified him as a former Mexican
policeman.
   Garate Bustamante, who said he is paid $4,000 a month by the
DEA, lives in a fortified apartment in the Los Angeles area and
keeps automatic weapons at the ready, the Times reported.
   The DEA has denied published reports it paid bounty hunters to
capture the Mexican doctor and bring him to the United States, but
today Times' report quotes two unidentified DEA officials as saying
Garate Bustamante helped arrange the abduction.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said last week that DEA agents
were not involved in Alvarez Machain's capture in Mexico.
   On Friday, leading law-enforcement officers from 33 nations
meeting in Mexico City announced an agreement to exchange more
information and increase cooperation in the worldwide fight against
the drug trade.
   Speaking at the end of the three-day conference, acting DEA
administrator Terrence Burke said, ``We have agreed that we need to
improve on sharing more information, so we know what we are facing
in terms of production.''

   Rival Christian forces agreed to a
21-hour cease-fire today to allow residents of the embattled
hinterland to check on their property.
   Police said the truce went into effect at 9 a.m. in the eastern
flank of the Kesrouan province northeast of Beirut. The rival
forces have been battling for three months for control of the
Christian heartland.
   The truce, mediated by Maronite Catholic priest Bulos Naaman,
was enforced mainly to allow the displaced population of the
mountain villages of Daraya and Kleiat to check their homes and
property.
   Kleiat is controlled by Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces, a
right-wing coalition of Christian militias. Troops of rebel Gen.
Michel Aoun control Daraya.
   The cease-fire also will allow civilians trapped in the two
mountain resorts to leave, according to a police spokesman, who
cannot be named in line with regulations.
   That indicated more fighting was expected on the Kesrouan front
between Aoun's loyalists, estimated at 19,000, and Geagea's 6,000
irregulars.
   Elsewhere in the 310-square-mile enclave, the rival forces
skirmished with automatic rifles, police said.
   No casualties were reported today. Police say the showdown for
mastery of the enclave has killed 916 and wounded 2,441 since Jan.
30.
   The power struggle, the worst inter-Christian confrontation of
the 15-year-old civil war, has inflicted damage estimated at $1
billion and forced 400,000 people to flee from the enclave, which
housed about 1 million people.

<TEXT>
   Mario Vargas Llosa says he'll oversee radical
economic reforms if elected president, and the first-time candidate
accused his opponent of not having enough political experience to
be Peru's leader.
   The nationally televised speech Friday was the first by the
rightist candidate since he was nearly beaten by centrist contender
Alberto Fujimori in the first round of presidential elections April
8.
   Vargas Llosa, an internationally known novelist, said his poor
showing in the first round was ``a good lesson, and I hope to
profit from it.''
   He won 32 percent of the vote, but Fujimori, a virtual unknown
whose popularity surged in the final weeks before the election,
took 30 percent. Recent polls predicted Vargas Llosa, who has never
held a political office, would lose the runoff to Fujimori by 51
percent to 38 percent.
   In the speech, Vargas Llosa said his policies ``were not
understood by many'' Peruvians. He promised to explain them more
clearly in the weeks leading up to a runoff election, likely to
take place June 3.
   The novelist's economic ``shock'' plan calls for privatization
of Peru's huge state enterprises, elimination of agricultural and
industrial subsidies, and drastic cuts in import and export tariffs.
   In his speech he criticized Fujimori _ an agricultural engineer
who has never held political office _ for his inexperience and his
lack of a political platform.
   Fujimori is ``not in a condition to confront the grave threat
President (Alan) Garcia will leave as the inheritance of the next
government,'' Vargas Llosa said. ``The present situation is a time
bomb set to explode at the beginning of the next term.''
   Fujimori failed to produce a political platform 10 days ago, as
promised.
   The next president will face a huge challenge in governing Peru,
which suffers from hyperinflation and a rapidly shrinking economy.
   The Maoist Shining Path rebels are waging war with the
government and control much of Peru's mountains and jungles. More
than 18,000 people have died in the 10 years since the Shining Path
took up arms, the government says.

   The Discovery astronauts breathed
``a little sigh of relief'' after they finished the tricky task of
putting the Hubble Space Telescope in orbit.
   During a news conference this morning from space, the five crew
members said there was little time for talk or celebration
Wednesday when the telescope was released from the shuttle's
50-foot robot arm.
   ``You have to realize that had we just spent a pretty tense time
with a $1.5 billion telescope and we have a couple billion-dollar
orbiter and we just separated the two and we're still within inches
of each other,'' Discovery Commander Loren Shriver said. ``Saying
something was the last thing on my mind.''
   Mission specialist Steve Hawley, who gently guided the robot arm
as it hoisted the Hubble out of the cargo bay, said he didn't
really think about the accomplishment until after it was all over.
   ``Only later in the day when we got a chance to take a breath
and maybe give out a little sigh of relief and think, `Gee, we
actually got it done.' And at that moment I think we were all very
pleased and satisfied to be part of the team that did this,'' he
said.
   Hawley added that there was really only one tense moment during
the telescope's deployment: ``Just the part from beginning to the
end.''
   The crew members took time out today to answer questions radioed
to them from reporters at the Johnson Space Center in Houston and
Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. They were spending
most of the day stowing their gear and experiments and testing the
shuttle's control systems in preparation for Sunday's landing at
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan were
prepared to perform an emergency space walk Wednesday if there had
been trouble deploying the telescope. They had trained for such a
procedure for years, but one wasn't necessary.
   ``Either one of us was trained and ready to work,'' Sullivan
said.
   Both astronauts already have walked in space on previous
missions, but McCandless admitted to being ``a little disappointed
not to have an EVA,'' for extra-vehicular activity, or spacewalk.
   The astronauts agreed that the mission was a special one since
Hubble will enable astronomers to search the heavens for new worlds
and clues to creation itself.
   ``Almost everybody seems to be familiar with what the telescope
is and what it was designed to do,'' Shriver said.
   ``It's hard to go somewhere and find someone who has never heard
of the Hubble Space Telescope,'' added pilot Charles Bolden. ``It
makes little kids' eyes light up. It makes little kids want to
learn how to add and subtract and study science.
   ``And that's extremely gratifying to know that you're part of a
mission that seems to have excited the nation as well as the world
about something.''

   A Soviet pilot suffering radiation poisoning from
his efforts to stem the Chernobyl nuclear disaster was stable early
today after undergoing a potentially life-saving bone-marrow
transplant.
   Anatoly Grishchenko, 53, who has been hailed as a hero in the
Soviet Union for his work to put a cement cap on the Chernobyl
reactor, suffers from a pre-leukemia condition.
   The life-giving marrow, from a donor in Besancon, France, was
carried in an ice cooler and rushed to Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Center after arriving at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on a
commercial flight at 5 p.m. Friday. Bone marrow can lose its
effectiveness after 24 hours.
   The relatively simple transplant began at 6:53 p.m. and ended at
2:40 a.m., center spokeswoman Susan Edmonds said.
   ``He is stable. He handled the transfusion very well and there
are no problems,'' she said. ``The next step is to see if the
marrow will grow.''
   Doctors should know in about three weeks whether the new marrow
will save Grishchenko's life, Edmonds said.
   The procedure follows two weeks of treatment for Grishchenko at
the cancer center, including radiation therapy.
   Edmonds said starting the procedure was as simple as hanging the
bag of about one quart of marrow and connecting it to a catheter
leading to Grishchenko's heart.
   She said a sterile environment was being maintained in his
hospital room, where he would be expected to stay the next 35 to 40
days.
   The marrow, donated by a 42-year-old woman, arrived one day
after the fourth anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in
the Ukraine.
   Grishchenko was honored as a hero for making five flights over
Chernobyl in the four days following an explosion and fire at the
reactor on April 26, 1986.
   He flew through the hot, intensely radioactive gases spewing
from the plant to survey the damage and to dump tons of sand and
wet concrete onto the wreckage.
   According to official figures, 31 people were killed. Unofficial
reports said at least 250 died. The blast scattered radioactive
cesium, strontium and plutonium isotopes across much of the
Ukraine, Byelorussia and Russia and sent a cloud of radioactive gas
around the world.
   In September 1988, Grishchenko was found to have the medical
condition, typified by low counts of blood platelets needed for
clotting and of white blood cells to fight infection and disease.
   Grishchenko is the first Chernobyl victim to receive medical
care in the United States. He has up to a 75 percent chance of
survival without a recurrence of the condition for five years, said
Edmonds.
   The transplant was arranged by Cap Parlier, light helicopter
testing and evaluation director for McDonnell Douglas Corp., who
said he had spoken to Grishchenko a few times by telephone since
the Soviet civilian helicopter test pilot arrived at Hutchinson on
April 11.
   The transfusion culminated a drama that began shortly after
daybreak Friday at the Jean-Minjoz hospital in Besancon in
east-central France.
   Dr. Patricia Stewart of the Hutchinson center arrived by
helicopter at the French hospital's transfusion center and watched
two French doctors extract nearly a quart of marrow from the donor,
a woman who wanted anonymity, in a two-hour procedure similar to
drawing blood.
   After the liquid was filtered and packaged for travel, Stewart
and the container were rushed by helicopter to Geneva for a
commercial jet flight to Seattle via London.
   In Seattle, Stewart was met at the door of Fred Hutchinson
Center by Grishchenko's wife, Galina.
   The French donor was located in a search of bone marrow
registries in the United States, France and seven other countries.
Her marrow was found to be a near perfect match.
   Grishchenko, who has two sons and a granddaughter, was issued
lead-lined clothing and the copters were equipped with extra lead
shielding. He was treated soon after the Chernobyl flights for
radiation sickness.

   The Hubble Space Telescope was
awakened from its self-induced sleep today but it was still without
the use of its high-speed antennas, and its science instruments
were on hold, unable to begin any observations.
   ``We are out of the `safe-mode' right now,'' said Steve Terry, a
supervisor of the engineers controlling the telescope. He said the
telescope was running on a ``normal control-all mode,'' where its
own computers and sensors guide where it is pointing.
   Discovery's astronauts, meanwhile, packed their gear for a
return to Earth Sunday, made some last-minute observations of Earth
and talked with ground-based reporters about their flight.
   Pilot Charles Bolden said he was especially upbeat about the
widespread public awareness of the telescope, which is expected
eventually to look back 14 billion light years _ nearly to the
birth of the universe.
   ``It's hard to go somewhere and find someone who has never heard
of the Hubble Space Telescope,'' said Bolden. ``It makes little
kids' eyes light up. It makes little kids want to learn how to add
and subtract and study science.''
   The telescope's big eye has remained open, but Hubble had been
in a ``safe mode'' with all motion stopped because of earlier
problems in linking the high-speed dish antennas with a relay
satellite. The antennas are the primary links for relaying
scientific data to the ground.
   Terry said that even in the safe mode, one of the tape recorders
in the telescope reads telemetry signals from all its systems and
that these would be played to Earth and analyzed when the antennas
are working properly.
   ``We expect to use that data to investigate what happened,'' he
said. Engineers are able to send commands to the telescope via its
secondary antennas but the communications system is not useful for
scientific data, which must be transmitted at a high rate of speed.
   ``We're putting the scientific instruments in a hold mode, in
effect a standby mode,'' he said.
   Shortly after 6 a.m. EDT, controllers at the Goddard Space
Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., completed a series of commands
that took the telescope out of its safe mode and then began to run
a 12-hour computer program to monitor Hubble's health.
   It will take another day before the $1.5 billion telescope is
operating the way it was supposed to at this point in the startup
process, said Hubble deputy project manager Jean Olivier.
   ``We're backing up to a very deliberate and slow and careful
approach to these problems,'' Olivier said Friday. ``This is not
the time to do anything dumb.''
   The telescope problems have put the flight center several days
behind, but the five astronauts who deployed it earlier this week
were sticking to their schedule.
   Landing is scheduled for 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday at Edwards Air
Force Base, Calif., but flight controllers were keeping a close
watch on the weather.
   Winds were predicted to be about 20 mph with gusts up to 29 mph.
Mission rules dictate that headwinds cannot exceed 29 mph at
touchdown.
   The shuttle carries enough supplies to stay in orbit three days
beyond Sunday if necessary, NASA said.
   Mission Control awakened the crew members at about 1:30 a.m. EDT
today by playing the song, ``Cosmos.''
   ``Thanks for the wake-up music, it's pretty appropriate for
today,'' said Commander Loren Shriver.
   ``The song was selected in honor of Hubble Space Telescope,
which is now open for business,'' said Mission Control commentator
James Hartsfield.
   The astronauts were to finish up their experiments and
photography today and pack for the trip home. They also planned to
hold a news conference from space with reporters at the Johnson
Space Center.
   Shriver and pilot Charles Bolden were to run through a series of
tests to make certain the shuttle's computers and control jets were
ready for return to Earth.
   The crew deployed Hubble on Wednesday but they had stayed close
to the telescope in case there was trouble opening the aperture
door. Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan
were prepared to perform a space walk today to crank it open in
orbit 380 miles above Earth.
   But that proved unnecessary when the door was opened Friday
morning, exposing the telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch eye to
starlight for the first time.
   Two of Hubble's four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stopped
working when the door opened, but engineers later got them back on
line. The gyroscopes were knocked out by the motion and that, too,
kept the telescope in the safe mode, said Dave Drachlis, director
of orbital verifications at Goddard.
   A colleague, Steve Terry, said Hubble's systems were set at
conservative limits for the first operations and that caused many
malfunctions. There also were two communications outages totaling
several hours.
   Hubble is designed with safe modes so it can be ``the master of
its own destiny'' in case contact with an orbiting communications
system is lost for extended periods, Terry said.
   NASA had planned to release its first test image from the
telescope on Tuesday, showing an open star cluster in the
constellation Carina. But Terry said that would be delayed because
of the antenna problems. Scientific data will follow in a month or
two.
   The telescope, named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble,
will enable astronomers over its 15-year working lifetime to look
back 14 billion years and possibly determine the age of the
universe.
   The universe is believed to have been created about 15 billion
years ago in a cosmic explosion.
   Hubble provided the basis for the big-bang theory of creation.
He discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding and
that the farther the galaxy is from Earth, the faster it is moving
away.

<HEAD>Policeman and His Father Killed in Natal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A black police constable and
his father were killed by gunmen, police reported today, and a
police general said the nation's crime rate has reached alarming
proportions.
   Police said five gunmen broke into the house of 24-year-old
Constable J.F. Zuma in Mpumalanga outside Durban on Friday night,
demanded ammunition, then shot him twice in the chest.
   Police said Zuma's father, in another room, heard the attack and
tried to flee from the house but was also shot and killed. The
constable's wife and young children escaped, and the gunmen took a
shotgun and two pistols when they left, police said in their daily
unrest report.
   Police also reported several incidents of arson and the stoning
of trains and police vehicles in black townships over a wide area
of the country during the 24 hours from Friday to this morning.
   Officers used used shotguns, rubber bullets and tear gas to
disperse crowds in black townships. There were several injuries and
arrests, but no deaths reported in the incidents.
   Gen. Jaap Joubert, head of the police Criminal Investigations
Division, told a seminar in Natal province that crime had reached
alarming proportions with almost 1.5 million serious crimes
committed last year.
   He said there were 4,037 a day and 186 every hour, with fewer
than 8,000 detectives to deal with them. On an average day in South
Africa, Joubert said, there were 32 murders, 56 rapes, 199
robberies, 160 cases of car theft and more than 500 cases of
house-breaking.
   The national police force is also experiencing a drain of
officers, with an average 22 a day resigning during the first three
months of this year. The government recently announced a pay raise
for police and ordered that policemen can no longer belong to any
political party or movement.
   Meanwhile, about 3,000 people gathered in Atteridgeville
township outside Pretoria today for the funeral of Pan-Africanist
Congress leader Jeff Masemola. Masemola, who died in a car crash
two weeks ago, was freed in October from a life prison term after
serving 27 years for sabotage.
   Police set up roadblocks at entrances to the township, turning
away some vehicles and questioning people headed to the funeral.
Pan-Africanist Congress leaders said more mourners would have come
if not for the police action.
   The Pan-Africanist Congress broke away from the African National
Congress in the 1950s and disagrees with the ANC's policies of
negotiating with the white government and recognizing white
ownership of land.
   Cunningham Noxukwana, general secretary of a PAC-affiliated
union organization, spoke at the funeral, criticizing the ANC's
plans to hold talks next week with President F.W. de Klerk. ``Our
choice is to fight on,'' said Noxukwana. ``A sellout is very thick
in the air.''

   Led by the father of an 8-year-old girl who was held
by kidnappers for 78 days, about 2,000 people on Saturday marched
through Rome demanding that the government step up its battle
against abduction.
   The marchers included relatives of the five people still in the
hands of kidnappers.
   ``We want to show we are united,'' said Imerio Tacchella, a
leading sportswear manufacturer whose daughter, Patrizia, was freed
by police April 17.
   The marchers, who met with Interior Minister Antonio Gava,
carried signs reading ``So That Patrizia May Be The Last.''
   Three people were arrested for her kidnapping, and police are
investigating evidence they were involved in previous abductions of
young people.
   The marchers also included 20-year-old Cesare Casella, who was
held as a hostage for more than two years in the mountains of
southern Calabria.
   ``So many people did things for me, this is the least I can do
today,'' Casella said.

   Uganda has freed more than 2,000 former
guerrillas from prisons after they pledged not to resume fighting
government forces, the government said Saturday.
   Their release raises to 5,000 the number of former rebels
released from detention in the past 18 months, Interior Minister
Ibrahim Mukiibi said.
   The latest prisoners to be set free were captured by government
troops in the eastern border areas three years ago. They were
fighting for separate guerrilla armies under former defense
minister Peter Otai and former prime minister Otema Allimadi.
   The rebels seek the overthrow of President Yoweri Museveni, who
seized power in a 1986 coup.
   About 100 other rebel prisoners have been kept in detention and
will face charges they committed war crimes, Mukiibi said.

   Some of it is hype, some of it is genuine
commitment and some is begrudging acceptance of reality. Whatever,
American corporations are becoming environmentalists, or at least
environmentally conscious.
   This year's crop of glossy annual reports sent by corporations
to stockholders every spring is green with environmentalism. Firms
are eager to tell about their good citizenship on planet Earth.
   Texaco brags that mussels taken from its offshore oil rigs are
served in the finest California restaurants.
   Dow Chemical touts the environmental awards it has won.
   Carolina Power &amp; Light tells how conservation has saved 1.75
million kilowatts.
   Even the tiny Central Vermont Public Service Corp. wants
stockholders to know that it has invested in a power generating
plant that burns waste wood.
   Not so long ago, business was hostile to environmentalism. It
saw the movement as an advocate of restrictions that would impede
operations, require big, non-revenue generating outlays, undermine
competitiveness.
   Environmentalists were looked on in corporate boardrooms as
``pointy headed liberals that really didn't know business,'' says
Bruce Smart, former Commerce Department official in the Reagan
Administration.
   ``We had a lot of name-calling, a lot of rhetoric on both
sides,'' says Alexander Trowbridge, former president of the
National Association of Manufacturers and former oil executive. But
as it turned out, he says, ``environmental improvement has been a
corollary to economic growth.''
   Still, there's some grumbling.
   Marco, Inc., in the business of producing coal and natural gas
and transporting natural gas, complains in its annual report,
``Each of our business segments has the potential to be impacted
adversely by the environment issues being debated both in
Washington, D.C. and in states throughout the country ...''
   ``We believe that many of these issues are being addressed
politically rather than with a more deliberate approach based on a
sound, rational review of scientific data.''
   And Inland Steel Industries, in its annual report, says a
Democratic clean air bill in the Senate would have imposed
standards ``unscientific and unattainable for steel and other
affected industries.''
   But they are exceptions. Most companies which make a potentially
polluting product or use a polluting process, have become
environmentally prideful.
   ``Mussels are especially sensitive to pollutants, yet they
thrive on the legs of Texaco's Habitat platform off the coast of
California,'' says Texaco's annual report.
   ``When a marine firm discovered that the water around the
platform exceeds stronger state water quality requirements for
growing mussels, it arranged with Texaco to gather the mussels from
the platform and sell them to gourmet restaurants from Los Angeles
to San Francisco,'' Texaco says.
   Phelps Dodge Corp., which produces one billion tons of copper a
year, tells of plans to cover a 60-year-old pile of tailings with a
golf course.
   ``Simply complying with environmental regulations is not
enough,'' the company says.
   ``Papermaking is a water-intensive process. It takes thousands
of gallons to make a ton of coated paperboard,'' says the Mead
Corp. So how much extra water will be pumped from the river for use
in Mead's new 1,000-ton-a-day coated board expansion in Alabama?
   ``None, thanks to the fact that water once used only for cooling
will be recycled and used in the manufacturing process.''
   Dow Chemical tells one of its secrets: ``Dow gives plant
managers a direct incentive to reduce waste by charging each plant
for all waste management costs.''
   Dow brags it has reduced its plants' air emissions by 85 percent
since 1974 and seeks to cut them another 50 percent in five years.
   ``Nearly 75 million pounds of polyethylene milk bottles became
drain pipes, lumber replacements and recycling containers in
1989.,'' says Dow. ``Nearly all the scrap from Dow's plastic foam
production is recycled or sold rather than being disposed of in
landfills.''
   McDonald's Corp., which had been taking a public relations
beating because of all that greasy waste paper and polystyrene it
generates, fills its annual report with conservation messages.
   Inside, McDonald's reprints a letter received from Dan Getty,
11: ``If we stop wasting resources, our land will be clean. If we
don't stop, we won't have anything left.''
   Perhaps in response, McDonald's came up with a McSolution:
``McRecycle,'' a $100 million plan to buy high chairs,
wastebaskets, insulation from recycled materials and to use paper
bags made from recycled newspapers. Its first step was to ballyhoo
the program in full-page newspaper ads.

<TEXT>
   European Community leaders today opened
talks to consider French and German appeals for faster movement
toward a political merger of their 12 nations.
   French President Francois Mitterrand, Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher of Britain and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl joined a
stream of prime ministers and their aides at the medieval Dublin
Castle on an overcast day in Dublin, the Irish capital.
   The Western European nations, who already plan to form a single
open market by the end of 1992, are now beginning to discuss ways
of bringing their political systems into closer alignment.
   Reacting to the profound political changes in Eastern Europe,
Mitterrand and Kohl are urging faster movement toward a political
union.
   Mrs. Thatcher was expected to oppose their calls for a political
union of the Economic Community trading bloc by 1993.
   EC officials were also expected to discuss plans for
reunification of the two Germanys, the original reason for today's
meeting before the French and German appeals for political unity
surfaced.
   Also on the agenda is a plan to forge closer relations with the
emerging democracies in Eastern Europe and draw them closer to the
West.
   Before discussing political union, the leaders endorsed a
three-stage plan for bringing East Germany into the European
Community. The agreement would benefit East Germany's backward
economy by bringing it into a trade bloc of 320 million people.
West Germany is already an influential EC member.
   The first stage calls for an interim adjustment period starting
July 2, when the two Germanys merge their currencies. The second
stage begins with formal unification of the two Germanys, which is
planed for late next year. From then on community laws will apply
to what is now East German territory. But it will be allowed
certain exemptions, for example on rules about state subsidies and
environmental regulations. In the final stage, for which no
deadline has been set, all European Community rules would apply.
   Security was tight in the city's center for the gathering.
Authorities banned aircraft from flying over the 13th-century
castle and deployed the Rangers, an elite anti-terrorist unit.
   Mrs. Thatcher is a prime target of the Irish Republican Army,
which tried to assassinate her with a bomb in 1984. The IRA is
fighting to rid Northern Ireland of British rule and unite the
province with the Irish Republic.
   The officials' talks could be heated at the one-day summit.
   ``We hear a great deal about political union,'' a British
government spokesman said on condition of anonymity today. But he
told reporters Mrs. Thatcher ``will try to get behind the words and
get their meaning.''
   Mrs. Thatcher has resisted radical plans for the economic and
monetary unity.
   Analysts say a political merger of the EC countries probably
would include a common foreign and security policy. Some predict
the EC countries eventually will become a kind of United States of
Europe but still maintain their distinct languages and cultures.
   Some leaders in the trading bloc like the Mitterrand-Kohl
proposal.
   Ireland's prime minister, Charles Haughey, told reporters
Friday, ``Look at the speed of change in Europe in the last few
months. Are we to be stranded on the beach of inactivity?''
   ``I am keen on moving to political union, and I want to take the
summit as far forward as it can,'' he said.
   Haughey said Mrs. Thatcher was not alone in her concerns,
however.
   ``Not just the British but other member states have, perhaps,
reservations, or at least questions that they want to ask,'' he
told RTE, the Irish state television.
   The community already is pressing to remove by late 1992 the
many barriers preventing the free flow of money, goods, services
and people among the countries.
   Moreover, it has begun a drive for an economic and monetary
union, which would lead to a single currency and system of central
banks. A special conference will open in December to change the
EC's founding treaty to permit the creation of new institutions.
   The European Community members are Belgium, Britain, Denmark,
France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.

   Business and organized labor say
Brazil's economic ``shock plan'' is driving the nation toward
recession, but the poor think President Fernando Collor de Mello
has the right idea.
   ``I hadn't eaten meat in so long, I'd forgotten what it tasted
like,'' said Derly Rosa Perreira dos Santos, 25, who works as a
maid and lives in a shantytown of Rio's poor North Zone. ``Now I
can afford it twice a week.''
   Record annualized inflation of 4,854 percent has fallen
dramatically since Collor announced his ``New Brazil'' plan March
16, one day after taking office as the country's first
democratically elected president in 29 years.
   It put an 18-month freeze on savings deposits of more than
$1,200 and limited withdrawals from money market funds to $600 or
20 percent of the value, whichever was greater.
   About $115 billion was frozen, 80 percent of all bank deposits
in Latin America's largest economy.
   Collor also cut spending, imposed new taxes and promised to sell
many of the 188 state-owned companies to eliminate the $31 billion
federal budget deficit.
   There is disagreement over the inflation rate for April _ the
government says zero and several independent institutions estimate
25 percent _ but all agree the threat of hyperinflation is gone.
   ``Food and medicine are cheaper and the bus fare has stopped
rising every week,'' said Mrs. dos Santos, who has two children and
rides the bus to work. ``I've even been able to save a little money
the past month.''
   Spending on cheap housewares and appliances has surged.
   ``Our stores in poor areas are selling about 10 to 15 percent
more,'' said Fernando Martinho of the TeleRio chain of appliance
stores. ``Our outlets in middle class and wealthy areas report
stagnant sales, or even a small drop.''
   Mrs. dos Santos said that, if inflation remained low, she hoped
to buy a mattress for her children, who sleep on blankets on the
floor of the family's concrete hut.
   Poor Brazilians have little sympathy for wealthy people with
frozen bank accounts, now referred to in the press as ``nouveau
poor.''
   More than half the workers in Brazil earn $150 a month or less,
while the richest 10 percent of the country's 150 million people
live in luxury.
   Nilda Modena da Silva praised Collor for freezing the accounts
and said: ``While I had no money to buy bread, the rich threw food
in the trash.''
   She is not happy about zero inflation, however, because that
means pay will not go up, and ``how can he (Collor) freeze a
mother's salary?''
   Mrs. da Silva works as a janitor and supports her two children
on the minimum wage of about $75 a month.
   Opinion about the economic plan seems evenly divided in the
middle class, but Collor gets low marks from the rich.
   A survey by the respected firm Research International found a
sense among the upper 10 percent of reduced social standing, ``loss
and humiliation.''
   Antonio Ermirio de Moraes, president of the Votorantin group,
Brazil's biggest private company, said on a television talk show he
considered emigrating after having $500 million caught in the
freeze.
   Many businessmen feel betrayed because they supported Collor
against socialist Luis Inacio Lula da Silva in the December
election. They accuse the president of reneging on promises of
free-market reform.
   ``We are living in an economic dictatorship,'' said business
consultant Alexandre Barros. ``Never in the history of this country
has there been so little economic freedom.
   ``The name of the game is no longer to be an effcient
entrepeneur, but to be a political operator who can pressure the
government into releasing your money. There are no market criteria
at all.''
   Organized labor agrees with management in this case.
   Official figures say unemployment has grown from 3.5 percent to
more than 9 percent since March 15.
   The huge, foreign-owned auto plants that ring Sao Paulo,
Brazil's largest city, have put 80 percent of their employees on
furlough and about 300,000 construction workers have been laid off.
   ``This plan will lead to a depression far worse than the
hyperinflationary spiral which it was supposedly going to save us
from,'' said Jose Olivio Miranda of the Central Workers Union, the
largest labor federation, which represents about 12 million workers.
   Layoffs have led thousands of people who migrated to the
industrialized south to return home. In mid-April, buses from Sao
Paulo to the poor northeast carried 1,700 passengers a day, twice
the usual number.
   Gustavo Franco, an economist at Rio's Pontifical Catholic
University, said a downturn was necessary to curb inflation.
   ``Once the cost of living comes down, it is relatively simple to
restart growth,'' he said. ``We have a very strong economy with a
solid industrial base.''
   Luiz Carlos Bresser Pereira, a former finance minister, said:
``The government has taken necessary steps to permanently bring
down inflation. First we need to stabilize the economy, then the
government should implement ... policies to help the poor.''
   Herbert de Souza, director of the Brazilian Institute of Social
and Economic Analysis, is less sanguine.
   ``With the poverty we've got, Brazil can't take a deep
recession,'' he said.
   ``The first impact of the plan may have helped the poor, but
that is temporary and will be erased with a recession. The measures
are now popular because people are looking at the immediate impact
and not consequences.''

   Enter Maria, a doctor in Havana, who was a 28-year-old widow in
1985.
   A cousin of Mustelier, who lived in Miami, was Maria's close
friend. The cousin asked her to write Mustelier, because no one
else did, and to mail him reading material and money for
incidentals.
   She agreed, never thinking the relationship would develop.
   ``He never thought about love,'' she said. ``He had had two
marriages that did not work out. He had this idea of dedication to
the fatherland, and he did not think about romance.
   ``I would write every week. He would say he looked at the world
through my eyes. I would tell him how things were on the street,
about fashion, what I saw on TV.
   ``The affection that developed between us was first a great and
powerful friendship, and later a love developed. ... I didn't think
he would fall in love with me through letters and, of course, when
he told me, I was in shock.''
   For much of their correspondence, he had never even seen her
photograph.
   Mustelier, who is white, did not know she was black, Maria said.
Racial issues intrude on personal relationships in Cuba, although
not nearly so much as in the United States.
   She tried twice to visit him in the prison at Santiago, 600
miles from Havana, but was turned away because she was not a close
relative.
   In the spring of 1987, Mustelier and some other inmates were
moved to a prison in the capital.
   She will never forget the day they met: June 12, 1987.
   Three months later, they were married in a two-hour prison
ceremony, with about 20 people in attendance. The wedding banquet
was ice cream, soda and snacks.
   After that, she could see him every 21 days.
   Each time, she said, ``Since early morning my heart was
pounding, because I knew I was going to see him.''
   Her husband knew she had no time to eat before the visits, so he
sometimes saved his meager lunch for her.
   ``He would bring me his lunch, his piece of chicken, his piece
of meat,'' she said.
   On one visit, two years ago, the male guards strip-searched
Maria and sexually abused her. Mustelier was enraged and refused to
eat for 19 days.
   In addition to the consequences of hunger strikes, Mustelier
said he suffers from the results of cruel treatment.
   Castro has claimed there never has been an instance of torture
in more than 31 years of the Cuban revolution, but here are some of
Mustelier's complaints:
   _For two years, he was held in a white cell with nothing but a
500-watt electric bulb. The constant glare made him nearsighted,
and the condition is becoming progressively worse.
   _Loud horns blown by guards to keep him from sleeping cost him
40 percent of his hearing.
   _His arms and legs bear the scars of bayonet attacks by guards,
and his jaw was broken once. Mustelier's legs still are inflamed
from the last hunger strike.
   He once was handcuffed to two other inmates and placed in a cell
six feet high, six long and three wide. If two of them lay
side-by-side, the third had to lie on top because of the handcuffs.
   After 24 hours, Mustelier managed to remove the handcuffs. The
guards threatened to put them back on, but he said: ``For you to
put the chains back on, you'll have to kill us.''
   An officer sided with the inmates and, although the three were
kept in the cell several more days, they were not handcuffed.
   Despite his prison ordeal, Mustelier looks surprisingly healthy,
perhaps younger than his 47 years. Seven weeks after ending his
last hunger strike, he has gained 40 pounds and worries about
becoming fat.
   If he is embittered, he doesn't show it. Laughter often
punctuates his stories of life in prison, even his description of
being overrun by roaches and mosquitos.
   ``We used to say they were the big allies of our jailers,'' he
said.
   Did he ever count the days during his 105-day hunger strike?
``No, because after counting them, you worry and this weighs on
you,'' he said, and laughed again.
   Yoga and an hour of physical exercise every day helped Mustelier
endure the long confinement. Like Maria, he found comfort in
religion.
   In his last hunger strike, his rosary was always with him.
   He showed a visitor a book of religious verses he had since
1988. Despite daily use, it was nearly in mint condition.
   He opened the book with great care, not touching the pages
beyond the margins.
   ``Every verse filled me with peace and tranquillity,'' he said.
   Mustelier wrote love poems to Maria, whom he calls Caruca, and
gave her a collection of them in September for their second wedding
anniversary.
   One, translated from the Spanish, reads:
   ``Your appearance produces not only happiness, but joy.
Happiness is a momentary state of emotion, joy is a state of
satisfaction and deep feeling. With that, I will look upon you as a
gift of spring.''

   The Kremlin again rebuffed Lithuania's attempts to
open formal talks on the republic's independence drive, and
Lithuania's deputies in the Supreme Soviet legislature resigned,
according to news reports.
   Also, Mikhail S. Gorbachev's spokesman today praised a
French-West German proposal to defuse tensions over Lithuania,
raising the possibility it could serve as a basis for compromise
between the Baltic republic and the Kremlin.
   Lithuania's Vilnius Radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting
Corp. in London on Friday night, quoted Bronius Kuzmickas, the
deputy chairman of Lithuania's Supreme Council legislature, as
saying that a parliamentary delegation had met with some
high-ranking officials in Moscow.
   But the officials reiterated Gorbachev's position that no talks
with the government would take place unless Lithuania halts its
drive for independence, the radio said.
   In Moscow today, the national Supreme Soviet heard a formal
resignation by Lithuanian deputies and a declaration by Estonian
deputies that they would suspend their membership until Moscow
began formal talks with their republic on independence, Soviet
television reported.
   Estonian deputies hold 13 places in the 542-member Supreme
Soviet. Lithuanian deputies, who have attended only as observers
since their republic declared independence on March 11, held 15
places.
   The Soviet Union annexed Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia in 1940.
The parliament of Estonia has voted to become independent at an
unspecified later date, and Latvia is scheduled to vote on the
issue next week.
   Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene said her
government still hopes to begin talks without backing off
independence decisions, but it is considering a proposed temporary
freeze on secessionist actions as the maximum concession it might
offer Moscow.
   ``This is a compromise which should be viewed as the maximum.
This is the limit,'' she told a Friday night news conference,
according to the Soviet news agency Tass.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis has said the
republic's legislature, the Supreme Council, will consider the
freeze proposal, which came from the leaders of France and Germany.
The legislature is scheduled to reconvene Wednesday.
   Gorbachev's spokesman, Arkady Maslennikov, called the proposal
for Lithuania to temporarily suspend its secessionist actions a
``constructive signal'' reflecting growing sentiment in Lithuania
and abroad that the republic must ``return to the road of reason.''
   Lithuania wants an immediate dialogue, Landsbergis said Friday,
and ``a termination of the Soviet economic blockade against
Lithuania would be beneficial to the atmosphere of this dialogue.''
   The Kremlin has imposed a blockade on gas, oil and other
supplies to Lithuania as part of the effort to force the republic
to stop its independence movement.
   Tass reported today that coal had been added to the embargo
list. Much of the coal Lithuania consumes is imported from Poland,
and the republic owes about $1.6 million for coal supplies, so they
have been stopped, the news agency said.
   Vilnius Radio reported that medicines including antibiotics were
in short supply, but that the situation was not believed to be
critical.
   On Friday in Washington, State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher said Mrs. Prunskiene had been granted a U.S. visa for
unofficial, business travel. He said she was expected to visit
sometime next week.
   The United States and other Western countries have refused to
impose sanctions on the Soviet Union for its efforts to stop
Lithuania's independence drive.
   On Thursday, 52-year-old Stanislovas Jamaitis died of burns
suffered when he doused his clothes with gasoline and set himself
ablaze in front of the Bolshoi Theater in central Moscow to protest
the Kremlin pressure.
   Jamaitis left suicide notes to his wife, Stasala, and to
Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis. The Supreme Council
released the texts on Friday, said spokeswoman Rita Radzavicius.
   She translated them from Lithuanian to Russian and read them by
telephone.
   Tass also reported the existence of the note to Jamaitis' wife,
saying it ``spoke of an impossible family life and a desire to
commit suicide.''
   The version released by Lithuanian authorities apologized for
``something bad'' in his marriage, but stressed political motives.
   ``I went to Moscow to set myself on fire,'' he said in both
notes.
   ``The occupiers have cut off energy supplies and people are
being thrown out of work,'' Jamaitis wrote.
   He would kill himself to ``let Gorbachev know that Lithuanians
will not live in a Lithuania that is not independent,'' said the
note read by the spokeswoman.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of abortion opponents gathered in
Washington today trying to impress the nation with their strength
at a ``Rally for Life'' on the grassy mall by the Washington
Monument.
   President Bush was addressing the group by a remote telephone
hookup. Vice President Dan Quayle was appearing in person along
with Catholic cardinals, country and gospel singers, and
anti-abortion leaders.
   Sponsors declined to predict the size of the crowd but hoped to
rival the police estimate of 300,000 people who attended a rally by
supporters of abortion rights a year ago.
   The first the more than 2,000 bus loads of people that sponsors
expected began arriving Friday evening. Rally-goers walked
Washington streets and crowded the city's Metro subway system as
they began assembling this morning.
   A small group of counter-protesters carried ``Keep Abortion
Legal'' signs, drawing honks from sympathetic drivers passing by
and exchanging waves with abortion opponents.
   Catholic Cardinal James Hickey conducted a Mass for the abortion
protesters on the eve of the rally, and New York Cardinal John
O'Connor, head of the church's pro-life committee, planned a Mass
at the conclusion.
   The event was aimed at trying to reverse the impression that
anti-abortion forces have been in political decline. It comes at a
time when their side has sustained a series of losses in elections
and in state capitals.
   ``At least part of the motive is to try to reverse what we feel
is a misperception about the strength of the Right to Life movement
_ and also, to give some politicians who might be wavering a little
bit of backbone,'' said Gary L. Bauer, president of the Family
Research Council and a White House aide in the Reagan
administration.
   ``We hope to impress the Congress. We hope to impress the
nation,'' said Dr. J.C. Willke, president of the National Right to
Life Committee, the lobbying group sponsoring the rally.
   Since the Supreme Court's so-called Webster decision last
summer, in which states were given more leeway to restrict
abortions, candidates who support legal abortions have won
elections for governor of Virginia and New Jersey and lieutenant
governor of Virginia. And, they have succeeded in blocking abortion
restrictions in many state legislatures.
   In addition, a number of candidates for office this year have
switched positions to support abortion rights. And despite a
strongly anti-abortion plank in the Republican Party's platform,
party officials have made clear they do not want the issue to be a
litmus test for the party's candidates or supporters.
   ``They have a public perception problem,'' Eddie Mahe, a
political consultant to Republican candidates on both sides of the
issue, said of the anti-abortion forces. ``There is clearly the
perception the movement is on the pro-choice side.''
   Abortion opponents acknowledge they have been frustrated by the
other side's success in framing public debate on the issue as a
question of a woman's right to make her own reproductive decisions.
   ``Our first goal is to keep up front in the public eye the
unborn child,'' said Father John Gouldrick, executive director of
the National Conference of Bishops' Secretariat for Pro-Life
Activities. ``That seems to have been lost in the debate since
Webster.''
   The Rally for Life is being billed as a celebration rather than
a protest or march. Among those scheduled to appear were Christian
singer Sandi Patti; and country singer Terri Gibbs.
   Nancy Myers, spokeswoman for the Right to Life group, said more
than 2,000 buses were arriving for the rally from as far away as
California, including 425 from Pennsylvania.
   Kate Michelman, head of the National Abortion Rights Action
League, called the event ``an attempt by the anti-choice minority
to recoup some of their strength, because they've been losing.''
She criticized Bush and Quayle for supporting the rally.
   ``As long as this small, vocal minority of Americans has the
support of the two most powerful politicians in America, the threat
to choice is very real and a fundamental freedom hangs by a
thread,'' Michelman said.

<TEXT>
   A helicopter removing a satellite dish
from the top of the IBM Corp. building crashed onto the roof and
burst into flames this morning, killing the pilot, authorities said.
   Four people assisting with the work escaped without injury when
they ran to the far end of the roof as the helicopter crashed
shortly after 8:30 a.m., said Southfield fire Lt. James Bunker.
   The pilot, whose name was not immediately released, was the only
person aboard the helicopter, police Lt. Floyd Raths said. The fire
atop the 14-story building located 12 miles northwest of downtown
Detroit was extinguished within 20 minutes and did not spread to
the building itself, he said.
   ``They were lifting off a satellite dish from the top of the
building,'' Raths said. ``Evidently, it lost power in the process
of the lift and crashed down to the top of the building and
exploded.''
   The helicopter was owned by Command Helicopters Inc. of Joliet,
Ill., and had been hired by MCI Corp., a long-distance telephone
company, Bunker said. Calls to Command Helicopters were not
returned late this morning. A man who answered the phone at MCI
offices in Detroit said he wasn't familiar with the accident and
would not comment.
   Ernie Desmarais, who watched the accident from a nearby
restaurant, said the engine noise became louder as the helicopter
apparently strained under the weight of the dish suspended from a
cable.
   The helicopter tilted on one side and its blades struck the roof
before the craft fell, Desmarais said. He said he heard a small
explosion, followed by a much larger one.
   ``All of a sudden the whole building shook,'' said Chuck Siemen,
an IBM employee working on the building's fourth floor.
   The Federal Aviation Administration sent investigators to the
scene.

   Police raided two homes and found nearly
100 antiquities dating from the Stone Age to the Byzantine period,
police said Saturday.
   The treasures discovered Friday include jewelery, weapons,
coins, glassware, earthenware statuettes and parts of urns, the
official said on condition of anonymity.
   Police would not say what prompted the raid in Krania, 12 miles
northwest of this central Greek town.
   ``This is certainly the greatest haul in the area and possibly
in the whole of Greece, considering the uniqueness of two or three
of the finds and the rarity of the rest. There was a spearhead from
4000 B.C., which an archaeologist here says is unique,'' he said by
telephone.
   The finds were hidden in the homes of a 26-year-old laborer and
a 32-year-old miner, who were detained, the official said.
   According to the official, the objects date from the Stone Age
to the fall of the Byzantine empire in 1453.

   A 15-year-old girl killed a man who she
said had chained her to a tree and raped her repeatedly for three
weeks, and police used the man's hand-drawn map to search for the
remains of two other missing girls.
   The girl told police she was abducted by Phillip E. Clopton, 39,
of Louisville and that she got free and killed him Thursday with
his own shotgun while he slept.
   Federal and state police began a search in three central
Kentucky counties after a map and a journal found Friday at
Clopton's backwoods campsite in La Rue County indicated two girls
had been killed and dismembered. Divers also scoured the Rolling
Fork River, but nothing was found, police said.
   LaRue County Sheriff Merle Edlin said the map was ``not too
detailed,'' but all of the burial plots except one ``were close to
or in water.''
   Although Edlin said earlier that officials would resume the
search today if rain held off, a state police dispatcher in
Elizabethtown said late this morning that officials decided not to
continue the search at this point and would pursue other aspects of
the case.
   ``They are going to follow up some leads they've got,'' said the
dispatcher, Charles Mattingly. He said some people would be
interviewed but he had no other details.
   Kentucky state Police Lt. Wayne Edwards said the girl killed
Clopton, rather than running away, because she feared he would wake
up and track her down.
   ``She's 15 years old and she was petrified,'' he said.
   The girl had several bruises but did not appear to be
malnourished, Edwards said. She was treated at Hardin Memorial
Hospital in Elizabethtown and released to her father.
   Another man, 41-year-old James R. Cable, was arrested in the
case Thursday night in Louisville and charged with first-degree
rape and sodomy. Cable was being held in the LaRue County jail
under $250,000 bond on each count.
   Edlin said Cable was not suspected in the killings but may have
distributed the body parts. His relationship with Clopton, who had
been previously imprisoned for sodomy and rape, was not immediately
clear.
   The FBI and police had been searching for Clopton in the
disappearance of all three girls, who authorities and family
friends said were acquainted.
   Officials had identified the missing girls as Bridgett Allen and
Sherry Wilson, two 14-year-olds from Louisville who left home in
January, Edlin said.
   Kentucky State Police Detective Robert Foster said the
15-year-old girl initially left Louisville willingly with Clopton
``but there obviously came time when she wanted to get away.''
   The girl's 18-year-old sister, however, told The Courier-Journal
of Louisville that her sister was kidnapped. ``She didn't run away.
Everybody thought she ran away, but she didn't,'' the sister was
quoted as saying.
   The girl said she took a shotgun while the man slept in a tent
and killed him with a single shot to the head. She said she walked
several miles from the campsite, half a mile deep in the woods off
a gravel road about 15 miles east of Hodgenville, and called the
State Police from a store.
   A police report did not reveal how she freed herself, Edlin said.
   State police said they found a map and a spiral-bound notebook
in which Clopton described killing at least two people,
dismembering them and scattering their parts in rural areas of
LaRue, Hardin and Nelson counties.
   The map, roughly sketched in pen on a piece of notebook paper,
included the missing girls' names and the spots in which various
body parts supposedly were buried, Edlin said.
   Bridgett Allen's mother, Cathy, told the Lexington Herald-Leader
that she went to Clopton in late February or early March looking
for her daughter, but he wouldn't tell her anything.
   Ms. Allen said police had told her that Clopton's diary said the
bodies of the two girls were in his Louisville apartment at the
time.
   At the campsite, police found two footlockers full of canned
goods and other supplies and a makeshift toilet. A nearby creek
served as a cooler. There were also cooking supplies, sleeping
bags, clothing and survival books.
   Neighbors said the campsite was on land once owned by Clopton's
grandparents.

   Mongolian opposition groups on Saturday protested
for a second straight day in their capital of Ulan Bator despite a
stern warning from the Communist government that they were breaking
the law.
   About 4,000 people, mostly young, gathered for two hours across
the street from the government palace, according to sources in the
Mongolian capital interviewed by telephone.
   One of their banners demanded the resignation of President
Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat, whom it nicknamed ``Iron Mask'' Ochirbat
and depicted in a tank with missiles flying from his face.
   The reference was to a speech Tuesday in which Ochirbat rejected
opposition demands for the Communist-dominated legislature to
resign and said: ``The state is empowered to and will show an iron
mask in the face of opposition activity.''
   Mongolian television warned Friday night that illegal
demonstrators faced 30 days in jail and fines of about $90 _ more
than the average monthly wage. Ochirbat issued a regulation this
month requiring advance permission for all demonstrations.
   The official newspaper, Unen, published a government statement
Saturday accusing the protesters of trying to usurp power and
jeopardize the state. The statement was reported by China's
official Xinhua News Agency.
   The hard-line response to the latest series of protests seems to
indicate the government is losing patience after five months of
pro-democracy demonstrations that have won major concessions.
   The ruling Mongolian Communists gave up their constitutional
right to power last month and agreed to the first multiparty
elections in the country's history.
   But the opposition groups, made up largely of young, urban
professionals, have accused the Communists of writing the election
law to guarantee their own victory.
   When they tried to form a picket line Friday around the
government palace to demand the legislature's resignation, soldiers
and police got there first and formed a protective cordon around
the building.
   The security forces were unarmed, and the protesters left
peacefully after several hours. It was the first such confrontation
between protesters and security forces since the democracy movement
began in December, inspired by political reforms elsewhere in the
Soviet bloc.
   The sources said speeches at Saturday's protest criticized the
government's use of troops. Only a few uniformed police stood by
Saturday, and by evening security forces removed some of the
barriers they had erected around the government palace.
   In a brief speech over television and radio Friday night, one of
the key opposition leaders, Zorig, said they would continue
struggling for change through peaceful means.
   Government and Communist Party officials have pledged repeatedly
not to use force. They apparently believe that some reforms are
inevitable and that they can best stay in power by leading reforms
rather than resisting.
   Xinhua has rarely reported on Mongolia's demonstrations, but has
carried reports whenever the government there issues warnings that
coincide with Chinese leaders' view that popular demonstrations are
dangerous. It reported Ochirbat's decree restricting
demonstrations, for example.

   India on Saturday warned Pakistan it
would not tolerate infringement of its sovereignty in the border
state of Kashmir, and a government spokesman refused to rule out
raids on guerrilla camps in Pakistan.
   ``There will be no compromise on the measures necessary to
protect our integrity,'' the government said in a prepared
statement read by Foreign Ministry spokesman Aftab Seth.
   Asked whether India was prepared to send its troops across the
frontier to eliminate guerrilla training camps in
Pakistani-controlled territory, Seth said: ``We rule nothing out.''
   He said Indian-Pakistani relations would not improve until
``there is credible evidence on the ground that Pakistan is
desisting from its abetment of terror and violence.''
   An escalation of violence by Moslem militants in Kashmir and the
ensuing crackdown by Indian government troops have brought India
and Pakistan to one of their worst crises since their 1971 war, the
third one between the two countries since they became independent
from Britain in 1947.
   Both countries have reinforced their troops along the border and
the contested Kashmir frontier. Each side has said it does not want
war but has accused the other of fomenting a climate that could
lead to one.
   The latest Indian statement was issued in response to remarks by
Pakistan's foreign minister, Sahabzada Yaqub-Khan, at a news
conference Thursday at U.N. headquarters in New York. Yaqub-Khan
called the Kashmir situation ``extremely grim'' and said ``it would
be accurate to say that within the last two weeks a war psychosis
has been created.''
   Saturday's Indian statement said Yaqub-Khan ``omitted to
mention, perhaps deliberately, that this situation was the direct
and inevitable outcome of Pakistan's attempts to train, arm, aid
and abet terrorism directed against India.''
   Pakistan has repeatedly denied it trains or harbors Kashmiri
militants who want to secede from India.
   The Indian statement also accused Pakistan governments, ``both
central and provincial,'' of trying to raise funds to support the
separatist movement.
   ``The internal situation in Kashmir is the creation of
Pakistan-supported and -assisted terrorists. These gun-toting
religious fundamentalists have indulged in arson, kidnappings,
terrorizing the civilian population, killings of innocent citizens,
murder of officials discharging their duties,'' the statement said.
   At least 308 people have been killed in Kashmir since Jan. 20,
when Indian troops launched a crackdown on the separatists. Most of
those slain were Moslem militants or supporters shot by Indian
troops during anti-India demonstrations or while defying curfews.
   Kashmir was a princely state when Indian and Pakistan were
partitioned along religious lines into separate nations. Pakistan
moved into the northern third of Kashmir, while the rest came under
Indian control as part of the state of Jammu-Kashmir.
   Today Jammu-Kashmir is the only Moslem-majority state in
predominantly Hindu India. Sixty-four percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 6
million people are Moslems, but nationwide only 12 percent of the
880 million Indians are Moslems.

   Christian shrines and churches reopened today
after a 24- hour closure to protest a Jewish settlement in the Old
City of Jerusalem.
   Leaders of nine major Christian sects closed their churches on
Friday after the Greek Orthodox Church locked the gates to the
church of the Holy Sepulcher, where Catholics say Jesus was
crucified and buried. It was believed to be the first time the
church of the Holy Spulcher closed its doors in 800 years.
   The Greek Orthodox Church owns the 72-room St. John's Hospice
that 150 Jewish settlers moved into on April 11 during Easter
celebrations. The church claims that the four-building complex was
illegally leased to the settlers.
   The government admitted last week that it had contributed $1.8
million to the establishment of the settlement, provoking outrage
in Israel and abroad.
   Israel's Supreme Court ordered the settlers out by Tuesday but
will allow 20 guards and maintenance staff to remain in the
building pending a final ruling on the tenancy dispute.
   Church leaders plan more protests if the settlers are not
evicted.
   ``If the situation continues to be critical, we will have to
close churches again, hold more special prayers and appeal to the
international community to pressure Israel to evict the settlers,''
Lufti Laham, the Melchite Catholic bishop, said.
   George Hintilian, secretary to the Armenian patriarch Torkum
Manoogian, said the Christian community is determined to have its
rights recognized.
   ``The closure of churches and houses of worship in Jerusalem,
Bethlehem, Nazereth and the Galilee was never done, not even in the
darkest conditions. This shows how serious we are,'' Hintilian said.
   The Old City, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War, is
the site of Jewish, Moslem and Christian holy places.

<HEAD>Criticism of Japan Seen as Growing Political Issue</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Richard Gephardt thinks maybe he was a little
ahead of the curve on Japan.
   During the 1988 presidential campaign, people accused him of
bashing Japan on its trade policies. They called him protectionist.
   Today, however, he says a lot more people are in his camp,
particularly Democrats who sense a good issue for 1992.
   ``There is a greater understanding on the part of a lot of
people, especially about our problems with Japan and a few of the
other countries where there are really significant trade access
problems,'' the Missouri Democratic congressman said.
   While President Bush is receiving near-record high job
performance ratings in opinion polls, some analysts believe U.S.
trade problems with Japan could emerge as an issue against the
Republican president in 1992.
   ``It's the biggest long-term danger to the Bush
administration,'' said Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg.
   When Bush announced Friday that he was removing Japan from the
``hit list'' of countries judged by the administration to have the
most offensive trade barriers against U.S. products, members of
Congress were quick to protest.
   ``It is clear that Japan should be on the list,'' said Sen. Don
Riegle, D-Mich. ``Our government is not using the tools that are
available to correct this continuing hemorrhage of U.S. capital and
jobs.''
   ``Trade access problems.'' That's the polite term used by people
upset by the $49 billion deficit in the U.S. trade balance with
Japan. Some Americans feeling the heat of competition with Japan
are apt to be less polite.
   For example, try the radio ad run by a suburban Washington auto
dealer.
   In an accent distinctly Japanese, a man is heard admiring an
American car at a fictitious Tokyo auto show.
   An incredulous American voice asks: ``Haven't you ever seen a
Safford Lincoln Continental before?''
   ``Only in magazines,'' is the reply. ``Japanese have too many
import restrictions and taxes to see one in person.''
   ``I wouldn't phrase it as Japan bashing, obviously,'' said Sen.
John Breaux of Louisiana, chairman of the Senate Democratic
Campaign Committee. ``But I think it is a very legitimate issue.
People in the hinterlands and middle America are feeling we are
giving away our technology.''
   ``There is a frustration Americans feel over not controlling
their own destiny,'' said Michael McCurry, communications director
of the Democratic National Committee.
   But McCurry and other politicians questioned the long-term value
of Japan bashing.
   ``Bashing Japan gets you the audience,'' said the DNC official.
``But you have to make a pretty sophisticated argument about what
you would do.''
   Ohio is one of the states where people feel hardest hit by
competition from Japan. Jim Ruvolo, the state's Democratic Party
chairman, recalled that during the 1988 presidential campaign, the
Ohio party produced and ran a television spot that directly
attacked Japanese trade practices.
   When that ad ran, Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis gained six points in the state.
   Frank Greer, a Democratic political consultant, said that among
many Americans there is ``anxiety we are slipping behind.'' But he
said people are as likely to blame American management practices as
they are to point to Japanese trade policies.
   ``The Japan bashing, I don't think you can tell yet,'' said Bob
Teeter, a Republican pollster and adviser to Bush. ``I think it's
one of those things that has the potential on the surface to work
for you and under the surface to backfire.''
   ``I don't think out-and-out bashing works anymore,'' said
Greenberg, who has examined public attitudes toward Japan. ``You
can run on putting our own house in order, putting America first,
about watching out for our interests and not being taken advantage
of and with Japan as the primary example of a country that is
taking advantage of our good will.''
   He said Japan could become an issue against Bush if there were
an economic downturn.
   ``I think the Bush administration (seen as) standing by while
the Japanese became more and more dominant would become a major
political problem,'' said Greenberg.
   Attitudes toward Japan differ.
   In the Midwest, where the automobile industry has been hit hard,
politicians can attack Japanese trade practices with impunity.
   In California, feelings are more complex.
   ``I think there's a great concern about becoming too
jingoistic,'' said former California Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., now
the state's Democratic Party chairman.
   ``It may look good in a primary or a given state race. But when
you look at how imbedded we are in a world economy it's going to be
very difficult for somebody to get very far by bashing key elements
of our own stability.''

   Eight Soviet writers on a U.S.
government-funded tour, which has provoked controversy because of
some members' reputedly anti-Semitic works, were to arrive Sunday
at the University of Mississippi.
   In Montana, the writers' visit was canceled after one host,
Little Big Horn College on the Crow Indian Reservation, refused to
receive them.
   The American Jewish Committee has complained that the tour gives
known anti-Semites legitimacy and prestige.
   ``We're happy to receive them,'' said Martha Boynton,
International Projects director at Ole Miss. She said she knew
nothing of the writers' work when she agreed to the visit.
   ``It's never been our policy to question any of the thought or
ideology of our foreign visitors,'' Boynton said.
   Little Big Horn College President Janine Pease-Windy Boy also
said she hadn't known of the reputed anti-Semitism when the visit
was scheduled. She said the college and the community felt that
Native Americans, as minorities themselves, could not appear to
condone bigotry against others.
   The Montana Council for International Visitors on Monday
canceled the group's two appearances in the state, scheduled for
May 6-9, saying the controversy had destroyed the chance for
meaningful dialogue.
   The U.S. Information Agency, the tour's sponsor, defends it as a
means of exposing the Soviet writers to democracy in action.
   USIA spokesman Frank S. Johnson Jr. has said, ``I don't know
that they are anti-Semitic; I don't know that they are not, either.
... We feel very strongly that pluralism in this country is worth
talking about and observing.''
   During their four-day Mississippi visit, the Soviets will
``learn about the South, specifically Southern literature and
William Faulkner,'' Boynton said. ``We'll not get into any
discussion further afield than that.''
   The tour also includes stops in Washington; Pittsburgh; Iowa
City, Iowa; Urbana and Kansas, Ill.; San Francisco; and New York
City.

   A census counter was attacked and bitten on
the shoulder by a woman who apparently mistook her for a
fund-raiser, authorities said.
   Sandra Reed, 32, of Alton was charged with two counts of battery
after the incident Wednesday and could also face federal charges,
officials said.
   Census worker Debra Price said she sought medical attention
immediately after the attack. Because her skin was broken when she
was bitten, she was tested for AIDS.
   ``I didn't even get to ask her any questions and I identified
myself as a U.S. Census bureau person,'' said Price, 31, of Godfrey.
   ``She thought I was a solicitor, and she told me to get out of
her face. I couldn't (because) she grabbed hold of me by the
neck,'' Price said. ``She wouldn't let go.''
   Price said a neighbor, Cynthia Hargis, tried to help her but was
also attacked.
   ``It's really bizarre. To be attacked and bitten is unusual,''
said Ron McCoy, regional Census Bureau spokesman. ``Usually the
biggest problem we have is people not being home.''
   Price was one of 300 census workers working in the area of
Southern Illinois east of St. Louis, counting people who had not
sent in census forms.
   Reed is being investigated and may be charged with attacking a
federal government employee, the FBI said. The charge carries a
fine of up to $250,000 and a sentence of up to three years in
prison, said assistant U.S. attorney Don Coleman.
   She was released on her own recognizance.

   Senators are giving up efforts to reach a
bipartisan compromise on campaign finance reform and instead
putting the finishing touches this week on rival Republican and
Democratic bills.
   Although lawmakers are still uncertain of precisely what they
are being asked to support, Majority Leader George Mitchell wants
to bring the issue to the Senate floor by the end of the week.
   The debate should send off sparks and occupy the Senate for
quite a while as the parties jockey for position.
   Democrats already are trying to pin the obstructionist label on
Republicans while GOP lawmakers are countering with a bill of their
own, to be unveiled early this week.
   Mitchell, a Maine Democrat, and Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., each met with their followers last week to explain the
workings of the bills. But lawmakers were still ``flyspecking'' the
proposals for clues as to how they might affect their political
futures.
   ``Everybody wants campaign finance reform but they don't quite
agree on what that is,'' Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., said as he
emerged from a caucus.
   Dole and Mitchell named a task force of academic and
professional campaign experts in January to come up with bipartisan
recommendations.
   Last month, the panel proposed changes that called for painful
sacrifices from both parties. The two leaders cautiously embraced
the chief recommendation _ so-called flexible ceilings on campaign
spending. But their followers balked at the notion.
   ``Unfortunately, the parties don't have much common ground,''
said Senate Democratic Whip Alan Cranston of California. ``I think
we'll pass a bill. How strong it will be remains to be seen.''
   By a 2-to1 margin, Republicans last week rejected the flexible
ceilings, which would abolish specific limits on how much
candidates could raise from outside their states. They called for
an end to political action committees (PACs) _ which provide funds
to candidates, often on behalf of lobbies.
   Dole acknowledged that abolishing PACs would most likely be held
an unconstituional infringment on the freedom of speech. But
Republicans have prepared a fallback position calling for the
abolition of only corporate and union-affiliated PACs, as President
Bush advocated last year.
   Democrats embraced flexible ceilings but said they should not be
as flexible as the experts recommended. Specifically, they opposed
the idea of no limit on small, home-state contributions.
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., a drafter of the Republican
counterproposal,
   said 85 percent of Republicans oppose any limit.
   ``An even larger number of Democratic senators feel that there
has to be a limit, that it isn't reform without some type of
limit,'' said Mitchell. ``That's going to be the most difficult
area.''
   The Democratic bill would establish ceilings for Senate
campaigns ranging from $1.5 million for the smallest states such as
Alaska, Idaho, New Hampshire and West Virginia up to $8.25 million
for the largest state, California. It also would limit PAC
contributions to 20 percent of the total.
   Democratic leaders earlier had abandoned hopes of winning
public, taxpayer financing of congressional campaigns.
   However, a proposal by Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., to provide
candidates 20 percent of their spending ceiling through government
vouchers for buying TV time has been gaining momentum. One idea on
how to pay for it is raising the current voluntary $1 checkoff on
income tax returns for presidential campaigns.
   Meanwhile, House leaders have put off any action on campaign
finance reform until after they see how the Senate handles it.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said last week he wants
to bring the issue to the floor in June despite a similar lack of
progress toward a compromise there between the two parties.
   ``There are some things we can agree on, but I think it is fair
to say that, overall, there will be more significant elements in
which we will be in disagreement,'' he said.
   House Republican leader Robert Michel of Illinois said he
envisons the two parties ``going at the issue hammer and tong.''

<TEXT>
   Saying ``British justice stinks,'' an
Irishwoman flew home to freedom Saturday, her conviction for
terrorist conspiracy quashed in a sensational British court ruling.
   Martina Shanahan, who arrived in Dublin on her 25th birthday,
was released with fellow prisoners John McCann and Finbar Cullen,
who flew to Ireland separately. Each had served 2{ years of a
25-year sentence.
   A British appeals court ruled Friday that the 1988 trial of the
so-called ``Winchester Three'' could have been prejudiced by a
British Cabinet minister's remarks.
   The three were jailed for allegedly conspiring to murder Tom
King, then the government's secretary of state for Northern Ireland.
   During their trial in the western England city of Winchester,
the government changed the law to allow juries to draw negative
inferences from a suspect's silence under police questioning.
   King, now defense secretary, was prominent in defending the
change. He said on television that defendants should not have the
right to remain silent.
   The appeal court agreed King's remarks could have prejudiced the
trial, and ordered the three freed. The government immediately
ordered them deported.
   The case of the Winchester Three was the latest in a series of
embarrassments for Britain over the justice it metes out to Irish
suspects.
   In October, ``the Guildford Four'' were released, having served
14 years of a life sentence for bombings that killed five people.
An appeals judge ruled that police lied about some of the evidence.
   Then there are ``the Birmingham Six,'' jailed for life in 1975
for bombings that killed 19 people. Their supporters insist they
are victims of a miscarriage of justice, and the government has
agreed to have certain aspects of the case reviewed.
   For the Irish, the case of the Winchester Three struck
particularly close to home.
   Unlike the Guildford and Birmingham convicts, most of whom come
from Northern Ireland where the Irish Republican Army wages its war
against Britain, the Winchester Three come from the Irish Republic.
   None seemed to fit the stereotype of the hardened fighter for
the IRA, which wants to unite Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland
with the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland.
   Cullen, 29, is from a prominent middle class family. McCann, 26,
is the son of an oil company executive.
   Even as they returned to rapturous welcome from family and
friends, question marks remained.
   They were arrested in 1987 after Cullen and Ms. Shanahan were
spotted near the King family home in County Wiltshire, western
England. McCann was arrested at a nearby campground.
   Police said papers were found containing the names of 19 British
national figures, some with their car license numbers.
   Police said the group's possessions included a woollen mask,
binoculars, forged driver's licenses, $7,200, a radio and a
magazine article on how to become an expert sniper.
   The defense argued in court that the possessions did not connect
them with an assassination plot, but no explanation of their
activities was forthcoming.
   The appeal court rejected the plea of insufficient evidence, and
The Irish Times, Dublin's leading newspaper, editorialized that no
one could deny ``something murky was afoot'' when the three were
arrested.
   Said Ms. Shanahan at Dublin Airport: ``British justice stinks.
There is no such thing as British justice. The Birmingham Six
should be home as well.''
   But most newspapers and politicians in Dublin praised the
British court for acknowledging a mistake.
   ``What is important about this appeal judgment in the broader
context of Anglo-Irish relations,'' the Irish Independent said,
``is that it will have gone a long way toward reassuring Irish
people about the administration of justice in cases involving Irish
accused.''

<HEAD>Panels Challenge VA Authority To Award Back Payments to Vets With
Cancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two congressional committees are challenging a
Veterans Affairs Department decision to award back payment of
previously denied claims to Vietnam vets suffering from a rare form
of cancer linked to Agent Orange.
   The Democratic and Republican leaders of the House and Senate
veterans committees wrote a letter to the VA earlier this month
challenging the authority of the department to award retroactive
benefits.
   But the legal issue is caught up in the emotional and complex
issue of compensating veterans who claim they have a variety of
ailments due to exposure to the defoliant Agent Orange.
   The letter, which was first disclosed in Saturday's editions of
The Washington Post, said benefits may be awarded only
``prospectively'' _ from the date of the new regulation _ and not
retroactively.
   It said the VA's decision to set a retroactive effective date
for awarding benefits was unprecedented.
   ``We question whether you have such authority under current law
with respect to a claim after its denial has become final,'' the
April 18 letter to VA Secretary Edward J. Derwinski said.
   The issue arose March 29, when the VA announced it would award
benefits to anyone who served in Vietnam and later developed
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The announcement came the same day the
federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said Vietnam vets
had a 50 percent higher risk of developing the disease than did men
who hadn't served.
   But the VA, in its attempt to defuse the lingering Agent Orange
issue, used its file of past Agent Orange claims to come up with
the number of lymphoma victims who should be compensated.
   The government consistently denies a connection between exposure
to the defoliant and a host of ailments, despite claims of veterans
groups, a class-action lawsuit that was settled, and a number of
independent scientists.
   Derwinski asserted that the benefits were for not for Agent
Orange exposure but for anyone who served in Vietnam who has the
cancer. VA was thus able to give some relief without conceding an
association between exposure and disease.
   The same CDC study ruled out an increase in several other
cancers among Vietnam veterans that have been linked to Agent
Orange exposure. The CDC has acknowledged that the study does not
disprove a connection.
   The VA estimated it would have to pay up to $25 million a year
in death and disability benefits to the 1,800 afflicted veterans or
their survivors. It is drafting new regulations to award the claims.
   Should the VA reverse its March 29 decision, those who were
previously denied claims could refile for benefits. The benefits
would become payable from the date of the new regulations or the
date of the CDC study, said Charles Peckarsky, an adviser to the
House committee.
   The letter, which originated in the House VA Committee, is
signed by Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, the Mississippi Democrat
who chairs the committee; Rep. Bob Stump, R-Ariz., the ranking
minority member; Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., chairman of the
Senate VA Committee; and Sen. Frank H. Murkowski, R-Alaska, the
ranking Republican member.
   VA spokesman Dennis R. Boxx defended Derwinski's action, saying,
``He believes that the decision was a legal decision, but just as
importantly, a fair and humane decision that was appropriate given
all the complex questions and issues.''
   He said the development is ironic because the VA ``is often
accused of not trying to do things that are humane and fair and
compassionate.''
   The committee leaders' views are not necessarily shared by all
the members.
   ``I don't think it behooves veterans advocates to be working
against veterans benefits,'' said Rep. Lane Evans, D-Ill., a member
of the committee and a leader of the Vietnam-era veterans caucus in
Congress.

   A bomb found at a bus station exploded
Saturday night, killing a policeman who had been sent to
investigate it, a police spokesman said.
   Nine other people were wounded, the spokesman said, speaking on
condition of anonymity in keeping with police regulations.
   Police received a report that a device believed to be a bomb had
been found at a bus station on the south side of the capital. It
exploded as the constable inspected it, the spokesman said.
   He said there was no indication who left the bomb or what the
target was. Only local city buses used the station, the spokesman
said.

correspondent-columnist Bill Lambrecht won the 46th annual Raymond
Clapper Memorial Award and Knight-Ridder Newspapers correspondent
Christopher Scanlan was named winner of the Barnet Nover Memorial
Award, it was announced Saturday.
   The awards, which recognize excellence in reporting, were made
by the Raymond Clapper Foundation and the Barnet Nover Foundation.
Each award also carried a $1,500 cash prize. Second place carried a
$500 prize.
   The awards were to be presented at the annual White House
Correspondents Association dinner Saturday night.
   Lambrecht was cited for his series on the export of U.S.
garbage. Scanlan was named for his series of articles on the effect
of the budget crisis on government health care for veterans.
   John Hall of Media General was named the second-place Clapper
winner for his series on the Navy's investigation of the explosion
on the battleship Iowa.
   Andrew Melnykovych of the Casper Star-Tribune was named the
second-place Nover winner for his series on federal oil and gas
royalty audits and the nomination of James Cason to be assistant
secretary of agriculture.
   The Clapper winners were selected from among 33 entries
submitted to a panel of current and former Washington reporters.
Raymond Clapper, a Washington correspondent and columnist for
Scripps Howard Newspapers, was killed in an airplane crash while
covering the invasion of the Marshall Islands in World War II.
   The Clapper award was established in 1944 to recognize a
Washington-based newspaper writer whose work ``most clearly
approximated the ideals of fair and painstaking reporting and good
craftsmanship that were characteristic of Raymond Clapper.''
   The Nover winners were selected from 24 entries submitted to a
panel of five Washington journalists. Barnet Nover was bureau chief
of the Denver Post's Washington bureau from 1947 to 1971. He also
was a columnist for The Washington Post and a reporter with the
Buffalo Evening News.

   Jimmy Carter says he's gratified by his
popularity and the respect he's getting for his global mediation
efforts, but he says he's ``not foolish enough'' to think about
winning the presidency again.
   He also has no aspirations to be the world's most prominent
election observer.
   Carter played a prominent role in certifying that Nicaragua's
recent presidential election was fair. He was invited to oversee
elections in Hungary and Romania. And he has agreed to help monitor
elections in the Dominican Republic next month.
   But, he said: ``It's not a niche I want to fulfill permanently.
If I see that my presence can be the deciding factor in the
integrity of an election, I would do it, but I don't need to go
just to say, `We've got a former U.S. president here.' I'm not
looking for ceremonial roles.''
   In an interview last week in his Carter Presidential Center
office, the 65-year-old former president warned of tougher times
ahead for Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, said it's a mistake
to assume that communism is crumbling universally, and explained
how _ and why _ he was willing to go to Beirut, Lebanon.
   Carter attributed the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe
mainly to Gorbachev.
   ``It's a change that Gorbachev has brought,'' Carter said. ``It
would be a mistake to think it's a worldwide inevitability.
   ``We don't see it happening in North Korea. We don't see it
happening in Vietnam. We don't see it happening in Albania. We
don't see it happening in China, and we haven't seen it happen in
Cuba.''
   Gorbachev's biggest threat _ ``much worse than ethnic
independence moves or anything else'' _ is his country's economic
ruin, Carter said, adding:
   ``When I meet privately with Soviet leaders, they make it clear
to me that the West has underestimated the economic deterioration
in the Soviet Union.
   ``How Gorbachev will deal with it, I don't know. The fact is,
he's been in office now for about five years, and the situation's
gotten worse.''
   In the Middle East, Carter sees ``a general consensus ... now,
that the time for hostage-taking has passed and that these hostages
ought to be released.''
   He complimented President Bush for ``opening up new avenues of
at least discussion and exploration on how the hostages might be
released.''
   In the wake of last week's release of hostage Robert Polhill,
Carter said, the administration should not be ``too effusive in
your thanks, when only one hostage is released. But you can
acknowledge the fact that this is leading toward reconciliation.''
   After spending 10 days in the Middle East last month, Carter was
criticized for charging Israel with violations of Palestinian
rights.
   ``I know that when any statement is made that is critical of
Israel ... it's going to be condemned,'' he said. ``I understand
their concerns.''
   He reiterated that he had simply condemned one Israeli policy _
``deporting mothers and children from their own homes in the West
Bank and Gaza to Jordan, which I thought was a terrible crime.''
   Following his criticism, the policy was changed.
   ``I don't have any apology to make. I am concerned about any
genuine belief that I am biased, but a lot of the accusations about
bias are deliberately designed to prevent further criticism of
Israel's policies. And I don't choose to be intimidated.''
   During his trip, Carter sought to meet with Lebanese President
Elias Hrawi, to understand first-hand Lebanon's position in the
volatile region.
   He considered just going to Beirut, but ``I knew the State
Department would not approve. So my thought was to meet with
President Hrawi at a military base inside Lebanon.''
   But Bush administration officials urged him to stay away from
the terrorism-racked country. ``I felt perfectly secure, but I can
understand the concerns of others about me,'' he said.
   While Carter has been seen as a success on the global stage,
former President Reagan has been criticized for taking lucrative
speaking engagements and stumbling badly in his testimony during
the Iran-Contra trial of John Poindexter.
   The result: Carter's approval rating in U.S. public opinion
polls is higher now than that of the man who defeated him so
overwhelmingly 10 years ago.
   ``You find that surprising?'' Carter joked.
   During his administration from 1977 to 1981, Carter was was
widely criticized for the state of the economy and his handling of
foreign affairs, including the Iranian hostage crisis.
   Carter conceded he finds his new popularity flattering, although
``that's not the goal of my life, to get favorable public opinion
polls.''
   ``Part of it is what we've done since we've left the White
House. Part of it is a growing historical assessment of our
administrations. And I think part of it is the quite dramatic
changes in Reagan's policies by George Bush.
   ``I think it would embarrass him, my saying this, but I think
his policies are much more comparable to those of Kennedy and
Johnson and Nixon and Ford and me than they are comparable with
Reagan's policies.''
   Still, Carter insists he never even daydreams about running
again for anything: ``Never. I'm not foolish enough to think that I
would win an election for president; that would be out of the
question. And secondly, I'm perfectly satisfied with what I'm doing
here.
   ``I can say what I like. I can meet whom I want. I can take on
the projects that please me, and reject the ones that don't.''

   Lithuania's president and a Soviet government
spokesman on Saturday praised a French-West German proposal to
defuse tensions, raising the possibility it could lead to a
compromise between Moscow and Vilnius.
   The Kremlin has shut down shipments of oil, restricted natural
gas and cut supplies of manufactured goods and food supplies to
Lithuania. On Saturday, a Soviet government official said coal
supplies had been cut as well.
   A letter from French President Francois Mitterrand and West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl proposed Lithuania suspend some laws
backing up its March 11 declaration of independence but did not
suggest repealing the declaration itself.
   ``We consider that this is not far from the line that the Soviet
leadership has been pursuing from the very beginning,'' Arkady
Maslennikov, a spokesman for Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
told a Kremlin briefing. ``We consider this a constructive signal.''
   Lithuanian leaders also are showing ``the understanding that
there must be a return to the road of reason,'' Maslennikov said.
   In the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, President Vytautas
Landsbergis told a news conference he considered the proposal a
positive step, said Lithuanian journalist Eduardas Potashinskas.
   ``Some may interpret this letter as a concession to the
categorical position of the Soviet Union,'' he quoted Landsbergis
as saying. ``We see it differently.''
   ``We will suggest that the initiative of these leaders not end
with this letter,'' he said.
   On Friday, Lithuanian Premier Kazimiera Prunskiene said the
French-West German proposal was ``the limit'' to compromise that
Lithuania could accept. The Lithuanian leadership said it will
bring the proposal before the Baltic republic's legislature this
week for debate.
   In order to begin talks on the basis of the Kohl-Mitterrand
letter, the two sides must find a formula that takes into account
their opposing views of the independence declaration.
   Lithuania has sent several delegations to Moscow in hopes of
arranging top-level meetings, but there have been few such contacts.
   Gorbachev says Lithuania must renounce the declaration.
Landsbergis and the Lithuanian leadership say they cannot back down
on the declaration but the laws implementing it and the schedule
are negotiable.
   The republic says the declaration only recognizes the legal
status Lithuania held before its forcible annexation _ along with
that of neighboring Latvia and Estonia _ by the Soviet Union in
1940.
   Western countries including the United States never recognized
the incorporation of the Baltic states but also have not recognized
Lithuania's declaration.
   The issue is a test for Gorbachev, who faces several nationalist
and ethnic crises. The parliament of Estonia has voted to become
independent at an unspecified later date, and Latvia is scheduled
to vote on the issue this week.
   Gorbachev and Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov have demanded
that Lithuania reverse its opposition to its youths being drafted
into the Soviet army, return Communist Party buildings being used
by Lithuania's independent Communists and repeal a law on
citizenship they regarded as discriminatory.
   The Soviet military has seized some buildings in Vilnius and
conducted a series of military maneuvers an effort to pressure the
republic of 3.8 million people.
   Officials say about 10,000 Lithuanians already are out of work
because of the economic blockade from Moscow, and the Soviet news
agency Tass said experts believe the figure will grow to 35,000 by
Tuesday.
   The republic's only oil refinery shut down last week, and it is
receiving only a small share of its normal allotment of natural gas.
   Supplies of gasoline to private car owners has been restricted
to about 7 gallons a month and long lines have formed at gas
stations. Many people are walking.
   Official Vilnius radio reported late Friday that publication of
newspapers in the republic would be severely restricted this week.
But it said Lithuania had enough newsprint to continue publishing
the papers.
   Soviet authorities have restricted Western reporters from
traveling to Lithuania, except by invitation on trips organized by
the Foreign Ministry. The Associated Press was not invited on one
trip currently under way.
   Vladimir Kosyunin, deputy chairman of the Soviet State Supply
Committee, told Tass that coal supplies had been curtailed as well.
Much of that coal comes from Poland, and Lithuania already owes
about 1 million rubles for coal supplies, he said.
   Kosyunin told Tass it would take only a matter of days to
restore normal shipments to Lithuania if a political settlement is
reached. ``The situation is not yet irreversible, but it will be
much more difficult to resolve the problem later.''

<HEAD>Workers Begin Removing Famous Section of Berlin Wall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers on Saturday began tearing down the
thickest and perhaps most famous part of the Berlin Wall, a stretch
of graffiti-covered concrete in front of the historic Brandenburg
Gate.
   Crowds of tourists and souvenir peddlers watched as East German
soldiers and West German construction workers with heavy tools
began knocking away at the section ofwall that curves around the
18th-century gate.
   The huge, colonnaded gate represents the grandeur of old Berlin
just as the section of wall in front of it symbolized its division.
   The wall provided some of the most memorable images of the
revolution last autumn that ended four decades of Communist
oppression, opened the wall, and began the process of reunifying
the two Germanys. With the giant gate as a backdrop, protesters
with chisels climbed on the wall last year to demonstrate their new
freedom when East Germany's borders were finally opened.
   Much of the surrounding sections of the 100-mile wall already
have been removed, but the section in front of the gate is
considered the sturdiest. It is 10 feet high and equally as thick.
   The area around the Brandenburg Gate has become a heavily
visited tourist area. Makeshift souvenir stands hawk everything
from postcards depicting the revolt to key chains made of wall
fragments.
   The work Saturday was part of an ongoing process of removing
certain sections of the wall. The East German government says the
entire wall will eventually be removed, except for one section that
will stand as a monument.
   The East German news agency ADN reported Saturday that 70
segments of the Berlin Wall will be auctioned off on June 23 in the
principality of Monaco.

   Look out, Disney. Dolly has her
sights set on a second Dollywood theme park in Japan.
   Dolly Parton, country music entertainer and part owner in the
Pigeon Forge theme park that bears her name, announced Friday the
Dollywood Co. is negotiating with Japanese developers to build a
park near Tokyo.
   Disney already has a theme park in Tokyo, which opened in 1983.
   ``It's going to be fun teaching them to say `y'all' in Japan,''
said Ted Miller, vice president of development for Dollywood.
   Dollywood is a regional park at the foot of the Great Smoky
Mountains that capitalizes on the theme of Appalachian culture. The
park, which attracts more than 1 million visitors a year, mixes
country music with working craftsmen and amusement rides.
   The proposed Japanese version, to be called Dollywood II, would
be the same, only larger, Miller said. It would be the first of
seven parks clustered together and linked by a common
transportation system.
   He stressed that further feasibility studies, planning and
construction mean that the park is several years away from
construction.
   ``I don't want anyone to panic, we are not selling Dollywood to
the Japanese,'' Ms. Parton quipped as she opened the news
conference.
   Akio Hashimoto, president of the International Industry
Development Inc. of Tokyo, the company developing the Japanese
park, told reporters Ms. Parton's popularity in Japan ``is just
incredible.''
   The singer-actress is known for such hits as ``Here You Come
Again'' and ``My Tennessee Mountain Home'' and for appearances in
movies such as ``9 to 5.''

   Conservative Christians don't get enthusiastic
about the religious rantings of media mogul Ted Turner, the man who
rewrote the Ten Commandments to suit his tastes.
   But Turner said Friday he isn't exactly crazy about
fundamentalists, either.
   In a speech before the American Humanist Association, Turner
criticized fundamentalist Christianity for emphasizing that man was
born into sin. And, he said, Jesus would probably ``be sick at his
stomach'' over the way his ideas had been ``twisted.''
   Turner said while he was growing up, religion was ``pounded into
us so much ... that I was saved seven or eight times.''
   Turner said he pondered a career as a missionary. Then his
sister died after a lengthy illness, despite his prayers.
   ``If God is love and all-powerful, why does he allow these
things to happen?'' Turner asked. The more he strayed from his
Christian upbringing, Turner said, ``the better I felt.''
   Turner said he believes ``we're all basically good'' and that
all people are ``kindred souls.''
   Turner was honored as Humanist of the Year Friday night, mainly
for his work on behalf of world peace and the environment.
   Copies of his own version of the 10 Commandments, the ``10
Voluntary Initiatives,'' were placed on each table at the banquet.
His initiatives, which he announced last year, include population
control, recycling and pacifism.

   Actress Elizabeth Taylor is out of
intensive care, much better after surviving a brush with death a
week ago, officials said.
   ``According to her physicians she is responding well to
treatment for pneumonia. She continues to improve and her condition
is listed as stable,'' said a statement issued Friday by St. John's
Hospital and Health Center.
   The actress was moved to a private room Thursday evening, it
said. The previous day, she got off a ventilator that was used
earlier in the week to help her breathe.
   Miss Taylor, 58, entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital on April
9 with a persistent fever and sinus infection. Her condition
worsened and she was transferred April 16 to St. John's.
   She had been in serious condition in the intensive care ward at
St. John's since last Sunday. Doctors said that at one point last
weekend she nearly died.
   The Oscar-winning star of ``Butterfield 8'' and ``Who's Afraid
of Virginia Woolf'' has been troubled with health problems for
years, including recurring back troubles, drug and alcohol
dependence, and a near-fatal bout of pneumonia in 1961.

   The organization that arranged a broadcast
interview with ``Satanic Verses'' author Salman Rushdie accused the
BBC on Saturday of breaking an agreement not to ask the writer
about his life in hiding.
   The BBC said it was understood from the start that Rushdie would
be asked on Radio 4's ``Today'' program about his life as well
about his support for Charter 88, which is campaigning for a
written constitution for Britain.
   Rushdie has been in hiding since February 1989, when Iranian
leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini decreed that Rushdie deserved to
be killed because his book was blasphemous.
   ``It was agreed in writing that Charter 88 would be the main
topic of a seven-minute interview,'' said the group's coordinator,
Anthony Barnett. He said Rushdie was also angry about the interview.
   Rushdie answered questions about his life in hiding and under
guard, and expressed annoyance only once, when asked a question on
his thoughts on British hostages held by pro-Iranian forces in
Lebanon.

   Emmy-winning producer-director Chet Forte
lost millions of dollars gambling and is now sickly and unemployed
as he prepares to face federal tax and fraud charges, his
court-appointed public defender says.
   ``He doesn't have a penny to his name,'' assistant federal
public defender Larry Lustberg said Friday. ``That's what this case
is all about.''
   Forte, who was perhaps best known as producer of ABC's Monday
night football, was released on personal recognizance following an
initial hearing Friday on charges he misrepresented his finances in
applying for $1.47 million in mortgage loans.
   Forte, 54, told Hedges during a 25-minute hearing that he was
unemployed, without income, being supported by his wife's family.
   ``This is a tragedy in the magnitude of Pete Rose, and not
entirely dissimilar,'' Lustberg said, referring to the former
Cincinnati Reds manager who pleaded guilty to tax charges that
stemmed from his gambling habits.
   ``There is gambling in this case, tax problems and enormous
debts,'' Lustberg said.
   Forte is accused various counts of mail fraud, transporting
stolen property across state lines and failure to file a federal
income tax return in 1987. He could face more than 70 years in
prison and millions of dollars in fines if convicted.
   Forte produced and directed ABC's coverage of the 1968 and 1984
Summer Olympics, NCAA football, Triple Crown horse races, the
Indianapolis 500, and the World Series and All-Star Games. He won
nine Emmys during 25 years with the network.
   Forte left ABC in 1987 to become an independent director and
producer.

   President Bush, an avid fisherman who has
pursued the sport in Wyoming, the Florida Keys and the Gulf of
Mexico since taking office, may have found a new lucky spot
Saturday just a few miles from the White House.
   ``What do you think?'' Bush said, grinning broadly as he held up
one of the 15 or so largemouth bass his fishing party caught during
a six-hour excursion on the Potomac River just south of Washington.
   It was Bush's first try as president at fishing on the Potomac.
   ``Not bad at all. That's better than last week,'' Bush said,
referring to the fishing trip in the Florida Keys he took following
a meeting at Key Largo with French President Francois Mitterrand.
   Bush declined to answer reporters' questions about Lithuania,
saying he would probably hold a news conference next week.
   The president sidestepped a question about whether the Potomac
fishing was better than Maine. He has fished extensively from his
powerboat in the Atlantic and in a river near his vacation home in
Kennebunkport.
   ``Depends on what you're trying to do. ... You're not going to
get me into that,'' he said.
   The Potomac runs past the Washington Mall, where Bush later
spoke by telephone hookup to more than 60,000 anti-abortion
demonstrators.
   The president's fishing party included WRC-TV news anchorman Jim
Vance and The Washington Post's outdoor sports writer Angus
Phillips. They first tried his luck in a cove on the Maryland
shore. The group fared better later at a spot on the Virginia shore
just down from Alexandria.
   Bush, who wore a khaki jacket decorated with a picture of
swimming fish, piloted the boat on the six-mile return trip. Before
throwing the fish back into the river, the president said he
thought he had reeled in three or four.
   ``I don't know ... we don't do it that way. It's a team
concept.''
   Asked if he was surprised at the large number of bottles, paper
cups and other trash floating in the Potomac, Bush said he was
``delighted'' that the once heavily polluted river has ``come back
as far as it has.''

<HEAD>Iran Arms Sale Funds Reported Diverted To US-Israeli Covert
Actions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional Iran-Contra investigators
discovered but kept secret a diversion to Israeli intelligence of
more than $1 million in proceeds from the Reagan administration's
sale of arms to Iran, The New York Times Magazine reports.
   The magazine, in an article by investigative journalist Seymour
Hersh, also reports that senators decided before the
much-publicized Iran-Contra hearings that they would not ``go
after'' President Reagan. They agreed they would avoid seeking
impeachment unless it seemed Reagan had been fully aware of the
diversion of arms sale money to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, the
article said.
   The decisions were governed by a desire to avoid jeopardizing
the release of U.S. hostages held in Lebanon and to protect the
emerging strategic-arms negotiations with the Soviet Union, as well
as Reagan's age and immense public popularity, Hersh writes.
   According to the article, Senate and House committees learned
that former Gen. Richard Secord and his partner, Albert Hakim, who
worked for White House aide Oliver North in the affair, had
diverted Iranian arms-sale profits to the Israelis for the covert
actions.
   The committees obtained documents that showed four cash
transfers between Hakim's Swiss bank account and an account
controlled by Amiram Nir, an Israeli counterterror official, Hersh
writes.
   This transfer was not mentioned in the panels' joint report in
November 1987. The report devotes only three paragraphs to the
subject and describes the efforts by code-names ``TH-1, TH-2 and so
on.'' It says North testified that the efforts ``had not progressed
beyond the planning stage'' and that he
   therefore did not seek presidential authorization.
   But Hersh says ``highly placed American intelligence
officials,'' whom he did not identify by name, told him that
several of the North-Nir operations did take place in 1985 and 1986.
   These included covert electronic monitoring of the highway
between Damascus and Beirut, a series of attempts to penetrate the
Shiite Amal militia and the Druse sect inside Lebanon, and a
continuing effort to locate Arab terrorists suspected of blowing up
the Marine barracks in Lebanon in 1983, Hersh reports.
   Hersh adds that Secord acknowledged in an interview he was aware
of the payments to Nir and said of them, ``This is black money _
Israeli black money,'' a term used to describe the financing of
covert operations.
   Senate committee chief counsel Arthur Liman is quoted by Hersh
as saying there were limits on what he could publish from the
investigation. Other sources told Hersh that both House and Senate
chairmen told Liman not to make anything public that might disrupt
continuing efforts to gain the release of U.S. hostages in Lebanon.
   Liman told Hersh that the question of whether the diversion to
the Israelis was legal without written presidential authority _ a
finding _ was referred to the Senate and House intelligence
committees. Neither has made any public report on the matter.
   The desire to protect both Reagan and the strategic-arms
negotiations motivated senators, Hersh says.
   According to one participant, Hersh writes, ``At an early caucus
in January (1987), ... the senators reached one easy consensus. `We
don't want to go after the president,' the participant said. `He
was too old'.''
   The witness also told Hersh that senators believed Reagan could
not understand what had happened.
   Hersh quotes New Hampshire Republican Sen. Warren B. Rudman,
vice chairman of the committee, as saying ``We decided to follow
the evidence'' but agreed that ``if there was an impeachable
offense, it could only be the diversion. The point we talked about
was that if there is a conscious diversion we have no choice'' but
to seek impeachment.
   ``If it's nonfeasance and negligence, there's too much at
risk,'' Hersh quotes Rudman as saying. ``We could go on for four
years.''

   Inmates at the Loos prison mutinied
Saturday, refusing to return to their cells after an exercise
period and setting fire to a workshop, officials said. Hours later,
about 50 prisoners remained on the roof.
   Several people, including prisoners and firefighters, were
treated for smoke inhalation from the fire, which took firemen two
hours to extinguish.
   The rampage started when more than 100 prisoners refused to
return to their cells after exercise. Shortly after, another group
of 370 prisoners ran amok, starting the fire in a pile of wood in
the workshop, prison officials said.
   Authorities regained control of the interior of the prison
within hours. But about 50 prisoners took refuge on the roof, threw
tiles into the courtyard, and remained there four hours later,
officials said.
   The governor for the Nord-Pass-de-Calais region, Jean-Claude
Aurousseau, and the state prosecutor went to the scene.
   The prisoners holding out reportedly complained about guards who
fired at four escaping prisoners Jan. 28. The four were caught
several days later.
   The Loos prison houses 600 convicts. The mutiny was the first in
France in 1990. There were at least 10 such rebellions last year.

   Here is the text of President Bush's telephone
remarks Saturday to anti-abortion protesters on the Washington Mall.
   Thank you, Henry Hyde, thank you for the introduction, and thank
you as well for your commitment to life.
   Incidentally, this magnificent rally looks very, very good on
television. How do I know? Because I've seen some of it.
   I want to pay my respects to our able vice president, Dan
Quayle, and thank him for his commitment, to other members of
Congress that are there, to Dr. Willke, to Dr. Dobson, and a
special greeting to my friend, your eminences, Cardinal O'Connor
and Cardinal Hickey and others that might be in attendance.
   I'm very pleased to have this opportunity to express to you my
deeply held views about abortion on demand. In January of this
year, I addressed the March for Life on this very issue. I said
then and reaffirm now, that your presence on the mall today reminds
all of us in government that Americans from all walks of life are
committed to preserving the sanctity and dignity of human life.
   Like you, I realize that the widespread prevalence of abortion
is a tragedy, not only in terms of lives destroyed, but because it
so fundamentally contradicts the values that we as a nation hold
dear.
   And when I look at adopted children, I give thanks that their
parents chose life.
   Today, as a nation of faith and compassion, our mission must be
to help more and more Americans make the right choice, the choice
for life.
   One day, your life-saving message will have reached and
influenced every American. And until then, continue to work for the
day when respect for human life is sacrosanct and beyond question.
   I know from your devotion and selflessness that this day cannot
be far away.
   God bless you, and God bless life. Thank you very, very much.

<HEAD>East German Leader Arrives for Talks on German Unity</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-European Summit, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's new non-Communist leaders arrived
Saturday for meetings aimed at easing the concerns of President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev as his once-loyal ally spins away from the
Soviet orbit.
   East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere planned to meet
with Gorbachev on Sunday to discuss the effects of German
unification on Soviet military and economic interests.
   In an interview with the Soviet news agency Tass before leaving
East Berlin, de Maiziere emphasized close ties with Moscow. He said
East Germany could accept neither a neutral Germany nor NATO
soldiers on East German territory before an all-Europe security
system is put into place.
   ``A neutral Germany would be contrary to the spirit of the
times, corresponding instead to the old mentality of blocs,'' Tass
quoted de Maiziere as saying. ``It would only conserve military
blocs, existing as a formally neutral state between them.''
   ``We need a pan-European system of security,'' he was quoted as
saying. ``Before this system is in place, NATO military presence on
the territory of East Germany should not be allowed.''
   De Maiziere, accompanied by his foreign, defense and econimics
ministers, was greeted upon arrival in Moscow by Soviet Premier
Nikolai I. Ryzhkov.
   East Germany has been a key component in the Warsaw Pact
military alliance and an important trading partner with the
Soviets. The Soviets are seeking to preserve their current trade
agreements with East Germany, which were made under the German
nation's former Communist government.
   The talks are a prelude to formal negotiations between the
Germanys and the four World War II allies that divided them: the
Soviet Union, United States, Britain and France.
   Foreign ministers from the six nations are to begin unification
negotiations May 5 in Bonn, West Germany.
   De Maiziere has said East Germany would protect the security
interests of the Soviet Union. He has disagreed with West Germany's
insistence that a unified Germany be a part of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.
   De Maiziere was quoted in a newspaper interview on Saturday as
saying that he and the Soviets disagree with West Germany on the
alliance question.
   ``But this is not a stumbling block. There must be further
negotiations about NATO and the question of security. I will make
that clear in Moscow,'' de Maiziere said, according to the
Hamburg-based Bild newspaper.
   In Dublin, Ireland, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
said in a newspaper interview Saturday that a united Germany should
be ``militarily non-aligned,'' and could belong to both NATO and
the Warsaw Pact.
   Shevardnadze told the Irish Times that a formula was needed for
German unification ``which would not radically tip the balance'' of
military power.
   Shevardnadze insisted ``membership of a united Germany in NATO
is unacceptable to us, since it would mean a radical disruption of
the current balance of forces in Europe.''
   Soviet and East German leaders also are likely to discuss
Poland's demand that it be protected from any claim a united
Germany may make on former German lands ceded to Poland after World
War II.
   Poland late Friday gave a copy of a proposal to diplomats from
both German states that it wants to be the framework for such a
guarantee, East Germany's ADN news service and Poland's PAP news
service said.
   In Bonn, a West German government spokesman confirmed officials
there have received the proposal. Kohl has been reluctant to make a
commitment to Poland's current borders, saying the question must be
dealt with after unification.

<HEAD>Croatian Democratic Union Leads In Final First Round Results</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ZAGREB, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A center-right coalition garnered more
than 79 percent of the seats in the first round of Croatia's first
free elections in 50 years, according to final results published
Saturday.
   A total of 131 seats in the 356-seat tri-cameral regional
parliament were decided in the first round of voting April 22-23,
the state Tanjug news agency reported. The remaining 225 seats are
to be voted on in a second round of balloting May 6-7.
   The center-right Croatian Democratic Union won 104 of the 131
seats decided, while the Communist Party _ renamed the Party for
Democratic Reform _ won 13, according to final official results
carried by Tanjug.
   The centrist Coalition for National Accord won 3 seats, Tanjug
said.
   While in the first round more than 50 percent of the vote was
needed to win a seat, in the second round only a simple majority is
required.
   Franjo Tudjman, the leader of the Union, has expressed
confidence that his party will emerge victorious after the second
round of voting.
   He said after the first round last week that the first task of
his party would be to prepare a new Western-style democratic
constitution for Croatia and to discuss Yugoslavia's future with
other states in the Yugoslav federation.
   Tudjman's party favors Yugosalvia becoming a loose alliance of
semi-independent states in a confederation.
   The Croatian Democratic Union, which waged a campaign based
largely on national sentiments, was vehemently opposed during the
election by Serbs, who make up about 10 percent of Croatia's 4.8
million people.
   Serbia and Croatia, the second-largest state, have been
traditional rivals ever since they united in Yugslavia in the
aftermath of World War I.
   Yugoslavia is curently a looose federation of six republics.
   Croatia and the neighboring republic of Slovenia have held
Yugoslavia's first post-war multiparty elections. Two more member
republics are planning to hold similiar elections later this year.
Communist-ruled Montenegro and Serbia have not legalized opposition
parties.

   ``Smart cars'' that give drivers the latest
traffic information on a computer screen will soon take to the
roads in Florida and California in an experiment aimed at heading
off gridlock on overburdened highways.
   Test programs in Los Angeles and Orlando over the next three
years will feature cars equipped with computer screens using
satellite-delivered traffic information from sensor-equipped
``smart highways.''
   They are the start of a combined federal-state,
private-and-public effort to avoid future shock on American roads:
gridlock caused by ever-growing numbers of motorists on too few
highways that are aging more quickly than they can be repaired,
rebuilt or replaced.
   The application of electronic and communications technology
``can add efficiency and capacity without adding pavement,''
contends the Highway Users Federation, one of the groups behind the
project.
   Experts say the technology is available, only the money and
direction for its application are needed. The two test programs and
an Orlando-area conference this week are intended to better define
the problems and solutions.
   The National Leadership Conference on Implementing Intelligent
Vehicle-Highway Systems, starting Thursday, is expected to set
forth a plan for action ``and maybe get some startup of a national
organization to carry this forward,'' said Mark Norman of the
Highway Users Federation, a lobbying group.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, who will speak at the
conference, is calling for a transportation revolution because the
nation's airports, highways, bridges, waterways and mass transit
systems are simply wearing out.
   Experts say that since no new systems are in the works, the
existing infrastructure must be made safer and more efficient.
   To get the new technologies on the road, Skinner wants a
national research project supported by federal, state and local
governments and by corporate and private groups.
   The ``smart car'' concept involves the driver, the vehicle and a
traffic management team _ much as air travel involves the pilot,
the aircraft and air traffic control.
   In California's Pathfinder program, expected to get rolling in a
month or two, 25 smart cars will operate on the Santa Monica
Freeway and parallel arteries. They will receive traffic
information on dashboard-mounted electronic displays that are
constantly updated.
   The screens tell drivers of congestion and outline alternate
routes. In return, the cars feed information about road conditions
to a central computer.
   The $2 million cost of the two-year test is being paid by the
Federal Highway Administration, General Motors and the California
Transportation Department.
   In the larger and more sophisticated Orlando trial, called
Travtek, 100 cars will be rented and leased to tourists and
residents who drive frequently, said Jack Butler of the state
Department of Transportation.
   The computer screens will be able to suggest the shortest,
least-congested routes and how to avoid construction areas and
accidents.
   The one-year evaluation is to begin in early 1992. The
approximately $8 million cost will be borne by the federal and
state transportation departments, General Motors and the American
Automobile Association.
   Surveillance cameras are being installed along a portion of
Interstate 4 in the Orlando area to monitor traffic flow and
problems like accidents. The data will be fed via satellite to the
smart cars' dashboard computers, along with information from
traffic spotters in helicopters.
   Orlando, like other cities, already has the start of smart
highways in the form of computerized traffic signals that monitor
tieups at intersections. The computer changes traffic lights
accordingly.
   In Europe, an $800 million-plus project called Prometheus is
aimed at improving highway and traffic safety and relieving
congestion through smart cars, smart highways and computers.
   In Japan, three similar programs are under way.
   ``People in this country feel that we are behind not because of
technology, but in the institutional framework _ establishing
public and private partnerships,'' said Norman. ``That's what this
conference is aiming at.''

<TEXT>
   Bart Simpson, the spiky-headed cartoon
champion of underachievement, has been expelled from an elementary
school whose principal says he teaches kids the wrong lesson.
   Bill Krumnow, principal of Lutz Elementary School in Ballville
Township, asked students not to wear T-shirts bearing the likeness
of the bug-eyed wisecracking 10-year-old star of the Fox Television
cartoon show, ``The Simpsons.''
   Krumnow made the announcement, which he maintains is not an
outright ban, on Wednesday over the school's public address system
after consulting with teachers.
   At issue is a shirt that boasts, ``Under-achiever and proud of
it, man.'' The shirt is part of a line of ``The Simpsons'' family
gear.
   ``To be proud of being an incompetent is a contradiction of what
we stand for,'' said Krumnow. ``We strive for excellence and to
instill good values in kids.''
   Krumnow also said he's no fan of the weekly show, saying it
``teaches the wrong thing to students.''
   The response from the show's makers? Don't have a cow, man, as
Bart would say. Cool your jets. Antonia Coffman, a spokeswoman for
the show, said that the Simpsons aren't meant to set any kind of
example.
   ``We know the family isn't exactly a role model family. We know
they're not the brightest family in America. They're not meant to
be,'' Coffman said. ``This is satire.''
   Cathy Reiter, mother of a Lutz fourth-grader, thinks the flap is
senseless.
   ``They're blowing it way out of proportion. It's only a
cartoon,'' she said. ``To me, it's comical.''
   She said her daughter, Holly, has several Simpson shirts,
including the one that offended Krumnow.
   Krumnow isn't the first school official to discipline Bart,
Coffman told The Blade of Toledo.
   But he is fast becoming a cult hero anyway, she said.
   ``We know Bart's a brat,'' she said. ``Bart spelled differently
is Brat. He's a holy terror.''
   Krumnow doesn't expect Bart's effect on his young fans to last.
   ``Bart is a big thing right now,'' he said. ``But it's a passing
fad.''

<TEXT>
   In a sign of growing black
divisions, a militant group on Saturday accused the African
National Congress of ``appeasement'' for agreeing to negotiate with
the white-led government.
   In other developments, police said a black policeman and his
father were killed by gunmen, and a police general said the
nation's crime rate has reached alarming proportions.
   Some 3,000 supporters of the radical Pan Africanist Congress, a
rival of the larger ANC, gathered in the Atteridgeville township
outside Pretoria on Saturday for the funeral of Pan Africanist
leader Jeff Masemola.
   Masemola, who died in a car crash two weeks ago, was freed in
October from a life prison term after serving 27 years for sabotage.
   The Pan Africanists chanted, ``One settler, one bullet!'' a
reference to whites, whom they regard as colonialists and believe
should be ousted from power by violence if necessary.
   The vice president of the Pan Africanists, M. Makwetu, in a
reference to ANC policies, said Masemola ``had no time for
compromise and appeasement.''
   ``It is very sad for the ANC to have taken that decision'' to
talk to the government, Makwetu said.
   The ANC, the largest black opposition group, is to hold
groundbreaking talks on Wednesday through Friday with President
F.W. de Klerk's government. The discussions are designed to clear
the way for negotiations on a new constitution that would include
blacks.
   ``Our choice is to fight on,'' said Cunningham Noxukwana,
general secreatary of a Pan Africanist-affiliated union
organization.
   ``A sellout is very thick in the air,'' he said of the talks.
   The Pan Africanist Congress broke away from the African National
Congress in the 1950s and disagrees with the ANC on several
tactical issues. The Pan Africanists believe blacks should be
self-reliant in their struggle for political rights, while the ANC
embraces a multiracial approach.
   Both groups favor a one-man, one-vote system and wage largely
ineffective guerrilla campaigns.
   The ANC also is engaged in a power struggle in the southeastern
province of Natal with Inkatha, a relatively conservative Zulu
organization. Fighting between the two sides has claimed 4,000
black lives in the past four years.
   Meanwhile, police said five gunmen broke into the house of
24-year-old Constable J.F. Zuma in Mpumalanga outside Durban on
Friday night, demanded ammunition, then shot him twice in the chest.
   Police said Zuma's father, in another room, heard the attack and
tried to flee from the house but was also shot and killed.
   Also, Gen. Jaap Joubert, head of the police Criminal
Investigations Division, said crime has reached alarming
proportions with almost 1.5 million serious crimes committed last
year.
   On an average day in South Africa, Joubert said, there were 32
murders, 56 rapes, 199 robberies, 160 car thefts and more than 500
cases of house-breaking.
   The national police force is also experiencing a drain of
officers, with an average of 22 a day resigning during the first
three months of this year. The government recently announced a pay
raise for police in a bid to halt the resignations.

<TEXT>
   The government plans a second bank fraud
trial for Rep. Harold Ford, and a prosecutor said Saturday he may
try to move the case out of the popular congressman's home district.
   Ford, 44, went on trial Feb. 12 in U.S. District Court in
Memphis and a mistrial was declared Friday when jurors said they
were hopelessly deadlocked.
   U.S. Attorney Hickman Ewing Jr. of Memphis said prosecutors are
considering a request for a chance of venue ``so the government can
get a fair trial.''
   The Democratic congressman was indicted in Knoxville in 1987 and
the case was moved to Memphis at his request.
   Tennessee's only black member of Congress, Ford claimed he was
``judicially kidnapped'' when prosecutors sought his indictment in
eastern Tennessee, which is heavily white and Republican.
   Ford's district in Memphis is 58 percent black and he has
avoided any serious challenge for re-election since first elected
to Congress in 1974.
   One of the strongest black politicians in Memphis, Ford was
preparing to run for mayor when his indictment sidetracked those
plans. He declined to say what effect his continuing legal woes
will have on his future political plans.
   Memphis is 50 percent black but has never elected a black mayor.
The city will hold municipal elections next year.
   Ford is accused of taking political payoffs from former
Tennessee bankers Jake and C.H. Butcher Jr., who set off the
largest banking collapse in the state's history in 1983.
   The Butchers are serving 20-year prison sentences for bank fraud.
   A mistrial was also declared for his Ford's codefendants,
accountant David Crabtree and lawyers Douglas Beaty and Karl
Schledwitz. All three are former Butcher aides.
   Ewing said prosecutors may ask for a new site for Ford's second
trial because of extensive news media coverage surrounding the
first one.
   The congressman held what amounted to daily news conferences
throughout the trial, Ewing said, while prosecutors were barred by
district court rules from talking about the case.
   Ford claims his indictment is the work of racist prosecutors who
dislike him personally, an allegation the government denies.
   Shortly after Ford's indictment, a federal judge in Knoxville
issued orders telling the defendants not to talk about the case in
public. Ford complained that a member of Congress could not be
barred from addressing his constituents and an appeals court
removed the gag order as it applied to him.
   Ford was indicted in Knoxville, the government says, because the
bank fraud conspiracy he is accused of taking part in was centered
there.
   After the mistrial was declared, Ford said he hoped the
government would decide to drop the case.
   ``What we will do is go now to the Justice Department and let
them review this case to see whether or not the government has had
its day in court,'' he said.
   Ford said he regarded the mistrial as a victory.
   ``This is certainly a big defeat for the government,'' he said.

   About 40 homes in the city of Alamo were
damaged and a few homes were declared unfit for habitation after
two earthquakes rumbled through Northern California, officials said
Saturday.
   Damage included broken glass, toilets knocked off foundations,
ruptured water and gas lines and broken furniture, according to San
Ramon Valley Fire Department spokesman Mary Raymond.
   Several homes were deemed uninhabitable by inspectors with the
Contra Costa County Building Department after the temblors Friday
night, Raymond added.
   She said follow-up inspections would determine the severity of
the damage.
   Two jolts in Contra Costa County, on the Concord Fault, produced
preliminary Richter Scale readings of 4.6 and 3.9, according to the
University of California Seismographic Station in Berkeley. The
U.S. Geological Survey measured the temblors at magnitudes 4.6 and
4.3.
   The quakes were centered some 30 miles east of San Francisco,
four miles east of Walnut Creek, seismologists reported.
   The shocks swept cans and bottles off supermarket shelves and
knocked out power to thousands of homes in Concord, Danville,
Walnut Creek and Alamo, jostling the nerves of residents.
   The first hit at 9:41 p.m. and another shock hit six minutes
later. Several quakes measuring 2.5 and smaller shivered through
the area after that.
   The largest jolts were felt from Vacaville to Marin County to
San Francisco.
   A spokeswoman for the state Office of Emergency Services said
the shocks were part of the continuing series shaking the region
this month. Tremors of up to 5.5 on the Richter scale were felt in
the Bay area on April 6 and April 18. None caused any major damage.
   The 7.1-magnitude quake that hit the region Oct. 17 claimed 67
lives and caused some $7.1 billion in damage.
   At the Alamo Safeway, employees closed the store and filled
carts with bottled water and batteries to sell at the front door.
Their floors were a mess with broken bottles and scattered cans.
   Karen Allen, Walnut Creek police dispatcher, reported from her
post that ``things fell off the shelves behind the console.''
   The Bay Area Rapid Transit system was shut down for 24 minutes
while crews conducted inspections to ensure the safety of
passengers, said spokesman Mike Healy. ``We're in good shape,'' he
reported.
   Brad Thomas, a spokesman for Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.,
reported that the quakes left 1,300 homes in the Concord area
without power and scattered outages in other areas.
   Mild shaking took place at the press box at Candlestick Park
where the San Francisco Giants were playing the St. Louis
Cardinals, said sportswriter Brian Martin.
   ``People who have been through them knew what it was. ... It was
business as usual,'' Martin said.
   At six-story Mount Diablo Hospital in Concord, nursing
supervisor Mary Bacon said: ``There was a sudden crack and then a

   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 4 on the Richter scale can cause moderate
damage in the local area, a 5 considerable damage. A 7 reading is a
``major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage.

   Faced with a flood of phone calls and
facsimile messages claiming responsibility for terrorist attacks,
Colombia's news media are beginning to ignore the messages.
   The reason is simple _ it is impossible to tell who is really on
the other end of the line. Drug traffickers? Police posing as drug
traffickers? Leftist guerrillas? Pranskters?
   Until a few weeks ago, virtually all of Colombia's radio
stations and newspapers used the statements without question. No
one pointed out the information came from anonymous people and
could not be verified.
   Recently, the country's two leading newspapers, Bogota's El
Espectador and El Tiempo, chose not to publish news about some of
the anonymous messages.
   An example of the confusion came after leftist presidential
candidate Carlos Pizarro was killed Thursday by an assassin on a
Colombian airliner.
   Within two hours, the anonymous telephone calls started.
   It was the Medellin cartel, one man said. Another president
would be assassinated, he said.
   On Friday came another facsimile message, also supposedly from
the Medellin cartel, to a Bogota radio station, Caracol.
   It wasn't us, the supposed cartel communique said. It accused
the police of killing people and setting off bombs so that the
cartel would be blamed.
   Another example came after a truck bomb in Medellin killed 20
people on April 11.
   Facsimile statements under the letterhead of the Extraditables,
a name assumed by leaders of the Medellin cartel, said the cartel
was not responsibile.
   Recently there have been facsimile and telephone messages from
anonymous people claiming to speak for the cartel, saying those
statements directly after the April 11 bombing were fakes.
   ``Somebody has been using us as their public relations office,''
a senior editor at a Bogota newspaper said Saturday.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Saturday tried
to dispel European concerns over the enormous costs of German
unification, saying West Germany won't ``stick its hand into the
money bag'' of the European Community.
   At a one-day summit of the 12-member community, Kohl addressed
the issue of the hundreds of billions of West German marks it will
cost to reunite the two German states created after the defeat of
Nazi Germany in World War II.
   ``The Federal Republic of Germany ... does not intend to stick
its hand into the money bag of the EC,'' Kohl was quoted as saying
by his spokesman, Hans Klein.
   ``For example, the Mediterranean countries should not suffer as
a result of unification,'' Kohl said, according to Klein.
   At a news conference, Kohl rejected an assertion that he is
proceeding too quickly with unification, saying, ``Nothing is
rushing forward head over heels.''
   Kohl also reaffirmed Bonn's strong commitment to the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, rejecting Soviet proposals that a
united Germany belong to both NATO and the Warsaw Pact until a new
security system could be formed.
   At a separate news conference, French President Francois
Mitterrand also said a unified Germany must stay in NATO.
   In an interview with The Irish Times of Dublin, Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze suggested a ``non-aligned'' status for
the joined German state.
   Shevardnadze will meet with U.S. Secretary of State James A.
Baker III and counterparts from France, Britain and the two
Germanys in Bonn next Saturday to discuss the international
questions of German unification.
   Kohl expressed his appreciation for the overwhelming support he
received from the other leaders for the German unification process,
Klein said.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, originally uneasy
about the implications of German unification, welcomed Kohl's
entire approach, her officials said.
   ``The prime objective of this council (summit) has been
fulfilled,'' said a British government spokesman, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``The European Community has a clear plan
and a scheme for handling it.''
   Poorer community members had been uneasy as well. Spain and
Portugal, for example, are heavily dependent on EC programs for
redistributing Western European wealth.
   On Thursday, EC Commission President Jacques Delors raised
eyebrows among the British by suggesting a small EC fund to help
prop up East Germany's nearly collapsed economy.
   The British were quick to say they were not interested in any
such contribution to East Germany.
   Klein said Kohl made it clear that West Germany was ``not
pushing'' for such extra help for the troubled nation.
   Enormous amounts of money are at stake in unification, which has
received the blessing of the EC leaders.
   Experts estimate it could cost $130 billion to clean up East
Germany's polluted environment. About $300 billion will be needed
to revamp computers, telecommunications and other forms of
electronic information systems.
   Kohl's government has agreed to exchange East German wages,
pensions and small savings into West German marks at a 1-to-1 rate
as of July 2, triggering unease in financial markets.
   Many businessmen and bankers say the planned exchange rate could
lead to massive inflation. They think the entire economic venture
is taking West Germany into uncharted and potentially dangerous
waters.
   West Germany's finance minister on Saturday reassured West
Germans that they will not have to pay higher taxes to finance
unification of the Germanys.
   Kohl is counting on the private businesses already setting up in
East Germany to aid in economic unification, and he says other
countries should become involved economically as well.
   ``He urgently called on other (EC) partners to invest in East
Germany,'' Klein said.
   However, the huge head-start enjoyed by the West Germans has
already raised concerns they will reap most of the advantages of
unification.
   Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens warned the other leaders
that West Germany shouldn't be allowed to have advantages in East
Germany that others don't have.
   ``I believe that everyone will agree ... there shouldn't be any
unreasonable advantages, and that, for that reason, the usual
supervisory mechanisms have to apply,'' Martens said, according to
a written version of his remarks.

   A few years ago town selectmen took up the
task of repairing the sagging, century-old covered wooden bridge
over the Ottauquechee River. The result _ complete with greenish
plastic glass windows in the roof _ has townspeople and
preservationists aghast.
   Purists say there was something magical about the darkness in
the Lincoln Bridge, built in 1877.
   ``One old farmer told me he liked the darkness of the bridge
because he'd kiss his wife every time they drove through it,''
recalls Harry Francis, owner of the neighboring Lincoln Inn. ``Now
I'm cheek to jowl with this tragic atrocity.''
   When they assigned the repair task to state engineers, the
selectmen suggested that a few skylights might be included.
   ``It was a safety issue, not just for drivers but for the
pedestrians milling about on the bridge,'' said Woodstock Town
Manager Phillip Swanson. ``We had tourists from all across the
country walking around in the dark.''
   But when the bridge reopened last month after the long
renovation, there were six pea-green plastic glass skylights
installed in a corrugated, baked-enamel roof.
   ``What bothers me is if you are going to put all of this money
into restoring it, why does it have to look like a McDonald's
hamburger stand?'' one resident, William McDonald, said at a recent
town meeting.
   ``There is nothing historical about the bridge anymore. It's
just a wooden bridge in the same location,'' said Frank Teagle, a
Woodstock preservationist.
   Even town officials concede the plastic skylights aren't quite
what they had in mind.
   ``There are greens and there are greens,'' says Selectman Thomas
Debevoise III.
   The controversy has prompted plenty of finger-pointing.
   ``It would have made things a lot easier if Mr. Gilbertson had
said `No' when the plans came in,'' said Debevoise, a reference to
the director of the state Division of Historic Preservation.
   Eric Gilbertson said he wishes his office had caught the
skylights, but they somehow slipped by.
   Engineer Peter Gratiot, of nearby Pomfret, who has had an office
in Woodstock for 35 years, has fought for an all-wood restoration
since 1986. He said he mistakenly overlooked the skylights while
concentrating on what he called ``the real battle'' _ the fight to
keep the bridge authentic from a pure engineering standpoint.
   Gratiot and members of the National Society for the Preservation
of Covered Bridges wanted restoration as the original planner, T.
Willis Pratt, would have designed it: free of steel girders and
using mostly wood.
   ``But state engineers are not trained in wood,'' said Gratiot.
Now the bridge has both steel supports and the skylights.
   Swanson, who drives over the bridge every day to work, dismisses
the charge that the historical value of the bridge has been
damaged. ``It's just as old as it ever was.''
   Woodstock, a town of about 3,500, is one of Vermont's leading
resort communities, thanks in large part to the efforts of the
Rockefeller family, which bought and restored several historic
buildings in the village, paid to bury utility lines and took other
measures aimed at recreating a 19th-century New England village.
   The bridge is one of three covered wooden structures in
Woodstock. The other two bridges are illuminated by either lattice
work or window notches in the walls.
   In addition to the skylights, the non-wood roof is another sore
point. Officials say it is easier to maintain.
   Francis, McDonald and others are petitioning for another roof.
The Board of Selectmen will decide by May 1 whether to allow a
group of private citizens to raise enough money _ $20,000 by some
estimates _ to install traditional cedar shingles.
   If the selectmen reject the wood shingle idea, resident Dennis
DePaul said he will petition again.
   ``The quality of life is high in Woodstock because the
forbearers of the town had the intelligence and generosity to
create beauty,'' he said. ``We are the stewards of that beauty and
history. It's important that we hang on to it.''

<HEAD>Tree Grower Charged With Slavery</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A commercial tree grower who allegedly
imprisoned migrant workers, forced them to work 16-hour days and
shaved their heads has surrendered to authorities.
   Edwin Ives, 53, turned himself in Friday in Los Angeles after
three of his foremen and an alleged alien smuggler were arrested
earlier in the day at his 49-acre Ventura County ranch.
   A federal complaint charges Ives with keeping about 150
undocumented workers, some for as long as nine months, during a
three-year period at the ranch, where eucalyptus trees and other
ornamental plants are grown. Among the accusations: that the
workers even had to pay for the haircuts when their heads were
shaved.
   Ives denied the allegations through his lawyer.
   The defendants and Ives' company, Griffith-Ives Co., are charged
with conspiracy to deprive people of their civil rights, assistant
U.S. attorney Crol Gillam said.
   They could also be indicted under the Fair Labor Standards Act
and for alleged violations of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural
Worker Protection Act, a federal prosecutor said.
   According to the complaint, the aliens were smuggled from Mexico
and promised good wages. But when they arrived they found they
could not leave the ranch, which is surrounded by a 7-foot
chain-link and plastic glass fence.
   As many as 150 aliens may have been held as long as nine months,
Ms. Gillam said. They were forced to work 16-hour days six days a
week. They were paid wages, but had to pay for food, clothing,
toilet paper, tools and bedding, she said. They were also charged a
smuggling fee, according to prosecutors.
   The allegations were reported to authorities by a worker who
said he escaped the ranch earlier this month by crawling under a
fence.
   ``It was slave labor,'' said Fernando Maldonado, 49. ``We could
not leave. We realized we had entered the mouth of the wolf.''
   Ives was freed on $150,000 bail, Ms. Gillam said. Ives'
attorney, Robert Talcott, said the charges were unfounded.
   ``As the proceedings unfold, the facts will reveal that none of
the allegations of peonage and involuntary servitude and the like
have an iota of support,'' Talcott said.

   Christian leaders reopened shrines and churches
in the Holy Land Saturday after a 24-hour closure but threatened to
shut their doors again if Jewish settlers remain in the Christian
quarter of the Old City.
   The 150 Jewish settlers moved into a four-building complex owned
by the Greek Orthodox Church in the Christian quarter on April 11.
   The move interrupted Easter celebrations and provoked
demonstrations by angry clerics and Palestinians, both Christian
and Moslem.
   Last week, after repeated denials, the Israeli government
admitted it had contributed $1.8 million to help establish the
settlement, provoking outrage in Israel and abroad.
   Israel's Supreme Court has ordered the settlers to leave by
Tuesday, but said 20 settler guards and maintenance staff could
remain pending a final ruling on the tenancy dispute.
   On Friday, leaders of nine major Christian sects closed their
churches for a day after the Greek Orthodox Church locked the gates
to the church of the Holy Sepulcher, where Catholics say Jesus was
crucified and buried. It was believed to be the first time the
church of the Holy Sepulcher closed its doors in 800 years.
   Church leaders plan more protests unless all of the settlers
leave.
   ``If the situation continues to be critical, we will have to
close churches again, hold more special prayers and appeal to the
international community to pressure Israel to evict the settlers,''
said Lufti Laham, the Melchite Catholic bishop.
   They did not say when they might hold more protests.
   ``The closure of churches and houses of worship in Jerusalem,
Bethlehem, Nazereth and the Galilee was never done, not even in the
darkest conditions. This shows how serious we are,'' said George
Hintilian, secretary to Armenian patriarch Torkum Manoogian.
   Latin Patriarch Michel Sabbah said on Vatican radio that the
church protest aimed was aimed at showing the world that in
Jerusalem, ``the non-Jewish population is in danger.''
   ``The Palestinian population has been left without any
protection,'' Sabbah said. ``And among the Palestinians are also
Christians.''
   Palestinians see the Jewish presence in the predominantly Arab
neighborhood as part of a campaign to push them out.
   The Old City, captured from Jordan during the 1967 Middle East
war, is divided into jealously guarded sectors _ the Christian
quarter, the Jewish quarter, the Armenian quarter and the Moslem
quarter.
   The Jewish settlers say they intend to leave peacefully but only
after the Israeli Independence Day, which begins Sunday night and
ends Monday night.
   On Friday, Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek accused caretaker Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's government of acting in an
``underhanded'' manner.
   Kollek, mayor of Jerusalem since 1965, predicted that if the
right-wing premier stays in power, tensions will increase in the
Holy City instead of leading Israel to peace talks with the Arabs.
   Shamir is trying to form a coalition government following Labor
leader Shimon Peres' failure to do so. The last Labor-Likud
coalition collapsed March 15 over differences toward U.S.-backed
peace proposals with the Palestinians.

<TEXT>
   European Community leaders adopted a plan
Saturday to achieve political union by January 1993, but Britain
warned they will run into trouble when they get to the details.
   ``I think the Community today firmly and decisively and
categorically committed itself to political union,'' declared Irish
Prime Minister Charles Haughey, host of the 12-nation summit at the
medieval Dublin Castle.
   ``I think the whole process is now inevitable,'' hee said.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, backed by French President
Francois Mitterrand, pressed for a speedy merger, arguing it went
hand-in-hand with rapidly approaching German unification.
   ``Francois Mitterand and I, and others, want to see the European
Community strengthened,'' Kohl told a news conference. ``That in
plain words means abandoning certain national competencies.''
   But British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, in
characteristically blunt language, predicted the process of
European union would founder as soon as the member states faced the
prospect of having to cede national sovereignty and accept
collective decision-making.
   ``There is quite a lot of rhetoric and far too little
nitty-gritty,'' Mrs. Thatcher told reporters at the end of the
one-day summit. ``Clearly they do not quite know what political
union means. It astounds me.''
   The leaders agreed to instruct their foreign ministers to draw
up a draft for political union by the next summit in June, with the
aim of calling an inter-governmental conference on the subject in
December.
   It will parallel a conference already scheduled at which
governments are to discuss a single currency and central banking
system for Europe. A summit declaration said both conferences
should finish their work before the end of 1992.
   Again, Mrs. Thatcher was skeptical. While she thought the
leaders could come up with an agreed formula for political union by
the end of 1992, she predicted that the work on economic and
monetary union would run into ``much fiercer debate.''
   Asked why she endorsed the summit's call for political, economic
and monetary union, she replied that she was confident it would all
come to much less than her European partners now imagined.
   ``I would have thought two years should be enough to know
certainly on political union which way you should go. Economic and
monetary union is a much, much more complicated thing and will give
rise to much longer consideration and much fiercer debate,'' she
said.
   Mrs. Thatcher was not alone in her stance toward political
union. Community officials said several other countries including
Denmark, Luxembourg and Portugal also had reservations.
   German unification was what prompted Ireland, as current
president of the Community, to set up a summit ahead of schedule.
But a Franco-German call on April 15 for political union by 1992
shifted the focus of Saturday's gathering toward European merger.
Kohl and Mitterrand believe union is urgently needed to preserve
European stability in the face of upheaval in Eastern Europe.
   Kohl assured his partners that Germany had no intention of
``sticking its hand into the moneybag of the European Community''
to finance the huge cost of unifying Germany.
   The summit endorsed a plan to incorporate East Germany into the
Community when it is united with West Germany. The program will
temporarily exempt the economically backward former communist
country from the Community's stringent enviromental standards and
restrictions on state subsidies to industry.
   It also promises that moves to incorporate East Germany will
begin July 2 when the two German currencies merge.
   The summit agreed to reach association agreements with the other
new democracies of Eastern Europe, but there was no question of
them joining the wealthy trading bloc soon.
   The summit, taking place in neutral Ireland, did not go into
defense questions in detail, but Kohl repeatedly assured the other
leaders that a united Germany wanted to remain in the 16-nation
North Atlantic treaty Organization.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, in an interview
with the irish Times published Saturday, reiterated that a united
Germany in NATO was unacceptable to Moscow. He called for a
``militariliy non-aligned'' Germany and suggested it could belong
to both NATO and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   Although Western officials have rejected the idea, Shevardnadze
said it was ``food for thought.''
   Analysts say a political merger of the EC countries probably
would include a common foreign and security policy. Some predict
the EC countries eventually will become a kind of United States of
Europe but still maintain their distinct languages and cultures.
   The European Community members are Belgium, Britain, Denmark,
France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.

<HEAD>Singh: Trade Treaties Won't Be Changed Under U.S. `Hit List'
Threat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   India, cited by the United States for
unfair trade practices, said Saturday it would never negotiate
trade treaties under threat, United News of India reported.
   The news agency quoted Prime Minister V.P. Singh as saying India
was trying to strengthen its economy and could not ignore its
social priorities because of the American action Friday.
   Singh commented at a news conference during a visit to the
northern Indian city of Lucknow.
   Senior businessmen in New Delhi sharply criticized the United
States for keeping India on the ``hit list'' of countries targeted
for unfair trade practices.
   President Bush left India as the only country still cited under
the 1988 U.S. Omnibus Trade Act, which allows U.S. tariffs of up to
100 percent on goods imported from a nation judged an unfair
trader. Bush removed Japan and Brazil from the list.
   ``The decision is unfortunate and an avoidable development,''
said Viren J. Shah, president of the Associated Chamber of Commerce
and Industries.
   Hari Shankar Singhania, chairman of the Indian section of the
Indo-U.S. Joint Business Council, said any attempt to ``force''
India to change its economic policies under threat of retaliatory
action was ``against all tenets of multilateralism.''
   India has steadfastly refused to modify its restrictive trade
policies, designed to protect domestic industries by limiting
foreign investment and imposing high import duties.
   Ever since India first was targeted, the government has
maintained the U.S. trade law unfairly penalized developing nations.
   Shah said the United States and India could have shown greater
flexibility in dealing with the problem. He encouraged India to
continue its economic liberalization and urged Washington to look
``sympathetically'' on India.
   Under former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, India began a program
of relative economic liberalization, opening up to limited foreign
investment. But Singh's government has shown few signs of
continuing those policies.
   Relatively few foreign products are seen in the world's second
most populous nation. Last year, foreign firms invested only $200
million in India.
   India's 880 million people have a per capita annual income of
only $290, but there is a growing consumer market among the 25
percent of the population reckoned as middle-class.
   America's trade deficit with India is only a fraction of the one
it has with Japan.
   India has a trade surplus of about $850 million with the United
States. For the fiscal year that ended in March, Japan's surplus
with the United States was $42.8 billion, down 12.7 percent from
$49 billion in the previous fiscal year.
   The United States is India's largest trading partner. India's
exports consist primarily of clothing, diamonds, crude oil and
cashew nuts. Its chief American imports are fertilizers, chemicals,
electronic parts and industrial materials.

   Police used tear gas and dogs Saturday
against a group of about 50 skinheads who barricaded themselves in
a restaurant in the southwestern city of Nordhausen, East Germany's
official news service said.
   Five of the skinheads, a term for radical right-wing youths with
closely shaved heads, were injured in the clash, and 150 were
arrested, the ADN news service said.
   About 200 youths had gathered in the restaurant and all but
about 50 obeyed police orders to leave, ADN said.
   It said the youths hurled rocks and bottles at police, who
responded by firing tear gas and loosing police dogs.
   Most of the youths were West Germans in town for a rock concert,
it said. Nordhausen is about 125 miles southwest of Berlin.

   Partisan differences were put aside when Alderman
Robert Shaw came to the rescue of a colleague and political foe who
suddenly began choking at lunch.
   ``I was really gasping for breath,'' Alderman Bernard L. Stone
said after Friday's mishap. ``He really saved my life.''
   Shaw was dining with Stone and Aldermen Fred Roti and Thomas
Cullerton at a restaurant across the street from City Hall, when
Stone choked on a sandwich.
   ``I had to really reach around him but I was able to get my
hands around his chest and apply the Heimlich maneuver,'' Shaw
said. The rescue technique involves the application of a sudden,
sharp pressure to the abdomen below the rib cage.
   Stone is a white Democrat-turned-Republican representing a ward
along the city's north border. He was among the City Council bloc
that long blocked programs of the city's first black mayor, Harold
Washington, who was elected in 1983 and died in office in 1987.
   Shaw is a black Democrat and represents a ward on the city's
southern border.
   Stone said that there was a touch of chaos when he got into
trouble.
   ``Freddy started telling everyone else what to do. Thomas
Cullerton tried to put his arms around me, but he is too small. I
am gasping and Shaw stood up and saved me.''
   Stone ``is a big guy, so I had to really reach around,'' Shaw
said with a laugh.
   ``I would do that for anyone _ even if they didn't support
Harold Washington,'' Shaw said.

<HEAD>East German Farmers Protest Food Imports from West</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East German farmers parked tractors and
trucks at highway border crossings and tied up traffic Saturday to
dramatize their fears about West German food imports.
   East German farmers have become increasingly worried that they
will lose their livelihoods to West German agribusinesses.
   In East Berlin, about 500 demonstrators took to the streets to
protest government sales of houses and prime plots of land to
former members of the ousted Communist government. The
demonstrators demanded that the new, democratically elected
government investigate the matter.
   The farm protest backed up traffic for an hour on the highway
between the southern East German city of Plauen and the West German
border town of Hof, police said.
   East Germany's official news agency ADN also said farmers used
their vehicles to block border crossings at Blosenberg, Gassenreuth
and Heinersgruen, which border the West German state of Bavaria. It
gave no figures on the number of farmers involved.
   East German Agriculture Minister Peter Pollack has said he would
seek to control Western food imports and promote local products.
   Many Western goods already are flooding across the border even
though the German states have not completed agreement on how they
will merge their economies. A full economic union is planned for
July 2.

<HEAD>Soviet Pilot Rests After Marrow Transfusion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet pilot who got radiation poisoning from
his efforts to stem the Chernobyl nuclear disaster was described as
happy and relieved Saturday, as the wait began to see if new bone
marrow will save his life.
   Anatoly Grishchenko, 53, who suffers from a pre-leukemia
condition, has been honored in the Soviet Union for his work to put
a cement cap on the reactor in the Ukraine.
   He received the marrow in a relatively simple, eight-hour
procedure completed at 2:40 a.m. Saturday, said Susan Edmonds,
spokeswoman for the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center.
   ``He is stable. He handled the transfusion very well and there
are no problems,'' she said. ``The next step is to see if the
marrow will grow.''
   Grishchenko will remain in a sterile hospital room for 35 to 40
days as the new marrow slowly re-establishes his immune system,
Edmonds said. Doctors should know in about three weeks whether the
transplant was a success.
   ``His condition will probably stay the same for another week,
two weeks,'' Edmonds said. Meanwhile, he will rest, undergo some
mild physical therapy, get transfusions of blood or blood
components, and be monitored closely for signs of infection or
marrow rejection.
   The marrow, about one quart, was taken from the hip of a
42-year-old Frenchwoman, in a procedure similar to drawing blood,
early Friday in Besancon, France. The donor asked to remain
anonymous, hospital officials said.
   Hutchinson's Dr. Patricia Stewart rushed the marrow, which can
lose its effectiveness after 24 hours, to Seattle aboard a
commercial flight. Within two hours, doctors began transfusing it
through a catheter into Grishchenko's chest, one day after the
fourth anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster.
   Marrow is a substance inside the bones which produces blood
cells. In transplants like Grishchenko's, marrow transfused into
the bloodstream makes its way to the interior of the bones.
   Grishchenko, a ``very warm, nice man,'' chatted with his wife,
Galina, and physicians during the procedure, Edmonds said.
   ``It was very clear there was a lot of happiness and relief the
marrow was here,'' she said.
   In September 1988, Grishchenko was found to have the
pre-leukemia condition, typified by low counts of blood platelets
needed for clotting and of white blood cells that fight infection
and disease. He arrived in Seattle April 11 and has undergone
radiation treatment and chemotherapy to prepare for the marrow
transplant. Such treatment often leaves a patient too weak for
doctors to try a second transplant if the first one doesn't take,
Edmonds said.
   Grishchenko, who has two sons and a granddaughter, has up to a
75 percent chance of survival without a recurrence of the condition
for five years, Edmonds said.
   The Hutchinson Center, which pioneered bone-marrow transplants,
has done about 5,000 over the past decade and now averages about
one a day, she said.
   Grishchenko is the first Chernobyl victim to receive medical
care in the United States. The transplant was arranged by his
friend Cap Parlier, light helicopter testing and evaluation
director for McDonnell Douglas Corp.
   The donor was found in a nine-country search.
   Grishchenko made five flights over Chernobyl in the four days
following the April 26, 1986, explosion and fire.
   He flew through hot, intensely radioactive gases spewing from
the plant to survey the damage and to dump tons of sand and wet
concrete onto the wreckage.
   He was issued lead-lined clothing and his copters were equipped
with extra lead shielding. But he was treated soon after for
radiation sickness.
   According to official figures, 31 people were killed in the
Chernobyl disaster. Unofficial reports said at least 250 died, and
recent estimates are that at least 4 million people were endangered
by the radiation.
   The blast scattered radioactive cesium, strontium and plutonium
isotopes across much of the Ukraine, Byelorussia and Russia and
sent a cloud of radioactive gas around the world.

   The government said Saturday it has
captured a key leader of last December's coup attempt.
   Lt. Col. Marcelino Malajacan, arrested Friday evening, is
accused of having been a major tactician in the Dec. 1-9 coup
attempt against President Corazon Aquino.
   Authorities had offered a $45,500 reward for Malajacan, who was
arrested at a house in suburban Quezon City. Military officials
said he was unarmed and did not resist.
   The December coup, considered to be the most serious of six
armed attempts to oust Mrs. Aquino, left at least 113 people dead
and more than 600 others injured.
   Military vice chief of staff Maj. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, at a news
conference, called Malajacan's arrest a major setback for the
mutineers. But he said they remained a threat.

   Seeking to protect itself from a huge new
neighbor, Poland has drafted a border treaty that it wants a
unified Germany to sign, officials said Saturday.
   The proposal is the latest effort by Poland to obtain guarantees
that a united Germany will not seek to reclaim former German lands
now part of Poland.
   Polish officials late Friday gave copies of the draft to
diplomats from both Germanys, Poland's government news service PAP
said. PAP said the draft treaty confirms the present Polish-German
border and states that the frontier has an ``international legally
binding character.''
   In Bonn, government spokesman Martin Erdmann confirmed Saturday
that West Germany received a copy of the proposal but he declined
to comment.
   Part of Nazi Germany was ceded to Poland after World War II to
make up for an even larger part of Poland absorbed by the Soviet
Union.
   Poland's borders are expected to be a key part of superpower
talks on the future of a unified Germany.
   Foreign ministers from the four World War II allies that divided
Germany _ the Soviet Union, the United States, France and Britain _
are to meet May 5 in Bonn to discuss unification with envoys from
the two Germanys.
   At the insistence of Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki,
the six nations have agreed to allow Poland to participate when the
negotiations address its borders.
   Although West Germany in 1972 signed an agreement recognizing
Poland's present borders, that agreement would not necessarily be
legally binding on a united Germany. West German ultraconservatives
have seized on unification as an opportunity to scrap the agreement.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who faces elections in
December, caused an international uproar earlier this year by
hedging on the border issue. Opponents accused him of courting the
ultraconservative vote.
   But in March the West German parliament, with Kohl's backing,
passed a resolution unequivocally confirming Poland's borders. It
also said that a united Germany should sign a border treaty
accepting the borders.
   East Germany's new democratic government already has said it
would press for full recognition of Poland's present boundaries.
   The issue probably will be discussed when East German Prime
Minister Lothar de Maiziere meets in Moscow on Sunday with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The Soviets also have demanded that
Poland's present borders be guaranteed.
   In another development, West Germany's finance minister on
Saturday reassured West Germans that they will not have to pay
higher taxes to finance the costly unification of the Germanys.
   Theo Waigel also urged East Germans to be more realistic in
their demands on West Germany.
   ``What we need now is an effective economy in West Germany that
can shoulder things without false recipes, such as tax increases
and supplementary payments,'' Waigel said in an interview with the
Hamburg-based Welt am Sonntag newspaper.
   The newspaper provided news media with an advance copy of the
interview, which will appear in its Sunday edition.
   Both Germanys have agreed to merge their economies and social
institutions by July 2, but they have differed on the best way to
finance it.
   West Germany has agreed to East Germany's demand that the nearly
worthless East German mark be traded at a 1-1 rate for the powerful
West German mark.
   The West Germans are proposing that the rate apply to salaries
and pensions but only to savings accounts of 4,000 marks ($2,300)
or less. Personal savings above 4,000 marks would be traded at a
2-1 rate.
   East Germany is pressing for a higher ceiling on personal
savings and wants to retain subsidies for rent, energy and public
services.
   In the interview, however, Waigel said that the Bonn offer
represented the limits of what the West German government could
afford. ``East German politicians must become more aware of
realities,'' he said.

<HEAD>Judge Chastises Man Accused of Rape for Calling Himself the
`Victim'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge sentenced a man to 24 years in
prison for the rape of a Yale University student in her dormitory
room in 1988, but first blasted the man for calling himself the
victim.
   Jesse R. Reed, 37, of New York City, was defiant Friday as Judge
Richard Damiani sentenced him on two counts of first-degree sexual
assault.
   Reed pleaded guilty to those charges in February under the
Alford doctrine, meaning he denied guilt but conceded that
prosecutors had enough evidence to convict him. His fingerprints
were found on two empty liquor bottles at the crime scene.
   At his first sentencing hearing April 20, the victim came to New
Haven Superior Court with several friends and, choking back tears,
read a statement to the judge. The victim was 18 at the time of the
fall 1988 attack.
   Reed then sought to withdraw his guilty plea, saying he hadn't
understood what he was doing in making the plea and that he was
unhappy with his lawyer.
   Damiani postponed sentencing for a week to review his
questioning of Reed, and said on Friday he had found it
satisfactory.
   Reed told the court on Friday that as a black man, he was being
treated unfairly by a white judicial system.
   ``I tried very hard to trust in the judicial system,'' Reed
said, ``but I feel more or less like I'm the victim.''
   That sent Damiani into a tirade, which Reed tried several times
to interrupt.
   ``You're not being sentenced for your race, you're being
sentenced for one of the most vicious sexual assaults I've ever
seen,'' Damiani said.
   The victim, who did not attend Friday's sentencing, came from
Canada and had been at Yale just six weeks when she awoke to find a
man standing in her room. He raped her twice, ransacked the room
and defecated in the hallway.
   Assistant State's Attorney Mary Elizabeth Baran said she would
not add to remarks made at the earlier hearing, when she said the
victim's ``once happy, challenging world was just shattered by this
man who has done nothing in his life but commit crimes and hurt
people.''
   Reed was serving time at Riker's Island jail in New York City
when he was tracked via his fingerprints and arrested in the New
Haven case.

<TEXT>
   A huge fire gutted the Finance
Ministry, the Treasury, the Printing Office and a post office
before authorities brought the blaze under control early Saturday.
   No injuries were reported, but officials said government
paychecks and important documents were destroyed. The cause of the
blaze was not known.
   Prime Minister Nicholas Braithwaite said the fire in the
19th-century complex in the capital's historic waterfront district
caused about $3 million in damage.
   But that figure will rise by millions of dollars, he said, when
the loss of equipment, postal orders and packages is factored in.
   Hundreds of paychecks with retroactive salary increases for
civil servants were destroyed. They were to have been distributed
Monday.
   The fire, which may have started in the post office, was
reported at 10:45 p.m. Friday and brought under control about 2
a.m., officials said. The blaze destroyed the buildings' interiors,
leaving only their brick shells standing.
   St. George's has twice been ravaged by fire, in 1771 and again
in 1775. Wooden buildings were banned after that.
   Firefighters said they were able to save the audit department in
the Treasury building, although it suffered extensive water damage.
   Braithwaite, speaking after an emergency meeting with his
Cabinet and the chief of police, said the affected government
agencies would temporarily operate out of offices provided by three
private firms and out of his own official residence.
   He urged other private businesses to provide temporary office
space.
   Braithwaite said he would ask Britain, the United States and
other countries for financial aid and help investigating the fire.
   Grenada became independent from Britain in 1974.
   Braithwaite was sworn in as prime minister March 16. He replaced
Ben Jones, who was named to complete the term of office of Herbert
Blaize, who died in December. Blaize came to power after the
U.S.-led invasion of Grenada in October 1983.

   Tammy Faye Bakker is flattered that
Bernadette Peters portrays her in a made-for-TV movie, but the wife
of convicted televangelist Jim Bakker says she won't be watching
``Fall from Grace.''
   ``It's trash, nothing but trash, and you can quote me on that,''
Mrs. Bakker told The Muskegon Chronicle from her home in Orlando,
Fla. The interview appears in the paper Sunday.
   ``I'm not going to watch it,'' she said of the movie scheduled
to air Sunday night on NBC. ``I'm not going to get upset about
something that doesn't deserve getting upset about.''
   NBC has promoted ``Fall from Grace'' as the true story behind
the rise and fall of the PTL Club television ministry founded by
the Bakkers. But Mrs. Bakker, who read the script earlier this
month, told the Chronicle that it focuses more on the intimate
details of their marriage than their ministry.
   ``How do they know what happened in our bedroom?'' Tammy Faye
said. ``It's just crazy. We have a wonderful marriage. Jim is a
loving, giving, kind man, and I don't care what the movie showed,
he never turned me down sexually.''
   Bakker was born in Muskegon and lived there until he graduated
from high school in 1959. He was convicted last year of fraud and
conspiracy charges and is serving a 45-year sentence at a federal
prison in Rochester, Minn. Bakker declined the Chronicle's request
for an interview.
   Kevin Spacey plays Jim Bakker. Mrs. Bakker said she was pleased
that actress-singer Peters was cast to play her and wondered which
gospel songs she would sing.

<TEXT>
   President Bush told a ``Rally for Life''
Saturday that ``the widespread prevalence of abortion in America is
a tragedy'' but omitted any mention of his once-outspoken support
for a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion.
   The president, who spent the morning fishing on the Potomac
River, spoke by telephone hookup to tens of thousands of people who
gathered on the Mall by the Washington Monument just a few blocks
from the White House.
   Bush spoke for just two and a half minutes. He offered
encouragement to abortion opponents without referring to proposals
to amend the Constitution or to the possibility the Supreme Court
would one day reverse its 1973 decision upholding abortion.
   ``Like you, I realize that the widespread prevalence of abortion
in America is a tragedy, not only in terms of lives destroyed but
because it so fundamentally contradicts the values we as Americans
hold dear,'' Bush said.
   The rally was designed to demonstrate strength by an
anti-abortion movement that has suffered recent political setbacks
and to reverse the impression that anti-abortion forces have been
in political decline.
   U.S. Park Police estimated the crowd at 200,000 people at 4
p.m., up from an earlier estimate of 60,000 before the really
began. Speakers at the rally claimed larger numbers.
   The National Right to Life Committee, the rally's sponsors, had
hoped for a crowd that rivaled in size an abortion-rights gathering
here that was attended by an estimated 300,000 people a year ago,
and outstrip the 75,000 who attended a January anti-abortion march
in Washington.
   The crowd mostly filled the grassy area surrounding the
Washington Monument. As springtime heat sent temperatures
approaching 90 degrees, some sought shade from surrounding trees
and others made their own out of anti-abortion placards. Lines to
refreshment stands stretched 80 yards, and the line to a water
fountain ran 30 yards.
   Kate Michelman, head of the National Abortion Rights Action
League, said her side's political and election successes in a
number of states _ and not Saturday's crowd _ are the accurate
measure of public opinion on abortion.
   In his remarks, Bush also made no direct reference to political
divisions within his own Republican party over abortion, or to
efforts by abortion opponents to win abortion restrictions in state
legislatures.
   A year ago Bush emphasized to a similar gathering that he
supported a constitutional amendment to reverse the Supreme Court's
landmark Roe vs. Wade decision that effectively gave women the
right to abortion on demand.
   Bush pointed to adoption as the appropriate alternative to
abortion.
   ``Our mission must be to help more and more Americans make the
right choice, the choice for life,'' Bush said.
   ``One day your lifesaving message will have reached and
influenced every American. And until then, continue to work for the
day when respect for human life is sacrosanct and beyond question.
I know from your devotion and selflessness that this day cannot be
far away,'' Bush said.
   Vice President Dan Quayle appeared before the group and called
legal abortion ``a terrible wound which for almost two decades has
torn at our country's heart.''
   Quayle also did not directly refer to efforts to reverse the
Supreme Court decision or to amend the Constitution. But he
asserted that ``a great majority stands together against the
terrible reality of unlimited abortion on demand.''
   ``The pro-life movement is the humanitarian movement of our
time,'' Quayle said.
   Entertainment began early in the day, long before the afternoon
program of Catholic cardinals, television evangelists, country and
gospel singers, and anti-abortion leaders.
   ``I'm here because I feel real strongly that babies have a right
to live,'' said country singer Terri Gibbs, who brought her
6-month-old son David.
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., known for his sponsorship of
anti-abortion riders to government appropriations bills, called the
other side's ``pro-choice'' slogan a fraud. He said: ``The answer
to that is, `Madam, if you're pregnant, you have a baby! You have a
baby!' Nobody should have the choice to kill an innocent human life
once it's begun.''
   The rally was held at a time when their side has sustained a
series of losses in elections and in state capitals in the wake of
the Supreme Court's Webster decision last summer. While permitting
greater state limits on abortions, the decision gave new political
vitality to supporters of abortion rights, who depicted the debate
as an attempt to take away a woman's right to make her own
reproductive decisions.
   ``At least part of the motive is to try to reverse what we feel
is a misperception about the strength of the Right to Life movement
_ and also, to give some politicians who might be wavering a little
bit of backbone,'' said Gary L. Bauer, president of the Family
Research Council and a White House aide to former President Reagan.
   ``It looks as though the court is going to ultimately reverse
Roe,'' said Dr. J.C. Willke, president of the National Right to
Life Committee, referring to the Supreme Court's 17-year-old Roe
vs. Wade decision that legalized abortions. ``Our job now is to go
to the 50 states ... and convince them to pass laws to protect
unborn babies.''
   Bush's remarks were his second by telephone hookup to
anti-abortion crowds in little more than three months.
   On the Jan. 22 anniversary of the 1973 decision upholding
abortions, Bush pledged ``this president stands with you on this
issue of life.''
   But in a demonstration of the political conflict Republicans
feel over abortion, Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, on that
same day made clear ``there is room within the party for varying
points of view on this issue.''

   Less than a month before elections, the
assassination of a third presidential candidate has pushed Colombia
to the brink of political chaos.
   After the shooting of candidate Carlos Pizarro in a jetliner
Thursday, the country's largest newspaper implored the government
to ``do something, for the love of God.''
   Addressing President Virgilio Barco, the El Tiempo editorial
said: ``In your hands, and only in your hands, is the power to
avoid the country's dissolution.''
   ``The gravest aspect of Colombia's bloodletting is that the
government has no idea how to even slow it,'' said a member of a
regional human rights committee based in Medellin, the cocaine
capital.
   He declined to be identified because he was afraid someone might
be angered by his statements and kill him. Four of his predecessors
have been assassinated.
   In recent interviews, Pizarro, the candidate for the leftist
April 19 Movement, or M-19, admitted he was afraid. But he said his
desire to lead Colombia was greater than his fear of assassins'
bullets.
   A gunman on a suicide mission shot Pizarro aboard a Colombian
jetliner after it took off from Bogota's airport. Pizarro's
bodyguards shot and killed the assassin.
   Two other presidential candidates had already been assassinated
during the campaign for May 27 elections. Sen. Luis Carlos Galan of
the ruling Liberal Party was gunned down last August at a political
rally in Bogota, and Bernardo Jaramillo of the leftist Patriotic
Union Party was killed last month at the Bogota airport.
   Authorities blamed the assassinations on drug traffickers.
   The media, citing security sources, reported that traffickers
were the main suspects in Pizarro's killing as well. But the
Medellin cartel denied involvement, and no government official has
yet said who was responsible for Pizarro's assassination.
   On Saturday Antonio Navarro, a longtime guerrilla leader of the
April 19 Movement, announced he would take Pizarro's place as
candidate for president.
   Traffickers have carried out a terrorist campaign that has
killed nearly 300 Colombians in the past nine months in an effort
to halt the government's campaign to capture and extradite drug
barons to the United States.
   Bombings by the Medellin cartel have caused millions of dollars
in property damage, led to the militarization of Medellin and other
cities and shattered the nerves of citizens.
   Pizarro's death appears to have pushed the country to its limit.
For the first time, leading politicians suggested the government
itself might be compromised by the killing.
   Several politicians and analysts said an armed assassin could
not have been aboard a jetliner without the complicity of
government and airport security personnel.
   Former president Alfonso Lopez said the assassinations of three
candidates indicated that Colombia's armed forces must be
reorganized.
   Lopez, of the Liberal Party, was president from 1974 to 1978.
   Official investigations have shown that certain members of the
armed forces are allied with drug traffickers and the country's
right-wing death squads.
   One of the country's presidential candidates, Alvaro Gomez, said
Friday that Barco should name a three-man council to run Colombia's
security forces to avoid a military coup.
   He suggested that Barco had lost control over the armed forces.
Gomez made the proposal in a written statement given to the press.
   ``Never has there been such a great and pathetic image of
anarchy,'' said Gomez, a presidential candidate of the Conservative
Party.
   Barco, of the Liberal Party, rejected Gomez's suggestion of a
triumvirate, saying the armed forces would be reorganized only if
necessary.
   Continuing to focus on a military solution to Colombia's
problems, Barco said late Friday he would double the size of a
3,000-man anti-terrorist police unit.
   The unit achieved its greatest success against drug traffickers
when it killed a Medellin cartel leader, Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha,
in a gunfight last December.
   Both Barco and his party's presidential candidate, Cesar
Gaviria, have linked Colombia's salvation to constitutional reform.
Through such reforms they hope to reform the corrupted Congress,
strengthen the judicial system and provide more political
representation for minority parties.
   According to recent polls, Gaviria is heavily favored to win the
presidential elections.

<HEAD>Justice Department Withdraws Early Recommendation on Proposed
Guidelines</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has withdrawn
Justice Department recommendations for strict sentencing guidelines
for white collar criminals, a department spokesman said Saturday.
   The spokesman, David Runkel, said the decision to take back the
department's comments to the U.S. Sentencing Commission came after
White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray told the department the White
House wanted to give the proposals further study.
   The commission last fall had unveiled proposals that would
require federal judges to impose stiff mandatory fines on companies
convicted of polluting, bilking the government and other so-called
white collar crimes.
   The Washington Post, in its Saturday editions, said that in a
Feb. 26 letter to the sentencing commission, Deputy Attorney
General Donald Ayer expressed the department's ``strong support''
for the guidelines.
   But Thornburgh, who according to the newspaper was unaware of
Ayer's letter, told him to withdraw his letter, which Ayer did on
March 16. Thornburgh's decision followed an intense lobbying
campaign at the White House by defense contractors, oil companies
and other major businesses who claimed the sentencing guidelines
could mean a ``corporate death penalty'' for some firms, the Post
said.
   However, Runkel said the department's criminal division had
given the sentencing commission its view of the proposals before
the Justice recommendations ``went through the entire review
process.''
   ``I think Boyden said, `Hey, we haven't had a chance to take a
look at these and wanted to be part of the process,''' Runkel said.
   ``They were later withdrawn so that the attorney general and
White House could take a look at them. That is being done in the
attorney general's office now,'' the spokesman said.
   The department would file new recommendations in the near
future, Runkel said.
   ``I can't say at this time what the review is going to come up
with, whether the recommendations that go back will be the same or
stronger or not,'' he added.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said Saturday that he was
``concerned that the Department of Justice has surrendered so
easily to pressure from the White House and big business to go soft
on white collar crime.''
   The department's withdrawal ``is undermining the battle against
corporate crime at the very time when stronger law enforcement is
most needed to deal with the multibillion-dollar corporate scandals
plaguing our economy and country,'' Kennedy said in a statement.
   The commission, created by Congress in 1984, last fall proposed
an escalating range of financial penalties, with the severity
becoming progressively steeper depending on the extent of
high-level management involvement, prior convictions, bribery of
public officials, defrauding of charitable organizations and risks
to national security.
   Runkel said the withdrawal will not hurt the commission's
deliberations, since it does not have a quorum of members yet to
make final decisions.
   He said the review does not represent a change of heart on
Thornburgh's part.
   ``The attorney general has a record of going after white collar
crime, has decried weak sentences and applauded strong sentences,''
Runkel said.

   Thousands of people marched through
Bogota's streets Saturday to mourn Carlos Pizarro, the slain
guerrilla leader whose presidential campaign ended with an
assassin's bullets.
   Under a steady rain, about 20,000 people trudged two miles,
chanting and waving placards appealing for peace in their war-torn
country.
   ``Not one man, not one woman, not one peso for the war,'' said
one of scores of placards.
   ``I did my duty for you, Colombia, and they killed me,'' people
chanted as they headed for the cemetery on the outskirts of the
downtown area.
   In a nationally televised address late Friday night, President
Virgilio Barco urged Colombians not to react to Pizarro's murder
with more violence.
   Barco said he was doubling the size of a police anti-terrorist
strike force that now numbers about 3,000. The strike force has
been in Medellin, Colombia's cocaine capital, in a search for the
head of the Medellin cartel, Pablo Escobar.
   Pizarro was just starting his presidential campaign when a
gunman shot him Thursday aboard a domestic airliner.
   The 38-year-old candidate had been a leftist guerrilla for 16
years and rose to be commander of a rebel organization, the April
19 Movement, known as the M-19.
   Antonio Navarro, a longtime M-19 guerrilla leader, announced
Saturday that he will run for president in place of Pizarro.
   The funeral was held in the Primatial Cathedral on the city's
huge Bolivar Plaza. The cathedral is only about 200 feet from the
site of Colombia's Palace of Justice, which was raided by the M-19
in 1985.
   More than 100 people were killed in the raid, and a fire
destroyed the interior of the building. The palace was torn down
last year.
   Pizarro was commander of the M-19 at the time of the guerrilla
takeover, but he did not take part in the raid.
   Two other presidential candidates besides Pizarro have been
assassinated during the campaign for May 27 elections. Sen. Luis
Carlos Galan of the ruling Liberal Party was gunned down last
August at a political rally in Bogota, and Bernardo Jaramillo of
the leftist Patriotic Union Party was killed last month at the
city's airport.

   Bella Spewack, who co-wrote the book to the
musical ``Kiss Me Kate'' and was instrumental in getting the Girl
Scouts into selling cookies, has died. She was 91.
   Mrs. Spewack died Friday night in her New York apartment of
natural causes, said a family friend who asked not to be identified.
   ``I am responsible for that heinous, heinous thing, the Girl
Scout Cookie,'' Mrs. Spewack once said.
   She said she came up with the idea that if the scouts tried to
sell cookies at a flower show attended by actresses, the resulting
publicity could launch cookie-selling nationwide.
   Mrs. Spewack, however, never claimed to have baked any cookies
herself.
   Born Bella Cohen in Bucharest, Romania, in 1899, she moved to
the United States, where she attended high school.
   She worked as a journalist on several New York papers and as a
theatrical press agent before she married Samuel Spewack, in 1922.
   The couple became a successful playwriting and
screenplay-writing team, winning a Tony Award in 1949 for ``Kiss Me
Kate.'' Cole Porter wrote the music for the show, which became one
of the most popular musical comedies of the modern stage.
   Mrs. Spewack and her husband also were praised for their
collaboration on ``Boy Meets Girl,'' a 1935 lampoon of the
Hollywood mystique.
   Other plays included ``Clear All Wires,'' 1932, and ``Woman
Bites Dog,'' 1946.
   They also collaborated on the screenplays for 20 films,
including ``Clear All Wires,'' 1933; ``Rendezvous,'' 1935, and ``My
Favorite Wife,'' 1940.
   Samuel Spewack died in 1971.

<TEXT>
   Police have arrested a man they believe is the
``ski mask rapist'' responsible for up to 30 rapes in Dallas since
early 1985.
   Gilbert H. Escobedo, a 38-year-old co-owner of an auto detail
shop, was arrested Tuesday night as he allegedly tried to break
into a woman's apartment in north Dallas, police said Friday.
   ``We believe the intent was to break in and rape her,''
Detective S.K. Hatchel said. ``We think it was an attempted sexual
assault.''
   Escobedo was being held on four charges of investigation of
aggravated sexual assault, a burglary charge and an attempted
burglary charge.
   Police said Escobedo is a convicted burglar who has served time
in Texas prisons off and on since 1972. New evidence has linked him
to 17 rapes, and police said they believe he committed more than a
dozen more.
   ``We had circumstantial evidence in the past, but up until this
week we were unable to make a good case,'' said Detective R.E.
Rommel. ``He had been to the penitentiary for burglary, and he knew
what he was doing. We've been watching him for several years.''
   Rommel said Escobedo is also a suspect in a rape case in
suburban Richardson and police in a Southern California city where
Escobedo recently visited want to talk to him.
   The rapist, who wore a ski mask or hood, was known for his
burglary skills. He began drawing public attention several years
ago as police realized one man seemed to be responsible for a
string of rapes.
   Most victims, police said, were women in their early 20s who
were awakened and raped by a man who had broken in through a door
or window.
   The series of rapes began in 1985 soon after Escobedo was
released from prison where he was serving a term for a burglary
conviction, officers said.
   The last attack attributed to the serial rapist was March 10,
police said.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Christian forces skirmished
Saturday with automatic rifles in east Beirut but observed a
21-hour cease-fire in the Christian hinterland to the north.
   In East Beirut, two boys playing in an empty lot were killed
when a mine exploded. The victims were 8 and 10 years old, said a
police spokesman, speaking anonymously in line with standing rules.
   The incident occurred in the district of Ein Rummaneh, held by
rebellious Christian Gen. Michel Aoun.
   Police said a man was killed and another was wounded in an
exchange of sniper fire across east Beirut between Aoun's troops
and militiamen of Samir Geagea's Lebanese forces.
   The battle for control of the Christian enclave has killed 919
people and wounded 2,442 since it broke out Jan. 30.
   Aoun, former interim prime minister, does not recognize
Christian President Elias Hrawi, whose government was set up last
November under a peace plan aimed at ending a 15-year-old civil
war. Aoun has said he opposes the plan because it lacks a fixed
timetable for the withdrawal of Syria's estimated 40,000 troops.
   Meanwhile, a truce was reported holding on the eastern flank of
the Kesrouan province. Civilians flooded the contested resorts of
Kleiat and Daraya to check on their damaged houses.
   Kleiat, once a posh spot known for its restaurants and night
clubs, has been turned into a no-man's land in savage fighting
between Aoun's 19,000 troops and Geagea's 6,000-strong militia.
   Geagea's fighters control the western half of the village, while
Aoun's men control its northern edges and direct their fire onto
its main square.
   Geagea's militiamen also control a nearby hill overlooking the
adjacent resort of Daraya, in Aoun's area of influence.
   Nearly all of Daraya's 12,000 residents have fled. Hardly 200 of
Kleiat's 20,000 residents remain, living in basements and
underground shelters.
   The police spokesman said most of the villagers who had stayed
in the region up until now were taking advantage of the cease-fire
to flee.
   ``They appear convinced that all-out clashes will break out
again,'' the spokesman said.
   The cease-fire, which went into effect at mid-morning, was
mediated by Maronite Catholic monk Bulos Naaman. He is a member of
a three-man independent mediation committee that sponsored at least
20 cease-fire calls during the three-month confrontation.
   Both Aoun and Geagea are members of the Maronite sect, the
largest Christian community. It has dominated political life, the
army command and the judiciary since Lebanon's independence from
France in 1943.
   The power struggle, the worst intra-Christian confrontation in
the civil war, has inflicted damage estimated at $1 billion. It has
forced 40 percent of the enclave's original population of 1 million
to seek refuge in safer areas in Lebanon and abroad.

   Divided over where their drive toward
political union is leading them, European Community leaders on
Saturday went back to basics: the Garden of Eden.
   At a 12-nation summit in the Irish capital, the Western European
leaders adopted a plan Saturday to achieve political union by
January 1993, without saying precisely what that meant.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who expressed
reservations about the plan, offered a long list of consequences
political union would not produce, such as abolishing Britain's
monarchy or getting rid of national parliaments.
   Jacques Delors, the Community's pro-union chief executive,
finally got fed up.
   ``If I set out to try to define what a man isn't, I don't know
whether Adam would have been created,'' he commented sardonically
at a post-summit news conference.
   Mrs. Thatcher, Europe's first woman prime minister, retorted:
``My reply is, God did it better on his second thoughts when he
created Eve.''

<TEXT>
   From the dust and desperation of a
dump occupied by squatters to the cool, white elegance of a rich
man's home, hope glimmered in the first days of Nicaragua's new
government.
   The optimism seemed almost improbable given the rocky start of
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's conservative administration and the
dire straits of this battered nation.
   The 60-year-old widow took office Wednesday, confronting deep
divisions in her United National Opposition coalition and thousands
of Contra rebels who refused to lay down their arms.
   Government ministries and agencies were in disarray, some barely
functioning and most under only nominal control of her coalition,
known as UNO. No one in UNO would say whether the outgoing
Sandinistas had left enough money in the treasury to meet Monday's
state payroll.
   In addition, the value of the national currency was slashed in
half Friday and the prices of staples such as rice, meat and oil
soared.
   But Nicaraguans voted for change _ for peace and a measure of
prosperity _ when they voted against the leftist Sandinistas in the
Feb. 25 elections and their expectations were not so quickly dashed.
   In the bustling Eastern Market, a bastion of free-enterprise
spirit, merchants shrugged off the latest plunge in the cordoba as
a necessary evil.
   ``They had to do something to stabilize things,'' said appliance
salesman Carlos Brinones. ``The value was unrealistic. If they can
just keep it stable for six months....''
   The cordoba has ridden a roller coaster for years, propelled by
inflation that hit a staggering 36,000 percent in 1988.
   ``Business is business,'' Candida Salgado, a Sandinista, said
from the shade of her clothing shop. ``It keeps going somehow; it
has its own magnetic force.''
   Mrs. Salgado believes the Sandinistas were good for Nicaragua
because they freed it from dictatorship. Now she says it is up to
Mrs. Chamorro to repair the damage inflicted by war with the
U.S.-backed Contras and years of U.S. economic sanctions.
   From market to mansions, Nicaraguans expect the new government
to reap millions in foreign aid and trade.
   ``Dona Violeta could open a new path, she could take us another
step forward,'' Mrs. Salgado said as she sat chatting with her
sister from Miami.
   Nellie Campos, 52, ventured back for a visit after 10 years of
exile because of Mrs. Chamorro's election. She is thinking of
staying for good.
   ``Business is always business,'' she said, echoing her sister.
``There are always possibilities.''
   For Mrs. Campos, the decision to return hinges on whether she
can reclaim her shop and house. They were taken over under a ``law
of absence'' that discouraged Sandinista critics from returning
from abroad.
   The property of thousands of others was confiscated outright.
For them, Mrs. Chamorro's election means a shot at recuperating
some of their losses.
   Mariano Valle, for example, lost 11 radio stations. He and other
pre-revolutionary broadcasters expect the new government to follow
through on its promise to review the confiscations.
   The confiscated stations became part of a government-run network
which the Sandinistas handed over to party faithful after losing
the election.
   ``It was supposedly `privatization,''' Valle scoffed during an
interview at his elegant home.
   The dismantling of the radio network was part of a post-election
rush aimed at ensuring that Sandinista loyalists wouldn't leave
power empty-handed.
   Thousands got homes occupied under the ``law of absence'' or
confiscated by the government. Car dealers say their inventories
were cleaned out for Sandinista ``going away'' gifts at government
expense.
   ``We have sold 60 cars since the election,'' said Idalia
Gonzalez, a saleswoman at the Hyundai dealership. ``We normally
sell six a month.''
   The greedy scramble sparked a land rush among the left-out poor,
who have been squatting on vacant lots since the election.
   Expectations are basic in the ruined economy.
   ``We hope the new government will help us get building
materials,'' Rosalina Garcia Calero, 52, said as fellow squatters
at the dump burned trash and marked off 30-foot-by-45-foot plots
with rocks, bits of debris and crooked sticks. ``The old one never
did.''
   Mrs. Garcia was one of more than 150 home-hungry people who have
occupied the dump in the past few days.
   ``Things aren't going to change overnight,'' said 45-year-old
Damian Gutierrez, who lives in one room with 14 relatives and sees
the dump land as his only hope for a home of his own. ``But they
will change.''

<TEXT>
   Representatives of Angola's Marxist
government and the UNITA rebels have held their first face-to-face
talks in 10 months, the Portuguese government disclosed Saturday.
   In talks Tuesday and Wednesday outside Lisbon, the two sides
fixed a secret calendar for future negotiations aimed at ending
their 15-year civil war in the former Portuguese colony, the
government said.
   The meetings in Evora, 90 miles east of Lisbon, were the first
direct contacts since a truce brokered by Zairean President Mobutu
Sese Seko last June 22 collapsed within weeks.
   The rebels, who control of large areas of central and southern
Angola, have been fighting to share power since shortly after
Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.
   Portugal's secretary of state for foreign affairs and
cooperation, Jose Manuel Durao Barroso, told a news conference the
two sides had signed a document, the contents of which were not
disclosed.
   The time and place of future meetings between the two sides
would not be revealed, he said.
   The Portuguese government was given a copy of the document, the
Portuguese news agency Lusa said. Confusion arose after the June
truce when the two sides announced differing interpretations of the
pact.
   Durao Barroso said the two sides still had many differences to
resolve.
   ``Frankly, their positions are still very far apart,'' he said.
``The path to peace is Angola is still a long one.''
   UNITA's foreign affairs secretary, Toni da Costa Fernandes, told
reporters: ``The peace process will succeed this time _ we are
satisfied.''
   Angolan Ambassador to Lisbon Rui Mingas also expressed
satisfaction with the results of the talks.
   UNITA's delegation in Evora was headed by Lisbon representative
Gen. Paulo Mango. Mingas declined to reveal the identities of the
government negotiators.
   Neither government nor rebel officials attending a separate
gathering in Lisbon would reveal details of the talks.
   Meanwhile, UNITA on Saturday claimed it had sabotaged
electricity supplies to the Angolan capital, Luanda. Rebel
statements and the state news agency ANGOP also reported bitter
clashes continuing this week in the field.
   UNITA is a Portuguese acronym for National Union for the Total
Indendence of Angola.

   AIDS researcher Robert Gallo is set to testify
Monday before a House panel investigating payments made by his
government laboratory to a firm with ties to a fellow National
Institutes of Health scientist, a congressional source said
Saturday.
   Gallo, a leading AIDS researcher, will appear before the House
Energy and Commerce Committee along with officials of the General
Accounting Office, which has conducted an 18-month investigation
into hundreds of thousands of dollars paid to the firm, Pan-Data
Systems.
   A committee source who spoke only on condition of anonymity said
there is evidence that shareholders in Pan-Data, a contracting firm
based in a Maryland suburb of Washington, have included a close NIH
associate of Gallo, Indian-born research scientist Syed Zaki
Salhuddin, and his wife, Firoza.
   Published reports of ties to the company on the part of the
Salhuddins first appeared last year and Gallo was quoted at the
time in The Washington Post as saying he did not know of any
relationship until 1988.
   The Chicago Tribune in its Sunday editions said the
congressional inquiry has found evidence that rare and valuable
viruses, including the one that causes AIDS, have found there way
from Gallo's laboratory and been sold to universities, private
companies and other government agencies.
   Some numbered vials of virus that had belonged to the laboratory
appear to have been sold, but the committee is still attempting to
establish conclusively who did the selling and under what
circumstances, according to the committee source.
   Syed Zaki Salhuddin's brother, S.M. Salhuddin, said the
researcher was in Belgium attending a scientific conference.
   Mrs. Salhuddin, reached by telephone Saturday, declined to say
whether she was a part owner of the contracting firm.
   The committee source said evidence that the Salhuddins have been
shareholders in the company include Small Business Administration
records. The source said committee investigators and the General
Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, had found
payments of as much as $800,000 a year to Pan-Data by Gallo's
laboratory.
   Records show the firm was paid for a variety of reasons, ranging
from research assistance to providing office supplies to the
laboratory, according to the committee source.
   Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell, D-Mich., is
seeking to determine why NIH did not inquire more deeply into the
relationship between the laboratory and Pan-Data, the source said.
   Gallo has co-authored more than 60 scientific articles with
Salhuddin and has described him as ``the world's leading researcher
in the area of blood cell cultures.''

   The Hubble Space Telescope's
electronic system was back in operation Saturday, but despite
daylong efforts its high-speed antennas remained down and its
science instruments on hold.
   Meanwhile, Discovery's five astronauts prepared to land at 9:49
a.m. EDT Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., amid some
concern that high wind might force postponement the landing until
Monday or Tuesday. Air Force forecasters said winds at the desert
base were expected to be close to the limit for a safe shuttle
landing Sunday.
   ``It's time to pack up our camping gear and get ready to come
home,'' said flight director Wayne Hale.
   Early Saturday, the $1.5 billion telescope was sent ``health and
safety'' instructions to operate on its own. A day earlier, the
electronic instruments had automatically shut down when they sensed
trouble with one of two high-gain antennas, and when opening the
lens cover made the telescope move.
   The high-gain antennas send data back to Earth at high speed.
   ``We are continuing to remain in good communication with the
telescope,'' said Dave Drachlis of the Goddard Space Flight Center
in Greenbelt, Md. He said systems other than the antenna were
running properly.
   Ground controllers at Goddard tried moving the good high-gain
antenna, but noticed the other antenna also was turning.
   ``They ... basically stopped the process and scratched their
heads for a bit,'' Drachlis said.
   Jean Olivier, a deputy project manager for Hubble, said various
options are being considered to aim the good antenna without moving
the bad one. If computer programs must be adapted to get data from
just one antenna, ``it will be somewhat of a hit.''
   Neither Olivier nor Mike Harrington, director of orbital
verification, ventured to say how much that might affect scientific
returns.
   The problems with the antennas have delayed calibration tests
that ground controllers must conduct on the telescopes five
scientific instruments.
   Drachlis said delaying those tests was not a major problem.
   The overnight commands put the instruments on hold, the state in
which they will spend much of their time awaiting signals to wake
up and study the heavens.
   Engineers can send commands to the telescope via its secondary
low-gain antennas. But that system, which is considerably slower,
isn't useful for scientific data.
   In a news conference from Discovery, astronaut Bruce McCandless
said he's not surprised ``a very complex system like this may have
a few minor bugs to be worked out.''
   But neither the bugs nor the complexity seemed to have dampened
the astronauts' enthusiasm.
   ``It's hard to go somewhere and find someone who has never heard
of the Hubble Space Telescope,'' said pilot Charles Bolden. ``It
makes little kids' eyes light up. It makes little kids want to
learn how to add and subtract and study science.
   ``And that's extremely gratifying to know that you're part of a
mission that seems to have excited the nation as well as the world
about something.''
   The astronauts made some last-minute observations of Earth,
about 380 miles below. The record-high shuttle altitude was needed
to put the telescope in its proper orbit far above Earth's
distorting atmosphere.
   ``From what we've seen so far, compared to some of our previous
flights ... it looks a little bit better than we remember, maybe a
little less smoke in some places,'' said Discovery commander Loren
J. Shriver.
   NASA expects to release its first test image from the telescope
late this week at the earliest, later than planned because of the
antenna problems. Scientific data will follow in a month or two.
   Astronomers expect to study stars and galaxies so distant their
light has been traveling to Earth for 14 billion years. The
universe is believed to have been created about 15 billion years
ago.

   Federal regulators cleaning up bankrupt
savings and loans are finding they've inherited another unexpected
and expensive mess: real estate contaminated by hazardous waste.
   Officials at the Resolution Trust Corp., which has taken over
more than 400 insolvent S&amp;Ls, say some of the failed financial
institutions had foreclosed on polluted property.
   Recent court rulings have found that financial institutions are
potentially liable for cleaning up such property under the 1980
Superfund law. By extension, that could put the RTC on the hook.
   The RTC doesn't know yet how many of its more than 30,000 real
estate parcels are contaminated, but agency spokesman Stephen J.
Katsanos says, ``I'm confident there are sites in our inventory
that ... need some cleanup.''
   The RTC, already faced with an estimated $325 billion price tag
for its S&amp;L bailout, thinks the Environmental Protection Agency's
Superfund should foot the bill on any failed S&amp;L property cleanups.
   ``The taxpayer is going to be paying for it one way or another
... but if it comes out of the RTC then it reduces the amount of
money available to protect deposits,'' Katsanos said.
   A bigger problem than the actual cleanup cost is the cloud of
uncertainty cast over the RTC's portfolio.
   Pollution problems aside, the agency has had great difficulty
selling S&amp;L assets when it turns over a failed institution to a new
owner, and the potential for an environmental expense is just one
more risk discouraging the purchase of assets in large blocks.
   Not only do buyers have to worry about evaluating real estate
owned by an S&amp;L, they have to worry about environmental problems at
properties pledged as collateral for loans that may later turn sour.
   Other agencies, including the Small Business Administration and
the Farmers Home Administration, also are wrestling with polluted
properties.
   Sally Narey, SBA general counsel, estimated the agency has wound
up with about 150 cases of contamination _ and there could be more.
   Not only does the SBA face a possible problem when it forecloses
on a delinquent loan it has guaranteed, it could face liability
from other programs in which it provides operating advice to
businesses.
   ``We just don't know what's out there that we haven't uncovered
yet,'' she said.
   A bank or S&amp;L, as private enterprises, can simply steer clear of
making loans to high-risk businesses, but the SBA, as a government
agency, is caught in the middle.
   ``It's a difficult situation. Our mission is to make loans to
small businesses that can't get loans elsewhere,'' Narey said.
   A variety of legislation introduced in Congress aims to address
the problem both for the agencies and for financial institutions.
Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, the senior Republican on the Senate Banking
Committee, would provide immunity to federal banking agencies as
well as lenders for environmental problems they only inherited, not
created.
   ``My sense is this is a much bigger problem than a lot of people
think it is. There are more examples all the time,'' Garn said.
   Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass., has offered a bill applying only to
government agencies, while earlier this month Rep. John J. LaFalce,
D-N.Y., chairman of the House Small Business Committee, introduced
legislation that would exempt only lenders.
   Another proposal by Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., would exempt
lenders only if they paid for an environmental audit to determine
before taking over a property if it is contaminated.
   The EPA and private environmental groups are opposing the bills
as unnecessary. The Superfund law already provides some protection
to lenders who only have a security interest in a property and no
role in its management.
   The problem, from banks' perspective, is that they often in
effect become managers of a property after they foreclose. Even
before foreclosure, a lender will sometimes participate in
management in an effort to steer a borrower out of trouble.
   EPA enforcement attorney Glenn Unterberger said cases of
potential lender liability vary so widely that it is better to let
the courts judge each on the facts rather than trying to write a
blanket rule to cover all situations.
   Moreover, he added, ``EPA is making some reasoned decisions
about when it's reasonable to pursue lending institutions.''
   Attorney Donald Strait of the Natural Resources Defense Council
said he fears providing greater protection for lenders could result
in windfall profits at the taxpayers' expense.
   ``All of a sudden, a bank which took over a site which was worth
very little would have a much more valuable site because it was
cleaned up with taxpayers' money. I don't think banks should get
that windfall,'' Strait said.
   Sponsors of the bills say they are willing to write them to
prevent such profit. And they argue that without the legislation
businesses face a credit crunch, particularly high-risk businesses
such as gasoline stations and dry cleaners.
   Forcing banks to pay for environmental studies before they
accept property as collateral is no solution either, said Thomas
Greco of the American Bankers Association.
   ``The lowest level of investigation will probably cost $2,000 or
$3,000. These things can rapidly escalate to $10,000, $20,000 or
$25,000, and even then there's no assurance the bank will be
protected,'' Greco said.

   Federal agents have arrested a captain
and two crew members for allegedly violating federal law after they
were caught with an endangered Kemp's ridley sea turtle.
   The turtle was tethered to the men's boat when the Coast Guard
made a routine inspection in the Gulf of Mexico, authorities said.
   Inspectors also caught the three men trawling for shrimp on
Tuesday with no turtle excluder devices attached to their nets, the
Coast Guard said.
   The fishermen were arrested Friday at a dock in the Clear Lake
area, officials said.
   Hung Van Tran, 37, master of the shrimp boat; Capt. Paul Le; and
crewmen Quang Duc Nguyen, 34, and Binh Van Nguyen, 33, are charged
with illegal possession of a sea turtle and aiding and abetting in
the illegal possession of a sea turtle, violations of the federal
Endangered Species Act.
   Each carries a penalty of up to a year in prison and a $100,000
fine.
   Investigators said charges of failure to use excluder devices
may be filed next week against the three. They were released on
their own recognizance.
   Shrimpers last fall protested the requirement they use the
devices, saying up to 30 percent of their catch was lost because of
the devices. Since the law went into effect, several shrimpers have
been fined for not using them.

<HEAD>Audit Find Seniors Program Riddled With Costly Mismanagement</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Subs 2nd graf, ``On at least xxx to show that this was an

<TEXT>
   One-third of the projects in a $1.6 billion
elderly housing program are in or near financial ruin, with bloated
loans and lousy management to blame, according to auditors who say
the government will have little choice but to foot the bill.
   On at least two occasions, prominent Republican political
consultants swayed senior Department of Housing and Urban
Development officials to overrule field deputies and approve loans
for projects in the troubled Retirement Service Center program, the
internal audit says.
   The study details anew favoritism and myriad management problems
at HUD during the Reagan administration tenure of Secretary Samuel
R. Pierce Jr.
   It also suggests the pricetag for that mismanagement is rising,
with no end in sight, as millions of dollars in loans insured by
the government go sour.
   ``There is a high probability that as more recently approved
(retirement centers) proceed through their processing stages,
additional projects will become troubled or go into default,'' the
auditors concluded in the new report, obtained by The Associated
Press through the Freedom of Information Act.
   And the money lost and wasted in many cases went to projects
that catered not to low- and moderate-income people but for
developments featuring fountain-filled lobbies, plush dining rooms,
swimming pools _ and rents in excess of $2,000 a month.
   It would take an income of at least $25,000 a year to live in
many of the centers, while the median annual income for the over-65
population is roughly $15,000.
   As in other HUD programs in which private lenders were allowed
to underwrite HUD-insured mortgages, the audit found lenders were
too generous in their appraisals and thus approved excessive
mortgages.
   Such bloated loans bring lenders higher fees. They also result
in higher rents because of the cash flow needed to pay the
mortgage, and the high rents in turn contribute to the unusually
high vacancy rate in such projects, the auditors said, ultimately
causing cash crunches that trigger defaults.
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp suspended the program last July after a
limited audit in the Chicago area first touched on its problems,
finding bad or shaky loans totaling $119 million.
   Kemp has yet to decide whether to revive the program; the
auditors said it would need a total overhaul and cited ``ample
justification'' to kill it.
   In the report's nationwide review of the program, auditors said
62 of 190 Retirement Service Centers _ or nearly 33 percent _
either had defaulted or were financially troubled. The mortgages
for the 62 facilities total $599 million _ nearly 40 percent of the
$1.6 billion spent on the program.
   HUD is liable for at least 85 percent and in some cases 100
percent of the loans should they default.
   The $599 million figure was from loan data through last October.
Preliminary results of a follow-up review that includes more recent
data paint an even bleaker picture, a HUD official said Friday. The
auditors told Kemp he needs to develop a program to sell the
centers that are coming under HUD's control because of defaults.
   The report said that in at least 17 cases HUD field offices and
the private lenders ignored reports in which HUD economists said
local housing markets would not sustain the projects. Fifteen of
those projects are now in default or severe financial trouble.
   The auditors also questioned 10 cases in which officials at HUD
headquarters overruled field office rejections of project
proposals. In most cases, no documentation could be found to
support the reversals, the report said.
   At least two of those involved political favoritism, the audit
said.
   In one case, the developer of a project rejected by HUD
officials in San Francisco because of a saturated market paid
$30,000 to GOP consultant Lou Kitchin, who worked for both the
Reagan and Bush presidential campaigns.
   Kitchin met with senior HUD officials in Washington, including
top Pierce deputy Deborah Gore Dean, and won approval for the $13.2
million project. That project, the Woodcrest Retirement Service
Center in Escondido, is surviving because of the default of a
nearby HUD-insured center, the audit said.
   In the second case, Robert Weinberger, a Republican consultant
and the nephew of former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger,
persuaded HUD headquarters officials to overrule local officials
and approve a $3.7 million HUD-insured mortgage for the Rosewood
Estate development in Roseville, Minn.
   The audit refers to the consultants but does not name them. But
the role of Kitchin and Weinberger in the projects surfaced last
year during investigations of influence-peddling at the agency.
   Many of the management shortfalls cited by the auditors included
seemingly routine tasks. The report said HUD failed to require
status reports from the private lenders, had few written guidelines
for program management, did not coordinate headquarters decisions
with appropriate field offices and never bothered to assess the
potential risks of the program or whether it would result in
affordable housing.

   A deranged woman who hid the knife in a bouquet of flowers
stabbed the 46-year-old leader during a campaign rally Wednesday in
Cologne.
   The woman detained after the stabbing, 42-year-old Adelheid
Streidel, told police she tried to kill Lafontaine to get into the

   Lafontaine initially was in critical condition due to massive
blood loss. By Saturday he had recovered sufficiently to be moved
from intensive care to a regular ward at the University Clinic in
Cologne, Lafontaine spokeswoman Maria Zimmermann said.
   Lafontaine, a member of the Social Democrats and governor of
Saarland state, is Chancellor Helmut Kohl's main rival in the Dec.
2 elections.

   A light plane carrying a Sweet Adelines
women's singing quartet crashed into the side of a snow-covered
mountain, apparently killing all six people aboard, authorities
said Saturday.
   A TV news helicopter crew spotted the wreckage in the Rocky
Mountains Saturday morning, about 15 miles northeast of Aspen in
Pitkin County, said a Lake County Sheriff's Department dispatcher
who refused to give her name. There apparently were no survivors of
the Friday crash, she said.
   Searchers hampered by winter weather found three bodies and
managed to flag their locations before an avalanche drove crews
from the mountain for the day, the dispatcher said.
   Deputy Calvin Dawe said the wreckage was found in an
avalanche-prone area. The single-engine Piper Cherokee had left
Salt Lake City about 6 a.m. Friday, en route to Colorado Springs,
and was reported overdue about noon.
   Aboard were four women and two men, including the pilot.
   They were en route to a regional competition of the Sweet
Adelines organization, an international group that promotes
barbershop-quartet-style, four-part-harmony singing for women.
Fourteen choruses from six Western states were scheduled to
complete.
   Dr. Jayne Clark, leader of the Mountain Jubilee Chorus of Salt
Lake City, confirmed that a Sweet Adelines quartet was aboard the
plane that vanished but declined to release their names.
   The search was launched Friday after a satellite and airplanes
picked up signals from an emergency locator transmitter apparently
high in the Rocky Mountains between Aspen and Leadville, said
Michael Kendrick, a spokesman for the Pitkin County sheriff's
office.
   The search was called off at midnight and resumed after sunrise,
with a foot of fresh snow covering the target area. Temperatures
were in the low 30s, said John Yudnich, a sheriff's department
dispatcher.
   Search conditions _ snow in the upper elevations to rain lower
down _ were ``crummy to mediocre,'' Kendrick said. Ground crews
equipped with a tracked snow plow were unable to find anything.
   While contest organizers announced the plane was missing Friday
night, Utah singers were ushered into the basement to pray.
   Sweet Adelines is an international non-profit organization of
women based in Tulsa, Okla. It was founded in 1947 to uphold the
tradition of barbershop-style, four-part harmony singing. Sweet
Adelines has more than 34,000 members in 10 nations.

   Israel lowered flags to half staff, lit torches
and paid silent tribute Saturday to those who have fallen in battle
for the Jewish state.
   A siren's minute-long wail halted traffic Saturday night.
Pedestrians and motorists observed a moment of silence, standing at
attention to remember Israeli soldiers who fell in five wars with
Arab neighbors.
   Once the final echoes of the siren faded, President Chaim Herzog
lit a torch at the Western Wall in the Old City, officially
starting the mourning period, which ends Tuesday in this nation of
4.4 million people.
   The military counts 16,951 dead in the five wars and in
guerrilla attacks, including 785 in the 1967 Middle East War when
Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   In Israel's last war, the 1982 invasion of Lebanon and
three-year occupation, 1,183 soldiers lost their lives.
   In the Gaza Strip, the army imposed a curfew from late Saturday
night until Tuesday morning, confining more that 700,000
Palestinians to their homes to prevent possible violence.
   In Israel, bars, restaurants and theaters were closed for the
observances. As the sun set, television broadcast stories of slain
soldiers and the radio played sad traditional folk songs.
   At the Western Wall, the holiest site in Judaism, uniformed
soldiers saluted as Herzog took his place. The president bowed his
head while a trumpet played.
   ``We the living, promise you, the victim of hatred between
brothers, we promise that we will not rest until this country
deserves your memory,'' he said.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who is also acting as defense
minister, wrote a letter to bereaved families. Almost 20,000
Israelis have lost a family member in battle.
   ``Those who have fallen order us to go forward,'' Shamir said.
``We must make every effort towards peace while at the same time
safeguarding our own interests and survival.''
   A two-minute siren will mark the start of memorial services in
40 military ceremonies Sunday.
   The mourning period ends Tuesday with a torch-lighting ceremony
at the Mount Herzl cemetery in Jerusalem, where many soldiers and
pioneers are buried. The ceremony signals the start of Independence
Day celebrations.

   Basking in the adulation of anti-communist exiles,
former President Reagan on Saturday called for free elections and
democratic reforms in Cuba in a speech Fidel Castro could have
heard in his living room.
   ``Test yourself in a vote, Mr. Castro. Let the voices of the
Cuban people be heard,'' Reagan said in an address broadcast live
to Cuba on the U.S.-funded Radio Marti network.
   ``In the sanctity of the secret polling both, the voice of
freedom triumphs,'' he added.
   Reagan's 30-minute speech to a predominantly Cuban audience of
about 10,000 in Miami's Orange Bowl capped a 3{-hour rally attended
by dozens of other officials. Among them were Cuban-born U.S. Rep.
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., and President Bush's son Jeb.
   Many Cuban leaders credit Reagan with beginning a pro-democracy
avalanche that may eventually bury Castro and allow the return of
thousands of exiles.
   ``I believe we will soon be singing to liberty and independence
in Cuba,'' said Jorge Mas Canosa, chairman of the Cuban American
National Foundation and an early supporter of the 5-year-old Radio
Marti program.
   Canosa said the rally and speech was the first event broadcast
live to Cuba via Radio Marti.
   Foundation spokeswoman Marilyn Kalusin said Reagan spoke free of
charge.
   Reagan praised both Radio Marti and the new TV Marti network as
instrumental in building grassroots opposition to Castro.
   ``This is an authentic breakthrough in U.S. information programs
because it is television that hold such promise and potential: The
power of pictures, the visual images of freedom that are sweeping
the world,'' said Reagan.
   ``They will see the Berlin Wall coming down, the last speech of
Romania's dictator, the Soviet citizens massing by the thousands in
front of the Kremlin in support of broader democracy in the Soviet
Union.''
   The Cuban government has jammed the TV Marti signal since its
first broadcast March 27. Earlier this month, Radio Marti was also
jammed for first time since it went on the air. Both the radio and
television stations are named after 19th century Cuban independence
hero Jose Marti.
   ``We can understand why Fidel Castro is so hysterical in his
denunications of TV Marti,'' said Reagan, who wore a traditional
Cuban guayabera, an open-collared shirt. ``What is he afraid of? He
is afraid of the truth.''
   The crowd interrupted Reagan several times with applause, and
waved Cuban flags.
   Cuban and U.S. flags were marched into the stadium by the
Brigade 2506, a group of Cuban exiles who launched the unsuccessful
Bay of Pigs invasion of their homeland in 1961.
   ``I look forward to the day that this gathering will be held in
free Cuba and I know that day will come, and soon,'' said Reagan.
   He also called on the Soviet Union to cut off its massive aid to
Cuba.
   ``I hope it won't be too much longer before the Soviet Union
joins Eastern Europe in redefining its relationship with Cuba,'' he
said. ``Maintaining their economic umbilical cord to Castro _ the
world's most vehement critic of Soviet-style reforms _ is
anachronistic behavior in today's world.''

<HEAD>Bomb Explodes, Two Others Found After IRA Terror Campaign Reported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>

   A bomb exploded and two others
were found Saturday after authorities warned of a heightened IRA
terror campaign.
   No injuries were reported in the bombing, which came a day after
a booby-trapped car exploded and killed a building contractor
threatened by the Irish Republican Army.
   Security patrols and road blocks have been increased in Belfast
and across the province since police headquarters warned Thursday
night that intelligence reports indicated the IRA was planning a
new offensive.
   The IRA is waging a campaign to drive the British out of the
province and unite it with the Irish Republic.
   A bomb attached to a lamppost in Lisburn, 10 miles south of
Belfast, exploded while police and troops evacuated the area
following a warning that a 200-pound bomb had been left there. One
woman was treated for shock.
   Later, army bomb disposal experts defused a bomb attached to a
gas cylinder in the back of a car in the area.
   Patrols stopped an airport bus in Templepatrick, Country Antrim,
seized a bomb and arrested an unidentified woman, the Royal Ulster
Constabulary said. The bus was en route from central Belfast to
Aldergrove Airport.
   A police spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
practice, would give no further details and would not say what
prompted patrols to stop the bus.
   The airport is 15 miles west of Belfast, and Templepatrick is
five miles from the airport.
   On the outskirts of Strabane, 60 miles northwest of Belfast, two
mortars were fired at the permanent border security post on the
route to Lifford in County Donegal.
   Only one of the mortars, fired from the back of a van parked in
a filling station, exploded. Damage to the heavily fortified post
was not reported to be serious. None of the soldiers on duty was
injured but an 18-year-old woman was taken to a hospital suffering
from shock.
   There were no immediate claims of responsibility.
   On Friday, a booby-trap bomb killed builder Kenneth Graham as he
drove to work in Kilkeel, County Down. A similar bomb exploded
prematurely under a car in County Londonderry and a third was
defused in County Tyrone, police said.
   The IRA had warned Graham's company to stop construction work at
police and military installations in the province, according to
Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency.
   Graham was the 20th person to die in political and sectarian
violence in the province this year.

<HEAD>Thatcher Government Defends New Tax But Said To Be Considering
Review</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A member of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Cabinet on Saturday defended the unpopular tax that set off a riot
last month, but reports said the government was thinking about
amending it.
   The local per capita tax, which went into effect April 1 and
replaced a property tax, seriously undermined support for Mrs.
Thatcher's Conservative Party.
   The Conservatives are expected to fare badly in local council
elections across the country Thursday because of hostility toward
the tax.
   The Times of London, which often backs the Conservatives, quoted
unidentified sources at the prime minister's office as saying
legislation to amend the new tax could be introduced later this
year.
   On Saturday, however, Trade Secretary Nicholas Ridley defended
the tax, whose revenues are to help fund local councils' spending.
   Ridley's comments were described by The Sunday Correspondent
newspaper as an indication of disarray in the Thatcher government
over ``the attempt to repackage the poll tax.''
   The government calls the tax a community charge. But the
opposition socialist Labor Party and others have dubbed it the poll
tax after a similar per capita tax that sparked a peasants' revolt
in 1381.
   Under the measure, local services are paid for not by a property
tax as in the past but by a per capita tax on everyone over 18. The
rate is set by each local district and varies widely.
   Ridley said if the Labor Party took power, ``they would keep the
charge because they would have to face up to the reality of the
need to restrain local government spending in the interests of
overall economic management.''
   Critics, however, say the new tax is unfair because unlike
income tax it takes no account of an individual's ability to pay
and poorer people must pay the same as wealthier people. Low-income
families and some other groups can get rebates of up to 80 percent
under the new system.
   Violence broke out at anti-tax demonstrations around the country
last month. A demonstration by 40,000 people in London on March 31
turned into a six-hour riot with 86 civilians and 374 police
injured and 339 people arrested.
   Mrs. Thatcher came to power in 1979 and is now in her third
term. The next general election is due by mid-1992.

Plains, and the South continued to get pelted with thunderstorms
that brought high winds and hail.
   Watches for tornadoes and severe thunderstorms were posted for
much of the South Saturday evening.
   Thunderstorms at Lenox, Ala., produced hail a half-inch in
diameter, and gusty winds knocked down a few trees. Hail also fell
near Jonesboro, Ga., and at Fayetteville, Ga.
   Winds gusted to 68 mph and three-quarter-inch diameter hail fell
at Columbus, Ga.
   Snow resulted in the closing of several roads inside Yellowstone
National Park.
   Three inches of snow covered the airport at Kalispell, Mont.,
and 4 to 6 inches of snow were reported north of Jackson, Wyo.
Overnight snowfall ranged from 2 to 6 inches in eastern North

Panhandle, northern Utah and northeast Nevada, from south-central
Wyoming to north-central Wyoming, and along the Oregon coast.
   Meanwhile, the death toll from three days of storms and flooding
in Texas last week rose to six, with the discovery of two victims.
The bodies of two men whose was washed off a road near Sunray in

   About 8,000 people marched in central London
Saturday to protest the use of animals in laboratory experiments.
   Police were out in force and a helicopter hovered overhead. But
the march was peaceful, and no arrests were reported.
   It was the first major march and rally in central London since a
demonstration against a new tax on March 31 escalated into a riot.
   The protesters passed the Houses of Parliament to attend a rally
at Central Hall. Speakers included singer Lynsey de Paul,
vice-president of the National Anti-Vivisection Society, and Green
Party spokesman David Icke.
   ``The legal abuse of animals through vivisection and factory
farms is done with the same sort of distorted values that allow
people to sleep in cardboard boxes,'' said Icke.

<HEAD>Jury: Ex-Husband Gets 25 Percent of $31.5 Million Jackpot</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man who sued his ex-wife for half of her
$31.5 million Florida Lotto jackpot is entitled to 25 percent of
her winnings for his role in buying the ticket, a jury decided
Saturday.
   Lewis Snipes, a mechanic who claimed he helped pick the six
winning numbers and had agreed to share the winnings before
purchasing the ticket, rejected his former wife's offer of $1
million before filing the suit.
   One fourth of $31.5 million works out to roughly $7,875,000.
   The jury deliberated for 2{ hours before ruling that while Mary
Ellen Snipes was the true owner of the ticket. Jurors also found
that the couple had arranged to share the winnings, and that Snipes
was entitled to a one-fourth share.
   Attorneys for Mrs. Snipes vowed to appeal and said lawyers for
both sides would have to meet to determine the exact cash amount.
   Snipes, 55, of Indiantown, said he and Mrs. Snipes, 54, had a
pool. He would buy 25 to 30 tickets a week and she would buy about
10 because she made less money. He said they agreed to share any
winnings.
   The couple's two-year marriage ended in 1982, but Snipes kept in
touch and occasionally paid part of his ex-wife's rent, mowed her
lawn and repaired her car.
   Snipes still professes his love for his ex-wife, and she
concedes it was an off-again, on-again love affair _ until the Oct.
22, 1988, Lotto drawing triggered the lawsuit.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev expressed
continuing support for Arab causes during a meeting Saturday with
Syrian President Hafez Assad, the Soviet news agency Tass reported.
   In their three-hour meeting, the two leaders discussed Lebanon,
the prospects for peace in the Middle East and the emigration of
Soviet Jews to Israel, Tass said.
   Soviet policy of ``principled solidarity'' with Arab liberation
movements remains unchanged, Gorbachev was quoted as saying.
   Assad arrived in Moscow Friday for a two-day visit.
   The Soviet Union has traditionally been Syria's main backer, but
that has been changing as Moscow pursues detente and reforms at
home, and Syria has been trying to cultivate better ties with the
West.
   The loss of Soviet support was seen as a key reason for Syria's
role in the freeing of U.S. hostage Robert Polhill after 39 months
in captivity in Lebanon.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Daniel K. Akaka of Hawaii was
appointed Saturday to fill the U.S. Senate seat of Sen. Spark
Matsunaga, who died April 15.
   Hawaii Gov. John Waihee signed a proclamation naming his fellow
Democrat to the post effective May 16.
   Akaka will serve until January, when the winner of special
elections held during the regular primary and general elections
will be seated to serve the remaining four years of Matsunaga's
six-year term.
   ``I am honored to serve in the United States Senate. I am
honored to fill the seat vacated by our beloved Senator
Matsunaga,'' Akaka said. ``I will continue his work of peace and
justice.''
   Matsunaga, a Democrat, was elected to the Senate in 1976 after
serving 14 years in the U.S. House. He died of complications of
prostate cancer.
   Matsunaga was known for his work on a bill ordering reparations
payments and an apology to Japanese-Americans imprisoned during
World War II. He also campaigned to establish the U.S. Peace
Institute in Washington, D.C. which awards grants to university
projects.
   Akaka, 65, is a former schoolteacher and school administrator
who has served in the House since 1976. He announced last week that
he would enter the race to fill Matsunaga's full term.
   Hawaii's other member of Congress, Republican U.S. Rep. Patricia
Saiki, has said she is interested in running.
   Akaka's 2nd Congressional District seat will be filled in a
special election to be held in conjunction with Hawaii's primary
election Sept. 22.
   Simultaneously, there will be the regular election for the U.S.
House seat, meaning the winner of the special election would serve
until January, when the winner of the regular election would take
office.
   Waihee, a Democrat, called Akaka ``an individual of proven
experience in the United States Congress.''
   With Akaka in Waihee's office for the for the announcement and
proclamation signing was U.S. Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii.
   ``With his experience, his know-how and his established
integrity in the United States Congress, he will be a great asset
for Hawaii,'' Inouye said.

<DATELINE>ST. REGIS INDIAN RESERVATION, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State police warned
gamblers to stay away Saturday night as Indian casinos reopened for
the first time since gambling opponents blockaded this strife-torn
Mohawk reservation in March.
   Fearing further violence after nearly a week of nightly gunfire
and vandalism, more than 500 women, children and elderly people
fled Friday from the Canadian side of the St. Regis Mohawk
Reservation. The reservation, home to some 14,000, straddles the
U.S.-Canada border.
   The reservation was quiet Friday and Saturday, authorities said.
   Authorities and Mohawks had feared renewed violence when workers
returned home for the weekend and casinos reopened. Although some
casinos were open, many of their employees stayed home and the
usual busloads of customers were expected to be absent Saturday
night.
   State police put up informational roadblocks at entrances to the
Mohawk land, warning people to stay off the reservation because of
violence. Customs agents along the border searched cars for weapons.
   Residents are divided over casinos and bingo halls on the
American side of the reservation.
   The feud also touches on the question of Indian sovereignty _
whether state and federal officials have the authority to intervene
in a dispute between Indian factions.
   In late March, gambling opponents blockaded roads leading to the
reservation. Pro-gambling Mohawks tore down the blockades in a
fierce fight Tuesday night, and for several nights there were
violent confrontations between the factions.
   Buildings on the reservation are spray-painted with pro- and
anti-gambling slogans, and areas where fighting has occurred are
littered with broken glass, burnt car parts and spent shells.
   Mike Mitchell, chief of the Canadian Mohawk Council, said he
ordered the evacuation because residents were in danger. Evacuees
were housed in dormitory rooms at a training center for air traffic
controllers in Cornwall, Ontario.
   Evacuees decided to return home Monday if they don't get a
commitment of support from the American or Canadian governments,
Mitchell said.
   He said he believed both sides in the gambling dispute should
surrender their arms, but he doesn't think that will happen
voluntarily.
   ``If no outside government gives us assistance putting those
weapons away, we're going to have to do it ourselves,'' he said.
   Mohawk Chief Harold Tarbell, a gambling opponent, has called on
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo to send in the National Guard to restore
order.
   Cuomo said Saturday that ``so far there is no necessity for
military involvement.'' He said some Mohawks were exaggerating the
seriousness of the violence ``to advance their own political
cause.''
   One Mohawk chief, David Jacobs, agreed that some Indians were
making the violence sound worse than it was.
   ``It is my profound hope that Chief Tarbell's alarmist calls for
intervention do not result in the revival of unrest on the
reservation,'' said Jacobs, a gambling supporter.

<HEAD>Lawsuit Contends USS Stark Defense System Was Faulty</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal lawsuit blames 11 defense
contractors for the deaths of 37 sailors aboard the USS Stark in
the Persian Gulf three years ago, accusing them of failing to
properly test a missile defense system.
   Twenty-two relatives of the sailors who were killed in the May
17, 1987, Iraqui attack on the U.S. Navy frigate and two survivors
of the attack filed a lawsuit in federal court Thursday.
   The suit seeks unspecified actual and punitive damages.
   Twenty-one sailors were injured and 37 died when an Iraqi
warplane fired two French-made Exocet missiles on the
guided-missile frigate. The Stark was on routine patrol in
international waters 85 miles northeast of Bahrain during the
Iran-Iraq war.
   The lawsuit contends the companies and the university failed to
conduct reliability tests on the vessel's Phalanx and Aegis
anti-missile defense systems. That negligence is to blame for the
sailors' deaths, the suit alleges.
   The suit accuses General Dynamics of fraud by misrepresenting
its product test results and hiding the actual results.
   General Dynamics, one of the nation's largest defense
contractors, also failed to warn the sailors about the dangers of
the ship's defense system, the suit alleges.
   Also named as defendants are Raytheon Co., FMC Corp., Hughes
Aircraft Corp., Unisys Corp., Martin Marietta Corp., General
Electric Co., RCA Government Systems Division, Honeywell Inc., and
Computer Sciences Corp. Also named is Johns Hopkins University.
   A spokesman in General Dynamics' Fort Worth office failed to
return phone calls. Jim Furlong, spokesman for Computer Sciences
Corp., based in El Segundo, Calif., said the firm is unaware of the
suit. A spokesman for Honeywell Inc. in Minneapolis did not return
phone calls.
   Iraqi officials said after the attack that the plane's crew
mistook the ship for an Iranian target. The Stark did not return
fire.

<DATELINE>CIUDAD ACUNA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a handful of cities on the
Mexican border, American men still throng to the brothels of ``boys
towns,'' legal prostitution zones little changed by fears of sexual
disease or campaigns for more wholesome tourism.
   At least five Mexican border cities have flourishing boys towns,
and though some have been moved away from central tourist
districts, they remain popular attractions for businessmen, hunters
and teen-agers.
   They're accepted with little controversy, although Texas'
Republican gubernatorial candidate, Clayton Williams, drew heat
after admitting recently that he frequented border brothels during
his college years more than 30 years ago because they were the only
place to get ``serviced.''
   Visiting the prostitutes, Williams said, was just ``part of
growing up in West Texas.''
   On a Thursday night in Acuna, across the border from the Texas
town of Del Rio, about 50 American men mingled with Mexican women
at the Hunters Saloon beneath a glittering banner that proclaims in
English: ``Welcome Hunters.''
   While nude dancers perform on stage, prostitutes lead customers
toward the bar's back rooms.
   ``We're just here to check it out,'' said one Texas man, gazing
around the bar. ``This is really mild compared to a lot of places.''
   Outside along the dusty streets of boys town _ also known as La
Zona de Tolerancia or Zone of Tolerance _ scattered groups of men
from nearby Air Force installations, teen-agers and other Americans
wander to bars like the Rio Club and La Camelia.
   The half-dozen bars, most only a few years old and
well-appointed, are clustered on a small hill along a gravel road
south of town. Smaller and older brothels cater to Mexican clients.
   A Del Rio businessman in his 40s who has frequented the brothels
for more than 20 years says there's little fear of AIDS or other
sexual diseases.
   ``I believe there are more problems with diseases ... in the big
cities,'' said the man, who declined to be identified. ``These
ladies go to medical checkups. Every week a doctor checks them.''
   Dr. Herbert H. Ortega of El Paso, executive director of the
U.S.-Mexico Border Health Association, said AIDS is ``almost
nonexistent'' among the prostitutes. He credits education efforts
by the association and other groups, such as the Pan-American
Health Organization that he leads.
   Acuna health officials last week cited some prostitutes for not
having health certificates and checked them for disease.
   Men visiting boys towns say many prostitutes require condoms.
Some say the threat of disease limits them to looking.
   ``It's too much of a chance, going home with something you don't
want,'' said a Brownwood, Texas, man who made a side trip to Acuna
from a seminar for undercover narcotics agents in Del Rio. The
agent, who did not want to be identified, said he was there only to
drink and look.
   Until the early 1980s, boys town was near the center of Acuna, a
city of about 120,000. After residents complained about the noise,
the district was moved out of town and the party atmosphere
subsided.
   Boys towns also flourish in the border towns of Reynosa, Juarez,
Neuvo Laredo and Piedras Negras.
   Prostitutes come from all over Mexico to earn money at the
brothels.
   Clients say the women charge $40 to $100 for their services. The
prostitutes won't discuss profits.
   They say they have no pimps and keep all the money they get
except for about $5 per customer they pay the bar for use of a room.
   By contrast, the legal minimum wage in Mexico for unskilled
workers is $3.90 a day. Mexican workers in some American factories
along the border generally are considered well-paid at about $100 a
week.
   The prostitutes shy away from discussing their personal lives.
   Rosalinda, 26, said in her six months in Acuna she has had sex
with thousands of men.
   Her only complaints are slow nights early in the week and the
American youths who come not for sex but to take advantage of
Mexico's lower drinking age.
   ``You don't need them around,'' Rosalinda said in Spanish.
``What do you need them for?''

<HEAD>Seabrook Officials Order Plant Shut Down For 4-6 Weeks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Seabrook nuclear power plant officials
ordered the reactor shut down for four to six weeks of
modifications Saturday, shortly before the long-delayed plant was
to produce its first commercial electricity.
   Seabrook officials decided Saturday morning that electrical
feedback from the New England power grid could cause a section of
the plant's turbine to vibrate beyond specifications, plant
spokesman David Scanzoni said.
   ``It's a delay, but that's the purpose of the test,'' Scanzoni
said. ``We'll take all the time that's necessary.''
   He said plant engineers have yet to determine what modifications
are needed on the turbine, a 200-foot-long shaft that drives an
electrical generator. The problem didn't involve the reactor.
   The reactor, which has operated at up to 10 percent of full
power since winning its commercial license from the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission on March 1, was at 6 percent power before the
shutdown, Scanzoni said.
   Plant officials had hoped the reactor would begin commercial
operation by early this week and reach 100 percent power within two
to three months. Scanzoni said Seabrook now won't be able to start
commercial operation before late May.
   Saturday's shutdown was the third shut down since the reactor
since the current phase of testing began March 20. The reactor was
shut March 22 for adjustments and again a week later because of
questionable readings from sensors on the turbine, Scanzoni said.
   The $6.5 billion, 1,150-megawatt reactor, initially planned to
operate commercially in 1979 at a fraction of the cost, wasn't
completed until 1986 because of repeated regulatory delays and cost
overruns. Concerns about evacuation planning for crowded beach
communities less than two miles from the plant held up a commercial
license until this year.
   The delays forced lead Seabrook owner Public Service Company of
New Hampshire to seek bankruptcy protection in 1988. The plant also
has been the site of anti-nuclear demonstrations that have resulted
in more than 3,000 arrests since 1976.

<TEXT>
   British art critic Peter Fuller, founder of the
magazine Modern Painters, was killed in an auto crash Saturday,
police said. He was 42.
   No other vehicle was involved in the crash on the M4 highway in
Berkshire, west of London, said Thames Valley police.
   Three other people in the car were injured, including Fuller's
wife, Stephanie, and his son, Laurence, 3, said police speaking on
condition of anonymity in line with British custom.
   Fuller was appointed art critic last year of The Sunday
Telegraph which carried his final review in its Sunday edition.
Trevor Grove, editor of the weekly, said: ``Peter Fuller was one of
the most perceptive, passionate and fluent art critics of our
time.''
   ``His defense of traditional artistic values and vigorous
skepticism of what was and is bogus in the modernist movement made
his writing both controversial and stimulating. But this never
blinded him to the merits of good contemporary work,'' Grove said.
   In 1987, Fuller founded and edited the quarterly Modern Painters
principally to bring to attention British artists whom he
considered were too often underrated. In Britain, where sales of
art magazines and books are traditionally modest, the magazine had
an astonishing successs and attracted several thousand
subscriptions.
   Fuller wrote in what was to be his final newspaper review:``In
Britain right now, painting seems to be in a more robust state than
anywhere else in the world.''

   A man who wrote a letter threatening
President Bush and others was sentenced to six months a halfway
house.
   At a U.S. District Court hearing Friday, David L. Cook also was
fined $1,000 and ordered to undergo mental evaluation and attend
mental counseling if deemed appropriate.
   Cook, of Dry Prong, pleaded guilty in February to a charge of
writing a threatening letter.
   Prosecutors said Cook mailed a letter May 8, 1989, threatening

Polk. The letter was mailed to Secret Service agents in Shreveport.
   Another letter written by Cook on top of the threatening letter
left an impression with his name and address that showed up under
laboratory analysis, prosecutors said.
   U.S. District Judge F.A. Little Jr. ordered Cook to serve his
sentence at the Alexandria Salvation Army Community Treatment
Center, a halfway house for federal prisoners.

<HEAD>Official Attacked For Article Calling For Ties With U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A radical Iranian newspaper on Saturday
attacked Iran's vice president for suggesting direct talks with the
United States, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   Vice President Ataollah Mohajerani, in a column in the
Farsi-language newspaper Ettelaat on Thursday, had argued that Iran
has much to gain by agreeing to direct talks with the United States.
   The daily Jomhuri Islami said Mohajerani's arguments had
``stirred a feeling of disgust among the people and the
officials,'' according to IRNA, monitored in Cyprus.
   The Iranian news agency also said the Islamic Association of
Tehran University Students has called for a demonstration Sunday to
protest against Mohajerani's comments.
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani has spoken in favor of normalizing
ties with the West, especially the West European countries. But
until the Mohajerani article, no high-ranking Iranian official had
argued publicly that Tehran should re-establish ties with
Washington.
   Rafsanjani's radical opponents are unwilling to consider the
possibility of renewed relations with the United States. Iran has
been implacably anti-American since its 1979 Islamic revolution.
   In his article, Mohajerani argued that the United States could
pressure Iraq into withdrawing troops from Iranian territory seized
in the eight-year Persian Gulf war.
   Mohajerani also said that talks could result in the freeing of
billions of dollars in frozen Iranian assets. The United States
froze the assets and severed ties after Iranian militants stormed
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in November 1979 and took 52 Americans
hostage.

   Blues singer and guitarist B.B. King canceled
two weekend performances at a jazz festival here, and a festival
spokesman said King was hospitalized in Las Vegas.
   King, 64, whose earthy lyrics and soulful guitar sound have won
him a wide following outside traditional blues circles, missed

   His represetatives said King was hospitalized in Las Vegas,

   King, who calls his guitar Lucille, is known for performances of
such songs as ``The Thrill is Gone,'' ``You Done Lost Your Good

   King was replaced Friday night by blues singer and guitarist
Elvin Bishop, but no replacement was brought in for the Saturday

^Justice Investigating Miami U.S. Attorney for Misconduct</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department is conducting an
internal inquiry into allegations of misconduct by the acting U.S.
attorney in Miami, whose office is prosecuting Manuel Noriega,
according to sources.
   The investigation of Dexter Lehtinen comes as the Senate
Judiciary Committee considers his nomination by President Bush to a
full term as the chief federal prosecutor in south Florida.
   The sources familiar with the inquiry and who asked not to be
identified by name said the Justice Department Office of
Professional Responsibility recently sent investigators to Miami to
conduct interviews into allegations including:
   _ That Lehtinen pressured his staff to inflate overtime reports
to prompt Washington to boost the size of his office _ now one of
the Justice Department's largest.
   _ That Lehtinen tried to participate in a public corruption
investigation after recusing himself from a case which involved a
potential political rival of his wife, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen,
R-Fla.
   _ That a letter written by Lehtinen's spokeswoman, Diane Cossin,
to the Miami Herald may have violated federal privacy law. The
letter said Lehtinen once almost fired a former prosecutor for
``egregious misconduct.''
   The Herald obtained a copy of the personnel file of the
prosecutor, who resigned last month, and reported that its contents
did not support the statements in Ms. Cossin's letter.
   Lehtinen did not immediately return a telephone call seeking
comment Friday.
   Ms. Cossin declined to comment on the reported inquiry, saying:
``We don't respond to speculation and we don't confirm or deny
investigations.''
   Lehtinen has been in the headlines before.
   In January, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh eased Lehtinen off
the Noriega trial team. Government sources said at the time that
the attorney general took the action because of concern that
Lehtinen's volatile temper and his relatively modest trial
experience could hamper the government's drug-trafficking case
against the deposed Panamanian leader.
   The internal Justice Department investigation comes at a
politically sensitive time. Lehtinen's nomination to a full term as
U.S. attorney in Miami is pending in the Senate.
   The review also could prove ticklish for the Bush administration
because of Lehtinen's political ties to the White House.
   The president's son, Jeb, supported Ms. Ros-Lehtinen's
successful campaign last summer to win the seat of the late Rep.
Claude Pepper, D-Fla. President Bush personally campaigned for Ms.
Ros-Lehtinen, who is popular in Miami's Cuban-American community.
   One of the items under review involves an alleged attempt by
Lehtinen to involve himself in the corruption investigation of
Hialeah Mayor Raul Martinez after publicly recusing himself from
the case, according to sources familiar with the probe.
   In announcing his recusal, Lehtinen explained that Martinez, who
was indicted this month on racketeering charges, was a possible
political rival of his wife.
   The false overtime report allegation stems from a staff meeting
during which Lehtinen told prosecutors they should take more credit
for the long hours they put in, the sources said.
   Lehtinen told the staff that he wanted the U.S. attorney's
office for the southern district of Florida to replace the southern
district of New York in the eyes of the nation's lawyers as the
premier branch of the Justice Department, the sources added.
   Lehtinen told staff attorneys that federal prosecutors in the
department's New York office worked 65 hours of overtime a month
and expressed confidence that Miami prosecutors did so as well, the
sources said.
   Federal prosecutors do not receive additional pay for overtime
work. But the figures collected by the Justice Department in
monthly statistical reports from the nation's 93 U.S. attorney's
offices are used to determine whether to add more prosecutors to a
particular office.
   The number of federal prosecutors in the office increased from
88 in November 1988 to 154 currently, and the Justice Department
has authorized as many as 200 this year, officials said.
   The possible Privacy Act violation involves a March 12 letter
Ms. Cossin wrote to the Herald in reply to a letter the newspaper
had published from David DeMaio, who resigned to join a private
Miami firm.
   The departure of DeMaio and four others from the office was
cited by the Herald as evidence of staff dissatisfaction with
Lehtinen.
   The Herald article quoted Ms. Cossin as saying the fact the
prosecutors stayed long after Lehtinen took over ``indicates some
sort of happiness with the office.''
   DeMaio wrote a letter published by the Herald saying ``her views
do not necessarily reflect my own, and she was not authorized to
speak for me.''
   By way of reply, Ms. Cossin wrote that Lehtinen had authorized
her to state that he had once almost fired DeMaio for ``egregious
misconduct'' and was ``counseled for failure to pursue important
investigations properly'' and denied a pay raise.

<HEAD>Report: 200 Aliens Seeking Asylum May Be Released</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 200 aliens in detention centers may be
paroled in an experiment that could signal a change in the way the
United States views aliens seeking political asylum, according to
report published Sunday.
   Under current rules, aliens requesting asylum are held in
custody while their cases are reviewed _ a process that can take
from a few days to years.
   The new program, starting in several cities this week, would let
selected detainees remain free while the Immigration and
Naturalization Service reviews their cases, The New York Times
reported.
   Participants in the program would have to post a bond of between
$500 to $2,500, establish their identities, and have jobs,
residences and lawyers or other accredited representatives.
   Alien also would have to agree to report monthly to the INS and
return to detention or leave the country if ordered, the newspaper
reported.
   The 18-month experimental program will be in New York, Miami,
Los Angeles and San Francisco.
   The INS said there are 5,000 to 6,000 aliens in its detention
centers, not including Cubans from the Mariel boatlift who are
considered criminals.
   The director of the refugee project for the Lawyers Committee
for Human Rights, Arthur C. Helton, said the program stems from
talks he had with the new INS commissioner, Gene McNary.
   ``We hope that this release project will demonstrate that many
refugees are being unnecessarily incarcerated in the United
States,'' Helton told the Times.
   ``This project may indeed signal the beginning of the end of one
the harshest elements of the INS's detention policy.''

   Broadway said goodbye Saturday to ``A Chorus
Line'' in an emotional final performance that included tears,
cheers and a standing ovation for the musical's cast, past and
present.
   ``This show is dedicated to anyone who has ever danced in a
chorus or marched in step anywhere,'' said producer Joseph Papp as
the show ended a 15-year run of 6,137 performances, the longest in
Broadway history.
   ``Take a final bow `Chorus line,''' Papp said.
   There were wild applause after every musical number and at the
end of the show, the audience cheered throughout the finale.
   Papp began a roll call of all the performers in the current
production and hen brought on stage all the dancers who were in the
original 1975 production.
   Theater-goers then roared their approval as a photo of Michael
Bennett, the show's director and choreographer appeared on stage.
Bennett died of AIDS in 1987 at the age of 44.
   The sold-out evening benefited the New York Shakespeare
Festival, which produced the musical. Tickets were priced from $80
to $500.
   Papp announced the pending closure in February, citing declining
ticket sales. At first he said it would close at the end of March,
but a surge of last-minute ticket sales pushed the closing date
back four weeks.
   The public first saw ``A Chorus Line'' in April 1975 in the
Shakespeare Festival's Newman Theater off-Broadway.
   The show was born from a series of workshops conducted by
Bennett. Material came from more than 40 hours of taped
conversations with theater dancers about their hopes, fears, lives
and loves.
   It was Bennett who fashioned the musical, hiring composer Marvin
Hamlisch, lyricist Ed Kleban, and Nicholas Dante and James Kirkwood
to write the book.
   ``A Chorus Line'' was an immediate success. The reviews were
ecstatic, and the musical moved to Broadway on July 25, 1975. In
1976, it won the Pulitzer Prize for drama.
   Since then, it has become one of the most financially successful
Broadway shows ever. Variety pegged its total profit as of February
1990 at more than $50 million, the second highest in U.S. theater
history after ``Cats.''
   A London edition ran more than 900 performances. The first
national company opened in May 1976 and didn't close until
September 1980. An international tour lasted even longer, from
April 1976 until August 1983.
   There have been several special performances over the years. On
Jan. 30, 1981, the recently released Iranian hostages attended a
performance of the show. On Sept. 29, 1983, ``A Chorus Line''
became the longest-running show in Broadway history with
performance No. 3,389, passing ``Grease.'' Bennett put 332 past and
current cast members on stage.
   At the 5,001st performance, 19 people who appeared in stock or
amateur productions of the show joined Broadway cast members on
stage for the finale.
   There has been renewed interest in ``A Chorus Line'' over the
past year, with four books written about the show or about Bennett.
The original cast, which participated in one of the books, appeared
on talk and news shows.
   The list of the five longest-running Broadway shows now stands
at: ``A Chorus Line,'' 6,137 performances; ``Oh! Calcutta!,''
5,959; ``42nd Street,'' 3,486; ``Grease,'' 3,388, and ``Fiddler on
the Roof,'' 3,242.

   Mexico said Saturday it would demand the
extradition of anyone involved in the abduction of a Mexican doctor
to face U.S. charges in connection with the murder of an American
drug agent.
   The April 2 kidnapping _ and allegations that it was
masterminded by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration _ have
inflamed U.S.-Mexican relations.
   ``The Mexican government will immediately initiate the process
for soliciting the extradition of the people, whether Mexicans or
foreigners, who participated in the execution, planning or
organization of the abduction,'' Mexico's Foreign Ministry said in
a news release.
   Mexican authorities said Saturday a former Mexican policeman
arrested in connection with the kidnapping said he was told it was
a DEA operation.
   Claims that the abduction was DEA-approved also came from from
Antonio Garate Bustamente, a self-styled DEA informant and former
Mexican police officer.
   Garate told the Los Angeles Times that 10 Mexicans were promised
a total of $100,000 to deliver Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain to U.S.
authorities. Among those involved were Mexican federal policemen,
he said.
   The Mexican attorney general's office said that former policeman
Jorge Covarrubias Manriquez, arrested Saturday, said he was told
the kidnapping was a DEA operation and that he would receive $3,700.
   The attorney general's office described Covarrubias as a leader
of the group accused in the kidnapping. Covarrubias joins six other
men Mexican authorities have arrested for questioning in the
incident.
   Four men claiming they were Mexican federal police seized
Alvarez Machain in Guadalajara on April 2. When he arrived in El
Paso, Texas the next day, he was arrested.
   The U.S. Justice Department and the Mexican attorney general's
office are conducting separate investigations of the incident.
   On Saturday, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh denied DEA
involvement.
   ``No DEA agent was involved in Mexico in the apprehension of Dr.
Alvarez Machain,'' Thornburgh said CNN's Newsmaker program.
   ``No one was involved in bringing him to this country. Our first
encounter was when he got off the plane in El Paso and he was taken
into custody in the United States by DEA agents,'' he said.
   Thornburgh said he wanted to bring to justice everyone involved
in the February 1985 kidnapping of U.S. drug agent Enrique ``Kiki''
Camarena in Guadalajara. Camarena's mutilated body was found
several weeks later.
   Alvarez Machain had long been sought by American authorities,
who allege that he monitored Camarena's medical condition while he
was being interrogated and administered stimulants to revive the
DEA agent during questioning.
   Garate told the Times that plans to abduct Alvarez Machain were
approved by Hector Berellez, a DEA agent in Los Angeles who heads
the nine-member unit investigating Camarena's murder in Guadalajara.
   ``I couldn't do anything without their knowledge,'' Garate said.
He said he was paid $4,000 a month by the DEA for his work.
   ``I know the crooks,'' said Garate, who claimed he once headed a
state SWAT team in Guadalajara. ``I know Guadalajara.''
   Garate, 51, said the plot to abduct Alvarez was dubbed ``The
Wild Geese,'' for a 1978 film starring Richard Burton about
mercenaries in Africa.
   Unnamed DEA officials told the newspaper that Garate was the key
go-between in arranging the abduction.
   A DEA source called Garate a longtime agency ``asset,'' a term
often used to describe an informant or operative. Officials in
Mexico City also said Garate was an informant, who had been wanted
in Mexico since 1985.

<TEXT>
   President Guillermo Endara said he is
optimistic the U.S. Senate will approve an aid package for Panama
and he intends to thank President Bush for the funds during his
visit to Washington this week.
   Endara's five-day trip beginning Sunday is his first to the
United States since he was installed as president at the start of
the U.S. invasion on Dec. 20 that overthrew dictator Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   ``When I meet with President Bush, everything indicates that we
are going to have the economic aid approved,'' Endara said in an
interview with the Associated Press late Friday.
   Endara, scheduled to see Bush on Monday, said he will ``thank
(Bush), in my name and for the Panamanian people.''
   The $420 million aid package to Panama is part of a $3.4 billion
spending bill that has been held up in the Senate. Once the Senate
approves the bill, a joint Senate-House panel must then reconcile
the proposal with the House's $2.4 billion spending bill.
   Endara opposed Noriega in the May 1989 presidential elections.
Noriega, awaiting trial on narcotics charges in the United States,
annulled the elections when it became apparent that Endara was
winning.
   During his five-day trip to Washington and New York, Endara will
also meet with officials from the International Monetary Fund, the
World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. He will also
hold talks with the secretary general of the Organization of
American States, Joao Baena Soares, and with U.N. Secretary General
Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   Accompanied by 12 other Panamanian officials, Endara is to take
a commercial flight to Miami, where a U.S. government plane will
pick him up for the flight to Washington. He travels to New York on
Tuesday and returns to Washington on Thursday.

<HEAD>No Retrial for Ex-Panther in San Quentin Killings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN RAFAEL, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Black Panther Johnny Spain,
whose double murder conviction in a 1971 San Quentin prison
uprising was overturned because he was shackled during his trial,
will not be retried, authorities said Friday.
   Marin County District Attorney Jerry Herman called the reversal
of Spain's conviction ``a travesty and a gross miscarriage of
justice'' but said in a statement that a retrial would serve no
practical purpose.
   ``Since this case is now 19 years old, and since the defendant
Spain has now been out of custody and led a crime-free life for
three years, it is impossible to believe that a conviction secured
after a retrial would result in the defendant Spain being
resentenced to prison,'' Herman said.
   Spain, 40, has been out of prison for just over two years. He
was freed in March 1988 after a judge ordered the state parole
board not to consider the San Quentin incident in deciding whether
Spain was suitable for parole from a 1967 murder conviction.
   Herman said the widows and families of three prison guards who
were killed in the incident, and three other guards who survived
after their throats were cut, ``support our decision not to retry
the case.''
   Spain's lawyer, Dennis Riordan, said he was relieved, not only
that the case was over, but also ``that that era is being laid to
rest.''
   It was a time of ``tremendous racial and political violence,
when decent people on both sides of the line were killed,'' Riordan
said. ``You have to put it behind you at some point and go on or
the cycle continues.
   Three guards and three prisoners, including militant leader
George Jackson, author of the book ``Soledad Brother,'' were killed
in the August 1971 melee. Authorities said it started when Jackson
pulled a smuggled gun from beneath a hairpiece and tried to escape
from the prison's isolation unit.
   Spain, then serving a life sentence for a Los Angeles murder
committed when he was 17, was seen running with Jackson out of the
maximum-security unit, and was accused of aiding Jackson in the
escape attempt and the murders.
   U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson overturned Spain's
convictions in 1982, ruling that Marin County Superior Court Judge
Henry Broderick had improperly left on the jury a woman who had
said she thought a friend had been murdered by a Black Panther.
   The Supreme Court reversed Henderson's ruling in 1983 but left
other issues unresolved. Henderson again overturned the convictions
in 1986, this time citing the 25 pounds of shackles Jackson was
forced to wear throughout the court proceedings from 1971 to 1976.
   The chains, sometimes attached for 10 to 12 hours a day,
hampered Spain's ability to communicate with his lawyer, may have
affected his decision not to testify, and may have prejudiced the
jury against him, Spain said.

<TEXT>
   Some 2,000 Mohawk
Indians began evacuating their reservation Friday to escape
factional violence that has left roadways lined with burned cars
and caused residents, including children, to brandish arms.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo, meanwhile, stood firm on his refusal to send
New York State Police or National Guardsmen to restore order on the
St. Regis Mohawk Reservation, despite pleas from one Indian leader
and some outsiders.
   One man was critically injured in the violence and another was
missing.
   The reservation straddles New York and Canada, but the violence
so far has taken place on the United States side.
   After a week of nightly confrontations between Indians who
support casino gambling and bingo on the U.S. side and those who
oppose it, Canadian Mohawk leaders on Friday evacuated women,
children and the elderly from the village of St. Regis in Quebec,
which is near the violence on the New York state border. They were
sent to nearby Cornwall, Ontario, just outside the reservation.
   ``It has become a very tense situation and we can no longer
guarantee safety for our people,'' said Lloyd Benedict, chief of
the Canadian band council.
   About 5,000 Mohawks live in the Canadian sector of the
reservation, and it's expected the evacuation will affect at least
2,000 of them, he said. The reservation's total population is about
14,000.
   The recent violence began March 23, when Indians who oppose
gambling set up roadblocks to keep outsiders off the reservation.
They demanded tribe leaders address the gambling dispute and the
presence of the Warrior Society, a heavily armed faction that has
appointed itself the protector of Mohawk sovereignty.
   Pro-gambling Mohawks tore down the blockades in a hailstorm of
gunfire Tuesday night, but gambling has largely stopped since the
barricades went up.
   On Friday, the reservation straddling the Canadian border had
the look of a war zone.
   Burned cars lined the roads, most buildings had bullet holes or
broken windows and residents, including children, were armed with
guns or baseball bats.
   State police warn outsiders to stay off the reservation.
   The latest casualty of the long-running dispute was Brian Cole,
one of the leaders of the blockades. He was in critical condition
in Ottawa General Hospital Friday after his skull and jaw were
fractured in a confrontation Thursday.
   Relatives said Cole was helping search for Horace Cook, 50, who
came as a representative of the Onondaga nation near Syracuse to
help monitor the barricades at the request of the anti-gambling
faction. Cook, a diabetic who doesn't see well, has been missing
since Thursday.
   Among those calling for intervention has been St. Regis Tribal
Council Head Chief Harold Tarbell, who has asked for National
Guardsmen to serve as peacekeepers on the reservation.
   On Thursday, U.S. Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, chairman of the
select committee on Indian affairs, wrote Cuomo expressing his
concern about the ``most grave situation'' at St. Regis.
   Canada urged Cuomo to take action in a complaint made by the its
embassy in Washington, D.C., to the State Department, said Patricia
Low-Bedard, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Department of External
Affairs.
   ``We made no specific suggestions, but our government finds the
situation alarming and we are concerned that something needs to be
done,'' Low-Bedard said Friday.
   State troopers entered the reservation Thursday to help search
for Cook, on Sunday to investigate a fire and last week to make
their first arrests since last summer, of five people involved in
the violence.
   ``We want this situation resolved,'' Cuomo said Friday at a news
conference in Albany. ``We're working very hard to figure out how
to do it. I think what we've done so far, what the state police
have done so far, has been appropriate.''

<HEAD>Magazine Recounts France's Deportation of 3,500 Jewish Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld on Friday hailed a
magazine report as the first French media account of France's role
in the roundup and deportation of 3,500 Jewish children who later
died at Auschwitz.
   ``The episode in well-known to historians,'' Klarsfeld said in
an interview, ``but this is the first time a journalist has ever
gone to the scene of the crime to interview people who lived
there.''
   The cover story in this week's L'Express magazine, published
Thursday, details the role of the French police in the roundup.
   Klarsfeld, who tracked down the Lyon Gestapo chief Klaus Barbie,
said he hoped the article would help speed court action against
Rene Bousquet, 80, charged with crimes against humanity.
   Bousquet was chief of the national police during the
deportations, which Klarsfeld said were conducted by the
collaborationist Vichy government to curry favor with the Nazi
occupiers.
   Eric Conan, a reporter for L'Express, visited the towns of
Pithiviers and Beaune-la-Rolande, sites of two French concentration
camps where the children spent their last days before being shipped
to the Nazis' Auschwitz death camp.
   ``In Pithiviers, nothing, absolutely nothing, officially
commemorates the agony experienced by the children before their
deaths,'' he wrote.
   A collective gravestone in Beaune-la-Rolande shows three small
children died at that time. The stone reads simply, ``Victims of
Hitler's barbarism.''
   ``This is false: they were under the auspices of the French
government until the moment they died,'' Conan wrote.
   The children were arrested in Paris with their families July
16-17, 1942, in the infamous ``Vel d'Hiv Roundup,'' named for their
destination, a large cycling stadium.
   The families were kept kept at the stadium for days without
food, water or sanitary facilities. They were transferred to
Pithiviers and Beaune-la-Rolande. The adults were sent directly on
to Auschwitz, but the children, including babies and toddlers,
remained for weeks in the camps, where many died of starvation and
disease.
   They were later shipped to Auschwitz and sent to the gas
chambers on arrival.
   Klarsfeld said French authorities ordered the deportations of
the children. The Nazis, he said, had issued orders for the roundup
of only Jews over age 16 for fear of inciting the occupied
population.
   ``They never would have taken the risk of arresting and dragging
children into the streets of Paris,'' Klarsfeld said.

   Some members of Congress, upset over President
Bush's removal of Japan from a ``hit list'' of unfair traders, are
introducing legislation to take away the president's discretion in
the matter.
   The bill is just one example of the firestorm created by the
administration's decision Friday to remove Japan from a list of
countries deemed to have erected the most offensive barriers to the
sale of U.S. products.
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., took to the Senate floor to declare
that he was ``thunderstruck'' by the action.
   ``Excuse me, Mr. President, but this boggles the mind,'' he
said. ``Letting Japan off the hook is a serious mistake and I think

   The chairman of a Soviet parliamentary
delegation says he will try to find out which Soviet official
rejected offers of international aid after the 1986 explosion at
the Chernobyl nuclear reactor.
   With the full dimensions of the Chernobyl disaster now becoming
clear, the Supreme Soviet has reversed course and is urgently
seeking scientific, medical and material aid from the world
community.
   At a news conference at the Soviet Embassy on Friday, five
Soviet parliamentary deputies said the official secrecy that
shrouded the aftermath of the April 26, 1986, fire and explosion at
the Chernobyl reactor was a damaging mistake because it masked the
scope and scale of the disaster.
   In addition, they said efforts to clean up radiation
contamination and deal with the medical effects of the accident
might have been far more advanced by now if most foreign assistance
had not been rejected.

   Managers of the Savannah River nuclear weapons
plant in South Carolina put some of its workers at an unnecessarily
high risk of ``gross contamination'' by plutonium, according to an
Energy Department audit report.
   Plutonium, a key ingredient in nuclear warheads, is one of the
most toxic elements known. Lethal lung doses of plutonium are
measured in the billionths of a gram.
   The defense contractor that runs the plant, Westinghouse
Electric Corp., said Friday it was taking action to correct the
problem. It was discovered during a two-month probe of health,
safety and environmental conditions at Savannah River, which makes
plutonium and other special materials for nuclear weapons.
   The audit ended March 23 and results were made available Friday
at the Energy Department, which owns Savannah River and 16 other
major nuclear arms plants and laboratories.

biopsy soon to determine the nature of a growth on his vocal cords,
an Army doctor says.
   Dr. Russ Zajtchuk, deputy commander of clinical services at
Walter Reed Army Medical Center, said Friday that Polhill is not
considered strong enough yet to have the general anesthesia that is
necessary for the biopsy.
   He said it probably will be performed ``about Monday.''
   Polhill, 55, a diabetic, lost 25 pounds during his three years

   Lithuania's president and a Soviet government
spokesman on Saturday praised a French-West German proposal to
defuse tensions, raising the possibility it could lead to a
compromise between Moscow and Vilnius.
   The Kremlin has shut down shipments of oil, restricted natural
gas and cut supplies of manufactured goods and food supplies to
Lithuania. On Saturday, a Soviet government official said coal
supplies had been cut as well.
   A letter from French President Francois Mitterrand and West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl proposed Lithuania suspend some laws
backing up its March 11 declaration of independence but did not
suggest repealing the declaration itself.
   ``We consider that this is not far from the line that the Soviet
leadership has been pursuing from the very beginning,'' Arkady
Maslennikov, a spokesman for Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
told a Kremlin briefing. ``We consider this a constructive signal.''

   One-third of the projects in a $1.6 billion
elderly housing program are in or near financial ruin, with bloated
loans and lousy management to blame, according to auditors who say
the government will have little choice but to foot the bill.
   On at least two occasions, prominent Republican political
consultants swayed senior Department of Housing and Urban
Development officials to overrule field deputies and approve loans
for projects in the troubled Retirement Service Center program, the
audit says.
   The study details anew favoritism and myriad management problems
at HUD during the Reagan administration tenure of Secretary Samuel
R. Pierce Jr.
   The new report, obtained by The Associated Press through the
Freedom of Information Act, also suggests the pricetag for that
mismanagement is rising, with no end in sight, as millions of

   Thousands of angry workers battled
riot police with firebombs, rocks, pipes and clubs Saturday to
protest a huge police attack that crushed a three-day strike at the
world's largest shipyard.
   Police said at least 24 people were injured, 10 of them
policemen, in violence that began when thousands of security
officials stormed the Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. by land and sea.
Police said 499 workers were arrested and warrants were issued for
six fugitive union leaders.
   The crackdown came as other plants threatened to stage sympathy
strikes, raising fears of reduced business investment and more
sharp declines in South Korea's ailing stock market.
   ``The survival of the national economy was at stake,'' a
governing party spokesman, Park Hee-tae, said in defending the

   Record annualized inflation of 4,854 percent has fallen
dramatically since Collor announced his ``New Brazil'' plan March
16, one day after taking office as the country's first
democratically elected president in 29 years.
   It put an 18-month freeze on savings deposits of more than
$1,200 and limited withdrawals from money market funds to $600 or
20 percent of the value, whichever was greater.

   While the performance of all major U.S. stock
markets has been uninspired so far in 1990, the going has been
particularly tough in the over-the-counter market.
   From New Year's through the middle of last week, the Dow Jones
average of 30 blue chips listed on the New York Stock Exchange
posted a net decline of 3.15 percent.
   Over the same span the NASDAQ composite index of issues that are
traded over-the-counter more than doubled that decline, with a 7.53
percent drop.
   For the 12-month period through April 25, the story is much the
same, with a gain of 11.61 percent for the Dow and a 0.67 percent
decline for the NASDAQ index (the acronym stands for National
Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations).
   All this is not very cheery news for individual investors, who
have a bigger proportional stake in over-the-counter trading than
they do at the NYSE, the primary hunting ground of investing
institutions such as pension funds.
   Nor is it any great source of elation to Joseph Hardiman,
president of the NASD, which serves as the industry overseer and
regulatory organization for over-the-counter activity.
   But whatever ails the OTC market can be largely attributed to
investment vogues that tend to run in cycles, Hardiman suggested in
an interview on a visit here from his Washington headquarters.
   The small growth companies that make up a big part of the NASDAQ
system, he noted, have suffered through an unusually long period of
disfavor, which most analysts trace as far back as 1983.
   Over that stretch, both domestic institutions and foreign
investors have gravitated to the big blue-chip names. ``I think the
cycle may be about to reverse itself,'' he said.
   OTC price indexes also have been dragged down, Hardiman added,
by the large number of bank and other financial stocks traded in
the market.
   Beset by real-estate debt woes and a new stringency in lending
practices, over-the-counter bank stocks tumbled 23.40 percent in
the past year. None of the many NYSE-listed bank holding companies,
by contrast, is represented in the Dow.
   The image of the over-the-counter market suffered a severe blow
in the crash of 1987, as a flood of orders ran into bottlenecks and
other problems.
   Hardiman says the system has been greatly strengthened since
that time by new rules and procedures intended, among other things,
to put greater reliance on automation.
   In the current sluggish environment, he observes, ``we've got
excess capacity at the moment.''
   How to restore the enthusiasm of investors for the kind of small
and medium-sized stocks that make up such a large part of the
NASDAQ system? Hardiman sees no single wonder drug to prescribe.
   But he maintains that both individual investors and the economy
would benefit from a restoration of some form of favorable tax
treatment for capital gains, skewed to encourage long-term
investment.
   ``The longer you hold an asset the lower the tax rate should
be,'' he says.
   ``I think individuals who think they can speculate by trying to
trade the market are fooling themselves,'' he adds. ``They should
be long-term investors _ buy stocks, put them away and grow with
the company.
   ``Some of the people who did the best in the October 1987 market
break were individual investors who didn't sell.''

   Slim Harrison's Appalachian mountain music
recently fell on deaf ears, but those who were there had a
knee-slappin' good time.
   Students at the Maryland School for the Deaf, who all wore
hearing aids, strummed his guitar, plucked a wash tub bass, picked
the strings of his banjo and tapped spoons on their thighs. A few
of the youngsters could hear various tones from Harrison's jug band
instruments, but most experienced the sounds through vibration.
   ``The idea is to expose the kids to some different instruments
that they probably have never seen,'' said Harrison, whose program
is one of a rising number of attempts across the country to
introduce music to the hearing impaired. ``They've probably seen a
guitar on TV, but have not actually played it and felt the
vibration.
   ``If they have never felt the instrument with their hands and
felt the vibrations, they really can't understand what this music
stuff is all about.''
   One group made such a racket that vibrations could be felt
through tiles on the classroom floor. Teachers were holding their
ears, but the children were oblivious to the noise they were making.
   ``It sounds that way with hearing children too,'' Harrison
shouted as fourchildren played his banjo, guitar, dulcimer and
autoharp _ all at the same time. ``That's about par for the
course.''
   Harrison, a one-man band, is doing a five-day residency at the
122-year-old school, which provides free education to deaf students
in Maryland.
   His work with 47 severely to profoundly deaf children is being
sponsored by Very Special Arts in Maryland, an organization that
works to enrich the lives of disabled people through art, and the
Maryland State Arts Council.
   Harrison has introduced the world of music to physically,
emotionally and mentally handicapped children during programs in
Rutland, Vt., Portland, Ore., Boston, Washington, Upland Hills,
Mich., and across Maryland. This was the first time he had worked
with a whole school of deaf students.
   ``Some of them can hear high tones, but not low tones,'' he
said. ``They can enjoy music on a different level than we do. With
loud rock 'n' roll, they can feel the vibrations shake their
bodies.''
   The sound of Harrison's autoharp apparently rattled the hearing
aid of 8-year-old Robin Oswald who cupped her hands over her ears
and squinted her eyes. The three other children in her class
expressed no discomfort at the sound.
   At one point in his program Harrison lost charge of the
children, who in their excitement began chatting with their hands
and doing impromptu solo performances.
   ``How do you get deaf students' attention?'' he asked their
teacher, who quickly commanded their attention through eye contact
and a series of hand signs.
   Harrison then launched into a tune on his dulcimer with the
teacher signing the students a message about how the name of the
instrument came from a Latin word meaning ``sweet song'' or ``sweet
love.''
   Robert Mowers, music consultant to the National Technical
Institute for the Deaf in Rochester, N.Y., said Harrison's jug band
program was one of a rising number of music programs being offered
to the deaf.
   ``Most of them are very small,'' said Mowers, who launched a
music program at the institute 14 years ago despite comments from
his colleagues who thought he was ``crazy.''
   ``There are many hearing impaired persons who enjoy music. They
just don't hear it like we do,'' Mowers said.
   Music heard by a deaf person might be like early radio
broadcasts full of static or early records that played at 78
revolutions per minute, he said.
   ``Those 78 recordings were terrible _ full of distortions and
scratches, yet millions of people enjoyed them,'' Mowers said.
   Music could be better utilized by deaf educators nationwide,
according to Deborah P. Clark, an assistant principal at the
Maryland School for the Deaf where music is a required course for
primary students.
   ``Most deaf schools use it as an adjunct or motivator, but not
very many have a whole course on it,'' she said.
   ``It gives them a chance to work with the language in a musical
and rhythmic way. We're trying to get them to practice the feel of
a loud sound and the feel of a soft sound (in their throats).''
   Carol Bean, the school's music aide, said she regularly teaches
students about high and low notes on an organ equipped with large
amplifiers.
   ``They all can't hear, but they can all feel the vibrations of
the organ,'' Bean said. ``The more exposure you can get the better
it is. Otherwise, the deaf world can be very narrow.''

   Glenda Jackson, the Academy Award-winning actress
and socialist, is within reach of a dream: abandoning the stage for
politics.
   Jackson still has her choice of stage and screen roles, but
she's also a liberal who has chosen to tie her future to the Labor
Party, the socialist opposition.
   If elected, she faces the comparative obscurity of being a
backbencher, a rank-and-file lawmaker in the 650-member House of
Commons.
   That means late-night sittings and looking after a constituency,
which can entail everything from fighting road expansions in the
district to unsnarling hitches in the supply of hot meals to the
elderly.
   It also raises the fascinating prospect of that distinctively
low, richly textured Jackson voice doing verbal battle with Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher at twice-weekly Question Time.
   This spring, after doing a Los Angeles production of ``Who's
Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,'' Jackson won the Labor Party nomination
for Hampstead and Highgate, home turf of London's smart literary
and theatrical set.
   Thatcher's troubled Conservatives hold the district by a narrow
2,200-vote margin, making it a prime Labor target at the next
general election. The election must be held by mid-1992, but could
well come sooner.
   In British politics, a candidate for Parliament must go before
the party constituency branch and explain why he or she would be a
good candidate.
   Jackson was up against three finalists, and she says her
ultimate triumph was to write her own script.
   ``I mean, you don't win an Oscar; someone else wins it for
you,'' she said in an interview. ``But this, I did.''
   The actress won her first Oscar for ``Women in Love'' in 1970,
followed by another for ``A Touch of Class'' in 1973.
   But for her political career, she chooses to look almost
determinedly unglamorous, making no attempt to hide her 53 years.
She is spurred by a hatred for Thatcherism.
   ``I hope she's hanging herself with her own hubris,'' she said.
``I am genuinely appalled by the state of my country and the plight
of many thousands of people under a government that seems to govern
only for the top people.''
   Jackson has been a Labor activist for most of the 11 years since
Thatcher won power. She appears in party television ads and has
lined up alongside leader Neil Kinnock at the big pre-election
rallies.
   She's not the only actor involved in politics. Vanessa Redgrave
turns out for the ultra-left Socialist Workers' Party, and John
Cleese for the centrist Social Democratic Party. But they have
never run for office.
   The late Laurence Olivier had a seat in the unelected House of
Lords after he was ennobled. But actors who become full-time
politicians are a rarity in Britain.
   Jackson's socialism springs from her working-class roots in
northern England. The eldest of four daughters of a bricklayer, she
dropped out of high school at 16 to become a drugstore clerk. She
got into amateur dramatics, smoothed out her northern accent, won a
state scholarship to drama school and went on to the front rank of
British theater.
   Roy Hodges, from whom she was divorced in 1976, once said of
her: ``If Glenda had gone into politics, she would have been prime
minister.''
   But Jackson, a committed feminist, disclaims any such goals.
   ``My political ambitions would be fulfilled by seeing the return
of a Labor government. I plan to be a very loyal backbencher,'' she
said.
   Being famous guarantees Jackson the kind of media attention
other political beginners can only dream about.
   The same goes for the only other celebrity among the first-time
nominees so far announced, Olympic gold medalist runner Sebastian
Coe. He has the Conservative Party nomination in a different
district.

<HEAD>Brazilian Economic Upheaval Hurting Profits at U.S. Companies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The anti-inflation austerity plan that has
slowed Brazil's economy to a near standstill is reaching into the
balance sheets of U.S. companies thousands of miles away.
   This past week, Whirlpool Corp. reported its first-quarter
profit fell 27.5 percent due to the impact of the economic plan on
its Brazilian affiliates.
   Whirlpool Chairman David R. Whitwam predicted the Brazilian
problems would hurt the appliance maker's operating results into
the second quarter before things gradually improve.
   Ford Motor Co. also warned this past week that its earnings
could be hurt if current conditions continue in Brazil, where it
makes cars through a joint venture with Volkswagen AG.
   Earlier, Caterpillar Inc. blamed lower first-quarter earnings in
part on slower sales in the South American nation. Also, J.P.
Morgan &amp; Co., BankAmerica Corp. and Chemical Banking Corp. said
they received lower interest payments or no interest payments at
all on Brazilian loans in recent months.
   Some of the revenue softness felt by U.S. companies can't be
traced directly to the Brazilian austerity plan, since it only was
launched last month. But economists warn that many foreign
companies operating in Brazil soon will feel the crimp unless they
take steps to export products they make in the nation.
   Brazilian President Fernando Collor de Mello initiated his
inflation-fighting plan a day after taking office March 15. Its
main feature is an 18-month freeze on bank accounts with more than
the equivalent of $1,200, and a limit on money market withdrawals
to $600 or 20 percent of the account, whichever is greater.
   The plan took an an estimated $115 billion out of circulation
overnight. It has cut inflation sharply, but also sent the
Brazilian economy into a tailspin, with the automobile,
construction and other industries virtually paralyzed.
   Many Amercian companies have extensive operations in Brazil, the
most industrialized nation in South America and eighth-largest
economy in the world. Among them are Ford, Caterpillar, General
Motors Corp., Johnson &amp; Johnson, Union Carbide Corp., Champion
International Corp., Philip Morris Cos., Alcoa and Quaker Oats Co.
   Javier Murcio, an economist with the economic research firm
DRI-McGraw-Hill, said the short-term impact of the anti-inflation
plan could be severe on Brazilian operations of these companies.
   ``It will take lots of strong nerves. In the short term it's
going to be very bumpy,'' he said.
   But over a longer period, U.S. companies may decide to export
more goods from their Brazilian operations, avoiding the troubled
domestic market as much as possible, he said.
   ``Using Brazil as an export launching pad is something companies
have discovered in the past few years and will continue to do,'' he
said.
   However, Mike Sherman, chief investment strategist for Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc., said it may not be so easy to export
manufactured goods that are made specifically for the Brazilian
market.
   Johnson &amp; Johnson, for one, says it doesn't have the option of
exporting its Brazilian goods because ``we tend to manufacture in
individual countries for sale in that country,'' said spokesman
Robert Kniffin.
   Johnson &amp; Johnson makes the same array of hospital and consumer
products in Brazil as it does in the United States and elsewhere,
he said.
   ``Our plants are operating but there has been a noticeable
decline in sales of products,'' he said.
   Johnson &amp; Johnson said Thursday its first-quarter earnings
dropped 23 percent due mainly to a $125 million charge. The charge
primarily was due to paying off an Argentinian subsidiary's loan,
but part of it came from problems in Brazil, Kniffin said.
   Murcio said the Brazilian operations of foreign companies have
been a bright spot and should continue to do well once the
short-term trouble from the economic plan eases. In the long run,
he said, all companies operating in Brazil should benefit from
lower inflation.
   ``Even despite the economic problems in Brazil in the recent
past, the Brazilian operations tended to be the ones that have been
the fastest growing and most profitable,'' he said.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Junk bond pioneer Michael Milken pleaded guilty to six felony
charges and agreed to pay $600 million in fines and penalties
stemming from the biggest securities fraud case ever against an
individual.
   _Financier James Goldsmith scrapped his $22 billion takeover

<HEAD>Nine An Un-Magic Number On Wall Street</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the mathematics of Wall Street, a 9 percent
interest rate equals a distinct minus for the stock market.
   At least that's the way the numbers crunched in the past week as
yields on long-term Treasury bonds surpassed the 9 percent level
for the first time in nearly a year.
   There was a time, a decade or so ago, when stock and bond
traders might have exulted to see interest rates at anywhere near 9
percent. In those inflation-wracked days, yields all along the
credit-market spectrum held persistently in two digits.
   But now things are different _ or at least they were supposed to
be as the 1990s dawned amid hopes for slow but steady growth in
business activity and corporate profits, without much interference
from inflationary pressures.
   At the start of the year long-term government bonds yielded
slightly less than 8 percent, and many forecasters voiced
confidence that they were headed lower still.
   Lower rates figured to stimulate spending by both businesses and
consumers, and to benefit the stock market by reducing the
comparative allure of interest-bearing investments.
   Such visions quickly began to fade, however, when rates jumped
in Japan, West Germany and other important U.S. trading partners,
dragging domestic rates higher as well.
   Optimism in the bond market has been dealt a second blow of late
by data for the first quarter of the year showing inflation rates
at their highest levels since the early 1980s.
   Now talk is spreading in the financial world that the Federal
Reserve once again finds itself facing a choice between two
not-very-happy alternatives.
   ``The classic dilemma of higher inflation amidst pockets of
economic weakness is confronting the Fed,'' said Anthony Vignola,
an analyst at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   ``If the Fed tightens policy and raises rates, it will incur the
displeasure of the Administration, and risk upsetting a delicate
but deteriorating international framework.
   ``More important, the Fed risks stifling economic growth, which
has suffered from continued weakness in manufacturing and housing.''
   As long-term rates rose to 9 percent, the stock market averages
headed down. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 50.90
this past week to 2,645.05, on top of a 55.85-point loss the week
before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.92 to 180.74;
the American Stock Exchange market value index lost 5.32 to 342.64,
and the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market was
down 7.81 at 417.98.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 135.59 million shares a day,
against 149.02 million the week before.
   Whatever other negative possibilities it presents, the
combination of slow growth and high interest rates makes for gloom
among stock-market investors as they contemplate the outlook for
corporate earnings.
   ``Unfortunately, the economy's slow-motion performance probably
won't do much to bring inflation down any time soon,'' says the
current edition of the Merrill Lynch Market Letter.
   ``That's because increases in labor costs show no signs of
slowing and recent gains in productivity have been meager.
   ``Corporate profits are likely to remain under pressure for the
foreseeable future as the economy plods along and inflation stays
high.''
   A good many optimists still hold out hope that today's high
rates, by acting as a drag on business activity, might improve the
chance for lower borrowing costs at some point later in the year.
Talk of at least a return to 8 percent government bond yields by
the fall is still prevalent on Wall Street.
   But upbeat interest-rate forecasts tend to meet with a lot of
skepticism these days, if only because of the way the batch
produced last winter turned out.

<HEAD>Is The Fed Watching The Wrong Figures?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By some of the more conventional measurements,
there is still plenty of credit available for American consumers
and businesses, especially those most ``credit-worthy.''
   As one economist, Edward Yardeni, puts it: ``Low-quality
borrowers, who need to finance very risky activities, are being
turned away by the bankers. But that leaves more lendable funds for
high-quality borrowers.''
   By another, less conventional definition, consumers, businesses
and governmental units at all levels are snared in a credit trap,
many of them destined for a long, painful experience and perhaps
bankruptcy.
   By the conventional definitions, the economy should avoid
recession in 1990 and conceivably grow faster than in 1989. By the
other, it is already in the midst of a dangerous, destructive,
credit-restraint recession.
   The more optimistic scenario comes from a revue of national
statistics, including gross national product, incomes, short-term
loan data, money in circulation and other figures used by
government economists.
   The negative conclusion comes from discussions with heads of
households, with folks who must meet the week-to-week bills. If
they can't, it is assumed that the impact will spread, with sales,
profits, tax receipts falling.
   The most common conventional definition of recession is two
successive quarters of shrinking gross national product. It hasn't
occurred, officially, since the last recession ended in 1982, the
longest gap of the century.
   Albert Sindlinger's definition is the unconventional one,
arrived at by talking directly to heads of households and asking
them how their personal finances are holding up. They aren't, he
says. Families are in trouble.
   How does he know? From Wallingford, Penn., his staff telephones
heads of households in the 48 contiguous states, 1,000 different
ones each week, a practice now approaching 13,000 consecutive days.
   The heads of households are asked these questions:
   _Is your total combined household annual income up or the same
as it was six months ago?
   _Will the total combined household annual income for the next
six months remain the same or be higher than now?
   _In the next six months, will there be more or the same number
of jobs where you work?
   _In the next six months do you anticipate better or the same
business conditions in your community?
   If the respondent answers any of the four questions with a
negative response, that household is said to have negative
household liquidity, roughly stated as inability or unwillingness
to maintain current standards.
   Sindlinger tells his business clients that a state is declared
to be in recession if household liquidity falls below 50 percent.
Two states were in recession in January 1989, 29 by December, 34 in
January and 41 in March.
   The only states solidly beyond recession in March were Illinois,
Ohio and Michigan. Four others, Washington, Wisconsin, Minnesota
and Indiana registered less than 55 percent, meaning they have
avoided recession by a lesser margin.
   New England, says Sindlinger, is in the deepest recession, with
a reading of only 38.4 percent. Five Rocky Mountain states and 12
Southeastern states are also listed in poor shape.
   The rest, except for the Midwest states and Washington, are in
shallower recessions, Sindlinger says.
   Using more conventional yardsticks, Yardeni sees no sign of a
credit crunch in the short-term loan data. Clearly, he says,
short-term credit continues to expand.
   ``If there is a credit crunch out there, we should see it,'' he
says. It would show up in the statistics. ``So far, we don't see
it.''
   But using information from another source, Sindlinger finds the
credit crunch already is here, that households are severely
pinched, and that as far as he's concerned, most of the nation is
in a recession.

<HEAD>Don't Change The Rules With The Regulators, Futures Group Pleads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A trade association of futures fund managers has stepped into
the turf battle for jurisdiction over stock-index futures with a
simple plea: if there has to be a change in regulators, at least
don't change the rules.
   The request made to members of Congress by the Managed Futures
Trade Association may be a further indication that the futures
industry is moving grudgingly toward acceptance of a change in the
federal agency with authority over index futures.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates stock
trading, has long sought jurisdiction over index futures, financial
instruments that are derived from stock prices but regulated, like
all futures contracts, by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
   Critics say the CFTC is too lax and too cozy with the futures
industry to properly safeguard the public interest.
   The Managed Futures Trading Association is a Pittsburgh-based
group representing 150 professional futures traders who manage an
estimated $8 billion in public investment funds, said Jane Martin,
executive director.
   In a letter sent earlier this month to key members of Congress,
the group's chairman, Kenneth Tropin, said the association's first
choice would be to leave index futures under the jurisdiction of
the CFTC because it has expertise that the SEC lacks in the area of
futures trading.
   But should Congress decide to transfer authority over index
futures to the SEC, Tropin said, the SEC should not be allowed to
change existing regulations that have been developed by the CFTC.
   ``Stock-index futures contracts should continue to be regulated
as futures contracts and not as equity instruments, regardless of
which regulatory agency is granted the responsibility to enforce
such laws,'' Tropin said in his letter.
   Maintaining futures-trading rules as they currently exist, he
said, ``will provide for a smooth regulatory transition and avoid
the application of potentially duplicative, disruptive and
inconsistent regulations.''
   The next congressional hearing on the issue is a scheduled May 8
session before the Senate Agriculture Committee, according to CFTC
spokesman David Gary.
   The jurisdictional issue has heated up since the 1987 stock
market crash, which some experts believe was exacerbated by
computer-driven program trading strategies involving rapid,
simultaneous trades of huge amounts of both stocks and stock-index
futures.
   Futures industry leaders contend index futures markets actually
prevented an even steeper drop in stock prices on Oct. 19, 1987,
when the Dow Jones industrial average fell 508 points.
   SEC Chairman Richard Breeden and Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady are urging Congress to give the SEC jurisdiction over
stock-index futures, which are contracts to buy and sell baskets of
stocks such as those represented by the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index.
   Chicago's world-leading futures exchanges, the Chicago Board of
Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, oppose the proposed
regulatory change. But earlier this month, top officials of the
Chicago exchanges indicated that if any change in jurisdiction
occurs, they would prefer a proposal by Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan.,
and Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, for a super-regulator that would
have authority over all stock and futures trading.

<HEAD>Impact of German Unification Small on Rest of World, Study
Suggests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The history unfolding in Eastern Europe could
have far-reaching consequences for years to come and speculation
about the impact has preoccupied investors in the world's financial
centers.
   Currencies have been bought and sold based on theories about
what will happen to various economies, particularly West Germany's.
Stocks have gained and lost as traders assess which companies will
benefit from business opportunities.
   The melding of the two Germanies, however, might not mean all
that much outside their joined borders, a new study suggests.
   ``The impact of German economic unification on other countries
is relatively modest, as the additional investment demand is not
large relative to global investment and a disproportionate share of
that investment demand is met by domestic German savings,'' says
the study by two members of the Federal Reserve Board's staff in
Washington.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Prime Minister Lothar de
Maiziere of East Germany confirmed at a meeting last week that the
two nations soon will share an economy.
   Although many details must still be worked out, there likely
will be one German economy by July 2. West Germany's agreement to
swap most East German marks for its own marks at a 1-to-1 rate
cleared the way for the process to begin. A new currency is
expected to go into circulation next autumn.
   The Fed analysts say the link ultimately will lead ``to an
acceleration of investment and growth in a united Germany, a real
appreciation of the Deutschmark, and a reduction in Germany's
current account surplus.''
   The boost in consumer demand expected to occur as the German
economies blend is one of the outgrowths of unification that will
directly affect the rest of the world.
   After plugging various assumptions into a statistical model, the
study projects that the U.S. trade deficit will contract. But
Joseph E. Gagnon, one of the authors, said the shrinkage will be
small considering the magnitude of U.S. world trade.
   The annual improvement in the U.S. current account balance will
peak at $15 billion a year after three years. The current account
is the country's broadest measure of foreign trade and includes the
exchange of goods and services as well as certain financial
transactions. It ran a deficit of $105.9 billion in 1989.
   The mark's increased value in terms of other major currencies,
particularly the dollar, also will affect Germany's trading
partners. A stronger mark will lower the bill for the foreign goods
that will be imported into Germany to satisfy the bigger consumer
appetite.
   The dismantling of barriers to trade and investment and the
enhanced efficiency of the East German economy will spur an
economic boom as the integration proceeds. Domestic West German
savings, though, are expected to be sufficient to support most of
this investment surge.
   Changes elsewhere in Eastern Europe might have greater potential
to influence economic variables in the United States.
   The study says, ``the ongoing liberalization of Eastern Europe
can be expected to have additional consequences for the United
States and other countries.''
   But it added: ``While the potential demands for investment are
much larger in the other Eastern European countries as a group, the
reduction in barriers and improvement in efficiency will proceed
more slowly in those countries than the pace assumed for East
Germany in this paper. Thus, the immediate and medium-term impact
of liberalization in Eastern Europe remains uncertain.''
   The study, ``The Global Economic Implications of German
Unification,'' is part of the Fed's international finance
discussion series. It represents the opinions of the authors only
and is not an official Fed view.
