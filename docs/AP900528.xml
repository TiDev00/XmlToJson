   American and Soviet negotiators completed a
pre-summit agreement to expand commercial air travel between the
two countries while working Monday to expand an accord to cut
long-range nuclear missiles.
   The negotiators also were trying to revive slumping talks on
reducing tanks and troops in Europe.
   A brief press notice at day's end said simply they had met for
2} hours and would continue the discussions on Tuesday. There was
no word on the outcome.
   The weekend talks at the State Department were aimed at
providing President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
with a solid basis for declaring a reversal in the U.S.-Soviet
weapons competition at their summit meeting that opens in
Washington in three days.
   Four U.S. cities and six Soviet cities will be added to current
airliner routes between the two countries under an agreement
reached Sunday and to be signed at the summit.
   U.S. officials said Monday that the agreement could quadruple
air travel between the two countries and, for the first time,
provide regular cargo service. It will allow six additional U.S.
airlines to operate as well as a new Soviet airline to participate
in service between the two nations.
   Only Pan Am and the Soviet airline Aeroflot now fly U.S.-Soviet
routes serving New York, Washington, Moscow and Leningrad.
   Additional U.S. cities to be provided service under the new
agreement are Anchorage, Alaska; Chicago, San Francisco and Miami.
The new Soviet cities are Kiev, Minsk, Magadan, Khabarovsk, Tbilisi
and Riga in Latvia.
   In addition, the two sides agreed to allow at least 100 annual
charter flights over the North Atlantic route and to consider up to
100 charters across the Pacific.
   U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
final details involved a compromise on the percentage of rubles
paid by Soviet travelers that Moscow will guarantee to convert into
U.S. dollars.
   The United States originally insisted on 15 percent while the
Soviets only wanted to guarantee to 6.5 per cent. Negotiators
settled on a compromise that 8.75 percent of the space on U.S.
airliners flying out of the Soviet Union would be purchased with
rubles convertible to dollars.
   A number of U.S. carriers have expressed interest in competing
with Pan Am for the expanded service, including Delta, United,
Alaska Air and Northwest.
   The two countries' arms control negotiating teams met in three
sessions Sunday totaling 6{ hours. While the Soviets awaited
further instructions from Moscow, the U.S. delegation headed by
Under Secretary Reginald Bartholomew met separately Monday.
   The Soviet delegation, led by Deputy Prime Minister Viktor P.
Karpov, an experienced arms control negotiator, initially was sent
here to take up a half-dozen unsettled strategic weapons reduction
issues.
   But a U.S. official, declining to be identified, said the talks
also were dealing with cuts in U.S. and Soviet troops, tanks,
artillery and airplanes in Europe. There was no word from officials
on either side on the results.
   A three-sentence notice to the press Sunday night said the
delegations had met from 11 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., resumed at 3:30 p.m.
for two hours, and met a third time from 7:30 p.m. until 9:30 p.m.
   Meanwhile, in another sign of U.S.-Soviet cooperation, U.S.
officials said on Monday the Soviets had recently informed the Bush
administration that they would begin dismantling the Krasnoyarsk
radar facility in eastern Siberia.
   ``We recently saw signs that this is going on,'' said one of the
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Reagan administration, in two reports to Congress, said the
installation violated the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty which
imposes strict limits on radar.
   After protesting initially, the Soviets eventually relented and
said they would correct the infraction by dismantling the facility.
   The treaty limits U.S. and Soviet anti-missile defenses on the
theory a potential aggressor would hesitate to launch a first
strike rather than face devastating retaliation
   Bush and Gorbachev are due to make a declaration at the summit
that U.S. and Soviet long-range missiles, bombers and submarines
will be reduced as part of a treaty scheduled for completion by the
end of the year.
   The holiday weekend talks were designed to expand the
declaration to cover weapons still in dispute and to determine how
to verify compliance with the pact.
   Among the issues are whether restrictions are to be imposed on
Soviet Backfire bomber and whether to bar the Soviets from
modernizing their SS-18 intercontinental ballistic missiles.
   Under the proposed treaty the Soviets would cut their arsenal of
the heavy ground-based missiles from 308 to 154. However, Secretary
of State James A. Baker III tentatively agreed in talks May 16-19
in Moscow to permit some new flight tests and limited production of
replacement missiles under the numerical ceiling.
   The trip by Baker involved concessions on both sides while
settling long-standing disputes over air-launched and sea-launched
cruise missiles.
   Last Friday, Gorbachev warned at a news conference in Moscow
that he might review his arms control policies if the United States
and its allies insist that a unified Germany belong to the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   U.S. officials, demanding anonymity, said Gorbachev gave a
similar warning privately to Baker to explain a slowdown in
negotiations over another treaty _ to cut U.S. and Soviet troops
and tanks in Europe.
   However, Gorbachev sent the delegation headed by Karpov here in
an apparent effort to maintain the momentum of Baker's talks in
Moscow.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said Friday
he had been told by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
that the Soviets were ``keen on concluding these negotiations
soon.''
   The Soviets are apprehensive about a stronger Germany,
especially since their allies in the Warsaw Pact have been showing
signs of easing away from the Soviet orbit.

<HEAD>White Breaks Long Silence On Reason For Controversial Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Breaking a long silence, former Boston Mayor Kevin
White said an aborted 1981 birthday party for his wife was designed
to raise funds to supplement his salary.
   The party was ostensibly organized to honor White's wife,
Kathyrn, but White said Sunday during a television interview it
``was an idea artificially hatched to make up for a problem. The
problem was I could barely survive on my salary.''
   The ex-mayor said the establishment of the party fund was not
improper, but when the process appeared to be ``abused'' and ``it
was wrong,'' he called it off.
   White, a Democrat, angrily denied charges of corruption at the
time, but they played an important role in his decision not to run
for re-election in 1981. He had served 16 years as mayor.
   The party was investigated by the State's Ethics Commission and
the U.S. attorney's office. White was censured, but not fined.
   White's statements on WHDH-TV's ``Boston Common'' program
contradicted the testimony by Carolyn Galvin Connors, Mrs. White's
sister, who said the idea for the birthday party came from their
mother.
   Connors eventually received more than $100,000 checks from
people she did not invite, The Boston Globe reported Monday.
   Theodore V. Anzalone, the former mayor's chief fund-raiser, was
charged in connection with a money-laundering scheme which
prosecutors claim was linked to the party. Anzalone's conviction
for currency law violations was later overturned.
   White said Sunday he was making $40,000 a year as mayor. ``I was
living on $40,000 a year for 10 years with no raise,'' he said.
   He said being ``mayor was my life. So this was an artificial way
in which some kind of fund probably could be established.''
   White's salary was increased by $25,000 to $65,000 less than
four months before the date scheduled for the April 1981 party.

   A schism developed in New York's troubled
Republican Party on the eve of today's convention to nominate a
challenger to Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   Only last week did GOP leaders find a candidate in little-known
economist Pierre Rinfret. Then on Monday, conservative Republican
Herbert London handed the party a new problem by refusing to be
Rinfret's running mate.
   Instead, the New York University professor said he hoped to run
for governor as the candidate of the state's tiny but influential
Conservative Party.
   ``I think this is a year for a crusade. This is a year to attack
both the Republican and the Democratic parties,'' London said.
   Normally, Republicans and Conservatives agree on a ticket. A
split would make it easier for Cuomo to win his expected
re-election bid for a third four-year term.
   Michael Long, state chairman of the Conservative Party, welcomed
London. ``I'm tickled pink,'' he said. ``This is not going to be a
campaign, but a crusade for the middle class, the working taxpayer,
to retake New York.''
   London's decision came one day before the start of the
Republicans' three-day convention in this community north of New
York City.
   Cuomo is considered a potential 1992 presidential contender _ if
he's not upset in his bid for re-election. Democrats meet next week
to nominate him.
   The governor's advisers have taken delight in the Republicans'
problems in finding someone to challenge Cuomo.
   ``They've made it so clear that they're reaching to the bottom
of the barrel,'' said Andrew Cuomo, the governor's son and chief
political adviser. ``Why should anyone give them credibility?''
   London admitted he has little chance of winning but said his
candidacy is ``a way of putting the Republican Party on notice.''
   He has maintained that his conservative views, including his
anti-abortion stance, are unacceptable to the state GOP leadership.
Rinfret is reported to be pro-choice, as is Cuomo. Rinfret has
refused interviews.
   ``Everyone has to do what they have to do,'' Elizabeth DelTorto,
a spokeswoman for state GOP Chairman J. Patrick Barrett, said of
London's move.
   Rinfret, 66, heads an economics consulting firm and has never
run for office. He was an unpaid adviser to Presidents Kennedy,
Johnson and Nixon.
   London, 51, ran a brief and little-noticed campaign for the GOP
nomination for mayor of New York last year.
   Barrett said a major factor in his support for Rinfret is his
willingness to spend his own money on the race _ up to $500,000 by
one report _ and his ability to raise money on Wall Street.

<HEAD>A Year After Tiananmen, Chinese Students in US Less Politically
Active</HEAD>

   A year after the massacre that left their friends
dead and bloodied on Tiananmen Square, the fervor of last June has
faded and many Chinese students in the United States have put away
their protest signs and reopened their books.
   Chinese students here still push for democratic reforms, but
many are split over what road the movement should take. And some
former activists even suggest their counterparts in China pushed
the government too far and are partly responsible for the infamous
crackdown.
   Xu Chenggang, 38, a graduate student in economics at Harvard
University, watched the televised images of the tanks rolling into
the Gates of Heavenly Peace, as the square is called in Chinese.
   He saw his friends maimed and killed. Like many others, he was
roused to action.
   ``In that time, in my mind, the most important thing was to stop
the killings, so I got very active and emotional,'' Xu said. ``For
two months, I went to rallies and meetings.''
   Then came a change of heart. Xu returned to his studies.
   ``I realized it was impossible to overthrow the government,'' he
said. ``I think I thought it would be better to view this as a long
historical movement.''
   The 7-week-old democracy movement was crushed the night of June
3-4 when the Chinese government ordered troops to capture Tiananmen
Square. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, were killed in the ensuing
chaos.
   Xu admires the courage and persistence of the students in the
democracy movement. He thinks, however, their influence is limited,
and he lays part of the blame for the deaths at their feet.
   ``They were too uncompromising, they were not organized and they
pushed the government too far,'' Xu said. ``The fault is the
government's, but the students should have foreseen what would
happen.''
   Pei Minxin, 32, a doctoral student in political science at
Harvard who remains politically active, said perhaps 80 percent of
the 40,000 Chinese students in the United States took part in
protests against their government after the Tiananmen massacre.
   Now, he admits, that number has dropped by at least half.
   ``They have to be students first _ not activists first,'' Pei
said. ``Chinese students work in labs, they teach, and all that
takes away time from activism.''
   But while the democracy movement has lost steam, it has not
stopped.
   Student dissidents who escaped China after Tiananmen continue
their work. Prominent activist Wu'er Kaixi, for instance, has moved
from the Boston area to Paris, where he works with a pro-democracy
organization, Pei said.
   Some protest groups begun last spring have become going concerns.
   With its phone bank, fax machine and computers, the student-run
China Information Center in Newton, Mass., served as the main
communications link between protesters in this country and in
Tiananmen during the uprising.
   Now the center's staff is busy creating an archive with
artifacts and video footage from China's democracy movement, as
well as a computer database for student activists in this country.
Last fall, the center incorporated.
   ``People still think demonstrations are the only way to go
forward. We don't believe that,'' said Liu Yuan, its president.
``We want to open a debate. We think this is what we can do.''
   In Chicago, students produce a half-hour radio show each day
with news otherwise censored by the Chinese government. The show is
broadcast from stations near China and reaches up to 70 percent of
the country, said Li Sanyuan, one's of the show's founders.
   The broadcast gets its news from U.S. newspapers and from
sources inside China. A typical show recently carried a report of a
factory strike in the city of Chongqing in south-central China.
   ``The government wants to tell people all the good things, but
they might not be true,'' Li said. ``In certain places, people
don't have food anymore. That information could trigger
pro-democracy movement.''
   A pro-democracy newspaper set up by Chinese journalists and
students in Los Angeles has a circulation of 30,000 and is
published every 10 days. It is distributed in China and several
Western nations.
   ``We get into China three ways _ fax, mail and smuggling,'' said
editor-in-chief Ben Tang. ``We are in at least 20 major cities
there.''
   Many students, however, continue to be frightened to speak up,
both because they want to return home someday and because they fear
reprisals against loved ones in China, Pei said.
   The students' fears were heightened recently by reports from a
Chinese bureaucrat who defected to the United States. He said the
Communist Party planned to send officials to U.S. college campuses
to court sympathetic students and intimidate the Chinese activists.
   ``They saw what happened in China. They know politics is a risky
business,'' Pei said. ``We lost quite a large number of people,
especially after the new revelations.''
   Pei said students no longer believe change will take China by
storm as it has Eastern Europe, so their concerns are less urgent
than last spring and their goals have become long-term.
   Key issues now are economic sanctions against China and whether
the country will continue to enjoy favorable trading status with
the United States, he said.
   Here, there is disagreement. Some students said they support
strong economic sanctions against China for the crackdown. Xu,
however, said sanctions would hurt fledgling entrepreneurs and
joint business ventures with the West.
   ``Joint ventures are really good things,'' Xu said. ``Removing
those things would remove the seeds of the revolution.''
   Pei said student emotions ``have cooled a little bit since last
June. Some people say tough sanctions, others say less. People
differ on how the movement should proceed.''
   The students do agree that the long march toward democracy in
China began in earnest last June 4.
   ``Before last spring, democracy as a goal was illegitimate,''
Pei said. ``Now it's been branded by blood into the national
consciousness.''
   The gains made, they also note sadly, came at a high price both
for the students who stood in the square that night and those who
stood with them from afar.
   ``I'm one of the so-called extreme counterrevolutionaries,''
said Pei, whose parents, sisters and brother are back home in
Shanghai. ``It would be suicidal to go back.''

   The party's over for some 1,000 passengers on
a luxury liner that ran aground in the Delaware Bay.
   The cheering passengers arrived on land by ferry Monday night,
their luxury cruise nearly two days late and 100 miles short of its
destination.
   ``It wasn't a bad party,'' said a female passenger who was met
by friends and family at dockside.
   The ferry Delaware brought the passengers from the stranded
642-foot Regent Star to shore at 10:17 p.m. The luxury liner was
originally scheduled to dock in Philadelphia at 8 a.m. Sunday.
   The cheering subsided quickly when officials informed the
passengers that transferring them to buses would take another two
or three hours.
   Dorothy Klausmeyer and Mary Poniaoski of Baltimore were able to
leave quickly because friends and family met them.
   They said the adventure was a bit frightening at first, but said
passengers quickly adjusted, with help from free food and drink.
   Other passengers were not immediately available to a group of
waiting reporters because buses drove onto the ferry and boarded
people while on the ship.
   Buses were standing by to take passengers back to their cars,
which were at airports and bus stations in Washington, D.C.,
Philadelphia and the New York City area.
   The ship got stuck on the sand bar early Sunday after a small
fire knocked out power. It was carrying 1,360 people, about 300 of
whom were crew members.
   Nobody was in danger during the two days atop the sand bar, said
Coast Guard spokesman Lt. James Weakley.
   Ann Burguieres, a spokeswoman for Regency Cruises, said ship
officials had described the mood on board as jovial, with free food
and drinks being served.
   ``It's more of an inconvenience factor,'' she said. ``They're
always well stocked. There is always plenty of food and drink on a
cruise.''
   Coast Guard spokesman Dave Oney confirmed, ``The ship had plenty
of food and water, and also party conveniences.''
   When the lights went out in the disco, passenger Kathleen
Hopkins said, ``everybody was singing `Hot, hot hot,''' and later
sang Christmas carols and played an improvised version of ``The
Newlywed Game.''
   ``People started chanting `Drinks, drinks drinks,''' and free
mimosas started flowing, Hopkins said.
   Another passenger, Barbara Sowden of Wilmington, Del., said by
phone: ``It just gave us a great opportunity to party hardy a
little longer. We don't need a band, we make our own music.''
   The Regent Star, sitting a mile off Fortescue, N.J., had been in
the final leg of a seven-day cruise from Montego Bay, Jamaica, when
it ran aground.
   The ferry Delaware, which normally runs between Lewes, Del., and
Cape May, N.J., was pressed into service during the busy Memorial
Day weekend when the Coast Guard determined that pushing the Regent
Star off the sand bar would increase the risk of a fuel spill.
   Oney said the ship's anchor was believed to be under the hull
and could puncture the fuel tanks. The ship carried 30,000 gallons
of diesel fuel and 240,000 gallons of fuel oil, he said. None had
leaked as of Monday evening.
   The fuel would have to be transferred to higher tanks before
another effort could be made to free the ship, Oney said.
   Tugboats had tried to move the liner Sunday but failed.
   It was the ship's first trip up the Delaware Bay. The Regent
Star usually stays in the Carribbean, Burguieres said, but was
brought north for a series of summer cruises between New York and
Montreal.

   Soviet troops sent to Armenia to quell ethnic
unrest killed at least 20 people in gun battles with Armenian
nationalists in and around the republic's capital, an Interior
Ministry spokesman said today.
   The violence exploded in Yerevan as additional Interior Ministry
troops arrived in the city.
   A mass rally was scheduled for today by the Armenian National
Movement to commemorate Armenia's 1918 declaration of independence,
said Satenik Paramadjan, a spokesman for the movement. Armenia was
annexed by the Soviet Union in 1920.
   The Armenian government and the republic's Communist Party
declared Tuesday a day of mourning, Radio Yerevan said in a report
monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. in London.
   Rafael Popyan, a leader of the Armenian National Movement, said
there were several clashes in Yerevan and its outskirts late Sunday
and this morning.
   Soviet soldiers ``just came into the city shooting,'' he said.
   The first clash occurred Sunday when Soviet troops returning
from a patrol were fired upon by Armenian militants at Yerevan's
main railroad station, said Soviet Interior Ministry spokesman Yuri
Makarov.
   The soldiers returned the gunfire, killing five of the
attackers, Makarov said. A sixth militant died later at a hospital.
   Makarov said 20 Soviet soldiers were wounded in the shootout.
The official Tass news agency said one civilian bystander was also
hospitalized with bullet wounds.
   An Armenian National Movement spokesman disputed the official
version of the clash, saying the Soviet soldiers had started it by
opening fire on a group of Armenians.
   After the railway station shootout, unrest continued throughout
the day in Yerevan as crowds in the thousands roamed the streets,
according to a duty officer at the Armenian National Movement
headquarters in Yerevan contacted by telephone.
   The bloodiest clash occurred as a convoy of 15 armored personnel
carriers headed toward the city center from a nearby base, Popyan
said. He said Soviet troops opened fire on a crowd of people who
attempted to block the road the convoy was traveling on with a
barricade of parked cars.
   According to a preliminary report, 14 civilian gunmen were
killed and more than 30 injued in the clash at the barricade,
Makarov said.
   A busload of Soviet soldiers also fired on the headquarters of
the Armenian National Movement early this morning, killing a person
sleeping in a car outside, members of the movement said in a
telephone interview.
   ``No one inside was injured, but an activist who was sleeping in
his parked car was shot dead,'' Paramadjan said.
   There was no immediate confirmation of the death from Soviet
authorities.
   The clashes were the latest outbreak of violence in the tense
Caucasus republic, but the incidents marked the first time the
clashes spread to a public place in Yerevan.
   Tass said the railway station shootout began after the soldiers
were attacked by about 15 armed men as they were returning from
escorting a passenger train to Kafan, 120 miles southeast of
Yerevan.
   The southeastern corner of Armenia near Kafan has become one of
the tensest areas in the dispute between Armenians and Azerbaijanis
over control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region.
   Armenia has been locked in a bitter dispute for more than two
years with Azerbaijan over control of Nagorno-Karabakh. That region
is predominantly ethnic Armenian, but legally belongs to Azerbaijan.
   Several hundred people have been killed and hundreds of
thousands forced to flee their homes in more than two years of
ethnic attacks and clashes involving civilians and soldiers.
   Soviet soldiers are stationed in both republics to quell
violence, but militants on both sides see the troops as an
occupying force.
   Sunday's violence came three days after militants fired on
soldiers at military checkpoints and on a patrol in
Nagorno-Karabakh, killing one serviceman and wounding four. Tass
said soldiers killed one attacker and wounded six in the incidents.
   On Friday, the general commanding the Interior Ministry troops
told Tass that he was trying to end the strife in Armenia by
political means.
   But Col. Gen. Yuri Shatalin warned ``the Interior Ministry
troops were ready to carry out the responsible task of disarming
armed detachments in the republic.''

   Populist Boris N. Yeltsin renewed his bid for the
presidency of the Russian republic today and offered to create a
coalition government with his conservative opponents.
   Yeltsin, speaking to the 1,060-member Russian Congress, which
will choose the republic's president, invited members of the
Communist Party bloc and others to ``work out a deal that would
please the majority of Russian deputies.''
   Russia, the largest of the Soviet Union's 15 republics,
stretches from the Baltic to the Pacific and includes Moscow and
many major cities. Its language predominates in the Soviet Union
and it contains much of the Soviet Union's wealth of natural
resources.
   Yeltsin also called on the Congress to reject the central Soviet
government's program for a transition to a partial market economy,
which was announced last week.
   ``The Congress must take the citizens of Russia under its
defense,'' he said.
   The plan, which will double food prices, has set off widespread
panic buying, and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev went on
television Sunday night to try to calm fears.
   Gorbachev, who opposes Yeltsin's plan to give the republic more
autonomy, has urged the Russian congress not to elect Yeltsin.
   Yeltsin's main rival is Krasnodar regional Communist Party chief
Ivan Polozkov. Neither received the required majority of 531 votes
in rounds of voting on Friday and Saturday.
   Polozkov was among the nominees again today, as was Russian
Premier Alexander Vlasov, who had dropped out during last week's
nominations.
   Some lawmakers said Yeltsin's coalition offer might give him the
votes he needed to win election.
   Discontent over the central Soviet government's economic program
also boosted Yeltsin's chances, said one of his backers, lawmaker
Leonid Gurevich of Murmansk.
   ``I think he has even more support because during the break on
Sunday, many deputies had a chance to talk to their voters and saw
the greater tension resulting from price rises and empty stores,''
said Gurevich.
   Some economists have estimated that up to 40 million people
could lose their jobs as a result of the reforms, expected to drive
many inefficient businesses into bankruptcy.
   Under the three-step reform plan, to be implemented through
1995, 60 percent of state enterprises would be sold to the public
sector, and controls would be lifted on 60 percent of prices. Other
prices would remain under state control.

   A still-unexplained problem has
developed with a computerized display unit in space shuttle
Columbia, but it is not expected to delay this week's launch, a
NASA official said today.
   Technicians replaced the so-called ``heads-up display,'' which
projects data used by the shuttle's commander during landing, on
Sunday night, but that did not fix the problem. NASA tried to
determine today what was wrong with the display unit's related
equipment.
   ``That's really our only real problem. Everything else is going
very smoothly,'' NASA test director Al Sofge said at a morning
briefing.
   Columbia is scheduled to lift off at 12:38 a.m. EDT Wednesday.
   After the unit was removed, it tested normally and the
replacement unit was not working, prompting NASA officials to
suspect a related piece of equipment _ the display unit's
electronics package, Sofge said.
   Sofge said officials should know by midday whether the problem
indeed lies with that electronics package. If necessary,
technicians will replace the device, about the size of a
videocassette recorder and located in the middeck.
   It will take about eight hours to replace the electronics
package and another eight hours to test it, Sofge said. That work
can be performed while other countdown procedures continue, he said.
   There is ``a very remote possibility'' the problem could lie
with yet another part, the display unit's power control assembly,
but even that wouldn't necessarily delay the launch, Sofge said.
   ``If it turns out that it is the PCA, we still think we can go
ahead and change that out and make the launch date,'' he said.
   The mission already has been delayed two weeks because of
repairs to the shuttle's cooling system at the launch pad.
   Columbia's seven astronauts, meanwhile, say they are eager to
get started on a mission to explore high-energy ultraviolet light
and X-rays emitted from stars and galaxies.
   ``Everything's big on this mission,'' Columbia commander Vance
Brand said Sunday. ``We have a big crew. We have a lot of days on
orbit, nine or 10, and we think a lot of good and important things
to do.''
   The crew _ the biggest since the 1986 Challenger explosion _
arrived late Sunday morning in five trainer jets from Johnson Space
Center in Houston. The countdown began as planned at 1 a.m. Sunday.
   ``We know we have a great ship, and we're ready to go,'' Brand
said.
   Air Force forecasters were predicting an 80 percent chance of
favorable weather at launch time.
   Columbia will be carrying a $150 million observatory called
Astro that will be operated round-the-clock by four crew members
who are astronomers. Astro's three ultraviolet telescopes and one
X-ray telescope will scan space from Columbia's payload bay as the
shuttle orbits 218 miles above Earth.
   Because of the flight's duration, five sets of fuel storage
tanks will be used instead of the customary three to provide power
to the orbiting shuttle, Leinbach said.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration loaded the
on-board tanks with liquid oxygen and hydrogen this morning.
   Technicians on Sunday finished restocking the X-ray telescope
with argon, needed to keep its heat-sensitive instruments cold.
Columbia has six days in which to lift off, after which the flight
will be delayed a week so more argon can be added.
   It will be the first mission since 1985 to use components of
Spacelab, a research facility designed for orbiting shuttles.
Crewmen will use Spacelab computers in the rear flight deck to
operate Astro, anchored in the payload bay.
   No spacewalks are planned, although astronauts Mike Lounge and
Jeffrey Hoffman are prepared to venture outside the cabin if one of
the telescopes needs repairs or readjustment.
   Astro will probe ultraviolet light and X-rays emitted from
stars, the Comet Austin and other matter in space. Little is known
about those kinds of radiation because the wavelengths cannot
penetrate the atmosphere and thus cannot be studied from the ground.

   Masked gunmen shot and killed two
Australian tourists traveling in a British-registered car in what
appeared to be a case of mistaken identity by the Irish Republican
Army, authorities said today.
   The attack Sunday apparently was targeted at British military
personnel based in nearby West Germany, but the victims had no
military connections, said Alan Patterson, a spokesman for the
British Army on the Rhine.
   The two men, the wife of one and girlfriend of the other had
just dined at a nearby Italian restaurant when three masked gunmen
sped up in their car and attacked with automatic weapons, said
Roermond Police Chief J. Kuijpers.
   One of the slain men was standing outside the tourists' car and
the other was sitting inside it with the women, who escaped injury,
police said.
   In Canberra, Australia, the Department of Foreign Affairs
identified the men as Nick Spanos of Sydney, and Stephen Melrose of
Brisbane, both 24. The women were identified as Melrose's wife,
Lyndal, and Spanos' girlfriend, Vicky Coss.
   ``This has all the hallmarks of an IRA attack,'' Britain's armed
forces minister, Archie Hamilton, said in a statement released in
London today.
   ``My deepest sympathy is with the families of those who have
been killed in this despicable act upon defenseless people. This is
typical of the IRA's total lack of regard for human life.''
   National Police spokesman Louis Steens also said the style and
location of the assault pointed to IRA gunmen, who have carried out
other attacks on British troops in the area, frequented by British
soldiers stationed at bases in nearby West Germany, a 10- to
15-minute drive away.
   ``We've had it confirmed by the Dutch police that the victims
were not British service personnel,'' but may have become targets
because of their British-registered car, Patterson said from
British Army headquarters in Moenchengladbach, West Germany.
   Australian Embassy spokesman John Monfries said the two couples
were just driving through Roermond, ``perhaps on a weekend trip.''
   The shooting ccurred in the city's historic market square.
Police immediately alerted all crossing points on the relatively
open West German and Belgian borders, Steens said.
   One victim was shot in the street as he prepared to take a
picture, while the other was hit in the back seat of the Citroen
car, whose rear side window was shattered by bullets.
   ``I heard the shots as the bullets hit the windows. It all
happened very quickly. There was a man with a machine gun standing
in the square firing at the car,'' said restaurant owner Paul
Reyngoud, who saw the attack.
   ``I saw two women running away from the car, shouting and
screaming for help. One of them was sobbing and shouted that she
had been married for only nine months,'' Reyngoud said.
   In addition to the man firing the shots, ``there were two other
men in the car. They were all dressed completely in black, black
shirts and black trousers with balaclava helmets,'' he said.
   Police in the Belgian town of Leopoldsburg, 35 miles from
Roermond, later found the gutted wreck of a Mazda sedan used by the
attackers.
   Last year, IRA gunmen shot and killed two dependents of British
servicemen stationed in West Germany in attacks aimed at the
soldiers themselves.
   In May 1988, the IRA claimed responsibility for the deaths of
three Royal Air Force enlisted men in two coordinated attacks in
Roermond and Nieuwbergen, 30 miles to the north.
   The almost exclusively Catholic Irish Republican Army is
fighting to push the British out of Protestant-dominated Northern
Ireland, join it with the Republic of Ireland and set up an
all-Ireland socialist state.

   President Saddam Hussein warned Israel
today that Iraq will use ``weapons of total destruction'' against
the Jewish state if it attacks Iraq with similar weapons.
   Saddam spoke at the opening session of an emergency Arab League
summit to muster support for what he says is a Western and Israeli
campaign against his country. The summit will also seek ways to
stem the large-scale emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel.
   ``We declare that if Israel commits aggression and attacks, then
we will hit back strongly,'' Saddam said.
   ``If Israel uses weapons of total destruction, then we will use
weapons of total destruction against it and we will never give up
Palestine,'' he said.
   He did not specify what weapons he was talking about, but the
Arabs claim the Israelis have up to 200 nuclear weapons. Iraq has
been building an arsenal of long-range missiles capable of hitting
Israel.
   Saddam has said Baghdad has stocks of binary chemical weapons,
and in March he threatened to use them against the Jewish state if
attacked.
   Today he accused the United States of financing and encouraging
``Israeli aggression and expansionism.''
   ``The United States bears a basic and primary responsibility for
the policy ... practiced by the Zionist entity against the Arabs,''
he said, speaking in Baghdad's ornate conference center.
   King Hussein of Jordan, one of Saddam's closest allies, appealed
to Arab leaders to help his Hashemite kingdom revive its wavering
economy and buttress its military power.
   The Arab League meeting comes days before the summit in
Washington between President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, and the Arab leaders were expected to draft a letter to
the superpower leaders.
   Conference sources said Arab foreign ministers appeared in
agreement that the letter should urge Gorbachev to block the
expected emigration of as many as 750,000 Soviet jews to Israel
over the next few years.
   The Arabs fear many Soviet Jews will settle in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, which the Palestinians
proclaimed their homeland in 1988. Jordan, which neighbors the West
Bank, is concerned large-scale Jewish settlement in the region will
drive Palestinians into Jordan and destabilize the kingdom.
   The summit was intended to be a show of Arab unity, but
divisions and rivalries were apparent.
   There was disagreement between the hard-liners led by Saddam and
the moderates, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia, over how tough a
line they should take against the United States.
   The conference was boycotted by Syrian President Hafez Assad,
Saddam's archrival in the Arab world, and by President Elias Hrawi
of Lebanon. Syrian troops control two-thirds of Hrawi's war-torn
country.
   Morocco, Algeria and Oman were represented by senior government
officials.
   Assad said he would not attend the summit held in the capital of
his Arab rival because it was too hastily convened without a proper
agenda addressing the myriad problems facing the Arab world.
   The opening of the summit was delayed by an abortive last-minute
attempt by Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi to persuade Assad to
attend the conference in the name of Arab unity.
   Gadhafi arrived in Baghdad on a flight from Damascus, the Syrian
capital, at midday today without Assad or any other Syrian
representative, Libyan diplomats reported.
   Syria and Iraq are ruled by rival wings of the Arab Socialist
Baath Party. Assad has stonewalled Arab bids to end his 11-year-old
feud with Saddam, a major obstacle to Arab efforts to forge a new
unity.
   Contrary to tradition, the opening statements by the 15 kings,
sheiks and presidents attending the conference were not broadcast.
   A 16-page U.S. State Department memorandum delivered to the 21
Arab League foreign ministers last week touched off an uproar by
urging the leaders to avoid ``excessively ardent language,'' focus
on direct Arab-Israeli peace talks and avoid denunciations of
Soviet Jewish emigration.
   The memorandum also accused Iraq of violating international
conventions banning the use of chemical and biological weapons.
   In Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's aide, Avi
Pazner quoted Shamir Sunday as saying he hoped the summit would
``not pour fuel on to the fire, but to the contrary will also
contribute to improving the atmosphere, maybe by agreeing to
negotiations with Israel.''

   Burma's military government conceded today
that the leading opposition party appeared headed for victory in a
nationwide election and promised to relinquish power once a new
constitution was approved.
   But observers have said that process could take years, and one
government official indicated the military government might
restrict the actions of the new Parliament.
   Officials at the National League for Democracy headquarters said
unofficial returns from Sunday's election showed they won 230 of
the 485 seats in the National Legislature. The vote was the first
multiparty election in 30 years.
   In an earlier statement, Col. Ye Htut, a spokesman for the
military junta, told reporters that unofficial returns showed the
League carrying 100 of the 485 constituencies by a two-thirds
majority.
   The latest official tally announced by state radio said the
League had won 18 constituencies, while the pro-military National
United Party had yet to win any. Two smaller pro-democracy parties
each won one constituency.
   Final results will take up to three weeks to compile.
   The military rulers called Sunday's elections but banned the
League's two top officials from participating. One is under house
arrest, the other in jail. The party says hundreds of other members
are also imprisoned.
   Diplomats and other analysts have said the government's main
goal in holding the elections is to attract foreign investment to
the impoverished country and to obtain foreign aid.
   Most foreign aid to Burma was suspended to protest the bloody
1988 military crackdown on the pro-democracy movement that left
thousands dead.
   Western diplomats contacted in Rangoon said reaction to the
early election results was tempered with caution.
   ``There is euphoria in the party but it is not so evident in the
streets,'' one diplomat said on condition of anonymity. ``Burmese
have had too many shocks in the past few years and they are waiting
to see what is the final result I think.''
   Prior to the voting, critics pointed to arrests, intimidation
and detentions of major opposition figures and expressed skepticism
about the prospects for a fair election.
   But there was relatively little violence on Election Day.
   The Working People's daily said 15 people were hurt in a grenade
attack Sunday in Thanbyuzayat, 80 miles southeast of Rangoon. It
blamed the attack on ``unscrupulous destructive elements''
attempting to disrupt the elections.
   Some dissidents from Burma's many ethnic minority groups,
fighting the central government, had called off earlier plans to
disrupt the polls.
   Ye Htut said the military rulers would step aside after
lawmakers draft and enact a new constitution and a new government
is elected under that document's laws.
   ``The army will abide by the new constitution,'' he told
reporters.
   ``It is totally up to the elected members (of the new
legislature). They can move as quickly as they like and take
power,'' said another military spokesman, Kyaw Sann.
   However, Deputy Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw told reporters the
military council may establish temporary ground rules for the
Parliament. He declined to elaborate.
   Victory celebrations by pro-democracy forces were reported in
several large cities.
   Officials of the National League for Democracy expressed hopes
for the release of their leaders, barred from participation in the
elections. Aung San Suu Kyi, the popular daughter of independence
hero Aung San, is under house arrest, and Tin Oo is in jail.
   ``It is an excellent day for Burma. We are making a new history
I hope,'' said Bahan, a executive committee member of the League.
``We had expected a win but not so much of a landslide as this.''
   ``We hope with this mandate by the people we can go on to change
to a democratic system very easily and peacefully,'' he said.
   Myint U, another League official, said the party wanted to
temporarily adopt the constitution Burma had after its independence
from Britain in 1948. From then until a military coup in 1962,
Burma had been a democratic, multiparty state.
   Sunday's election, contested by 93 political groups and 2,297
candidates, was to fill the National Legislature, which is to draft
the new constitution.

   President Bush said today he will
welcome Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev ``with open arms'' to
this week's summit, but he promised to stand firm on America's
principles about how to keep Europe stable and the world at peace.
   The president reviewed a colorful, ragtag parade of fire
engines, school bands and a veterans' brigade through Dock Square
in this seaside resort where he has spent nearly every summer of
his life. Eight veterans fired a 24-gun salute, and two buglers
from Kennebunk High School played ``Taps.''
   Bush, basking in the sunshine and surrounded by his wife,
children and grandchildren, called it a ``little piece of
Americana'' and said he was going home this afternoon to prepare
for the summit ``refurbished by this beautiful four days right here
in our beloved Kennebunkport.''
   Looking to Thursday's opening meeting with Gorbachev, Bush said,
``There's no question that we have a better chance now for a
lasting world peace, but there's still some enormous problems out
there. And this country must remain strong, we must remain
committed to the values that have made us great over the last
200-plus years.''
   ``I go to the summit with open arms to welcome the president of
the Soviet Union. But we must stand for our principles when we
discuss world peace. We must stand on our principles when we
discuss the stability in Europe or the future of the countries
around the world that yet are not free,'' he said. ``That's exactly
what I plan to do.''
   Earlier, Bush told reporters he believes Gorbachev is ``pretty
darn strong'' despite the widening economic crisis in the Soviet
Union.
   Bush, before teeing off for a final round of golf on his
four-day weekend vacation, said, ``He has enormous problems, but
it's not our business ... to sort out the other person's economic
problems. We've got some of our own.''
   Asked about the possibility of Gorbachev's being overthrown,
Bush said, ``I don't think that's my business to sort that out. I
deal with the Soviet leader that's there in place coming to the
United States to discuss these matters.''
   ``This man has survived. I've given him, I think, appropriate
credit for the dramatic changes in Eastern Europe,'' Bush said.
   ``My own personal opinion is that he's pretty darn strong
there,'' the president added.
   Gorbachev went on Soviet television Sunday night to appeal to
his countrymen for calm in the face of panic buying triggered by
Moscow's plans to double the prices of food and other goods.
   Asked if he was ready for the summit, Bush, leaning against a
golf club, smiled and said, ``I've got some more work to do, but
I'm been reading my briefing books.''
   Bush said he was ``almost through the first one, and I'll get
the second one done tonight. And then we'll have two days of
intensive consultation to bring us up to date on where we go. But I
think I know the issues.''
   Bush said he wasn't expecting any surprises form Gorbachev and
had none of his own to bring to the table.
   On a separate matter, the president was asked if he thought
sailor Clayton Hartwig was owed an apology by the Navy, which has
reopened its investigation into the explosion last year aboard the
USS Iowa that killed 47 seamen. The initial Navy report said
Hartwig, who was killed in the explosion, probably triggered it
intentionally because he was upset over the breakup of a friendship
with another sailor.
   ``If the man is proved innocent of these allegations, clearly
there should be a statement to that effect. But I can't judge it,''
said Bush.
   Bush was flying back to Washington in mid-afternoon with his
wife, Barbara, and their weekend house guest, Transportation
Secretary Samuel Skinner and his wife, Honey. Skinner also was in
Bush's early-morning foursome as they got in their last 18 holes at
the Cape Arundel Golf Club with local pro Ken Raynor and Bush
friend Spike Heminway.
   Bush teed off last after the three others hit long drives. The
president predicted his own swing would be ``like a fine
Bordeaux,'' but then topped the ball and hit it only 30 yards. He
took a second swing and lofted that ball far down the fairway.
   Bush and Gorbachev are to sign an agreement Friday to destroy
chemical weapons and outline limits on cruise missiles, which have
been an obstacle to agreement on a strategic nuclear weapons pact.
U.S. and Soviet negotiators met in Washington on Sunday to try to
expand the agreement.
   Bush acknowledged that Gorbachev ``may be mad with me over some
things.'' But he called the Soviet leader ``the kind of man you can
talk very frankly with. ... I want to narrow the differences.''
   Bush said Soviet pressure against the breakaway republic of
Lithuania is an issue that is ``troubling that I don't want to
sweep under this rug.''
   Bush was interviewed Thursday by Soviet television journalist
Valentin Zorin.
   ``If we argue, we'll do that pleasantly. He's a tough guy,''
Bush said. ``Listen, I've been around him enough to know that he
drives his point home. Well, I can do the same thing.''

<HEAD>Ten Health Groups Agree on Diet Guidelines</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You've heard it all before: To live long, eat
right. Sounds simple, but the experts all seemed to have different
ideas about what was right.
   After holding what amounted to a ``food summit'' last year, 10
health agencies _ five private and five public _ have now come up
with a list of jointly recommended dietary guidelines.
   They call it ``The Healthy American Diet,'' with six general
diet principles for everyone over the age of 2:
   _Eat a nutritionally adequate diet consisting of a variety of
foods.
   _Reduce consumption of fat, especially saturated fat and
cholesterol.
   _Achieve and maintain a reasonable body weight.
   _Increase consumption of complex carbohydrates and fiber.
   _Reduce intake of sodium.
   _Consume alcohol in moderation, if at all. Children, adolescents
and pregnant women should abstain.
   The health organizations, ranging from the American Academy of
Pediatrics to the U. S. Department of Agriculture, also recommended
that some segments of the population, mostly women and the young,
take additional measures.
   To avoid dental cavities, especially for children, the groups
recommended fluoride in drinking water and limited between-meal
snacks containing sugar. Adolescents and young women should eat
more high-calcium foods, such as low-fat dairy products.
   Children, adolescents and women of childbearing age also should
include iron-rich foods, such as red meat, fish and cereals, in
their diets in order to avoid anemia.
   Many of the groups, such as the American Heart Association,
already had recommended diets. But the experts' diets often
differed slightly from organization to organization. Dr. Alan Chait
of the University of Washington in Seattle thought it was possible
people didn't know which to follow.
   Chait, who also is chairman of the heart association's nutrition
committee, said a common message on diet recommendations should
``go a long way to reduce confusion among the public.''
   The groups' joint report said nutritional deficiencies such as
not enough vitamins used to be the nation's top dietary problem.
Now it is eating too much food of the wrong kind. Variety and
moderation, the groups said, is the key to healthy eating.
   Other groups that helped develop the guidelines are the American
Cancer Society, the American Diabetes Association, the American
Dietetic Association, the Centers for Disease Control, the National
Cancer Institute, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, and
the Department of Health and Human Services.

   A pipe bomb exploded today in an outdoor market
crowded with holiday shoppers, killing an elderly Israeli and
wounding nine, police and hospital officials said. Israeli
officials linked the blast to the start of the Arab summit.
   The bomb went off about noon in the Mahane Yehuda market in
downtown Jerusalem.
   Shimon Cohen, 72, who was struck by shrapnel in the liver, died
several hours later at Jerusalem's Shaarei Zedek Hospital, said
hospital spokeswoman Orna Cohen. She is not related to the victim.
   Immediately after the explosion, a crowd of about 200 angry
shoppers gathered near Mahane Yehuda, and dozens of Israelis tried
to attack young Palestinians who were detained by police, shouting
``death to the Arabs'' and ``burn them, burn them.''
   In one incident, a crowd of about 25 Israelis surrounded a

   A bomb believed planted by Basque
separatists exploded in a post office in this northern city early
Monday, causing slight damage but no injuries, a police spokesman
said.
   An anonymous caller telephoned a warning to the local travelers'
aid office about 10 minutes before the explosion, which came after
midnight, said a police official speaking on condition of anonymity.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility, but the spokesman
said police believed the blast was the work of the Basque
separatist organization ETA.
   ETA seeks independence from Spain for the three-province
northern Basque region.
   Since the start of its 22-year-old campaign for independence,
ETA has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people and
for many bombings.

   A bomb exploded in an office next to the
Spanish Embassy, and the official ANGOP news agency said two
children were injured.
   The explosion late Sunday in an insurance company building
shattered windows but did no serious damage. Few people were in the
area at the time because of a curfew. Officials said the embassy
did not appear to be the target.
   The rebels of Jonas Savimbi's UNITA _ the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ have claimed responsibility for four
bomb attacks this year in Luanda and have stepped up sabotage in
the area surrounding the capital.
   Previous bomb attacks have targeted military installations of
the Marxist government and the state oil company Sonangol.
   UNITA, which receives about $50 million annually in U.S. aid,
has been trying to force the government to share power since Angola
gained independence from Portugal in 1975.
   Talks to end the conflict resumed in April, but fighting
continues.

   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
   The bombs were planted under cars parked near the Athens Hilton

   The district is the site of several diplomatic missions,

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fabled Loch Ness monster is worth $42 million
in annual tourist revenues to Scotland, a published report said
Monday.
   Half a million tourists visit the Highlands lake each year in
hopes of seeing the creature, although there is no scientific proof
it exists, said The Times of London.
   It quoted Mackay Consultants of Inverness as saying the monster
myth is also good for about 2,500 tourist-industry jobs.
   ``We were amazed by the results of our research, which certainly
puts the monster forward as one of the main attractions of
Scotland,'' said a director of the firm, Tony Mackay.
   He said reports of monster sightings help keep up tourist
interest. The latest was last month, when a visitor from Glasgow
claimed to have caught a glimpse of the creature, affectionately
known as ``Nessie.''
   The legend of large creatures living in 750-foot-deep Loch Ness
has been around since the sixth century.
   One theory holds that the monster is actually a dinosaur species
called the plesiosaur, known from fossil remains as a large water
reptile with a small head, long neck, short tail and four
paddle-like limbs.
   But no such remains have been found at Loch Ness.

   Government spokesman Vyron Polydoras said the talks were

   He refused to provide any details about the expected content of
the agreement but said it would cover eight years rather than five,
as the previous pact did.
   That accord expired in December 1988.
   The new agreement will need the approval of the 300-member Greek
Parliament, but the conservative government of Premier Constantine
Mitsotakis controls enough seats to win the vote.
   The previous round of talks ended in Washington on Friday.
   The United States has four bases and 20 smaller facilities

<TEXT>
   Eleven convicted train robbers were reported
Monday to have been put to death as China continued an anti-crime
campaign that has led to dozens of executions in recent weeks.
   The official Legal Daily said a court in central China's Henan
province exercised ``the iron fist of the law'' in sentencing the
11 to death. It said the executions were immediately carried out
after the sentencing Saturday.
   The usual method of execution in China is a bullet to the back
of the head. The newspaper said those executed had carried out
robberies on major train routes, including the Beijing-Canton and
Beijing-Shanghai lines.
   Cities around China have been holding rallies to announce death
sentences or imprisonment for people caught in the current
anti-crime drive. The report said that when the train robbers were
sentenced to death, ``the masses clapped and cheered on being
avenged.''
   A Shanghai court last week sentenced 10 people to die on various
murder and robbery charges. In Canton last month, 10 people were
executed for selling tainted liquor, and 11 others were put to
death for robbery and murder after being paraded before the public.
   In March, a Shanghai court handed down 15 death sentences at one
time to people involved in robbing taxi drivers.
   China does not release capital punishment figures, but it is
estimated that more than 1,000 convicted criminals are executed
every year.

   A train packed with commuters slammed
into another train stopped in a station outside Lisbon on Monday,
killing one person and injuring more than 200 people, police said.
   The accident was on the Sintra line, one of Lisbon's two major
commuter rail routes.
   Police said a train bound for Lisbon from the suburb of Cacem
struck a standing train in the Cruz de Pedra station at about 8:45
a.m. An 80-year-old woman was killed, police said.
   Most of the injuries were not classified as serious, but Soares
Costa, director at Santa Maria hospital where most of the injured
were taken, said two people were in critical condition.
   ``It was like an earthquake when we hit,'' said Jose Muralhas, a
passenger on the moving train. He said at the time of the crash,
most people were already standing, getting ready to get off the
train.
   A spokesman for the state CP railroad company, Americo Ramalho,
said he could not confirm reports the moving train's brakes failed.
   The Lusa news agency quoted Soares Lopes, assistant director of
CP, as saying the moving train went through an amber warning signal
and a red stop light without slowing down.

<HEAD>System Designed to Create Perfect Building Climate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   University researchers have developed
an air-conditioning system they say is so sensitive it can adjust a
building's temperature according to the type of clothes the
occupants are wearing.
   The Adelaide University research team hopes the system will
revolutionize building climate controls by ensuring that office air
will never be too cold or too warm.
   The team leader, professor Sam Luxton, also believes the system
will stop the spread of respiratory infections because it
eliminates the circulation of stale bacteria-ridden air in air
conditioning.
   Three world patents have been taken out on the technology, which
is being installed in a shopping mall in central Melbourne and a
50-story building in Perth.
   Luxton said the new technology could result in energy savings of
15 percent to 40 percent.
   ``The problem with most air-conditioning systems is that air
must be cooled too much to remove moisture,'' Luxton said. ``The
result is that you either have people shivering saying it's too
cold or else saying it's stuffy and they feel they can't breathe.''
   The research team's solution involves varying the size of
components in the cooling system and, in doing so, eliminating the
need for stale air to be recirculated to keep rooms warm.
   Recirculated air, which bypasses filtering systems, is thought
to be a major carrier of bacteria that cause respiratory infections.
   Another feature of the new technology is a computer program that
allows the system to adjust the temperature according to the season.
   The way it works is a closely guarded secret, but Luxton said it
involved a ``sensing'' system, which calculates the amount of
clothes people are wearing.
   He said many air-conditioning systems are programmed to maintain
a constant temperature year-round or are adjusted manually each
season. But the set temperature may be too cold or too warm,
depending on the type of clothes being worn, he noted.
   Luxton said the technology took more than 20 years to develop.

   You've heard it all before: To live long, eat
right. Sounds simple, but the experts all seemed to have different
ideas about what was right.
   After holding what amounted to a ``food summit'' last year, 10
health agencies _ five private and five public _ have now come up
with a list of jointly recommended dietary guidelines.
   They call it ``The Healthy American Diet,'' with six general
diet principles for everyone over the age of 2:
   _Eat a nutritionally adequate diet consisting of a variety of
foods.
   _Reduce consumption of fat, especially saturated fat and
cholesterol.
   _Achieve and maintain a reasonable body weight.
   _Increase consumption of complex carbohydrates and fiber.
   _Reduce intake of sodium.
   _Consume alcohol in moderation, if at all. Children, adolescents
and pregnant women should abstain.
   The health organizations, ranging from the American Academy of
Pediatrics to the U. S. Department of Agriculture, also recommended
that some segments of the population, mostly women and the young,
take additional measures.
   To avoid dental cavities, especially for children, the groups
recommended fluoride in drinking water and limited between-meal
snacks containing sugar. Adolescents and young women should eat
more high-calcium foods, such as low-fat dairy products.
   Children, adolescents and women of childbearing age also should
include iron-rich foods, such as red meat, fish and cereals, in
their diets in order to avoid anemia.
   Many of the groups, such as the American Heart Association,
already had recommended diets. But the experts' diets often
differed slightly from organization to organization. Dr. Alan Chait
of the University of Washington in Seattle thought it was possible
people didn't know which to follow.
   Chait, who also is chairman of the heart association's nutrition
committee, said a common message on diet recommendations should
``go a long way to reduce confusion among the public.''
   The groups' joint report said nutritional deficiencies such as
not enough vitamins used to be the nation's top dietary problem.
Now it is eating too much food of the wrong kind. Variety and
moderation, the groups said, is the key to healthy eating.
   Other groups that helped develop the guidelines are the American
Cancer Society, the American Diabetes Association, the American
Dietetic Association, the Centers for Disease Control, the National
Cancer Institute, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, and
the Department of Health and Human Services.

   Marauding gunmen today killed 22
people, including a member of parliament, in a wave of bloodshed
that has gripped Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's home province,
authorities said.
   Sen. Moshin Siddiqui, a leading opposition lawmaker, was shot to
death while going to a hospital to visit survivors of sniper
attacks Sunday that left at least 40 people dead in the province's
capital and 75 wounded, police said.
   Southern Sindh Province has been hit in recent years by
kidnappings, assassinations and sniper attacks that have left more
than 2,000 people dead.
   The 65-year-old legislator's death intensified calls by his
Pakistan Moslem League and other opposition parties for the
government to declare a state of emergency in Sindh Province,
governed by Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party.
   At least 21 other people were gunned down and 40 wounded today
in sniper shootings and clashes between rival ethnic groups and
security forces deployed throughout the port city of Karachi,
authorities said.
   Authorities clamped an around-the-clock curfew in three more
districts of the city today including the area around Karachi's
international airport and deployed army troops to enforce it.
Army-supervised curfews were imposed on three other districts on
Sunday.
   Ms. Bhutto flew to Karachi tonight and may also visit Hyderabad,
the province's second-largest city, sources said on condition of
anonymity.
   Hyderabad, 150 miles to the north, has been brought to a
standstill by ethnic-related violance.
   The army rolled into the city on Sunday after security forces
opened fire on a procession of about 10,000 people who defied a
curfew imposed to stop the bloodshed. At least 60 people died and
nearly 300 were wounded, authorities said.
   The soldiers, considered a neutralizing force between rival
ethnic groups, were greeted by Hyderabad residents shouting
``Pakistan Live Forever'' from their houses.
   Authorities said the congested city was calm today for the first
time in two weeks.
   Heavily armed soldiers patrolled the streets, stood guard on
rooftops and checked all vehicles to further prevent random
shootings, which have plagued the city of 3 million since May 15
and claimed at least 135 lives.
   Military officials have said they received hundreds of letters
in recent months from Sindh residents asking the army to take
control of the province and restore law and order. Officials have
said the problem must be solved by the civilian government and not
the military.
   Police blame the current violence on a militant faction of the
Mohajir Qami Movement, a small political party representing
descendants of Moslem Indians who immigrated to Pakistan during the
1947 partition of the subcontinent.
   The Movement is demanding recognition as Pakistan's fifth
nationality, along with the Pathans, Punjabis, Baluch and Sindhis.
   Critics say the violence has escalated beyond the local
government's control.
   Opposition politicians in Parliament have repeatedly called for
the dismissal of the provincial government and declaration of a
state of emergency, a move that Ms. Bhutto's government has
resisted.
   But after today's shootings, members of Ms. Bhuttto's party said
the government shared the blame for the continuing lawlessness.
   ``Organized gangs have become the order of the day. No road in
the province is safe and safety of life cannot be assured,'' said
Makhdoom Khaleeq-uz-Zaman, a member of the National Assembly, the
law-making lower house of Parliament.
   Ms. Bhutto has acknowedged the provincial government has not
done enough to halt the iolence. But she accused neighboring India
of stirring up much of the trouble in Sindh and in the eastern
province of Punjab.
   New Delhi denies the allegations and blames Pakistan for violent
secessionists movements in the Indian Punjab and Jammu-Kashmir, its
only Moslem majority state.

   Message to Washington hostesses: Don't invite
Caspar Weinberger and Robert McFarlane to the same party.
   The two prominent personalities of the Iran-Contra period have
been engaged in unusually strident personal attacks on each other
for their respective roles during the Reagan administration.
   ``McFarlane is a man of evident limitations,'' Weinberger
writes. ``He could not hide them, but he attempted to do so by
means of an enigmatic manner, featuring heavily measured,
pretentious and usually near impenetrable prose.''
   McFarlane, in turn, derides Weinberger's newly published memoirs
as an ``astonishing, anti-intellectual, ad hominem tract; a
mean-spirited assemblage of distortions and falsities, of which I
am the chief though not the only target.''
   At issue are the recollections of both officials of the 1985-86
period when Weinberger was secretary of defense and McFarlane was
national security adviser and later a diplomatic trouble shooter on
Iran for President Reagan.
   Weinberger has written a book, ``Fighting for Peace,'' on his
years at the Pentagon. A chapter of the book was excerpted by
National Review magazine, which also published McFarlane's response.
   Weinberger portrays McFarlane as obsessed with McFarlane's plan
to try to improve relations with Iran. McFarlane was able to use
his easy access to Reagan to distort reality and to override the
objections of Weinberger and Secretary of State George P. Shultz to
the Iran initiative, Weinberger says.
   ``To the best of my knowledge, McFarlane kept these matters as
secret as possible, talking only about the advantages of a new
working relationship with Iran _ when, that is, he discussed these
initiatives at all,'' Weinberger wrote.
   McFarlane plunged ahead even though there was nothing to
indicate a significant change in Iran's attitude on the American
hostages in Lebanon or any shift in Iran's ``virulently
anti-Western, anti-American attitude,'' the former Pentagon chief
says.
   Weinberger implies that McFarlane in September 1985 approved the
Israeli transfer of American arms to Iran without Reagan's approval.
   McFarlane responds by saying the independent commission headed
by former Sen. John Tower and the Joint Congressional Committee
both concluded that Reagan did approve the transfer.
   McFarlane dismisses as an ``outright lie'' Weinberger's
assertion that McFarlane passed intelligence on Iraqi positions to
Iran during the Gulf war. He accuses Weinberger of a ``tilt''
toward Iraq, ridiculing the former defense secretary's suggestion
that Iraq had ``rational, limited aims.''
   McFarlane accepts responsibility for the error of the Iran
initiative but says Weinberger was too passive in his opposition.
   ``There is no doubt ... that if Mr. Weinberger had expressed the
depth of his apparent conviction by an offer to resign or by
resigning, the operation would have come to a halt,'' he wrote.
   He also blames Weinberger for the inability of the Reagan
administration to develop a coherent politico-military strategy.
   That, he says, was a ``direct consequence of Secretary
Weinberger's personal animus toward Secretaries of State Alexander
Haig and George Shultz and his ambition to succeed them.''
   In a brief rebuttal to McFarlane's response, Weinberger says he
finds ``absurd and breathtakingly wrong'' McFarlane's assertion
that Weinberger was a ``party to our getting into this (Iran)
quagmire.''
   The quotes that Weinberger says McFarlane manufactured cannot
change what really happened, Weinberger says.
   ``No diversionary dust in the form of easily refutable charges
about the record of others can change the history I set forth in
`Fighting for Peace,''' he writes.

<TEXT>
   Burma's main pro-democracy party said
Monday it was assured of an absolute majority following national
elections, and the military regime pledged to return power to the
people after 30 years of authoritarian rule.
   Officials of the National League for Democracy said the party
had won 241 of the 485 National Legislature seats contested Sunday.
They said an absolute majority was certain when final, official
results were compiled in about three weeks.
   The vote was Burma's first free election in three decades.
   Results of 20 district races were announced on state radio, and
the League for Democracy had won 18 of them.
   In most districts, the pro-democracy party won about 75 percent
of the votes, while the pro-military National Unity Party managed
only 10 percent to 15 percent, the radio said.
   The ruling military junta conceded that the League for Democracy
had scored a major victory in both urban and rural areas, and it
promised to relinquish power as soon as a new constitution is
approved.
   ``Any government that is formed according to the constitution
will be strong and stable. It is totally up to the elected members
(of the new legislature). They can move as quickly as they like and
take power,'' said spokesman Kyaw Sann.
   But officials of the regime said they believed the drafting of
the document would take time. They refused to speculate on how long
it could take.
   Several hundred people gathered in front of the ramshackle
headquarters of the League for Democracy, which was festooned with
strings of lights and red posters.
   ``It is an excellent day for Burma. We are making a new history,
I hope,'' said Bahan, an executive committee member of the National
League contacted in Rangoon. ``We hope with this mandate by the
people we can go on to change to a democratic system very easily
and peacefully.''
   ``We came to pray for an NLD victory,'' said one young woman
visiting the Shwedagon Pagoda, an ancient edifice with soaring
golden spires overlooking the city.
   Sunday's election was contested by 93 political groups and 2,297
candidates. It was to seat a 492-seat National Legislature, which
will draft a constitution. Balloting was carried out in 485
constituencies and postponed for security and other reasons in
seven.
   Burma's rulers called the election after suppressing a
pro-democracy uprising in 1988 in which thousands of people were
killed.
   Western diplomats contacted in Rangoon said some people's
reactions to the results were tempered with caution, given the
military's past record.
   ``There is euphoria in the party, but it is not so evident in
the streets. There is a certain buoyancy perhaps, but people aren't
exactly drinking themselves blind drunk in the streets or anything
like that yet,'' said one diplomat, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``Burmese have had too many shocks in the past few years and
they are waiting to see what is the final result, I think,'' he
said.
   The league's gains came despite the house arrest of Aung San Suu
Kyi, who helped form the party during the dramatic events of 1988,
and the imprisonment of party co-leader Tin Oo.
   ``One gets the impression that although she was not able to
contest this election, her influence, her aura, her persona have in
fact been a very dominant factor,'' Australian Ambassador Geoff
Allen said of Ms. Suu Kyi.
   ``First of all we are going to release all the political
prisoners including Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin Oo,'' Myint U, a
league official, said when asked what the party would do if it
scored a commanding victory.
   Before the election, some critics charged the vote would not be
free and fair. They noted widespread arrests, intimidation and the
detentions of major opposition figures.
   There was no official turnout given, but some unofficial
estimates in Rangoon said the turnout in the capital was more than
60 percent.
   Some observers are skeptical the military will easily hand over
control after more than a quarter-century of almost total power.
   The Australian ambassador said in an interview that the polling
had ``gone off much better than most people had anticipated,'' but
that the election as a whole had been ``flawed'' by the detentions
and other past events.
   ``What has been very encouraging is the way the Burmese people
have come out and shown in a dramatic way that they are not really
happy with the status quo ... and are basically looking for a very
different future,'' he said. ``In that way it has been a most
dramatic outcome.''

   Boris N. Yeltsin on Monday renewed his bid to
become president of Russia, the Soviet Union's largest republic,
after failing to muster enough votes in the first two rounds of
balloting.
   In the last round of voting Saturday, Yeltsin fell 28 votes
short of the 531 votes he needed in the Russian Congress. On
Friday, Yeltsin captured 497 votes.
   The populist politician told the 1,060-member Congress on Monday
he was willing to form a coalition with his opponents.
   He invited members of the Communist Party bloc and others to
``work out a deal that would please the majority of Russian
deputies.''
   Yeltsin's opponents in Tuesday's contest will be the republic's
current premier, Alexander Vlasov, and Valentin Tsoy, a
little-known businessman from the Soviet Far East.
   Vlasov has the support of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who
has urged the deputies not to elect Yeltsin.
   Russia, the largest of the Soviet Union's 15 republics,
stretches from the Baltic to the Pacific and includes Moscow and
many major cities. Its language predominates in the Soviet Union,
and the republic has more than half the country's population.
   Yeltsin called on the deputies to reject the central Soviet
government's program for a transition to a partial market economy,
which was announced last week.
   ``The Congress must take the citizens of Russia under its
defense,'' he said.
   The economic plan, which will double food prices, has set off
widespread panic buying, and Gorbachev went on television Sunday
night to try to calm fears.
   Discontent over the economic program has boosted Yeltsin's
chances, said one of his backers, lawmaker Leonid Gurevich of
Murmansk.
   ``I think he has even more support because during the break on
Sunday, many deputies had a chance to talk to their voters and saw
the greater tension resulting from price rises and empty stores,''
said Gurevich.
   Some economists have estimated that up to 40 million people
could lose their jobs as a result of the reforms, expected to drive
many inefficient businesses into bankruptcy.
   Under the three-step reform plan, to be implemented through
1995, 60 percent of state enterprises would be sold to the public
sector, and controls would be lifted on 60 percent of prices. Other
prices would remain under state control.

<HEAD>Northeast Recreation Areas Hit by Budget Cuts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   With the summer fun season under way, fewer
lifeguards, dirtier restrooms, pricier parking and litter pile-ups
threaten to mar outings in the Northeast as state recreational
areas feel the bite of budget cuts.
   Final budget figures are not yet in, but service cutbacks are
being considered in several states, including New York, Connecticut
and New Jersey. In Massachusetts, even an ersatz Henry David
Thoreau was in danger at one point of being laid off.
   Most parks will remain open, but with reduced hours and staffing.
   ``The grass is going to get a little longer and the restrooms
are going to get a little dirtier,'' said Anthony Cantele, a
Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection official.
   Most states in the region have been grappling with budget
difficulties in the past couple of years because of an economic
slowdown in fields such as real estate and finance.
   Last year, Connecticut decided to close 13 of its 92 state
parks, but public opposition spurred Gov. William O'Neill to
overrule the order. Park funds instead were cut by 8 percent. A 10
percent cut was imposed for 1990.
   The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Management, which
oversees state parks and beaches, has been tentatively allocated
$29 million for overseeing state recreation facilities this year,
down from $33.2 million just two years ago, said spokesman Peter
O'Neil.
   Along the 3.8-mile-long Salisbury state beach, fewer than than
20 lifeguards will oversee waters previously covered by 50 to 55
guards.
   Could that be dangerous? ``Absolutely,'' O'Neil said, adding
that the department was checking with attorneys about the
situation's possible liability problems.
   ``There have been no drownings when lifeguards are on duty since
1980,'' O'Neil said. ``There are 50 to 60 documented saves each
summer.''
   Massachusetts has 146 forests and parks, seven ocean beaches, 20
swimming pools and seven historical parks.
   About 80 jobs, vacant through attrition, probably will not be
filled, and O'Neil said only about 800 seasonal employees would be
hired, down from the usual 1,300.
   New Jersey, which has an extensive state park system, also faces
staff cuts because of a possible $1 million reduction in the
department's $23.4 million budget.
   Greg Marsh, New Jersey director of division of parks and
forests, said a proposed $2 increase in parking fees would
eliminate the need for layoffs.
   Some officials warn that reductions in park maintenance may harm
the envirnoment.
   ``What we're really concerned about is illegal dumping,'' O'Neil
said. ``In the past, folks would see someone in uniform and keep on
going. Now, they might not keep on going.''
   Marsh also fears increased litter problems. A small pile of
trash at the side of a road attracts a large pile quickly, he said,
adding that park rangers will urge campers to carry their own trash
from campsites.
   New York's 150 state parks, which include 65 campgrounds, will
be open, but with reduced hours, said parks department spokesman
Robert Arnold.
   Budget woes almost forced Massachusetts to halt a Walden Pond
summer program that hires a tour guide to play famed naturalist
Henry David Thoreau, O'Neil said.
   The guide ``IS Henry David Thoreau,'' always speaking in the
present tense when he tells visitors about the life of the famous
philosopher, O'Neil said. ``We now think he's going to be back.''

   A major early painting by Peter Paul Rubens,
``The Fall of Phaeton,'' will go on permanent display at the
National Gallery of Art on Wednesday _ the 350th anniversary of the
death of the 17th century Flemish master of the Baroque.
   The 3-by-4 oil, which depicts a dramatic scene from Greek
mythology, was bought by the gallery last year from an undisclosed
private collection in London for a sum that director J. Carter
Brown described only as in the multimillion-dollar range.
   The painting was cleaned to restore its original colors to their
former brilliance, and joins the eight other works from Rubens'
later period in the National Gallery's permanent collection in the
West Building.
   Except for its inclusion in an exhibition in Cologne, West
Germany, in 1977, before it was cleaned, ``The Fall of the
Phaeton'' had never been displayed publicly.
   Little is known of its ownership since Rubens painted it in 1605
while studying in Italy.
   Brown and Arthur Wheelock, the gallery's curator of northern
Baroque painting, said the painting is important because of what it
tells about Rubens in the early, formative stage of his development
as the greatest Baroque artist.
   ``This was the springboard of his career into full-blown
Baroque,'' said Brown, who praised the painting's ``extraordinary
command of three-dimensional space'' and a sophisticated
composition that conveys ``swing and power and grandeur.''
   The painting shows a scene from Ovid's ``Metamorphoses'' in
which Apollo's son is thrown from his horse-drawn chariot in the
heavens by a blinding thunderbolt hurled by Jupiter.
   Wheelock said the cleaning revealed pink hues not previously
seen in the painting, and an X-ray examination by gallery
conservators showed that Rubens had painted over one figure in the
lower right-hand corner of the scene.
   Brown also announced the acquisition of the gallery's first work
by the 17th century Dutch painter Aert van der Neer, a nocturnal
landscape titled ``Moonlit Landscape with Bridge'' that was painted
in 1650.
   Both the Rubens and Van der Neer paintings were bought with
income from the gallery's permanent acquisition fund.

   The effort to shove a grounded luxury cruise
liner off a sand bar in the Delaware Bay was postponed indefinitely
today because of fears of a possible fuel leak, a spokesman said.
   Attention shifted to finding a way to transfer 1,000 stranded
passengers and whatever crew members aren't needed from the
grounded Regent Star, said Coast Guard spokesman David Oney.
   ``Arrangements are being made now to offload the people,'' said
Oney. Exactly how that would be done hadn't been determined, he
said.
   The Regent Star lost power and ran aground about a mile off of
Fortescue, N.J., at 1 a.m. Sunday. An attempt to have tugboats push
it off as high tide Sunday afternoon was a failure.
   A second attempt was scheduled for this afternoon, but Oney said
it was called off because of fears that the ship's anchor,
underneath its hull, would puncture the hull and fuel tanks inside,
causing an oil spill.
   ``We heard earlier that they had moved the fuel, transferred it
to higher tanks,'' Oney said. ``When we found out that they hadn't
made the transfer, that left us with the danger of a rupture.''
   No one was injured in the grounding, and passengers _ at least
at first _ were reported to be taking the mishap as a chance to
have another day of shipboard fun.
   Oney said passengers might be transferred to shore on one of the
ferries that regularly operate between nearby Cape May, N.J., and
Lewes, Del. Another possibility would be to use Coast Guard
vessels, he said.
   A spokesman for Aspen Shipping, the agent for the Regent Star,
referred all questions to the Coast Guard. Richard Wilkie, the
captain of the port for the Cape May-Lewes Ferry, refused to take a
telephone call.
   The Memorial Day weekend is one of the busiest for the ferry, on
a major route to seashore points. The Regent Star is carrying 1,360
people, but at least 300 of them are believed to be crew members.
   The 642-foot Regent Star was heading from Montego Bay, Jamaica,
to Philadelphia after a seven-day cruise, the Coast Guard reported.
   A small electrical fire in a switchboard apparently caused a
power failure early Sunday morning and the ship drifted into the
sandbar, said Petty Officer John Brazell.
   Passengers who found their vacation extended by a day were in
good spirits Sunday.
   ``The lights went out in the disco, everybody was singing `Hot,
hot, hot','' Kathleen Hopkins, a reporter at The Daily Journal of
Elizabeth, N.J., who was on board, said by phone.
   Later, they sang Christmas carols and played an improvised
version of ``The Newlywed Game.''
   ``People started chanting `Drinks, drinks, drinks,''' and free
mimosas were flowing, Ms. Hopkins said. ``Nobody's really scared,
everybody is having a good time.''
   ``It just gave us a great opportunity to party hardy a little
longer,'' Barbara Sowden, from Wilmington, Del., said by phone.
``We don't need a band, we make our own music.''
   The Coast Guard directed marine traffic away from the area.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will go
into his meetings with President Bush in ``a strong position''
despite political turmoil at home, a Soviet veteran of recent
superpower summits said Monday.
   Nikolai Shishlin, an adviser to the central committee of the
Soviet Communist party, spoke at a Soviet Embassy news conference
called to discuss cultural and other issues in advance of the
summit.
   Gorbachev is due to arrive on Wednesday and begin talks with
Bush on Thursday.
   In Moscow, the Soviet leader made a hastily scheduled television
appearance Sunday night to appeal for calm in the face of a wave of
panic buying caused by government plans to triple bread prices on
July 1.
   Bush, speaking to reporters near his home in Kennebunkport,
Maine, before returning to Washington after a Memorial Day weekend
break, said he believes Gorbachev is ``pretty darn strong'' despite
the economic crisis.
   Shishlin spoke in response to a question about how the summit
might be affected by the outcome of elections in the Soviet
republic of Russia, in which Boris Yeltsin, a critic of Gorbachev's
policies, was a leading candidate.
   Speaking through a translator, Shishlin said, ``I believe that
for all the tumultuous political process that has developed in
Soviet society, for all the posturing and emotion that is building
up inside the country, for all the painful and critical nature of
the moments we are living through, the expansion of perestroika is
proceeding.''
   ``Regardless of the result of elections in the republic of
Russia, the position of Gorbachev at present is a strong position
and a position of authority,'' he said.
   Shishlin was described by the embassy as an expert of world
history and a journalist who has been on the faculty of various
higher educational institutions in Moscow and taken part in recent
Soviet-American summits. He was also described as host of a
television program called International Panorama.

<HEAD>House Democrats Ask for More Funds to Investigate S&amp;L Fraud</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is being asked by 170 House
Democrats to step into the worsening savings and loan crisis more
and request additional funds from Congress to investigate prosecute
fraud in the industry.
   The Democrats, led by Rep. Charles E. Schumer of New York, sent
a letter Friday to Bush saying the $50 million appropriated to the
Justice Department to investigate and prosecute S&amp;L fraud isn't
enough to handle the backlog of thousands of potential criminal
cases.
   An additional $100 million is needed, said the Democrats,
including some lawmakers who last week accused the Justice
Department of dragging its feet on prosecuting thrift fraud.
   Sean Young, a White House spokesman, said over the weekend that
Bush had not received the letter yet and would have no immediate
comment on it.
   Bush said at a news conference last Thursday the savings and
loan crisis ``causes me great concern'' and that policymakers'
first priority is protecting depositors against losses.
   The administration last week dramatically raised its estimates
of how much new borrowing the government needs to clean up the
savings and loan mess. Instead of the $50 billion forecast a year
ago, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said between $90 billion and
$130 is now needed.
   Including interest on the money borrowed, the cost to taxpayers
of covering the S&amp;L losses is expected to exceed $325 billion over
the next 30 years.
   Brady unveiled the new estimate the same day that Bush's son,
Neil, was testifying before the House Banking Committee on the $1
billion collapse of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan
Association. Neil Bush was a director of the failed Denver thrift.
   The panel's chairman, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, said he
plans to ask Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to testify before the
committee later.
   Democrats on the House committee, including Schumer, have
criticized the Justice Department for earmarking only $50 million
to investigate S&amp;L fraud instead of the $75 million that Congress
last year authorized for the task as part of the bailout
legislation.
   ``The American people are being asked to foot the bill of a
bailout that may well exceed several hundred billion dollars,'' the
House Democrats wrote in their letter Friday to Bush. ``They demand
in return that the criminals who looted the thrift industry be
brought to justice.''
   They asked Bush to reevaluate the number of personnel needed to
vigorously investigate and prosecute alleged fraud and embezzlement
and seek increased appropriations from Congress to meet those needs.
   ``At this time, we believe that the Department of Justice
requires close to $100 million in additional funds to meet these
personnel needs,'' their letter said.
   Justice Department officials have claimed they already are
spending nearly that amount. In addition to the $50 million from
the bailout legislation, department officials say they are spending
a roughly equivalent amount from previously appropriated money on
investigating S&amp;L fraud.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, who won
fame leading a shipyard workers' strike a decade ago, persuaded
rail workers Monday to suspend a strike that had crippled train
service in northern Poland.
   Service resumed after Walesa made a late-night appeal to the
workers, who had threatened a 90-minute nationwide walkout later
Monday. The workers agreed to return to their jobs while the
government reviews a list of demands, including pay raises.
   A week of sporadic labor disputes had stalled freight and
passenger transport, paralyzed Poland's Baltic ports and posed a
threat to the Solidarity-led government.
   ``On our road to democracy, there are various dangerous curves,
and the railway workers' protest was one of them,'' Walesa said.
``We all have to ... draw conclusions from it.''
   The agreement calls for government review of the strikers'
demands for pay raises and reforms of the rail system. Until now,
the government has insisted that giving into the rail workers could
set off a series of wage demands that could hurt drastic economic
reforms under way.
   The Transport Ministry said after normal rail traffic is
restored, the management of the state-run railway will meet with
unions to discuss their grievances.
   Passenger service was expected to be normal by Tuesday, but
freight traffic bottlenecks were expected to take longer to clear
up.
   Walesa said he would meet with the strike committee in two weeks
to assess progress.
   The rail workers' strike committee, in a communique, called on
the Solidarity-backed government to reshape its economic reforms so
the ``burden of the crisis is spread over the whole society.''
   Poles have been reeling under the impact of big price increases
combined with a sharp drop in real wages. The economic reform
effort is using ``shock treatment'' to jolt Poland's moribund
centralized economy into a market system.
   The program includes cutting the subsidies to state industries _
including the railroad _ that allowed them to charge
unrealistically low rates and grant pay raises without regard to
profitability.
   Government spokesman Zbigniew Augustynowicz welcomed the
suspension of the rail strike, saying it ``certainly makes the
situation easier.''
   ``This is a fulfillment of what the government expected,'' he
said. ``The government has always said it would not talk under the
gun of a strike.''
   Walesa went to strike headquarters in the northwest city of
Slupsk at midnight Sunday for talks that stretched into the early
hours of Monday.
   Strikers had asked him to return following his first failed
attempt to settle the dispute the night before, Walesa aides said.
   Walesa said the agreement suspending the strike included ``no
promises that would be impossible to fulfill later.''
   The labor dispute had cast a shadow over national local
government elections, which drew only a 42 percent turnout on
Sunday.
   The settlement, even though temporary, relieves a crisis for the
government of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki.
   Mazowiecki had appealed for an end to the strike, saying the
hardships already suffered under the 5-month-old economic program
would increase if there were exceptions to the anti-inflation drive.
   Walesa, who holds no government post but wields tremendous
personal influence, became an emissary for the government despite
his own differences with Mazowiecki on the pace of reforms.
   A decade ago, Walesa was an electrician in the Gdansk shipyard,
where Solidarity was formed during labor upheaval in which
Gorbachev played a leading role. Solidarity was crushed after the
Communists imposed martial law in December 1981. It was restored to
legal status in April 1989.
   The government had no direct comment on Walesa's role. It said
only through an aide in the press office that ``every initiative
leading to the ending of strikes is valuable.''
   During Walesa's meetings with workers, he assured them he was
not an ``agent of the government'' and would join their fight if
negotiations do not work.
   ``Your demands are right but the form that you are doing it in
... A strike in the present situation is anarchy on the road to the
construction of a democracy,'' Walesa told the workers early Sunday.
   The strikers' demands include pay of up to $79 a month, which is
110 percent of the average national wage. They also pressed for
dismissal of the holdover Communist managers they contended were
incompetent and hindering reforms.
   The strikes began May 20 as wildcat sit-ins. The government
initially refused to negotiate because the workers were not
represented by any legal labor organization.
   But by mid-week the cause was taken up by the OPZZ labor
federation, which was created by the Communists in 1982 when
Solidarity was banned. Walesa said the legitimate difficulties of
the rail workers were being manipulated by the ``people who led
this country to ruin,'' referring to the Communists.
   More than 40 years of Communist Party rule ended in August when
Parliament approved a Solidarity-led coalition government headed by
Mazowiecki, a former opposition activist.

   A mine exploded during a U.S.
Army training exercise Monday, and 10 American soldiers were
injured, two seriously, a military spokesman said.
   Lt. Col. Jim Gleisberg, spokesman for the U.S. Army 7th Corps,
said the accident occurred at the rural Wildflecken training area,
55 miles east of Frankfurt.
   He said in a telephone interview from Stuttgart that the
soldiers belonged to the 9th Engineer Battalion and apparently were
training with the M-16 anti-personnel mine when it exploded.
   The two soldiers who were seriously injured were taken to a
military hospital in Schweinfurt, 30 miles south of the training
area, Gleisberg said.
   He said he did not have details of any of the soldiers' injuries.
   The names of the troops were not released pending further
investigation.
   The 9th Engineer Battalion is part of the 7th Corps, which is
based in the southern city of Stuttgart. U.S. Army units regularly
use the Wildflecken area for training.

   Cashiers shouted ``Passports!'' at crowds of testy
shoppers on Monday, the first day of new rules that barred
non-Muscovites from the capital's besieged stores.
   Tempers flared over the rules, which were intended to curb a
wave of panic-buying that started after the government announced
Thursday it was raising prices as part of a transition to a market
economy.
   Shouting matches erupted between cashiers and shoppers who did
not know about the rules. Long lines moved slowly as the internal
passports were scrutinized for the stamp that proved residency.
   ``Passports, citizens, passports!'' demanded a cashier at food
store No. 44. ``Moscow or Moscow region only!''
   She refused to take the money of people who had forgotten their
documents, but softened her stance toward an elderly man who said
he was a veteran of World War II.
   At supermarket No. 30 on Gorky Street, about 70 people jammed
the front door after the lunch break. Three policemen waved
truncheons to clear a narrow path so shoppers could exit once they
had their purchases. The police hit no one with their truncheons.
   ``I quite agree with the passport measures!'' said Valentina
Guskova, a 63-year-old pensioner from the Moscow region who was
shopping in a bread store on Gorky Street. ``Those people from
other regions, they used to flock to Moscow and strip shop shelves
bare. Today, I can at least buy something for my grandchildren
here.''
   Besides the residency requirement, which already has been
adopted by other large cities, rationing was introduced on some
goods and tightened on others. The residency requirement will be in
effect in Moscow for two weeks.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in a speech Sunday night in
which he appealed for people not to panic, said ``an anxious mood
has arisen in the country in connection with the consideration by
the Supreme Soviet (parliament) of the government's report on the
transition to a market economy.''
   He gave no indication he planned to change his plans to move
forward on what his aides are calling ``regulated market economy.''
   Gorbachev, in his speech, gave assurances that the needy would
be compensated and that those thrown out of work would be retrained
for new jobs. Some economists have estimated that up to 40 million
people could lose their jobs in the reforms, which are expected to
drive many inefficient businesses into bankruptcy.
   The plan calls for bread prices to triple, to $1.09 a loaf on
July 1, and for other food prices to double on average starting Jan
1. Bread makes up about 20 percent of the average Soviet diet,
according to Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov.
   The three-phase reform plan, to carry through 1995, calls for
about 60 percent of state enterprises to be sold to the private
sector. In the immediate future, 15 percent of prices will be
freed, with controls to be lifted toward the end of the period.
   Many prices would remain under state control, and many
industries would stay in state hands, over the opposition of
radical reformers.
   During debate in the Supreme Soviet on Monday, many lawmakers
argued that it did not go far enough, especially in increasing the
production of consumer goods.
   The government Tass news agency reported an abundance of goods
such as smoked meats, fowl, fish and sausage in Moscow stores
Monday. Spot checks also found some exotic goods such as Vietnamese
vodka and Nicaraguan rum.
   Cashier Tatyana Andruykhina, who blushed as she was seen hiding
a bottle of the rum under her counter at supermarket No. 30, said
the new rules will make her job harder.
   ``Now I've got to check people's passports in addition to the
usual duties,'' said Miss Andruykhina, 19.
   Tass said the passport checks were not being universally
enforced in all stores, despite notices on the doors that such
documents were required.
   V. Kazakov, who described himself as unemployed, told Tass that
he could not find the special department set up by the Moscow City
Council to protect needy Muscovites.
   ``I lost my passport three years ago and had no necessity to get
a new one,'' Kazakov said. ``And now, should I die of hunger?''

   President Bush said Monday that
Mikhail S. Gorbachev is ``pretty darn strong'' despite economic
woes plaguing the Soviet Union. But Bush virtually closed the door
on giving Moscow trade benefits during summit talks this week.
   ``I go to the summit with open arms to welcome the president of
the Soviet Union,'' Bush said, winding up four days of vacation to
return to Washington for talks beginning Thursday.
   In this seaside resort where he has spent nearly every summer of
his life, Bush was the star attraction at the Memorial Day parade
of veterans, school bands and fire trucks through Dock Square.
   Basking in sunshine and surrounded by his wife, children and
grandchildren, Bush called it a ``little piece of Americana.'' Some
people in the crowd of several thousand people flinched when a
military honor guard unexpectedly fired a loud rifle salute near
the president.
   Bush told the crowd that as he meets with Gorbachev, ``things
have changed dramatically. There's no question that we have a
better chance now for a lasting world peace.
   ``But there are still some enormous problems out there,'' he
said. ``And this country must remain strong.''
   Bush has made an effort in the days before the summit to
emphasize that Gorbachev _ despite his problems _ is a powerful
world leader who has the authority to make deals with the United
States. Administration officials reason that even if Gorbachev is
replaced, his successors would be bound by any agreements he signs.
   Gorbachev went on Soviet television Sunday night to appeal to
his countrymen for calm in the face of panic buying triggered by
Moscow's plans to double the prices of food and other goods.
   ``I think we spend too much time trying to figure out how long a
leader in any country will be there,'' Bush said, answering
reporters' questions at a country club as he teed off for a final
round of golf.
   ``I mean, this man has survived,'' Bush said. ``I've given him
... appropriate credit for the dramatic changes in Eastern Europe,
conducting himself in a manner that none of us would have predicted
possible two years ago.
   ``And so I'll deal with him,'' Bush said. ``And my own personal
opinion is that he's pretty darn strong there. And I say that after
talking to an awful lot of Soviet experts.''
   Sharp differences over German unity and Soviet coercion of
Lithuania threaten to put a cloud over the summit.
   A major Soviet goal for the summit had been to win
most-favored-nation trade status with the United States, giving
Moscow the lowest possible tariffs on its exports to the United
States. In fact, improved trade is probably more important than
arms deals for Gorbachev, given his economic problems.
   Bush noted that Moscow has not enacted a law protecting Jewish
emigration, which he had demanded as a price for ending trade
barriers.
   ``So I don't think that issue will be an action item (for the
summit),'' Bush said. ``I expect it will be talked about because as
they move toward a free market economy, trade with the West is
vitally important to them.
   ``And I'd say that certain items are very important to us, as
well,'' Bush said, singling out pressure on the Baltic states as an
issue ``that concerns me enormously.''
   Bush said he did not expect any surprises from Gorbachev and had
none up his sleeve.
   Asked if he was ready for the summit, Bush, leaning against a
golf club, smiled and said, ``I've got some more work to do, but
I've been reading my briefing books.''

   A pipe bomb exploded Monday in a market filled
with people shopping for the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, killing an
elderly Israeli man. Israelis chanting ``Death to Arabs!'' tried to
attack Palestinians held for questioning.
   The noon explosion injured nine people at the packed Mahane
Yehuda market.
   A top aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir blamed the Palestine
Liberation Organization and said the attack was timed to coincide
with the Arab summit in Baghdad, Iraq, which opened Monday.
   ``The PLO is sending a message to the Arab summit in order to
dramatize its call for Arab support for the Palestinian uprising
and to show that it still has teeth,'' Yossi Ben-Aharon, director
general of Shamir's office, told The Associated Press.
   In Damascus, a Syrian-backed Palestinian group headed by Col.
Said Mousa issued a communique claiming one of its fighters planted
the bomb. Mousa is an enemy of PLO leader Yasser Arafat and
cooperated with Syria in driving him out of Lebanon in 1985.
   The communique from the Fagah-Uprising faction said the bomb was
aimed at Jewish settlers in Jerusalem.
   Police rounded up 87 Palestinians after the explosion. Just
outside the market, about 200 angry shoppers surrounded police vans
as officers pushed the Palestinian detainees inside.
   Dozens of onlookers tried to attack some of the Palestinians,
shouting ``Death to the Arabs!'' and ``Burn them, burn them!'' At
one point, a crowd of about 25 Israelis beat on a police van
carrying an Arab detainee.
   Some Israeli stall owners sheltered Arab workers from the wrath
of the crowd and police stepped up patrols to prevent reprisals
against Arabs.
   Journalists also were attacked by angry Israelis.
   Photographer Yoav Lemer, who was taking pictures for The
Associated Press, was hospitalized after three men knocked him to
the ground and kicked him. Two followers of the anti-Arab Kach
movement of U.S.-born Rabbi Meir Kahane were arrested in the attack.
   The pipe bomb was hidden in a bag inside a garbage can.
Officials said Shimon Cohen, 72, suffered internal injuries and
died in Shaarei Zedek Hospital several hours after the blast. Three
other victims were in moderate condition and the rest suffered
slight wounds.
   The death raised to 44 the number of Israelis killed during the
29-month Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. At least 711 Palestinians have been slain
by Israeli soldiers or civilians during the revolt.
   Moshe Abuhatzeira, 41, said he brought his 8-year-old son,
Aviel, to the market from the West Bank settlement of Elon Shvut to
buy sandals for the boy. They were talking to friends when the bomb
went off.
   ``I heard a big noise behind me. My boy was screaming `Dad,
Dad.' I carried him in my arms and put a lot of pressure on his
wound so he wouldn't lose too much blood,'' said Abuhatzeira, who
was injured slightly in the right knee.
   The child was hospitalized in moderate condition with shrapnel
wounds in the right thigh.
   Most of the shoppers were stocking up for Shavuot, the Jewish
harvest festival that begins Tuesday.
   In Washington, the State Department called the blast a
``cowardly and barbaric act (that) demonstrates again the
importance of engaging in realistic and workable steps toward a
viable peace process.''
   Faisal Husseini, the most prominent pro-PLO leader in the
occupied lands, denounced the bombing.
   ``I condemn any attack against civilians whoever they might be,
and I condemn those behind this attack,'' he told Israel's Itim
news agency.
   Some Israelis said they believed the bombing was a reprisal for
the May 20 massacre of seven unarmed Palestinian laborers by an
Israeli gunman, who authorities said went berserk.
   The massacre touched off a wave of Palestinian rioting in which
16 Arabs died. Arafat demanded Friday that U.N. observers be
stationed in the occupied lands to safeguard the 1.7 million
Palestinians living there.
   About 30 members of the Kach group staged an anti-Arab
demonstration Monday in Rishon Lezion, site of the massacre. At
least twice at many Israelis from the Peace Now movement came to
heckle the speakers, but police kept the two sides apart.

   Maryland state police searched Monday
for three teen-agers who threw large rocks through the windshields
of more than 25 cars on a suburban Washington highway, injuring
seven people, one critically.
   Destiny Morris, a 15-year-old girl from Hagerstown, was a
passenger in one of the cars struck by the rocks early Sunday
morning. She was listed in critical condition Monday at Southern
Maryland Medical Center in Clinton.
   Ellis Morris said Monday that his daughter suffered a fractured
skull.
   ``The doctor feels that she may not make it,'' Morris said. ``It
doesn't look good at all.''
   Morris said Destiny was coming home from Ocean City with some
friends.
   ``On the way back, they got sidetracked and had to turn around
and come back. When they did, they ended up with this _ kids
throwing rocks through windshields,'' he said.
   ``This little girl's not even 16 years old yet,'' Morris told
The Washington Post on Sunday. ``She doesn't even know what life is
all about, and the doctors are telling me she might not make it
because somebody threw a rock ... It just doesn't make sense.''
   State Police Sgt. R.A. Jones said fliers were distributed
seeking information about the incidents.
   The suspects are three teen-age boys believed to be between 14
and 18 years old.
   The incident occurred about 2:30 a.m. Sunday on I-95 in Oxon
Hill,, outside the District of Columbia. Witnesses reported that
three teen-agers were throwing of rocks weighing between 5 pounds
and 15 pounds at approaching cars.
   State police say the teens face charges of attempted murder,
assault and battery and malicious destruction of property.
   Motorist Robert Brannigan, 27, of Baltimore said he saw a body
lying in the road.
   ``At first, I couldn't see him because it was so dark,''
Brannigan said. ``I thought someone was hurt. ... When he started
to get up, he had a boulder over his face and he started running
toward the car. I swerved. It was the wildest thing.''
   The rock crashed through Brannigan's rear window, but no one was
injured.
   ``It was a real mess,'' Sgt. Vernon Herron said. ``Those cars
were moving at 55 mph, and when a big rock hits you at that speed,
it's a very, very serious incident. It's not fun and games.''

<HEAD>IRA Says It Mistakenly Killed Two Australian Tourists</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROERMOND, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Irish Republican Army said
Monday its gunmen shot to death two Australian lawyers on vacation
in the Netherlands after they ``tragically mistook'' them for
British soldiers.
   The two 24-year-old victims were ambushed Sunday night after
returning to their car following a meal in an Italian restaurant.
   ``The IRA accepts responsibility for the deaths,'' said an IRA
statement released in Dublin on Monday. ``The active service unit
involved tragically mistook the men for two British Army personnel.
The IRA deeply regrets this tragedy.''
   The statement did not explain how the mistake was made. However,
Dutch television said police believed the attackers were confused
by British license plates on the Australians' car.
   The victims, Stephen Melrose and Nick Spanos, died in a hail of
machine-gun fire. They were Australian citizens but were based in
London.
   Two women with them were unhurt, said police spokesman Louis
Steens. They were identified as Melrose's wife, Lyndal, and Spanos'
girlfriend, Vicky Coss.
   The attack took place in the central square of Roermond, a
southern town frequented by British soldiers stationed in nearby
West Germany.
   In 1988, three British servicemen died in coordinated IRA
attacks in Roermond and in Nieuwbergen, 30 miles to the north.
   Steens said the Australian couples were on vacation and had
arrived in Amsterdam from London on Sunday. They ``just wanted to
see a part of Holland'' on their way to France, he said.
   Witnesses said up to four people were involved in the shooting,
Steens said.
   Steens said the 40-member police team assigned to the case was
being assisted by Royal Air Force police and West German police.
   The almost exclusively Catholic Irish Republican Army is
fighting to push the British out of Protestant-dominated Northern
Ireland, join it with the Republic of Ireland and set up an
all-Ireland socialist state.

   An electronics problem with a
computerized display unit in the space shuttle Columbia resulted in
extra last-minute work for NASA on Monday, but was not expected to
delay this week's launch.
   ``That's really our only problem. Everything else is going very
smoothly,'' said NASA test director Al Sofge.
   Columbia is scheduled to lift off at 12:38 a.m. EDT Wednesday
carrying seven astronauts and a $150 million observatory known as
Astro that will be used to study ultraviolet light and X-rays
emitted by stars and other objects.
   Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
noticed Sunday that the so-called ``head-up display,'' which
projects an image of data needed by the shuttle's commander during
landings, was displaying incorrect information. Technicians
replaced the display, but that did not fix the problem.
   Officials determined Monday that the unit's electronics package
was at fault and began the eight-hour job of replacing it. The
package is about the size of a videocassette recorder and is
located in the shuttle's middeck.
   The display unit will be tested for eight hours after the new
device is installed.
   ``We can do it in parallel with all the other (countdown)
activities without impacting those activities,'' Sofge said.
   Air Force forecasters were predicting an 80 percent chance of
favorable weather at launch time.
   The nine- to 10-day mission _ the first one in five years to be
devoted entirely to scientific research _ already has been delayed
two weeks because of repairs to the shuttle's cooling system.
Additional delays could mean even more changes to Astro's observing
schedule.
   Because of the delay, fewer observations are planned of Comet
Austin, which is receding rapidly from Earth. The comet is believed
to be on its first trip through the solar system.
   ``It's sort of fading quickly. We're hoping we can still get
some observations in, but we're not as optimistic,'' said Arthur
Davidsen, chief investigator for Astro's Hopkins Ultraviolet
Telescope.
   Jupiter and some stars cannot be studied now because they are
too close to the sun, Davidsen said Monday. If Astro's three
ultraviolet telescopes or one X-ray telescope point toward the sun,
their instruments could be damaged.
   ``We'll still make use of every second on the shuttle,''
Davidsen said.
   One target _ a quasar 10 billion light years from Earth _ is in
a better position now than it was a month ago, Davidsen said. The
quasar will be the faintest object observed by Astro.
   The four astronomers in the crew will use computers to operate
the ultraviolet telescopes round the clock. The X-ray telescope
will be controlled by computer commands sent from Goddard Space
Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
   Astronomers expect Astro to complement the work of the Hubble
Space Telescope, deployed last month in a 380-mile-high orbit
during the last shuttle flight. The Hubble cannot detect X-rays and
cannot see as much detail in ultraviolet images as Astro.
   NASA program scientist Ed Weiler sees Hubble as a basic toolbox
and Astro as extra tools.
   ``You can do most jobs at home with that basic toolbox. But
there are always unique things you want to do which might require a
ratchet wrench or a power drill,'' Weiler said Monday. ``(Astro) is
the ratchet wrench, the power drill.''

   The bodies of five American servicemen
killed nearly 40 years ago in the Korean War were returned to their
countrymen Monday in an emotional Memorial Day ceremony marking
them heroes.
   Five brown caskets and five small boxes containing buttons, dog
tags, boots and pieces of uniforms were turned over to eight U.S.
congressmen by Communist North Korea, the enemy in the war.
   It was the first return of U.S. Korean War dead from the North
since 1954. More than 8,000 Americans from the 1950-53 conflict are
still unaccounted for.
   U.S. Rep. Ben Campbell, D-Colo., peered down at one of the
caskets as it was opened ceremoniously to be checked and saw a
skeleton beneath a white silk cloth.
   ``All I could think was that one or two of these unidentified
might have been one or two of my friends,'' said Campbell, who
served 13 months in Korea in the Air Force.
   The return of the remains is widely seen as a gesture by North
Korea to improve relations with the United States. The two
countries do not have diplomatic relations.
   U.S. military officials said the remains would be flown Tuesday
to Hickam Air Base in Hawaii for a hero's welcome and the
painstaking process of identification, which could take several
months.
   Pallbearers in suits and ties, wearing white gloves and lapel
pins of North Korean leader Kim Il Sung, handed the caskets over to
the congressional delegation in the truce village of Panmunjom
inside the Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas.
   The caskets were draped with blue flags of the United Nations,
the flag under which American forces fought in Korea. An Army
chaplain read a prayer saying ``we have come to take them home to
family and friends, to a hero's welcome.''
   Several old soldiers wept.
   The transfer came after Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss.,
chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, signed a document
with North Korea confirming he received the remains.
   ``This is a historic occasion ... recognition for Americans who
fought in Korea, recognition that has not come for 40 years,''
Montgomery said.
   He said the United States hoped more remains would be returned.
   Americans discounted speculation there might be American
prisoners still alive in North Korea, saying both Soviet and North
Korean diplomats had assured them it was untrue.
   ``I feel happiness, sadness, bitterness,'' said Lt. Col. Don
Byers, the last active duty servicemen stationed in Korea who
fought in the war. ``I want to know where the rest are. Why five?
Why not 500?''
   The American-led United Nations Command in Seoul says 33,629
U.S. soldiers were killed and 103,284 wounded in the war. More than
2 million Koreans were killed.
   The Command includes the United States and 15 other nations that
fought on South Korea's side after North Korean forces invaded
across the 38th parallel dividing the Korean Peninsula on June 25,
1950.
   The remains of the five returned Monday were unearthed in 1987
and are those of two U.S. Air Force members and three Army members.
All five were believed to have been prisoners of war and died in
Hwanghae Pukto province south of North Korea's capital of Pyongyang.
   The U.S. Defense Department tentatively has identified two of
the dead as Army 1st Lt. Jack J. Saunders, 27, of Ogden, Utah, and
Army Cpl. Arthur Leo Seaton, 20, of Chester, Pa.
   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., said Seaton's family lived about a mile
and a half from where he grew up and that he had talked with family
members before flying to Korea. Standing at the head of one coffin
during the ceremonies, he said, ``These are heroes.''
   Other members of the congressional delegation were Democratic
Reps. James Bilbray of Nevada, Frank McCloskey of Indiana and Bob
Traxler of Michigan and Republican Reps. Bob Stump of Arizona and
Gerald Solomon of New York.

<HEAD>House Grapples With Subsidies for Millionaire Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Agriculture Committee is dealing
with growing opposition in Congress to millionaire farmers who
receive federal subsidies.
   Reps. Timothy Penny, D-Minn., and Dan Glickman, D-Kan., proposed
last week that the 1990 farm bill be amended in committee to cut
off subsidies to farmers who gross more than $2 million a year.
   The idea rankled members who view subsidies not as a welfare
program for needy farmers but as the government's way to ensure a
steady supply of food in an industry that, by nature, is cyclical.
   ``Our intention is to hear what people think about the issue,''
said Glickman, chairman of the subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and
feed grains, the mostly highly subsidized crops.
   The size of government subsidies have been gradually falling
since the all-time record of $26 billion in 1986, but efforts to
cut the federal deficit have put a tighter squeeze on farm programs.
   Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., said the Glickman-Penny proposal
would be ``the beginning of the end of the farm program.''
   Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., another critic of the plan, called
Glickman ``a legislative activist who needs to find the woolly
bears of the farm bill and expose them on a weekly basis.''
   Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., said the proposal challenged the
philosophy of the farm program.
   ``This program is designed to help the family farmer balance
supply and demand,'' he said, contending that the Glickman-Penny
proposal would make it a welfare program.
   Several members argued that gross revenues weren't an indication
of a farmer's wealth, because production costs often absorb so much
of a producer's income.
   ``The livestock business, for example, is low profit,'' said
Rep. Denny Smith, R-Ore. ``Returns are 2 to 4 percent. You have a
huge investment for a small turnaround.''
   John Campbell, deputy undersecretary of agriculture, said the
Bush administration was responsible in part for starting the debate
over the subsidies.
   ``Our preference would be to stay on course,'' he told the
committee. But he said that if agriculture spending was not brought
down, the administration may support a move such as that suggested
by Glickman and Penny.
   A coalition led by Reps. Richard Armey, R-Texas, and Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., has announced it will fight some subsidy programs
when the bill gets to the floor.
   Armey has said he'll introduce an amendment to cut off payments
to any farmer who has annual profits over $100,000.
   Since the food shortages and farm failures of the Great
Depression, the federal government and agriculture have been
intertwined through a farm bill that is passed every five years.
   Supporters of the programs say participation by wealthy farmers
assures they will cooperate with the government in areas they may
not otherwise be so inclined. For example, subsidy programs often
include requirements that certain acreage be set aside for
conservation or supply management.
   Penny said the $2 million figure he and Glickman proposed as a
cutoff for federal subsidies was based on limits allowed under the
disaster payment legislation passed last year to aid drought
victims.

   Robert B. Meyner, a country lawyer who
became New Jersey's first governor elected to successive four-year
terms, has died after a long illness. He was 81.
   Meyner, who gained national attention during his terms in office
from 1954 to 1962, had been in declining health since suffering a
stroke in 1986. He died in his sleep Sunday at his home in Captiva,
Fla., said his wife, Helen.
   ``He lived a very full, rich life, giving an awful lot to a lot
of people,'' Mrs. Meyner said Monday by telephone from Captiva.
   A Democrat, Meyner campaigned tirelessly to win the state's
highest office at a time when Republicans dominated state
government. He was the first Democratic governor since 1940.
   Meyner surprised some by keeping a number of Republicans in his
Cabinet, saying he had to find the best people to fit the jobs.
   A fiscal conservative, Meyner was credited with keeping a
balanced state budget, and with ably administering basic state
needs such as water supply and land management. He oversaw the
completion of the New Jersey Turnpike in the mid-1950s.
   His success in the state put him in demand for speaking
engagements across the country. From 1958 to early 1960, he was
considered a possibility for the Democratic nomination for
president.
   He left office because state law prohibits governors from
serving three consecutive terms. In 1969, he was nominated for
another term, losing to Republican William T. Cahill.
   Meyner gave credibility to the governor's office and the state
Democratic Party, said former Gov. Brendan Byrne, Meyner's
secretary from 1956 to 1958.
   ``He took a boss-controlled Democratic Party and insisted on a
public integrity which remains the standard in New Jersey,'' said
Byrne, a Democrat who was governor from 1974 to 1982.
   In addition to his wife, who served in Congress from 1974 to
'78, Meyner is survived by a brother and two nephews.
   Gov. Jim Florio issued a statement Monday praising Meyner as
being ``among the first of our governors in recent memory to speak
out on New Jersey pride and New Jersey's spirit.''
   A memorial service will be held June 15 at St. Philip and St.
James Roman Catholic Church in Phillipsburg.

   Former Haitian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier has
moved out of the luxury villa on the Cote d'Azur that has been his
exile home for four years to more spacious quarters a few miles
away, sources said Monday.
   Duvalier's new residence in Vallauris has tennis courts, a
swimming pool and is closer to the Mediterranean than the villa in
Mougins, where he had lived since June 1986. It is owned by an
Ivory Coast diplomat, said sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Duvalier reportedly will pay a yearly rent of about $145,000.
   Duvalier, 38, lives with his wife, Michelle, and their two
children, Nicolas, 8, and Anya, 4. They arrived in France on Feb.
7, 1986, after being forced to flee Haiti.
   The Haitian government has pressed charges against Duvalier,
saying he absconded with $120 million of the nation's money.
   The French government originally said Duvalier could stay one
week. But no other country would accept him, and he has remained in
France with no clear status.

   A collapsed lung is expected to keep
baseball Hall of Famer Harmon Killebrew hospitalized for at least
10 days, his brother says.
   Killebrew, 53, underwent surgery Friday at Scottsdale Memorial
Hospital in Arizona, said his brother, Bob.
   ``The problem was a gastric ulcer that ruptured in his
stomach,'' Bob Killebrew said. ``The fluid backed up into his chest
cavity and collapsed his lung.''
   He requested privacy and the release of no information, Bob
Killebrew said. He said his brother, who has a home at Payette,

   Cecilia Peck has her mother's strong Gallic
nose and dark-haired beauty, and her father's square jaw, but she
is her own person, as she demonstrates in her first starring role.
   The 32-year-old daughter of Gregory and Veronique Peck portrays
a young Arab worman in the film ``Torn Apart,'' which takes place
in Israel during the country's wars with its neighbors. A childhood
friendship with a Jewish boy, played by Adrian Pasdar, blossoms
into romance when he returns from America to serve in the Israeli
army.
   ``I had been to Israel once before, to visit the Hebrew
University in Jerusalem,'' Ms. Peck said in a recent interview. ``I
saw Israel from that perspective, of the Jewish people who settled
there and made that country what it is. That was quite an
extraordinary experience.
   ``I went back this time to play an Arab girl, so I saw the other
side of the country and the other culture that inhabits that land.
I spent time with Arab families, and they talked to me about their
lives and their hopes for the future and their marriages and their
children.''

   Chester Zardis, a renowned string bass player
who has performed with New Orleans jazz giants since the 1920s, was
honored with a rousing 90th birthday bash.
   Zardis celebrated with friends and other musicians while Danny
Barker's band entertained at the Sunday night dinner at the Palm
Court jazz club in the French Quarter.
   He had performed Thursday and Saturday at the Palm Court and
Friday at Preservation Hall.
   ``Thank you, Chester, for making so much music in the world,''
said Barker.
   Zardis learned the bass when he was sent to the New Orleans
Waifs Home _ the same school where Louis Armstrong learned to play.
Since then he has played with traditional New Orleans jazz bands
like King Oliver and George Lewis, as well as working with other
musicians such as Count Basie.

   A policeman-turned congressman takes on
a wealthy former utility executive in Tuesday's Republican
gubernatorial primary while Gov. Bill Clinton attempts to avoid a
runoff in his bid for the Democratic nomination.
   U.S. Sen. David Pryor, a Democrat seeking a third term, is
unopposed for renomination but faces a write-in candidate in the
November general election. Rep. Bill Alexander, a Democrat seeking
a 12th term, faces a stiff primary challenge from attorney Mike
Gibson in the 1st District.
   The Republican gubernatorial race pits Rep. Tommy Robinson, a
former police chief and sheriff from Jacksonville, against
Sheffield Nelson of Little Rock, who led Arkla Inc., a natural gas
utility, from 1973 to 1984.
   Arkansas voters may participate in either primary without making
a commitment for the November general election and some traditional
Democrats may opt for the GOP primary since Both Robinson and
Nelson switched parties last year.
   Clinton faces five opponents, including Tom McRae, former
president of the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation, named for a
former governor. A poll released Friday showed Clinton with 55
percent and McRae 22 percent, with 19 percent undecided and the
three other candidates with 3 percent or less.
   To avoid a runoff, Clinton must get more than 50 percent of the
vote. If no Democrat does, the two top finishers will square off
June 12.
   Kentucky also has a primary Tuesday, in which Democratic voters
will decide whether state schools Superintendent John Brock and
former Louisville Mayor Harvey Sloane gets to challenge incumbent
Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell in November.
   Two of Kentucky's Democratic congressmen also face primary
challenges: 10-term incumbent Rep. Romano Mazzoli in Louisville's
3rd District, and Rep. Chris Perkins, seeking to retain the eastern
Kentucky seat held by his father, the late Carl Perkins, for three
decades.
   Arkansas state Auditor Julia Hughes Jones estimated voter
turnout would top 600,000, the highest for a primary since records
were first kept in 1966. The state has nearly 1.2 million
registered voters.
   The main issue in the Republican campaign has been business
deals between Arkla Inc. and Arkoma Productions, owned by Nelson's
pal Jerry Jones, who grew up with Robinson in North Little Rock.
   In December 1982, Arkla sold a half-interest in its gas drilling
leases on 20,500 acres in Arkansas to Arkoma for $15 million.
Arkoma eventually spent an additional $35 million on drilling and
other costs. In 1986, Arkla bought back its leases along with the
rest of Arkoma for $174.8 million.
   Robinson, 48, said it was a sleazy deal and severed his long
financial ties and friendship with Jones. Nelson, who left the
company in 1984, said that if his successors had bought Arkoma in
1985 they could have gotten it for $85 million.
   Clinton, 43, was the nation's youngest governor when he was
first elected in 1978. He lost his bid for re-election in 1980, but
was elected again in 1982, 1984 and 1986.
   Blacks are guaranteed more representation in the Legislature
because 31 legislative districts were redrawn, including 10 new
majority-black districts in eastern and southern Arkansas. Half of
those 10 seats are being sought by only black candidates. That
means there will be at least one more black in the Senate, for a
total of two, and three more in the House, up from five, when the
1990 elections are over.

   An earthquake rumbled across northern Armenia in
the same region that was devastated by a December 1988 temblor that
killed 25,000 people, the Tass news agency said Monday.
   Several buildings were damaged in Sunday's temblor but no
injuries were reported, the news agency said.
   Tass said the earthquake, which struck at 10:28 p.m. Moscow
time, measured 6.5 on the 12-point Soviet scale.
   In Boulder, Colo. Russ Needham, a geophysicist with the U.S.
Geological Survey said the quake measured less than 5 on the
Richter scale. A temblor of 5 on the Richter scale can cause
considerable damage.
   The epicenter of the earthquake was near Spitak, in northern
Armenia, a town that was demolished in 1988, Tass said.
   ``Several villages have been damaged,'' Tass said. The news
agency said there was damage to buildings in the towns of
Stepanavan and Kirovakan.
   Tass said the temblor was also felt in the Armenian capital of
Yerevan.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs.

<TEXT>
   A film that equates criminals who rape and murder
without mercy or regret with the Communist Party's actions over 72
years is already a sensation before it opens at Moscow movie
theaters.
   The new documentary, ``This is No Way to Live,'' by Stanislav
Govorukhin, breaks most of the last taboos left in the glasnost era.
   Govorukhin rolls the tragedies of Communist rule, the
humiliation of Soviet life, and his personal indignation at the
fate of his country into an indictment so powerful it would seem
authorities would have to ban the film.
   But the authorities have changed.
   The Foreign Ministry staged a screening. Moscow City Council
deputies have pledged to bring the movie to cinemas. Govorukhin
said President Mikhail S. Gorbachev himself proclaimed the film
``wonderful'' after a private viewing.
   ``For the life of me, I can't understand how Gorbachev could
like it,'' he said, sounding distressed.
   ``This is No Way to Live'' begins with graphic scenes of rape
and murder in a style familiar to viewers of Leningrad TV's ``600
Seconds,'' a daily program that frequently shows grisly crime
scenes.
   Then it moves into Part 2: ``Criminals in Power.''
   Beginning with the 1918 murder of czar Nicholas II and other
members of the royal Romanov family, it presents viewers with one
Bolshevik crime against the people after another.
   It documents the mass slaughter of the ``bourgeoisie'' under
Lenin; the artifically created famines; the tens of millions of
deaths and imprisonments under Stalin; the destruction of churches
and liquidation of the priesthood; the distortion of people's
consciousness with ideological propaganda; and the impoverishment
of the vast, rich country through idiotic mismanagement.
   The scenes shift next to the ``disgusting humiliation'' of
everyday Soviet life, with its lines, shortages, poverty and moral
bankruptcy, and the crooked bodies crated by such conditions and
``70 years of the wrong genetic policy.''
   ``The crimes of Hitler's regime cannot begin to measure up to
all this in scale and cruelty, especially if you consider that it
was done against one's own people,'' Govorukhin says in the film's
narration.
   Against footage of the post-World War II Nuremburg trials of
Nazi leaders, he raises the prospect of a similar national trial of
Communists. He says the organizers of a crime should bear the brunt
of punishment.
   The Moscow News weekly predicted Thursday that Govorukhin would
be accused of ``malice, mockery and painting everything black'' by
``the very people whom he proposes for a national trial.''
   Judging by two preliminary screenings and commentaries beginning
to appear in the Soviet press, however, it is mainly Govorukhin's
unrelieved gloom, not his political views, that upsets audiences.
   One viewer at the Foreign Ministry showing remarked that ``We
all already know we can't live this way. What we need to know is
how we should live.''
   Govorukhin, a tall, balding man with a deep voice, offered no
apologies for his downbeat views at question-and-answer sessions
after the screenings.
   ``Personally, I'm a pessimist,'' he said. ``I have no basis to
think everything will get better quickly. There's no one in this
whole country except absolute idiots who doesn't think tomorrow
will be worse. And when people have no hope, and God has been taken
away from them, what can you expect?''
   Govorukhin, well-known as a journalist and director of
commercial films, said he made ``This is No Way to Live'' mainly as
a ``letter to the Supreme Soviet'' legislature. He wants wide
distribution for the film, but he was most concerned it be seen and
understood by the country's leaders.
   Soviet lawmakers already have had several screenings, and
chances are most will see the film as its fame grows. Two of
Moscow's biggest cinemas have also committed themselves to showing
it.
   Members of the Russian Congress saw the film earlier this week,
and its influence has already been felt on the floor.
   A deputy from the Russian town of Saratov quoted Govorukhin from
the podium on Wednesday, saying ``If a country is this rich and the
people are this poor, that's a crime.''
   Another deputy noted the film ``threw in our face the horrible
but honest truth. We can understand it differently but we all
agree: This is no way to live.''
   Govorukhin said legislators told him the documentary made
conservative deputies more conservative and radicals more radical,
but in all it managed to move the center slightly toward more
reformist views. ``If that's so, then it has played its role,'' he
said.

   Colombians took a stand against drug
terrorism when they elected Cesar Gaviria president, but there was
another message as well.
   Gaviria's victory in Sunday's election served as a warning to
Colombia's political elite: Start listening to the people, and get
ready for changes.
   During his campaign, Gaviria _ who took up his candidacy when
his predecessor was assassinated _ became a symbol of resistance to
the drug traffickers.
   But he also appealed to millions of Colombians who were fed up
with the country's political aristocracy. The election results
suggest that voters took his populist message to heart.
   Two political parties _ the Liberal Party and the Conservative
Party _ have controlled Colombian politics for more than 100 years.
Leaders have traditionally snuffed out attempts to make the parties
more responsive to the people.
   But on Sunday, the Conservatives went down to their wost defeat
ever. As for the Liberals, their candidate _ Gaviria _ won. But he
comes from a faction that bucked the party's Old Guard.
   Colombia's 100-year-old constitution allows little political
voice outside the two main parties. But Colombians voted by a
9-to-1 margin in favor of an overhaul of the constitution.
   Commentators said the vote for Gaviria was a vote for change.
   ``Gaviria has committed himself to carrying out the political
and social transformation that Colombians yearn for,'' the Bogota
daily newspaper El Espectador said Monday.
   ``Colombians want to clean out the system and bring democracy
close to the people,'' Clara Lopez, a former Bogota city council
president, told The Associated Press.
   Gaviria was closely aligned with Luis Carlos Galan, a federal
senator who frequently disagreed with the political chiefs of the
Liberal Party.
   Galan later became the party's presidential candidate,
advocating a political reform and a tough stance against the drug
traffickers. He was killed by drug-backed assassins in August.
   Gaviria took Galan's place as the party's candidate, and also
kept alive Galan's ideas for shaking up Colombia's antiquated
political structures.
   The election results indicated the shakeup was starting already.
   Former guerrilla Antonio Navarro, whose M-19 Movement laid down
its armss in March to join the political process, received a
respectable 12 percent of the vote. It was the best showing of a
left-wing presidential candidate in Colombia's history.
   ``The support his candidacy received clearly shows that immense
possibilities of a peace process, and the generous payment of the
Colombian people to those who seek peace,'' Gaviria said in his
victory speech Sunday night.
   Twelve percent was considered a good showing for Navarro, but
the same figure was seen as a big defeat for the Conservative
Party. Some political analysts said the weak showing could be the
party's downfall.
   One former member of the Conservative Party's old guard, Alvaro
Gomez, got about 24 percent of the vote. But Gomez ran as an
independent because of a feud with the Conservatives.
   Another sign of readiness for political change was the approval
of an assembly to debate changes in Colombia's 104-year-old
constitution.
   Among the proposals are electoral changes guaranteeing that
minority parties get representation in congress and cabinet posts.
Proponents of reform also seek to overhaul Colombia's justice
system, which has fallen prey to corruption and intimidation by
drug traffickers.
   Gaviria has said the assembly must represent a wide spectrum of
society. It will include not just the political parties, but labor
unions, peasants, educators, university students, lawyers, judges,
the military and the Catholic church.
   ``I hope that this will be an instrument of reconciliation
between Colombians,'' Gaviria said.

<HEAD>Sources: Bodies Offered in Prisoner Swap Not Those of Israeli

<TEXT>
   Lebanese Shiites offered to trade what they
said were the bodies of two Israeli soldiers for Israeli-held
Shiite prisoners, but sources said Monday the bodies were actually
those of pro-Israeli Lebanese militiamen.
   The offer of a swap, from the Shiite Moslem militia Amal, was
initially published in the Beirut daily al-Anwar on May 12.
   The move came after Iran and allied groups in Lebanon demanded a
gesture from Israel to encourage the freeing of more Western
hostages in Lebanon. Two American hostages _ Frank Reed and Robert
Polhill _ were freed in April, the first U.S. captives to be
released in 3{ years.
   The liberal Israeli daily Haaretz quoted unnamed sources as
saying the bodies in question were actually those of Lebanese
members of the South Lebanon Army, a 2,500-member force trained and
equipped by Israel to patrol a buffer zone in south Lebanon.
   The South Lebanon Army holds more than 300 Shiite prisoners at
the al-Khiam prison in south Lebanon.
   Sources who demanded anonymity said Israeli experts had
concluded the bodies being offered were not those of any of the
Israelis missing in Lebanon.
   The sources declined to give details, but said South Lebanon
Army commander Antoine Lahad expressed no immediate interest in
arranging a trade on the basis of Amal's offer.
   Lahad has said any prisoner exchange must involve missing South
Lebanon Army militiamen and Israeli soldiers.
   Four Israeli soldiers are missing in action since the 1982
Lebanon war and three other servicemen are believed to be held by
Shiite groups linked to the pro-Iranian Hezbollah militia.
   Most of the Western hostages in Lebanon are believed held by
factions of Hezbollah, a fundamentalist Shiite Moslem group that
gets considerable financial support from Iran.
   One of the groups demanding the release of Palestinian and
Shiite Lebanese prisoners in Israel is the Islamic Jihad for the
Liberation of Palestine, which claims to hold two Americans.
   They are among six Americans missing in Lebanon. The longest
held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for the
Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>South Africa Says Discriminatory Law To Be Scrapped</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Monday
that within days it will move to scrap the law that allows
segregation of public facilities such as swimming pools and
libraries.
   The announcement marks the latest in a series of reforms by the
government of President F.W. de Klerk.
   But in another development that appeared to be part of the
government's campaign to get the African National Congress to
renounce political violence, the ruling National Party accused
Nelson Mandela of holding outdated policies and not providing clear
direction to his supporters.
   The rare public criticism of Mandela on Monday came two days
after the ANC leader accused de Klerk and his government of not
moving fast enough to dismantle apartheid.
   In Cape Town, Planning Minister Hernus Kriel said he would
introduce legislation this week in Parliament to repeal the
Separate Amenities Act, which allows for the segregation of a wide
range of public facilities.
   Anti-apartheid groups have said they would welcome the repeal of
the act as one of several steps the government must make to
dismantle its policies of racial segregation.
   Despite the law, restaurants, movie theaters, hotels, parks and
public transportation all have been integrated in recent years.
   But some conservative communities have used the Separate
Amenities Act to maintain whites-only swimming pools, libraries and
recreation centers.
   De Klerk, who assumed power in August, said last year that the
Separate Amenities Act would be eliminated during Parliament's 1990
session.
   The act does not cover schools and neighborhoods, which along
with politics are the main institutions still segregated by law.
The country's 28 million blacks have no voice in national affairs.
   De Klerk says he wants to end discrimination in South Africa and
negotiate a new constitution with black opposition groups.
   The de Klerk government earlier this month declared public
hospitals open to all races, although some aspects of the policy
remain unclear and full implementation is expected to take months.
   De Klerk also has opened beaches to all races, allowed peaceful
protests, legalized black opposition groups and released some
political prisoners, including Mandela.
   In addition, the government has opened four small neighborhoods
to all races and says it plans to change the law segregating
residential areas, possibly by next year.
   Mandela and the ANC leadership, meanwhile, were criticized by
the National Party's official mouthpiece, The Nationalist, for
``ambivalent and hesitant'' leadership.
   ``Mr. Mandela's utterances ... have only served to underscore
this organization's confusing profile on important issues such as
the armed struggle (and) political violence,'' The Nationalist said.
   ``The time has come for leaders like Mr. Mandela and others to
give clearer, stronger direction and bolder leadership to their
followers to show it is possible for the ANC to rise above
predictable, outdated populist rhetoric,'' it added.
   The government has urged the ANC to renounce its largely dormant
and ineffective guerrilla campaign. The ANC says it will continue
to support armed resistance until apartheid is ended.
   On Saturday, Mandela said de Klerk was not moving fast enough to
end apartheid. He also said he felt the president ``is not strong
enough to end the violence going on.''
   Police said Monday they found the bodies of 12 blacks killed in
a vicious faction fight that involved some 400 combatants.
   The battle took place Saturday near Richmond, 45 miles west of
the port city of Durban. It was the latest round of black-on-black
violence in the southeastern province of Natal. Some 4,000 blacks
have been killed in Natal since 1986.
   Police said the victims were shot, stabbed and bludgeoned to
death. An unknown number of people were injured and about 60 huts
were burned down, police said. Police said one side attacked the
other in apparent revenge for an earlier killing.

   After Lech Walesa returned home exhausted
from a second middle-of-the-night meeting with striking rail

   ``He didn't say anything,'' Danuta Walesa told the radio

left his Gdansk home for strike headquarters about 80 miles away.
He returned home at 3:30 a.m. Monday after persuading rail workers
to suspend the work stoppage.
   ``I wanted him to get some rest. I didn't want to bother him
with any questions and so I just read the communique that I saw had
been written,'' Mrs. Walesa told state radio.
   Mrs. Walesa has appeared only infrequently as a public figure
during the decade her husband has led Solidarity. In a rare
personal comment, she was quoted recently as saying the volatile
Walesa is sometimes hard to live with.
   But Monday, there was no hesitation about his national
responsibilities.
   The strike ``wasn't good and what we needed was an agreement,''
she said. ``And I am happy it was my husband who did it.''

   A Canadian skydiver plummeted 13,000 feet
to his death after his main and reserve parachutes became
entangled, police said Monday.
   The man, identified as 42-year-old Robin Sutherland of Montreal,
jumped from a small plane with several other skydivers Sunday,
police said.
   After pulling his ripcord, the victim became entangled in the
main chute, said state Trooper Timothy Caulfield. He opened his
back-up chute, but that became entangled in the main chute,
Caulfield said.
   He landed in a wooded area a quarter-mile south of the landing
zone at Gardiner Airport in Ulster County, about 60 miles south of
Albany, Caulfield said.
   Sutherland was pronounced dead at the scene by a doctro from the
county medical examiner's office. Police said he died of massive
trauma.

<HEAD>Rockets Kill 6 as Traditional Council Opens</HEAD>

   A volley of rockets hit the Afghan
capital on Monday, killing six people and wounding 20, as a
traditional council convened to adopt democratic reforms, state-run
radio said.
   Twenty-two surface-to-surface missiles fired by Moslem
guerrillas into neighborhoods in northern and western Kabul caused
extensive damage, said Kabul Radio, monitored in Islamabad.
   The guerrillas, supported by the United States, Saudi Arabia and
other Arab states, are trying to oust the Soviet-backed government
that seized power in a violent 1978 coup. The guerrillas insist
they aim only at military targets, but have admitted their rockets
occasionally misfire and hit civilians.
   Hundreds of rockets have slammed into the capital in recent
weeks, killing and wounding scores of people.
   Diplomats said the attacks appeared to coincide with the
convening of the Loya Jirgah, a traditional assembly of 772 people
representing different regions and tribal groups in Afghanistan.
   The council was expected to adopt constitutional reforms that
would change the name of the ruling People's Democratic Party of
Afghanistan, revise the party charter to remove all references to
its Marxist past and initiate steps to end the party's monopoly on
power.
   Diplomats in Kabul and Islamabad have said the changes appear
largely cosmetic and cautioned against making parallels between
Afghanistan and the countries of East Europe that have undergone
dramatic democratic reforms.
   In his opening address, President Najibullah reiterated his
government's proposal for a peaceful settlement of the war that has
claimed more than 1.5 million lives and left the country in ruins.
   Najibullah's plan calls for a six-month cease-fire, an
international peace conference and the establishment of a
transitional government followed by internationally-supervised
elections. The president uses only one name.
   ``War is not the way to settle the Afghan problem. There is no
other way but through negotiation,'' the 44-year-old president said
in remarks broadcast Monday night. ``I pledge to utilize my best
efforts to bring peace to the country.''
   The guerrillas, who are based in Pakistan and control 90 percent
of the Afghan countryside, have routinely refused power-sharing
arrangements with Najibullah.

<TEXT>
   Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley
was flown to Miami early Monday for treatment of pneumonia, the
Jamaican government said.
   Manley, 65, was flown by air ambulance from the Jamaican capital
of Kingston at 3 a.m. and was taken to the Miami Heart Institute
where a diagnosis of ``atypical pneumonia'' was made, according to
a statement from the Jamaica House in Kingston.
   Last month, it was announced that Manley has cancer.
   ``He has been undergoing tests and we're waiting now for the
results of those tests,'' said Hartley Neita, an aide with Manley
in Miami Beach. ``From there on, the doctors will go full blast on
treatment.''
   He said no one could speculate on how long Manley would be
hospitalized.
   Neita said Manley watched a little of the French Open tennis
tournament on television, but spent most of the day resting.
   ``We're not pressing him at all. The purpose is to rest and
recover as soon as possible,'' Neita said.
   The Jamaica House statement quoted a message by President Bush
sent through the U.S. Embassy in Kingston in which the president
expressed concern for the prime minister's health.
   It said Bush offered to send a military aircraft to Kingston but
Manley was transported by a private air ambulance.
   Manley is a socialist who has moderated his positions since
losing 1980 elections after eight years as prime minister. He led
his People's National Party back back into power in February 1989
after winning 1988 elections.
   Manley was admitted to University Hospital in Kingston on Sunday
where the pneumonia was first diagnosed.
   The prime minister was to undergo prostate surgery June 5 at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The cancerous
growth was discovered last month during a routine medical
examination. At the time, the Jamaican government said his chances
for recovery were excellent.

   An unseasonable rainstorm dumped record rain
Monday on southern California, which is in the fourth year of a
drought, snarling traffic and contributing to two deaths.
   But the rain came too late to help with the drought. Warm
weather will cause it largely to evaporate rather than percolate
into the soil.
   The storm dropped an inch of rain on Los Angeles, the National
Weather Service said. The previous high May 28 precipitation was
0.12 of an inch, in 1971.
   The Santa Monica Freeway through downtown Los Angeles was closed
for several hours during the night by flooding, and two lanes of
the Harbor Freeway was closed during the morning by a mudslide.
   A California Highway Patrol spokesman said debris and trash had
collected in storm drains because so much time had passed since the
last storm.
   Two traffic deaths were blamed on the storm, one in an accident
on the Pomona Freeway near Chino, and one on the San Diego Freeway
just south of Wilmington.
   The rain also closed the outdoor Renaissance Pleasure Faire in
San Bernardino.
   A weather service spokesman called it an unusually late winter
storm because of its origin in the Gulf of Alaska.
   Though the rainfall set a record for May 28, it was nowhere near
the record for any day in May. That was 2.02 inches, set May 8,
1977.
   The wet weather almost spoiled the last day of the Memorial Day
weekend.
   Disneyland, Knotts Berry Farm, and Universal Studios reported
late starts for the rainy Monday morning, although clearing skies
salvaged the rest of the day's business. Universal Studios had
fewer than 10 percent of its normal 3,000 visitors for the first
tour, said spokesman Sean Armstrong.

   Wet, stormy weather advanced across the southeastern quarter of
the nation Monday, spinning off at least one tornado, and a strong
storm in the West blew snow across the mountains.
   At midday, showers and thunderstorms reached over central and
southern Ohio across southwestern Pennsylvania, western Maryland,
Virginia, West Virginia, much of Kentucky, much of Tennessee, North
Carolina, South Carolina, parts of Georgia, northwestern and
southern Florida, southern Mississippi, southern and central
Louisiana, and eastern Texas.
   A tornado touched down in eastern Kentucky, knocking out power
to a Rowan County water pumping station and overturning a hangar
and destroying an office at a small airport, officials said. No
injuries were reported.
   State Trooper Lon Fields said the tornado overturned several
planes at the Morehead-Rowan County Airport, blew debris onto
several others and apparently carried off two more.
   A tornado touched down near Cave Run Lake, Ky., the National
Weather Service said.
   Severe weather watches were posted from northern Florida to
southern Virginia and West Virginia.
   By 7 a.m. the rainfall for May at Louisville, Ky., had reached
10.72 inches, almost a quarter of an inch above the previous record
for the whole month of May. And rain continued falling.
   Rain and showers extended from southern California and
Washington state to the Rockies as a strong spring storm moved
across southern California with gusty wind.
   The storm dropped an inch of rain on Los Angeles, the weather
service said. The previous record for the date was just 0.12 of an
inch, in 1971.
   Wind gusted to 40 mph during the morning at Show Low, Ariz.
   Snow fell over the mountains of southern Utah, with rain at
lower elevations, and headed into western Colorado.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
1.81 inches at Goldsboro, N.C.; 1.51 inches at Myrtle Beach, S.C.;
1.17 inches at Leesville, La.; and 1.05 inches at McComb, Miss.
   Parts of California got record rainfall Sunday. Sacramento got
1.56 inches, a record for the date, and downtown San Francisco got
1.47 inches, a record for any date in May.
   The nation's temperatures at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 43 at
Truckee, Calif., to 95 at Beeville, Texas.
   Monday's low for the Lower 48 was 35 at Hibbing, Minn.

   Police opened fire Monday on
demonstrating students and teachers, killing a 14-year-old student
on the doorstep of his home, witnesses said.
   Hospitals reported at least three people were seriously wounded
in the incident, which began when police opened fire with tear gas
to disperse some students and teachers demonstrating for better pay
and larger student allowances. The protesters responded by pelting
police with stones.
   Witnesses said the slain student, Yakuba Bah, was struck by
police gunfire while standing at his front door. There was no
immediate comment from officials.
   It was unclear what prompted the shooting.
   It was the second such clash between teachers and police in a
week.
   On Thursday, teachers and students rampaged through the city
fighting with police. Several teachers were arrested and most
teachers have refused to return to work since that incident.
   The trouble began when police broke up a meeting of teachers who
wanted to replace their government-controlled union with an
independent body.
   Government sources said the administration has increased student
allowances and was paying overdue student grants. The government
also planned to increase teacher allowances, but no details were
available.
   Sierra Leone's government is near bankruptcy and has been forced
to reduce spending. On several occasions teachers and other
government employees have not been paid on time.
   The currency, the leone, has been frequently devalued and the
elimination of subsidies for food staples and energy has produced
soaring inflation. Prices for many staples have doubled or tripled
the past two years.

<HEAD>ANC: Nelson Mandela Hospitalized for Physical Checkup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela has been hospitalized for a physical check-up
and a rest before he begins a European tour next week, an ANC
spokesman said Monday.
   ``This is nothing sudden,'' said Ahmed Kathrada, a former prison
colleague of Mandela and spokesman for the ANC in South Africa.
``He is there for a routine check-up. We had planned for it.''
   Kathrada said Mandela, 71, had been admitted Sunday night to the
Parklane Clinic in Johannesburg after addressing a rally in
Kimberley. He was expected to be released from the clinic Tuesday
morning, Kathrada said.
   Mandela, who was treated for tuberculosis in 1988, returned last
week from a tour of eight African countries. He also made a trip
through Africa and to Britain and Sweden shortly after he was freed
Feb. 11 from 27 years in prison.
   ``Now that he has finished a round of rallies, it was time for
him to have a check-up before he begins his trip to Europe,''
Kathrada said. ``This is not a new thing. It started when we were
in prison, not only him, but some of us, the older ones, were taken
for regular checkups at the instruction of the prison authorities.''
   He said Mandela has been examined by a doctor since he left
prison, but this was his first major check-up in a clinic.

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev returns to
Canada on Tuesday for a brief visit to the country that introduced
him to the Western-style markets he now hopes to install in the
Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev, en route to the United States for his second summit
with President Bush, is to meet with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
and Canada's governor-general during a 29-hour stopover in Ottawa.
   The relatively light schedule should give the Soviet leader and
his wife, Raisa, a day to adapt to the eight-hour time change
before their arrival in Washington late Wednesday.
   The four hours of scheduled talks with Mulroney will cover a
range of issues, from the Soviets' handling of the breakaway
republic of Lithuania to differences over the future status of a
unified Germany, officials on both sides say.
   Canada, a member of NATO, wants the new Germany to assume Bonn's
seat in the Western alliance. Gorbachev has warned continued German
participation in NATO could slow the Soviet military withdrawal
from East Europe, particularly in East Germany, the front line of
Soviet defenses against a European invasion.
   Canada has a substantial number of Lithuanians, including some
active in their homeland's independence drive. But Mulroney must
tread delicately on that issue or risk a lecture from Gorbachev on
how to handle the equally sticky problem of separatism by the
French-speaking province of Quebec.
   The Conservative prime minister faces the gravest political
crisis of his 6-year tenure as the nation approaches a June 23
deadline for ratification of the Meech Lake accord that would
recognize Quebec as a ``distinct society.''
   Quebec is the only one of Canada's 10 provinces never to sign
the 1982 constitution. It has refused to do so unless the nine
English-speaking provinces ratify the Meech Lake agreement
affording Quebec special recognition.
   The refusal of three provinces, Manitoba, New Brunswick and
Newfoundland, to approve the accord has rekindled a Quebec
separatist movement that threatens to split the Canadian federation.
   Gorbachev is to arrive in Ottawa at midday Tuesday and go
directly to a private lunch with Mulroney at the prime minister's
official residence. Later in the afternoon, the president is to
meet Governor-General Ray Hnatyshyn, the appointed representative
of Queen Elizabeth II.
   Wednesday is to feature a wreath-laying ceremony at the national
War Memorial followed by another meeting with Mulroney. A
late-afternoon luncheon at the National Gallery of Art and a brief
press conference with Mulroney precede Gorbachev's departure for
Washington.
   The Soviet president first visited Canada in 1983 when, as the
youngest member of the Communist Party's ruling Politburo, he
toured the country with a parliamentary delegation.
   Gorbachev, then in charge of the Soviet Union's agriculture
program, was introduced to Western production methods and
supermarkets brimming with produce.
   That visit also provided Gorbachev time for extended talks with
the Kremlin's ambassador to Canada, Alexander Yakovlev, who had
been exiled from the Kremlin leadership for his unorthodox views.
   After he assumed the leadership of the party in March 1985,
Gorbachev brought Yakovlev back and elevated him to the Politburo.
Today the former ambassador is widely regarded as the principal
architect of Gorbachev's reforms.
   Yakovlev has helped guide the Soviet Union toward improved
relations with the West and advocates a market-oriented economy,
which the Soviet leadership is hoping to phase in as a replacement
for the ailing system of central planning blamed for the country's
protracted economic crisis.

<HEAD>Historic Buildings, Half of Town Sold at Auction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ULM, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Auctioneer A.L. ``Buck'' Buchanan spent
the weekend selling off half of town. And the residents are
delighted.
   ``It couldn't have gone any better, really,'' Buchanan said
Sunday of the sale that included about 6{ acres, 100-year-old log
cabins and antique farm equipment and furnishings.
   About 1,800 people turned out Saturday for the auction ordered
by the Texas Historical Foundation.
   The properties sold once belonged to the late Jeanne Blocker, a
Houston investor, and her husband, John, a former oilman.
   Mrs. Blocker had a vision: to create a historic village within
New Ulm.
   She painstakingly acquired nearly every rundown log structure in
the area. The couple also bought about half the town's acreage and
several old buildings, and brought in buildings and furnishings
from as far as 50 miles away.
   Mrs. Blocker had cleared some land, built a pond and small
waterfall and restored a handful of buildings when the oil bust
stalled her plans in 1984.
   She died in 1988, and her husband donated everything except
three pieces of land to the Texas Historical Foundation.
   ``Mrs. Blocker worked very hard on all of this,'' said Buchanan.
``She did an awful lot of research and planning.''
   But for this town of about 100, what once promised economic boom
had become a financial drain. Most of the Blockers' half of town
has been tax exempt: They bought it as a non-profit foundation.
   Meanwhile, the steep prices the Blockers paid drove up property
values, and taxes, for everyone else in town, most of whom are
retirees on fixed incomes.
   The take was still being tallied, but Buchanan said the the
well-preserved MacKinsky Dogtrot Log House, built in the late 1700s
or early 1800s, fetched the top price _ more than $6,000.
   Also sold was a creamery, a saloon and a Ford Model T repair
shop. Buchanan said some structures will be moved, others reopened
or renovated.
   The historical foundation will use the proceeds toward an
unspecified project elsewhere.

   Sheets covering a patient caught fire during
surgery Monday, filling an operating room with smoke so thick that
staff members couldn't extinguish the flames. The patient died.
   ``The sheets just caught on fire. It's bizarre,'' said Fire
Department spokesman Pat Marek.
   Investigators were seeking the cause of the fire at the
sprawling UCLA Medical Center on the campus of the University of
California, Los Angeles, Marek said.
   An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death of the
patient, 26-year-old Angela Hernandez, who had been undergoing
surgery for injuries suffered in an automobile accident, said
campus spokeswoman Vicki Beck.
   It was not immediately known if Ms. Hernandez died because of
the fire and smoke, her injuries, or a combination of the two.
   Eight to 10 medical staff members, including doctors and nurses,
were performing the surgery when flames engulfed the surgical cloth
over the patient, said Ms. Beck.
   ``There was a serious attempt by the staff to extinguish the
fire,'' she said.
   But the smoke became so bad that the operating room staff
members had to leave the room, and university police arriving at
the scene could not get inside the room, said Ms. Beck.
   About five minutes after the fire broke out, city firefighters
arrived, but by then the blaze had mostly burned itself out, said
Marek.
   ``The fire was just kind of smoldering,'' he said.
   The fire was isolated to the operating table and the hospital
had no structural damage. Nobody else was injured, but the smoke
forced the closure of all operating rooms for the day so they could
be sterilized.
   It was the second time in 1{ years a patient died in an
operating room blaze in a southern California hospital.
   In October 1988, a 15-day-old boy was fatally burned at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center when a spark from an electric
cauterizer, used to stop bleeding, started a fire that was
strengthened by a high concentration of oxygen in the room.
   UCLA Medical Center officials declined to say if doctors had
been using a cauterizer Monday.

   Gunmen killed a leading opposition
member of Parliament and at least 27 others Monday in a new
outbreak of ethnic violence in Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's home
province, authorities said.
   Ms. Bhutto flew to this troubled port Monday night for an
emergency meeting with the leaders of Sind Province and the army
chief of staff, Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg, who cut short a visit to
Bangladesh.
   Ms. Bhutto's weak, 17-month-old government, has come under
increasing pressure from opposition parties to dismiss the
provincial government of Sind, headed by her Pakistan People's
Party, and declare a state of emergency to curb escalating violence.
   Members of her party also began demanding action Monday after
Sen. Moshin Siddiqui was shot and killed on his way to a hospital
to visit survivors of sniper attacks Sunday that left 40 people
dead and 75 injured, police said.
   ``Organized gangs have become the order of the day. No road in
the province is safe and safety of life cannot be assured,'' said
Makhdoom Khaleeq-uz-Zaman, who represents Ms. Bhutto's party in the
National Assembly, the lawmaking lower house of Parliament.
   ``The situation has worsened to the extent that even relatives
of federal and provincial ministers are not safe. They are being
kidnapped for ransom or they are being killed,'' he said.
   Besides the 65-year-old legislator from the opposition Pakistan
Moslem League, at least 27 others, including three policemen, were
gunned down in random attacks and clashes between rival ethnic
groups and security forces in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city,
police said. Another 72 were wounded.
   Authorities deployed additional troops and clamped an
around-the-clock curfew on five districts Monday, including the
area around Karachi's international airport. Military curfews were
imposed in three districts on Sunday.
   In Hyderabad, 150 miles to the north, residents took advantage
of two two-hour curfew breaks to quickly buy food and return to
their businesses, authorities said.
   The city of 3 million was calm for the first time in two weeks.
   Soldiers patrolled the streets, stood guard on rooftops and
checked all vehicles in an attempt to prevent shootings that have
plagued that city since May 15 and claimed at least 135 lives.
   The army moved into Hyderabad on Sunday after security forces
opened fire on a procession of about 10,000 people who defied a
curfew imposed to stop the bloodshed. At least 60 people were
killed and nearly 300 wounded, officials said.
   The soldiers, who are trying to stop clashes between rival
ethnic groups, were greeted by residents shouting ``Pakistan
Zindabad!'' (Pakistan Lives Forever!) from their houses.
   Military officials have received hundreds of letters in recent
months from residents of Sind asking the army to take control of
the province and restore law and order.
   Military officials, tainted by a decade of army rule, have said
the civilian government must find a solution to the bloodshed.
   Kidnappings, assassinations and sniper atacks in Sind Province
have left more than 2,000 people dead in the past few years.
   Police blame the current wave of violence on a militant faction
of the Mohajir Qami Movement, a small political party representing
descendants of Moslem Indians who immigrated to Pakistan during the
1947 partition of the subcontinent.
   The movement is demanding recognition for the Indian immigrants
as Pakistan's fifth nationality, along with Pathans, Punjabis,
Baluch and Sindis.
   The movement once backed Ms. Bhutto's government but withdrew
its support in November and forced a no-confidence vote she
narrowly survived.
   The Mohajirs, or immigrants, constitute a majority in Karachi
and Hyderabad and are considered better educated and more
politically conscious.

   President Saddam Hussein, opening a two-day
Arab League summit, said Monday that if Israel deployed nuclear or
chemical weapons against Arabs, Iraq would respond with ``weapons
of mass destruction.''
   Also speaking to the 15 kings, sheiks and presidents, Jordan's
King Hussein urged Arabs to use their oil wealth to influence world
politics.
   The conference was called as a show of Arab unity against what
Saddam has said is a Western and Israeli campaign against Iraq. The
summit was also to seek ways to stem the large-scale emigration of
Soviet Jews to Israel.
   ``The potentials of any Arab nation have to be in the service of
all Arabs to safeguard national security,'' Saddam said.
   ``Should Israel strike, we shall strike back firmly. Should it
use weapons of mass destruction, we shall use all the weapons of
mass destruction that are in our possession.''
   ``We'll never give up Palestine,'' he added to loud applause.
   In a late-night closed session, Palestine Liberation
Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat warned that Israel was seeking
to occupy more Arab territory to establish ``greater Israel ...
from the Nile to the Euphrates.''
   He called for a meeting of the Defense Council of Arab League
defense ministers to map out a joint strategy on the issue within a
month.
   ``We are duty-bound to use all weapons, including sanctions _
economic boycotts and political and psychological pressures _
against countries, states, establishments and companies that
participate in aggression against Arab territory,'' Arafat said in
a speech later distributed to reporters.
   Saddam did not specify what type of weapons Iraq might use
against the Jewish state. Arabs commonly use the phrase ``weapons
of mass destruction'' to refer to nuclear weapons and more advanced
chemical weapons.
   Baghdad has been building an arsenal of long-range missiles
capable of hitting Israel. Saddam also has said Baghdad has stocks
of binary chemical weapons, and in March he threatened to use them
against Israel if attacked.
   Arabs claim the Israelis have 200 nuclear weapons, although
Israel denies it.
   In Jerusalem, Yossi Ben-Aharon, a top aide to Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir, said Israel was concerned about Saddam's threats.
He also said Iraq recently moved troops into Jordan near Israel's
border but did not specify how many troops were involved.
   In his speech, Saddam accused the United States of financing and
encouraging ``Israeli aggression and expansionism.''
   ``The United States bears a basic and primary responsibility for
the policy ... practiced by the Zionist entity against the Arabs,''
he told Arab leaders at Baghdad's ornate conference center.
   Arabs say the West and Israel have mounted a campaign against
Baghdad following the arrests in England of several people accused
of trying to smuggle nuclear triggers to Iraq. Several European
nations also intercepted alleged parts of an Iraqi ``super gun.''
   Saddam has said the developments were designed to justify an
impending Israeli attack on Iraqi military or industrial facilities
similar to the air raid on the Osirak nuclear reactor near Baghdad
in 1981.
   Hussein said Arab leaders should use oil as a political tool.
   ``Our region contains 65 percent of the oil reserves in the
world, and through the Gulf pass 40 percent of oil shipments....''
These resources ``if properly utilized ... place us among the
vigorous powers within the movement of history.''
   But the summit, designed to foster unity, convened in the shadow
of a sharp split between pro-U.S. governments and hard-liners over
a letter to be sent to the superpower summit that begins Wednesday
in Washington.
   The letter was to address the expected emigration of as many as
750,000 Soviet Jews to Israel over the next few years. The Arabs
fear many Soviet Jews will settle in the Israeli-occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   Jordan, which neighbors the West Bank, is concerned that
large-scale Jewish settlement in the region will drive Palestinians
into Jordan and destabilize the kingdom.
   And there was disagreement between the hard-liners led by Saddam
and the moderates, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia, over how tough
a line they should take against the United States.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak suggested the summit ``letter
to the outside world be humane and rational, devoid of
overstatement and understatement.''
   The conference was boycotted by Syrian President Hafez Assad,
Saddam's archrival in the Arab world, and by President Elias Hrawi
of Lebanon. Syrian troops control two-thirds of Hrawi's war-torn
country.
   The opening was delayed by an abortive last-minute attempt by
Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi to persuade Assad to attend the
conference in the name of Arab unity.

<HEAD>Man Left Hanging Hours at Amtrak Station With Electrical Burns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man believed to be scavenging copper wire
remained in critical condition Monday from electrical burns he
suffered at an Amtrak substation, where he hung upside down for
hours as rescuers waited to make sure the power was turned off.
   It took several calls from the District of Columbia Fire
Department before Amtrak employees in Philadelphia had power to the
128,000 volt substation cut off and more than an hour for an Amtrak
engineering crew to arrive.
   In the meantime, Wendell Edmondson, 36, was dangling upside down
from a beam 15 feet off the ground and was naked, his clothes
apparently burned off by the contact with high voltage.
   Witnesses reported seeing a flash like lightning shortly after
noticing him inside the station about 9:30 p.m. Saturday.
   ``One of the fallacies that people operate under is that if they
don't touch any of the wires then they are relatively safe,'' said
fire department spokesman Ted Holmes. ``If you come within a
certain distance the voltage can arc over to you. But they don't
understand the gravity of that much voltage.''
   Edmondson, whose last known address was a homeless shelter, was
listed in critical condition Monday in the burn unit of the
Washington Hospital Center, where he was flown after he was freed
at about 11:50 p.m. Saturday.
   Amtrak spokesman Bruce Heard said the response to the emergency
``is frankly a pretty good response on a Saturday night.''
   Holmes said Fire Chief Ray Alfred plans to write Amtrak
officials to determine what went wrong and to establish more
efficient procedures for the future.

   The Air Force pilot killed when his F-16A
jet crashed into a rural south Georgia community was eulogized at a
memorial service Monday while investigators continued to search for
clues to the cause of the crash.
   One woman was killed on the ground.
   Although the F-16A has an ejection seat, Maj. Archie E. ``Gene''
Stuart stayed with his plane Friday in Pearson. Some witnesses said
the plane initially seemed headed for Atkinson County High School,
which houses about 1,000 students, but pulled away before crashing
a half-mile away.
   The Rev. Douglas Reddick of Northside Baptist Church in
Valdosta, one of the ministers officiating at the service for
Stuart, said that although no one knows yet what happened, if
Stuart did stay with the plane to miss the school ``it is
consistent with his character.''
   Stuart, 39, was stationed with the 68th Tactical Fighter
Squadron at Moody Air Force Base at Valdosta
   The plane went down in a residential area a mile north of
Pearson, about 40 miles from Valdosta, six minutes after taking off
on a training mission to Lake George Weapons Range near Daytona
Beach, Fla.
   Air Force officials formed a 50-member task force to attempt to
determine the cause.
   Officials said it was too early to tell if Stuart was trying to
avoid hitting the school and added that the investigation could
take a month or more.
   Killed on the ground was Marion Lanier, 58, of Pearson. She was
buried Sunday. Stuart is to be buried Thursday in Pennsylvania.

<HEAD>Convoy of `Little Ships' Returns from Dunkirk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RAMSGATE, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To the cheers of thousands, a flotilla
of 50 vessels returned from Dunkirk, France, on Monday after
observances marking the 50th anniversary of the famous World War II
evacuation of Allied troops.
   The flotilla, which left Dunkirk in the morning following a
weekend of memorial observances, was accompanied across the busy
shipping lanes of the English Channel by four Royal Navy vessels.
   Thousands of people lining the Ramsgate cliffs on the south
coast of England cheered and military bands blared as the oddly
assorted convoy of ``Little Ships'' came into view.
   The seagoing paddle-steamer The Waverley, packed with
spectators, went out to mid-channel to escort the boats back.
Monday's perfect sailing conditions contrasted with rough seas that
caused several boats to abort their passage to France on Thursday.
   Among those atop the cliffs were some present in 1940 when
fishermen, yachtsmen and amateur sailors in their ``Little Ships''
crossed the Channel to rescue Allied troops trapped on the beaches
of Dunkirk by German forces.
   From May 27 to June 2 of that year the armada of civilian
vessels rescued more than 330,000 men from the beaches.
   ``The memories have come flooding back today; some happy because
so many of the boys were rescued, but some sad. We must never
forget those who died,'' said one of those rescued, Ernie Thompson,
who served with the Cameron Scottish Rifles.
   On Sunday, the beaches of Dunkirk were packed with thousands of
veterans, their families and local townspeople commemorating the
rescue mission.

<TEXT>
   More than 200 Soviet immigrants arrived
in Israel on Monday on a flight financed by Christian supporters of
the Jewish state.
   Representatives of the Jerusalem-based International Christian
Embassy met the immigrants at the Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv,
holding flowers and placards that read ``Operation Second Exodus.''
   The immigrants, who arrived via Hungary, were also met by U.S.
Reps. William Lehman of Florida and Peter A. DeFazio of Oregon, who
are in Israel to study resettlement programs for Soviet Jews.
   The two Democrats said they would be discussing the issue with
Israeli officials, focusing on the settlement of immigrants in the
occupied territories.
   ``We have been told that more than 99 percent of the refugees
are choosing to live elsewhere other than in occupied areas, but
this will be discussed in detail when we meet government
officials,'' DeFazio told reporters.
   The United States and the Soviet Union strongly object to the
settlement of Soviet immigrants in the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip, areas captured by Israel in 1967. The Arab countries view
such resettlement as part of an Israeli expansionist plot to drive
Palestinians out.
   Israel says it has no policy of directing immigrants to the
occupied areas although it cannot stop them from choosing to settle
there. Only about 200 of the 48,000 Soviet Jews who have arrived
since 1989 have settled in the occupied territories.
   Johann Luckhoff, director of the International Christian
Embassy, said his group has managed to raise about $150,000 to fund
two flights of Soviet Jews and intends to continue the campaign.
The group represents Christian supporters of Israel in more than 70
countries.
   Luckhoff said in a statement that, ``We are actually involved in
saving lives ... and we are also helping the Jewish people fulfill
their destiny of returning to their roots in the land of Israel.''

<TEXT>
   An Amtrak passenger train slammed into a
tanker truck loaded with sewage sludge on Monday, injuring nine
people, none seriously, authorities said.
   The accident happened shortly before noon at a rural railroad
crossing between Indiantown and Okeechobee in southeast Florida.
   The northbound train, on the regular Miami-New York Silver
Meteor run, was carrying 153 passengers in 10 cars pulled by one
locomotive, said Bruce Heard, an Amtrak spokesman in Washington,
D.C.
   ``The train ... hit the trailer part of the truck, which was
loaded with sewage,'' said Linda Main, a Florida Highway Patrol
dispatcher. ``Stuff flew all over the place.''
   The train was running full-speed, said Lt. Jim Howell of the
Highway Patrol.
   ``It was doing 70 to 80 mph, which is pretty standard for that
part of the county,'' he said. ``It virtually cut the tanker
portion of the truck in half, and heavily damaged the locomotive
and two of the passenger cars.''
   The engineer escaped injury but the train's fireman suffered
facial cuts, and both crew members were covered with sludge, Howell
said.
   The fireman and eight passengers were taken to Martin County
Memorial Hospital, where nursing supervisor Louise Frates said all
were expected to be released after treatment for cuts, bumps and
bruises.
   Heard said the other passengers were taken to a school, then
bused to Okeechobee.
   They were picked up there by what had been a southbound Silver
Meteor that was reversed, Heard said. Southbound passengers
continued their journey by bus.
   CSX Transportation of Jacksonville, which owns the tracks, sent
cleanup crews, Heard said. He expected the tracks to be back to
normal by early evening. Only some freight trains may be delayed,
he added.
   Howell said the truck driver, Hector Solar, was ticketed for
failure to stop at a rilroad crossing, which led to a private ranch
and orange groves.
   The sewage had been treated to a sludge state, ``but it has a
potent smell and you still don't want to be around it,'' Howell
said.

<HEAD>Ceausescu's Son Drunk When He Ordered Gunfire, Commander Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIOREL URMA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SIBIU, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nicu Ceausescu was drunk when he ordered
local army and police units to shoot at demonstrators rising
against his dictator father, the former military commander of Sibiu
garrison testified Monday.
   The alleged shooting order was not heeded, and under
cross-examination, Col. Aurel Dragomir acknowledged it would have
been ignored even if repeated.
   ``An order given by local party organs must be reported through
levels to our superiors (the Defense Ministry in Bucharest) and is
carried out only after their approval,'' he said, adding such
approval was never received.
   Ceausescu, 39, former Communist Party secretary of Sibiu county,
is charged with genocide for his purported part in efforts to
suppress the popular revolt that ended Nicolae Ceausescu's 24-year
hold on power. He pleaded not guilty.
   Dragomir repeated charges contained in the indictment read at
trial opening Saturday that Nicu Ceausescu demanded institution of
a state of war in Romania and ordered the shooting of demonstrators
``without warning.''
   Former Interior Minister Tudor Postelnicu testified he received
no word of such a command and said a regional party secretary like
the defendant was not entitled to order security forces in his area
to fire on protesters.
   Such an order ``should by obligation be reported on a central
level'' to the Interior Ministry, but ``I received no information
that Nicu ordered shooting or no shooting,'' Postelnicu testified.
   Postelnicu was sentenced to life imprisonment for backing the
elder Ceausescu's order to fire on demonstrators. He was brought
from Aiud prison, wearing striped prison garb but not handcuffed.
   The charges were based on stenographers' notes of a telephone
conference call Dec. 17 between Nicu Ceausescu and local officials.
Dragomir, 40, said he took part in the conference call and quoted
Nicu Ceausescu as saying: ``We are in a state of war and not of
emergency. We shoot without warning.''
   He told a five-man military panel headed by Maj. Doru Ursu that
Nicu Ceausescu telephoned him the evening of Dec. 17 to make sure
the army was prepared to start shooting.
   ``Have you introduced cartridges in the barrels?,'' Dragomir
quoted the younger Ceausescu as asking. The colonel said he replied
``No'' and was told, ``You must introduce cartridges in the barrels
and shoot, because this is a war.''
   According to the indictment, 89 people were killed in Sibiu, 150
miles northwest of Bucharest. Soldiers who sided with the
demonstrators battled Nicolae Ceausescu's diehard security troops.
   Dragomir said Nicu Ceausescu was slightly intoxicated when he
gave the shooting order Dec. 17, and never repeated it in the
following days. The first bloody clashes in Sibiu occurred Dec. 21
and lasted about a week, he said.
   Camil Stroe, a veterinary surgeon and former director of the
police dog-training school, said Nicu Ceausescu took part in a
pheasant-hunting party that day where he and his entourage drank
wine and plum brandy.
   ``After the return to Sibiu, Nicu went straight to the
conference call,'' Stroe told the court. Dragomir said ``Nicu was
under the influence of alcohol, and he spoke with some difficulty
but rather coherently.''
   The revolution began in Timisoara Dec. 17 and spread to other
Transylvanian cities, including Sibiu, and to Bucharest.
   Communist dictator Ceausescu was captured on Dec. 22 and was
executed on Christmas Day.
   At least 20 former officials in Sibiu county have sentenced to
up to 20 years in prison on charges arising from the revolution.

   The once-adversarial armies of East Germany
and West Germany are establishing ties that include top-level
leadership contacts, as both nations put the Cold War further
behind them on the way to unification.
   For decades, the army of West Germany, a NATO member, was on
guard against the troops of East Germany, a staunch Warsaw Pact
member.
   West German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and his East
German counterpart, Rainer Eppelmann, attempted during a news
conference to calm neighboring countries' apprehensions about the
new cooperation.
   ``The German-German cooperation in the military sphere must take
place with careful consideration of the security interests of the
states of both alliances,'' Eppelmann said.
   Eppelmann, who says the Warsaw Pact is apparently on the verge
of breaking up, said Monday a German-German exchange of soldiers
during military exercises is not planned.
   The East German defense chief said relations are to include the
``adoption and promotion of contacts between the leaderships,
formations and units as well as institutions'' of both nations'
armed forces.
   ADN, the official East German news agency, said the contacts are
to start on Friday.
   The two sides also agreed on ``intensifying cooperation'' on
security and disarmament questions.
   Stoltenberg emphasized what he referred to as the ``central
importance'' of conventional arms talks now under way in Vienna.
   The Soviets have recently balked at signing an agreement that
would reduce Soviet and American soldiers in central Europe to
195,000 for each side. The agreement would include troops in East
Germany and West Germany.
   The West German defense chief said that a pullout of all 250,000
U.S. troops in his country was ``not sensible because of security
reasons.''
   There are about 380,000 Soviet troops in East Germany.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has vigorously opposed
membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for a united
Germany. He has vowed to review his military strategy if the
reunited country insists on such a step.
   The West German armed forces total about 480,000 personnel.
   East Germany's armed forces, estimated at 135,000, have been
plagued by low morale and desertions.

   No more turtle soup in Mexico as of Monday.
   No more turtle steaks, turtle eggs that locals favor as
aphrodisiacs or turtle shells for combs, computer boards and vanity
cases.
   Turtle skin exports to Japan for shoes, belts and handbags are
over.
   Under pressure from environmental groups, President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari signed an executive order declaring an end to
Mexico's turtle industry, probably the world's largest.
   Until Monday, the country was the world's leading exporter of
turtle products, but environmentalists say sea turtles are being
hunted to extinction here. Mexico is home to 10 of the world's 11
species of sea turtles, and nine of them lay eggs and nest on its
beaches.
   Salinas signed the ban at a ceremony Monday in the capital's
historic Chapultepec Castle in the presence of environmentalists
from the world over, governors whose states are involved with
turtles, and fishing industry leaders.
   ``In signing this decree, we are taking a definite step to help
this species continue its biological developments, ... threatened
with extinction because its natural habitat has been considerably
reduced,'' Salinas said.
   The government will close all turtle slaughterhouses and provide
money to help turtle fishermen and their families diversify.
   Todd Steiner of Earth Island Institute said Salinas had received
more than 70,000 letters in six months protesting lack of
protection for turtles.
   Steiner said environmentalists talked of declaring a tourism
boycott on Mexico and about 10,000 Americans signed a petition
saying they would not visit Mexico unless protective laws were
passed.
   Environmentalists on Monday praised the ban but said the test
will come in enforcing it. They said Mexico also must join the
107-nation Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
of Flora and Fauna, known as CITES.
   Every country in the Western Hemisphere except Mexico has signed
the accord, which bars trade in endangered species. Mexico is
Japan's biggest supplier of turtle skins, and Japan is the world's
biggest importer of turtle products.
   Japan joined CITES, but excluded turtle products.
   Steiner said his organization was happy with Monday's ban that
was aimed at stopping ``what was the largest killing of an
endangered species occurring anywhere in the world.''
   ``But we will be monitoring the situation closely to make sure
these wonderful words are fully implemented,'' he said.
   Michael Weber, vice president of the Center for Marine
Conservation in Washington, said the ban could help the Olive
Ridley turtles, which nest on the Pacific coast, recover from
decades of exploitation.
   Weber said environmentalists are also urging Mexico to require
use of turtle excluder devices in shrimp nets.
   ``They say it's going to end the killing. We hope it's going to
end the killing,'' said Andrew Davis, a spokesman for Greenpeace
International.
   But he said enforcement could be difficult on the isolated,
remote beaches where turtles lay their eggs.
   Most eggs are laid on the Pacific beaches of the states of
Oaxaca, Michoacan, Guererro and Jalisco.
   Last year, the government set a quota of 20,000 turtles but more
than 35,000 were killed at the state-owned turtle slaughterhouse in
Oaxaca state and 40,000 others clandestinely, Earth Island
Institute said.
   The biggest slaughter was of Pacific Olive Ridley turtles, whose
skins were sold to Japan. Hawksbill turtles were killed in the
Caribbean for tortoise shell.
   The Kemp's Ridley, whose population has plunged from 100,000 to
300 in two decades, has its main nesting ground at Rancho Nuevo, in
northeastern Tamaulipas state on the Gulf of Mexico.
   Because so many were killed, much of the meat was wasted,
Elisabeth Robinson Gunther, also of Earth Island, said.
   Protection programs sponsored by ecological organizations and
the government have been rescuing eggs, caring for them until they

   About one-third of the schools in
Lebanon's battered Christian enclave opened on Monday for the first
time in nearly four months in response to a call by the Vatican to
resume classes.
   But two-thirds of the schools remained closed due to 119 days of
brutal clashes between rebel Gen. Michel Aoun's army and militiamen
loyal to Christian warlord Samir Geagea.
   ``The others remained closed either because they had been
wrecked by the shelling, or their buses burned or their staff had
fled the enclave to safer areas,'' said a police spokesman, who
could not be named under standing regulations.
   The Vatican's nuncio in Lebanon, Pablo Puente, called on
Saturday for the opening of schools after both Aoun and Geagea
pledged to him to turn a cease-fire called on May 17 into a
permanent truce.
   At least 1,035 people have been killed and 2,770 wounded since
the power struggle between the rival leaders broke out Jan. 30.
   The inconclusive showdown forced about 400,000 of the enclave's
1 million people to seek refuge in safer areas and left large areas
of the Christian enclave in ruins.

<HEAD>Israeli Parliament Gives Preliminary OK to Electoral Reform Bill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Israel's parliament on Monday took the first
step toward legislating direct election of the nation's prime
minister and other electoral reforms.
   The Knesset approved a preliminary reading of four reform bills
designed to reduce political horsetrading between parties forming
government coalitions, which one legislator called symbolic of
Israel's patchwork democratic process.
   ``I see this day as the first step in healing the system,'' said
Amnon Rubinstein, leader of the liberal Shinui Party, which drafted
one of the bills.
   The proposals will now be brought to the parliament law
committee, where they will be consolidated into one piece of
legislation for the second and third Knesset readings required for
the measure to become law.
   Liberal parties have long sought electoral reforms, without
success. But their cause gained momentum recently when the two
major political forces, the Labor Party and Likud bloc, raised the
public's ire by using political posts and public funds to lure
defectors to cross party lines and to woo religious factions.
   Ultra-Orthodox parties, which currently hold the balance of
power between the two largest political blocs, opposed the reforms
as an infringement of their influence.
   In separate votes Monday, the 120-seat Knesset overwhelmingly
approved bills submitted by the right-wing Likud bloc, the
center-left Labor Party, the right-wing Tzomet and the liberal
Shinui.
   The Labor proposal got the most votes, winning 60-33. It calls
for direct election of the premier, as do the other proposals, and
empowers the prime minister to put together a Cabinet without
parliament approval.
   Under the current system, voters choose from a selection of
national party lists. The head of the party that has the most seats
and is able to form a coalition government has traditionally become
prime minister.
   Uriel Lynn of Likud, the law committee chairman, said he would
put together a joint bill within three months.

   The United States returned part of
Fort Amador to Panamanian forces on Monday after occupying it since
the December invasion that toppled dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Foreign Minister Julio Linares said talks between Panama and the
United States continue on a number of issues stemming from the
invasion, and also said that a plan has been proposed to let U.S.
Coast Guard ships operate in Panamanian waters if a Panamanian
officer is on board.
   Linares said he opposes the idea in principle.
   ``If the idea really is to put down the drug traffic, it needn't
be done at the cost of our jurisdiction or national dignity,''
Linares said.
   Fort Amador, on a strip of land at the Pacific entrance to the
Panama Canal, contained Noriega's main offices and was occupied
jointly by American and Panamanian forces.
   At the transfer ceremony, President Guillermo Endara said the
Panamanian portion of Fort Amador would be converted to a tourist
site. U.S. forces will remain in the other part.
   Endara said that on Thursday the Rio Hato military base 70 miles
southeast of the capital also will revert to Panamanian control.
   The United States took over key military installations during
the invasion and has gradually been returning them.
   Noriega's powerful Panama Defense Forces were disbanded after
the invasion and are being replaced with a regular police force.
   Ambassador Dean Hinton represented the United States at Monday's
ceremony.
   The United States invaded Dec. 20, 1989, to capture Noriega, who
was sought in the United States on drug trafficking charges.
   Noriega took refuge in the Vatican Embassy and surrendered to
American forces Jan. 3. He was flown to Miami where he faces
federal drug charges.
   Linares said Panamanian and U.S. officials are continuing their
talks on U.S.-occupied bases here and on documents captured by
American forces.
   He said the documents are vital to on-going investigations
within Panama. Thousands of boxes of documents were captured,
partly in hopes of tracing the cocaine-running operation to which
Noriega is tied.

<TEXT>
   Officials on Monday began adding up the
results of the first free elections to local councils since World
War II, and Solidarity claimed decisive victories in Warsaw and
elsewhere.
   Candidates from more than 80 parties on Sunday competed in
52,000 races nationwide, a vote that aroused the interest of less
than half the electorate. Official results were to be announced
Wednesday.
   The pro-Solidarity daily Gazeta Wyborcza said preliminary
tallies indicated candidates of the Solidarity Citizens Committee
had won big victories nearly everywhere.
   Unofficial results in Warsaw indicated the Solidarity trade
union movement had won 301 of the 341 council seats, according to
Halina Szymula of the Citizens Committee in the capital.
   But Mateusz Wyrwich, spokesman for the General Election
Commission, said it was too early to predict the outcome because of
the complexity of the coalitions and multitude of parties.
   Former Communists appeared to have won seats in the Mokotow
district of Warsaw, while Peasant parties were expected to land
seats in rural areas.
   The vote tally is complicated by the difficulty of identifying
the political orientation of some parties and groups. Wyrwich said
that in central Bydgoszcz, former Communists campaigned as the
``Democratic Opposition.''
   The elections were to advance democratic reform by establishing
independent local governments. Under four decades of Communist
Party rule, councils were subordinate politically and financially
to central authorities.
   The voter turnout, however, was only 42 percent nationwide,
according to the General Election Commission. In last June's
partially free parliamentary balloting, 62 percent of Poles voted.
   The sweeping victory of Solidarity candidates in the June vote
led to the formation in August of the Solidarity-led government.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa joined political commentators
Monday in attributing the lack of enthusiasm to confusion over the
new political parties, many of which have yet to define their
programs.
   ``Theoreticians will say that people are discouraged. But I
think that in such a short time people cannot get re-oriented to
civic activeness,'' Walesa said Monday.
   ``Fewer people at the polls is the expression of a weaker belief
in the program of democratization and the sense of one's
participating in it,'' read a front-page commentary in the Gazeta
Wyborcza.
   The government daily Rzeczpospolita said participation is
traditionally lower in local elections than in parliamentary or
presidential ballots, but turnout was high in communities where
local problems aroused voter concern.
   The paper also attributed the low turnout to confusion over the
divisions emerging in Solidarity. Walesa has criticized the pace of
reform of the government led by Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki.
   ``The monolothic camp `Solidarity' clearly has split. And the
existing political parties have not managed to persuade voters of
their program and candidates. People don't know exactly whom to
support,'' the commentary said.
   Local governments were previously dependent on Warsaw for funds,
but under a new system they will receive revenue from state
businesses that are to be turned over to councils.
   Parliament is also preparing legislation that would allow local
governments to set taxes.

<HEAD>Glass and Ginsberg Bring Their ``Hydrogen Jukebox'' to Festival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE SMITH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new production joins the words of
Allen Ginsberg and the music of Philip Glass to tell a 30-year
story _ the decline of ``the American empire.''
   ``The Hydrogen Jukebox,'' which premiered over the weekend at
the Spoleto Festival U.S.A., is based on Ginsberg's poems dating to
the 1960s.
   The poet and the composer, along with visual artist Jerome
Sirlin, began putting the show together in 1989. The festival
production features six singers and a six-piece orchestra.
   Glass said he and Ginsberg had discussed collaborating for some
time, but only last year sat down to select poems and compose music.
   ``The Hydrogen Jukebox'' is about the ``decline of the American
empire,'' Ginsberg said in an interview during rehearsals at the
Sottile Theater.
   Each scene is built around a poem; the subjects include the
Vietnam War, ecology and cocaine trafficking.
   ``It's basically an emotional and moral decline,'' Ginsberg said
of the show's theme. ``It's not an angry accusation. It's more of a
meditation on the decline of an empire. The biggest decline of
empire is we won't face our problems.''
   Glass said most of the 21 poems were written some time ago, and
he was faced with the challenge of finding ``a doorway into the
poem.''
   ``You can do things with the music that you can't do in the
poem,'' said Glass, who collaborated on the epic opera ``Einstein
on the Beach'' with Robert Wilson.
   For instance, one scene has a man sitting on a porch and
thinking about the Vietnam War.
   ``He's thinking about the war and he's also thinking about a
train,'' Glass said. ``You never see the train on the stage but
there is this rolling bass line which becomes the feeling of the
train. The music becomes the embodiment of one aspect of the poem.''
   Spoleto is billing the production as the premiere of the opera
version of ``The Hydrogen Jukebox.'' The poems and music were
performed concert-style earlier this year in Philadelphia.
   Glass said ``Jukebox'' also will be performed later this year at
the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy, companion to the
festival here. Glass and Ginsberg have both appeared, separately,
at the Italian festival. This is the first appearance for each at
the festival here.
   The two already were auditioning singers when they were
contacted about bringing the production here.
   ``We were going to do the piece anyway. We were confident we
could get someone to produce it so we went ahead,'' Glass said.
   ``People ask me if I always work on commission and I do. But the
trick is I work on what I want and then I coax somebody into paying
for it.''
   Asked whether ``Jukebox'' might appeal primarily to aging
hippies, Ginsberg said he saw its audience as ``teen-agers as much
as anyone. It's like (the show is) filling in the gaps in history
in the last 30 to 40 years.''
   Glass agreed.
   ``We're in a festival atmosphere now so this is a little bit
different. But, generally speaking, this will be a younger
audience,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The group Earth First! has hired a
private investigator to look into a car bomb explosion in which two
members were injured and later implicated by police, the group's
co-founder said Monday.
   ``The first thing we noticed was that they (police) were looking
only for evidence that would show that Judi and Darryl were guilty
rather than looking for the people who did it,'' said Mike Roselle,
co-founder of the radical environmental group.
   San Francisco Bay area private investigator Sheila O'Donnel
already has begun working with Earth First! lawyer Susan Jordan,
Roselle said.
   Judi Bari, 40, and Darryl Cherney, 33, were booked Friday for
investigation of violation of state explosive laws and each held in
lieu of $100,000 bail. The Alameda County district attorney's
office has until 4 p.m. Tuesday to file charges against Bari and
Cherney.
   A pipe bomb went off in Bari's station wagon as the two were
driving through Oakland on Thursday, injuring both. The activists
reportedly were driving to Santa Cruz to promote a non-violent
campaign to halt logging of old-growth timber.
   Earth First! is a loose-knit group of environmentalists, some of
whom advocate tactics like blockades and tree-spiking to discourage
the harvesting of trees.
   A round-the-clock vigil held by Earth First! supporters outside
Oakland police headquarters ended Monday after officers emerged at
5 a.m. and ordered participants to disperse.
   None of the protesters was arrested, police said. They had vowed
to maintain the vigil until Bari and Cherney were released.
   Friends and sympathizers of the two have insisted since the
blast that Bari and Cherney were victims, not bombers.
   Several Earth First! supporters maintained a vigil for Bari
outside Highland Hospital, where she was in serious condition with
a broken pelvis and other injuries.

<TEXT>
   A judge has renewed hope for Spaniards
awaiting compensation in the 1981 sale of cooking oil that victims'
groups say killed up to 836 people and felled more than 20,000
others.
   Judge Carlos Bueren began proceedings Monday to subpoena 10
former public officials accused of negligence for allowing import
and sale of the rapeseed oil, which was meant for industrial use.
The ruling clears the way for a future trial.
   The oil was imported from France, adulterated and then sold in
working-class neighborhoods as cheap olive oil.
   Bueren ruled Friday the Spanish state was liable for the former
officials' actions at the time and would have to pay any
indemnization resulting from a guilty verdict.
   The case had been shelved by another judge.
   Bueren's decision came a year after a separate verdict convicted
13 people _none of them government officials _ on public health and
fraud charges for importing and selling the oil, but acquitted them
of manslaughter.
   The 1989 verdict fixed indemnization payments, but those
convicted claimed insolvency. Victims' groups complained the
verdict did not guarantee payment.

<HEAD>Witness to Police Slayings Still Waiting for Reward</HEAD>

   It's been eight years since Dwayne Hardin
identified the men later convicted of killing two police officers,
but he's still waiting for the $60,000 reward.
   ``I didn't receive nothing but `Thank you. Adios','' said
Hardin, 34.
   When officers William Fahey and Richard O'Brien were fatally
shot Feb. 9, 1982, the then mayor, Jane Byrne, offered $50,000 for
information leading to the conviction of whoever was responsible.
The Fraternal Order of Police offered $10,000.
   Hardin, who had been driving by the murder scene and stopped to
help the officers, saw two men jump into a car and drive away.
   ``I got out and checked one officer,'' Hardin said. ``He looked
like he was dead. The other was trying to get up. Blood was coming
out of his mouth and eyes. I told him `Lay down, everything's going
to be all right.' ... I reached for the police radio and hollered
for help.''
   Hardin testified against brothers Andrew and Jackie Wilson at a
1983 trial, and they were convicted.
   But the mayor had failed to get any official allocation for the
$50,000 she offered, and Hardin sued, said his lawyer, Hubert
Thompson.
   The Wilsons' convictions were overturned, partly because they
weren't allowed separate trials. And Hardin's lawsuit was dismissed
because the convictions no longer existed.
   The Wilsons were tried again in 1988. Again Hardin testified and
again they were convicted.
   ``He was an excellent witness for us,'' said prosecutor William
Merritt. John Dineen, president of the Fraternal Order of Police,
said $10,000 has been set aside for Hardin and several other
witnesses to share.
   But he said the reward is based upon a final conviction, and the
Wilsons have not exhausted their appeal rights.
   Dineen said that if the convictions are again reversed, the
reward could jeopardize Hardin's testimony.
   ``A smart defense lawyer would ask, `Did you get paid to say my
person committed homicide?''' he said.
   Andrea Brands, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department,
said Byrne's reward offer is under study.
   Byrne lost her re-election bid in the 1983 primary.

   More than 500 Vatican employees held a
silent march Monday night to protest an impasse in negotiations
over higher wages and other labor demands, the employees'
association said.
   The Association of Vatican Lay Employees said in a statement
that the protest was intended to point out the lack of response to
its request for meetings with high-ranking Vatican officials.
   ``This demonstration was aimed especially at obtaining an
audience with the Holy Father,'' said the association's president,
Mariano Cerullo.
   He said the association was sure that if such a meeting could be
arranged, the problems could be worked out.
   The workers complained they had not received sufficient
cost-of-living increases since 1985, that pensions were too low and
that there was no clear procedure through which they could express
demands.
   The 45-minute march went from the workers' cafeteria through
Vatican grounds to the San Damaso courtyard on the northern side of
St. Peter's Square, the association said.
   Cerullo said 1,400 of the approximately 1,900 Vatican lay
employees belonged to the association.
   In February 1988, hundreds of Vatican employees took part in a
labor protest in which they donated part of their salaries to the
pope to call attention to their demands.

<HEAD>Dublin's Gate Theater Presents ``Salome'' At Spoleto Festival
U.S.A</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A brilliant, stylized production of
Oscar Wilde's play ``Salome'' is being presented at the Spoleto
Festival U.S.A. by the Gate Theater of Dublin.
   Everybody except John the Baptist is in white face. Everybody
walks in slow motion. The costumes are black for Herodias, white
for Salome, black and white gowns for Herod's female dinner guests
and tuxedos for men.
   In the fourth of 17 performance Monday at the Dock Street
Theater, John the Baptist sat, wearing torn pants, on a square at
stage center, presumably at the bottom of a cistern. The lighting
was unusual and imaginative. It all worked.
   Alan Stanford entered as Herod and in a few sentences
established his character as a complete hedonist. He was large,
soft looking, effete, and looked like one imagines Wilde to have
looked. His voice was plummy, sounding rich and dissatisfied. From
this beginning, Stanford added to his character as the play
progresses. It was an amazing feat of acting.
   Whether or not Wilde intended to make Herod the central figure
in his story of obsession, Stanford has seen to it that he is.
   Olwen Fouere played Salome, a spoiled teen-ager who spits back
with spite when John the Baptist rejects her advances. Her voice
was young. She's a nymphette, for the first time attracted sexually
to a man who's handsome, strong, authoritative and probably
dangerous. Fouere left it ambiguous as to whether Salome knows what
she's doing.
   It's her obsession to kiss John the Baptist that leads Salome to
dance for Herod and then demand John the Baptist's head. Her dance
is little more than turning slowly in a circle and miming a
striptease.
   Stanford's Herod was superstitious, fearing that if he has John
the Baptist beheaded something bad will happen to him. His
description of the jewels he would give Salome instead of the head
is the most sensuous passage in this production.
   Barbara Brennan played a brittle, husband-nagging Herodias.
Wilde has given her most of his few cynical, clever lines inserted
for dramatic relief. To frequent comments on the meaning of the
moon's aspect, Herodias says dryly, ``The moon is like the moon.''
   Steven Berkoff directed this ``Salome'' for the Gate Theater in
1988. He later directed the play in London, and played Herod.
   Roger Doyle played piano on stage almost continually, sometimes
quite loud when John the Baptist was shouting from his cistern,
sometimes new age music behind speeches, sometimes jazz for dinner
guests to dance to. At one point, the Gate Theater was dancing an
almost-Charleston in Charleston.
   It's interesting, that while the Spoleto Festival worries
whether the avant-garde musical performance art piece ``Pioneer''
may be found objectionable, in 1891 ``Salome'' encountered a
British law prohibiting showing biblical characters on stage. And
Martha Graham's modern dances based on Greek legends were once
considered by some too sensual to be seen.
   Two of those were on Sunday night's Martha Graham Dance Company
program at the Gaillard Auditorium. Now they're clearly seen as
masterpieces. ``Errand into the Maze'' had Christine Dakin battling
Mario Camacho as the Creature of Fear, her fear of her own sexual
nature. Terese Capucilli danced Jocasta and Kenneth Topping as
Oedipus, in ``Night Journey,'' in which Jocasta has flashbacks of
life with a husband who was also her son. All four danced
brilliantly.
   The company also danced the Martha Graham work that is a
favorite with many, ``Appalachian Spring,'' to Aaron Copland music,
plus ``Diversion of Angels,'' to music by Norman Dello Joio.
   Audience members reacted as though they had seen a revelation.
Miss Graham, who turned 96 this month, smiled broadly while taking
a curtain call and attended a party afterwards.
   Spoleto Festival U.S.A. runs through June 10 and features 110
performances ranging from high opera to jazz, ballet and concerts.
Pulitzer prize-winning composer Gian Carlo Menotti founded the
festival in 1977 and modeled it after his Festival of Two Worlds in
Spoleto, Italy.

<HEAD>Court Says Key Evidence in Jesuit Murder Case Burned</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two army officers oversaw the
removal of log books that might have listed those who left the
Military College the night troops allegedly murdered six Jesuits,
the Supreme Court said Monday.
   The court cited a report from the U.S.-funded Special
Investigative Unit, the principal agency investigating the pre-dawn
Nov. 16 massacre of six Jesuit priest-educators, their housekeeper
and her daughter at Central American University.
   A colonel, three lieutenants and five soldiers have been charged
with murder. One of the nine, a private, is a fugitive.
   The court said the log books, which registered entrances and
exits from the school and were considered important evidence, were
removed by order of Maj. Carlos Hernandez, then assistant director
of the Military College.
   Lt. Rene Mendoza headed the detail that removed the books, and
then burned them, the court said.
   President Alfredo Cristiani, in an afternoon news conference,
said the court statement was ``incorrect'' in the part referring to
Hernandez.
   He said Hernandez had ordered the log books be set aside or
otherwise placed at hand so they could be made available to the
court handling the Jesuit case. Even so, the president agreed
Hernandez should be questioned by the judge about the books.
   ``The investigation into what happened to the log books was
undertaken at our (the presidency's) initiative. In no way have we
been trying to cover anything up,'' said Cristiani.
   Mendoza is a defendant. Col. Guillermo Benavides, then-director
of the College and Hernandez' erstwhile boss, is the
highest-ranking officer charged in the slayings.
   Ricardo Zamora, the judge in charge of the Jesuit case, will
question both Hernandez and Mendoza in the coming days, the court
statement said.
   A U.S. congressional task force concluded last month that the
investigation into the Jesuits' slayings was at ``a virtual
standstill.'' The congresssional report cited a lack of
forthrightness on the part of the military as a major reason for
the failure to build a case against those accused in the massacre.
   The armed forces and rightist death-squads have usually been
blamed for the deaths of suspected political opponents in El
Salvador, some of whom are believed to be activist priests.
   On Sunday, however, a leading international rights organization
criticized rebel forces for sentencing scores of people to death in
El Salvador, saying such acts violate the Geneva Convention.
   Americas Watch, in a 38-page document, urged the rebels to
discontinue the death penalty. The report summarizes the cases of
28 people either summarily killed by the left or executed after
guerrilla trials the past two years.
   More than 72,000 people, most of them civilians, have been
killed in 10 years of civil war between the leftist Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front, or FMLN, and a succession of U.S.-backed
governments.
   On Sunday, Jorge Melendez, El Salvador's top rebel leader inside
the country, said the guerrillas want to take part in next year's
elections, but that electoral reforms and civil guarantees must
come first.
   ``If the necessary changes in our society are not legally
enshrined, we cannot lay down our arms,'' Melendez told about 400
rebel troops in the northern guerrilla stronghold of Perquin.
   The five top FMLN commanders have been outside El Salvador for
more than a year on diplomatic and logistical missions. Two took
part this month in five days of U.N.-sponsored peace talks with
government representatives in Caracas, Venezuela.

   Yugoslavia's largest republic of
Serbia strongly protested on Monday the visit of Rep. Tom Lantos,
D-Calif., to its restive province of Kosovo and neighboring
Communist Albania.
   On Sunday, Lantos was warmly welcomed by thousands of members of
Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority, who are fighting for more
autonomy from Serbia.
   With him was former Rep. Joseph Dioguardi, R-N.Y.
   The two men arranged to travel to Tirana, Albania, from
Pristina, Kosovo's capital, on what Lantos termed an official
mission to see if the United States should open diplomatic ties
with Albania.
   A Serbian government statement called the Americans' visit and
reception in Pristina ``a serious blow to relations between
Yugoslavia and the United States'' and asked the federal Yugoslav
government to protest officially to Washington.
   Serbia has drawn world fire over its human rights policies
toward Kosovo's ethnic Albanians.

   Two 19th-century paintings valued at about $400,000
have been stolen from Paris museums, police said Monday.
   They said an evening scene of the town of Delft by Dutch painter
Johan Barthold Jongkind, valued at about $360,000, was stolen
Friday by robbers who entered the Petit-Palais museum during
regular visiting hours and got away without being detected by
guards. The 1868 work was owned by the city of Paris.
   On Saturday, a portrait of Jean-Baptiste Rodin, father of
sculptor Auguste Rodin, was stolen from a hallway in the Rodin
Museum. The work was valued at about $40,000.

   Stormie Jones, the 12-year-old girl who
made medical history as the world's first heart-liver transplant
recipient, returned to her suburban Fort Worth home Monday after
being hospitalized in Pittsburgh.
   Clad in a white Ronald McDonald House sweatshirt and clutching a
small brown teddy bear, she hid behind her mother as a small group
of well-wishers greeted the youngster at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport. She also shied away from television cameras
and reporters.
   After several minutes of prodding by reporters, Stormie snapped:
``I don't want to talk. I want to go home.''
   But she did say she was feeling ``fine.''
   Her mother, Lois ``Suzie'' Purcell, when asked about her
daughter's prognosis, replied: ``It looks good at the moment.''
   Stormie entered the Pittsburgh hospital May 20 after routine
tests showed high liver enzyme levels, an indication of possible
organ rejection.
   Further tests revealed the rejection was moderate and could be
controlled with increased doses of an experimental anti-rejection
medication Stormie has taken since November.
   Ms. Purcell said the trip's back and forth to Children's
Hospital of Pittsburgh have been frustrating and tiring for the
family. She compared the experience to being on a roller-coaster
ride.
   After their brief comments, mother and daughter, surrounded by
well-wishers and family members, scurried off to Stormie's home in
White Settlement, a Fort Worth suburb.
   Stormie, who drew national attention when she became the world's
first heart-liver transplant recipient on Valentine's Day 1984,
will turn 13 on Thursday.
   Stormie received the double transplant to control a congenital
condition that left her cholesterol levels 10 times higher than
normal. She returned to Pittsburgh for a second liver transplant,
performed early this year, after hepatitis damaged the first liver
she received.

   Only 42 percent of eligible voters went
to the polls in this weekend's presidential elections, the lowest
voting rate in decades, official results showed Monday.
   Observers said many Colombians may have been afraid to leave
their homes and vote because of the resurgence of violence across
the country.
   In the two weeks preceding the elections, bombings in Colombia
left 37 people dead and 350 injured. Officials blamed the attacks
on drug traffickers.
   The election's winner, Cesar Gaviria, 43, of the ruling Liberal
Party, has promised to crush drug terrorism when he takes office on
Aug. 7.
   Gaviria, who took up his candidacy when his predecessor Sen.
Carlos Luis Galan was assassinated last Auguest, won the balloting
with 47 percent of the vote, compared to 24 percent for his closest
rival, Alvaro Gomez of the National Salvation Movement.
   In Medellin, a major center of cocaine production, Mayor Juan
Gomez imposed a pre-election curfew.
   ``People are afraid to be in public areas,'' said Camilo
Castellanos, a political expert.
   The elections took place in relative calm in the major cities,
and the only major incidents were a series of armed confrontations
between security forces and leftist guerrillas in the countryside.
   In southern Colombia, leftist guerrillas ambushed two police
vehicles killing at least 10 people and three electoral officials
were reported missing after the incident, police Col. Jaime Pena
told the RCN radio network.
   Pre-election violence forced most candidates to conduct their
campaigns through television and radio because public appearances
were considered too dangerous.

<HEAD>Conservative Republican to Battle Own Party's Cuomo Challenger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC HUMBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A conservative Republican threw a wrench
Monday into his party's plans for challenging Democratic Gov. Mario
Cuomo, by pledging to run on the Conservative Party line.
   ``This is a year to attack both the Republican and the
Democratic parties,'' said Herbert London, a New York University
professor, after meeting with likely GOP gubernatorial nominee
Pierre Rinfret.
   London, 51, said Rinfret, 66, offered him the lieutenant
governor's slot on the GOP ticket, but that he refused.
   Normally, Republicans and Conservatives agree on a ticket. A
split would only make it easier for Cuomo to win an expected bid
for a third four-year term.
   London said he realized his decision would hurt Rinfret's
chances of beating Cuomo.
   ``But I don't think he had a great chance to begin with, let's
be perfectly blunt about it,'' said London, adding it was
``unlikely'' he could beat Cuomo running only on the Conservative
line.
   London said his candidacy was ``a way of putting the Republican
Party on notice ... As long as they're going to use litmus tests
that rule out conservatives, we don't have an alternative.''
   London has maintained that his conservative views, including his
anti-abortion stance, were unacceptable to the state GOP's
leadership and hurt his chances of gaining their support for his
gubernatorial candidacy.
   Rinfret is reported to favor abortion rights, as does Cuomo.
   State GOP Chairman J. Patrick Barrett said London's decision
``certainly makes our job perhaps more difficult.''
   ``But by the same token,'' he added, ``I think we have a superb
candidate in Pierre Rinfret and we will still beat Mario Cuomo. It
was an uphill fight to begin with, so what's the difference?''
   GOP leaders had hoped to end an embarrasingly long search for a
Cuomo challenger with a Rinfret-London ticket in place when the
party's state convention opens Tuesday. They also hoped such a
ticket would bring Conservative Party leaders back into the fold.
   But Conservatives have objected to Rinfret almost from the first
mention of his name as a potential candidate early last week.
   Conservative Party Chairman Michael Long said he expected to
announce London as a formal candidate by Wednesday.
   Rinfret has consistently refused to be interviewed.

   Suspected Sikh militants stormed a road
construction camp in Punjab state on Monday and killed at least 14
Hindu laborers in their tents, police said.
   Police officials in Chandigarh, the state capital, said Gurjant
Singh claimed responsibility for the killings. Singh heads one of
the Sikh militant groups operating in Punjab.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
claim was made in a note left at the site of the killings.
   Also Monday, 11 other people were killed by militants in Punjab,
the United News of India reported. The killings were reported from
various parts of the rich farming state, which has been the scene
of an 8-year-old secessionist campaign by militant Sikhs.
   The killings raise to 931 the number of people killed by
suspected militants in Punjab this year.
   State police chief K.P.S. Gill claimed the assailants in
Chandigarh were based in Pakistan. The international border is 18
miles northwest of the road camp.
   India has repeatedly accused Pakistan of providing bases for
Sikh militant groups, a charge that Islamabad has routinely denied.
   India and Pakistan often accuse the other side of exacerbating
ethnic and religious tensions in the other's territory.
   Sikhs form a slight majority in Punjab, but comprise only 2
percent of India's 880 million people. Militants from the community
have been fighting for an independent nation since 1982, claiming
Sikhs are discriminated against by Hindus, who make up 82 percent
of India's population.

<HEAD>New President Orders Pinochet to Hand Over Secret Police Files</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVA VERGARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Patricio Aylwin summoned former
military ruler Augusto Pinochet to the government palace Monday,
ordered him to hand over secret police records and told him the
army must stay out of politics.
   Pinochet, who remains army commander, was forced to walk a
gantlet of demonstrators shouting ``murderer!'' and other insults
when his armored car was denied entrance at the palace gate.
Visibly furious, he complained about the treatment to a police
guard.
   Inside, he met privately with Aylwin and Defense Minister
Patrico Rojas for an hour. There was no immediate explanation of
why palace guards barred Pinochet's car from entering the gate.
   According to a statement issued later by Aylwin's office, the
president asked Pinochet for details on the dissolving of the
National Information Center, a feared secret police agency that
functioned during the 16{-year military rule.
   ``He also ordered that the files gathered during its (the
center's) legal existence be put at the government's disposition,
to help prevent and combat terrorism,'' the statement said.
   In recent weeks, the local press has reported that former secret
policemen were caught conducting surveillance on officials of the
new government. The center was legally disbanded shortly before
Pinochet handed power over to Aylwin's elected government in March.
   Pinochet later called the meeting with Aylwin ``very pleasant''
and added, ``He said he wants the files and I told him we will
provide all the necessary information.''
   Aylwin also complained about the ``political connotation'' of an
army statement that expressed concern about the creation of a
special commission to investigate human rights abuse that occurred
during Pinochet's rule.
   Aylwin told him the army had no authority to question the
panel's creation, but instead should be trying to cooperate with
it, according to the statement.
   Pinochet replied he didn't mean to question Aylwin's authority,
although he had reservations about the investigation, the
president's statement said. ``He expressed the army's willingness
to cooperate,'' the statement said.
   Pinochet left the meeting by a private underground exit,
avoiding reporters. He told reporters later, however, that the army
statement on the human rights panel was not politically motivated.
   Aylwin took office March 11, ending the authoritarian rule by
Pinochet, who took power in a 1973 coup. The right-wing general's
administration was marked by harsh repression of leftists and
accusations of systematic rights abuse.
   It was the first time Aylwin had summoned Pinochet to a meeting.
The two men met at the palace three weeks ago at the request of
Pinochet, who then complained about the human rights commission.
   A clause in the 1980 constitution, written by Pinochet's
administration, allows him to remain army commander until 1998.

<HEAD>Yugoslavian President Withdraws Threat of State of Emergency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia's president warned Monday
that rising nationalism could escalate into civil war, but he
withdrew an earlier threat to impose a state of emergency in
secessionist-minded regions.
   Borisav Jovic, a hard-line Serbian Communist who took over the
collective presidency earlier this month, had threatened ``urgent
measures'' to maintain national unity after center-right parties
won free elections in the northern republics of Slovenia and
Croatia.
   Despite the withdrawal of that threat in a speech to the federal
parliament, Jovic insisted on strict adherence to the current
Communist federal constitution.
   ``There is a huge escalation of nationalism, and tensions are
increasing in relations between different nationalities and even
republics,'' Jovic said. ``The process of disintegration is
spreading and threatens to get out of control.''
   The new governments in Croatia and Slovenia seek a much looser
federal alliance, and have threatened to secede altogether if their
demands are not met.
   Their deputies angrily refused to vote on Jovic's proposals for
easing the interregional strife that threatens to pull apart
Yugoslavia's fragile federation.
   The deputies argued that they must first clear the proposals
with the new multiparty legislatures in their republics.
   Free elections in Slovenia and Croatia have intensified a
dispute with Serbia, the only one of Yugoslavia's six republics
that so far has refused to schedule multiparty elections or
legalize opposition groups.
   Jovic, sounding a note of moderation, proposed new talks between
the presidency and leaders from all Yugoslavia's regions on a new
constitution.
   ``The Presidency is not considering a state of emergency and is
not planning to annul the elections'' in Slovenia and Croatia,
Jovic said.
   He also proposed a new law making it possible for republics to
secede from Yugoslavia, but warned that ``constitutional order is
seriously jeopardized'' and that Yugoslav laws are flagrantly
violated by some of the 130 largely nationalist parties formed in
recent months.
   ``Not one of them has an all-Yugoslav orientation,'' he
complained.
   The president contended that unspecified right-wing forces aided
by foreign powers _ also not identified _ could bring the country's
ethnic and political tensions to the breaking point.
   Slovenian deputy Janez Lukac bitterly criticized Jovic's
implication that right-wing forces have taken power in his republic
and Croatia.
   ``I would have expected that the president strive for
reconciliation, instead of the continuation of hostilities,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   At least seven people were injured, none
seriously, when a melee that included gunshots erupted Monday among
nearly 10,000 overheated Memorial Day revelers at an outdoor rap
concert, authorities said.
   Houston Fire Chief Robert Clayton said earlier police reports
indicating that two people were shot and two others stabbed in the
Hermann Park disturbance had been wrong. The Fire Department runs
the city's ambulances.
   Clayton said all the injuries, mostly cuts and bruises, came
from ``blunt objects like bottles and bats'' and that none appeared
serious.
   The 4:15 p.m. disturbance erupted as the headliner band, 2 Live
Crew, began its second song.
   Houston City Parks Director Don Olson told radio station KTRH
that an unidentified person threw a bottle into the crowd as the
rap music fans surged toward the stage.
   Then, Olson said, someone in the crowd fired a gun, apparently
angered at the people closing in around them.
   Witnesses said several people had begun spraying each other with
beer in the hot afternoon sun. Temperatures here reached 93 degrees
for the second day running.
   ``Some people apparently started throwing beer bottles and then
I heard, pop, pop, pop _ someone was shooting _ and then everybody
started running,'' said Ron Atkins of KMJQ, a radio station
sponsoring the concert at the Miller Outdoor Theater.
   ``I heard about four gunshots and just started running,'' said
George Carver, another witness.
   The concert was cancelled once the melee began. Police closed
the park, sending hundreds running for parking lots and creating a
traffic jam that lasted more than an hour.
   Scores of officers on foot and horseback and in helicopters
worked to evacuate the area.
   KTRH radio said 20 people were arrested, most of them for public
intoxication, but a police dispatcher, Berschelle Moore, could
confirm just 10 arrests. The radio station also reported two
arrests on weapons complaints.
   Ambulances treated some people for heat exhaustion, but officers
said there were no serious injuries.

   A band of men with M-16 rifles tried
to force their way to the home of Trade and Industry Secretary Jose
Concepcion but were turned back by guards, Concepcion's office said
Tuesday.
   His staff said in a statement that more than four gunmen arrived
about 11:15 p.m. Sunday at the gate of the posh Forbes Park
residential district and demanded to get to the secretary's house,
but guards refused to admit them.
   The group's leader then ordered his men to leave because they
had been ``burned out,'' the statement said. The term is slang used
by the Philippine military for a covert operation that has been
exposed.
   Guard reinforcements were sent to Forbes Park, a wealthy
subdivision that includes the homes of leading businessmen,
government officials and U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt.
   Newspapers speculated the incident may have been a kidnap or
assassination attempt and said the gunmen could have been rebel
soldiers responsible for last December's coup attempt.
   Concepcion, a leading industrialist, is a controversial figure
because of allegations he secured preferential government loans for
his family business and favors foreign investors, especially
Taiwanese. He denies wrongdoing.
   Last week, a statement issued by the mutineers threatened to
kill banker Domingo Lee for ``crimes against the people.''
   Lee owns PhilBanking Corp., one of two banks where bombs were
discovered last week.
   Security has been intensified in Manila following bombings and
ambushes, blamed on Communist rebels.
   Maj. Gen. Cesar Nazareno, the national police chief, warned
Saturday that Manila was experiencing a ``breakdown in law and
order.'' The State Department has warned Americans to be alert for
terrorism and rising crime here.
   Also Monday, the military said troops captured 27 Communist
leaders and guerrillas in raids north of Manila and in the southern
Philippines.
   A military report said nine purported members of the outlawed
National Democratic Front's Mindanao Commission were arrested
Saturday at a house in Davao City, 530 miles southeast of the
capital. It said among those seized was a member of the
commission's secretariat, Maria Loreto Abella, for whom a $4,300
bounty had been offered.

   Etched in granite, ``Kid Of Courage'' tops
Ryan White's gravestone.
   The epitaph, composed by his mother, are three of the more
modest words that adorn the monument to the Indiana youth, who
spent the last five years educating the public about AIDS.
   The words of Gov. Evan Bayh, singers Elton John and Michael
Jackson join those of the White family on the headstone that was
placed Monday at Ryan's gravesite, nearly two months after his
death of complications from acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   No stone covered the grave before Monday, only flowers and notes
from thousands of well-wishers and wax from a candle that was lit
twice each day.
   His mother, Jeanne White, spent the time designing the monument
that was dedicated on Memorial Day, when U.S. servicemen are
honored for losing their lives in wars. Ryan was remembered at the
dedication by friends and family as having fought an equally
arduous battle.
   ``I think about him everyday _ several, several times,'' his
uncle, Tom Hale, said before about 75 people who attended the
dedication. ``Don't weep for me, meet me. That would be his
prayer.''
   White, who contracted AIDS through blood products he was taking
for his hemophilia, was less than 5 feet tall, but his gravestone _
in black and white, his favorite colors _ stands 6 foot, 8 inches,
his mother said.
   ``He liked to say he was five foot. He always wanted to be tall.
He wanted to be big and be like Howie Long,'' Jeanne White said of
the defensive lineman for the Los Angeles Raiders.
   Inscriptions on front and back of the gravestone tell the story
of his 18 years. After a lengthy legal dispute between 1985 and
1987, Ryan won the right to attend school outside of Kokomo, but
ugly stares and ill feelings drove him, his sister and mother to
Cicero, 30 miles north of Indianapolis.
   In the interim, he endeared thousands as a proponent for AIDS
education, including singers John and Jackson. Words from songs
performed by both entertainers, who remain close to the Whites, are
inscribed on the monument.
   ``Turn me loose from your hands. Let me fly to distant lands.
Fly away skyline pigeon fly, from all the things you left so far
behind,'' are words on the stone from ``Skyline Pigeon'' that John
sang at Ryan's funeral in Indianapolis.
   ``Gonna make a difference, gonna make it right,'' are attributed
to Jackson on the stone.
   And from family and friends: ``We're sure going to miss you
Ryan.''
   Neighbors and friends offered testimonials about encounters with
White during the dedication, and the choir director of Hamilton
Heights High School, which Ryan attended, sang ``The Lord's
Prayer.''

   A downpour dampened Memorial Day barbecues and beach parties on
the West Coast, but sunny skies surprised sunbathers in the East as
the nation started its summer fun and commemorated its casualties
of war.
   Fallen veterans were honored nationwide on Monday, and in
Maryland a statue remembering U.S. military victims of terrorism
was unveiled.
   In Panmunjom, Korea, the bodies of five U.S. servicemen killed
nearly 40 years ago were returned _ the first return of U.S. Korean
War dead from the North since 1954. More than 8,000 Americans from
the 1950-53 conflict remain unaccounted for.
   In the South China Sea off Okinawa, Martin Rosenfeld, who lives
in a Chicago suburb, lowered a 1,500-pound stone marker at the spot
where, 45 years ago to the day, it's believed 159 sailors,
including his brother, Robert, drowned when the Japanese sank the
USS Drexler destroyer.
   And in Cicero, Ind., a monument was unveiled to Ryan White, who
fought against AIDS discrimination but lost the fight for his own
life two months ago at age 18.
   The less somber side of the holiday that heralds the unofficial
start of the summer season was celebrated with parades and family
get-togethers.
   President Bush reviewed a colorful parade of fire engines,
school bands and a veterans' brigade in Kennebunkport, Maine.
Veterans fired a 24-gun salute and buglers from Kennebunk High
School played ``Taps.''
   Bush, basking in sunshine and surrounded by his wife, children
and grandchildren, called the Memorial Day festivities a ``little
piece of Americana.''
   At Arlington National Cemetery, Vice President Dan Quayle
participated in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the
Unknowns.
   Gloomy weather forecasts in the Northeast evaporated Sunday,
sending hordes to the beach. Sunny skies prevailed Monday as well,
but ocean temperatures in the mid-50s confined most beach
frolicking to the shore.
   The temperature in New York City reached 72 degrees Monday and
the fine weather attracted 102,620 people to seven city-run
beaches, including about 60,000 who visited Coney Island.
   The Pacific storm that dumped an inch of rain on Los Angeles by
Monday morning forced a downtown highway closure and was blamed for
two roadway deaths.
   The rain also sent costumed minstrels and jugglers packing when
officials closed the outdoor Renaissance Pleasure Faire in San
Bernardino.
   In Timonium, Md., the families of 11 Maryland veterans killed by
terrorism joined a crowd of 200 at the dedication of the Children
of Liberty Memorial.
   ``They are victims of an undeclared war,'' said Maryland
National Guard Maj. Gen. James F. Fretterd.
   Mary Ervin's son, Ulysses G. Parker, was killed in the Oct. 23,
1983, bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut.
   ``It seemed like such a waste for them to have been where they
were and not able to protect themselves. It was just plain
murder,'' she said.
   The memorial features a 12-foot bronze and granite statue of a
woman's hands holding a folded American flag to her chest.
   It is inscribed with the names of nine Maryland residents who
died in the Beirut attack, one killed during the 1985 hijacking of
TWA Flight 847 in Beirut and one who died in the 1988 bombing of
Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
   ``It is important that we recognize them and give them the same
kind of salute as those who have fought in wars,'' said retired
Col. Timothy Geraghty, the commanding officer at the time of the
barrack bombing.
   In Illinois, ceremonies honored war dead while mourners in
Breese planned a service Tuesday for five high school girls who
added to the holiday weekend roadway death toll.
   The girls, all sophomores at Breese Central High School, were
killed along with a 47-year-old woman in a two-vehicle crash
Saturday.
   ``It wasn't a big class, maybe 100 kids, and five percent of
them have just been killed,'' said Breese Central health teacher
Dick Garrett.
   In Davie, Fla., a 7-year-old girl on horseback, about to join in
a Memorial Day parade, was fatally crushed when her horse fell,
police spokeswoman Leslie Richart said.
   In Houston, where temperatures hit 93 degrees, at least seven
people were injured, none seriously, when a melee that included
gunshots erupted among nearly 10,000 people at an outdoor rap
concert, authorities said. No one was shot; the injuries were
mostly cuts and bruises, said Fire Chief Robert Clayton.
   In Philadelphia, actors portraying historical U.S. soldiers
joined real veterans in a military review at Fort Mifflin, where
troops held off the British fleet in 1777.
   After an overnight downpour in San Francisco, a parade wound
through the Presidio Army Base, where a military tribute complete
with a 21-gun salute and a flag-raising ceremony was staged.
   In Arkansas, tourists undeterred by recent devastating floods
packed hotels and campsites.
   ``We had a lot of cancellations, but we had a lot of people who
came in to take those folks' place,'' said Bonnie Hunter, a desk
clerk at DeGray State Park Lodge.
   All 96 rooms at the lake near the resort town of Hot Springs
were full Sunday, she said. Hot Springs was hard-hit by flooding
and officials had feared a tourism blight.

<HEAD>Bush Holds the Initiative in Superpower Summit</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Another spring, another summit. The similarity
ends there.
   One year ago today, President Bush was in Brussels at a NATO
summit, unveiling his proposal for troop and conventional weapons
in Europe and ending a long silence.
   He had ordered a review of U.S. foreign policy and put things on
hold while it was done. That left the stage to Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   And Gorbachev certainly had used it, waging a peace offensive
and playing to crowds that cheered his visits to Western capitals.
   Now, as the U.S.-Soviet summit begins on Thursday, Bush holds
the initiative and Gorbachev is a leader with dire problems. The
summit could help him at home.
   A year ago, the NATO summit was a boost for Bush after months of
criticism of his style, pace and a lack of proposals while
Gorbachev was waging his peace offensive.
   The Soviet leader had announced conventional arms reductions,
then proposed negotiations for troop and weapons cuts on both
sides, and later said he would scrap 500 short-range nuclear
weapons.
   It was the season of Gorbymania in Western Europe, and Bush had
offered little to counter it. Critics said he was timid. Even when
he was ready to outline his world view, the plans Bush described
were short on drama, nothing to rival the Gorbachev show.
   He proposed an ``open skies'' system of arms control
verification _ reviving an idea that dates from Dwight D.
Eisenhower. He challenged Gorbachev to ``open the ledgers'' on
Soviet defense budgets, hardly a slogan to rally the Western
alliance.
   But that buttoned-down phase ended in Brussels. Bush called for
cuts to 275,000 in U.S. and Soviet troop levels in Europe, with
ceilings on tanks, artillery and combat aircraft too. He wanted it
done about five years faster than Gorbachev had proposed.
   Bush also succeeded in shelving Western differences over
modernizing short-range nuclear missiles, a major issue then, now
overtaken by the collapse of the Iron Curtain.
   Parts of the 1989 agenda have been outdated by the remodeling of
Europe _ the fall of communist governments and the coming
reunification of Germany _ but the administration still is pressing
for East-West cuts in troops and conventional weapons in Europe, to
levels that would secure the new look on the continent. For all
that has happened, Western forces still are outgunned and far
outnumbered by the Soviet troops that remain in Eastern Europe.
   Bush said in Brussels that he wanted an East-West treaty within
a year, to be implemented by 1992 or 1993. The timetable already
has slipped; the administration still hopes for a deal before the
end of 1990, and Bush said the process is not going as far or as
fast as he would like.
   Bush said he is looking for a way to move those negotiations
forward. ``It's important, and I think it does send a bad signal if
the Soviets look like they're refusing to go forward,'' he said
Thursday.
   The stall in conventional arms talks is one of the topics Bush
will raise with Gorbachev at their weekend meetings in Washington
and at Camp David, Md. That, and strategic weapons reductions, and
the Soviet economic situation, and the crisis over breakaway
Lithuania.
   ``I feel that the man has got some enormous problems; he's made
some enormous progress,'' Bush said at a pre-summit news
conference. ``I think he knows ... that we're not trying to
undermine him or make life complicated for him.''
   To the contrary, the administration has a stake in Gorbachev's
success. ``It is important for perestroika to succeed, because we
think that perestroika ... will bring us a more open and stable and
secure Soviet Union, and that's very much in the best interests of
the United States,'' said Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
``I can't tell you whether or not the summit will ... strengthen
him domestically in the Soviet Union.''
   That year-ago summit certainly strengthened Bush. ``Here we go
now, on the offense,'' he said at the time. That's the position he
is trying to hold as he heads into the meetings with Gorbachev and
with allied leaders a month later.

<HEAD>Keller Industries Founder Dies at 70</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Henry Keller, who helped pioneer the
use of prefabricated aluminium products in the home-building
industry, died Sunday at his home after a lengthy heart illness. He
was 70.
   Keller was born in Gadsden, Ala., on Feb. 16, 1920, and moved to
Miami at age 18. He served in the Navy in World War II and
afterward worked for two aluminum manufacturing companies in Miami.
   In 1950, in the midst of South Florida's post-war housing boom,
he founded Air Control Products, which was renamed Keller
Industries in 1968.
   By the time he retired in 1983, 4,000 workers at manufacturing
plants and warehouses across the country were producing a wide
range of home-building products, from window frames to step-ladders.
   ``Everything was on a first-name basis,'' said Robert Conners, a
20-year employee. ``He had an open-door policy. Anyone could come
see him.''
   He added that Keller was ``a tough, hard-driven businessman''
who disdained neckties except for rare occasions, such as board
meetings. He also donated more than $1 million to Mount Sinai
Medical Center on Miami Beach.

<HEAD>Gas Prices Climb, Currency Devaluation Slows Under New Wage, Price
Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TALLI NAUMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gasoline prices climbed but currency
devaluation slowed Monday after President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
signed the latest in a series of wage-price control pacts.
   Salinas signed a new Economic Growth and Stability Pact with
business, labor and farm leaders of his Institutional Revolutionary
Party at a ceremony in the presidential residence Sunday night.
   ``This is a renewed effort to fight inflation and consolidate
the conditions of growth that Mexicans demand and deserve,''
Salinas said.
   Signers of the new pact agreed not to demand wage or price hikes
between now and Jan. 31, 1991, when the accord expires.
   They also agreed to let the government raise the cost of
gasoline and continue devaluing currency, but at a slower rate than
before.
   Gasoline prices were hiked an average 6.7 percent Monday, in
accord with a Treasury Department announcement that followed the
signing of the pact.
   The pact stipulated that Mexican money would be devalued against
the dollar at a rate of four pesos every five days, beginning
Monday. The value of currency had been dropping at the rate of one
peso a day before.
   The current rate is 2,800 pesos to the dollar.
   ``The business sector . . . promises to absorb these increases
and not pass them on in costs for goods and services,'' the pact
stipulates.
   An opposition party spokesman criticized the pact because it was
formulated behind closed doors.
   ``One can make an argument for the prices (of gasoline) going
up, but it's not at all clear why wages aren't going up. It seems
to be repeating the situation of having Mexican society paying the
bill for a very unclear strategy,'' Democratic Revolutionary Party
spokesman Ricardo Pascoe said in an interview.
   The ruling party majority in the lower house of Mexico's
congress defeated a proposal by opposition parties on Friday to
reveal details of the pact before signing it.
   The Mexican economy has been governed by similar wage-price
control pacts since 1987. The annual inflation rate has dropped
from 160 percent to 20 percent during that time.
   ``The pact has had success because the parties to it have
complied and have had enough flexibility to resolve their
differences,'' Salinas said.
   The renewed pact replaces a wage-price control accord signed
Dec. 3 that expires on July 31.
   Following the signing ceremony, the government oil monopoly
Petroleos Mexicanos, known as Pemex, announced a jump of 35 pesos
in regular and unleaded gas to 560 pesos a liter in most of the
country, or about 20 cents a liter.
   Pemex said it would raise the cost of regular gasoline by 65
pesos in the three largest cities _ Mexico City, Guadalajara and
Monterrey _ and along the U.S. border.
   The higher price in those areas is designed to earn revenues
that will be used to improve the quality of gas, provide cleaner
public transportation and fight smog, Pemex said in a news release.

<HEAD>Italian and US Carriers Sign Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alitalia and USAir on Monday signed an agreement
aimed at giving their passengers easier access to each other's
networks.
   Under the terms of the accord signed in Rome, passengers of
Italy's national flag carrier will be able to fly to 41 U.S.
destinations by making connections with USAir flights leaving from
Boston, Miami and Los Angeles.
   In turn, USAir passengers destined for eastern Europe or the
eastern Mediterranean can fly Alitalia to Italy and make the
appropriate connections in Rome or Milan.
   The accord will go into effect on June 16.
   Giovanni Bisignani, managing director of Alitalia, and Randall
Malin, vice chairman and executive vice president of USAir, told a
news conference that the agreement doesn't call for an exchange of
shareholdings, but they would not rule out an equity swap in the
future.
   Alitalia hopes the expanded access to the U.S. destinations,
including such commercial and tourist centers as Washington,
Philadelphia, Detroit and San Francisco, will help it raise its
market share of traffic between the U.S. and Italy.
   In 1989, Alitalia had 47 percent of that market with 700,000
passengers. Pan American World Airways and Trans World Airlines
share the balance.
   The accord follows an agreement signed in April between the
Italian and U.S. governments that calls for expanded airline
service between the two countries. Under that accord, Alitalia will
be allowed to service five U.S. gateway cities and intensify its
flight schedule, while two more U.S. carriers will be allowed to
fly into Italy.
   The accord also calls for close cooperation in cargo divisions,
and will allow USAir passengers to receive frequent flyer bonus
points for transatlantic Alitalia flights.
   USAir's only trans-Atlantic routes are to London and, beginning
later this month, to Frankfurt, West Germany.

<HEAD>Mood In Sweden Gradually Shifting In Favor Of EC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The independent-minded Swedes are
softening their opposition to joining the European Community, but
the question of political union remains a stumbling block,
politicians and analysts said.
   Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson, in an article published Sunday,
said neutral Sweden must remain outside the EC's ranks if the
trading bloc forms a political union.
   Carlsson said control over foreign policy was the only major
question barring Sweden from EC membership. Even the dissolution of
the European power blocs, NATO and the Warsaw Pact, would not
persuade Sweden to relinquish its neutrality, he wrote in the
Dagens Nyheter daily.
   Sweden has relaxed many of the restrictions of its tightly
controlled economy in the last two years to adapt to European
conditions. Major Swedish companies also have merged or signed
cooperation deals with European companies to protect themselves
when the EC dismantles its internal commercial barriers in 1992.
   Sweden belongs to the six-nation European Free Trade
Association, which is negotiating for commercial links with the
12-nation EC. The package would unite the two into an 18-member
European Economic Space accord.
   But Swedish businessmen and the political opposition complain
that the idea would bind the EFTA countries to the EC as a junior
partner with no decision-making voice.
   An opinion poll conducted by the respected SIFO organization
showed 51 percent of those asked were in favor of seeking EC
membership, compared with 48 percent a year ago.
   The poll had a three percent margin of error, meaning that the
change was insignificant. But the number of respondents who opposed
asking for EC membership fell to 21 from 25 percent, perhaps
indicating a trend, said SIFO analyst Alf Sjostrom. The rest were
undecided.
   ``We have seen from other polls which we have done that opinion
in Sweden is more positive to the EC,'' said Sjostrom.
   But the polls also showed that most Swedes don't know how EC
membership would affect them, he said.
   Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, speaking in a
Stockholm news conference, said Sweden should not consider
neutrality an obstacle to seeking EC membership. Denmark, once an
EFTA member, is the only Scandinavian country in the EC.
   ``I see a common foreign policy where there is consensus,''
Ellemann-Jensen said. ``We can work to improve the preconditions
for reaching consensus.''
   He cautioned that Sweden could not influence EC policy unless it
were a full member of the trading bloc.
   ``We do not want non-members to take part in the decision-making
process. It is unthinkable to have far-reaching agreemens that
undermine the (EC) integrity and process of decisions,'' he said.
   Swedish opposition leader Carl Bildt, of the Moderate party,
also said the policy of neutrality should not be allowed to exclude
Sweden from the EC.
   ``It is impossible to conduct our neutrality policy as if the
Cold War still existed,'' Bildt said. ``It is obvious that we would
participate in the cooperation among Europe's democracies.''

<HEAD>Varity Corp. Eyes Move To U.S., But Canadians Opposed</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: All dollar figures are U.S.</NOTE>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canada's Varity Corp., a major farm
equipment makers, wants to move headquarters across the border to
attract U.S. investors, but a Canadian official said Monday his
government would sue to block a move.
   Varity is considering moving its headquarters from Toronto to
Buffalo to make its stock more attractive to U.S. investors, said a
company spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The
Canadian government imposes a 15 percent withholding tax on
dividends, the spokesman said.
   A move ``would make the company's stock available to a number of
U.S. institutions who may now be precluded from buying foreign
stocks or may have their fill of foreign stocks,'' the spokesman
said.
   But the move would violate a pledge Varity, then known as
Massey-Ferguson, made in 1986 in return for a $169.1 million
government bailout, said an official of the Ontario Development
Corp., a quasi-public agency that funnels government loans to
businesses.
   Varity agreed to maintain or create 1,500 jobs in Canada by
1993, and the agreement ``requires them to keep a headquarters
here,'' the official said in a telephone interview from Toronto. He
said his agency's rules forbid its employees to be named for
attribution.
   The agreement calls for a fine of $25,365 for each job Varity
fails to provide, but includes no specific penalties for failing to
keep its headquarters in Canada, the official said.
   Tobias Levkovich, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co. in New York, said a move would give Varity the visibility that
its $2.3 billion in annual sales merits.
   ``This company would be in the Fortune 150 if it would be
American-based,'' Levkovich said. ``Now, it's nothing.''
   A move also would allow Varity to boost its stock price by means
of a reverse split, something that is forbidden by the Toronto
Stock Exchange, Levkovich said.
   Varity recently purchased a mansion in Buffalo and won an $11.5
million package of tax exemptions from the Erie County Industrial
Development Agency. Those actions prompted public warnings from
Canadian officials that Varity would face a court fight if it moved
its headquarters.
   The Ontario official said those warnings still stood, but he and
the Varity spokesman said negotiations were under way to find a way
around the problem.
   Neither side would say what concessions Varity might make in
return for the government's acquiescence on the move. They said the
negotiations might take the better part of a year to complete.
   Paul Leone, business development officer for the Erie County
Industrial Development Agency, said Varity has ``about a year'' to
take advantage of the agency's incentive package, but that there is
no specific deadline.
   The company has estimated it would employ 45 people in Buffalo
within two years if the headquarters are moved. The Canadian
government already has claimed Varity is 450 jobs short of its
commitment and has threatened the company with fines, but Varity
says it met the commitment by including employees of its U.S.
subsidiaries who work in Canada.

Speech</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   People from outside the city were barred from
shopping in Moscow's stores today in an effort to stop a wave of
panic buying caused by government plans to triple bread prices on
July 1.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev tried to stem the run on stores
by making a hastily scheduled appearance on Soviet television
Sunday night.
   ``Don't panic, comrades!'' he told his television audience. The
speech was rebroadcast at midday today.
   The mood seemed calmer during the morning at grocery stores on
Taganskaya and Dorogmilovskaya Streets, but the rush resumed
elsewhere after lunch.
   When food store No. 30 on Gorky Street reopened after the midday
break, about 70 people rushed in to buy Vietnamese vodka and
Nicaraguan rum, nearly overwhelming policemen who were helping
check for residency permits.
   One shopper at Tanganskaya, where liquor was not being sold,
said the panic seemed to be subsiding.
   Another woman said Gorbachev's speech had a calming effect,
``but he really had nothing concrete to offer.''
   The woman, who was traveling with her husband and grandson said
she told store clerks ``we were on a trip and needed to get
something to eat. Of course they let us in.''
   She declined to give her name or native city.
   A store clerk who initially refused entrance to the travelers
said, ``How can you turn away a child? A person must eat.''
   A small percentage of those trying to enter the store were
turned away. Some of those rejected said they simply forgot to
carry the residence permits required to live in the city.
   In his speech, Gorbachev said that ``an anxious mood has arisen
in the country in connection with the consideration by the Supreme
Soviet (Parliament) of the government's report on the transition to
a market economy.''
   Besides touching off panic buying, the reform plan also has
drawn criticism from such radicals as Boris N. Yeltsin, who
advocate a much more rapid transition to a market economy.
   Yeltsin, opposed by Gorbachev, was nominated in the third round
of voting today for president of the Russian federation, the
largest of the 15 Soviet republics. He failed to gain a majority in
the first two rounds of balloting in the Russian Congress last week.
   Yeltsin faces the Russian premier, Alexander Vlasov, plus Ivan
Polozkov, the Krasnodar party chief, and five lesser known figures.
   Gorbachev, in his speech, gave assurances that as part of the
reform plans, lower income people would be compensated and that
those thrown out of work would be retrained for new jobs.
   Some economists have estimated that up to 40 million people
could lose their jobs in the reforms, which are expected to drive
many inefficient businesses into bankruptcy.
   But he said that ``this transition to a market economy ...
cannot be postponed, because negative consequences will develop.
   Ryzhkov, presenting the plan Thursday, said price hikes would
earn the government an additional $320 billion, but that $217
billion would be paid out to compensate the needy.
   Gorbachev did not mention the possibility of a referendum, as
discussed by Ryzhkov's deputies Yuri Maslyukov and Leonid Abalkin
on Wednesday.
   Ryzhkov's plan calls for bread prices to triple to $1.09 a loaf
on July 1, and for other food prices to double on average starting
Jan 1. The average Soviet monthy salary is $279. Ryzhkov said
Thursday that bread makes up 20 percent of the average Soviet diet.
   The three-phase reform plan, to carry through 1995, calls for
about 60 percent of state enterprises to be sold to the public
sector and for controls to be lifted on about 60 percent of prices.
   Other prices would remain under state control, and many
industries would stay in state hands, over the opposition of
radical reformers.
   Gorbachev said the increase in bread prices was needed ``because
the cheapness of bread does not at all correspond to the the amount
of labor in its production ... People buy bread and feed it to
their animals. And this at a time when we are forced to buy grain
abroad.''
   Gorbachev, without mentioning names, criticized those who were
skeptical of the government reform program.
   ``They can inflict irreparable damage. We must put those
hecklers in their places. They are guided only by their ambitions
and not the interests of the people,'' Gorbachev said.

   The proposal by the EC Commission, which must be approved by the
community's 12 member nations, would drop protection of chip
designs from non-EC countries that do not legally protect designs
made within the EC.
   Unlike other non-EC countries such as Austria, Japan and Sweden,
which recognize and protect designs of chips made in the community,
the United States protects only its own chip designs.
   ``If they won't respect our designs, we won't respect theirs,''
an EC Commission official who asked not to be named, said.
   ``What we are looking for is for other countries to recognize
chips made in the EC and to give them legal protection,'' added the
official.
   Currently, the EC protects a third country's chip designs even
if that country does not protect EC semiconductor designs.
   Those interim measures will expire on Nov. 7. The Commission on
Monday approved proposals suggesting reciprocal protection be
extended indefinitely to Austria, Sweden and Japan.
   But the Commission also proposed that chips designed in other
countries, including the United States and Switzerland, be given
protection only until the end of 1992, unless those countries take
action to protect EC designs.

<HEAD>EFTA to Open Trade With East Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>

   The six-nation European Free Trade
Association is preparing a declaration of cooperation with Hungary
and Poland, Swedish Trade Minister Anita Gradin said Monday.
   Mrs. Gradin said the declaration will be presented at an EFTA
summit meeting in Goteborg on June 14, and will clear the way to
broad trade agreements with eastern Europe.
   By approving such agreements, ``we can support the
democratization process and help stabilize economies'' in countries
emerging from decades of central planning under communist
governments, she said.
   Gradin said East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria also have
shown interest in cooperating with EFTA.
   In 1984 EFTA issued a declaration of cooperation with
Yugoslavia, and last April EFTA approved a $100 million investment
fund for Yugoslavia at favorable terms.
   The trade bloc is comprised of Sweden, Switzerland, Finland,
Iceland, Norway and Austria.
   Mrs. Gradin said ties with eastern European countries could
strengthen EFTA's position in cooperation talks with Europe's
dominant trade organization, the European Community.
   Some observers have said EFTA may die out after the EC's
12-member states form a single market in 1992. Austria has applied
to join the EC, and public opinion is swinging towards EC
membership in other EFTA countries.
   But Gradin said ``who knows what will happen in the future. EFTA
is a useful organization today.''

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed in Thin Trading</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES with closing rates.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The dollar finished mixed in exceptionally quiet
European trading Monday, affected by the Memorial Day holiday in
the United States and a bank holiday in Britain.
   Gold rose in Zurich but was not traded in London or Hong Kong,
which also was closed for a holiday.
   In Frankfurt, the market continued to watch events in the Soviet
Union and the progress toward German reunification with great
interest, but in the absence of news there was little inspiration
for trading.
   ``One can't even call it technical trading,'' said a trader at a
U.S. bank in Frankfurt.
   ``With New York and London absent, nobody in the forex market is
going to take big risks,'' said another trader at a West German
bank.
   A trader in Milan agreed. ``The dollar is looking fairly stable,
with a tendency to firm. But I don't expect much movement due to
the holidays in London and New York. The market is pretty dead.''
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell below 150 yen for the first time in
nearly three months, falling 0.60 yen to a closing of 149.45 yen.
Later, in Europe, it was quoted lower at 149.39 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday:
   _1.6790 West German marks, down from 1.6810
   _1.4215 Swiss francs, down from 1.4245
   _5.6565 French francs, down from 5.6585
   _1.8910 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8820
   _1,233.50 Italian lire, down from 1,234.15
   _1.1828 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1837
   The British pound was quoted at $1.6930 in Europe, more
expensive for buyers than late Friday's $1.6895 in London.
   In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of $367.50, up 50 cents
from late Friday.
   Markets were closed in Hong Kong because of the Dragon Boat
Festival.
