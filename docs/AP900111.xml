   An Associated Press obituary of Denver architect
and developer Temple Hoyne Buell, who died last Friday at age 94,
did not give full background on the $25 million donation he made to
Colorado Women's College during the 1960s.
   Buell was persuaded by his second wife, Virginia Bennett
Crocker, to donate a $25 million trust to Colorado Women's College,
which then was renamed Temple Buell College.
   But the school's other donors, apparently unaware that Buell's
contribution was to be posthumous, began diverting their
contributions elsewhere. This prompted the school's trustees to
break off the arrangement with Buell and change the school's name
back to Colorado Women's College.
   The east Denver college later was dissolved because of financial
problems, and the campus now is owned by the University of Denver.

   On the road hardly means roughing it as
truckers haul their own chandeliers, fax machines and microwave
ovens along with products going to market across country.
   ``You can just about put anything you want in there,'' said
Steve Bombela of United Truck and Body in Des Moines, which makes
cabs and does customizing for semi-trucks.
   The longer cabs contain a sleeping unit behind the front seat
that can be furnished with just about anything a trucker can dream
up.
   Steve Blunt, 37, president of Steve Blunt Trucking Inc. of Des
Moines, owns ``The Bird,'' a 70-foot long customized Kenworth
Aerodyne. He spent $70,000 getting the truck just the way he wanted
it.
   It is painted with two, 17-foot, air-brushed blue firebirds from
the hood to the tip of the trailer. The sleeper has a bath with
shower, foldaway tables, a central vacuuming system and a kitchen
with sink, two-burner stove, microwave and customized cabinets.
There are refrigerators in both the cab and the sleeper.
   The sleeping compartment for two has a 15-inch remote control
color television, a VCR and a cellular telephone.
   A stereo system with 28 speakers provides cruising music.
   ``You've got to have some tunes,'' said Blunt, whose drivers
transport boxed beef to New York City and Boston.
   He likes the shower best.
   More husband and wife teams are buying the big cabs since
deregulation eased restrictions on truck length, according to
Kenworth Mid-Iowa in Des Moines. About 10 percent of the company's
business is in the big Kenworth Aerodyne.
   The cab and sleeper costs $90,000 to $100,000, without extras,
and is about the fanciest cab sold. It also is the largest,
measuring 110 inches by 96 inches. It comes with a button and tuck
padded interior and upper and lower bunks and a full-sized 42-inch
bed.
   Bombela said his deluxe cabs and sleepers cost about $25,000.
For that price, Bombela's company installs a shower, a microwave,
refrigerator, color television, flush toilet, sink, oak cabinets,
water holding tanks and generator. For a little extra money, they
will install water beds.
   ``We put in showers, flush toilets, computers, fax machines ...
even chandeliers.''
   But some truckers don't like the big cabs despite the added
comfort, he said. The large units, with extras, can add a thousand
pounds, a concern for truckers faced with weight limitations. And
the trucks are more difficult to drive because the wheel base is
stretched to accommodate the sleepers, he said.
   Paul Swesey, 27, of Panora, spent $40,000 to customize his truck
because he ``likes the show.''
   Swesey is a household goods mover and spends more than
three-quarters of the year on the road, sometimes not getting home
for months at a time.
   ``I go into a neighborhood and all the people want to see it.
They've never seen a truck like this one before,'' he said.
   It has a fax machine, phone and modem, computer with dual disk
drives, printer, microwave, sink with hot and cold water, portable
toilet, built in alarm clock, television and VCR with wireless
remote. The central vacuuming system is ``really slick,'' he said.
   He also has a 5-kilowatt generator ``so even when it's 20 below
you can stay nice and warm without idling the engine,'' he said.

   Bill Simmons, state capitol reporter
for The Associated Press in Little Rock, Ark., for nearly 20 years,
has been named chief of bureau for Arkansas by AP President Louis
D. Boccardi.
   Simmons, 48, succeeds Kristin Gazlay, who has been named special
projects editor at AP's New York headquarters. The changes take
effect Jan. 22.
   Simmons, a North Little Rock native, attended Little Rock
University and worked for the Arkansas Gazette as a copy boy and
sports writer. He joined AP in 1962, transferred to Detroit for two
years, and returned to Little Rock in 1968, where he served as news
editor.
   He has covered the state capitol regularly since 1970, including
the administrations of five governors.
   Gazlay, 31, has been bureau chief in Little Rock since 1987. She
spent four years as news editor and assistant chief of bureau in
Dallas and was correspondent in San Antonio for a year.
   She is a graduate of Southern Methodist University and joined
the AP in Dallas in 1980.

   Behind rows of ornate houses in this
village southeast of Bucharest stands a snowbound collection of
former stables that dictator Nicolae Ceausescu turned into a frigid
warehouse for the insane.
   A staff member and others say security police used to round up
dissidents and ``undesirables'' and detain them at this mental
hospital for weeks during political events, such as the visit of
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1987.
   The dissidents, alcoholics, and homeless people _ the
undesirables of Ceausescu's ``Golden Era'' for Romania _ are gone
after Ceausescu's ouster in popular revolution and execution Dec.
25.
   But 140 people suffering from mental illness still huddle
against the cold inside the drafty building.
   ``The conditions are terrible,'' said Stefana Dancu, one of two
pyschiatric nurses. ``This is a dirty, isolated and unhealthy
place.''
   In the women's section, 90 women share 70 beds, she said. While
all 50 male patients have their own bed, they must share a single
bathroom.
   The wards are rows of tightly packed hospital-white beds set on
bare unvarnished wooden floors in dim, narrow, drafty and barely
heated rooms.
   Many of the patients spend their days on their beds, fully
dressed and wrapped in coarse, heavy olive-drab wool blankets.
   ``The patients can have a bath once a week if there is any hot
water,'' said Ms. Dancu.
   In the morning they have tea and bread or biscuits. In the
evening there is cabbage and potatoes or beans and horrible black
coffee.
   ``There is never any meat,'' said Ms. Dancu. ``There are fresh
vegetables only in the summer. The only fruit is small apples that
we have only sometimes.''
   ``Until 15 years ago this was a stable,'' she said, adding that
she does not know why it was transformed into a hospital for the
insane.
   A decision on its future has been put off until after a
reorganization at the main psychiatric hospital in Bucharest, 18
miles away, she said.
   Healthy dissidents and ``undesirables,'' brought to the hospital
by the militia, suffered alongside the mentally ill, Ms. Dancu said.
   They were admitted during Communist Party congresses and major
political events, with many drugged despite not being ill, she
said. When the event ended, the doctor would say the treatment was
over, Ms. Dancu added.
   Dr. Marin Stancu, the only psychiatrist assigned to the asylum,
said the militia brought 153 patients there in 1987, 62 in 1988 and
45 in 1989. But he insisted all of those people suffered from some
mental illness.
   ``There were no healthy people here,'' he insisted.
   Another pyschiatrist and a police official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said they were told dissidents were brought
to the asylum in Cula. But they said the could not show any proof.
   Reporters were not allowed to look at hospital records to try to
trace former patients.
   Stancu said the militia would bring people to the hospital with
a card that said they were being admitted ``for diagnosis or for
disturbing the public order.''
   ``Ceausescu didn't like to see these people on the streets,''
said Stancu.
   ``They were unemployed people and gypsies and infirmed people,''
he added while continuing to insist that they were also mentally
ill.
   ``Most of those people were brought here because they wanted to
leave the country,'' said Ms. Dancu, who said she was assigned to
work in the asylum more than three years ago after applying for
permission to emigrate to Canada.
   Stancu and the nurse said the patients brought in by the militia
were designated M-313, a code they said referred to the decree that
allowed the militia to a bring people to a mental hospital.
   When Ms. Dancu was asked if she thought Stancu should be a
doctor, she said: ``No.''
   ``For this job you have to feel,'' she said.
   Stancu remained silent when he was asked if he ever complained
that the militia could just bring patients to the asylum. When
asked why he didn't refuse to accept such patients he replied:
   ``I did my job as a doctor and I treated them like people. I
couldn't refuse because they were sick people.''

<HEAD>Richard Wagner's Great-Grandson Seeks to Improve Composer's Image</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The music of German composer Richard Wagner, a
self-declared anti-Semite whose operas blared over loudspeakers in
Nazi death camps, is taboo in Israel.
   But Gottfried Wagner maintains that his great-grandfather's
music was exploited by the Nazis, and he is touring the Jewish
state to rectify what he calls the distorted image of the 19th
century composer.
   ``Wagner's message was exactly the opposite of what the Nazis
stood for,'' said the 42-year-old musicologist.
   He added, however, that he empathized with Jews who responded to
the music with anguish and anger.
   ``I understand completely if Israelis reject Wagner,'' he said
in an interview. ``Many Jews went to their deaths in the camps
while having to listen to his music.''
   His campaign, including media interviews and a university
lecture series, has renewed debate on whether to rescind the
unofficial boycott which has kept Wagner's operas off Israel's
airwaves.
   In the past, all efforts to break the boycott have been met with
stormy protest, although many Israelis say they listen to Wagner at
home.
   When after a 1981 Israel Philharmonic Orchestra concert,
conductor Zubin Mehta announced as an encore the prelude to the
Wagner opera ``Tristan and Isolde,'' the audience cied ``Shame!''
An usher rushed to the stage, pulled up his shirt to show
Nazi-inflicted scars and shouted, ``Play Wagner on my body!''
   Avi Shoshani, the orchestra's general secretary, said Wednesday
he regretted that Wagner's music was still off-limits.
   ``It's a big loss. Our orchestra would have played it
magnificently. It's a whole important segment in the history of
music we are not touching,'' Shoshani said.
   But Menahem Fogel, a spokesman for the Yad Vashem Holocaust
Memorial in Jerusalem, said Wagner should not be played as long
Holocaust survivors are alive. ``One has to consider the
sensitivities of the people who lived through that period,'' he
said.
   Shai Burstyn, head of the musicology department at Tel Aviv
University, said Richard Wagner held anti-Semitic views, although
they should be seen in the context of the times.
   ``I'm separating between the man and his music,'' said Burstyn,
whose department sponsored the lecture series. ``There was hardly a
19th century composer who was not an anti-Semite.''
   In an 1850 pamphlet, titled ``The Jew in Music,'' Richard Wagner
railed against what he considered the undue influence of Jews in
Germany's music circles.
   ``The pamphlet is shameful, but you can't draw a straight line
from this to Auschwitz,'' Gottfried Wagner said. He said his
great-grandfather was an ambitious man, who lashed out because he
felt the music establishment was withholding recognition of his
achievements.
   Despite the prejudice expressed in the pamphlet, the central
message of his work, especially of the operatic cycle ``The Ring of
the Nibelung,'' is one of hope, Wagner said.
   ``He felt that men have to choose between love and destruction.
He hoped that future generations would learn from the mistakes of
the past and opt for love, not destruction,'' Wagner said.
   This message was perverted when Hitler came to power 50 years
after the composer's death, Wagner said.
   Hitler befriended Winifred Wagner, Gottfried's grandmother and a
driving force at the Bayreuth Festival of Wagnerian music during
the Third Reich. The Nazi dictator and the Wagner clan subsequently
turned the composer's operatic protagonists, anti-heroes who always
met tragic ends, into ``blond Aryan monsters,'' he said.
   Wagner said he distanced himself from the family early on. He
conducted research on German Jewish culture and wrote a doctoral
dissertation on German Jewish composer Kurt Weill.
   Wagner, who lives in Cerro Maggiore, Italy, and also works as a
stage and TV director, said he came to Israel to begin a dialogue
about his great-grandfather.
   However, he said, a matter-of-fact discussion about the composer
might only be possible in another 20 years.
   In the meantime, he said, he was not pushing too hard for an end
of the Wagner ban. ``This is up to the Israelis, especially the
victims of the Holocaust.''

   A possible split in the Kremlin's military
alliance will be on the agenda Tuesday when top military officers
from the United States, Soviet Union and 33 other nations hold a
first-of-a-kind meeting in Vienna.
   U.S. delegates, headed by Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, will press their Soviet counterparts to
explain what one American official called ``discrepancies'' between
Soviet military doctrine and deployment and production levels.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has proclaimed a doctrine of
``reasonable sufficiency'' based on a more defensive posture,
declaring unilateral troop cuts and a willingness to conclude a
multinational agreement to reduce conventional armies in Europe
this year.
   But Gorbachev's words and deeds have been outstripped by the
political revolution sweeping Eastern Europe and the demands of
some of the new non-communist governments. U.S. analysts say more
changes are inevitable in the Warsaw Pact alliance.
   ``No one could have foreseen the dramatic events which have
swept over Eastern Europe during the past 12 months,'' said a
statement issued by John J. Maresca, chairman of the U.S.
delegation to the conference, entitled ``Confidence and Security
Building Measures in Europe.''
   ``Many of the political and security relationships which have
become so familiar over the last four decades are being challenged
in new ways every day, and it has become increasingly difficult to
anticipate events,'' Maresca said.
   A senior U.S. official, briefing reporters, said the Eastern
European countries ``are expressing very different views.'' Warsaw
Pact ``discipline isn't what it used to be.''
   ``Given the changes in Eastern Europe, this (conference) has
taken on great significance.'' But ``we can't guarantee any
dramatic results'' from the seminar, said the official, who spoke
on condition that he not be further identified.
   Powell and his Soviet counterpart, Chief of Staff Mikhail A.
Moiseyev, will stay in Vienna for the first few days of the
three-week seminar, officials said.
   The session will mark the first time that top military officers
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact, plus
the neutral and non-aligned states of Europe, will sit down to
discuss their intentions, plans and arsenals, U.S. officials said.
   ``We view the seminar itself as a confidence-building measure,''
said the senior official.
   U.S. delegates also have some pointed questions about Soviet
troop deployments and production, he said.
   ``Until very recently, Soviet production of tanks remained the
same, even higher'' than it was before Gorbachev declared
unilateral troop reductions and a new military doctrine, the
official said.
   Tank production has since declined, however, and the official
said other questionable areas included ``supply of fuel oils and
munition stocks stationed on the frontier.''
   Pressed for specifics, the official would say only, ``in some
cases they haven't changed. Let's leave it at that.''
   The military seminar starts a month before Secretary of State
James A. Baker III travels to Ottawa, Canada, for a discussion
among the 16 NATO and seven Warsaw Pact nations on President Bush's
``open skies'' proposal for sanctioned spy plane missions across
other nations.
   The senior U.S. official said there was no direct tie between
the military seminar and the ``open skies'' meeting, although the
official said the two subjects ``mesh.''

   When the authors of the Constitution finished
work in Philadelphia in 1787, a Mrs. Powel called out to Benjamin
Franklin: ``Well, doctor, what have we got _ a republic or a
monarchy?''
   ``A republic, if you can keep it,'' Franklin replied.
   Now the people of Eastern Europe, having overthrown their
despots in the revolutions of 1989, can also ask, ``What have we
got?''
   For the first time in nearly half a century, they've got the
opportunity to establish self-government and its economic
counterpart, capitalism.
   But can they keep it? Do they know how these institutions work
after decades of one-party government and state-run economies? Is
the drive toward self-government and a free-market system
instinctive or must it be learned?
   Both are based on harnessed self-interest (or, some might say,
on greed.) Sounds natural.
   But even if people grasp the rudiments, some experts think that
building the structures to allow democracy and capitalism to
function is going to take a struggle, take years and carry risks _
including the risk that in overthrowing communism the people could
yet embrace fascism, with its father-figure appeal.
   ``People want liberty naturally, but the working out of
institutions is a very complicated process,'' says Richard Pipes,
professor of Russian history at Harvard and a former adviser on
Eastern Europe in Ronald Reagan's White House.
   ``The Russians in 1917 were wild for liberty and democracy, but
it collapsed in a matter of months because they didn't have the
traditions, the institutions,'' he says.
   ``In some countries of Eastern Europe some traditions of
democracy survive _ in Czechoslovakia and to a lesser extent Poland
and Hungary and maybe East Germany. There wouldn't be much in
Romania or Bulgaria.''
   On the other hand, says Pipes, it is only normal for people to
want to run their own lives. To test that theory, think of the
opposite, he says: Who would opt for slavery?
   Robert Conquest, a specialist on the Soviet Union at the Hoover
Institution on War, Revolution and Peace at Stanford University,
suspects East Europe's economic rebirth will be more troublesome
than its political renewal.
   In politics, he says, ``they can go back to their old
constitutions,'' but on the economic front ``they're stuck with
these apparatuses of uselessness.'' In a system that guaranteed a
job to everyone, no one worked hard.
   Postwar Germany had no trouble adapting to democracy. Konrad
Adenauer, first chancellor of West Germany, knew how it worked,
Conquest notes. ``He had been mayor of Cologne before Hitler.''
   Government Professor Harvey Mansfield Jr. of Harvard worries
that fascism could beckon if democracy founders in East Europe.
   Democracy, he says, concerns itself with ``petty questions _
survival and comfort and not something higher'' while in the prewar
years ``fascism gave the promise of something higher _ the
regeneration of the human race by getting rid of weaklings. There
was an idealism in fascism that one shouldn't underestimate.''
   Conquest doubts fascism's likely appeal. In East Europe, he
says, ``I think the attraction of democratic liberty is very, very
great. They have a higher opinion of the West than the West does.''
   Economist Murray Weidenbaum, who served on a mission to survey
Poland's economy for President Bush, thinks that while all people
``have the entrepreneurial profit-seeking instinct,'' that doesn't
mean capitalism will catch hold easily.
   ``They have to learn business infrastructure, like cost
accounting, contract law, preparation of financial statements _
that isn't instinctive.''
   Nobel Prize economist Paul A. Samuelson of MIT agrees.
   ``The market structure is a very channeled form of greed,'' he
says. ``If people insist on putting sand in sugar or if people
blandly borrow $1,000 one hour and declare bankruptcy the next,
that makes a market system that works very badly.''
   Adds Weidenbaum: ``The Poles see the benefits of capitalism but
don't see the costs. That's one of the concerns I have. I don't
know if they realize that capitalism is not a profit system but a
profit-or-loss system. In the best of times, thousands of companies
go broke.''
   Similarly, Mansfield worries that East Europeans could botch the
construction of democratic structures. France, he notes, had to try
out four republics before coming around to its present Fifth
Republic, which seems to be working.
   Even in 1787, when Benjamin Franklin answered Mrs. Powel's
question, the Constitution represented a second attempt. The
Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union of 1781 had been a
flop.
   And, notes Pipes, ``the people who founded this republic were
English in their culture, which had overthrown despotism and
experienced revolution. We were the beneficiaries of that.''
   On the other hand, he says, East Europeans ``are so fed up with
depotism of any kind, right or left, that you're going to se a
tremendous desire for democracy and capitalism.''

   About half of Americans say job stress affects
their health, personal relationships or their ability to do their
job, according to a Gallup poll released today.
   The poll also found less than half, or 41 percent, of the
nation's workers are on a career or job path they had planned. The
rest have their jobs due to chance, were influenced by family or
friends or took the only job they could find.
   The survey of 1,350 people was conducted for the National
Occupational Information Coordinating Committee, a panel Congress
created to make better use of job information. The poll, which
asked a variety of job-related questions, had a margin of error of
plus or minus 4 percentage points.
   Other findings showed nearly one-third of the work force expects
to change jobs within the next three years and that 65 percent said
that given a chance to start over, they would try to get more
information about career options.
   Of employed adults who responded, 25 percent said job stress or
pressure had interfered with their off-the-job relationships, 20
percent said it had affected their physical health and 20 percent
said it had affected their ability to do their job.
   But responding to the same question, 48 percent reported little
or no job stress over the past year. The totals exceeded 100
percent because of multiple responses.
   Sharon Dannan, research director at the Cleveland-based 9 to 5,
National Association of Working Women, said more Americans are
probably suffering from job-related stress than admit it.
   ``There's lots of people who probably don't realize that's what
it is, that their job is full of interruptions, or that they have
multiple bosses telling them it's priority work, and that it's
driving them nuts,'' she said.
   The poll showed that 41 percent of the employed respondents
consciously chose their career path; 18 percent got started through
chance circumstances; 12 percent took the only job available; and
the rest were either influenced by friends or relatives.
   Juliette Lester, executive director of the committee, said the
results showing fewer than half of Americans are on planned job
paths demonstrates the need for government and job counselors to
improve the way they educate the public about careers.
   The poll also showed 40 percent said higher pay would give them
an incentive to accomplish more at work; 31 percent cited more
recognition. Other incentives included additional training, chance
for advancement and more control over their job.

   President Bush's secret diplomacy with China
is still a secret to many Americans, according to a survey of
public interest in the news released today.
   The Times Mirror News Interest Index for January showed only 6
percent of those polled said they followed ``very closely'' news of
a December visit to China by two top administration officials.
   Another 18 percent said they followed the story fairly closely.
   Leading the public interest's in December was the U.S. invasion
of Panama, which the survey said was followed closely by 60 percent
of readers. That made it the fourth most closely followed news
event since Times Mirror began the measurements in 1986.
   News of the bloody revolution in Romania was followed very
attentively only by 28 percent of those responding.
   Even among the groups usually most interested in foreign
affairs, interest in the China story was relatively slack, with 35
percent of those over 50 years old and 33 percent of college
graduates saying they paid close attention.
   That contrasts sharply with the interest shown in developments
in China earlier in the year. The midsummer Times Mirror survey
found 47 percent of those polled showed sharp interest in
developments in China, including the violent crackdown on massive
pro-democracy demonstrations.
   Bush sent National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Deputy
Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger to China in December to lay
the groundwork for normalizing relations again in the wake of the
Beijing regime's June move against demonstrators.
   The mission was announced after Scowcroft and Eagleburger
arrived in the Chinese capital. Later, it was disclosed Scowcroft
had traveled to Beijing barely a month after the Tiananmen Square
crackdown. The missions brought sharp criticism from some in both
parties who said the president's conciliatory approach didn't match
harshness of China's brutal crackdown.
   Among those under 30, only 3 percent said they followed the
controversy very closely. Among non-whites, the proportion was 9
percent.
   The Panama story has been exceeded in public interest as
measured by the survey only by the 1986 explosion of the space
shuttle Challenger, last October's San Francisco earthquake and the
rescue in 1987 of Jessica McClure from a Texas well.
   The earthquake was followed closely by nearly three-quarters of
those surveyed in early November, making it the most closely
watched news story of the year, according to the poll.
   Earlier in 1989, Hurricane Hugo's devastation of Caribbean
islands and the Carolinas was followed closely by 60 percent of
those surveyed. The top interest the survey found in a Washington
story last year was the summer's controversy over flag burning,
which was followed closely by 51 percent.
   The Supreme Court's ruling giving states greater power to
regulate abortion was followed closely by 47 percent.
   Asked what most interested them most in the Panama story, most
of those interviewed said it was the effort to take Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega into custody.
   The survey results indicated the ongoing political changes in
East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary drew close attention from
29 percent of those polled, 1 percentage point more than the events
in Romania.
   Fifty-six percent said they believed the invasion of Panama was
the most important thing to happen last month. Political change in
East Bloc countries in general was cited by 18 percent and the
revolution in Romania specifically by 5 percent.
   Asked to recall people in the news, 76 percent came up with the
name of Noriega. He was followed by Bush with 58 percent. Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev was named by 16 percent and the late
Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu by 12 percent.
   The latest survey results are based on telephone interviews
conducted Jan. 4-7 by the Gallup Organization under the direction
of Princeton Survey Research Associates among 1,207 adults, 18 or
older.
   The Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press, which
sponsors the survey, said it is subject to sampling and other
random errors of 3 percentage points.

<HEAD>Civil Rights Leaders Say Yonkers Decision May Have Limited Impact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Supreme Court ruling that let public
officials escape fines for defying a federal judge's order to end
racial discrimination is regrettable but may have limited impact,
civil rights leaders say.
   ``I think the decision is more significant as a political symbol
than legally,'' said Steven Shapiro, a lawyer with the American
Civil Liberties Union.
   ``It will be perceived as a further step away from the court's
commitment to civil rights.''
   The high court split 5-4 Wednesday in overturning fines against
four Yonkers, N.Y., councilmen who blocked a housing desegregation
plan.
   ``We do not regard this as a particularly injurious decision as
the Supreme Court also let stand the ability of a lower court to
fine a city that chooses to defy its orders,'' said Benjamin Hooks,
executive director of the NAACP.
   Ralph Neas, head of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights,
said the ruling is ``regrettable'' but ``does not appear to be a
measurable cutback in civil rights law.''
   Shapiro noted that the high court handed civil rights forces a
series of defeats in 1989 when it limited affirmative action, made
it tougher to prove job discrimination and restricted remedies for
on-the-job racial harassment.
   Those decisions touched off angry protests by civil rights
leaders.
   The Yonkers councilmen, one of them now mayor, celebrated the
decision with champagne.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said
the judge who imposed the fines exceeded his authority. The judge
should have waited to see whether potentially bankrupting penalties
against the city would force adoption of the desegregation plan
before even considering fining the councilmen, Rehnquist said.
   Justice William J. Brennan, in a dissenting opinion, lamented
that the ruling may encourage defiant public officials in other
bias cases. He said the majority was ``blind to the scourge of
racism in Yonkers.''
   In other action Wednesday, the court:
   _Ruled 5-4 in an Illinois case that statements a criminal
defendant makes after an unlawful arrest may not be used by
prosecutors to contradict a defense witness' trial testimony.
   _Unanimously limited the ability of multinational corporations
to challenge state taxes in federal court.
   In the Yonkers case, Rehnquist noted the court previously left
intact fines against the city.
   ``There can be no question about the liability of the city of
Yonkers for racial discrimination,'' he said.
   Brennan wrote:
   ``I worry that the court's message will have the unintended
effect of emboldening recalcitrant officials continually to test
the ultimate reach of the remedial authority of the federal
courts.''
   The ruling will not be the last word this year from the court on
the powers of federal judges to combat segregation. In a case from
Kansas City, Mo., that is expected to be decided by July, the court
is studying a judge's order to increase property taxes to help pay
for desegregating that city's schools.
   The Yonkers case attracted national attention in the summer of
1988 as the defiant councilmen were threatened with jail as well as
fines, and the city faced possible bankruptcy for refusing to obey
U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand's desegregation orders.
   Faced with massive layoffs of city workers, the city council
reversed itself and on Sept. 10, 1988, voted to comply with Sand's
order to build 1,000 low-cost omes to desegregate middle-class
areas of the city just north of New York City.
   But Yonkers still had to pay $819,000 in contempt fines. Fines
of $3,500 against each of the four councilmen will be returned to
them.
   The Yonkers case stems from a Justice Department lawsuit begun
by the Carter administration in its waning days in 1980.
   The Bush administration has said Sand acted properly in fining
the councilmen as well as the city.
   The four councilmen were Edward Fagan, Nicholas V. Longo, Peter
Chema and Henry Spallone.
   ``One thing is certain: We used the American court system and
the American court system made the determination that a federal
judge overstepped his power,'' Spallone, now mayor, said after the
ruling. ``I don't think it's the end. I think it's the beginning.''
   Joining Rehnquist in the majority opinion were Justices Byron R.
White, Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
Brennan was joined in his dissent by Justices Thurgood Marshall,
Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.

<HEAD>Ag Department Fear Cash Grain Farmers May Lose Income</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Department analysts say many
farmers who depend on selling grain crops for cash could be in
serious financial trouble this year, despite a general improvement
in the nation's agricultural sector.
   ``Right now, the farms that we're most concerned about, in terms
of their ability to prosper, are the traditional cash grain
farmers, wheat and corn producers in particular,'' said Gregory
Hanson of the department's Economic Research Service.
   Corn producers, perhaps more than others, are in jeopardy from
possible low market prices later this year, Hanson said Wednesday
in a telephone interview.
   Within the USDA agency, analysts are ``projecting corn prices
down about 50 cents a bushel between the second quarter of 1990 and
the fourth quarter'' when the harvests come into the market, he
said. That is assuming that crops will have good weather and that
per-acre yields will continue their upward trend.
   ``If that should happen while the farm debate (in Congress) is
in high gear, that could have an impact in itself,'' Hanson said.
   The USDA says its recent five-day average shows corn prices at
$2.24 per bushel. The analysts project prices could drop to about
$1.74 per bushel by fall.
   New farm legislation is in the works to replace the 1985 farm
law, which reduced federal price support and target price benefits
on major commodities. Hanson was asked to elaborate on a comment in
the January issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine.
   The report said: ``If the 1990 farm bill continues to lower
target prices in the spirit of the 1985 farm bill, government
payments could continue falling and impose financial strains on
vulnerable operators in the years to come.''
   According to USDA's forecasts, net cash income ``will likely
exceed $50 billion for the fourth consecutive year'' in 1990, up 2
percent to 4 percent from 1989. That is simply money left over from
gross cash income after paying cash expenses.
   However, another method shows that net farm income _ which take
into account changes in inventory values, depreciation and other
items during a calendar year _ may drop 2 percent to 5 percent from
$48 billion in 1989.
   As an example of the impact of lowering target prices, Hanson
said that under the 1985 farm law the target price for corn was
reduced each year by about 10 cents per bushel.
   The purpose of the target price system is to provide income
protection for farmers. If market prices average below the target,
direct payments are made to help make up the difference.
   Costs of direct subsidies rose to $16.7 billion in 1987 before
dropping to $14.5 billion in 1988 and about $11 billion in 1989.
According to USDA projections the payments may be in the range of
$8 billion to $11 billion in 1990.
   Hanson said the 1988 drought, by driving prices up
substantially, to some extent ``obscured the impact'' of the
downgrading of target prices and other changes allowed by the 1985
law.
   ``But now, we're saying that net farm income is likely to fall 2
to 5 percent in 1990. Had government payments stayed level _ or had
those declines in target prices not occurred _ net farm income
would be up, I'm sure, in 1990,'' he said. ``It's definitely having
an impact, there's no question about it.''
   The administration is seeking greater flexibility in 1990 farm
legislation to give farmers greater planting choices. Negotiations
under the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade also are aimed at freer global trade policies and more export
access for U.S. farm products.
   Even so, as President Bush told the American Farm Bureau
Federation earlier this week in Florida, the administration
promises to ``maintain a safety net to protect farmers from
conditions beyond their control.''
   Hanson said the farm bill debate has many complicated
dimensions. Some argue that since farm income is so high and the
financial crisis of the early 1980s is over, there is no need for
federal programs to protect farmers.
   ``On the other hand, people say direct payments have already
fallen from $17 billion in 1987 to maybe as low as $9 billion in
1990 and that farmers have already taken their hit,'' he said.
   Another side is represented by the Office of Management and
Budget, where White House budget cutters are seeking ways to reduce
the government's spending deficit. Putting the squeeze on farm
programs is one of the ways.
   ``So you not only have non-farm legislators wondering whether
this transfer (subsidy) program make any sense, but you have OMB
trying to wield their knives,'' Hanson said.
   Meanwhile, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter _ and his
predecessors for many years _ have been talking long and hard about
the benefits of freer trade and the importance of the Uruguay Round
of GATT talks that will conclude at the end of this year.
   ``That is having an effect,'' Hanson said. ``You can sense it.
On the other hand, one of the things learned in the 1980s _ and
brought home by the drought _ is that farm production and farm
prices remain highly unstable, they vary greatly from year to
year.''
   Thus, he added, ``It's just comforting, if you're a producer, to
know that the government is there to help redress some of those
down cycles.''

<HEAD>Nine S&amp;Ls On Sale Today</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arizona's largest thrift and eight other
savings associations are being offered for sale today by the
government agency created to manage President Bush's savings and
loan bailout.
   The institutions, under the control of the Resolution Trust
Corp., are in seven states and hold assets totaling $13.5 billion.
   The biggest is Western Savings and Loan Association of Phoenix,
a victim of the collapse in Arizona real estate prices.
   Western was seized by regulators June 15. On Sept. 30, it had
$5.83 billion in assets and $4.43 million in 426,137 deposit
accounts. At the time of its takeover, Western was the 38th largest
S&amp;L in the nation.
   The nine S&amp;Ls being sold are advertised in today's Wall Street
Journal, RTC spokesman Stephen J. Katsanos said Wednesday.
   The other institutions and their total assets as of Sept. 30 are:
   _Horizon Federal Savings and Loan Association, Southampton, Pa.,
$2.22 billion.
   _Gill Savings Association, Hondo, Texas, $1.25 billion.
   _American Federal Savings and Loan Association, Colorado
Springs, Colo., $880 million.
   _Bexar Savings Association, San Antonio, Texas, $820 million.
   _Blue Valley Federal Savings and Loan Association, Kansas City,
Mo., $788 million.
   _Anchor Federal Savings and Loan Association, Kansas City, Kan.,
$748 million.
   _Royal Palm Federal Savings and Loan Association, West Palm
Beach, Fla., $535 million.
   _Otero Savings, Colorado Springs, Colo., $482 million.
   Also, about 40 other thrifts will be put on the auction block
next week, each with assets of less than $500 million, Katsanos
said.
   Since its creation in August, the RTC has sold 37 bankrupt S&amp;Ls,
with $10 billion in assets, leaving 285 with $105 billion in assets
still in its charge. It expects to take over another 200 in coming
months.
   Earlier, the agency invited bids on 18 S&amp;Ls, with assets
totaling $13 billion, and expects to complete the sales within
several weeks, Katsanos said.
   The RTC hopes to close the sales of the nine to be offered today
and the 40 to be offered next week early in the April-June quarter.
If all goes as planned, that would bring the count of institutions
handled to about 104.
   The sale announcement came as pressure mounts on the agency to
speed up the pace of rescues. Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., who heads
a House task force overseeing the bailout, has criticized the
administration for failing to move faster.
   Katsanos said the sale of S&amp;Ls being offered today and next week
have been planned for several months.
   ``We have been moving these as expeditiously as can be done,''
he said.
   He warned that when the latest batch of sales is finished, the
RTC will face a cash crunch unless the Bush administration and
Congress agree on a plan to raise $50 billion to $100 billion in
additional financing.
   Under the original $50 billion bailout plan, the RTC has
received $24 billion and will get another $4 billion to $5 billion
from a debt sale scheduled Jan. 23.
   However, the administration says the agency needs an additional
$50 billion to $100 billion in working capital that later would be
repaid by selling assets from the bankrupt S&amp;Ls.

<HEAD>Banks Ordered to Double Reserves on Argentine Loans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal banking agencies are ordering the
nation's largest banks to more than double reserves set aside for
anticipated losses on loans to economically troubled Argentina.
   The order, expected to depress industry earnings in the fourth
quarter, requires banks to hold reserves of at least 35 percent of
the loan amount, up from 15 percent, said a Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. official who spoke Wednesday on condition of
anonymity.
   It is unclear how the decision will affect individual banks.
   Some likely already have loss reserves large enough to cover 35
percent of their loans to Argentina. But others, such as Citicorp
and BankAmerica Corp. of San Francisco, have proportionately
smaller loss reserves for Third World debt than competitors.
   Jim Mitchell, a spokesman for BankAmerica Corp., said the bank
was aware of the new reserve requirement but declined to say what
the effect would be on his institution.
   ``A discussion of our LDC (less developed country) reserve
coverage and related issues will be a routine part of our
(fourth-quarter) earnings announcement, which we expect to make
next week,'' he said.
   BankAmerica Corp.'s stock was unchanged Wednesday at $27.50 on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   Prices fell for the shares of several other large banks.
   Chase Manhattan closed at $31.50, down 37{ cents; Chemical Bank,
$30.12{, down 12{ cents; Citicorp, $27, down 25 cents; and
Manufacturers Hanover Trust, $32.25, down $1.
   In the third quarter, the nation's 12,800 commercial banks
collectively recorded a $744 million loss, the first in two years.
The industry was pushed into the red by $5.3 billion in Third World
debt losses at five large banks.
   The decision on Argentina loans likely will produce another
disappointing report for the fourth quarter. It stems from a
recommendation from the Interagency Country Review Committee, which
coordinates Third World lending matters among banking agencies,
including the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board and the Comptroller
of the Currency.
   The committee customarily does not announce its decisions.
   Argentina, which owed $6.2 billion to U.S. banks at the end of
September, is Latin America's fourth-largest debtor to U.S.
financial institutions. The three largest debtors are: Brazil,
which owes them $19.1 billion; Mexico, $15.7 billion; and
Venezuela, $6.9 billion.
   Mexico has scrupulously kept up its payments, but both Brazil
and Argentina are in arrears.
   Argentina's economy has deteriorated sharply recently, beset by
hyperinflation. Its currency, the austral, has lost 99 percent of
its value over the past year.
   On Monday, prices of the leading stocks on the Buenos Aires
Stock Exchange plunged 53 percent after the exchange was closed for
more than a week.

   Latin American countries are cutting into
their debt to U.S. banks even as the nations' debt to the rest of
the world increases, according to a government report.
   The debt of Latin American countries to U.S. banks declined by
some $2.4 billion in the three months ending in September 1989,
falling to $48.3 billion, the Federal Reserve reported Wednesday.
   Though Latin American debt to the world has been rising
steadily, banks in the United States have been accepting repayments
and new lending has not kept up with the payments.
   In September 1984, five years before the period of the new
report, Latin nations owed U.S. banks just less than $74 billion,
the report noted.
   But since then, the total owed to U.S. banks by Brazil, the
Third World's biggest debtor, has fallen from about $24.6 billion
to $19.1 billion. Mexico owed some $25.9 billion five years ago. By
last September, Mexico's debt was down to $15.7 billion.
   Mexico has kept scrupulously up with its interest payments
despite falling wages and living standards.
   The debt has also been reduced by what are called
``debt-equity'' swaps. Debts to U.S. banks are due in dollars.
Sometimes debtor governments will allow the banks to take payment
in their own currency and use the money to buy local industry.
   Chile has used this device extensively. Other debtor governments
are less enthusiastic, both because they dislike seeing foreigners
own more of their countries' assets and because such deals add to
the local currency in circulation, boosting inflation. Runaway
prices are a problem in Brazil and Argentina.
   There have also been reductions in the amount owed to American
banks by troubled debtors outside Latin America.
   The Federal Reserve said Nigeria cut its American bank debt from
about $1.5 billion to $486 million over five years. The
Philippines' total was down from $5.1 billion to $3.2 billion.
   So far, there has been no reduction as a result of the strategy
announced last March by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. An
agreement announced in October on Costa Rica is expected to reduce
its $4.5 billion debt by $1 billion.
   A bigger deal for Mexico has not been completed.
   According to the World Bank, Latin American debt has risen
worldwide _ including debts to the World Bank _ from $377 billion
in 1984 to $434 billion last year.

   A cleanup was prescribed and then
administered by doctors who said city residents were collectively
down in the dumps because of its litter.
   Dr. Ben Singletary said the two or three dozen doctors who
collected 3,800 pounds of trash in November along Interstate 20
plan another pickup Jan. 20 because ``today, it looks like a hog
pen.''
   The Shreveport Medical Society decided a year ago that the
city's slovenly appearance was psychologically harmful because it
was a constant reminder of hard economic times, said Singletary,
president of the society.
   ``About this time last year we began looking at our city and
surrounding area,'' Singletary said Tuesday. ``What is wrong? We
knew we were economically depressed.
   ``Finally, after weeks of looking at this we came up with the
conclusion that we're all emotionally depressed, a little whipped
down, a whipped dog.''
   In addition to the trash pickup, Singletary said, the society
plans to raise an 11-flag display at six entrances into the city
limits, plant crape myrtles along the highway and make sure the
grass stays mowed.

   Not all of Santa's toy makers work at
the North Pole. Some work in a place called Spring Lake.
   At least that's how Greg and Helen Garvey regard their
co-workers at Weber Precision Grinding Co. who built a special
tricycle for their daughter.
   Three-year-old Kandi Garvey was born with spina bifida and can't
walk.
   On Christmas, she Kandi found the maroon tricycle, its pedals
operated by the hands instead of the feet, under the tree.
   ``She had all kinds of presents, dolls and books and toys, but
it was the tricycle that caught her eye,'' Mrs. Garvey said. ``She
said `Mom, Santa brought me a bike,' and she wanted to get on it
right away.''
   Ken Sutton took the lead in rebuilding a standard tricycle
during his breaks at Weber.
   ``Basically, I took the pedals off the wheels and put them on
the handlebars,'' he said. ``It was pretty easy.''

   The Pentagon will consider women who fought in
Panama for several decorations honoring valor but not for the
Combat Infantryman Badge.
   None of several hundred women who served in the Panama operation
serve in infantry units, a requirement to be considered for the
Combat Infantryman Badge, Army spokesman, Maj. Joe Padilla, said
Wednesday.
   ``They will be eligible for decorations and awards for valor _
the Bronze Star, Silver Star, Distinguished Service Cross, and the
Medal of Honor,'' Padilla said.
   But the major said, ``A person has to see action and has to be a
member of an infantry unit'' to be eligible for the Combat
Infantryman Badge.
   About 9,000 of the 26,000 troops involved in the invasion were
in the infantry, Padilla said, but not all will receive the Combat
Infantryman Badge.
   Under Army policy, women are excluded from military specialties,
such as the infantry, that are deemed combat-related.
   The issue has drawn attention in light of the actions of Capt.
Linda Bray, who commanded the 988th Military Police Company when it
seized the Panamanian Defense Forces canine unit during the Dec. 20
invasion.
   In that encounter, as well as others, female soldiers came under
and returned fire.
   Padilla said it is up to the Army's chain of command to make
decisions awarding medals and each case is reviewed individually.

   The Bush administration says it will propose
shifting more of the cost of the nation's transportation system to
state and local governments, individual users and the private
sector.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner said in a speech
Wednesday that his department's blueprint for improving the
country's highways, bridges, rail lines, airports and harbors
proposes to ``move the action closer to the people.''
   He said portions of the new strategy ``will be reflected in the
administration's 1991 budget proposal and in a number of actions
the Department of Transportation will be taking over the next few
weeks and months.''
   David Prosperi, a spokesman for Skinner, said details of the
proposals will be released with the administration's budget request
and President Bush's State of the Union address later this month.
   But Skinner was clear about the administration's intentions.
   ``First of all, we envision a stronger, healthier partnership
among federal, state and local governments,'' Skinner said at an
annual meeting of the Transportation Research Board, which acts as
an independent adviser to the government.
   But having a less intrusive federal government would also mean
shifting the financial burden, Skinner said.
   ``At the same time, a healthier partnership goes hand-in-hand
with reduced dependence on federal money,'' he said. ``We believe
federal recipients of federal transportation aid should pay a
larger share of project costs.''
   In addition, he said, ``We're going to be looking for new and
creative ways to apply the time-tested user fee principle.
   ``We intend to recover from users the maximum practical share of
costs they impose. This includes recovering federal costs from user
groups that are now getting a free ride. We also want to make it
easier for other levels of government to levy user fees for
transportation improvements.''
   A third strategy, he said, would ``stimulate more private
investment in transportation'' such as toll roads. The five-point
strategy also calls for regulatory changes, such as having railroad
workers covered by workers' compensation, and promoting new
technology and research and development.
   The Reagan administration had advocated such fees, but it was
repeatedly rebuffed by Congress in efforts to impose user fees on
recreational boaters and others who benefit from Coast Guard
services.
   Administration officials have said they do not view the user
fees as taxes so they would not violate the president's pledge of
no new taxes. Last month, administration sources floated the idea
of imposing fees on recreational vehicles and equipment to pay for
conservation.
   Republican lawmakers have proposed letting local airports impose
a departure fee, or ``head tax,'' to help pay for air
transportation improvements. Airline passengers already pay an 8
percent federal ticket tax.
   On another subject, Skinner defended the department's ambitious
air traffic modernization plan against calls by a private pilots'
organization for a congressional investigation.
   The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association said Wednesday the
National Airspace System plan is over budget and behind schedule
and using outdated technology.
   Skinner said he is satisfied with the program and blames any
problems on the unprecedented growth in air traffic.
   ``That system will not only allow us to enhance our capacity to
handle it,'' Skinner said. ``It will develop the technology and
expertise that American companies will sell all over the world.''

<HEAD>Ferraro Considering Political Comeback</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Geraldine Ferraro, the first woman to win a
slot on a major party's presidential ticket, says she's considering
a political comeback.
   Ferraro, Walter Mondale's running mate on the 1984 Democratic
ticket, is weighing a challenge to New York Republican Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato.
   The former three-term congresswoman says she isn't worried that
a political campaign would resurrect hurtful stories about her or
her family.
   ``I don't think there's very much that the people of this state
or this nation don't know about me or about my family,'' Ferraro
said Wednesday in a telephone interview from New York.
   Ferraro was hounded by questions about her family's finances
during the 1984 campaign. She later complained that her political
fame hurt her family and led to harsher court treatment of her
husband and son.
   Her husband, John Zaccaro, pleaded guilty in 1985 to a
misdemeanor charge in a real estate deal. Her son, John Zaccaro
Jr., later was convicted of selling a quarter-gram of cocaine while
at Middlebury College in Vermont.
   ``I would love to back in Washington, I would love to be part of
the decision-making process with reference to what's going on in
this country,'' said Ferraro, 54, who lives in the New York City
borough of Queens.
   A race against Rep. Thomas Manton, who holds Ferraro's former
seat, is out of the question, she said.
   ``I endorsed him and he is a Democrat who represents my district
very, very well.''
   D'Amato's second term ends in 1992. Recent polls show his
popularity is slipping, primarily because of reports that he used
his influence to steer money from the Department of Housing and
Urban Development to friends nd political supporters.
   The Senate ethics committee has hired an outside counsel to
decide whether it should launch a full-scale investigation of
D'Amato.
   Ferraro flirted with the idea of taking on D'Amato in 1986, but
pulled back, citing personal reasons.
   Wednesday, Ferraro said she ruled out that Senate race because
she feared the power of Attorney General Edwin Meese III. The
Justice Department was investigating complaints that she had failed
to fully disclose her husband's finances while she was in Congress.
   ``That investigation continued well past the campaign, nursed by
people within the Justice Department, and I found out later that Ed
Meese had personal interest in it and was tying it to my political
decisions,'' she said.
   ``I did not doubt for one minute that he would use it
politically against me.''
   The 22-month investigation ended with the department deciding
there was no basis for a criminal or civil action.

   The United States, angry at a U.N. agriculture
organization that supported the Palestine Liberation Organization,
is sharply cutting its contribution to the body and may pull out
altogether.
   The State Department announced Wednesday it would pay the ``$18
million necessary to retain our vote'' in the Food and Agriculture
Organization, said spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler. The United States
was supposed to pay $61.4 million, or 25 percent of the agency's
budget, in 1989.
   ``We will reassess our participation in the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization during 1990,'' Tutwiler said.
   The FAO's resolution last November, adopted by 96 members with
14 abstentions and only the United States and Israel opposing,
called for the organization to provide Palestinians in the
Israeli-occupied territories with assistance ``in close cooperation
with the PLO.''
   It also criticized Israel's ``confiscation of Palestinian land
and the expropriation of Palestinian water resources.''
   The United States argued the resolution was political and
inconsistent with the organization's goal of providing agricultural
assistance to developing nations.
   In Rome, an FAO official said the U.S. decision to cut funds was
``unfair and unjustified.'' The official, who asked not to be
named, said the resolution ``doesn't say the FAO must work through
the PLO'' and claimed the United States misunderstood the reasoning
behind the adopted language.
   The United States issued several appeals and requests to the FAO
last fall to modify the resolution, which was presented by Arab
states, but U.S. officials complain their calls were largely
ignored.
   The United States was also angered by the budget adopted at the
meeting, which projected a 3 percent growth for 1990 and 1991, said
a State Department official. The United States had sought a budget
freeze pending reforms, the official said.
   The governing council also denied U.S. representative Dan
Amstutz his right to chair the FAO council under a rotation system,
compounding U.S. anger, the U.S. official said.
   The United States has clashed repeatedly with the United Nations
and its affiliated agencies over their budgets and their support
for the PLO.
   The United States is the member most in arrears to the U.N. Last
October, it delivered a $65 million check to the organization,
reducing its debt to $635 million.
   The debt began to accrue in 1985, when President Reagan withheld
some dues from the U.N. to protest what he said was the body's
anti-American bias, its overblown budget and inefficient
administration.
   The United Nations did enact some reforms, but Congress last
fall turned down the administration's request for an additional $46
million to pay some of the back dues.

   An Institute of Medicine panel is sorting
through conflicting opinions on the safety of the vaccine that
prevents whooping cough amid claims the government is wrongly
downplaying the risks.
   The panel heard testimony Wednesday from medical and legal
experts as part of a congressionally-required review of possible
problems with the vaccine.
   Experts with the American Academy of Pediatrics told the review
committee no scientific evidence proves the vaccine can cause brain
damage or death, and if it does cause such effects, they are rare _
less than 1 in 300,000.
   But others said more than 1,000 reported cases of severe
reaction to the vaccine should warrant caution and highlight the
need for a safer vaccine, which they say is now available in other
countries.
   The Institute of Medicine panel of 12 medical and public health
experts was formed at the request of the Department of Health and
Human Services to review information on possible problems from
vaccines against pertussis, or whooping cough, and rubella, better
known as German measles.
   Jeffrey H. Schwartz, a Washington lawyer who says his daughter's
death from a seizure in 1984 was diagnosed as caused by the
pertussis vaccine, charged the government is engaged in ``a
conspiracy of silence and denial'' by withholding information about
the danger of the vaccine.
   Government public health officials, in their zeal to promote
mass immunizations to wipe out contagious diseases, are
deliberately understating the severe side effects the pertussis
vaccine can cause, said Schwartz.
   Schwartz spoke on behalf of Dissatisfied Parents Together, a
nationwide group of parents whose children have been injured or
killed by vaccines. His group was instrumental in pushing through
the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, which required
the vaccine review and established a federal compensation program
for families.
   The whooping cough vaccine is usually given with the vaccines
for diphtheria and tetanus, which together are referred to as the
DPT vaccine, to children in a series of four shots beginning at
around 2 months. It is required by state laws for admission to
school.
   ``We have not advocated that parents not get the vaccine,''
Schwartz said. ``But we are pushing for a safer vaccine'' and more
caution in giving the vaccine to children who have a family history
of seizures or have had a severe reaction to an earlier DPT shot.
   Dr. Stanley Plotkin, an official of the American Academy of
Pediatrics and a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said
there is no scientific data that shows the pertussis vaccine causes
severe neurological damage or death. However, the vaccine can bring
to light or exacerbate pre-existing conditions, he said.
   He disputed contentions that a pertussis vaccine being used in
Japan is safer and as effective as the one used in the United
States. Applications to approve this vaccine are pending at the
Food and Drug Administration.
   Plotkin also downplayed reports that arthritis may be associated
with the rubella vaccine when given to adult women. He said that in
about 25 percent of the cases, women have ``aches and pains'' but
that the symptoms usually last only for a few days.
   ``We have no reason to believe it's anything more than that,''
he said.

   David Goerlitz, whose macho good looks
earned him thousands as a model for Winston cigarettes, has turned
on the tobacco industry's attempts to make smoking look pretty.
   He said his 3{-pack-a-day smoking habit led to a stroke.
   ``I was paid $2,500 a day to hang off this mountain to make
(smoking) look rugged and make it look successful, make it look
prosperous, make it look wonderful,'' the 40-year-old Goerlitz said
Wednesday. ``All these ads are nothing more than mere lies.''
   Goerlitz, the ``Winston man'' from 1981 to 1987, was the
headliner for a forum on New York's new statewide smoking law,
which took effect Jan. 1 and prohibits smoking in auditoriums,
elevators, gymnasiums, food stores, shared taxicabs and limousines.
   Goerlitz showed several of the poster ads he made while a model
for R.J. Reynolds, which makes Winstons.
   ``I'm not proud of this part of my life, folks,'' said Goerlitz.
``I'm not proud of who I am in these ads.''
   Many school children were in the audience to hear his
presentation.
   ``What you don't see is the man behind the myth ... being paid
$75,000 to $100,000 a year to glamorize a product that I was
addicted to for 23 years,'' he said.
   Goerlitz said the stroke has taken away feeling in his left leg
and the left side of his face and has robbed him of his ability to
taste food.

   Yelena Bonner, widow of Soviet Nobel Peace
Prize winner Andrei Sakharov, will speak at a peace forum organized
by former Vice President Walter Mondale.
   Bonner and Sakharov, himself, confirmed their joint engagement
at the 1990 Peace Prize Forum at Augsburg College on Dec. 11, just
three days before he died, college officials said. The officials
renewed the offer to Bonner last week, and she accepted.
   ``It is singularly appropriate that Dr. Bonner should
participate in the forum,'' college president Charles Anderson said
this week. ``Throughout her life, Dr. Bonner, like Dr. Sakharov,
has passionately embraced the causes of peace and human rights.''
   Augsburg officials were awaiting word on whether the Dalai Lama,
the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize winner, will speak at the forum,
scheduled for Feb. 17.
   Other speakers will include former President Carter; Peter
Duffy, chairman of the executive committee of Amnesty
International; Max Kampelman, former ambassador and arms negotiator
and current chairman of Freedom House; Flora Lewis, foreign
correspondent for The New York Times, and Geir Lundestad, executive

   The former president of a local NAACP chapter
filed a $10 million libel lawsuit against Arsenio Hall for the
second time, accusing the talk show host of racist and obscene
slurs.
   Willis Edwards, who recently resigned as president of the
Beverly Hills-Hollywood chapter, also named Rolling Stone magazine
as a defendant in Tuesday's lawsuit.
   Edwards said he was libeled and slandered when Hall described
him in a Rolling Stone interview as a pimp and a phony.
   A spokeswoman for Hall did not return a telephone message
seeking comment.
   John Jordan, a spokesman for Rolling Stone, said magazine
officials had no knowledge of the lawsuit and would not comment.
   In January 1989, Edwards sued Hall for $10 million for libel
after Hall allegedly told a radio interviewer that Edwards had
tried to extort $40,000 from Hall to block publicity that Hall
failed to hire black writers, directors or producers for his show.
   Edwards announced his resignation last month, on the night of
the NAACP's Image Awards for black achievement in entertainment.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People had

<HEAD>Bush Seeks to Soothe Colombian Anger With Call to Barco</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is seeking to personally soothe
what an official called Colombia's ``political sensitivities'' that
erupted in anger over reports the United States was planning an
antidrug blockade off Colombia.
   Bush on Wednesday telephoned President Virgilio Barco to disavow
intention of a blockade and ``to express regret over the recent
misunderstanding'' caused by press reports about U.S. plans for
antidrug efforts off South America, the White House said.
   Although officials earlier said plans were being set for what
one Pentagon source called a ``virtual sea and air blockade'' of
Colombia to interdict drugs, Bush denied that was the intention.
   ``The president assured President Barco that the U.S. never
intended to conduct any activities within Colombian territorial
waters, that no U.S. actions would be taken without the full
cooperation and consent of the Colombian government, that no
`blockade' was ever contemplated and that he had not authorized
naval maneuvers, as incorrectly described in the press,'' according
to a statement by White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk.
   Last week, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
confirmed the United States would undertake stepped-up interdiction
efforts, but would not specifically comment on a blockade.
   The intensified controversy arose over the weekend when
Colombian press reports said two Navy ships, the guided-missile
cruiser USS Virginia and the aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy,
were steaming toward Colombia to begin the blockade.
   Administration officials insisted those ships, which had sailed
from Norfolk, Va., Thursday, were merely undertaking routine
maneuvers in the Atlantic.
   They said Bush had not yet agreed to any increased interdiction
plan and discussions were still pending with Colombia.
   One source said, however, the Kennedy was selected to lead the
seaborne antidrug effort off Colombia _ if and when a decision is
made to undertake the effort.
   Another official said on Wednesday that the reports created a
furor because no definite decision had actually been made before
the news reports, and the Colombians believed they had not been
informed.
   ``There are certain political sensitivities. You want to hear
about it directly and not hear about it in the newspapers,'' said
the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The source said consultations with the Colombians over
increasing Navy involvement in drug interdiction were now on a
``back burner,'' although other cooperative antidrug efforts were
still being discussed.
   That includes the Feb. 15 drug summit in Colombia to be attended
by Bush, Barco and the presidents of Peru and Bolivia. A
preliminary meeting to draft communiques and agreements for the
participants to sign is currently going on in Santa Cruz, Bolivia.
   The matter was particularly sensitive for Bush, coming after he
was criticized by Latin American nations for the Dec. 20 invasion
of Panama.
   Officials said reports of further military action off Colombia,
even though part of the antidrug effort, revived concerns about the
U.S. historical heavy-handedness toward its southern neighbors.
   Bush, in his telephone call, ``explained that the U.S. had
intended a cooperative effort with Colombia that could compliment
President Barco's courageous and determined effort to break up the
narcotics cartels and bring traffickers to justice,'' the White
House said.
   The two presidents agreed ``it was most unfortunate that
inaccurate and confusing reports of tentative U.S. proposals for
cooperation with the Colombian government had created such a false
impression,'' Popadiuk said in his statement.
   Barco, according to the statement, told Bush he ``regretted the
erroneous press stories'' and said ``he always knew that President
Bush would never approve actions which impinged on Colombian
sovereignty.''

<HEAD>Naval Observatory Astronomers Search for Theoretical 10th Planet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Astronomers at the U.S. Naval Observatory
are narrowing their solar system search for a 10th planet, a
mysterious, phantom giant that has long captured the speculation
and interest of stargazers.
   Speculation about the existence of another planet evolved
because something, perhaps a massive object orbiting the sun on the
outer edge of the solar system, is giving a gravitational nudge
that disrupts the predicted orbits of Uranus and Neptune, said
astronomer R.S. Harrington.
   ``We are still incapable of predicting the location of Uranus,''
Harrington said Wednesday. ``It's clear something is wrong in the
outer solar system.''
   Astronomers have theorized since the beginning of the century
that some additional planets existed beyond the orbits of Neptune.
The theory sprang from observations that Uranus failed to orbit the
sun with the majestic and mathematical symmetry experts expected.
   That led to a search that resulted in the 1930 discovery of
Pluto, the ninth known planet in the solar system. Further
searching revealed in 1978 that a moon was orbiting Pluto.
   But Harrington said calculations later showed the combined mass
of Pluto and its moon are about 1,000 times too small to account
for the detected, but unexplained irregularity of the Neptune and
Uranus orbits.
   ``Something is there and we've got to look,'' Harrington said.
   Some astronomers have attributed the abnormal orbit of Uranus
and Neptune to errors in calculation.
   However, Harrington said a model of the solar system created by
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which guided the Voyager spacecraft
near both Uranus and Neptune, still is not consistent with recent
observations on the position of Uranus. He said the JPL data seemed
to be in agreement for a time, but new observations show Uranus is
deviating from the expected path.
   ``Our current evidence is that the data is still off,'' he said.
``We still do not understand the outer solar system.''
   A search for Planet X is under way in Washington, the main
office of the Naval Observatory, and at the Black Birch Astrometric
Observatory near Blenheim, New Zealand.
   Harrington said the search has been narrowed using a computer. A
number of theoretical 10-planet solar systems were simulated in a
Naval Observatory computer to determine where Planet X had to be to
produce the effects seen on the orbits of Uranus and Neptune.
   That relatively small area of the heavens will be searched in
April and May by an astrographic telescope at Black Birch. The
telescope will take pictures of the target area on successive
nights and the photos will be sent to Washington for study.
   Harrington said he would use a machine called the blink
comparator to look for the phantom planet. A blink comparator
flashes back and forth between two photo plates, causing an
apparent motion to the observer if any point of light in the twin
photos has changed position from one night to the next.
   Planet X, Harrington said, is thought to be three to five times
larger than Earth and moving in an orbit about three times farther
from the sun than Neptune or Pluto. That would make the phantom
planet about as visible as Pluto, a planet seen only by
sophisticated telescopes.
   A planet in such a distant orbit would take about 1,000 years to
circle the sun.
   Even with the new techniques, Harrington said he was far from
certain that Planet X will be found.
   ``I have no better than a 50-50 confidence level that this thing
is there,'' he said.
   Harrington discussed the Planet X search on the opening day of
the 175th national meeting of the American Astronomical Society.

   American-made jeans once were a principal
currency of the black market in Moscow. Now, Americans can get
``Soviet'' blue jeans in the United States _ for $65 a pair.
   The jeans, on sale since November at some U.S. stores, are
manufactured in Hong Kong and Italy by U.S. and Italian companies.
But there is a Soviet component, said Lucio Dalla Gasperina,
executive vice president of Seattle Pacific Industries, one of the
manufacturers.
   ``It's very Russian,'' Gasperina said. ``It's the concept, the
attitude, the association with the Soviets, the Russian letters.
It's industrial. Utilitarian.''
   Real Soviets do play a role in the product, which was on display
Wednesday at a fashion show at the Red Zone discotheque. Six
freelance designers in Moscow ``suggest'' colors, fabric and
designs, Gasperina said.
   Although they're promoted as ``glasnost glamour'' and their
label bears the word ``Soviet,'' they can't be purchased in Moscow.
   In addition to denim jeans, the Soviet line includes cotton
workshirts, jackets, sweatshirts and T-shirts in black, white, red,
mustard and olive green _ all adorned with Cyrillic letters, red
stars, and industrial trappings like miniature screwdrivers hanging
from belt loops.
   ``Two years ago if we had done this, people would have thrown
rocks through Macy's windows,'' one of the stores that carries the
line, said Gasperina.
   ``Now, all of a sudden, the Soviet Union is OK. They're
accepted. They're a player.''

<HEAD>Governors Attack Cost-Sharing Plan For Cleaning Air</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Governors of three states that have little
pollution are complaining that states with dirty air are trying to
take advantage of subsidies for cleaning up their power plants
while enjoying low electric rates.
   ``They can do like we have ... clean up and still be
economically viable,'' Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich, co-chairman of
the Alliance for Acid Rain Control, said Wednesday.
   The group released a study saying that three-fourths of the 25
utilities targeted for the largest reductions in the first phase of
a cleanup proposed by President Bush had electric rates below the
national average in 1987.
   Sixty percent of the 25 utilities had rates at least 10 percent
below the average and one company's rates were 75 percent below the
average, the group said. Twenty percent had rates above the
average, the highest by a margin of 12 percent.
   The 25 utilities are located in 11 midwestern and southern
states. The study used a composite of industrial, commercial and
residential rates for comparisons.
   The alliance describes itself as a nationwide organization of
governors, academics, environmentalists and business executives.
The governors tend to come from low-polluting states.
   Bush proposed cutting sulfur dioxide emissions, a major cause of
acid rain, by 10 million tons nationwide by the year 2000. This
would represent a reduction of about 43 percent from the estimated
total of more than 23 million tons a year.
   His plan, which is expected to go to the Senate floor later this
month, would force states with the highest emissions to pay the
largest share of the cleanup costs. High-pollution states worried
about a potential loss of jobs want to spread the costs around,
which would result in cleaner states paying more.
   ``We're paying for California and Texas to bail out the S&amp;L's
but they don't want to pay for their share of the sulfur dioxide
emissions in the country,'' said Rep. Philip Sharp, D-Ind., in
response to the study.
   Sharp, whose home state is a major sulfur dioxide polluter, is
chairman of the energy and power subcommittee of the House Energy
and Commerce Committee. The subcommittee is considering a House
version of the president's plan.
   Sulfur dioxide and other emissions turn into acids high in the
atmosphere and can fall as acid rain, fog or snow up to several
hundreds of miles downwind. Environmentalists blame this acidity
for the destruction of aquatic life in lakes and streams and some
say it is responsible for the death of red spruce forests at high
altitudes in the East.
   Cost-sharing plans being advanced in Congress would raise
electric rates $2 a month nationwide, according to the alliance.
   Perpich and the governors of Wisconsin and Wyoming said power
plants in their states had taken extensive steps to reduce sulfur
dioxide emissions.
   The nation's 10 dirtiest power plants produce more than half the
nation's sulfur-dioxide emissions, but they have invested only $2.9
billion in air-pollution controls, less than a fifth of the $16.4
billion spent nationwide, according to the alliance's study.

<HEAD>Approval Withdrawn for Jarvik Device</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Jarvik artificial heart, which once
stirred hope for critically ill heart patients, is being recalled
because of ``serious deficiencies'' with the way the device is
manufactured.
   The Food and Drug Administration withdrew approval for all uses
of the artificial heart in humans because of problems in quality
control, monitoring of research sites, training of workers and
reports of adverse reactions in patients, an agency spokesman said
Wednesday.
   ``The agency felt the deficiencies were great enough that risks
to patients were outweighing benefits,'' said FDA spokesman Jeff
Nesbit.
   Symbion Inc. of Tempe, Ariz., had received FDA approval allowing
its artificial heart to be used experimentally both as a permanent
artificial heart and as a temporary bridge for people awaiting a
human heart transplant.
   Approvals for both uses of the artificial heart were revoked, as
was the company's approval for an acute ventricular assist device.
   The company's designation for its artificial heart formerly
known as the Jarvik-7 is the Symbion J-7. The developer, Dr. Robert
Jarvik, is no longer associated with Symbion.
   While Symbion sold the only approved permanent artificial heart,
other companies have approvals for devices that are used as
temporary bridges.
   The Jarvik-7, made of plastics, fibers and metal, was first used
seven year ago amid much excitement when it was implanted in a
dying heart patient named Barney Clark.
   FDA conducted two inspections of Symbion's facilities last year
and found ``some serious deficiencies,'' Nesbit said. ``Some
aspects of manufacturing quality were found to be poor enough to
endanger patients,'' he said, and that the company had failed to
report unexpected adverse events to the FDA as required.
   He said the agency also found research sites were not being
monitored properly and that servicing of equipment and training of
personnel was inadequate.
   Symbion had received approval to implant its permanent heart in
as many as seven people as part of a continuing experiment.
   Nesbit said the company could discuss the problems with the FDA
and correct them, but he declined to say how likely it was that the
FDA would reconsider its decision.
   The letter was sent to the company on Monday.
   Symbion issued a statement saying it had received the FDA notice
and would ``release further information at the appropriate time.''
   Last week a 57-year-old Missouri woman, who held the record for
living the longest on an artificial heart before receiving a human
heart transplant, died of a heart attack. Carolyn Stadler of St.
Charles had lived 440 days with the artificial heart before
receiving a human heart, her second, last fall.
   There have been only a handful of artificial hearts used in
humans, and recipients have been plagued by clotting and strokes.
   Interest in the artificial heart remains high because experts
believe 20,000 to 75,000 Americans could use a transplant, but
there are not enough donors. In 1988, there were 1,630 transplants
in the United States.

<HEAD>Study: Women Get More Kick From Alcohol Than Men Do</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drink for drink, women get drunker than men. Now
scientists believe they know why: Men have more stomach for booze.
   A study published today found that men typically make higher
amounts of a substance that breaks down alcohol in the stomach
before it reaches the bloodstream. As a result, men feel fewer
effects of alcohol, even when men and women the same size drink the
same amount.
   ``I am convinced that there are sex differences in handling
alcohol,'' commented Dr. Judith Gavaler of the University of
Pittsburgh. ``This is a very important study for all of us doing
research in alcohol. This will change the way we approach this
subject.''
   Researchers said the study also underscores concerns about
drinking during pregnancy, provides an explanation on the effects
of drinking on an empty stomach and could be used to help set safe
drinking levels for men and women.
   ``The implication of this is that when it comes to social
drinking, women should be more careful than men for a given amount
of alcohol when driving or operating equipment,'' said Dr. Charles
S. Lieber, a co-author of the study.
   Lieber, director of the Alcohol Research and Treatment Center at
the Bronx Veterans Affairs Medical Center, said the findings also
help explain why women alcoholics are especially prone to liver
disease.
   The study, conducted on 20 men and 23 women, was directed by Dr.
Mario Frezza of the University School of Medicine in Trieste,
Italy, and published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
   It found that women absorb about one-third more alcohol into
their blood than men do. The researchers believe this is largely
explained by the fact that non-alcoholic women produce about 30
percent less of the protective substance than non-alcoholic men do.
   Heavy drinking seems to hinder the body's ability to make the
substance, an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase. While alcoholic
men produce less than social drinkers, the difference was most
dramatic in alcoholic women. They make virtually none.
   ``In alcoholic women, there is for all practical purposes no
gastric protection anymore,'' said Lieber. ``Therefore, when an
alcoholic woman drinks alcohol, she has the same blood level as
when she is given that amount of alcohol intravenously. This may
explain what is already known _ that womenare much more susceptible
than men to alcoholic liver disease.''
   In an accompanying editorial, Drs. Steven Schenker and K.
Vincent Speeg of the University of Texas at San Antonio called the
results ``exciting.'' They said the theory may explain, at least in
part, the higher risk in women of harmful effects of alcohol.
   Another researcher, Dr. David Van Theil of the University of
Pittsburgh, agreed: ``I think it's an important observation that
suggests that alcohol metabolism in the stomach is different
between men and women and as a result there are differences in
potential toxicity for men and women.''
   The study also gives an explanation for another bit of popular
drinking wisdom: why people feel fewer effects of alcohol if they
drink on a full stomach.
   If they drink when their bellies are empty, the alcohol passes
quickly through the stomach into the small intestine, where it is
absorbed into the bloodstream. However, when the stomach is full,
alcohol stays in the stomach longer, so the enzyme has more time to
work on it.
   Dr. Domenic Ciraulo of New England Medical Center said the
findings also underscore concerns about drinking durring pregnancy.
The findings suggest that the amount of alcohol reaching the fetus
may be higher than previously thought.
   ``Even at low levels, alcohol may not be safe at all,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia are
discussing a proposal to link, in a free-market arrangement,
economies long stifled by Communist controls and lack of access to
Western markets and capital.
   The plan to create an independent trade bloc of the three
countries that are peacefully casting off one-party Communist rule
is still tentative _ and there are formidable barriers.
   First, they must redefine their membership in the Soviet-led
trading organization, Comecon, which is now grappling with a
complete overhaul.
   Comecon could by 1991 be trading in hard currency and at world
market prices, abandoning trade relationships that ignored free
market mechanisms and were based on the non-convertible Soviet
ruble.
   Planning officials from Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia used
this week's Comecon summit in Sofia for first consultations
Wednesday on their plan for closer integration.
   They kept mum about results. But officials from all three
countries, aware of the looming potential of a confederated East
and West Germany, have openly advocated closer cooperation among
Comecon countries of a similar size and economic development.
   Hungarian Deputy Premier Peter Medgyessy envisions integration
of the Hungarian, Polish and Czechoslovak economies beginning with
a free trade agreement, followed by joint trade policy decisions,
free flow of capital and labor, harmonized financial systems and a
convertible accounting unit.
   ``Hungary was once a lonely long-distance runner in its
criticisms of Comecon, but we have become more numerous,'' he told
a news conference Tuesday.
   ``We think in the same way,'' he said of the three countries.
Czechoslovakia and Hungary boast two of the more successful
economies in Eastern Europe, and Poland has become a pioneer in
free-market reforms.
   Poland's Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Eastern Europe's only non-Communist
premier, spoke of ``trying new solutions'' in his Sofia speech to
the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance _ as Comecon is formally
known.
   A ``smaller group of countries'' could form an ``economic
laboratory'' to test the free-market reforms and economic
integration, he suggested.
   Both are sorely needed by the bloc's stagnant, centrally-planned
economies, badly ailing 41 years after Comecon was created by Josef
Stalin as a means for exploiting Soviet client states and keeping
them in the fold.
   Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary backed each other solidly in
Sofia, according to delegates to the closed-door meetings.
   While delegates from other countries agreed only that the bloc
wasn't working and needed an overhaul, the three put forward
concrete proposals.
   Czechoslovakia said before the Sofia summit that Comecon faced
extinction if it didn't adopt reforms, and promptly presented a
draft of new rules to members for approval.
   Countering a Soviet proposal that Comecon's own executive
committee should discuss changes, Poland recommended an ad-hoc
commission of two members from each delegation.
   The suggestion was accepted. But it's unclear whether the
commission will make decisions within two to three months and
swiftly present them to another summit. Comecon agreed only that
its next summit will take place in Budapest, but rejected Prague's
push for a promise it would convene before June.
   Close cooperation between Budapest, Prague and Warsaw _ the
latter have already worked out a new exchange agreement for their
own trade _ could leave less-developed Comecon members, and even
the Soviet Union, far behind in the economic race.
   Members of East Germany's delegation in Sofia said Comecon
reforms should not be detrimental to any members. For years, East
Berlin has profited from special trade and credit lines to West
Germany, advantages not enjoyed by any other Comecon member.
   But Romania, Bulgaria and non-European Comecon members Cuba,
Mongolia and Vietnam could miss the reform train because they're
unable, or unwilling, to make radical advances.
   ``Romania couldn't possibly have any reservations concerning the
desire of two or three countries to organize such a circle,'' said
Lilian Poida, a Comecon delegate from Romania, whose people ousted
and executed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu just last month.
   ``We are no longer dependent on ideology or constrained by
economic models and welcome any move to stimulate trade,'' she said.
   But she couldn't say how Romania would react if such a system
were implemented in the near future, as Romania's impoverished
economy will not be able to liberalize soon and could get left
behind.
   Emerging from Communist central planning and dependence on the
Soviet Union will not be easy for the three pioneers either. They
are well aware that four decades of squashed initiative,
discouraged productivity, skewed production, and drained hard
currency reserves are a powerful brake on progress.
   ``Reasonable cooperation can only start with stable economies,''
said Vladimir Dlouhy, Czechoslovak deputy prime minister.
   ``We will have to think carefully before entering into close
cooperation with a country that has triple-digit inflation,'' he
said, referring to Poland.
   Also, Poland and Hungary together owe at least $50 billion to
foreign creditors. Czechoslovakia's foreign debt, by contrast, is
much more modest, at around $7 billion.
   Medgyessy suggested that one way around the problem could be
help from the World Bank or International Monetary Fund.
   But it's not clear whether Czechoslovakia would risk its
potentially good credit rating with these institutions _ where it
is applying for membership _ for the sake of cooperation with
Poland and Hungary.

   Constanta Palulescu patted her blue
shopping bag and said with a delighted smile, ``I have bought meat
from Holland.''
   Ms. Palulescu and other Romanians are discovering nearly three
weeks after the revolution that toppled dictator Nicolae Ceausescu
that daily life has been changed by simple things like good
imported meat, oranges and bananas, heat in their homes and
newspapers that actually contain news.
   That does not mean Bucharest has become a consumer's paradise.
People have to stand in line to buy many items, including bread,
meat, cigarettes and newspapers.
   In the city's Dristor sector, a neighborhood of endless rows of
10-story concrete apartment buildings, a clerk in an appliance
store wore a scarf over her ears and a fur hat to ward off the
chill inside the store.
   But Elena Lazerecu, a worker in the Romanian mint, said the
government was turning up the heat in homes, which often were
iceboxes under Ceausescu and his harsh economic policies.
   ``We have a bit of heating, a bit of hot water and happiness,''
said Mrs. Lazerecu, a 34-year-old mother of two.She also noted that
although there were still lines at stores, they were shorter and
shoppers did not have to present ration cards for sugar and cooking
oil.
   ``You just have to wait a half hour or three-quarters of an hour
in line. It's a lot less,'' she said.
   Her husband, Dimitri, a 39-year-old mechanic, said he expected a
big change in his life from the provisional government's promise to
shorten the work week from six to five days.
   ``I will have time to be with my family, to take a walk,'' he
said.
   Laura Apostolou, a curly-haired 16-year-old, said she thought
the most important change since Ceausescu's regime was overthrown
Dec. 22 was in what Romanians had learned about their country.
   ``In the press, television, radio, everything is more open,''
she said.
   Holding a newspaper in her hand, Miss Apostolou noted that
before the revolt few people read the government-run papers. Now,
many wait in line to buy them.
   ``Under Ceausescu we had lines for meat. Now we have lines for
newspapers,'' she said.
   Miss Apostolou, who hopes to become an economist, said she also
expected changes in her high school classes.
   ``We used to study a lot of Marxism,'' she said. ``In history,
we had to study whatever Congresses he held.''
   Miss Apostolou and many Romanians say ``he,'' or ``him'' to
refer to Ceausescu, who was executed Christmas Day along with his
wife, Elena, for ``grave crimes'' including genocide.
   For many, the taste of freedom has only raised expectations for
more openness.
   In Dristor, on icy sidewalks below the bulky concrete apartment
buildings, people talk about their hopes to be able to travel
abroad freely, to have foreign magazines and newspapers.
   Under Ceausescu, it was illegal to bring a radio into Romania.
Typewriters had to be registered so authorities could track any
dissident writings. People's passports were kept by the police, who
had to be informed months in advance by anyone wishing to travel
abroad.
   Caution and skepticism remain from the 24 years of Ceausescu's
reign.
   Romanians are excited to see the first oranges and bananas in
their stores in years, but they worry that the small pleasures they
have so quickly become accustomed to will disappear.
   Ms. Palulescu, so happy with her purchase of imported meat, said
she hopes her countrymen do not expect too much too soon in
economic improvements.
   ``We can't change everything overnight. It's normal to have a
gradual change. We have to have the necessary understanding to let
time pass,'' said the 63-year-old retired economist, who had worked
for the city government.
   She said Romanians will have to work very hard if they want a
free and prosperous land. She would be willing to come out of
retirement if she were needed, Ms. Palulescu said.
   ``I would not have said that a month ago,'' she added.

<HEAD>Early Lead Exposure Causes Permanent Learning Disability</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The effects of brain damage caused by childhood
lead exposure linger into adulthood and may be an important reason
why teen-agers have trouble in school, researchers report today.
   The 11-year study, which followed a group of Massachusetts
students through their school years, found that those who had been
exposed to lead early in life have trouble reading and finishing
high school.
   While other studies have shown that lead causes mental
impairment in childhood, the latest work demonstrates that
youngsters fail to outgrow these problems.
   ``We think this study, the longest followup on record, shows
that the effects of lead are permanent and are reflected in
real-life success,'' said Dr. Herbert L. Needleman of the
University of Pittsburgh.
   ``For young adults, their main task is getting an education.
This study shows that they have a seven times higher rate of not
graduating from high school and a six times higher rate of reading
disability'' after early childhood lead exposure.
   Exposure to lead, which now comes mainly from old paint and
water pipes, also was linked with low grades, poor coordination and
high absenteeism, among other problems, during the teen-age years.
   ``What it means to me,'' Needleman said, ``is that a pretty
sizable percentage of school failure in young adults is related to
early lead exposure.''
   Needleman's study, published in the New England Journal of
Medicine, began with measurements of the lead content of baby teeth
shed by 132 first- and second-graders in Chelsea and Somerville.
They were tested in the first and fifth grades and when they
reached age 19.
   Childhood exposure to lead has fallen sharply since the early
1970s, when the subjects were babies. The improvement has resulted
largely from the introduction of unleaded gasoline and from removal
of lead-based paint in houses.
   ``I think in part, these data serve as confirmation of the
wisdom of some of the public health measures taken in the past few
years to reduce community exposure to lead,'' said co-author Dr.
David Bellinger of Children's Hospital in Boston. ``They serve as
an indication that we should continue in those efforts.''
   In the study, doctors compared the behavior and school records
of those with high or low levels of exposure. Those with high
exposure were estimated to have had average blood levels of 34
micrograms per deciliter. At the time, levels above 30 micrograms
per deciliter were considered hazardous.
   Scientists now believe that lead levels are elevated when they
exceed 10 to 15 micrograms. The Agency for Toxic Substances and
Disease Registry estimates that 3 million to 4 million American
children have at least this much lead in their bodies.
   Lead harms the brain by interferring with the normal growth and
development of the central nervous system.
   Despite their school problems, the youngsters with highest lead
exposure were not considered retarded, and appeared normal.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index rebounded
sharply in Thursday's afternoon session, while the dollar fell
slightly against the Japanese yen.
   The U.S. currency closed at 145.27 yen, down 0.03 yen from
Wednesday's close of 145.30 yen. It opened at 145.23 yen and ranged
between 145.10 yen and 145.50 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average regained a hefty 473.62
points, or 1.26 percent, ending the day at 38,170.13.
   Thursday's gain was the largest single-day increase since Oct.
17, when the index rebounded 527.39 points from following a huge
loss that stemmed from the Oct. 13 mini-crash on the New York stock
market.
   The Nikkei recovered in the afternoon as market players' spirits
were buoyed by a rumor that the Soviet Union may agree to return
four disputed islands that Japan claims as its northernmost
territories, said a dealer with Nomura Securities, Co., speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The rumor had it that a resolution to the long-standing dispute
could be reached in talks slated for Monday between Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and former foreign minister Shintaro Abe.
   In currency trading, the dollar-yen rate shifted little after a
surge in the dollar earlier this week. Sentiment for the dollar
remained bullish, but market players were reluctant to push the
U.S. unit higher for fear of another central bank intervention,
said Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan
Securities Co.
   The Bank of Japan has actively sold dollars in the two days to
support the yen.
   Market rumors that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York sold the
dollar for yen Wednesday, and news of t the resignation of the
executive vice president and chief financial officer of Campeau
Corp. and its retailing units, Federated Department Stores and
Allied, also deepened the market's wait-and-see mood, Kanai said.
   ``But the dollar is basically strong, as buying of the (West
German) mark has slowed and the yen isn't attracting anybody,''
Kanai said.

<HEAD>Baker Expresses Impatience Over Inaction on Mideast Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An apparently impatient Secretary of State
James A. Baker III is telling Arabs and Israelis that other areas
of the world are clamoring for his attention while they bicker
about opening Mideast peace talks.
   The statement, issued through spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler,
appeared to be a veiled warning to the two sides to come to terms
on holding talks here or risk losing U.S. help in mediating their
dispute.
   Baker hopes to bring the Israeli and Egyptian foreign ministers
to Washington soon to discuss holding an election among Palestinian
Arabs on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   But sparring over whether the Palestine Liberation Organization
should have a role has delayed the setting of a date.
   ``There are many other areas in the world clamoring for his
attention, areas where the circumstances are producing change,''
Tutwiler said. ``We hope to see the same kind of impulse that will
produce change in the Middle East and we're prepared to do all we
can to promote it.''
   Earlier, Baker talked on the telephone with Israeli Foreign
Minister Moshe Arens. On Monday he spoke with Egyptian Foreign
Minister Esmat Abdel Meguid.

   On the same day he went from being general

Time Warner Inc., Philip R. Lochner Jr., was nominated by President
Bush for a spot on the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Wednesday's nomination to a post on the federal agency that
regulates the nation's stock and bonds markets is subject to
confirmation by the Senate.
   ``Phil Lochner has an excellent resume. He appears to have the
potential to make an outstanding SEC commissioner,'' said Sen.
Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee that will question the nominee at a confirmation hearing.
   Lochner had been general counsel of Time Inc. before the merger

   Reached at Time Warner's New York office, Lochner declined to

<HEAD>Banking Committee Staff Chief Leaving</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The staff director of the Senate Banking
Committee is announcing his departure less than a month after
consumer advocate Ralph Nader demanded his resignation, but Kevin
Gottlieb says the timing is coincidental.
   Gottlieb said Wednesday his decision to leave had ``not the
slightest'' connection with Nader's criticism of him for accepting
$85,000 in consulting fees from the American Bankers Association
prior to joining the Banking Committee staff.
   ``We've got a natural break period between the first session of
the 101st Congress and the second session,'' he said. ``It's the
time to make a move.''
   Gottlieb, 47, will step aside March 1 and be replaced by
committee general counsel Steve Harris, said Sen. Donald Riegle,
D-Mich., the panel's chairman.
   Gottlieb said he had done nothing wrong. He said the Senate
Ethics Committee, at his request, was reviewing how he listed his
outside income on financial statements.
   When he became staff director last year, Gottlieb said, it was
with the understanding that he would remain only until Congress
enacted the savings and loan reform bill that became law in August.
   He said he stayed longer than expected because Riegle asked him
to direct the establishment of oversight mechanisms and plan the
committee's 1990 agenda.
   Gottlieb, an adjunct professor at Michigan State University,
said he had worked with the Senate for most of the past 12 years
and was ready to return to teaching and his Washington-based policy
analysis company.

   Three bombs exploded on the Oakland

   No injuries were reported and no threats were received before
Wednesday's explosions.
   No suspects nor motive were known, said Jim Llewellyn, spokesman
for the 12,000-student school about 30 miles north of Detroit.
   Llewellyn said the university would remain closed today while
the investigation continued.
   The first explosion occurred about 5:15 p.m. on the fourth floor
of the Kresge Library, Llewellyn said. Several books were damaged,
but there was no fire and several students on the floor escaped, he
said.
   About the same time, an explosion in the library parking lot
damaged a parked car, Llewellyn said. About 7 p.m., a bomb exploded
in the parking lot but caused no known damage, he said.
   State police investigators were at the scene Wednesday night.

<DATELINE>PIERRE, S.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The brief item in the Nov. 30 city police
log read: ``Forcible rape no weapon Governor's mansion. Four boys
at mansion raped her.''
   Six weeks later, what happened at the home of Gov. George
Mickelson remains a mystery, but the investigation has become a
major topic of discussion throughout this sparsely populated farm
state.
   Police and court officials, citing a state law that keeps names
and charges against juveniles secret, have refused to discuss their
investigation into the alleged drinking party among a small group
of teen-agers at the mansion on the night of Nov. 28.
   Mickelson has limited his comment to saying the probe is a
private matter.
   The special prosecutor in the case says delinquency petitions
have been filed against three juveniles, but he won't say who they
are or what laws they allegedly violated.
   An 18-year-old, David Ebach, has been charged as an adult with
underage drinking but has yet to appear for a hearing. Ebach,
starting quarterback on Pierre's high school football team, is a
friend of the governor's 17-year-old son, David.
   Despite the secrecy, rumors and hints about the investigation
dominate conversation in the capital city of 12,000 people and
across the state of 700,000. Many Pierre residents know who was at
the mansion.
   A source close to the investigation said a small group of high
school students, including the young Mickelson, were drinking at
the mansion while the governor was in Washington, D.C., attending a
U.S. Department of Agriculture conference, and his wife, Linda, was
in Texas on vacation.
   David Mickelson is the only other permanent resident of the
gray, two-story house across a pond from the Capitol.
   A school official has confirmed that the alleged rape victim is
a high school student in Fort Pierre, a small town across the
Missouri River.
   Mickelson, a Republican, has refused to disclose his son's
whereabouts on the night of the reported rape or to discuss David's
possible involvement.
   On Dec. 13, two days after the first news report about the
allegation, Mickelson and his wife issued a brief statement:
   ``Our family is going through one of the most agonizing times we
have ever experienced. We have always held closely to the principle
that it is not how you fall that counts the most, but how you get
up and carry on.''
   The story has been on front pages across the state ever since,
but what details have emerged are sketchy. A hearing for the
juveniles will begin Jan. 22 with arguments on a defense motion to
keep the proceedings secret. Several news organizations oppose the
motion.
   Republican politicians have understandably refrained from
speaking about the case, but minority Democrats also have been
restrained.
   The issue won't alter work in the legislative session that began
this week, said Senate Minority Leader Roger McKellips. He said of
the governor, ``I respect the way he's handled it.''
   The county prosecutor and local judges bowed out of the case,
which was turned over to Special Prosecutor Craig Kennedy, a
Democrat from a county 220 miles away.
   Circuit Judge Marshall Young of Rapid City, who was named by the
state Supreme Court to hear the juvenile cases, is a former
president of the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court
Judges and is considered an expert on juvenile law.
   Sentencing for juveniles in the state can range from probation
to confinement in the state reform school until age 21. In the case
of the most serious crimes the prosecutor could ask to have the
juvenile tried as an adult.
   Mickelson, who took office in 1987 and is expected to run for
re-election this year, is a lawyer and former speaker of the state
House whose father George T. Mickelson, served as governor from
1946-1950. The current governor was 5 years old when his family
first lived in the mansion.

<HEAD>Panama Resists Pressure to Change Bank Laws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new government is resisting U.S.
pressure to change banking secrecy laws to prevent drug traffickers
from laundering their ill-gotten profits.
   On Wednesday, the two countries signed an accord on fighting
drug trafficking, which U.S. officials say ousted dictator Manuel
Antonio Noriega allowed to flourish while he ruled.
   But Panamanian officials balked at altering banking laws that
have made their country an international banking center.
   ``They want us to simply open our books and we cannot let them
do that,'' Eduardo Lasso Valdez, president of the Bankers
Association, told The Associated Press.
   Noriega, overthrown in last month's U.S. invasion, is imprisoned
in Miami awaiting trial on drug charges that include laundering
drug money. The new government is led by men elected in May
balloting that Noriega nullified.
   The drug-fighting agreement covers U.S. assistance to help
Panama structure its agencies to fight drug trafficking; exchange
information; investigate and prosecute laundering drug profits; and
destroy drug crops, processing sites and laboratories.
   The agreement was signed by Ramon Lima, vice minister of
government and justice, and Melvin Levitsky, U.S. assistant
secretary of state for international narcotics matters.
   Levitsky said he would recommend that President Bush certify
Panama as a nation committed to fighting the drug trade, a step
that would enable Panama to get special consideration in trade and
assistance.
   But the two countries remain at odds over the issue of drug
money laundering.
   Panamanian bankers insist drug money laundering has never been a
problem. The international banking center, with more than 101
banks, is patterned after that of Switzerland, providing coded
accounts and protecting confidentiality.
   ``Anything we do to affect confidentiality of the system would
destroy the banking center,'' Lasso said. ``We think we have enough
safeguards now to prevent money laundering.''
   Levitsky disagreed. ``Money laundering was an important aspect
of drug trafficking through Panama'' under Noriega, he said.
   Panamanian banks limit to $50,000 the amount of cash that an
individual may deposit at one time, and bankers say claims of money
laundering here were exaggerated.
   One bank's license was revoked five years ago. Another bank
agreed to pay a $5 million fine following U.S. charges it took part
in money laundering by accepting large transfers from a U.S. bank.
   In other developments Wednesday, the head of immigration under
Noriega left the Vatican embassy Wednesday and gave up to U.S.
troops.
   Belgica de Castillo left of her own accord along with her
husband, Carlos Castillo, said the Rev. Joseph Spiteri.
   Panama's new government has said eight former immigration
officials, including Mrs. Castillo, were being charged with
corruption for selling visas and passports.
   The Castillos sought refuge shortly after the U.S. invasion on
Dec. 20. Noriega himself was in the embassy for 10 days until his
Jan. 3 surrender.
   Foreign Minister Julio Linares said Panamanians linked to
Noriega have taken refuge in the embassies of Bolivia, Ecuador,
Peru, Cuba and the Vatican. All but the Bolivian mission are
surrounded by U.S. troops.
   Two of the 12 Panamanians in the Peruvian Embassy were suspects
in the killing of Maj. Moises Giroldi, who led an unsuccessful coup
attempt against Noriega on Oct. 3, said Attorney General Rogelio
Cruz.
   He did not identify them but said Panama would tell Peru they do
not qualify for asylum since they ``are not being persecuted
politically.''
   Noriega's family is in the Cuban Embassy. Linares said Panama
was considering their request for safe conduct to the Dominican
Republic but must first decide whether they can be charged with any
offenses.
   The head of Noriega's personal security force, Capt. Eliezer
Gaytan, was still inside the Vatican embassy.

<HEAD>Investigators Continue Search for Motive In Stuart Murder</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From the beginning, the stunning disclosure a week
ago today that Charles Stuart had committed suicide after becoming
the prime suspect in his pregnant wife's slaying seemed to demand a
grand motive.
   But drugs are out, and adultery and the theory that another man
fathered the child are waning. Money is now the focus.
   These are the major pieces of the puzzle:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE SETUP</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The drama began Oct. 23 with Stuart's frantic call on a car
phone to a police dispatcher, saying he and his wife had been shot.
   Stuart says he and his wife had left a hospital childbirth
class. The transcript of the call grabs the nation's attention.
   Stuart's 30-year-old wife, Carol, dies within hours. At her
funeral, attended by Gov. Michael Dukakis and Mayor Raymond Flynn,
an emotional, loving letter from Stuart is read.
   Seventeen days after the shooting, the baby dies, Stuart by his
side.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE HOAX</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Stuart tells police he and his wife were attacked by a black man
who forced his way into their car.
   Police, using Stuart's description, comb the inner-city Mission
Hill neighborhood where the shooting occurred. In November, news
reports say William ``Willie'' Bennett, a black resident with a
long criminal record, has been identified as a prime suspect. In
December, Stuart reportedly picks Bennett out of a lineup. Bennett
is later cleared.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE LAST NIGHT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Two convenience store clerks near the Braintree hotel where
Stuart stayed the night before his apparent suicide said he came in
about 2 a.m., bought some items and seemed troubled.
   ``He had a kind of psycho look in his eyes, and he was grinning
from ear to ear. It was a face you wouldn't forget,'' said Stephen
Newcomb, 38, of Braintree. ``He was very freaky _ you know, like
when you look in someone's eyes and you can just tell something's
wrong. He was very up, very bubbly and very friendly, but very
weird.''
   ``In all honesty, he didn't look like he had it all together,''
said John Pemberton, 20, of Randolph.
   Stuart checked into the Sheraton-Tara Hotel before midnight Jan.
3. A clerk said Stuart registered under his own name and used his
credit card to pay for the bill. A concierge said Stuart asked for,
and got, a wake-up call at 4:30 a.m.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE COVERUP</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Unknown to investigators, Stuart told his younger brother,
Matthew, to come to the killing scene. Matthew Stuart later tells
authorities his brother passed him Mrs. Stuart's handbag,
containing several personal items and a pistol. The gun and the bag
are thrown separately into the Pines River in suburban Revere.
   Matthew Stuart told other family members and friends what he
knew. Transcripts of phone conversations at the Revere Fire
Department, where another brother, Michael Stuart, is a
firefighter, indicate that Michael Stuart, his wife and a sister
knew before last week's revelations that Charles Stuart was
involved in the crime. Another sister and Stuart's parents
apparently did not know.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE SCHEME CRUMBLES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   As the weeks progress, rumors start circulating about Charles
Stuart's involvement.
   On Jan. 2, Stuart meets his attorney for the last time.
   The next day, Matthew Stuart tells investigators of his role,
but says he didn't know Carol Stuart had been slain or that his
brother had been shot when he went to the scene.
   District Attorney Newman Flanagan instructs officers to arrest
Charles Stuart. On the morning of Jan. 4, Charles Stuart, 30, jumps
into Boston Harbor, killing himself.
   Divers recover Mrs. Stuart's handbag the same day. Five days
later, they find a .38-caliber nickel-plated, snub-nose revolver
recently reported stolen from the fur shop where Stuart worked.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE AFTERMATH</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In the hectic days following Stuart's suicide, prosecutors order
a crackdown, their sensitivities heightened by anger in the black
community over the handling of Bennett as a suspect. Sources
provide information that often proves to be off the mark.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DRUGS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Investigators dispute reports drugs were involved, and an
autopsy shows no illegal drugs in Charles Stuart's system. A
physician who treated him knocks down reports that he was treated
for cocaine addiction.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ANOTHER WOMAN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   After Stuart's suicide, rumors abound about his relationship
with a 22-year-old woman who worked at the fur store. The young
woman's attorney denies she had a romantic relationship with Stuart.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE BABY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Authorities investigate whether the Stuart baby might have had a
different father. But the theory is downplayed after preliminary
tests show the boy and Charles Stuart had the same blood type.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MONEY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A final motive, money, is checked on several fronts. Rumors that
Stuart stole furs from the store where he worked are discounted by
the store owner.
   The Boston Globe reported Wednesday that Stuart may have been
looking to open a restaurant.
   An unidentified friend of Stuart's, interviewed Wednesday on
WCVB-TV, says Stuart told him he wanted to kill his pregnant wife
because he was worried the baby would thwart his plan to open the
restaurant: ``The pregnancy was an unwanted thing.''
   The Boston Herald says it obtained a credit risk profile of
Stuart that said he had ``excessive credit obligations ... (and)
excessive delinquent credit obligations.''
   It also comes out that Stuart collected $82,000 from an
insurance policy on his wife, and had another policy on Mrs. Stuart
for $100,000 that was being processed when he committed suicide.
But a report that he also was due to receive $480,000 from another
policy is denied by the company named as the provider.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index, ending a
five-day decline, rose sharply today on a Soviet-related rumor and
easier margin conditions, while the dollar fell slightly against
the Japanese yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average, which had declined more than
1,200 points so far this year, fell another 87.86 points this
morning.
   But it ended up with a 473.62-point gain for the day, the
biggest one-day climb since the 527.39-point rebound Oct. 17 after
New York's minor crash. It closed at 38,170.13.
   Massive buy orders in Tokyo's afternoon session came amid a
rumor that the Soviet Union might agree to return four disputed
islands seized from Japan at the end of World War II, said a dealer
with Nomura Securities Co., speaking on condition of anonymity.
   So far, the Soviet Union has been adamant about keeping the
islands.
   ``Soviet-related rumors like this are likely to keep influencing
the market this year,'' the dealer said. ``That's partly because
economic fundamentals are unlikely to change here. Especially,
there is little chance for interest rates to be lowered.'' Lower
interest rates tend to encourage stock investment.
   Also today, in a step to encourage buying and rejuvenate the
market, the Tokyo Stock Exchange eased margin trading requirements
by starting to assess securities used as collateral at 60 percent
of their real value rather than the previous 50 percent.
   Trading was moderate, with first section volume estimated at 600
million shares, up from Wednesday's 500 million. Trading house and
electric power plant issues attracted buyers.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 145.27 yen, down 0.03
yen from Wednesday's close of 145.30 yen. It opened at 145.23 yen
and ranged between 145.10 yen and 145.50 yen.
   Trading was quiet in the absence of market-affecting news, said
Masafumi Koyama, a trader with the Bank of Tokyo.
   Some $7.16 billion changed hands in spot trading, down from the
previous day's $10.2 billion.
   Although market players expected the dollar to remain strong,
they were reluctant to push it higher because of rumors that the
U.S. Federal Reserve had sold dollars overnight to check the
American currency's rise, he said.
   Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan Securities
Co., said participants' fear of further Japanese central bank
intervention in support of the yen also made them reluctant to buy
more dollars.
   The Bank of Japan has been actively selling dollars in recent
days.

   Vice President Dan Quayle has cautioned
Japan's top trade official against a go-it-alone policy of
regularizing trade and loans with China.
   Beijing's easing of martial law is a positive development but
normalcy has not yet been restored after last summer's bloody
crackdown on democracy demonstrations, Quayle told Hikaru Matsunaga
on Wednesday, according to Japanese Embassy spokesman Noriyuki
Shikata.
   The Japanese minister of international trade and industry
planned today to describe to administration economic officials
Japan's new program of import incentives to ease its huge trade
surplus and become an ``import superpower,'' a goal voiced to
President Bush here last year by visiting Prime Minister Toshiki
Kaifu.
   Quayle was said to have told Matsunaga more action is needed by
China to ease repression and this requires that the United States,
Japan and outside countries coordinate their China policies.
   Quayle said that the more countries cooperate on China, ``the
more positive action can be expected from the Chinese,'' Shikata
said.
   This cooperation should include a common policy on resuming
multimillion dollar World Bank credits to China, cut off after the
midyear upheaval there, Quayle was quoted by both U.S. and Japanese
officials as saying.
   Bush continues to stand for free trade as opposed to managed
trade and import quotas with Japan urged by some in Congress,
Matsunaga was told during an hour-long meeting with Michael Boskin,
chairman of the president's council of economic advisers.
Protectionist sentiment can be expected, however, when the U.S.
trade deficit eases with Europe but not with Japan, Shikata said
Boskin told Matsunaga.
   While the Bush administration appreciates the tax incentives and
tariff cuts of the ``import superpower'' program, U.S. officials
continue to feel Japan needs major structural changes in its system
of business and distribution favoring established domestic
producers, Boskin was quoted as saying.
   For its part, he added, the United States is trying to make some
of the changes urged by Japan at the two countries' ongoing
structural talks. These include boosting the low U.S. savings rate,
reducing the budget deficit and improving the educational system,
Shikata quoted him as saying.
   Matsunaga told Quayle and Boskin the structural talks would
resume after Japan's parliamentary elections in February. The
minister said he is optimistic Kaifu's Liberal Democratic Party
would retain its lower house majority, said an administration
official who insisted on anonymity.
   The minister planned to leave Friday for Tokyo after meetings
Thursday with Secretary of State James Baker III, Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills,
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Environment
Protection Administrator William Reilly.

   Last week, Stuart committed suicide after he was implicated by

   Design flaws left a school cafeteria wall
too weak to withstand a windstorm that toppled it onto dozens of
children two months ago, killing nine, a state report concluded.
   The report said the state's school districts must take a closer
look at their building designs and at how they warn schools about
approaching bad weather.
   ``We are determined to learn whatever we can from this awful
experience,'' state Education Commissioner Thomas Sobol said
following Wednesday's release of the report by the state's Disaster
Preparedness Commission on the Nov. 16 collapse at East Coldenham
Elementary School in Newburgh.
   Sobol said he will push for a new state law requiring periodic
inspections of schools and will toughen the Education Department's
reviews of new school construction.
   The storm struck the school with 100 mph winds, blowing down a
55-foot-long by 25-foot-high wall consisting of a masonry structure
surrounded by a series of metal-framed windows.
   Nine children who were eating lunch were killed in the hail of
brick, concrete and glass. Fifteen students were injured.
   ``This wall, unfortunately, was not adequately designed,'' said
Richard Tomasetti, an engineer hired by the state to investigate.
   Tomasetti said the masonry was not supported by lateral or
vertical bracing and was not tested for strength. When the school
was built in 1959, a state building code requiring such bracing did
not apply to schools; it now does.
   The state's Office of Professional Discipline is investigating
the school's architect, John Clark of Hyde Park, Sobol said.
   Clark was not in his office Wednesday afternoon and was
unavailable for comment. He repeatedly has refused to respond to
reporters' questions since the disaster.
   A lawyer for six of the dead children and 13 of the injured
youngsters has filed a notice of claim that he intends to sue Clark
and the Valley Central School District. He said the report helps
the families' cases.
   ``This is not an act of God,'' lawyer Howard Finkelstein said.
``God did not build the wall. There are human failings that took
place for which someone is going to be responsible.''
   David Worby, attorney for the Valley Central School District,
said criticism of the district was unjustified. He said state
officials approved the construction and never let the district know
it was unsafe.
   ``We, the school, are teachers. We are not builders, or
architects or engineers or state inspectors. We are in that school
teaching. If there was a problem and a danger and we were supposed
to be warned, we were not,'' he said.
   The National Weather Service termed the storm a tornado. Weather
experts hired by the state concluded that it was a ``strong
downburst'' of wind. The commission chairman, Dr. David Axelrod,
said the damaging effect of the winds was the same regardless of
the type of storm.
   He said weather warnings had been conveyed to local school
districts through both the state police and state education
officials, but none reached the school.
   Axelrod also said there is some question what effect the
warnings would have had. He said school officials might have sent
more students to the cafeteria under the mistaken impression it was
safe.

<HEAD>Khmer Rouge Claims New Attacks, ``Liberated Villages''</HEAD>

   Khmer Rouge guerrillas claimed today
that they launched new attacks and seized villages near Cambodia's
second-largest town after shelling it last week.
   Khmer Rouge army radio said that after smashing strategic
government positions near Battambang on Friday and Saturday, the
guerrillas continued attacks along the Sangke River in the ``east
Battambang town battlefield.''
   It claimed the guerrillas ``liberated'' 38 villages, killed or
wounded government soldiers and ``freed'' 65 commune and village
officials.
   Another broadcast said that on Sunday and Tuesday guerrillas
attacked a six-mile stretch from Varin to Sre Noy in Siem Reap
province, which borders Battambang province.
   The reports could not be verified and previous such claims have
proved exaggerated.
   The Khmer Rouge is the largest of three guerrilla groups
fighting the Vietnam-installed government. Its recent advances have
spread fears of a return to power of the group that massacred
Cambodians during its 3{-year rule of terror and famine before
Vietnam invaded in late 1978.
   A Phnom Penh newspaper editor who has close contacts with the
government said Wednesday that fighting in the Battambang area was
limited to villages six to nine miles away.
   The city was quiet Wednesday, said Khieu Kanharith, reached by
telephone.
   The government radio has said troops repelled up to 200
guerrillas who attacked through four suburbs of the town at
midnight Friday to try to blow up a bridge.
   Also, Khieu confirmed that several plastic explosives went off
in the streets of Phnom Penh on Friday and Saturday, the eve of
National Day, but said there were no injuries or damage.
   He denied Khmer Rouge claims that grenades were used and that
the blasts had forced President Heng Samrin to flee to Vietnam,
which says it pulled its last troops out of Cambodia in September.
   The guerrillas also had claimed the explosions killed or wounded
some Vietnamese and others near an office of the Communist Party.
   In New Delhi, an Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman said
Wednesday the Indian mission in Phnom Penh did not mention the
reported flight of the leaders and certainly would have if it was
true.
   Indonesia's Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, a main organizer of
past Cambodian peace talks, met Wednesday in Bangkok with leaders
of the three guerrilla groups to try to revive the peace process
but gave no indication of progress.
   Under most detailed review is Australia's proposal for an
interim U.N. authority in Cambodia.
   The government's SPK news agency said that at talks in Cambodia
this week, Premier Hun Sen and Australian envoy Michael Costello
``agreed to the central idea that the United Nations should be
involved in the interim administration of Cambodia in the period
leading up to free and fair elections,'' but that the guerrillas
had to give up the Cambodian seat they hold at the United Nations.
   They recognized that such involvement could take many forms and
that detailed negotiations would be required, said the report dated
Monday and seen in Bangkok today.
   Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who heads the guerrilla coalition, has
said he would agree to the resistance vacating the U.N. seat if the
resistance and Hun Sen governments were simultaneously dismantled
and replaced by the U.N. authority.

   The portrayal of Mexican law enforcement in
the NBC miniseries ``Drug Wars'' was unfair and statements
following the broadcast that drug corruption is entrenched in
Mexico are inaccurate, the government says.
   ``President Carlos Salinas de Gortari considers the fight
against drugs a national priority,'' Mexico's Foreign Ministry said
in a statement Wednesday.
   The television miniseries, a dramatization of the 1985 slaying
in Mexico of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique
Camarena, was broadcast Sunday through Tuesday nights.
   Lloyd Siegel, executive producer for special broadcasts at NBC
News, said the Mexican Embassy in Washington had declined to have a
representative interviewed for one of the 15-minute news segments
that followed the program each night.
   Nonetheless, Siegel said, Mexico's efforts to combat drug
trafficking, especially in the last year, were praised in other
interviews and the network's reporting was accurate.
   Gustavo Gonzalez, legal adviser to the Mexican Embassy, said
Mexican officials declined to be interviewed partly because they
were apprehensive that any statements they made could be used by
attorneys representing the men charged with Camarena's murder.
   The Camarena case caused a major increase in tensions between
the United States and Mexico because of accusations that Mexican
law enforcement officials were in league with the killers, helped
cover up the crime and permitted suspects to escape.
   The Salinas administration, which took office on Dec. 1, 1988,
has tried to reduce tensions by making a strong effort to fight
drug trafficking and focusing the U.S.-Mexico relationship on
economic matters.
   President Bush and other U.S. officials have praised the
approach.
   The Foreign Ministry noted that Camarena's killers were
sentenced to long prison terms last month in Guadalajara, where
Camarena was the local DEA agent.
   The mastermind, Rafael Caro Quintero, was given a 40-year
sentence for the killing and a 34-year sentence for other
drug-related crimes. There is no parole in Mexico for drug-related
crimes.
   ``The government of Mexico has reiterated its conviction that
narcotics trafficking is an international crime that must be fought
on a multilateral level,'' said the Foreign Ministry.
   Underscoring the point, the attorney general's office announced
Wednesday that 13 men had been arrested for attempting to smuggle
1,650 pounds of cocaine to Houston. The men were presented to the
press with the seized cocaine, two AR-15 and two AK-47 assault
rifles.
   The attorney general's office said the group had planned to fly
the cocaine into the United States from a clandestine airstrip in
northern Mexico. Caro Quintero pioneered the Colombia-Mexico-U.S.
smuggling route, known as ``the trampoline.''
   The Salinas administration has played down the possible effect
of the long-anticipated miniseries on U.S.-Mexico relations, saying
the American audience would recognize it as a dramatization and
fictionalization of events.
   ``It is part of the ratings wars, not the drug wars,'' said
Agustin Barrios Gomez, Mexico's consul general in New York.
   But in Washington, Ambassador Gustavo Petricioli protested some
statements made during the news segments.
   The statement said an assertion was made on the program that
``Mexico is just like Panama, and that drug corruption is deep and
pervasive.''
   ``Likewise, we categorically deny statements, lacking of any
evidence, that top Mexican officials are involved in drug
trafficking, and that corruption goes to the highest level of the
Mexican government,'' the statement said.
   Like other NBC programs, ``Drug Wars'' appeared in English on
Mexico City cable systems.

<DATELINE>CENTRALIA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A carpet of flood waters lay across
southwest Washington and northern Oregon today, closing part of a
busy interstate highway and other roads and forcing about 3,000
people to flee their homes.
   The floods, which caused at least three deaths in southwestern
Washington, were beginning to recede on the plains west of the
Cascade Mountains late Wednesday. Bad weather also was blamed for
two deaths in Oregon since a series of storms smashed ashore last
weekend.
   Residents sandbagged riverbanks in some coastal Washington towns
as they braced for the rivers to crest at harbor's edge today and
Friday.
   ``This is potentially the worst flooding since the 1930s,'' said
Sheriff Dennis Morrissette of Grays Harbor County.
   The deaths included a man whose body was found floating in the
Centralia flood waters. A man whose car was swamped on a flooded
section of Interstate 5 south of town also died, and a man drowned
in his car north of Tacoma, authorities said.
   Twelve miles of I-5, the north-south artery linking Portland,
Ore., and Seattle, was closed after flood waters covered a two-mile
stretch near Centralia, the Department of Emergency Management
reported.
   Rain also washed out the main north-south rail route used by
Burlington Northern and Amtrak trains.
   Motorists were able to take a 60-mile detour around the I-5
closure but heavy trucks had to make a 100-mile detour through
eastern Washington.
   The worst flooding was in Centralia, a community of about
11,000, where the Chehalis River crested 8.4 feet above flood stage
by noon Wednesday and was not expected to fall below flood stage
until noon Friday, the National Weather Service said.
   Among the 3,000 Lewis County evacuees today were 400 who fled
after a waterlogged dike along the Skookumchuck River failed
overnight, authorities said.
   ``The dike has been breached and they couldn't hold it back with
sandbags,'' Fire Chief Chuck Newbury said Wednesday morning. ``It's
just threatening property at the moment. ... We don't foresee any
life-threatening problems.''
   Gov. Booth Gardner said he planned to ask for federal assistance
to deal with flood damage in Lewis County, which surrounds
Centralia.
   The state Emergency Services Department said damage in King
County, around Seattle, could run $4 million. Damage estimates for
other affected counties were not immediately available.
   The flooding followed four days of winds and heavy rain. Rains
eased or stopped Wednesday and the weather service predicted only
scattered showers for the next few days.
   In Oregon, the swamped area west of Portland began to drain, and
as floodwaters receded residents began cleaning up millions of
dollars in damage.
   At the height of the flooding Tuesday, water was 6 feet deep on
some roads.
   In Nehalem, a coastal town of 240 people about 75 miles west of
Portland, the water level dropped from 2{ feet to less than 1 foot
as the tide began receding Wednesday afternoon.
   Rugs dried on stoops in the sun and the sound of vacuums
competed with that of the ocean as businesses up and down U.S.
Highway 101 began salvaging their water-logged property.
   A herd of about 500 cattle was driven to higher ground by
members of the Tillamook Volunteer Fire Department, Levesque said.
Much of the county's prime dairy land was under water, and a few
cattle were wandering around in water up to their tails.
   Carol Dillin of Portland General Electric Co. said Wednesday
night that about 2,000 customers still were without electricity in
the utility's service area.
   Three Pacific storms dumped a total of 8.2 inches of rain on
Astoria, at the mouth of the Columbia River. More than half that
amount fell during the 24 hours ending at 4 p.m. Tuesday, according
to the National Weather Service.
   The Nehalem River crested Tuesday nearly 12 feet above flood
stage, the highest level since records began being kept in 1971.

<HEAD>Two Japanese Who Fought for 40 years With Malaysian Communists
Head Home</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Japanese men who fought for their
country in World War II and then took up arms with Malaysian
Communist guerrillas for more than 40 years were on their way home
today.
   Shigeyuki Hashimoto, 71, and Kiyoaki Tanaka, 77, flew to Bangkok
today from the southern Thai town of Hat Yai, near the Malaysian
jungle border they left after the Communist insurgency was
disbanded in December.
   Japanese reporters who accompanied the men quoted them as saying
they joined the Communist Party of Malaysia to help the country
gain independence from Britain.
   Independence came in 1957, but the insurgency continued. The two
Japanese did not want to surrender before the party was disbanded
because they feared that would hurt its morale, the reporters said.
   ``They said they never forgot about Japan and had wished to go
back since the beginning,'' said Hiroshi Inomata, first secretary
at the Japanese Embassy.
   ``But the time was not ripe for them to do that. They didn't
want to surrender. Now that the peace agreement has been made, they
are free to go.''
   ``Tanaka said there are many good things and many bad thing
about the years they spent in the jungle,'' Inomata said. ``They
had many good friends who were quite cooperative and trusted each
other. They said they will miss their friends and they promised to
write letters.''
   ``They said they are happy to be going home but I think they
might have some uneasiness as well,'' he said.
   The Japanese reporters said the two, who joined the Communists
in 1945 after serving in Japan's Imperial Army, knew of the
enormous changes in Japan since World War II from their shortwave
radio.
   The Japanese left the former Communist headquarters in the
jungle on Wednesday and went to a military camp in Hat Yai. There,
Hashimoto was met by two younger brothers and Tanaka by a daughter
and his nephew.
   They also had a party with their former comrades before leaving
Hat Yai, the reporters said.
   Hashimoto arrived at Bangkok airport in a wheelchair, clutching
a walking stick and appearing very fragile. Tanaka also had a
walking stick.
   Japanese Embassy officials helped Hashimoto out of the
wheelchair and into a limousine for the ride to a hospital for a
checkup along with Tanaka.
   They were to leave for Japan on Saturday.
   Hashimoto, from Kanagawa prefecture, adjoining Tokyo, is to stay
at a hospital in Tokyo because of his high blood pressure while
Tanaka will return to his hometown in Kumamoto prefecture in
southern Japan, an embassy official said. He said Tanaka's wife was
still alive.
   The embassy official, Hirofumi Takemoto, said the two men had
worked for a private Japanese company in Malaysia before they
joined the Japanese army during World War II.
   The Communist insurgency _ one of the world's longest _
officially ended with the signing Dec. 2 of a peace accord between
the insurgents and Thai and Malaysian officials.
   British Commonwealth forces fought bloody battles with the
insurgents during what was known as the 1948-1960 ``emergency.''
   Fighting continued after that on a lesser scale, and the two
Japanese told reporters they engaged in combat in the 1960s.
   Thai-Malaysian military strikes and a Thai amnesty badly hurt
the movement, and its leader, Chin Peng, said only 1,200 guerrillas
had been operating along the 375-mile Thai-Malaysian frontier in
recent years.

   The U.S. Supreme Court's decision
overturning fines against four city councilmen who defied a federal
judge's housing desegregation order was hailed by the mayor as ``a
triumph for democracy.''
   But NAACP officials said Wednesday's 5-4 ruling by the nation's
highest court had no effect on the desegregation order itself, and
that portraying it as such would be a ``cruel hoax.''
   Three of the councilmen gathered at City Hall to celebrate the
decision with pink champagne.
   ``It's one helluva way to kick off the new year,'' said
Councilman Peter Chema, one of the four whose defiance of U.S.
District Leonard Sand's order in August 1988 put this city of
195,000 just north of New York City on the brink of bankruptcy.
   ``It's a triumph for democracy,'' said Mayor Henry Spallone, a
former councilman who became mayor last November by defeating the
incumbent who supported Sand's order.
   NAACP attorney Michael Sussman, however, said portraying the
high court's ruling as a way to avoid building 1,000 units of
court-ordered low- and moderate-income housing would represent a
``cruel hoax and false hope.''
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
is one of the plaintiffs in the decade-long desegregation case.
   ``The Supreme Court's decision, as disappointing as it may be,
has absolutely no effect on the original Yonkers remedy order
issued by Judge Sand,'' NAACP Executive Director Benjamin Hooks
said in a statement from the organization's Baltimore headquarters.
``That remains unaffected and represents the culmination of nine
years spent in court by the NAACP, facing the recalcitrant city of
Yonkers.''
   Construction on the first 200 units of low-income housing was to
begin within the next two months.
   Attorneys for the councilmen said it was unknown what action
they would take in light of the decision. Sussman was confident
construction would begin, and said the rest of the plan was being
reworked.
   The Supreme Court said Sand exceeded his authority in imposing
the fines. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said Sand acted too
hastily in holding the councilmen in contempt.
   Rehnquist said the judge should have waited to see whether
Sand's contempt ruling against the city succeeded in forcing
compliance with the judge's desegregation order.
   In the summer of 1988, Sand threatened the councilmen with jail
and fines and the city with bankruptcy if the council refused to
obey his orders to build the housing.
   Council voted 4-3 against the plan, and Sand imposed the fines.
   With fines nearing $1 million and facing massive layoffs of city
workers, City Council reversed itself and voted to comply with
Sand's order.
   The city paid $189,000 in fines and the councilmen paid $3,500
each.
   Sand ordered the desegregation plan after finding that Yonkers
had for 40 years deliberately concentrated virtually all subsidized
housing in the southwest section of the city to keep blacks away
from whites.
   In 1980, blacks represented 10.5 percent of Yonkers' 195,000
residents.
   Spallone ran for re-election last year on his record of opposing
the housing and won decisively, as did Chema and Councilman Edward
Fagan.
   The fourth defiant councilman, Nicholas Longo, lost a close
election to a pro-housing candidate, Thomas Dickerson.
   The councilmen said Wednesday the ruling vindicated their right
to vote their conscience, and Spallone pointed to their successful
use of the court system.
   The decision ``adds a whole new impetus to continue the fight
against the housing,'' Fagan said, who later acknowledged the
ruling might have little effect.
   ``But it's an emotional boost,'' he said. ``We have to review
other legal maneuvers.
   ``I'm looking forward to getting my money back,'' he added.
   Officials said attorneys would review whether a January 1988
consent decree in which the council agreed to build the housing was
still binding; the vote was taken after Sand threatened to fine and
jail the councilmen.

   John Dale ``Johnny'' Sylvester, who became
the most famous little sick boy in America after Babe Ruth promised
to smack a World Series homer for him _ and hit three _ has died 63
years later. He was 74.
   Sylvester died Monday at a Mineola hospital. No cause of death
was given.
   In 1926, Sylvester was suffering from a serious infection of the
forehead caused by a kick from a horse when he told his father, ``I
wish I could see Babe Ruth wallop a homer before I die.''
   The family sent telegrams to the New York Yankees while they
were playing in St. Louis. Back came an airmail package containing
two baseballs, one autographed by the St. Louis Cardinals, the
other signed by several Yankees, including Ruth, who wrote, ``I'll
knock a homer for you on Wednesday.''
   Ruth hit three that day. In a follow-up note the day of Game 6,
Ruth said he would ``try to knock you another homer, maybe two
today,'' but went homerless. He hit one in Game 7 but it was not
enough to prevent the Yankees from losing the Series. In fact, Ruth
was caught stealing for the final out.
   Ruth visited the Essex Fells, N.J., boy at his bedside after the
Series, a meeting at which Sylvester remarked, ``I'm sorry the
Yanks lost.''
   No miraculous recovery occurred, but the visit certainly did no
harm. It took Sylvester three years before he fully recovered.
Sylvester returned the gesture in 1948, visiting Ruth four months
before the slugger died of cancer.
   The 1926 episode later was part of the movie ``The Babe Ruth
Story,'' but the screen version stretched the truth by having Ruth
make his home run promise at Sylvester's hospital bedside. The boy
apparently was never hospitalized.
   Earlier, in the 1942 movie ``The Pride of the Yankees,''
Hollywood had stretched the tale even further with a promise of two
home runs by Lou Gehrig.
   Sylvester served in the Navy in World War II and was later
president of Amscomatic Inc., a manufacturer of packing machinery.
   He is survived by his son, John Jr., a sister, Ruth Elliott of
Barrington R.I., and a brother, Horace C. Sylvester Jr., of
Osterville, Mass.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. attorney said he will investigate any
allegations of civil rights violations stemming from the probe into
the shooting of Charles Stuart and his pregnant wife, Carol.
   ``I'm not at this point suggesting that they exist, only that if
there are allegations or complaints, we'll be willing to review
them,'' U.S. Attorney Wayne Budd said Wednesday.
   Stuart, who was white, told police in October that a black man
jumped in their car after he and his wife left a childbirth class,
robbed them and shot them. Last week, Stuart was implicated by his
brother and apparently committed suicide the next day.
   Budd met for nearly two hours Wednesday with four black and one
Hispanic legislators.
   One of them, Rep. Shirley Owens-Hicks, said residents of the
predominantly black Mission Hill section where the shootings were
reported, complained of being illegally searched, intimidated and
``having their doors kicked in and having their apartments
trashed'' by police.
   ``We are urging any individual in the black community who feels
their civil rights were violated, directly or indirectly ... to be
in touch with the U.S. attorney,'' said Rep. Byron Rushing.
   Budd said that to bring federal criminal charges of civil rights
violations, the alleged victims must have suffered physical
excesses or harm from touching by police.
   He said allegations of police harassment not involving touching
would come under the jurisdiction of the state attorney general's
office or could be pursued in civil suits.

<HEAD>Amnesty Says Hundreds Detained, Tortured in Saudi Arabia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia has in the past seven years held
hundreds of political opponents without trial, mainly Shiite
Moslems, subjecting them to routine torture, Amnesty International
charged today.
   More than 700 people were detained without trial there from 1983
to 1989, including at least 100 last year, the worldwide human
rights organization said.
   The 27-page report on the oil-rich kingdom, which is dominated
by Sunni Moslems, identified 66 people it said were being held
without trial in three prisons.
   They included 20 alleged members of Hezbollah, the
Iranian-backed fundamentalist Shiite group suspected of holding
Western hostages in Lebanon.
   ``A clear pattern of human rights violations _ including the use
of torture _ has emerged in Saudi Arabia in recent years,'' Amnesty
said.
   The Saudi royal family runs the country and bans all political
parties and labor unions. No penal code or constitution exists.
Legislation is based mainly on Islamic law and introduced by royal
decree or ministerial regulations.
   Besides the Hezbollah followers, most of the detainees were
suspected followers of the country's main Shiite opposition group,
the Organization of Islamic Revolution, and another banned group,
the Arab Socialist Action Party, the London-based rights group said.
   It said political detainees were routinely tortured into signing
so-called confessions. Victims said favored methods were beating
the soles of feet, sleep deprivation and suspension by the wrists
from a ceiling or high window.
   Most detainees spend from 14 days to six months in solitary
confinement before and during interrogation, Amnesty reported.
   It said people who balked at signing confessions and
acknowledging them ``were interrogated again and tortured until
they `changed their minds.'''
   Amnesty said it received reports of detainees dying in custody.
   The group said it protested to the Saudi government, but

<HEAD>Woman Sues Abortion Clinic After Having a Baby</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 17-year-old girl gave birth
prematurely four days after undergoing an abortion procedure,
according to a $10 million lawsuit filed against the doctor and
nurse who performed the operation.
   The doctor told Tralishia Nicole Gillespie she was six or seven
weeks pregnant when the abortion was performed Dec. 18 at a clinic.
In fact she was in her 26th week, the girl's lawyer, Don Caulkins,
said Wednesday.
   The abortion was unsuccessful and four days later, Ms. Gillespie
suffered abdominal cramps and went to a hospital, where doctors
examined her and detected a fetal heartbeat, Caulkins said.
   Ms. Gillespie was taken to Vanderbilt University Medical Center,
where she delivered the 1{-pound baby in the hallway, Caulkins said.
   The 3-week-old girl, De'Angela Nicole Alexander, was in critical
condition, hospital officials said Wednesday night.
   ``The survival rate for children born at 26 weeks is
approximately 60 percent,'' said Dr. Frank Boehm, Vanderbilt's
director of obstetrics, who delivered the girl.
   In the Circuit Court lawsuit, Dr. Karen J. Smiley and nurse Lola
Oni of the Family Planning Clinic for Reproductive Health are
charged with negligence and gross negligence for not properly
diagnosing the age of the fetus and for attempting to perform the
abortion, Caulkins said.
   The lawsuit, filed Wednesday by Joan Stover, the baby's
grandmother, asks $5 million in compensatory damages and $5 million
in punitive damages.
   There was no answer at Smiley's home or at the clinic when The
Associated Press called for comment Wednesday night.
   Boehm said Smiley told him on Dec. 23 that she had done a pelvic
examination on Ms. Gillespie before the procedure. The information
that Ms. Gillespie provided about her last menstrual period would
be consistent with her being about seven weeks pregnant, Boehm said.
   Boehm said it isn't uncommon for pregnant women to have
menstrual bleeding.
   He said the attempted abortion ``more likely than not'' caused
Ms. Gillespie to go into early labor.
   Ms. Gillespie underwent a suction abortion procedure that took
about 30 minutes. She was given pain medication and sent home
afterward, Caulkins said.
   An investigation is under way to determine if the clinic
violated state health department rules, said Dr. Peggy Alsup,
medical director of the department's Bureau of Manpower and
Facilities.
   Caulkins said Ms. Gillespie is now undergoing psychiatric
treatment.
   ``She's devastated, obviously. She would never have dreamed of
having an abortion had she known it (the fetus) was 26 weeks old.''
   Ms. Gillespie, who isn't married, wants to keep the baby,
Caulkins said, adding that she and the father are engaged.

   Neighbors and strangers jammed a memorial
service for a family of five who authorities say were shot and
buried under a barn by a religious cult, possibly as a sacrifice.
   As about 250 people filled the small brick church Wednesday
night to pay respects to the Avery family, authorities in Southern
California said they arrested the last two members of the cult,
ending a nationwide manhunt for 13 people accused in the slayings.
   Law officers stopped a pickup truck about 60 miles northeast of
San Diego and arrested Daniel David Kraft and Kathryn Johnson, said
agent James Stathes of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms in California.
   In Kirtland, five pink candles burned at the Reorganized Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for 49-year-old Dennis Avery;
his wife, Cheryl, 42; and their three daughters: Trina, 15;
Rebecca, 13; and Karen, 7.
   Four ministers of different denominations addressed the mourners.
   ``The tragedy that has (hit) us has caused our ordered world to
collapse for the time being, and we will never be the same again,''
said the Rev. Bruce Morrison, a United Church of Christ pastor.
``When unexpected tragedy disrupts our lives in the way in which
this one has, we find ourselves plunged into mystery.''
   Barbara Eckart, a member of the Reorganized Church in Kirtland,
30 miles east of Cleveland, said she didn't know the Averys because
they seldom attended services, but felt the need to pray for them.
   ``I came to support the congregation, and because of the fact
that it was an unfair thing that happened to them,'' she said. ``I
feel that they didn't have anybody here.''
   Authorities say the Averys moved to Kirtland from Missouri at
the urging of a former lay minister of the Reorganized Church,
Jeffrey Lundgren, and later joined his cult when he broke from the
church.
   The Averys were killed apparently in an April 18 ritual
sacrifice designed to ``cleanse'' the cult and allow it to
relocate, authorities said.
   The Rev. Dale Luffman, president of the northeast Ohio chapter
of the Reorganized Church, has said the slayings may have been
prompted by disputes over money or sex, or in an effort to keep the
Averys from leaving the cult.
   Until April, Lundgren rented the 15-acre farm where the bodies
were found and where some of his followers had lived. Investigators
said it appears the Averys, who lived nearby and were not as
fervent as his other followers, were shot before the cult headed to
West Virginia and eventually to a farm near Holden, Mo.
   The bodies were unearthed last week after police got an
anonymous tip. All five had duct tape across their eyes and some
had their hands and feet bound with the tape, authorities said.
   Officials in Lake County are seeking the extradition of
Lundgren, his wife and son, and 10 others from California. Lundgren
and the others have refused to waive the proceeding, which could
take 90 days, officials said.
   The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer reported today that Mrs. Avery's
mother received a short note from her daughter, apparently dashed
off just hours before the five were shot, mentioning a planned move
to Wyoming.
   The two arrested Wednesday, Kraft, 25, of Nauvoo, Ill., and
Johnson, 36, of Holden, Mo., had eluded authorities since the
arrests of Lundgren, 39; his wife, Alice, 38; and son, Damon, 19,
at a motel Sunday in National City near San Diego. Eight others
also have been detained.
   Other cult members implicated Lundgren as the triggerman in the
deaths, a federal agent said in documents filed Wednesday in El
Cajon Municipal Court.
   Also, a newspaper reported that Lundgren was drawing welfare
checks in San Diego County for almost a month before his capture.
He applied for welfare last month and received $940 in checks at a
Chula Vista motel in December and earlier this month, the Los
Angeles Times said.
   Ohio prosecutor Steven LaTourette said Lundgren and his son face
five counts of aggravated murder. If convicted, they could face the
death penalty.
   The others face a variety of charges including murder and
conspiracy to commit murder.
   Authorities found an assortment of firearms and knives,
thousands of rounds of ammunition, a .50-caliber rifle, gas masks
and other equipment at two San Diego-area hotels and at a storage
unit in nearby Chula Vista.
   The Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is
based in Independence, Mo. It has roots and some beliefs in common
with the Salt Lake City-based Mormon Church, but is separate.

<HEAD>Budget to Prolong Paternal Leave, Lower Abseenteism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mothers and fathers will be able to
stay home with a newborn child for 15 months with full pay under
the new budget proposed by the Social Democratic government.
   The leave covers just one parent, but the two can split the
months between them. Parents are currently allowed to split 12
fully paid months after the birth of a child, after which they can
receive $9.60 a day for three months.
   The budget bill, presented on Wednesday, also proposes to
increase family allowances by $145 to $1,083 annually per child.
   Finance Minister Kjell-Olof Feldt said, however, that the
government could reconsider the plan if unions continue pressing
for higher wages, which rose by about 9 percent last year.
   In 1987, 7.5 percent of the paid parental leave was used by
fathers. So this year, the budget bill sets aside nearly $500,000
for a campaign to inform fathers about their rights to use the
social insurance and stay home.
   Sweden's high taxes make it difficult for a family to survive on
one wage, and critics have said the system gives parents no choice
but to leave small children to often understaffed nurseries.
   In another move, Feldt proposed to check soaring absenteeism by
stricter control over people who call in sick to work.
   The budget presented to Parliament on Wednesday entailed few
other changes to Sweden's generous social welfare system.

<HEAD>Snow in Upper Great Lakes; Warm Continues in South</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gale-strength winds brought more snow to the upper Great Lakes
today as a strong low-pressure system moved over Lake Superior. The
Gulf states and southern Plains were expecting temperatures as much
as 25 degrees warmer than usual.
   But the National Weather Service said the warm spell won't last.
Cold air driven south by high pressure was to lower readings by as
much as 35 degrees Friday.
   Strong southerly winds ahead of the approaching cold front
caused temperatures to soar 40 to 50 degrees across the central
states on Wednesday. Afternoon highs in the 70s were reported as
far north as Nebraska and eastern Colorado.
   A total of 48 cities _ from International Falls, Minn., to
Phoenix, Ariz. _ reported record high temperatures for the date.
   Strong, gusty winds prevailed in the north-central states as a
Pacific front ushered in colder temperatures. Wednesday's winds hit
81 mph northwest of Denver; 78 mph at Boulder, Colo.; 67 mph at
Bismarck, N.D. and 66 mph at Laramie, Wyo.
   International Falls was the nation's cold spot Wednesday with a
low of 3 degrees below zero, yet managed to set a record high of 39
later in the day.
   Three cities in Nebraska and one in North Dakota reported record
high temperatures for the month of January on Wednesday. Eight
cities in North Dakota reported new record highs for the date.
   Freezing temperatures were mostly confined to the upper Great
Lakes, where afternoon highs were in the 20s and lower 30s.
   New England expected sunshine early today, followed by afternoon
clouds and a chance of flurries. Friday's forecast called for
breezy and colder weather.
   Temperatures warmed into the 70s and 80s in southern parts of
Florida, Arizona and California.
   The high for the nation Wednesday was 85 degrees at San Gabriel,
Calif.

<HEAD>CBS Records Exec Issues Anti-Bigotry Memo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of CBS Records, responding to
complaints of anti-Semitism by a rap group carried by CBS, called
on his employees to make sure that the company's recordings do not
promote bigotry.
   In a memorandum dated Wednesday, Walter Yetnikoff did not name
Public Enemy, the group whose newest record, ``Welcome to the
Terrordome,'' has been assailed by Jewish groups as anti-Semitic.
CBS distributes Public Enemy's recordings.
   Yetnikoff said some recent recordings ``have stirred strong
reactions outside and within the industry suggesting that these
songs validate and promote bigotry and intolerance.''
   ``Traditionally, music has often served as an important sounding
board for the expression of social criticism and rage, and also
provides an outlet for artists to vent their feelings. It goes
without saying that artists have the right of freedom of
expression,'' Yetnikoff said.
   Still, ``When the issue is bigotry, there is a fine line of
acceptable standards which no piece of music should cross,'' he
said. The music industry should ``challenge people to recognize the
evils of racism, bigotry, anti-Semitism and intolerance in any and
all forms.''
   In its record, Public Enemy implies that Jews crucified Jesus
and claims that it has been crucified for the comments of Professor
Griff, a non-performing group member who claimed in a newspaper
interview that Jews were responsible for most of the wickedness in
the world.
   The group's leader, Chuck D., denied that lyrics were
anti-Semitic or that the lyrics involved Jews at all.
   But Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal
Center in Los Angeles, who met with Yetnikoff, welcomed the memo as
``an important first step for the music industry as a whole.
   ``We hope that this will mark the beginning of a long overdue
process in which not only CBS Records, but all major record
producers will begin to live up to their responsibility of
combating rather than validating bigotry in America,'' he said.
   Cooper also has attacked statements by Axl Rose of Guns 'N Roses
as homophobic and racist. Cooper said he intended to write a letter
to David Geffen at Geffen Records _ Guns 'N Roses' record company _
challenging him to follow Yetnikoff's lead.

   Mayor Patrick Pasculli says New Yorkers who
claim the Empire State is the birthplace of baseball are way off
base.
   Pasculli announced Wednesday the formation of American Baseball
Heritage Inc., a non-profit organization formed to pitch this
mile-square city as baseball's home and lobby nationally for
``Baseball Day,'' to be celebrated annually June 19. Hoboken will
create a museum to chronicle the contributions of Alexander J.
Cartwright.
   Pasculli said the first game of baseball was played on Hoboken's
Elysian Fields during the afternoon of June 19, 1846. He credits
Cartwright _ a surveyor, amateur athlete and inventor _ with
refining the game.
   ``Once and for all we're going to destroy the fabrication that
Abner Doubleday invented the game, and that Cooperstown, N.Y., was
its birthplace,'' Paculli told a news conference.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, however, disagrees.
   Cuomo signed a bill in April that will allow New Yorkers to
order license plates donning the picture of a ball and the words,
``Birthplace of Baseball.''
   Stephen Speiser, president of the Hoboken group, thinks Cuomo's
out in left field.
   The game really evolved from the British games of cricket and
rounders, Speiser said. Cartwright refined it, wrote down the
rules, and umpired the first game, he said.
   League historians at the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown agree that
Cartwright played an important role early in the game. But they say
New York has a better claim than New Jersey, by at least a year, of
fielding the first match.

   California, move over. Florida,
which boasts more vehicles than people, has earned the dubious
title of the car capital of the world.
   The state has 12.8 million residents _ and 15.1 million
vehicles, according to the latest statistics from Florida's
Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.
   California has only 8.5 vehicles for every 10 people. Florida
also leads the nation in new car sales.
   Some Floridians have one car for pleasure and another for work.
Tourists want rental cars. Families buy junkers for teens. People
who winter in Florida keep a spare in the state. Even those who
might not be able to afford a car need something to get around in
because of inadequate public transportation.
   ``The biggest thing these numbers say is what a lousy public
transportation system we have in Florida,'' said John DeGrove, of
the Joint Center for Urban universities.
   J.D. Power &amp; Associates, a California-based research firm, found
that Floridians buy 87.34 new cars for every 1,000 people each
year, nearly 50 percent above the national average.

McCormack, who also has brought out target posters of U.S. Sen. Ted

   ``A lot of military people have been requesting the Noriega

toppled by a U.S. invasion last month.
   ``Most of them couldn't go in the invasion, so they figure this
is the closest they can get to him,'' McCormack said. ``I guess a

Noriega now faces federal drug charges.

<HEAD>Researchers Moving Toward Vaccine For Lyme Disease</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A vaccine to protect against Lyme disease could
be available in five years, said the inventor of a vaccine that has
protected laboratory animals against infection.
   Russell Johnson, a microbiologist at the University of Minnesota
in Minneapolis, said negotiations with makers of human vaccines
should conclude within a month, allowing research to apply the
animal vaccine to humans.
   The vaccine was patented by the University of Minnesota, and its
use has been licensed to Molecular Genetics of Minneapolis, Johnson
said. The company is now negotiating with vaccine makers, he said.
   The vaccine, developed in 1986, protects hamsters from infection
with Lyme disease, which is spread by ticks, said Russell Johnson,
a microbiologist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.
   A vaccine to protect dogs and other animals against Lyme disease
could be ready for use in a year, said Johnson. Development of a
human vaccine takes longer because of the higher standards such a
vaccine must meet, he said.
   Johnson said he and his colleagues showed in 1986 that injecting
dead Lyme disease bacteria into hamsters would protect them against
infection.
   Last month, researchers at the University of Wisconsin used a
slightly different technique to protect hamsters against Lyme
disease. They first produced antibodies against Lyme disease
bacteria by injecting the bacteria into a group of hamsters, said
Ronald Schell, director of the research.
   They then extracted the antibodies and used them to protect
another group of hamsters, which had been irradiated so that they
would lose their normal immune systems and would therefore show the
symptoms of Lyme disease.
   When hamsters were given the antibodies before being infected,
they developed no sign of disease, said Ronald Schell, director of
the research. The finding was announced by the university in
December and a report appears in the January issue of Infection and
Immunity.
   Schell criticized the federal government for not providing more
financial support for research on Lyme disease.
   ``The state of research for Lyme disease is being hampered
because of the lack of federal support,'' he said. ``We want to get
rid of the disease, and it seems now it might be easier than we
thought.''
   Lyme disease, which is spread by ticks found on deer, mice and
other mammals, usually begins with a characteristic bull's-eye
rash, a red ring around a clear center. It causes arthritis-like
inflammation of the joints and can cause damage to the nervous
system. It can usually be treated with antibiotics.
   Between 1980 and 1988 some 14,000 cases were reported in the
United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.
The actual numbers may be several times that, doctors say.
   More than one-third of the cases, or about 5,000, occurred in
1988. Most cases have been confined to the Northeast, Wisconsin and
Minnesota.

<HEAD>Oil Platforms Halt Production as Redoubt Flooding Threatens
Terminal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEAN FOSDICK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Earthquakes continued to rumble under
Redoubt Volcano and oil producers shut down their platforms amid
fears the tremors could send floodwaters cascading over an oil
terminal on the Cook Inlet.
   Redoubt has been erupting since mid-December, sending corrosive
ash as high as eight miles into the sky and melting glacier ice,
producing muddy torrents of water that have overflowed the banks of
the Drift River.
   The Drift River storage terminal, with 38 million gallons of oil
stored in its tanks, sits on the banks of the inlet in the shadow
of the volcano 115 miles southwest of Anchorage. The terminal has
been closed since Tuesday, and officials planned to remove most of
its oil.
   Redoubt's last eruption was Monday, but seismologists said the
volcano remains active, and that more flooding was possible in
future eruptions.
   ``The quake activity indicates the volcano is relatively quiet
for now and it does not appear to be building toward stronger
eruptive activity,'' geologist Steve Brantley of the Alaska Volcano
Observatory said Wednesday. Still, a major eruption like Monday's
is possible, he said.
   Ten of the 15 platforms that pull oil from the Cook Inlet send
their crude to the Drift River terminal for storage. With the
terminal closed, eight of the 10 platforms have been forced to shut
down, said Bill Lamoreaux, a regional supervisor with the state
Department of Environmental Conservation.
   ``The other two platforms are (operating at) very low volume,''
Lamoreaux said.
   There have been fears the flooding could breach storage tanks,
causing a spill of the dimensions of the March 24 wreck of the
tanker Exxon Valdez, which released 11 million gallons of North
Slope crude into Prince William Sound.
   Harold Mouser, manager of Cook Inlet Pipe Line Co., which
operates the terminal, said the tanker Sansinena was standing by to
remove the terminal's oil as soon as the procedure is ready.
   ``We do not have our equipment operational yet for loading the
tanker. People there are working on it and have been working
through the night,'' Mouser said Wednesday.
   Cook Inlet Pipeline Co. and the state agreed Tuesday to shut
down the terminal and remove about 80 percent of the oil.
   The terminal probably will not resume operations until the
company and the state can agree how to operate it safely under the
continuing threat of Redoubt, Lamoreaux said.
   ``They recognize they had a heck of an inventory of crude oil,''
he said. ``The facility sits right on the shoreline of Cook Inlet.
The tank farm is on the back side, but there's nothing to stop it
if the contents were lost.''
   ``I'll be feeling a lot better when the total volume is
reduced.''
   The production halt could cost the state of Alaska some money,
said Chuck Logsden, a petroleum economist with the Department of
Revenue. The affected fields contributed much of the $23.3 million
in royalties Alaska collected last year from Cook Inlet production,
he said.

outspoken oracle of style said of Miss Jackson, who gained
notoriety when she posed nude for Playboy magazine. ``If I had her
face and body I'd stay in bed all day.''
   Blackwell also had unkind words about the sartorial splendor of
Roseanne Barr, Demi Moore, Kim Basinger, Princess Anne, Emily
Lloyd, Daryl Hannah, Paula Abdul and, in a tie for 10th, Madonna
and Sandra Bernhard.
   ``The finalists were a parade of terrors that make The Joker in
`Batman' look positively conservative by comparison,'' said
Blackwell. ``Ninety-nine percent of these people could be mistaken
for a baglady.''
   Blackwell reserved special dishonorable mention for singer Grace
Jones, whom he termed ``Darth Vader's S&amp;M fantasy in a martian
birdcage.''
   Blackwell, whose real name is Richard Sylvan Selzer, held court
at his well-appointed Hancock Park home Wednesday to unveil the
30th annual Worst-Dressed Women list.
   Television's Miss Barr was zinged as a ``bowling alley reject,''
former brat-packer Miss Moore was ``a spandexed `Nightmare on
Willis Street,''' and ``Batman'' star Miss Basinger was a
``parading peep-show (who) should be banished to the batcave.''
   Princess Anne was reduced to ``lumpy, dumpy and frumpy,'' Cher
to a ``bag of tattooed bones in a sequinned slingshot,'' Miss
Hannah to a ``Vegas Venus on steroids,'' Miss Abdul to a ``fashion
gypsy (who) dances in the light (and) dresses in the dark,'' and
Madonna and Bernhard to ``the Mutt and Jeff of MTV: vampy, trampy
... and cartoon campy.''
   While some have questioned Blackwell's fashion credentials, he
boasts that he formerly designed dresses for a distinguished
clientele, including Zsa Zsa Gabor and Marilyn Monroe, before
devoting full attention to his yearly list.
   ``I was a fashion designer with 450 accounts all over the world,
but I left it two years ago when the miniskirt came back,'' he said.
   Blackwell said he does the list so that ``people who want star
status don't make a mistake and copy'' the fashion frumps.
   After reading off the fashion rap sheet, Blackwell turned his
attention to a select group of woman he considers fashion paragons.
   His Top 10 list of Fabulous Fashion Independents included first
lady Barbara Bush, Geena Davis, Ivana Trump, Angela Lansbury,
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Liza Minnelli, Barbara
Walters, Tina Brown, Princess Diana and Jacqueline Onassis.
   Blackwell said only two of his targets for disdain ever
complained _ Beatrice Arthur and Dinah Shore.
   ``They were furious,'' he said. ``But most of them love to make
the list. I never insult them as people. This is an observation of
what they look like to me.
   ``I adore many of them as performers,'' he said.

<HEAD>Loss of Interferon Genes Linked with Leukemia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A form of blood cancer that strikes children
appears to be sometimes linked with genetic damage that hinders the
body's ability to make interferon, according to a study published
today.
   The researchers speculate that genes that oversee the body's
production of interferon, a disease-fighting substance, may play a
role in warding off the development of cancer.
   The researchers speculate that the interferon genes may act as
regulators that stop the body's cells from becoming cancerous.
   The researchers, based at the University of Chicago, found an
association between loss of the genes and development of acute
lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common form of childhood leukemia.
   They tested 62 patients with this kind of leukemia and found
that 29 percent of them were missing the interferon genes.
   Their work, directed by Dr. Manuel O. Diaz, was published in the
New England Journal of Medicine. It adds to the growing list of
cancers that have been associated with the presence or absence of
particular genes.
   Some genes, known oncogenes, are though to trigger cancer.
Cancer can also occur when other genes, known as anti-oncogenes,
are missing.
   Interferon plays a variety of roles in regulating the body's
immune defenses and controlling cell growth.
   The production of two forms of interferon, known as alpha and
beta-1, are controlled by two genes that are close together on
chromosome 9 in the body's library of genes.
   In the latest work, the researchers found that this section of
the chromosome was frequently missing in those with acute
lymphoblastic leukemia. However, they left open the possibility
that some other gene in this region besides those that make
interferon could also be the tumor-suppressing gene.
   Acute lymphoblastic leukemia accounts for about one-quarter of
all childhood cancers. It strikes one in every 30,000 children.

<HEAD>Israeli Cargo Plane Left Panama Just Before Invasion, Says
Published Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Israeli C-130 cargo plane carrying
``evidence'' of Israel's ties to the regime of Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega took off from Panama City about six hours before U.S.
troops invaded last month, according to a published report today
that cites U.S. intelligence sources.
   The Washington Times said its sources, which were not
identified, said the plane's departure came about the time an
ex-Israeli master spy was tipped about the impending U.S. strike
and fled the country.
   The paper said its sources did not know whether the Israeli,
Mike Harari, was on the plane and likewise did not have specifics
on what ``evidence'' was on the plane.
   Harari has appeared on television in Israel since the U.S.
invasion and rejected suggestions that he helped Noriega with the
Panamanian Defense Forces.
   The paper quoted a spokeswoman at the Israeli embassy in
Washington, Ruth Yaron, as saying on Wednesday that ``as far as we
know'' no Israeli C-130 took off from Panama on Dec. 19.
   As to whether Israel sold arms in Panama, Mrs. Yaron was quoted
as saying: ``Our policy is not to give any details as to whom or
what we sell. We don't discuss it.''

<TEXT>
   The dollar rose against most major currencies
before easing off again in moderately active European trading early
today. Gold prices rose by around $5 an ounce.
   Dealers said the dollar came off early highs in late morning
trading as investors sifted through a variety of economic and
political signals, mainly involving Eastern Europe, in a search for
direction.
   ``It's a difficult moment to define the dollar's strength,''
said a trader in Milan, Italy. ``It did regain against the (West
German) mark, but now is proving unable to maintain those levels.''
   Dealers said the dollar benefited earlier today when concerns
about the course of developments in Eastern Europe pressured the
West German currency. The dollar also benefited from nationalist
unrest in the Soviet Union, they said.
   Traders attributed the dollar's relapse to market fears of
central bank intervention and investors' generally reflective
stance.
   In Tokyo, the dollar edged down 0.03 Japanese yen to a closing
145.27 yen. Later, in London, it fell further to 145.25 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.6837 West German marks, up from 1.6795
   _1.5175 Swiss francs, up from 1.5120
   _5.7340 French francs, up from 5.7145
   _1.9035 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8815
   _1,257.50 Italian lire, up from 1,255.00
   _1.1575 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1585
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.6553 from $1.6625 late
Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $411.80 a troy ounce, up
from $408.55 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $413.55.
   In Zurich, the noon bid price was $413.85, up from $409.25 bid
late Wednesday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose $5.54 to close at a bid $409.62.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $5.33 a troy ounce, up
from $5.30 bid late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Black Leaders Say Rural Poor Still Hurting After Hugo</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Although nearly four months have passed
since Hurricane Hugo smashed into the coast, it might as well be
the morning after for thousands of the rural poor, community
leaders say.
   J.T. McLawhorn Jr., the president of the Columbia Urban League,
said the organization recently canvassed 17 of the 24 counties
declared disaster areas by the federal government.
   During the effort, financed by a state grant, they found
thousands of people bit is
still like the day after Hugo,'' McLawhorn reporters Wednesday.
   He urged the Federal Emergency Management Agency to extend its
deadline for applying for disaster aid beyond Saturday, and called
on state leaders to develop a comprehensive plan to help victims.
   McLawhorn said the state has gone to great lengths to tell the
world the recovery is under way, but, ``That doesn't apply to
thousands and thousands of poor people.''
   He said the real test for the recovery is not whether the state
restores tourism or its beaches but in how well the people of the
state recover.
   ``If they are worse off after Hugo then we have failed,'' he
said.
   Hurricane Hugo smashed into South Carolina on Sept. 21. It's 135
mph winds caused an estimated $5.9 billion damage and killed 29
people in South Carolina.
   One outreach worker said that in Williamsburg County, poor
families are living in homes with gaping holes in the roofs.
   Jim Liles said three families living in storm-damaged homes were
left homeless when the remainder of the structures burned down
because of kerosene heaters or faulty electric systems.
   Some of the rural poor have not applied for FEMA aid because
they are iliterate or are suspicious of the government bureaucracy,
said Glenice Pearson of the Urban League.
   Some, she said, are living in dilapidated rental structures that
landlords have shown little inclination to repair. She said there
is no need to keep the FEMA disaster centers open, but people
should be permitted to continue to apply for aid through state and
local agencies.
   FEMA's deadline already has been extended twice and officials
say it is unlikely to do so again.
   McLawhorn said many hurricane victims think responsibility for
the recovery rests with FEMA. He said the agency has done a good
job, but, ``The buck for the Hugo recovery doesn't stop with FEMA.
   ``We can't blame FEMA. We, individually and collectively, are
going to be held responsible for this recovery,'' he added.

<HEAD>Citizens Regain Unlimited Access to Tiananmen; But Soldiers Out In

<TEXT>
   Communist authorities today gave people unlimited
access to Tiananmen Square for the first time since they crushed
the pro-democracy movement, but hundreds of soldiers marched
through it in a show of force.
   The familiar appearance of troops on the huge plaza, which
student-led protesters virtually took over last spring, reminded
Beijing residents of the lethal force authorities used to clear it
in June.
   Although the government lifted martial law on the city
Wednesday, a spokesman said today there will be a ``small
increase'' in troops stationed in the capital and its suburbs.
   Yuan Mu told a news conference the troops were needed ``to
safeguard public security and peaceful work of the people.'' He did
not say how many troops were involved. An estimated 150,000 moved
into the city last summer.
   More than seven months of martial law in the city ended at
midnight Wednesday. In announcing the change, Premier Li Peng said
the decision to order troops to smash the pro-democracy movement
had been ``timely, necessary and correct.''
   The lifting of martial law was welcomed in the United States,
Britain, Japan and other Western nations that have said normal ties
cannot be restored until Beijing eases what the countries consider
repressive policies.
   However, the end of martial law will have little effect on life
in the city. Police replaced military guards on Beijing streets in
October and anti-demonstration laws remain in effect. Students also
remain under heavy surveillance.
   Chinese citizens had not had free access to Tiananmen Square
since June 3-4, when soldiers killed hundreds of civilians on their
way to clearing the 100-acre plaza of pro-democracy protesters.
   The square was closed after the massacre and gradually reopened;
until today, soldiers and police had screened all visitors and the
square was closed at night.
   Shortly before noon, up to 1,000 troops camped in the history
museum on the east side of the square marched across the plaza,
chanting and singing military songs. They disappeared into a walled
compound on the other side of the Great Hall of the People west of
Tiananmen.
   ``I thought martial law was over,'' said one of the several
thousand people strolling around Tiananmen.
   People also watched workmen remove barricades to widen access to
the square, and lined up to have their pictures taken by
professional photographers, back in business for the first time in
months.
   Steps to the revolutionary martyrs' monument in the center of
the square, students' headquarters during their three-week
occupation of Tiananmen, were not open to the public as before. Two
armed police stood guard at the monument.
   ``It's good that things are back to normal,'' said a women from
Inner Mongolia, touring the square with her child.
   But one middle-aged man from Nanjing said, ``We don't have happy
feelings'' about the lifting of martial law. He said people now
cannot speak out. ``We have to keep things in our hearts.''
   ``We haven't forgotten the students,'' said a Beijing teacher.
   Premier Li, in a 10-minute speech delivered on national
television Wednesday evening, said that by calling in the army last
spring the government had saved China from ``the abyss of misery.''
   He said martial law, which he ordered on May 20, could be lifted
because ``China is now stable politically, economically and
socially.'' But, he added, the party had not softened its
opposition to ``attempts to subvert the socialist system.''
   The People's Daily said today in a front-page editorial: ``We
must never drop our guard'' in the face of continued threats from
``international reactionary elements.''
   The masses must be educated in patriotism, collectivism and
socialism ``and we should give timely and forceful blows to the
reactionary forces' destructive activities,'' it said.
   The government refers to the student-led protests as a
``counterrevolutionary rebellion'' aimed at overthrowing the
Communist Party and the socialist system.
   Premier Li imposed martial law in Beijing for the first time in
40 years of Communist rule after hundreds of thousands of people
took to the streets in May to demand democratic reforms and an end
to official corruption.
   The decision was met by widespread resistance, with tens of
thousands of Beijing residents setting up barricades to block troop
convoys from entering the city.
   Then troops shot their way into the city and crushed the
demonstrations.
   The government has since launched a nationwide campaign to crush
dissent. It has arrested thousands and required millions of
students and workers to undergo the most intense political
indoctrination since the ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
   Beijing streets and college campuses remained quiet after Li's
speech Wednesday night. Several students said the lifting of
martial law made no difference, and noted that tight campus
security would remain.

<HEAD>Mother Charged in Daughter's Suicide Goes to Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman convicted of driving her
teen-age daughter to suicide by forcing her to work as a striptease
dancer has begun serving a one-year jail term after a judge denied
her request for house arrest.
   Broward Circuit Judge Arthur J. Franza on Wednesday ordered
Theresa Jackson to begin her sentence immediately.
   Ms. Jackson's daughter, 17-year-old Tina Mancini, shot herself
to death in March 1986 in their Coral Springs home.
   Last month, a state appeals court upheld Ms. Jackson's 1987
convictions on charges of mental child abuse, forgery and procuring
a sexual performance by a child.
   Ms. Jackson altered her daughter's identification and ordered
her to perform at nude bars, then collected most of the earnings,
according to testimony at her trial, believed to be the first in
which a person was charged with mental child abuse in connection
with a suicide.
   After serving the jail term, Ms. Jackson will be under house
arrest for two years followed by three years of probation.
   Ms. Jackson, 43, who worked as a cab driver while she remained
free on $4,500 bond during her appeal, described herself Wednesday
as a ``very loving, caring, kind and giving'' mother. But she
conceded others might not agree.
   Those who doubt her, she said, ``don't know the truth.'' She
said she is writing a book on her daughter's suicide and the
circumstamces leading up to it.
   Ms. Jackson maintained that her daughter wanted to work as a
dancer, and that she was unable to stop her.
   Last year, a judge approved an agreement between the state and
Ms. Jackson requiring her to share with the state and with her
18-year-old son whatever money she might earn from her story.
   Ms. Jackson said Wednesday that she misses her daughter.
   ``I think the emotional scars a suicide victim leaves behind are
worse than the suicide itself,'' she said. ``It's not fair. They're
in peace, and you're still thinking about them.''

<TEXT>
   Deposed dictator Manuel Noriega was
friendly to airmen who flew him to jail in Miami, even autographing
their flight chart, says the commander of Air Force units that
spearheaded the invasion of Panama.
   The Defense Department lifted a blackout Wednesday on
information about special forces that participated in Operation
Just Cause, and Col. George Gray III, commander of the 1st Special
Operations Wing headquartered at this Florida Panhandle base, spoke
at lenght with reporters at a news conference.
   Gray said his AC-130 Spectre gunships took only 10 minutes to
demolish Noriega's headquarters. Twenty-five special operations
planes and helicopters participated in the invasion, Gray said,
including the MC-130 Combat Talon that flew Noriega out of Panama.
   ``He was very friendly towards the crew,'' Gray said. Noriega
wrote ``Happy voyage'' in Spanish on the flight chart and then
signed it ``M. Noriega.''
   More than 500 personnel and all of the aircraft except two
gunships already stationed in Panama were deployed from Hurlburt
and adjacent Eglin Air Force Base. Gray said about 200 of his
troops remain in Panama but their primary mission was completed
Dec. 20, the first day of the invasion.
   ``We essentially spearheaded the operation,'' Gray said. ``We
were to be there first to knock out Mr. Noriega's command and
control and to eliminate any threats to our aircraft involved in
airdropping the (Army) Rangers'' at two airfields.
   The U.S. planes knocked out anti-aircraft artillery at the three
targets, he said.
   Gray's airmen suffered no combat casualties and the only damage
was a single small-arms round that struck one of the aircraft.
   He declined to say how many gunships were used in the assault on
the headquarters of the Panama Defense Forces, known as the
Comandancia, but 11 AC-130s were involved in the overall operation.
   He said the gunships had only 10 minutes to accomplish their
mission at the Comandancia, blasting it with 105 mm Howitzers and
rapid-fire 40 mm cannons, before ground forces arrived.
   There were reports of extensive damage and some casualties in
the surrounding neighborhood, also attacked by artillery from the
ground.
   ``The rules of engagement for us were very, very clear: absolute
minimum civilian casualties, absolute minimum collateral damage,''
Gray said. ``And the only way to do that is by employing a surgical
firepower platform such as the AC-130. All rounds were on target
within the Comandancia.''
   Gray said the firepower demonstrated by the gunships, armed
versions of the C-130 transport, probably intimidated other
Panamanian troops into surrendering.
   ``After they saw the destruction of the Comandancia, I think
they very quickly realized they didn't want to take us on,'' Gray
said. ``We gave them the opportunity to surrender. We would pay
them a visit and they chose to surrender.''
   The gunships probably saved many American lives, Gray said. But
some lives may have been lost because one of the planes had to
return to Hurlburt with problems in its fire control equipment.
   Overall, Gray said of his units' performance, ``It was done
absolutely to perfection. If I had to do everything again I
probably wouldn't have changed anything.''

   The cast of ``Les Miserables'' got caught with
its pants down when costumes from one scene in the musical were
accidentally thrown in the garbage.
   The costumes were placed in plastic trash bags Sunday to be
taken to the cleaners. But an employee of the Benedum Center for
Performing Arts, where the touring show of the Broadway musical is
being performed, mistakenly added those bags to the theater's
garbage and all of it was taken to the dump Tuesday.
   Actors wear raggedy outfits typical of clothing worn by street
rebels from the French Revolution. The wardrobe director, Jerry
Wolf, confirmed the costumes _ worth about $50,000 _ were discarded
inadvertently.
   The show went on as scheduled without the costumes, and
replacement clothing was sent from New York.

   Some of the nation's most formidable courtroom
warriors are being lured to the legal battle of Manuel Noriega,
drawn by the klieg lights focused on what could be one of the great
trials of the era.
   They include defense attorneys who have worked some famous cases
of the last decade, with clients such as New York subway gunman
Bernhard Goetz, reputed Mafia chieftain John Gotti and an army
officer allegedly linked to the assassination of El Salvador's
archbishop.
   ``Manuel Noriega may or may not have a trial, but he should be
assured the best the American justice system allows,'' said New
York attorney Barry Slotnick, who said he would decide this week
whether to join the case.
   The changes in the defense team appear to hinge on Slotnick, 50,
whose clients have included Goetz and Gotti.
   Slotnick said he was contacted by Noriega representatives and
asked to defend the deposed Panamanian dictator, who faces 145
years in prison and fines up to $1.1 million if convicted.
   A February 1988 indictment charges Noriega with taking $4.6
million in bribes from Colombian cocaine dealers to turn his nation
into a way station for smugglers.
   As co-counsel, Slotnick is seeking prominent Miami defense
attorney Neal Sonnett, who withdrew from the Noriega case earlier
this month, citing differences with other defense lawyers.
   Sonnett's clients have included Hernan Botero, a Colombian
extradited to Florida and convicted for laundering $56 million in
drug money; Lebanese-born arms dealer Sarkis Soghanalian, and
Alvaro Saravia, at one time sought for extradition to El Salvador,
where he was accused of complicity in the 1980 assassination of
Roman Catholic Archbishop Oscar Romero. The Salvadoran government
later dropped its request.
   Sonnett, 47, said Wednesday he would ``give high consideration''
to returning to the case with Slotnick.
   ``This case will present some of the most challenging issues
raised in an American court of law. It's any attorney's dream to be
part of it,'' said Sonnett, president of the National Association
of Criminal Defense Lawyers.
   Sonnett and Slotnick say they have no desire to oust Noriega's
present defense team, led by Frank Rubino and Steven Kollin. But
Sonnett, who objected to statements about the case by the other
defense attorneys, said clear lines of authority would be drawn if
he rejoined.
   While defense attorneys will not discuss how they will be
compensated, Slotnick said he will not represent Noriega for free.
   ``This case will require extensive resources and it will be
conducted in the great tradition of the American free enterprise
system ... we will get paid,'' he said.
   Kollin and Rubino did not return telephone calls to their
offices by The Associated Press on Wednesday.
   Houston lawyer Richard ``Racehorse'' Haynes also has been
contacted by an unidentified Noriega representative and is
considering joining the Noriega case.
   Haynes' assistant, Judy Fogarty, said there is no deadline for a
decision by Haynes, 62, who gained national attention for winning
two murder acquittals for Texas tycoon T. Cullen Davis in the
1970s. Davis was accused of shooting his estranged wife and killing
her lover and 12-year-old daughter.
   As for the prosecution, a Bush administration official told the
AP that Justice Department officials may give U.S. Attorney Dexter
Lehtinen the choice of running his office or taking the lead
prosecution role in Noriega's trial.
   A spokeswoman at Lehtinen's office, Diane Cossin, refused to
comment on the report, saying the team has not been announced.
   Noriega, 51, has been held in a basement apartment in the Miami
federal courthouse since arriving in the United States last
Thursday. He awaits a Jan. 26 bond hearing.

<HEAD>No-confidence Debate Opens in Sri Lanka</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition parties today debated the
first no-confidence motion against the president, accusing his
year-old government of failing to restore peace and condoning
violence by paramilitary groups.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa's United National Party was
expected to have no trouble defeating the motion in a vote expected
to take place Friday night.
   The motion was presented by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, which
is headed by former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike.
   Premadasa's party has 124 of Parliament's 225 seats. Mrs.
Bandaranaike's party and three other parties supporting the
no-confidence motion have a total of 84 seats.
   Most of the remaining seats are held by legislators who have
said they will not support the no-confidence motion.
   At least 6,500 people have been killed in Sri Lanka's ethnic and
political wars since Premadasa took office Jan. 2, 1989, according
to tallies kept by the military.
   The no-confidence motion said Premadasa's government had failed
to restore peace, order and normalcy. It accused the government of
permitting and encouraging illegal paramilitary groups to kidnap,
torture and murder civilians.
   The motion also charged that the government had mismanaged the
economy, ignored corruption and discriminated against political
opponents.
   The United National Party has been in power since 1977 when it
defeated Mrs. Bandaranaike's Freedom Party.
   In 1983, a revolt by Tamil separatists in northeastern Sri Lanka
plunged the once-idyllic island nation into a vicious spiral of
massacre, murder and mayhem.
   By 1987, efforts to make peace with the Tamil minority had
spawned a backlash by ultranationalist Sinhalese against their
fellow Sinhalese who control the government.
   More than 11,000 people have died in the 7-year-old Tamil war,
while at least 6,000 more have been killed in the past 2{ years in
the internal Sinhalese battle.
   Sinhalese account for 75 percent of the country's 16 million
people. Tamils comprise 18 percent and say the Sinhalese
discriminate against them in jobs, education and use of the Sinhala
language.

<HEAD>Soviets Begin Dismantling Border Fences with Romania</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet border guards have begun tearing down the
barbed wire barricades along the tightly controlled Romanian
border, a KGB official said.
   The official Tass news agency quoted Georgy Lavranchuk, head of
the KGB in the Soviet republic of Moldavia that borders Romania, as
saying Wednesday that about 30 miles of barbed wire had been
removed.
   Soviet and Romanian officials also are moving to eliminate the
border passes that previously were required, Tass said.
   ``From now on there is no need for special passes if residents
of border villages enter the frontier zone for rest and
recreation,'' Tass said.
   Crossing regulations have been simplified at seven border
points, it said, without identifying them.
   The moves came after Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze visited Bucharest on Jan. 6 and said that the two
sides would work quickly to dismantle border restrictions.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev warmly greeted the
revolution in December that threw out hard-line Romanian dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Romanians and ethnic Moldavians speak nearly the same language
and are members of the same ethnic group. But the border between
them has been among the most closely guarded in the East Bloc.
   Soviets discouraged close border contacts after the 1968 Warsaw
Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, in which Romania refused to take
part.
   In the past several years, as Gorbachev has reformed the Soviet
Union, Ceausescu restricted border contacts to keep Romanians from
seeing how poorly they lived compared to others.
   Shevardnadze said he had agreed with Romania's new leaders to
establish more liberal border crossing rules such as the Soviet
Union has with Hungary and Poland.
   In the past, relatives have been allowed to make visits across
the Romania-Soviet border only on special family occasions, such as
weddings and funerals. A few cultural figures and scholars also
have been allowed to make visits.
   The Tass report did not explain the new regulations. But it is
likely that they will require a minimum of paperwork to allow
people to cross the border.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vincent van Gogh's ``Irises,'' the world's most
expensive painting, is reportedly back on the block after the
businessman who bought it failed to pay off a loan from the auction
house that sold it.
   Australian businessman Alan Bond, who purchased ``Irises'' in
November 1987 for a record $53.9 million, has put it back on the
market, The New York Times said today.
   Bond bought the 1889 masterpiece with the help of a $27 million
loan from Sotheby's auction house, which handled the sale. The
one-year loan has not been paid off and has been extended twice,
the newspaper said.
   ``There are discussions going on regarding the sale of the
painting. They are going on directly with Mr. Bond,'' said Michael
Ainslie, president of Sotheby's Holdings Inc.
   ``We are having discussions with several parties,'' said Michael
Cross, managing director of Dallhold Investment Ltd., a privately
held company owned by Bond. ``We have received a great many
approaches but nothing is conclusive at this stage.''
   Ainslie also said Sotheby's will no longer extend loans to art
buyers using the artworks they purchase as collateral.
   ``Irises'' was used as collateral on the loan that helped Bond
buy the painting, an arrangement criticized by dealers and
collectors for driving up art prices.
   The loan arrangement was disclosed by Cross in October. By that
time, Sotheby's reportedly had moved the painting to a secret
location. The disclosure of the loan and the fact that Bond didn't
have ``Irises'' in his possession shocked the art community, the
Times said.
   The report that the painting is for sale comes at a time when
Bond's corporate empire has outstanding debts of more than $5
billion, the newspaper said.
   The sale of ``Irises'' for the record price was viewed at the
time as a great boost to the financial well-being of the art market
after the Wall Street collapse of Oct. 19, 1987.

   A college student who says he released
the emergency brake on a pizza delivery car blocking a fraternity
house driveway drew a year in jail for the death of a woman hit by
the runaway vehicle.
   Brett B. Weinstein, a 21-year-old West Virginia University honor
student from King of Prussia, Pa., was also fined $1,500 Wednesday
by Circuit Judge Larry Starcher after a no-contest plea to
involuntary manslaughter and battery.
   Jennifer Ann Wehner, 19, of Chappaqua, N.Y., a WVU freshman, was
killed in April when the delivery car careened down a hill and
struck her in front of a dormitory. Two other young women were
injured.
   Weinstein said he had released the brake and put the gearshift
in neutral to move the vehicle from the driveway.
   The judge said the WVU finance senior would be allowed to leave
jail to attend class but must return shortly after his last class
each day. Weinstein could become eligible for release after 10
months.
   Wehner's parents have filed a $10 million lawsuit against
Weinstein, his parents and the pizza business.

<HEAD>Government Promises Investigation Into Writer's Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A senior Politburo member has promised an
investigation into the 1978 slaying of a prominent emigre writer
who died after he was jabbed by a poison-tipped umbrella in London.
   Politburo member Alexander Lilov made the pledge after meeting
Wednesday with Annabel Markov, the widow of writer Georgi Markov.
   Mrs. Markov said her husband's slaying was ``one of the darkest
crimes of the Cold War'' and that she wants Communist authorities
to take responsibility.
   Lilov is among the reformers who have assumed control since the
Nov. 10 ouster of hard-line Communist leader Todor Zhivkov.
   Zhivkov, who once received Markov in his villas and hunting
lodges, was in power when Markov was murdered nine years after the
author defected while on a trip to Italy in 1969. There has long
been speculation that the orders to kill Markov came from Sofia.
   Asked if Lilov said Bulgaria's former hard-line leaders were
linked to her husband's death, Mrs. Markov replied:
   ``There was not a specific admission. But he said this had been
a terrible time for Bulgaria, and things had happened that
shouldn't have happened.''
   The British native said she is not seeking any kind of
retribution. ``I just want them to admit responsibility for what
they've done.''
   Mrs. Markov said she felt confident the government would
investigate.
   Many hard-line Communists remain in power, but Bulgaria's new
leaders have promised democratic reforms and are trying to cast off
the country's Stalinist image. A special parliamentary commission
already has said it has enough evidence to proceed with an
investigation of Zhivkov on suspicion of diverting state funds into
Swiss bank accounts.
   Bulgaria's ambassador in London said Tuesday that his country
would finally investigate the death of Markov, one of Bulgaria's
foremost authors before his murder in London on Sept. 29, 1978.
   British investigators concluded that Markov, who worked for the
British Broadcasting Corp.'s Bulgarian service, was killed by
poison injected through an umbrella tip as he waited for a bus on
London's Westminster Bridge. Before he fell into a coma, Markov
told friends he had been jabbed from behind.
   The author had made public comments highly critical of Zhivkov's
rule before his death. Vladimir Kostov, an outspoken emigre in
Paris, survived what he says was a similar attempt to kill him with
a poison pellet.
   Lilov also pledged that Bulgaria for the first time will publish
Markov's posthumously collected memoirs, ``The Truth That Killed,''
Mrs. Markov said.
   The book, already published in the United States and Britain, is
a collection of essays that testify to the psychological and moral
damage inflicted by Stalinism in Bulgaria.
   ``His memoirs are like a document of what 35 years of
totalitarian rule did to the country,'' Mrs. Markov said.

   Nicolae Ceausescu threatened army
commanders at their final meeting with execution for ignoring
orders to kill protesters, and a newspaper report today said that
he offered more than $5 million to be freed when he was later
captured by revolutionists.
   According to the minutes of the Dec. 17 meeting, the dictator
berated his top men for shooting blanks at the crowds in the
western city of Timisoara.
   ``They've got to kill the hooligans, not to beat them,'' the
hard-line Communist leader said angrily.
   Ceausescu's wife, Elena, told the meeting the protesters should
be hurled into the basement jails of the Securitate, the secret
police, and never again ``see the light'' of day.
   A transcript of stenographers' notes from the meeting _ what
turned out to be the Communist Party Politburo's last gathering _
was published Wednesday in the daily newspaper, Romania Libera.
   Ceausescu was overthrown on Dec. 22 when army troops and
citizens rebelled against him, and he was executed along with his
wife on Christmas Day.
   The official Rompres news agency today quoted Silviu Brucan, a
senior member of the new government, as saying about 10,000 people
died in revolutionary clashes in Timisoara, Bucharest, Sibiu,
Brasov and other cities.
   Western diplomats in Bucharest, citing witnesses and other
accounts, also said earlier that about 10,000 had been killed.
   According to the minutes, Defense Minister Vasile Milea,
Interior Minister Tudor Postelnicu and chief of the Securitate
secret police Iulian Vlad first tried to reason with Ceausescu,
then pledged to carry out his orders.
   Milea, originally reported to have committed suicide several
days after the meeting, later was found to have been slain by
Ceausescu henchmen. Postelnicu and Vlad are under arrest and
awaiting trial, along with hundreds of other Ceausescu underlings.
   Crowds in Timisoara had broken into the local party headquarters
on Dec. 16, and troops armed only with truncheons and blank
ammunition had been unable _ or unwilling _ to stop them.
   Troops issued live ammunition later fired at the unarmed
protesters, causing the outrage and revulsion of a nation that
endured 24 years of Ceausescu's repression and harsh economic
policy.
   According to the minutes, Ceausescu at times seemed to lose
control of his emotions as he criticized the army commanders for
not following his orders to fire on the crowds.
   ``I didn't think you would shoot with blanks, that is like a
rain shower,'' Ceausescu said. ``Those who entered the party
building should not leave the building alive.''
   The notes showed that Milea, Postelnicu and Vlad became
submissive when he accused them of treason and threatened to have
them shot.
   ``I have told you that all have to be armed,'' Ceausescu shouted
at Postelnicu. ``Who has given this order? When I understand that
Securitate troops are going somewhere, it is clear to me that they
are going armed. You send them to fight with fists, what kind of
interior units are you?''
   The 71-year-old dictator's fury appeared to peak when told by
Milea that he had decided not to supply army units facing the
Timisoara demonstrators with ammunition.
   ``Why didn't you give them ammunition? If you don't give them
ammunition, you might as well keep them at home. What kind of
defense minister are you, what kind of interior minister are you,
Postelnicu? They received orders to fight and not to go on
maneuvers.''
   ``A few hooligans want to destroy socialism, and you make it
child's play for them!'' Ceausescu shouted. ``You do not quiet an
enemy by talking with him like a priest, but by burning him.''
   Mrs. Ceausescu spoke little but expressed her contempt of the
defiant Timisoara protesters.
   ``You should shoot them so they fall, and put them in
(Securitate) basements,'' she said. ``Not even one should see the
light (of day) again.''
   As the revolution flickered fitfully in Timisoara, she and her
husband alternately berated and threatened Milea, Postelnicu and
Vlad to try to get their support.
   ``They are cowards,'' Mrs. Ceausescu said.
   ``They are more than cowards,'' Ceausescu said. ``As supreme
commander, I consider that you have committed treason against the
country's supreme interests, and against the people's interest and
against the interests of socialism.
   ``Do you know what I'm going to do with you?'' he said. ``Send
you to the firing squad!''
   The historic record of the meeting vividly underlined the
control exercised by the Ceausescus over the party, whose apparatus
constructed a personality cult reminiscent of Josef Stalin.
   Few other of the 25 other leading functionaries present spoke as
the Ceausescus vented their anger. When they did, it was submissive.
   After his later flight from the capital, Ceausescu promised one
of the two uniformed policemen who captured him and his wife $5
million to release them, the daily Adevarul said.
   It quoted Col. Gen. Jean Moldoveanu, the deputy interior
minister, as saying, ``At a certain time, Ceausescu promised the
non-commissioned officer $5 million ... I repeat, $5 million,'' to
let them escape.
   ``Seeing that the policeman remained unmoved, the tyrant raised
the price, promising him more than $5 million,'' Moldoveanu
reportedly said without specifying the sum.

   Police charged a man with kidnapping and
raping a young woman who said she was entombed overnight in a
9-foot-deep hole ventilated by a pipe.
   William R. Grau, a 48-year-old man neighbors describe as a
loner, was arrested Wednesday and awaited a bail hearing today.
   The 19-year-old woman said Grau threw her into a hole he had dug
that measured 4 feet wide and had a thick plastic glass cover, a
ladder and a lightbulb strung on wire, according to sheriff's
spokesman Jack Espinosa.
   ``You can only imagine what this must have looked like to this
girl, this hole in the dark and fog,'' Espinosa said. ``It's like a
ladder to your grave.''
   She said she was abducted from her mobile home, sexually
assaulted, bound hand and foot, gagged and buried in a nine-hour
ordeal that began Tuesday night.
   She escaped when her captor pulled her out and dragged her
toward a ditch on a swampy, wooded property in nearby Thonotosassa,
authorities said.
   The woman found her way back home. She sought treatment for
trauma, cuts and bruises.

<HEAD>State Says Celebrated Giant Frogs Not Welcome in California</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An animal collector who wants to enter
Goliath African frogs in Calaveras County's frog jump says
California's import restrictions won't stop him from bringing in
his 10 mighty leapers.
   State officials said Wednesday that Andy J. Koffman's 3-foot
frogs would be unwelcome, a ruling likely to come as a relief to
entrants in the contest inspired by the Mark Twain story ``The
Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County.''
   The Goliath African frogs, which weigh up to 12 pounds, can
clear 30 feet in a single bound, while the record leap in past Frog
Jumping Jubilees is 21 feet, 5} inches _ in three hops.
   ``Under the Fish and Game code, those species are considered
undesirable and prohibited from import,'' said Lenny Clavecilla, a
spokesman for the California Fish and Game Department.
   Clavecilla said Koffman will need permits to bring the frogs
into the state, ``and we wouldn't be inclined to issue them for
that purpose.'' The frogs could loose in the wild and harm native
wildlife, he said.
   But Koffman called the restrictions ``bureaucratic nonsense''
and he said he was determined to enter his frogs in the 62-year-old
jubilee in May in Angels Camp, a community in the Sierra Nevada
foothills 150 miles east of San Francisco.
   ``I've been a licensed importer in this country probably longer
than they've been bureaucrats,'' he said.
   Jubilee officials, who are scheduled to consider the issue
Friday, have expressed fears that the sharp-toothed frogs could
leap off the stage and into someone's lap.
   Moreover, they believe the African frogs would be unfair
competition for the domestic variety. The record jump was set by a
normal-size frog named Rosie the Ribiter in 1986.
   Interim fair manager Diane Baumann said the state's position may
make local action moot.
   ``It definitely takes us off the hook, but it sort of ruins the
whole issue,'' she said. ``Let's face it, we're getting a lot of
publicity out of this.''

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh today announced
major concessions intended to end Sikh separatism in Punjab state
but told tens of thousands of Sikhs and Hindus he has no ``magic
wand'' to bring peace to the region.
   Singh said Sikh deserters from the Indian army will be given
employment in other government organizations and that the
detentions of jailed Sikhs will be reviewed. These have been key
demands in the Sikh movement.
   Hundreds of Sikh soldiers mutinied when the army attacked the
Golden Temple, Sikhism's holiest shrine, in 1984. There were
hundreds of deserters.
   The number of Sikh detainees is not known, but it is easily in
the hundreds and possibly thousands.
   Singh spoke at a public rally in the Punjab city of Ludhiana
that the government organized as part of its movement to restore
peace in the state.
   ``When blood flows in Punjab, it is the country's heart that
bleeds,'' Singh said. ``I have not come here with a magic wand. The
solution is not in the corridors of New Delhi but in the
wheatfields of Punjab.''
   A resolution adopted at the end of the three-hour rally said:
``Violence and the use of coercive methods must be put (to) an end
and security of life and property and respect for human rights for
all must be exercised.''
   The rebellion in the agriculturally rich state on India's border
with Pakistan began in 1982, when Sikh militants accused the
majority Hindu community of discrimination.
   ``The rally will mobilize people of Punjab to quash secessionist
efforts,'' said Foreign Minister Inder Kumar Gujral, a key figure
in the government's moves to end the Sikh campaign, which has
claimed thousands of lives and kept the state in turmoil.
   Gujral, who was elected to Parliament from Punjab, is a Hindu
widely respected among Sikhs.
   Today's rally was held on the grounds of a college. People began
streaming to the site an hour before the meeting began and
continued to pour in hours after politicians started speaking.
   Police officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, estimated
the crowd at 100,000. Many came from villages around Ludhiana, a
city of 800,000 known for its garment and bicycle factories.
   The Punjab state police chief, K.P.S. Gill, said: ``There is
absolute tight security. We are prepared for anything. No problem.''
   The ground was surrounded by about 5,000 policemen, many on
horseback.
   The rally was Singh's second effort to bring peace to Punjab
since he replaced Rajiv Gandhi as prime minister.
   Singh was sworn in as prime minister on Dec. 2 after Gandhi's
Congress Party failed to win a majority in the Nov. 22-26 general
elections.
   Singh had called a meeting of all political parties in New Delhi
on Dec. 17 to discuss the Punjab problem. But the Akali Dal, a
semi-religious Sikh party, did not attend, saying the effort was
futile.
   A consensus statement issued by about 40 leaders at the meeting
condemned ``terrorism'' in Punjab, but the Congress Party
disassociated itself from the statement, saying the party was not
consulted when the statement was drafted.
   The Akali Dal party, which the separatists tacitly support, and
Gandhi's Congress Party refused to attend today's meeting.
   But Akali Dal leader Simranjit Singh Mann received Singh when he
landed at an airfield near Ludhiana.
   ``It is courtesy to receive the prime minister when he comes to
your house,'' said Mann, who spent five years in jail on charges of
sedition and being involved in the 1984 assassination of Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi.
   Sikh bodyguards killed Mrs. Gandhi in retaliation for her
decision that year to raid the Golden Temple, where militant Sikhs
were holed up. More than 2,000 people, mostly Sikhs, died in the
raid.

<HEAD>Recall Drive Against Gay School Board Member Fails</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FREMONT, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A recall drive against a gay school board
member in this San Francisco suburb failed when organizers were
unable to gather enough signatures to put the measure on the June
ballot.
   But even as Robert Stipicevich congratulated residents for ``not
succumbing to fear,'' his opponents said they would press on with
an effort to defeat him in the November election.
   ``It's not a defeat, it's a minor setback,'' said Ron Smith,
spokesman for the Fremont Family Alliance, which opposed what it
called the board member's ``advocacy of a homosexual lifestyle.''
   The group said it had failed to gather 12,219 signatures by
Wednesday's deadline but declined to reveal how many were
collected. The town has a population of more than 130,000.
   Stipicevich, 26, was one of the youngest elected officials in
the state when he won a school board seat in 1985. He disclosed his
homosexuality at a news conference in May, saying he was tired of
others' whispering behind his back.
   Recall backers accused him of defrauding voters by not
disclosing his homosexuality earlier, but Stipicevich maintained
the recall campaign stemmed from misconceptions and hysteria.
   ``Fremont is not a blue-collar, backwater town,'' he said. ``It
is a progressive community and this (the recall) was a growing
pain. ... The only thing Family Alliance succeeded in doing was
making my name a household word.''
   Stipicevich said he has not decided whether to seek re-election.

   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of
France today pledged help for this country's shattered economy
during the first visit by a Western foreign minister since the
overthrow of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   The French official, who arrived Wednesday as a guest of Foreign
Minister Sergiu Celac, said in an airport statement that he carried
``feelings of admiration for what the Romanian people have done,
knowing how to free themselves of the dictatorship,'' the official
Rompres news agency reported.
   ``France, which has been on Romania's side since the very first
day in this time of trial, is still with her in everything we can
do to be together,'' the Romanian agency quoted Dumas as saying.
   France and Romania have strong historical ties. Before World War
II, many Romanians went to France to study, and French was the main
foreign language spoken in the country.
   Rompres said that during today's talks with interim President
Ion Iliescu, Dumas conveyed a message from President Francois
Mitterrand pledging France's material and moral support for the
``consolidation of the conquests of the popular revolution and for
political stability in Romania.''
   Iliescu reportedly thanked France, but no details of any new aid
for the ailing centralized economy were announced.
   Late last year, a bloody revolution by pro-democracy forces
overthrew the 24-year rule of Ceausescu, the hard-line Communist
leader. He and his wife Elena, his second in command, were executed
on Christmas Day.

   The re-election of former Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi to Parliament has been challenged in court by the
candidate he defeated in voting marred by violence and fraud
charges, news reports said today.
   Rajmohan Gandhi, grandson of independence leader Mohandas K.
Gandhi, filed a petition Wednesday in Lucknow saying the former
prime minister's campaign workers resorted to terror, bribery and
abuse of power during November's balloting, according to reports in
The Statesman and other newspapers.
   ``My petition alleges that the election was conducted in
defiance of all rules and regulations and of every democratic
norm,'' The Statesman quoted the losing candidate as saying when he
left the court building in Lucknow. The two Gandhis are not related.
   The challenger asked the High Court of the state of Uttar
Pradesh to declare the poll invalid and hold new elections. No date
was given for further court action.
   After an investigation of the Nov. 24 voting in the two
candidates' Amethi constitutency, the Election Commission threw out
thousands of ballots and ordered a partial repoll in the poor rural
district 60 miles southeast of Lucknow.
   The revote was ordered after Rajmohan Gandhi and his Janata Dal
Party complained of widespread voter fraud and intimidation by
supporters of Rajiv Gandhi and his Congress Party.
   In the most dramatic confrontation, a local Janata Dal leader
was seriously wounded when he was shot in the stomach during a
dispute with Congress Party workers on election day.
   In the final vote count, Rajiv Gandhi won 270,471 votes to
Rajmohan Gandhi's 69,099.
   Nationwide, the elections were the most violent in India's 42
years of independence. At least 140 people died across the country
during the voting.
   The Congress Party lost control of the goverment, and V. P.
Singh of the National Front alliance came to power as prime
minister. Rajiv Gandhi was relegated to the role of opposition
leader in Parliament.

   Communist Premier Hans Modrow today indicated
that opposition groups could join his governing coalition, which
has been shaken by threats of a walkout by three traditionally
allied parties.
   But Modrow defended an unpopular plan to set up a successor to
the hated secret police network before multiparty elections on May
6.
   The allied parties threatened to leave the coalition, and other
pro-democracy opposition groups threatened to break off talks on
the government's future after hearing that a new secret police
organization would be formed.
   ``In the interests of our country's citizens, there cannot be a
security vacuum,'' Modrow told Parliament. As a partial concession,
Modrow offered to have Parliament supervise the planned new
internal security agency and the dissolution of its predecessor,
popularly known as ``Stasi.''
   He also said the government would suspend a plan to give state
support, such as pensions, to former secret police, a proposal that
had provoked warning strikes from factory workers in recent days.
   Earlier today, Parliament ousted the head of the state security
police, Lt. Gen. Wolfgang Schwanitz, and appointed a new chief
prosecutor. It also voted out several old-guard Communists and
other members of the 500-seat legislature, including Guenther
Schabowski, a former Politburo member.
   In his nearly 90-minute address, Modrow told the opposition to
make suggestions about how ``it would be prepared to participate
directly and responsibly in the work of the government.'' Modrow
did not say when or in exactly what form such participation could
take place.
   In Bonn, the West German government welcomed Modrow's speech for
``beginnings that could lead further.'' But government spokesman
Dieter Vogel said much depends on how much government access Modrow
actually gives the reform groups.
   Modrow also called on the opposition to offer its ideas on new
legislation, including a draft election law. That proposal, which
would formally authorize the May 6 vote, has drawn fire from the
reform groups and West Germany for containing a ban on all campaign
aid from abroad.
   Opponents charge this would greatly help the Communists, who
still control state media and essentials such as paper supplies and
copying machines.
   Opposition groups planned to form a human chain around the
Parliament building tonight to protest what they perceive as the
coalition government's reluctance to make democratic reforms.
Modrow rejected that charge and said the oppostion should not issue
ultimatums.
   The opposition Social Democrats today demanded Modrow allow
opposition leaders to join in talks with West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl.
   Modrow rejected the opposition's questioning of his authority to
rule. ``I cannot recall becoming premier through a coup,'' he said.
   Modrow reportedly was considering calling for a national
referendum on his government before the election, but he did not
mention that in his speech to Parliament. In reviewing his first
eight weeks in office, Modrow said ``the aim is not to maintain the
old structure'' of the hated secret police, which the government
has promised to dismantle.
   Many East Germans appeared to be worried about the continued
political turmoil in their nation and the Communist in turn are
worrying about their chances in the May elections.
   The political infighting is the most serious setback since
Modrow's caretakr government was seated in mid-November,
compounding the problems of a sagging economy, a continuing exodus
to the West and labor strikes.
   East Germany has seen major changes since the Oct. 18 ouster of
hard-line leader Erich Honecker. But Communist control of the
country remains strong, and many promises made by the new leaders
still have not become law.
   Leading the list is the proposed law that will actually
authorize the May 6 elections, the first free voting in the
country's 40-year history.
   The Christian Democrats and the Liberal Democrats, two of the
current coalition partners, said Wednesday that they would quit
Modrow's Cabinet if the new law fails to meet their demands.
   Together, the Christian Democrats and Liberal Democrats have
seven seats in the 28-member Cabinet. The National Democrats,
another non-Communist party with two seats, have also threatened to
desert Modrow.
   Party leaders on Wednesday also cited the re-establishment of
the secret police as a reason to pull out.

   A man with a knife slashed a painting by the 16th
century Italian artist Federico Baroccio at the National Gallery,
officials said. He was ordered today to stand trial on charges of
causing criminal damage.
   The state-funded gallery, home of some of the greatest art
treasures in Britain, said in a statement that the painting _ ``The
Madonna and Child with St. Joseph and the Infant Baptist'' _ was
cut in nine places in Wednesday's attack.
   Guards wrestled the knife from the assailant, identified as
Martin Came, 27. No hometown was provided.
   The National Gallery said its conservation and restoration
department will take ``maybe more than a year'' to repair the
painting, which measures 44 inches by 36 inches and is said to be
worth at least $1.6 million.
   ``At the moment, we believe that complete restoration will be
possible,'' said a gallery spokeswoman who refused to be identified.
   Came appeared at Bow Street Magistrates Court today on charges
of causing criminal damage and was ordered to stand trial Feb. 1
pending medical reports from a western England hospital where he
has undergone unspecified treatment.
   Baroccio, or Barocci as he is sometimes known, worked at the
same time as Michelangelo. Baroccio spent most of his time in the
Italian city of Urbino but the two men met in Rome in the 1550s and
Michelangelo encouraged the younger artist with his work.
   The damaged painting had been on display since it was bequeathed
to the gallery in 1831.
   Gallery experts refused to estimate its value. But a lesser
known work by the same artist sold for $209,160 at Christie's
auctioneers last year.
   Britain's domestic news agency, Press Association, said the
painting, has been valued at $1.6-4.8 million.
   But art critic Brian Sewell said the painting could fetch as
much as $25 million. Baroccio was ``monumentally influential in his
time ... and none of his work that is really authentic has come on
the market for donkey's years,'' he said.
   In 1987, a man with a shotgun blasted one of the gallery's
greatest treasures, Leonardo da Vinci's drawing The Virgin and
Child with St. Anne and St. John the Baptist, as it hung on show.
   The da Vinci drawing underwent an intricate 15-month restoration
and is now back on show. The gunman, Robert Cambridge, age 38 at
the time, was ordered to be held indefinitely at Broadmoor hospital
for the criminally insane when he appeared at London's Old Bailey
Central Criminal Court in June 1988.

   Georgie Auld, a saxophonist who
played with Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw and taught actor Robert De
Niro how to hold the instrument for the movie ``New York, New
York'' has died at age 70.
   Auld died at his home Monday of lung cancer.
   He was born John Altwerger in Toronto, Canada. A self-taught
saxophonist who did not read music, he was still a teen-ager when
he hooked up with Bunny Berigan in 1937.
   He joined with Shaw in 1938 and in 1940 joined Goodman's sextet,
playing alongside jazz legends such as Cootie Williams, Charlie
Christian and Count Basie.
   In the 1940s, he briefly led his own band, which featured
soloists including Sarah Vaughan, Erroll Garner, Dizzy Gillespie
and Billy Butterfield.
   Auld also appeared during the 1940s in a Broadway play about a
musician and a dance-hall hostess, ``The Rat Race,'' playing a
saxophonist.
   Nearly 30 years later, he helped De Niro portray a saxophonist
in ``New York, New York.'' Auld was the principal soloist on the
soundtrack and had a cameo in the 1977 picture as a bandleader.
   By 1975 he had recorded nearly 20 albums.
   Auld is survived by two brothers and a sister.
   Funeral arrangements were not immediately known.

   A police airplane carrying five people,
including two officials of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,
was reported missing on a flight from northern Chile to Santiago,
authorities said today.
   Authorities said there was no indication of sabotage. No
guerrillas are believed to operate in the areas the plane flew over.
   The American officials were identified as John Harty and Patrick
Pouzar. The FDA officials arrived in Chile on Saturday to
investigate security measures taken by Chilean authorities in
handling fruit for export to the United States.
   Police said the two-engine Cessna 206 disappeared Wednesday
after taking off at 5:20 p.m. from Copiapo, a city 500 miles to the
north. The plane was due to land 9:10 p.m. at Tobalaba airport in
Santiago.
   In Washington, FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit said Harty, of Silver
Spring, Md., is director of the agency's international affairs
staff in the FDA's Office of Health Affairs in Rockville, Md.
   Nesbit said Pouzar is director of investigations in the FDA's
Nashville, Tenn., district office and lives in Nashville.
   Nesbit said the two had visited several fruit-processing
facilities in northern Chile. They left the United States on Friday
and were expected back Monday, said Bill Oates, acting director of
the Nashville office.
   The spokesman said the Chilean foreign minister informed the
U.S. Embassy in Santiago at 11:30 p.m. Wednesday that the men's
plane was two hours overdue. There has been no electronic
communication with the plane since then, he said.
   The Chileans on board are Oscar Badilla, a government
agricultural official; Sergio Lazcano, an executive of the Fruit
Exporters Association; and an unidentified pilot, police officer
German Fuentes said.
   Police said a wide search for the missing airplane was in
progress this morning, involving police and air force planes.
   The FDA officials were in Chile to check security in the Chilean
fruit exports process after two grapes laced with cyanide were
found in Philadelphia last year. The finding prompted a temporary
suspension of the sale of all Chilean fruits in the United States.

   Homewood Library is suggesting a limit on
the number of books patrons check out _ at least 10.
   The library is about to move into a new building, and to help
save on moving costs, officials are asking residents to check out
as many of the library's 93,000 volumes as possible.
   ``They won't be due until after the new library opens Feb. 14.
We want people to bring them back there,'' said administrative
librarian Larry Gelfius.
   Ground was broken in 1988 on the $3 million library that will
more than double the space of the current building, built in 1961.
   To assist the move, the library on Monday started checking out
books for six weeks at a time, and townsfolk responded. About 700
books are checked out on an average day, but on Monday the number
was nearly triple that.
   Nearly 12,000 of this Chicago suburb's 20,000 residents have
library cards, Gelfius said.
   Debbie Moylan did her duty, checking out so many books for her
three children that she need help getting them from the library
basement.
   ``Right now, they're stacked up on the back porch,'' she said.

   President Bush today praised the lifting of
martial law in China as a ``very sound step'' and said he will be
watching developments there closely.
   Bush's praise of the Chinese move this week contrasted with
criticism from members of Congress who said they doubted Beijing is
about to improve its record on human rights.
   ``I view the lifting of martial law as a very sound step. For
those who are interested in the human rights and reform that was on
the move, that we'd all like to see go forward, there's no way you
can look at that but say it's very positive,'' Bush said.
   He reiterated that he is not interested in isolating China,
adding, ``Of course we welcome the lifting of martial law as a good
sign.''
   A day earlier, U.S. officials had reacted cautiously to the
Chinese move, saying they would reserve judgment until the
announcement by Premier Li Peng was implemented. More upbeat, Vice
President Dan Quayle called the announcement ``a positive step
forward for human rights.''
   The White House and State Department reflected a cautious U.S.
policy stance by issuing identical statements saying ``we must
assess the full scope of this action after observing its
implementation.''
   The Bush administration dropped its opposition to World Bank
loans to China for aid for earthquakes and other unspecified
calamities, but officials said the step was not related to the
lifting of sanctions and that the United States would continue to
oppose loans to China for projects.
   Bush today did not indicate whether he is considering further
softening of sanctions he imposed on Beijing after China's violent
crackdown on thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators last spring.
   ``We will continue to watch this situation very closely,'' he
said.
   On Capitol Hill, Rep. William S. Broomfield of Michigan, the
ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said
China's announcement was ``more blue smoke and mirrors, and would
not fool anybody in Congress into believing that the Chinese
leadership was moderating its oppressive rule.''
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who sponsored legislation to permit
Chinese students to remain in the United States after their visas
expire, called the lifting of martial law an ``empty gesture.''
   ``I am confident the Congress of the United State will see
through this feeble attempt by Chinese leaders to mislead western
governments,'' she said in a statement. ``Beijing can lift martial
law because it does not need martial law to crush dissent.''
   Pelosi said she would push for a congressional override of
President Bush's veto of the bill to protect Chinese students even
though he has promised to shield them through an executive order.
   Senate Democratic Whip Alan Cranston of California called the
announcement ``a small, very small, step in the right direction ...
insufficient justification to halt sanctions against China.''
   House Democratic Leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri renewed
criticism of Bush for sending two senior officials to Beijing for
talks soon after Chinese troops massacred hundreds of students and
other pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square in June.
   ``We shouldn't have been over there at the very time that
Eastern Europe was breaking loose and people were taking courageous
stands against despotic regimes to say to the Chinese all is
forgiven for what you did,'' Gephardt said.
   ``While it may make sense to communicate with the Chinese
government, I don't think you want to be clinking champagne glasses
with them as you say all is forgiven, because I don't think all
should be forgiven that quickly or that easily.''
   Continuing U.S. opposition to loans for projects could derail a
$700 million World Bank program for China. The sanction was imposed
by Bush after the crackdown in Beijing.
   As for permitting humanitarian help, State Department
spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said that decision was distinct
from the announcement that martial law would be lifted after seven
months.
   ``It is a coincidence that they dropped on the same day,'' she
said. ``They are not linked.''
   She described the U.S. action as a partial easing of Bush's
sanction on loans. But Roman Popadiuk, the deputy White House
spokesman, said: ``The sanctions remain in place. Period.''
   The Bush administration has been under fire in Congress and
elsewhere for what critics consider to be kid-glove treatment of
Chinese leaders. The criticism intensified last month when it was
disclosed that National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Deputy
Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger made two trips to Beijing.
   Bush, at a news conference last week, again defended his policy.
He said he did not think isolating the Chinese was the best way to
promote human rights in the country.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration will oppose any effort
to change Social Security taxes, even a politically appealing one
to lower them, President Bush's spokesman said today.
   ``Democrats seem to want to fool around with the Social Security
system. We don't,'' White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
told reporters.
   He was asked about a proposal by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y., to roll back this year's Social Security tax installment
and further cut the rate on Jan. 1, 1991.
   The Social Security payroll tax rate, including Medicare, went
to 7.65 percent of income on Jan. 1 from 7.51 percent, under a
formula endorsed in 1983 by a reform commission headed by economist
Alan Greenspan, who now is chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
Moynihan was a member of the commission.
   ``Mr. Moynihan's got a lot of ideas and we'll let the Democrats
have them,'' Fitzwater said. ``We don't anticipate any changes in
Social Security.''
   Moynihan has said he will introduce his proposal for lower
Social Security taxes when Congress reconvenes on Jan. 23. He has
called his proposal a $55 billion tax cut for working people,
claiming that bulging Social Security trust funds warrant such a
tax reduction.
   Contributions to the trust funds are counted as revenue in the
federal budget, which has the effect of making the overall federal
deficit appear smaller than it otherwise would be.
   Administration opposition to a Social Security tax cut comes
despite Bush's frequently repeated ``no new taxes'' pledge.
   ``The Social Security system is sound. Let the Democrats fool
with it, not us,'' Fitzwater said.
   However, White House chief of staff John Sununu said on CBS'
``Face the Nation'' last Sunday that the administration does plan
to propose a change to Social Security financing that would require
surpluses generated by the trust funds to be used to help retire
the national debt after 1993.
   Currently, the trust funds are invested in Treasury securities.
   Fitzwater said today that the proposal disclosed by Sununu deals
mostly with budget accounting, and not with the structure of the
system.
   Social Security taxes jumped almost $320 this year for Americans
earning $51,300 or more and by smaller amounts for those earning
less. Employers match their workers' contributions.

   An Eastern Airlines plane flying from

National Airport today after suffering an apparent fuel leak,
officials said.
   There were no injuries.
   Eastern Airlines spokesman Robin Matell said the pilot of the
DC-9, which was carrying 36 passengers and a crew of five, declared
an emergency and landed at National at 10:43 a.m.
   ``There was apparently a fuel leak and the pilot did declare an

the landing itself was routine.''
   The passengers on the aircraft were to be flown to Miami on
another Eastern flight, Matell said. The incident is being

<DATELINE>HARARE, Zambabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Church leaders Thursday urged
legislators not to extend Zimbabwe's 24-year-old state of emergency.
   The Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace said in an open
letter that the state's emergency powers, scheduled for renewal by
the House of Assembly on Jan. 16, were used ``to harass and
intimidate people.''
   It cited the five-week detention last year of a labor leader for
criticizing government actions, including the arrests of student
protesters and the indefinite closure of Zimbabwe's only university.
   Sweeping emergency powers, which have been renewed by parliament
every six months since independence in 1980, allow for detention
without trial.
   The church leaders said they believed the state of emergency was
no longer necessary and often led to ``inefficient and unreliable
methods of investigation'' by security authorities.
   In July, the government said it needed wide-ranging emergency
powers to deal with threats from neighboring South Africa and
border incursions by rebels from Mozambique.
   The church leaders said, ``It has not been shown that the
emergency powers improve police performance when it comes to
dealing with spies and saboteurs.''
   Existing security procedures and legislation were sufficient to
safeguard the nation's interests, the commission said.
   Zimbabwe has been under a state of emergency since 1965 when it
was introduced by the government of former Rhodesian Prime Minister
Ian Smith to crack down on black nationalists.

   Eiju Tsuru, said to be Japan's oldest man, died of
heart failure Thursday at the age of 109 and 11 months.
   Tsuru died in the city of Saga on Japan's southernmost main
island of Kyushu.
   The Health and Welfare Ministry said Kiichi Fujiwara in Kanagawa
prefecture, near Tokyo, now is Japan's oldest man, 109 years and
one month.
   Japan's oldest woman is Mitsu Fujisawa, 113 years and nine
months, the ministry said.
   Also on Thursday, Teiichi Igarashi, the oldest person ever to
climb 12,395-foot Mount Fuji, died at the age of 103.
   Igarashi began climbing Fuji, Japan's highest mountain, in 1976,
and made it an annual event. His last climb was in 1988 at age 101.

   Juliette Berto, the leading lady in Jean-Luc
Godard's avant garde films ``Weekend'' and ``La Chinoise,'' has
died of cancer at the age of 42.
   Miss Berto, who died Wednesday, symbolized the free-spirited
intellectual-style actress for the generation that came of age in
the 1968 student-led riots.
   Made famous by ``Weekend,'' Godard's 1966 classic about a group
of people taking to the roads to escape Paris, Miss Berto
eventually turned her back on the French star system that produced
actresses Brigitte Bardot and Jean Seberg.
   She went on to a successful career directing movies, including
``Neige'' (``Snow''), a 1981 docudrama about drug trafficking in
the seedy Pigalle district of Paris.
   She also starred in Joseph Losey's award-winning ``Monsieur
Klein'' with Alain Delon in 1976.

   Demands for controls over ownership of exotic
animals escalated Thursday after a mysterious black panther eluded
a dragnet on the outskirts of Rome.
   Newspapers published grainy photos of a black animal running in
a wooded area Wednesday in what they said was the eighth sighting
of the panther since Dec. 27.
   Police and forest rangers equipped with nets went to the area on
the northern edge of the capital but the panther escaped into the
woods.
   No one has claimed ownership of the big cat.
   Environmental and animal rights groups called for laws that
would require a census of lions, tigers, panthers and other exotic
animals kept as pets and set up centers for such animals abandoned
or mistreated by their owners.

   A man accused of shaking his 3-month-old
daughter to death believed she hated him, and wore a Jimmy Carter
mask to keep her from crying every time he approached her, court
records show.
   Gerald Migliaro, 34, was arrested this week on a charge of
second-degree manslaughter in the Oct. 10 death of his daughter
Anna. He is free on $5,000 bond.
   A state medical examiner determined the infant died of blood
clots within the skull. Doctors also found signs the baby suffered
at least one fractured rib four or five weeks before her death,
police said.
   According to a police affidavit, a nurse at Yale-New Haven
Hospital quoted Migliaro as saying his daughter hated him since the
day he and his wife brought her home from the hospital.

   Travelers along Highway 99 picked up some
extra cash when a purse containing $10,000 fell off the roof of a
moving car and fluttered along the freeway.
   Motorists screeched to a halt along the shoulder of the road and
jumped out to scoop up the $20, $50 and $100 bills on Wednesday,
said California Highway Patrol Officer Guillermo Godinez.
   The money belonged to a Keyes family who had withdrawn the cash
from the bank to pay bills in Modesto, Godinez said.
   Octavio Sajuan put the money in his wife's purse which she
placed on the car while strapping their child into a car seat
outside the bank. The purse was left on top of the car when they
drove away, Godinez said.
   ``The husband said he had been working seven days a week to try
to catch up on bills,'' Godinez said. ``He was so upset he was
crying. It's a very sad story.''
   The couple was able to retrieve $6,000, Godinez said. Also lost
was Mrs. Sajuan's wedding ring, which also was in the purse.

   Four men have been executed after being convicted
of selling heroin and opium in southern China, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
   The overseas edition of the People's Daily said a court in
Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, found the four guilty of
earning thousands of dollars between 1985 and 1988 from selling
drugs in Kunming and Canton.
   The court said the drugs were smuggled from abroad.
   The four appealed the verdict to higher courts but the death
sentences were carried out Monday after the appeals were rejected,
the newspaper said.
   Also on Monday, the Kunming Intermediate Court sentenced 82
people, including 44 for selling drugs, four prostitutes, four for
selling obscene material, 26 swindlers, three gamblers and one
person cheating people through use of superstition, the newspaper
said.
   China is in the midst of a nationwide campaign against the ``six
vices'': prostitution, pornography, gambling, drugs, the selling of
women and children and fraud through superstition.
   China has a small but growing problem with drug abuse. Illegal
drugs are found mostly in southern China, near the opium-growing
areas of Burma, Laos and Thailand.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Blocks Special Judicial Elections In Texas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL HOLMES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court today blocked
special judicial elections that a lower court had ordered in nine
of Texas' largest counties as a way of remedying discrimination
against black and Hispanic voters.
   A federal judge Jan. 2 had ordered the elections to take place
in May under a system less likely to dilute minority voting power.
But the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals today said the
Legislature deserves a chance to come up with a new system first.
   ``Only if it becomes apparent that the state is unwilling to act
with measured and appropriate speed in this regard should the
courts intervene,'' the appeals court said.
   Gov. Bill Clements has already called the Legislature into
session on Feb. 27 to consider judicial selection, along with
school finance reforms.
   ``I applaud the decision of the 5th Circuit not to allow the
wholesale disruption of our judiciary,'' he said. ``Our Legislature
will now have the opportunity to resolve this crucial issue in a
manner that is representative of the wishes of the people of our
state and that enhances the participation of all Texans.''
   U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton had ruled that the nine
counties' method of electing state judges from each county as a
whole violated the federal Voting Rights Act by diluting minority
voting power. He ordered special elections held in those counties,
with judges chosen from smaller, existing political districts.
   The ruling affected 115 state district court judgeships in
Bexar, Dallas, Tarrant, Harris, Travis, Midland, Ector, Lubbock and
Jefferson counties. In all, Texas has 375 state district judgeships.
   The counties were named in a lawsuit filed in 1988 by the League
of United Latin American Citizens and other minority groups and
individuals.
   In its opinion today, the appeals court said Bunton's ruling
would mean sweeping changes in Texas' 113-year-old judicial system.
And that job is more properly one for lawmakers, the court said.
   The court went on to say that the Legislature hasn't had ``a
reasonable period within which to address the problem presented.''

<HEAD>Court: State Official Should Have Dismissed Himself from Dorrian's
Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state's highest court Thursday threw out
a decision revoking the license of the New York City bar where
``preppie murderer'' Robert Chambers met Jennifer Levin before
killing her in Central Park.
   The chairman of the State Liquor Authority should have have
excused himself from a hearing involving alleged underaged drinking
at Dorrian's Red Hand after he made public statements about the
bar's guilt, a sharply-divided State Court of Appeals said.
   The court, by a 4-3 vote, sent the case back to the liquor
authority and said Chairman Thomas Duffy should not be among those
deciding the matter.
   Dorrian's had appealed a decision that it served underaged
drinkers in November 1986 _ three months after Levin was strangled.
The bar forfeited $1,000 bond and lost its liquor license for 10
days.
   Dorrian's lawyer said the bar didn't receive a fair hearing
because Duffy had already pre-judged the case and because the bar
was being made a scapegoat for the highly publicized slaying.
   In March 1988, Chambers pleaded guilty to manslaughter in
Levin's death. He is serving five to 15 years in prison.

   Columbia's astronauts mopped up
water from a leaky dehumidifier today as they closed in on the
floating science laboratory they plan to pluck from space on Friday
with the shuttle's robot arm.
   Commander Dan Brandenstein and pilot Jim Wetherbee executed
three engine-firing maneuvers today, putting Columbia on a
near-collision course with the satellite they have been chasing
since they were launched Tuesday onto a path 1,725 miles behind
their quarry.
   Once the astronauts move in on the 11-ton target, they will fly
in formation 35 feet away while mission specialist Bonnie Dunbar
reaches out with Columbia's 50-foot mechanical arm to snare the
30-foot satellite, which is as large as a small school bus.
   If all goes well, she will make the catch at 9:48 a.m. Friday.
   The shuttle this morning was reported to be within 300 miles of
the satellite, known as the Long Duration Exposure Facility.
   Brandenstein and mission specialist David Low interrupted their
flight plans for more than two hours today to cope with the leak of
about two gallons of water, shown on television as a slow bubbling
of water beads.
   They shut off the faulty dehumidifier, shifted to a backup, and
then went to work on the water with towels and a hand-held vacuum,
using a flashlight to dry cables and other surfaces. Loose water,
which forms beads and globules in weightlessness, can interfere
with electronics.
   Looking at all the equipment that had to be moved to get at the
water, Brandenstein remarked, ``It's kind of a mess right now. I'll
get the plumber of the year award, but not the housekeeper of the
year award.''
   Scientists are eager to examine the satellite to learn how
various systems and materials withstood the long stay in orbit,
information that will help in designing the space station and other
space vehicles.
   Atmospheric drag has been pulling the satellite closer to Earth.
If Columbia does not retrieve it, trackers estimate the satellite
will burn up in a plunge into Earth's atmosphere about March 9, its
experiments lost forever.
   The shuttle, which is in a slightly lower orbit, takes less time
to circle the globe and was catching up with the satellite at a
rate today of about 38 miles for each 91-minute orbit of the Earth.
   Controllers, meanwhile, reported the $85 million Navy
communications satellite launched by the astronauts Wednesday was
functioning well. An onboard motor late Wednesday boosted it on
another leg toward its permament working outpost 22,300 miles above
the Pacific Ocean.
   As the gap between the shuttle and the wayward laboratory
closed, hunter and hunted were traveling nearly 200 miles high at
more than 17,400 mph.
   ``We're glad you're doing so well; the whole world's
impressed,'' Mission Control told the astronauts as it wakened them
today with its version of ``Banana Boat Song.''
   The control center version substituted the name of astronaut Low
for the words ``Day-O,'' and it included such phrases as, ``Come
all you astronauts sleeping in the cabin, daylight comes and its
time to get up.''
   Mission Control explained the words were written by members of
the team that trained Low for a space walk in case of an emergency
on this flight. To pass the time during these training sessions, he
often hummed the song.
   Low, replying in a calypso beat, said, ``Good morning, Houston,
man. We be up.''
   While the commander and pilot tended to flying Columbia, the
three mission specialists, Dunbar, Low and Marsha Ivins, busied
themselves with experiments. They melted crystals, photographed the
Earth and took medical measurements of one another in tests to
determine how well the human body adapts to space weightlessness.
   Columbia's 10-day mission, the second-longest in the 33 shuttle
flights, is a stepping stone toward longer shuttle missions and to
months-long rips aboard space station Freedom starting in the
mid-1990s.
   After Dunbar grabs LDEF, she will hold it on the end of the
robot arm for nearly four hours while Ivins makes a detailed
photographic survey of all 57 experiments mounted on the exterior.
   The laboratory has been exposed to space for six years and there
is concern some of the experiments might deteriorate when
re-introduced to Earth's gravity after being eroded by atomic
oxygen and bombarded by interplanetary debris.

<HEAD>Self-Rule and Capitalism Won't Come Without Pain, Experts Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON AP) _ Now free to set their own course, the people of
East Europe are seeking self-rule and free enterprise, but experts
say fulfilling those yearnings won't necessarily come easily.
   Even if the desire to run one's own life _ and to make money _
is instinctive, they say, history shows that Eastern Europeans may
have trouble setting up shop under the flags of democracy and
capitalism.
   ``People want liberty, naturally, but the working out of
institutions is a very complicated process,'' said Richard Pipes of
Harvard University, an East European specialist who served with
President Reagan's National Security Council.
   ``The Russians in 1917 were wild for liberty and democracy, but
it collapsed in a matter of months because they didn't have the
traditions, the institutions,'' he said in an interview.
   The same is true in trying to set up a capitalist system, said
economist Murray Weidenbaum of Washington University in St. Louis,
a former Reagan adviser who recently surveyed Poland's economy on a
mission for President Bush.
   ``People have the entrepreneurial profit-seeking instinct, you
don't have to teach it to them,'' he said, ``but when you're
talking about the free enterprise system they have to learn
business infrastructure, like cost accounting, contract law,
preparation of financial statements _ that isn't instinctive.''
   Paul A. Samuelson, Nobel Prize-winning economist from MIT, said
he is not too sure that the people of Poland, East Germany,
Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Romania _ having ousted their
Moscow-installed communist governments _ are aware of the pitfalls
of the free enterprise system, if that is what they opt to install.
   ``It is not a system of profits, it is a system of profits and
losses,'' he said. ``Bankruptcy is an important part of the
capitalist system. If you don't want inequalities, unemployment,
bankruptcies, then you want the good side of capitalism without the
other side.''
   Weidenbaum agreed. ``The Poles see the benefits of capitalism
but don't see the costs,'' he said. ``I don't know if they realize
that capitalism is not a profit system but a profit-or-loss system.
In the best of times, thousands of companies go broke.''
   Poland has already felt the pain of moving away from a state
economy. On Jan. 1, taking the plunge, Poles saw bus fares and
gasoline double and the price of electricity and heating gas
increase fourfold.
   Robert Conquest, a specialist on the Soviet Union at the Hoover
Institution on War, Revolution and Peace at Stanford University,
said he suspects East Europe's economic rebirth will be more
troublesome than its political renewal.
   In politics, he said, ``they can go back to their old
constitutions,'' but on the economic front ``they're stuck with
these apparatuses of uselessness.''
   In a system that guaranteed a job to everyone, he said, no one
worked hard.
   Economist Paul Craig Roberts, who served in the Reagan
administration, said he fears that Poland especially is ``so social
democratic in its outlook'' that it may impose ``restrictions that
make it difficult for individuals to suceed economically,'' such as
high progressive tax rates and high death taxes.
   Capitalism is instinctive, he said _ ``it just grew up as a
natural spontaneous development'' _ while ``communism and socialism
began as ideologies that then seized political power and imposed
themselves.''
   Harvard government professor Harvey Mansfield Jr., author of a
new study of power, ``Taming the Prince,'' said he worried that
fascism could beckon if democracy founders in East Europe. That was
the pattern of 1933, when Adolf Hitler took advanatage of
discontent with unemployment and inflation in newly democratic
Germany to seize power.
   But Conquest doubted that fascism holds much appeal or poses
much of a threat in East Europe.
   ``I think the attraction of democratic liberty is very, very
great,'' he said. ``They have a higher opinion of the West than the
West does.''
   Yet it took two tries to establish a workable democratic system
in this country, even though the colonialists had experience in
parliamentary rule in England, Pipes said. The first American
constitution _ the Articles of Confederacy and Perpetual Union _
was recognized as a failure within nine years and replaced by the
Constitution within 12.
   On the other hand, he said, East Europeans ``are so fed up with
despotism of any kind, right or left, that you're going to se a
tremendous desire for democracy and capitalism.''

<HEAD>Soldiers March Across Tiananmen Square After Martial Law Lifted</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China's army will maintain a strong presence ``to
safeguard public security'' in the Beijing area following the
lifting of martial law, the government's top spokesman said
Thursday.
   Up to 1,000 troops marched across Tiananmen Square on Thursday
morning, hours after seven months of martial law officially ended
in the capital.
   ``I thought martial law was over,'' said one of the several
thousand people on the 100-acre square as he watched the military
procession.
   The government spokesman, Yuan Mu, told a news conference there
was a ``small increase'' in troop levels in Beijing and its
suburbs, but he gave no indication of how many soldiers would be
stationed around the capital.
   Yuan said the military presence was necessary to ``safeguard
public security and the peaceful work of the people.''
   He said martial was ended because ``the task of martial law has
been victoriously completed, the situation in Beijing and
throughout the country is stable and the social order has returned
to normal.''
   President Bush on Thursday praised the lifting of martial law as
a ``very sound step'' and a ``good sign.''
   There was no suggestion from the Chinese government that it was
responding to strong pressure from the West to lift martial law as
a signal that it is easing its policy of harsh suppression of
political dissent.
   Premier Li Peng on Wednesday night announced the end to martial
law, imposed in May after pro-democracy crowds of up to 1 million
people took over the streets of Beijing.
   Li stressed that decision to bring troops into Beijing in the
June military crackdown had been ``timely, necessary and correct.''
   Police replaced military sentries in the city at the end of
October, and the lifting of martial law had no visible effect on
the city except that Tiananmen Square, previously entered only by
Chinese with proper documents, again became open to all citizens.
   About 150,000 troops entered Beijing to quell the pro-democracy
unrest of last spring, and many are believed to remain
unobtrusively behind the walled compounds of the city.
   Chinese sources said the military went on full alert in late
December when the overthrow of the pro-China Nicolae Ceausescu
regime in Romania raised fears of political unrest in Beijing.
   On Thursday, the troops, many shouting in cadence or singing
military songs, marched across Tiananmen Square and entered a
compound next to the Great Hall of the People in an obvious show of
military force.
   Although tough anti-protest laws and surveillance of university
campuses remain in place, many expressed relief that martial law
was over. ``This is the way it should be,'' said a high school
student about the opening of the square to the public again.
   But others, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
end of martial law will have little meaning as long as political
repression continues.
   ``The government draws a circle and you have to stand inside,''
said a Beijing teacher. ``It's like the Russian Gulag, only a
different size,'' he said, adding that ``we haven't forgotten the
students'' who stood up to the military.
   Hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of people were killed when
troops stormed the city on June 3-4 to drive student demonstrators
from the square. Since then thousands of political activists have
been arrested, and many languish in jail without formal charges.
   Asked about students under detention, Yuan said only that
judicial departments were still carrying out investigations.
   Gao Xin, one of four intellectuals who began a hunger strike for
democracy just before military assault, has been freed after six
months in jail, but Gao, who looked much thinner, said Thursday he
could not talk about the experience.
   The government spokesman said China would take a ``prudent
attitude'' toward providing the names of those killed in the
crackdown because many relatives of the victims were ``not quite
willing to have the names announced in the papers.''
   Yuan said the situation in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa, also
under martial law since the outbreak of pro-independence riots in
March, was different from that of Beijing and he had no information
on when martial law would end there.
   China's official newspapers said the nation cannot relax its
vigilance against anti-socialist enemies.
   ``Lifting martial law doesn't mean all is well,'' said the
Communist Party's People's Daily. It said the ``few people who
adhere to bourgeois liberalization refuse to admit their defeat.''
   The Liberation Army Daily said the army, ``the pillar of the
people's democratic dictatorship in China, will not slacken its
vigilance ideologically.''

<HEAD>American Indian Center Offers Hot Line for Homeless</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FINDLAY, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A toll-free 24-hour hot line has started to
help homeless people across the United States find shelters and
other social service agencies.
   The Findlay Area Native American Indian Center set up the hot
line, which opened Monday, said Michael Michaud, the group's
spokesman.
   ``There are many people out there who are hungry, cold and
living on the streets, with little hope that things will get
better,'' he said Wednesday. ``We have information for every state
in the union, for the shelters, soup kitchens, different social
service agencies, to help people in need.''
   The center, composed of a house, barn and craft shop on two
acres in this northwestern Ohio city, was created to promote
American Indian culture. But four months ago, Michael Adams, the
center's owner who is a Cherokee Indian, and Michaud, an Abenaki
Indian, decided to convert part of the complex to help the needy.
   Since October, the center has provided food and clothing and
emergency shelter. It has helped about 500 people in the Findlay
area. The center, which is supported by donations, also helps
people find jobs and provides transportation to job interviews.

   The phone number for tourists interested in
vacation information is being answered by people who aren't going
anywhere.
   Working out of a cramped room at the Correctional Institution
for Women in Raleigh, six inmates are taking 700 calls a day, a
number that will grow in the next three months as people plan
summer vacations and respond to state advertisements.
   The inmates, working for the highest prison wage of $1 a day,
three weeks ago replaced the two to four state employees who used
to answer the calls. The idea was to save the state $40,000 a year,
but officials say the prisoners, with the help of 14 other inmates
who stuff envelopes with brochures and maps, also are getting out
more information than state employees did.
   Inmates and their overseer expressed satisfaction with the
program in interviews with The Charlotte Observer.
   ``I never dreamed I'd be sitting in prison, talking to people
all over the world,'' said Rochelle Daniels, 31, who is serving a
30-year sentence for murder.
   ``My travel experience is limited,'' Ms. Daniels admitted. She
is able to tell callers about fishing at the Outer Banks, golfing
in Pinehurst or driving the Blue Ridge Parkway because the women
received six weeks of training, including lessons in geography and
history.

   The bill introduced into the General
Assembly is only one sentence long and not particularly
controversial, but it involves a lot of steps and circuitous
action, not to mention toe-tapping.
   ``The square dance, part of recorded American history since
1651, is the official American folk dance of the state,'' Ohio law
would declare, under a proposal Wednesday by state Sen. Cooper
Snyder.
   Snyder said the measure was prompted by the selection of
Cincinnati as the site of an international folk dance conference.
   ``It's a big deal. They're coming from all over the world to put
on a contest as to who's best and make a world deal out of it. So
this is simply in recognition of that and support. And, of course,
it is a widely enjoyed recreation across the state of Ohio,'' he
said.
   Ohio already has an official state seal, flag, bird, tree,
flower, insect, song and fossil. Inclusion of the insect and fossil
came as a result of bills suggested by children.

   Officials Thursday rejected an
Amnesty International report charging the government has detained
and tortured hundreds of political opponents, and they denied the
kingdom holds political prisoners.
   A high-ranking government official said the report did not take
into account that Saudi Arabia follows Islamic law.
   In a document released Thursday in London, the human rights
group said more than 700 people were detained in Saudi Arabia
without trial between 1983 and 1989, most of them Shiite Moslems.
   The torture methods it listed included beating on the soles of
feet, sleep deprivation and being suspended by the wrists from a
ceiling or high window.
   ``The report is baseless,'' the official said. ``The laws in the
kingdom of Saudi Arabia are derived from Islamic Shari'a.''
   The official refused to be identified, as do most senior
officials when speaking to the press.
   Amnesty International conceded the kingdom is run by Islamic law
but said it was enacted by royal decree or ministerial regulations,
with no regular penal code.
   Under Shari'a, courts are made up of Moslem theologians, and
murderers are beheaded while thieves have their hands cut and
adulterers are stoned. Lawyers are not assigned automatically but
the prisoner can request legal counsel or an attorney can volunteer
to defend.
   There are lawyers versed in Islamic Shari'a but it is not a
practice to automatically assign one to defendants.
   The official Saudi Press Agency quoted a government spokesman as
saying there were no political prisoners in the kingdom, but there
were cases being considered by the rules of Islamic Shari'a through
``judges highly versed in Shari'a.''
   Islamic Shari'a, he said, ``does not differentiate between sects
or races or creeds and does not extract confessions by force,
pressure or terror or any style that contravenes the dignity of man
as established by Islamic Shari'a and applied by the kingdom.''
   He added: ``Amnesty International should differentiate between
laws by which the kingdom abides in line with the rules and
principles of Islamic Shari'a and the systems in other countries in
light of laws laid down by human beings who err more often than
not.''
   Beheadings are common in Saudi Arabia on Fridays, the Moslem
Sabbath.
   A prominent case of beheadings last year was that of 16 Moslem
Shiites, mainly Kuwaitis, who were convicted in bombings during the
pilgrimage to the Saudi cities of Mecca and Medina. The blasts
killed one person.

   Prime Minister V.P. Singh offered key
concessions to Sikh separatists Thursday, but he said he had no
sure way to end the violence.
   Singh appeared at a rally of about 100,000 people in the Punjab
city of Ludhiana as part of his 6-week-old government's campaign to
restore peace in the state.
   Singh said Sikh deserters from the Indian army would be given
government jobs. The deserters' rehabilitation has been a key
demand of the Sikh community.
   The prime minister also said the cases of jailed Sikhs would be
reviewed. Hundreds and perhaps thousands are in jail.
   Hundreds of Sikh soldiers mutinied in 1984 when the government
ordered Indian army troops to attack the Golden Temple, the Sikh
faith's holiest shrine, and expel armed Sikhs. More than 2,000
people, mostly Sikhs, were killed in the raid.
   Later that year, Sikh bodyguards killed Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi in revenge. The violence has continued, with at least 1,820
people killed in the Punjab state last year, mostly in hit-and-run
attacks by the militants.
   ``When blood flows in Punjab, it is the country's heart that
bleeds,'' said Singh, a Hindu.
   He added, however: ``I have not come here with a magic wand. The
solution is not in the corridors of New Delhi but in the
wheatfields of Punjab.''
   A resolution adopted at the end of the rally said: ``Violence
and the use of coercive methods must be put (to) an end, and
security of life and property and respect for human rights for all
must be exercised.''
   Many listeners in the crowd seemed skeptical about prospects for
an end to the violence.
   ``V.P. Singh's latest rally is just a ritual. The government
itself knows nothing will be solved. Can anything be solved by such
rallies?'' asked Bhinder Singh, a Sikh resident of Ludhiana.
   About 20 leaders of various political parties attended the
meeting in the industrial town of about 800,000 people known for
its clothing factories.
   An influential Sikh party of Punjab, the Akali Dal, and former
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress Party, the largest
opposition group, stayed away.
   Foreign Minister Inder Kumar Gujral, a Hindu who has been a key
figure in the government's efforts to win over Sikhs, said the
rally's aim was to ``mobilize support from the people of Punjab to
quash secessionist efforts.''
   The rebellion was launched in 1982 with militants claiming Sikhs
suffer discrimination by Hindus. Sikhs form only 2 percent of
India's 880 million people but have in a slight majority in Punjab.
Hindus make up 82 percent of the national population.
   Thursday's rally was the second multiparty meeting on Punjab
called by Singh since he took office Dec. 2, replacing Gandhi.
Singh, who led the centrist National Front alliance, was named
prime minister with support from communists and right-wing Hindu
fundamentalists.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today
tried to persuade Lithuanians to halt their drive for independence,
but tens of thousands of people rallied to show they are not
willing to wait for freedom.
   Gorbachev did not attend the evening rally, but earlier he told
several hundred Lithuanians they can have a say in their future,
yet warned that pitting the Lithuanian leadership against the
Kremlin could lead to tragedy.
   The comments were aimed at cooling pro-independence passions as
Gorbachev embarked on a crucial mission to persuade Lithuanian
Communists to reverse a decision to split from the federal
Communist Party.
   ``We have been tied together for these 50 years, whether we like
it or not,'' Gorbachev said, walking through a crowd of several
hundred after laying a wreath at a monument to Lenin. ``And all the
more so, we have not lived in a federation. We have lived in a
unitary state with its own realities.''
   One person called out to Gorbachev: ``People must decide their
own fate!''
   ``Nothing will be decided without you,'' Gorbachev responded as
he slowly made his way back to his limousine. ``We will decide
everything together.''
   But he added: ``Remember, if someone succeeds in pitting us
against each other in a clash, there will be a tragedy. We should
not allow this.''
   Gorbachev did not say what such a tragedy might be. But one of
his closest political allies, fellow Politburo member Alexander N.
Yakovlev, was quoted Monday in an interview with Interfax, a news
service of Radio Moscow, as saying the Lithuanian Party's move
might cause a ``domino effect,'' encouraging Communists in the
country's other 14 republics to break off from Moscow.
   Soviet officials have given a virtual guarantee they will not
use force to keep Lithuania and its 3.7 million residents in the
Soviet Union.
   Josef Stalin absorbed Lithuania along with the two other Baltic
states, Latvia and Estonia, in 1940 under a secret agreement with
Nazi Germany.
   ``We've come here to express our unity, in light of the East
European changes, to announce that we will decide the problems of
Lithuania ourselves,'' Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the
grassroots political organization Sajudis, told the crowd of at
least 200,000 in Cathedral Square this evening.
   ``We demand freedom and independence,'' said the chief of
Sajudis, a political movement pressing for Lithuanian independence.
   Harry Subacius, a Sajudis spokesman, said in a telephone
interview to Moscow that the evening rally began with 15 minutes of
silence. Many people held candles, red, green, and gold Lithuanian
flags, and the red-and-white banner of neighboring Latvia, Subacius
said.
   After 1 hour and 15 minutes, bells in the Roman Catholic
Cathedral and elsewhere began ringing through the city of 544,000.
   Landsbergis referred to Gorbachev as ``head of a great neighbor
state,'' emphasizing the view that Lithuania is an independent land.
   As the rally was going on, Gorbachev was meeting elsewhere with
Communist Party members, according to an unofficial schedule.
   As never before in his nearly five years in power, Gorbachev put
his personal prestige on the line in coming to Lithuania, exposing
himself to a population that openly disagrees with him. At times,
he adopted a pleading tone as he spoke to the people earlier in the
day.
   The Soviet leader said the rights of all minorities in the
Soviet Union _ whether they be Lithuanians or small non-Lithuanian
ethnic groups in the republic _ must be respected, or it could
endanger the unity of the country's more than 100 ethnic groups.
   ``If even the slightest suppression occurs, or misunderstanding,
somewhere in Estonia or Moldavia, it spills over into the rest of
the country,'' he said.
   Several thousand people gathered around the square as Gorbachev
placed the wreath, and several hundred of them broke through police
cordons to surround Gorbachev afterward.
   The crowd was calm and curious. Gorbachev, who has bitterly
criticized the decision of the 200,000-member Lithuanian Communist
Party to split from the national party, was straightforward and
friendly.
   The people who gathered apparently were passers-by attracted by
the heavy security around the Lenin memorial. It was not announced
in advance that Gorbachev would visit the memorial.
   The Sajudis group said they planned the evening rally to show
Gorbachev they cannot be dissuaded.
   Invited by a member of the crowd to attend, Gorbachev replied,
``For me, the meeting already is going on.''
   He then drove away to an equipment factory for a meeting with
workers.
   During his three-day visit to Lithuania, Gorbachev plans to meet
with collective farmers, members of ethnic minorities,
intellectuals and Communists.
   Although Gorbachev has granted Lithuanians and their neighbors
in Estonia and Latvia a large measure of economic and political
power, he has consistently criticized Lithuanian Communist leaders
for pressing for complete independence.
   Last month, he convened an emergency session of the national
party Central Committee to discuss the issue.
   Landsbergis said his countrymen are not trying to hurt
Gorbachev's political and economic reforms but are showing other
republics ``how certain problems can be solved in a peaceful,
diplomatic manner.''
   ``It's not destabilization. It's de-Stalinization,'' he told a
news conference Wednesday, referring to the rigid, centrally
controlled political and economic systems that Stalin devised.
   In the past two years, Sajudis-backed candidates have defeated
hard-line Communists in local and national elections and helped the
republic win a measure of economic independence from Moscow.
   Gorbachev, for his part, is treating the Communist Party split
as a critical setback in his reform program. The Soviet leader sent
a crew of top-level national party officials headed by Kremlin
ideology chief Vadim A. Medvedev to lobby Lithuanian party members
in preparation for his visit.
   Gorbachev last visited one of the Baltic republics in February
1987, when he traveled to Riga, the capital of Latvia. Lithuanian
activists said he had not been in their republic in a decade.

<NOTE>Eds: Inserts 3 grafs with Cheney quotes after 6th graf, `So every'</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, faced with
budget-cutting pressures, said today that his package of Pentagon
management reforms will save $39 billion and trim 42,000
weapons-buying jobs over the next five years.
   Offering a six-month update on his proposals to trim the Defense
Department's massive purchasing bureaucracy, Cheney said in a
statement that he was aiming for major changes in the way the
Pentagon is run and in the way its purchasing system works.
   Weapons purchases have accounted for more than $60 billion of
the department's $305 billion budget and involves some 580,000
civilian and uniformed personnel.
   President Bush asked Cheney to undertake the effort over the
summer as part of a major review spurred by the weapons-procurement
scandals that rocked the defense establishment.
   ``The changes in the nature of the threat around the world, and
the realities of the budget, mean that our defense budgets are
going to be leaner in the years ahead,'' Cheney's statement said.
   ``So every dollar that we can cut out of the cost of running the
Pentagon is a dollar we don't have to cut from force structure,
readiness or the quality of life for our men and women in uniform.''
   ``Real changes are being made ... that we believe will improve
Pentagon management and help make it possible for us to buy what we
need at lower cost, in less time and with greater assurance of
quality,'' Cheney told reporters.
   He had few details to offer, however, saying he was constrained
because disclosing precise plans must await the release of Bush's
fiscal 1991 budget later this month.
   Asked about the possibility of additional base closings, Cheney
said ``extensive'' closures were planned to aid his overall
cost-cutting effort. When asked to define ``extensive,'' he
quipped, ``More than two.''
   Although reports had circulated recently that Cheney's reforms
would include doing away with the duplicative purchasing systems
entrenched in the separate military services, the Pentagon
announcement said the savings would be achieved primarily through:
   _Streamlining each service's purchasing system.
   _Reducing the use of consultants and outside advisers.
   _Creating a full-time acquisition corps in each service that
would report to a ``streamlined chain of command'' to top civilian
department officials.
   _Eliminating unnecessary paperwork.
   ``The management improvements will generate $2.3 billion in
savings for FY (fiscal year) '91 and an estimated $39 billion
through FY '95,'' the statement said.
   ``The improvements make it possible to trim the logistics and
management workforce of 580,000 civilians and military personnel
and by as many as 8,000 civilians and 8,000 military personnel in
FY'91 and by 18,000 civilian and 24,000 military personnel by the
end of FY '95.''
   When Cheney first undertook the study, some members of Congress
complained that the effort wasn't deep enough to radically reform
the system.
   Meanwhile, Defense Department sources said Cheney has ordered
other reviews of strategic policies and major aircraft programs to
help plan long-range spending as the department faces near-certain
budget cuts, sources said Wednesday.
   Cheney, seeking advice on the Pentagon's long-term strategy and
budgets, directed Paul Wolfowitz, the undersecretary of defense for
policy, to reassess the overall defense strategy. He asked John
Betti, the undersecretary of defense for acquisition, to review the
Pentagon's most expensive aircraft projects, the sources said.
   ``In part, it's because of what's happening in Eastern Europe,''
said one Pentagon official, who spoke on condition he not be
identified by name.
   ``It really puts on paper what people were asked to do months
ago,'' said a military source, who also spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The first official said although such studies are usually done
continuously at the Pentagon, but the events in Eastern Europe and
the prospect of declines in the military's projected budget
increases added impetus to Cheney's request.
   Much of the military's planning and budgets is focused on
fighting a U.S.-Soviet war, primarily in Europe with NATO and
Warsaw Pact troops, and airlifting U.S. troops overseas for
protracted battles.
   President Bush's 1991 budget, to be delivered to Congress later
this month, is expected to include some weapons cutbacks and call
for a 2 percent real drop in Pentagon spending.
   But because of the complex Pentagon budget-building process, it
is not expected to reflect a major adjustment in the U.S. military
response to the sweeping changes in the Soviet Union and Europe,
the source said.
   So the studies, expected to be sent to Cheney by March, will be
used as officials begin deliberations for the fiscal 1992 budget
cycle and for long-range planning, the official added.
   The military source said Cheney's memorandum, dated
mid-December, says the review ``should begin from basic
principles.''
   The source said the memo does not specifically mention which
aircraft are to be studied, but that it is clear the secretary is
interested reviewing requirements for the top four billion-dollar
programs _ the B-2 stealth bomber, the C-17 transport plane and the
Air Force and Navy advanced fighter jets still under development.

   An aide to Gov. Kay Orr says he mistakenly
reported she wants to require an anti-drug pledge from students at
Nebraska's public colleges and suspend students for any
drug-related offense.
   Gary Rex, director of the Policy Research Office, took the blame
Wednesday for what he and administration spokesman Doug Parrott
said was a misunderstanding of what Mrs. Orr wanted in the measure.
   The proposal, sharply criticized by some lawmakers, newspapers
and others, first was described earlier this week as requiring that
students at public colleges lose any state aid and be suspended for
any first-offense involving drugs. It also required a pre-admission
pledge to stay drug free.
   In the wake of the criticism, the administration said that the
written materials that explained the plan were wrong and that Rex,
a lawyer who holds three supervisory roles in the administration,
misunderstood Mrs. Orr.
   Rex said Wednesday the governor wants a bill that would suspend
a student and revoke financial aid only after a second drug-related
offense. A first offense would simply require the student to take a
rehabilitation course, he said.
   ``And it wasn't supposed to be a pledge or some sort of loyalty
oath or promise to stay drug-free,'' Rex said. ``It would simply be
a written acknowledgment that a student would face certain
penalties and requirements if they had a drug offense. ... The
governor was aghast at the talk of `loyalty oaths' that was going
around.''
   Some legislators charged that Rex is too smart to have
misunderstood the governor and that the Republican governor had
backed down under criticism.
   Sen. Ernie Chambers, an independent, said Rex was ``obviously
taking the heat for the governor.''
   ``All this shows is that she will do any sort of thing and
sacrifice anyone to avoid the political embarrassment she so richly
deserves,'' he said.
   Administration spokesmen previously acknowledged that, under
Mrs. Orr's proposal, a student convicted of a drug infraction could
be suspended from school while someone convicted of violent crimes
wouldn't face such a penalty.

   President Bush on Thursday praised the efforts

infant formula and medical supplies to hard-pressed Poland.
   Bush met at the White House with leaders of the group, a
coalition of business, labor, civic and academic leaders banded
together as the Emergency Committee for Aid to Poland.
   ``This is an effort to provide an outlet for the business
community, for individuals to provide support, much needed support
to Poland right now,'' Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said after
the meeting.
   She said the shipment of 50 tons of supplies was ``the first of
many shipments that will be made.''
   ``This is going to be a very difficult winter for the Polish
people,'' she added. ``There will be a lot of hardship, a lot of
deprivation and they're very much in need of medical supplies,
food, infant formula. The hardship will be particularly difficult
for the elderly, for youngsters for the poor.''
   Poland is going through wrenching economic times as it moves
from a controlled economic system toward a free-market.

   A federal judge who ordered a reduction of
air pollution caused by such items as deodorants and hair spray
says some of the products may have to be banned.
   U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson on Wednesday ordered a
reduction of four tons a day of air pollution from household
products in the San Francisco Bay area by 1993. The pollution level
was an estimated 45.3 tons a day in 1987.
   Henderson noted that a plan approved in 1982 by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency had required such a reduction by
1987.
   Rejecting proposals by local and state smog agencies to delay
compliance until 1997 or 1999, Henderson said the Bay Area Air
Quality Management District has been guilty of an ``appalling
failure to take any significant action.''
   Wednesday's ruling applies to emissions from ``consumer
solvents'' such as air fresheners, deodorants, disinfectants,
aerosol paints, household cleaners and hair spray.
   Henderson left many of the details up to state and local
agencies. But he said banning local sale of certain products would
work, especially deodorants, air fresheners and household
pesticides that have non-aerosol equivalents.
   Henderson said he would issue timetables shortly for reducing
emissions from farm pesticides and lawn mowers, leaf-blowers and
power tools.
   Larry Chaset, a lawyer for the Bay Area Air Quality Management
District, said Henderson's schedule ``sounds impractical on the
face of it,'' although ``we think we could probably get a good
chunk of the reductions by 1994.''
   He said the agency hasn't decided whether to appeal the order.
   ``The agencies have known since 1982 that they were supposed to
adopt a consumer solvent rule,'' said William Curtiss, lawyer for
the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund. ``They have done nothing but
think about it.''
   ``The court, I think, is sending a pretty strong message that
more of the same is not going to be regarded as adequate
compliance,'' he said.

   Gov. Kay Orr's administration says a
proposal that would suspend students at public colleges for
drug-related offenses was submitted in an erroneous form that made
it harsher than the governor wanted.
   The proposal, sharply criticized by some lawmakers and others,
originally carried a written explanation saying students would lose
state aid and be suspended for any first-offense involving drugs,

   State Sen. Tim Hall, an Omaha Democrat, said he doesn't believe
in fighting drug use by taking education away, and ``the new
version is still ridiculous. ... What you have here is the governor
trying to get off the hook. I'm skeptical about the whole thing.''
   Administration spokesmen previously acknowledged that under the
Republican governor's proposal a student convicted of a drug
infraction could be suspended while someone convicted of violent
crimes wouldn't automatically face such a penalty.

   President Bush today told Portuguese Prime
Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva that the United States appreciates his
country's efforts to help end the fighting in Angola and get peace
talks resumed.
   ``When peace and stability come to that region, as certainly we
hope they will, Portugal will have an important role in the
reconstruction process,'' Bush told Cavaco Silva in a farewell
statement after talks in the Oval Office and a luncheon.
   The prime minister said he briefed Bush on his talks with the
leaders of the Angolan and Mozambique governments. Cavaco Silva
said he had ``expressed the hope that if all interested parties
show a positive attitude, it will be possible to put an end to the
conflict that exacts such a heavy toll on the peoples in those two
African countries.
   Bush called Portugal ``a close and enduring ally'' and said
their talks had been productive. The prime minister said he wanted
a ``broader and deeper relationship'' with the United States.
   The impasse in talks between the Soviet-backed government
supported by Portugal and the UNITA rebels armed by the United
States had been expected to be a significant part of discussions
between Bush and Cavaco Silva.
   A senior Portuguese diplomat flew to Angola last week for
discussions with the president of the former Portuguese colony,
Eduardo Jose dos Santos, in advance of Cavaco Silva's Washington
trip.
   The Portuguese leader, who arrived in Washington on Wednesday,
is bringing Bush ``lots of information'' about the situation there
and Angola's views, said an aide to the prime minister.
   A truce between the Angolan government and UNITA broke down last
summer and efforts since then to hold peace talks have failed,
despite intense U.S. lobbying. On Tuesday, the State Department
chastised the Soviet Union for supporting a Angolan government
offensive against UNITA that began Dec. 23.
   ``We welcome an active Portuguese involvement'' in bringing the
two sides together, said a senior administration official who
briefed reporters about Cavaco Silva's visit. He spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Despite differences over U.S. support for UNITA, the Union for
the Total Independence of Angola, led by Jonas Savimbi, the
official stressed both countries are now eager to seek peace in the
African nation.
   Cavaco Silva's aide, who also spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the prime minister also hoped to reassure Bush that the
economic integration of the 12-nation European Economic Community
by 1992 will not exclude American products and services.
   Cavaco Silva's visit is meant to highlight the rapid growth of
U.S. investment in Portugal, which doubled to more than $1 billion
from 1988 to 1989, the American official said. An agreement on
investment is to be signed Thursday.
   Also on the agenda was a preliminary discussion on renewing the
U.S. rights for use of Portugal's Lajes air force base in the
Azores Islands. The eight-year agreement expires next year and the
official predicted prospects for renewal are ``pretty good.''
   Lajes is a strategic refueling depot for U.S. military aircraft
and is also used to track Soviet submarine activity in the Atlantic.
   Bush and Cavaco Silva were also to focus on the role of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization in light of the changes in
Eastern Europe and Soviet disarmament proposals. Portugal is an
active member of the 16-nation Atlantic alliance.
   Cavaco Silva was to meet with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
later in the day. On the agenda was a U.S. program to modernize the
Portuguese armed forces.
   The U.S. official said some of the modernization will be funded
by the annual military aid appropriated by Congress for Portugal.
The assistance for this year is $100 million and will probably
decline slightly next year in light of budget constraints, the
official said.

   Carnegie Hall will resound with music both
morning and night on the 100th anniversary of its first concert,
with one top name in classical music after another promising to
perform.
   Organizers announced plans Wednesday for a season of special
concerts to mark the passage of a century since the May 5, 1891,
opening concert at the hall. They will culminate in an all-day gala
on that concert's 100th anniversary.
   Violinist Isaac Stern, who is also Carnegie Hall president, said
the hall's 1990-91 season will be ``probably the most extraordinary
season that any hall has ever had.''
   On May 5, 1991, the day will begin with a morning concert of
nine choruses led by Robert Shaw. A concert by the New York
Philharmonic will begin at 4 p.m. After a break for dinner, the
concert will resume.
   Among artists already booked are Leonard Bernstein, Zubin Mehta,
Placido Domingo, the Empire Brass Quintet, Marilyn Horne, Yo-Yo Ma,
Jessye Norman, Leontyne Price, Mstislav Rostropovich, Rudolf
Serkin, Pinchas Zukerman and Stern.
   Judith Arron, executive director of the hall, said the budget
for next season has been increased to $13.2 million from $7.5
million to bring in a large number of leading musicians.
   The centennial season will begin with a free concert in Central
Park on Aug. 20, a salute to Carnegie by the New York Philharmonic
conducted by Mehta, with Stern as violin soloist.
   Opening night in the hall itself will be Sept. 26 and will
feature Andre Previn conducting the Los Angeles Philharmonic with
violinist Itzhak Perlman as soloist.
   The nine days leding up to the May 5 gala will include concerts
featuring Van Cliburn as piano soloist with the New York
Philharmonic; the Boston Symphony conducted by Seiji Ozara with
Rostropovich as cello soloist; soprano Kathleen Battle in her
Carnegie Hall recital debut; a jazz concert organized by Wynton
Marsalis, and a folk music concert organized by Pete Seeger.
   Mrs. Arron said the hall is commissioning new works from 14
composers to premiere at the hall during the season, calling it
``the most ambitious commissioning project ever undertaken by a
presenting institution in this country.''

<HEAD>Police Tapes of Father Charged in Childrens' Drowning Released</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WYANDOTTE, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man told police he wanted to frighten
his wife by speeding their station wagon with his four children
toward the Detroit River, but then couldn't slam on the breaks.
   ``I just wanted to give, um, just scare my wife enough to slam
on the brakes, come to a skidding halt and get her all upset so
she'd forget about the bed for a couple of days,'' Lawrence DeLisle
said in videotaped police interrogations released Wednesday. ``Just
let me be. I couldn't stop accelerating. I didn't.''
   The family earlier had priced a $500 bed for one of the children.
   DeLisle faces trial Jan. 30 on four counts of murder and one
count of attempting to murder his wife, Suzanne, who survived the
Aug. 3 river plunge.
   On the interrogation tapes, DeLisle said he loves his wife and
children. ``I didn't want to hurt my babies. I didn't even realize
they were in the car. My mind went blank.''
   The tapes have been barred from use at DeLisle's trial by a
judge who agreed that DeLisle's statements were coerced. The
Michigan Supreme Court ruled Friday that the tapes be released.
   DeLisle, 30, and his wife maintain the car plunge was an
accident, caused when a leg cramp forced DeLisle to jam his foot
against the gas pedal and sent the car through a barrier rail and
into the river.
   DeLisle's attorney, Frank Eaman, said the tapes contain clear
evidence of pressure from police.
   ``He gives rambling answers about his feelings, which can have
multiple interpretations,'' Eaman said. ``He never says he drove
his car into the river intentionally to get rid of his burdens.''
   Police, however, have said the tapes reveal a man who lost his
ability to lie and confessed to purposely drowning his four
children _ Bryan, 8, Melissa, 4, Kathryn, 2, and Emily, 8 months.
   Police have said DeLisle's $13,000 in debts and troubles with
supporting his family on a $31,000 salary as manager of an auto
service store might have been a motive for the drownings. DeLisle
told interrogaters he was thinking of no longer having to pay bills
as the car hurtled toward the river. But DeLisle also denied
wanting his family dead.

<TEXT>
   The man chosen to enforce Chicago's ethics laws
resigned today, one day after officials learned he had been
implicated in alleged campaign fund-raising violations in
Louisiana, the city Board of Ethics said.
   Gary M. O'Neill, who started work as executive director of the
Board of Ethics on Dec. 12, has ``a cloud over his head, and
therefore he can't act as ethics director,'' said Albert Hofeld,
chairman of the board.
   O'Neill was expected to release a statement later in the day.
   O'Neill, who helped Louisiana's Commissioner of Insurance Doug
Green finance his successful 1987 campaign, was a defendant in a
lawsuit by the Louisiana Board of Ethics for Elected Officials. The
lawsuit accused Green of attempting to conceal the source of $2.2
million in contributions to his 1987 campaign.
   The lawsuit was thrown out of court last year when the Louisiana
ethics board's enforcement provisions were declared
unconstitutional by a state judge. A rehearing of the issue is
pending before the Louisiana Supreme Court.
   Word of those allegations came as a surprise Wednesday to
Chicago officials. The board had hired O'Neill, a lawyer, last
month after a three-month search that involved 200 applicants.
   ``I am unaware of these allegations, but most assuredly they
will be looked into,'' Hofeld said Wednesday.
   ``We viewed him as the best candidate and we were impressed with
his credentials and with his abilities, and we will examine
whatever charges are brought to our attention.''
   The agency enforces the city's ethics and campaign disclosure
ordinances.
   ``Obviously the Board of Ethics has egg all over their face
because they're supposed to make the appropriate checks'' before
hiring someone, said J. Terrence Bruner, executive director of the
Better Government Association, a watchdog group.
   ``It's no secret, of course _ I was involved in Doug Green's
campaign,'' O'Neill was quoted as saying in Wednesday's Morning
Advocate of Baton Rouge, La. ``I think we did it in compliance with
law.''
   Authorities also subpoenaed O'Neill in June to testify before a
grand jury that is investigating possible criminal wrongdoing
surrounding the collapse of an insurance agency that was regulated
by Green's office.
   Louisiana investigators said the subpoena was never delivered
because O'Neill could not be found, the State-Times of Baton Rouge
reported.
   ``I haven't been in hiding,'' O'Neill told the Advocate. ``I
haven't been running. My leaving was happenstance. It was not
calculated.''

<HEAD>L-Tryptophan Investigation: So Far, `Nothing Obvious'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal scientists are not sure, despite two
months of investigation, why more than 1,000 people have gotten
sick after taking the health food supplement L-tryptophan.
   The protein component widely taken as a nutritional supplement
was linked in November to a rare, painful blood disorder known as
eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, which suddenly started mushrooming
in New Mexico.
   Within weeks of those reports, cases were spotted in 49 states,
all but Alaska. As of Tuesday, 1,046 had been reported to the
Centers for Disease Control. One fatality has been confirmed, and
at least six more deaths are believed linked to L-tryptophan.
   The disorder is marked by an abnormally high number of white
blood cells called eosinophils and causes severe muscle pain, or
myalgia.
   Scientists at the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration
quickly began trying to determine if the illnesses were being
caused by L-tryptophan itself, or by some contaminant that got into
batches of the product.
   They're still trying.
   ``We, together with the FDA, have done all the obvious things,''
said Dr. Ed Kilbourne, chief of the Health Studies Branch of the
CDC's Environmental Hazards Division. ``That includes evaluating
the relationship of specific samples to cases, and looking at the
relevant lab analysis for major contaminants.
   ``And they don't show anything obvious.''
   The FDA also acted to get the product, sold in several
preparations under numerous brand names, off the shelves of health
food stores and drug stores.
   People have taken L-tryptophan for years, but the problem
apparently started just last year. Cases don't point to any
particular manufacturer, brand or lot number.
   ``The epidemiology suggests it's a contaminant,'' Kilbourne
said. ``A relatively large number of cases seemed to mushroom this
past summer, and that suggests that something happened.''
   So far, investigators haven't found any signs of contamination.
``But negative lab results or not, there's got to be something
there,'' Kilbourne said.
   This is not a simple contamination investigation case, like
trying to find poison in a capsule where it isn't supposed to be,
because researchers don't know what they are looking for yet,
Kilbourne said.
   ``This is just a thorny scientific problem,'' he said.
   Researchers with the Atlanta-based CDC are retracing their steps
to see if they missed something small. ``Maybe the odd
chromatographic peak that didn't seem significant before,''
Kilbourne said. ``We're re-evaluating all those things.''
   ``We're just looking for anything identified as a potential
contaminant,'' said Chris Lecos, an FDA spokesman in Washington.
``The answer lies somewhere in the laboratory, I suspect.''
   The FDA issued a recall request for L-tryptophan Nov. 17 and
expanded it Nov. 21 to block importation of the product.
   ``For the most part, it appears to us that most of the
manufacturers and distributors and retail stores have complied with
the recall request,'' Lecos said.
   ``We do know that some retail operations and a few manufacturers
are not heeding the recall request,'' he said, adding that the FDA
is contemplating seizure actions against seven companies although
no action has been taken yet.

<HEAD>Union, Management Meet in Bid to Resolve Violent Strike</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police arrested several
striking rail workers Thursday, and union leaders and management
met in a bid to resolve a violent 10-week-old walkout.
   Both police and union officials confirmed the arrests in
Pretoria of members of the South African Railways and Harbor
Workers Union. Neither side had figures on exactly how many men
were taken into custody.
   About 25,000 rail workers, all black, have been striking the
state-owned South Africa Transport Services since November. They
are demanding their minimum monthly wage be increased from $225 to
$560. Workers also are seeking official recognition of their union.
   The company has fired 22,000 strikers, but says it will rehire
half of those dismissed. It has refused to offer a wage increase.
   More than 20 people have died in strike-related violence,
including seven in a clash Tuesday.
   The union and management met Thursday in Johannesburg and
planned additional talks Friday. Management spokesman Leon Els said
the negotiations were ``back on line,'' while the union's General
Secretary Martin Sebakwane said the meeting was ``unsensational.''
   Transport Services officials met separately with members of the
anti-apartheid Mass Democratic Movement, which included union
leaders and clergymen.
   In other developments Thursday:
   _ A mob stabbed a bus conductor near Durban, then set the
vehicle afire and trapped him inside, where he burned to death,
Transport Services officials said. The driver of the bus was
stabbed eight times and hospitalized, the officials added.
Officials said it was not clear whether the attack was connected to
the strike.
   _ Police used tear gas to disperse hundreds of angry blacks
protesting the prosposed demolition of their squatter community.
Five homes were destroyed at the Tokoza shantytown east of
Johannesburg, but authorities halted the operation when the crowd
gathered. No injuries or arrests were reported. The government has
declared the 3,000 squatter shacks illegal and seeks to move
residents 20 miles away.

<HEAD>Authorities Say Record Number of People Killed in Medellin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A record 4,015 murders were committed in
the cocaine capital of Medellin in 1989, authorities said Thursday.
   Colombia's efforts to fight the traffickers gained a boost with
the Defense Ministry reporting delivery of seven more U.S.
helicopters, part of a $60 million aid package. So far, 19
helicopters have been delivered.
   The city morgue in Medellin said murders increased last year to
4,015 from 3,299 in 1988, a rise of 22 percent.
   Gunfire caused 3,546 of the deaths, said Cesar Augusto Giraldo,
the head of the morgue. He said he does not break down the deaths
according to types of violence and could not say how many were
drug-related.
   Government officials launched a campaign to annihilate the
cocaine traffickers in August after they were blamed for killing a
presidential candidate. Traffickers retaliated with a wave of
bombings and other attacks.
   More than 200 nationwide bombings blamed on drug traffickers
have killed at least 199 people and injured more than 1,200 since
August. The deaths include 107 people killed Nov. 27 when a bomb
believed planted by drug terrorists brought down a Colombian
jetliner.
   Medellin, a city of 2 million people, is headquarters of the
Medellin Cartel, which controls much of the billions of dollars in
cocaine smuggled into the United States each year.
   Last year's violence also included a war between rival drug
groups, vigilante killings of people suspected of theft, and
fighting by street gangs bent on control of crime in poor areas.
   In addition, right-wing death squads and leftist guerrillas have
been active in the city.
   Twenty prostitutes were killed recently in Medellin and their
bodies thrown from speeding cars. Police say they don't know why
they were killed.
   Since Sunday, a nationwide wave of violence in areas contested
by right-wing death squads and leftist guerrillas has claimed 39
lives, the national police and the Defense Ministry said Thursday.
The dead included 18 guerrillas and four soldiers slain in a battle
in the northern state of Cesar.
   The dead also included seven peasants who were apparently
massacred by a right-wing death squad in northern Colombia.
   In Medellin, a bomb tossed by one of two rival gangs in a prison
killed one prisoner and wounded 35 others Wednesday, prison
authorities there said in a news release Thursday.
   In addition, six kidnappings since Sunday include a federal
congressman and a former mayor, the national police said. The
congressman, Mario Silgado Romero, was pulled from his car
Wednesday in the northwern city of Sincelejo, the police said.
   The kidnappers apparently belong to the leftist People's
Liberation Army, a guerrilla group, the police said.

   The audience was kind when actress Lily Tomlin cut
short her one-woman show.
   After just 30 minutes Tuesday night, Ms. Tomlin gave a lengthy
apology to a near-capacity crowd. ``I just cannot serve the play,''
she said, explaining she had an extremely dry mouth because of an
anti-flu medication.
   She asked the audience what she should do and was greeted with
shouts of ``Dn't push yourself!'' and ``We love you anyway.''
   Audience members were offered a refund or tickets to another

   A robber who punched a convenience store
manager didn't realize the 72-year-old man standing by the
newspaper stand was a former light heavyweight champion.
   Former boxer Billy Conn jumped into the struggle and tried to
break up the robbery, but the crook got away Wednesday with about
$80 from the store, police said.
   Conn and the robber ended up on the floor and the thief got away
after dumping the newspaper rack on the boxer's legs, said Conn's
wife, Mary Louise, who ran out of the store to summon help.
   ``My instinct was to get help. Billy's instinct was to fight,''
she said.
   Conn declined to talk about the incident. As a boxer, he won 63,
lost 11 and fought one draw from 1935 to 1948. He held the light
heavyweight title from July 1938 to May 1941 an was elected to the
Boxing Hall of Fame in 1965.

   Spotting Miss America during her
Missouri Capitol homecoming was easy _ just look for her official
escort.
   A dozen state troopers, deputy sheriffs, and Capitol Complex
police, many in dress uniforms, walked Debbye Turner through visits
with the governor, both chambers of the Legislature, and individual
officeholders Wednesday.
   Miss Turner, an Arkansas native who is the first Missouri
resident to wear the Miss America crown, also addressed the House
and Senate after talking to 400 children in the Rotunda.
   Miss Turner explained how others told her she could never be
Miss America because she was black, too short and because her
talent _ marimba playing _ was too oddball for pageants.
   ``If this marimba-playing, five-foot-seven minority can be be
Miss America, then you can do anything,'' she said.

   Stephanie Smith Roos got a shot at fame 19
years ago singing ``It's the real thing'' in a Coca-Cola
commercial, and now she gets to do it all over again.
   Roos, a Gary native, was living with her parents in Rome when
she appeared in the classic 1971 commercial in which 40 young
people on a hillside sang ``I'd like to teach the world to sing.''
Roos was the freckled, round-faced woman with straight blonde hair
whose line closed the spot.
   Her hair is wavier now, her face thinner and the freckles are
gone, but she'll reprise the role Jan. 28 in a new Coke commercial
to appear during the Super Bowl. The new spot also features two of
her four children _ Matthew, 12, and Elicia, 10 _ with her on that
same hilltop in Sacrofano, Italy.
   ``The call from Coke in August came out of the blue,'' said
Roos, 39.
   Coke, in rounding up the original cast, had nothing more to go
on than photos from the first commercial and names discovered in a
closet at an advertising agency. Pinkerton detectives tracked down
25 of the original 40 cast members in a few months.

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter's
remarks about Iowa's drought were meant as a joke, but his Iowa
counterpart isn't amused.
   ``Secretary Yeutter unfortunately has chosen to make Iowa the
butt of his jokes,'' Iowa Agriculture Secretary Dale Cochran said
Thursday. ``The 60 percent of Iowans who earn their living directly
or indirectly from agriculture aren't laughing.''
   Yeutter made the remarks Wednesday at a Republican fund-raiser
in Topeka, Kan., attended by Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole,
R-Kan.
   ``Iowans define drought a little differently than we do in
Kansas and Nebraska,'' said Yeutter, who grew up in Nebraska. ``It
really has to be dry to have a drought here. In Iowa, as Bob put
it, it's a question of whether it rained yesterday or not. If it
didn't rain yesterday, they're having a drought.''
   Yeutter visited Iowa on May 30 to tour areas suffering from the
state's lingering drought. Southern Iowa, where Yeutter visited,
received its only measurable rainfall of the month the night before
he arrived, Cochran said.
   ``Each time as we came into land ... water was standing
everywhere,'' Yeutter said of the trip. ``They were having a little
hard time ... persuading me that they had a huge drought problem.
But they kept saying, well, but it's the subsoil moisture, you
know. It may well be wet on top, but it's really dry down below.
They got a huge digger and they dug down about eight feet and they
never did find any dry dirt.''
   Cochran said 1989 was the seventh-driest year in Iowa in 117
years of record keeping in the state. He said 1988 and 1989 ``have
gone down as the driest two-year period ever in Iowa.''

<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge today blocked sections of
Pennsylvania's new abortion law from taking effect Tuesday. The law
contains the toughest abortion restrictions in the nation.
   U.S. District Judge Daniel H. Huyett III issued an injunction
against requirements that women notify their husbands and wait 24
hours before an abortion.
   The judge left intact sections banning abortions after the 24th
week of pregnancy and abortions to select the sex of the child,
said Robert Gentzel, spokesman for state Attorney General Ernie
Preate Jr.
   The American Civil Liberties Union, the Women's Law Project and
Planned Parenthood said the order was a victory in their first
round against the new law.
   ``For the moment, in Pennsylvania, abortion remains safe and
legal, but we have to fight to keep it this way,'' Kathryn Kolbert,
an ACLU attorney, said in a statement.
   In passing the law last fall, Pennsylvania became the first
state to take advantage of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in July
allowing states to put more curbs on abortion.
   Huyett, in blocking some of the new sections, actually amended
an injunction first issued in 1988 against an earlier version of
Pennsylvania's abortion law. Planned Parenthood and some abortion
clinics had challenged the earlier law in court and amended their
lawsuit after passage of the new, tougher law.
   The injunction remains in effect while the lawsuit is decided.
   Gov. Robert P. Casey today said he believes the entire law will
pass constitutional muster.
   Anti-abortion leaders have said the law could present the U.S.
Supreme Court with an avenue to reconsider the Roe vs. Wade
decision, which established abortion as a constitutional right in
1973.
   The author of the law, Rep. Stephen Freind, said it placed
pro-choice groups in a dilemma. If the law went unchallenged, the
provisions would go into effect; if they challenged it, the case
might lead the high court to further erode abortion protections, he
said.
   ``We're in a no-loss situation. They're are in a no-win
situation,'' said Freind, a Republican from suburban Philadelphia
and the Legislature's leading abortion foe.

<TEXT>
   How many chickens would a chicken plucker
pluck if a chicken plucker had a place to sell them in Bismarck?
   At least 500 more a week, says an owner of the state's only
poultry plant.
   Mike Schmidt of S&amp;S Poultry says Bismarck ordinances are keeping
his chickens out of supermarkets and limiting the work of his
plucking machine, which can pluck about 60 pounds of chickens in 30
seconds.
   ``Bismarck is the only city in North Dakota we cannot run our
chickens in,'' Schmidt said.
   He plans to ask the City Commission on Tuesday to change its
meat inspection laws. But city officials are resisting, saying the
laws protect consumers.
   City Sanitation Coordinator Mel Fischer said Bismarck's
ordinance requires all meat to be inspected and stamped with a
retail code. Schmidt's poultry processing plant is federally
inspected, but it lacks an on-site inspector and facilities for
such an inspector.
   The inspector would be an employee of the federal Department of
Agriculture, but Schmidt would have to provide an office and
restroom and pay overtime wages for inspections.
   ``We have plans for doing it in the future, but right now money
is tight,'' Schmidt said.
   Ironically, Schmidt started his business in Mott in western
North Dakota nearly three years ago with his brother and
brother-in-law after their wives saw a television news report about
the unclean processing of chickens. They were shocked at the high
incidence of salmonella bacteria contamination and the sloppy
manner in which chickens were cleaned and cooled.
   S&amp;S works to avoid those problems, Schmidt said.
   One Bismarck grocer is interested in selling 500 chickens a
week, he said. The company sells to 30 stores in the state.

<HEAD>Thousands of Ugandans on Border Flee Civil War in Sudan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Ugandans have fled a
northern border town, fearing the spread of fighting from Sudan's
civil war, officials said Thursday.
   Loic Flachet, a Kampala representative of the French relief
group Doctors Without Borders, said 11 French volunteers were among
those who took flight from the town of Moyo.
   Brig. Moses Ali, Uganda's minister for culture who represents
the Moyo district in Parliament, confirmed the exodus but was
unable to say how many of the estimated 40,000 residents of Moyo
took part. The town is about 280 miles from Kampala and six miles
from the Sudan border.
   The Guide newspaper reported in Kampala that the civilians began
fleeing in the middle of last week when they heard gunfire near the
town. The number increased after two military aircraft flew over
Moyo on Saturday.
   Flachet said the relief team safely fled Dec. 5 to Adjumani, 27
miles to the south, and would remain there until the situation in
Moyo returned to normal. They had been treating Ugandans for
sleeping sickness, a disease transmitted by tsetse flies.
   The Guide newspaper said residents were afraid of a repeat of a
bombing in Moyo by Sudanese aircraft three months ago that killed
six civilians.
   A spokesman at army headquarters in Kampala said neither the
southern Sudan rebels nor Sudan government troops had entered
Ugandan territory.
   ``The situation is normal as far as the international border is
concerned,'' the officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Fighting between Sudanese troops and the rebel Sudan People's
Liberation Army has flared in recent months after a de facto
cease-fire to permit a U.N.-sponsored emergency foodlift to
southern Sudan.
   On Monday, the rebels claimed its fighters had captured a
garrison town of Kajo-Kaji 18 miles north of Moyo.
   The rebels often seek sanctuary in northern Uganda, raising
tension on the border.
   On Dec. 29, a Sudanese army armored vehicle and six truckloads
of soldiers crossed six miles inside Uganda in the Moyo area.
   Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and a six-member Sudanese
delegation agreed Tuesday that the countries should each establish
units to monitor security violations along the common border.
   The Sudanese rebels took up arms in 1983 against the
Moslem-dominated Khartoum government to press for increased
autonomy for the predominantly animist and Christian south.

   More than two-thirds of Americans surveyed
said they favor a consitutional limitation on the number of years a
person can serve in Congress, according to a Gallup survey released
Thursday.
   The poll, conducted for the National Federation of Independent
Business, found 70 percent of respondents favored in general a
limitation on House and Senate members, while 28 percent opposed
and 2 percent had no opinion.
   Asked if they would support establishing a 12-year limit on
service in the House and Senate, 58 percent said yes and 40 percent
opposed.
   The National Federation of Independent Businesses, an
association of small business owners, also had the Gallup
Organization Inc. put the questions to members of Congresss. It
reported surveying 158 of the 435 House members, and finding 73
percent opposed and 23 percent favored a 12-year limitation.
   It surveyed 21 of 100 senators and found 52 percent favored a
limitation and 48 percent opposed _ but the Gallup Organization
said it surveyed too few for the results to be considered a
reliable reflection of Senate opinion.
   The poll found 62 percent of total respondents favored
establishing a mandatory retirement age for members of Congress,
while 37 percent opposed. Nine out of 10 House and Senate members
surveyed opposed an age limit.
   George Gallup, who presented the results at a news conference,
said the findings were consistent with 50 years of surveying of
attitudes about Congress by his organization.
   The survey of 750 people was conducted nationally by telephone
in December and January and had a stated margin of error of plus or
minus 4 to 5 percentage points, according to the business group.
There was no margin listed for the survey of members of Congress.

<HEAD>Government Cuts Homeless Aid From Counties in 30 States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some 126 counties that got aid for the
homeless last year through a program created by Congress have been
dropped for 1990. They include 20 with double-digit unemployment
and one with a poverty rate of 42.7 percent.
   Advocates for the homeless, as well as local officials in the 30
states hit by the cutback, are protesting. But program
administrators say they are merely fulfilling a mandate to target
the aid to the nation's worst-off areas.
   Congress didn't cut funds for the $124.9 million Emergency Food
and Shelter National Board Program. The 126 jurisdictions lost out
when they fell below eligibility levels for local poverty,
unemployment or the size of the overall labor force. Some may still
get limited grants from a separate fund set aside for underfunded
areas.
   Twenty-eight new counties became eligible this year.
   The rejected counties are as large as Oklahoma's Tulsa County,
including the city of Tulsa, and as small as Madison Parish, La.
   Madison has unemployment and poverty rates of 16 percent and
42.7 percent respectively. But the parish, which got $22,000 in
1989, lost its eligibility because it had fewer than the required
total of 1,000 people unemployed, according to the program's
figures.
   Told the list said there were 883 jobless people in Madison,
parish administrative assistant Geneva Jones said, ``I know it's
more than that.'' But whatever the exact figure, she said the loss
of money would hurt the elderly in her area.
   ``Most of them are on fixed incomes and by the time they pay
their utilities, they don't have enough for adequate food,'' she
said in a telephone interview.
   The United Way was no happier in the urban county of Tulsa,
where officials complained to federal administrators in a Nov. 30
letter: ``While on the face of it, this (denial) would seem to be a
positive reflection of an improving local economy, nothing could be
further from the truth.''
   Program staff director Wylie B. Cooper said in an interview,
``Communities change in what's happening. Last year, Texas was
incredibly hard hit, and this year it is beginning to recover. That
happens all over the country because the money is designated for
the most critical need areas.''
   But Jim Cieslar of Tulsa's United Way said there have been new
oil company layoffs in his area.
   The national program's Cooper said that the system was designed
``to supplement and extend'' efforts on behalf of the homeless and
that the government cannot guarantee funding to individual counties
beyond one year.
   ``The flip side of predictability is being unable to respond to
change,'' Cooper said.
   But Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., said, ``You don't suddenly
become a non-needy area. There ought to be a way to come down
slowly.''
   Grant money may be used to buy and distribute food, run homeless
shelters, assist with mortgages or help the poor pay energy bills.
Counties don't apply for grants. Rather, they are told if the
formula qualifies them for money, and then must come up with a
spending plan.
   This year, 882 counties automatically qualified for aid compared
with 980 in 1989, said program aide Sharon Bailey.
   The National Alliance To End Homelessness, a private research
and assistance group, estimates as many as 2 million people are
homeless for at least a portion of the year, and says the number
seems to be growing.
   ``To learn at this time, just as winter weather is beginning to
grip our area, that we will not have the resources to meet the
needs presented to us by these very vulnerable individuals and
families is disappointing, to say the least,'' Theresa Zogby,
supervisor of Catholic Social Services of Hazleton, Pa., said in a
letter last month to Kanjorski.
   Her county, Luzerne, received about $230,000 last year but
nothing this year. Despite a poverty rate above the 11 percent in
the guidelines, Luzerne was declared ineligible because the labor
force in Wilkes-Barre, its largest city, did not exceed 25,000.
   Cooper said the rule would be reversed if the national board
determines at its Jan. 19 meeting that it is unfairly preventing
needy counties from obtaining funding.
   Madison, Luzerne and the other counties and parishes may still
get aid from set-aside funds, although probably not as much as last
year. Those funds, representing 15 percent of total program
expenditures, are administered by state boards trying to cushion
the blow for communities whose eligibility has expired. Cooper said
the set-aside money is considered an important backstop.
   Ohio had the most dropped counties with 15. There were 13 in
Illinois, 11 in Texas and nine in North Carolina.
   The dropped counties or parishes with double-digit unemployment
rates, the program said, were Edgar, Fayette, Union, Wayne and
White in Illinois; Grayson, Johnson and Letcher, Lincoln and
Montgomery in Kentucky; Madison, Plaquemines and Union in
Louisiana; Washington in Missouri; Cibola and San Miguel in New
Mexico; Adams and Pike in Ohio, and Lincoln and Upshur in West
Virginia.
   The food and shelter program is governed by a national board
composed of representatives of the United Way of America, Catholic
Charities USA, the American Red Cross and other charitable
organizations.
   The program has generated praise from communities for bypassing
state bureaucracies and providing money directly to agencies that
serve the homeless.

<HEAD>Mother Of Infanticide Suspect Says She Was Unaware of Pregnancy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEYERSDALE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mother of an 18-year-old woman
charged with killing her newborn said she saw her daughter hours
before she gave birth and never suspected the teen-ager was
pregnant.
   ``She's quiet,'' Darlene Broadwater said. ``She kept everything
to herself. All she had to do was open her mouth and say, `Mom, do
you want a baby?' I'd have taken it. I'd have fed it. I'd have
given it a home.''
   Tammy Lynn Sanner of Meyersdale was arrested Monday and charged
with criminal homicide. She was being held without bond.
   Her baby, born the day before Christmas, was found Saturday in a
grocery bag in an alley. An umbilical cord was wrapped around her
neck. Coroner Wilber Miller said the infant had been strangled.
   Some of Miss Sanner's relatives suspected she was pregnant but
hadn't said anything. They said she not lived with her mother since
she was 5.
   They said Miss Sanner had not confided in any relative since the
November 1988 death of the woman who raised her, Salome Sanner, her
grandmother.
   ``In Tammy's mind, Tammy had nobody,'' said an aunt, Hilda
Sanner, also of Meyersdale.
   Miss Sanner had lived with another aunt, Bertha Lynn Sanner, in
recent months.
   Mrs. Broadwater, who lives in Avilton, Md., said she visited her
daughter the day before the birth. Her husband and Miss Sanner's
stepfather, Gerald Broadwater, also was present during the
half-hour visit.
   Broadwater said the young woman looked unhealthy and ``her
stomach was bigger than what it generally used to be.'' He thought
she was pregnant, but said nothing.
   Hilda Sanner said she began to suspect Miss Sanner was pregnant
in October. ``But I didn't want her to think I was nosing into her
business,'' she said.
   Miss Sanner's relatives believe she did not have the will to
intentionally kill an infant.
   ``Tammy didn't think on an 18-year-old basis,'' Hilda Sanner
said. ``She has a childlike way of looking at things,'' she said.

   The interim government said Thursday
that 207 Romanians were killed in September when a passenger ship
sank after colliding with a Bulgarian tugboat on the Danube river.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Romulus Neagu, who revealed the death
toll, said the accident was under investigation, the Rompres news
agency reported.
   The accident occured Sept. 10, upstream of the city port of
Galati, 125 miles northeast of Bucharest. The Romanian media, at
the time tightly controlled by the authoritarian government of
Nicolae Ceausescu, gave few details of the accident.
   The Romanian vessel sank ``in conditions of poor visibility,''
the state news agency reported at the time.

<HEAD>Northwest Engine Fall Firmly Blamed on Ice from Lavatory</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ice from a leaky lavatory caused a rear jet engine
to shear off a Northwest Airlines airliner over northern Florida
last week, federal investigators have determined.
   Blue fluid from the forward lavatory leaked outside, froze
because of the low temperature at 35,000 feet, broke off and
slammed into the compressor blades of the right rear engine on the
three-engine Boeing 727, National Transportation Safety Board
investigator Andrew Alston said Wednesday.
   The ice broke eight blades in the engine's low-pressure
compressor and the damage multiplied through other blades until
vibration made the three bolts holding the engine to the plane's
tail section break off, as they are designed to do to prevent
damage to the fuselage, Altson said.
   Airline and government officials had speculated that was the
cause.
   Pilots safely landed the plane, which carried 145 passengers and
crew, at Tampa International Airport on Jan. 4 about 90 minutes
after it had taken off from Miami bound for Minneapolis.
   The 3,500-pound Pratt &amp; Whitney engine was found the next day on
a cattle ranch in rural Madison County near the Florida-Georgia
border.
   The NTSB has not ordered any safety inspections, but is
informing all airlines about the cause of the accident, Alston said.
   Airlines do not use anti-freeze in their lavatories because it
is toxic, said Jorge Prellezo, regional director of the NTSB in
Miami.

<HEAD>Helmsleys' Ex-Manager Gets Minimal State Sentence In Plea Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frank Turco, a former executive in the Helmsley
real estate empire, was sentenced Thursday on state conspiracy and
fraud charges to eight months in prison, concurrent with a two-year
federal term he received last month.
   The sentence was part of a plea bargain, according to Turco
lawyer William Brodsky, who called it ``the best deal he could have
gotten.''
   Turco pleaded guilty Oct. 27 to four counts of a 188-count
indictment. He admitted he falsified business records so that $3
million spent on Harry and Leona Helmsley's Greenwich, Conn.,
mansion would appear as business expenses for their hotels and
other properties.
   Turco, 46, now living near Tampa, Fla., was convicted in August
with Mrs. Helmsley and Joseph V. Licari, 53, another Helmsley
executive, on federal charges of evading $1.2 million in taxes.
   On Dec. 12, Mrs. Helmsley was sentenced to four years in prison
and fined $7.2 million. Licari got 2{ years in prison and a $75,000
fine. Turco got a $50,000 fine and the two-year sentence, which he
will serve at the minimum-security federal prison at Eglin Air
Force Base in Florida, Brodsky said.
   Mrs. Helmsley, 69, is free pending appeal and still faces state
charges.
   Harry Helmsley, 80, was found incompetent to stand trial in
federal court. A hearing on his application to be excused from
state trial on similar grounds is set for Feb. 8.

<HEAD>Bush Welcomes Lifting of Matial Law in China</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-China, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Wednesday welcomed the
lifting of martial law in China as a ``very positive'' move,
despite congressional criticism that it was a meaningless gesture
by Beijing.
   Bush took the opposite view of those saying the Chinese showed
no indication they were improving their stance on human rights and
reforms.
   ``I view the lifting of martial law as a very sound step,'' the
president told reporters during an Oval Office photo session. ``For
those who are interested in the human rights and reform that was on
the move that we'd all like to see go forward, there's no way you
can look at that but say it's very positive.''
   ``Of course we welcome the lifting of martial law as a good
sign,'' he said.
   Critics took a different view of China's announcement it would
lift the martial law put into place last spring during a brutal
crackdown on thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators.
   On Capitol Hill, some have derided the lifting of martial law as
smoke-and-mirrors and an empty gesture, noting that China still
retains tough anti-protest laws and surveillance of university
campuses as well as a strong presence by its army in the streets of
Beijing.
   In addition, China did not include the Tibetan capital of Lhasa
in its lifting of martial law. Beijing said the situation was
different in Lhasa, where Buddhist monks have suffered repression
for demonstrating for religious freedoms and independence. Tibet
has been under martial law since the outbreak of pro-independence
riots in March.
   Bush on Thursday did not indicate whether he considered the move
enough of a step to spur further lifting of the sanctions he
imposed in June when the Chinese government mowed down
demonstrators with tanks, killing hundreds, perhaps thousands in
the streets.
   ``We will continue to watch this situation very closely,'' he
said.
   On Wednesday the administration announced that it would review
on a case-by-case basis World Bank loans to China for humanitarian
causes, but would continue to oppose loans to China for projects.
   That marked a shift from the initial position on sanctions,
which made no mention of evaluating humanitarian loans. The State
Department has said the partial easing of the sanctions was
unrelated to China's lifting of martial law.
   Among $780 million worth of pending World Bank loans to China is
a $25 million loan for earthquake relief. Bank spokesman Peter
Riddleberger said Thursday the bank board had no discussions
scheduled on the loan.
   Bush has come under fire for what critics say was his failure to
come down hard on China, the country where he served as U.S.
representative in the mid-1970s.
   Although he announced in June he was banning high-level contacts
with Beijing as part of the sanctions, Bush secretly dispatched
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of
State Lawrence Eagleburger to Beijing twice in subsequent months to
explore the possibilities of renewing relations.

   Until Jan. 1, the only member of the family of
Charles Stuart who knew of his plot to kill his pregnant wife was
the youngest brother who linked him to the crime, an attorney said
Thursday.
   ``They knew nothing, they did nothing, they saw nothing, they
touched nothing,'' attorney Richard Clayman said of other family
members at a news conference attended by Stuart's siblings Michael,
Mark, Shelley and Neysa. Only Matthew Stuart, who turned his
brother in, did not attend.
   ``The appearance that has evolved in my judgment is that there
was some kind of conspiracy. That is not true, and these people
want you, and the DiMaiti family, and eveyrone else to know that is
so,'' said Clayman, who represents Michael Stuart but spoke on
behalf of the family.
   Clayman said his client would tell a grand jury anything they
want to know, ``I am comfortable that there is no violation of law
... that his hands are legally clean.''
   He also said the Stuart family wanted people to know ``they
loved Carol Stuart'' and that their family and her parents, Eveylyn
and Giusto DiMaiti, had suffered greatly.
   He said that on looking back Michael Stuart had a ``disjointed,
vague conversation'' with Charles Stuart but that it had no
significance at the time.
   ``In retrospect, after examining all the data there an argument
can be made ... that it had some significance,'' he said.
   Since the case began unraveling last week, the street outside
the Stuart family home in Revere has been the daily assembly point
for neighbors and about a dozen reporters and photographers.
   Stuart told police after the Oct. 23 shooting that he and his
wife, Carol, were attacked by a mugger as they left a birthing
class at a city hospital. But in a stunning turnaround last week,
his brother, Matthew, implicated him in the death, saying he met
Charles Stuart at the crime scene and retrieved Mrs. Stuart's
handbag, which contained personal items, and the gun.
   Matthew Stuart, who has said he did not realize a shooting had
occurred when he took the items, told his lawyer he had shared his
suspicions about his brother with family and friends.
   A transcript of a telephone conversation between Michael and a
sister, Shelley Yandoli, recorded on firehouse communications
equipment, revealed that the parents and another sister, Neysa
Porter, did not know of Stuart's plot until the family assembled
Jan. 2 to discuss it with the parents.
   Meanwhile, divers searched the Pines River again Thursday for
clues in the plot, which may have evolved from little more than
Stuart's feeling that his wife and baby would hinder his dreams of
being a big-time restaurateur.
   Police divers recovered the handbag shortly after Stuart
committed suicide Jan. 4 by jumping from the Tobin Bridge into
Boston Harbor, and Tuesday they found a snub-nosed .38-caliber
revolver believed used in the crime.
   Prosecutors have refused to say whether anyone might be charged
in the crime, saying the investigation is continuing. A grand jury
is to convene Friday on the case.
   Authorities have investigated whether Stuart might have plotted
the murder so he could collect money from insurance policies on his
wife. Stuart received $82,000 from one policy due his wife from her
job as a tax attorney. He had taken out at least one other policy
on her, for $100,000, that was being processed when he committed
suicide.

<HEAD>Black Firefighters Want 15-Month-Old Promotion Freeze Continued</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET McCONNAUGHEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 15-month freeze on promotions in the
Dallas Fire Department should be continued at least until a
discrimination lawsuit against the department goes to trial, an
attorney for black firefighters told a federal appeals court
Thursday.
   ``Right now the system isn't even fair among blacks. Black
firefighters who are getting through may not be the ones who would
if the system was fair,'' attorney Roger Albright told a
three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Craig Hopkins argued for the city of Dallas that the 220-member
Black Fire Fighters Association of Dallas has not proved that its
members would suffer irreparable harm without a freeze on
promotions. In addition, he said, the case shouldn't even be before
the 5th Circuit yet because the black firefighters haven't
exhausted their civil service appeals.
   The judges did not indicate when they would rule.
   The department's freeze on promotions began in October 1988, a
month after the black firefighters sued the department alleging
racial discrimination. The city has since enacted a new affirmative
action plan for the department, but the black firefighters say it
doesn't go far enough.
   During the promotion freeze, the city has filled the need for
supervisors by temporarily promoting lower-level workers.
   U.S. District Judge Robert W. Porter rejected the black group's
request for an order continuing the freeze on promotions pending
the trial, but both sides agreed to continue the freeze while the
black group appealed to the 5th Circuit, Albright said.
   Porter is in ill health, attorneys told the judges, and they
don't know when the discrimination case may go to trial.
   Hal Gillespie, attorney for the predominantly white Dallas
firefighters group, who joined the city in arguing that the freeze
should be discontinued, said people who already qualified for
promotion are losing out because the promotion lists have expired.
   When the lawsuit was filed, Albright said after the hearing,
blacks made up 35 percent of the city's population but 17 percent
of the 1,700 people in the fire department.
   Out of 367 drivers _ the first level up from fire and rescue
workers _ 17 percent were black. Five of 121 lieutenants, or rougly
4 percent, were black, as were six of 182 captains, or 3 percent,
and one of 22 battalion chiefs, or 4{ percent.
   Blacks contend that a major reason for the disparity is that
promotion exams ask for knowledge beyond what is useful for each
level. The exam for driver, for instance, includes questions about
building codes and construction, said Albright.
   ``Our point of view is that the exams test for things that a
firefighter ought to know at any level,'' Hopkins said after the
hearing.
   During the hearing, Senior Judge John R. Brown asked Hopkins if
Dallas hadn't contradicted its legal stand by adopting an
affirmative action plan calling for blacks to get 25 percent of all
fire department promotions.
   The plan approved by the City Council expands the pool of
eligible minorities for promotion by putting less emphasis on
seniority and test scores and more on affirmative action. The
council also agreed to spend more than $400,000 to re-evaluate
hiring and promotion tests.
   ``This is not the first affirmative action plan. It's a
modification and continuation of previous efforts ...,'' Hopkins
responded. ``It is not an admission of wrongdoing, but that there
can always be improvements.''

<DATELINE>ST. AUGUSTINE BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a two-year dispute over
pesky ducks, the city has committed itself to helping residents who
want to drive them from an exclusive beach community.
   City Commissioners voted 4-1 Monday to let residents in the
Woodlands area capture ducks on their property, call the city and
have the ducks picked up and released unharmed in a rural area.
   When asked Wednesday about what the program would cost
taxpayers, City Manager Max Royle said, ``Twenty bucks a duck.''
   Commissioner Paul Von Ins had introduced a petition with 39
signatures asking the commission to come up with a way to enforce a
decision made in June to drive the Muscovy ducks out of the
neighborhood.
   Mayor Pete Dobson cast the dissenting vote, saying pro-duck
forces had not been given the opportunity to respond to the
petition.
   The dispute began in January 1988 when the commission voted to
reduce the duck population from 150 to 20 after some residents
complained that the ugly, mottled birds defecated on their lawns,
mated in public and acted aggressively toward other animals. Others
felt the ducks predated homeowners in the area, and had every right
to stay.
   Gradually the population was reduced to six or seven as a
special duck committee approved the snatching of duck eggs to keep
them from hatching, and even arranged for the removal of some of
the adults. Von Ins said, however, that the population could
rebound.

<HEAD>Jurors in Utility Case Treated to Tour of Nuclear Power Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jurors who heard a long court battle between
Houston Power &amp; Lighting and the city of Austin have been invited
on an expense-paid trip to see the nuclear power plant that was the
focus of last summer's trial.
   The jury had ruled that the utility didn't have to pay the city
damages.
   Some Austin officials questioned the plan's propriety.
   The utility confirmed that about a month ago it had invited the
Dallas jurors and retired appellate court Judge Clarence Guittard,
who presided over the four-month trial, to visit the South Texas
Nuclear Project plant at HL&amp;P expense, the Houston Chronicle
reported Thursday.
   ``This is a bunch of people who spent an inordinate amount of
time studying the plant and never got a chance to see it,'' said
HL&amp;P spokesman Graham Painter.
   The jurors decided in July that although HL&amp;P denied information
to one of its partners in the STNP _ the city of Austin _ Austin
deserved no damage payments. Austin had sought $419 million and is
appealing the jury's decision. The trial was held in Dallas after a
judge decided a fair trial could not be held in Austin.
   Painter said the company decided that jurors should stay
overnight in Houston because of the time it takes to get from
Dallas to the plant site at Bay City, 90 miles southwest of Houston.
   He said HL&amp;P has reserved 19 rooms in the Westin Oaks at the
Galleria, where single rooms run $150 a night during the week and
half that on weekends.
   ``We're awfully proud of our plant, and we'd like to show it
off,'' Painter said. Besides, he said, ``They are the only people
in Texas who are certain never to serve on an STP jury again, so
there's no reason they shouldn't go on a plant tour.''
   Juror Kathy LaMarr agreed: ``I want to see what it was we were
talking about all that time.''
   But some Austin officials are outraged.
   ``It's highly unprofessional and very questionable. Until the
people of Texas realize that this sort of shenanigans cost the
people hundreds of millions of dollars, it won't stop,'' said
Austin City Councilman George Humphrey.
   ``When you have a jury that rules the defendant is guilty and
awards no damages and a short time later, they're offered free air
fare, free lodging, free meals and first-class treatment, it can't
help but cast a doubt,'' Humphrey said.
   ``I've never heard of this happening in civil litigation. I
think it's fundamentally unethical, but so what else is new?'' said
Councilman Smoot Carl-Mitchell.
   Austin claimed in the trial that HL&amp;P withheld information from
its partners that would have lead the city to move to cancel
construction of the plant before its cost ballooned from $900
million to almost $6 billion, not counting interest costs on
construction that lasted 17 years.
   During the trial, specialists in engineering, accounting and law
were called on and jurors were shown a million-dollar scale model
of the nuclear power plant.

   Communist Premier Hans Modrow on Thursday
defended his plan for a new internal security force and tried to
quell growing dissent by indicating the opposition could have a
part in his government.
   Thousands of people formed a human chain around Parliament after
Modrow's speech to legislators, and a non-Communist partner in the
coalition government repeated threats to quit the Cabinet.
   An independent trade union movement threatened to call a
nationwide strike Jan. 25 if Modrow fails to prove the state secret
police force has been dissolved.
   In a nearly 90-minute speech before the national Parliament,
Modrow defended his authority and appealed for national unity to
fight the economic and political problems threatening his shaky
government, which came to power after the fall pro-democracy
movement.
   ``I cannot recall becoming premier through a coup,'' he said.
   Modrow did not rule out the resignation of his transitional
government for ``compelling reasons'' but said he expected it to
last until nationwide elections planned May 6.
   During the meeting, Parliament dismissed state security chief
Lt. Gen. Wolfgang Schwanitz, whose agency the government promised
last month to dissolve.
   The hated secret police, popularly known as ``Stasi,'' used
repressive measures to help ensure 40 years of Communist control.
   Government officials say about 26,000 of the 85,000 state
security employees have been taken off the payroll. Opposition
groups want guarantees the force will be disarmed and assurances
former agents will not have a part in a new agency.
   ``The aim is not to maintain the old structure'' of state
security, Modrow said.
   But he told Parliament ``there cannot be a security vacuum,''
and cited violence by neo-Nazi groups as well as ``terrorism, drugs
and ecological crime.''
   Modrow urged the opposition to make suggestions about how it
would be prepared to ``participate directly and responsibly in the
work of the government with competent personalities.''
   However, Modrow did not say when or in what form such
participation could take place.
   He offered to have Parliament supervise the new security agency
and dissolution of its predecessor.
   Within hours, the Liberal Democrats, a non-Communist partner in
the government, repeated their threat to leave.
   ``There can be no compromise with us'' on the secret police
issue, said party spokesman Werner Fahlenkamp.
   Two other non-Communist parties in government have threatened to
quit over the issue.
   Several thousand opposition supporters chanting and holding
candles formed a human chain around the Parliament building.
Demonstrators lowered several East German flags from their poles
and ripped out the Communist symbol from the centers.
   Representatives of the ``Initiative For Labor Union Reform,''
which claims 70,000 members, called for Modrow's resignation and
the freezing of Communist Party assets.
   They threatened to call a nationwide warning strike Jan. 25, to
demonstrate their strength, if they are not convinced the security
agency has been dissolved.
   Earlier, East Berlin construction workers staged such a strike,
which lasted one hour, and marched through the city center. The ADN
news agency said 2,000 workers at a farm equipment factory in
Erfurt also staged a strike Thursday.
   Modrow, responding to the warning strikes, announced the
government would suspend a plan for state aid to internal security
employees who lost their jobs.
   For the first time, opposition members sat as observers in
Thursday's Parliament session. Modrow's speech was broadcast live
on East German and West German TV.
   News reports had said Modrow was considering calling for a
national referendum to gauge the public support for his government
before May, but he made no mention of this.
   Several old guard Communists in the 500-seat Parliament lost
their seats to younger deputies Thursday. Those ousted included
Guenther Schabowski, a former Politburo member and close associate
of disgraced former leader Erich Honecker.
   At the start of the session, Parliament speaker Guenther Maleuda
confirmed a West German report that Johanna Toepfer, once the No. 2
official in the government-run labor union federation FDGB,
committed suicide Sunday.
   Ms. Toepfer was forced to resign in November during the
pro-democracy movement that drove out hard-line Communist leaders
and cleared the way for scheduling of free elections May 6. Maleuda
gave no details of the suicide.

<HEAD>Palestinians, Hezbollah Clash as PLO Seeks to Quell Militia
Fighting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The PLO on Thursday accused fighters of a
pro-Iranian militia of killing a Palestinian guerrilla and wounding
three others deployed to quell battles between Shiite Moslem
militias in south Lebanon.
   The fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God, issued a
statement in Beirut denying the PLO charge and said its fighters
``did not fire a single shot on Palestinian positions.''
   But a Sunni Moslem cleric, Sheik Maher Hammoud, who maintains
close ties with Hezbollah, said fundamentalist fighters fired at
the Palestinians on the strategic Hamade hill, which overlooks the
forward lines of Hezbollah and its rival militia, the Syrian-backed
Amal.
   The militias have been fighting intermittently since May 1987
for dominance of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites. The latest battles
have been waged on the fringes of PLO strongholds, in south
Lebanon's Iqlim al-Tuffah, or apple province.
   About 700 members of Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement were
deployed last week to try to disengage the warring factions, and no
major clashes have occurred since Monday between the militias.
   The PLO claimed Hezbollah gunners opened fire on a PLO
disengagement force Wednesday, killing one guerrilla and wounding
three.
   The commander of the Fatah force, identified only as Col. Abu
Fadi, said the guerrillas ``will be forced to return fire to defend
ourselves'' if Hezbollah fires on them again.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said Hezbollah believes the PLO intervention has
helped Amal and stopped Hezbollah from taking the entire region.
   Police could not confirm the Palestinian casualties. They said
the bodies of two slain Hezbollah fighters were found early
Thursday in Iqlim al-Tuffah.
   The police spokesman said the two men were apparently
slaughtered by Amal militiamen after being taken captive.
   Police said one Hezbollah gunman was also killed and two Amal
militiamen were wounded in a brief shootout in the village of Arki,
six miles southwest from the main area of fighting.
   The casualties, excluding the Palestinians, upped the overall
toll to 97 dead and 277 wounded since the current round of clashes
broke out Dec. 23.
   Fatah's political chief in the southern city of Sidon, Zeid
Wehbe, refused a Hezbollah appeal for the withdrawal of Arafat's
men from Iqlim al-Tuffah.
   ``We are not an occupying force to be asked to withdraw,'' Wehbe
said in a statement published in several Beirut newspapers.
   ``We are a disengagement force. When fighting is over and its
consequences are solved, we will return to our previous bases,'' he
was quoted as saying by the independent An-Nahar daily.
   Iran's deputy foreign minister, Mohammad Ali Besharati, who is
in Beirut trying to enforce a cease-fire, has warned of the dangers
of the Palestinians' expansion in Iqlim al-Tuffah and called on
them to withdraw promptly to their nearby refugee camps.
   But sources from both Shiite factions spoke of a deadlock.
   In public statements, Amal chieftain Nabih Berri insists on an
unconditional withdrawal of Hezbollah from all territories it
conquered during the latest round of fighting.
   Hezbollah has offered a gradual withdrawal, coinciding with
negotiations on finding a way for both militias to exist in the
region.
   There was sporadic sniper fire interspersed with blasts from
rocket-propelled grenades Thursday, but no casualties were reported.

   Orange production is expected to drop 24
percent this season to fewer than 158 million boxes, the
Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   The new estimate, based on Jan. 1 conditions and reflecting the
severe freeze damage in Florida and Texas over the holiday season,
was 19 percent below the Dec. 1 estimate.
   Overall citrus production, including oranges and grapefruit, is
expected to decline 25 percent from the 1988-89 season to 9.63
million tons, the report said. The January estimate is down 18
percent from December.
   ``This significant reduction is due mostly to the severe
freezing temperatures in the Florida and Texas citrus belts,'' the
report said. ``Fruit droppage is increasing in all areas of
Florida. Texas fresh market citrus harvest has ended.''
   The report added that it is ``too early to determine if there is
significant wood damaage or tree loss'' in either Florida or Texas.
   Florida's orange harvest was estimated at 92 million boxes, down
from 146.6 million last season and 130 million forecast in
December. The Texas crop was estimated at 1.25 million boxes, down
from 1.85 million last year and 1.95 forecast in December.
   Total grapefruit output was forecast at 45.6 million boxes, down
30 percent from last season and 16 percent below the December
forecast.
   Florida grapefruit production was indicated at 38 million boxes,
down from 54.75 million last season and 44 million last month. The
Texas crop, forecast at 2 million boxes, compared with 4.8 million
last year and 4.4 million estimated in December.

   When Johnny Sylvester's father wanted a second
opinion about his sick boy, he consulted Babe Ruth. The baseball
legend's treatment was unorthodox _ a 1926 World Series home run.
   John Dale Sylvester, 74, died Monday. But Ruth's purported
promise and delivery of a home run lives on, memorialized in
newspapers, biographies and on film, though wildly distorted.
   ``So many things about Babe Ruth have become like Greek
mythology,'' baseball historian Don Honig said after hearing of
Sylvester's death.
   Sylvester died at a hospital on New York's Long Island. No cause
of death was given.
   According to news reports from the time, Sylvester was kicked in
the head by a horse, suffering a life-threatening injury which left
the 11-year-old boy bedridden in Essex Fells, N.J.
   Johnny reportedly told his father, Manhattan bank vice president
Horace Sylvester, ``Gee, I wish I could see Babe Ruth wallop a
homer before I die.''
   The elder Sylvester contacted Ruth's team, the New York Yankees,
in St. Louis via telegram, recounting his son's request.
Autographed balls from the Yankees and the St. Louis Cardinals were
sent to the lad; Ruth wrote on one ball, ``I'll hit a home run for
you in Wednesday's game.''
   The Sultan of Swat then hit three homers in the Yankees' 10-5
fourth game victory over the Cardinals. Johnny's doctors reported
the boy had bounced back remarkably from his illness, and a legend
was born. Sylvester quickly became America's most famous invalid.
   ``That and the called home run _ those two specific incidents
are probably the best known Ruth stories,'' said Robert Creamer,
author of the biography ``Babe.''
   ``The incident is sort of characteristic of Ruth. He had a great
sort of ingenious quality about him,'' said Creamer. ``He'd do
things like this, sometimes with great publicity, sometimes with no
publicity.''
   When William Bendix portrayed ``The Bambino'' on film, the story
had Ruth bedside with a dying boy when the home run was promised.
It was far from accurate, but as Creamer noted, ``That was a pretty
bad movie.''
   One week later, Ruth visited the lad. Johnny, well aware that
Ruth had been caught stealing for the final out in the Yankees
series loss, told the Babe, ``I'm sorry the Yanks lost.''
   Sylvester went on to attend Princeton University, serve in World
War II, and become president of packing machinery business. His
son, John Jr., said his dad remained a Yankees fan until the end.
Slyvester is also survived by a sister and a brother.
   The whole Johnny Sylvester story apparently had little effect on
the Babe. According to Creamer's biography, Ruth was sitting around
with a couple of baseball writers during spring training in 1927
when Sylvester's uncle approached the Babe and thanked him
profusely.
   ``How is Johnny?'' Ruth asked. The uncle assured the Babe that
Johnny was doing OK and walked away.
   Ruth, who was notoriously bad with names and referred to most
everyone as ``kid,'' turned to the reporters and asked, ``Now who
the hell is Johnny Sylvester?''

<HEAD>Administration Pushing for Alternative-Fuel Cars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration renewed its push
Thursday to require the sale of hundreds of thousands of
alternative-fuel automobiles by the late 1990s in urban areas
having the worst air pollution problems.
   William Rosenberg, associate administrator of the Environmental
Protection Agency, told a Senate hearing that clean air legislation
must ``break the monopoly'' that exists for conventional gasoline
and give motorists an opportunity to use less polluting fuels.
   The phase-in of up to 1 million vehicles powered by fuels other
than gasoline had been proposed by President Bush last summer as
part of his clean air package, but the provision was cut from
legislation under consideration in the House and never included in
a Senate version.
   Administration officials and environmentalists hope to reinstate
the alternative fuel provision into clean air legislation that is
moving toward floor consideration in both the House and Senate.
   The automakers have opposed any federal requirement for
alternative fuel vehicles, arguing that they fear consumers will
not want them, and were successful in getting the provisons knocked
out of a House clean air bill earlier this year.
   If Congress were to require such cars, it also should require
incentives to stimulate consumer demand for them and ease stringent
tailpipe emission controls required in the proposed legislation
beginning after the year 2003, said Donald Buist of the Ford Motor
Co.
   But leading Democrats in the Senate have said they are not
prepared to trade a clean fuel car program for the more stringent
pollution control standards that would apply to all new vehicles
across the country under legislation advancing in the Senate.
   Rosenberg said the use of alternative fuel cars is ``a vital and
integral part'' of any effort to clean up the worst urban smog that
plagues nine specific urban areas.
   Among the fuels to be considered is methanol, ethanol, natural
gas, and propane, he said.
   In urban areas with the worst pollution, the only other way to
meet federal air quality at the turn of the century will be to
dramaticaly restrict automobile use, an option he said is not
considered appropriate.
   Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, the committee's ranking
Republican, said he plans to offer an amendment to the Senate air
pollution control bill that would require automakers to begin
making 150,000 alternative fuel vehicles available in California
within four years and phase similar cars in eight other urban areas
beginning in 1997.
   Under the Chafee proposal nearly a third of the cars sold in the
nine cities would be powered by fuel or a blend other than gasoline
by 1999.
   ``Just cleaning up the tailpipe (emissions) on cars hasn't been
enough to assure healthy air quality,'' said Chafee, who compared
the problem to a treadmill on which tighter pollution controls on
individual gasoline powered cars are often offset by the increased
number of cars on the road.
   According to the EPA, the cities where air quality is so poor
that alternative fuel cars would be required are Los Angeles, where
local officials already are developing similar requirements,
Houston, New York, Milwaukee, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Hartford,
San Diego and Chicago.

   President Bush and Portugal's prime minister,
Anibal Cavaco Silva, discussed prospects Thursday for ending the
fighting in Angola but ``didn't agree on absolutely every point,''
an administration official said.
   Assistant Secretary of State Raymond Seitz refused repeatedly to
say where the president and prime minister differed on developments
in the former Portuguese colony, located along the southwest coast
of Africa.
   ``They basically traded analyses,'' Seitz said. ``Didn't agree
on absolutely every point but did agree that the goal of national
reconciliation (in Angola) is what the purpose of the process is,
and both sides agreed that every effort ought to be made to bring
about that reconciliation.''
   Cavaco Silva, on an official working visit, talked with Bush for
2{ hours in the Oval Office and during a luncheon.
   A key issue was the impasse in talks in Angola between the
Soviet-backed government supported by Portugal and the UNITA rebels
armed by the United States.
   A truce between the government and the rebels broke down last
summer, and the Angolan government unleashed a new offensive
against UNITA on Dec. 23.
   ``There was a lot of discussion as to why the cease-fire broke
down,'' Seitz reported after the talks. ``There are some different
interpretations as to how we have arrived at this particular
point.''
   Publicly, Bush and Cavaco Silva glossed over any differences.
Bush called the prime minister a good friend and said that
U.S.-Portuguese relations ``are stronger than ever.''
   In his only comments on Angola, Bush said Portugal had historic
ties to the southern African region.
   He said, ``We value the perspective and support'' that Portugal
has given to efforts by Zaire's President, Mobutu Sese Seko, to
mediate an end to the conflict.
   ``When peace and stability come to that region, as certainly we
hope they will, Portugal will have an important role in the
reconstruction process,'' Bush said.
   Cavaco Silva said he briefed Bush on consultations with the
Angolan and Mozambique governments ``and expressed the hope that if
all interested parties show a positive attitude, it will be
possible to put an end to the conflict that exacts such a heavy
toll on the peoples of those two African countries.''
   On another subject, Cavaco Silva assured Bush that that Portugal
``is in favor of a continued commitment and presence of the United
States in Europe, which is a key factor for Europe's own security.''
   Bush called Portugal ``an inspiration and an example to Eastern
Europe countries, as they emerge from the darkness of political and
economic authoritarianism. The Portuguese experience has
demonstrated that peaceful, democratic change and progress are
possible.''
   U.S. investment in Portugal has doubled to more than $1 billion
from 1988 to 1989.

<TEXT>
   More than 10,000 people rallied Thursday
in Athens to protest Albania's treatment of ethnic Greeks, and a
newspaper reported that the hard-line Communist leadership of
Albania imposed a state of emergency on a northern city.
   The report of unrest in Shkoder, Albania's second largest city,
could not be confirmed. An Albanian diplomat in Vienna called the
report by the Yugoslav daily Politika an ``absurdity'' that is part
of ``an angry smear campaign'' against his country, the last
bastion of Stalinism in Eastern Europe.
   Black-robed bishops and Albanian emigres led the Athens rally,
which coinciding with the anniversary of the founding of the
Communist state in Albania in 1946.
   ``I am warning the Tirana (Albanian) regime that the policy it
has followed up to now will lead to international isolation and
certain collapse,'' said Archbishop Serapheim, primate of the
Orthodox church in Greece.
   ``In all of Eastern Europe ... the systems of atheism and
suppression of the people are falling,'' Serapheim said. ``Only the
Albanian regime remains uncompromising and continues with its
vicious policies.''
   In Belgrade, the state-run Politika daily said the state of
emergency was imposed to quell popular unrest in Shkoder.
   The Yugoslav report said ``a group of young people tried to
organize demonstrations passing leaflets'' late last year in
Shkoder, 60 miles northwest of Albania's capital of Tirana. Five
people were sentenced to death and executed, it claimed.
   The Belgrade newspaper did not give the source of its
information, say when the state of emergency was introduced or give
any other details on the reported order. Albania is closed to most
foreigners, and it was impossible to verify the claims in the
newspaper report.
   Albania has resisted the democratic reforms sweeping the rest of
the region. It has sharply restricted travel, and its secret police
monitor contacts with foreigners.
   Relations have been strained between Greece and its northern
neighbor since 1916, when the province of Northern Epirus was
incorporated in Albania.
   The church claims the Greek minority in Albania makes up about
400,000 of the country's 3 million people. They say the ethnic
Greeks are not allowed to move freely, to practice religion and to
study Greek in school.
   Albania contends the Greek minority does not exceed 60,000.
   The Greek church claimed in December that four ethnic Greek
Albanians were tortured and killed last year after failing to
escape to Greece.
   The Greek Foreign Ministry has questioned the validity of an
Albanian videotape purporting to show three of the four brothers
celebrating the New Year, after the Greek charge d'affaires in
Tirana was prohibited from visiting the brothers.
   Foreign Minister Antonis Samaras drew a protest from Tirana last
month when he said Greeks should be free to celebrate Christmas in
Albania.
   An Albanian newspaper, Zeri I Popullit, on Wednesday accused
emigres of trying to foment unrest in the isolated Balkan nation,
saying they wanted to restore the pre-World War II monarchy.

   A military tanker caught fire and
exploded on the ground Thursday, and two Guardsmen doing
maintenance on board escaped unharmed, authorities said.
   The Air National Guard KC-135 tanker, used to fuel other
aircraft in flight, had been grounded because of fuel storage
problems on other KC-135s, Lt. Col. Joseph Riley said. Two of the
tankers exploded last year, and a third crashed on takeoff, killing
a total of 25 people.
   The Guard plane was parked near a runway at Pease Air Force
Base, which President Bush uses when he travels to his
Kennebunkport, Maine, vacation home.
   Guardsmen were working on one of the plane's many fuel cells _
rubber storage bladders _ when one caught fire about 10:30 a.m.,
Riley said. He said one of the Guardsmen ran to summon help and the
other followed after briefly trying to extinguish the fire, which
began toward the back of the plane.
   Riley said the plane exploded shortly afterward and burned for
about a half-hour. Fire trucks surrounded the plane and
firefighters continued spraying it with chemicals 90 minutes after
the accident.
   One base firefighter suffered a dislocated shoulder when the
plane exploded.
   Two holes were visible from above, one near the cockpit and the
other near the tail. Riley said the plane, which cost about $12
million, was severely damaged and possibly a total loss.
   Riley said the four-engine plane, which holds 31,000 gallons of
fuel, had no fuel on board. He said the cause of the fire and
explosion was under investigation.
   An Air Force KC-135 tanker exploded over Canada on Oct. 4,
killing all four crew members. An Alaska National Guard KC-135
exploded and burned Sept. 20 at Eielson Air Force Base, killing two
people.
   On Jan. 31, all 19 people aboard a KC-135 died when it crashed
on takeoff from Dyess Air Force Base in Texas.

<TEXT>
   The Illinois House asked state
officials not to close a museum exhibit featuring the skeletons of
234 prehistoric American Indians without holding public hearings.
   Officials of the Dickson Mounds Museum near Lewistown announced
last week that the exhibit would close to the public Feb. 1, to
avoid offending Indians.
   ``No one had any idea the decision was coming,'' said state Rep.
Tom Homer, sponsored the resolution approved Wednesday by voice
vote. ``We never even heard there was any opposition to the
exhibit.''
   Although the resolution is not binding, Homer said it should
influence Gov. James R. Thompson and officials from the State
Department of Energy and Natural Resources to reconsider.
   David Fields, a spokesman for Thompson, said Thompson still
concurs with the decision to close the display of excavated bones
while leaving open the nearby interpretive center, Fields said.
   Karen Witter, director of the state energy and natural resources
department, which oversees the museum, said Wednesday she still
stands by the closure decision.
   ``We'll have to look into the resolution's details to decide how
we'll respond,'' she said.

<HEAD>Returning Exiles Vow to Help Romania</HEAD>

   Romanian exiles who returned to Britain after
bringing food and medical supplies to their homeland pledged
Thursday to help Romania consolidate the gains of its revolution.
   ``It is unbelievable that I am alive to see what has happened.
Now I am looking forward to doing whatever little part I can play
in making sure Romania is going to be and remain a free and
democratic country,'' said former folk dancer George Tecucianu.
   Asked if he wanted to return to Romania to live, Tecucianu said:
``My heart tells me `yes.'''
   The exiles spoke after flying food and medicine to Romania on
Wednesday and returning here early Thursday. Each of the 100
passengers on the British Island Airways charter brought 55 pounds
of food and medical supplies.
   The flight was organized by a London-based group, the Relief
Fund for Romania.
   Among those on the plane was Prince Paul, 41-year-old nephew of
Romania's deposed King Michael.
   While most passengers returned, the prince stayed in Romania.
The prince, who has a British passport, told reporters: ``The (new)
Romanian government has promised itself to be a democratic
government. It is time to visit as so many people have suffered,
and I want to see what I can do to help.''
   Among the passengers now living in Britain after fleeing Nicolae
Ceausescu's Communist dictatorship was London University physics
lecturer George Ross.
   He told reporters, ``We found out how we could help from London,
particularly by offering academic scholarships.''
   He said he left Romania in 1963 because of his political views
and that it was his first visit home since then.
   Another passenger was actress Magdalena Buznea. She said she
left Romania in 1969 after she was harassed by the Securitate
secret police. ``I left because I couldn't stand it any longer,''
she said.
   She met her brother in Bucharest on Wednesday.
   ``Everyone in Romania is happy. They are all deliriously happy.
They are happy that man (Ceausescu) is not there any more,'' she
said.
   Another passenger was a British father from Essex county in
eastern England. He visited an orphanage in Romania in the hopes of
finding a child to adopt.
   Television reports in the West last week showed overcrowded
Romanian orphanages and blamed Ceausescu's strictly enforced
policies against abortion and birth control.
   In Playa de Aro, Spain, tourism officials said Thursday they
would sponsor Mediterranean holidays for a group of orphans from
Timisoara, where the Romanian uprising began last month.
   Ricardo Lopez, tourism chief of the seaside town near Barcelona,
told the Europa Press news agency the children would spend April
17-28 in local hotels and homes ``so they could spend a few nice
days after the horrors they lived through.''
   In another development, Yugoslav police reported Thursday that
80 Romanians had illegaly crossed the border into neighboring
Yugoslavia since the start of the Dec. 15 revolt and 208 had
returned since the downfall of Ceausescu's regime.
   Yugoslav authorities quoted in the Tanjug state news agency
denied reports in the Romanian press saying about 60 Romanians who
escaped across the border belonged to the secret police. Those
forces waged last-ditch battles against revolutionary fighters.

   Don Henley's socially conscious
``The End of Innocence'' album was nominated for four plum Grammy
Awards on Thursday and a host of other aging pop music legends
grabbed most of the other key nominations.
   Henley's album earned nominations for album of the year and best
male rock performance. The title track was put in competition for
record and song of the year. The latter is a songwriting nomination
shared with Bruce Hornsby.
   The 32nd annual Grammy Awards will be presented Feb. 21 and
broadcast live on CBS-TV.
   A scattering of newer faces won prime nominations, but many went
to such veterans as Bette Midler, Bonnie Raitt, Tom Petty, Billy
Joel and Linda Ronstadt. Even the Rolling Stones got a nomination,
for group rock performance on their ``Mixed Emotions'' single.
   Miss Midler was caught by surprise when her ``Wind Beneath My
Wings'' single from the movie ``Beaches'' earned record, song and
female pop performance nominations.
   ``To tell you the truth, I haven't been paying a lot of
attention _ I have a lot of things going on, with the baby and
everything else,'' Ms. Midler said by telephone from her home here
as 3-year-old Sophie cried.
   The late Roy Orbison was nominated for pop vocal performance for
the single ``You Got It,'' and twice with pals Petty, George
Harrison, Jeff Lynne and Bob Dylan for their ``Traveling Wilburys''
collaboration.
   The nomination list for male rock performance typified the aging
face of the awards: Henley, Petty, Neil Young, Lou Reed and Joe
Cocker.
   The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences announced
the nominations at a news conference with hosts singer Olivia
Newton-John and producer Quincy Jones. The announcements
experienced delays when a Grammy placard on the podium kept falling
off.
   There were 388 nominees representing 113 record companies.
   Neneh Cherry, Indigo Girls, Milli Vanilli, Soul II Soul and Tone
Loc were nominated as best new artists of 1989.
   The ``Batman'' movie soundtrack produced seven nominations,
including four for rock star Prince. He was listed for producer of
the year, male pop vocal performance, male Rhythm &amp; Blues
performance for the single ``Batdance,'' and for ``Partyman'' as
best song written for a movie.
   The rock band Fine Young Cannibals, featuring the sensuous
vocals of actor Roland Gift, was nominated for best album for ``The
Raw &amp; The Cooked'' and for best record and pop group for the single
``She Drives Me Crazy.''
   Miss Ronstadt's work drew multiple nominations: song of the year
and duo pop performance for ``Don't Know Much,'' and female pop
vocal for the album ``Cry Like a Rainstorm-Howl Like the Wind.''
   Joel's decades-summing single ``We Didn't Start the Fire'' was
tabbed for best record, song and pop male vocalist.
   Petty was nominated for his ``Full Moon Fever'' album and the
single ``Free Fallin''' was given the nod for male rock performance.
   Miss Raitt was nominated for her album ``Nick of Time'' and for
female pop vocalist for the title track and female rock vocal
performance for the album.
   Irish rockers U-2 earned a scattering of nominations, including
rock group performance for the LP ``Rattle and Hum,'' and in the
same category was picked for the single ``When Love Comes to Town''
with B.B. King.
   U-2 and lead singer Bono were also nominated for best song
written for a motion picture for ``Angel of Harlem,'' from the
movie ``Rattle and Hum.''
   Mike and The Mechanics were nominated for best record and song
for the single ``The Living Years'' as well as pop group
performance and short form music video.
   ``The Living Years'' is a personal story about the singer's
relationship with his father. ``I think it's one of those songs
that sort of reaches anybody,'' said Mike Rutherford from his
cottage in the English countryside.
   In the rhythm and blues category, best vocal performance
nominations went to Janet Jackson, Aretha Franklin, Natalie Cole,
Anita Baker and Vanessa Williams.
   Miss Franklin was also nominated twice in the R&amp;B duo
performance category for singles with James Brown and Whitney
Houston.
   Janet Jackson's ``Miss You Much'' also drew a songwriters
nomination. Her ``Rhythm Nation'' track from the album of the same
name was up for an instrumental arrangment Grammy and for best
long-form music video _ pitting her against brother Michael's
``Moonwalker'' video.
   Bobby Brown, Al Jarreau, Luther Vandross and Smokey Robinson
were R&amp;B male vocal nominees.
   In the country category, nominees included k.d. lang, Emmylou
Harris, Rosanne Cash, Dolly Parton, Kathy Mattea, Rodney Crowell,
Randy Travis, Clint Black and Lyle Lovett and the late Keith
Whitley.
   Heavy metal was a new category, drawing nominations for the
groups Dokken, Queensryche, Metallica, Faith No More and
Soundgarden.

<HEAD>Two Years Later, `Irises' is Wilted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sale of Vincent van Gogh's ``Irises'' for a
record $53.9 million two years ago was considered a loud vote of
confidence in an art market still under the cloud of Wall Street's
Black Monday.
   But two years later the world's most expensive painting is
sitting in a vault, and the ``Irises'' deal is looking wilted.
   It turns out that Sotheby's lent Australian tycoon Alan Bond $27
million to buy the 1889 painting; that as collateral Bond posted
the picture he was going to buy; that Bond has not paid off the
loan; that Sotheby's, not Bond, now has the painting; that Bond,
reportedly $5 billion in debt, apparently wants to sell the
painting, or at least his share of it.
   And Sotheby's said Thursday it was abandoning the loan policy
that produced the whole fiasco and, critics complained, inflated
art prices in general.
   In an interview, Michael Ainslie, head of Sotheby's, said buyers
will no longer be allowed to use art objects they intend to
purchase to secure loans from the auction house.
   Since a painting is worth what someone is willing to pay for it,
and since what someone is willing to pay often depends on how much
that someone can borrow, auctioneer's loans have the potential to
stoke the art market.
   An auction house could use such loans to increase bidding and
hike prices _ and the value of its own 10 percent commission. If
the borrower-bidder defaults, notes Time magazine art critic Robert
Hughes, the auctioneer takes back the picture, writes off the loan
and resells the work at its new, possibly inflated, price.
   Since auction houses usually charge several points over the
prime lending rate, some critics have described them as a lender of
last resort. Christie's, Sotheby's rival, does not lend money to
buyers.
   Ainslie said Sotheby's made such loans rarely and carefully, and
that their discontinuation would have no impact on art prices.
   ``It was merely a financial service to our clients,'' he said.
``But our foremost concern is our credibility, so we're making this
change largely to correct the misperception that something was
wrong.''
   Angelo Aponte, the city's Commissioner of Consumer Affairs,
agreed: ``I don't think it's going to reduce prices, but Sotheby's
had to do it to protect its own credibility. That's the biggest
thing an auction house has going for it.''
   Ainslie said Sotheby's had extended such loans only six times on
objects that sold for more than $1 million.
   But one was ``Irises,'' whose sale, according to art dealer
Richard L. Feigen, ``had a real impact on the art market.''
   ``Assume that Bond could not have bid without Sotheby's
financing,'' he said. ``Where would the bidding have stopped?''
   If it stopped short of $40 million, would anyone have paid $47.9
million for ``Yo Picasso'' last May? Would Walter Annenberg have
paid $40.7 million for the same artist's ``Au Lapin Agile'' in
November?
   Ainslie's response: Bond probably would have bought the painting
without the Sotheby's loan. At the time of the sale, he was no
credit risk.
   Ainslie's assessment was supported by Thomas Hoving, former
director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and editor of
Connoisseur magazine, who blamed critics and art dealers for the
controversy.
   Dealers, he said, dislike auction houses for luring away their
business; critics, he said, were trying to make something of
nothing. ``Sotheby's just said, `Let's cut our losses. Who needs
this?''' he said. ``It's a peripheral issue.''
   And what of ``Irises'' _ the painting? Sotheby's took it back
after Bond was forced to extend his loan, but Ainslie wouldn't say
where it is ``because of security considerations.'' It is widely
thought to be in a vault in Switzerland.
   And what is ``Irises'' now worth? About what Bond bid for it in
1987, said Ainslie; $30 million to $40 million, according to
skeptical dealers.
   ``We are having discussions with several parties,'' said Michael
Cross, a Bond associate. ``We have received a great many
approaches, but nothing is conclusive at this stage.''

   Dozens of supporters of Lebanese military leader
Gen. Michel Aoun occupied Lebanon's embassy in France on Thursday
and threatened to remain there for days.
   Ambassador Fouad Turk negotiated with the protesters in hopes he
could peacefully persuade them to leave. He said there had been no
incidents and that he had not asked French police to evict them.
   The demonstrators occupied the chancellory and prevented embassy
staff from entering the building.
   The protesters said they were opposed to an announcement by
Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss to transfer several Lebanese
diplomats in the United States and Europe to other posts.
   Aoun, a Maronite Christian who controls remnants of Lebanon's
army, is opposed to Hoss and President Elias Hrawi, whom he views
as appointees of Syria.
   Syria maintains about 40,000 troops in Lebanon support Moslem
militias opposed to Aoun.

<HEAD>Panama Troop Withdrawal Plans Coming Soon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Thursday he
intends to bring home within weeks the thousands of U.S. troops
sent to Panama to oust former Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, and will
announce withdrawal plans in the next few days.
   ``We are going to be moving fairly rapidly to bring the troops
home over the course of the next several weeks,'' Cheney said,
adding that ``a residual force'' would remain.
   ``I think we'll go back to the level that was there'' prior to
the invasion, he told reporters during a Pentagon briefing.
   Before the Dec. 20 invasion, about 13,000 U.S. troops were
stationed in Panama, and Cheney emphasized that he expects to keep
that number in the country.
   About 7,000 troops were airlifted to Panama on the first day of
the operation, with the total number swelling to around 25,000,
Pentagon officials have said.
   In recent weeks, that number has varied as some troops have
begun to withdraw and other specialized units were rotated into the
country.
   The secretary he and the top military leadership were
``wrestling with'' ideas in order to produce ``the exact time
frame'' for withdrawing the additional forces and that he was
hopeful such details could be released ``within the next day or
two.''
   On Friday, 2,000 paratroopers who took part in Operation Just
Cause are scheduled to make a mass parachute drop on their return
to Fort Bragg, N.C., homebase of the 82nd Airborne Division.
   On another issue, Cheney said that he approved the use of the
F-117 Stealth jet fighter in the Panamanian operation, but that he
objected to initial proposals for extensive use of the super-secret
aircraft.
   ``When the planning was done ... there was more extensive use
proposed for the F-117. I questioned specifically why we wanted to
use that particular system, and why on those particular targets.
They went back to the drawing boards and came back with a
scaled-back plan in terms of the number of targets affected,''
Cheney said.
   Although officials have refused to disclose the exact number of
planes used on the mission, they have said that two planes bombed
the Rio Hato airfield near some infantry barracks in order to
disorient those troops and make the U.S. paratroopers' arrival
easier.
   ``We wanted pinpoint accuracy. We were trying to save lives,
stun and disorient the forces at Rio Hato so our own Rangers could
go in. We used the 117 and it worked. They dropped with pinpoint
accuracy,'' Cheney said.
   The secretary, asked about his plans for base closures, said
that he expected them to be ``extensive,'' but when asked to define
the term, he quipped, ``more than two.''
   Congress has agreed to the closures of 86 bases, and the
secretary was asked whether additional closures were contemplated.
   ``There will ... be additional base closures. But the exact
process in which we will undertake that, I'm not prepared to say,''
Cheney said.
   The secretary's spokesman, Pete Williams, said later Cheney
``has not signed off on the final list'' of bases, and that he
expected ``some base closings'' to be included in the fiscal 1991
budget, due to be sent to Congress later this month.

   Farmers planted nearly 57 million acres of
winter wheat last fall for harvest in 1990, a 3 percent increase
from 1989 and the most in five years, the Agriculture Department
said Thursday.
   The increase, however, was much less than the 6 percent to 8
percent that some analysts had been predicting and raised prospects
of continued tight U.S. supplies and strong prices.
   ``This would be the largest wheat area since the 1985 crop''
when plantings totaled 57.8 million acres, said the department's
Agricultural Statistics board.
   A major concern is that despite the increase in plantings last
fall, crop conditions have been far from ideal so far this winter.
   ``Lack of moisture stressed winter wheat in the central and
southern Great Plains during December,'' the report said. ``In
mid-to-late December, cold weather stressed winter wheat in the
southern Great Plains, Delta and Southeast.''
   Winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the following
year. It accounts for about three-fourths of the total U.S. wheat
output.
   Last year's winter wheat production declined because of
lingering drought in some major production areas, but total wheat
output increased because of a boost in spring-planted areas.
   Meanwhile, U.S. wheat stockpiles have continued to shrink, thus
keeping market prices at high levels.
   To help replenish dwindling reserves, the department is
requiring farmers to idle only 5 percent of their wheat base acres
this year, compared with a 10 percent set-aside in 1989 and 27.5
percent previously.
   In another option intended to boost production, wheat farmers
are permitted to plant up to 10 percent more acreage than otherwise
would be permitted under the 1990 program.
   As originally announced last May 31, farmers were to plant no
more than 95 percent of their wheat land. But the option announced
on Sept. 13 lets them plant up to 105 percent, or 10 percent more
than otherwise would be permitted under the basic program.
   Economist John Schnittker, a Washington-based consultant, said
that larger plantings would have provided a better cushion for
possible yield losses later in the season.
   For example, he said, if plantings had been boosted 6 percent to
8 percent as many had expected, that would have helped offset any
major impact from reduced yields caused by poor growing conditions.
   But with only a 3 percent increase in 1990 plantings, that
cushion is thinner and ``leaves very little margin for reduced
yields,'' Schnittker said in a telephone interview. ``We're at
greater risk than expected.''
   The report showed that wheat farmers in Kansas, traditionally
the biggest producer, kept plantings at last year's level _ 12.4
million acres. Increases were reported in Missouri and Montana,
Oklahoma, South Dakota and Washington.
   But Nebraska farmers reduced winter wheat plantings by 2
percent, and Texas producers cut theirs by 3 percent.
   In a supply-and-demand analysis, officials said the U.S. total
wheat stockpile on June 1, the beginning of the 1990-91 wheat
marketing year, could be reduced to 468 million bushels from 702
million last June 1 and 1.26 billion bushels two years ago.
   However, the new June 1 forecast was up 25 million bushels from
indications in December. No projections were included for 1990-91.
   Export demand has been fed by U.S. price subsidies for a number
of countries, including the Soviet Union and China. Even so, total
wheat exports in 1989-90 are expected to drop to around 1.275
billion bushels, down from 1.419 billion last season.
   Domestic requirements are slightly more than 1 billion bushels
for 1989-90, the report said.
   The analysis said average market prices may average in the range
of $3.80 to $3.90 per bushel over the 12-month marketing year, five
to 10 cents less than the December projection. Wheat prices
averaged $3.72 in 1988-89 and $2.57 in 1987-88.
   Another report showed the Dec. 1 inventory of all U.S. wheat at
1.42 billion bushels, down 17 percent from a year earlier. Farm
holdings at 582 million bushels, were down 6 percent from Dec. 1,
1988, while off-farm stocks at 836 million were down 24 percent.
   The Dec. 1 corn stockpile was estimated at 7.08 billion bushels,
virtually the same as a year earlier. Farm inventories were
reported at 4.7 billion bushels, up 10 percent, while off-farm
holdings dropped 15 percent to 2.38 billion bushels.
   Soybean stocks were reported at 1.61 billion bushels, up 18
percent from a year earlier. Farm inventories, at 793 million
bushels, were up 22 percent, and off-farm stocks rose 14 percent to
817 million.
   A review of 1989 crop production relatively minor adjustments in
USDA's previously announced harvest figures.
   The 1989 wheat crop was reported at 2.04 billion bushels, up 12
percent from 1988; corn, 7.53 billion bushels, up 53 percent;
sorghum, 618 million bushels, up 7 percent; oats, 371 million
bushels, up 72 percent; barley, 403 million bushels, up 39 percent.

<HEAD>Cloud of Fear Caused By Misting Machines In Wake Of Legionnaires'
Outbreak</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Supermarkets around the nation Thursday shut
down mist machines designed to keep fruits and vegetables looking
fresh after one such device was linked to a Legionnaires' disease
outbreak that killed two people.
   ``We made the decision that if anything can happen because of
this type of machine we wouldn't take the chance, we'd discontinue
using them,'' said Mickey Clerc, spokesman for the Jacksonville,
Fla.-based Winn-Dixie Grocery Chain.
   Late last year, about 70 people in Bogalusa, a town in southeast
Louisiana, developed symptoms of Legionnaire's disease. Thirty
cases were confirmed in the laboratory and two of the victims died.
   Researchers announced Tuesday that they had traced the
Legionella bacteria to the one-quart water reservoir of the mist
machine at a Winn-Dixie supermarket, said Dr. Louise McFarland,
state epidemiologist.
   ``That doesn't mean grocers and hospitals should shut down their
misting machines. All we're asking them to do ... is to contact the
manufacturer or us and make sure they are using the machine
properly,'' said Gwen Bach-Stewart, a spokeswomen for the Louisiana
Department of Health and Hospitals.
   Misting vegetables is not the problem, she said.
   ``You can't get Legionnaires' disease from eating vegetables
that have been misted. You have to breath the Legionella bacteria
in to contract the disease. In Bogalusa, the bacteria was airborne
in a very fine mist that could be inhaled,'' said Bach-Stewart.
   Hospitals use a variety of humidifiers and respiratory therapy
machines which produce a fine spray, said Dr. Thomas Farley, a
state epidemiologist. He said precautionary letters were sent to
the hospitals.
   At least four national supermarket chains _ Winn-Dixie, Safeway,
A&amp;P and Kroger _ switched off their vegetable-freshening mist
machines, however.
   ``We have never recommended the removal of the machines,''
Farley said. ``The mist machine in this outbreak was a type that
has a reservoir in it. That is, a place where water was sitting
continuously. The bacteria was found in the reservoir. We feel that
was where it was multiplying.
   ``The other factor was the very fine mist this system produces
which allowed it to be breathed by people in the area,'' Farley
said.
   ``There were probably other factors present that we don't know
about, but we feel that those two things were part of it. Most of
the misters used in stores don't have reservoirs and produce
heavier water drops that can't be breathed,'' he said.
   Winn-Dixie, which operates 1,228 stores in 13 states, began
removing the misting machines from the 97 stores that had them in
November, when state health officials went to check the devices as
a possible source, Clerc said.
   ``We had the same type of service in all our stores. We're not
experts in the area and we saw no reason to take a chance with the
health of our employees or customers,'' Clerc said.
   Clerc said Winn-Dixie in future would spray produce by hand and
will not reinstall the machines.
   Most stores like Safeway, which has 1,200 stores mostly in the
western United States and Canada, were turning off the systems and
cleaning them, said John J. Hayman Jr., president of KES Irrigation
Systems Inc., of Marietta, Ga.
   Hayman supplies misters to about 7,000 U.S. and Canadian
supermarkets. He said his company is the largest of its kind, has
been in business five years, employs 25 people and does $4 million
worth of business annually.
   ``They're telling us that they are shutting them down until the
public is educated to the difference in a `fogger' like the one in
the Louisiana store and a misting system. A misting system, which
is what I manufacture, does not use a reservoir. It draws its water
directly from the city water system and produces a spray, not a
fog,'' Hayman said.
   Cincinnati-based Kroger, the nation's second-largest chain with
more than 1,200 stores in 20 mostly Midwestern and Southern states,
said it has stopped using the sprayers in its produce departments.
   It said most of its stores use automatic spray or mist systems,
but its stores in the Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio, areas use hoses.
   Montvale, N.J.-based A&amp;P, with 1,250 stores in 26 states and
Canada, originally said it would continue using its misters because
they didn't have water reservoirs like the one in Bogalusa.
   A&amp;P spokesman Michael Roarke said Thursday that the company had
decided temporarily to shut down its misters, used in about 200
outlets, because of customer concern.
   In hospitals, concern about Legionnaires' disease prompted
precautions in the use of misting systems years ago, officials said.
   ``We've always been aware of the potential for increased
bacteria growth,'' said Frederick A. Kron, an epidemiologist at
Baptist Southern Hospital. ``We use only sterile water in any
system that produces mist.''
   Legionnaires' disease was first identified in 1976 after an
outbreak at an American Legion convention in Philadelphia killed 34
people. It is caused by bacteria that often thrive in cool,
standing water found in such places as water towers or air
conditioning ducts. The germ usually enters the lungs through water
droplets.

   Strong northwesterly wind blasted across the north-central part
of the nation Thursday, dropping temperatures and kicking up
blizzard conditions.
   The wind, associated with an intense low pressure system over
Lake Superior, ushered in much colder air with afternoon
temperatures 20 to 40 degrees lower than at the same time
Wednesday, when temperatures hit record highs.
   High wind warnings were posted over Iowa, eastern North Dakota,
central and eastern South Dakota, and east-central and northeastern
Nebraska. A gale warning was issued for Lake Huron.
   Wind gusted to 75 mph at Yankton, S.D.; 72 mph at Fort Dodge,
Iowa; 63 mph at Ord, Neb.; 62 mph at Rice Lake, Wis.; 58 mph at
O'Neill, Neb.; and 54 mph at Grand Rapids, Mich., and Moline, Ill.,
the National Weather Service said.
   Snow and blowing snow was prevalent in the upper Mississippi
Valley and the upper Great Lakes region, and blizzard conditions
were reported in northwestern Minnesota during the morning.
   Blowing dust sharply reduced visibility over parts of eastern
North Dakota, eastern South Dakota, western Minnesota and northern
Iowa.
   Elsewhere, rain and snow showers were reported from the upper
Ohio Valley to western New England.
   In the West, a warm front produced showers over the northern
Pacific Coast.
   Thursday's low for the Lower 48 states was 5 degrees at Caribou,
Maine.

   A Justice Department team overseeing the safety of
classified documents for the trial of Manuel Noriega has warned
attorneys they may have to pass a security check and cautioned them
about disclosing classified documents.
   Pressure to maintain secrecy in the case prompted a closed-door
meeting Thursday of he judge, an angry defense attorney and the
security team.
   The indictment issued in February 1988 accused Noriega of
protecting cocaine shipments heading north and coca processing
chemicals and drug money headed south.
   Classified documents figure in the case because the deposed
Panamanian dictator assisted the CIA from the 1970s until 1985.
   ``It is pretty odd that they're both (prosecutors and security
team) from the Department of Justice and yet these people (security
team) claim that they're neutral,'' said Steven Kreisberg, who
represents co-defendant William Saldarriaga, an accused Colombian
cocaine trafficker. ``When they all work in the same department, I
question that.''
   A February 1988 indictment charges Noriega with taking $4.6
million in bribes from Colombian cocaine dealers to turn his nation
into a way station for smugglers.
   Michael O'Kane, attorney for codefendant Daniel Miranda, who is
accused of flying drug money from Florida to Panama, said U.S.
Attorney Dexter Lehtinen was misapplying security guidelines and
contended he was threatened in the name of security.
   Lehtinen spokeswoman Diane Cossin responded: ``Defense counsel
should abide by ethical standards and not try this case in the news
media or comment on any discussions with the U.S. attorney's
office.''
   O'Kane asked the government in a motion Monday to examine
intelligence information collected at a U.S. military
telecommunications listening post dubbed ``The Tunnel'' in Panama
City.
   He attached a map copied from the Panama City telephone book to
specify its location, and that raised security concerns.
   After the filing, O'Kane said he was contacted by a member of
the security team and then by a prosecutor in Lehtinen's office
``who tells me they are very upset in Washington with what I've
been filing and if I don't get on board it will be bad for my
client and bad for me personally.''
   O'Kane met Thursday with U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler
and Justice Department officials to discuss security issues, and
the judge laughed when O'Kane explained the source of the map.
   Another security provision ``is that no classified information
be discussed even over the telephone because of the danger of
interception of these transmissions, by the Russians or whoever,''
said Kreisberg.
   In cases with more than one defendant, attorneys normally share
copies of pleadings, but that procedure may be restricted in this
case, he said.
   ``I would hate to think there's things going on with other
defendants that I don't know about,'' Kreisberg said.
   Noriega's arrival in Miami on Jan. 4 to face the drug indictment
has fueled speculation that co-defendants may pursue plea bargains
to avoid sitting through a barrage of allegations aimed largely at
Noriega.
   ``There's always discussion, you know, but what the government
has offered in my view is nothing,'' said Kreisberg, whose client
faces two counts in the 12-count indictment. ``They offered, `If
you plead guilty to one count, they'll dismiss the other counts.'
I'm not really interested because my client's not guilty.''
   Samuel Burstyn, who represents former Noriega intelligence chief
Luis del Cid, said, ``The thought of going to trial in a joint
trial with Mr. Noriega with the prospects of that being a real
dog-and-pony show are not very appealing to us, so to a certain
extent we are motivated to forego a lengthy and difficult trial.''
   Del Cid faces up to 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine if
convicted of racketeering and drug trafficking charges. Burstyn
called discussions of a possible plea ``very preliminary.''
   Burstyn and Kreisberg are seeking separate trials for their
clients, but no timetable for a decision has been set.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Blocks Special Elections</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Thursday blocked a
plan for nonpartisan special elections of state district judges,
despite a finding that the regularly scheduled elections
discriminate against minority voters.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the Legislature
deserves more time to consider changes in the current, countywide,
at-large election system.
   Last year, U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton of Midland ruled
that the at-large system diluted the strength of black and Hispanic
voters and violated the U.S. Voting Rights Act.
   The lawsuit was filed in 1988 by the League of United Latin
American Citizens and other minority groups.Jose Garcia de Lara,
LULAC's national president, said he didn't believe the Legislature
or the governor could solve the problem in a special session.
   ``We've been waiting a hundred years for this and we're at the
point where we want the changes done immediately,'' de Lara said,
but added, ``We are very optimistic. This is not a point of despair
or devastation (but) we feel we have taken a couple of steps
backward on the issue.''
   Following the appeals court decision, state officials said they
will prepare for regular at-large elections of 115 state district
judges in nine counties.
   ``This (decision) gives the people and their elected
representatives an opportunity for a full and thorough debate on
how judges should be selected,'' said Chief Justice Tom Phillips of
the Texas Supreme Court.
   ``I hope the Legislature will move quickly in the next special
session to give the people an opportunity to implement a system
which is fair to all Texans,'' Phillips added.
   Gov. Bill Clements has called the Legislature into a special
session Feb. 27 to consider judicial selection and public school
finance.
   The appeals court stopped special, nonpartisan elections in May
that had been ordered by Bunton for nine of the state's largest
counties: Bexar, Dallas, Tarrant, Harris, Travis, Midland, Ector,
Lubbock and Jefferson.
   A few hours after the 5th Circuit Court ruled Thursday, Bunton
issued an apparently contradictory order rescheduling the
nonpartisan special elections for November.
   Bunton said he believed the appeals court did not have
jurisdiction in the case until he himself had ruled on a previous
motion by the state.
   However, state officials said they believed the appeals court
decision outweighed Bunton's latest order and the state would
proceed with the regular March 13 primary elections.
   ``Since the 5th Circuit Court has ruled, I would think that
would be the prevailing order at this time,'' said Steve Hall,
spokesman for Attorney General Jim Mattox.
   ``The elections are going to take place, the primaries, as
originally scheduled. The district judges in those nine counties
will be running in the primaries as they normally would have,''
said Secretary of State George Bayoud.
   Praising the appeals court judges, Clements said, ``I applaud
the decision of the 5th Circuit not to allow the wholesale
disruption of our judiciary.''
   In a two-page opinion, the appeals court said that overhauling
the Texas judicial system is a job for the Legislature.
   ``That holding (by Bunton), if sustained on appeal, will require
an organic and wholesale review and reconstitution of the Texas
judicial election system, a task which should be addressed and
carried out by the state's elected representatives, rather than by
the federal courts,'' the ruling said.
   ``Only if it becomes apparent that the state is unwilling to act
with measured and appropriate speed in this regard should the
courts intervene.''
   The appeals judges went on to say that the Legislature, thus
far, hasn't been given ``a reasonable period within which to
address the problem presented.''

<HEAD>Berkeley Programmer Says Worm Hid Itself From Victims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM KATES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ``worm'' program that paralyzed a
nationwide computer network in November 1988 was designed so its
victims wouldn't know how they were being attacked, a computer
expert testified Thursday.
   Robert T. Morris' rogue program used several methods to worm its
way into the Internet network, said Keith Bostic, a program analyst
at the University of California at Berkeley.
   ``It was designed to break into as many computer systems as
quickly as possible and escape detection as it was doing so,''
Bostic said on the second day of testimony in Morris' computer
tampering trial in U.S. District Court.
   Morris, 25, of Arnold, Md., is charged under the 1986 Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act with ``hacking'' into a federal computer
network. If convicted, he faces as many as five years in prison and
a $250,000 fine.
   Prosecutors allege he devised and unleashed a program that
replicated wildly, immobilizing an estimated 6,000 computers linked
to Internet, including those at NASA and several Air Force
installations and universities.
   Defense attorney Thomas Guidoboni has said that Morris created
the worm as a computer security experiment, but that he made a
programming mistake that let the worm go berserk.
   Guidoboni said during opening statements that once Morris
learned of the problems his program was causing, he tried to stop
it, and when that failed, he tried to alert network users.
   But Bostic testified that no one in Berkeley's computer science
research group received any warning about the worm from Morris.
   Four top computer programmers worked 16 hours to crack the
worm's defenses, he said.
   According to Bostic, the worm entered the school's computer
system by using two defects in the software used by the system and
by solving passwords, either through a list built into the worm or
by checking possible guesses against the computer's own internal
dictionary.
   The worm also took advantage of the computers' ``trust'' for one
another on the same system, a process by which a second computer
will allow access to the system after seeing that an account
already has been authorized by another computer on that system,
Bostic said.
   The rogue program hid itself in four ways, he told jurors.
   It traveled via binary code, rather than a more easily read
source code, and those parts of the program that could be read by a
literate user were encrypted to further mask what the worm was
doing, Bostic said.
   Morris' program also was set up so that it provided phony
identification names when Berkeley's scientists were trying to
trace it. The worm created more deception by periodically changing
the program identification number attached to it by the Berkeley
computer system, he testified.
   Bostic said the ``quick and powerful attack'' by the worm left
no computer on the university system untouched.
   ``It would break into as many machines as it could, even
machines it could not run on. It was completely indiscriminate,''
Bostic said.

<HEAD>Latin America's First Reactor Resumes Service After 17 Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atucha 1, Latin America's first
nuclear reactor, was resumed operations this week after 17 months
of repairs, the president of the National Atomic Energy Commission
said Thursday.
   ``This is a great triumph for us,'' Manuel Mondino said in a
telephone interview. ``We worked very hard on this. The task was
unprecedented.''
   In August 1988, a fuel rod in the 340-megawatt reactor ruptured,
shutting down the plant in Zarate, 60 miles northwest of this
capital.
   Mondino said scientists at first didn't know how to fix Atucha
because they had to remove one damaged tube and check 252 others in
a reactor that was not designed to be opened.
   Technicians explored the tubes with miniature TV cameras and
used robotic arms to remove the damaged tube along with bits of
metal before the reactor, which began producing electricity in
1974, could become operational.
   The reactor uses natural uranium, which Argentina has in
abundance, and heavy water; most reactors use enriched uranium and
boiling water. Also, its 5-yard fuel rods are longer than those
used elsewhere.
   Mondino, appointed by President Carlos Menem last July, said he
is convinced that ``what damaged the channel won't happen again.''
   Nevertheless, he said the reactor will operate at 50 percent
capacity for several months.
   The plant is part of a national energy grid that includes
hydroelectric dams, coal- and oil-fired power plants and the
Embalse nuclear plant.

<TEXT>
   A decision by the East German Communist Party
to set up a new internal security force drew a stiff rebuke
Thursday from the State Department.
   ``Non-Communist political groups struggling to organize for the
promised free elections May 6 are understandably concerned that
such a force could be used for political intimidation,'' the
department said in a statement.
   In the past, the hated secret police, popularly known as
``Stasi,'' used repressive measures to help ensure 40 years of
Communist control.
   East German government officials say about 26,000 of the 85,000
state security employees have been taken off the payroll. But
opposition groups want guarantees the force will be disarmed and
assurances former agents will not have a part in a new agency.
   In a speech to the national parliamen, Prime Minister Hans
Modrow, who has U.S. support, said ``the aim is not to maintain the
old structure'' of state security. But, he said, ``there cannot be
a security vacuum.''
   Modrow cited violence by neo-Nazi groups as well as ``terrorism,
drugs and ecological crime.''
   Still, the State Department was sharply critical of the
development.
   It said the East German Communist Party was struggling to prove
its credibility with the East German people.
   ``Re-establishing a police force such as the one which existed
in the past could only put that credbility into further doubt,''
the statement said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III went to Potsdam last month
to meet with Modrow and, separately, with a group of Lutheran
ministers, several of whom had opposed the old regime.
   He signaled his support for Modrow, who is considered by the
State Department a reliable force for moderation in East Germany.
At the same time, though, U.S. officials are concerned about
indications a mood of retribution is prevalent among East Germans
who felt the sting of the ousted regime.
   Political divisions and shortages of food and fuel also
contribute to unease within the Bush administration about Modrow's
chances of maintaining control until the promised elections in May.
   An independent trade union movement threatened on Thursday to
call a nationwide strike Jan. 25 over the security force issue.

   Accused serial killer Arthur J. Shawcross was
charged Thursday with a ninth murder in a string of slayings of
prostitutes and other young women in and around Rochester.
   A Wayne County grand jury charged Shawcross with murder in the
death of 29-year-old Elizabeth A. Gibson of Rochester.
   The body of Gibson, described by authorities as a prostitute,
was found Nov. 27 in a wooded area in Wayne County, just east of
Rochester where most of the killings took place.
   Shawcross, paroled in 1987 after serving 15 years in prison for
the murder of an 8-year-old girl, was charged last week with
slaying eight other women over the past two years in Monroe County,
the county in which Rochester is located. A Monroe grand jury is to
consider evidence in two other slayings next week.
   Shawcross was bought in manacles to the Lyons courthouse from
Rochester for the arraignment in the Wayne County case. He answered
``Yes, sir,'' in a low voice when Judge Carmen Parenti asked if he
needed a lawyer appointed for him.
   Public Defender Ronald Valentine did not enter a plea for
Shawcross, but Parenti entered a plea of innocent on his behalf.
   Parenti granted a prosecution request to deny bail to Shawcross,
and returned him to custody in Rochester, where he is being held
without bail on the Monroe County charges.
   ``I do feel there is a high risk that the defendant would flee
this jurisdiction,'' Parenti said.
   If convicted of the second-degree murder charge, Shawcross faces
a minimum sentence of 15 years to life in prison.
   The 44-year-old parolee was arrested Jan. 4 after state police
spotted him lingering near the frozen body of one of his alleged
victims. Shawcross reportedly confessed to killing 11 women and
told police where to find two bodies.
   He served 15 years in prison after admitting in 1972 that he
raped and strangled of 8-year-old Karen Ann Hill in Watertown. He
also allegedly told police of a second killing, of a 10-year-old
boy.

   A Soviet proposal to mediate stalled
peace talks between Iran and Iraq made headway Thursday when
officials of the two nations expressed support for Moscow's offer.
   A senior Iranian Foreign Ministry official said Iran will look
positively at the Soviet proposal, Iran's official Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi returned to Tehran late
Wednesday after talks in Moscow with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze, the news agency said.
   In Moscow, a Soviet official said Wednesday that Tehran had
agreed to restart the talks with Soviet mediation. The chief of the
United Nations had been leading the talks.
   The Iraqi Foreign Ministry in Baghdad also issued a statement
Thursday welcoming the Soviet role.
   ``The Soviet Union proposed such a meeting last year, and Iraq
informed Moscow it approved the meeting last August,'' said the
statement, carried by the Iraqi news agency monitored in Nicosia.
   ``We welcome such a meeting if it will be comprehensive in order
to achieve it aims,'' it said.
   In Washington, the State Department stressed that the Soviet
proposal was meant ``to supplement the efforts of the U.N.
Secretary General ... not to supplant them.''
   Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler also urged both Iran and Iraq to
immediately exchange the 100,000 prisoners they are holding from
the war years.
   Thursday's statements came a day after Kamal Kharrazi, the
Iranian ambassador to the United Nations, rejected a new Iraqi
proposal to revive the talks. The Iranian said negotiations could
continue only on the basis of an earlier peace plan, Tehran radio
reported.
   Kharrazi said Baghdad's ``proposal is nothing new and does not
change anything. ... It is another stage of Iraqi obstructionism in
the peace process.''
   He added that ``if Iraq does not have any ill intentions in
introducing this proposal, it should accept the U.N. resolution and
take positive steps in its implementation.''
   The eight-year Iran-Iraq war halted on Aug. 20, 1988, after
Tehran accepted U.N. resolution 598. The document calls for troop
withdrawal to prewar borders, exchange of prisoners and
negotiations towards a lasting peace.
   But the negotiations, which started five days after the
cease-fire, have stalled.
   President Saddam Hussein of Iraq last month proposed new direct
talks to revive the talks, exchange of prisoners, opening of air
links and exchange of visits by Iranians and Iraqis.
   Tehran, which opposes direct talks, called the proposal a
``deception'' and said it fell short by failing to call for a troop
withdrawal.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said
Wednesday that Iran had agreed to restart the talks, but that
Moscow _ rather than the U.N. secretary-general _ would mediate.
   In Moscow, Gerasimov said Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of
Iran sent a message to Moscow saying Tehran was willing to resume
the talks with Soviet mediation.
   The Iranian news agency said Thursday that Velayati's message
stressed that Iran would consider any Soviet proposal ``containing
a systematic and clearly defined formula for the implementation of
U.N. resolution 598.''
   Gerasimov said Baghdad already had agreed to talks with Soviet
mediation.

<HEAD>Mail Bomber Reportedly Believed to Be Elderly White Man</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mail bomber responsible for the
deaths of a federal judge and civil rights attorney may have been
an elderly white man who is religious or has legal experience,
according to a reported FBI profile.
   Nancy Conn, a victims' rights advocate in Alabama, quoted
unidentified FBI agents as saying they believe the bombing suspect
is old because he used 3-cent stamps that are no longer sold as
postage on packages, the Birmingham Post-Herald reported Thursday.
   According to the report, the bomber also used an old-fashioned
method to wrap the mail-bomb packages _ brown butcher's paper and
baker's string.
   ``The agent said they believed he must have had those stamps for
a long time,'' said Mrs. Conn, who works in the Alabama attorney
general's Office of Victim's Assistance.
   U.S. Postal Service officials said Thrsday a 3-cent stamp issued
in 1986 is still being sold and was widely used in 1988 as a
supplemental stamp when first-class letters went from 22 cents to
25 cents.
   But an older 3-cent stamp reportedly used by the bomber was the
going rate for first-class letters during two periods, 1917-1919
and 1932-1958, before those 3-cent issues ceased being sold, said
postal service spokesman Art Shealy of Washington, D.C.
   The Birmingham Post-Herald said FBI sources confirmed a profile
of the bomber. However, FBI spokesman Tom Moore refused Thursday to
confirm that the profile was that described by Mrs. Conn.
   Moore refused to confirm Mrs. Conn's account of her interview
with the FBI. ``We didn't say what kind of stamps were on the
packages,'' Moore said.
   The FBI interviewed Mrs. Conn because they believe the bomber
could be a victim of a crime committed by a black or is close to
someone who is a victim.
   ``This person is angry at the justice system and we deal with a
lot of victims who are angry,'' Mrs. Conn said. ``Some are radical
racists. I've heard people make very bad, slanderous remarks.''
   The bomber used the word ``shall'' several times in his letter
and other stilted terminology, leading investigators to believe he
is religious or has knowledge of legal terms, Mrs. Conn said.
   ``Shall'' is used frequently in scripture and legal books.
   Mrs. Conn gave the FBI the name of a crime victim who has called
her office and complained about what he says is a justice system
that discriminates against whites. That man is white and the person
who committed the crime against him is black, she said.
   It was not known if the FBI has interviewed the man.
   Miriam Shehane, who started the group VOCAL (Victims of Crime
and Leniency) with Mrs. Conn, was also interviewed by the FBI. She
could not be reached for comment.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Vance, who served on the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, was killed Dec. 16 when a mail bomb
exploded at his home in Mountain Brook, a Birmingham suburb.
   Two days later, civil rights attorney Robert Robinson, a black
alderman in Savannah, Ga., was killed after a similiar package blew
up in his face.
   Other mail bombs were safely removed from the 11th Circuit
courthouse in Atlanta and the Jacksonville, Fla., office of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   FBI agents from Washington, D.C., have joined investigators from
Birmingham, Atlanta and Jacksonville on the case. ``We are making
steady progress,'' said Moore.
   In a letter to an Atlanta television station, a group called
``Americans For a Competent Federal Judicial System'' claimed
responsibility for the bombings. The letter said the group was
seeking vengeance for court decisions in favor of school
desegregation and the 1988 rape and murder of Julie Love, a native
of Mountain Brook, who was white. Two black men in Atlanta were
charged in the crime.

   A woman implicated in the deaths of her two
baby daughters three years apart is a ``cold-blooded murderer'' who
concocted a ``fairy tale'' about how both infants were abducted, a
prosecutor said Thursday.
   But the defense attorney for Paula Marie Sims, 30, of Alton in
southern Illinois, called his client an innocent victim of a
``terrible tragedy.''
   Mrs. Sims is charged with two counts of first-degree murder in
the death of 6-week-old daughter Heather Lee, whose body was found
in a trash barrel in May. If convicted she faces the death penalty.
   She also faces trial later in Jersey County on charges of
obstruction of justice and concealment of a homicide in the death
of another daughter, Loralei Marie, in June 1986. No one has been
charged with slaying Loralei.
   In his opening statement, Assistant Madison County State's
Attorney Donald Weber said the infants' deaths were not
coincidental.
   He scoffed at statements made by Mrs. Sims and her husband,
Robert, to police that in both cases a masked gunman had entered
their home and kidnapped their child.
   Sims, 37, was at work on both occasions and has not been charged
in either death. He has custody of the couple's young son, Randy.
   Mrs. Sims ``told police a fairy tale about a roving
Rumplestiltskin who showed up on her door step and snatched her
baby,'' Weber said.
   ``The truth is that Paula and Robert Sims just don't like little
girls,'' he added. ``Their impossible and preposterous story can
lead to only one conclusion _ the baby's caretaker, their mother,
is a ruthless and cold-blooded murderer.''
   Defense attorney Donald Groshong countered that there ``is
absolutely no evidence'' to link Mrs. Sims to Heather Lee's murder
and that the real killer is still at large. He said his client was
not smart enough to plan the crime and leave no evidence.
   ``Paula Sims did not kill those children,'' Groshong told the
jury. ``It's a terrible tragedy what happened to those two
children. Paula Sims is a victim, too.
   ``The evidence will show that Paula Sims is a good mother,'' he
said.
   After opening statements, Jeff Reed of Florissant, Mo.,
testified that he discussed children with Mrs. Sims when they
worked together at a grocery store in 1983.
   ``She said, `God no, I don't want to have children. Especially
not a little girl. They are too much trouble,''' Reed said. ``I
thought it was kind of strange.''
   Another witness, Julie Fry of Jerseyville, said she shared a
hospital room with Mrs. Sims in 1986 when Loralei was born.
   ``She woke me up because she was crying,'' Mrs. Fry testified.
``She was on the phone and she said `I'm sorry we had a little
girl.' I thought she was talking to her husband. She said she
wanted a boy _ that they wanted a boy.''
   Mrs. Sims faces two counts of first-degree murder _ to allow
prosecutors to propose different theories in Heather's death _ as
well as two counts of obstructing justice by lying to police and
one count of concealing the homicide.

   The space shuttle Columbia gained
on its quarry Thursday in its orbital pursuit of an 11-ton
satellite that the astronauts hope to capture and save from burning
up in the atmosphere.
   Commander Dan Brandenstein and pilot Jim Wetherbee fired the
shuttle's orbital engines three times Thursday to put the shuttle
on a near-collision course with the satellite they have been
catching up with since liftoff Tuesday.
   As the astronauts ended their workday Thursday afternoon,
Columbia was 218 miles from its target and closing at a speed of
about 24 miles per 91-minute orbit.
   ``Tomorrow's a big day, so get a good night's sleep tonight,''
said Jim Voss, the shuttle communicator at Mission Control.
   ``We had an excellent day and we're looking forward to
tomorrow,'' replied mission specialist Bonnie Dunbar.
   When the shuttle was launched, it entered orbit 1,725 miles
behind its quarry, but it has flown in a lower orbit than LDEF so
it could circle the Earth faster and catch up with the satellite.
   Eight more maneuvers were planned for early Friday before
Brandenstein would assume manual control of the shuttle for the
final approach to the Long Duration Exposure Facility, which is the
size of a small school bus.
   ``The orbiter continues to perform very well, orbiter and
crew,'' flight director Bill Reeves said during a press briefing
late Thursday afternoon. ``Everything is go for the rendezvous
tomorrow.''
   Flight director Al Pennington said Thursday that when the
shuttle is about 400 feet away from LDEF, the crew ``will get a
good look at the sides of it. At that point in time, he
(Brandestein) will have a good visual image of what he's going in
for.''
   Once within range of the target, the plan was for the shuttle to
fly in formation 35 feet from LDEF while Dunbar uses the orbiter's
50-foot robot arm to reach out and grab the satellite, expected at
9:48 a.m. EST Friday.
   After snaring the satellite, she will turn the arm slowly for
four hours so LDEF can be photographed before it is tucked into the
shuttle's cargo bay for the trip home. Mission specialist Marsha
Ivins was in charge of the photography.
   The satellite has been in orbit for nearly six years, but it is
being slowed by atmospheric drag and tugged down by Earth's
gravity. If the astronauts don't retrieve it, it is expected to
plunge to Earth on March 9 and burn up in the atmosphere.
   Scientists hope LDEF is returned intact so they can see what has
happened to its experiments after the long exposure to space.
   Early Thursday, Brandenstein and mission specialist David Low
interrupted their flight plans for about three hours to mop up
about two gallons of water that leaked from a faulty dehumidifier.
The spill was shown on television as a slow bubbling of water beads
floating in the air.
   When Brandenstein looked at all the equipment that had to be
moved to get at the water, he remarked: ``It's kind of a mess right
now. I'll get the plumber of the year award, but not the
housekeeper of the year award.''
   Mission Control awakened the five astronauts Thursday with its
own version of the ``Banana Boat Song.''
   The name of astronaut Low was substituted for the words
``Day-O,'' and it included such phrases as, ``Come all you
astronauts sleeping in the cabin, daylight comes and its time to
get up.''
   Mission Control said the words were written by members of the
team that trained Low for a space walk in case of an emergency on
this flight. To pass the time during these training sessions, he
often hummed the melody.
   ``Good morning, Houston, man. We be up,'' Low replied in a
calypso beat.
   In addition, controllers reported Thursday that the $85 million
Navy communications satellite launched by the astronauts Wednesday
was functioning well.
   Columbia's 10-day mission is the second-longest in the 33
shuttle flights, is a stepping stone toward longer shuttle missions
and to months-long trips aboard space station Freedom starting in
the mid-1990s.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, seeking to ease
friction over stalled peace efforts, on Thursday urged U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III to keep trying to arrange
Israeli-Palestinian talks.
   But the Israeli daily Haaretz reported Shamir and Foreign
Minister Moshe Arens were studying alternatives to the
U.S.-supported plan for Israeli-Palestinian talks in Egypt.
   Haaretz said the two leaders were looking into resuming efforts
toward a direct dialogue with Palestinians from the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip without help from Egypt. Egypt openly consults
with the Palestine Liberation Organization, which Israel considers
a terrorist organization.
   Egypt offered to help arrange preliminary Israeli-Palestinian
talks in Cairo after Israel's earlier efforts at a direct dialogue
failed.
   Israel has hesitated to accept the U.S.-backed plan unless it
has firm assurances from Baker about the composition of the
Palestinian delegation and the agenda.
   Shamir's top aide Yossi Ben-Aharon told Israel Television that
Israel would seek further clarifications after receiving a draft
letter of assurances from Baker.
   ``There is still a difference between what we see as a proper
response and what the Americans gave us,'' TV quoted Ben-Aharon as
saying.
   The delay has led to warnings this week from Baker and other
officials that the United States may abandon its Middle East
efforts.
   Shamir told visiting U.S. congressmen that Israel hoped Baker
would persevere.
   ``Facing us is a difficult and complicated process and, in order
to advance it, we need a lot of patience,'' Shamir said, according
to his office.
   The prime minister also said ``we rely on the efforts of the
United States'' for success in the Israeli peace initiative.
   Israel's plan calls for elections in the occupied lands to
select Palestinians for negotiations on limited autonomy with
Israel.
   The Foreign Ministry said Arens spoke with Baker by telephone
Wednesday and that they discussed ``ways of advancing the peace
process.''
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin left Thursday for the United
States, where he is to meet next week with Baker.
   Also Thursday, Finance Minister Shimon Peres, head of the
center-left Labor Party, criticized Shamir for delays in accepting
the U.S.-backed initiative.
   ``We can start peace talks,'' Peres told a forum of
manufacturers. ``We, in my opinion, are unnecessarily delaying a
decision.''
   In a separate speech, Peres warned his party will leave Israel's
coalition government ``if it will be decided to go against the
peace process or if there will be no peace process.''
   The Labor Party favors striking a compromise with Baker over two
issues that have held up Israeli acceptance of his plan.
   But Shamir, head of the right-wing Likud bloc, wants U.S.
assurances that Palestinians who live outside the occupied
territories will be excluded. Likud holds that involving outsiders
is tantamount to negotiating with the PLO.
   Shamir also wants the Americans to limit the discussion in Cairo
to Israel's election plan.
   In the occupied territories, Israeli soldiers shot and wounded
14 Palestinians during stone-throwing clashes Thursday, Arab
hospital officials reported. The army confirmed one wounded.
   In Hebron, masked Palestinian activists stabbed and injured
Jamila Ramadan, a 32-year-old principal of a girls' school. Arab
reporters and Israel radio said she was suspected of assisting
Israeli authorities and committing ``moral offenses.''
   Palestinians have killed at least 168 of their Arab brethren as
suspected collaborators with Israel during the 25-month-old
uprising against Israeli rule. Since the uprising began, 646
Palestinians have died of Israeli gunfire in the uprising, and 43
Israelis have been slain.

   German shepherds that used to guard
the Berlin Wall will be put up for adoption in West Germany, the
national Animal Protection Union said Thursday.
   The organization said East German authorities have promised to
reveal the 150 locations where the dogs are held this weekend, and
will start turning them over free of charge to West German animal
protection societies at the end of January.
   The West German union said the accord was reached in talks with
East German defense ministry and trade officials in East Berlin on
Thursday.
   The union said it had offered to find ``responsible'' West
Germans owners for any of the so-called ``wall dogs'' that fail to
find homes in East Germany.
   The objective was to ensure the dogs are not ``put to sleep or
acquired by souvenir hunters as a live memento of the wall,'' a
union statement said.
   The organization did not say how many ``wall dogs'' there are.
   The wall was heavily guarded until Communist authorities opened
East Germany's western border on Nov. 9.

   Charles Stuart tried to draw two brothers into his
plot to kill his pregnant wife, but other family members did not
know of Stuart's involvement until days before he committed
suicide, an attorney said Thursday.
   Family attorney Richard Clayman revealed that Michael Stuart had
been approached by Charles ``weeks before'' the Oct. 23 crime, but
did not realize the significance of the overture and refused to get
involved in ``any crazy thing.''
   Three days after the shooting, another brother, Matthew, who
disposed of a pistol suspected to be the murder weapon and other
evidence, told Michael of Charles' role in the crime. The brothers
did not share their knowledge with the rest of the family until
shortly before Charles Stuart's Jan. 4 suicide.
   Charles Stuart told police after the shooting that he and his
wife, Carol, 30, were attacked by a mugger as they left a birthing
class at a city hospital. Stuart was seriously wounded but
recovered. Their son, born premature by Caesarean section, died 17
days later.
   Charles Stuart, 30, became a suspect in the case Jan. 3 when
Matthew implicated him in his wife's killing. He jumped off a
bridge into Boston Harbor before police could arrest him.
   Clayman held a news conference Thursday and was joined by
Michael and a third brother, Mark Stuart, and their two sisters,
Shelley Yandoli and Neysa Porter. Matthew Stuart did not attend.
None of the siblings made any comment during the session.
   ``The appearance that has evolved in my judgment is that some
type of conspiratorial scenario existed by and between all of these
family members sitting around talking about keeping something
hidden. That is not true,'' said Clayman, who represents Michael
Stuart but spoke on behalf of the family.
   Clayman was asked if Charles Stuart ever asked Michael for
assistance in killing his wife.
   ``There may have been an early, disjointed, vague conversation
by and between Charles Stuart and my client, Michael Stuart, weeks
before Oct. 23 ... which at that time had no significance to
Mike,'' Clayman said.
   ``In retrospect, after examining all the data there, an argument
can be made ... that it had some significance,'' he said.
   Clayman, who declined to elaborate on the discussion, said
Michael Stuart's response was, ``a definitive `I don't know exactly
what you're talking about, but I'm not getting involved in any
crazy thing you're talking about.'''
   Of the other family members, he said: ``They knew nothing, they
did nothing, they saw nothing, they touched nothing.''
   Clayman said Matthew had told Michael of Charles' involvement
within three days of the crime.
   He said his client would tell the grand jury anything it wants
to know. ``I am comfortable that there is no violation of law ...
that his hands are legally clean.''
   A grand jury is to convene Friday and hear testimony on the case.
   Asked about the moral dilemma Michael Stuart faced, Clayman told
reporters they had all the relevant facts to ``come to a moral
judgment yourself.''
   Matthew's attorney, John Perenyi, was in conference and not
available for comment, his office said Thursday afternoon.
   Clayman also said the Stuart family wanted people to know ``they
loved Carol Stuart'' and that their family and her parents, Eveylyn
and Giusto DiMaiti, had suffered greatly.
   ``The agony they have experienced over the last week ... has
been horrible,'' he said.
   According to Matthew Stuart's attorney, Matthew met Charles at
the crime scene and retrieved Mrs. Stuart's handbag, which
contained personal items and a gun. Matthew Stuart, who has said he
did not realize any shooting had occurred when he took the items,
told his lawyer he had shared his suspicions about his brother with
family and friends.
   Matthew Stuart said he threw the handbag and gun into the the
Pines River in suburban Revere. Police divers recovered the handbag
and a snub-nosed .38-caliber revolver believed used in the killing.
   Divers searched the Pines River again Thursday for further clues.
   The search continues for a gold watch and a ruby ring _ among
items that Stuart reportedly said were stolen when he and his wife
were shot.
   Prosecutors have refused to say whether anyone might be charged
in the crime, saying the investigation is continuing.
   As investigators search for a motive, they have dismissed
reports that drug use was involved. And interest in Stuart's
connection with a 22-year-old woman who worked at a Boston fur
store with him has diminished.
   In a statement released by her attorney Thursday, the woman
said: ``I was never romantically involved with Charles Stuart.''
   She said she knew him as a friend and ``felt nothing but
sympathy for Mr. Stuart'' after his wife's death. She said Stuart
had asked her to call and visit him in the hospital.
   ``I told him that I felt it was inappropriate for me to visit
because this was a time for family, but I agreed to telephone
him,'' she said.
   One emerging theory is that Stuart wanted to leave the fur
store, where he was a manager, and open his own restaurant, but he
felt his wife and a baby would be a hindrance. Mrs. Stuart, an
attorney, reportedly knew of the restaurant plans, and literature
on starting a restaurant was found in the couple's Reading home.
   Authorities have investigated whether Stuart might have plotted
the killing to collect on insurance policies on his wife. He
received $82,000 from one policy due his wife from her job as a tax
attorney. He had taken out at least one other policy on her, for
$100,000, that was being processed when he committed suicide.

   A British tanker rescued all 19 people from a
Bermuda cargo ship drifting in heavy seas and high winds Thursday
in the mid-Atlantic, the Royal Air Force said.
   The 7,000-ton Irving Forest, carrying wood pulp in containers on
its deck, sent out a Mayday signal when it developed ballast
problems, began to list heavily and lost engine power, the RAF and
Falmouth Coast Guard said.
   An RAF Nimrod jet from Kinloss, Scotland, and a U.S. Air Force
Orion stationed in the Azores Islands responded to the call for
assistance, an RAF spokesman said.
   The Nimrod dropped dinghies at the scene, 300 miles north of the
Azores and 1,000 miles southwest of England. The tanker Nestor,
bound for New York, approached to try to take the 18 men and one
woman crew on board.
   The Nestor picked up two men and the woman, but it was about two
hours before the remainder were found and taken aboard, the Coast
Guard said.
   ``We were concerned for some time that the other crew members
might be in the water. There was some doubt about whether they had
made it into the rafts,'' said Peter Baker of the Falmouth Coast
Guard in southwest England.
   The Nestor had all the crew _ Britons, Filipinos and Canadians _
safely aboard and was headed for New York, the RAF spokesman said.
   The Irving Forest, registered in Bermuda and owned by Kent Lines
Ltd., based at Hamilton, Bermuda, was left adrift.

   Three lawyers from a personal-injury firm were
indicted Thursday on federal racketeering charges for allegedly
fabricating evidence and paying for false testimony.
   The 23-count indictment charges that lawyers and several other
employees of the Morris J. Eisen law firm engaged in a pattern of
mail fraud, bribery of witnesses and court workers, and
falsification of evidence since 1981.
   In one instance, a man who testified as an eyewitness in two
separate car-accident cases in 1984 saw neither of them and was in
prison on forgery charges when one of the accidents happened, said
Andrew J. Maloney, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New
York.
   ``I haven't seen the extent of this kind of shenanigans by
lawyers in my career,'' said Maloney.
   The Eisen firm until recently was one of the largest
personal-injury firms in the nation. In 1986, the firm grossed some
$20 million in contingency fees and employed more than 40 lawyers,
Maloney said.
   The indictment names Morris J. Eisen, 58; Joseph P. Napoli, 48;
and Harold M. Fishman, 50. Four private investigators and the
firm's former office manager were also charged.
   If convicted, the defendants could face up to 20 years in prison
and fines of as much as double the proceeds of each criminal
activity on each count, Maloney said.
   James La Rossa, the attorney for Eisen, called the indictment a
vendetta and said it was false and unfair.
   ``Eisen is a thorn in the side of the insurance companies out to
protect their profits and a medical bureaucracy seeking to avoid
the awesome responsibility for ruined and broken lives,'' La Rossa
said. ``Let there be no mistake about what this indictment is, a
clear and brazen effort to cripple the advocates of the men, women
and children who have been crippled and maimed.''
   The ivestigation involved 19 personal-injury lawsuits, seven
against the city. The awards in those lawsuits amount to as much as
$9 million and the firm's contingency fees were about one-third of
that amount, authorities said.

   Flood waters receded Thursday in parts of the
Northwest, and thousands of people began returning home to contend
with the damage caused by rain-swollen rivers.
   Three people were killed in Washington state and millions of
dollars of property damage occurred when rivers ran over their
banks after four days of heavy rains. The rains slackened Wednesday
and flood warnings remained Thursday on just three rivers: the
Chehalis, White and Snohomish.
   Oregon also sustained millions of dollars in damage and weather
contributed to the deaths of three people. Residents along the
northern Oregon coast were cleaning up damage from high winds and
heavy rains.
   Rain was forecast for Thursday night, but not as heavy as the
earlier storms, the National Weather Service said. However,
officials warned that high tides along the Washington coast could
exacerbate flooding at Grays Harbor and on the lower Chehalis.
   The Chehalis had the worst flooding, along with a tributary, the
Skookumchuck, flooding scores of homes and much of the business
district in Centralia, 80 miles south of Seattle. An estimated
3,000 of Lewis County's 57,000 residents were forced to leave their
homes.
   High water also closed Interstate 5 at Chehalis, 4 miles to the
south, Wednesday morning. State officials said the water was
receding on the freeway, but the main route between Portland, Ore.,
and Seattle remained closed.
   The Chehalis' flood surge Thursday soaked the small towns of
Oakville and Porter, about 20 miles southwest of Olympia and was
expected to reach Aberdeen and Grays Harbor on the Pacific coast
Friday.
   Kate Heimbach, Washington's emergency management director, said
losses easily will be several million dollars in each county.
   Oregon Gov. Neil Goldschmidt planned to tour his state's
northern coast Friday. He declared a state of emergency in the two
affected counties Tuesday.
   Many of the 37 evacuees in Oregon's Clatsop and Tillamook
counties began heading home Thursday.
   Two men drowned in separate accidents in the Centralia area,
authorities said, while a third man drowned in Fife, east of Tacoma.
   In Oregon, two people were killed in separate weather-related
car accidents and an 11-year-old girl was killed by a falling tree.

   A fugitive who failed to appear for his 1987
sentencing for a $1.3 million tax-shelter fraud case in Los Angeles
was arrested by police in Switzerland, the U.S. Marshals Service
said Thursday.
   Gerald L. Rogers, 54, was arrested by police in Zurich, said
spokesman Bill Dempsey.
   Rogers, who had been previously spotted in Britain, Portugual
and France, had been a fugitive since July 1987, Dempsey said. The
investigation produced sightings of Rogers aboard his 101-foot
yacht named ``Laissez-Faire'' and worth $2 million, Dempsey said.
   Rogers, who jumped $500,000 bond, was to be sentenced in federal
court in Los Angeles for mail fraud and causing the filing of false
tax returns in connection with the tax-shelter scheme, Dempsey said.
   He faced 101 years imprisonment for bilking investors out of
$1.3 million in the scheme, Dempsey said.
   Rogers also faces racketeering, conspiracy, securities fraud and
mail fraud charges in Denver stemming from a tax-shelter scheme
involving gold mines in Colorado, Dempsey said.

   The Bush administration found itself arguing
against a politically appealing tax cut Thursday as it denounced a
proposed rollback of Social Security payroll taxes as a Democratic
ploy to ``fiddle around'' with the nation's retirement system.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the
administration opposes a plan by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y., to repeal this year's Social Security tax hike and to
further cut the rate next Jan. 1.
   ``Mr. Moynihan's got a lot of ideas, and we'll let the Democrats
have those ideas,'' Fitzwater said.
   Bush's ``no-new-taxes'' philosophy does not apply to the Social
Security tax increases, which were scheduled to take place anyway,
administration officials said.
   Moynihan's plan, which is fast gaining support from business and
conservative groups, would cancel the Jan. 1 increase that raised
the Social Security tax rate to 7.65 percent from 7.51 percent. The
tax covers both retirement and Medicare programs.
   Moynihan's proposal would then lower the rate even further, to
6.55 percent, on Jan. 1, 1991.
   ``We don't anticipate any changes in Social Security. Democrats
seem to want to fiddle around with the Social Security system; we
do not,'' Fitzwater said.
   Moynihan aide Ed Lopez, who said Bush seems to be putting
himself at dds with many conservatives, asked: ``So the president
doesn't like our tax cut?''
   ``We expected it would have bipartisan support. But it's a bit
surprising the extent to which the right wing has climbed all over
it,'' Lopez said.
   He said Moynihan, who has called the legislation a ``$55 billion
tax cut for working people,'' planned to introduce the rollback
measure on Jan. 23, the day Congress returns from its winter recess.
   Kay O'Beirne, deputy director of the conservative Heritage
Foundation, said the administration is finding itself ``in a
position of opposing a tax break that Americans deserve.''
   ``That will be a problem for them,'' she said, suggesting
widespread support for the proposed tax cut might force the
administration into a position of having to ``argue that Americans
aren't overtaxed.''
   The Heritage Foundation, which usually finds itself on opposite
sides from Moynihan, put out an analysis of the legislation on
Thursday entitled ``Three Cheers for Moynihan's $55 Billion Tax
Cut.''
   ``It hasn't happened too often in the past. But here he is,
championing a proposal we've been advocating for years,'' said Ms.
O'Beirne. ``We welcome his leadership.''
   The increases in Social Security taxes were enacted in 1983
under a formula for shoring up the system produced by a blue-ribbon
commission headed by Alan Greenspan to overhaul the social security
financing.
   Greenspan was a private economist at the time. He is now
chairman of the Federal Reserve. Moynihan, who is chairman of the
Senate Finance subcommittee on Social Security, was a member of the
Greenspan commission.
   ``The Social Security system is sound. Let the Democrats fool
with it, not us,'' Fitzwater said. He said the administration
favored keeping the ``commitment to America'' he said was made by
the Greenspan commission.
   ``We're not changing Social Security,'' he added.
   However, White House staff chief John Sununu said on ``Face the
Nation'' last Sunday that the administration did plan to propose a
change to Social Security financing that would require surpluses
generated by the Social Security trust funds to be used to help
retire the national debt after 1993.
   Currently, the trust funds are invested in Treasury securities.
   The surplus in the trust funds is currently about $65 billion,
and since these funds are figured in the federal budget, they tend
to mask the real extent of the federal budget deficit.
   However, Fitzwater said that these changes dealt mostly with
bookkeeping methods. ``I don't know about the budget stuff. I just
know we aren't changing Social Security.''
   Social Security taxes jumped almost $320 this year for Americans
earning $51,300 or more, in part because the wage limit on which
the tax is levied was raised from $48,000. At $48,000 and below,
the increase is 0.14 percent of wages _ $67 for someone earning
$48,000; $42 for someone earning $30,000, $28 for someone earning
$20,000, and so forth.
   Don Levins, director of federal budget policy for the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, said the Moynihan proposal, which would cut
the tax rate paid by both employees and employers, was ``a positive
first step'' toward strengthening the Social Security system.
   ``How can you go against such a good idea? It's a populist idea.
And it will do a lot of good for economic growth,'' Levins said.
   He said that, while the chamber had some concerns about paying
for such a tax cut, the administration and ``Republicans in
general'' would be ``missing a golden opportunity'' by not backing
such a payroll tax rollback.
   Bush addresses a Chamber of Commerce audience on Friday in
Cincinnati, but aides said it was unlikely he would have much to
say about Social Security financing.

<TEXT>
   Authorities said Thursday night a daylong
search found no trace of a police plane carrying five people,
including two Americans from the Food and Drug Administration, that
disappeared on a domestic flight.
   Search officials said 21 aircraft scoured a 500-mile-long
stretch of terrain north of Santiago, spending much of their time
over the Atacama Desert, one of the driest sites on Earth.
   Land patrols were also sent out.
   Col. Luis Godoy, head of the national police aviation branch,
said the air search was suspended after 8:30 p.m. but will resume
at daylight Friday.
   Police said the twin-engine Cessna 206 disappeared Wednesday
after taking off at 5:10 p.m. from Copiapo for the four-hour flight
south to Santiago.
   Godoy said, ``The search centers near Copiapo, because the last
radio contact with the missing plane occurred only 15 minutes after
it left that city. But we are covering the entire route it was
scheduled to follow.''
   Authorities said no sign of sabotage emerged, and no guerrillas
are believed to operate in the region, which is in a 125-mile
section of land sandwiched between the Pacific and the Andes
mountains.
   The Americans aboard were identified as John Harty Jr., of
Silver Spring, Md., and Patrick Pouzar of Nashville, Tenn., FDA
officials who arrived in Chile last Saturday to investigate Chilean
security measures in harvesting, packing and transport of Chilean
fruit to be exported to the United States.
   They had gone to Copiapo to visit the area's vineyards.
   The Chileans on the plane were Oscar Badilla, a government
agricultural official; Sergio Lazcano, an excecutive of the Chilean
Fruit Exporters Association, and the pilot, Police Lt. German
Fuentes.
   American and Chilean authorities agreed on such security checks
after two Chilean grapes laced with cyanide were found in
Philadelphia, prompting a temporary suspension of the sale of all
Chilean fruits in the United States. No victims were reported.
   Weather conditions in the area Thursday were described as
``excellent all day long,'' by a police officer helping to
coordinate the search operation. He identified himself only as Lt.
Carreno.
   Godoy said the Cessna carried a device that ``would send a
strong radio alarm signal in case of a crash, but we have not
monitored such a signal so far.''
   In Washington, FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit identified Harty as
director of the agency's international affairs staff in the FDA's
Office of Health Affairs in Rockville, Md., and Pouzar as director
of investigations in the FDA's Nashville district office.
   Nesbit said the two visited fruit-processing facilities in
northern Chile. They were expected home Monday, said Bill Oates,
acting director of the Nashville office.
   Nesbit said the foreign minister informed the U.S. Embassy in
Santiago late Wednesday that the plane was overdue.

<HEAD>French Aid Agency Says Shortages Plague Cambodia Relief Efforts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shortages of water and medical supplies continue to
hamper relief missions to wartorn regions of Cambodia, the French
aid agency Doctors Without Borders said Thursday.
   Fighting between rebels and government troops has left
``numerous'' casualties in the western provinces and near the
capital Phnom Penh, the organization said in a statement based on
reports from its medical teams inside Cambodia.
   A surgeon, anesthetist and logistics expert have been helping
treat the wounded at an emergency hospital at Kompong Thom in
central Cambodia since Dec. 15, the agency said.
   Their work has been slowed by primitive medical conditions and
shortages of water, drugs, medical equipment and personnel, the
statement said. Most of the wounded suffered injuries from bullets,
rockets and mines, the agency said.
   Medecins Sans Frontieres, or Doctors Without Borders, hopes to
dispatch fresh teams, especially to Kompong Cham in the east, the
statement said.
   Rebels opposed to the Vietnamese-supported regime of President
Hun Sen have stepped up their guerrilla campaign against the
government since Vietnam said it had withdrawn its troops last fall.
   The rebels include the 40,000-strong Khmer Rouge, who killed
hundreds of thousands of Cambodians during the Pol Pot reign of
terror from April 1975 to December 1978, when a Vietnamese invasion
drove them from power.
   Two smaller rebels groups loyal to former ruler Prince Norodom
Sihanouk and Son Sann, a former prime minister, are allied with the
Khmer Rouge to topple Hun Sen, whom they view as a Vietnamese
puppet.
   Most of the fighting has taken place in the western provinces
near the border with Thailand. The rebels receive support from
refugee camps along the border.
   The agency said its teams have also witnessed troubles in
Kompong Cham and Kompong Thom as well as Kompong Speu, 31 miles
southwest of the capital.
   The statement came as the Khmer Rouge claimed Thursday to have
smashed strategic government positions after shelling the country's
second-largest city in Battambang on Jan. 5 and 6 and ``liberated''
38 villages and four communes in western Cambodia.
   The report could not be verified and previous claims by the
Communist rebels have proved to be exaggerated.
   The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council are
scheduled to meet Monday and Tuesday in Paris to follow up last
summer's international conference on Cambodia, which adjourned
without reaching agreement on a peace plan.
   Australia has proposed replacing the government with a United
Nations interim administration until free elections can be held.
   The plan would require backing from all five permanent members
of the security council _ the United States, Soviet Union, Britain,
France and China.

<HEAD>First Multiparty Elections in April</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUSAN STOJANOVIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia's ruling Communist Party
is preparing to give up its monopoly on power and allow the first
multiparty elections in 45 years in April, a leading Communist said
Thursday.
   Stefan Korosec, secretary of the policy-setting Central
Committee, told a news conference that the Communist Party will
take part in the legislative elections in Yugoslavia's six
republics ``just as another party (would) with its new program.''
   Elections in the republics, which delegate deputies to the
national legislature, are scheduled for April.
   The new program, which Korosec said ``departs from the model of
authoritarian'' Communism, still has to be adopted at an
extraordinary Communist Party congress scheduled to start Jan. 20
in Belgrade, he said.
   The document appears to be Yugoslavia's reply to the wave of
democratic reforms currently sweeping Eastern Europe.
   Yugoslavia had a multiparty system before World War II, but the
Western-style democracy was abolished when the Communists came to
power in 1945.
   Korosec also presented to reporters a final draft of a
declaration to be approved by the congress in which the party
pledges to relinquish its monopoly on power. It also calls for
``free, direct and secret'' multiparty elections.
   The draft declaration also says that Yugoslav Communists
``advocate full participation (of Yugoslavia) in European
integration processes (including) its Membership in the European
Community, the Council of Europe, the European Free Trade
Association (EFTA) and other similar organizations and
institutions.''
   Korosec said leaders in all of Yugoslavia's divergent Communist
republics support the declaration ``in principle.'' However, he
also indicated the document could spark fierce debate between
hardliners and more liberal communists.
   Yugoslav Communists were the first to break with the monolithic
Soviet-led Communist bloc in 1948, but Yugoslavia, faced with its
worst economic and political crisis ever, has been slower in
adopting the Western-style reforms that have gripped other East
European countries.
   ``The declaration represents the real divorce of the party from
the state and the constitution of the party as a non-monopolistic
organization,'' Korosec said.
   He did not elaborate on what if any legal guarantees would be
taken that the party was giving up its leading role. In Hungary,
Czechoslovakia and East Germany, articles in the constitution
guaranteeing the leading role of the party have been scrapped. In
Bulgaria, similar steps have been promised.
   Yugoslavia is currently reworking the Constitution and if the
document is adopted in its current form at next week's congress, it
is likely that the Constitutional reference to the party's leading
role will be scrapped.
   Korosec said he thinks ``the Communists cannot lose next April's
elections'' but if they do, they might form a coalition with other
leftist parties such as the Socialist Alliance, which is now a
communist-led mass organization but plans to constitute itself as
an independent party.
   Even though Yugoslavia has not formally adopted a law allowing
independent political groups and parties to form, numerous
political parties have sprung up all over the country over the past
few months.
   Some of the parties have clear nationalist programs that has
sparked fears this could lead to open clashes between the republics
that could seriously threaten the unity of this Balkan country.

<HEAD>State Agency: Immigration Reform Led to Widespread Discrimination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1986 federal immigration amnesty law led
to widespread discrimination against hundreds of thousands of
U.S.-born and foreign-looking persons seeking work, a state report
concluded.
   The state Fair Employment and Housing Commission report released
Thursday also accuses the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service of enforcing the law poorly, the Los Angeles Times reported.
   ``I predicted that would happen,'' said Rep. Edward Roybal
(D-Los Angeles), who voted against the law, ``but no one at the
time seemed to pay attention.''
   The seven-member commission said the law, which orders that
those hiring undocumented workers be prosecuted, led many employers
to turn away job applicants even though many had proof of U.S.
residency, the report said.
   It also recommended the INS suspend enforcement of employer
sanctions, which include fines up to $10,000 for those who
knowingly hire undocumented aliens.
   The non-binding recommendations are the first by a public agency
in the western United States on the controversial 1986 Immigration
Reform and Control Act, under which more than 3 million immigrants
applied for amnesty. More than half of those immigrants live in
California.
   A New York state agency issued a similar report in late 1988.
   The report comes as the General Accounting Office, Congress'
investigative arm, is preparing a final report on the law's effects.
   If the GAO agrees discrimination has occurred, the act requires
Congress to consider changes.
   The state commission oversees enforcement of California laws
prohibiting housing and employment discrimination.
   INS officials defended their performance, pointing out the
agency spent millions of dollars and thousands of hours to educate
employers how the new laws affected.
   ``The INS has done an excellent job of implementing this law,''
agency spokesman Virginia Kice said. ``I don't think anyone can
classify employer sanctions or IRCA as a failure.''
   The commission's findings were based on testimony delivered at
public hearings last year in Oakland, Fresno and Los Angeles.

   The military junta on Thursday dissolved
the feared secret police of President Augusto Pinochet, which has
been accused of widespread human rights abuses.
   Adm. Jose Merino, president of the junta, said it passed a law
under which agents of the clandestine police force will be sent
back to the armed forces branches from which they were assigned.
   The junta is made up of the commanders of the navy, air force
and national police and a reprsentative of the army appointed by
Gen. Pinochet, president and army commander. It acts as legislature
for his 16-year-old administration.
   The text of Thursday's law dissolving the secret police,
formally called National Information Central, was not made public.
   Merino said secret police files ``will remain in the hands of
the same people who have them now.''
   Rights groups have asked that the files be given to the Supreme
Court, saying the documents may be essential if the truth is to be
discovered in cases of serious rights violations in recent years.
   Secret police directors all have been army generals. Most of the
force's officers came from the armed forces. A recent report by an
opposition magazine reckoned the number of agents at 8,000 military
men and 4,000 civilians. The goverment gives no figure.
   The agency was created in 1977 to replace another secret police
force, the National Intelligence Directorate, after that force was
linked to the assassination of prominent dissidents abroad. Among
the deaths was that of former Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier in
Washington in 1976.
   The 74-year-old Pinochet, who seized power in a violent coup in
1973, will hand over the presidency on March 11 to an elected
civilian successor, Patricio Aylwin. But Pinochet says he will
remain as commander of the 60,000-member army, as permitted by the
1980 constitution crafted by his military regime.

<HEAD>Volcano Erupts; Ash Suspected But Not Confirmed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Redoubt Volcano rumbled through another
eruption Thursday, ejecting a plume that rose more than five miles
into the sky, the Alaska Volcano Observatory said.
   There was no confirmation of ash in the plume, but it probably
contained some, observatory geologist Steve Brantley said.
   Wind reports indicated any ash carried from the volcano area
would miss Anchorage, Brantley said, and no ash was expected to
reach the Kenai Peninsula, hit by gritty fallout after Redoubt
rocked through an eruption Monday.
   Monday's blowup was the volcano's biggest since it emerged from
a quarter-century of slumber in mid-December.
   Redoubt, 115 miles southwest of Anchorage, was cloaked in clouds
Thursday.
   Brantley said scientists had virtually no warning of the
eruption, which occurred at about 2 p.m. ADT.
   ``Since the volcano became active, some of the larger explosive
events have been preceded by a systematic increase in the number of
earthquakes.'' The lack of warning is tied to destruction of
Redoubt's lava dome on Jan. 2, he said.
   ``We don't have the capability of predicting when these events
will occur or how large they will be,'' Brantley said.
   He said scientists are equipped to gauge the strength of
eruptions and transmit information to the Federal Aviation
Administration and other agencies.
   The FAA alerted pilots that volcanic ash was possible in the
Redoubt area Thursday. Ash can shut down jet engines, as it did
last month when a Boeing 747 operated by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines
flew through fallout from Redoubt. The plane lost power to all four
engines and landed in Anchorage after they were restarted.
   Brantley said the volcano also went through a small explosion
Thursday morning. ``After these two events, the volcano seems to be
relatively quiet,'' he said.

<HEAD>`Our Gang' Actor Robert Winckler Dead at 62</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert Winckler, an entertainment lawyer
whose Hollywood career began as a child actor on the ``Our Gang''
film comedies, has died of stomach cancer, his son said. He was 62.
   Winckler died Dec. 28 at his home in Woodland Hills, the Los
Angeles Daily News reported Thursday.
   Winckler's acting career began at age 9 at Hal Roach Studios,
after Charlie Chaplin's former wife, Mildred, provided him with a
letter of introduction.
   By the late 1930s, he had appeared as the bully in at least
eight Little Rascals features. He also was cast in numerous films,
appearing in ``Boys Town,'' ``Knute Rockne _ All American,'' ``Blue
Montana Skies,'' and ``Stagecoach.''
   Winckler graduated from the Southwestern University School of
Law in 1953, and subsequently represented stars such as George
``Spanky'' McFarland and Billy Barty.
   Recently, Winckler had been representing Adam West, the former
television star of ``Batman,'' in a lawsuit against several
advertising agencies over the alleged imitation of West's Batman in
a television commercial.
   West is seeking $900,000 in damages over a commercial for Zayre
Stores. The case was taken over by other attorneys and will go to
trial Monday, said Winckler's son, Bill Winckler.
   In addition to his son, Winckler is survived by his wife of 27
years, Betty, and daughter Patricia Winckler, all of Woodland Hills.

<TEXT>
   Cuba has told the Havana correspondent for
Radio Prague to leave, accusing him of ``distorting the reality of
Cuba,'' the official Cuban news agency said Thursday.
   Prensa Latina said Czech reporter Michal Cermak was told of the
decision by the International Press Center early Thursday. The
dispatch, monitored in Mexico City, did not say when Cermak was to
leave Havana.
   The head of the press center, Hector Argiles, told Prensa Latina
that Cermak was asked to leave after a broadcast ``about current
conditions'' in Cuba.
   The Prensa Latina dispatch did not elaborate on the offending
broadcast but said Argiles compared it to reports in the ``Western
media that constantly try to damage the prestige of the Cuban
Revolution.''
   ``Foreign journalists here can count on complete support and
facilities to carry out their professional missions, but those who
deliberately distort the reality of Cuba can't stay in the
country,'' Argiles said, according to Prensa Latina.
   With the crumbling of communism in Eastern European nations like
Czechoslovakia, Cuban President Fidel Castro is becoming more and
more isolated as one of the last of the hard-liners.

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev told
independence-seeking Lithuanians Thursday that a faceoff with
Moscow could lead to tragedy, but he also said a law is being
prepared that would permit the republic to secede from the Soviet
Union.
   It was not clear from the Soviet president's comments how free
Lithuania would be under the framework he envisions.
   About 300,000 Lithuanians jammed central Vilnius late Thursday
in a candlelight demonstration for freedom at the conclusion of the
first day of Gorbachev's three-day visit.
   ``We have been tied together for these 50 years, whether we like
it or not,'' Gorbachev told a crowd after placing a wreath at a
monument to Vladimir Lenin.
   But he also told a meeting of Lithuanian intellectuals that ``I
am for self-determination all the way to secession,'' according to
Lithuanian TV correspondent Eduardas Potesinskas.
   Lithuanians say they want to restore the independence they had
between the world wars. Soviet dictator Josef Stalin absorbed
Lithuania along with the two other Baltic states, Latvia and
Estonia, in 1940 under a secret agreement with Nazi Germany.
   Lithuania, the southernmost of the Baltics, is about 600 miles
west of Moscow.
   Gorbachev reiterated his opposition to the independence drive,
which he has said could cause a breakup of the Soviet Union, but
said he would not stand in the way of the Lithuanian people's will.
   He said he had ordered that a law be written and published
establishing a mechanism for secession from the Soviet Union, a
right guaranteed by the country's 1977 Constitution but not
recognized to date.
   He did not spell out how the machinery for secession worked.
   In an interview with Britain's Independent Television News,
Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov confirmed
Moscow was preparing the law.
   ``You must think about the interests of the other party too, so
there must be mechanism for divorce, so to say,'' the spokesman
said from Vilnius, Lithuania's capital.
   The ITN reporter asked if the draft law meant a law of total
independence.
   ``We have an article in the Constitution. According to this
article, every republic has the right to secession, to go away. The
right is there,'' he said.
   Although he has granted Lithuanians and their neighbors in
Latvia and Estonia a large measure of economic and political power,
Gorbachev has consistently and sharply criticized Lithuanian
Communist Party leaders for pressing for complete independence.
   He convened an emergency session of the national party's Central
Committee last month to discuss the issue.
   By going to Vilnius, Gorbachev put his personal prestige on the
line as never before in nearly five years in power, appearing in a
republic that openly disagrees with him and is unlikely to be moved
by his appeals.
   Gorbachev is in Lithuania to try to reverse the Lithuanian
party's break with the national party, decided in December.
   Gorbachev waded into a crowd of several hundred people after the
visit to the Lenin monument, and he talked for nearly an hour.
   One man called out: ``People must decide their own fate!''
   ``Nothing will be decided without you,'' Gorbachev replied. ``We
will decide everything together.''
   However, he added the following warning: ``Remember, if someone
succeeds in pitting us against each other in a clash, there will be
a tragedy. We should not allow this.''
   Gorbachev was not explicit about what such a tragedy might be,
but one of his closest allies, fellow Politburo member Alexander N.
Yakovlev, was quoted Monday as saying the Lithuanian party's move
might cause a ``domino effect,'' encouraging Communists in the
other 14 republics to break from Moscow.
   Soviet officials have given a virtual guarantee they will not
use force to keep Lithuania and its 3.7 million residents in the
Soviet Union. Gerasimov told the BBC last week the Kremlin has
``only one tool'' for preventing a breakup.
   ``It is dialogue, dialogue and dialogue,'' said Gerasimov. ``The
only way is political means. We have no other choice.''
   Gorbachev also spoke of possible national repercussions when he
told the Vilnius crowd the rights of all minorities in the Soviet
Union must be respected or the nation of more than 100 ethnic
groups may unravel.
   ``If even the slightest suppression occurs, or misunderstanding,
somewhere in Estonia or Moldavia, it spills over into the rest of
the country,'' he said.
   As Gorbachev met with Communist Party members in another part of
Vilnius, an estimated 300,000 pro-independence demonstrators
rallied in the shadow of a cathedral once closed by atheist Soviet
authorities.
   The strains of violins and patriotic hymns filled the air along
with the smell of burning candles carried by demonstrators. The
crowd hushed briefly in commemoration for the tens of thousands of
Lithuanians who suffered in the Soviet takeover, then again broke
out in song.
   ``We've come here to express our unity, in light of the East
European changes, to announce that we will decide the problems of
Lithuania ourselves,'' Vytautas Landsbergis, head of the
grass-roots political movement Sajudis, told the crowd.
   Landsbergis, who is also a member of the Soviet Congress of
People's Deputies, spoke of the Soviet Union like a foreign country.
   ``What was stolen must be returned,'' he told the rally. ``The
time has come for intergovernmental negotiations between Lithuania
and the Soviet Union.''
   The square was a mass of color at the twilight rally, with the
red, yellow and green of hundreds of flags of a free Lithuania
joined by flags symbolizing independent Estonia, Latvia, Georgia,
Armenia, Moldavia and the Ukraine.
   It was a reminder that Moscow faces calls for independence not
just from Lithuania but the other non-Russian republics as well.
   There were signs of local defiance toward centralized Soviet
rule elsewhere Thursday. In Armenia, the legislature amended the
republic's Constitution to give itself an effective veto over
national laws it sees as conflicting with Armenia's interests, said
Yerevan activist Rafael Popoyan.
   In Latvia, lawmakers followed the lead of their Lithuanian
colleagues and amended the Constitution to create a multiparty
system, the evening TV news program ``Vremya'' reported. The
amendments end the Communist Party's constitutional guarantee on
political power and allow Latvians to form rival parties ``that do
not advocate overthrowing the existing state system or other
anti-constitutional goals,'' according to ``Vremya.''
   Gorbachev is also pressing for creation of a Soviet
``federation'' whose constituent republics would have more rights.
He blames many of the country's ills on the strongly centralized
Moscow-based bureaucracy.

<HEAD>300 Shining Path Guerrillas Attack Army Jungle Patrol in Peru</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with rebel raid on army patrol,
details. No pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TARAPOTO, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 300 Shining Path guerrillas attacked
an army patrol in their jungle camp in the coca-rich Upper Huallaga
Valley, killing at least six soldiers, police said Thursday.
   The 14 other soldiers in the patrol were missing, and police
think they fled into the jungle when their ammunition ran out. Army
helicopters failed to find them.
   In Lima, the capital, police said earlier Thursday that from
witness' descriptions, they identified one of the guerrillas
involved in the assassination of former Defense Minister Enrique
Lopez as Gregorio Olivos, a former university student with
purported links to the Shining Path.
   Lopez, the most prominent figure to be killed in 10 years of
guerrilla violence in Peru, was attacked in his car on Tuesday by
at least three men with sub-machine guns as he arrived at his
office in the Lima suburb of San Isidro.
   Another rebel group, the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru Revolutionary
Movement, claimed responsibility Thursday, but a government
spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the claim
``looks pretty thin. The attack ... has the Shining Path written
all over it.''
   On Wednesday evening, according to a police report, rebels
attacked the army patrol's camp in New San Martin area, 110 miles
south of Tarapoto.
   The battle lasted until Thursday morning, when the soldiers
apparently ran out of ammunition and the survivors fled, police
said.
   An army helicopter recovered the soldiers' bodies Thursday but
found no survivors. Nor did other helicopters dispatched to the
attack site.
   Police in Tarapoto, 435 miles north of Lima, told The Associated
Press that peasants living nearby informed them that the guerrillas
came to the area a few days before.
   The attackers had automatic weapons, grenades and dynamite. They
took the weapons and uniforms of the dead soldiers.
   The Upper Huallaga Valley is the source of most of Peru's coca.
The Shining Path operates there in an alliance with drug
traffickers, allowing them to do business with peasant coca-growers
in exchange for part of their profits.
   The traffickers buy coca leaves, make them into paste and ship
the paste in small planes north to Colombia, where it is refined
into cocaine.
   The government says more than 17,500 people have died in
political violence since the Mao-inspired Shining Path launched its
armed insurgency in 1980.
   A congressional commission said in Lima it will meet Friday to
hear testimony from the ministers of interior and defense on why
bodyguards were not accompanying Lopez when he was killed.
   President Alan Garcia criticized the military on the day of the
shooting for not providing full-time protection for the retired
general.
   An article published Thursday in the newspaper Cambio,
considered an outlet of the Tupac Amaru movement, said Lopez was
shot by their guerrillas in response to the government's ``politics
of annihilation (and) extrajudicial executions of guerrillas and
civilians.''
   Police say it was the Shining Path.
   They continued stopping cars and checking people's documents
Thursday in a search for suspects. A government spokesman said more
than 15,000 people without identification had been detained since
Tuesday, but most were released after proving their identity.

<TEXT>
   A woman believed to be the first prostitute
in the United States to be charged with attempted manslaughter in
an AIDS-related case has died.
   Elizabeth Kaye Sherouse, 26, died Tuesday at her mother's home,
said Mitch Gazil, cremation director of Beacon Cremation Service of
Central Florida. The exact cause of death was not available.
   The state spent more than a year trying to send her to prison on
dozens of charges, including attempted manslaughter for planning to
have sex with two clients while knowing she carried the fatal virus.
   The two men used condoms and have tested negative for the virus.
   Last June, circuit judge Michael Cycmanick in Orlando said her
infection with AIDS was ample punishment for breaking the law as a
prostitute. She could have been sentenced to up to four years and
120 days in prison.
   ``There is no question that punishment in this case is what you
have sustained and are enduring because of your conduct,''
Cycmanick told the 88-pound woman, already feeble from AIDS-related
infections.
   He sentenced her to four years' probation on six remaining
misdemeanor prostitution charges. Ms. Sherouse, a cocaine addict
with a seventh-grade education, had spent most of her time since
then at home with her mother.
   ``Thank you, Jesus,'' Ms. Sherouse said after the judge's
decision.
   Her doctor had preregistered her with the medical examiner,
indicating that those close to her expected several days before her
death Tuesday that she would die, Gazil said.
   Family members declined comment.

<HEAD>Hackers Charged with Selling Computer Codes to Soviets on Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CELLE, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three West Germans ``hackers'' went
on trial Thursday charged with selling Western military computer
passwords and codes to the Soviets.
   Dirk Brzesinski, Peter Carl and Markus Hess were arrested last
March after an investigation by U.S. and West German officials
revealed they had obtained information giving them access to key
military and research computers in the United States, Western
Europe and Japan.
   A fourth man, 30-year-old Karl Koch, who was also arrested in
the case, committed suicide in May.
   Brzesinski, 30, a computer specialist, told the court that Koch
had come up with the idea of selling the information.
   ``We decided in 1986 to sell the information to the Soviets for
1 million marks ($605,000) to help them even out the technical
know-how advantage of the West,'' Brzesinski said.
   Carl, 35, said he was responsible for contacting the Soviet
trade mission in East Berlin, where he dealt with a contact
identified only as ``Serge.''
   Carl said he did not want to reveal anything more about the
Soviets in court for fear of reprisals.
   Court records show Carl made at least 25 contacts with the
Soviets and received a total of 90,000 marks ($54,500) for the
information.
   According to Brzesinski, Koch before his death claimed he had
managed to gain access to the U.S. Defense Department general
databank known as Optimus.
   After the arrests last year, U.S. and West German news media
reported that other computers the hackers entered included a NASA
and a ``Star Wars'' research computer, as well as computers linked
to nuclear weapons and energy research in Los Alamos, N.M., and the
Fermi Laboratory in Illinois.
   However, U.S. officials said last year that although the hackers
obtained sensitive codes and passwords to enter the computers, they
were stopped short of obtaining any highly classified information.
   Investigators have said that codes and passwords from computers
in Japan, Britain, France, Italy, Switzerland and West Germany were
also obtained and sold to the Soviets.
   A verdict in the trial, scheduled to be completed in 12
sessions, is expected Feb. 8. The men face up to 15 years in prison
each if convicted.

   The Foreign Ministry on Thursday warned travel
agents planning tourist packages to India to be on guard against
possible terrorist attacks against French citizens.
   The warning comes a day after an Air India jumbo jet bound from
Paris to New Delhi made an unscheduled stop in Karachi, Pakistan,
after a bomb threat. No bomb was found and the 284 passengers
continued their journey safely.
   The Foreign Ministry warning was relayed to the National Union
of Tourist Agents by the Tourism Ministry. It follows a threat
telephoned Monday to the French news agency Agence France-Presse in
New Delhi.
   The caller threatened to kill French citizens in India and
elsewhere unless France frees Anis Naccache, a Lebanese Moslem
convicted of trying to assassinate Iran's former prime minister,
Shahpour Bakhtiar, in Paris in 1980. Naccache began a hunger strike
Sept. 8 and his lawyer says he could die any time.
   The caller claimed to represent Shiite Moslems in Kashmir, where
Islamic militants are conducting a violent campaign for secession
from predominantly Hindu India. He said he represented a group
called Harakat Jihad-e-Islami, or the Islamic Holy War Organization.
   The French Embassy in New Delhi asked Indian authorities to take
extra measures to protect French nationals in the country.

   The U.N. Secretariat has discontinued
informal contacts with nationalist leaders of the three Soviet
Baltic republics but U.N. officials said Thursday no pressure came
from the Soviet Union.
   Francois Giuliani, spokesman for the secretary-general, said in
a briefing Thursday the contacts were strictly ``informational''
between the nationalist groups of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and
Assistant Secretary-General James O.C. Jonah.
   He said they went on for several months and were initiated by
the groups. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar had not been
a party and had not been informed until recently, he added.
   In answer to a question, Giuliani said Soviet officials had not
sought to intervene or block contacts.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev currently is visiting
Lithuania trying to diffuse separatist sentiment there.
   U.N. officials said Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir
Petrovsky contacted Jonah's office about the discussions, but
lodged no protest with the secretary-general.
   The Soviet Mission's press officer was not available for
comment, although a message was left with his office by telephone.
   The U.N. Charter bars the world organization from interfering in
members' domestic affairs.
   Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, once independent, were forcibly
annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 and never have acquiesced to
Soviet domination. Baltic nationalism has been fanned by democratic
upheavals in Eastern Europe and by policies of openness and reform
under Gorbachev.
   The Soviet Constitution provides the right of secession to its
republics but Gorbachev opposes any breakup of the Soviet Union.
   Baltic groups in New York expressed regret over the U.N.
decision.
   ``We are sorry to see that these informal, informational
contacts have been discontinued because of Soviet sensitivity,''
said Ginte Damusis of the Lithuanian Information Center.
   ``It is scandalous to see the United Nations officials running
scared of Moscow.''

   Fifty-five drug defendants refusing to plead
guilty in District of Columbia courts were retaliated against by
prosecutors who moved the cases into federal court, said a judge
who dismissed the indictment against one of them Thursday.
   The federal court cases carried stiffer penalties.
   In dismissing an indictment against Vernon Holland of
Washington, U.S. District Judge Harold Greene said the defendant
had been deprived of his rights to due process of law and to a
speedy trial.
   Holland was charged in the federal court with possession with
intent to distribute crack cocaine after he refused to plead to a
lesser crime, attempted possession of cocaine, in a local court
where he might have escaped a jail sentence. The federal charge
carries a five-year minimum prison term on conviction.
   Holland's was one of 55 drug cases the U.S. attorney's office
moved from D.C. Superior Court to U.S. District Court, where the
defendants were indicted by federal grand juries.
   The transfers, prosecutors said, followed an April 1989
initiative against violent crime and drug abuse in the District of
Columbia announced by Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and federal
anti-drug czar William Bennett.
   The U.S. attorney's office in the District of Columbia is unique
in the country in prosecuting crime in both the federal and the
local courts.
   Greene served as chief judge of the Superior Court for seven
years before being elevated to the federal bench by President
Carter in 1978.
   In two days of hearings last week before Greene, prosecutors
denied that the defendants' refusal to plead guilty played any role
in the transfers. But Greene concluded that the case files of the
transfers proved otherwise.
   ``In case after case, the particular defendant whose case was
transferred had declined to plead guilty in Superior Court prior to
his indictment in this Court,'' said the judge. ``Indeed, in
several instances, the relationship between the refusal to enter a
guilty plea and indictment in federal court was explicitly spelled
out.''
   ``It is the Court's conclusion that, like a number of the other
defendants, Holland has been deprived of his rights under the Due
Process Clause and under the Speedy Trial Act, and the charges
against him will therefore be dismissed,'' said Greene.
   In a typical transfer case, said the judge, a decision was made
in May or June of 1989 to seek an indictment in federal court, even
though an indictment for the same conduct was pending in Superior
Court. Despite the decision to transfer, the new federal indictment
was deliberately not obtained until the fall of 1989. That was
``just about the time the Superior Court case was called for trial
and could no longer be postponed,'' said Greene.
   The U.S. attorney's office said the transfers were made solely
on the basis of the provable facts in each case.
   The status of the other 54 cases could not immediately be
determined.

   More than 25 reporters and editors who resigned
from The Jerusalem Post because of a dispute with the publisher are
trying to put together financing for a new English-language daily,
a spokesman said Thursday.
   ``We are engaged in intensive efforts to set up an alternative
English-language daily that would be what we consider to be the old
Jerusalem Post,'' said Menachem Shalev, a former Post diplomatic
correspondent.
   ``We are in touch with both foreign and Israeli investors but
haven't concluded anything yet,'' he added.
   He declined to say who the potential investors are and said
``millions of dollars'' would be needed for the venture.
   The 58-year-old newspaper, which began in pre-state Israel as
The Palestine Post, has extensively covered the Palestinian
uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and is widely
read by journalists and diplomats here and abroad.
   On Wednesday, the staff remaining at the Post announced they
were dropping a labor dispute after publisher Yehuda Levy pledged
to protect jurnalistic freedom and not impose a political slant.
   Problems began after Levy, a career army officer, was appointed
president and publisher last July by the Canadian newspaper chain
Hollinger Inc., which purchased controlling interest in the Post in
April.
   The paper announced Tuesday that Hollinger Inc. had purchased
the remaining shares, giving it ``complete control.''
   The staff charged that Levy was interfering in the editorial
freedom of the paper and said they feared he would steer its
traditional liberal policy to the extreme right.
   In a letter that led to settlement of the labor dispute, Levy
pledged that ``The Jerusalem Post will be a free and independent
newspaper and will not reflect a single political orthodox
position.''
   He also promised ``a continuing effort to give the readers
accurate news reporting and a wide spectrum of opinion and
commentary'' and said ``the editor and sub-editors will not be
instructed to slant articles politically.''
   Levy said he had asked six of the reporters and editors who
submitted resignations to withdraw them. It was unclear if any will
do so.
   Shalev said some journalists who quit have been approached by
other Israeli newspapers. But he said the group's first choice was
to start a new paper. ``We hope to provide an alternative,'' he
said. ``Frankly, we don't believe in Levy's promises.''

   About 150 people packed a school's music
room Thursday night to try to cope with their grief and bafflement
over the slayings of a family of five here, reportedly as a cult
sacrifice.
   ``In the last day and a half, I've seen a real positive shift,
increasingly toward acceptance and moving on,'' said the Rev. Dale
Luffman, pastor of the church where the victims once worshiped.
   ``We have become more sensitive to how our fellow community
members feel, more sensitive to value people more than things,''
Luffman said at the Kirtland High School forum organized by the
clergy and community mental health leaders.
   Kay Plona, the mother of a classmate of one of the victims, said
she attended the two-hour session to try to understand the tragedy.
   ``People are really defensive. Kirtland is a tighly knit
community,'' said Mrs. Plona, whose son attended kindergarten with
Karen Avery, who was 7 when she was killed.
   Mrs. Plona said her 8-year-old son was having trouble handling
the death of his former classmate. ``I remember the night he came
home. He showed me Karen's picture in the yearbook and then he
slammed it shut and said he didn't want to open it again.''
   Last week authorities, acting on a tip, dug up the bodies of
Dennis Avery, 49; his wife, Cheryl, 42; and their daughters, Trina,
15; Rebecca, 13; and Karen.
   A service in remembrance of the Averys was held Wednesday night
at the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in
Kirtland. The Averys, who moved to Kirtland about three years ago
from the Independence, Mo. area, attended services here a few
times, said Luffman, church pastor.
   Later, however, they joined a Kirtland cult led by a former lay
preacher with the Reorganized Church. Thirteen members of the cult,
including the leader, Jeffrey Lundgren, 39, have been charged with
crimes including aggravated murder, kidnapping, and conspiracy in
the shootings.
   Lake County Prosecutor Steven C. LaTourette has said the Averys
may have been killed as a sacrifice that would cleanse cult
members' souls and allow them to travel to the wilderness.
   Others have suggested that the slayings may have been prompted
by disputes over money or sex, or fear that the Averys would leave
the sect.

<TEXT>
   The Milky Way Galaxy, home of the sun and the
Earth, has a core shaped like a football instead of the perfectly
spherical center many astronomers have long believed, according to
a new study.
   Astronomers at the University of Maryland and Princeton
University announced Thursday the discovery of evidence that the
spiral arms of the Milky Way actually rotate around an oval center,
causing the sun to follow an elliptical path in its 200
million-year orbit of the galaxy center.
   Leo Blitz of the University of Maryland said that the discovery
shows that the Milky Way is a so-called barred spiral galaxy. This
means that the spiral arms, composed of stars, gas and other
matter, flare out from a so-called bar structure of stars and gas
at the center. In a normal spiral galaxy, the arms curve out like
spokes from the very center.
   ``It has been something of a holy grail for astronomers to
determine if the Milky Way is a barred spiral or a normal spiral
galaxy,'' said Blitz. ``This study shows it is barred.''
   The Milky Way galaxy is disk-shaped with a large bulge in the
middle. Seen from above, arms flare out like curved spokes,
creating a spiral appearance. The galaxy has a diameter of about
100,000 light years and a thickness, seen from the edge, of about
4,000 light years.
   A light year is the distance light will travel in a year, about
6 trillion miles.
   In other galactic news, two other astronomers said Thursday they
have confirmed that the Milky Way and about 100 other galaxies are
being pulled toward a powerful gravitational source called ``the
great attractor'' over a region of space 100 million light years
wide.
   The new findings, expanding on preliminary 1987 observations,
show galaxies on both sides of the ``attractor'' are swerving
toward it in addition to their normal motion away from each other,
said Alan Dressler of the Carnegia Instititon of Washington and
Sandra Faber of the University of California at Santa Cruz.
   The sun and its solar system, which includes the Earth, are
located in one spoke, about midway out from the galaxy center. That
spoke, along with the four other arms of the Milky Way, rotate
about the galaxy core. Though the rotation rate of the arm at the
sun's location is about 600,000 miles an hour, the galaxy is so
large that it takes about 200 million years to complete one
rotation, or orbit.
   Because the sun is away from the middle of the galaxy _ about
25,000 light years from the center _ the galaxy is seen edge-on
from the Earth. This means that stars, clouds and dust obscures the
view of most of the Milky Way. And this has blocked astronomers
from being able to determine the shape of the galaxy center
directly.
   Blitz and David Spergel of Princeton overcame this problem by
examining the movement of hydrogen gas clouds in the outer regions
of the Milky Way, an area called the galactic halo that surrounds
the Milky Way like a globe.
   Spergel said the hydrogen movement was first studied about 15
years ago, but the motions were never well understood. He said the
new study, developed with the help of a computer, showed that
movement of the clouds, caused by gravitational influences, could
be explained only if there is an ellipsoidal center to the galaxy.
   ``The center is like a football,'' said Blitz. ``There is
absolutely no question about the data on this.''
   Since, according to the study, the sun and its solar system move
about the galaxy in an ellipse instead of a circle, the sun's
distance from the galactic center will change regularly over time.
Right now, Blitz and Spergel said the sun is about halfway between
its closest approach to the center and the farthest point of its
orbit.
   The sun will reach its outermost point from the galactic center
in 25 million years. That is about 1,500 light years farther away
than the point of closest approach to the center.
   ``It's not something we have to worry about,'' said Blitz.
   A paper on the study was given Thursday at the 175th national
meeting of the American Astronomical Society.

<TEXT>
   A leading transplant surgeon said Thursday
he might be forced to implant a Jarvik artificial heart if the need
arose, despite the FDA's decision to withdraw approval of the
device.
   Jack Copeland, head of the transplant and artificial heart
program at the University of Arizona, said there is no scientific
basis for the decision earlier this week by the Food and Drug
Administration to withdraw approval.
   The Jarvik heart, named after its inventor, Dr. Robert Jarvik of
Utah, gained household recognition after it was implanted in Barney
Clark on Dec. 2, 1982. He lived 112 days, his new heart tethered to
a bulky external power system, before he succumbed to multiple
organ failure.
   Jarvik, in a statement issued in New York, referred to the
Jarvik-7 as ``the Sputnik of medical science in artificial heart
development'' and said he ``was disappointed to see this chapter
close.''
   He said he had ``favored continued research'' but added that he
has been working to develop the Jarvik 2000, an egg-sized miniature
rotary blood pump to be permanently implanted within a patient's
natural heart.
   The FDA notified Symbion Inc. of Tempe, the only company that
has manufactured the Jarvik device, that it was withdrawing
approval for human use of the artificial heart, both as a permanent
implant and as a temporary bridge to transplantation, and of its
acute ventricular assist device.
   The FDA said that during two inspections of the Tempe,
Ariz.-based company last year, it had found ``some serious
deficiencies'' in manufacturing quality control, monitoring of
research sites, servicing of equipment, training of personnel and
reporting of adverse patient reactions to the FDA.
   Copeland acknowledged that ``the heyday of the Jarvik-7 has
passed.'' But he said it still has specific use, and he thinks the
immediate effect of the withdrawal of the Symbion devices will be
``to deprive potentially hundreds of critically ill patients of a
chance for life.''
   Copeland said the FDA action means that for now, his staff faces
the option either of not implanting a Symbion artificial heart in a
critically ill patient as a bridge to transplant, ``or what would
appear to be taking a decision that is not approved by the FDA and
putting a device in anyway.
   ``And I think our decision right now would be to go ahead and
use the devices,'' he said. ``We're confident, we have good data,
good statistics, we're happy with the way the devices have worked,
we think they can save lives.''
   Copeland stirred controversy once before, using a different
artificial heart without approval to keep a patient alive for 11
hours while he awaited a transplant.
   Dr. William C. DeVries of Louisville, Ky., who implanted the
heart in Clark and three other permanent recipients, all of whom
have died, said he had not yet been notified by Symbion or the FDA.
He said he would not comment until he had received official notice
of the recall.
   In Jasper, Ind., Margaret Schroeder, the widow of artificial
heart recipient William Schroeder, said the heart gave her husband
another 620 days of life that he otherwise wouldn't have had.
   ``I'm sure that he would have even died the next day, when he
got the heart on the 25th of November, if they hadn't got him on
that Jarvik heart,'' she said in a telephone interview. ``And at
that time, I think that's the only thing that was available.''
   Copeland said he would be willing to testify before the FDA to
defend the efficacy of the Jarvik and other devices.
   He said the Jarvik-7 is the best device available for people
weighing more than 180 pounds with double-sided heart failure. The
greater loss, he said, is the Symbion biventricular pumps.
   Copeland's team has implanted Jarvik-7s in seven patients,
including two in Bernadette Chayrez, with six going on to
transplant and four of them surviving. Five patients received left
ventricular assist devices and nine biventricular devices, with
four, who went on to transplant, surviving, he said.
   In all, there have been 159 bridge-to-transplants with Jarvik-7
hearts since 1985 and 116 biventricular implants since 1986, said
Lane Castleton, chief financial officer for Symbion.

   Drink for drink, women get drunker than men. Now
scientists believe they know why: Men have more stomach for booze.
   A study published today found that men typically make higher
amounts of a substance that breaks down alcohol in the stomach
before it reaches the bloodstream. As a result, men feel fewer
effects of alcohol, even when men and women the same size drink the
same amount.
   ``I am convinced that there are sex differences in handling
alcohol,'' commented Dr. Judith Gavaler of the University of
Pittsburgh. ``This is a very important study for all of us doing
research in alcohol. This will change the way we approach this
subject.''
   Researchers said the study also underscores concerns about
drinking during pregnancy, provides an explanation on the effects
of drinking on an empty stomach and could be used to help set safe
drinking levels for men and women.

   China's announced lifting of martial law is
receiving muted praise from the Bush administration, while members
of Congress express doubt that Beijing is about to improve its
record on human rights.
   Moving cautiously, U.S. officials said Wednesday that they would
reserve judgment until the announcement by Premier Li Peng was
implemented. More upbeat, Vice President Dan Quayle called the
announcement ``a positive step forward for human rights.''
   But the White House and State Department reflected a cautious
U.S. policy stance by issuing identical statements saying ``we must
assess the full scope of this action after observing its
implementation.''
   The Bush administration dropped its opposition to World Bank
loans to China for earthquakes and other unspecified calamities,
but officials said the step was not related to the lifting of
sanctions and that the United States would continue to oppose loans
to China for projects.

   Neighbors and strangers jammed a memorial
service for a family of five who authorities say were shot and
buried under a barn by a religious cult, possibly as a sacrifice.
   As about 250 people filled the small brick church Wednesday
night to pay respects to the Avery family, authorities in Southern
California said they arrested the last two members of the cult,
ending a nationwide manhunt for 13 people accused in the slayings.
   Law officers stopped a pickup truck about 60 miles northeast of
San Diego and arrested Daniel David Kraft and Kathryn Johnson, said
agent James Stathes of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms in California.
   In Kirtland, five pink candles burned at the Reorganized Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for 49-year-old Dennis Avery;
his wife, Cheryl, 42; and their three daughters: Trina, 15;
Rebecca, 13; and Karen, 7.

   Astronomers at the U.S. Naval Observatory
are narrowing their solar system search for a 10th planet, a
mysterious, phantom giant that has long captured the speculation
and interest of stargazers.
   Speculation about the existence of another planet evolved
because something, perhaps a massive object orbiting the sun on the
outer edge of the solar system, is giving a gravitational nudge
that disrupts the predicted orbits of Uranus and Neptune, said
astronomer R.S. Harrington.
   ``We are still incapable of predicting the location of Uranus,''
Harrington said Wednesday. ``It's clear something is wrong in the
outer solar system.''
   Astronomers have theorized since the beginning of the century
that some additional planets existed beyond the orbits of Neptune.
The theory sprang from observations that Uranus failed to orbit the
sun with the majestic and mathematical symmetry experts expected.

<HEAD>School's Out for Graffiti Students in Sweden</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVA JANZON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City authorities didn't call on the
police to take care of Stockholm's graffiti problem. They sent
teen-age graffiti artists to school where they lived out their
aggression, believed to be the underlying reason people spray a
wall.
   Not only was there a sharp decline in graffiti, said teacher Lee
Spangberg, but a lot of artistic talent was found among those who
had been merely defacing walls.
   Money ran out and the school has closed. But social workers
involved in the project believe it was a good example of the way
social offenders should be handled _ with guidance and
rehabilitation, not punishment.
   Spangberg, 18, admits to having scrawled on some walls before he
became a teacher at the school when it opened last March. He has a
business card that says, ``You Say It, I'll Spray It.''
   The project was set up in an empty high school in central
Stockholm.
   ``As soon as we opened up, everybody knew about it,'' Spangberg
said. Spray-can wielders from 8 to 25 years old came in four
weekdays after school for a few hours of ``living out their
aggressions,'' he said.
   ``We didn't exactly stand at the blackboard and tell them how to
sit down and the rest,'' he said. ``You would just throw down the
spray cans on the floor and there'd be an explosion of activity.
   ``It was not the kind of school where guys came along with spray
cans in their attache cases. The vandals came here.''
   ``The ones who came to us had a pain in their souls,'' said
fellow teacher Sven-Arne Hokenstrom.
   Social officials claimed graffiti lessened by more than half
while the school operated. The national government awarded it a
medal in October for reducing vandalism.
   Then the project's $27,500 fund ran out and the group lost the
lease on the school building Nov. 1.
   ``Now they're all out there again on the street,'' Spangberg
said.
   Of 150 pupils, about a dozen had serious artistic ambitions and
came for advice, Spangberg said.
   But youth centers seeking to decorate their walls with
controlled graffiti began to call the school to hire young artists.
Some people wanted their motorbikes or boats decorated. Some pupils
found they could get painting jobs that paid as much as $320.
   Inger Wissen, a social worker who thought up the project and
headed it, said the idea of a graffiti school was born in 1987,
when a wave of vandalism led to public calls for tougher police
action aginst the young.
   ``According to insurance company statistics, scribblings went
down by between 50 and 70 percent'' after the school opened, Wissen
said.
   She added that she hoped authorities would grant the project
more money so it could reopen.
   Ragnar Backman, who heads Stockholm's Department for the Removal
of Scribbling, said graffiti lessened considerably last summer. He
said the city spent $406,000 to wash away names, political slogans
and drawings in 1989.
   Backman roams the city in a small van equipped with chemical
cleansers. He said he feels no regret in removing graffiti; ``most
of it is simply messy.''
   In April, the graffiti students showed off their skill at an
exibition in a Stockholm gallery. In August, 50 spray-can artists
went to a youth fair at Strangnas, outside Stockholm, where they
painted for spectators.
   ``Police guarded them,'' Spangberg said.
   Now, the doors and windows of the graffiti school are bolted and
barred. The building is deserted, its outside walls covered in
graffiti left over from eight months of classes.
   ``What the authorities didn't count on was that the guys would
spray not only every single wall inside the school, but also
everything outside it,'' Spangberg said.

<HEAD>Thais No Longer Turn Noses up at Milk and Cheese</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JESSICA JONES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not long ago many Thais thought milk
made them sick and cheese was smelly stuff, but a younger
generation is gulping down milk and devouring cheese-topped pizzas
all across Bangkok.
   ``I think the nutritional qualities of milk are well-understood
here,'' said Mauri Uotila, of the Bangkok office of the United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. ``People here see tall
European and American people drinking a lot of milk. I think, like
all parents, they want taller children with stronger bones.''
   In keeping with an Asia-wide trend, consumption of milk in
Thailand has gone up 56 percent from 1986 to 1988, and cheese
imports have more than doubled over the past three years.
   It's quite a nutritional shift for a country where milk was once
thought fit only for infants and young children.
   But Thailand's milk consumption, averaging 9.4 quarts a year per
person, is still the lowest in Southeast Asia. Japanese average an
annual 75.5 quarts while Americans down 132 quarts, according to
Att Senasarn, general manager for Nestle Products Inc. in Thailand.
   The penetration of Western ways is also cited as a factor;
thousands of Thais return from studies in the United States with a
taste for milk shakes, pizzas and yogurt.
   Although the Thai dairy industry has been growing rapidly, it
still produces only a third of the 500,000 tons of milk consumed
yearly. The rest is imported.
   Hard to find less than a decade ago, fresh milk now takes its
place next to soft drinks at streetside stands in Bangkok. And
grocery stores are stocked with a bright array of more than a dozen
different brands and types of sweetened, flavored, plain and lowfat
milk.
   Nestle's Senasarn said that 85 percent of all milk consumed in
Thailand is sweetened or flavored.
   ``The big problem in marketing is with taste. I think the
so-called lactose intolerance problem has more to do with the
question of taste,'' he said.
   It has been claimed that the greatest obstruction in promoting
milk drinking in Thailand and other parts of Asia has been the
prevalence of lactose intolerance among many Asians.
   ``Many people here say they can't drink milk, but actually in
many cases its because they don't like it rather than because it
gives them stomach trouble,'' he said.
   Uotila said that if a person stops drinking milk over a long
enough period of time, the enzyme in the body necessary to digest
lactose in the milk disappears and the person could encounter
stomach problems including diarrhea from drinking milk.
   He said there are no statistics available on lactose intolerance
in Asia, so it is difficult to know the extent of the problem.
   About six years ago, the government began promoting milk, and
slogans _ ``Have you drunk your milk today?'' _ appeared on
billboards, television, and radio all over the country.
   ``The program was not so popular,'' said Dr. Sirikul Isanurug of
the Ministry of Health. ``People thought milk was not for adults.
This was the old concept still in mind. The government was trying
to get all parts of society to drink milk but it's not part of Thai
culture.''
   However unpopular the campaign may have been, awareness and
acceptance of milk increased considerably, according to Eric Simon,
director of Foremost Friesland Dairies, one of the leading dairy
companies in the country.
   The major milk campaign has let up in recent years, and efforts
are now being channeled into making milk available in schools, said
Jiradej Sakulneya at the state-run Dairy Farming Promotion
Organization.
   ``We are aiming milk promotion at the younger generation,
particularly those in schools because they are the most affected by
malnutrition and are the easiest to convert,'' he said. ``The older
generation is pretty useless because they are not used to it and
have problems with their stomachs.''

   There's more capitalism than altruism these days
behind the resurgence of the once nearly extinct buffalo _ the
shaggy animals are easier to raise, fetch more per pound and are
lower in fat and cholesterol than beef.
   The buffalo, which once roamed the Great Plains like a moving
black robe, was hunted for meat and hides in such great numbers
that historians say by 1889 fewer than 600 remained. Since 1970,
the number of buffalo has doubled in this country to about 60,000,
according to the American Bison Association.
   About 400 stockmen, ranchers like Brian Ward of Center, have
gone into the buffalo because of a beef market made unstable by
American eating habits. Ward runs 1,700 head on his 100,000-acre
spread in southern Colorado's San Luis Valley and sells about
100,000 pounds of boneless meat a year.
   ``We get long winters in this valley,'' he said. ``The buffalo
hide's thicker (than cattle), they got a lot more hair and they eat
and tend to be more like wild animals _ store fat in the fall and
their metabolism slows down in the winter, so they require less
feed.
   ``There are some exciting times. We drive them about 35 miles to
pasture and back every year cross country. We used to use horses
but we use motorcycles now. The buffalo don't charge the cycles as
bad as they do horses.''
   The price of good buffalo breeding stock has doubled in the past
five years to about $1,500 for a young breed cow, twice what a
comparable beef cow brings, according to the Denver-based ABA. But
buffalo meat also brings twice the price of beef, and it's lean
meat. A 3-ounce serving has 93 calories, compared to 183 for beef;
43 milligrams of cholesterol, compared to 55 for beef; and 1.8
grams of fat. compared to 8.7 for beef, the association says.
   A buffalo cow can bear calves for 30 years or more, while a cow
is usually sent to slaughter after about 10. Stockmen can also sell
skulls for $100 or so, uncured robes for $6 to $12 a square foot,
and mountable heads for $400 on up.
   The symbol of the American West is an imposing animal. It has a
black-brown, shaggy head and cape and short curved black horns. A
mature bull stands more than 6 feet tall at its hump and weighs
2,000 pounds.
   A century ago, the buffalo was nearly exterminated as the
railroads pushed westward. The slaughter was triggered by demand
for meat to feed the rail crews and the crowded East, a new tanning
method that let the spongy hides be used as leather, and political
expediency _ to destroy the Plains Indians' food supply.
   Historian Francis Haines said ``the rush of new hunters to the
Kansas plains resembled the stampede to a new gold strike. ... In
the spring of 1872 ... the constant booming of the big guns sounded
more like a battle than a hunt.''
   In 1872, Col. Richard Irving Dodge wrote there was ``apparently
no limit to the number of buffaloes.'' A year later, he found
``myriads of carcasses, The air was foul with a sickening stench
and the vast plain, which only 12 short months before teemed with
animal life, was a dead, solitary putrid plain.''
   Historians estimate 6.3 million buffalo were killed in seven
years.
   The Plains Indians, whose society depended on the buffalo for
food, shelter and clothing, either starved or surrendered. Their
lives were so miserable the ``Ghost Dance'' cult sprang up,
preaching that whites would be buried and the buffalo would return.
The Army's massacre of 200 Sioux at Wounded Knee at the end of 1890
ended the ``Ghost Dance'' movement.
   It wasn't until the early 20th century that buffalo preservation
became a concern. The newly created American Bison Society and
President Teddy Roosevelt were able to convince Congress to set up
preserves in Oklahoma and Montana in 1907. By then there were
several hundred buffalo in private herds.
   ``It was the ranchers who really took it upon themselves to save
the bison,'' said Duane Lammers, president of the ABA. ``Some of
those early people who wanted to save the buffaloes had Indian
heritage, some had Indian wives. It was very important to them to
save the bison. ...
   ``I think, too, it was just out of genuine care for them.''
   Buffalo stockmen warn that the bison remains a wild animal,
extremely powerful and territorial. There is an old saying that you
can push a buffalo anywhere it wants to go. Another is never turn
your back on a buffalo.
   But the advantages are apparent as well.
   ``They are easier to take care of,'' said Lammers, who runs
about 1,000 head on his Triple Seven ranch in South Dakota.
   ``Beef producers are living with their cow herds during the
calving season. That first spring when we didn't have cattle we
went through calving here with free time. It was like a couple of
weeks off,'' he said.
   ``If a storm comes up, I'm not losing sleep over my cattle. With
my buffalo, I can just sleep through the night.''

<HEAD>Life After `Chicken Soup' for Lynn Redgrave</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Last summer, Lynn Redgrave filmed an ABC spoof
of juries, ``Jury Duty: The Comedy.'' Almost everyone in the cast
was in an ABC series then, she says, and she was about to be.
   ``Unfortunately,'' she mused this week, ``mine is demised, as
I'm sure you're only too aware.''
   Indeed. ``Chicken Soup,'' wherein she played an Irish widow to
Jackie Mason's Yiddish-accented former pajama salesman, went poof,
amid much publicity, on Nov. 7. It was a quick yank for a new
series of great expectations but declining ratings.
   Redgrave, of the English acting dynasty, has been an actress
since 1962. She has seen works in which she was involved go poof
before. But it was a new experience to have it happen just before a
run-through of a new episode.
   The actress, whose ``Jury Duty'' finally is airing this Sunday,
still recalls that dark day in a Hollywood studio, when a ``Chicken
Soup'' run-through was halted by the arrival of executive producers
Bernie Orenstein and Saul Turteltaub.
   Orenstein had a toddy in hand, she says, ``and I thought, `This
is not a good sign. These are very professional writers, producers,
they don't drink during the working day ... something's wrong with
this picture.'
   ``And indeed it was.''
   Redgrave's disposition tends to be sunny side up. She does not
live on Rue Regret. The acting profession has been very, very good
to her, starting in the '60s with her London stage debut in ``A
Midsummer Night's Dream'' and first film hit, ``Georgy Girl.''
   Still, she wishes the lords of ABC had let ``Soup'' brew a bit
longer, as future plots called for more of a love-hate relationship
between her and Mason:
   ``I'd become somewhat becalmed in the early shows, a loving,
always-supporting person, which does not for comedy make. But we
were heading more into Laurel and Hardy, a bit of `Here's another
fine mess you've got me into.'
   ``It would have been fun. It's just a shame that nobody saw fit
to see it through a bit further.''
   But ``next'' is the slogan of the acting profession. So, after
``Soup'' shut down, Redgrave and her husband-manager John Clark,
who've lived for 10 years in Los Angeles, adjourned to New York,
where they keep an apartment.
   They took a breather from the TV ramble by returning to the
stage, where their respective careers began.
   They guest-acted for a December week on Broadway in A.R.
Gurney's ``Love Letters,'' a play about the friendship and romance
of a couple from childhood to adulthood, all told through letters
and other correspondence.
   The two hadn't acted together since meeting in the late '60s in
a British television drama, she said, but ``Love Letters'' was such
great fun they plan to do it again for two weeks in San Francisco,
starting Jan. 23.
   While here, Redgrave also teamed up with her older, equally
famous sister, Vanessa, and Sigourney Weaver, in a just-for-kicks
staged reading of the final scene from Chekhov's ``The Three
Sisters.''
   That was fun, too, she says. ``I'm hoping we can do the whole
play soon, perhaps first in England, then New York. I hope we can
do it before we get too old and have to call it `The Three
Grandmothers.' ''
   Television again someday? ``Oh, I'd love to,'' Redgrave says.
``These things (series) come and go. But you never know. Each
season comes along, and what a crap shoot it is.''

   CABLE SALUTES CABLE _ This Sunday, the ever-growing cable
industry is holding its 11th annual ACE Awards show _ the
equivalent of over-the-air TV's Emmys. Cable's big show, in Los
Angeles, starts at 8 p.m. EST. Unlike the Emmys, shown only on one
network each year, Sunday's festivities will be simultaneously
shown on 12 cable networks. They include Ted Turner's TBS
Superstation and TNT network; NBC-owned CNBC; The Discovery
Channel, and even SportsChannel America.
   GOOD START FOR ``GOOD MORNING'' _ ABC's ``Good Morning America''
narrowly edged NBC's ``Today'' in ratings for the New Year's first
week. ABC's show averaged a 4.0 rating for the week of Jan. 1-5.
``Today,'' on its first week without Jane Pauley, had a 3.8. ``CBS
This Morning'' remained a distant third with a 2.4 average. Each
rating point represents 921,000 homes.
   Ratings for this week _ the first week of co-hosting by Pauley's
successor, Deborah Norville _ aren't due until next Thursday.

   Even in death, Stuart continued to fool people. The first word
of his suicide prompted sympathy and sorrow from the DiMaitis, who
were expecting him that night for dinner. Mrs. DiMaiti had even
checked what foods Chuck could easily digest because of his stomach
wounds and resultant colostomy.
   ``We were grieving for Chuck because we thought he killed
himself through grief,'' said Carl DiMaiti. ``He couldn't go on
without Carol and Christopher. My God, he's thrown himself off the
bridge in the ultimate act of love. Then, to find out from the
police that he was a prime suspect, it was more than you can take.''
   The DiMaitis were devastated. Giusto, 64, who had open heart
surgery a few years ago, was rushed to a hospital, gasping for
breath with his blood pressure rising. His wife could not stop
crying. Carol was their only daughter. Her father had paid her way
through law school by laboring as a pizza dough maker.
   Many others touched earlier by the attack on the Stuarts, such
as the emergency medical crews and McLaughlin, the dispatcher, felt
revulsion at the revelations.
   ``It's a pretty remarkable turn of events, very bizarre and
twisted, a horrific ending to the real tragedy,'' McLaughlin said.
``Anyone familiar with the case would have ... an empty feeling
about it, especially the people involved in the mission, police and
nurses.''
   Others felt fury and anger.
   Stuart's original story about a black assailant touched off a
vast manhunt. Police fanned out through the Mission Hill
neighborhood, frisking black men. State politicians called for the
reinstatement of the death penalty.
   ``When I ordered an aggressive police response ... I wanted to
send a strong signal ... to show the city's outrage,'' Mayor
Raymond Flynn said.
   Three weeks after the murder, William Bennett, a 39-year-old
paroled convict with a long record of violence, including the
shooting of a police officer, was arrested and held on a warrant
for a motor vehicle violation.
   Bennett became the prime suspect in the Stuart case after grand
jury witnesses said he had boasted of committing the crime.
   Stuart's suicide cleared Bennett, but black leaders were
furious. They asserted that Bennett had been railroaded, that his
and other blacks' constitutional rights had been violated. They
accused law officers of being all too willing to narrow their
investigation to the black community.
   Paul Leary, first assistant district attorney of Suffolk County,
retorted that black neighborhood residents themselves had led
police to Bennett as the No. 1 suspect.
   ``Folks, Charles Stuart took us all in,'' said Flynn.

   Charles Stuart's cold-hearted scheme to kill his
pregnant wife didn't just dupe the police and a sympathetic nation.
By setting the crime in a racially mixed neighborhood and
concocting a black assailant, he also ignited a tinderbox of
resentment and smoldering anger among Boston blacks.
   Leaders of the black community say racial stereotypes helped
Stuart elude suspicion until he killed himself, 2{ months after
claiming a black mugger shot him and his wife.
   ``Stuart used the idea of a black man doing violence to a white
woman because it was probably the most reasonable thing he could
say to cover up his wrongdoings,'' said Paul Parks, a veteran
activist and former state secretary of education.
   Police and city officials have been shaken by the force of the
outcry, but they repeatedly note that they had no reason to doubt
Stuart's claim until his brother turned him in Jan. 3.
   When Stuart's suicide cleared William Bennett _ never charged
but frequently named in police leaks to reporters _ an angry
community erupted and Bennett, a man with a history of violence and
arrests, became an odd cause celebre.
   ``It was not just Bennett,'' said City Councilor Charles Yancey.
``It was the sense that the entire community of color was somehow
being blamed for this awful killing.''
   Community and church leaders held news conferences, blasting
police, city officials and the news media. Some called on the mayor
and police commissioner to resign.
   ``What there has been is a release of feelings from this
community,'' said Georgette Watson, founder of Drop-A-Dime drug tip
hotline. ``There is the release of the hurt that we've been holding
inside and the shame that's been felt over this particular crime.''
   Blacks say black victims never get the kind of attention paid
the Stuarts. They assert that the police squads who flooded the
Mission Hill area, where the shootings were alleged to have taken
place, ran roughshod over residents in their hunt for clues.
   ``The police went wild. It was like wartime,'' said Martha
Knight, an organizer at the Mission Main Task Force, who said her
25-year-old son was among the many residents stopped by police.
   ``Before he knew it, he was surrounded,'' she said. ``The cops
told him to go into the hallway and drop his pants, then his
underwear ...
   ``You couldn't send a kid to the corner store because before
they got back they'd been searched and questioned at least once.
And you can't tell me everybody they stopped and searched fit the
description.''
   Most of Boston's blacks live mainly in the Roxbury, Mattapan and
Dorchester neighborhoods. Few are seen amid the everyday bustle in
the financial, tourist, capitol and shopping sections of the city,
whose population of 562,994 includes 126,229 blacks and 36,068
Hispanics.
   It is a minority community still scarred by the violence of
forced busing, and more recently by redlining and police stops of
suspected gang members on the street.
   ``Charles Stuart touched the sore that was left by racial wounds
in this city,'' said the Rev. Bruce Wall, who counsels gang members.
   ``If you listened to the radio talk shows the day after the
killing,'' Wall said, ``you heard the white community ... calling
black people animals and saying blacks should go back to Africa.''
   But Wall was also distressed by the attention accorded the
claims of some black leaders that the police had conspired to
railroad a black man and to conceal the real crime.
   ``For my elected officials and for ministers to stand up and
vent rage ... that is not the scene that we want people to see of
this community,'' said Wall. ``It bothered me and a lot of people
that we couldn't come together and make one statement with a united
voice.''
   Mayor Raymond Flynn, whose tenure has been noted for efforts to
establish urban harmony, has tried to emphasize that much of the
impact of the Stuart case comes from extreme circumstances.
   Almost forgotten in the uproar of the last 10 days is how the
widely publicized transcript of Stuart's dramatic pleas for help
over his car phone riveted the public's attention in October.
Without that recording of a 911 operator's desperate efforts to
help Stuart, the story might have faded away as just another urban
crime tragedy.
   Said Edith Flynn, a professor of criminology at Northeastern
University, ``What I think has happened has been a collision of
longstanding prejudices with a very bizarre case.''

   The patient quivered as William McCormick
applied pressure to pinpoint the source of back pain. Then he
inserted a needle. No problem this time, though sometimes the
patients try to bite _ or kick.
   McCormick, one of about 125 U.S. veterinarians certified to
practice acupuncture, says the therapy used by the Chinese on
humans and animals for 3,500 years is an effective alternative to
Western medicine. ``The potential is vast. I feel each time I do it
I'm touching on new ground.''
   Acupuncture, whether in humans or animals, consists of
stimulating precise points on the surface of the body.
Traditionally, the stimulus is insertion of extremely fine needles;
more recently, ultrasound and lasers also are used.
   In traditional Chinese thought, each human or animal is born
with a fixed amount of energy, called ``chi.'' Energy imbalance,
from external or internal causes, is thought to be the underlying
reason for disease. By treating certain reflex points, the
acupuncturist helps the body balance its own vital energies.
   Laboratory studies have found that this balancing occurs
primarily through the nervous system, although physiological
mechanisms such as hormones also are involved, the International
Veterinary Acupuncture Society says. Balancing can adjust blood
flow, nerve and muscle tone, hormone levels or organ function.
   Dr. Meredith L. Snader of Chester Springs, Pa., executive
secretary of the society, uses acupuncture exclusively in her
practice.
   ``People are looking to alternative methods of treatment rather
than going to drugs,'' Ms. Snader said. ``The public is demanding
that vets change, instead of pumping animals full of medication.''
   The American Veterinary Medical Association endorsed acupuncture
in 1988 as valid treatment, but it hasn't been totally accepted by
veterinarians.
   ``Some think it is pretty strange and others accept it quite
readily,'' said McCormick. Ms. Snader said her colleagues were
skeptical when she started using acupuncture eight years ago. ``It
didn't bother me. I said, `Just give me a chance.' Now most of them
are very willing. Now they refer clients to me.''
   Acupuncture makes up a major part of McCormick's practice in
Virginia's horse country, where many owners and trainers insist on
it. ``My clients have come to expect expertise from me on that _
mostly because the horses have done well,'' he said. ``At its best,
it's effective 80 percent of the time.''
   Acupuncture started out as a small part of Ms. Snader's
practice, but ``the demand became so great that I had to give up my
traditional practice because I did not have time to do it.''
   While McCormick and Ms. Snader deal primarily with horses,
acupuncture can be used on any animal. ``The Chinese use it on
chickens, pigs, camels, water buffaloes,'' said McCormick. ``You
could use it on snakes for that matter.''
   Kitty Beveridge, who trains show horses at her Wind in the
Willows farm near Middleburg, swears by the technique. As McCormick
applied needles to a horse, she described the ``dramatic
turnaround'' of a 3-year-old thoroughbred treated for pain in its
back and legs. ``He became much more relaxed through work and
didn't try to hurry.''
   At Wind in the Willows, McCormick treated three horses Ms.
Beveridge planned to take to Florida for winter shows. He worked
quickly, inserting needles into the horses' backs, haunches and
legs as she held their halters.
   A chestnut roan swung its head in a half-hearted attempt to nip
McCormick, an expert on such equine disrespect after having horses
kick him in the face and lie down on him. The worst he's suffered
is a broken tooth.
   ``Working back on this end, a kick could kill you,'' McCormick
said as he inserted needles in an animal's hindquarters.
   He administered a mild sedative to two of the horses at Wind in
the Willows to cut down on rambunctious behavior as he made his way
under and around them. He said the needles themselves cause little
pain and rarely require anesthesia.
   While needles are the preferred implement, portable,
battery-operated lasers sometimes are used on sensitive reflex
points because they are less intrusive than needles. Ultrasound
machines provide deep heat and are useful for such diseases as
arthritis.
   In addition to chronic pain, acupuncture is used to treat a wide
variety of animal ailments, including reproductive, urinary tract
and abdominal problems, though McCormick said it's not effective
for such problems as broken limbs or acute bacterial infections
that require antibiotics.
   He recalled the case of an expensive race horse with an
abdominal problem. The owner spent $5,000 for surgery and $5,000
for treatment of colitis, but the horse kept having pain. When he
was called in he performed a $150 acupuncture treatment, and the
animal didn't have the problem again.
   Ms. Snader said acupuncture usually produces a positive response
within minutes. ``Usually at the end of my treatment I see a
reasonable improvement,'' she said. ``Over the next several days I
see changes in gait.''
   Although animal acupuncture was brought to the United States in
the early 1970s when President Richard M. Nixon re-established ties
with China, it isn't taught in veterinary schools, said Dr. Kent
Roberts, an associate professor at the Virginia-Maryland Regional
College of Veterinary Medicine.
   To receive certification, veterinarians must take a 120-hour
course offered by the acupuncture society.
   Acceptance would become more widespread if it was included in
veterinary education, Roberts said, but he sees little chance of
that happening because ``we're pretty well pushed to get everything
into a 4-year curriculum.''
   Still, he believes acupuncture is a legitimate therapy. ``It
certainly has stood the test of time. It must have some validity.''

<HEAD>Archaeologists Discover New Tomb in Pyramids' Shadow</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GIZA PLATEAU, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tomb built 4,300 years ago for a
palace official and his two wives has been found in the shadow of
the Giza Pyramids, the first unknown tomb discovered on the plateau
since the mid-1950s.
   ``This is the first time we've seen such a tomb,'' said Zahi
Hawass, director general of the pyramids area. ``We can find no
parallel to this tomb during the Old Kingdom.''
   Giza inspector Mahmoud Hassan Afife found the new tomb in
October when he chanced upon the edge of a limestone wall. ``We
looked at the old records to see what early excavators had recorded
in this spot. There was nothing.''
   Hieroglyphics revealed the tomb owner's name, that he was a
``purification priest'' who handled religious rituals, and that he
was a palace official.
   Hawass dates it to the end of the Fifth Dynasty, about 200 years
after the death in 2528 B.C. of Pharaoh Cheops, builder of the
Great Pyramid.
   Built of limestone blocks, the 26-foot by 66-foot oblong tomb,
called a mastaba, stands over a shaft 23 feet deep that was sealed
with mud bricks after bodies were lowered into it. The mastaba had
no inner chambers.
   On one side, ancient artists carved two false doors with the
owner's name, Per-N-Ankh. The doors face a courtyard with six
limestone columns describing him and his wives Mitrt Nefer and
N-Hwy.
   The winter archaeology season was a month old when Afife found
the tomb, and vigorous excavation has continued since. On a recent
morning, a sandstorm so engulfed the dig that workers used rubber
buckets to shield their heads from the sand. Debris cascaded onto
the tomb's base faster than diggers could dig.
   Suddenly, from deep in a shaft, a workman yelled, ``gumgumah,''
Arabic for ``skull.'' As a man above slowly turned a pulley, a
reddish-gold skull creaked its way up the pit. It appears to be a
female's, in excellent condition.
   Such a find testifies to the site's value. Nearby pits have
yielded piles of pottery shards, bones and wooden pieces that
officials said might be part of a bed or other funerary furniture
to accompany the dead into the afterlife. In an adjacent tomb were
two limestone statues of wives of pharaonic officials.
   Hawass said he knew valuable leftovers would emerge from
re-excavation of the vast Western Cemetery, begun in the fifth year
of Cheops' reign. Officials and their families used the cemetery
over the centuries, building limestone and mud-brick tombs along
avenues of various sizes.
   ``Some Egyptologists thought the area wouldn't give anything
else, but they're wrong. Early excavators were in a hurry, Indiana
Jones-style. Some even used dynamite,'' he said. ``This tomb lies
at the edge of the cemetery. Earlier this century archaeologists
dumped their dirt onto these hills without checking to see if
anything interesting lay underneath.
   ``Chances are even more tombs still lie just over there.''
   Excavating leftovers is ``never a waste of time, never
busywork,'' said Amal Samuel, Giza's chief inspector, who estimates
that as many as 4,000 tombs and pits exist in the area known as the
Western Cemetery. ``When people dug in the past they only searched
for treasure. Today, we're looking for history. We never think if
we'll find something or not.''
   Last spring archaeologists clearing another part of the cemetery
found the well-preserved, gypsum-masked head of a female mummy from
about the same period, her faint smile reminiscent of the Mona
Lisa's.
   Giza Plateau has two great cemeteries: the Eastern, between the
Great Pyramid and the Sphinx, and the Western, wedged between the
pyramids of Cheops and Chephren. Generally, queens and royal
offspring are buried in the Eastern Cemetery, officials and their
families in the Western.
   The cemeteries of mastabas were arranged in parallel rows
several feet apart, with ownership planned carefully. Everybody
wanted to be buried in the pyramids area, seeking special benefits
in life after death. Over the years, as demand increased, the
symmetry went askew. Small tombs of officials and priests were
placed among the once neat rows until the area was honeycombed.
   ``We have to think of these cemeteries as a community that
surrounded the king with the same feeling as when he was alive,''
said Hawass. ``At the top of his pyramid is the pharaoh, the head
of his country. Around him lay those who would have been near him,
his family and officials. ... Those closest are in the Eastern
cemetery, just like in a palace.''

   Nature's way of recycling water gets some
wet and wild twists in machines Bill Williamson builds to clean up
hazardous wastes for industries ranging from nuclear power to
perfume.
   ``There's a whole new science that we've got to learn,'' said
Williamson, 74, who's been experimenting with evaporation and
condensation since World War II, when he developed machines that
distilled sea water aboard warships.
   Williamson, a mechanical engineer, turned his attention to
fighting pollution 14 years ago when he and his sons, Bruce and
Rod, founded the small but fast-growing Licon Inc. in Pensacola.
   ``We are doing some weird things. Some smart physical chemists,
when they see what we are doing, they just throw up their hands,''
he said.
   Licon produces evaporators that clean up wastewater and let
industries concentrate and reuse toxic metals and chemicals that
once went down the drain into the environment. Some plants that use
the machines don't even have sewers.
   The evaporators, with a patented heat exchanger, operate at
relatively low temperatures, high efficiency and low cost, said Rod
Williamson. They can treat wastewater for 1 or 2 cents a gallon
compared to as much as 12 cents for other machines and up to $2 for
disposal in a hazardous waste dump, he said.
   One is being tested at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant;
NuPac Services plans to use it to decontaminate 2.3 million gallons
of water irradiated in the 1979 accident that shut down the
Harrisburg, Pa., plant.
   Licon evaporators, which cost $14,000 to $250,000, are in use in
the United States, Canada and Europe. Most are in metal plating
plants, although one is cleaning up shampoo wastes at an Alberto
Culver plant in Puerto Rico.
   Customers can be found in nearly any industry that produces
liquid hazardous waste, but there are limits, Rod Williamson said.
Some industries, including paper mills and chemical factories,
produce too much wastewater to be efficiently treated with
evaporators now being produced, he said.
   Bill Williamson, who holds 30 patents, said the key to the
machines is low air pressure. When boiled, even freshwater leaves a
scale, although the residue is much worse with saltwater or
wastewater and would quickly foul and corrode a conventional
evaporator. He said he discovered that heating water in a whole or
partial vacuum, thereby lowering its boiling point, would reduce
the scale and permit recovering specific salts for reuse. The
machines also reuse heat the way a heat pump improves a home
heating and air conditioning system.
   Williamson began working on desalinization while employed by
Maxim Silencer Corp., which specialized in equipment to muffle
diesel engines. It was asked to develop a way to purify saltwater
aboard Coast Guard cutters so that they could escort convoys in
World War II. The cutters were too small to carry enough fuel and
water to cross the ocean, but could make the trip if water storage
areas were used instead for fuel oil, he said.
   The company rented a beachfront house at Clinton, Conn., to test
the machine. Its resemblance to a moonshiner's still prompted
neighbors to call the police. At first, officers who raided the
place didn't believe the machine was producing nothing stronger
than water but, ``They looked at it and tasted it and said `OK,'''
Williamson said.
   He later worked on similar equipment for nuclear submarines and
in 1970 helped set up a desalting test station near the Panhandle
resort town of Destin for Mechanical Equipment Co. of New Orleans.
   Williamson and his sons then formed Licon, short for ``liquid
conditioning'' or ``liquid concentration,'' and built its first
evaporator in his garage out of pipe fittings and other parts they
bought or made.

<HEAD>Comet Austin May Put on a Big Show, But Astronomers Hedge Bets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Recently discovered Comet Austin may put
on a big show in the eastern sky at dawn in late April and early
May, delighting sky watchers who needed binoculars to get a decent
peek at Halley's Comet.
   Comet West in 1976 was the last time a comet provided
spectacular view for naked-eye observers, and ``It's high time we
had another one!'' said Leif Robinson, editor of Sky &amp; Telescope
magazine.
   But the magazine's editors, wary because of past comet
predictions gone awry, also warned that Comet Austin ``could turn
out to be just another run-of-the-mill faint comet undergoing a
temporary brightening.''
   For the rest of the winter, Comet Austin will be barely above
the western horizon after sunset, likely visible only to careful
observers with binoculars or telescopes and charts telling them
exactly where to look. In early April, it will pass 32 million
miles from the sun, which will vaporize large comet ice to create a
tail of gas and dust millions of miles long, Sky &amp; Telescope said.
   The best viewing will be in late April and the first week of
May, when the comet, speeding toward Earth, should shine in the
eastern sky at the first light of dawn with its tail pointing
upward.
   ``If it becomes as bright as hoped, you'll be able to just step
outdoors and see Comet Austin hanging among stars at the first
beginnings of daybreak,'' at least in areas away from city lights,
the editors said.
   Comet Austin was discovered Dec. 6, when it was 230 million
miles from the sun, by amateur astronomer Rodney R.D. Austin of New
Plymouth, New Zealand.

<HEAD>Scientists Figure Out the Shape of Eros: Rounded Trapezoid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA scientists used radar to figure out
the shape of Eros, an asteroid named after the Greek god of love.
   But it's not a very sexy hunk of rock. Eros is a ``rounded
trapezoid'' _ in other words, it looks roughly like a baking potato.
   Steven Ostro and colleagues at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
used a new approach to studying radar waves that were bounced off
Eros in January 1975.
   They learned that Eros is nearly 22 miles long, 9 wide and 8
thick. It rotates on its short axis, so it appears to tumble
end-over-end every five hours and 16 minutes, laboratory spokesman
Jim Doyle said.
   Ostro recently outlined his findings during a meeting of the
American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. His paper was titled
``The Shape of Eros.''
   Eros was discovered in 1898. It's orbit crosses Mars' orbit.
Eros made its closest approach to Earth this century in January
1975 when it was 14 million miles away. A few months later, it was
observed using radar at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Goldstone, Calif., facility.

<HEAD>Targeting Fats Likely to Help Weight Loss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By now, the resolutions of even the most
resolute New Year's dieters may be wearing thin _ especially if the
dieter is not.
   Americans seem forever to be dieting and falling for the latest
``miracle'' way to a thinner body. But experts insist it is only
through a permanent change in behavior that any weight loss plan
can be effective.
   Specialists lately are focusing on two factors: exercise and
dietary fat.
   ``Overall if there's anything people agree with among
nutritionists, it's that you should cut back on dietary fats,''
said Dr. Helene Swenerton of the cooperative extension nutrition
office at the University of California, Davis.
   Ron and Nancy Goor and Katherine Boyd, authors of ``The Choose
to Lose Diet'' (Houghton Mifflin, $17.95), advise, ``Don't focus on
total calories ... or sugar ... or starch. Focus on fat.''
   Eat pasta and potatoes, they say. ``Carbohydrates are the good
guys.''
   Because fat is often a big component of food that's not real
nutritious anyway, and because it's more calorie-dense, it's a good
target for dieters.
   ``Fats are twice as concentrated as carbohydrates or proteins,''
said Jayne Newmark, a dietician at the Arizona Heart Institute and
a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association. One gram of
protein or carbohydrate has four calories; one gram of fat has at
least nine.
   ``The Choose to Lose Diet'' works on the principle of a fat
``budget.'' The dieter determines, based on height, desired weight
and frame size, how many fat calories can be consumed daily. Then,
as long as the dieter stays within the budget, all foods are OK.
   ``You need to eat some fat,'' Newmark said. ``But it is easy to
get too much, because it tastes good.'' In children, especially,
fats should not be drastically reduced, because they are needed for
proper growth and development.
   ``The way to make it easier is to do small simple changes, one
at a time,'' she said. For example, switch from a high-fat to a
low-fat cheese or limit the amount of cheese eaten. ``I'd rather
someone follow 50 percent of what I say forever, than 100 percent
for a while.''
   Still, dieting is dieting and means cutting down, though
very-low-calorie, unsupervised diets are considered dangerous by
many physicians.
   ``Choose to Lose,'' which includes calorie and fat tables and
recipes, recommends no fewer than 1,000 calories a day, and no more
than 20 percent of the calories as fat. A typical American diet is
35 percent to 40 percent fat.
   The authors list foods with high fat concentrations and those
without, lists that could surprise some people. They include fast
foods and frozen ``diet'' dinners that get as many as half their
calories from fats. Microwave popcorn, for example, has 99 to 214
fat calories per ounce; popcorn popped at home in oil has 138;
air-popped popcorn has no fat calories.
   The Goors say the impetus for their new book came from an
earlier book on lowering cholesterol; people who cut back on
saturated fats to reduce cholesterol found they also lost weight.
   Although all fats have the same caloric content, experts say
saturated fats, such as butter, contribute to other health problems
as well. They recommend olive and other vegetable oils.
   But while people can take some action, ``with respect to weight
control, we don't have the answers,'' Swenerton said, noting that
98 of 100 people regain weight they lose and that many people are
misled by diet promises.
   ``One kind of misinformation is that obesity is just from eating
too much,'' she said. ``That's only part of the whole picture,''
which also includes exercise, psychology and genetics.

<HEAD>Georgia-Pacific Chairman Accused of Giving False Testimony</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. has accused
Georgia-Pacific Corp. Chairman T. Marshall Hahn Jr. of providing
untruthful testimony in the paper companies' merger fight,
according to documents unsealed Wednesday.
   Great Northern charged that Hahn falsely said under oath that
his company had no plans to sell mills in Millinocket and East
Millinocket during the time it was asking bankers to finance the
attempted takeover of Great Northern. At the time, Georgia-Pacific
actually told Citibank it would sell the Maine assets but did not
want to go on record saying so, the documents indicate.
   The latest charges to surface in Georgia-Pacific's $3.8 billion
attempt to acquire Great Northern were unsealed late Wednesday by
U.S. District Judge Gene Carter, after Citibank said it would not
oject.
   Citibank had been approached by Georgia-Pacific to be the lead
lender in the deal, but Bank of America ultimately was chosen, the
court documents say.
   Georgia-Pacific immediately responded with a statement that
repeated its assertion that there is no plan to sell the Maine
mills and lashed out at Great Northern's ``scurrilous and false
charges.''
   Great Northern's filing came as part of its attempt to persuade
the judge to block Georgia-Pacific's merger attempt as well as
Georgia-Pacific's attempt to oust Great Northern's directors in a
proxy fight.
   The filing says that, although Georgia-Pacific told Citibank it
wanted to sell the Maine assets, Hahn told lawyers in a sworn
deposition last week in New York such sales had been ruled out
``before the first approach through lending institutions for
financing of the offer.''
   In its motion for a preliminary injunction, Great Northern says
Georgia-Pacific broke securities laws by attempting to cover up its
plans to sell the Maine properties.
   But Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific called Great Northern's
accusations ``unconscionable and intolerable.''
   ``For the umpteenth time, we have no asset sale plans and no
undisclosed intentions relating to the acquisition of Great
Northern Nekoosa,'' Hahn said in the statement, adding that he
cannot ``control what interpretations others may make of our
discussions.''
   Great Northern says Georgia-Pacific has tried to conceal its
alleged plans to sell the Maine assets in order to make the merger
more politically palatable in Maine. Great Northern also is
challenging the merger on antitrust grounds, as is the Maine
attorney general.

   The paperwork generated by the takeover
battle between paper giants Georgia-Pacific Corp. and Great
Northern Nekoosa Corp. has become so immense that a judge has
stepped in to free up the court clerk's copy machine.
   ``Counsel on all sides of this case have, by virtue of their
written submissions, given ample evidence of their devotion to the
mercantile interests of the paper industry,'' U.S. District Judge
Gene Carter said during a December hearing.
   Carter issued an order, filed Tuesday and made available
Wednesday, that the clerk's office begin sending everything
involved in the companies' five lawsuits to a nearby copy shop so
the store can make copies for sale to the public.

<HEAD>New York Attorney General To Sue Unless Exxon Admits Liability</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York attorney general says he will sue
Exxon Corp. for an oil spill off Staten Island unless the company
admits its liability and agrees to pay for damages within 48 hours.
   ``It is imperative that Exxon immediately accept its liability
not only to clean up its spill, but also to fully compensate the
state financially for the damage to New York state's natural
resources,'' Attorney General Robert Abrams said in a letter sent
Wednesday to Exxon President Lee R. Raymond.
   Abrams called on Exxon to pay for an immediate study ``to assess
the damage to natural resources caused by the spill and to
determine the best ways to restore our natural resources.''
   Abrams said the study should be done under the supervision of
the state.
   More than 560,000 gallons of home heating oil leaked from an
Exxon pipeline into the Arthur Kill waterway off Staten Island on
Jan. 2.
   Abrams said the oil has contaminated ``critical waterfowl
feeding and wetland areas of the environmentally sensitive Pralls
Island bird sanctuary.''
   Exxon has also been criticized for the handling of the spill of
11 million gallons of oil from the Exxon Valdez tanker last March
24 along 1,000 miles of Alaska coastline. It was the worst oil
spill in U.S. history.
   On Wednesday, Exxon said it had created a senior management
position to handle safety and environmental issues.
   Edwin J. Hess, an executive formerly in charge of marketing,
refining and planning for international operations at the nation's
largest oil company, has been named to the new position of vice
president, environment and safety.
   Hess will report to Raymond.
   Since the Alaska spill, Exxon shareholders have called on the
company to show greater environmental accountability. The company
subsequently named an environmentalist to the board of directors
and created a special committee to review environmental issues.
   Abrams accused Exxon of creating a ``mini-Alaska'' in the Arthur
Kill.
   He said the damage was ``compounded by Exxon's apparent failure
to notify New York state and city environmental officials of the
spill immediately upon its discovery.''
   On Tuesday, Exxon said a company refinery operator twice
restarted the flow of oil through the leaking pipeline after
automatic safety systems stopped the flow.
   Exxon also told New York and New Jersey environmental officials
that a system to detect leaks in the pipeline had been faltering at
least once or twice a week for a year.
   More than 200 birds have been found dead since the leak was
detected.
   A spokesman for Abrams, Leslie Gersing, said the attorney
general would file a lawsuit if Exxon had not met his conditions by
late Friday.
   A spokesman for Exxon, Bill Smith, said the company did not
receive the letter until after business hours and had no immediate
comment.

<HEAD>Siemens Agrees To Acquire Majority Stake in Financially Troubled
Nixdorf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Siemens AG, the giant electronics
company, will acquire a majority stake in Nixdorf Computer AG, a
financially troubled West German data and information-systems
maker, officials said.
   The two companies plan to merge their computer operations after
the transaction, according to a brief announcement from Nixdorf on
Wednesday.
   The announcement gave few details of the transaction or the
intended plans of the two companies.
   Earlier Wednesday, sources at Munich-based Siemens said their
company had acquired 51 percent of Nixdorf for an unspecified price.
   Siemens also officially confirmed the Nixdorf pact.
   Meanwhile, the West German Federal Cartel Office said it had
been informed of the intention of the two companies, but that a
formal application for approval had not yet been submitted.
   The cartel office must rule on the agreement and is empowered to
reject it if it finds antitrust concerns.
   The companies said Siemens acquired the common stock from the
Nixdorf family, which in effect controls all the voting common
shares. There are about 5.6 million common shares outstanding.
   Nixdorf's 5.6 million non-voting preferred stock shares are
listed on West German exchanges.
   Up to now, the Nixdorf family had been reluctant to part with
their full control of the company despite deep financial problems.
   There had not been any hint of the negotiations with Siemens,
which in the past stated publicly its interest in taking a stake in
Nixdorf.
   It was not immediately clear what, if any, measures Siemens will
take to help Nixdorf recover from ongoing financial losses that the
West German news magazine Der Spiegel recently reported as totaling
$560 million last year. Nixdorf has not confirmed that figure.
   In its press statement Wednesday, Nixdorf said it will continue
to push through its previously announced broad corporate overhaul
aimed at improving profitability by cutting costs, beefing up
productivity and redirecting strategic priorities.
   The company plans to pull out of loss-producing business areas
such as the manufacture of various types of computer hardware.
   A Nixdorf spokesman said his company's exchange-listed preferred
shares will not be affected by the Siemens agreement and that this
stock will remain in public hands and traded on exchanges.
   Meanwhile, Nixdorf said the contemplated business arrangement
with Siemens is predicated on the idea that both companies' data
and information systems businesses would together form a powerful
market force.
   ``The corporate focus of both companies lies in these areas,
though up to now in different market segments and geographic
regions,'' Nixdorf said.
   Under the agreement, Siemens would merge its data and
information systems operations with those of Nixdorf, which would
then become a majority-owned affiliate of Siemens.
   Final details of the transaction and the merging of the business
lines remain to be worked out, the companies said.

   MCI Communications Corp. has announced
cut-rate calling plans to Western Europe, the Pacific and Canada.
   The plans _ Call Europe, Call Pacific and Call Canada _ will
provide flat, per-minute rates during weekdays and all weekend for
a $3 monthly fee, MCI said Wednesday.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. responded to MCI's plan with
a belated announcement of its own international calling program,
AT&amp;T Reach Out World. AT&amp;T said it the plan has been in effect
since July but not announced formally.
   Under MCI's Call Europe plan, callers will be charged 59 cents
per minute to call any of 23 Western European nations on weekdays
from 3 p.m. to 8 a.m., and all weekend.
   In the Call Pacific plan, calls may be made to Australia, New
Zealand and eight Asian nations for 79 cents per minute from 10
p.m. to 2 p.m. the following day, and all weekend.
   Call Canada is priced at 19 cents per minute from 5 p.m. to 8
a.m. weekdays and all weekend.
   The plans are expected to be available Jan. 15, said Wayne
Gattinella, MCI's vice president for consumer marketing.
   Gattinella said a 10-minute call at 8 p.m. to the United Kingdom
would cost $5.90 under the new plan, compared with current MCI
prices ranging from $8 to $8.50 for the same 10-minute call.
   An evening 10-minute call to France now costs between $7.75 and
$8.25, Gattinella said. On Saturday morning, it now costs about
$8.50.
   AT&amp;T's plan also provides discounts calling to 25 nations for an
additional fee of $3 a month. Reach Out World customers also
receive a 5 percent discount on direct-dialed interstate calls
within the United States, the company said.
   AT&amp;T has offered discounts for calling to Canada for three
years, and to the United Kingdom and the Philippines for the past
two years.
   AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said AT&amp;T had planned to tie a formal
announcement of its international calling plan with a national
advertising campaign due to begin today.
   MCI estimated that residential international calling represents
a $5 billion market and is growing 25 percent annually. It
estimated that 10 percent of U.S. consumers make monthly overseas
calls, with an average duration of 10 minutes.
   Both MCI and AT&amp;T said they planned to add additional countries
to their plans this year.

   Members of the House Banking Committee are
considering abolishing the new office Congress established last
August to regulate thrift institutions during the 1989 savings and
loan crisis.
   Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., said Wednesday he will
introduce a bill when Congress reconvenes to eliminate the Treasury
Department's Office of Thrift Supervision and turn its authority
over to two bank regulators, the Comptroller of the Currency and
the Federal Reserve Board.
   A similar approach has been advocated by Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa,
the second ranking Republican on the banking committee.
   Schumer said M. Danny Wall's resignation as the thrift office's
top official ``presents us with a tremendous opportunity to
straighten out a regulatory system that most agree has been
jerry-built.''
   Wall, after being harshly questioned by the House panel in six
weeks of hearings last fall over his regulation of the now
collapsed Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif.,
announced in December he would step down from the job as soon as
President Bush finds a replacement.
   The new thrift office in the Treasury Department was established
as part of a $160 billion taxpayer bailout of S&amp;L lossses to
replace the Federal Home Loan Bank Board as the industry's chief
regulator.
   A former banking aide to Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, and one-time
staff chief of the Senate Banking Committee, Wall had chaired the
bank board for slightly more than a year prior to its abolition.
   While effectively making S&amp;Ls come into compliance with federal
banking rules, Schumer complained that last year's bailout law also
allowed them to retain their own separate regulator, ``leaving open
the potential for the same abuses that scarred the industy and
depositors in the past.''
   ``Since the two agencies promulgate regulations that are
required by law to have the same practical effect, it is clear that
only one body is necessary,'' he said of the thrift and
comptroller's offices.
   Schumer said his bill would gradually merge the thrift office
into the Comptroller of the Currency's agency to coincide with the
scheduled phase-out in 1994 of the Resolution Trust Corp., another
new agency established in the bailout law.
   The trust corporation's primary function is disposing of up to
$400 billion in real estate and other property collateralizng
soured loans by failed thrifts that have been or will be taken over
by the government.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Suing MCI Over Marketing Practices</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The long-running feud between American Telephone
&amp; Telegraph Co. and upstart MCI Communications Corp. continues to
escalate with new charges of deceptive telemarketing practices
being lodged.
   AT&amp;T sued MCI and its telemarketing agent, Pioneer
Teletechnologies of Sergeant Bluff, Iowa, on Wednesday, claiming
they stolesome of its long-distance customers by using false or
misleading information or by switching services without customers'
consent.
   MCI strongly denied the allegations.
   The suit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Newark,
N.J., is the latest salvo in a battle that began in the 1970s when
MCI successfully broke AT&amp;T's long-distance monopoly.
   AT&amp;T still remains the nation's largest long-distance carrier,
with about 68 percent of the market, followed by MCI, with about 12
percent, and US Sprint Communications Co., with 8 percent.
   Last October, MCI sued AT&amp;T for allegedly engaging in deceptive
advertising by claiming AT&amp;T's service was superior or that MCI had
misrepresented its services or rates.
   AT&amp;T countersued, questioning claims made in MCI ads.
   In the latest court action, which seeks an unspecified amount of
damages, AT&amp;T claims it suffered losses in the ``tens of millions
of dollars'' by MCI's alleged deceptive telemarketing practices.
   AT&amp;T also petitioned the Federal Communications Commission to
amend its rules so that telephone customers would have to provide
written permission before switching long-distance carriers. Current
rules allow customers to authorize a change verbally.
   ``We believe our proposal to the FCC will curtail the numerous
instances of unauthorized switching _ or `slamming' as it's known
in the industry _ that consumers have endured,'' Merrill Tutton,
AT&amp;T's vice president for consumer services, told a news conference
in New York on Wednesday.
   ``I think there are probably an awful lot of people there who
this has happened to, but they haven't gone to the trouble to
complain.''
   AT&amp;T claimed that the ``many thousands of complaints'' it did
receive from consumers about MCI _ particularly from elderly people
who might suffer from hearing problems or Hispanics who faced
language barriers _ prompted it to seek legal action against MCI.
   ``I'm talking about ... a 90-year-old woman in New Jersey who
gets a call asking her if she'd like to sign up with MCI ... (and)
couldn't hear the representative clearly, so she asked that they
send her information by mail,'' Tutton said. ``Instead, she gets a
letter from MCI and learns she's been switched without her
approval.''
   Tutton claimed other customers said MCI erroneously told them,
for example, that they needed to switch services because AT&amp;T and
MCI were merging or that AT&amp;T was going out of business.
   When asked, Tutton said AT&amp;T could not provide specific numbers
of people who complained and did not have permission to release
names of the complainers.
   He said preliminary studies showed that from February to
November of last year, 10 percent to 15 percent of the AT&amp;T
customers switching to other long-distance carriers had been
unaware of the change.
   John Houser, a spokesman for Washington-based MCI, said the
company ``categorically denies that we have been misleading
customers.''
   MCI said AT&amp;T is acting out of frustration at MCI's success in
attracting new business since the breakup of the Bell System in
1984.
   ``MCI has been winning customers in the marketplace at a rate of
over 100,000 a week based on value and superlative customer
service,'' the company said in a statement.
   ``This is just another example of AT&amp;T preaching competition on
one hand and whining when competition takes hold in the
marketplace.''

<HEAD>SEC: Lawyer Made $4.35 Million in Insider Trading</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A suspended Minneapolis lawyer denies charges
that he illegally traded on inside information to pay back more
than $1 million he allegedly diverted from clients' accounts.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil complaint
against James H. O'Hagan on Wednesday, charging he made $4.35
million in illegal profits by trading on inside information about
Grand Metropolitan PLC's bid for Pillsbury Co.
   The SEC also alleged O'Hagan engaged in insider trading to repay
money taken from client trust accounts.
   In Minneapolis, O'Hagan attorney William Mauzy said his client
denied trading on inside information but concededed he ``borrowed''
money from clients' accounts. Mauzy said O'Hagan has been charged
with theft by the Hennepin County, Minn., prosecutor, but asserted,
``He really didn't have to make a score in Pillsbury to repay the
accounts.''
   Mauzy said O'Hagan was a ``sophisticated and heavy investor in
the stock market'' who accumulated a total of $5 million in his
accounts before he began trading Pillsbury securities.
   O'Hagan also maintains he bought Pillsbury shares on the
recommendation of brokers, who have filed affidavits with the SEC
to that effect.
   On Dec. 5, 1989, O'Hagan was temporarily suspended from
practicing law by the Minnesota Supreme Court.
   The SEC complaint, filed in federal court in Minneapolis,
accuses O'Hagan of trading Pillsbury securities in 1988 using
misappropriated confidential information about Grand Met's pending
hostile tender offer.
   O'Hagan at the time was a partner in the law firm Dorsey &amp;
Whitney, which was local counsel for Grand Met, a British food and
beverage producer, in the bid for Pillsbury. Grand Met acquired
Minneapolis-based Pillsbury in January 1989.
   O'Hagan left Dorsey &amp; Whitney late last February, said Robert
Struyk, chairman of the Minneapolis firm.
   Struyk said O'Hagan, who specialized in securities, commodities
and medical malpractice litigation, had been with the firm since
1963 or 1964. He said Dorsey &amp; Whitney was not involved in the case
and had cooperated with the SEC.
   The complaint alleges that O'Hagan learned of the pending Grand
Met offer in July 1988 after speaking with another Dorsey &amp; Whitney
partner.
   According to the complaint, between late July and Sept. 21,
1988, O'Hagan bought Pillsbury stock and call options. On Oct. 4,
1988, Grand Met announced its cash tender offer for Pillsbury at
$60 per share, driving up the stock's price by $20.
   From Oct. 5 to Oct. 17, O'Hagan sold his Pillsbury stock and
options, allegedly netting $4.35 million in profits.
   Mauzy said in a statement that when O'Hagan learned in September
1988 that Dorsey &amp; Whitney had been approached to act as counsel to
Grand Met, he immediately cancelled outstanding orders to purchase
options to buy Pillsbury shares.
   The SEC complaint alleges that O'Hagan needed the trading
profits to repay about $1 million he had secretly diverted from a
client of his law firm, Northrup King Co.
   The complaint also alleged O'Hagan diverted funds from at least
two other clients, which were not identified.
   Asked if it was unusual for an SEC complaint to go into such
detail about the alleged motive for a violation, Harry J. Weiss, an
SEC attorney who worked on the case, said: ``Keep in mind this case
is not settled. The complaint contains all evidence that the
commission thinks is relevent.''
   The complaint seeks a court order requiring O'Hagan to return
the profits from his alleged illegal deal plus fines equal to his
profits.

<HEAD>Payment Deadline Passes; Doubts Persist About Campeau's Financial
State</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campeau Corp. has saved face by paying certain
bills on time but the larger question of whether the troubled
company and its U.S. retailers can achieve a financial turnaround
remains unresovled.
   Campeau said Wednesday it was sending payments on schedule to
numerous merchandise suppliers.
   In addition, the company's restructuring committee announced the
appointment of a new executive to direct the financial revival at
Campeau's U.S. holdings, including Allied Stores Corp. and
Federated Department Stores Inc. Campeau also owns shopping malls
and other commercial real estate in the United States.
   There has been widespread speculation in the retail trade that
Campeau might seek shelter for its U.S. retailers in bankruptcy
court, which would allow its stores to remain open while they work
out their financial dilemmas.
   By paying money owed to vendors, the Canadian retail and real
estate company signaled its interest in maintaining good relations
with manufacturers that do business with its nearly 260 U.S.
department stores.
   Carol Sanger, spokeswoman at Campeau's corporate communications
office in Cincinnati, said most of the bills, which total about
$100 million, were for women's apparel.
   ``The fact that these bills are being paid ... as they are due
reinforces the company's desire to deal with its vendors in as
close to a normal course of business relationship as possible and
it also reinforces the value we place on our relationships with
vendors,'' Ms. Sanger said.
   She said the Campeau board, which met Monday and Tuesday, met
again Wednesday at the company's Toronto headquarters. The meeting
was adjourned by afternoon and was scheduled to reconvene this
morning.
   After adjourning, the board issued an announcement on the
appointment of Chance Bahadur to the post of executive vice
president and chief financial officer of Campeau Corp. (U.S.) Inc.
He will assume his new duties immediately. Bahadur is joining
Campeau from Marriott Corp., where he has been senior vice
president of finance and treasurer since October 1988.
   The board also said it accepted the resignation of Russell S.
Davis as executive vice president and chief financial officer of
Campeau, Federated and Allied. Davis, who joined Federated in 1984,
had been promoted to executive vice president and CFO of Federated
and Allied in May 1988 and added those titles at Campeau in April
1989.
   Board members said they understook Davis' ``desire to relinquish
a range of responsibilities ... that has become increasingly
demanding and unrelenting in recent months.''
   The bills due Wednesday were for goods shipped during the peak
shopping weeks ahead of Christmas. Companies that regularly deal
with the Campeau stores have said bills from last autumn were paid
promptly.
   But when news of the depth of Campeau's financial difficulties
unfolded late last year, many suppliers suspended further
merchandise shipments and said they would decide whether to resume
after Jan. 10, when new bills came due.
   A number of manufacturers of women's sportswear and other
apparel said they had been notified their bills were being
processed and had no reason to doubt it.
   The Wednesday deadline had been viewed as an important symbolic
date by the retail trade. Even merchants who weren't owed anything
were watching for what Campeau would do so they could decide
whether to take the risk of doing future business with its stores.
Spring merchandise typically is shipped starting at the end of this
month.
   Janet Mangano, director of research at the investment firm
Josephthal &amp; Co. Inc., said it is still unclear whether Campeau
will be able to pull out of its problems. She said meeting current
bills from suppliers didn't mean Campeau would be able to cover
debt obligations coming due in the near future.
   A more crucial test for Campeau will come Monday. Allied and
Federated must assure Citibank and other members of a group that
lent them $2.34 billion that they are solvent. The loan could be
declared in default if they cannot give the assurance.
   Disclosures about Campeau's financial predicament surfaced in
September. The Canadian property company Olympia &amp; York
Developments Ltd. provided a $250 million cash infusion and Campeau
said it would restructure its far-flung operations and attempt to
reorganize its finances.
   Campeau's precarious condition was caused chiefly by the heavy
debt burden it built up when it bought Federated in 1988 for $6.6
billion and Allied two years earlier for $3.4 billion.
   Part of the restructuring plan already mapped out involves
selling Federated's Bloomingdale's department store chain,
considered one of Campeau's most valuable possessions.
   Federated's other chains include Abraham and Straus, Burdines,
Lazarus and Rich's. Allied operates the Bon Marche, Jordan Marsh,
Maas Brothers and Stern's chains.

   ``However, the committee will have to examine his background and
qualifications carefully during the confirmation process,'' Riegle,
D-Mich., said in a statement. ``Clearly, the position of SEC
commissioner, at this time, is among the most important in
government.''
   Lochner had been general counsel of Time Inc., which renamed
itself Time Warner Inc. last year and officially merged Wednesday
with Warner Communications Inc., resulting in the change in his
title to deputy general counsel.
   Reached at Time Warner's New York office, Lochner declined to
comment on the SEC nomination.
   ``I just spent the better part of a year working with him on the
Time Warner deal,'' said Samuel Butler, presiding partner of the
New York law firm of Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore, where Lochner worked
from 1973 to 1978.
   ``I think it's an excellent nomination,'' said Butler, who was
Lochner's boss for a year in the 1970s. ``He had a lot of
securities experience when he was here, generally,'' said Butler,
adding ``He brings an an excellent business-legal perspective to
the SEC which it hasn't had for a long time.''
   If confirmed by the Senate, Lochner would serve out the
remaining 17 months of the term of former SEC Chairman David S.
Ruder, who stepped down last year and was succeeded by Bush aide
Richard C. Breeden.
   Breeden, who was at Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore during part of the
time Lochner was there, hailed the nomination.
   ``His background as a lawyer with extensive experience in
securities and general corporate law and as a former law professor
and associate dean make him uniquely qualified to serve on the
commission,'' Breeden said in a statement.
   Time Warner said in a statement issued at its New York
headquarters: ``Time Warner has a tradition of encouraging public
service and we are very proud of Phil's nomination.''
   Lochner, of Greenwich, Conn., was general counsel and secretary
for Time Inc. and Time Warner starting in September 1988.
   He was among the supporters of Time management's decision to
reject a bid from Paramount Communications Inc. last year and go
ahead with the $14 billion Warner merger.
   But like several officials at Time and Warner, he found he was
one of two employees with the same job title at the merged company,
although a Time Warner spokesman denied that Lochner's post had
become redundant.
   A 1964 graduate of Yale University, Lochner joined Time Inc. as
an associate general counsel in 1978. He obtained his law degree
from Yale in 1967 and a doctorate in political science from
Stanford in 1971.
   Before going to work at Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore, Lochner served
as an associate dean and assistant law professor at the State
University of New York at Buffalo from 1971 to 1973.

   The stock market chalked up a broad gain today,
rebounding from the decline of the past two sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 12.59 to 2,763.23
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 5 to 2 in the early tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 664 up, 287 down and
498 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 24.46 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Stocks actually began to recover from their recent slump in the
late stages of Wednesday's session, when the Dow Jones industrials
recovered more than half of their early loss.
   Analysts said prices seemed to reach levels where they attracted
``bargain hunters'' willing to stake their money on the possibility
that the economy can avoid a recession in the months ahead.
   Still, some observers questioned whether the market could mount
a sustained rally before traders get a look at the fourth-quarter
earnings reports due out over the next three weeks or so.
   The profit figures for the October-December period are expected
to be unimpressive or worse for many companies.
   Gainers among the blue chips included General Electric, up \ at
65; Philip Morris, up &rsqb; at 40&lsqb;; Merck, up } at 77&lsqb;, and
International Business Machines, up { at 99{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.74 to 192.86. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.14 at 379.43.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 15.36 to
2,750.64, bringing its loss over the past two sessions to 43.73
points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 2 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 484 up, 1,036 down and 447 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 175.99 million shares, against 155.21
million in the previous session.

<TEXT>
   Dallas jurors who gave Houston Lighting &amp; Power
Co. a favorable verdict in a $419 million lawsuit will be flown to
Houston at the utility's expense for a tour of its nuclear plant
and a stay at a luxury hotel.
   The utility confirmed it invited the jurors about a month ago to
come to Houston at HL&amp;P's expense, the Houston Chronicle reported
today.
   Spokesman Graham Painter said that because the jurors' role in
the case is over, there is nothing improper about HL&amp;P Chairman Don
Jordan's playing host and showing off the plant.
   He did not know how many jurors would take up the offer, nor
would he estimate the cost of the air fare and overnight
accommodations during the trip this weekend.
   The jurors decided in July that the utility's partner in the
South Texas Nuclear Project, the city of Austin, deserved no
damages for HL&amp;P's withholding information that would have allowed
the city to anticipate huge cost overruns.
   The trial was held in Dallas after a judge determined that a
fair trial could not be held in Austin.
   City officials in Austin said the invitation to jurors and the
judge was just the latest impropriety in the utility's push for the
plant, whose cost ballooned from $900 million to almost $6 billion.
   ``It's highly unprofessional and very questionable. Until the
people of Texas realize that this sort of shenanigans cost the
people hundreds of millions of dollars, it won't stop,'' said City
Councilman George Humphrey.
   ``When you have a jury that rules the defendant is guilty and
awards no damages and a short time later, they're offered free air
fare, free lodging, free meals and first-class treatment, it can't
help but cast a doubt.''
   ``I've never heard of this happening in civil litigation. I
think it's fundamentally unethical, but so what else is new?'' said
Councilman Smoot Carl-Mitchell.
   Clarence Guittard, a retired appeals court judge who presided
over the four-month trial, decided not to join the plant tour. He
gave no reason, the newspaper reported.
   Painter said public tours of the plant in Bay City, 90 miles
from Houston, usually include lunch and that the utility decided
jurors should stay overnight in Houston because of the time it
takes to get from Dallas.

   Nissan Motor Co. Thursday unveiled the NX Coupe, a
sporty two-door liftback with a 1.5-liter engine and digital
instrument panel.
   The 13.5-foot-long car has a 140-horsepower, four-cylinder
engine and ``large, easy-to-read digital instruments that project
an entirely new feeling.''
   ``A sporty interior has been created through the use of a
three-spoke steering wheel and sports seats,'' a Nissan release
said.
   In Japan, the NX Coupe will cost 1.14 million to 1.96 million
yen, between $7,860 and $13,500. Exports, primarily to North
America, are to begin in May, but Nissan said it has not yet
decided on export prices.
   Nissan also unveiled a revamped Sunny, known as the Sentra in
North America.
   The new version of Nissan's mainstay four-door sedan
discontinues the garnish used around the ceiling in the previous
model and brings the instrument cluster 2.75 inches closer to the
driver.
   The Sentra has engine options similar to the NX Coupe, along
with a 1.8-liter version.
   It will cost between 845,000 and 2.11 million yen in Japan and
also will be exported, mainly to North America, starting in May.

<TEXT>
   Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo
says Eastern Airlines' rebuilding program is a case of smaller is
better, but that he needlessly provoked ``a united opposition''
from the carrier's three unions.
   In a rare Miami appearance since all three of Eastern's unions
went on strike last March 4, Lorenzo told a Downtown Rotary Club
luncheon crowd Wednesday he should have been ``more sensitive to
the realities the union leaders were dealing with.''
   Lorenzo's remark echoed earlier statements of Eastern officials
that management had underestimated the resolve of the carrier's
pilots. The pilots and Eastern's flight attendants walked off the
job in sympathy when the airline's machinists went out on strike.
   The pilots and flight attendants only returned to work in late
November.
   ``The last year has been a very difficult one,'' Lorenzo told
his audience. ``There have been mistakes, and there have been a lot
of things I know all parties would like to change.
   ``If you look at the last nine months as a battle,'' he said,
``it is a battle no one has won, with the possible tiny exception
of consumers.''
   Arriving for the luncheon, Lorenzo, whose Texas Air bought
Eastern four years ago, walked through rows of striking Machinists
chanting ``choke, Frank, choke'' and warned Rotarians to ``secure
your wallets.''
   Police officers stood guard for the speech.
   Inside, Lorenzo told the Rotarians Eastern losses for the eight
years before he took over the carrier amounted to $1 billion. He
said major changes were needed, but that union leaders were
reluctant to face the needed changes.
   Thousands of dedicated employees, he said, are out of work
because ``they got caught in a system that was no fault of their
own.'' Cutting wages and employees was hard ``from a human point of
view,'' but there was no choice, he said.
   But Lorenzo said Eastern's rebuilding was succeeding since
seeking Chapter 11 protection from creditors shortly after the
strike began.
   ``While the airline that's out there today is not as big as the
airline it was before, I believe very strongly and I believe you
will, too, when you see it that a lot of quality has been
substituted for quantity.''
   Lorenzo said there has been a strong response to Eastern's newly
announced discount fares, starting at $69, and the airline has been
getting good consumer response to its service overall.
   ``We face the '90s with great optimism,'' he said.
   But Frank Ortis, the Machinists union Local 702 president, said
afterward that Lorenzo ``is in big trouble'' as he tries to bring
Eastern out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.
   Eastern is plagued by cancellations and ``their load factors
have been disastrous,'' said Ortis, who was not allowed to attend
the speech. ``It's time for Frank Lorenzo to come to his senses and
sell the airline so we can save it.''
   Ortis said 96 percent of the Machinists are still out on strike.

<TEXT>
   At least four major supermarket chains
switched off vegetable-freshening mist machines like the one
implicated in a deadly outbreak of Legionnaires' disease. The
manufacturer said the device wasn't to blame.
   Winn-Dixie, Safeway, A&amp;P and Kroger said their stores stopped
using the machines as a precaution after learning that one at
Winn-Dixie's Bogalusa store had been blamed for November's
outbreak, which killed two people and infected dozens.
   Researchers traced the bacteria to the one-quart water reservoir
of the mist machine at the supermarket, one of three in this
southeast Louisiana town of about 16,000 people, said Dr. Louise
McFarland, state epidemiologist.
   ``This is the first time a community outbreak of Legionnaires'
disease has been traced to a mist machine of any type,'' she said.
``I don't think anyone would ever have suspected it.''
   The machine fell under suspicion after the store was implicated
in interviews with the 70 people who fell ill and about 150 who
didn't.
   The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta was examining the
device to determine what role its design may have played in
harboring the bacteria, which cause flu-like symptoms, officials
said.
   Other supermarkets use mist machines, but it was not known if
they were made by the same company, L.W. Beal of Portland, Maine,
said Dr. Thomas Farley, an epidemiologist with the state Department
of Health and Hospitals.
   Beal said his company supplies the sprayers to most major
grocery chains and has had no other problem with other systems.
   ``The Legionnaires' virus is in the water in that area,'' Beal
said. ``You'll find it in any kind of machine that uses water and
is not properly cleaned.
   ``If a machine is properly cleaned you won't have a problem. If
you have an ice cream machine and you don't clean it properly, you
can't blame an outbreak of salmonella on the manufacturer of the
machine.''
   Health authorities long ago learned that the Legionnaires'
bacteria thrive in standing water, but Farley said researchers
learned important lessons from the Bogalusa investigation.
   ``We now know more about where the bacteria can hide and what
can cause an outbreak,'' he said. ``That's important to Louisiana
and the nation.''
   The machine was installed more than a year before the outbreak,
said Lewis Libby, vice president of Jacksonville, Fla.-based
Winn-Dixie.
   Winn-Dixie had been using the Bogalusa-type mist machine in 97
of its 1,250 stores in 13 Sun Belt states, Libby said. The machines
were removed, and those stores are spraying tap water from hoses to
keep produce fresh.
   All misting machines at Safeway's 1,200 stores, mostly in the
western United States and Canada, have been turned off and were
being cleaned, said Bob Bradford, a spokesman for the Oakland,
Calif.-based company.
   ``We have two types. We are not sure if we have the one
involved,'' he said. ``We just thought it would be best to turn
them off until further notice.''
   Cincinnati-based Kroger, the nation's second-largest chain with
more than 1,200 stores in 20 mostly Midwestern and Southern states,
said it has stopped using the spayers in its produce departments.
   It said most of its stores use automatic spray or mist systems,
but that stores in the Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio, areas use hoses.
   Montvale, N.J.-based A&amp;P originally said it would not stop using
its misters because they do not have reservoirs to hold the water
like the one in Bogalusa. But spokesman Michael Roarke said today
that the company had decided to shut down its misters temporarily
because of customer concern.
   He said A&amp;P has 1,250 stores in 26 states and Canada and uses
the misters in about 200 outlets.
   Legionnaires' disease, first identified in 1976 after an
outbreak at an American Legion convention in Philadelphia killed 34
people, is caused by bacteria that often thrive in cool, standing
water found in such places as water towers or air conditioning
ducts. The germ usually enters the lungs through water droplets.

   Savings and loan regulators who penalized two
directors of a bankrupt Colorado savings institution are leaving
open the possibility of sanctions against other former officers,
including President Bush's son.
   Enforcement officials from the Office of Thrift Supervision met
Monday with Bush's son, Neil, who served on the board of Silverado
Banking, Savings and Loan Association from 1985 until August 1988,
thrift office spokesman William Fulwider said today.
   ``He's been here ... as have other associates of Silverado,''
Fulwider said.
   The Houston Post said in today's editions that Bush met with
thrift office enforcement director Rosemary Stewart for four hours.
   The thrift office said Wednesday that two directors of Silverado
have agreed to an order prohibiting them from working at any
federally insured financial institution without prior approval from
regulators.
   The order covers commercial banks, savings institutions and
credit unions.
   Richard K. Vandapool, formerly vice chairman and chief operating
office of the thrift, and Robert M. Lewis, formerly vice chairman
and chief financial officer, agreed to the penalty without
admitting or denying the allegations against them.
   No action was announced against Neil Bush. However, the thrift
office said it was still investigating the S&amp;L, was ``considering
what action should be taken against any other former Silverado
directors and senior management'' and ``anticipates the initiation
of other prohibition actions in the near future.''
   The office said in a statement that examiners had expressed
``grave concerns'' about the soundness of Silverado before closing
it in December 1988.
   ``The regulators were particularly concerned about what they
believed to be excessive concentration in commercial loans in a
depressed market, an unusually large number of problem transactions
with related parties such as shareholders, officers and directors,
and inefficiencies in assessing the credit worthiness of
borrowers,'' the thrift office said.
   Lewis' lawyer, Michael Bender, said his client denied any
wrongdoing but agreed to the penalty because ``he just doesn't have
the money to fight the feds.'' Liz Kearney, an attorney for
Vandapool, had no comment.
   Another agency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., is
reviewing Silverado to determine whether to file a civil suit to
recover some of the institution's losses from officers and
directors.
   James Moroney, a former examiner at the Federal Home Loan Bank
of Topeka, has alleged in interviews that regulators did not crack
down on Silverado because of its political ties, including the
presence of Neil Bush on the S&amp;L's board.
   Neil Bush, however, has denied attempting to influence
regulators and has said he is cooperating with investigators.
   Regulators sold Silverado to a Ford Motor Co. subsidiary, First
Nationwide Bank of San Francisco, which renamed it Mile High
Federal Savings and Loan Association.

   Grain futures opened mixed, and soybean futures
were higher this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat prices were boosted by the purchase overnight of
100-thousand metric tons of wheat by the Soviet Union. The Soviets
are in the market today for an additional 500-thousand metric tons
of winter or spring wheat.
   Continued good growing weather in South America is expected to
weigh on soybean futures, as will slack demand for soy and
Malaysian palm oil.
   Analysts say corn futures are expected to remain steady today.
   Overall, trading is expected to be subdued in anticipation of
the release this afternoon of several U.S. Department of
Agriculture crop reports.
   Analysts say the Agriculture Department is expected to announce
that farmers planted more acres of winter wheat last fall than they
did a year earlier. The department also is expected to increase
slightly its estimate of the size of last fall's corn and soybean
harvest.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 1 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.06{ a bushel; corn was } cent
lower to a \ cent higher with March at $2.38 a bushel; oats were }
cent lower to a { cent higher with March at $1.44{ a bushel;
soybeans were a { cent to 2 cents higher with January at $5.69\ a

   Livestock and pork futures were higher in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle prices were lifted by followthrough buying from
Wednesday's strong close and the belief cash prices will rise.
   Pork futures prices rose despite steady to lower cash prices.
   Live cattle were .17 cent to .40 cent higher with February at
77.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .37 cent higher
with January at 84.35 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent lower to
.33 cent higher with February at 51.27 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .37 cent to .73 cent higher with February at 56.47

   Livestock futures settled mixed and pork futures were higher in

<HEAD>J.P. Morgan Reports $1.3 Billion Loss for '89</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. reported a 40 percent drop in
fourth-quarter earnings Thursday and a $1.3 billion loss for the
year, a decline that reflected a major increase in the bank's
reserves for problem debt.
   The 1989 loss, which translates to a loss of $7.04 a share,
compares with earnings of $1 billion or $5.38 a share a year
earlier.
   For the final quarter of 1989, the nation's third-largest bank
reported earnings of $154 million or 81 cents a share, vs. earnings
of $258 million or $1.38 a share in the year-earlier period.
   Morgan joined a long list of major U.S. banks that moved to
bolster their reserves when it announced in late September it was
adding $2 billion to provisions for potentially bad loans to Third
World countries.
   Loan-loss reserves totaled $2.05 billion for the full year,
while Morgan had $3.6 billion in total outstanding debt to
restructuring countries. The bank noted that at the end of 1989, 64
percent of its total loans to restructuring countries were
protected by reserves.
   In the previous year, Morgan had set aside $200 million to cover
potentially bad loans.
   Net interest income totaled $275 million for the final quarter,
down 54 percent from $603 million in the last quarter of 1988. For
the full year, net interest income was $1.1 billion, down 39
percent from $1.8 billion in 1988.
   Morgan said interest income lagged throughout the year because
flat yield curves in major markets prevented the bank from taking
advantage of favorable interest rates.
   Noninterest income rose 18 percent in the fourth quarter to $444
million from $377 million a year earlier. For the full year,
noninterest revenue totaled $1.74 billion, up 12 percent from $1.56
billion 1988, partly reflecting gains from the sale of securities
and higher trading revenues.
   Noninterest expenses totaled $535 million in the final quarter
and $1.9 billion for the full year, up 5 percent and 7 percent
respectively, from $511 million for the year-ago final quarter and
$1.8 billion for 1988.

<TEXT>
   Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. cast doubt
today on an obscure Texas businessman's questionable takeover
proposal, and a Canadian brewer said it might offer $1.6 billion
for part of the troubled conglomerate.
   Peter Lucas, spokesman for the Australian group of companies
controlled by millionaire industrialist Alan Bond, said Bond Corp.
has not been able to obtain information about a proposed $197
million cash offer by Jeff Reynolds.
   Meanwhile, John Labatt Ltd., a Canadian brewer, said the company
is considering making a bid for Bond Corp.'s Australian brewing
operations.
   Edward Stewart, spokesman for the Toronto-based company, said
Bond approached Labatt about buying the brewing businesses about a
month ago.
   ``On the basis of the preliminary look we had at the most recent
profit figures provided to us, we believe the offer might be in the
range of 1.6 billion to 2 billion Australian dollars,'' Stewart
said. An Australian dollar is worth about 79 cents, making an offer
potentially worth up to $1.6 billion.
   Stewart cautioned though, that no firm offer would be made for
``several weeks at best.''
   Lucas said the lack of information from Reynolds had convinced
Bond Corp. officials that he could not proceed with his planned
takeover.
   ``In the absence of any such information having been made
available so far, despite repeated requests, we are taking the view
at this time that he does not have that capacity,'' said a
statement from Bond Corp. headquarters in Perth, Western Australia.
   Lucas said Bond Corp. had written Reynolds asking him to provide
information confirming his financial intentions with regard to
purchasing the company.
   ``It was made very clear to Mr. Reynolds and his associates
right from the very beginning that there would be no discussions
until Bond Corp. was satisfied that Mr. Reynolds and-or his
companies have the financial capacity to undertake a transaction of
the size and nature he proposes,'' Lucas said.
   Reynolds, reached early today at his mother's home in Houston at
first declined comment, then threatened to press on with a hostile
bid if Bond Corp. does not work with him.
   ``Either they're with me or they're against me, and if they're
against me they better look out,'' Reynolds told the Associated
Press.
   He also reasserted that he has the $197 million, but said he was
trying to put together refinancing for Bond's huge debt.
   Lucas also said Reynolds' public comments were causing Bond
Corp. ``considerable embarrassment.''
   Reynolds, 28, said in a news release last week that he was
negotiating with Bond Corp., whose Australian brewing assets were
recently placed in receivership by an Australian supreme court.
   However, little is known about Reynolds or his companies, which
U.S. officials said Monday did not appear to be publicly traded as
he contends.
   Reynolds says he heads a firm called Weatherby Investments Inc.
He has said he planned to visit Australia to talk with Bond and was
prepared to take out citizenship to seal a deal, thereby overcoming
any obstacles over foreign investment in Australian media.
   ``There is certainly an air of scepticism about the fellow and
I've got to tell you we share that scepticism,'' Lucas said told a
television station here.
   He said Reynolds first contacted Bond about 10 weeks ago through
an intermediary, and that Bond Corp. had responded asking for more
details.
   Bond Corp. was founded by Alan Bond, a former America's Cup
yachting winner and multimillionaire entrepreneur whose holdings
include brewing, natural resources, property and media. He also
owns the G. Heileman Brewing Co. in Wisconsin.
   Bond's empire is saddled with debts of nearly $6 billion and the
group of companies is involved in several court actions. Bond has
appealed the supreme court action placing his Australian brewing
assets in receivership.

   Ranch foreman Bryant Copeland, eyes
shaded from the Florida Panhandle sun by a cowboy hat, grinned and
gazed at the new stock grazing on the 12,000-acre spread. He wasn't
looking at cows.
   ``Crawfish are easier to round up than cattle are,'' he said in
his Arkansas drawl. ``Harder to brand, but easier to round up.''
   He was kidding about the branding but not the roundups at M-K
ranches, where millions of squirmy crawfish, resembling tiny
lobsters, feed in outdoor ponds. They're herded with 40 flat-bottom
boats built in Louisiana bayou country where crawfish are a staple
of the Cajun diet.
   Until five years ago Copeland never had eaten crawfish. Now he
supervises one of the nation's largest crawfish-raising operations.
   Each year, M-K Ranches produce from 850,000 to a million pounds
of crawfish, also are known as crayfish or ``mud bugs.'' The
operation has 12 full-time employees but it grows to more than 100
during harvesting from mid-Janary through June.
   It isn't just a ``crawfish plantation,'' said J.T. Murff Jr.,
who owns M-K Ranches in partnership with his father.
   Softshell crab, freshwater shrimp, fingerling catfish and
tilapia, an African perch, also are raised in a
temperature-controlled production building although crawfish in the
19 ponds outside are the main product.
   The Murffs, who had been in the cotton business in Memphis,
Tenn., bought the property almost 18 years ago. The land was
cleared of pine trees and up to 7,000 head of cattle roamed until
1979.
   ``The cattle market at the time made it where that didn't look
economical,'' Murff said in a telephone interview from his Memphis
office.
   Some cattle remained, but most of the land was switched to
crops: corn, soybeans, rice, wheat, milo and sunflowers. Copeland,
an expert in rice growing and watering, was brought in. By 1984
rice was the main crop. Water to flood the rice ponds was diverted
from the nearby Brothers River.
   The federal government then removed price supports that had kept
rice at about $7 a bushel. Rice prices dropped in half in 1985, and
it no longer was profitable, Murff said. Meanwhile, Cajun cuisine
had become a national rage.
   ``A lot of people were eating crawfish and Cajun cooking and
creole cooking,'' Copeland said. ``We had the water and we had the
ground so we put in 2,500 acres of crawfish ponds.''
   Crawfish were especially attractive because they could be raised
with relatively little modification to the shallow rice ponds,
Murff said. They feed on decaying hay and rice, both grown on the
ranch.
   Until this year, processing had been farmed out to seafood
plants in Panama City and Port St. Joe, but M-K is building its own
on-site plant. It is scheduled for completion later this month.
   The crawfish, caught in traps, are sold live or preboiled and
seasoned in frozen blocks of 5 to 25 pounds under the brand name
Crawfish 1 in 29 states. Up to 15 percent of the catch goes to
Europe where it is prepared in a dill sauce rather than hot Cajun
spices, Murff said. A few months ago, M-K donated 1,000 pounds of
crawfish to Californians made homeless and hungry by the earthquake
that shook the San Francisco area.
   Tail meat also is sold at a higher price, but the most
profitable product is softshell crawfish. It is a gourmet item that
goes for $7.50 to $9 a pound wholesale compared to a range of 60
cents to $1.25 for hardshell crawfish.
   ``Softshell tastes real good and besides that you get to eat the
whole crawfish,'' Copeland said.
   For the softshell process, immature crawfish are sorted into
hundreds of shallow holding trays in the production building. They
remain there until they shed their shells which happens about once
every two weeks.
   As soon as a crawfish molts, it is plucked from the holding
tray, put in cold water and then frozen before its new shell can
harden. The same process is used with crabs.
   ``The trouble is everyone knows what a softshell crab is, but
very few know what a softshell crawfish is,'' Murff said.
   He is trying to spread the word through advertising directed
toward distributors and with displays at trade shows.
   The Cajun craze has done more for blackened fish, chicken and
meat than for traditional Louisiana-style boiled crawfish, Murff
said. While crawfish have covered the overhead, M-K hasn't yet
turned a profit.
   ``We couldn't create the high-value niche we thought we could,''
Murff said.
   He remains committed to aquaculture but believes diversification
into species with larger and established markets will be the
answer. He has ordered some ponds converted to raise fresh water
shimp and new ponds dug for catfish.
   The switch to aquaculture meant some retraining for ranchhands,
but Copeland said his lifestyle remains little changed.
   ``Farming is farming,'' he said. ``It's 24 hours a day, seven
days a week.''

   Shares closed modestly higher on London's Stock
Exchange Thursday, shaking off worries over British inflation with
active blue-chip buying.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished 5.3
points, or 0.2 percent, higher at 2,417.9. Volume came to 578.8
million shares, up from 449.3 million shares Wednesday.
   Dealers attributed Thursday's modest recovery to at program
trading in oil and gas stocks. The program helped spark a flurry of
buying in a range of blue chip stocks, dealers said.
   The action also helped mute early concerns over wage inflation
in Britain exerting further pressure on interest rates, fueled by
Ford Motor Co.'s 10.2 percent wage increase offer to British unions
late Wednesday.
   The unions rejected offer, dampening hopes that Britain's high
interest rates could be eased by spring, dealers said.

<HEAD>Agriculture Secretary Warns Wheat Growers of Budget Restrictions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLEY SHANNON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter
told wheat growers Thursday that developing countries can be good
customers and that U.S. exporters should take advantage of sweeping
reforms in eastern Europe.
   He also told the National Association of Wheat Growers that as
the 1990 Farm Bill is debated it will face tight budget
restrictions, and farmers must choose where federal dollars will be
spent.
   ``I see the developing countries as among your best customers in
the coming years,'' Yeutter told about 700 people at the
association convention.
   Wheat growers should continue to watch developments in Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union, where economic changes are taking
place and countries are getting more involved in world trade,
Yeutter said.
   But he said those nations must first control their debt, which
has been a barrier to exports.
   Other export obstacles have been ``non-tariff barriers'' that
U.S. negotiators currently are trying to eliminate, Yeutter said,
referring to talks on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
known as GATT.
   ``Everybody has a gimmick to keep a competitive product out,''
he said, citing barriers such as quotas, import licensing and
minimum import prices. Yeutter said he favors converting those
provisions to tariffs.
   Yeutter also said he favors continuing to use the Export
Enhancement Program to counteract European Economic Community
export subsidies until international negotiations are concluded.
   Yeutter refused to disclose details of his agency's Farm Bill
proposals until President Bush releases his budget plan. But he
said the Agriculture Department will not be spared the budget ax.
   Yeutter said the agriculture industry must decide among such
areas as research, deficiency payments and crop insurance in
spending federal money.

   The stock market staged a moderate advance
today, rebounding from the decline of the past two sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 43.73 points in
the past two sessions, rose 14.93 to 2,765.57 by 2 p.m. on Wall
Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 8 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 838 up, 523 down and
554 unchanged.
   Stocks began to recover from their recent slump in the late
stages of Wednesday's session, when the Dow Jones industrials
recovered more than half of their early loss.
   Analysts said prices seemed to reach levels where they attracted
``bargain hunters'' willing to stake their money on the possibility
that the economy can avoid a recession in the months ahead.
   Still, some observers questioned whether the market could mount
a sustained rally before traders get a look at the fourth-quarter
earnings reports due out over the next three weeks or so.
   The profit figures for the October-December period are expected
to be unimpressive or worse for many companies.
   Federal National Mortgage rose 1 to 36~ in active trading. The
company reported fourth-quarter earnings of 90 cents a share, up
from 63 cents in the comparable period of 1988.
   Philips Industries fell 2} to 18{ on a company estimate of lower
earnings for the fiscal quarter ended Dec. 31.
   Businessland, which announced plans to reduce its work force by
5 percent to 7 percent as part of a restructuring plan, dropped }

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.79 to 192.91. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .96 at 379.25.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 108.30 million shares with two

   The U.S. dollar rose against most major currencies
in Europe Thursday and gold prices advanced.
   The dollar rose because of a perception that the West German
mark had become overvalued after rising sharply against the U.S.
currency in recent weeks, foreign exchange dealers said.
   The mark had been boosted by expectations that the liberal
revolution shattering Communist control of Eastern Europe would
invigorate the West German economy.
   Dealers said they expect the dollar to trade in a narrow range
around 1.70 marks. Central banks are likely to intervene to sell
dollars if the U.S. currency rises toward 1.73 marks, a level it
last reached on Dec. 20.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.6575 late Thursday from
$1.6625 late Wednesday.
   Other rates for the dollar in Europe compared with Wednesday's
late rates: 1.6800 marks, up from 1.6795; 1.5210 Swiss francs, up
from 1.5120; 5.7325 French francs, up from 5.7145; 1.9021 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.8815; and 1,258.50 Italian lire, up from
1,255.00.
   The U.S. currency fell to 1.1575 Canadian dollars from 1.1585.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar slipped to 145.27 Japanese yen from
145.30. The dollar edged slightly lower in London later to close at
145.25 yen.
   Gold dealers said strong buying from Switzerland early in the
day boosted the bullion price. Gold rose to a late bid price of
$412.25 a troy ounce in London, up from $408.55 late Wednesday. In
Zurich, gold rose to a late bid price of $412.75 from $409.25.
   In Hong Kong earlier, gold rose to $411.75 an ounce from $405.65.
   Silver rose four cents in London to a late bid price of $5.34 an
ounce.

   Grain futures prices fell and soybeans rose
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade. Volume was held down in
anticipation of several U.S. Department of Agriculture crop reports.
   Soybean futures were buoyed by a slight rebound in cash prices
after farmer selling slowed from the pace set earlier in the week.
Soybean prices also were supported by expectations of increased
export sales.
   Buying by a number of commerical houses also strengthened
soybean futures.
   Wheat futures continued to show weakness due to the lack of
export business. Traders were disappointed that the Soviet Union
failed to enter the market Thursday for 500,000 metric tons of
winter or spring wheat as expected.
   A forecast of weekend rain and the National Weather Service's
latest six- to 10-day outlook that calls for rain in the Central
Plains also dragged down wheat prices, said analyst Joel Karlin of
Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   Corn futures traded in a narrow range, as traders marked time
before the release of the USDA reports.
   Analysts said the department is expected to announce that
farmers planted more acres of winter wheat last fall than they did
a year earlier. The department also is expected to raise its
estimate of the size of last fall's corn and soybean harvest.
   At the close, wheat was a { cent to 1} cents lower with the

   A Canadian brewer said Thursday it was
considering making a bid for the Australian brewing operations of
Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd., the Australian conglomerate staggering
under nearly $6 billion in debt.
   Bond Corp., controlled by millionaire industrialist Alan Bond,
approached John Labatt Ltd. about buying the brewing businesses and
Labatt has studied the possibility for about a month, said Edward
Stewart, Labatt vice-president of corporate affairs.
   ``On the basis of the preliminary look we had at the most recent
profit figures provided to us, we believe the offer might be in the
range of 1.6 billion to 2 billion Australian dollars,'' Stewart
said in a telephone interview from Toronto.
   Based on the present exchange rate of about 79 cents per
Australian dollar, an offer could be worth up to $1.6 billion.
   Stewart said it would be at least several weeks and perhaps
months before Labatt makes any offer, adding that Labatt is not
interested in acquiring Bond Corp.'s U.S. brewing unit, G. Heileman
Brewing Co.
   The Australian beer operations, Bond Brewing Holdings Ltd., were
forced into receivership last month by a syndicate of Australian
and international banks, which contend Bond violated provisions of
a $690 million loan agreement. Bond is seeking to overturn the
receivership.
   Bond Brewing also is under threat of legal action from a group
of investors holding $510 million in U.S. securities, who this week
rejected a plea from Bond to delay $32 million in overdue interest
payments.
   John Labatt is Canada's biggest brewer and a leading beer
exporter to the United States. The company also markets dairy
products, grain products, packaged and frozen foods and owns 45
percent of the Toronto Blue Jays professional baseball team.
   Separately Thursday, a little-known Texas entrepreneur seeking
control of Bond Corp. for $197 million reacted angrily when told
that Bond had stated he did not appear to have the capacity to
actually undertake the deal.
   Jeff Reynolds, 28, claims he has $197 million lined up and is
negotiating for financing to service Bond's immense debt. He has
declined to provide any details or identify his source of funds,
but Bond Corp. had said it was willing to listen to him.
   On Thursday, however, Bond released a statement from its
headquarters in Perth, Western Australia, saying it had been unable
to obtain information about the proposed cash offer.
   Bond said Reynolds' bid was doubtful and causing the company
``considerable embarrassment.''
   ``It was made very clear to Mr. Reynolds and his associates
right from the very beginning that there would be no discussions
until Bond Corp. was satisfied that Mr. Reynolds and-or his
companies have the financial capacity to undertake a transaction of
the size and nature he proposes,'' Bond Corp. spokesman Peter Lucas
said.
   ``In the absence of any such information having been made
available so far, despite repeated requests, we are taking the view
at this time that he does not have that capacity,'' Bond's
statement read.
   Read the statement during a telephone call to his mother's home
in Houston, where he has been living since fall, Reynolds first
declined comment. Then he said he would consider a hostile bid.
   ``Either they're with me or they're against me, and if they're
against me they better look out,'' he said.
   Reynolds' Weatherby Investments Inc., the Nevada company through
which he is trying to gain control of Bond Corp., is no longer
chartered as a corporation in that state, according to documents
provided to The Associated Press on Wednesday.
   Reynolds is not named in the incorporation documents, although
his father, Dallas businessman L. George Reynolds, was listed as
president of Weatherby in 1986, when the last filing was made.
   Weatherby lost its charter in 1987 after failing to file its
annual list of officers and the charter never has been reinstated,
according to the Nevada secretary of state's office.

   Dayton Hudson Corp. named a new president
Thursday and announced the start of an employee stock ownership
plan.
   Stephen E. Watson, who has been chairman and chief executive of
the Dayton Hudson Department Store Co., will replace Bruce G.
Allbright as president of the parent corporation when Allbright
retires at the end of January, the nation's fifth largest retailer
announced.
   Watson, 45, has been the top executive at the Minneapolis-based
department store company for the past five years. As president of
the parent corporation, he will be responsible for financial,
legal, personnel, public relations and audit functions under
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth A. Macke.
   Watson's successor at the department store company will be named
later this month, Macke said.
   The stock ownership plan, authorized by the board of directors
in July, will supplement an existing retirement and savings plan.
   Dayton Hudson said its ESOP will be funded with $379 million of
newly authorized preferred stock that can be converted into 4.38
million shares of common stock. To fund the stock purchase, the
ESOP will borrow $379 million with a 15-year loan from the
corporation.
   Dayton Hudson has about 71.2 million shares of common stock
outstanding. When all of the ESOP shares are added, the ESOP would
account for about 5.8 percent of the total shares.
   ESOPs sometimes are used as anti-takeover devices by putting
more stock in friendly hands, but company spokeswoman Ann Barkelew
said ``that's not what drove the decision to have an ESOP. The
primary motivator is to improve the benefit program for our
employees.''
   Dayton Hudson became the target of a hostile takeover attempt in
1987, when the Haft family of Washington, D.C., acquired 4.6
million shares. The company sought help from the Minnesota
Legislature in fending off the hostile bid. The Legislature then
passed a corporate anti-takeover bill in a one-day special session
June 25 of that year.
   The takeover threat ended when the stock market collapsed in
October 1987. Soon after the Hafts announced they were selling
their Dayton Hudson stock, the company announced a program to buy
back 15 million shares of its stock to put more of the shares in
friendly hands. In July, when the ESOP was authorized, the board of
directors also approved the repurchase of up to 7 million
additional shares of its common stock.
   In a separate development Wednesday, the company's board of
directors increased the regular quarterly stock dividend by 18
percent, from 28 cents to 33 cents per share.
   Dayton Hudson had 1988 annual revenue of $12.2 billion. The
corporation has about 140,000 employees in its Target, Mervyn's and
Dayton Hudson Department Store Co. divisions and operates 659
stores in 33 states. About 70,000 employees would be eligible to
participate in the ESOP, the company said.

   Ansett World Aviation Services of
Australia has ordered $110 million worth of jet engines from Pratt
&amp; Whitney to power as many as 12 Airbus aircraft, Pratt &amp; Whitney
said Thursday.
   Ansett ordered PW4000 engines for six A300-600R Airbus twinjets,
a total of 14 engines including spares, and took options on 12 more
engines to power another six planes, said Pratt &amp; Whitney, a unit
of United Technologies Corp.
   If Ansett chooses to order all 26 engines, the value of the
orders would be $225 million, Pratt &amp; Whitney said.
   Pratt &amp; Whitney claims its PW400 is the most fuel-efficient,
high thrust engine ever developed.

<HEAD>Personal Computer Retailer To Cut More Than 200 Jobs</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS last graf to delete incomplete reference; No pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Businessland Inc., a personal computer
retailer, announced plans Thursday to cut about 200 jobs in a
restructuring.
   Businessland said it would make a one-time staff reduction of 5
percent to 7 percent of its 3,900 worldwide workforce, meaning a
loss of from 195 to 273 jobs.
   The company said the cuts were due to recent acquisitions and
streamlining through a multimillion-dollar investment in automating
information systems and field distribution.
   Businessland, which resells personal computers and workstations
to a mostly corporate market, did not indicate where the jobs would
be eliminated.
   The San Jose-based company, which reported soft sales in its
first quarter ended last Sept. 30, said the restructuring is
targeted to take advantage of cost savings from new management
information systems and ongoing consolidation of distribution
operations.
   Businessland, founded in 1982, reported sales last year of $1.2
billion. The company said sales growth remains strong, with revenue
estimated at more than $370 million for the second quarter ended
Dec. 31.

<HEAD>Rose $6.82 Billion in Latest Week</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Interest rate figures reported by Donoghue's Money Fund
Report are for week ended Tuesday. All other figures are for the
week ended Wednesday.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 483 money market mutual
funds surged by $6.82 billion in the latest week to an all-time
high of $375.23 billion, the Investment Company Institute said
Thursday.
   It was the third-largest weekly rise ever and reflected what the
institute called powerful seasonal flows of money, such as yearend
bonuses, that usually are paid in January and deposited into
interest-bearing accounts.
   The biggest weekly rise in fund assets _ $9.64 billion in the
week ended Oct. 21, 1987 _ came after the stock market collapse as
investors sought safe havens for their money. The second-biggest
weekly rise was $7.62 billion in the week ending Jan. 13, 1988,
largely caused by seasonal money flows.
   The institute, a Washington-based mutual fund trade group, also
sharply revised its week-earlier figures on fund assets, originally
reported as down by $955 million to $365.04 billion.
   Under the revision, assets rose $2.41 billion to $368.41 billion
because 14 new funds were included. The revised total was a record
until eclipsed by the latest weekly rise. The previous record of
$386.27 billion was set Nov. 21.
   The institute said that in the latest week, assets of 241
general purpose funds rose $1.26 billion to $124.50 billion, assets
of 98 broker-dealer funds increased $3.65 billion to $160.59
billion, and assets of 144 institutional funds rose $1.91 billion
to $90.14 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.80 percent from 8.06 percent the
previous week, said Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 7.92 percent from 7.94 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
38 days, down from 39 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual
yield available on money market accounts fell to 6.33 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.35 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, remained unchanged at 5.07 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.90
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 7.92
percent the previous week. Yields were 7.93 percent on 1-year CDs,
down from 7.95 percent; 7.89 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 7.90
percent; and 7.91 percent on 5-year CDs, unchanged.

   Petroleum futures prices continued their upward
climb Thursday after a brief bout of selling to make profits.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, No. 2 heating oil for
February delivery, which rose 1.83 cents Wednesday, gained another
2.44 cents to settle at 69.32 cents a gallon. Other contract months
showed smaller increases.
   The February contract for unleaded gasoline traded on the Merc
advanced 1.17 cents to settle at 65.50 cents, adding to its
3.45-cent surge in the previous session.
   The February contract for West Texas Intermediate, the leading
grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 24 cents to $23.14 per 42-gallon
barrel. The contract jumped 83 cents on Wednesday. Other contract
months remained below $23 a barrel.
   Analysts noted that dealers quickly began cashing in on the
week's runup in prices when trading began, but they said the
momentum driving prices higher returned well before midday. Trading
was active.
   No specific news was cited as having moved the market. But Peter
Beutel, assistant director at Elders Futures Inc., said reports
that the above-normal temperatures in the Northeast would drop by
the weekend helped support prices.
   Prices surged Wednesday in reaction to a big decline in gasoline
inventories.

<HEAD>Coffee Prices Tumble</HEAD>
<HEAD>By ROBIN STAINER</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee prices plunged in London trading Thursday
reflecting a supply glut.
   Coffee for March delivery slumped to the equivalent of almost
$1,010 a metric ton, $33 below the 14-year low touched late last
month and down $44.55 from Wednesday's closing level.
   The big consumers were holding off buying, according to analysts
at coffee traders E.D.&amp; F. Man.
   ``It's the well-known story of too much coffee and doubts that
the market's safety-net can be restored quickly,'' one analyst
said. ``The longer-term view is even more pessimistic with expected
good crops from April onward from Indonesia and Brazil and the
continuous offer of coffee from West Africa.''
   The London market trades in robusta-type coffee, which is
traditionally cheaper than the higher quality arabica variety grown
throughout Latin America.
   Arabica prices are also depressed, but remain above their
14-year lows reached last October.
   Both markets plunged then, following the decision of the
74-nation International Coffee Organization in July to abandon its
market-support role indefinitely. Its safety-net for prices of
export quotas was suspended.
   Supplies of arabicas have been tightened by recent frosts in
Mexico's coffee-growing region and the decision of Central American
producers to keep 15 percent of their current crop off the market
to help stabilize prices, traders said.
   There are also delays to shipments of arabicas from Colombia, El
Salvador and Nicaragua and prospects of a worse than expected
Brazilian arabica crop, according to Man.
   Brazil grows mainly arabicas, but also robustas.
   Informal consultations among producing and consuming countries
on restoring the coffee organization's quota stystem have so far
made little progress, according to experts at West German coffee
specialists F.O. Licht.
   Producer and consumer officials said Thursday they expected no
breakthrough on the issue when the two sides meet in London Jan.
16-17 for what promises to be a routine meeting of the coffee
organization's 16-nation executive board.
   They said hopes of quick action may have been set back by
differences between Colombia and the United States over
Washington's decision to station warships off the Latin American
nation's coast in an attempt to intercept drug shipments.
   The United States and Colombia _ respectively the world's
biggest consumer and the second-biggest producer of coffee _ have
so far been at the forefront of efforts to restore the coffee
organization's quota system.

   The stock market rebounded from the setback of
the past two sessions with a moderate advance Thursday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 43.73 points
Tuesday and Wednesday, rose 10.03 to 2,760.67.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
879 up, 566 down and 535 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 154.39 million
shares, down from 175.99 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 185.27 million shares.
   Stocks began to recover from their recent slump in the late
stages of Wednesday's session, when the Dow Jones industrial
average recovered more than half of its early loss.
   Analysts said prices seemed to reach levels where they attracted
``bargain hunters'' willing to stake their money on the possibility
that the economy can avoid a recession in the months ahead.
   Still, some observers questioned whether the market could mount
a sustained rally before traders get a look at the fourth-quarter
earnings reports due out over the next three weeks or so.
   The profit figures for the October-December period are expected
to be unimpressive or worse for many companies.
   An exception to that prospect was Federal National Mortgage,
which jumped 1{ to 37&rsqb; as one of the day's most active issues. The
company reported fourth-quarter earnings of 90 cents a share, up
from 63 cents in the comparable period of 1988.
   Kaufman &amp; Broad Home, which also posted higher quarterly
profits, gained ~ to 13~.
   By contrast, J.P. Morgan dropped { to 41~. The bank holding
company's fourth-quarter earnings declined to 81 cents a share from
$1.38 a share in the like period a year earlier.
   Philips Industries fell 3\ to 18. A company estimate of lower
earnings for the fiscal quarter ended Dec. 31 was followed late in
the day by word that a management group couldn't get financing for
a $24-a-share buyout offer and had dropped the bid.
   Businessland, which announced plans to reduce its work force by
5 percent to 7 percent as part of a restructuring plan, dropped |
to 7&lsqb;.
   Precious-metals stocks gained ground on the strength of a
continuing rally in world gold prices. ASA Ltd. rose 1| to 61\;
Battle Mountain Gold &rsqb; to 18\; Homestake Mining 1 to 21}, and
Newmont Gold 1&rsqb; to 54&rsqb;.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $8.31 billion, or 0.25
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .66 to 192.78.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.42 to 400.57, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.22 at 348.53.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 1.84 to 448.86. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 379.35, up 1.06.

<HEAD>Grains Futures Fall, Soybean Gain in Light Trading</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain futures prices fell and soybeans rose Thursday on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Volume was held down in anticipation of
several U.S. Department of Agriculture crop reports.
   On other markets, livestock and pork prices were higher,
precious metals were mixed, and energy futures climbed.
   Wheat settled } cent to 2{ cents lower with the contract for
delivery in March at $4.04} a bushel; corn was 2 cents lower to a {
cent higher with March at $2.38{ a bushel; oats were 1} cents to 2}
cents lower with March at $1.43{ a bushel; soybeans were a { cent
lower to 2{ cents higher with January at $5.69} a bushel.
   Soybean futures were buoyed by a slight rebound in cash prices
after farmer selling slowed from the pace set earlier in the week.
Soybean prices also were supported by expectations of increased
export sales.
   Wheat futures continued to show weakness due to the lack of
export business. Traders were disappointed that the Soviet Union
failed to enter the market Thursday for 500,000 metric tons of
winter or spring wheat as expected.
   A forecast of weekend rain and the National Weather Service's
latest six-to 10-day outlook that calls for rain in the Central
Plains also dragged down wheat prices, said analyst Joel Karlin of
Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   Corn futures traded in a narrow range, as traders marked time
before the release of the USDA reports after the close of trading.
   The USDA estimated the 1989 corn crop at 7.5 billion bushels,
which was below expectations.
   Soybean production was put at 1.9 billion bushels, also lower
than expected.
   The USDA reported farmers planted about 57 million acres of
winter wheat for harvest this year, up 3 percent from 1989.
   Winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the following
year. It accounts for about three-fourths of the total U.S. wheat
output. Meanwhile, U.S. wheat stockpiles have continued to shrink,
thus keeping market prices at high levels.
   Energy futures rebounded from losses suffered in early trading
to post a gain on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The gain was led by heating oil futures, which surged on
expectations of a return of cold weather in the Northeast, said
analyst Peter Beutel of Elders Futures Inc. in New York.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 9 cents lower to 24 cents
higher with February at $23.14 a barrel; heating oil was .33 cent
to 2.44 cents higher with February at 69.32 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .57 cent to 1.17 cents higher with February
at 65.50 cents a gallon.
   Despite being pressured by profit-taking, gold prices closed
higher on New York's Commodity Exchange. Silver suffered a slight
loss.
   Pressure on gold came from a relatively firm dollar and gains on
the New York Stock Exchange, said Jim Steel, an analyst with Refco
Inc. in New York.
   The overnight gold bullion market was firm, although gold came
under pressure from the rally on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Steel
said.
   Gold was $1.40 to $1.60 higher with February at $415.60 a troy
ounce. Silver was 2 cents to 3 cents lower with March at $5.365 a
troy ounce.
   Livestock and pork futures were higher in light trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle prices were up sharply due to computer-generated trading.
Further gains were checked by declining demand for beef and lower
cash prices.
   Hog futures were supported by steady prices in the cash market,
and frozen pork belly prices were boosted by commercial and
commission house buying.
   Live cattle were .22 cent to .65 cent higher with February at
77.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .27 cent
higher with January at 84.37 cents a pound; hogs were .08 cent
lower to .33 cent higher with February at 51.27 a pound; frozen
pork bellies were 1.12 cents to 1.60 cents higher with February at
57.47 cents a pound.

   The dollar ended slightly lower Thursday after a
session in which dealers focused mainly on cross rates between
foreign currencies rather than the U.S. currency.
   Gold prices rose modestly, with bullion for current delivery
gaining $1.60 an ounce to $414 on the New York Commodity Exchange.
Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid price of
$413.60, up $2.35.
   ``It's essentially been a cross market,'' said Robert White,
manager of corporate trading at First Interstate Bank in Los
Angeles. ``It isn't so much the dollar. It's the yen against the
market. It's the market against the Swiss.''
   Swiss National Bank President Markus Lusser said Thursday that
Swiss interest rates might remain above rates in West Germany for
some time to prevent the Swiss franc from weakening further against
the German mark.
   Higher interest rates would make the currency more attractive
for investors to hold, and Lusser's comment drove the franc sharply
higher.
   ``The market is just a bundle of nerves'' because there is no
clear trend for the dollar, White said.
   Dealers are watching political developments in Eastern Europe
closely for signs of instability, which might lead investors to
rush into dollars as a safe haven, he said.
   Traders also are keeping a keen eye on U.S. interest rates for
any sign of credit easing by the Federal Reserve, which would tend
to make the dollar less attractive, he said.
   At the start of the day in Tokyo, the dollar slipped 0.03
Japanese yen to 145.27. The dollar eased further in London to
145.25 yen before closing in New York at 145.45 yen, down from
145.55 late Wednesday.
   Later dollar rates in New York compared with Wednesday included:
1.6795 West German marks, down from 1.6825 marks; 1.5065 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5165; 5.7215 French francs, down from 5.7265;
1,253.75 Italian lire, down from 1,257.25; 1.1562 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.1585.
   The dollar rose slightly against sterling. The British pound
fell to $1.6597 late in New York, down from $1.6625. In London
earlier, the pound fell to $1.6575 from $1.6625.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Wednesday: 1.6800
marks, up from 1.6795; 1.5210 Swiss francs, up from 1.5120; 5.7325
French francs, up from 5.7145; 1.9021 Dutch guilders, up from
1.8815; 1,258.50 Italian lire, up from 1,255.00; and 1.1575
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1585.
   Gold also rose in London to a late bid price of $412.25 an ounce
from $408.55 late Wednesday. In Zurich, gold rose to $412.75 from
$409.25.
   In Hong Kong earlier, gold jumped $6.10 to $411.75 an ounce.
   Silver for current delivery closed unchanged at $5.306 an ounce
on New York's Comex after gaining four cents earlier in London to
$5.34.

<TEXT>
   A majority of American workers are doing what
they do for such reasons as simple chance or lack of choice, while
just 41 percent hold jobs that they had planned, according to a
poll released Thursday.
   The results indicate ``that many people are trapped at less than
they could do,'' said Sharon Danann, research director at a
Cleveland-based group called 9 to 5, National Association of
Working Women.
   The survey of 1,350 people was conducted last October by the
Gallup Organization for the National Occupational Information
Coordinating Committee, a panel Congress created to make better use
of job information. The poll, which asked a variety of job-related
questions, had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage
points.
   Other findings showed that about half of Americans say job
stress affects their health, personal relationships or their
ability to do their job; nearly one-third of the work force expects
to change jobs within the next three years; and that 65 percent
said that given a chance to start over, they would try to get more
information about career options.
   While 41 percent of the employed respondents consciously chose
their job or career, 18 percent got started in their present job
through chance circumstances, 12 percent took the only job
available and the rest were either influenced by friends or
relatives.
   ``There's a real dilemma. The labor market isn't matching up
well with what people are trained to do and what they want to do,''
said Jim Green, a labor historian at the University of
Massachusetts. He said the results may indicate that many people
view their jobs as ``necessary evils.''
   Green and Ms. Danann said part of the reason people are in jobs
they never planned is because most new jobs being created are in
the service industry.
   Juliette Lester, executive director of the committee that had
the poll conducted, said those results demonstrate the need for
government and job counselors to improve the way they educate the
public about career options.
   ``The people who are most in need are not getting it,'' she
said, noting that only 21 percent of those without a high school
degree had planned their jobs and 25 percent of that group had
taken the only jobs they could find.
   In a separate finding, 25 percent of employed adults who
responded said job stress or pressure had interfered with their
off-the-job relationships, 20 percent said it had affected their
physical health and 20 percent said it had affected their ability
to do their job.
   But responding to the same question, 48 percent reported little
or no job stress over the past year. The totals exceeded 100
percent because of multiple responses.
   Ms. Danann said more Americans probably suffer from job-related
stress than admit it.
   ``There's lots of people who probably don't realize that's what
it is, that their job is full of interruptions, or that they have
multiple bosses telling them it's priority work, and that it's
driving them nuts,'' she said.
   The poll also showed that 40 percent said higher pay would give
them an incentive to accomplish more at work while 31 percent cited
more recognition. Other incentives included additional training,
chance for advancement and more control over their job.
   In another finding, 68 percent said there was no discrimination
in the workplace, 5 percent said minorities are discriminated
against but not women and 5 percent said women are discriminated
against but not minorities. Ten percent think both groups are
treated unfairly while 6 percent said women and minorities are
treated better.

<HEAD>Delta Says It Will Ban Smoking on All North American Flights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delta Air Lines announced Thursday that it will
extend a new smoking ban, scheduled to begin Feb. 25 on flights of
six hours or less within the United States, to cover all its
service in North America.
   Smoking will be allowed only on Delta's Europe and Asia flights.
   ``In expanding the smoking ban, we continue to respond to the
wishes of our passengers,'' said Whit Hawkins, Delta's senior vice
president for marketing. ``Over the years we have seen a dramatic
decrease in the demand for designated smoking seats on our flights.
At the same time, the two-hour smoking ban begun in 1988 has been
very well received by our passengers.''
   Hawkins said more than 70 percent of Delta's flights were
affected by the ban covering flights of two hours or less. On the
flights where smoking was permitted, only about 20 percent of the
seats were designated for smoking, a decrease from 30 percent to 40
percent five years ago, he said.
   The latest ban will be effective on all flights within the
United States, which includes Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico, as
well as flights to the Bahamas, Bermuda, Canada and Mexico.

<TEXT>
   An independent Soviet newspaper that has
chronicled the recent wave of reforms in Eastern Europe has become
an advertising vehicle for several U.S. companies intrigued by the
potential sales territory.
   Advertising space in Atmoda: the Journal of Perestroika, is
being sold in Minneapolis by John Freivalds, who also is a foreign
language business consultant.
   Freivalds, a Latvian native who now is a U.S. citizen, opened
the downtown sales office after traveling back to his home country
in May to obtain permission from the Latvian National Front, the
two-year-old political party that publishes Atmoda.
   Atmoda, Latvian for ``awakening,'' is a weekly newspaper that
promises access to Latvian decision-makers getting their first
taste of economic freedom.
   ``The Soviet Union is changing,'' Freivalds tells potential
clients. ``The Communists are not going to have the power they once
had. You have to reach the new decision-makers. The new
decision-makers read this (Atmoda). The society is still in flux,
but given the ad rates, this is an inexpensive way to test the
waters for your product or service.''
   The newspaper's first U.S. ads ran during October. So far, five
U.S. advertisers have run 20 ads totaling five pages. A total of
seven advertisers have bought an additional 20 ads that will begin
running next month, Freivalds said.
   He says he's lost about $30,000 on the venture, but plans to
give the project two years before determining whether to continue.
   The 18-month-old Atmoda has a circulation of up to 100,000 for
its Latvian edition and is distributed throughout the Soviet Union.
Its estimated readership is 1.5 million, meaning that each copy is
read by 15 people.
   The $600 cost of a full-page ad in Atmoda is the equivalent of
three months' salary for the average Latvian. But it's roughly
one-tenth of what U.S. newspapers with comparable circulation
charge, said Andrea Luhtanen, vice president of the Haworth Group,
a Minneapolis media services company.
   Freivalds said Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
restructuring program is giving the most latitude to the Baltics _
Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia _ which once thrived as capitalistic
markets.
   ``I've always thought that perestroika was invented by Gorbachev
for the Baltic states, because they can remember what capitalism
was like; they are closest to taking advantage of it,'' he said.
   The most successful U.S. companies in Latvia probably will be
sellers of industrial products that can stimulate fundamental
economic development. For example, Garden Way Inc., of Albany,
N.Y., has sold 31 small tractors in Latvia at $3,000 each,
Freivalds said. The company's agent has advertised in Atmoda since
the fall, he said.
   Low-priced consumer goods also are in demand, said Freivalds.
Event Sales, a Minneapolis company that sells surplus consumer
goods, recently signed an Atmoda advertising contract, he said.
   But Freivalds said he's approaching corporate giants about
advertising their products in the Soviet Union.
   ``That level of sophistication is not going to happen for 10
years, at least,'' he said.

<HEAD>M2 Money Supply Falls; M3 Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The broadest measure of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Jan. 1, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M3 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $4,046.4 billion from $4,044.4 billion the previous week.
   A narrower measure, M2, fell to a seasonally adjusted $3,221.4
billion from $3,227.3 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $805.2 billion from $802.3 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 4.5 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 is 3.3 percent, which is below the
Fed's target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,196.0 billion, a 7.6
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,026.8 billion, up 2.9 percent, while M1
rose 6.7 percent to an average of $791.8 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $137 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$504 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $295.7 billion in the two-week period ended
Jan. 10, down from $299.2 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>FTC Files False Advertising Complaint Against Diet Pills</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission said Thursday it
had filed a false advertising claim against the maker and
advertiser of ``Fat-Magnet'' diet pills, touted in ads as capable
of clinging to fat before it shows.
   The commission, seeking about $5 million in consumer redress,
contends the national advertisements falsely claim the pills
contribute to weight loss and wrongly state the product is ``100
percent safe.''
   The pills, which cost $20 for a bottle of 90, could be harmful
for some people, possibly causing diarrhea or stomach cramps, said
Marcy J.K. Tiffany, director of the commission's Los Angeles office.
   The ``Fat-Magnet'' pills were advertised in such publications as
the National Enquirer, Cosmopolitan and Woman's Day. The product
was available only by mail or telephone order.
   After the commission filed a complaint Tuesday, a federal judge
issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the pills'
manufacture by Allied International Corp. and the product's
advertising by Linder Ad-Vantage. The firms' assets also were
frozen.
   The companies, based in Oxnard, have unlisted telephone numbers
and officials could not be reached for comment.

   Fannie Mae said Thursday its earnings soared
55 percent in the fourth quarter, an improvement it said was
spurred by lower interest rates that produced a strong market for
fixed-rate mortgages.
   Fannie Mae, formally known as the Federal National Mortgage
Association, is a congressionally chartered but shareholder-owned
company which provides money for home buyers by purchasing
mortgages from lenders and packaging them into securities for sale
to investors.
   For the October-December quarter of last year, net income
totaled $237 million, or 90 cents a share, up from $153 million, 63
cents a share, a year earlier.
   For all of 1989, Fannie Mae earned $807 million, $3.10 a share,
a 59 percent increase over 1988 when earnings were $507 million, or
$2.11 a share.
   Fannie Mae President Roger Birk said that lower interest rates,
and a decline in mortgage foreclosures and related losses boosted
the company's performance.

<HEAD>Julien Co. Cotton Merchant Seeks Bankruptcy Protection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WOODY BAIRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Julien Co., one of the world's largest
cotton merchants, filed for bankruptcy court protection from
creditors Thursday, one day after three major creditors urged the
court to intervene.
   The private company, founded and run by Julien Hohenberg of
Memphis, estimated its debts at $344 million and assets at $160
million in filing for protection under Chapter 11 of federal
bankruptcy law.
   The company's problems apparently stem from speculation in
cotton futures during the summer, analysts say.
   The filing came one day after three major creditors petitioned
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Memphis to put Julien into bankruptcy
and appoint a trustee to run it.
   Bankers Trust Co., one of the creditors, renewed its request for
a trustee Thursday.
   ``The Julien Co. does not have the management or the assets to
run the company,'' said Bob Orians, a lawyer for the bank. Bankers
Trust has $172 million in secured loans outstanding to Julien, he
said.
   Judge William H. Brown set a hearing for Tuesday to consider the
motion.
   During a break in court proceedings, Hohenberg refused to
discuss his financial troubles or comment on reports that he
recently lost millions of dollars on the futures market.
   His financial troubles became public last month when PaineWebber
Inc. filed suit claiming Julien Co. failed by some $2.3 million to
meet margin calls on cotton futures.
   Cotton analysts say Hohenberg may have run into trouble by
buying futures heavily in the summer and fall expecting prices to
rise. Cotton prices have fallen instead, with cutbacks in purchases
by textile mills and a large domestic crop this year apparently
contributing to the decline.
   Orians said Bankers Trust has paid the company's payroll for the
past month. He told the court that the company has come close in
recent weeks to having utilities turned off at its headquarters.
   Edward L. Montedonico, Julien Co.'s lawyer, said the company is
likely to have more than 600 creditors. The company does business
with numerous banks, farmers, textile mills, warehouses and
shippers around the country and abroad.
   Montedonico said $19 million of the company's debts are
unsecured. Most of the secured debts are covered by cotton stored
in warehouses or in various stages of shipment around the country,
he said.
   The judge directed Montedonico to notify creditors holding
Julien Co. assets not to sell them to cover the merchant's debts.
   ``We've got to stop the flow of any assets ... until we get a
handle on it,'' the judge said.
   Orians said the cotton securing Bankers Trust's loans may be
sitting in hundreds of warehouses.
   ``We're in the process of determining where all this collateral
is,'' he said.

<HEAD>Broker Barred From Securities Industry for Waldbaum Insider
Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Convicted stockbroker Robert Chestman agreed
Thursday to be barred permanently from the securities industry,
settling civil insider trading charges concerning A&amp;P's acquisition
of Waldbaum supermarkets.
   Chestman consented, without admitting or denying wrongdoing, to
a court order permanently barring him from the securities industry
to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission action.
   Chestman is currently serving a two-year prison sentence for his
March 14 conviction in Manhattan federal court on mail fraud,
perjury and securities law violations.
   His conviction is under appeal before the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals, said Chestman lawyer Elkan Abramowitz.
   The SEC and federal prosecutors accused Chestman of trading
Waldbaum Inc. stock for himself and clients with illegal inside
information about a pending tender offer from the Great Atlantic &amp;
Pacific Tea Co.
   The government alleged that a member of the Waldbaum family,
Keith Loeb, tipped off Chestman to the pending bid before A&amp;P
announced a tender offer of $50 per share for Waldbaum stock
outstanding.
   According to the SEC complaint, filed in New York in October
1987, Chestman netted $235,125 after buying 11,000 shares of
Waldbaum stock for himself, Loeb and other clients at prices
ranging between $24.37{ and $26 per share.
   In addition to the prison sentence, U.S. District Judge John
Walker Jr. fined Chestman an amount equal to the illegal profits he
made for himself and others.
   As part of the civil settlement, the SEC agreed that Chestman's
fine would satisfy the disgorgement sought by the agency.

   Campeau Corp. painted a gloomy sales picture
Thursday for the next two years at its retailing businesses, in
documents that also disclosed that a total liquidation of its
stores might not be enough to pay off its debts.
   The Canadian corporation, which amassed huge debts in acquiring
Allied Stores Corp. and Federated Department Stores Inc., disclosed
its best and worse-case scenarios for the next five years in a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   In the document released Thursday, Campeau projected that Allied
and Federated earnings could fall by up to 6.4 percent in the 1990
fiscal year.
   The documents also indicated that even if Federated and Allied
were completely liquidated, the sale proceeds still might not be
enough to help pay the companies' combined total debts of some $8
billion.
   Both retail units face a Monday deadline to renegotiate a $2.34
billion loan from a syndicate headed by Citibank.
   On Wednesday, Campeau surprised Wall Street and Seventh Avenue
by paying $100 million on schedule to numerous merchandise
suppliers.
   On Thursday, Campeau's board effectively turned over control of
the company's U.S. operations to outside hands.
   The board said in a statement it approved the transfer of
control of the U.S. division, Campeau (U.S.), to trustees. It also
recommended that the division appoint its own chairman and chief
executive officer and its own board of directors, which would be
composed of independent, U.S. residents.
   Campeau's chairman, Robert Campeau, said in the statement he
only would remain involved in the company's real estate operations
under the reorganization.
   In its filing, Campeau projected earnings for Allied and
Federated would fall as much as 6.4 percent in fiscal year 1990 _
due to ``management distraction, limitations on the company's
ability to negotiate better prices with vendors and increased
promotions needed to stimulate business.'' _ before recovering in
1991.
   The corporation projected that it would return to a normal
operating environment by the beginning of fiscal year 1992.
   Campeau projected Federated would have operating earnings of
$483 million on sales of $4.92 billion for fiscal 1989 and Allied
would have operating earnings of $273 million on sales of $2.74
billion.
   Campeau also stated that its projections had not been updated
since it opened talks on Dec. 13 with major creditors about
possible financial restructurings.
   The documents also stressed that the unusual operating problems
facing the company made the projections highly uncertain.
   Another set of projections assumed that Allied and Federated
might have to operate under increased restrictions imposed by
suppliers and factors, which in turn could ``significantly impair
their ability to obtain inventory.''
   Inventory could be off by as much as $400 million retail
compared to the projection for fiscal year 1990.
   There was no mention in the documents of seeking U.S. Bankruptcy
Code protection from creditors. However, the document noted:
``There can be no assurance that restructurings can be completed on
satisfactory terms, within a satisfactory time frame, if at all.''
   Campeau's problems stem chiefly from the debt it acquired when
it bought Federated in 1988 for $6.6 billion and Allied two years
earlier for $3.4 billion.
   Part of the restructuring plan it already has mapped out
involves selling Federated's Bloomingdale's department store chain,
considered one of Campeau's most valuable possessions.
   Federated's other chains include Abraham and Straus, Burdines,
Lazarus and Rich's. Allied operates the Bon Marche, Jordan Marsh,
Maas Brothers and Stern's chains.
   The SEC document projected an after-tax price of between $3.40
billion and $3.70 billion if all of Federated's divisions were sold
individually under the best circumstances. The price would fall to
$2.55 billion to $2.70 billion the divisions were sold under
``distressed'' circumstances, such as in a bankruptcy
reorganization.
   A fire sale of Allied's divisions would net between $1.2 billion
and $1.35 billion, Campeau projected, compared to $1.60 billion and
$1.80 billion in an ``orderly process.''
   According to the documents, Federated has a total debt and
accrued interest of $5.19 billion and Allied's debt with interest
of $2.99 billion.
   The documents projected an after-tax liquidation deficit of
between $1.68 billion and $835 million for Federated and $1.79
billion and $1.39 billion for Allied, depending upon the
circumstances of a sell-off.
   Allied alone is expected to pay $113 million in debt service
next year, $106 million in 1991, $379 million in 1992, $6 million
in 1993 and $4 million in 1994 _ assuming refinancing.

   The Food and Drug Administration's ban on use
of the Jarvik artificial heart could slow research in the field but
probably won't affect patients needing temporary implants, medical
experts said Thursday.
   But a major user of the device said he might defy the ban.
   The FDA, in a letter sent earlier this week and disclosed
Wednesday, withdrew Symbion Inc.'s approval for continued
investigational uses of its artificial heart, both as a permanent
replacement and a temporary bridge for patients awaiting a human
heart transplant.
   ``By removing the Jarvik, you take the first and main artificial
heart player out of the ballgame,'' said Dr. Jack Kolff, a
professor of cardiac surgery at Temple University in Philadelphia
whose father, Dr. Willem Kolff, developed the first artificial
kidney in 1943.
   ``That leaves a bit of a vacuum for those researchers who think
there may be a future for an artificial heart,'' he said.
   Dr. Antonio Gotto, chief of internal medical services at Baylor
College of Medicine in Houston and past president of the American
Heart Association, said that because of the availability of
alternative, temporary heart-assist devices the FDA's action
probably won't have an impact on heart patients.
   ``But it does represent a setback in terms of time toward
eventually getting a completely implantable heart,'' he said.
   The Jarvik heart, named after its inventor, Dr. Robert Jarvik of
Utah, gained household recognition after it was implanted in Barney
Clark on Dec. 2, 1982. He lived 112 days, his new heart tethered to
a bulky external power system, before he succumbed to multiple
organ failure.
   Clark was the first to person to receive a permanent artificial
heart. Several others since Clark received the artificial heart,
but recipients have been plagued by blood clotting and strokes.
   In Tucson, Ariz., Dr. Jack Copeland, head of the heart
transplant program at the University of Arizona, said the ban means
he and his staff could be faced with the decision of ``putting a
device in anyway,'' either an artificial heart or related heart
pumping helper, in a critically ill patient.
   ``And I think our decision right now would be to go ahead and
use the device. ... we have good data, good statistics, we;re happy
with the way the devices have worked, we think we can save lives,''
Copeland told a news conference at which he presented transplant
candidate Paul Sicola, 48, of Old Bridge, N.J., who has been kept
alive for 119 days with a ventricular assist decive.
   Sicola said he would advise FDA to ``leave the system alone.''
   Copeland stirred controversy once before, using a different
artificial heart without approval to keep a patient alive for 11
hours while he awaited a transplant. His team has used Symbion
hearts in seven patients and assistance devices in 14.
   The FDA said that during two inspections of the Tempe,
Ariz.-based company's facilities last year, it had found ``some
serious deficiencies'' in manufacturing quality control, monitoring
of research sites, servicing of equipment, training of personnel
and reporting of adverse reactions to FDA.
   ``The agency felt the deficiencies were great enough that risks
to patients were outweighing benefits,'' said FDA spokesman Jeff
Nesbit.
   He said the letter was sent Monday.
   Symbion issued a statement saying it had received the FDA notice
and would ``release further information at the appropriate time.''
   Dr. Donald Olsen, director of the University of Utah's Institute
for Biomedical Engineering, said he was ``surprised and
disappointed'' by the FDA's action and hoped it would not hurt
future federal funding of artificial heart research in general,
particularly for totally implantable devices.
   The permanent Jarvik heart consists of a fist-size pump that is
implanted into the chest and which is attached to two plastic tubes
connected to a large compressed-air power system contained in a
large cart that must move with the patient.
   Withdrawal of the permanent Jarvik heart leaves only one other
natural-heart replacement with FDA investigational approval, but
that device is used only as a temporary bridge and only at Hershey
Medical Center of Pennsylvania State University.
   In recent years, the Jarvik has functioned mainly as a temporary
bridge in patients awaiting transplants. Alternatives to the Jarvik
are available because other companies have approvals for such
temporary implants and for left ventricular assist pumps that help
the natural heart work without replacement.
   Copeland said Symbion hearts have been used in 155 patients, and
pumping assistance devices in 55.
   Dr. Thomas Preston, chief of cardiology at Pacific Medical
Center in Seattle and a vocal critic of permanent artificial
hearts, said the Jarvik venture has been a failure.
   ``They've set the whole program back with premature useage of
the permanent artificial heart,'' he said. ``Now the whole
(artificial heart) program has a bad name because the thing didn't
work.''
   ``It's another sad instance of people in the medical profession
rushing in for fame and glory and riches with great acclaim from
the media and then disillusionment,'' he said.
   However, Preston said he hopes work continues on the technology
``because some day it's going to be better.''

   Florida's orange harvest will plunge by 29
percent this year due to damage from the Christmas weekend freeze,
yielding the smallest crop in 25 years, the Department of
Agriculture estimated Thursday.

declaration for more counties once citrus and sugarcane salavage
operations are complete.

24-26 freeze that iced fruit throughout the 700,000-acre citrus
belt _ also projected a 13 percent drop in the grapefruit crop from
earlier production estimates.
   The report is the first official estimate of damage to the
citrus crop, worth $1.4 billion last season.
   ``This is the lowest estimated production since 1964-65,'' said
Robert R. Terry, a USDA official who specializes in Florida citrus.
   Some industry officials have estimated losses at farm level at
between $100 million and $200 million. Loss of added value from
harvesting and processing are expected to be at least another $150
million.
   But the full extent of the financial damage cannot be calculated
for months, until a full assessment is made of damage to trees.
   USDA analysts predicted 92 million 90-pound boxes of oranges
would be harvested during the 1989-90 crop year. This compares with
the 130 million boxes of oranges forecast in early December for the
current season. The orange harvest in the 1988-89 season was 146
million boxes.
   The analysts are projecting a Florida grapefruit crop of 38
million boxes for this year, compared with the pre-freeze forecast
of 44 million boxes. The 1988-89 grapefruit harvest was almost 55
million boxes.
   The USDA also estimated that Florida processors would pack 1.30
gallons of frozen concentrated orange juice from each box of
oranges, a drop in the pre-freeze estimate of a 1.48-gallon juice
``yield.''
   ``It's a pretty substantial overall loss, almost equal
percentage wise to the 1983-84 season,'' said Terry.
   He said the December freeze ``could be considered one of the
worst freezes of the century.''
   Successive crop forecasts in the coming months are expected to
be even lower as possible damage to trees is assessed. The final
verdict on crop losses and tree damage will probably not be known
until the end of the harvesting season, industry officials said.
   ``The juice will be just as good, but we're expecting a whole
lot less of it,'' said John Smoak, president of Smoak Groves in
Lake Placid. ``We were just getting back on our feet since the last
two freezes.''
   Temperatures dropped and stayed in the mid-teens and low 20s
across the citrus belt during the two-day freeze last month. When
ice forms in oranges, tiny cells burst and the juice dissipates. As
the weather warms again, the fruit begins to dry up.
   Much of the fruit can be salvaged and processed into juice, and
processing plants are operating around-the-clock as harvesters rush
to get as much of the fruit off the trees as possible before it
spoils.
   Don Farmer, assistant executive director of the Florida
Department of Citrus, expressed concern about the Valencia crop, a
prized variety which is not ripe enough to be harvested but is
expected to show heavy damage from the freeze.
   ``There was obvious damage to this crop,'' said Farmer, who
grows Valencias. ``Some of those won't be picked at all. They're on
the ground.''

<HEAD>UAL Chairman Asks Employees To Support Buyout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The chairman of UAL Corp. warned employees of
the airline company in a letter that a recapitalization under study
by the board of directors could hurt the company and urged
employees instead to support a buyout.
   ``It is time to decide whether we want to take control of our
destiny and therein buy a majority of United Airlines or allow
events to transpire as they may, and hope for the best,'' Wolf
wrote, according to The New York Times.
   The Times said the letter was dated Tuesday and released
Thursday.
   On Monday, UAL's board said it asked its financial advisers to
study a recapitalization. Under such a plan, Chicago-based UAL
would borrow money in order to buy back some of its shares.
Recapitalizations also sometimes involve a special dividend to
shareholders.
   The board's action was prompted by Coniston Partners, a New York
investment group that holds 11.8 percent of UAL stock. Coniston had
presented the board with a Monday deadline to negotiate a buyout or
take other action to raise the company's stock price.
   The board, in a statement, also said it was still interested in
a buyout proposal. Such a proposal from management and United's
pilots union collapsed last year after it failed to obtain funding.
   The Times, quoting unidentified sources, reported that
representatives of UAL's management and the airline's pilots and
flight attendants unions met in New York on Thursday.
   Wolf met on Wednesday with representatives of the company's
19,000 salaried employees to discuss options faced by the company.
   In his letter to United's 70,000 employees, Wolf said that
unless a buyout bid is devised, the board would put through a
recapitalization, or a new board installed by Coniston would take
the same step, the Times said.
   ``Do you want to allow the Coniston Partners to cripple United
financially, or do you collectively want to pay for and buy a
majority of the company?'' he wrote.
   Wolf said United would not be able to pay for the $19 billion in
aircraft it has on order if the company funds a stock buyback.
