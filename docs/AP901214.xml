   President Bush on Friday prodded Saddam
Hussein to agree to talks on the Persian Gulf crisis by Jan. 3 and
said he may ask Congress to authorize an attack against Iraq unless
Saddam pulls out of Kuwait by Jan. 15.
   Bush said he had offered Iraq a choice of 15 dates in the next
three weeks for high-level talks. ``He ought to take one of them,''
Bush declared at a news conference.
   For the first time, Bush said he was considering asking Congress
for approval for a military strike against Iraq unless Saddam's
army is withdrawn by the Jan. 15 deadline set by the United
Nations.
   Meanwhile, CIA Director William Webster said U.S. analysts have
concluded that Saddam will not leave Kuwait until convinced ``he is
in peril of imminent military attack,'' according to a report of an
interview with Webester.
   Bush said ``I think it would send a very strong, clear signal to
the world'' if Congress endorsed his Persian Gulf policy or the
U.N. resolution authorizing force against Iraq.
   ``I want a peaceful solution to this crisis but I will not be a
party to circumventing or diluting the United Nations' deadline,''
Bush said.
   As Bush turned up the heat on Iraq, there was a hero's welcome
for Ambassador Nathaniel Howell, who led a four-month holdout of
American diplomats at the besieged U.S. Embassy compound in Kuwait
City.
   ``Welcome home and thanks for a job well done,'' Secretary of
State James A. Baker III told Howell at Andrews Air Force Base
outside Washington as the ambassador stepped off a plane with about
50 American and foreign hostages he led from Iraq and Kuwait. ``As
you were freed, now too we must see Kuwait freed of Iraqi
occupation,'' Baker declared.
   The group was welcomed by a crowd of cheering friends and family
members waving flags and bearing balloons.
   U.S. insistence on manning the embassy - until all Americans who
wanted to leave Kuwait were given that chance - had dramatized U.S.
refusal to recognize Iraq's claim of sovereignty over Kuwait.
   Bush met with reporters on the South Lawn moments before
boarding a helicopter to fly to Camp David for a weekend with his
family.
   Webster, interviewed by reporters and editors of The Washington
Post, was quoted as saying Saddam's army has 1,000 tons of lethal
chemicals, ``much of it loaded ... in almost every type of
weapon,'' including some in Kuwait. A report of the interview
appeared in Saturday editions of the newspaper.
   Saddam may not know what his own decision will be and he will be
more likely to fight `if he thought our end goal was his
destruction,'' Webster said.
   The White House indicated it was ready to pounce if Iraq and the
United States failed to agree on a date for gulf talks. ``It gives
us a very strong propaganda point - that he's (Saddam) not willing
to even consider discussions that might lead to a peaceful
resolution,'' presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Two weeks ago, Bush had said Baker could go to Baghdad anytime
up to Jan. 15, but he acknowledged that he has backed away from
that.
   ``I wish I'd been a little more explicit in my first
announcement about what I meant about mutually convenient dates,''
the president said.
   Iraq proposed that Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz come to the
United States next Monday and that Baker go to Baghdad on Jan. 12.
   But Bush said the date proposed by Baghdad wouldn't leave time
for Iraqi forces to leave Kuwait by the deadline set by the U.N.
   ``That deadline is real,'' Bush said, adding that Iraqi forces
must be ``totally out, totally out'' by then.
   The administration says the purpose of the prospective trip to
Baghdad by Baker is not to negotiate a settlement, but to issue a
face-to-face demand that Saddam withdraw his troops.
   ``It simply is not credible that he cannot over a two week
period make a couple of hours available for the secretary of state
on an issue of this importance, unless of course he is seeking to
circumvent the United Nations deadline,'' the president said.
   Bush added, ``We've offered 15 days and he ought to get moving
and do something reasonable if he really wants to move the peace
effort.''
   He refused to say if he would bend on his insistence that
Baker's trip must occur by Jan. 3.
   ``I don't want to draw deadlines in the sand here, but there
would have to be some compelling reason for me to change it,'' Bush
said.
   Two Republican senators - Richard Lugar of Indiana and John
McCain of Arizona - met with Bush and said afterward that he was
prepared to call off the meetings with Iraq because of the impasse
over dates. However, Fitzwater disputed their account.
   On Capitol Hill, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Colin Powell
said the Pentagon can keep its forces deployed in the gulf region
``as long as the president wants them deployed.''
   Both Powell and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said that
continuation of the military effort could require the callup of
additional U.S. reserve units, and Powell suggested that the force
could shrink if needed for long-term sustainability.
   Cheney also said the administration hopes that Congress will
give it a vote of confidence early next year on the objectives of
the deployment - getting Iraq out of Kuwait and restoring its
government. But he added: ``I can't think of anything more damaging
... than an indication from Congress that they are not supportive
of the president's policies.''
   Meanwhile, other military officials said the Pentagon is sending
more doctors, blood supplies and field hospitals to the Persian
Gulf to handle American and allied casualties that could occur in a
land war against Iraq.
   Navy officials said that up to 8,000 more reservists will be
ordered to active duty to support the expansion of combat medical
care in and around Saudi Arabia, though the total numbers of
hospitals, beds, medical people and supplies for Operation Desert
Shield are kept secret.
   On the financial markets, meanwhile, traders said the continued
stalemate of U.S.-Iraqi talks drove oil prices up in trading
Friday.
   In a new sampling of public opinion, Americans surveyed for a
New York Times-CBS News poll were almost evenly divided on whether
the United States should begin military action against Iraq if
Saddam does not withdraw from Kuwait by Jan. 15.
   In the telephone poll of 1,044 adults, conducted Sunday through
Tuesday, 48 percent said the United States should wait longer to
see if economic sanctions work, 45 percent said military action
should be started, and the rest either didn't know or didn't
answer.

   One year after the U.S. military
invasion of Panama, the Army has revised downward its estimate of
the dead, based on Panamanian government statistics, the Southern
Command said Friday.
   It said in a news release that figures from the Panamanian
Institute of Legal Medicine show a maximum of 345 soldiers and
civilians may have died in the Dec. 21, 1989 invasion to oust Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Positive identifications were made of 270 dead and 75 additional
bodies are missing.
   At the time of the invasion, the Army calculated 314 military
and 202 civilian deaths, the release said.
   The opposition to President Guillermo Endara's government says
thousands died, but the Southern Command said, ``The allegations
have turned out to be without foundation.''
   The Panamanian Human Rights Committee estimated 295 to 385 died.
   The Army said 65 bodies were identified as military personnel,
155 as civilians, and 50 not classified.
   ``It is impossible to determine exactly how many have died as a
direct consequence of the military action or to attribute specific
causes to each of the deaths,'' it said.
   Many died in a huge fire; some died during looting, murders, in
traffic accidents and from natural causes during the invasion, it
added.
   All are included in the new estimate.
   The Army said it investigated 14 of 24 complaints it received
about serious misconduct of soldiers. It said it threw out nine
complaints as not meriting investigation, and has one case pending.
   The Southern Command said 11 of the complaints investigated were
forwarded through legal channels and three were found to be without
basis.

<TEXT>
   A U.S.-armed guerrilla organization has
reached tentative agreement with the Soviet-backed government of
Angola on a plan to end 15 years of civil war, rebel leader Jonas
Savimbi said Friday.
   At a lengthy session Thursday under the auspices of the United
States, Soviet Union and Portugal, the warring sides agreed to set
a date for free elections and then immediately sign a cease-fire,
Savimbi told reporters.
   The breakthrough in the tortuous peace efforts followed a flurry
of meetings here this week, including an unprecedented session
between Savimbi and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
Savimbi, who until now had been vilified by the Kremlin as an
anti-Communist menace, also met with President Bush Thursday.
   In Lisbon, Angolan Foreign Minister Pedro de Castro van Dunem
said a cease fire could be signed next month. He spoke during a
stopover on his return tom Angola from a trip to Washington.
   Washington and Moscow have been pressing their allies in Angola
to stop the fighting, which has killed over 300,000 people and left
the mineral-rich country in ruin.
   The United States has shipped UNITA as much as $50 million in
weapons every year since 1986; the Soviets have given the Angolan
government as much as $800 million annually, U.S. officials say.
   Under the proposed agreement reached Thursday, both sides would
stop sending weapons once a cease-fire is signed, U.S. officials
said.
   Savimbi said that at Thursday's meeting, the highest-level
gathering between the sides, UNITA and the second-ranking official
in Angola's ruling party, Lopo do Nascimento, had agreed on five
points.
   Among them is agreement that signing of a cease-fire should be
preceded by setting a date for free elections; a cease-fire should
be guaranteed by international observers; and outside military
assistance will stop once a cease-fire agreement is signed.
   The other two points called for a democratic system of
government and international monitoring of elections.
   The sides agreed that international peace-keepers will be sent
to Angola under the banner of the United Nations, he said. Still to
be settled, he said, are differences over the nations who will take
part.
   Savimbi said all the participants except for the Angolan
government were ready to sign the five-point plan at Thursday's
session. The Angolan government official asked for more time to
confer with his superiors in Luanda, Savimbi said.
   But, he added, ``there is no question'' that the government will
agree in principle.
   The U.S., Soviet and Portuguese participants in the talks held a
news conference late Thursday saying ``significant progress'' was
made, but declined to elaborate at that time.
   But a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, on
Friday confirmed the gist of Savimbi's account of the meeting.
   ``UNITA is optimistic that the remaining differences between the
two parties can be successfully addressed and that signature of a
cease-fire will be possible during the sixth round of
negotiations,'' he said.
   The talks are scheduled next month in Portugal, the former
colonial ruler of Angola.
   If the Angolan government approves the five points and proposes
a date for elections, the sides can sign a cease-fire at the
January session, Savimbi said. Elections could be held within nine
months to a year from the cease-fire date, he added.
   ``If my party nominates me, I'll run'' for president, Savimbi
said.
   At the outset of the negotiations last year, the government
demanded that Savimbi go into exile. It later dropped that demand.
   Responding to military pressure from UNITA and to the democratic
changes sweeping Eastern Europe, the government also gradually
moved away from a state-controlled economy toward a market system.
Last week Angola's ruling party agreed to allow multiparty
democracy and free elections.

<HEAD>Cheney Orders Navy to Justify A-12 or Drop Attack Plane Project</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: ADDS one graf company comments</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has ordered the
Navy to justify the A-12 attack plane in three weeks or else kill
it because of intolerable problems, the Pentagon announced Friday
night.
   ``If we cannot spend the taxpayers' money wisely, we will not
spend it,'' Cheney said in a directive to Navy Secretary Lawrence
Garrett.
   The secretary gave the Navy until Jan 4 to justify the plane.
The announcement said a special team would meet with the
contractors, General Dynamics Corp. and McDonnell Douglas Corp.,
both based in St. Louis, to review the situation.
   ``The A-12 program is in serious trouble. The apparent schedule
slippage, cost growth and management deficiences in this program
are intolerable,'' Cheney said.
   The A-12 was supposed to replace the elderly A-6 as the Navy's
primary all-weather, carrier-borne attack plane starting in 1995.
The plane was to use radar-evading ``stealth'' techniques and carry
the nickname ``Avenger.''
   The Navy had planned purchase of 620 planes for an estimated $52
billion and deployment starting in 1995.
   But a $4.7 billion development program, supposed to deliver six
prototypes, is $1 billion over budget and 18 months behind
schedule. Garrett recently ordered the admiral heading the program
to retire and reassigned two other officers because the three
failed to pass news of problems up the chain of command.
   The Navy has begun a criminal investigation of excessive
payments to the contractors.
   Also, John A. Betti, the Pentagon's top procurement officer,
said Wednesday he would resign as undersecretary of defense for
acquisitions at the end of the year to avoid the bite of new ethics
laws that take effect Jan. 1. Officials said he had planned to
leave anyway, but the timing of his announcement was influenced by
news of the A-12's problems.
   The department's inspector general said Betti had failed to
report conclusions of his own staff that the A-12 was in trouble,
but had relied on assurances from the contractors and the Navy that
development would be completed under budget. The contractors, she
said, controlled the work of the government's inspectors.
   Garrett refused to block the promotion to rear admiral of one of
the officers, Capt. Lawrence S. Elberfeld.
   Garrett defended the current procurement system, but noted
people ``find it very hard to push bad news up to the top.''
   Large weapons purchases are not often cancelled, many analysts
have noted. Instead, Congress and the Pentagon tend to look for
ways to strech out production and buyj fewer models, a tactic that
frequently slows the production pace to inefficient rates and can
even raise total costs. If the A-12 is cancelled, it will be a
rarity for such a large program.
   Cheney was particularly upset at being sandbagged by bad news
with the A-12 because he had reassured Congress in April the plane
was doing well, five weeks before news of the cost overruns and
delays became known. At the time, Cheney announced a reduction in
planned purchases from more than 800 to 620.
   Few details of the A-12, or what has gone wrong with it, have
been released, but stealth technology is brand new and known to be
difficult. An official sketch of the A-12 shows a flying-wing
design like the new Air Force B-2 bomber, another stealth plane
that cost far more to develop than expected.
   Congress has committed funds to only 15 B-2s, and some estimates
have reached $800 million a copy.
   Stealth techology, much of it secret, is known to involve novel
shapes like the flying wing to deflect radar beams away rather than
reflect them back to the antenna, radar-absorbing materials on
exterior surfaces and non-metallic composites in the places
structure that won't reflect radar.
   The A-6, called the ``Intruder,'' first flew in 1960 and early
versions have long since been converted to tankers or other
special-purpose craft. The last 10 airplanes of the series are
being built by Grumman Corp. under a contract calling for final
delivery in September 1991.
   Still, almost all carriers carry the A-6. No other plane in the
Navy has the elaborate electronics that make possible attacks at
night and in storms combined with the huge munitions load - up to
18,000 pounds - of the A-6.
   Cheney's statement said that no matter what happens to the A-12,
``We will continue to need to develop a basic strike airplane for
our aircraft carrier force. The A-6, our current carrier strike
plane, is aging, and we must move ahead with an alternative that
incorporates the technological advances necessary to maintain U.S.
naval air superiority.''
   ``Older, slower and less maneuverable A-6 planes will be less
able to penetrate enemy defenses and conduct their attacks. Stealth
technology will be required if attack aircraft are to elude
advanced fighters and surface-to-air missiles in the future. The
U.S. needs to maintain the capability to project power through the
use of naval strike forces,'' Cheney said.
   A prominent congressional critic of the A-12, Rep. John Conyers,
D-Mich., chairman of the House Government Operations Committee,
said Friday night he welcomed Cheney's decision.
   But the A-12 is ``only the tip of the iceberg'' of the
Pentagon's procurement problems, Conyers said.
   A spokesman for Chris Schildz, a spokesman for General Dynamics,
said when asked for comment, ``Our representatives will be
available to meet with government officials anytime.'' Jim Reed,
spokesman for McDonnell Douglas, said the company was ``hopeful
that the current difficulties can be resolved quickly to everyone's
satisfaction. We feel that the A-12 program is very important for
the defense of our country as well as to McDonnell Douglas.''

<TEXT>
   When John A. Gambling took over his dad's radio
show, America still liked Ike. Elvis was waiting for his draft
notice. The Chicago White Sox were playing in the World Series.
   On Friday, John A. retired. Eisenhower is dead; Presley's
supposed to be dead; the White Sox may be coming back from the
dead. But John A.'s son, John R., becomes Gambling generation No. 3
to be host of the local morning radio show as it wraps up its 65th
year.
   ``You could always turn on the radio and find old John, young
John, or in-between John,'' says John A., who took over in 1959
from the show's founder (and his father), John B. Gambling.
   ``If people wake up and hear about problems - a strike, a war,
assassination, whatever - they turn us on and know the world hasn't
come to an end. Their world has some continuity.''
   Much like New York radio's first family. ``Rambling with
Gambling'' has been a Gotham fixture since the Roaring '20s,
outlasting a dozen mayors, 11 presidents, Billy Martin (five times)
and three wars.
   Their show is not typical Big Apple. In a city known for Ed
Koch's abrasiveness and George Steinbrenner's arrogance, the
Gamblings provide a quiet morning introduction to what's going on.
   ``I firmly believe that the last thing listeners want to hear in
this controlled mayhem is more noise, more confusion. There's
enough of that in their own kitchens,'' says John A., 60, in
explaining his theory of broadcasting.
   The Gambling family introduction into the radio business offered
no indication of the dynasty to come.
   John B. Gambling was an engineer at WOR-AM in 1925 when he
subbed for the regular announcer on a morning calisthenics show
(there WERE no aerobics back then). John A. officially took over
the show 34 years later, with his son John R. joining him in
January 1985.
   Eighteen months ago, The Guinness Book of World Records
proclaimed ``Rambling with Gambling'' the world's longest-running
radio show, after its 20,000th broadcast.
   John A. cites that, along with a 30th anniversary broadcast from
Madison Square Garden, as the highlights of his career. Gambling
says he'll miss the camaraderie of the crew doing his show, along
with the loyal listeners who've kept his ratings high through the
years.
   ``We have an opportunity to touch millions of lives. You're
never quite sure how, but you hope you do it in a positive way,''
said John A. ``Every once in a while, there's feedback, and you
find out how you touched someone. That makes it all worthwhile.''
   In addition to longevity, there's been innovation: the Gamblings
are credited with providing the city's first radio newscast, first
helicopter traffic report, and its first school closings bulletins.
   There are additional Gamblings waiting to grab the microphone
down the line; John R. has three sons. Much to John A.'s dismay,
they are named Andrew, Bradley and William - although he's quick to
point out they all have the middle name John.
   ``The really marvelous part is the passing of the baton along to
my son,'' says Gambling. ``And he's got a few of his own waiting in
the wings.''

<HEAD>With PM-Right-To-Die, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of major events in the Nancy Cruzan
right-to-die case:
   -Jan. 11, 1983: Nancy Cruzan, then 25, has a wreck on a country
road southeast of Carthage, in the Ozarks of southwest Missouri and
is thrown from the car. Paramedics restart her breathing, but her
brain was without oxygen for so long she never regains
consciousness.
   -Feb. 5, 1983: Doctors implant a feeding tube in Ms. Cruzan's
stomach. She isn't on any life support system, such as a
respirator.
   -Oct. 19, 1983: Ms. Cruzan is moved to the Missouri
Rehabilitation Center in Mount Vernon, where she remains.
   -Oct. 23, 1987: Her parents, Joe and Joyce Cruzan of Carterville
ask Jasper County Probate Judge Charles Teel for a judgment on
their request that they be allowed to have Ms. Cruzan's feeding
tube removed, so she can die as they believe she would want.
   -March 9, 1988: A three-day hearing begins on the family's
request. The Cruzans say their daughter has a common-law right to
be free from unwanted medical treatment, and state and federal
constitutional rights to privacy that protect her right to refuse
unwanted medical treatment.
   -July 27, 1988: Teel issues a judgment authorizing the Cruzans,
acting as Nancy's legal guardians, to request the withholding of
food and water from their daughter.
   -Aug. 3, 1988: Missouri Attorney General William Webster files
notice that the state will appeal to the state Supreme Court.
   -Sept. 29, 1988: The court hears arguments.
   -Nov. 16, 1988: In a 4-3 decision, the state Supreme Court
overturns the lower court, holding there is no legal authority to
grant the Cruzans' request. The family appeals to the U.S. Supreme
Court.
   -Dec. 6, 1989: The U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments, the first
time it has considered a right-to-die case.
   -June 25, 1990: In a 5-4 decision, the court blocks the Cruzans
from halting their daughter's food and water. It says the state
could keep a patient on life support in the absence of ``clear and
convincing'' evidence the person would want to die.
   -Aug. 30, 1990: Ms. Cruzan's parents ask Teel for a second
hearing, saying they have new evidence their daughter once
indicated to three people she would rather die than live in her
present condition.
   -Sept. 17, 1990: Webster, saying the state no longer has a
``recognizable legal interest'' in the case, asks the judge to drop
the state Health Department and the director of the Missouri
Rehabilitation Center from future litigation.
   -Oct. 23, 1990: Teel drops the state as a defendant, leaving the
parents and court-appointed guardian Thad McCanse in the case.
   -Nov. 1, 1990: Three former co-workers tell Teel they recalled
conversations with Ms. Cruzan in which she said she never would
want to live ``like a vegetable'' on medical machines. Ms. Cruzan's
physician, who previously opposed removing the feeding tube, terms
her life ``a living hell'' and testifies she should be allowed to
die.
   -Dec. 5, 1990: Ms. Cruzan's court-appointed guardians recommend
the feeding tube be removed so Ms. Cruzan may die.
   -Dec. 14, 1990: Teel authorizes removal of feeding tubes.

   Babies are twice as likely to die of sudden
infant death syndrome in the winter than in the summer and at age 2
months than age 4 months, a new federal study shows.
   ut even though SIDS experts long presumed those facts to be
true, they still don't know why.
   The national Centers for Disease Control, analyzing eight years
of infant mortality data, reported Thursday that the SIDS risk is
twice as high in January as in July, and more than twice as high at
2 months as at 4 months.
   The findings are important to researchers looking for the cause
of SIDS, which kills about 6,000 American infants a year.
   ``What we suspect is that an infectious process is somehow
triggering death in these infants during cold weather,'' said Dr.
Jose Becerra, an infant health specialist with the Atlanta-based
CDC.
   ``There's also a remarkably similar pattern (for age and season)
in infectious diseases - very similar,'' he said. ``It's
intriguing.''
   A 1988 study suggested a possible relationship between
respiratory infections and SIDS, pointing to episodes of vomiting
or diarrhea in the two weeks preceding death in some cases.
   That study indicated that breast-feeding could be protective
against SIDS, by guarding against gastrointestinal or respiratory
infections.
   Breast-feeding might help ``avert some of the gastrointestinal
illnesses which we know are more common in the winter months,''
Becerra said.
   ``Obviously, if there's a correlation with respiratory
infections or G-I infections, it's patently reasonable that maybe
the infection there is responsible,'' said Dr. Alfred
Steinschneider, president of the Atlanta-based American SIDS
Institute.
   ``We know babies ... who die of SIDS must have an underlying,
chronic abnormality,'' he said. ``Respiratory infections or G-I
illnesses might act as a trigger to convert the predisposition to
die into death.''
   Nationwide, the SIDS rate is 13 deaths for every 10,000 live
births, according to CDC. Analyzing infant death statistics from
1980 to 1987, the CDC also reported that SIDS rates were nearly
twice as high for black babies as white babies, and half again as
high for baby boys as for baby girls.
   The rate was highest for infants in the West and lowest in the
Northeast.
   Broken down by age, SIDS rates were highest between 1 and 4
completed months of life. The SIDS risk peaks at 2 months: 144
percent higher, or more than double, the risk just two months
later.
   Meanwhile, SIDS risk peaked in December, January and February.
The risk in July was 50 percent lower than that in January, the
highest month.
   Steinschneider stressed, however, that SIDS occurs all year,
often among premature or underweight babies.
   ``What is important,'' he said, ``is a very practical thing: get
darned good pre-natal care.''

   A shift in public awareness, along with stricter
laws and enforcement, may be why drunken-driving fatalities
decreased 12 percent in seven years, a new federal study shows.
   In 1989, 39.2 percent of traffic deaths involved at least one
person who was legally drunk, down from 46.3 percent in 1982, the
national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday.
   In actual numbers, 17,849 Americans died in such accidents in
1989, down 12 percent from 20,356 in 1982.
   Reasons for the improvement may include increased public
distaste for drunken drivers, changes in state laws penalizing
drunken driving, increased enforcement and higher drinking ages,
the CDC concluded.
   ``It's probably a combination of things, not the least of which
is public awareness,'' said a science researcher with the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration, who cited an administration
policy and asked not to be named.
   ``In the early '80s, we had big decreases, which had to do with
the peaks in public awareness,'' he said. ``Then ... new laws
kicked in, along with the 21 drinking age, and there's been a
steady decrease based upon those laws.''
   The CDC also reported that 24.2 percent of drivers involved in
fatal crashes in 1989 were legally drunk, down from 30 percent in
1982. The numbers showed 14,644 drunken drivers involved in fatal
crashes in 1989, down 13 percent from 16,793 in 1982.
   The declines have been fairly steady throughout the '80s.
   In 1989, the nation recorded 45,555 traffic fatalities. In
addition to the 17,849, or 39.2 percent, involving a drunken
driver, pedestrian or cyclist, another 4,566, or 10 percent,
involved at least one person who had been drinking, but wasn't
legally drunk.
   The Atlanta-based CDC noted that the percentage of fatalities in
crashes involving someone drinking, but not drunk, has remained
fairly constant: between 10.0 percent and 11.1 percent in each of
the eight years studied.
   A total of 23,140, or 50.8 percent, involved no parties with a
blood-alcohol reading.
   Meanwhile, of the 60,398 drivers involved in fatal crashes in
1989, 24.2 percent, or 14,644, were drunk, the CDC reported.
Another 4,540, or 7.5 percent, had been drinking, while 41,214, or
68.2 percent, hadn't been.

<HEAD>Ford Grants $2.5 Million To Aid Community College Transfers</HEAD>

   The Ford Foundation has awarded $2.5 million in
grants to help community college students successfully transfer to
four-year schools granting bachelor's degrees.
   Some of the money will also support efforts to increase the
number of minority and female administrators at community colleges,
said Franklin A. Thomas, the foundation's president. He announced
the grants Thursday.
   Only about 15 percent of community college students successfully
transfer to four-year institutions, Thomas said, adding the grants
are aimed especially at increasing the number of minority students
who do so.
   The bulk of the Ford grant, $2 million, will go to the American
Council on Education's National Center for Academic Achievement and
Transfer. It will distribute the funds to pairs of two- and
four-year institutions to establish joint curricula and take other
steps to smooth the transition for students.
   The Washington-based council, which represents some 1,800
colleges and other institutions, will name the schools getting
grants in April.
   Four pairs will receive $200,000 each to create joint core
curricula to ensure community college students are prepared to
transfer.
   Ten other pairs will get $25,000 grants to help them establish
partnerships aimed at fostering the skills necessary for minority
youngsters to advance from community colleges to four-year schools.
   The rest of the grant to ACE will be used to collect information
on transfer rates, to produce publications on those rates and to
support the center.
   ``This initiative will encourage two- and four-year institutions
to work together so more community college students can earn the
credits necessary to transfer,'' Thomas said.
   The remaining $500,000 will go to nine institutions to help more
women and minorities gain administrative jobs in higher education.
   Those institutions, which will each get approximately $50,000,
are: North Carolina State University; Texas A&amp;M University; the
Michigan Community College Consortium; the Association of
California Community College Administrators, in Cupertino, Calif.;
the Maricopa (Ariz.) Community College District; the National
Community College Hispanic Council in Fort Worth, Texas; Harvard
University's Institute for Educational Management; Salish Kootenai
Community College in Pablo, Mont.; and the American Council on
Education.
   Ford has awarded more than $7.5 million in the last six years to
programs aimed at helping talented community college students go on
to four-year colleges. Much of the money has been targeted at
minority youngsters in urban schools.

   Unlike most of us, Patrick J. Fay never
worries about making a panicky, late-night dash to the drugstore to
find replacement bulbs for his burnt-out Christmas tree lights.
   When the lights go out, Fay doesn't curse the darkness.
   Instead, he chuckles and descends to his cozy basement, where
his antique collection of 700 or 800 tree lights - all in good
working order - and about 2,000 ornaments is safely stored.
   He has so many, in fact, that his suburban Washington, D.C.,
home boasts not one but three Christmas trees, their branches
sagging under the weight of brightly colored baubles and twinkling,
blinking bulbs.
   ``I've gone a little overboard on the lights,'' he says, smiling
ruefully. ``I have so many lights that I feel guilty not using them
all, so we change them and the ornaments every week or so. We have
ever-changing trees.''
   The trees are artificial, the better to withstand all the
changing of lights and ornaments and because they don't require
watering. They are put up the day after Thanksgiving and sometimes
aren't taken down until mid-January, he says.
   Fay's oldest ornament is a teardrop-shaped, red and silver
``kugel'' or ``witch's ball,'' made in Germany of molded blown
glass in the 1870s. It is nestled in the branches of a rare old
German ``feather tree.''
   The feather tree looks like a real, though somewhat scraggly,
pine tree. It consists of green-dyed goose feather ``needles''
wired to the thin metal branches of a tall wooden stick. Many
German immigrants folded these cherished holiday artifacts into
their luggage and brought them to America in the 1800s, Fay said.
   His rarest set of Christmas tree lights is an eight-bulb string
of carbon-filament Edison lamps stamped 1904. That was only a year
after the small, pear-shaped bulbs first hit the U.S. market as
substitutes for the centuries-old tradition of tree candles.
   ``At the turn of the century, electric tree lights were only for
the very rich,'' Fay said. ``The bulbs cost about $1 each, which
was a tremendous sum in those days. You had to have an electrician
come to your home to wire them, and they were screwed into a
ceiling fixture.
   ``The carbon filaments burned very hot and used a lot of
electricity,'' he said. ``The bulbs overheated, burned down trees
and really made the meter go around.''
   They were replaced by cooler, brighter tungsten-filament bulbs
shortly after World War II, which also was the beginning of the
golden era of fancy Christmas tree ornaments.
   Fay's trees are full of lavish glass baubles from Germany,
beaded-glass novelties from Czechoslovakia, tiny illuminated
houses, kewpie dolls in snowsuits, dirigibles, fruits and
vegetables, miniature airplanes and ocean liners.
   There are spun-glass butterflies, double-faced angels, barnyard
animals, feather-tailed peacocks, windmills, chicks popping out of
eggshells and lights covered with revolving painted lampshades.
   There are elaborately scissored-paper ``Dresdens'' from Germany,
tree balls from World War II with caps of cardboard instead of
scarce tin, bubble lights from the 1950s and midget lights from the
1960s.
   Fay, a 42-year-old hotel banquet waiter, began collecting
Christmas tree antiques more than a decade ago, when he and his
wife, Flora, a real estate agent, found a large box of ``quite
rare, quite expensive'' ornaments in the attic of a home they had
just bought.
   ``Some people think I'm absolutely crazy, but it's a hobby that
has grown by leaps and bounds,'' he said.
   ``We have friends and neighbors over for show-and-tell, and they
are always stunned. The older ones always see something on the
trees that reminds them of their youth.''

   Superpower diplomacy may yet rescue the tragic
country of Afghanistan after 12 years of war, 1 million deaths and
staggering devastation that has made refugees of 5 million people.
   The children, as is often the case in war, have suffered the
most.
   About half of the dead and displaced are children. Infant
mortality is extremely high, rivaled only by the death rate in
Cambodia and Sudan. Tuberculosis and malaria are the biggest
killers - inside the camps in Pakistan and Iran and within
Afghanistan itself.
   This week, the United States and the Soviet Union took some
serious steps to end the fighting. They agreed in principle to stop
providing the combatants with weapons and decided an election
should be held under international supervision.
   ``There is a wide area of agreement between us,'' Secretary of
State James A. Baker III said after talks with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. But, he said, ``there are still
questions that have to be answered.''
   Among them is the scope of an assistance program to rehabilitate
the country. The job is immense.
   ``The fragile Afghan social fabric has been torn apart,'' writer
Selig S. Harrison said in his recent book, ``After The Wars.''
   More than 100,000 of the country's educated elite have resettled
abroad. Tensions among diverse ethnic groups have been exacerbated
as the Soviet Union, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and other outsiders
sought to manipulate the outcome of the war to suit their own
interests.
   The Soviets wanted a client state. Pakistan, which had inherited
part of the country lopped off by British imperialists, wanted a
government in Kabul it could influence. And the Saudis used their
wealth to try to swing Afghanistan into the Moslem camp.
   The United States, recognizing even before the Cold War thawed
that the Soviet Union would not put up with having a hostile regime
on its border, dubbed the guerrillas ``freedom fighters'' and armed
them to combat Soviet influence.
   Apart from the 1 million deaths, the war has left 700,000 widows
and orphans and 535,000 disabled veterans, destroyed one-third of
the country's villages and two-thirds of its paved roads and
created 2 million internal refugees out of a pre-war population of
ll.7 million.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev withdrew the Red Army last
year after more than nine years of warfare against guerrillas armed
by the United States, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
   Many U.S. analysts assumed President Najibullah's pro-Moscow
government would collapse.
   They underestimated his skills and also the frictions among the
guerrillas, some of whom are controlled by Pakistan and inclined to
a Moslem fundamentalism at odds with democratic principles.
   Gorbachev's move did not remove the superpowers from the
conflict, however.
   The Soviets provide the Kabul government with about $500 million
a year in military assistance. The United States and Saudi Arabia
each help the guerrillas with about $300 million in weapons and
other military aid.
   The improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations is having a positive
impact on regional conflicts like the one in Afghanistan. For
instance, the two powers are cooperating to try to end the fighting
in Cambodia and Angola.
   Afghanistan, which was founded in 1747, was ruled by kings until
Zahir Shah was overthrown in 1973. A Marxist coup in 1978 touched
off a war that continues to tear the country apart.
   In the meantime, the United Nations has launched a
reconstruction program. U.S. contributions have been dwarfed by
some other nations - $45.5 million compared, for instance, with a
$600 million Soviet pledge and $145 million by Japan.
   Ekrem Birerdinc, who coordinates the U.N. Children's Fund
program for Afghanistan, described the awful impact of the war in
an interview Thursday.
   Most of the children in refugee camps in Pakistan and Iran were
born there. ``They don't know their own country, their own
culture,'' he said.
   The Children's Fund and other organizations have managed to
immunize about 60 percent of the children against killer diseases.
Within Afghanistan, he estimated, only about 20 percent are
immunized.
   ``We cannot reach the children inside because the war is going
on and there are clashes,'' he said.
   Three million children are not going to school, Birerdinc said,
contributing ``to an army of illiterates.''
   Literacy in Afghanistan was always a problem. Before the war,
only 3 percent of the Afghan women had been taught to read and
write.
   ``What you need to do now is to rebuild the whole country,''
Birerdinc said. ``If the war stops then we can say it is not the
bomb, it is the water you are drinking that is hurting you.''

   Seven former Persian Gulf hostages got a
festive White House welcome even as images of the destruction they
had left behind lingered in their minds.
   The newly freed captives met with President Bush for an hour
Thursday, and five tagged along as he lit the national Christmas
tree in a nearby park. They provided a united vote of confidence
for Bush's efforts to free Kuwait from Iraq.
   ``To a man, we were in agreement with the care and the diligence
which is being taken by the president,'' said Ralph Montgomery, who
spent four months hiding in Kuwait.
   The hostages urged Bush to see that the international coalition
against Iraq stands firm, said Montgomery. The 57-year-old
architect from Indian Rocks Beach, Fla., hid with his son-in-law,
who was a teacher at the American school in Kuwait.
   Montgomery praised his son's Palestinian neighbors for
protecting them throughout the ordeal. Gunfire and explosions could
frequently be heard nearby, he said.
   Antonio Mireles, who holed up at the U.S. Embassy compound in
Kuwait, said the hostages told Bush the Kuwaitis are a peace-loving
people and ``what has happened here cannot be left unattended. ...
It was atrocious what occurred here.''
   ``Even if I do not go back, I would like them to get their
country back,'' he said. Mireles, 48, was a civil engineer working
for the Kuwaiti government.
   Ernest Alexander, who was in hiding in Kuwait, said Bush's
policies and his efforts on behalf of the hostages were ``one of
the things that heartened us'' while the captives awaited freedom.
   Alexander, a 38-year-old lawyer who had lived in Kuwait for
several years, said that two weeks ago he never would have expected
to back in the United States before Christmas. He suggested it
bodes well for further progress on the gulf crisis.
   ``Maybe he'll blink,'' Alexander said, referring to Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.
   Bush called his session with the hostages and some of their
relatives ``a very moving experience'' and rejected the idea that
Saddam should get a reward for letting them go.
   ``Hell, no. Not one thing,'' the president said. ``You don't
reward a kidnapper. You don't reward somebody who has done
something he shouldn't have done in the first place.''
   Asked if he expected to be able to defuse the tensions in the
Persian Gulf, Bush snapped, ``One way or another we will.''
   ``What this man (Saddam) put the world through - I just can't
express it. And I think you all expressed it coming home with a
clarity that has brought this home to the American people,'' Bush
told the hostages.
   The president met with the hostages as 32 of their countrymen
left the Persian Gulf on Thursday on what could be the last U.S.
charter flight out. The group included the U.S. ambassador to
Kuwait, Nathaniel Howell, and his staff.
   They were arriving this afternoon at Andrews Air Force Base
outside Washington.
   The besieged diplomats left the embassy only after they were
satisfied that all Americans had been given a chance to leave the
country, U.S. officials said. An estimated 500 Americans - many of
them children with dual citizenship - have decided to remain in
Iraq and Kuwait.
   The other hostages who met Thursday with Bush were four men who
were held as so-called human shields at sensitive Iraqi
installations: Bill Rodebush of McAlester, Okla.; John Cole of
Odessa, Texas; Glenn Coleman of Boston, and Robert Hanby of
Gahanna, Ohio.

<HEAD>Baker Advises Shevardnadze About Heavy-Handed Domestic Measures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told his
Soviet counterpart this week that heavy-handed measures to enforce
control of the economy and in the restive Baltic republics could
jeopardize a massive U.S. aid package, U.S. officials say.
   Baker made the point privately to Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze as the Soviet described Moscow's drive to assert
central authority in a country beset by economic problems and
separatist movements, a knowledgeable official said.
   ``I wouldn't describe it as a major warning,'' the official,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said Thursday night.
   The conversation occurred in Houston before President Bush's
announcement Wednesday that he would help the Soviets meet
anticipated winter shortages by approving up to $1 billion in
federally guaranteed loans for purchases of food and other
agricultural goods.
   Baker, a former Treasury secretary, and Shevardnadze often
candidly discuss the Soviets' attempt to reconstruct their economy
and the hardships encountered along the way, said officials who
recounted the conversations.
   Shevardnadze explained how the central government was trying to
tighten control of the distribution of food to make sure it gets to
the marketplace.
   The foreign minister said one problem was coping with profiteers
who buy food at prices set by the government and then sell it,
sometimes at 10 times what they paid, to consumers trying to
overcome shortages.
   Without approving profiteering, Baker told Shevardnadze it's one
thing to maintain order and another to use a heavy hand to root out
attempts to stifle a market economy.
   Baker said a violent crackdown in dealing with the independence
movements in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania could strain the
improved U.S.-Soviet relationship and that Bush's assistance
program might be jeopardized, the officials said.
   Baker's advice came in a general discussion and Shevardnadze did
not take it as a confrontation  the officials said.
   Shevardnadze requested U.S. assistance from Baker on Tuesday in
Houston. The aid package announced by Bush the next day at the
White House exceeded Shevardnadze's request, according to U.S.
officials who briefed reporters afterward.
   Bush lifted a 16-year-old ban on guaranteed credits, said he
would propose that the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund give the Soviets a ``special association'' and offered help in
dealing with transportation problems.
   None of the U.S. aid is in the form of a gift and Baker stressed
at a news conference in Houston that it was temporary and that the
Soviets eventually would have to depend on their own vast
resources.

   A Swedish school wants to make a deal
with class troublemakers: stay out of mischief and pocket a few
kroner for your trouble.
   A school official in the southern town of Perstorp said Thursday
that authorities will pay 1,500 kroner a month, the equivalent of
$270, if students accused of drinking, cutting class and
vandalizing turn a new leaf.
   That will mean working in a community park or swimming pool and
taking school lessons during their spare time, said Kaj Seger, of
Perstorp Central School.
   ``We do this for two reasons: to save these boys a costly future
stay at a reformatory, and to give the others in the class peace
and quiet,'' he said.
   Five boys have been offered the deal, which will go into effect
after the Christmas holiday if they accept.

<HEAD>NRA Pushing Suit to Overturn Ban on Machine Gun Ownership</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Rifle Association is pushing a
suit that would overturn a government ban on civilian ownership of
new machine guns, but police groups supporting gun control want the
Supreme Court to ignore it.
   ``Machine guns are designed to kill large groups of people and
do so quickly,'' Don Cahill of the National Fraternal Order of
Police said during a Thursday news conference. ``Drug dealers and
others bent on violence are the only ones who need machine guns.''
   At issue is a 1986 amendment to the Gun Control Act.
   The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms says the amendment
prohibits private ownership of machine guns made after May 18,
1986. Still legal is civilian possession of the 125,000 privately
owned machine guns made before then and the transfer of those older
weapons as long as new owners obtain ATF's approval.
   To own an old machine gun, a person must be fingerprinted,
undergo a background check, obtain endorsement from the local
police chief or sheriff and pay a $200 fee per weapon.
   But NRA attorney Richard E. Gardiner said the government is
misinterpreting the 1986 legislation.
   ``What it says is that any machine gun made after that date can
be ... possessed under the authority of the United States,''
Gardiner said in an interview.
   While the government said it limits ownership of new machine
guns to law enforcement agencies and the military, Gardiner said it
means ownership is open to anyone meeting ATF standards such as
those established for individuals buying the older weapons.
   ``There's a section in the Gun Control Act that specifically
exempts all government agencies from the act,'' the NRA lawyer
said. ``It would be meaningless for Congress to create two
exemptions for the same people.''
   The NRA is supporting a case brought by gunsmith J.D. Farmer Jr.
of Smyrna, Ga. against ATF Director Stephen E. Higgins.
   Farmer wanted to make and own a machine gun, and he gave ATF all
the documents needed for possession of an old weapon. The bureau
rejected the application, saying the 1986 legislation was the sole
reason for doing so, according to Farmer's petition to the Supreme
Court.
   U.S. District Judge J. Owen Forrester of Atlanta ruled in
Farmer's favor in January 1989, but a three-member panel of the
11th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously overturned that decision
on July 11, 1990.
   The Supreme Court has not decided whether to hear Farmer's
appeal. The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence and seven police
organizations submitted a brief Thursday urging the top court not
to take the case.
   ``A great deal is at stake,'' Dennis A. Henigan, director of the
Center to Prevent Handgun Violence Legal Action Project, said at
the news conference. ``If the Supreme Court were to endorse
anything close to the NRA's doctrine, it would threaten every
sensible gun law in this country.''
   District of Columbia Police Chief Isaac Fulwood, speaking for
the International Association of Chiefs of Police, said: ``It is
absolutely vital that the sale and possession of new machine guns
stay illegal. ... Machine guns have no place in civilized
society.''
   David B. Mitchell, police chief of Prince George's County, Md.,
noted that ``more than a dozen cities have already broken all-time
murder records, and many others are approaching these frightening
marks.''
   Mitchell, representing the Police Executive Research Forum,
said, ``Every concerned American must truly believe that gun
violence will escalate even more if these military weapons are
available again to the general public.''
   But Gardiner rejected the idea that drug dealers and other
lawbreakers would rush to buy new machine guns. ``They're not the
kind of people who like to submit forms to the federal
government,'' he said.
   Other groups asking the Supreme Court to reject the Farmer case
were the National Association of Police Organizations, the National
Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, the Major City
Chiefs and the Police Foundation.

   A broken stone relief of two chariot horses from
5th century Persepolis have sold at a Sotheby's auction for
$606,000.
   The fragment sold Thursday shows the heads of two steeds with
their forelocks tied in knots with tassels. Sotheby's said it
formed part of a staircase in the great palace of Persepolis,
founded by Darius the Great in the early 5th century.
   It matches another fragment from the same relief at the British
Museum.
   The relief was brought to England in the early 19th century by
Sir Gore Ouseley, British ambassador to the Court of Persia,
according to Sotheby's.
   An antique dealer from Cheltenham sold it Thursday to an
unidentified buyer.

   Here are some facts and figures on Albania:
   ---
   THE LAND - Albania covers 10,600 square miles, and is slightly
larger than Maryland. It is in southeastern Europe on the coast of
the Adriatic Sea, and its neighbors are Yugoslavia and Greece.
   ---
   THE PEOPLE - Albania's 3.2 million people are made up primarly
of the Geg ethnic group in the north and the Tosks in the south.
Ethnic Greeks make up about 2.5 percent of the populace.
   ---
   THE ECONOMY - The chief industries of the country are mining,
chemical fertilizer and textiles. Its chief crops are corn, wheat,
cotton, potatoes, tobacco, citrus fruits and grapes.
   ---
   THE GOVERNMENT - Albania is last remaining Stalinist republic in
Eastern Europe. The Communist-run People's Assembly, a
single-chamber legislature of 250 deputies, meets a few days a year
essentially to ratify actions taken in its name by the presidium of
the assembly. The presidium is led by Ramiz Alia, the head of state
and Communist Party leader.
   On Tuesday, the party agreed to permit alternative political
organizations, and one day later the country's first non-Communist
party, the Democratic Party of Albania, was founded.
   New parliamentary elections are scheduled for Feb. 10.

   1945 - Elections are held based on a single slate of candidates
sponsored by the Communists headed by Enver Hoxha.
   1946 - King Zog is deposed and the People's Republic of Albania
is proclaimed.
   1949 - Albania, seeking protection from Yugoslav expansionism,
joins the Moscow-based CMEA (Council for Mutual Economic
Assistance, or Comecon).

<HEAD>Bennett Rejects Top GOP Job Two Weeks After Accepting It</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blood and law, in the form of advice from his
brother, convinced William Bennett he should reverse himself and
reject the chairmanship of the Republican National Committee.
   Bennett's brother Robert is the special counsel investigating
one of Congress' most sensitive ethics cases - the propriety of
five senators' actions on behalf of financier Charles H. Keating
Jr., a major contributor.
   And from brother Bill's perspective, that case and his own ``are
not totally unrelated.'' Bennett, in an interview Thursday, said he
asked his brother whether he should take the top GOP position.
   ``He said, `My advice to you is not to take this job,''' Bennett
said. ``I said, `Is it a close call?' and he said, `90-10.'''
   Bennett, who resigned in November as national drug policy
director, is not supposed to lobby or come into extensive contact
with the White House for a year after leaving the administration.
   He also was told by White House lawyers that he would have to
give up a book contract and other outside income. ``I didn't take a
vow of poverty,'' Bennett told reporters as he rejected the RNC job
he had accepted from President Bush two weeks earlier.
   The surprise development was an embarrassment to Bush and
Bennett. The White House now must find a new candidate to take over
day-to-day party operations from the ailing Lee Atwater.
   The RNC position, which would involve constant contact with the
administration as well as raising money from many individuals and
groups with special interests, falls into a murky area.
   Some lawyers say there would be no conflict, but others -
including Robert Bennett - predicted trouble.
   ``Bob said to me, `Look, you'll be very public in your views.
You'll be controversial. People will want to target you and if they
can find some vulnerability, they'll be looking for it,''' Bennett
recounted.
   Complicating the ethics tangle was the fact that Bennett would
have had to repay his book advance, listed at $187,500 on financial
disclosure forms.
   Bennett reported receiving $240,000 in speaking fees during the
four months between his resignation as education secretary in
September 1988 and when he was given the drug czar job in January.
But he said he would be hard-pressed to repay the advance.
   ``I would have to earn that money by consulting and giving
speeches. I would be engaged in activity which I am precluded from
doing for a year,'' he said.
   White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray decided this week that
Bennett would violate the no-contact law if he took money beyond
his $125,100-a-year RNC paycheck. Gray told The Associated Press he
had warned Bennett all along that his speeches would have to be
restricted.
   ``At the time it was hypothetical who he would speak to,'' Gray
said of his initial advice. But he said Bennett subsequently lined
up speaking engagements with industry and trade groups that had
direct interests in lobbying the administration on policy matters.
   ``The question here is not strictly legal. It's a question of
appearance, a question of prudence and ultimately a question of
politics,'' Gray said.
   Bennett, however, maintained that the advice from the White
House changed. In his view, his green light had turned red and he
turned to his brother.
   ``That's when things became very clear,'' he said. ``I have been
at this for nine years and I have a reputation for being a lot of
things. But no one has ever raised any questions about propriety or
ethics and I will not allow them to be raised.''
   One administration source familiar with the situation said Gray
had cautioned Bennett early on about the risks of appearance of
impropriety, but backed off under pressure from White House chief
of staff John Sununu, who wanted Bennett to be able to take the
job. The source spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Bennett, 47, is a fellow at the Hudson Institute, a conservative
political research organization. His publishing contract with Simon
&amp; Schuster calls for him to write two books.
   A couple of Cabinet members have been mentioned as potential RNC
chairmen, and Bennett said they probably would not be under
financial pressure to make outside money through speeches or
consulting.
   But he said the White House contact and fund-raising duties
alone could prove risky to anyone coming from the administration.

   The ashes of American financier Malcolm Forbes
have been buried at an island resort he owned in Fiji, the resort
managers said today.
   The service for Forbes, who died in February at age 70, was held
last week, but the managers declined to give any details.
   Forbes's ashes were buried at the exclusive Laucala Island
resort, 120 miles east of Suva, which he started in 1987.
   Forbes often flew to Fiji on his gold-and-green private jet, the
``Capitalist's Tool,'' and the plane apparently also brought
Forbes' remains to the island.
   A spokesman for the Forbes family in New York could not
immediately be reached for comment.

<HEAD>NRC Cutting Maximum Exposure Levels</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is
reducing the amount of radiation to which workers at atomic plants
and nearby residents may be exposed, but critics contend the new
ceilings already are outdated and inadequate.
   The NRC's action on Thursday represents the first broad
revamping of radiation exposure limits for nuclear plant workers in
33 years. Officials said it reflects new scientific findings on
radiation risks.
   Radiation exposure to most atomic workers and people living near
nuclear facilities already is well within the new requirements and
few operational changes are expected, said Donald Cool, chief of
the NRC's radiation protection and health effects branch.
   The NRC has debated tighter controls on radiation exposure at
nuclear facilities for a decade. The final action comes 13 years
after an international scientific advisory group recommended lower
exposure ceilings - levels identical to those required by the new
rules.
   Under the new NRC requirements, atomic plant workers may be
exposed to no more than 5 rems of radiation per year and exposure
to the general public may be no more than 100 millirems per year,
about one-fifth of the current limit.
   A rem, which is the standard measure of radiation, equals 1,000
millirems. The NRC rules affect commercial nuclear power plants,
various laboratories and facilities involved in uranium production.
   According to government studies, people on average are exposed
from normal background radiation and medical treatments to about
360 millirems of radiation annually. Radiation from an X-ray is
about 6 to 7 millirems.
   The average exposure to plant workers is about 400 millirems a
year and there has been no case reported where members of the
general population have been exposed to levels anywhere near the
new 100-millirem ceiling, said NRC spokesman Joe Fouchard.
   Critics, however, accused the NRC of not going far enough and of
issuing new rules that will be outdated before they even go into
effect beginning in 1993.
   The NRC's lower radiation exposure levels reflect
recommendations made as early as 1977 by the International
Commission on Radiological Protection, a key scientific advisory
body.
   However, the same group announced last summer that it considers
its 1977 recommendations to be outdated. The group is expected
shortly to recommend maximum radiation exposure levels for atomic
workers of 2 rems per year.
   The lower ceiling is based on a number of recent studies on
radiation health risks including one by the National Academy of
Sciences earlier this year that put cancer risks from radiation two
to five times greater than a similar study did in 1980.
   ``The commission is straining its credibility by adopting an
obsolete standard,'' said Michael Mariotte, executive director of
the Nuclear Information and Resource Service, an anti-nuclear
umbrella group.
   The NRC, in explaining the regulatory change, said the new
requirements ``reflect changes in the basic philosophy of radiation
protection'' and take into account recent scientific studies on the
risks of radiation.
   The commission said it didn't believe the imposition of even
lower radiation exposure ceiling for nuclear workers is needed
because actual contamination of most workers already is much lower
than the 5-rem-per-year standard being proposed.
   In 1987, 97 percent of all workers at nuclear plants and other
atomic facilities were exposed to less than 2 rems of radiation
annually, the NRC said.
   The new regulations also establish tighter standards that apply
to pregnant workers at atomic facilities, limiting exposure to 500
millirems over the duration of the pregnancy, and require that
plants adopt formal policies to keep radiation doses ``as low as
reasonably achievable.''

   The far side of the moon, last
photographed by Apollo astronauts two decades ago, was captured on
film again by the Galileo spacecraft when it zoomed past the Earth
on its long voyage to Jupiter.
   ``It's staggering to realize we've been neglecting our own
satellite,'' said Torrence Johnson, Galileo's chief scientist at
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Astronauts with the 1969-1972 Apollo lunar missions photographed
the back side of the moon, but Johnson said Thursday the last good
pictures before Galileo were made by unmanned lunar orbiters during
the 1960s.
   Galileo passed the moon after it swooped 597 miles above the
southwest Atlantic Ocean on Saturday. It used Earth's gravity as a
slingshot to help expand the spacecraft's orbit around the sun so
it can reach Jupiter in 1995. It used Venus for the same purpose
last February and will fly past Earth again in December 1992.
   The planetary encounters are meant solely to help propel Galileo
on its $1.4 billion mission to Jupiter. But scientists took the
opportunity to use the spacecraft to study Venus and Earth in dress
rehearsals for exploring Jupiter.
   Three of Galileo's new photographs of the moon and Earth were
released Thursday by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration as Galileo zoomed away from Earth, snapping more
pictures of its home planet from a distance of 2.33 million miles.
   One photo shows the crescent moon, while another shows Mare
Orientale, a 550-mile-wide meteorite impact crater on the far side
of the moon, which is always pointed away from Earth. Because of
the way the moon orbits Earth, only five-eighths of its surface can
be seen from Earth.
   Galileo's third picture shows half of Antarctica, including the
Ross Ice Shelf and mountains poking through ice near McMurdo Sound.
   ``This is the first time we've had a chance to use a spacecraft
designed to explore another planet to come back and look at our own
Earth and moon as if we were alien observers,'' Johnson said.
   ``In the process, we're learning some new scientific things
about our own world and its companion, but perhaps more
importantly, it's providing us a different perspective on our own
home planet as a fragile world,'' he said.
   Galileo is the first craft equipped with modern instruments to
study the far side of the moon and photographed some regions for
the first time, said Clark Chapman, a researcher from the Planetary
Science Institute in Tucson, Ariz.
   ``We're going to learn a lot about the geology of the back side
of the moon,'' Chapman said. ``It's been a fantastic lunar mission
already.''
   NASA plans to release more pictures Wednesday and hopes to
display a movie made of 1,400 still images showing clouds moving
above the spinning Earth.
   Some unreleased pictures were displayed Thursday during a NASA
closed-circuit television broadcast. They showed closeup views of
clouds drifting above Australia and more distant peeks at Asia,
India, Baja California and the Andes.
   Galileo was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on Oct. 18,
1989.
   It was to have been sent on a direct, two-year flight to
Jupiter. But after the 1986 explosion that destroyed the shuttle
Challenger, NASA decided it was too risky to launch Galileo from
the shuttle using a powerful liquid-fueled rocket. A weaker booster
was used, requiring Galileo to use the gravity of Venus and Earth
to make a looping 2.4-billion-mile, six-year voyage.

   Twelve people taking part in a ceremony
to call up spirits were found dead Thursday in a home in this
Mexican border city. Seven others found sprawled on the floor in a
circle formed by rope were in serious condition, said a Baja
California police spokeswoman.
   One officer said the 19 men, women and children were the
apparent victims of a mass suicide attempt by poison. Others said
it could be an accidental asphyxiation or poisoning.
   Relatives of the victims said they had previously attended
healing rites in the house that were a mixture of Christianity and
spiritualism, which involves calling the spirits of the dead for
consultation.
   ``They were holding a session in which they communicated with
the spirits,'' said Tijuana state judicial police commander Jaime
Sam Fierro.
   He said the victims might have been poisoned by butane gas,
which is used in Mexico for home heating or stoves - or by
something they ate or drank. An autopsy is to be completed Friday,
said police spokeswomen Sara Yolanda Gonzalez in Mexicali, the
state capital.
   Authorities said the deaths could have been caused by
industrial-strength alcohol believed to be in a fruit punch
participants shared during the ceremony, the Los Angeles Times
reported Friday.
   ``We believe we've ruled out both suicide and homicide,'' Jose
Nunez de Caceres, a commander of the Baja California state police,
told the Times.
   Officers were conducting tests on the punch and a bowl of cooked
chicken found in the house where the 12 bodies were found, Gonzalez
said. Police said a witness told them the house smelled strongly of
gas when the bodies were discovered Thursday morning, she said.
   Police said the group leader and house owner, Federico Padres,
72, was among four survivors in a coma. One of the survivors was an
18-month-old baby.
   Authorities found the bodies, some piled upon each other, on
couches, chairs and the floor of the well-kept house in the Florido
neighborhood, a poor district of shanties and squatter camps.
   A rope with 13 knots tied in it was laid in a circle on the
living room floor around four or five of the bodies, said officers
who saw the inside of the house.
   Neighbors said chanting had filtered from the house over the
past several nights; the last time starting Wednesday night and
continuing into the morning.
   Officer Jorge Gamala quoted a neighbor as saying she had
overheard people at the house talking about when they were going to
``do it.''
   ``She overheard them say that their god was waiting for them and
they had to get it done by the end of the year,'' Gamala said.
   A young woman who lives in the house reported the bodies to
state judicial police, Gonzalez said.
   The woman, Ana Faviola Miranda, 17, said Padres frequently held
healing ceremonies there and held one Wednesday night, Gonzalez
said.
   Miranda said she went home at 8 p.m. Wednesday and Padres told
her to leave and come back later, according to police.
   When she returned at 8:55 p.m., she said the house smelled
strongly of gas, police reports said. They said Padres told her to
wait outside.
   From Padres' car, where she waited, Miranda said she heard
shouts and whining, but didn't do anything because she was used to
that kind of carrying on, Gonzalez said.
   After spending the night in the car, Miranda asked a neighbor
for help, and the two entered the house through a window, the woman
testified.
   Upon seeing the bodies, Miranda said she thought the ceremony
participants were asleep or in a trance, Gonzalez said.
   Gonzalez said Miranda informed police at 11 a.m. Thursday.
   Police said they found four men, seven women and a 6-year-old
girl dead.
   Padres and Miranda's mother Gloria Miranda, 38, were among the
dead, Gonzalez said. She said police had not yet identified the
rest of the dead.
   According to a report by KFMB-TV of San Diego, Mexican State
Judicial Police said they believe the victims had ingested poison.
The victims, the report said, suffered a purplish discoloration of
the skin.

<HEAD>Concern Over Public Alarm Delays EPA Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   White House fears of unduly alarming the public have delayed
until next week the release of an Environmental Protection Agency
report linking electromagnetic fields to leukemia and brain cancer
in children, the EPA says.
   The report, which was to have been released last month,
suggests, but does not prove, that electromagnetic fields can cause
cancer, EPA officials said Thursday.
   D. Allan Bromley, a White House science adviser, and James O.
Mason, assistant secretary of health and human services, told EPA
officials they were concerned the public would misinterpret the
report's conclusions.
   ``They were concerned not about the accuracy of the report,''
said Robert McGaughy, who supervised the report's preparation.
``They were concerned about how people would react to the news.
There is a concern that people will take too seriously the
suggestions that there may be some connection with cancer.''
   Neither Bromley nor Mason were available for interviews
Thursday, their offices said.
   Some EPA scientists were angry about the delay, said David
Bayliss, one of the report's authors. It initially was scheduled
for release Nov. 27, he said.
   ``What is the use of having an Environmental Protection Agency
if you're going to withhold information from the public?'' Bayliss
said. ``I thought the EPA was for letting people know about health
problems, or possible health problems.''
   The report looked at all kinds of electromagnetic fields, from
those produced by high-power electrical transmission lines to those
produced by household applinces.
   Virtually everyone is exposed to such fields every day.
   Epidemiological, or statistical, studies have linked residential
exposures to childhood cancer, and studies have linked occupational
exposures to cancer in adults, said David Savitz of the University
of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, the author of one of the most
important of those studies.
   Laboratory experiments have suggested that living cells can
respond to electromagnetic fields. And researchers have hypotheses
as to why the fields might cause cancer, Savitz said.
   ``There are credible scientific suggestions of adverse health
effects from these exposures, but the overall body of evidence is
not conclusive,'' he said.
   The EPA report is a review of all existing studies on
electromagnetic fields and cancer. A draft prepared last summer
concluded that the studies ``show a consistent pattern of response
which suggests, but does not prove, a causal link'' between
household power distribution systems and certain cancers in
children.
   The children's cancers were leukemia, brain cancer and lymphoma,
the report said.
   The draft has been revised once, but ``our current conclusions
are very similar,'' McGaughy said.
   McGaughy said questions raised by Bromley at a meeting Nov. 26
with McGaughy and other EPA officials in Bromley's office delayed
the report's scheduled release the following day.
   Mason expressed similar objections Dec. 6, McGaughy said.
   Erich Bretthauer, the EPA's assistant administrator for research
and development, said both men were involved because an interagency
federal committee that they oversee also is studying
electromagnetic fields and health hazards.
   Bretthauer said the report will be released next week.
   He said Bromley and Mason disagreed with the EPA over nuances of
the epidemiological studies considered in the report. ``I don't
think they see the data the way we do,'' Bretthauer said. When
asked to clarify the disagreements, he said, ``I'm going to refer
you to them.''
   In an earlier version, prepared last spring, the agency
tentatively proposed classifying electromagnetic fields as a
``class B1'' carcinogen, meaning that they are a probable source of
human cancer.
   ``But when it went through the peer review inside the agency,
that recommendation was taken out - some say with malice, and some
say without,'' said David Janes, a now-retired EPA administrator
who commissioned the study. Janes said he thought the EPA report
would have a great impact, because of the nature of the risk. ``I
think it will create a lot of apprehension among folks, especially
since this is one of those `you can't see it, feel it or taste it.'
And an individual's exposure is not under an individual's
control.''

   Welcome to crunch time for state governments.
   Spending is up considerably, but revenue isn't. The result:
budget cuts or tax increases are in the offing in many states.
   ``This is the worst I've ever seen it in Mississippi,'' said
Republican state Sen. Dick Hall. ``The joyride had to end. It just
ended a year or so sooner than we thought it would.''
   Hall's comments echoed those of other state lawmakers attending
a convention of the National Conference of State Legislatures this
week.
   Amid a weakening national economy, revenue in 25 states is far
behind projections. Two-thirds of state governments will have to
cut budgets or raise taxes next year to balance their books, a
conference survey found.
   Corporate income tax collections in Mississippi, for instance,
have been running below earlier estimates for the past 14 months.
The state legislature and Democratic Gov. Ray Mabus now must figure
out how to cover a $100 million shortfall.
   It promises to be an ugly fight because all legislative seats
and the governorship are up for election next year in Mississippi.
The amount of political posturing is bound to be greater than
usual, Hall said.
   Nowhere are state finances more dismal than in the Northeast.
   Connecticut faces a deficit of $562 million for the next six
months plus a shortfall of $1.5 billion, 20 percent of the budget,
for fiscal 1992.
   When recession hit, revenue in Connecticut took a nosedive.
   ``This is a roller-coaster tax structure'' that relies heavily
on sales taxes, said state Rep. Mary Mushinsky, whose constituents
are starting to experience layoffs. Connecticut's financial
problems in the recession of the early 1980s were ``a small blip''
compared to the current difficulties, she said.
   Gov.-elect Lowell Weicker is considering a state income tax to
fix the problem.
   The economic slump ``is as serious as it was in 1982'' and the
slide seems ``to be progressing at a faster rate'' than in the
early '80s, Maine House Speaker John Martin told reporters
Thursday.
   Each of the six New England states is a candidate for tax
increases, state legislative leaders reported.
   The Midwest won't escape the crunch, either.
   Ohio faces a $262 million deficit and the legislature will meet
next week to act on a package of budget cuts.
   Congress is contributing to the states' woes, state lawmakers
complained at the conference. Rep. Dale Kildee, D-Mich., got a
hostile reception when he spoke to the legislators.
   Congress has revised programs such as Medicaid and left it to
the states to pay for the changes.
   ``You lay all of these mandates on us'' and don't provide the
money to pay for them, Ohio state Sen. Richard Finan told Kildee.
   Finan, a Republican, is chairman of the state Senate ways and
means committee and will be one of the major players as the Ohio
legislature tries to bridge the budget gap.
   The coming months promise to be a battle royal in many state
capitals.
   In California, Gov.-elect Pete Wilson faces a stern test -
dealing with a projected budget deficit of $800 million in the
fast-growing state.
   Wilson had better not try to cut needed services for low-income
people, warned California state Rep. Dianne Watson, who represents
part of Los Angeles.
   She pointed to the defeat the Democratic-controlled legislature
handed Republican Gov. George Deukmejian this month. It rejected
his bid to reduce an income tax credit for renters, a move that
would have saved the state $200 million.
   The situation is likely to get worse in California. For the
fiscal year starting next July, revenue is expected to fall short
of spending by $5.9 billion.

<HEAD>Report Seen Unlikely to Recommend Massive Boost in Western Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A long-awaited study of the Soviet economy is
unlikely to recommend a flood of direct Western assistance when it
is released next week, Bush administration officials said.
   Rather, they said, the report will provide the most detailed
analysis to date of the problems besetting the Soviet economy and
recommend ways in which technical assistance can be provided to the
Soviets.
   A senior Treasury Department official, speaking on condition his
name not be used, said Thursday that the report should ``provide
the most comprehensive and timely assessment that has been seen on
the Soviet economy.''
   But the official said he did not expect the document to support
any push for large amounts of Western aid until the Soviets make
greater strides toward a market-based economy.
   The report, which is expected to be released Dec. 20, was
ordered by President Bush and the leaders of Japan, Germany,
Britain, France, Italy and Canada last July in Houston during the
annual economic summit meeting of the world's seven largest
industrial countries.
   The study has been conducted by the International Monetary Fund
and its sister lending organization, the World Bank, along with the
Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, a lending
agency created this year to promote economic development in Eastern
Europe.
   The study represented a way at the Houston summit to reach a
compromise between the demands of the French and Germans for an
immediate $15 billion Western aid package and resistance to direct
economic aid by Bush and the other summit leaders.
   Bush announced Wednesday that he was granting the Soviet Union
up to $1.3 billion in federal loan guarantees for the purchase of
American food and manufactured goods.
   He also promised to provide emergency medical supplies to the
Soviets and dispatch a team of U.S. experts to provide technical
advice on ways to unclog the Soviet food distribution system.
   While Bush's announcement represented the biggest package the
administration has been willing to come up with so far, it stopped
far short of the hefty direct financial assistance that some
European countries, notably Germany, are providing to the Soviets.
   The $1.3 billion in credit guarantees is not a direct
expenditure by the U.S. government. Instead, the government is
promising to stand behind the loans that commercial banks make to
the Soviets to finance the purchase of American farm and
manufactured products.
   As part of the aid package, Bush also directed Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady to present a proposal to the IMF and the
World Bank to grant the Soviets the status of a ``special
associate'' at the two giant multinational lending institutions.
   That designation falls far short of the full membership the
Soviets covet. Only full members of the IMF and the World Bank
qualify for the billions of dollars in loans the two institutions
make each year.
   But the administration argued that the designation of ``special
associate'' would serve as an important way-station for the Soviets
and did not preclude their admission as full members of the two
organizations later.
   In the meantime, the initial ties with the IMF and the World
Bank would allow the Soviets to tap the considerable expertise the
two agencies have in a variety of financial areas such as how to
establish a stable currency system.
   ``There is a tremendous experience and education gap and we hope
this will fill that gap,'' the Treasury official said.
   While the initial reaction among other Western countries has
been favorable to the U.S. proposals, the Treasury official said
more consultations would be necessary before putting the plan into
operation.
   But he indicated the details should be wrapped up fairly
quickly, possibly at an expected meeting in January of Brady and
finance ministers from the six other major industrialized
countries.

<HEAD>Deal Struck to Send First American Cosmonaut Into Space</HEAD>

   Expect to read one day soon that a U.S.
company will pay millions of dollars to the Soviet Union for the
privilege of having an American ride to the space station Mir.
   The deal has been made, say two officials of Space Commerce
Corp. in Houston, which markets Soviet space services in the United
States. But they won't identify the company, or how much was paid,
or why.
   The contract and its purpose - and the name of the American
cosmonaut-to-be - wasn't supposed to be revealed until January. But
the weekly newspaper Space News printed sketchy details Monday.
   Space News said only that the unknown company's cost will be
more than the $12 million paid by the Tokyo Broadcasting Service to
the Glavkosmos space agency for Japanese journalist Toyohiro
Akiyama's ride.
   ``We executed a contract with NPO Energia, which is the manned
part of the Soviet space program,'' said Art Dula, one of the Space
Commerce Corp. officials. But, he said, the contract forbids him
from saying any more.
   The Soviets - for a hefty price - have transported passengers of
a variety of nationalities to their space station for stays of
varying duration. They have included a Frenchman, a Cuban, an East
German, and Japan's Akiyama.
   But there's never been an American.
   Dula's associate, Bill Wirin of Colorado Springs, Colo., said
Space Commerce Corp. signed the deal in Moscow on Nov. 30.
   ``Our company policy is that we never discuss what we are doing
without approval from our partners,'' he said.
   Wirin called the contract ``another sign of the warming
relationship between the Soviets and the United States on a
commercial basis, at a time when the U.S. is talking about giving
them food.''
   Wirin, like Dula, said he'd like to say more. But he referred
calls to Brown, Nelson and Associates, a Houston public relations
company.
   ``This company has a big announcement to make, but the plan was
to make that announcement in January,'' said Guy Brown, one of the
principals in the company.
   ``The client doesn't want to be disclosed by name. It's an
American company. I'd like to disclose more, but I'm under a
restriction from them,'' he said.
   Brown said the unidentified company would select the American
cosmonaut.
   ``One check has passed hands, probably earnest money,'' Brown
said. ``It's pretty much a fait accompli.''

<HEAD>Coppola's Long-Awaited `Godfather III' Goes Before the Critics</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It's coming out over budget, behind schedule
and 16 years after its predecessor, but Paramount executives are
betting ``The Godfather Part III'' will be a movie audiences can't
refuse.
   After a frantic month of round-the-clock editing and polishing,
the final film in Francis Ford Coppola's Mafia trilogy was unveiled
Wednesday to critics and movie theater owners in New York, San
Francisco, Los Angeles and other key markets across the country.
   The response was mixed. Disappointment ran higher among New York
viewers, while those who watched in Los Angeles applauded.
   The movie will open on Christmas Day on 1,800 screens in the
United States and Canada. It originally was scheduled for a
Thanksgiving release, but was moved back because of production
delays.
   For a while, it was uncertain whether ``Godfather III'' would be
released at all this year. Paramount Pictures, gunning for the
lucrative holiday market, decided to rush it out at the end of the
year after Chairman Frank Mancuso and other executives saw a rough
cut in October.
   ``Without question, this is the one everybody's talking about,''
said John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. ``Ever
since `Dick Tracy,' all the talk has been about `Godfather.'''
   With preview screenings held this week, the movie qualifies for
this year's award consideration from the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences and Los Angeles Film Critics Association.
   The $58 million film - triple the industry's average cost - was
burdened with problems throughout production. Real-life lovers Al
Pacino and Diane Keaton, reprising their roles as Michael and Kay
Corleone, split up during the filming. Rising star Winona Ryder
(``Edward Scissorhands'') was unable to co-star as Michael's
love-struck daughter because of exhaustion.
   She was replaced at the last minute by Coppola's daughter Sofia,
who had never had a major film role before.
   The first two ``Godfather'' films are considered masterpieces of
American cinema and either made or solidified the careers of some
of today's leading actors, including Pacino, Keaton, Robert De
Niro, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Talia Shire.
   The first ``Godfather'' made $133.7 million in 1972 and its 1974
sequel had ticket sales of $45.5 million. Both films won best
picture and screenplay Oscars; Marlon Brando won the Academy Award
for best actor in the first installment; and Coppola (for
directing) and Robert De Niro (supporting actor) won Oscars for the
second.
   In the latest sequel, set in 1979, Michael Corleone attempts to
bury his gangland roots but realizes, ``Just when I thought I was
out, they pull me back in.''
   Despite a $100 million gift to the Catholic Church and induction
into an honorary church order, Michael soon finds himself plotting
Vatican politics and Sicilian executions.
   In a climactic scene filmed during a performance of the opera
``Cavalleria Rusticana'' at Italy's historic Teatro Massimo opera
house, Coppola intercuts between the melodious performance and
grisly murders.
   Reviewers in New York were largely critical of ``Godfather
III,'' complaining that at two hours and 42 minutes it was too long
and that it lacked a hard edge and keen focus. Its ending, meant to
evoke feelings of tragedy, was greeted with laughter.
   But Los Angeles critics applauded robustly as the final credits
rolled. Movie exhibitors who saw a separate screening generally
expressed satisfaction.
   ``The consensus is it's a very satisfying sequel to the two
previous `Godfathers,''' said Dan Harkins of Harkins Amusement
Enterprises, which will show the film in Arizona theaters. ``But
I'm not sure it's as brilliant as the first one.''
   Paramount, which has had an up-and-down year at the box office,
is counting on ``Godfather III'' to deliver a hefty share of
holiday ticket sales.
   Other recent films by Coppola, including ``Tucker: The Man and
His Dream'' and ``One From the Heart,'' were flops.
   Such 1990 Paramount releases as ``Another 48 HRS.'' and ``The
Two Jakes'' also performed badly, but Paramount's ``Ghost'' has
been the year's biggest moneymaker, collecting more than $200
million to date.

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Stocks Down Slightly in Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Prices fell moderately on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
Friday while the dollar firmed against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 293.47 points, or 1.19
percent, to settle at 24,349.50 points by the close of trading at 3
p.m. (1 a.m. EST).
   The dollar settled at 131.87 yen, up .57 yen from Thursday's
close. The currency opened at 132.09 yen and ranged between 131.82
yen and 132.15 yen.
   In bond dealings, the price of benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds was 87.61, down from Thursday's close of
87.82. The yield was 7.145 percent, compared with 7.100 percent
Thursday.
   Traders described the decline in stock prices as a correction
after a gain over the past seven trading days of 2,780.36 points,
or 12.7 percent, in the Nikkei index, the Tokyo market's main
barometer.
   Thursday's trading brought the index above 24,000 points for the
first time in nearly six weeks.
   ``Yesterday, it went up too much,'' said Amy Yip, manager of
sales for Baring Securities.
   Traders earlier attributed the recent bullish market to optimism
about the possibility of averting war in the Middle East. Lower
crude oil prices and interest rates have also encouraged investors.
   The correction Friday might also prevent the market from
becoming too ``tired'' to put on a strong rally toward the end of
the year, Yip said.
   Weakness in Friday's stock, currency and bond markets also
reflected some returning fears that the gulf crisis will not be as
easy to solve as market players hoped at the beginning of the week,
she said.
   Action on the currency market is ``very quiet,'' said Minori
Takeuchi in the Chemical Bank currency dealing department.
   ``Market players are sidelined,'' she said, because of the
upcoming holiday season, and because market factors are ``mixed.''
   Buyers are shying away from the dollar, fearing that it will
weaken because of the lagging U.S. economy, while renewed fears of
war in the Middle East have dimmed the attractiveness of the yen,
she said.

   President Bush lit the national Christmas tree
with a special welcome for the recently returned hostages and a
prayer for those still in the Persian Gulf area.
   ``We feel pride thinking of our young men and women standing
strong in the harsh distant deserts and on the waters of the
Persian Gulf,'' the president said. ``And we think of their parents
and their loved ones ... and we join them in praying for their safe
return.''
   The president was joined at Thursday's celebration around the
35-foot blue spruce by his wife Barbara and several Bush
grandchildren. Five of the seven newly released hostages who met
with Bush earlier in the day also attended.
   ``As we gather here, we're doing what generations before us have
done, watching our national Christmas tree become a brilliant
symbol of hope, of peace and of compassion for all the world,'' the
president said as he illuminated the tree.
   The National Park Service estimated that about 15,000 people
watched the ceremony on an unusually warm evening in the capital.
   The national Christmas tree is a living tree transplanted to its
permanent spot in the Ellipse in 1978.
   The theme for this year's ``Pageant of Peace'' national
Christmas tree celebration is discovery. Four thousand lights
decorate the tree and a white star shines from the top.
   Surrounding the tree are 57 smaller trees representing each
state and territory, a tradition since 1981. For the first time
this year, the trees were grown on land from a reclaimed mine in an
effort by the Park Service to demonstrate the use of recycled land.
   Presidents have been lighting the nation's tree in the Ellipse
just south of the White House every year except two since Calvin
Coolidge first threw the switch in 1923.
   In 1979, President Carter ordered that the tree remain dark to
honor Americans hostages being held in Iran. In 1980, the tree was
lighted for only 417 seconds - one second for each day the hostages
had been in captivity.

   USA Today officials are considering publishing
a weekly tabloid about baseball.
   The decision will come by the end of the year, Tom Curley,
president and chief operating officer of USA Today, said Thursday.
   He said a task force is looking into the possibility of such a
publication, with the tentative title USA Today Baseball Weekly.
   If the company decides to proceed with the publication, it would
be launched during spring training, preceding the 1991 baseball
season.
   The tabloid would provide more statistics than can be published
in the regular sports section of the five-day-a-week national
newspaper, Curley said.
   ``It's a bit too soon to tell'' what else might be in the paper,
Curley said.
   ``There is an opportunity to provide more depth in all sorts of
basic sports coverage, from viewing to aarticipating to
statistics,'' he said.
   James Goss, a newspaper business analyst at the New York
investment firm of Dustin Phelps, said sports coverage is
considered one of USA Today's strong points and the weekly would
provide ``a way to get some more mileage out of what they are
putting together anyway for the newspaper.''
   Goss said also that The National, the New York-based daily
sports paper launched in a number of markets beginning last
January, might be cutting into USA Today markets and this could be
a factor in the decision.
   Curley, however, said, ``That's old news by now.'' He said the
tabloid, if it is launched, might provide USA Today with ``a sixth
day, in effect.''
   Executives at The National could not be reached immediately.
   The task force will be headed by Thomas J. Farrell, executive
vice president and general manager for USA Today, assisted by Gene
Policinski, the newspaper's managing editor for sports.
   ``Seeing the reaction to our daily newspaper, there seems to be
a strong demand for more statistical information regarding the
nation's pastime,'' Farrell said. ``In looking at USA Today
Baseball Weekly, we'd like to become to USA Today's sports section
what Barron's is to The Wall Street Journal.''
   Policinski said, ``We feel there is a real market in the
hard-core baseball fan for to satisfy an appetite for statistics
that has not been filled.''
   USA Today, published by Gannett Inc., says it has a circulation
of some 1.8 million in the United States. It also has an
international edition.

   Yakov Smirnoff, the Soviet-born comedian who

doing what he can to ease the food shortage gripping the Soviet
Union.
   Smirnoff joined with members of the CARE charity organization
Thursday in putting together a package of tuna fish, chicken, soap

   The naturalized American citizen said that although his homeland
has more freedom now than when he left in 1978, the economy has
declined.
   ``The Soviet people are inspired by the freedoms they are
getting, but unfortunately, the food shortages have gotten worse,''
Smirnoff said.
   ``We used to stay in lines all the time. Now they don't because

   NEW YORK (AP) - Former ballerina Shenikwa Dawn Nowlin said she
was overwhelmed with pain and often considered killing herself
after she was paralyzed in a car crash involving former Yankee
infielder Andre Robertson.
   ``I became almost irrational,'' Nowlin, now a Dallas prosecutor,
testified in state Supreme Court on Thursday. ``I was afraid I was
going to die. Then I was afraid someone was trying to kill me. ...
it was horrible.
   ``I thought many times about killing myself,'' she said as she
fought back tears.
   Nowlin, 31, has filed a $20 million lawsuit against New York
City, saying the car she was riding in on Aug. 18, 1983, crashed on
the Henry Hudson Parkway because a sign warning of a sharp curve
was improperly placed. Robertson, who was driving the car, is named
as a defendant in the lawsuit.
   The two testified separately Friday that the warning sign was
posted in the middle of the curve.
   ``Where I live they usually give you some warning to stop a
car,'' said Robertson who now lives in Orange, Texas.

   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - A country club, golf course and recording
studio owned by Willie Nelson are going on the auction block two
days after Christmas to help pay $16.7 million in back taxes the
country music star owes.
   Internal Revenue Service spokeswoman Sally Sassen said it is
likely that other Nelson property will go on sale after the first
of the year.
   The IRS confiscated property Nelson owns in Colorado, Washington
and Alabama last month.
   Nelson, 57, has said his tax problems were caused by a former
manager's poor handling of his finances.
   Friends and fans have raised several thousand dollars on
Nelson's behalf in recent weeks.
   Earlier this month more than 300 people paid $10 each to attend
a benefit dance at the Broken Spoke, a South Austin nightclub where
Nelson often performed in the 1960s.

   Cavazos, 63, the first Hispanic-American Cabinet secretary, was
fired by President Bush, who gave him until the end of the month to
quit, according to White House sources who insisted upon anonymity.
Cavazos resigned Wednesday.
   College spokesman David Hall said Thursday there were no plans
to cancel the speech.
   ``We've had this planned for over a year now,'' he said. ``We're
in touch with him and he's going to continue to fulfill his

   European Community leaders gathered today for a
summit aimed at launching the trading bloc on the road to a
federated Europe. Britain, the prime objector, is in a more
conciliatory mood since the resignation of Margaret Thatcher.
   The 12 leaders beginning their two-day meeting today in the
flag-bedecked Italian Parliament also will consider granting a $2.4
billion aid package to the Soviet Union and increased help to other
East European countries.
   The Europeans received a new exhortation from President Bush to
stand firm on the Persian Gulf crisis.
   In a letter Thursday to Italian Premier Giulio Andreotti,
current holder of the rotating summit chairmanship, Bush said
Iraq's blanket release of foreign hostages should not lessen
pressure on Iraq to pull out of Kuwait.
   ``We must continue to maintain a very rigid attitude,'' Bush
said, according to Italian officials.
   British Prime Minister John Major, who succeeded Mrs. Thatcher
Nov. 28 and is virtually unknown to the other summiteers, joined
them at the opera for a performance of ``Tosca'' on Thursday night.
   Major, 47, was holding separate prior talks with Andreotti,
Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers and German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl.
   Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand are pressing for
economic union and a single currency, perhaps by the year 2000, and
for a form of political union that would strip member nations of
many sovereign powers.
   Major, keen to avoid a repeat of the Britain-versus-the-rest
showdown that helped topple Mrs. Thatcher after the summit in Rome
in October, was optimistic despite Britain's continued opposition
to key unity proposals, his aides said.
   ``We see ways in which significant progress can be made,'' a
senior British source said Thursday night.
   ``But there are areas where we will reaffirm our positions quite
clearly, including our opposition to having a single currency
imposed upon us,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, on Thursday urged
the 12 EC heads of state to work on restarting talks to liberalize
world trade.
   The global trade negotiations broke down in Brussels last week,
in part due to the EC's refusal to cut farm subsidies enough to
satisfy the United States. The talks are to resume at a lower level
next month in Geneva.
   Soviet aid, which topped the agenda of this summit, was given
fresh impetus by the U.S. decision Wednesday to give the Soviet
Union $1 billion in loan guarantees to buy American farm products
and manufactured goods.
   Andreotti's spokesman, Pio Mastrobuoni, said he was confident of
agreement, despite some arguments that the Soviet Union needs help
in managing its huge resources, including distributing its harvest,
rather than handouts and loans it will have trouble repaying.
   On financial union, Andreotti cornered Mrs. Thatcher at the
October summit by getting the others to agree to establish a single
central banking system - the prelude to one currency - by January
1994. Mrs. Thatcher objected loudly.
   In a change of tone, Major planned to argue the British
alternative of a European currency that would circulate alongside
the 12 existing currencies, without ruling out an eventual sole
currency.
   On political union, Britain has shifted toward French and German
proposals for giving the EC a formal role in security.
   And aides said Major was confident Britain will not be alone in
opposing other proposals that would give the community far-reaching
powers over issues ranging from health, social policy and education
to taxation and transport.
   The EC nations are Italy, France, Britain, Ireland, Spain,
Portugal, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Greece, Denmark and
Germany.

<HEAD>Boschwitz Admits Interest in Agriculture Post</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Rudy Boschwitz has ruled out several
administration jobs but says he has found one post he'd like. The
only trouble is it isn't vacant.
   The Minnesota Republican, who lost to Democrat Paul Wellstone in
the November election, said Thursday he would be interested in
becoming secretary of agriculture should Clayton Yeutter leave that
position.
   ``I might very well consider that,'' Boschwitz said in a session
with reporters from his home state.
   Boschwitz said the high point of his 12-year Senate career was
his work on farm issues.
   Yeutter has denied rumors that he plans to return to private
business now that the five-year farm bill has been completed and
international trade talks have collapsed.
   Boschwitz said he planned to call Yeutter to tell him he was not
trying to take over the job.
   ``I don't want people to feel I'm breathing down their neck,''
Boschwitz said. ``I don't expect him to step down.''
   Boschwitz met with President Bush on Tuesday to talk about his
future plans. Bush has some major vacancies to fill, but Boschwitz
said he would not be a candidate for any of them.
   Boschwitz said he was not qualified to be education secretary
and might not be confirmed by the Senate as labor secretary. The
chairmanship of the Republican National Committee also is open, but
Boschwitz said that slot did not interest him.

<HEAD>AIDS-Infected Cells May Poison Brain, Causing Mental Confusion,
Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New laboratory studies suggest that some types
of cells infected with the AIDS virus may release a poison that
disrupts thinking processes and causes the mental decline seen in
70 percent of AIDS patients.
   ``We've found that one class of cells when infected (with the
AIDS virus) will release a toxin that can disrupt the nervous
system,'' said Dr. Dana Giulian, a researcher at the Baylor College
of Medicine in Houston.
   A research paper on the discovery is to be published today in
the journal Science.
   In an interview, Giulian said test tube experiments showed that
monocytes, an immune system cell in the blood, will secrete poison
molecules when infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, or
HIV, which causes AIDS.
   When these molecules were exposed to neurons, it would cause the
nerve cells to either die or stop functioning, Giulian said.
   This suggests, said the researcher, that similar cells in the
brain, called macrophages, could react the same way when infected
by HIV. Guilian said the finding must be confirmed by further
research.
   Physicians and scientists have long been puzzled as to why AIDS
patients develop mental decline.
   The toxin secreted by the infected cells could be the answer.
   Giulian said the next job is to identify the secreted molecule
that is toxic to the brain. This, he said, may be a difficult job.
   Giulian's coauthors of the Science report were Ken Vaca and
Christine A. Noonan, also of Baylor.
   Science is the journal of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.

<HEAD>Movie Association Official Top Paid Lobbyist in Washington</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fulltime top executives at trade and
professional associations that lobby in Washington earned an
average of $202,767 last year, a magazine reported.
   Topping the list was Jack Valenti of the Motion Picture
Association at $672,590, the magazine National Journal said
Thursday.
   Like many other executives in the survey, he is chief Washington
lobbyist for the people he represents.
   The magazine said its survey was based primarily on Internal
Revenue Service records. It said the figures given excluded
benefits and expense allowances.
   They showed that the average top salary was $146,659 at labor
unions, $133,336 at research organizations and $102,254 at interest
groups, those not representing a specific industry.
   Ranking second to Valenti in pay among trade and professional
association officials was James H. Sammons, executive vice
president of the American Medical Association, who earned $623,167.
He has since been replaced by James S. Todd, who makes $411,000.
   Jason S. Berman, president of the Recording Industry Association
of America, was third at $551,731.
   The highest paid labor executive was William J. McCarthy,
president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, at
$283,145.
   Among executives of research organizations, Edwin J. Feulner
Jr., president of the Heritage Foundation, was in first place at
$258,721.
   Horace Deets, executive director of the American Association of
Retired Persons, was the highest paid among representatives of
interest groups, earning $220,000.

   Despite the surge in oil prices since
Iraq invaded Kuwait, OPEC isn't about to give up its efforts to
secure high revenues.
   ``All the countries need money now,'' OPEC President Sadek
Boussena said Thursday at the end of the cartel's winter strategy
session.
   During the two-day meeting, the ministers of the 13-nation
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to continue
pumping extra oil to meet any shortfall during the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   But Saudi Arabia and the other OPEC members also agreed to cut
production once the crisis ends. In doing so, officials hope to
avoid a sharp drop in prices that would hurt their struggling
economies.
   Following the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, OPEC agreed to
suspend its quota system and increase pumping to make up for 4
million barrels of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude kept off the
international market by a U.N. embargo.
   Current OPEC production is around 23 million barrels a day and
unlikely to go much higher.
   ``We are producing more or less at the maximum level,'' said
Boussena.
   Oil prices rallied Thursday, moving up about $1 per barrel to
$26.42 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, as traders renewed
their focus on the possibility of war in the gulf. Oil was around
$20 a barrel just before the crisis.
   Higher prices during the crisis have brought millions of dollars
into the coffers of oil producers. Some OPEC members, such as
Algeria, Nigeria and Ecuador, badly need the money to support their
impoverished economies.
   Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest oil producer, has contributed much
of its windfall to nations suffering from the economic impact of
the gulf crisis. Some of the money has also been used to help pay
for the U.S.-led multinational force stationed on Saudi soil.
   Boussena, who is Algeria's mines minister, hinted the cartel
might consider lifting its target price above $21 a barrel after
the crisis.
   Last July, for the first time since 1986, the ministers raised
the benchmark price from $19 a barrel.
   ``I am certain people need more money. It is clear. It is stated
by all of us,'' said Boussena.
   After Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, oil prices for a time topped
$40 on fears that an outbreak of war in the gulf could cut off
crude oil supplies.
   Analysts say OPEC's aggressive production during the gulf crisis
could lead to a glut on the market next year - and plunging prices.
   Peter Bogin, associate director for oil markets at Cambridge
Energy Research Associates in Paris, predicted that at winter's
end, crude prices could slide below $20 a barrel.
   Demand for crude has eased because of the slumping American
economy and warmer-than-expected weather in the United States and
other consuming nations.
   Moreover, industrialized nations have been filling their storage
tanks to prepare for possible war and an oil cut off in the Gulf.
   OPEC members are: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.

<HEAD>Police Suspect Two Women in Possible Serial Killings in Florida</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IKE FLORES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Investigators are considering the unusual
possibility that two female serial killers are responsible for the
shooting deaths of eight middle-aged male motorists and
disappearances of two others in the past year.
   Authorities are reluctant to say publicly the deaths are
related. But they did distribute composite drawings of two women
wanted for questioning.
   All the known victims were white, roughly between the ages of 40
and 60. All were shot, some repeatedly. Some were stripped naked
and robbed, their bodies dumped along rural roads.
   One victim's body was found in southern Georgia, the rest in
various places around the northern half of Florida. The first body
was found a year ago Thursday.
   Two missing men also may be part of the bloody chain. Their
abandoned cars have been recovered. One vehicle, belonging to a
part-time missionary, had traces of blood in it.
   The suspects last were seen leaving an accident involving the
missionary's car on the Fourth of July.
   ``We're not 100 percent sure all the homicides are related,''
said Capt. Steve Binegar of the Marion County Sheriff's Department,
the lead investigator.
   ``The main thing that links them together are the profiles of
the victims: They are all similar,'' he said. Serial killers are
``certainly a possibility we can't discount.''
   ``Robbery appears to be part of the motive. But some of the
bodies were nude, leading to all kinds of conjecture,'' Binegar
said. ``I'll say this: It doesn't appear that they (the killer or
killers) would be able to support themselves with the money
stolen.''
   If the killings are related and the killers are women, the
criminals would be highly unusual, sociologists and psychologists
say. Female serial killers are extremely rare.
   ``Women who kill usually do so with people they know,'' said
Richard Hollinger, a University of Florida sociology professor.
   Reconstructed police renderings of the suspects show an
oval-faced, stringy-haired blonde and a chubby, round-faced,
dark-complexioned woman wearing a baseball-type cap.
   The women were seen leaving an accident scene July 4 on a county
road near Orange Springs, 35 miles east of Gainesville, not far
from Interstate 75. Their car evidently missed a curve, ran through
a fence and tore down a gate.
   The women abandoned the car. It later was traced to the missing
missionary, Peter Siems, 65, of Jupiter.
   Witnesses described the blonde woman as about 5-foot-8, 25 to 30
years old, wearing blue jeans and a white T-shirt, with a tattoo on
her right arm, possibly in the shape of a heart. The other woman
was described as about 5-foot-4, weighing 175 to 200 pounds and
wearing a cap or a hat.
   A pattern in the killings emerged slowly because the victims'
bodies were discovered in widely scattered areas.
   The first victim found was Richard Mallory, who owned an
electronics repair shop in Clearwater. His body was found under a
scrap of carpet near Interstate 95, north of Daytona Beach.
   Three victims were found near Ocala in Marion County, another in
neighboring Citrus County, in northern central Florida.
   Another victim was found in June in Pasco County, about 20 miles
north of Tampa. Another was discovered in May in Adel, Ga., along
Interstate 75 about 40 miles north of the Florida line.
   The latest victim added to the list of possibly connected
slayings is Gino Antonio, 60, of Cocoa. Hunters found his body last
month in the Dixie County woods near Cross City, about 120 miles
north of St. Petersburg. He was nude except for socks.
   Also, a car belonging to a missing Kennedy Space Center engineer
was found in a shopping center near Orlando International Airport
in September.
   Binegar said no formal investigative team has been formed, but
his office is coordinating information gathered from other police
agencies and sending it to the FBI.

<HEAD>Stocks Down, Dollar Up in Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices were down slightly on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange today, while year-end demand for dollars pushed the United
States currency up against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 293.47 points, or 1.19
percent, to settle at 24,349.50 points by the 3 p.m. (1 a.m. EST)
close. Estimated volume on the first section was heavy, with 800
million shares trading hands.
   Today's fall combined a rush of year-end transactions with
``unwinding selling from arbitrage trading'' after the surges of
the last seven trading days, said Satoshi Hirasawa, an analyst for
Kokusai Securities.
   Volume surged in the morning before special quotations were
issued by the Tokyo Stock Exchange this morning for futures and
options for December delivery, traders said.
   Traders also said the market is positioning itself for the
traditional December rally.
   ``Gradually the market is taking on a much better tone. But it
could turn at any point (if) a sudden weakness of the yen''
triggers profit-taking on long positions, said Darrel Whitten, an
analyst at Prudential Bache Securities.
   The Bank of Japan has not yet seen enough of a slowdown in the
economy to bring interest rates down considerably, and is still
fighting the inflationary effects of high oil prices and the labor
shortage, he said.
   High interest rates probably will continue to firm the yen
against the dollar until the end of the year, and interest rates
will continue to lead stock market action, he said.
   On currency markets, ``nothing much is happening,'' said Gary
Lee, Citibank's chief currency dealer.
   The dollar settled at 131.87 yen, up .57 yen from Thursday's
close. The currency opened at 132.09 yen, and trading ranged
between 131.82 yen and 132.15 yen.
   Trading by companies that are closing their books or have a
special need of dollars, such as oil companies facing high-priced
oil supplies, is helping keep the dollar above 130 yen despite
falling interest rates and continued weakness in the United States
economy, he said.
   In bond dealings, the price of benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds was 87.61 at 3 p.m., down from Thursday's
close of 87.82. Their yield was 7.145 percent, compared with 7.100
percent Thursday.

<TEXT>
   Most college graduates should have a slightly
harder time landing a job in 1991 than their counterparts did this
year, according to an annual survey of the nation's businesses.
   But engineers will be in demand, and people with master's
degrees will be hired at a 25 percent higher rate than 1990,
according to the 45th annual Lindquist-Endicott Report released
Thursday.
   The report found that businesses plan to hire 1 percent fewer
graduates overall because of concerns over the recession,
inflation, the federal budget deficit and the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The report also found that a job applicant's lack of knowledge
about the company is the biggest ``turnoff'' for recruiters.
   ``The market is going to be more competitive. The students are
going to have to work harder and be more creative and imaginative,
but the jobs are going to be there. They're just going to be more
difficult to uncover,'' said Victor R. Lindquist, director of
placement at Northwestern University.
   Accountants, teachers and health care professionals will be in
great demand in a few years, Lindquist said at a news conference.
   The highest average starting salary - $43,200 - will go to job
applicants with MBA degrees, the report said.
   Employers plan to increase starting salaries at a rate averaging
4.4 percent, the same as last year's increase but below the yearly
inflation rate, the report said.
   Lindquist said 61 percent of the 320 surveyed companies,
covering a wide range of industries, expect business to stay the
same or decline. He said 39 percent believe business will improve.
Also, nearly one-third of the companies did worse in 1990 than in
1989, he indicated.
   ``Some grads will be working in jobs with less status, salary or
prestige, but I've always found that it's still better to be in the
ballpark than out in left field,'' Lindquist said.

<HEAD>General Assembly Calls For Peace Conference, Halt to Aid to Israel</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Gulf-Freed Hostages, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The General Assembly has urged member
nations to halt all aid to Israel over its occupation of Arab
territories and called anew for a peace conference on the
Palestinian issue.
   The United States voted against the measures Thursday night
after its representative Jack Stein complained to the assembly that
``such divisive language does not promote the cause of peace.''
   The assembly adopted the measures by wide margins.
   The United States has been struggling to remove language
endorsing a Mideast peace conference from a draft resolution of the
more influential U.N. Security Council, fearing it would look like
a concession to Iraq.
   Israel, a traditional U.S. ally, vehemently opposes any such
conference. A U.S. veto of the proposal could jeopardize the
tenuous Arab coalition the United States has aligned against Iraq,
which has championed the Palestinian call for a homeland since it
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   A Security Council vote on the resolution has been put off six
times in a week. Another one is tentatively planned for Monday.
   Cuban Ambassador Ricardo Alarcon, in rallying the assembly to
endorse a peace conference, declared, ``There is a need for a
comprehensive peace in the Middle East based on the withdrawal of
Israeli from the occupied territories.''
   The resolution endorsing a peace conference was adopted 99 to 19
with 32 abstentions. Israel, the United States and several European
nations were among those voting against it.
   The resolution also condemned ``Israel's aggression'' against
the Palestinians and declared that U.S. military and economic aid
has ``encouraged Israel to pursue its aggressive and expansionist
policies'' in the occupied lands.
   It also declared that strategic U.S.-Israeli cooperation has
``had adverse effects on efforts for the establishment of a
comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East.''
   Stein protested that ``the United States remains firmly
supportive of efforts to achieve a comprehensive peace,'' but added
that ``the shape of a final settlement cannot be dictated by any
party in advance.''
   The General Assembly adopted another resolution condemning
Israeli occupation and called on member states ``to put an end to
the flow to Israel of any military, economic, financial and
technological aid.''
   Stein said a call to halt aid to Israel was ``unacceptable'' and
objected to the ``critical reference to the United States'' in the
clause on U.S.-Israeli cooperation.
   The assembly also passed resolutions declaring Israeli
administration of Jerusalem ``illegal'' and calling for greater
cooperation between the United Nations and the Arab League.
   Israel seized the Gaza Strip from Egypt and the West Bank,
including east Jerusalem, from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.

<HEAD>Mystery Surrounds Former East German Foreign Trade Boss</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A mysterious former East German official, whose
alleged gun running and other business deals kept the Communist
government supplied with Western cash, is the central figure in a
high-level probe in newly unified Germany.
   Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski, the former East German boss of
foreign trade, fled to the West when the hard-line regime collapsed
a year ago. His activities are now making headlines because of
allegations that the new government gave him refuge.
   Various German news reports have described him as living in a
Bavarian villa or visiting a CIA debriefing center in the United
States. Schalck reportedly held the rank of lieutenant general in
the East German secret police, in addition to his foreign trade
post, before finding refuge in the West.
   Berlin prosecutors, acting on tips from eastern investigators,
launched an investigation of Schalck on suspicion of corruption and
gun running. But they are having difficulty finding any
incriminating documents.
   Seventy police officers searched 15 locations around Germany on
Monday for evidence that could link Schalck to $162 million missing
from East German coffers.
   Authorities said they failed to uncover information about
foreign bank accounts rumored to have been set up by Schalck in
Switzerland.
   As chief of East Germany's foreign trade, Schalck supervised
sales of export goods that produced Western revenues sorely needed
by the Communist government.
   He is suspected of using a household goods factory near Rostock
as a cover for exporting weapons to countries in South America,
Africa and the Middle East.
   Another allegation is that Schalck helped former East German
economic czar Guenther Mittag finance a new house with money
generated from government business.
   Schalck's current whereabouts are unclear.
   Lutz Stavenhagen, the Bonn chancellery official in charge of
German intelligence, told a news conference Wednesday that federal
intelligence agents had questioned Schalck several times this year.
   However, Stavenhagen denied Schalck is living under protection
of the intelligence agency and added: ``I don't know where he is.''
   Citing unidentified sources, Stern magazine said Schalck went to
the United States with Bonn's knowledge to provide information to
the Central Intelligence Agency.
   But Schalck's lawyer, Peter Danckert, said in a television
interview Wednesday that his client was at a villa in Bavaria.
Danckert also rejected allegations of wrongdoing against his
client.
   The collapse of East Germany and its merger with West Germany on
Oct. 3 did nothing to allay suspicions that Schalck retained
control of a corrupt financial empire.
   There is also speculation that he was able to exploit his ties
to officials in Bonn for his own benefit.
   Stern this week described a so-called ``Bonn connection'' that
allegedly arranged for Schalck to evade East German criminal
charges during last year's political revolution.
   Stern said West German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble
intervened when East German criminal police were closing in on
Schalck last December. Schaeuble denied the magazine's allegations.
   As the East German government's envoy for business dealings with
the West, Schalck met many of the top political players in Bonn.
   He disappeared while on an official visit to West Germany on
Dec. 2, 1989. Four days later, he surfced in West Berlin where he
turned himself over to police.
   Schalck remained in a West Berlin jail for one month until West
German police set him free, denying an East German extradition
request on the grounds he could not get a fair trial there.
   While other leading party officials sweated out the revolution
in jail or under house arrest, Schalck soon found himself living in
a villa on a lake near Munich.
   Schalck's phone number is unlisted, and he has not spoken to
news reporters since the case began dominating German news reports
a few weeks ago.
   After the downfall of East Germany's hard-line leaders in autumn
1989, reformist Communists targeted Schalck and other former top
officials for corruption charges.
   The allegations were applauded by East Germans who were shocked
by revelations about the handsome homes used by senior Communist
party officials.
   Schalck was always listed among these officials.

   Prince Johannes von Thurn und Taxis, one
of Europe's richest men, died today, a spokesman for a Munich
hospital said. He was 64.
   The prince, whose accestors founded the German postal system
nearly 500 years ago, had recently received a second heart
transplant.
   Dietmar Schmidt, a spokesman for the Munich University hospital,
said the prince had died of complications resulting from the second
transplant.
   The prince's financial empire included huge amounts of land as
well as breweries and art collections. Experts have valued his
wealth at at least $1.3 billion.

   The government's human rights commission says
the top anti-drug agency has been the target of scores of
complaints, and the panel is recommending firing and prosecuting
agents accused of involvement in rights abuses.
   ``My government does not hide abuses,'' President Carlos Salinas
de Gortari told reporters as he accepted the 400-page report
Thursday from his National Human Rights Commission.
   He vowed to ``to continue fighting crime, eradicating (official)
impunity and putting all efforts toward the most strict respect for
human rights.''
   The president noted that his government has banned prosecutions
based on confessions, a step taken due to complaints that police
routinely torture defendants into making false confessions.
   Commission President Jorge Carpizo said his agency had dealt
with 1,343 complaints, ranging from murder and torture to unjust
loss of housing. He said it has finished 397 cases since Salinas
had inaugurated it on June 6.
   The report said the federal attorney general's office and the
judicial police under its control were accused of 171 cases of
rights violations, nearly three times as many as those filed
against any other agency.
   Ten of the 33 recommendations for action issued by the
commission also were directed against the federal police. No other
agency received more than one.
   Many of the recommendations urged firing and prosecuting agents
accused of involvement in human rights abuses.
   The Federal Judicial Police are Mexico's main narcotics-fighting
agency and the primary partner of U.S. drug enforcement agents
attempting to block the international flow of drugs.
   Salinas vowed that his fight against drug traffic ``has been
unconditional and definitive. We will not permit this threat to
remain against the society nor against the state.
   ``But at the same time, neither will we tolerate it becoming a
pretext for injuring the rights, none of them, of people.''
   On Sunday, the president ordered the attorney general's office
to release an opposition party mayor who had been jailed since May
on what the rights commission termed false drug charges.
   The president had also vowed to prosecute eight federal drug
agents accused of involvement in the shooting deaths of six people
earlier this month.
   Other leading targets of complaints were the prosecutor's
offices in the capital and states, as well as the federal prison
service.
   The report said illegal arrest was the most common complaint,
followed by torture, homicide, abuse of authority, threats,
injuries and false accusation.
   From the reports, ``it can be deduced that Mexico has problems
in the complete observance of human rights, which it could not hide
if it wanted to,'' Carpizo said.
   But he added that ``if the problems are recognized, it is
because there is political will to resolve them, and they are going
to be resolved ... Not to do it ... would be suicide.''

<HEAD>Judge to Rule on Whether Comatose Woman's Feeding Tube Can Be

   The parents of a woman who has been
comatose for seven years awaited a ruling today on whether the
feeding tube keeping her alive should be removed.
   Nancy Cruzan's father, Joe, said late Thursday he planned to be
with his daughter when Probate Judge Charles E. Teel Jr. announced
his decision this afternoon.
   ``You know, it's strange. I don't feel very emotional,'' he
said. ``I just kind of feel burned out.''
   Ms. Cruzan, 33, has been in a coma since suffering severe brain
damage in a 1983 traffic accident.
   Doctors have said her condition is irreversible, and her parents
have argued since 1987 that she should be allowed to die.
   The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last June that Ms. Cruzan could be
permitted to die, but only if ``clear and convincing evidence''
proved that would be what she wanted.
   Several of Ms. Cruzan's former co-workers since have testified
that she told them she wouldn't want to be kept alive in a
vegetative state.
   He and his wife, Joyce, have said if the judge rejects their
request to remove their daughter's feeding tube they will ask him
to let them move her to another state where it would be allowed.
   Cruzan said Thursday that if the judge ruled in their favor he
wasn't sure how soon he would ask workers at the Missouri
Rehabilitation Center to remove the tube.
   State health officials have promised to abide by today's
decision. Workers at the rehabilitation center had been preparing
themselves emotionally for a decision in favor of removing the
tube, said center spokeswoman Barbara Shoun.
   ``I would say months of soul searching on the part of the staff
are coming to a head at this time,'' she said.
   Teel ruled in favor of disconnecting the tube in 1988, but his
decision was overturned by the Missouri Supreme Court. After the
U.S. Supreme Court's decision, the case was returned to Teel's
court to determine if Ms. Cruzan really would want to be allowed to
die.
   The woman has been in a vegetative state since the Jan. 11,
1983, accident, and lies in a bed, her body stiff and her hands
bent like claws.
   She also suffers from seizures, vomiting, bleeding gums and
contorted limbs. Doctors have said if she keeps receiving
nourishment she could continue in that condition for another 40
years.
   If her feeding tube is disconnected, she would probably die in
about two weeks, said Dr. Ronald Cranford, a Minneapolis
neurologist who has examined her.
   ``It will be a peaceful death,'' he said.

   A man convicted of killing three women in
three states nodded to a sheriff who pursued him and smiled at a
prison minister before he died in Virginia's electric chair.
   Buddy Earl Justus, 37, had no final words Thursday before he was
executed at the State Peniteniary. He was pronounced dead shortly
after 11 p.m.
   ``Be strong, you'll move on,'' the Rev. Russ Ford, a prison
chaplain, told Justus as the inmate gave him a slight smile.
   After he was strapped in the oak electric chair, Justus nodded
at Montgomery County Sheriff Louis E. Barber, who investigated the
1978 rape-slaying of Ida Mae Moses, 21, when she was nearly nine
months pregnant.
   Barber said he has been haunted by the crime ever since.
   ``He was afforded a great deal more dignity than Ida Moses. At
least he had his minister present,'' the sheriff said after
watching the execution.
   Justus was convicted of raping and shooting Mrs. Moses three
times in the head on Oct. 3, 1978. He also received death sentences
for murdering Rosemary Jackson, 32, in Gwinnett County, Ga., and
Stephanie Hawkins, 21, in Tampa, Fla., later that month.
   Justus was the 11th person to die in the electric chair since
Virginia resumed executions in 1982. He was the 143rd person to be
executed nationwide since the U.S. Supreme Court allowed states to
revive the death penalty in 1976.
   Gov. L. Douglas Wilder rejected Justus' request for clemency a
few hours before the execution. Justus' lawyer, John C. Copacino,
had argued that the inmate suffered from brain damage. He also said
Justus was abused as a child.
   Earlier Thursday, Justus apologized to his victims' families and
urged that the death penalty be abolished.

<TEXT>
   Souvenir hawkers are doing a lucrative
business outside the courthouse of this remote Amazon jungle
outpost, where ranchers are on trial in the slaying of ecologist
Chico Mendes.
   A mere $600 fetches a 20-inch-by-28 inch oil painting of the
chubby rain forest defender staring stern as Gen. Douglas
MacArthur, as the Acre River meanders through the jungle into the
sunset.
   Short on cash? No problem. Artist Jorge Rivasplata, who came all
the way from Lima, Peru to sell the gem can cut a deal: $500
without the wood frame.
   ``Of course I'm really here in support of Chico Mendes,'' he
said. ``But why not make some money while I'm at it?''
   So goes the philosophy of many merchants in this sleepy Amazon
town: cash in for as long as Brazil's most important trial of the
decade lasts.
   The trial's objective is to decide who is responsible for the
murder of Mendes on the night of Dec. 22, 1988.
   But some residents and traveling salesmen have other objectives:
mainly making quick bucks off the hundreds of ecologists,
politicians, journalists and officials that have flocked to this
town to see the trial.
   Anything is fair game for the face of the slain rain forest
defender and rubber tapper. He appears on buttons, lags, ashtrays,
can openers, t-shirts, caps, and wooden cups. There are even Chico
Mendes Christmas cards going for $3 apiece.
   ``How much?'' cried Ilzamar Mendes, widow of the slain ecologist
and head of the Chico Mendes Foundation. ``I wouldn't even buy one
at that price.''
   Not many of the rubber tappers that live in this river town can.
The exploitation proves irritating to some. Especially for those
like Luiz Vieira de Souza, a 63-year-old tapper who traveled eight
hours in a dugout canoe eating solely manioc root to get to Xapuri.
   ``This is crazy,'' bristled the leathery-skinned tapper, as he
refused a bottle of mineral water selling for $1. ``I may have to
leave early if my money runs out.''
   Some profiteers are imaginative. One barrel-shaped elderly woman
from Brazil's northern Atlantic coastal state of Bahia set up a
stand in front of the town courthouse to sell shrimp stew.
   ``Shrimp in the Amazon?'' asked a visitor. The gentle, round
woman called Isaura smiled.
   ``Yes sir, and just $2 per ladle,'' she said.
   Down the dusty brick and cobblestone street, Zamir Jose Teixeira
was loading a four-foot-high chestnut tree into an ox-drawn cart.
The buyer was counting a wad of bills under a banner that said
`Progress in the Jungle.'
   Had Teixeira legally cut the trees? No one knew and Teixeira
wasn't telling.
   Forest produce was a bit more reasonable if the buyer comparison
shopped. A 2{-ounce box of powdered Guarana, a tart Amazon fruit
used in its powdered form as a stimulant, was selling for the
equivalent of $5.
   A plate of white rice, red beans, lettuce, tomatoes and heavily
salted beef seemed reasonable at $4.
   ``Did I say 500 cruzeiros?'' asked the red-faced waitress with a
giggle. ``I'm sorry, I meant 1,500.''

<HEAD>Jury Rejects Insanity Defense, Convicts Shawcross</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILARY APPELMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The foreman of a jury that convicted a
paroled child killer of slaying 10 women during a 22-month murder
spree said jurors decided the man wasn't insane.
   The Monroe County Court jury convicted Arthur J. Shawcross on
Thursday of 10 counts of second-degree murder in the deaths of
eight prostitutes and two other women between March 1988 and
January 1990. He faces up to 25 years in prison on each count when
he is sentenced Feb. 1.
   Jury foreman Robert Edwards said the panel was particularly
skeptical of the testimony of Dr. Dorothy Lewis, a psychiatrist who
testified that Shawcross suffered brain damage and post-traumatic
stress disorder brought on by child sexual abuse and his
experiences during the Vietnam War.
   ``If she kept her feet on the floor instead of in her mouth
she'd have been all right,'' Edwards said.
   He said jurors never believed defense allegations that Shawcross
was legally insane when he killed the women or even that he was
emotionally disturbed, which would have required they convict him
of the lesser charge of manslaughter.
   ``We didn't buy it,'' he said.
   Shawcross, who confessed to the killings, was arrested Jan. 4, a
day after state police spotted him lingering near the body of one
of his victims.
   Relatives of the victims embraced and cried as the verdicts were
announced. Afterward they thanked prosecutor Charles Siragusa.
   ``Hopefully, Arthur Shawcross will never see the light of day
again,'' Siragusa said.
   Defense lawyer Thomas Cocuzzi said he would appeal.
   At the time of the murders, Shawcross was on parole after
serving 15 years in prison for the 1972 stranglings of an
8-year-old girl and 10-year-old boy.
   He faces trial next year for the killing of an 11th woman.
   Shawcross did not testify during the trial, but jurors watched
videotapes of him being interviewed under hypnosis by Lewis. He
appeared to re-enact episodes of abuse and to take on the
personalities of his mother, his sister and a cannibal from
medieval England.
   Prosecution psychiatrist Dr. Park Dietz argued that Shawcross
was faking mental illness to avoid being sent to prison.

   A wind-whipped 10-alarm fire was raging in a
residential area early today.
   At least seven three-decker homes were destroyed. Officials said
the fire may have been set.
   Three people were taken to a hospital, but no serious injuries
were immediately reported.
   Officials at the scene said all fire equipment in the Boston
metropolitan area was committed to fighting the fire. As many as 17
fire companies were at the scene at 5 a.m., three hours after the
fire broke out.
   Flames could be seen shooting into the sky from a mile away.
   Winds up to 30 mph fanned the flames, and firefighters were
hampered by temperatures in the 20s, with a wind-chill factor near
zero.
   Larry Doane, a Metropolitan police officer on the scene, said
officials ``believe someone is lighting these.''
   Another Metropolitan officer, Peter Sparuk, said Revere police
called for extra help to patrol streets because of reports of
looting.

<HEAD>Disney Acquisition of Henson Productions Falls Through</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WHITE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Walt Disney Co. and the family of the late
Jim Henson, creator of the Muppets, broke off talks after failing
to reach agreement in Disney's 18-month bid to acquire Henson
Associates Inc.
   Disney also had sought an exclusive production agreement in the
deal valued at $100 million to $150 million.
   ``We truly regret we could not come to terms,'' Disney chairman
Michael D. Eisner said Thursday.
   Erwin Okun, a Disney Co. vice president, said it was too early
to tell whether the failed acquisition would preclude the two
companies from attempting future joint productions. He noted that
statements issued by both companies were cordial.
   The Henson family, which has owned Henson Associates since the
puppeteer's death in May, said current projects with Disney would
not be affected by the termination of talks.
   Those projects include a Disney Channel television series, ``Jim
Henson's Mother Goose''; a television sitcom involving dinosaurs,
to be aired in January on ABC; and a 3-D film visitors would see at
Walt Disney World in Florida.
   ``We would have liked to see this deal succeed,'' the Henson
family said in a statement. ``Unfortunately, after 18 months of
negotiating, the companies could not reach a mutually satisfactory
agreement.''
   Henson, the genius behind such characters as Kermit the Frog and
Miss Piggy, founded his production company in 1958 as Muppets Inc.
to produce all his properties.
   Recent negotiations had centered around the lower price Disney
offered after Henson died of pneumonia May 18.
   Industry analysts at first speculated that Henson's death
lessened the value of the acquisition. Henson's personal talents
formed part of Eisner's original strategy to cross-market Muppet
characters with Disney creations.
   Jeffrey Logsdon, an analyst with Crowell Weedon &amp; Co., said it
was more likely that Disney was scared off by hefty estate taxes
owed on Henson properties.

   Rain fell across the South early today, and a cold winterlike
blast with some snow hit the northern United States.
   Much of the nation was under cloudy skies. Temperatures early
today along the lower Eastern seaboard and Gulf coast were in the
60s.
   Rain fell along the mid-Mississippi valley, central Alabama and
the South Carolina coast.
   Temperatures dipped into the high teens and low 20s from
Montana, across the Great Plains and into New York state.
   Snow fell in Boston, Buffalo, N.Y., and Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.,
as well as in Denver. Up to a foot of snow was likely in
California's northern Sierra Nevada.
   Light snow mixed with ice was expected in parts of the northern
Plains. Snow was likely in Wyoming.
   Rain fell in Oregon early today, and a cold front moving in from
the Pacific was expected to bring heavy snow later in the day to
the mountains of Oregon and Northern California.
   The nation's high on Thursday was 84 degrees at Alice,
Kingsville and McAllen, Texas.

   A strong earthquake shook a wide area of
Taiwan before dawn today, hours after another quake on the island
killed two people.
   Today's temblor caused power blackouts and landslides in the
eastern city of Hualien, but there were no immediate reports of
casualties.
   The Central Weather Bureau said today's quake struck at 3:49
a.m. and had a preliminary reading of 6.7 on the Richter scale. Its
epicenter was located in the Pacific about 18 miles southeast of
Hualien.
   More than 430 aftershocks hit the island, including one at 7:18
a.m. with a reading of 5.7 on the Richter scale, the bureau said.
   Today's quake was felt in Taipei, 100 miles northwest of
Hualien. It was the strongest to hit Taiwan since November 1986,
when 13 people were killed by a tremor measuring 6.8 on the Richter
scale.
   On Thursday, a tremor measuring 6.5 shook northeastern Taiwan
and more than 200 aftershocks were recorded, the bureau reported.
Two workers in Hualien were killed in that quake.
   Residents were shaken awake by today's first tremor and many
fled outdoors, said Lee Lai-fe, a policeman in Hualien.
   Several roads were blocked by landslides, and power blackouts
affected about 10,000 households in the city, Lee said. A fire
caused by a short circuit in a power line destroyed three houses
but injured no one.
   Police said a 12-story building in downtown Hualien was tilting
and several other buildings showed cracks.
   Elementary and high schools in Hualien were ordered closed today
to allow authorities to check for possible structural damage,
officials said.
   The Richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one unit represents a tenfold
increase in intensity.
   An earthquake with a magnitude of 6 can cause severe damage in a
populated area, while one of magnitude 7 is classified as a major

   Shoppers asked what they would like to see in
Moscow's food stores have simple tastes: meat, butter and milk.
   ``Basic food - canned goods, sausage, meat products,'' said
Viktor Rozhkov, a Muscovite who was buying bread Thursday evening
with his wife. ``Nowadays, we have practically nothing.''
   Raisa L. Lebedinskaya, another shopper, also said she would like
to see ``the elementary things'' in the stores, such as milk and
butter. ``I want to see all those things that were freely available
in the shops a year ago,'' Mrs. Lebedinskaya said.
   The Soviet government says deliveries of most food products are
running 15 percent to 44 percent below 1989 levels, mostly due to
pilfering and profiteering.
   To combat this, officials said Thursday the Red Army has been
enlisted to help unload thousands of tons of government-purchased
food that are stuck at ports and railway stations.
   More than 1.6 million metric tons of imported goods await
unloading or shipment from Soviet ports, and about 7,000 railways
cars are waiting at border stations.
   The soldiers also will help ease the backlog of foreign food aid
that is flooding into the Soviet Union.
   Shoppers interviewed Thursday evening said they were confident
that the KGB secret police, Interior Ministry troops and other law
officers would ensure that the foreign food aid gets to Soviet
stores.
   They also welcomed news that the Bush administration promised
the Soviet Union up to $1 billion in loan guarantees to buy U.S.
wheat, corn and other farm products to help out during the coming
hard winter. The shoppers did not think such aid was humiliating
for the Soviet Union to accept, because it was not a handout.
   ``If it was simply free of charge, it would be humiliating,''
said Rozhkov, 55. ``But as it's credit, it's not humiliating.''
   Vasily I. Tarasov, hurrying along the street carrying a plastic
shopping bag in each hand, also welcomed the help from the United
States, and likened it to American assistance during World War II.
   ``We fought together against the fascists, and if they help us
(again), we favor it,'' said Tarasov, 75.
   Under orders from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the KGB has
set up a special unit to combat economic sabotage, including taking
control of distributing the foreign food aid and preventing its
theft.
   Deputy Prime Minister Lev Voronin, who heads a government
commissioin overseeing the aid distribution, and KGB Maj. Gen.
Alexander N. Karbainov stressed at separate news briefings Thursday
that the majority of foreign humanitarian aid was reaching its
destination.
   Both admitted, however, that some has fallen into the hands of
black marketeers who can sell it to speculators taking advantage of
widespread shortages in state-run stores.
   ``There are some disorders,'' Voronin said. ``The harshest
measures have been taken to eliminate all such phenomena.'' He did
not elaborate.
   Voronin said the army had been enlisted to unload cargo planes,
and 1,000 soldiers were ordered to Brest on the Polish border to
help clear the rail backlog.
   He said 1,000 trucks were found to help distribute aid arriving
at Moscow railway stations after Pravda quoted the Railways
Ministry as saying the situation was ``catastrophic.'' Voronin
predicted it would be under control by Dec. 20.
   As of Wednesday night, the Soviet Union had received 1,700
metric tons of food aid and 800 tons of medicines, cribs and
construction materials, Voronin said.
   He said the single largest donor country was Germany, which gave
1,900 metric tons, followed by Italy at 117 metric tons, the United
States at 93 metric tons, Austria at 75 metric tons, and
Switzerland and the Netherlands at 45 metric tons each.
   First priority for receiving aid goes to schools and orphanages
followed by ecologically damaged areas like Chernobyl and the Aral
Sea; next come pensioners, the disabled and low income families.

   Failed brakes may have caused an Amtrak train to
derail and smash into a commuter train, injuring 264 people,
federal safety officials said.
   They also said Thursday that the Amtrak train may have been
traveling too fast along a curve where the crash occurred, but that
the speed may never be determined because one speed recorder on the
train was not working and the other was destroyed in the crash.
   An apprentice engineer operating the Amtrak train told
investigators he tried to brake three times as the Night Owl from
Washington approached a Boston station, said Susan Coughlin, vice
chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board.
   ``He indicated that in his three attempts to brake the train,
the brakes failed to set up properly to stop it,'' Coughlin said at
a news conference.
   The apprentice, Richard Abramson, also told authorities that
senior engineer Willis Copeland tried to stop the Night Owl using
emergency brakes, she said.
   Coughlin said brakes on Amtrak cars that did not derail were
working normally. Brakes from the derailed cars were sent to
Washington for testing.
   The rush-hour crash Wednesday morning near the Back Bay Station
injured 264 people. Copeland, 53, of Bethany, Conn., and Abramson,
41, of Trumbull, Conn., were among 11 of those Thursday still
hospitalized.
   Coughlin said that one of the Night Owl's speed recorders was
destroyed in the crash and the other, for unknown reasons, did not
record during the last five miles.
   ``We will never know the exact speed of impact. I regret the
fact that we don't have'' that data, she said. ``The last time he
(Abramson) looked at the speedometer, he was going between 60 and
70 mph,'' she said.
   Coughlin said data from signals tripped by the train showed it
traveled the last 1\ miles in 49 seconds at an average speed of
91.8 mph. Before that last stretch, the train could travel safely
at 100 mph. But it should have slowed down to 30 mph by the time it
reached the point where it derailed, on a curve 500 feet from the
station, she said.
   It was the first time Copeland had taken over operation of a
regular train run, authorities said.
   The Herald and The Boston Globe said drug and alcohol tests on
Copeland were negative. The results of those on Abramson were
awaited.
   The force of the crash bent the Massachusetts Bay Transportation
Authority's 120-ton locomotive around a concrete barrier in an
L-shape. Three Amtrak cars, including the locomotive that carried
the two Amtrak engineers, became a mesh of broken metal parts,
barely distinguishable as separate units.
   Thomas Glynn, MBTA general manager, said the accident caused
$3.1 million in damage to MBTA equipment and ``extensive'' damage
to Amtrak equipment.
   The Herald reported today that Copeland was fired from Conrail
after a derailment in the late 1970s but was later rehired. More
recently, the paper said, he agreed to a lifetime ban from
Metro-North Railroad, the commuter railroad that serves New York's
northern suburbs, following signal violations in 1988 and last
year.
   He also was at the controls of an Amtrak train involved in a
July 1984 crash that was blamed on a signal problem. The National
Transportation safety Board cleared him of wrongdoing.
   John P. Cole, a Washington lawyer representing crash victims,
said he planned to file a $475 million class action suit in U.S.
District Court in Washington against Amtrak because of the
accident.

   Seven Vietnamese boat people suffered burns
today after wrapping themselves in blankets and setting themselves
on fire to protest the government's refusal to settle them in the
West, authorities said.
   Two members of the group were hospitalized with severe burns, in
guarded and fair condition, respectively. The others were briefly
treated at hospitals.
   The protesters at the Whitehead Detention Center had been
refused refugee status and thus the chance to settle in the West.
They had been on a hunger strike for four days.
   The act was an attempt at mass suicide, said Raymond Hall, a
spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
in Geneva.
   The Whitehead Detention Center is the largest of Hong Kong's 15
refugee camps. It houses 22,800 boat people.
   Raymond Lai, the assistant commissioner of correctional
services, said the government regretted the boat people ``should
have resorted to such actions that might harm themselves.''
   The British colonial government instituted a screening process
in June 1988 to separate what it called genuine refugees, who have
a right to be resettled in the West, from ``economic migrants,''
who will be sent back to Vietnam.
   Of the 45,000 boat people now in Hong Kong's detention centers,
17 percent are genuine refugees. The rest will have to go home, the
government says.
   So far plans to return the Vietnamese have not been too
successful.
   Britain backed down after intense international criticism
followed Hong Kong's forced repatriation of 51 boat people last
December.
   Under a voluntary repatriation program, more than 6,000
Vietnamese have been flown home since March 1989. But about 40,000
boat people have arrived since then.
   Another program was started Dec. 1 to return Vietnamese who do
not strongly oppose repatriation although they did not volunteer
for it. Only 23 people have returned home under that program.
   A group of University of Hong Kong lawyers recently issued a
report that obtaining refugee status was a matter of luck. They
said Hong Kong officials didn't know enough about Vietnam to be
informed interviewers, and furthermore were prejudiced against
Vietnamese.
   Hong Kong claims the screening process has been improved, and
U.N. officials agree.
   Nine Vietnamese denied refugee status are currently challenging
the screening process in court. If the court rules in their favor,
some lawyers believe it could upset the screening process, forcing
the government to re-screen tens of thousands of cases.

   A flight surgeon who has been denied conscientious
objector status is hoping his 2-week-old hunger strike will get him
out of the Army before he is due to be deployed to Saudi Arabia
next week.
   Capt. David Wiggins says he has lost 17 of the 167 pounds he
carried on his 5-foot-10-inch frame before he began subsisting on
vitamins and water Nov. 30.
   Wiggins, 28, said Thursday that he expects to be deployed from
Fort Hood to the Persian Gulf on Monday.
   ``I haven't heard anything to change that belief from the
Army,'' he said. ``My bags are packed. ... I'm just waiting for a
phone call, I guess.''
   He says he is philosophically opposed to war and has been trying
to get out of the Army since February.
   He began the fast after a federal judge refused to overturn the
Army's ruling that he could not be discharged as a conscientious
objector. He said he is not a coward and doesn't want out of the
Army to avoid being sent to the Persian Gulf.
   ``My purpose is to be discharged from the Army, because
contributing to an organization whose sole purpose is killing is
reprehensible to me,'' he said.
   Wiggins said he first began to have doubts about the military
while still a cadet at West Point. He said the feelings became
stronger after Communist governments were toppled across Eastern
Europe by peaceful means last year.
   ``War is not a necessary evil, because non-violent political
change is possible,'' he said.
   He said he has offered to pay the government back for his
education at New York Medical College if he is released from
service.
   He estimated he can go without food for about two more weeks
before he becomes unable to work.
   ``I can only assume (Army officials) are content to let me
starve to the point I am hospitalized,'' he said.

   Twelve people have died in a religious
ritual, apparently after drinking a poisoned sacrament, and the
leader of the ceremony clung to life in a coma today, officials
said.
   Authorities who went to the house Thursday night in the
impoverished El Florido neighborhood of this border city found
twelve bodies strewn about the living room, with five survivors.
Another ritual participant later checked into a hospital.
   The dead included four men, seven women and a 6-year-old girl,
police said.
   The victims' faces were contorted in pain and had suffered a
purplish discoloration of the skin, apparently caused by poisoning,
the judicial police report said. Autopsy reports were expected
later today.
   Authorities in this city south of San Diego speculated the
deaths were caused by an industrial alcohol, perhaps rubbing
alcohol, that was poured accidentally into a fruit punch the
participants shared during a religious ceremony.
   ``We believe we've ruled out both suicide and homicide,'' said
Jose Nunez de Caceres, a commander of the Baja California state
police.
   Officers were conducting tests on the punch and a bowl of cooked
chicken found in the house where the 12 bodies were found, said
Baja California Police spokeswoman Sara Yolanda Gonzalez.
   The group leader and owner of the home, Federico Padres Mejia,
62, was in a coma, hospital officials said.
   Also hospitalized were Ana Osuna, aged four months; Consuelo
Ponce, 35; Juan Jose Sarabia, 49; Moises Merida Gonzalez, 32, and
Hernandez. Hospital officials did not describe their conditions.
   Relatives of the victims said they had previously attended
healing rites in the house that were a mixture of Christianity and
spiritualism, calling the spirits of the dead for consultation.
   In a hospital interview, survivor Alfredo Osuna Hernandez said
the people gathered round a cardboard Virgin Mary and drank the
punch as a sacrament. Several hours later, people began falling
ill, Hernandez said.
   ``People started complaining of stomach pains and some of them
began to vomit. Some of them started to get scared and they started
to scream from the pain,'' Hernandez said.
   His sister-in-law, Margarita Ramos de Osuna, 25, was among the
first to fall, he told The Associated Press. She was listed among
the dead.
   ``I didn't try to help her because the Lord was there,''
Hernandez said.
   Asked why no one left to seek help, he said:
   ``It is very damaging to leave the circle.''
   Hernandez said the gathering was a cleansing or purification
ritual. An unemployed auto body repairman, he took part with hopes
the ceremony would change his luck.
   He wanted ``a little of the Lord's coin,'' Hernandez said. ``I
was looking for a key to a job, a key to work.''
   A neighbor, Gerardo Barrios, said he did small construction jobs
at the house and had been invited by Padres to take part in one
ceremony.
   ``He said he had died twice and that his spirit left him and
returned,'' said Barrios.
   Ritual participants sat in a circle within a rope and spread oil
on their bodies, which Padres said would cleanse their souls,
Barrios said.
   ``He would talk about eternal sleep and tell us to go to
sleep,'' Barrios said.
   Officers who saw the living room said a rope with 13 knots tied
in it had been laid in a circle on the floor around four or five of
the bodies.
   A book of prayers dealing with the ``sith seal'' reportedly was
also found, apparently related to the biblical prophesies of
Armageddon.
   Neighbors said chanting had filtered from the house over the
past several nights, the last time starting Wednesday night and
continuing into the morning.
   The house was located in a cluster of shanties typical of the
grubby suburbs of Tijuana, Mexico's fourth-largest city with about
2 million people.
   Authorities found the bodies sprawled in contorted poses on
couches, chairs and the floor of the home.
   Ana Faviola Miranda, 17, the daughter of a woman who died in the
tragedy, discovered the bodies and reported them to police, said
Ms. Gonzalez, the police spokeswoman.
   Miranda, 17, said she went to the house at 8 p.m. Wednesday and
Padres told her to leave and come back later, according to police.
   After spending the night outside in a car, Miranda asked a
neighbor for help, and the two entered the house through a window.
Miranda at first thought healing ceremony participants were asleep
or in a trance, police said.

<TEXT>
   An apology and money for legal expenses
would have saved Dover police $1 million, says the lawyer for a man
police mistook for a jewel thief.
   Kenneth Duval, 50, of Lawrence, Mass., won a $1 million federal
lawsuit Monday against the police department. Duval had argued that
police violated his constitutional rights by arresting him in 1984
and accusing him of belonging to an East Coast diamond theft gang.
   ``It was not a money case for Kenneth Duval,'' said his lawyer,
Andrew Isaac. ``If they had called him back in 1985 and said they
were sorry and tried to cover his expenses and said, `Thank you for
trying to help us,' it would have ended there.''
   Police alleged that Duval helped steal a diamond from a
department store. They charged him with being an accomplice to
theft, and also accused him of belonging to a gang that stole
diamonds in New England, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York.
   Strafford County Attorney Lincoln Soldati dropped the charges a
year later, admitting police had the wrong man. Soldati ``had the
grace and common sense to write Mr. Duval and tell him it was an
unfortunate case of mistaken identity,'' Isaac said.
   Duval's defense cost him $33,000, his lawyer said.
   Isaac said Dover police originally investigated another man, but
that man led them to Duval.
   ``He was a recent Russian immigrant. They showed him a picture
and the man said, `It looks like a guy who lives where I used to
live. ... It looks like Ken,' '' Isaac said. ``Ken, like most
people, talked to police for two hours. He showed them his business
diary and appointments.''
   Dover police are considering appealing the award.

   A Bolivian described by officials as a
powerful cocaine trafficker and lead supplier of unrefined coca to
the Colombian cartels was arrested at his 19-room estate by federal
drug agents.
   Jorge Roca Suarez and his wife, Cecilia Beatrice Roca Torres,
were arrested Thursday for investigation of conspiracy to possess
cocaine with intent to distribute, said Julius C. Beretta, the Drug
Enforcement Administration special agent in San Diego.
   Both were in federal custody. Bail was not immediately set.
   Beretta described Roca Suarez, a resident immigrant, as ``one of
the most significant cocaine traffickers in the United States, on
par with Medellin or Cali cartel leaders.''
   A federal indictment against the couple was expected to be
unsealed at their arraignment today.
   Roca Suarez was arrested at 2 p.m. Thursday by San Marino police
and DEA, U.S. Customs and Internal Revenue Service agents, said
police Officer Armando Rodriguez.
   The 38-year-old Bolivian was taken into custody at his estate on
a manicured hillside in an exclusive enclave of this town 10 miles
northeast of downtown Los Angeles. His wife, 40, was arrested in
nearby Monterey Park, Beretta said.
   Roca Suarez is the nephew of Roberto Suarez Gomez, who's serving
a 15-year sentence on drug charges in La Paz, Bolivia.
   Bolivian officials have refused U.S. extradition requests for
Suarez, who built a reputation as that country's king of cocaine in
the 1970s and early 1980s.
   Roca Suarez once offered to pay the Bolivian foreign debt. The
Bolivian government rejected the offer.
   DEA officials said Roca Suarez allegedly undercut his uncle by
selling cocaine paste at prices lower than those charged by Suarez.
He reputedly is the most powerful figure in Bolivia's coca trade,
arranging cocaine shipments to U.S. and European markets, the
officials alleged.

   The president of the African
National Congress today said the black opposition group should
reconsider its support for international sanctions imposed on South
Africa to protest apartheid.
   Oliver Tambo, who a day earlier returned to South Africa after
30 years in exile, told the opening session of the ANC's
consultative conference the group had to reconsider its strategy to
recognize the changing political situation in South Africa.
   ``It is no longer enough for us to repeat the tried slogans,''
he said in a speech that could mark a major change in the ANC's
position on sanctions. It was the first conference of the formerly
banned ANC in South Africa in more than 30 years.
   ``We should therefore carefully re-evaluate the advisability of
insisting on the retention of sanctions given the new developments
in the country and abroad,'' the 73-year-old leader said.
   If the ANC sticks to outdated policies, the white-led government
could gain the strategic initiative in talks on the future of South
Africa, Tambo said. Some ANC leaders are concerned the government's
push for reforms is upstaging the opposition.
   But Tambo also urged the cheering delegates to step up the
struggle against apartheid and win the freedom of blacks.
   ``Whatever our tactics, our absolute determination is to regain
our freedom,'' Tambo said. ``The struggle against apartheid should
be intensified on all fronts.''
   The conference, which began today with some 1,600 delegates, is
considering ANC policies and the course of talks with the
government on sharing power with the black majority.
   Moderates who support the talks are expected to face tough
opposition from radicals who doubt the government's willingness to
give up power.
   The ANC has opposed government calls for an easing of sanctions.
ANC Deputy President Nelson Mandela said recently it was too soon
to lift sanctions, despite reforms by President F.W. de Klerk.
   Many nations have imposed various bans on economic, cultural and
sporting ties with South Africa to protest the apartheid system of
government. Tambo did not say which sanctions might be eased.
   De Klerk has said lifting sanctions will help boost the economy
and ease black unemployment, homelessness and other problems.
   Tambo is to spend about three weeks in South Africa before going
to London for treatment for a stroke he suffered last year.
   Mandela, in a speech after Tambo, charged that recent black
factional fighting was part of an orchestrated campaign to destroy
confidence in the ANC. He alleged some members of the government
were trying to weaken the ANC before talks on power sharing are
held.
   ``As it has unfolded and taken hold over the past three months,
it is evident that it is targeted at the ANC,'' he said.
   The ANC claims security force members are behind fighting that
has claimed more than 1,000 lives in the Johannesburg area since
August. The fighting pits Xhosas and other blacks who support the
ANC against Zulus of the Inkatha Freedom Party.
   The government and the police have denied they are behind the
violence, which also has claimed more than 5,000 lives in Natal
Province in recent years.
   De Klerk unbanned the ANC and other opposition groups Feb. 11
and talks are expected to begin next year on power sharing. De
Klerk has already begun dismantling parts of the apartheid system.

   The U.S. ambassador to Kuwait flew
back to the United States today with about 50 American and other
foreign hostages he led from Iraq and the occupied emirate.
   Joining a U.S. Air Force honor guard, Ambassador Nathaniel
Howell saluted the members of his bare-bones embassy staff as they
boarded a C-5 military transport plane for the flight to Andrews
Air Force Base outside Washington.
   Aboard were 23 Americans and 10 non-U.S. citizen family members,
as well as 15 people going to Canada, officials said.
   All had come from Iraq or Kuwait on Thursday. A U.S. Consulate
spokesman, Craig Springer, said several Americans evacuated
Thursday who were not aboard the C-5 today have chosen to return
home independently.
   Looking surprisingly fit after months of surviving on canned
tuna, Howell told reporters before departing Frankfurt that he
slept well at an airport hotel, got a haircut and feasted on
sausage, bacon and eggs for breakfast.
   ``We have a lot of cholesterol to make up for,'' he joked, a
reference to the nearly four-month ordeal at the besieged U.S.
Embassy in Kuwait following Iraq's invasion of the emirate Aug. 2.
   Iraq's government of President Saddam Hussein ordered all
foreign missions in Kuwait to close Aug. 24, and those that defied
the order had services cut off by authorities who took over the
emirate after the Aug. 2 invasion.
   Barbara Bodine, the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy
in Kuwait, said after checking into the hotel: ``First I took a
shower. Then I took a bath. Then I had dinner. Then I had another
bubble bath.''
   Howell and his staff left Iraq on Thursday on the last U.S.
charter to evacuate Westerners who had been held by Saddam to deter
a U.S. attack.
   Hundreds of Westerners have left since Saddam announced a
blanket release of hostages on Dec. 6, and U.S. officials said all
other Americans who wish to leave can take commercial
transportation.
   Former hostages who would talk to reporters were very bitter
about their experiences and accused Iraq of a host of atrocities.
   One American, who said his mother was from Indiana and his
father from Kuwait, said several people who had been imprisoned
after the invasion later told tales of torture.
   He said he knew of one 15-year-old boy who was arrested by Iraqi
authorities after protesting the shooting death of his younger
brother. The younger boy had been caught spray-painting anti-Saddam
Hussein graffitti and shot on the spot, he said.
   The young American, who went to Kuwait last summer to marry a
Kuwaiti woman, said he planned to return to Indiana and continue
his studies at Purdue University.
   He declined to give his name for fear those he left behind would
be harassed.
   Layla Cox, a Kuwaiti married to an American, was emotional as
she walked away from the plane Thursday carrying her baby daughter:
``It's terrible. You had to be there,'' she told reporters.
   Later, as she waited with her husband, Wayne, and three children
to check into their room, she explained that she couldn't join in
the euphoria of the other hostages when the plane touched down in
the West because of her three sisters left in Kuwait.
   ``My poor sisters and their kids are still hostages there. I
don't think I'll be able to enjoy this freedom.''

   A judge dismissed a murder charge
against a doctor who invented a device that an Alzheimer's disease
victim used to kill herself, but he didn't clear the doctor to use
the machine again.
   District Judge Gerald McNally on Thursday threw out a
first-degree murder charge against Dr. Jack Kevorkian in the June 4
death of Janet Adkins. She died after activating a machine
Kevorkian invented that sent poison into her veins.
   Kevorkian was with her at the time of her death.
   McNally ruled at the end of a two-day preliminary hearing that
Michigan has no law against suicide or assisting in it.
   Michael Modelski, chief assistant Oakland County prosecutor,
said the prosecutor's office might ask the Circuit Court to
reinstate the murder charge or bring lesser charges such as
second-degree murder or manslaughter against Kevorkian.
   ``I think everyone realizes this isn't the final step,''
Modelski said.
   The ruling doesn't let Kevorkian use the suicide device again.
It remains in police custody after prosecutors obtained a temporary
court order preventing its further use. A civil trial, probably in
January, will decide whether or not to make that order permanent,
said Kevorkian's attorney, Geoffrey Fieger.
   Once hooked up to the device, Mrs. Adkins, 54, of Portland,
Ore., pressed a button on the machine, starting a flow of lethal
chemical into her veins. She died in the back of Kevorkian's van.
Kevorkian said several motels and funeral homes had refused his
request to let him use their sites for the suicide.
   Kevorkian notified authorities of the death, and state police
questioned him. But he wasn't charged with murder until nearly six
months later.
   ``I was always convinced that I was doing the right thing, but
it was under terrible conditions, and no one would want to repeat
that,'' Kevorkian, 62, a retired pathologist from Royal Oak, said
after McNally's ruling.
   He said the ruling bolstered his longtime support of what he
calls physician-assisted suicide for the terminally ill.
   ``We need a rational system to meet a crying need,'' Kevorkian
said. ``I'm going to work with the authorities and in the (medical)
system. We've got to re-establish the nobility of the profession.''
   In announcing his decision, McNally called on the Legislature to
address the issues raised by Kevorkian. A bill introduced by state
Sen. Fred Dillingham would make assisting in a suicide a felony
punishable by four years in prison and a $2,000 fine.
   The judge ruled after viewing a videotape of Mrs. Adkins and
Kevorkian discussing her fight against Alzheimer's, which causes
loss of memory and irreversible brain degeneration. The tape was
made two days before her death.
   ``My life before was wonderful,'' she says. ``I could play the
piano and read. I can't do any of those things (now) ... it's too
taxing.''
   ``Why do you want your life to end?'' Kevorkian asks.
   ``I've had enough,'' Mrs. Adkins answers, her voice breaking.
   Mrs. Adkins' husband, Ronald, said from his home in Portland
that he was pleased with the judge's ruling and had no regrets
about his wife's decision.
   ``I respected Janet's wishes. She was a very intelligent woman
and had it very well thought out,'' he said. ``Its concept was
something we had thought and talked about years before.''
   For his part, Kevorkian said after the hearing that he didn't
expect to assist in other suicides on his own but wanted to enlist
the medical establishment's cooperation.
   ``I'm going to work with the authorities,'' he said.
   On the videotape with the Adkinses, Kevorkian repeated his
longstanding views favoring assisted suicide.
   ``These tough decisions have got to be made, and who's in better
position to decide them than the physicians?'' he tells the couple.
``One of the hardest things they're going to have to do is this ...
no matter how distasteful it is.''
   Derek Humphrey, head of the National Hemlock Society in Eugene,
Ore., welcomed the ruling. The organization advocates a person's
right to choose death if facing a terminal illness.
   But Humphrey said: ``We would wish to see euthanasia performed
for the dying in a more dignified way, in home or hospital by the
doctor who is treating the patient, and of course according to a
clear law.''

<HEAD>Giving Is Up but Some Charities Feel Pinch of Economic Slump</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. charities are taking in more money this year than last, but
the needs of the poor are also rising, and in the nation's
economically depressed Northeast the organizations report giving
has fallen off drastically.
   Charities across the country report increased demand for food,
shelter and clothing - problems they blame on layoffs, economic
woes and government cutbacks.
   ``It's looking real scary,'' said Vicky Wheeler of the Central
Vermont Community Action Council. She said the number of daily
visitors to the council's food bank is up from 15 to 35 in the past
six months while donations have held steady. The council has cut
the size of its food packages by a third to make supplies last.
   ``If we run out of food and can't help them, there's not really
any other place to turn,'' she said.
   Other charities in the heavily industrialized Northeast say
contributions are down by as much as 67 percent from a year ago and
their budgets are stretched pitifully thin.
   Nationally, donations to the Salvation Army and Goodwill
Industries of America Inc. are running about 8 percent above last
year's levels, according to the national headquarters of those
organizations.
   Two New York-based groups that keep tabs on charities - the
American Association of Fundraising Council and the National
Charities Information Bureau - also said the 1990 philanthropy
tally is unlikely to fall below 1989's $115 billion.
   ``Giving for 1990 is expected to be up, as it has been every
year since 1955,'' said Charities Information Bureau President Ken
Albrecht.
   But the United Way of America, which projects a 4.5 percent gain
in contributions to local United Way campaigns, said collection
levels fluctuate widely from region to region.
   ``If you want to talk about New England, we're down there a
couple percentage points. If you want to talk about the Pacific
Northwest, Seattle is up in the double digits,'' said Richard
Fusco, United Way vice president for resource development.
   Of 80 local organizations contacted by The Associated Press, 54
said donations were flat or below year-ago levels and 49 reported
increased demand for their services.
   Fourteen said they stepped up their efforts this year because
they expected hard times, and 12 said they either had cut budgets
and staff or were considering doing so.
   ``We are two months behind on our $3,800-a-month rent, one month
behind on utilities,'' said Kent Beittel, executive director of the
Open Shelter in Columbus, Ohio, a homeless-aid center considering
layoffs.
   Many charities in the economically depressed Northeast report
large dropoffs in giving.
   The American Red Cross chapter in Bridgeport, Conn., had raised
$2,300 toward a $30,000 goal at the end of last week, compared with
$7,000 raised at the same time last year.
   In Boston, donations to Salvation Army kettles are averaging
about 50 percent of last year, said chief bell ringer William
Edmonds. Meanwhile, requests for assistance in Massachusetts are up
about 25 percent, said Charles Williams, director of Salvation Army
social services in the state.
   Applications for Salvation Army assistance nationally are up 15
percent from a year ago, national spokesman Leon Ferraez said
Wednesday. Goodwill Industries anticipates a 7 percent increase in
requests for services, said spokeswoman Jeanne Hamrick.
   Charities in the Sunbelt states, the West and some pockets of
the Midwest reported increased donations, but most also said they
had gone after funds more aggressively. Many California charities
surveyed also said collections had increased or were holding
steady, but a few reported problems.
   The Salt Lake City United Way said giving was up 12 percent over
last year, the Miami Salvation Army reported an increase, and
contributions were up at the United Way of Central Iowa, the Easter
Seals Society of Iowa and the Iowa March of Dimes.
   Several charities complained of a drop in corporate
contributions.
   But corporate, foundation and bequest donations together account
for just 15 percent of U.S. philanthropy, said Joanne Hayes,
president of the American Association of Fundraising Council.
   ``The biggest donors are not upper middle-class people. They are
people of modest means,'' she said.

   The special counsel for the Senate
committee investigating whether five senators improperly helped
Charles H. Keating is a partner in a law firm once tied to Keating,
a report published today said.
   The San Francisco Chronicle also said three of the senators'
lawyers work for firms with previous connections to the Lincoln
Savings add Loan Association owner.
   The Chronicle said Robert Bennett, special counsel for the
Senate Ethics Committee, and two of the senators' lawyers already
were working on the panel's investigation when they took jobs at
firms with former Keating links. Bennett today denounced the
report.
   Keating was a major contributor to all five senators. The Ethics
Committee is considering whether the $1.3 million he and associates
donated to their campaigns and related political causes was tied to
their help in dealing with federal thrift regulators.
   Keating's parent company, American Continental Co., went
bankrupt in April 1989, and Lincoln Savings was seized by
regulators. The cost to taxpayers to cover insured deposits is
expected to top $2 billion, and Keating is under a state fraud
indictment in California.
   It's the most prominent case in the nation's burgeoning savings
and loan scandal.
   Bennett and his staff of lawyers and investigators have worked
on the Keating case for the Ethics Committee since last fall. They
joined the Washington office of the New York-based Skadden, Arps
firm on April 15 of this year, the Chronicle said.
   In 1985, Skadden, Arps received about $4 million in fees from a
limited partnership in which Lincoln invested $35.9 million, an
18.3 percent interest. The fees were for work on the partnership's
takeover of Crown Zellerbach, according to the newspaper.
   Bennett called the news report ``just one more very clear effort
to discredit me, to distract from the issues in this case, and it's
not going to work.''
   Thomas C. Green, lawyer for Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., joined
the Washington firm of Sidley and Austin on June 11. That was 2{
months after the firm was added as a defendant in a $250 million
lawsuit filed on behalf of 23,000 people who bought now worthless
American Continental bonds, the Chronicle said.
   Another Sidley and Austin attorney, Margery Waxman, helped
develop Keating's strategy for dealing with politicians and top
federal regulators.
   John Dowd, attorney for Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., joined the
law firm of Akin, Gump and Strauss in January, shortly after McCain
retained him for the Ethics Committee investigation. Keating
employed the firm in 1986 and 1987.
   Another lawyer for the firm appears on Keating's appointment
logs for 1986 regarding efforts to get Keating associate Lee Henkel
appointed to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, according to the
Chronicle. The board was then the top S&amp;L regulatory body.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has said that Akin,
Gump is not on its list for handling the government's side of S&amp;L
matters because the firm has clients whose interests conflict with
the FDIC's.
   Henkel's lawyer has been James Hamilton, also the attorney for
Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., in the Ethics Committee hearings.
   A key part of Bennett's case against DeConcini is that the
senator may have withheld a vote that could have defeated a
controversial White House judicial appointment in exchange for the
Reagan administration's agreement to appoint Henkel to the bank
board.
   The lawyers for the other two Keating Five senators - Alan
Cranston of California and John Glenn of Ohio, both Democrats - are
with firms that have no known past relationship with Keating or his
dealings, the Chronicle said.
   It was unclear late Thursday whether Bennett had informed the
committee of his new law firm's past relations with Keating, the
Chronicle said.
   Tom McMahon, spokesman for committee chairman Sen. Howell
Heflin, D-Ala., said Heflin had no comment. Bob Stevenson,
spokesman for committee vice chairman Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H.,
said the committee was told that Skadden, Arps had ``conducted a
conflict investigation, found no conflict.''
   New York University law professor Stephen Gillers, a specialist
in legal ethics, said Bennett could have legitimately determined
that the ``scope of his responsibility to the Ethics Committee''
does not include investigation of the Crown Zellerbach takeover
that Keating's Lincoln was involved in.
   But Yale law Professor Geoffrey Hazard said, ``I think it would
have been wise for Bennett to hold off the affiliation with his new
firm just because it would foreclose public anxiety and public
criticism.''
   Michael Waldman, director of Ralph Nader's Public Citizen
Congress, said the senators' lawyers' ties to firms with former
Keating links showed ``not so much a conflict of interest as a
unity of interest.''

   A man accused of impersonating a
female to enroll at Coronado High School and become a cheerleader
is ready for a plea bargain, his lawyer said.
   Charles Daugherty, 26, who has been diagnosed as having multiple
personalities, is charged with forging documents and impersonation.
   His lawyer, Kent Gray, said Thursday that Daugherty will enter a
guilty plea Jan. 3, but to which charge has not been decided.
   Daugherty would like a deferred sentence so the charge would be
dismissed if he complies with court orders for two years, Gray
said. ``But the district attorney doesn't want that, and probation
with no jail is more likely,'' he said.
   Mental health treatment would be a requirement. Daugherty said
he already is undergoing such treatment.
   The district attorney's office declined to comment.
   Daugherty enrolled at Coronado in September and soon joined the
cheerleading squad. Students were shocked when it was disclosed he
was a male, and the story was highly publicized.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, responding to
Democratic calls to give economic sanctions against Iraq more time,
said today ``patience is not producing results.''
   ``Those who would have us rely indefinitely on economic
sanctions alone need to face the possibility that they will fail to
achieve our aims,'' Cheney told the House Armed Services Committee.
   The testimony from the Pentagon chief and Gen. Colin Powell,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, comes amid the urgings of
several Democrats for a go-slow approach in the gulf rather than
the immediate use of military force.
   But Cheney told the panel that if the economic attempts and
diplomatic efforts to solve the crisis fail, the United States must
have the option of using force to oust Iraq from the oil-rich
emirate of Kuwait.
   ``Having a capacity for patience does not mean we must remain
patient when patience is not producing results. We must always have
other options, and that is what the new deployments and the recent
United Nations action are all about,'' Cheney said.
   President Bush has announced that Secretary of State James A.
Baker III will travel to Iraq to try to resolve the crisis. But
Cheney said the United States has given Iraq ``15 separate dates
and then turned all those down and said he can only come on the
12th'' of January.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the Armed Service panel and
a supporter of Bush's policy, opened the hearing stressing the need
for Cheney and Powell to answer a key question.
   ``We want to explore with our witnesses today whether we've
created a use-it-or-lose-it force in the Persian Gulf that will
prematurely bring us to the question of peace or war,'' Aspin said.
   On Thursday, several former U.S. military officials and defense
experts said they believe military force - not a year of economic
sanctions - is the only way to oust Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
   ``If we wait for sanctions to succeed, Saddam knows we're
waiting and he will outlast us,'' said retired Army Col. Trevor
Dupuy.
   Cheney and Powell received a more receptive audience today than
when they appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee less
than two weeks ago.
   The Senate panel's chairman, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., has been an
outspoken critic of President Bush's decision to deploy an
additional 200,000 troops to the Persian Gulf region. Nunn also
believes the administration should give the United Nations
sanctions time to work before opting for war.
   Aspin has doubts about the sanctions. He has endorsed Bush's
added deployment of forces and looks more favorably on using the
military to neutralize Saddam Hussein's troops.
   In hearings before the House panel Wednesday and Thursday,
witnesses selected by Aspin bolstered his and the Bush
administration's perspective on solving the crisis.
   The witnesses endorsed using an air offensive against Iraqi
forces and then possibly opting for a ground attack. However, they
warned the United States will have to pay a price for war.
   ``We may have to take those first few rounds in the teeth in
order to be able to have ultimate victory in the air,'' said
retired Air Force Gen. Charles Donnelly Jr., former commander of
the U.S. Air Forces in Europe.
   Dupuy estimated that an air and ground attack would result in
about 9,000 casualties, including 1,000 to 1,500 American dead.
   The witnesses said the first target should be the Iraqi command
and if possible in the early days of an attack, the country's
potential nuclear capability.
   The lone note of dissent came from Rep. Nicholas Mavroules,
D-Mass., who questioned whether Arab allies would help in the
effort to defeat Iraq.
   ``Who's going to fight this war? Does anyone truly believe that
a Saudi or Arab pilot will bomb Iraq?'' Mavroules asked the
witnesses. ``It's going to be a U.S. war. We're going to lose
thousands of men and women.''
   To shore up its offensive air capability, the Air Force said
Thursday it is sending an undisclosed number of F-16 fighter jets
and A-10 anti-armor aircraft to Saudi Arabia from Germany and
Britain.
   Officials have declined to provide details on numbers of planes
and aviators being sent, but it is believed that at least 300
additional Air Force planes are headed to the gulf, along with at
least 10,000 personnel.
   Meanwhile, the Navy announced the activation of hundreds of
reservists for medical duty in the gulf region.
   Also, the Pentagon said Cheney and Powell will travel to Saudi
Arabia next week to visit American troops and to meet with Saudi
government officials.

   European Community leaders today approved a $1
billion emergency aid package for the Soviet Union designed to
fight food shortages and bolster President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The proportion of grants and loans still had to be decided,
however, and Britain, France, and Germany cautioned against
overloading the troubled Soviet economy with debt.
   Approval of the emergency aid came at the start of a two-day EC
summit.
   ``All, without expection, are in agreement to give immediate
help to the Soviet Union,'' said summit spokesman Pio Mastrobuoni.
   The European leaders said the Soviet food problem had more to do
with poor distribution than with shortages. Italian officials said
the EC food would be targeted for Moscow and Leningrad.
   The EC leaders also were worried about saving Gorbachev, whose
political hold is under constant challenge from opponents,
including hard-liners and various quarters of Soviet society.
   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl denounced attempts to undermine
Gorbachev and warned it would be a lot more costly to the rest of
the world should Gorbachev fall than to offer emergency aid now.
   The United States joined 20 other countries this week in
promising or delivering food aid for the Soviet Union. The U.S.
package included $1.3 billion in loan guarantees to buy U.S. farm
products and manufactured goods.
   The Soviet government said on Thursday it had already received
1,700 tons of food and 800 tons of medicine and other aid for the
difficult winter ahead.
   As the Soviet Union tries to move from a command to a market
economy, it has been unable to prevent shortages caused by its
inadequate distribution system. Many countries believe that food
aid is necessary to give Gorbachev breathing room to implement his
political and economic reforms.
   Earlier today, Prime Minister John Major of Britain urged the
European Community at the start of the key summit today not to rush
into a single currency in its drive for European unity.
   ``I don't think anybody in the community wants confrontation,''
said Major, who replaced Margaret Thatcher last month after her
combative stance in Europe helped topple the longtime British
leader.
   But he added, ``We can't just leap at it (a single currency).
... We need to see if it works. We need to see if people want it.''
   His remarks appeared aimed at signaling that Britain without
Mrs. Thatcher will not be trapped into going along with radical
union plans rather than face continued isolation.
   But in a tone markedly different from the resounding
denunciations of Mrs. Thatcher, Major cautioned, ``Europe has to
march together ... We (Britain) must negotiate in a constructive
spirit, and so must our partners.''
   Major, 47, spoke to reporters at his hotel in between a
pre-summit round of separate talks with Italian Premier Giulio
Andreotti, the summit chairman, Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers
and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany.
   The two-day summit, held in the flag-bedecked Italian
Parliament, also will debate the Persian Gulf crisis.
   In a letter Thursday to Andreotti, President Bush said Iraq's
release of foreign hostages should not lessen pressure on Iraq to
pull out of Kuwait.
   ``We must continue to maintain a very rigid attitude,'' Bush
said, according to Italian officials.
   In the pre-summit meetings, Major told Kohl ``most people of his
generation and younger take a very positive view of the community -
it's in the national self-interest,'' said a British official. He
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   But despite the warmth, Major faced treading a difficult path
between ending British isolation and being swept up in the
French-German drive for European union.
   At the October summit, Andreotti cornered Mrs. Thatcher by
getting the others to agree to establish a single central banking
system - the prelude to one currency - by January 1994.
   On political union, Britain has shifted toward French and German
proposals for giving the Community a formal role in security.
   The EC nations are Italy, France, Britain, Ireland, Spain,
Portugal, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Greece, Denmark and
Germany.

   A $750 million mission to study the
sun's poles is in danger because the Ulysses spacecraft is wobbling
for reasons U.S. and European flight controllers don't fully
understand.
   The malfunction developed Nov. 4, about four weeks after the
spacecraft was launched by the shuttle Discovery, The Associated
Press has learned. The spacecraft was 40.6 million miles from Earth
today.
   Officials of NASA and the European Space Agency confirmed the
problem's existence during interviews this week.
   Willis Meeks, Ulysses project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, said he is optimistic engineers can repeatedly use the
spacecraft's thrusters to minimize the wobble when Ulysses becomes
the first spacecraft to orbit the sun's poles during 1994 and 1995.
   ``I don't foresee that anybody here or in Europe is going to
write off this mission as a failure,'' said Ed Smith, NASA's chief
scientist for Ulysses. ``It's a question of how much of the cake
you want to have.''
   If corrective maneuvering is successful, Ulysses would lose only
20 percent of the information it was designed to collect, but if it
fails, ``we would stand to lose 90 percent of the data,'' said
Edgar Page, Ulysses science coordinator for the European Space
Agency.
   Smith was less pessimistic than Page, saying that at worst,
Ulysses would be unable to transmit 70 percent to 75 percent of the
information it was designed to collect.
   The wobble threatens the mission because it makes it difficult
for Ulysses to keep its main dish-shaped antenna pointed at Earth
to transmit the information it collects.
   The malfunctioning spacecraft is the latest headache for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which has been
bedeviled by space shuttle fuel leaks, trouble with the Hubble
Space Telescope and major glitches with an observatory that flew
aboard shuttle Columbia this month.
   Ulysses is a joint mission of the European Space Agency, which
supplied the spacecraft and half its science instruments, and NASA,
which built the remaining instruments, launched the spacecraft and
is tracking it. The mission cost is $750 million, including $250
million for the spacecraft.
   Ulysses is now flying toward Jupiter. The planet's gravity will
act like a slingshot in 1992 to hurl Ulysses out of the plane in
which the planets orbit the sun. Ulysses then will fly over the
sun's polar regions in 1994 and 1995.
   The slow wobble unexpectedly developed Nov. 4 when Ulysses
extended a 24{-foot-long antenna boom, which is different than the
main antenna. The boom was designed to study radio signals and
solar wind waves.
   ``We aren't sure why it's happening,'' Page said.
   Meeks said the leading theory is that heat from the sun is
warming one side of the boom while the other side remains cool,
causing the boom to bend. The boom then makes the entire spacecraft
wobble like an off-balance washing machine when it spins. It was
designed to spin to prevent wobbling.

   A C-5 military transport plane took off Friday from Frankfurt
carrying Ambassador to Kuwait Nathaniel Howell among the 23
Americans aboard and 10 non-U.S. citizen family members, officials
said. The plane was headed to Andrews Air Force Base outside
Washington.
   Looking surprisingly fit after months of surviving on canned

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified Friday before the House Armed
Services Committee. On Thursday, several military officers told the
panel that bombs and bullets, not economic sanctions, were the way
to pry Saddam Hussein from Kuwait.
   The Pentagon said Cheney and Powell will travel to Saudi Arabia
on Tuesday to visit American troops and to meet with Saudi
government officials.

   In London, a report released Friday by the Medical Campaign
Against Nuclear Weapons said plans being made for gulf war
casualties will be inadequate.
   The group, citing a report last month by the Washington-based
Center for Defense Information, anticipates military and civilian
casualties of 314,000, including 63,000 dead, in a conflict between
Iraq and the U.S.-led multinational force arrayed against it in the
gulf.
   A British Ministry of Defense spokeswoman, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said the medical group was speculating wildly on
numbers.

   A flight surgeon who has been denied conscientious objector
status is hoping his 2-week-old hunger strike will get him out of

Capt. David Wiggins says he has lost 17 of the 167 pounds he
carried on his 5-foot-10-inch frame before he began subsisting on
vitamins and water Nov. 30.
   Wiggins, 28, said on Thursday that he expects to be deployed
from Fort Hood, Texas to the gulf on Monday.

<HEAD>Thousands of Sudanese Famine Deaths Likely, Says U.S. Official</HEAD>

   Tens of thousands of people will die in
Sudan next year even if the government permits an international
relief effort, a senior U.S. aid official said today.
   ``It will be impossible under the best possible circumstances to
avoid starvation deaths in Sudan,'' said Andrew Natsios, head of
the U.S. Office for Disaster Assistance. ``We don't have that
situation.''
   Natsios said 1.2 million tons of food will be needed to feed a
third of the nation in 1991. Of that amount, only about 200,000
tons has been pledged by donor nations. All of Sudan apart from
some eastern regions has been struck by two years of drought.
   People already have begun moving to Sudan's capital, Khartoum,
from the most seriously effected regions and are forming feeding
camps, said Rich Machmer, the head of the U.S. International Agency
for Development (AID) office in Khartoum.
   Many of the estimated 1 million people who died in the 1984-85
Ethiopia famine did so in such unhygienic camps from disease and
diarrhea.
   Machmer, who was AID's chief in Ethiopia during that famine,
said the food crisis in Sudan is more severe and threatens 8 to 9
million people.
   Hindering the launch of a major relief effort is the Sudan
government's refusal to admit it has an emergency.
   ``We have got to get the cooperation of the Sudanese government
in this whole effort or it's not going to work,'' said Natsios in a
briefing on the work of a regional meeting to coordinate the U.S.
response to famines in Sudan and Ethiopia.
   ``It is safe to say there will be tens of thousands of deaths,''
said Natsios. ``But we want to keep them as low as possible.''
   The military regime of Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir has
acknowledged a ``food gap'' of a million tons, but has refused to
respond to Western donors' urgings that he declare a state of
emergency.
   On Monday, el-Bashir said he would accept food donations only if
his government is in charge of transportaion and distribution.
   Natsios did not comment on the demand, but the United States has
criticized the government for alleged attacks on grain stocks to
keep them from reaching areas controlled by southern rebels.
   In the past, Western donors and the United Nations have insisted
on at least partial involvement in transportation and distribution
to make sure the aid gets to those in need.
   The relief effort also faces severe logistical problems in
Sudan, a vast impoverished nation of 24 million people where trains
don't run, river barges don't move and telephones don't work. The
neglected road network does not extend far beyond Khartoum.
   Those most imperiled by the current famine are in western an
southern regions difficult to reach.
   In order to get aid to people before it's too late, 125,000 tons
of relief food needs to arrive at Port Sudan in the next two weeks
and continue arriving monthly throughout the year, said Machmer.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Qian Qichen indicated today that
China will not be moved by the forthcoming visit of a U.S. human
rights envoy who is expected to call for the release of jailed
democracy activists.
   In a lengthy article excerpted in the official Guangming Daily,
Qian said Western countries that criticized China's domestic
policies, especially the United States, already have relaxed their
stance without China making concessions.
   ``China was not forced to submit, nor was it isolated,'' he
wrote in the article, which is to appear in full in this week's
issue of the Communist Party magazine ``Seek Truth.''
   ``There are still some Americans making indiscreet remarks about
other countries' internal affairs. We hope they will clearly see
that although it gives us some difficulties if they cause trouble
for China, it also hurts American interests,'' Qian said.
   The same hard line was reflected in a protest the Foreign
Ministry lodged today with the Norwegian government. The ministry
said a recent meeting between Norwegian Foreign Minister Thorvald
Stotenberg and escaped Chinese dissident Chai Ling was a ``gross
interference in China's internal affairs.''
   Ms. Chai, a student, is wanted by Chinese police for her leading
role in last year's massive pro-democracy protests. She fled after
the Chinese army opened fire on the demonstrators, killing
hundreds.
   Qian's article appeared three days before the arrival of Richard
Schifter, U.S. assistant secretary of state for human rights and
humanitarian affairs.
   The U.S. government announced two weeks ago, while Qian was in
Washington, that Schifter would visit but has not said what he
plans to discuss. He is expected to plead the cause of hundreds of
students, intellectuals and others who remain jailed for taking
part in the demonstrations.
   The visit is an attempt by the Bush administration to
demonstrate its concern for human rights in China even while it
eases sanctions against Beijing. The United States and other
industrialized democracies halted easy-term loans and weapons sales
to China and froze high-level exchanges after the democracy
movement was crushed.
   Most of the sanctions have crumbled as the West has sought
China's cooperation in the United Nations in pressuring Iraq to
withdraw from Kuwait. The European Community lifted all sanctions
except the ban on weapons sales in October.
   Although Washington said its ban on high-level exchanges remains
in place, Qian's official visit to Washington appeared to rob the
sanction of its meaning. The United States also has restored
credits for exports to China, allowed the World Bank to resume
lending to China and ended special restrictions on technology
transfers.
   Qian wrote that the lifting of sanctions showed the West
recognized China's role in the United Nations in solving the gulf
crisis and the Cambodian conflict ``is a weighty one.''
   Official and ordinary Americans ``all want to restore
Chinese-American relations as quickly as possible,'' he said. He
said China wants to increase its foreign ties but added, ``We won't
beg from any country.''

   The European Community today approved a
$1 billion emergency food aid package for the Soviet Union in the
latest promise to help feed the Soviets during their long, harsh
winter.
   The Swedish and U.S. governments, which had hesitated at sending
food aid to the Soviet Union, joined 19 other countries this week
in promising or delivering help. The Soviet government said
Thursday it had already received 1,700 tons of food and 800 tons of
medicine and other aid.
   Here is a breakdown of the international aid offered so far:
   -The $1 billion from the European Community will be in grants
and loans but the proportion of each has not been decided.
   -President Bush said Wednesday he was making the Soviets
eligible for up to $1 billion in credits to buy U.S. agricultural
products ranging from grain to cheese. U.S. private aid groups,
including AmeriCares and CARE, have sent at least 50 tons of
medical supplies and food packages.
   -The German government has approved shipment of the Berlin
stockpile 214,500 tons of meat, milk and medicine stored for 40
years to thwart another Soviet blockade - plus 35,000 tons of army
reserve supplies. The Red Cross, CARE, Roman Catholic and Lutheran
aid agencies have sent truck convoys and air shipments with tons of
food worth several hundred thousand dollars.
   -The Japanese government says it will provide technological
assistance in transportation and distribution. The municipal
government of Kawasaki, south of Tokyo, sent the first Japanese aid
Tuesday - 92,300 dollars worth of hypodermic needles, syringes and
other medical supplies.
   -The Swedish government has granted export credits for Soviet
buyers to import 500,000 tons of wheat, and would soon grant
credits for another one million tons. A private doctors' relief
group sent three trucks to Leningrad this week carrying meat,
powdered milk and medicines.
   -The Norwegian government has appropriated $1.7 million for food
aid to be distributed mainly in the Arctic border region.
Individual Norwegians and church groups have sent food and clothes.
   -The British government in November established a ``know-how
fund'' of nearly $10 million to give technical assistance in
agriculture and food distribution over two years. British
schoolchildren are collecting canned food.
   -Swiss Army volunteers plan to drive a convoy of 320 tons of
food from army stocks to Moscow and Leningrad after Jan. 1. The
Swiss government promised a 40-ton emergency airlift and said 1,000
tons of Swiss cheese were available.
   -The Italian group Together for Peace has shipped nearly 100
tons of cheese, milk, vegetables and medical supplies.
   -In Israel, the Jewish Agency, a quasi-governmental group which
resettles Soviet emigres, sent 25 tons of fruit, vegetables and
powdered milk.
   -Austria has promised 100,000 food parcels and medical supplies.
   -Australia signed an agreement in Moscow on Nov. 25 to give the
Soviet Union up to $400 million worth of credits to buy Australian
wool, wheat and other commodities.
   -Spain, France and Canada have offered financial aid to buy
food.
   -India plans to loan the Soviets 1 million tons of wheat and to
give 20,000 tons of rice as well as medicines, medical supplies and
processed food.

   A suspicious fire whipped by high wind
roared through a densely populated city block early today,
destroying at least seven three-family houses and forcing dozens of
families to flee.
   No deaths or serious injuries were reported, but at least seven
firefighters and three residents suffered minor injuries.
   ``It's amazing there is no loss of life,'' said Revere Fire
Inspector Gene Dougherty, who described the neighborhood as ``the
most congested in the city.''
   Authorities said the fire was one of three suspicious blazes
overnight within a half-mile or so in this working-class suburb
north of Boston. The other two were far less serious.
   All fire equipment in the Boston metropolitan area was made
available to Revere, and at least 17 departments sent men.
   Revere Mayor George Colella declared a state of emergency in the
city. He said the blaze displaced 125 to 160 residents of the
neighborhood of mostly Asian, Hispanic and Portuguese residents.
   ``I could smell the fire,'' said Yn Koeut, who fled with his
son, Savam, 13. ``I wake up and saw the burning on Highland
(Avenue). I call police. They told me to go to the Red Cross.''
   The third and worst of the three suspicious fires started about
2:45 a.m. in a boarded-up building, and wind gusting up to 30 mph
blew embers that spread the blaze to nearby occupied homes. It was
declared under control at 6:40 a.m.
   The wind combined with temperatures in the 20s to produce a
wind-chill effect of near zero, and firemen had to work on
ice-covered streets. Some fire engines were completely encased in
ice.
   The three-story frame buildings, common to the region, are
called ``triple-deckers'' and were built to accommodate three
families.
   Fire Chief James Connery declared the fire a conflagration,
``the highest level of fire you can declare. When you declare a
conflagration, mutual aid automatically takes over.''
   Asked if the fire was related to the two other suspicious fires
in the city overnight, Connery said said it seemed to be. Police
said they were looking for a white car that had been seen behind
buildings in the area.
   ``I can't tell definitely that they were deliberately set, but
it certainly looks that way,'' Connery said. ``There were too many
fires in too short a time.''
   Police Capt. Harold Fulton said officers were patrolling to
prevent looting. He said there were no reports of any looting.
   Al Barbosa, 25, whose house escaped the flames, said he and
others helped evacuate three buildings. He said some of those
rescued were invalids, ``and some didn't even know there was a
fire. They were still asleep.''
   ``My tenant and I went up on the roof with buckets of water to
try to keep the embers from catching, but eventually the firemen
ordered us out,'' said David Coderre, owner of the tenement across
the street from where the fire started.
   The fire gutted his building. ``I had everything in there,''
said Roberta Stairs, his third-floor tenant and the mother of
eight. ``I don't know what we'll do for Christmas now.''

   South Korean President Roh Tae-woo and President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev today signed a declaration of ``trust and
cooperation'' between the two countries, the Tass news agency
reported.
   Roh, the first leader in South Korea's history to visit the
Soviet Union, was also expected to sign a trade agreement with the
Soviets. He arrived in Moscow on Thursday and concluded talks with
Gorbachev today.
   Reports in South Korea said Roh would offer loans of $2.5
billion to the Soviet Union during his trip. Diplomatic sources in
Seoul said Gorbachev is expected to visit South Korea before or
after his trip to Japan in the spring.
   The preamble of the declaration signed today said the two
countries ``are fully determined to build their relations in the
spirit of good-neighborliness, trust and cooperation,'' Tass said.
   The declaration called for easing tensions between North and
South Korea and ``the establishment of a climate of trust for the
sake of future unification.'' It said the two sides will coordinate
efforts to fight international terrorism, organized crime and
illegal drug trafficking, as well joining forces to protect the
environment.
   Gorbachev and Roh also agreed to establish relations in the
political, economic, trade, cultural, scientific, and humanitarian
fields, Tass said.
   Roh is scheduled to hold two rounds of talks with Gorbachev and
visit Leningrad before returning home Monday.
   Roh and his wife were welcomed in a formal ceremony at St.
George's Hall in the Kremlin Thursday by Gorbachev and his wife,
Raisa.
   ``Our two countries have closed the chapter on the Cold War and
opened a new era of peace and cooperation,'' Roh said in an arrival
statement distributed by Tass.
   Before he left Seoul, Roh said his trip signified the imminent
end of hostilities with his country's bitter rival North Korea, a
longtime ally of the Soviet Union.
   ``The opening of the road for friendship and cooperation between
us and the Soviet Union is directly related to opening a road for
peace and unification of the Korean Peninsula,'' he said.
   After reaching a low point in 1983 when a Soviet fighter jet
shot down Korean Air Flight 007 that had strayed over Soviet
airspace, killing all 269 people aboard, relations between the two
countries improved rapidly after Moscow sent a large delegation to
the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.
   In June, Gorbachev and Roh met in San Francisco and agreed to
normalize relations. Formal diplomatic ties were established Sept.
30.

   Assailants shot and killed a rural
union leader who had defied powerful sugar barons in northeastern
Brazil, police said today.
   Police said Jose Helio da Silva was shot down in a sugar cane
field Thursday near the Farm Workers Union in Palmares, a
sugar-producing town in Pernambuco state, 1,600 miles northeast of
Sao Paulo.
   Palmares police chief Joaquim Donati said da Silva and union
treasurer Jose Cicero Leite were driving along a highway when a car
started chasing them.
   ``They stopped the car and hid in a cane field but the gunmen
found them,'' Donati said in a telephone interview. He said da
Silva was ``shot once in the back and died instantly. Leite was
wounded in the left leg.''
   The slaying occurred on the second day of the trial of two
ranchers accused of ambushing and killing environmentalist and
union leader Chico Mendes in Brazil's Amazon region in 1988. The
trial has focused worldwide attention on a cause advocated by
Mendes, preserving the Brazilian rain forest from ranchers and
farmers who are cutting it down and, according to some
environomentalists, thereby threatening a vital ecosystem and the
lifestyles of jungle residents. Da Silva recently received an
anonymous letter warning that he would ``end up like Chico
Mendes,'' according to the president of the Farm Workers Union,
Joao Luca da Silva.
   ``We are sure the gunmen were hired by our enemies, the sugar
and (fuel) alcohol producers of the region,'' said Luca da Silva,
who is not related to the victim. ``They wanted him dead because he
was an excellent strike organizer and was always demanding better
working conditions and decent wages for sugar cane cutters.''
   Donati said the shooting ``could have been a personal vendetta.
Da Silva had a daily radio program in which he always offended all
kinds of people in the region.'' Donati would not say if sugar and
fuel alcohol producers were among those da Silva insulted in his
program.
   The Association of Sugar and Alcohol Producers, reached by
telephone, said no one was available to comment on the union
accusations.

   Alfred Dennis Sieminski, a onetime Democratic
member of Congress from New Jersey who served as an Army officer in
World War II and Korea, died Thursday. He was 79.
   Friends said Sieminski collapsed and died while attending the
annual Christmas party of the McLean, Va., Kiwanis Club. He was a
resident of the nearby suburb of Vienna.
   A native of Jersey City, N.J., and a 1934 graduate of Princeton
University, Sieminski also studied at Hamburg Uuniversity in
Germany, the University of Warsaw and Harvard University Law
School.
   At Princeton he was a member of the university boxing team and
was a member of the Princeton crew which raced at the Henley
Regatta in England.
   When the United States entered World War II he enlisted as a
private. He ended the war as a captain in the military government
division in Austria after service in the Italian campaign. He was
discharged to the infantry reserve as a major in 1950 and promoted
to lieutenant colonel in the reserves in 1956.
   Sieminski was elected to Congress in 1951. He won re-election
three times but was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination in
1958.
   He worked at the Medical and General Reference Library at the
Veterans' Administration from 1962 to 1973.
   He is survived by his wife, the former Countess Marie Felice
Czarkowski-Golejewska; two stepdaughters, Isabella Noyes of San
Francisco and Christine Elizabeth Andreoni of Sydney, Australia; a
stepson, Professor Roman Mycielski of the University of Warsaw, and
five grandchildren.

   At the Vostyakovsky cemetery in southwest Moscow, Sakharov's
headstone was covered in evergreen branches and carnations of all
colors. Red sashes were hung on wreaths, including one from the
Congress of People's Deputies of Russia.
   ``It's common knowledge that Sakharov was a man of genius, but
he also linked genius with civil courage, which I value even
more,'' said Valery Zlemin, who had come to the cemetery to mark
the anniversary of Sakharov's death. ``Civil courage is turning
words into action.''
   In the year since Sakahrov's death at age 68, friends and
colleagues in the human rights movement have battled for his cause,
but they say no one has emerged to take his place.
   Baruch Froyimovich, a 67-year-old pensioner, said: ``I can't see
anybody today who could take his place.''
   But, Froyimovich said, he was optimistic about the future.
``There are enough people in Russia who are intelligent, talented
and loyal.''
   The Moscow newspaper Leninskoye Znamiya said, ``History has
already had its say on Sakharov. He belongs to it. At the same
time, he is near us, he stayed in the hearts of all who wanted to
have him.''
   Other newspapers printed pictures of Sakharov and reprinted
speeches he made at demonstrations and at the national Supreme
Soviet parliament.
   Since he died of heart failure last year, public esteem has
continued to climb for the physicist who helped invent the Soviet
hydrogen bomb and later won the Nobel Peace Prize for his political
dissidence.
   A decade ago, Sakharov was denounced in the official press as an
``utterly ignorant person'' and banished to the industrial city of
Gorky for criticizing the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. He spent
seven years in exile before being recalled to Moscow by President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1986.
   He later became an outspoken deputy in the Supreme Soviet
parliament and champion of the human rights movement.

   Palestinians today fatally stabbed three
Jews in a factory in this Tel Aviv suburb, and an angry mob of
Israelis responded by attacking Arab cars and passers-by.
   The slayings were carried out to mark the third anniversary of
the founding of Hamas, or Zeal, an extremist Moslem fundamentalist
movement that backs the Palestinian uprising, police said.
   Tel Aviv police spokeswoman Ettie Grinberg said the bodies of
the victims, two male factory workers and a woman secretary, were
discovered in a factory building beneath slogans attributing the
deaths to Hamas.
   Police detained Arab workers from nearby factories for
questioning. Hundreds of angry Jews gathered at the site, shouting
``Death to the Arabs!'' and ``No work for the Arabs!'' and accusing
police of lack of action.
   The windows of one car were smashed as the Arab driver fled, and
it was later set on fire. Two other cars were damaged by stones, an
Arab suffered a minor stab injury and three Jewish rioters were
arrested, police said.
   Reinforcements of paramilitary border police poured into Jaffa
to help control the mob.
   ``Let's do to them what they do to us,'' bellowed one man. ``If
we aren't safe among them, they shouldn't be safe among us.''
   Police Minister Roni Milo said he would propose to the Cabinet
new limitations on Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and the West
Bank entering Israel. He told Israel radio he already had ordered
police to step up efforts to find Arabs staying illegally in the
Jewish state.
   ``All the elements using terrorism must know that cruel
terrorism of the kind we see today will get a harsh and unequivocal
response,'' he said.
   Police blocked journalists from entering the factory, apparently
an aluminum plant. When police brought out the bodies, wrapped in
black plastic bags, the crowd charged at police officers and
reporters, punching and beating them.
   Police Commissioner Yaacov Terner described the slaying as a
``grave event ... The reason for this murder is one, nationalism.
The slogans written in Arabic on the walls inside are clear.''
   Hamas, or Zeal, had called for a day of escalation in the
3-year-old Palestinian uprising today to mark the third anniversary
of the group's founding.
   The call was issued in a clandestine leaflet distributed earlier
in December. The leaflet also urged ``the escalation of Jihad (Holy
War) operation inside and outside Israel.''
   Terner said police were pursuing two Palestinians, one of whom
worked at the factory. Both were from the occupied Gaza Strip, a
stronghold of Hamas. Many Gazans work in Tel Aviv and Jaffa, a
mixed Arab-Jewish suburb.
   The army radio described the two as brothers and Hamas members.
Two suspects were reported detained but released after questioning.
Police later said they were holding no suspects.
   Police officials said roadblocks were erected throughout Tel
Aviv and every car entering Gaza was being carefully searched.
   Police gave the following order of events:
   At about 7 a.m. an Arab from the Gaza Strip who works at the
plant arrived with an accomplice and waited for Jewish staff to
come and open the premises.
   About an hour later Iris Asraf, a 22-year-old secretary, arrived
with Moshe Awan, 40, a metalcutter, and the four entered the plant.
   Yehoshua Hakmaz, 30, an upholsterer working next door, heard
screams soon afterward and ran to help.
   At 8:30 a.m. another secretary, Penina Arbiv, arrived and
entered the plant. She found pools of blood and knives lying on the
floor. She ran out crying for help, and a policeman went in and
found Awan, Hakmaz and Ms. Asraf dead.
   A witness who did not give his name told Israel radio he saw one
man ``lying on the steps, folded like a bag.... The knives were
thrown near the body, long knives with wide blades, real commando
knives.''
   At least 54 Jews have been killed by Palestinians in the revolt
against Israeli rule in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip
that began Dec. 9 1987.
   On Dec. 2 this year, three West Bank Arabs boarded a bus in Tel
Aviv, stabbed a Jew to death and wounded three others. In the
uprising, 778 Arabs have been killed by Israeli troops or
civilians. In addition, Palestinians have murdered 316 fellow Arabs
on suspicion of collaborating with Israel.

<HEAD>U.S. Delegation in Europe to Free Noriega Accounts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. government delegation is in Europe seeking
to unfreeze Manuel Noriega's bank accounts for use in his legal
defense, a federal prosecutor said today.
   The delegation consists of State Department and Justice
Department officials who are visiting Austria and Switzerland, but
most details of their visit are secret, said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Michael Sullivan.
   About $20 million is sitting in 27 Noriega-linked accounts, and
U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler has ordered $6 million of
those funds paid into a trust account to cover attorneys fees and
expenses for the deposed Panamanian dictator, who says he has no
other funds.
   The delegation's visit is ``to discuss the possibility of
unfreezing the accounts that are being designated as the
general's,'' Sullivan said. ``the discussions are ongoing.''
   Until the funds are freed, the judge asked Noriega's defense
counsel to take a temporary appointment as government-paid
attorneys, but they id not immediately respond. Lead attorney
Frank Rubino has previously rejected that arrangement because fees
are limited to a maximum of $75 an hour, far less than the $350 an
hour he says is appropriate in a complex drug-trafficking case.
   The U.S. delegation was sent to Europe after Hoeveler said he
would hold a formal hearing to make prosecutors justify freezing
the assets. That would force them to reveal much of their case in
advance, the defense has said.
   The funds were originally frozen at U.S. request following the
December 1989 invasion of Panama and the subsequent capture of
Noriega.
   But in June, the judge ordered the money unfrozen for Noriega's
defense. Last month, however, federal prosecutors told the judge
that foreign governments had initiated their own forfeiture
proceedings, tying up the money.
   Also at today's hearing, the judge said he would set a new trial
date for Noriega, although some of his co-defendants could be tried
on Jan. 28 as planned. Rubino said the defense could not be ready
before June at the earliest, and Hoeveler said he would take that
under advisement.
   The judge also said he wanted a contempt hearing soon against
CNN to determine if the network violated a court order by
telecasting a taped prison telephone call between Noriega and his
defense team. While transcripts from the tapes eventually were made
public, CNN's decision last month to telecast parts of them despite
a court order is still at issue.
   Noriega attorney Jon May said the network had informed him it
will present a full defense against the contempt citation, a
defense which legal experts have said could once again test the
balance between freedom of speech and the right to a fair trial.
   Noriega is confined in the Metropolitan Correctional Center
outside Miami facing charges of accepting $4.6 million in bribes to
turn Panama into a way station for Colombian drug traffickers.

<TEXT>
   Canadian lawmakers have passed an unpopular new
tax on goods and services, ending months of procedural delays.
   The bill, pushed through the Senate on Thursday night by Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney's Conservatives, now only needs the
formality of royal consent to become law. The vote was 55-49.
   The opposition Liberals were outraged, saying the Conservative
maneuver to end an 11-month filibuster to force the vote was
illegal.
   The goods and services tax, known familiarly as the GST, imposes
a 7 percent federal levy on nearly all merchandise and services
beginning Jan. 1. The tax is added on top of provincial sales
taxes, which range from 8 to 10 percent.
   That means the buying public will have 15 to 17 percent tacked
on to nearly all purchases, including such things as haircuts,
music lessons and even postage.
   The GST has been languishing in the unelected Senate since it
was passed by the House of Commons in April. The bill was taken up
actively with the opening of the autumn session of Parliament on
Sept. 25.
   The Liberals pledged to kill the tax, which polls showed was
opposed by 75 percent to 85 percent of the people.
   More recent polls indicated people were tiring of the debate.
Delaying tactics in the Senate included hooting, catcalls,
shouting, blowing kazoos, interminable reading of petitions name by
name and other delaying measures.
   More than 1.3 million businesses will help the government
collect the tax.
   Many have spent the last few months reprograming their cash
registers and computers and adjusting their pricing in anticipation
of the tax.
   Any delay from the original Jan. 1 deadline for implementation
could throw much of Canadian business into confusion.
   The Liberals held a majority in the Senate until recently.
   In October, Mulroney used an obscure, never-before implemented
section of the constitution that allowed him to ask Queen Elizabeth
II to appoint eight extra senators. By filling vacant seats and
getting the queen to appoint eight more, Mulroney succeeded in
packing the Senate in his favor.
   Angry Liberals said the forced vote violated Senate rules.
   The GST is supposed to replace the 13.5 percent manufacturers
sales tax, which raises about $10 billion a year but is considered
inefficient and levied on a very narrow base. The argument is that
the manufacturers sales tax discriminates heavily against industry
and hurts Canadian exporting firms.
   One of the great fears of the public is that once the GST is
passed, government will be tempted to increase the rate. With such
a broad base, small rate increases can raise enormous amounts of
revenue.

   William Bennett's abrupt decision to reject
the Republican Party's top job leaves the GOP scrambling for a
leader while still reeling from a dispiriting performance in 1990
elections.
   But there are indications the vacuum won't exist too long.
Administration and party sources said Thursday that President Bush
hopes to choose a replacement soon and that the list of candidates
likely will be short.
   Mentioned most frequently as possibilities following Bennett's
surprise announcement Thursday were three Cabinet secretaries -
Samuel Skinner of Transportation, Robert Mosbacher of Commerce and
Jack Kemp of Housing and Urban Development - and attorney Thomas
Loeffler, a former Texas congressman and a close friend of Bush.
   One GOP source said the president spoke with Loeffler about the
job Thursday but had not offered it. A Loeffler associate said
today that Loeffler had spoken to White House chief of staff John
Sununu about the post. The associate said he did not believe
Loeffler had spoken directly to the president.
   ``He is of course interested,'' said the associate, Mike
Johnson, who said Loeffler was in Texas.
   Others mentioned for the job included longtime GOP operative
Rich Bond and Republican National Committeeman Haley Barbour of
Mississippi, a key party strategist in the South.
   Republican sources said Bond is lobbying for the job. But
Barbour said in a telephone interview he wasn't interested, adding,
``I just don't have an interest in it. I am not soliciting the job
and would not want it if asked.''
   Two Republican House members who lost Senate bids, Lynn Martin
of Illinois and Pat Saiki of Hawaii, were considered long shots, as
was Minnesota Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, who lost his re-election bid.
Martin and Saiki are contenders for vacant Cabinet posts at the
Labor and Education departments.
   Bennett, saying ``I didn't take a vow of poverty,'' spurned
Bush's offer to head the Republican National Committee after White
House lawyers told him he'd have to give up a book contract and
other outside income.
   Bush's penchant for surprises left GOP analysts reluctant to
make predictions.
   ``Sam (Skinner) would be a good possibility - there are a lot of
people out there who would be good as chairman but I can't say
anyone is at the top of the list right now,'' said Charles Black, a
political consultant who has been the top RNC spokesman during
Chairman Lee Atwater's battle against an inoperable brain tumor.
   Black, too, was among those mentioned as a potential successor
to his close friend Atwater. But he said he told Bush he was not
interested.
   Democrats took delight in the GOP's embarrassment.
   ``It is appropriate that Bill Bennett's tenure at the RNC lasted
about as long as most of President Bush's campaign promises,''
Democratic Chairman Ron Brown said.
   The RNC meets Jan. 25, with its top priority installing a new
chairman to lead the party into the crucial 1992 elections. The GOP
had a disappointing performance in the Nov. 6 off-year elections,
as Democrats strengthened their hold on Congress and captured the
governorships of Florida and Texas from the GOP.
   Bennett emerged as Bush's pick within weeks of announcing he was
resigning as the nation's drug czar, and Bush made his choice
official on Nov. 30.
   The choice of Bennett was widely interpreted as an attempt by
Bush to make amends with the party's vocal conservative wing, never
high on Bush and openly at war with the White House since the
president dumped his ``no new taxes'' campaign pledge.
   Conservatives demanded that one of their own be tapped in
Bennett's stead.
   ``Now, if the party chairmanship went to a member of the Bush
wing, conservatives would feel seduced and abandoned even more than
before,'' said Richard Viguerie, chairman of United Conservatives
of America. ``The clear message to conservatives would be: we don't
need you.''
   Vigueie and his allies were pushing Kemp for the post. But a
top Kemp aide said the housing secretary was not interested, and
Kemp has several differences with the president on domestic issues,
including taxes.

<HEAD>Japanese Distributor Recalls U.S.-Made Game Because of Derogatory
Terms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S.-manufactured board game that uses derogatory
language toward Japanese minorities is being pulled from store
shelves by its Japanese distributor, a company official said today.
   The instruction manual for the game, ``Land of Ninja,'' uses a
disparaging name for a former Japanese outcast class and calls
another minority group ``barbarians.''
   ``We have decided to completely stop selling the game because
some people have objected to it,'' said Kosuke Fukumoto, an
official of Hobby Japan Co., the distributor.
   He said the company also has halted plans to produce a
Japanese-language version of the role-playing game, which is based
on feudal Japanese society.
   Although less than 200 copies of the game were sold in Japan at
a list price of $35, the distributor moved quickly to withdraw it
after it was criticized by the Buraku Liberation League.
   The league, which claims 200,000 members, has fought
discrimination faced by burakumin, a former outcast group estimated
to number between 1 million and 3 million out of Japan's total
population of 123 million.
   Hundreds of years ago, the burakumin, or village people, worked
in religiously proscribed occupations such as butchering and
leather working. They lived in special neighborhoods, or buraku,
and when maps were drawn, the buraku were omitted.
   Although racially identical to other Japanese, the burakumin
continue to face difficulties in employment and marriage more than
100 years after their outcast status was officially abolished in
1871.
   Japan's family registry system allows people to be traced to
their ancestral communities, although public access to the
registries has been limited in recent years.
   ``We definitely feel there are serious problems with the game,''
a league official said.
   The league said it plans to send a delegation to the United
States to meet with the maker of the game, Baltimore-based Avalon
Hill Game Co.
   In the game, players make a journey after being assigned roles
such as samurai warrior, ninja, or Buddhist priest. The manual
describes feudal Japan by dividing all occupations into four
descending hierarchical groups - nobles, samurai, commoners and
eta.
   The latter term, a derogatory name for burakumin meaning ``great
filth,'' is defined in the game as ``those outside normal society
such as ninja, thieves and entertainers.''
   The game, introduced in 1987, also refers to native Ainu people,
another minority, as ``barbarian inhabitants'' of northern Japan.
   In reporting the game's withdrawal, several Japanese newspapers
suggested a comparison between U.S. insensitivity to Japanese
minority issues and Japanese insensitivity to American racial
problems.
   In September, U.S. minority groups demanded the dismissal of
Justice Minister Seiroku Kajiyama after he compared American blacks
to prostitutes in Japan. He said prostitutes ``ruin the atmosphere
of the neighborhoods they move into. The area is becoming mixed
just like in America, where blacks move in and whites are forced
out.''
   Kajiyama apologized for the remarks, and Prime Minister Toshiki
Kaifu pledged to improve Japanese understanding of U.S. minority
issues.

   Private sanitation workers have agreed to a
tentative settlement of a strike that has left mounds of
uncollected garbage growing on sidewalks, union and city officials
said.
   City Labor Relations Commissioner Eric Schmertz announced the
agreement Thursday evening after meeting with union and management
representatives for about seven hours.
   Teamsters Local 813 recording secretary Marty Adelstein
confirmed the agreement today and said the union was recommending
its passage. A ratification vote was scheduled for this afternoon.
   Neither Adelstein nor Schmertz would disclose the terms of the
contract. A spokesman for management did not return phone messages
left this morning.
   The walkout was in its fifth day today. The 2,100 striking
workers pick up trash from some 250,000 businesses citywide.
Residential garbage collection - done by the city - is unaffected.
   Besides better wages, the unions want private carters to pay a
fee for using out-of-state workers to haul trash to out-of-state
dumps - a demand the companies have rejected.
   New York's $1 billion private sanitation industry was last
struck in 1981 for 17 days, during which frigid weather helped ease
the public health threat. In that case, the strike ended just as
the mayor's office issued a citywide order for municipal crews to
start collecting the garbage.
   This year the weather has been mild - Thursday's high was around
60 degrees.
   Businesses who fear their garbage could be a health or fire
hazard can request an emergency pickup from the city Sanitation
Department.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A London newspaper today quoted sources close to
the public inquiry into the 1988 Pan Am Flight 103 bombing as
saying they have proof that Libya was responsible.
   The Independent quoted the unidentified high-level sources as
saying the conclusion was based on analysis of a detonator fragment
found in a field close to the southern Scottish town of Lockerbie.
It said the evidence had come to light only in the past three
months.
   The newspaper said the confirmation of Libyan involvement
refutes a theory that Syrian-based Palestinian faction was
responsible for the bombing.
   It quoted the sources as saying action now against Libya could
alienate Arab members of the international force in the Persian
Gulf - and for that reason no indictments had been issued against
the major suspects.
   A spokesman for the Lord Advocate, Lord Fraser, Scotland's
senior law officer, said he could not comment on ``media
speculation.''
   ``But indictments are not being drawn up,'' said the spokesman,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Boeing 747 was blown up over Lockerbie on Dec. 21, 1988
while on its way to New York. All 259 people on board and 11 others
on the ground were killed. The flight originated in Frankfurt,
Germany, with a stop at London's Heathrow airport.
   Investigators have concluded that a bomb hidden in a
radio-cassette recorder was responsible for the explosion, but
speculation has varied wildly on which group planned the bombing.
   A public inquiry into the bombing opened at Dumfries near
Lockerbie on Oct. 1. It was adjourned on Dec. 7 until Jan. 22.
   Previous reports had speculated that the bombing was planned by
a German-based cell of the radical Damascus-based Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, headed by Ahmed
Jibril. The Palestinians reportedly made the bomb with Semtex, a
Czechoslovak explosive.
   The Independent quoted the sources as saying the detonator
fragment was identical to a Swiss-manufactured fragment found in a
radio-cassette bomb seized from two Libyan secret agents arrested
at Dakar airport in Senegal in February 1988, 10 months before the
Flight 103 attack.
   The paper reported: ``Reports of possible Libyan involvement
have surfaced recently in the French and U.S. media but, for the
first time, senior sources have now confirmed that proof exists
implicating (Libyan leader) Col. Moammar Gadhafi's regime.''
   It quoted one of the sources as saying: ``Not only do we now
know Gadhafi was responsible, he also knows we know.''
   The paper quoted the sources as saying any U.S. action against
Libya would risk alienating Arab members of the U.S.-led
multinational force arrayed against Iraq in the Persian Gulf.
   ``For that reason no indictments have yet been issued against
the prime suspects and the force of Scottish detectives in charge
of the criminal investigation into the bombing has not formally
been given the new evidence by other elements of the international
inquiry team,'' it reported.
   The team includes members of the FBI, CIA and German and British
intelligence agencies.

   They were last year's heartwarming
Christmas story - a man giving his brother a $9 million lottery
ticket. But the gift Earl Havlock gave his brother this year was a
lawsuit demanding the money back.
   The suit was filed in Superior Court on Monday, the same day the
commission that operates the Tri-State Megabucks lottery issued a
news release recalling last year's events and saying the brothers
epitomized ``the spirit of the holidays.''
   ``They did last year, that's for sure,'' New Hampshire
Sweepstakes Director James Wimsatt said Thursday. ``Times change.''
   Earl, 43, won the Tri-State Megabucks lottery jackpot two days
before Christmas last year and turned his winning ticket over to
Elwood, 50. After taxes, the prize amounted to 20 annual payments
of $357,600. The first payment was made last December.
   Earl, three other brothers and a sister claim that Earl is
mentally disabled and had no intention of giving away his winnings.
The petition says Earl told sweeps officials and the public that he
bought the winning ticket as a Christmas present for Elwood - which
wasn't true - after Elwood told him that holding onto the jackpot
would jeopardize his monthly disability payments.
   Earl, who is unable to work, was getting by on Social Security
checks and money from Elwood last year when he bought the ticket.
   At the time, he said that the ticket for the Maine-New
Hampshire-Vermont lottery was a Christmas gift and he never
considered keeping it, even after he knew it was a winner.
   ``His brother's advice was to misrepresent to the Tri-State
Megabucks Commission that this was a gift from Earl to Elwood,''
said the plaintiffs' lawyer, Robert Foley. ``But a side deal to
require Elwood to share the money with all six was not made public.
That's the deception that is coming back to haunt all of them.''
   Foley said it boils down to an agreement that has not worked out
as the brothers and sister had hoped.
   ``It is important for the Havlocks to let people know they are
not angry at their brother, Elwood,'' he said. ``They felt this
litigation is necessary to set the record straight.''
   Foley said Earl has a mental disability, saying he is ``very
unsophisicated, perhaps gullible and not very knowledgeable about
money or the law.''
   Foley said part of the reason for filing the suit was that
Elwood's wife, Rowena, is claiming a portion of the winnings in a
divorce action.
   ``Rowena was making claim on half the jackpot,'' he said.
   There was no answer at Elwood's home this morning. His lawyer,
Stephen Kain of Laconia, could not comment because he was in a
meeting, a secretary said today.
   Wimsatt said unless the court rules otherwise, the money will
continue to go to Elwood because he signed the form claiming the
lottery prize.
   ``We honor the winner claim form as presented,'' he said. ``He
gave it to his brother and his brother filed a claim.''

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday received
the Nobel Peace Prize medal and a cash award in a Kremlin ceremony,
and he said he would donate the money to medical centers, Tass
reported.
   The diploma, medal and cash were given to Gorbachev by First
Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoly Kovalev, who traveled to Oslo,
Norway, on Monday to receive the prize on behalf of the Soviet
president.
   Gorbachev said he had decided to donate the $715,000 prize
money, and the $450,000 from Italy's Fiuggi Prize given him earlier
this year, to children's medical centers.
   ``I think the money should be spent on health-promoting
activities for children, first of all in ecological disasters,''
Tass quoted Gorbachev as saying.
   The Norwegian Nobel Committee said in Oslo that the 71st Peace
Prize was a recognition of Gorbachev's international efforts more
than his domestic policies.
   Domestic problems prevented the Soviet leader from traveling to
Oslo to collect the prize.

   The former interior minister under
Communist rule, Frantisek Kincl, was taken into custody on charges
of abusing his power, the CTK news agency said Friday.
   Other news reports said Kincl had been charged and faced up to
10 years in prison if found guilty.
   CTK quoted the prosecutor's office as saying the former interior
minister was interrogated at a military prosecutor's office in
Pribram in central Bohemia, then arrested.
   The daily Lidove Noviny said Kincl's former first deputy, Alojz
Lorenz, and counter-intelligence chief Karel Vykypel also were
charged with abuse of power.
   It said the three were accused of trying to stop dissident
activities in 1988-1989 by detaining or harassing activists.
   So far, former Prague Communist Party chief Miroslav Stepan is
the only leading official to have been convicted since the
country's revolution against communism last year. He was given a
30-month prison term.

   A department store sales clerk proved
to be the main ingredient to a heartwarming recipe when he found a
money bag containing proceeds from a church bake sale and luncheon.
   Donald Lavoie, 39, was driving Thursday when he spotted it.
   ``I picked up the bag and it jingled,'' said Lavoie. ``I saw
that it was a bank bag and immediately took it to the police
department. I didn't even open it, but I knew there had to be a lot
of money in there.''
   Police discovered a bank deposit slip inside.
   It turned out that Carol Chapman had placed the bag on her car's
roof when she went to run errands - which were supposed to include
the bank deposit - and it fell off.
   She wasn't aware the bag was missing until she reached the bank.
   ``That was when panic set in,'' Chapman said. ``I called the
police and lo and behold, this wonderful man had picked it up and
turned it in.''
   Police said the bag contained $547 in cash and $249 in checks
raised at the First Congregational Church of Christ.
   Chapman offered Lavoie a $100 reward. He initially refused to
take it. But she insisted, telling him he could donate the money to
charity if he desired.
   Lavoie, who recently retired from te Air Force after 20 years,
said he donated the money to the Special Olympics because his son
is mentally handicapped and the program has helped him.
   ``It was a wonderful, wonderful experience,'' Chapman said. ``It
certainly restored my faith in mankind.''

   A casino executive apologized to Gov. Jim
Florio for elevating the mosquito to the status of New Jersey state
bird and gave the governor a 12-foot pink flyswatter to take the
sting out of the remark.
   John Allan, president of Carnival's Crystal Palace in Nassau,
The Bahamas, conceded at a news conference Thursday with Florio
that promotional material for his casino maligned the state.
   The material distributed earlier this year contained a
flyswatter and the text read: ``It's muggy out there. That's why
they've made the mosquito New Jersey's state bird.''
   Florio protested and called on Allan to recant in a strongly
worded letter in August. Allan told The Associated Press at the
time that the governor was overreacting.
   Allan, who lives in Absecon, said he pays the state a high
compliment by ``living in New Jersey and commuting to the
Bahamas.''
   ``I'd like to take a last swat if I could,'' Allan said
Thursday, grabbing the 12-foot flyswatter and throwing it to the
floor of the governor's outer office.
   ``The mosquito as New Jersey's bird ... that bugged me a lot,''
Florio said, accepting the apology.

<HEAD>Ozone Hole Shrinking as Summer Returns to Antarctica</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With spring arriving in the Southern
Hemisphere, the Antarctic ozone hole is closing for the season,
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminsitration scientists reported
Friday.
   The hole is filling in late this year, said Samuel B. Oltmans of
NOAA's Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory in Boulder,
Colo.
   The delay was caused by a circle of persistent winds surrounding
the Antarctic continent, which prevented air there from mixing with
the atmosphere from other regions.
   NOAA reported that ozone levels over Antarctica climbed to 220
dobson units on Dec. 6 and to 270 units by Dec. 10, according to
measurements made by instruments sent aloft by balloons.
   Ozone over the South Pole reached a low of 130 dobson units in
early October, only marginally above the record low measured in
1987.
   That thinning of the layer is sometimes referred to as a hole,
although it amounts to somewhat less than half of the normal ozone
level of over 300 units in that part of the world.
   Ozone, while considered a pollutant at ground level, is vital in
the upper atmosphere, where it blocks a portion of the hazardous
ultraviolet radiation from the sun.
   A reduction in ozone could lead to damage to crops and animal
life and an increase in skin cancer among humans, some scientists
warm.
   Researchers are concerned that loss of ozone over the Antarctic
could indicate a reduction in other areas also, although evidence
has yet to be found of such a reduction.
   The ozone thinning occurs as chemicals react with that gas in
the extreme cold of the upper atmosphere in winter. Now that summer
is returning to Antarctica, warmer temperatures inhibit those
chemical reactions and the ozone hole begins to fill in again.
   The dobson unit is a measurement of ozone made by comparing how
much of each of two wavelengths of sunlight is absorbed by the air.
That ratio changes depending on the concentration of ozone.

   The last U.S. evacuation flight headed home today as Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney kept the pressure on Baghdad, telling
Congress that ``patience is not producing results'' in world
efforts to push Iraq from Kuwait.
   Two Republican senators said today that President Bush is
prepared to call off planned U.S.-Iraqi talks on the Persian Gulf
crisis because the two nations have been unable to agree when to
meet. But the White House said that while Bush is upset with Iraq
he is not prepared to abandon efforts to hold talks.
   A group of pacifist physicians said today the West is unprepared
to cope with the thousands of people who could be injured or killed
if fighting breaks out in the gulf, while other doctors headed to
the region to try to avert war.
   A C-5 military transport plane took off from Frankfurt carrying
Ambassador to Kuwait Nathaniel Howell among the 23 Americans
aboard, 10 non-U.S. citizen family members, officials said. Also
aboard were 15 people going to Canada. The plane was headed to
Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington.
   Looking surprisingly fit after months of surviving on canned
tuna, Howell told reporters before departing that he slept well at
an airport hotel, got a haircut and feasted on sausage, bacon and
eggs for breakfast.
   ``We have a lot of cholesterol to make up for,'' he joked, a
reference to the 110-day ordeal at the besieged U.S. Embassy in
Kuwait following Iraq's invasion of the emirate Aug. 2.
   Until Washington said he could leave Thursday, Hoell and his
four-member staff in Kuwait had defied Iraqi orders to close
foreign missions. British envoys, who had been the only other
holdouts, were also expected to leave.
   Howell and his staff left on the last U.S. charter to evacuate
Westerners who had been held by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to
deter a U.S. attack. Hundreds of Westerners have left since Saddam
announced a blanket release of hostages on Dec. 6, and U.S.
officials said all other Americans who wish to leave can take
commercial transportation.
   In Washington, Cheney told the House Armed Services Committee
that if the economic attempts and diplomatic efforts to solve the
crisis fail, the United States must have the option of using force
to oust Iraq from Kuwait.
   ``Having a capacity for patience does not mean we must remain
patient when patience is not producing results. We must always have
other options,'' Cheney said. He was responding to Democratic calls
to give economic sanctions against Iraq more time.
   Sens. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., and John McCain, R-Ariz., met with
Bush this morning and said Bush is prepared to call off U.S. talks
with Baghdad aimed at heading off war.
   The two governments have been unable to agree on a date for
Secretary of State James A. Baker III to visit Baghdad to talk to
Saddam, and for Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz to meet with Bush
in Washington. The administration wants the Aziz meeting next week
and the Baker talks by early January.
   ``The president - as I gather his mood today - is prepared to
have no meetings rather than to see a lot of shoving around ... if
we have no meetings so be it,'' Lugar told reporters.
   But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the two senators
who met with Bush went too far when they told reporters the
president was prepared to abandon efforts to set dates for the
talks.
   ``The president's concerned and he's upset that Saddam'' can't
set an acceptable date for the Baker talks, but ``the president
proposed them (the talks) and wants them to happen,'' Fitzwater
said.
   On the financial markets, meanwhile, traders said the continued
statemate of U.S.-Iraqi talks drove oil prices up in trading today.
Light sweet crude oil for January delivery was up $1.43 per barrel
at $27.85 early this afternoon on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Saddam has an estimated 500,000 troops massed in Kuwait and
southern Iraq, facing about 350,000 anti-Iraqi soldiers, including
an American force of 250,000 that should grow to 400,000 by
mid-January.
   In London, a report released today by the Medical Campaign
Against Nuclear Weapons said plans being made for gulf war
casualties will be inadequate.
   The group, citing a report last month by the Washington-based
Center for Defense Information, anticipates military and civilian
casualties of 314,000, including 63,000 dead, in a gulf conflict.
   A British Ministry of Defense spokeswoman, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said medical group was speculating wildly on numbers.
   The Medical Campaign Against Nuclear War is the British
affiliate of the International Physicians for the Prevention of
Nuclear War, which announced Thursday it was sending a peace
delegation to the gulf today. The organization represents more than
200,000 doctors.

   As promised, the Pentagon is sending a cruise
ship to the Persian Gulf to serve as a floating rest and recreation
station for desert-weary troops.
   The Defense Department on Friday said it had awarded a $31
million contract to the Cunard Line to lease the 564-foot-long
Princess for six months. The project has been in the works for some
time, and the deadline for submitting bids was two weeks ago.
   The ship is headed for Bahrain, an island emirate in the gulf
off Saudi Arabia, and will be open for R&amp;R before Christmas. It can
accommodate more than 800 people and features a swimming pool, a
health club, entertainment and full food and bar service.

   The Ulysses spacecraft is wobbling like
an off-balance washing machine, threatening to cripple the $750
million U.S.-European mission to study the sun's poles.
   Ulysses, launched from space shuttle Discovery on Oct. 6,
started gyrating on Nov. 4, The Associated Press learned.
   Officials this week confirmed the problem's existence, and said
they hope they can work around the malfunction so it doesn't
significantly harm Ulysses' five-year mission.
   The wobble will leave the spacecraft's main dish-shaped antenna
unable to point at Earth continuously.
   ``If we can't do anything about it, it's very serious,'' said
Edgar Page, Ulysses science coordinator for the European Space
Agency. The loss of data could range from 20 percent to 90 percent,
he said.
   The data is to be transmitted to Earth during 1994-1995, when
the spacecraft would be the first to orbit the sun's polar regions.
   Engineers hope to minimize the wobble during critical periods by
repeatedly firing the spacecraft's thrusters.
   ``Gloom is something I don't feel,'' said Willis Meeks, Ulysses
project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``I'm sure
that somehow during the next four years we'll find a way to learn
to live with this problem.''
   Page said that for several tense days late last month, mission
officials worried that they might permanently lose contact with the
$250 million spacecraft.
   Ulysses' trouble is yet another in a series of problems for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Others include a
flawed mirror on the Hubble Space Telescope, space shuttle fuel
leaks and a malfunctioning Astro observatory on the most recent
shuttle flight.
   The Jet Propulsion Laboratory here has successfully handled
balky spacecraft, including a stuck camera platform on one of the
Voyagers and Magellan's radio blackouts.
   Ulysses is a joint mission of the European Space Agency, which
supplied the spacecraft and half its science instruments, and NASA,
which built the remaining instruments, launched the spacecraft and
is tracking it.
   On Friday, it was 40.6 million miles from Earth, flying toward a
1992 encounter with Jupiter.
   The planet's gravity will act like a slingshot to hurl Ulysses
toward solar orbit. Ulysses is supposed to loop around the sun's
south pole during May-September 1994 and over its north pole during
May-September 1995.
   The slow wobble, technically called ``nutation,'' suddenly
developed Nov. 4 when Ulysses extended a 24{-foot-long antenna
boom. The boom, designed to study radio signals in space and waves
in the solar wind, may have become bent.
   ``It is a very big wobble. We were all amazed,'' Page told AP
Network News.
   The wobble diminished in recent days as Ulysses moved farther
from the sun and the antenna is shaded by the spacecraft, Meeks
said.
   Because of that, the leading suspected culprit is that heat from
the sun bent the boom, Meeks and Page said.
   If the theory is right, the wobble soon should disappear for a
while, but Page said it will return during the critical times when
Ulysses is studying the sun's poles.
   Ulysses doesn't need to get close to the sun, only fly past the
poles. So it never will be closer to the sun than it was on the day
it was launched.
   Engineers theorize the bent boom makes Ulysses wobble as it
spins, much like an off-centered washing machine agitator. The
spacecraft was designed to spin so it wouldn't wobble. The boom
can't be retracted.
   Page said he didn't think Ulysses' builder, Dornier Deutsche
Aerospace of Germany, was to blame. The company ``appeared to
satisfy all the test requirements we had,'' he said.

   Industrial production plunged 1.7 percent in
November, its steepest drop since the last recession, the Federal
Reserve said Friday. Many analysts expressed concern over the
quickness and severity of the slump in the manufacturing sector.
   ``All notions that the economy might skirt a recession are
dashed'' by the report, said William K. MacReynolds, an economist
with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``Clearly the economy rapidly is
falling to a degree not anticipated by most analysts just two short
months ago.''
   ``It's pretty clear that the weakness in the last couple of
months has been pretty severe,'' added economist Robert Brusca of
Nikko Securities Co. International in New York. ``If this isn't
what a recession is, I don't know what one is.''
   The Fed said the drop was the steepest since output sank 2.0
percent in December 1982 as the nation began crawling out of the
last recession.
   The decline began with a 0.1 percent tumble in September,
followed by a 0.9 percent fall in October. Both months were revised
downward - from a positive 0.2 percent in September and a negative
0.8 percent in October.
   ``The dramatic declines indicate the manufacturing sector is
suffering along with the rest of the economy as the business cycle
takes a turn for the worse,'' said economist Mark M. Zandi of
Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa.
   But Zandi and others, while acknowledging the ``bleak''
industrial production report, found some hope in Friday's Commerce
Department report that business inventories grew a modest 0.4
percent in October while sales expanded 0.9 percent.
   That resulted in an inventory-to-sales ratio of 1.47, down from
1.48 the previous month. The ratio means it would take 1.47 months
to exhaust the backlog of goods at the October sales pace. The
ratio reached a 1.74 in January 1982 during the last recession.
   ``The fact that inventories remained lean suggests that although
we're in a slowdown, there's not a lot of inventory correction
needed and that will keep the slowdown mild and of shorter
duration,'' he said.
   Evelina Tainer, an economist with First National Bank of
Chicago, said the ratio suggests ``unemployment will go up, but not
as much as in past recessions.'' Major inventory accumulations
could cause growing production cutbacks and even larger job layoffs
as businesses attempt to sell off the backlog.
   Nevertheless, the Labor Department still reported that 200,000
factory jobs were lost in November, the biggest one-month drop
since 1982. Since reaching a post-recession peak in January 1989,
manufacturing employment has declined by 800,000.
   ``A 20 percent drop in motor vehicle assemblies coupled with a
sharp curtailment in output of related parts and materials
accounted for more than half of the overall loss'' in industrial
output, the Fed said. But all categories posted declines.
   Production at manufacturing plants making both durable and
non-durable goods also plummeted 1.7 percent for its third
consecutive drop.
   Output of durable goods - usually expensive products expected to
last more than three years - sank 2.5 percent after a 1.1 percent
drop in October.
   Manufacturing of non-durable goods, which has been declining
since July, dropped 0.6 percent after 0.4 percent drops in both
September and October.
   Utility production fell 3.6 percent, its third straight decline,
while output at mines inched down 0.1 percent after a 1.0 percent
drop in October.
   The Fed said its industrial production index in November stood
at 107.5 percent of its 1987 base, down from 109.4 percent a month
earlier. It matched the level of last January, which was the lowest
since the index stood at 107.4 percent in December 1988.
   The Fed also said the operating rate of the nation's factories,
mines and utilities dropped 1.5 percentage point to 80.9 percent of
capacity. The operating rate measures not only output but also
changes in productivity levels.
   The operating rate at factories was 80.0 percent, down from 81.6
percent in October. The operating rate at mines was unchanged at
89.6 percent. For utilities, it fell to 82.7 percent from 85.9
percent a month earlier.

<HEAD>Boschwitz Appeals For Job For Formerly Homeless Worker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, who leaves office in
January, has appealed to colleagues to hire a woman who was
homeless when she went to work for him two years ago.
   ``I have an employee who can't wait,'' the Minnesota Republican
wrote his fellow senators.
   Some of Boschwitz's workers have found jobs since he lost his
re-election bid in November, but Valerie Gaines, a 36-year-old
typist, has had just two interviews without success so far. Her
husband has been disabled by two strokes and cannot work, she says.
She has two daughters, aged 6 and 8.
   ``Valerie hasn't found a new job ... and we need to place her
quickly to avoid another debilitating bout with homelessness,''
Boschwitz wrote. ``Valerie Gaines will be an asset to your
office.''
   Boschwitz called Gaines an ``excellent employee.''
   Gaines had worked for then-Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., for two
years but lost her job when he retired in 1988. During three weeks
of being out of work, her family was evicted and their belongings
were stolen.
   Boschwitz's staff hired her without knowing that the address she
had given was that of a homeless shelter. She now lives in an
apartment in suburban Maryland.
   Gaines said Friday she has had two interviews about jobs in the
Department of Agriculture but no overtures from other members of
Congress.
   ``I'm trying to keep optimistic that the someone will call soon
and say they want me to work on their staff in some capacity,'' she
said. ``It's Christmas time; we're being merry.''

they were not positive when the official announcement would be

   Others who had been mentioned as candidates for the post
included Rep. Patricia Saiki of Hawaii, another losing GOP
candidate for the Senate.
   Saiki, also speculated to be in the running for the Education
post, had been considered an underdog for the labor job, partly
because she had backed Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas over Bush in the
1988 primaries.
   Republican sources said today that Dole had called White House
Chief of Staff John Sununu, pushing Saiki for a Cabinet post.
   Besides close personal and professional ties to Bush, Martin
would give the administration a Labor Department chief with strong
congressional ties.
   However, Martin has never had a close alliance with organized
labor. Her best voting score from the AFL-CIO came in 1988, when
she got a 46 out of a possible 100 on issues tracked by the 14.2
million-member labor federation.
   When Bush tapped Mrs. Dole for the labor post two years ago, his
action was seen as a way for Republicans to mend fences with
organized labor leaders who had endured a hostile relationship with
the Reagan administration.
   A fiscal conservative who is pro-choice, Martin's 1989 voting
record received  rating of 35 out of 100 from the liberal
Americans for Democratic Action and scored 69 with the American
Conservative Union.
   She was born in Chicago and now resides in Loves Park, Ill. A
graduate of the University of Illinois, she taught high school
economics, government and English before beginning her political
career.
   As secretary of labor, Martin duties would include overseeing
the enforcement of federal job health and safety laws, pensions and
job training.

<HEAD>Tambo Urges Review of ANC Support for Sanctions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   ANC President Oliver Tambo on
Friday urged the black opposition group to review its stand on
international sanctions against South Africa, a cornerstone of the
anti-apartheid campaign.
   Tambo, who returned Thursday from 30 years of exile, told the
opening session of the African National Congress' consultative
conference that it had to revamp its strategy in step with the
evolving political situation in South Africa.
   Noting worldwide support for President F.W. de Klerk's reforms,
Tambo suggested that the ANC would be wise to develop a more
lenient policy on sanctions before foreign nations dropped them
altogether.
   ``It is no longer enough for us to repeat the tried slogans,''
Tambo said in a speech that could mark a major change in the ANC's
position.
   ``We should, therefore, carefully reevaluate the advisability of
insisting on the retention of sanctions, given the new developments
in the country and abroad.''
   Both Tambo and Nelson Mandela, the ANC deputy president, praised
changes in the white-led government that made the historic
three-day conference possible. But they said the fight against
white domination would continue.
   It was the ANC's first meeting in South Africa since the group
was outlawed 30 years ago, and it brought together scores of black
activists who spent years in prison or exile for anti-apartheid
activities.
   More than 40 black activists sat at a long table draped with the
green, black and gold colors of the ANC. Behind them, a
checkerboard of 25 television screens gave the 1,600 delegates
close-up views of their aged leaders.
   Tambo, 73, who is still suffering the effects of a stroke 16
months ago, received a standing ovation as he walked slowly to his
place at the head of the table amid chants of ``Tambo, Tambo.''
   Speaking haltingly at first, Tambo's voice gained strength
during the nearly hourlong opening address.
   In a tribute to the activists who were imprisoned or died during
the past three decades, he said: ``It is thanks to you that today
the dignity of a black person is being restored, and together with
it the dignity of our beloved country.''
   Of de Klerk's reforms, which include legalization of the ANC and
the repeal of some apartheid laws, Tambo said, ``Naturally, our
hopes are raised.''
   But he urged blacks not to let down their guard and called the
ongoing political unrest a ``painful reminder that apartheid is
firmly in place.''
   Tambo thanked foreign nations for imposing sanctions on South
Africa, but noted that pressure was building from some countries to
lift them.
   Leaders of the 12-nation European Community are expected to
discuss whether to continue sanctions at a summit that opened
Friday in Rome.
   Mandela did not specifically refer to sanctions in a 22-page
speech, but he said ``continuing pressure from the international
community...must be maintained.''
   Foreign governments have also imposed sports and cultural
boycotts against South Africa and limited diplomatic contacts.
   A draft discussion document on sanctions, which was to be
reviewed privately by ANC delegates, said the economic measures
should remain because the white minority continues to govern the
country.
   The pamphlet was marked ``confidential'' and was contained in
media packets. The independent South African Press Association said
the ANC accidentally leaked the document.
   It suggested that boycotts on sports and cultural exchanges
could be eased.
   ``It is...clear that we cannot continue to call for the
maintenance of existing measures without running the risk of
placing ourselves in a position in which we will be seen to have
suffered a major defeat'' if countries begin loosening the
sanctions, the pamphlet said.
   Mandela was far more militant than Tambo, warning that the
suspension of the ANC's armed struggle was just that, a temporary
suspension.
   ``The rallying cry of the day, to all our members wherever they
are deployed, is - remain at your posts,'' he said.
   The focus of the meeting, which ends Sunday, is to plan ANC
strategy and the group's approach to talks with the white-led
government on power sharing with the black majority.
   De Klerk has promised to end apartheid and negotiate a new
constitution to include the nation's 30 million blacks, who
currently have no voice in national affairs. The 5 million whites
control the government.

   A judge who told a woman in a
divorce case to find a new husband in a singles bar because
``bimbos'' go there was criticized by a state appeals court.
   A three-judge panel called the remarks by Broward Circuit Judge
Paul M. Marko III inappropriate and reversed his decisions. It
returned the case to the Circuit Court and suggested Marko withdraw
because he could not be fair.
   At the Nov. 27, 1989, divorce trial, Marko repeatedly told
33-year-old Marianne Price she couldn't make it on her own,
suggesting she try a singles bar to find another spouse. He also
ordered her not to have a man live in her house. And he told her
then-husband, Gordon J. Price, he could have the ``entire Dolphins
cheerleading squad running through his apartment naked.''
   Marko, 58, a divorced father of two who has been a judge since
1969, later apologized to Marianne Price and expressed his regrets
for what he called a poor choice of words.
   The judge was not available Thursday when called at his office.
   Marianne Price said the judge's remarks devastated her at the
time but was too afraid of Marko to object to his treatment of her.
   She said she was pleased with the appeals court action.
   ``It renews my faith in the judicial system,'' Ms. Price said.
   ``No useful purpose could be served by a recitation of the many
comments made by the trial judge to or concerning the wife during
the trial,'' the court said Wednesday.
   In its decision, the appeals court said Marko wrongfully
restricted Marianne Price from having a man live in her house while
saying her husband could have as many women as he wanted in his
home.
   The court also reversed Marko's refusal to order alimony for
Marianne Price, and ordered it set by a Broward judge.

   President Bush said today he would nominate
outgoing Illinois Rep. Lynn Martin as his new secretary of labor.
   Bush called Martin a ``distinguished public servant and
cherished friend'' in naming her to the post.
   Martin, 51, will succeed Elizabeth Dole, who stepped down to
head the American Red Cross.
   A 10-year House Republican, Martin has longstanding ties to
Bush. She backed him in his first presidential bid in 1980, helped
him prepare for his vice presidential debate with Democrat
Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 and was a national co-chairman of his
presidential campaign two years ago.
   Bush, speaking to reporters on the White House lawn before
leaving for a weekend trip to Camp David, said Martin had been an
``outstanding member of Congress'' who had served as an
``unofficial adviser to me.''
   ``She's a mother who knows the need for child care. She's a
professional who understands'' the relationship between business
and labor, the president said.
   ``I know that she will serve with great distinction in our
Cabinet,'' Bush said of Martin, whose nomination must be confirmed
by the Senate.
   Martin was at her home in Rockford, Ill., when Bush made the
announcement.
   Martin had been rumored to be a shoo-in for the job, because of
her gender, status as a veteran House member and because her
appointment would give Bush a chance to reward her for giving up a
safe congressional seat to run against Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill. She
lost the race by nearly 1 million votes.
   It was the first of two Cabinet openings to be filled by Bush.
Still vacant is the Education spot opened by the forced resignation
earlier this week by Lauro Cavazos.
   In addition, Bush is looking for a new Republican National
Committee chairman since Thursday's announcement by William Bennett
that he had changed his mind about taking the job.
   Others who had been mentioned as candidates for the post
included Rep. Patricia Saiki of Hawaii, another losing GOP
candidate for the Senate.
   Saiki, also speculated to be in the running for the Education
post, had been considered an underdog for the labor job, partly
because she had backed Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas over Bush in the
1988 primaries.
   Republican sources said today that Dole had called White House
Chief of Staff John Sununu, pushing Saiki for a Cabinet post.
   Besides close personal and professional ties to Bush, Martin

<TEXT>
   Troops moved into a central Albanian city
on Friday to quell rioting by a crowd of about 1,000 people who
``destroyed everything in their way,'' an Albanian journalist said.
   An editor of the official Albanian news agency ATA said the city
of Elbasan, about 18 miles southeast of the capital of Tirana, was
quiet Friday night after soldiers and security forces moved in.
   It was the second day of rioting in Albania, the tiny Balkan
nation that is ruled by the last Stalinist regime remaining in
Europe.
   Also Friday, Communist President Ramiz Alia met with leaders of
the country's first non-Communist party, which was formed on
Wednesday. Both sides appealed for calm.
   Alia, who decided this week to allow alternative parties,
appears to be trying to avoid an explosion of popular discontent
over poor living conditions and decades of Communist repression.
Popular uprisings last year toppled the other Communist governments
in Eastern Europe.
   The angry crowd in Elbasan stoned official buildings, ``broke
windows, looted food shops, put fire to different shops, cars and
machinery,'' said the ATA journalist, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``They destroyed everything in their way,'' he said, adding that
local police had failed to stop the crowd.
   The journalist said he had no reports of injuries in Elbasan, a
city of about 80,000. The city has a giant steel mill.
   On Thursday, 10 people were injured and 30 arrested in clashes
in the northern Albanian city of Shkodra, Albanian media reported.
   An intellectual in Tirana said there were peaceful protests
Thursday in the southern Albanian town of Saranda on the Adriatic
coast.
   The intellectual, who also spoke on condition of anonymity,
added that crowds in Tirana gathered outside the Palace of
Congresses on Friday evening in anticipation of the historic
meeting between the Communist president and the new Democratic
Party of Albania.
   The party was formed Wednesday and was cheered by tens of
thousands of people at a peaceful rally.
   There was no immediate report from Friday's meeting, in which
the opposition was expected to present its platform for economic
reforms and adherence to international human rights guidelines.
   On Wednesday, Alia appealed on nationwide television and radio
for peaceful change in Albania, which has been under rigid
Communist rule since 1944.
   His surprising decision this week to allow alternative political
movements may have touched off resistance among conservative
elements of the ruling Communists and the Sigurimi, the secret
police.
   Alia also fired five hard-line members of his ruling Politburo.
   Police and troops moved into Shkodra on Thursday to deal with
hundreds of ``hooligans'' who attacked officials and buildings,
wounding the local police chief and two other officers, official
reports said.
   The reports said the attackers were armed with knives and iron
bars and used dynamite in attacks on local Communist Party and
government buildings in the town. They also sacked the local radio
station. There was no assessment of the damage.
   There have been persistent reports this year, many from
neighboring Yugoslavia and Greece, of unrest in Shkodra and other
northern areas that traditionally were Roman Catholic before the
Communists took over.
   There also have been reports of unrest in southern Albania, home
to an estimated 40,000 ethnic Greeks.
   Official newspapers carried a statement Friday from the new
party condemning the Shkodra violence. It was also read on state by
one of the party's leaders, Arben Imame.
   The unprecedented statement specifically hailed Alia's decision
to introduce pluralism and condemned the acts of violence, which it
said were aimed against democracy, according to an ATA
correspondent.
   It urged Albanians to ``use the traditional wisdom'' to show
``that we are a civilized nation,'' the journalist on condition of
anonymity.
   The ruling Communists, who a month ago rejected the idea of
alternative parties, reversed themselves on Tuesday after four days
of student protests, reportedly touched off by demands for more
heat and light in their Tirana dormitories.

   For the second time in as many days,
troops reportedly moved into an Albanian city today to quell
rioting. The unrest came as Albania's hard-line Communist
government began granting some freedoms.
   An Albanian journalist said the soldiers moved into the central
city of Elbasan to stop 1,000 people who ``destroyed everything in
their way.''
   The editor of the Albanian news agency ATA said that by
nightfall soldiers had controlled the violence in Elbasan, 20 miles
southeast of the capital.
   Earlier today in the capital, Tirana, Communist President Ramiz
Alia met with leaders of Albania's first non-Communist political
party as both sides appealed for calm and a halt to unrest in
provincial cities.
   Albania's official newspapers also published a statement by the
new opposition Democratic Party of Albania today condemning civil
violence Thursday in a northern city as an obstacle to democratic
change.
   ``They broke windows, looted food shops, put fire to different
shops, cars and machinery,'' the editor said of the angry crowd in
Elbasan today.
   ``They destroyed everything in their way,'' he added, indicating
local police had failed to stop the angry crowd.
   The ATA journalist, who did not give his name, said he had no
reports of injuries in Elbasan, a city of 80,000 people with a
giant steel mill.
   The rioters were also reported to have thrown stones at official
buildings, and committed other acts of violence.
   Ten people were injured and 30 were arrested in violent clashes
in th northern Albanian city of Shkodra on Thursday, Albanian
media reported.
   An intellectual in Tirana also reported peaceful protests in the
southern Albanian town of Saranda on the Adriatic coast. Earlier,
the intellectual and an ATA correspondent said Alia was meeting
with leaders of the Democratic Party of Albania. There was no
immediate report from the meeting.
   In its published statement today, the new political party asked
Albanians to show ``that we are a civilized nation.''
   Observers were surprised the hard-line Communist government of
the isolated country was willing to give the new party access to
the official press.
   The party was only founded Wednesday after the ruling Communist
Party agreed to allow alternative parties.
   The motive for the violence today in Elbasan and Thursday in
Shkodra was not immediately clear. Although it comes as the
government is granting some concessions to pro-democracy forces, it
is not known if the people behind the unrest are anti-government
protesters.
   In Shkodra, hundreds of ``hooligans'' attacked officials and
buildings, wounding the local police chief and two other officers,
official reports said.
   The reports said the attackers were armed with knives and iron
bars and used dynamite in attacks on Communist Party and government
buildings in the town. They also ransacked the local radio station.
   Journalists reached in Tirana said at least 1,000 citizens also
took to the streets in an effort to stop the violence.
   A reporter with the state news agency ATA said 30 people were
detained.
   The Democratic Party of Albania denounced the unrest.
   The statement from the party was carried in official newspapers
today and read on government TV late Thursday by one of the party's
leaders, Arben Imame.
   The ATA journalist quoted the statement as saying the violence
was aimed at destroying what had been achieved by protesters who
forced the Communist leaders to accelerate reform. It appealed for
calm and urged Albanians to ``use the traditional wisdom,'' the
journalist said.
   The Democratic Party also welcomed Alia's ``new initiative,
opening the way to pluralism,'' said a diplomat reached in Tirana.
The party plans to run candidates in elections in February.

<HEAD>Arts Endowment Chief Says He Won't Be `Decency Czar'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Endowment for the Arts was told
Friday to comply with Congress' new ``decency standard'' by
ensuring its grant-judging panels reflect the widest possible
diversity of American cultural values.
   This procedural solution was approved by members of the National
Council on the Arts, the NEA's presidentially appointed advisory
body, who met informally at a downtown hotel to discuss the
implications of legislation Congress approved in October.
   Council members effectively rejected a stronger alternative that
would have required written or oral guidelines on decency for the
NEA panels of outside experts who review applications for federal
arts grants.
   After the vote, endowment chairman John E. Frohnmayer expressed
approval of the council's approach and said, ``I'm not going to be
the decency czar here.''
   When it approved a $174 million budget for the arts endowment
this year, Congress repealed a year-old obscenity ban and
substituted a requirement that the NEA take ``general standards of
decency'' into account when awarding federal grant money.
   Both restrictions were prompted by conservative lawmakers'
criticism of NEA support for exhibitions of controversial works by
photographer Robert Mapplethorpe and artist Andres Serrano that
were denounced as obscene and blasphemous.
   Though milder than the obscenity ban, the new decency standard
has stirred emotional fire from some artists and arts supporters,
who contend that it also would hamper freedom of expression.
   In a statement read at Friday's council meeting, members of the
NEA panel on opera and musical theater declared their unanimous
opposition to the decency standard and said they would disregard
it.
   ``Standards of decency are subjective, indefinable and
irrelevant to the consideration of artistic excellence, which is
the primary concern of this panel and the National Endowment for
the Arts,'' said their signed statement.
   ``We have vehemently opposed and avoided any consideration of
`decency' as a funding criteria during our deliberations,'' the
panelists wrote.
   NEA general counsel Julie Davis told council members that
decency was ``a very slippery, very broad and very vague standard''
that almost defies definition.
   She recommended that the NEA comply with the new standard by
broadening the membership of its grant-judging panels, giving oral
instructions to panelists or writing the standard into the
endowment's formal guidelines.
   On a unanimous voice vote, council members approved the NEA
lawyer's first option, under which panelists would be appointed to
represent a broad range of ethnic, racial and geographic
backgrounds and diverse cultural viewpoints.
   Such an all-inclusive membership, Ms. Davis said, would provide
the best assurance that ``general standards of decency'' would be
considered in selecting works of artistic excellence for federal
support.
   Rep. Paul Henry, R-Mich., a leading House advocate of the
decency standard, said in a telephone interview from Grand Rapids
that he was satisfied with the arts council's approach.
   ``I have no objection to that whatsoever, so long as general
standards of decency are honored,'' he said.
   Henry said the decency standard was inserted into the law
because Congress wanted the arts endowment - not legislators - to
be the judges of which works are suitable for support with federal
funds.
   The two-day council meeting, which began Friday, was attended by
a dozen of the council's 26 members. Their recommendations will be
referred to the full council for action at its next quarterly
meeting in February.

   Fixed-rate mortgages averaged 9.56 percent
this week, the lowest level in more than three years, according to
a national survey released Friday by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp.
   The average, down from 9.81 percent the previous week, was the
lowest since it fell to 9.43 percent during the week ending April
10, 1987. By Oct. 16, however, the average had jumped to 11.58

   On one-year adjustable rate mortgages, lenders were asking an
average initial rate of 7.91 percent, the lowest since it hit 7.90

   A docked U.S. tuna ship exploded and
sank Friday near the Pacific Ocean entrance to the Panama Canal. At
least four people died, an official said, and hundreds of dockside
residents were evacuated.
   Port officials were investigating the cause of the explosion,
which broke out in the engine room of the 400-foot-long ship, the
Odette Theres.
   Jaime Beitiav, spokesman for the port authority, said two
Americans were among those killed.
   He identified those killed as Lionel Correia, 37, and Richard
Balelo, 51, of the United States, Chun Suk Kwon, 47, of South
Korea, and the Panamanian watchman, Delfino Felipe Romero. He gave
no hometowns for the U.S. citizens.
   The tuna ship was carrying a crew of 20, under American captain
Anthony Virisimo, he said.
   The incident did not affect traffic in the canal, but
firefighters were forced to evacuate hundreds of U.S. citizens who
live near the dock called La Boca, which is near an oil storage
area.
   The ship was taking on supplies for a return to the Pacific for
fishing.

   James A. Hagen, chairman and chief executive
officer of Conrail, said on Friday he cannot rule out employee
layoffs next year if freight revenue is cut by the expected
economic downturn.
   Hagen said he was not actually predicting layoffs in Conrail's
labor force of 28,000.
   ``But when you look at that economic situation you'd be foolish
to say no, no layoffs,'' he said.
   ``We're not looking for a strong 1991,'' Hagen told the
Transportation Table, a biweekly meeting of professionals with an
interest in the transportation industry.
   He said he believes the year will see a downturn in housing
starts and the auto and steel industry, all of which would
translate to less railroad freight.
   The Gross National Product (GNP) probably will be off by about
one percent next year, he said.
   Facing a decline in revenue, Conrail will attempt to reduce
costs without effecting the quality of its freight service, he
said.
   ``It's not going to be a good economic year,'' Hagen said. ``But
we'll probably do OK.''

<HEAD>TV Industry Lobbies FCC for Right to Control Prime Time Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A who's who of Hollywood and network TV
executives descended upon the Federal Communications Commission on
Friday to do battle over ownership and syndication rights to
prime-time programs.
   More than 30 witnesses, including the heads of ABC, NBC, CBS,
Fox Broadcasting and top-level studio executives, rubbed elbows in
a rare public hearing before the five-member FCC to debate changing
the commission's financial interest and syndication rule.
   Commission Chairman Alfred Sikes, ringed by a half-dozen TV
cameras, said it was the largest-ever Washington gathering of TV
executives.
   The rule, adopted in 1970, prohibits TV networks from holding a
financial interest in prime-time programs they obtain from outside
sources or selling them in the U.S. rerun marketplace.
   The networks want out from under fin-syn, as it's known, and
since 1983 have been locked in acrimonious negotiations with
producers over changing the rule. Commissioner James Quello said
fin-syn has generated the most intense lobbying of his 16 years at
the FCC.
   Fox Inc. Chairman Barry Diller, whose network has a one-year
exemption to fin-syn, said the issue no longer was producer access
to mass audiences but ``a battle about money - about greed.''
   The FCC tentatively decided in 1983 to revamp the rule but
backed off under pressure from Congress and then-President Reagan.
The commission will decide the issue next year.
   Thursday, one witness after another told the commissioners why
the rule was - or was not - vital to both the TV industry and the
American viewing public.
   ABC, NBC and CBS claim the rule is outdated in an era in which
they no longer are the only outlets for programs and when they must
compete against foreign companies that are not bound by fin-syn.
   Network executives complained that advertising sales were down
and their audiences were at historic lows because of cable TV, VCRs
and other competitors.
   ``The existing regulatory structure, created both by the
commission and by the Congress, provides an enormous advantage to
the Hollywood and cable interests,'' Laurence Tisch, president of
CBS Inc., told the hearing. ``The future of free broadcasting in
America is seriously threatened, not just for the networks, but for
our 600 affiliated stations. ... Repealing these rules is important
because it will allow us to compete for the best programming.''
   Producers, however, claimed that while the industry has changed
dramatically since fin-syn was imposed 20 years ago, the three
networks still have bottleneck control of major, high-quality
programming. Without fin-syn, they said, the networks could once
again extract many concessions from producers in return for putting
a program on the air.
   ``Perhaps whereas they were once 900-pound gorillas, today they
weigh in at only 850 pounds,'' said Richard Frank, president of
Walt Disney Studios.
   But John Agoglia, president of NBC Enterprises, and Robert Iger,
president of ABC Entertainment, said it was the producers, not
networks, that have the most bargaining power and that the networks
needed to foster as many program suppliers as possible.
   ``No network executive has the leverage to force a producer,
with or without a studio, to enter into a transaction,'' Iger said.
   ``Over 70 percent of our series come from major studios,'' said
Jeff Sagansky, president of CBS Entertainment. He said CBS would
lose ``tens of millions of dollars'' this year on ``Dallas''
because its producers threatened to go to Fox unless CBS accepted
the aging series along with ``Knot's Landing'' and ``Falcon
Crest.''
   The fin-syn rule was designed to stem network power, encourage
independent production of TV shows and keep the networks from
denying reruns to non-network TV stations. Since 1970, the
network's share of audiences has dropped from about 95 percent to
less than 60 percent as cable viewing has grown.
   ``The advertising marketplace is the worst it's been in two
decades,'' said Robert Wright, president of NBC. ``The three
network percentage of prime time viewing'' fell to 58 percent in
November, a historic low.
   The Justice Department has sided with the networks, but a wide
array of groups are on the other side.
   ``The rule has fueled the growth of independent stations and -
contrary to network contentions - has also promoted a substantial
increase in the number of program producers,'' Warner Bros.
Chairman Robert Daly said. ``The networks' want repeal so that they
may use their tremendous leverage to take valuable financial
interests and syndication rights.''
   Producers say they could accepted limited network ownership of
their programs, but that syndication and other rights must be
negotiated separately, after a show is placed on the network
schedule.

   President Bush said today direct talks with
Iraq to resolve the Persian Gulf crisis are ``on hold'' pending an
agreement with Saddam Hussein on a date for Secretary of State
James A. Baker's trip to Baghdad.
   The foreign minister of Iraq, Tariq Aziz, had been expected in
Washington next week for the first round of talks but Bush said
Saddam's proposal of Jan. 12 for a return visit from Baker was too
close to the U.N. deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
   ``We have offered 15 dates and he ought to get moving'' and
accept one, Bush said of Saddam. He added, ``Saddam Hussein is not
too busy to see on short notice'' such figures as Muhammad Ali,
Ramsey Clark and former British Prime Minister Edward Heath.
   Bush said Jan. 12 wouldn't leave time for Iraqi forces to leave
Kuwait by the United Nations deadline three days later.
   ``That deadline is real,'' Bush said, adding that Iraqi forces
must be ``totally out, totally out'' by then.
   On the financial markets, meanwhile, traders said the continued
statemate of U.S.-Iraqi talks drove oil prices up in trading today.
Light sweet crude oil for January delivery was up $1.43 per barrel
at $27.85 early this afternoon on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Meanwhile, Pentagon officials said thousands more medical
personnel were being dispatched to join the U.S. deployment in
Saudi Arabia.
   Bush made his comments on the White House lawn before boarding a
helicopter for a weekend trip to the presidential retreat at Camp
David. He said he has been considering seeking congressional
support for offensive military action in the Persian Gulf if Iraq
doesn't withdraw from Kuwait by the Jan. 15 deadline.
   ``I think it would send a very strong signal to the world'' if
Congress explicity endorsed his Persian Gulf policy, he said.
   Democratic critics have complained that Bush was abandoning
reliance on economic sanctions too early for them to have taken
effect.
   Bush has said the sole purpose of Baker's talks is not to
negotiate a settlement, but to issue a face-to-face demand that
Saddam withdraw his troops.
   Since Bush called for the talks, Saddam has permitted the
release of hundreds of United State and other westerners held in
Kuwait and Iraq since the crisis began on Aug. 2, and Bush withdrew
the small diplomatic team that had been holed up in the besieged US
embassy in Kuwait.
   Interest was now turning to the diplomatic front, but Bush said
Aziz' planned visit to the United States to see Bush ``is on hold,
I guess,'' pending an agreement on the date Baker will see Saddam.
   Bush originally invited Saddam to receive Baker in Iraq any time
between Dec. 15 and Jan. 15. ``I wish now I had been a little more
explicit in my first announcement,'' he said.
   ``I did not offer to be a part to Saddam Hussein's
manipulation,'' Bush said, adding that ``The Aziz meeting is on
hold, I guess,'' pending agreement on a date for Baker's trip.
   Earlier today, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater addressed
the subject of the stalemate.
   ``The president's concerned and he's upset that Saddam can find
time to meet with everybody else under the sun with 24 hours notice
but somehow he can't find one out of 15 days,'' to meet with Baker,
he said.
   Bush met earlier in the day with lawmakers to discuss the
Persian Gulf, and two senators emerged to say the president was
prepared to call off the talks with Iraq because the two countries
have been unable to agree on meeting dates.
   ``The president - as I gather his mood today - is prepared to
have no meetings rather than to see a lot of shoving around ... if
we have no meetings so be it,'' Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said.
   Lugar is a member of the Committee for Peace and Security in the
Gulf, a bipartisan group formed to support the president's gulf
policy that met with Bush this morning.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., another member of the group, told
reporters: ``The president feels he has taken the necessary steps
that encourages dialogue, and if they fail to respond in a
reasonable and mature fashion, then he's made his best effort and
that's it.''
   Bush was intent that the purpose of the meetings was that Saddam
understand the strength and conviction of the international
coalition arrayed against him since his Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait,
said Lugar.
   ``If he understands that already, by watching television, I
think the president is prepared to let it go at that,'' said Lugar.
   Bush is ``tired of hearing'' people's assumptions that there was
some other agenda or negotiating intent to his proposal for talks
with Iraq.
   ``If we're not going to have any meetings, it would clear that
up for good,'' Lugar said.
   Joseph Wilson IV, the deputy U.S. ambassador to Iraq, has talked
daily to foreign ministry officials in Baghdad about setting a date
for Baker's visit to Baghdad. But Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State
Department spokeswoman, said Thursday the Iraqis had not offered an
alternative to Jan. 12.
   Wilson met again Thursday with Deputy Foreign Minister Nizar
Hamdoon ``and there is no substantive change in their position,'' a
U.S. official, who demanded anonymity, said.

   A former top aide to savings and loan owner
Charles H. Keating Jr. testified today that Sen. Donald Riegle
arranged a meeting between senators and the top federal thrift
regulator to discuss Keating's concerns. Riegle has denied setting
up the meeting.
   James Grogan, once corporate counsel to Keating's parent
company, told the Senate Ethics Committee that Riegle suggested the
meeting when he visited the Arizona facilities of Keating's
American Continental Corp., and met privately with Keating.
   Grogan testified under a grant of immunity from prosecution.
   The meeting, on April 2, 1987, was held by four senators with
then-top regulator Edwin J. Gray. Gray has charged that the
senators improperly pressured him in that session to drop a
regulatory control of Lincoln Savings and Loan that Keating was
protesting.
   Riegle did not attend that meeting, and Grogan said he was
surprised by the senator's absence. Riegle did attend a meeting
with the other four senators and San Francisco-based regulators a
week later. Grogan said he urged Riegle to attend the second
meeting and wanted ``to keep the team together,'' referring to the
senators.
   Grogan also testified that Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., agreed
to call Gray's successor, M. Danny Wall, to arrange a meeting
between the regulator and Keating in late 1987. Grogan said Keating
made the request to Keating after Grogan delivered $250,000 in
checks for a voter-registration drive Cranston was supporting, and
together they placed a call by speaker phone to Keating in Arizona.
   Grogan said Riegle had suggested that the two Arizona senators,
Democrat Dennis DeConcini and Republican John McCain, attend the
session with Gray on April 2. He said Riegle asked that the other
senators then invite him to attend.
   Committee special counsel Robert S. Bennett asked Grogan, ``Is
there any doubt in your mind Senator Riegle agreed to arrange the
meeting for the senators?''
   Grogan replied, ``No, sir.''
   Grogan recalled that Riegle said ``he would talk with Ed Gray
and he thought he could set up a meeting ... and perhaps set up a
process of disengaging from the feud or fighting that was going
on'' between Keating and the regulators.
   Riegle, in earlier testimony before the committee in its Keating
Five hearings, denied setting up that meeting or one a week later
with all five senators, including himself, and regulators.
   ``No, I didn't arrange either meeting,'' Riegle has testified.
   Grogan said that while Riegle and Keating met privately, he met
with Kevin Gotlieb, Riegle's staffer on the Senate Banking
Committee, and discussed a fundraiser Keating was organizing for
Riegle in Detroit. Keating owned a prominent downtown hotel there.
   Bennett asked Grogan, ``Did Senator Riegle ever tell you why he
wanted you to ask Senator McCain to ask Senator Riegle to come to
the meeting?''
   Grogan replied, ``It was apparent to me that ... Senator Riegle
knew as a shrewd politician that this was a potentially politically
explosive situation because there was tremendous media at the time
about Mr. Keating and Mr. Gray and the regulators and all the
fighting.''
   Grogan said that when he asked McCain, he refused to invite
Riegle but did agree ``to at least talk to Riegle about it.''
   The panel granted Grogan limited immunity from prosecution to
compel his testimony about Keating's ties to five senators who have
been accused of intervening improperly with federal thrift
regulators on behalf of Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association.
   Grogan, 36, of Scottsdale, Ariz., gave his first public
testimony with his lawyer sitting behind him. None of the five
senators under scrutiny was present.
   Grogan said he had earned $300,000 a year working for Keating's
company, before resigning last June. He described his relations
with Keating as ``strained.''
   Keating had extensive contacts with the senators and their
staffs. He was a big contributor to each lawmaker, and the
committee is considering whether the $1.3 million he and associates
donated to their campaigns and related political causes was tied to
their assistance.
   Keating's parent company, American Continental Co., went
bankrupt in April 1989, and Lincoln was seized by federal
regulators. The cost to taxpayers to cover insured deposits is
expected to top $2 billion, and Keating is under a state fraud
indictment in California.
   Grogan was vice president of Lincoln, based in Irvine, Calif.,
and corporate counsel to American Continental, based in Phoenix.
   The five senators are Republican John McCain of Arizona and
Democrats Alan Cranston of California, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona,
John Glenn of Ohio and Donald Riegle of Michigan.
   Keating, Grogan and other aides invoked their Fifth Amendment
rights against self-incrimination in refusing to testify. In
granting Grogan immunity to compel his testimony, the committee
said it would not do so for Keating.
   Evidence in the previous four weeks of public hearings has shown
that Grogan arranged for political donations to lawmakers and was
point man in soliciting congressional help for Keating's ``all-out
war'' with regulators who were closing in on Lincoln.
   A memo introduced into evidence last week showed that Keating
directed Grogan to try to have a senior career regulator fired for
his tough actions against Lincoln.

   Here is a chronology of major events in the Nancy Cruzan
right-to-die case:
   -Jan. 11, 1983: Nancy Cruzan, then 25, has a wreck on a country
road southeast of Carthage, in the Ozarks of southwest Missouri and
is thrown from the car. Paramedics restart her breathing, but her
brain was without oxygen for so long she never regains
consciousness.
   -Feb. 5, 1983: Doctors implant a feeding tube in Ms. Cruzan's
stomach. She isn't on any life support system, such as a
respirator.
   -Oct. 19, 1983: Ms. Cruzan is moved to the Missouri
Rehabilitation Center in Mount Vernon, where she remains.
   -Oct. 23, 1987: Her parents, Joe and Joyce Cruzan of Carterville
ask Jasper County Probate Judge Charles Teel for a judgment on
their request that they be allowed to have Ms. Cruzan's feeding
tube removed, so she can die as they believe she would want.
   -March 9, 1988: A three-day hearing begins on the family's
request. The Cruzans say their daughter has a common-law right to
be free from unwanted medical treatment, and state and federal
constitutional rights to privacy that protect her right to refuse
unwanted medical treatment.
   -July 27, 1988: Teel issues a judgment authorizing the Cruzans,
acting as Nancy's legal guardians, to request the withholding of
food and water from their daughter.
   -Aug. 3, 1988: Missouri Attorney General William Webster files
notice that the state will appeal to the state Supreme Court.
   -Sept. 29, 1988: The court hears arguments.
   -Nov. 16, 1988: In a 4-3 decision, the state Supreme Court
overturns the lower court, holding there is no legal authority to
grant the Cruzans' request. The family appeals to the U.S. Supreme
Court.
   -Dec. 6, 1989: The U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments, the first
time it has considered a right-to-die case.
   -June 25, 1990: In a 5-4 decision, the court blocks the Cruzans
from halting their daughter's food and water. It says the state
could keep a patient on life support in the absence of ``clear and
convincing'' evidence the person would want to die.
   -Aug. 30, 1990: Ms. Cruzan's parents ask Teel for a second
hearing, saying they have new evidence their daughter once
indicated to three people she would rather die than live in her
present condition.
   -Sept. 17, 1990: Webster, saying the state no longer has a
``recognizable legal interest'' in the case, asks the judge to drop
the state Health Department and the director of the Missouri
Rehabilitation Center from future litigation.
   -Oct. 23, 1990: Teel drops the state as a defendant, leaving the
parents and court-appointed guardian Thad McCanse in the case.
   -Nov. 1, 1990: Three former co-workers tell Teel they recalled
conversations with Ms. Cruzan in which she said she never would
want to live ``like a vegetable'' on medical machines. Ms. Cruzan's
physician, who previously opposed removing the feeding tube, terms
her life ``a living hell'' and testifies she should be allowed to
die.
   -Dec. 5, 1990: Ms. Cruzan's court-appointed guardians recommend
the feeding tube be removed so Ms. Cruzan may die.
   -Dec. 14, 1990: Teel authorizes removal of feeding tubes.

<TEXT>
   Union workers overwhelming approved a
new contract Friday with Delta Pride Catfish Inc., ending a bitter
three-month strike that brought out allegations of racial
discrimination.
   The plight of the workers in one of the nation's most
economically depressed regions attracted support from the NAACP and
other civil rights organizations and led to a national boycott of
Delta Pride products.
   The contract vote was 479-1. Union officials said the lone vote
against appeared to be a misunderstanding over wage provisions in
the pact.
   ``This is a great Christmas present,'' said Sarah White, a shop
steward who has been with Delta Pride since 1983, one year after
the nation's largest catfish processor opened. ``I feel good about
this contract and I've talked with several co-workers and they are
satisfied.
   ``We finally got some of the things we wanted ... including
things that should make the workplace better for all of us.''
   The strike began Sept. 13 when members of United Food and
Commercial Workers Union Local 1529 rejected a contract. About 900
workers walked off the job at Delta Pride's Indianola and Inverness
plants. A third plant in Belzoni employs non-union workers.
   The company had no immediate comment on the contract vote.
   Provisions in the contract include wage increases and assurances
that striking workers will be rehired, union officials said.
   The contract grants immediate raises of 60 to 65 cents an hour
for all workers with at least one year of seniority. Pay averaged
$4.05 an hour before the strike. The pact also establishes a
worker-management health and safety committee to monitor conditions
at the plant.
   While there were scattered reports of violence, including
rock-throwing, early in the strike, officials said recent weeks
were quiet.
   Aaron Henry, president of the Mississippi NAACP, said the
worker's anger arose from ``a combination of race and economics
coupled with the philosophy of the plantation.''
   Besides wages, the union also raised concerns about working
conditions. A common complaint among workers has been about
repetitive motion injury.
   Workers complained that they were timed with a stopwatch when
skinning, gutting, slicing and packaging fish. The also complained
of limited restroom breaks - six five-minute bathroom breaks per
week. Violators risked dismissal.
   White, who has two children, said the three months she has been
on strike created financial problems but ``the union helped take
care of our bills and provided groceries for us. We really
sacrificed but we had help with the basics.''
   White, 32, of Moorhead, said she planned to be in St. Louis this
weekend to attend a support rally for the striking workers.
   ``Now I can tell them it is over and tell them to start buying
catfish ... we need the hours at work,'' she said.
   E. Dale Cline of Memphis, Tenn., the federal mediator who helped
work out the new contract, said he is ``tickled to death that this
is finally over.''
   Union spokesman Neel Lattimore said the contract goes a long way
toward improving working conditions.
   ``We feel like there is language in the contract to make Delta
Pride more sensitive (to working conditions) and by all of us
working together we can get along,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Germany said Friday it will summon the
Soviet ambassador to explain why Moscow has not handed over ousted
East German Communist leader Erich Honecker for trial.
   Berlin state justice authorities issued an arrest warrant on
Nov. 30 for Honecker, accusing him of signing shoot-to-kill orders
that resulted in the deaths of would-be escapees from East Germany.
   On Thursday, they asked for Bonn's help in persuading the Soviet
Union to turn him over, federal government spokesman Dieter Vogel
said Friday.
   The Soviets say they have admitted Honecker to a Soviet military
hospital in Beelitz, outside Berlin, for humanitarian reasons.
Honecker's lawyers claim he is seriously ill and under treatment
for high blood pressure.
   The Soviets' sheltering of Honecker, 78, who was toppled in
1989's peaceful revolution in East Germany, is complicating Bonn's
relations with Moscow. In recent months the two governments have
drawn closer together through Moscow's blessing of German unity and
German promises of huge financial aid for the Soviets.
   Vogel said that ``in a short time'' the Foreign Ministry will
invite the Soviet ambassador in Bonn for talks abot Honecker.
   Under German law, the prosecution of Honecker is not a federal
matter but one for justice officials in Berlin, whose eastern half
was East Germany's seat of government.
   On Thursday, sources said Bonn may try to persuade Soviet
authorities to let a German doctor into the Soviet military
hospital to examine Honecker and determine whether he is fit to
stand trial.
   Also Friday, the Berlin state court said it has rejected a
challenge of the arrest warrant by Honecker's lawyers. The lawyers
argued that Honecker could not be penalized for following the law
of former East Germany.
   The court did not say on what grounds it had dismissed the
appeal. Under German law, former East Germans can be prosecuted for
crimes committed in eastern Germany before unification in October.
   The defense lawyers said they would take the matter to Germany's
Supreme Court.
   About 200 East Germans were gunned down while trying to escape
to the West in the years following the 1961 construction of the
Berlin Wall.
   Honecker came to power in 1971.

   Mourners remembered human rights activist Andrei
D. Sakharov on Friday, a year after his death, as an extraordinary
moral force whose place in politics and in their hearts has yet to
be matched by anyone else.
   ``I can't see anybody now whose ideas I could agree with. He was
a man whose thoughts could find a response in people's souls,''
said Bela Kleshchenko, an activist standing beside Sakharov's grave
at a snowy cemetery in southwest Moscow.
   ``I can't see anybody today who could take his place,'' said
67-year-old pensioner Baruch Froyimovich, teary-eyed as he looked
at the grave. ``You need a man who has very high culture - heart,
soul and brains. He was man of the highest culture.''
   Sakharov was a top Soviet physicist who helped develop the
hydrogen bomb in the 1950s and later won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize
for his campaigns on behalf of disarmament and human rights.
   He died a year ago at age 68 after three vigorous years of
political activism following his emergence from forced internal
exile.
   Controversial for much of his political life, Sakharov has
gained steadily in public esteem since his death. Groups scramble
to attach his name to their cause, and his words are quoted by
politicians and commentators alike as the country deals with
worsening political and economic crises.
   In 1980, Sakharov was denounced in the official press as an
``utterly ignorant person'' and exiled to the closed city of Gorky
for criticizing the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev released him in December 1986,
and he returned to Moscow, where he became an outspoken deputy in
the Supreme Soviet parliament.
   Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin opened Friday's
session of the Russian parliament with a tribute to Sakharov, and
national newspapers published articles praising him.
   The government plans to make a museum out of his old apartment
in Gorky, which has since been renamed Nizhni-Novgorod.
   But at the cemetery, Ms. Kleshchenko said politicians were
cashing in on Sakharov's name without fulfilling his ideals.
   ``The powers that be ... brought about his death, and now they
are preparing to establish a museum in his honor,'' said Ms.
Kleshchenko, a member of the Sakharov Order of Charity and Social
Defense.
   ``Our politicians are too busy with politics and they don't
really have any human qualities,'' she said. ``What was so special
about Sakharov was that he was a scholar, a politician and a man -
he was still human.''
   At the huge cemetery, the rumble of trucks on a nearby highway
was barely audible next to Sakharov's grave, which was covered by a
blanket of evergreen twigs and carnations of all colors.
   A black-and-white portrait of the physicist hung from the
headstone, flanked by evergreen wreaths that bore sashes from the
Russian parliament and democratic activists. A half-dozen candles
flickered in the sub-freezing breeze in front of the grave.
   Pairs of policemen stood at each corner of a path leading to the
gravesite, apparently on guard in case of any demonstrations. But
the mood was solemn, and people spoke softly or not at all.
   At the parliament, Sergei Kovalev, a deputy and close friend,
said, ``Sakharov was intrepid and unselfish in the quest of truth.
He was always outside the turmoil of political passions and
ambitions. He took interest in nothing but the truth.''
   The Moscow newspaper Leninskoye Znamiya said, ``History has
already had its say on Sakharov. He belongs to it. At the same
time, he is near us, he stayed in the hearts of all who wanted to
have him.''

   Here is a text of President Bush's
question-and-answer session on the White House lawn Friday:
   Bush: I have two brief statements that I'd like to make this
afternoon. And first, I have today asked a distinguished public
servant and a cherished friend to become secretary of the
Department of Labor. Lynn Martin, a former congresswoman from
Illinois, has agreed to assume the direction of this very important
Cabinet office.
   She and I have known each other for many years. She was an
outstanding member of Congress and an unofficial adviser to me. She
has shared with me her wisdom on any number of legislative issues
and I am delighted to have her working at my side on labor matters
as we enter the decade of the '90s.
   She's a mother who knows the need for child care. She's a
professional who understands the business-labor relationship. And,
as a congresswoman, she spent years dealing with the concerns and
aspirations of the working Americans from every walk of life. And I
know that she will serve with great distinction in our Cabinet.
   Lynn was in Illinois this afternoon when I called her. And she
will be in Washington on Monday, and I look forward to meeting her
here in the White House to talk about the direction of the
Department of Labor.
   And now I'd like to take up another subject, a second one. On
Nov. 30, in offering direct meetings between the United States and
Iraq, I offered to go the extra mile for a peaceful solution to the
gulf question. And I wanted to make clear to Saddam Hussein the
absolute determination of the coalition that he comply fully with
the Security Council resolutions.
   Iraqi aggression cannot be rewarded. And so I have asked the
secretary of sate to be available to go to Baghdad any time up to
and including Jan. 3, which is over five months after the invasion
of Kuwait and only 12 days before the United Nations deadline for
withdrawal.
   That deadline is real. To show flexibility, I have offered any
one of 15 dates for Secretary Baker to go to Baghdad, and the
Iraqis have offered only one date. In offering to go the extra mile
for peace, however, I did not offer to be a party to Saddam
Hussein's manipulation. Saddam Hussein is not too busy to see, on
short notice, Kurt Waldheim, Willy Brandt, Muhammad Ali, Ted Heath,
John Connally, Ramsey Clark, and many, many others on very short
notice.
   And it simply is not credible that he cannot, over a two-week
period, make a couple of hours available for the secretary of state
on an issue of this importance, unless, of course, he is seeking to
circumvent the United Nations deadline.
   Look, I want a peaceful solution to this crisis. But I will not
be a party to circumventing or diluting the United Nations
deadline, which I think offers the very best chance for a peaceful
solution. And so I wanted to get out my feeling about these
proposed meetings.
   Q. Mr. President, what's wrong with the Jan. 12 date that he
set? Why would that dilute it, unless you're afraid that he might
come up with some offer?
   A. Well, in the first place, the United Nations resolutions that
pertain say that he has to be out of Kuwait. I wish now that I had
been a little more explicit in my first announcement on what I
meant by ``mutually convenient dates.'' But I was not then, but now
- and am not now prepared to have this man manipulate the purpose
of the secretary of state's visit.
   So we will - we have made an offer of many, many dates, but
remember, the United Nations resolution calls for total withdrawal
by this date.
   Q. And does your statement today indicate that you would not
accept Jan. 5 or 6?
   A. We've offered 15 days, and he ought to get moving and do
something reasonable, if he really wants to move for peace.
   Q. Mr. President, is there a date at which you would withdraw
the offer to meet. The senators this morning say you're willing to
forgo talks now?
   A. Well, we're not going to do them on terms that are - would
appear to the world to be an effort to circumvent the United
Nations resolution. I mean, he's got a massive force there, and
that force has to be out on the 15th of January under the United
Nations resolutions. So we'll see how it goes.
   I would say that we've given so many alternatives here that he
ought to stay with - accept one of these. If he's serious. Now, if
it's simply that he is trying to manipulate, that is what I will
have no part of.
   Q. Is there a deadline for him to accept your offer?
   A. No, we're not putting down deadlines on it. The Aziz meeting
is on hold, I guess. I mean, I say ``I guess'' because we've made
clear to them that it's kind of a home-and-home arrangement here.
   Q. You've said the deadline is real, so that means you think you
have carte blanche to start a war after Jan. 15 or on Jan. 15?
   A. I'm saying that the United Nations resolution is very clear
as it regards Jan. 15, and I will continue now to work for a
peaceful solution.

<HEAD>Swiss Playwright Is Dead of Heart Failure </HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEUCHATEL, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Friedrich Duerrenmatt, the Swiss
writer whose plays display a sardonic mix of realism and absurd
visions, died Friday of heart failure. He was 69.
   The author of ``The Visit'' and ``The Physicists'' died at his
home in the lakeside town of Neuchatel in western Switzerland, the
Diogenes Publishing House announced. It was three weeks before his
70th birthday.
   Duerrenmatt's collected works comprise more than 30 volumes and
have been translated from the German into over 50 languages. He is
believed to have been the most widely played contemporary dramatist
since Bertolt Brecht.
   Besides plays, Duerrenmatt also wrote novels, essays and his
convoluted ``Stoffe,'' or ``Materials,'' which blend fiction with
autobiographical notes. His worldwide reputation was established by
``The Visit,'' which premiered in 1955. In the play, an entire town
slowly yields to the temptation of murdering one of its citizens
for the sake of a promised fortune.
   In another popular play, ``The Physicists,'' first performed in
1961, the main characters escape nuclear age realities in a
madhouse.
   His novels included ``Justice,'' which has a complicated murder
plot. His paintings also won considerable attention at several
exhibitions.
   Duerrenmatt's last play was titled ``Achterloo'', a farcical
theater-of-the-absurd parable inspired by the martial law clampdown
on Poland's Solidarity movement. It premiered in 1983.
   He said the play tried to show that ``the modern world is
changing into a theater...The consequences will be disastrous.''
   The son of a Protestant pastor, Duerrenmatt was born Jan. 5,
1921 at Konolfingen, a town near the Swiss capital of Bern.
Originally, he wanted to become a painter and also studied
theology, philosophy, literature and natural sciences.
   His first success as writer came in 1949 with ``Romulus the
Great,'' which he called an ``unhistorical historical comedy''
about the fall of the Roman Empire.
   Gloom mingled typically with impish irony and jocular paradoxes
in Duerrenmatt's parable-type plays which he preferred to call
comedies despite their tragic quality.
   Tragedy, he once observed, could no longer be written because
the modern world, lacking established standards of guilt and
retribution, was not suited for it.
   The world, he said, stands as ``an enigma of calamity that has
to be accepted but to which there must be no surrender.''
   Several plays were turned into movies, including ''The Visit''
starring Ingrid Bergman and Anthony Quinn.
   Deurrenmatt suffered from a heart condition for more than 20
years and was a diabetic. Funeral arrangements were not immediately
known.
   He is survived by his second wife, Charlotte, a German TV
director and writer, whom he married in 1984. His first wife,
Lotti, and mother of his three children, Peter, Barbara and Ruth,
died in early 1983.

<HEAD>Waiter Wins Settlement in Claim of Heart Disease From Second-Hand
Smoke</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A non-smoking waiter has received a settlement ina workers'
compensation case in which he claimed his heart attack was caused
by exposure to other people's cigarette smoke, his attorney said
Friday.
   ``They've admitted that our claim is substantial enough that if
they went to trial they'd probably lose,'' said the attorney,
Charles Crane.
   In the settlement, the California Compensation Insurance Fund
agreed to take care of the 54-year-old waiter's medical bills,
which amount to about $85,000.
   Stanton Glantz, a researcher who testified in the case as an
authority on passive smoking, said he believed it was the first
time a workers' compensation decision was based on passive
smoking-induced heart disease.
   ``And this was successful,'' said Glantz, of the University of
California, San Francisco.
   He is co-author of a study that shows that second-hand cigarette
smoke causes 32,000 heart disease deaths per year in the United
States.
   The settlement of the case could have important ramifications
for employers, Crane said.
   ``Basically what this says is that employers who have to pay for
workers' compensation insurance better make sure their employees
are not breathing in stuff they shouldn't be breathing in,'' Crane
said.
   Jo-Linda Thompson, general counsel with the California
Restaurant Association, said she had not yet reviewed the case so
she did not know how it might affect restaurant owners.
   ``Maybe this is a very special case,'' she said. ``Maybe it's
not.''
   Michael Mowrey, the attorney who represented the State
Compensation Insurance Fund, did not return two phone calls to his
office.
   The waiter, Avtar Uhbi, did not smoke, had no family history of
heart disease, ate a mostly vegetarian diet and otherwise had
little risk or heart disease, Crane said.
   Yet he suffered a heart attack on March 14, 1989, which led to
complications and 15 days in the hospital.
   ``There are just no environmental or hereditary factors other
than what we found in his workplace,'' Crane said. ``This place was
your real smoky bar.''
   Uhbi said he worked at the combination bar and restaurant in
Sausalito, just north of San Francisco, for five years. He has
since left to open his own restaurant down the road.
   ``New Year's we are putting in a `no smoking sign','' he said.

<TEXT>
   The decrepit Virginia State Penitentiary
was shut down Friday, a day after one of its last five inmates was
put to death for raping and murdering a woman 12 years ago.
   For the first time since the Civil War, the cells in the
190-year-old prison were empty. The last four inmates were loaded
in handcuffs into a van and taken to a prison in Greensville 55
miles away.
   In a ceremony a few minutes later, Warden Raymond Muncy asked
for the official prison population count. A few people smiled as
Maj. E.T. Turner stepped forward and declared, ``The count at the
Virginia State Penitentiary is zero.''
   ``Accordingly, in my capacity as the current warden, I now
declare the Virginia State Penitentiary closed,'' the warden said.
``Major, strike the colors.''
   Five guards walked in formation, lowered the Virginia and
American flags, folded them into triangles and saluted.
   About 12 hours earlier, Buddy Early Justus was executed in the
state's electric chair for the Oct. 3, 1978, rape-slaying of Ida
Moses. He also had received death sentences for murdering Rosemary
Jackson, 32, in Gwinnett County, Ga., and Stephanie Hawkins, 21, in
Tampa, Fla., later that month.
   No other prison in the state has the electrical hookup for the
chair, and the execution chamber will remain at the prison until
April, when a new death chamber at the Greensville prison is
expected to be completed.
   The antiquated prison will be torn down after the death chamber
is relocated.
   State law requires a working execution chamber.
   Justus was the 11th person to die in the electric chair since
Virginia resumed executions in 1982. He was the 143rd person to be
executed nationwide since the U.S. Supreme Court allowed states to
revive the death penalty in 1976.
   The electric chair is bolted to the floor in a basement cell
block.
   ``It's the first time since 1865 there's been no prisoners,''
said Bill Linkous, chief of operations for adult institutions.
   ``In 1865, the whole population escaped,'' said former warden
James P. Mitchell, who is helping close the prison. When Union
soldiers entered Richmond, the prison guards fled. With no one to
watch them, the inmates left, too, he said.
   Eighty-seven of the 187 prisoners were recaptured, Mitchell
said.
   The original penitentiary, built 190 years ago, was torn down in
1928. The oldest of the existing prison buildings is the factory
shops building, built in 1888.

<HEAD>Bush Mum On Party Leadership; Conservatives' Criticism Rises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush kept mum Friday on his new
search for a Republican Party chairman as conservatives, betting
they won't like his pick, said turmoil within the GOP makes it more
likely Bush will face a 1992 challenge from the right.
   Bush headed to Camp David for the weekend still having said
nothing publicly about William Bennett's abrupt decision not to
take over the Republican National Committee or his new search to
fill the GOP's leadership vacuum.
   Party officials and GOP analysts predicted Bush would act
quickly to fill the vacancy.
   The name of former Texas congressman Tom Loeffler figured
prominently in the speculation, with some party officials saying he
appeared to be the early favorite.
   At the White House, one source said Loeffler was in the running
but that there was no frontrunner. Another White House source said
bluntly that Loeffler ``is history,'' indicating a fight may be
brewing within the administration over the vacancy and whether Bush
needed a high-profile chairman to put the Bennett embarrassment
behind him.
   ``Tom is on the list, but a lot of people are on the list,''
said the first source, both of whom spoke on the condition of
anonymity. ``The president has not given a nod or a wink or a
whisper about his thinking.''
   Others mentioned in speculation included longtime Republican
operative and Bush loyalist Rich Bond, Housing Secretary Jack Kemp,
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner and several congressional
Republicans who lost 1990 elections or are retiring. Among them,
retiring Sen. William Armstrong of Colorado surfaced as a favorite
of conservatives, including administration aides.
   Bush filled one administration vacancy - nominating Rep. Lynn
Martin of Illinois as labor secretary - before heading to Camp
David for the weekend. The vacancy at the RNC did not come up
during a brief Bush meeting with reporters.
   An administration official said the list ``was in no order other
than alphabetical.''
   With the RNC annual meeting a month away and Bush facing
increasing criticism even within his party, there was little doubt
he would pick a chairman soon.
   ``The way the Bennett thing was handled, it looks like they
waffled back and forth,'' said Lyn Nofziger, who ran the political
operation in the Reagan White House. ``They seemed to have handled
it the same way they handled the tax thing, going back and forth. I
think he ought to do this pretty quickly and get it behind him.''
   Said another party official with ties to the White House:
``They'll be burning a little oil at Camp David to get this done.''
   A Loeffler associate said the former four-term congressman ``had
a good exchange of views about the job'' during a telephone
conversation Thursday with presidential Chief of Staff John Sununu.
But the administration official said Sununu had spoken to others as
well.
   Loeffler, 44, was a rising star in the GOP leadership when he
left the House, where he was known for his political skill and had
a conservative voting record, including votes in favor of school
prayer and limits on abortions.
   Armstrong also is a staunch, anti-abortion conservative.
   Bond, who did not return a telephone message, was said to be
actively pursuing the position as well, and getting support from
some in the party who favor a campaign strategist for chairman.
Another strategist whose name surfaced was Spence Abraham, the
Michigan GOP chairman.
   Bush decided in November to replace the ailing Lee Atwater as
chairman of the Republican National Committee, and selected Bennett
not long after he resigned as presidential drug policy chief. But
Bennett said Thursday that he would not take the job because of a
White House ruling severely limiting his options to make outside
income.
   That dramatic decision left conservatives, suspicious of Bush's
motives for selecting Bennett but happy nonetheless to have an ally
with access to the president, renewing talk of mounting a longshot
bid to wrest the 1992 nomination from the incumbent president.
   ``Conservatives are so disillusioned with Bush that anybody he
picks is really not going to be much of a help to him,'' said GOP
activist Richard Viguerie, echoing comments of several
conservatives. ``Many conservatives in the country are saying it's
time to get off the bus, turn it over and set it on fire. The bus
driver has serious problems.''
   But Nofziger said the conservative criticism was unlikely to
mushroom into a serious threat to Bush.
   ``There are an awful lot of conservatives who would rather go
fight somebody than run something,'' Nofziger said. ``I'm one of
them at heart but it just doesn't make sense. I don't see anyway
that anyone is going to mount a significant challenge.''

   The 1991 national peanut poundage quota will
be 1,555,000 tons, or 3.1 billion pounds, the Agriculture
Department said Friday.
   Deputy Secretary Jack C. Parnell said 1991 quota - the amount
determined that will be required to meet domestic edible and seed
needs - is down 10,000 tons, or 20 million pounds, from the 1990
quota.
   Under the program, states and qualified farms will be allocated
shares of the national quota.
   Peanuts grown under a quota are qualified for higher federal
price supports than non-quota peanuts.

<HEAD>Sanitation Workers Consider New Contract</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Private sanitation workers ratified a new
three-year contract Friday, ending a five-day strike that left tons
of uncollected garbage piled high on sidewalks.
   The 2,100 workers pick up trash from about 250,000 businesses
citywide. The vote to end the walkout was 269 to 24. Many of the
workers who did not vote had crossed picket lines.
   ``We're going back to work immediately,'' said Bernard
Adelstein, leader of Teamsters Local 813.
   Under the deal, the lowest-paid sanitation workers will get an
increase of 12.5 percent over three years, Adelstein said. A
$15-a-week raise kicks in June 1, 1991; $30-a-week raises will
follow Dec. 1, 1991, and Dec. 1, 1992, he said.
   The union set up picket lines Sunday night after rejecting an
offer that raised salaries $70 a week over three years. The union
sought a $90 increase in a three-year contract.
   The workers earn $600 to $700 a week under the old contract.
   Union leaders reached a tentative settlement Thursday during a
seven-hour session with city officials. A spokesman for management
did not return telephone messages left Friday.
   Besides better wages, the unions want private carters to pay a
fee for using out-of-state workers to haul trash to out-of-state
dumps. The companies agreed the union would have the right to
organize any such workers.
   The strike, the first by private sanitation workers since a
17-day walkout nine years ago, resulted in mounds of trash bags
outside fast food restaurants and movie theaters.
   Residential garbage collection - done by the city - was not
affected.

   Q. Well, you do think you can go to war after that, is that

   Q. You can start a war.
   A. I think that the United Nations resolutions should be fully

   Q. Mr. President, when Congress comes back in January, will you

   A. I - we're talking about that, and I'm very pleased with the
support we've had in Congress, and I'm very pleased with the level
of support from the American people. You see, as these hostages

in more support by the Congress. But I will be talking to the
leaders, continuing to consult.
   And what I told the leaders in the Cabinet Room a few weeks ago,
if you want to come in here and strongly endorse what I am doing or
endorse the United Nations resolution, I welcome that because I
think it would send a very strong, clear signal to the world.
   Q. Well, sir, why are you afraid to go before Congress and
consult with them and get their advice and get their approval?
   A. Hey, listen, Sarah, I was consulting with them as recently as
this morning - five members of Congress. And we will continue to
consult with them.
   Q. That's not 535 members of the House and Senate.
   A. We're doing it all the time. I'm on the phone almost every
day to them. We've had leadership meeting after leadership meeting.
Oh listen. I explained this to you in the press room a while back -
this same question. Come on.
   Q. But you should see my mail.
   A. You ought to see mine.
   Q. Are you saying if Saddam Hussein won't meet by Jan. 3, there
simply will be no meeting?
   A. I'm saying that he - we've given him 15 dates and he ought to
take one of them. I don't like to draw deadlines in the sand here.
But I - there'd have to be some compelling reason for me to change
it, because I don't want to move this up against the United Nations
deadline. If you'll read the U.N. resolutions, you'll see that he
should be totally out, totally out of Kuwait by Jan. 15. That's a
massive undertaking.
   Q. Mr. President, if I may follow up, are you saying that you
may meet Jan. 4 or 5?
   Q. I'm not saying that. You're saying that. I've put it as
clearly as I can. I hope there's no obfuscation.
   Q. Mr. President, what is your thinking today about Saddam
Hussein's nuclear and chemical capabilities?
   A. I am very much concerned about it. I think that Congress and
the American people are getting increasingly concerned about his -
it's not just nuclear which concerns me, but it's other
unconventional war capabilities. I'm talking about, for example in
this context, chemical weapons that he has used on his own people
already.
   So yes, I am very concerned about it, and any arrangement that
is going to keep the rest of the world happy will have to address
itself to these - this unconventional war capability of Saddam
Hussein. Anybody that will take the reckless action he has taken
militarily against a neighbor must be contained in this era when
we're all concerned about nuclear proliferation.
   So I'm glad you brought it up, because this morning I met with a
group of people who are supportive of our policy and they are
emphasizing to me, as they go across the country, the concern by
the American people - on the part of the American people - about
his possession of these unconventional weapons and his desire to
acquire nuclear weapons.
   And I told - I believe that it was a press conference with most
of you present - I said if I've got to err on the side of how long
- I addressed myself to the question, how long does he - will it
take for him to get weapons, I will err on the cautious side, on
the conservative side. And I am concerned that he could acquire
weapons in a very short period of time - a weapon in a very short
period of time. And that is a factor that is serious as I
contemplate how he is compelled to live up to the United Nations
resolution.
   Q. Mr. President, do you support the Department of Education
regulations barring race-based scholarships, or do you plan to
rescind them?
   A. We're looking at it right now. The man that had something to
do with them - I was looking at his background today - is an
extraordinarily sensitive, very intelligent person. So I've asked
our staff here to give me a quick readout on that so we can make a
determination. But I don't think in this case anybody would accuse
the person that promulgated those resolutions of doing it on a
racist basis. That's one thing I'm very pleased about.
   I've got time for one more, and then I really do have to go.
   Q. Mr. President, right now the issue of chemical - possession
of weapons and nuclear weapons is not part of the United Nations
resolutions. Will you go back to the U.N. and get that made part of
one of the requirements for Saddam Hussein or will you move on that
unilaterally?
   A. Well, I don't think it's unilateral because I think all our
coalition partners share my concerns about his possession of
unconventional weapons and his attempt to get more. But I don't
have plans at this moment to take this to the United Nations. But
believe me, it is very much in my thinking as I contemplate what
action to take to enforce the United Nations resolutions.
   Thank you all and have a great weekend.

   The 1991 federal marketing quota for
flue-cured tobacco was announced Friday by the Agriculture
Department at 877.7 million pounds, unchanged from the 1990 quota.
   The acreage allotment was pegged at 420,354 acres, unchanged
from 1990. Officials said each farm's 1991 basic quota and acreage
allotments will remain the same as this year.
   Officials said the 1991 price support will be $1.528 per pound,
up four cents from 1990.
   The 1991 marketing quota assessment under the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1990 will be 0.764 cents per pound on both
growers and buyers, meaning a total assessment of 1.528 cents per
pound for the 1991 crop of flue-cured tobacco.
   The no-net-cost program assessment will be announced later, the
department said.

   The average income of physicians increased about
$11,000 to more than $155,000 in 1989, according to a study by the
American Medical Association.
   The 7.7 percent increase outstripped the rate of inflation, as
measured by the Consumer Price Index, which increased 4.6 percent
in 1989.
   The president-elect of the AMA, the nation's largest
organization of doctors, said Friday he could see public concern
about the increase but he didn't think doctors as a group ``are
overpaid or underpaid.''
   ``I would expect the average person's reaction to be surprise,
but when you think about the number of hours a doctor works in a
week, and some of the training, the intensity of some of the work
in some of the specialties, I think it's understandable,'' said Dr.
John J. Ring.
   Ring, a family physician in suburban Mundelein, noted that the
increase in 1989, the last year in which the figures were
available, was actually smaller than most years since 1981.
   Average physician income nationally was $155,800 in 1989, up
from the 1988 average of $144,700, the AMA said.
   The median physician income - the statistical midpoint between
the highest and lowest salaries - was $125,000 in 1989, up from
$120,000 in 1988. The AMA says it prefers the median figure because
higher paid doctors tend to raise the average, making it a poor
measure of ``typical'' earnings.
   The figures are from the Chicago-based AMA's Socioeconomic
Monitoring System Report, which surveyed 4,000 doctors. The figures
represent income before taxes but after all professional expenses.
   In 1981, the first year of the survey, the average was $89,900.
   Family physicians earned the least, an average of $95,900 in
1989 compared with $94,600 in 1988.
   Surgeons earned the most among specialists, a 1989 average of
$220,500 compared with $207,500 in 1988.
   Charles Inlander, president of the People's Medical Society, a
consumer interest group in suburban Philadelphia, called the
figures ``another example of how doctors gouge the public.''
   ``It is immoral for doctors to have this kind of income when 15
percent of the population has no health-care insurance,'' he said.
   A survey conducted last year for the AMA found that two-thirds
of Americans think doctors are too interested in making money.
   But the salary survey can be misleading, said one central
Illinois family physician with a solo practice.
   ``Some kinds of doctors are overpaid, some are not paid what
they're worth,'' said Dr. George Savvas of Champaign. General
practitioners in Champaign make closer to $75,000 than $95,000,
Savvas said.
   ``It's not very easy money. I get myself up at 5 o'clock in the
morning and I go home at night and most of the time I don't even
get a break,'' Savvas said.
   There is also the cost of malpractice insurance and difficulties
getting paid through the Medicare system, Savvas said. Primary care
doctors often lose their Medicare payments to specialists they have
referred their patients to, he said.
   Insurers have long paid high fees for technical procedures and
operations and much less for the hours that primary care doctors
spend figuring out which treatments their patients need. But
beginning in 1992, Medicare will reimburse doctors more for their
time managing and evaluating patients and less for technical
services and operations.
   Here are some other average 1989 incomes for specialties other
than surgeons, according to the AMA survey:
   -Internal medicine, $146,500;
   -Pediatrics, $104,700;
   -Obstetrics-gynecology, $194,300;
   -Radiology, $210,500;
   -Psychiatry, $111,700;
   -Anesthesiologist, $185,800;
   -Pathologist, $154,500;

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ethnic Albanian leader said
Friday changes in neighboring Albania would bolster efforts for
autonomy in Yugoslavia's troubled Kosovo province.
   ``The victory of democracy in Albania would represent great
support and encouragement for the struggle of Albanian people in
Yugoslavia,'' said Dr. Fehmi Agani, leader of the Democratic Union
of Kovoso.
   The first non-Communist political party was formed in Albania
this week. There also have been reports of street violence, despite
a string of concessions by authorities in Europe's last Stalinist
nation.
   Agani said his group was concerned about reports of clashes in
Albania, but ``we believe ... that there is enough wisdom, strength
and resolution in Albania to safeguard a peaceful, accelerated
democratic transformation of the country.''
   Ethnic Albanians comprise about 90 percent of the 1.9 million
people in Kosovo, a Yugoslav province now tightly controlled by the
Serbian republic.
   Last Sunday, most ethnic Albanians boycotted the first free
elections in more than 50 years in Serbia.
   After the Kosovo parliament proclaimed sovereignty this summer,
the Serbian government dismissed legislators and shut down all
influential Albanian-language media in the province.
   Serbia sees the region as its historic homeland, and refuses to
grant Kosovo greater independence. Serbian authorities charge that
Albanians are seeking to secede and join Albania.
   Leading ethnic Albanian dissident author Rexhep Qosja said in a
telephone interview that ``it is natural for'' Albanians to live
together.
   ``Why would the people of Kosovo be an exception?'' Qosja asked.
``I believe that Serbia will one day rather negotiate with Albania
about Kosovo than to allow the province to become a republic.''
   ``There is no turning back in Albania and the democracy will win
there,'' he said.

<HEAD>Army Canceling Plan For New Air Defense Missile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army said Friday it has canceled plans to
build a new air-defense missile under development by Boeing
Aerospace and Electronics Co. and Hughes Aircraft Co.
   The estimated cost of fully developing of the weapon, called the
Non-Line of Sight missile, has tripled over the past two years, to
nearly $400 million, the Army said in explaining why it decided to
end the project after spending $131 million.
   The missile was being designed with a fiber-optic guidance
system that would enable Army gunners to use it against helicopters
and armored vehicles hidden by ground cover. The missile's launcher
and fire control station were to be mounted on a Hum-vee, the
all-purpose vehicle that replaced the Army jeep.
   The proposed missile was part of the Army's plan for an
integrated air-defense system for front-line combat operations. The
plan, still in effect, includes the air-to-air Stinger missile
deployed on helicopters, improved tank ammunition for air defense
and an improved command and control system.

<TEXT>
   Saddam Hussein take notice: squid swimming off the
shores of Cape Cod have a secret weapon against nerve gas.
   An enzyme within squid nerve cells breaks down nerve gas and has
the attention of military researchers, who are trying to find
practical uses for it on the battlefield.
   ``When you know that some people have chemical weapons, you need
to know how to get rid of them,'' said Shirley Tove of the Army
Research Office in Research Triangle Park, N.C.
   The U.S. military has had more reason lately to fear nerve gas,
as troops face the threat of Iraqi chemical weapons in the Persian
Gulf.
   The squid nerve gas defense was discovered by Francis Hoskin,
who has spent his summers collecting squid at the Marine Biological
Laboratory in Woods Hole.
   More than two decades ago, Hoskin applied nerve poison to a
squid nerve and was astonished when the nerve kept functioning.
   ``What was happening was most of the nerve gas solution was
being detoxified, or chewed up, by the enzyme,'' he said in a
recent interview.
   Hoskin, a research professor of biology at the Illinois
Institute of Technology in Chicago, continued studying the enzyme.
   The Defense Department has helped fund Hoskin's research through
much of the past decade, Tove said.
   Scientists envision attaching the enzyme to fabric, thus
enabling the Army to create protective uniforms. Another
possibility is enzyme-laden soap, which could be used to wash the
chemicals off the skin or equipment.
   Such applications, however, probably will not be seen for years,
Tove said. First of all, scientists must develop ways to clone the
enzyme, since each squid produces only a microscopic amount of the
substance.
   And the Army is not banking completely on squid. A similar
enzyme produced by soil bacteria also is being studied, Tove said.
   Hoskin said military officials have been asking him more
questions about his work since Iraq invaded Kuwait in August.
   But Hoskin, who was a pilot in World War II and describes
himself as ``not the world's greatest pacifist,'' says that for now
he's more interested in pure science than military strategy.
   ``Why should a squid that has been evolving for almost 1 billion
years, why should it have an enzyme to deal with a compound that
was only synthesized in the 1920s?'' Hoskin asked.

   Owens Valley along the eastern Sierra

   The magnitude-3.4 temblor struck at 6:22 a.m. and was centered
11 miles south of Lone Pine, said seismologist Rick McKenzie of the
University of California seismographic station at Berkeley.
   A few residents of Lone Pine, 175 miles north of Los Angeles,

   ``It was reported as being a very sharp jolt but lasting only a

   Owens Valley was the site of one of three great earthquakes in
California's recorded history, a jolt that measured 8 on the
Richter scale. The quake March 26, 1872, killed 27 people and
injured 56 others.

   Palestinians stabbed three Jews to death in
an aluminum factory Friday and sprayed Moslem fundamentalist
slogans on the walls before fleeing, police said. The killings set
off anti-Arab riots and cries for vengeance.
   The latest in a string of knife attacks on Jewish civilians also
brought demands from Israeli right-wingers for a crackdown on
Palestinians.
   Police Minister Roni Milo promised ``unprecedented measures''
and said he had decided to support use of the death penalty.
Capital punishment exists on Israeli military law books but is
never imposed.
   He said he would limit the hours per day that Arabs from the
occupied territories can stay in Israel.
   Right-wing politicians, including members of the governing
coalition, demanded the deportation of 1,000 leaders of the
anti-Israeli uprising and the dismissal of the more than 100,000
Arabs who live in the occupied lands but work in Israel.
   Moderate Israelis blamed Friday's killings on the failure of
Arab-Israeli peace moves.
   The slayings in the mixed Arab-Jewish town of Jaffa, adjacent to
Tel Aviv, brought Jewish mobs onto the streets, stoning cars,
assaulting Arab passersby and clamoring for revenge.
   Police said the attack was thought to be the work of an Arab
from the occupied Gaza Strip who works at the factory, and one
accomplice. Both were still being sought, they said.
   The attackers apparently waited outside the Alum Shin plant
until two Jewish employees arrived and escorted them in. They then
stabbed Iris Asraf, a 22-year-old secretary; metal cutter Moshe
Awan, 40; and Yehoshua Hakmaz, 30, an upholsterer working next door
who ran to help after hearing screams, police said.
   The bodies were found at about 8:30 a.m. when another secretary
arrived, found knives and pools of blood on the floor and called
for help, police said.
   An unidentified witness told Israel radio he saw one man ``lying
on the steps, folded like a bag. ... The knives were thrown near
the body, long knives with wide blades, real commando knives.''
   Police said slogans in black paint on the walls claimed
responsibility on behalf of Hamas, or Zeal, an Islamic
fundamentalist underground group.
   Hamas, which marked the third anniversary of its foundation
Friday, had called on Palestinians to mark the date by escalating
their uprising against Israel.
   Police commissioner Yaacov Terner rushed to the scene and said:
``The sole reason for this murder is nationalism. The slogans
written in Arabic on the walls inside are clear.''
   ``Hamas did it, they did it for the purpose of killing to mark
the Hamas anniversary,'' he said.
   There were shouts of ``Death to Arabs!'' and ``Terner go Home!''
from Jews accusing police of not doing enough to protect Israelis,
and angry people gathered near murder victim Hakmaz's house in
neighboring Bat Yam.
   ``I feel great pain that every day Jews die in every corner of
the country. Now it came to us. I'm afraid to let my wife go out
... at night, I have to get downstairs and accompany them,'' one
man said on Israel radio.
   Paramilitary border police poured into Jaffa to reinforce police
coping with crowds of angry Jews. The rioters torched a car with a
Gaza license plate and besieged a coffee shop where an Arab had
taken refuge behind the police.
   ``Let's do to them what they do to us,'' bellowed one man. ``If
we aren't safe among them, they shouldn't be safe among us.''
   Police said three Arab cars were damaged, one Arab was slightly
injured by a knife, and three Jews were arrested.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, returning from talks with
President Bush in Washington, said he would consult colleagues
about the killings, but added he was sensitive to U.S. appeals for
restraint.
   Asked about reports that Israel was planning to deport 12
uprising leaders and that Washington had urged him not to do it,
Shamir said: ``Nothing explicit was said to me'' about canceling
any particular measure.
   But, Shamir added, he found ``sensitivity'' in the
administration ``to drastic measures against Palestinian rioters
and disturbers of the peace.''
   Asked if this would influence his actions, Shamir replied that
``of course, we are sensitive to this sensibility.''
   Friday's deaths raised to 57 the number of Israelis killed by
Palestinians in the three-year revolt in the occupied West Bank and
the Gaza Strip. In the last attack on Dec. 2, three West Bank Arabs
boarded a bus in Tel Aviv, stabbed a Jew to death and wounded three
others.
   The recent wave of attacks followed the Temple Mount riot, in
which 17 Palestinians were shot and killed by Israeli police.
   In another announcement Friday, Police Minister Milo said he
will prohibit Jewish extremists from celebrating the Jewish holiday
of Hanukkah at the site next week.
   At least 778 Arabs have been killed by Israeli troops or
civilians in the uprising. Palestinians have murdered 317 fellow
Arabs, most on suspicion of collaborating with Israel.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Issues Crackdown to Ensure Supplies to Moscow
^Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Gorbachev's presidential
decree to ensure food supplies, restore order to economy. No

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev acted on Friday to
try to restore order to the chaotic Soviet economy, nullifying
decisions by the republics and local authorities that have
disrupted food supplies.
   He also decreed that government enterprises must carry out all
contracts through the rest of this year and the first quarter of
1991 to ensure a steady flow of supplies.
   His move represented a crackdown on those regions that have
broken the discipline that for years has guided the Soviet Union's
command economy.
   Parliament has pressured Gorbachev to improve food supplies,
particularly in Moscow and Leningrad, where state stores have
little milk, sugar, eggs, butter, cheese and meat. Some right-wing
lawmakers demand a state of emergency.
   Moscow city officials accuse surrounding regions that usually
supply the capital with food of reneging on contracts and stopping
deliveries.
   Gorbachev's presidential decree ``On Combatting Disorganization
of the Soviet Economy'' was read Friday night on Soviet television.
   In it, Gorbachev complained that government economic decisions
``have not been carried out.''
   He declared ``null and void all economic decisions by local and
republic bodies which undermine normal trade.'' He also ordered
local and republic officials to reverse decisions to stop supplying
Russian regions and Moscow.
   The decree ordered the government to apply tough sanctions on
exporters who fail to secure proper licenses and contracts to sell
raw materials and other goods abroad. This appeared aimed at
preventing any of the 15 republics from signing contracts with
foreign firms to export resources without central government
consent.
   Earlier Friday, presidential economic adviser Stanislav Shatalin
blamed food shortages entirely to distribution problems and
economic disarray. He urged that emergency steps be taken, without
specifying what he had in mind.
   Soviet ports and borders have been swamped by shipments. More
than 1.6 million metric tons of imported goods were waiting to be
unloaded or transported from ports and about 7,000 railways cars
were waiting at border stations.
   The government says deliveries of most products are running 15
percent to 44 percent below 1989 levels, mostly due to theft and
profiteering.
   ``Hunger is not an issue. There's enough food,'' Shatalin said
in an interview. ``The issue is how to find it and distribute it so
that it doesn't get into the hands of the mafia, sabateours and
corrupted elements.''
   Shatalin had spearheaded a radical economic reform plan at the
center of recent political battles.
   Black marketeers have pilfered state supplies. Heavy-handed
economic control makes it more profitable for farmers to sell their
products through unofficial channels.
   Friday's Moskovskaya Pravda reported that the KGB secret police,
searching Moscow warehouses for hidden food, found in one shop
nearly two metric tons of meat, 750 cans of instant coffee and 880
pounds of butter. One Moscow fish distribution enterprise had 193
metric tons of black caviar whose date of sale had already expired,
the newspaper said.
   Shatalin said efforts at economic and political change are
linked beyond recall with the food problem. But in the course of
working out reforms, ``there were things we didn't know how to do,
and couldn't do, and a difficult situation emerged. And these have
to be resolved by emergency measures,'' he said.
   Foreign countries continued to send the Soviet Union tons of
humanitarian aid. At a summit meeting in Rome, the European
Community on Friday approved a $1 billion emergency aid package to
help the Soviet economy and support Gorbachev.
   About 1,700 metric tons and 800 tons of medicine and other
supplies have arrived, with most going to hospitals and children's
homes, officials said.
   The aid also is meant to bolster Gorbachev, who has been
attacked by hard-liners and radicals during the nation's economic
and political turmoil.
   Gorbachev ordered the KGB and other law enforcement bodies to
halt pilfering, and government commissions have been formed to
monitor the problem and direct the distribution of food. Workers'
committees and other informal groups also are tracking food on the
way to its destination, Shatalin said.
   But the heart of the problem remains land ownership and the
chance to produce food profitably, he said. Individuals must be
given farmland from the state-owned farms and from collective farms
that now can reserve only some of their produce for private use.
   Individual Soviets already have the right to own tiny plots of
land, which alone account for an estimated 30 percent of the
country's food sold through high-priced private markets.
   Shatalin last autumn championed radical economic reforms that,
among other things, would allow private property ownership. But
Gorbachev rejected the plan in October in favor of a conservative
compromise.
   The move precipitated a split with Boris Yeltsin, president of
the Russian republic, who pushed ahead with the radical plan on
Russian territory. Russia and other republics began issuing orders
that conflicted with Gorbachev's decrees, causing a paralysis of
power that has contributed to the food problem.
   KGB chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov, in a nationally televised
address Tuesday, also accused unidentified foreign powers of
supporting Soviet radicals, who were in turn exploiting spot food
shortages.

   Philadelphia missed a self-imposed deadline
Friday for solving its cash crunch, but the city treasurer said he
expected a deal to be ready by next week.
   Several parties interested in lending money have declined to
commit themselves, pending resolution of such issues as fiscal
reform and who gets repaid first, city Treasurer Benjamin Blakney
said.
   The city intends to sell about $300 million in short-term notes
to banks, two pension boards and the investment firm Merrill Lynch
to avoid going broke before major tax payments come due in February
and March.
   A $375 million note issue collapsed in September amid worries
about the city's fiscal condition. Bond-rating agencies have
dropped Philadelphia's credit rating this year to junk-bond levels,
the lowest among major U.S. cities.
   Unless it receives a cash infusion, the city has warned it will
not be able to meet payroll as early as Dec. 28 for city workers.
   Finance Director Elizabeth C. Reveal, in a letter Monday, set
deadlines of Friday for commitments to buy notes and next Wednesday
for closing the deal.
   ``There are open issues which clearly are still being looked at
and quite frankly are still being discussed,'' Blakney said. ``We
will continue as expeditiously as possible to resolve those
issues.''
   He said interest rates were less of a stumbling block than
structural aspects of the transaction. While declining to go into
details, he said major unresolved issues included fiscal reform and
whether all note holders would be repaid simultaneously.
   Representatives from a consortium of banks met privately with
Gov. Robert P. Casey on Thursday and Mayor W. Wilson Goode on
riday. The banks reportedly have sought a fiscal control board,
double-digit interest rates and assurances they would be repaid
before other note buyers.
   Goode described his meeting with the bankers as ``very
constructive,'' said his press secretary, Karen Warrington.
   ``The mayor feels they're continuing to make progress and the
parties are working to pull together a package that could avoid a
missed payroll,'' she said.
   Members of the city pension board and the state teachers pension
fund met but did not vote on any proposals related to the note
sale.
   The city Board of Pensions and Retirement is awaiting a report
from Ian Lanoff, a Washington pension-law expert, who was hired to
advise them on the note transaction.
   Blakney said Lanoff was ``fine-tuning some of the salient
details'' of a response to the city's proposal.
   Similar responses were being drafted by the banks, Merrill Lynch
and consultants to the state Public School Employees' Retirement
Board, he said.
   Goode and other Democratic leaders have urged higher taxes,
spending cuts, long-term deficit financing and other steps to stem
the red ink. Action on those steps is not expected until the state
Legislature reconvenes early next year.

<HEAD>Widow of Civil Rights Leader Medgar Evers Testifies Before Grand
Jury</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Myrlie Evers, the widow of slain civil
rights leader Medgar Evers, testified for an hour Friday before a
grand jury investigating her husband's 1963 assassination.
   ``I'm filled with a little apprehension, a lot of hope and
faith,'' Evers said as she left the Hinds County Courthouse, where
the grand jury met amid speculation it may issue a new indictment
in the 27-year-old case.
   The panel Thursday summoned a former police detective who
investigated the slaying scene at Evers' Jackson home. Grand jurors
also examined the rifle used to kill Evers.
   Byron De La Beckwith, 70, a white supremacist from Signal
Mountain, Tenn., has said he is the target of the grand jury
investigation. He has also said he is innocent.
   Beckwith was arrested after the slaying, but two 1964 trials
ended with all-white juries deadlocked on verdicts. The original
murder indictment was dismissed in 1969.
   Beckwith was a Greenwood fertilizer salesman at the time of the
slaying. Evers, 37 when he died, was field secretary for the
Mississippi branch of the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People.
   Assistant District Attorney Bobby DeLaughter spent nearly six
hours with the grand jury Thursday.
   DeLaughter, who has spent 14 months looking into the slaying,
couldn't comment on the secret proceedings. But he did say he views
reopening the case as a way to help right an old wrong.
   ``This single, cowardly act of the person responsible for Medgar
Evers' assassination has probably done more to hurt the state and
to hurt the perception of Mississippi and Mississippians across the
nation, and possibly the world, than any other single act I can
think of,'' DeLaughter said.
   ``If it's possible to right that wrong, I certainly think we
have a responsibility of doing that. If we could pick up where the
previous investigation left off, produce more evidence, I think we
have an obligation of doing that,'' DeLaughter said.
   State Fire Marshal John Chamblee, a Jackson police detective
sergeant at the time of the June 12, 1963, slaying, would not
comment Thursday after leaving the grand jury room.
   One piece of evidence seen taken into the grand jury room was a
1917 model 30.06 Enfield rifle equipped with a scope.
   At the two 1964 trials, a Jackson police fingerprint expert
testified prints found on the scope matched Beckwith's.
   Testimony in the trials also showed Beckwith obtained the rifle
in 1960 and acquired the scope about one month before Evers was
shot. Beckwith testified that the rifle was stolen from him.
   Evers' 57-year-old widow, now a Los Angeles public works
commissioner, spent most of Thursday in the district attorney's
office at the courthouse.
   ``I'm here to assist in any way I possibly can with the grand
jury hearing,'' she said. ``It's something that needs to be put to
rest. Justice needs to be done for the state of Mississippi and for
Medgar's family. I'm hopeful this time.''

   The artwork was done by Mark Hampton, an interior designer,
artist and writer involved in the restoration of the White House

   The cards were printed by Hallmark. The White House said the
Republican national Committee was paying for the printing and

   President Bush, seeking to avoid a damaging
civil rights dispute, said Friday he has asked his staff ``to get a
quick readout'' on an Education Department ruling that could bar
colleges from directing scholarship funds to minorities.
   ``We're looking at it right now,'' Bush said at a news
conference when asked about the surprise decision which drew an
immediate outcry from civil rights and education leaders.
   The Education Department's assistant secretary for civil rights,
Michael L. Williams, on Wednesday announced that it was illegal for
federally supported institutions to offer scholarships specifically
for minorities.
   He cited Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits
discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in
any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.
   The White House acknowledged Friday that it was caught off-guard
by the decision. Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
that while Bush supports affirmative action programs for
minorities, he is against quota systems.
   ``This is a kind of an in-between case that is not clear exactly
where it comes through, how it would be applied, what it means,''
Fitzwater said.
   Bush defended Williams, saying he was ``an extrardinarily
sensitive person. I don't think anyone would accuse him of doing it
on a racist basis.''
   Williams, 37, is a black lawyer who prosecuted racial crimes in
the Reagan administration's Justice Department and served as deputy
assistant secretary for law enforcement in the Treasury Department
before moving to Education.
   Williams on Friday told Louisville civil rights activist Rev.
Louis Coleman that the issue of ``race-specific'' scholarships was
``still under discussion,'' Coleman told The Associated Press.
   Coleman quoted Williams as saying the issue was now ``in other
hands,'' suggesting that higher officials in the Bush
administration had moved in to prevent a further widening of the
rift between Bush and civil rights groups.
   Bush this fall vetoed a major civil rights bill passed by
Congress on the grounds it would create quota systems in the
employment of minorities. Civil rights groups said the veto showed
the administration's insensitivity to minority problems.
   On Friday, civil rights leaders Jesse Jackson said the Education
Department's premise that minority scholarships are illegal because
``we now live in a color-blind society ... is patently false and
morally reprehensible.''
   He said the president has the power to overrule Williams and
``we must write and telephone President Bush and register our
protest and outrage.''
   Also on Friday, Deputy Secretary of Education Ted Sanders met
the leaders of six national educational associations to assure them
that scholarships already granted to minority students will not be
affected.
   Sanders said the department hopes to issue a clarification on
the issue in the next few weeks, department spokesman John Bertak
said.
   Educators say they are not clear what programs or how many
people could be affected by the ruling. Federally funded programs
to assist minorities are apparently not involved and private grants
are permissible. Targeted would be college and university programs
that set aside funding specifically for certain minorities.
   Robin Robinson, director of financial aid at American University
in Washington, said her school's $1.1 million Frederick Douglass
program, aimed mainly at minorities from local high schools, should
be safe because other factors besides race are considered. But she
said, ``we're just waiting to see what the intent of it (the
ruling) is.''
   The House Education and Labor Committee is to open hearings
Wednesday on the scholarship issue, with Williams among those
testifying, committee officials said.

<HEAD>U.N. Leader to Visit Palestinian Refugees, Urges Peace Conference</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the General Assembly said
Friday that he will visit Palestinian refugee camps in the
Israeli-occupied territories and Jordan next month.
   Guido de Marco made the announcement the day after the
159-member U.N. body voted overwhelmingly in favor of sanctions
against Israel for occupying the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and to
convene an international peace conference.
   De Marco, who is the foreign minister of Malta, also repeated
the call for a Middle East peace conference at a news conference
Friday, saying it ``must become a reality.''
   General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, but they
carry moral weight as the expression of the will of the
international community, especially in the post-Cold War era when
the United States and the Soviet Union are cooperating on many
issues.
   By contrast, resolutions passed by the 15-nation Security
Council are considered legally binding. The United States has been
trying to prevent any reference to a Middle East peace conference
in a draft resolution providing more protection for the
Palestinians.
   The United States maintains such a reference might be
misinterpreted by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein as linking the
Israeli-Palestinian issue to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, which the
United States refuses to do.
   De Marco told reporters his trip to the Palestinian camps was to
``give the human problem more political importance than it has had
so far.''
   The visit would be the first time the president of the General
Assembly has been to the camps, U.N. officials said.
   De Marco's itinerary was not disclosed, but the trip was
expected to take place in the first week of January and will
probably include meetings with government leaders in Israel and
Jordan, the officials said.
   The United States and non-aligned members of the Security
Council are at an impasse over the reference to an international
peace conference in the draft resolution, although it merely states
longstanding U.S. policy. Negotiations are continuing, and the
council is to meet again Monday.
   Some Arab members have indicated that if the the stalemate
persists in the council they would try to raise the issue in the
General Assembly.
   De Marco said Friday that he did not want to force a
contradiction between the positions of the assembly and the
council, and therefore hoped the issue could be resolved without
recourse to the assembly.
   De Marco, in line with usual U.N. policy, said that a peace
conference should include all interested parties, including Israel
and the Palestine Liberation Organization, but should not preclude
bilateral negotiations.
   Israeli officials have rejected a peace conference, saying that
the primary vehicle for peace should be bilateral negotiations with
its neighbors. They have said Israel would refuse to accept a
settlement imposed upon it and would not negotiate with the PLO.

<HEAD>Heavy Snow in The Rockies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A snow storm took aim at the northern Mississippi Valley on
Friday after blasting the Rockies with up to 16 inches of snow and
a new storm moved into the Northwest.
   A cold front crossing the Rockies produced heavy snow in the
mountains of Colorado from Thursday into Friday, with up to 10
inches of new snow at Wolf Creek Pass. Many other ski areas in
Colorado received at least half a foot of fresh powder.
   Wind gusts of 60 to 70 mph were reported in the Denver area
during the morning and gusts to 74 were reported at Rustic, west of
Fort Collins. Jeff Schwartz, a spokesman for EG&amp;G-Rocky Flats, said
an 82 mph gust was recorded at Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant
outside Denver.
   The snowstorm reached blizzard-like intensity Friday morning in
the area of Aspen, Colo., where schools were closed because of
slippery roads and whiteout conditions, said Paul Gard of the
National Weather Service in Denver. One Colorado traffic death was
blamed on the weather.
   The cold front produced 6 to 12 inches of snow in the mountains
of western Wyoming during the night and snow spread across the
state's northern mountains during the morning. Snowfall totals at
midday ranged up to 14 inches at Deer Haven Lodge.
   The cold front also gave Utah heavy snow, with up to 8 inches in
southwestern and central sections of the state, from Cedar City to
Salina. Ski resorts east of the Wasatch Front received 12 to 16
inches of new snow.
   The cold front produced 3 to 6 inches of snow in southern Idaho
on Thursday and westerly wind blowing at 20 to 40 mph on Friday
caused considerable blowing snow, closing Interstate 84 east of
Burley to the Utah state line.
   In Montana, a small weather disturbance behind the cold front
spread light snow across southern sections of the state.
   Snow spread into South Dakota during the morning and freezing
drizzle developed in southwestern Nebraska, changing to light snow
during the afternoon.
   By Saturday morning, snow was expected in parts of Minnesota and
Wisconsin, the National Weather Service said.
   A strong Pacific storm system bore down on the West Coast, with
showers developing along the coast of Washington state. It was
expected to produce heavy snow during the weekend in the mountains
of Washington, Oregon and northern California.
   Elsewhere Friday, a few light showers developed over the
Carolinas.
   Afternoon temperatures remained below freezing across most of
the area from the northern half of the high Plains region to New
England, with readings only in the teens over parts of northern New
England and upstate New York.
   Caribou, Maine, reported a temperature of just 9 degrees at
midday. Mount Washington, standing to an elevation of 6,288 feet,
reported a temperature of 3 above zero, along with northwesterly
wind at 50 mph.
   Friday's low in the Lower 48 states was 3 below zero at
Marquette, Mich.

<HEAD>Teen-Ager's Heart Tumor Led to Abuse Charges Against Cult Members</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAKE CITY, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Criminal charges were filed against a
couple belonging to a secretive sect that shuns formal medical care
after their son was found close to death from an unattended heart
tumor.
   The couple are members of End Time Ministries. A tenet of the
Christian cult is that doctors and hospitals are instruments of the
devil.
   Death was a ``high probability'' when William Myers, 16, of Lake
City was taken Oct. 22 to Gainesville's Shands Hospital by his
parents nearly seven months into his illness, court records show.
   The once-husky Myers arrived at the hospital weighing less than
100 pounds. He suffered not only from the heart tumor but also from
liver and kidney failure. He was unable to walk because of running
sores on his feet.
   ``You've seen those pictures of people in Nazi concentration
camps, their arms and legs about as big around as a finger? That's
about how he looked,'' said Beryl Mayo, a Columbia County sheriff's
investigator.
   The youth told Mayo that he had never in his life been taken to
a doctor.
   An emergency heart operation saved the youth's life and he
remains hospitalized.
   His parents, Charles and Marilee Myers were charged Dec. 5 with
child abuse. They are free on bond pending an arraignment.
   The state Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services would
not comment, as a matter of policy, on the case and would not say
if the teen was still in his parents' custody. The prosecutor could
not immediately be reached. Several hundred End Timers live in this
community of 10,000 people in northern Florida, forming a tight
community nearly impervious to outsiders. Their leader is Charles
Meade, who brought his distinctive religious beliefs to Florida
from Indiana in 1984.
   Meade teaches that illness is a sign of sin and that faith is
the only true medicine. The doctrine helped shield his followers
from prosecution two years ago when the Myers' 4-day-old grandson
died after a three-day nosebleed.
   Doctors testified at the inquest that an injection of vitamin K
would have saved the boy's life. No charges were filed.
   But a third-degree murder conviction against Christian
Scientists, whose 7-year-old daughter died in Sarasota of
complications from diabetes, convinced prosecutors to pursue the
case against the Myerses.
   The Myerses could not be reached for comment. Their attorney,
Karin Moore, refused comment through her secretary. A woman
answering the phone at Meade's house refused to discuss the case or
End Time Ministries.
   Lake City optician Anne Conner said the End Timers have made
neighbors in the housing development where they live uneasy.
   Two sentries carrying walkie-talkies continually watch the
neighborhood, Conner said. They stopped cars and asked motorists
why they were in the area until the sheriff told them to stop.
   Conner, after researching the group's history, held neighborhood
meetings to share what she had learned.
   An Iowa-based group that monitors medicine-shy religious bodies
has charged the sect's beliefs have led to the deaths of a dozen
children in Florida, Montana, South Dakota and Illinois.
   ``It scared the heck out of me to think that this was going to
happen in this town,'' Conner said. ``I guess I felt threatened.''

<HEAD>Bar Probing Former Prosecutor For Alleged Misconduct in Murder
Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former prosecutor faulted in an unfair
murder trial that wrongly put a man in prison for 21 years is under
investigation by the Florida bar for alleged misconduct in another
murder case.
   The bar launched an investigation of Frank Schaub this week
following a Florida Supreme Court decision citing ``instances of
misconduct too numerous to list'' in the 1987 trial of Frederick
Charles Nowitzke.
   The court unanimously threw out Nowitzke's murder convictions
and death sentence Dec. 6 and suggested Schaub's conduct warrants
disciplinary action.
   ``The nature of the complaint is interfering with justice,''
said Barbara Malatino, an administrative assistant in the bar's
Tampa office.
   ``All he ever did was prosecute the very best he knew how,''
said Mack Futch, a longtime friend and assistant to Schaub. ``I've
never known him to do anything unethical. In my time, I've never
heard of a vigorous prosecution resulting in an ethics
investigation.''
   It is the second high-profile murder case in two years in which
Schaub has been publicly criticized.
   After two decades behind bars, James Richardson was freed last
year after a judge ruled the former Arcadia fruit picker didn't get
a fair trial in 1968 in the poisoning death of one of his children.
Seven of Richardson's children died from a pesticide-tainted lunch
in 1967.
   The bar regulates lawyers and can recommend the state Supreme
Court take disciplinary action, from reprimand to removal from
legal practice.
   Schaub retired in 1988 after 16 years as state attorney and 12
as a circuit judge. He still is a licensed lawyer.
   Nowitzke was convicted in the 1985 shooting deaths of his mother
Frances Carroll, 53, stepbrother Brett Carroll, 11, and the
wounding of his stepfather, former major league pitcher Clay
Carroll, 49, in their Bradenton home.
   The Supreme Court particularly criticized Schaub for personally
attacking Detroit psychiatrist Dr. Emanuel Tanay, who testified the
defendant was insane at the time of the shootings.
   With the jury present, Schaub asked Tanay whether he had once
been called a ``hired gun'' and implied Tanay charged $600 an hour
for his services when Schaub knew his fee was $150 an hour, the
court said.
   He also made derogatory remarks about Tanay's hometown and
``insulted the witness generally,'' the court found.
   ``After sitting through 13 days of Mr. Schaub's courtroom
antics, I think it's more than appropriate,'' said assistant public
defender Jim Slater, who represented Nowitzke, 31.
   Dade County State Attorney Janet Reno, appointed by Gov. Bob
Martinez to investigate the case, concluded last year that Schaub
suppressed evidence and knowingly used perjured testimony at
Richardson's trial.
   Richardson, 54, is suing Schaub, former DeSoto Sheriff Frank
Cline, the state and DeSoto County in U.S. District Court in Tampa,
alleging they conspired to violate his civil rights.
   The case was scheduled for trial in January but has been
postponed until March because the 69-year-old Schaub is ill.

<HEAD>Air Travel Tax Could Draw $240 Million Over Holidays</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 23 million holiday fliers are
expected to pay a record $240 million in U.S. air travel user taxes
during the 17-day Christmas-New Year holiday period, a trade group
said Friday.
   Peak travel days will be Friday and Saturday, Dec. 21 and 22,
with more than 1.6 million passengers traveling each day, and
Tuesday and Wednesday, Jan. 1 and 2, when about 1.5 million daily
passengers are expected, according to the Partnership for Improved
Air Travel, an association of air travel businesses.
   The holiday travel period begins on Dec. 19 and ends on Jan. 4,
according to the group.
   A 25 percent increase in user taxes for the Aviation Trust Fund
went into effect on Dec. 1. This included a 10 percent increase in
the airline ticket tax.
   Airline passengers, private pilots and business aviation and air
cargo shippers now will pay about $5 billion a year for
user-financed airport improvements, the association said.
   The association is pushing such improvements to reduce air
traffic delays and airport congestion.
   It uses the annual surge in holiday air travel to illustrate
what it says are the limits of the current aviation infrastructure
to handle higher volumes of passengers predicted as a daily
occurrence a decade from now.

   Police use tear gas and buckshot to
rout demonstrators who attacked legislators minutes after the
National Assembly passed a law Friday allowing firing of public
workers who back a coup.
   Unofficial reports said three legislators were among at least 10
people injured, none seriously.
   Hundreds of enraged government employees set upon lawmakers with
rocks and clubs as the legislators were leaving the National
Assembly after the vote.
   Police fired buckshot and tear gas canisters that forced the
demonstrators to retreat from barricades they had thrown up in
downtown Panama City.
   The law followed a Dec. 5 coup attempt led by a Noriega ally,
former Col. Eduardo Herrera, and is retroactive to Dec. 4, the day
before the attempt.
   Friday's clash was the second in less than 24 hours. Many
merchants in the area had shuttered their businesses and posted
armed guards.
   Many said they feared the kind of looting they suffered last
year when U.S. troops invaded and deposed Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   Riot police and protesters clashed for more than two hours
Thursday night in an earlier demonstration against the legislation.
   The government says manyThe choice of Martin to replace Elizabeth Dole,
who resigned to
head the American Red Cross, will assure the continuing presence of
at least one woman in Bush's Cabinet.
   Another congresswoman defeated in an effort to unseat a
Democratic senator, Patricia Saiki of Hawaii, is considered a
frontrunner for the top position at the Education Department, where
Lauro Cavazos was forced to resign this week.
   Bush called Martin, 51, a ``distinguished public servant and
cherished friend.'' The president was scheduled to meet with Martin
at the White House on Monday.
   The announcement got a somewhat chillier reception from labor
leaders. Lane Kirkland, president of the 14.2 million-member
AFL-CIO, said that during her 10-year tenure in Congress her voting
record ``has not reflected a sensitivity to the needs of workers.''
   Bush's announcement, made hastily before he boarded a helicopter
for Camp David, Md., appeared designed to end a week of turmoil
within the administration on a positive note.
   Cavazos resigned Wednesday - after being told to leave by White
House Chief of Staff John Sununu, according to administration
sources. And Bush's choice as the new Republican Party chairman,
William Bennett, bowed out Thursday when he found out how
drastically new ethics rules would limit his outside income.
   Martin, in Illinois on Friday, was informed only an hour ahead
of the formal announcement that she had landed the job, an
administration source said. Martin declined to be interviewed, but
issued a brief statement saying her nomination was ``a high
honor.''
   ``I look forward to appearing before the Senate for the upcoming
confirmation hearings,'' she said, thanking Bush for his
``confidence and support.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., whose Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee will hold Martin's confirmation hearings,
commended her on her nomination. He said the department needs
someone who could ``stand up for hard-pressed families against the
constant pro-business tilt of the White House.''
   In making his announcement, Bush said Martin had served as an
``unofficial adviser'' to him on legislative matters in the past.
   She backed him in his first presidential bid in 1980, helped him
prepare for his vice presidential debate with Democrat Geraldine
Ferraro in 1984 and was a national co-chairman of his presidential
campaign two years ago.
   It was also apparent that Bush felt he owed her something for
her party loyalty in giving up a safe House seat to make the uphill
bid against Sen. Paul Simon. She had been passed over in Bush's
first round of Cabinet appointments after the 1988 election, partly
because of her own interest in the Senate.
   ``She's a mother who knows the need for child care. She's a
professional who understands the business-labor relationship. And,
as a congresswoman, she spent years dealing with the concerns and
aspirations of the working Americans from every walk of life,''
Bush said.
   Rep. Saiki had also been considered in the running for the labor
post, as well as for the education slot.
   Martin and Saiki were seen as likely nominees for several
reasons, political analysts said. They are women; they are seen as
being owed something because they gave up House seats with Bush's
encouragement to make the Senate bids; and, as Capitol veterans,
they could help him push administration policy in Congress.
   In addition, Saiki, an Asian-American, would add a minority
member to a Cabinet that lost Cavazos, a Hispanic-American.
   Besides the Cabinet openings before Bush this week, the
high-profile job of RNC chairman was added to the equation when
Bennett, the former drug policy director, said he'd changed his
mind about taking the job.
   Three Cabinet secretaries are among those frequently mentioned
as contenders for the RNC post - Samuel Skinner of Transportation,
Robert Mosbacher of Commerce and Jack Kemp of Housing and Urban
Development - along with former Rep. Thomas Loeffler of Texas and
longtime Bush campaign strategist Rich Bond.
   If Skinner, Mosbacher or Kemp took the job, that would give Bush
yet another Cabinet opening to fill.
   Besides Saiki, those also considered potential choices for
education secretary include Lynne Cheney, chairwoman of the
National Endowment for the Humanities; former New Jersey Gov.
Thomas Kean, now president of Drew University, and former Tennessee
Gov. Lamar Alexander, now president of the University of Tennessee.
Cheney, the wife of Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, has also been
mentioned as a candidate for the Labor post.
   Martin has never had a close alliance with organized labor.
According to the AFL-CIO's scorecard, she voted ``right'' on
workers' issues 29 percent of the time.
   When Bush tapped Mrs. Dole for the labor post two years ago, his
action was seen as a way for Republicans to mend fences with
organized labor leaders who had had a hostile relationship with the
Reagan administration.
   Analysts say more Cabinet changes might follow soon. Kemp,
Skinner and Mosbacher are all said to be itchy, as well as Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh.

<TEXT>
   The United States and the Soviet Union have agreed
to destroy their remaining stocks of live smallpox virus by the end
of 1993, the World Health Organization said Friday.
   The nations held the virus stocks, frozen in top security labs,
for possible use in biological warfare. WHO announced the world was
free of smallpox in October 1979. No case of the disease has been
confirmed since.
   U.S. and Soviet officials at a three-day meeting confirmed their
countries have stopped vaccinating soldiers against smallpox, a WHO
statement said.
   The 11-member WHO smallpox committee agreed all stocks of the
virus must be destroyed by Dec. 31, 1993. The agency said this will
end fears of accidental infection or intentional misuse.
   Smallpox, a highly contagious and sometimes fatal disease,
causes high fever and skin eruptions.
   U.S. and Soviet scientists, meanwhile, will record genetic
characteristics of various virus strains so research can continue,
WHO said.
   U.S. stocks are at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
The Soviets keep theirs at Moscow's Research Institute for Viral
Preparations.
   The CDC also holds stocks donated by Japan, the Netherlands and
Britain, WHO said.
   The WHO committee urged all countries to end smallpox
vaccination of soldiers, citing unconfirmed reports that one or two
countries still do so. WHO officials declined to identify the
countries.

<HEAD>Libyans Newly Linked to Terrorist Attack on Pan Am Flight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A detonator fragment from the bomb that brought
down Pan Am Flight 103 links Libya to the 1988 attack that killed
270 people, a newspaper reported Friday.
   The report quoted unidentified senior sources as saying
indictments have been held up because any U.S. action against Libya
would risk alienating Arab members of the multinational force
against Iraq in the Persian Gulf.
   In its report, The Independent said the evidence came to light
three months ago and is based on a detonator fragment found in a
field close to the southern Scottish town of Lockerbie. The plane
blew up over that town.
   The fragment matched a detonator found in a radio-cassette bomb
seized from two Libyan agents at Dakar airport in Senegal in
February 1988, 10 months before the Flight 103 attack, the
newspaper reported. The two men were later released by Senegalese
authorities.
   Investigators have said the bomb that exploded on the Pan Am
plane was also hidden in a radio-cassette recorder.
   Reports of possible Libyan involvement have appeared recently in
the French and U.S. media. But the paper said it is the first time
that senior sources confirmed that proof exists ``implicating Col.
Moammar Gadhafi's regime.''
   It quoted one of the sources as saying: ``Not only do we now
know Gadhafi was responsible, he also knows we know.''
   Some previous reports speculated the bombing was planned by a
German-based cell of the radical Syria-based Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command, headed by Ahmed Jibril.
The bomb was reportedly made with Semtex, a Czechoslovak explosive.
   Terrorist experts and Western news reports have theorized that
Jibril's organization was hired by Iran to avenge the deaths of 290
people aboard an Iran Air jetliner accidentally shot down by the
U.S. Navy in July 1988.
   Jibril, a former Syrian army officer, has denied involvement in
the Pan Am attack.
   Scottish police have also said that they were investigating
Mohammed Abu Talb, who was convicted in Sweden of carrying out
several attacks against American and Israeli targets in 1985 and
1986.
   In a separate story, The Independent suggested Libya may have
masterminded the Pan Am attack to seek revenge for the U.S. air
strike on the Libyan capital of Tripoli in 1986. There were some
U.S. servicemen aboard the Pan Am flight.
   Unidentified sources cited by The Independent said both the
Senegal device and the fragment found near Lockerbie were from the
same Swiss manufacturer.
   A spokesman for Scotland's senior law officer, the Lord
Advocate, declined to comment on what he called ``media
speculation.'' He said ``indictments are not being drawn up'' at
this time.
   The plane was blown up over Lockerbie on Dec. 21, 1988, while on
its way to New York. All 259 people on board and 11 others on the
ground were killed. The flight originated in Frankfurt, Germany,
with a stop at London's Heathrow airport.

<HEAD>Arrested Ukrainian Lawmaker Ends Hunger Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Ukrainian legislator who was arrested for
allegedly assaulting a KGB agent has ended a political hunger
strike after 13 days, according to news reports.
   The legislator, Stepan Khmara, has become focus for
anti-government protests in the Ukraine ever since his arrest on
Nov. 17. Demonstrators at a human rights rally in Moscow on Dec. 8
demanded his release from prison, and his case has been championed
by nationalist groups in the Ukraine.
   Keston College in Britain, which monitors religious affairs in
the Soviet Union, reported Khmara was in critical condition and
being treated by doctors after ending his hunger strike Thursday.
The Tass news agency on Friday also reported he had ended the
hunger strike.
   According to Keston College, Khmara's arrest stemmed from an
incident Nov. 7 when he stopped to help a woman who said she had
been attacked by a man near a Kiev underpass. Khmara asked the man
who he was and the man didn't reply, although he later turned out
to be KGB Col. Igor Grigoriev.
   Ukrainian prosecutors allege Khmara beat and robbed Grigoriev,
who reportedly still is hospitalized, and the Communist majority in
the Ukrainian parliament voted to deprive Khmara of his
parliamentary immunity from prosecution, Tass said.
   Khmara was charged with ``abusing the authority of his office,''
according to Keston College, and he began the hunger strike Nov. 26
in Lukianivka Prison to protest his arrest.
   Parliamentary opposition groups, including the nationalist group
Rukh, began picketing the prison where Khmara was incarcerated,
Tass reported.
   Khmara, who has been active in the struggle for the legalization
of the Greek-Catholic church in the Soviet Union, called off his
hunger strike at the request of a clergyman, Vlodimir Sterniuk,
according to Keston College. The legislator reportedly was moved
from the prison infirmary to the General Military Hospital.
   Tass did not report on his condition Friday.

<BYLINE>By GWEN ACKERMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Friday
proposed regional talks on water sharing and disarmament. He also
indicated Israel is ready to discuss dismantling the nuclear
weapons it reportedly possesses.
   His proposals reflect growing worry over conflicting reports of
Iraq's nuclear capability and a drought that is draining water
reserves in the Mideast.
   Shamir spoke on Israel television on his return from talks with
President Bush in Washington.
   ``I would like to add to the agenda of the peace talks today a
discussion of regional ideas ... to start with solving regional
problems that are important to all countries in the region, like
the water problem.''
   ``It is conceivable that we will also have to find a way to add
to these talks the very heavy subject that has been discussed a lot
recently and that is reducing the amount of weapons in the
region,'' he added on Israel television.
   When asked if Israel was ready to dismantle nonconventional
weapons, Shamir answered: ``I said that Israel is ready to
participate in such an effort that would reduce the amount of
weaponry and that would limit weapons.''
   Shamir added that in his term as foreign minister 10 years ago
he had advocated and presented ``a concrete proposal for a region
free of nuclear weapons.''
   Israel has repeatedly refused to respond to foreign reports it
has about 100 nuclear bombs, giving it the world's sixth-largest
nuclear stockpile. However, officials have said that Israel would
not be the first to use atomic weapons in the Middle East.
   Shamir's proposals came amidst concerns the United States will
support calls in the United Nations for a broad Middle East peace
conference to deal with the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Such a move would be a radical departure from the U.S. position
supporting Israel's proposal for Israeli-Palestinian talks on
limited autonomy for the residents of the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip. Israel opposes an international conference.
   The Israeli initiative has been in deadlock since it led to the
fall of a broad coalition government in March 1988.
   Shamir, who now leads a right-wing coalition, has said peace
with Arab neighbors must come before any settlement with the
Palestinians.
   Shamir made his proposals Friday in the wake of recent reports
that Iraq is on a crash program to become the first Arab state with
nuclear weapons.
   Experts differ on how close the Iraqi arsenal is to being ready.
Some say Iraq will be able to build a usable bomb within five
years. Others say it will take 10 years.
   In proposing the focus on water, Shamir is reacting to
statements by experts who say the region will face dangerous
depletion of its water sources by 1995.
   Israel has depleted all its reserves and may have to resort to
importing water if there is another drought year. Syria and Jordan
already ration water, and some areas get water only a few times a
week. Egypt also faces severe problems as its population
multiplies.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki,
trounced in last month's presidential election, left office on
Friday by telling Parliament he had tried not to raise national
expectations beyond what could be attained.
   ``This government's role was to make this painful beginning,''
Mazowiecki said in an address ending his 15-month term as the
former East bloc's first non-Communist leader.
   ``We did not try to arouse hopes which could not be fulfilled,''
Mazowiecki told Parliament, in apparent response to criticism by
President-elect Lech Walesa and others that his government had
moved too slowly toward economic and social reforms.
   Parliament then voted 224-16 to accept his resignation. There
were 122 abstentions.
   Meanwhile, an aide to Walesa said the president-elect had
resolved the ``main problems'' in negotiations to select a new
prime minister. The aide did not disclose the makeup of the Walesa
government.
   Mazowiecki was beaten Nov. 25 in the first round of Poland's
first popular presidential election by Stanislaw Tyminski, an
unknown emigre promising an economic quick fix. Walesa on Dec. 9
defeated Tyminski by a wide margin.
   Mazowiecki submitted his government's resignation two days after
the first-round vote, but agreed to stay on in a caretaker capacity
until Parliament accepts Walesa's new government, a process
expected to take a few weeks.
   Surrounded by his Cabinet, the prime minister somberly accepted
a standing ovation following the vote.
   Mazowiecki cited the disappearance of store lines, the improved
selection of consumer goods, the stabilization of the currency and
development of a private sector as ``signs of permanent changes''
made in Poland during his tenure.
   He also listed the establishment of an uncensored press, freely
elected local governments, a permanent border with united Germany
and a democratic political system as among his government's
accomplishments.
   ``We are building a democratic system, and we all have to
respect democratic rules,'' Mazowiecki said. But this peaceful
transition ``is testimony to how far along the road Poland has
moved from a totalitarian state to a democratic state.''
   He said newly emerging political factions should continue to
exist and develop, but they should not let their ``grudges'' block
the country's higher good.
   ``We face a difficult period now. In order to get through it
together, a new consensus of the main political forces is
necessary,'' he said.
   ``We underwent the transition from a centralized economy
governed by ideology with an economy that was in a state of decay,
destroyed by hyperinflation, to a rational economic system, where
there is the basis of competitive market and a market balance,'' he
said.
   After Mazowiecki's speech, the leader of the Solidarity caucus,
Walesa ally Mieczyslaw Gil, said Mazowiecki's name would symbolize
``Poland's return to the family of free nations.'' But he said more
should have been done to help farmers and fight unemployment.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Haitians expressed hope Friday that
the presence of hundreds of foreign observers during this weekend's
national elections would ensure their right to vote.
   The capital city was peaceful during the day that officially
ended the campaign for Sunday's vote. About 10,000 people, many
singing, attended a closing rally for the Rev. Jean-Bertrand
Aristide, a radical, populist priest believed to be the
front-runner among 11 presidential candidates.
   Police moved through the crowd, searching handbags and clothing
for weapons, but there were no incidents. To the chants of
``Hallelujah!'' people carried placards reading ``Aristide Will
Save Haiti'' and sang: ``It's you we're looking for. Now ... we are
saved.''
   Aristide, carrying poinsettias, was mobbed by a throng of
screaming fans before he briefly addressed the crowd.
   ``We are the flowers of brotherhood,'' the Roman Catholic leader
said. ``We are carrying the flowers to victory.''
   Haiti has been ruled by dictators virtually since it won
independence from France in 1804 and established the world's first
black republic. Two elections held the past four years have been
rigged or halted because of violence.
   But many Haitians said Friday they believed foreign observers
would make a difference this time.
   ``Even if 100 people get killed, the election will go on,'' said
Jean-Claude Bajeux, a civil rights activist who spent many years in
exile during the Duvalier family dictatorship.
   About 3 million people are registered to vote for president,
bicameral legislature, mayors and county officials. The government
has set up 14,500 polling places, and they will be open from 6 a.m.
to 6 p.m. Sunday.
   The elections gained new vigor a month ago when Aristide
declared his candidacy. He is the favorite of the poor who make up
most of this Caribbean nation's 6 million residents.
   An advocate of liberation theology, or church involvement in the
struggles of the poor, Aristide was expelled from the Salesian
order in 1988 for allegedly fomenting revolution.
   He remains a priest, however, and has said he would renounce the
priesthood to comply with Vatican rules against holding public
office if he wins the election.
   Marc Bazin, a former World Bank economist and finance minister
fired by the dictatorial Duvalier regime for investigating
corruption, is believed to be the favorite of the middle class. He
has a considerable following in the countryside.
   Bazin campaigned Friday in the mountain town of Tomassin,
overlooking the wealthy suburb of Petionville.
   ``People like me, a working man, will vote for Aristide because
he stands for change,'' said a street vendor who would only give
his first name, Antoine. ``The bourgeoise will vote for Bazin.''
   Election observers from the United Nations, Organization of
American States and the Caribbean Economic Community will monitor
the vote.
   Former President Jimmy Carter, who has monitored elections in
Panama and Nicaragua, arrived Friday afternoon with a team of 34
observers from the Council of Freely Elected Heads of Government.
   President Bush sent former Gov. William Janklow of South Dakota
as head of an eight-member U.S. government delegation.
   ``The election in Haiti offers a historic opportunity for the
Haitian people to freely choose their leaders after decades of
dictatorship,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   A State Department spokesman appealed for Haitians to shun
violence in the final days of the campaign. ``The United States
supports Haiti's electoral process and encourages all Haitians to
conduct the final days of the campaign in a peaceful atmosphere,''
said spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler in Washington.
   At the request of the interim government of President
Ertha-Pascal Trouillot, the United Nations sent 64 unarmed military
advisers to work with Haiti's notoriously ill-disciplined army to
prevent election violence.
   Until 1986, the Duvalier family enforced its rule for 29 years
with the help of a brutal private militia known as the Tonton
Macoutes.
   The dictatorship ended in 1986 after Jean-Claude Duvalier fled
to exile in France.
   Many holdovers from the Duvalier regime have remained intent on
keeping their hold on power and have sabotaged elections twice
since Jean-Claude was deposed.
   The elections in 1987 were aborted after army-backed thugs
massacred 34 voters at the polls. The army dissolved the
independent Electoral Council and held rigged elections in 1988.
   There has been relatively little violence during this year's
campaign.
   Fears of a bloody election were heightened on Dec. 5 when
unidentified assailants threw a grenade and opened fire on people
leaving an Aristide rally, killing seven and wounding more than 50
others.
   Aristide blamed the attack on Roger Lafontant, self-proclaimed
chief of the Tonton Macoutes and avid Duvalier supporter, and
demanded his arrest. Lafontant denied his involvement.
   Lafontant returned from exile to run for president, but was
disqualified on technicalities by the Electoral Council.
   He said this week he was the head of the Tonton Macoutes and the
Duvalierist movement, and that he was determined to keep Aristide
from becoming president.

   Nearly 50 jubilant Westerners
who had been trapped in Iraq and Kuwait touched down on American
soil Friday, led by the U.S. diplomats who had refused to leave
without them.
   First to bound off the plane was Nathaniel Howell, the
ambassador to Kuwait, who had spent more than three months in the
besieged U.S. embassy.
   ``It's great to be home,'' Howell declared. ``I'm delighted to
bring home with me the last planeload of Americans who want to
leave Kuwait.''
   The group was greeted in the biting December wind by Secretary
of State James A. Baker III, who saluted them for being
``victorious over an uncivilized and brutal ordeal.''
   But Baker added: ``While your ordeal has ended, that of the
Kuwaiti people continues. As you were freed, now too we must see
Kuwait freed of Iraqi occupation.''
   The hostages were welcomed by a crowd of cheering friends and
family members waving flags and bearing balloons. A young woman
wearing a ``Free Kuwait'' sweatshirt handed out red roses.
   The hostages were whisked off to a private reception area where
they were to be helped with emergency loans, plane tickets and
accommodations.
   Only one, Wayne Cox, 40, of Orlando, Fla., would talk with
reporters. He had been hiding in Kuwait with his wife, Layla, and
their three children.
   Cox praised President Bush's policies and advocated military
action to liberate Kuwait.
   ``It can't go on much longer,'' he said. ``It's just devastated.
Cars are completely stripped everywhere, houses burned, stores
burned.''
   Howell noted that he had left the flag flying when he left the
U.S. embassy in Kuwait, and he vowed it would reopen in time - with
new staff.
   ``The ordeal of the Kuwaitis ... still persists. The people
there must be freed,'' he said.
   Baker said Iraq's Saddam Hussein deserved no reward for his
release of the hostages.
   ``There must be no thanks or praise for the release of innocent
people who he never should have kidnapped in the first place,''
Baker said.
   He said Saddam's aggression and the ordeal of the hostages
``jars our sense of human decency and civility.''
   Howell and the four remaining members of his bare-bones embassy
staff left Iraq on Thursday on what was expected to be the last
U.S. charter flight to evacuate Westerners from Iraq and occupied
Kuwait.
   After an overnight stop in Frankfurt, Germany, many of the
hostages were flown to Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington
aboard a C-5 military transport plane.
   The passengers included 23 Americans, 10 non-U.S. citizen family
members, as well as 15 people going to Canada, officials said.
   Howell, 50, had been winding up a three-year stint in Kuwait and
was preparing to leave when Iraq invaded the emirate on Aug. 2.
Shortly thereafter, Saddam ordered the closure of all foreign
missions in Kuwait and cut off services to those embassies that
defied him.
   Howell and others on the embassy staff held our for more than
three months, living mainly on rice, tuna and boiled water from the
embassy swimming pool.
   The diplomats left only after they were satisfied that all
Americans in Kuwait had been given a chance to leave.
   Hundreds of Western hostages have departed Iraq and Kuwait since
Saddam last week agreed to let them go. Any remaining Americans who
wish to leave can take commercial flights, according to the State
Department.

   A suspicious fire fanned by high wind sped
through a crowded neighborhood Friday, damaging 11 three-family
houses and leaving more than 100 people homeless, many of them
needy immigrants, authorities said.
   Emergency officials who went to evacuate residents said they had
trouble communicating the urgency of the problem to people who did
not speak English.
   ``They were just reluctant to leave. They didn't realize the
scope of what was going on,'' said Deputy Fire Chief Dan Doherty.
   No deaths or serious injuries were reported. Seven firefighters
from Revere, Boston and Chelsea suffered smoke inhalation or other
injuries. Three civilians were treated for minor injuries, police
said.
   Mayor George Colella declared an emergency in the working-class
suburb north of Boston and said 125 to 160 residents were displaced
by the blaze. The Red Cross said it helped 132 people displaced by
the early morning fire.
   Vin Ven, 25, who is three months pregnant, escaped with her
father, mother, sister and brother, all of whom came here from
Cambodia in recent years. ``Now it is burned, my place. Now I got
no place to live,'' she said.
   Fire Chief James Connery declared the blaze a conflagration, the
highest level of fire, and said it was the worst he had seen in his
35 years with the department. ``When you declare a conflagration,
mutual aid automatically takes over,'' he said.
   All fire equipment in the Boston metropolitan area was made
available to Revere, and at least 17 departments sent firefighters.
   The fire began in a vacant, boarded-up building. Connery said it
may have been set, along with two of three other fires reported
earlier in the night.
   ``We're leaning very strongly that way,'' he said. ``I can't
tell definitely that they were deliberately set, but it certainly
looks that way. There were too many fires in too short a time.''
   Arson investigators were called in and a dog was brought in that
can sniff out chemicals used to start or feed a fire. And police
looked for a white car seen near three of the homes that burned.
   Temperatures in the 20s and wind blowing to 30 mph created a
wind chill factor of near zero and ice covered the streets before
the blaze was declared under control after four hours. Some fire
engines were encased in ice.
   ``The only thing that really helped us was that the wind died
down,'' Doherty said. ``That kind of gave us a little chance.''
   The neighborhood, one of the most densely packed in Revere, is
made up mostly of Asian, Hispanic and Portuguese residents.
   Janice Foley escaped her home with her four children and
disabled husband after trying to hose down porches to keep sparks
from igniting her second-floor apartment.
   ``The flames and sparks came across the street,'' Foley said.
``We ran outside and had to go onto the sidewalk, then everything
started dropping through.''
   Foley said she lost everything, including Christmas presents for
her family and presents for 19 Head Start children she supervises.
   The houses are called triple-deckers, a style common in the
Boston area that was developed in the early part of the century to
accommodate burgeoning city populations. Often, a family would live
on one floor and rent the two other floors.
   In addition to five homes that were destroyed, one was badly
damaged, and five others suffered either exterior damage or water
damage.
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis visited the scene, and said the state
will seek funds to help rebuild the neighborhood. Asked where the
state will get money given the current fiscal crunch, Dukakis said:
``Well, if there isn't (any), we'll get it.''
   Classes were canceled at the city high school so that those left
homeless could be served by the Red Cross in the school gym.
   ``It's challenging all year long, but it's particularly
difficult to find housing at Christmas time,'' said Amy Glick, a
Red Cross nurse. ``What we'll need to do is work with each family
on a case by case basis.''

   Beleaguered Eastern Airlines continued as
recently as last month to falsify vital safety and maintenance
records, according to a confidential informat cited in a
government document unsealed Friday.
   Eastern angrily denied the allegations contained in the
document, which is an affidavit to support a raid earlier this
month on the airline's Miami headquarters.
   The document details a lengthy pattern of doctoring safety logs
and other records to keep the airline's jets in the air.
   Release of the document was a public-relations setback for
Eastern, which has been operating under bankruptcy court protection
since March 1989 because of a strike that has still not been
resolved.
   Eastern said there has been no conspiracy to cut corners on
safety, as the government has alleged in a criminal case in
Brooklyn.
   The airline has continued to lose enormous amounts of money but
its court-appointed trustee, Martin R. Shugrue Jr., has predicted
Eastern will start breaking even sometime next year. Shugrue also
has been leading an aggressive publicity campaign for Eastern in
attempt to win more customers.
   In response to the latest allegations, Shugrue said the
government has a ``personal vendetta'' against him and ``a vendetta
against the company.''
   Federal investigators using a search warrant went into Eastern's
offices on Dec. 1 and carried out boxes of documents and computer
records, said U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Maloney.
   According to a confidential informant, Eastern ``supervisors are
under so much pressure to avoid delays that record falsification is
the norm,'' the affidavit said.
   Maintenance workers at Hartsfield Airport in Atlanta routinely
falsified log books to hide faulty navigation, radar and other
electronic equipment, as well as bad tires and windshields that
leaked air, informants told investigators.
   Confidential informants told investigators that ``flight delays
caused by necessary repairs or maintenance were simply not
tolerated by Eastern's upper management,'' the document said.
   One informant in Atlanta said ``he witnessed supervisors on
almost a daily basis falsifying log books to make it appear that
inoperative cockpit instruments had been repaired when in reality
they had not been repaired,'' the affidavit said.
   Last Friday, U.S. District Judge I. Leo Glasser of Brooklyn
ruled that the affidavit unsealed Friday should be made public.
However, he allowed Eastern a chance to appeal.
   The appeal went before a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of
Appeals on Thursday and it ruled in suppport on Glasser on Friday.
   In July, prosecutors in Brooklyn filed criminal charges against
Eastern, alleging a pattern of falsifying safety records and other
maintenance documents to keep its jets in the air.
   The airline and several of its top managers are scheduled to go
on trial in on the charges in Brooklyn federal court next year.
   During a Miami news conference, Shugrue accused the government
of embarking on a ``headline-hunting exercise'' to damage Eastern.
   Eastern said in a statement ``the FAA's most recent inspections
revealed that Eastern was safe and that there was no evidence to
suggest that maintenance records were being falsified.''
   The airline said that based on its own investigation of specific
allegations it was confident that a grand jury would agree ``that
the charges contained in the affidavit are without merit.''

   European Community leaders agreed Friday on a $1
billion food aid package for the Soviet Union and said it is worth
the price if it helps keep President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in power.
   The European leaders also were drafting a statement on the
Persian Gulf crisis, with Italy and France pushing to give Iraq
assurances it would not be attacked if it withdraws from Kuwait.
   The leaders approved the emergency aid package, with the
proportion of grants and loans still to be decided, at the opening
of a two-day summit that is scheduled to launch the 12-nation bloc
on a radical path toward European unity.
   ``It is not in the interests of Europe or Britain that the
Soviet Union should fall into anarchy or should lapse into the
hands of some backward-looking tyrant,'' said British Foreign
Secretary Douglas Hurd.
   For the longer term, they agreed in principle on two-year $1.4
billion package of technical assistance for 1991-92 to help the
Soviet Union in the fields of energy, transportation, distribution
and telecommunications, summit spokesman Pio Mastrobuoni said.
   Aid for the hard-pressed economies of Eastern Europe was also
under discussion, with $140 million approved for Romania and
Bulgaria, Mastrobuoni said.
   Despite Britain's continuing objections to certain aspects of
European integration, Italian officials said Britain is ready to
fully participate in two special conferences opening Saturday on
economic and monetary union and on political unity.
   ``The conferences are going ahead with all 12 aboard,'' said
Mastrobuoni. ``There are no prejudices or insurmountable obstacles
at the start.''
   The government heads are preparing broad guidelines on political
union, including the possibility that the 12 countries, at some
future date, would speak in one voice on security and foreign
policy.
   The European leaders stressed during their private talks that
the Soviet Union doesn't face famine but is hampered by an
inadequate distribution system and black market profiteers.
   ``It is no good having food rotting in a siding in Leningrad
rather than rotting in a grainstore here,'' said British Prime
Minister John Major, making his international debut since replacing
Margaret Thatcher last month.
   At the same time, Gorbachev needs breathing room to carry out
his economic reform program. But his political hold is under
constant challenge from various segments of Soviet society.
   Earlier in the week, the United States joined 20 other countries
in promising or delivering food aid.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, who has been in the forefront
of the food aid drive for the Soviets, denounced attempts in the
Soviet Union to undermine Gorbachev. He warned that a Gorbachev
fall from power would cost the world a lot more than would sending
emergency aid now.
   Because of the problems of getting food in from the countryside,
the Europeans singled out Moscow and Leningrad for the emergency
assistance.
   Italian Premier Giulio Andreotti said the EC would draw
immediately from community-held stocks and promised the Europeans
would try to make sure the supplies reached the hungry - and not
the black market.
   On the eve of the summit, President Bush urged the Europeans in
a letter to stand firm and united against Iraq as the Jan. 15
deadline set by the U.N. Security Council for possible military
action approaches.
   The Persian Gulf crisis figured to dominate discussions at a
state dinner at the Renaissance Chigi Palace Friday evening, and it
was also the focus of many of the bilateral talks.
   Italian officials said Andreotti and French President Francois
Mitterrand agreed on the need for a ``clear and explicit message''
from Europe that the U.S.-dominated multinational force would not
attack Iraq if Kuwait were liberated.
   The two countries also agreed on the need for an international
peace conference on the Middle East, and said they would welcome an
EC-wide appeal that it be held.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has tried to link a resolution of
the gulf crisis with the issue of Israel's occupation of
Palestinian territories. An international conference would deal
with such issues, but it is opposed by Israel. The United States
has rejected Saddam's attempt to link the issues.
   Major struck a noticeably more conciliatory tone than Mrs.
Thatcher, whose denunciation of plans for a single European
currency at the last summit isolated Britain and precipitated her
downfall.
   ``I don't think anybody in the community wants confrontation,''
said the 47-year-old prime minister.
   But he stressed that Britain had not changed its opposition to
the single currency and other key unity proposals.
   ``If we were to leap ahead without proper understanding of what
it (a single currency) means, it could be very serious,'' Major
said.

<HEAD>Mexican Vote Fraud Riots Ignite Political Battle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The opposition swapped charges with Mexico's
long-entrenched Institutional Revolutionary Party on Friday after a
vote fraud riot killed three people, injured scores and set off a
political frenzy.
   Foes of the party, called PRI for its Spanish initials, said 62
years of one-party rule and what it calls rigged elections have led
to frustration and violence.
   Herberto Castillo, a founder of the center-left Democratic
Revolutionary Party (PRD), cautioned Friday, ``The Mexicans are a
tiger. The government should watch out. There are lots of riot
police. But there are a lot more people.''
   The government party accused Castillo's party of ``savage
aggression.''
   A PRD rally to protest purported vote fraud in Tejupilco, a town
of about 7,000 in Mexico state, turned into a riot Wednesday after
police fired tear gas grenades into the packed town square and
shots rang out.
   Two police officers and one civilian were killed and scores of
people, including many police officers, were injured.
   The state government says armed PRD supporters tried to seize
City Hall. The PRD denies it, and says riot police provoked the
melee by attacking women standing near the City Hall entrance.
   Luis H. Alvarez, president of the conservative National Action
Party (PAN), said the violence shows democracy cannot be delayed.
He said ``the nation could find itself in immersed in chaos''
unless the PRI and the government allow clean elections, according
to news reports Friday.
   PAN and the PRD are Mexico's major opposition parties. PAN
boasts Mexico's first and only opposition governor. The PRD claims
vote fraud robbed it of victory in the 1988 presidential election.
   The president of the governing party, Luis Donaldo Colosio, said
the Tejupilco incident exposed the ``real face of the PRD:
intolerance.''
   He spoke with reporters after a heated session of Congress
Thursday.
   The PRD filed a complaint with the National Human Rights
Commission on behalf of Tejupilco citizens, claiming constitutional
rights to free speech and free assembly were violated.
   The party also announced it would hold another rally Sunday in
Tejupilco, 80 miles southwest of Mexico City.
   ``It won't be a demonstration designed to provoke violence. It
will be rally designed to defend the constitution,'' Castillo said.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari concedes he is moving more
slowly on political reform than economic reform, but says the
slower pace is necessary to prevent chaos during a time of radical
change in Mexico.

   A top Moslem cleric said Friday he wants
U.N. troops deployed to help control religious violence that has
left hundreds of people dead around India.
   Sayed Abdullah Bukhari claimed only a neutral force can protect
the Moslem minority from Hindus in the dispute over a religious
site.
   ``My heart weeps, my chest bleeds and the mind reels in
confusion when I see my people being massacred,'' Bukhari, chief
clergyman of India's 105 million Moslems, told about 20,000 people
at the Jama Masjid, India's largest mosque.
   ``There is a limit to our tolerance. Can't the United Nations
send its forces to protect the millions of Moslems of India?''
Bukhari asked.
   At least 267 people have died in Hindu-Moslem clashes in several
Indian cities the past eight days. About half the deaths have
occurred in Hyderabad, 750 miles south of New Delhi.
   The violence in at least seven cities stems from Hindu
fundamentalists' campaign to construct a temple on a site now
occupied by a mosque in Ayodhya, 300 miles east of New Delhi.
   Hindus claim the 16th century mosque was built on the ruins of a
temple destroyed by Moslem conquerers. Moslems say the mosque was
erected on a vacant plot.
   At least 380 people were killed in month-long nationwide riots
when the Ayodhya campaign began on Oct. 30.
   The conflict also helped bring down the government of former
Prime Minister V.P. Singh after a fundamentalist party withdrew
support for Singh's coalition government.
   Moslems make up 12 percent of India's 880 million people, the
world's second largest Moslem population after Indonesia. Hindus in
India account for 82 percent.
   Also Friday, Chief Minister Marri Chenna Reddy, the highest
elected official in Andhra Pradesh state, promised to resign,
saying he was ``morally responsible'' for the widespread killings
in Hyderabad. Reddy said he would step down after the party elected
a new leader, possibly Saturday.
   Bukhari accused police in Uttar Pradesh state of killing Moslem
youths and singling out Moslems for arrests.
   ``I appeal to the United Nations to save the Moslems from the
cruel and barbaric policemen,'' he said.
   Bukhari's accusation was aimed at the Provincial Armed
Constabulary, a special force of Uttar Pradesh police that Indian
human rights organizations and Moslems previously have accused of
selectively killing Moslems.
   The identities of those killed in the clashes have not been
revealed in keeping with Indian press policies, but a majority of
those killed are believed to be Moslems, according to independent
and witness reports. Indian newspaper editors say disclosure of the
victims' religion could aggravate unrest.

   A U.S. delegation was in Europe on Friday asking
foreign governments to unfreeze Manuel Noriega's bank accounts to
finance his legal defense, but Swiss officials warned their job
won't be easy.
   Most of the delegation's activities are classified, said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Sullivan, who told a federal judge
here the group consists of State and Justice department officials
visiting Austria and Switzerland.
   Other European nations also may be on the delegation's
itinerary, said U.S. attorney's office spokeswoman Diane Cossin.
She refused to identify the countries. The government has said
Noriega had accounts in France.
   Swiss officials expect to hold talks with the delegation next
week, the nation's justice ministry spokesman Joerg Kistler said in
Bern.
   But he said if there is any evidence that the accounts contain
illegal drug money, Swiss laws require confiscation.
   ``We can only unfreeze in cases where it is clear that drug
money is not involved. The Americans have to prove that to us,''
Kistler said.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler, who has pressed the
government to find a way to allow the deposed Panamanian leader to
pay his own lawyers, welcomed the U.S. delegation's efforts.
   ``I'm satisfied at this time they are making a good faith effort
to unfreeze funds for the defense,'' Hoeveler said.
   The judge closed much of a hearing Friday over the objections of
media attorneys. He explained later in open court that ``some of
the areas are legitimately classified.''
   After the December 1989 invasion of Panama and the capture of
Noriega, U.S. authorities asked European governments to freeze
about $20 million in 27 bank accounts. Hoeveler ordered $6 million
of that amount unfrozen in June, but prosecutors returned to him
last month, saying European governments had stepped in with their
own forfeiture proceedings.
   The judge warned he would hold a formal hearing to show whether
the accounts were drug-related, as the government originally
contended. Such a hearing would force the government to reveal much
of its evidence to the defense. The government responded by sending
the delegation to Europe.
   The only delegation member mentioned in open court was Myles
Malman, who is an assistant U.S. attorney and one of Noriega's
prosecutors. State Department officials refused to comment on the
delegation, and the Justice Department's Washington office did not
immediately return telephone calls from The Associated Press.
   The judge has offered the defense temporary appointments as
government-paid lawyers. But Noriega lead attorney Frank Rubino
says that arrangement would impose a maximum of $75 an hour, far
less than the $350 an hour he says is appropriate in a complex
drug-trafficking case.
   Rubino also said the defense could not be ready before June.
Hoeveler said he would set a new trial date for Noriega, although
some of his co-defendants could be tried on the planned date of
Jan. 28.
   The judge said he wanted a contempt hearing soon against Cable
News Network to determine if CNN violated a court order by airing a
taped prison telephone call between Noriega and his defense team.
   The judge subsequently lifted the ban against broadcasting the
tape, but only after warning CNN it still could face contempt
fines.
   Noriega is confined in the Metropolitan Correctional Center
outside Miami facing charges of accepting $4.6 million in bribes to
turn Panama into a way station for Colombian drug traffickers.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. initiated a meeting
between senators and thrift regulators on behalf of Charles H.
Keating Jr., a former Keating aide testified Friday in
contradiction of the Michigan Democrat's sworn statement.
   James Grogan was the first Keating insider to testify in the
Senate Ethics Committee hearings, and did so only under a grant of
limited immunity that prevents his statements from being used
against him in court.
   Riegle, A Michigan Democrat and chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, has told the panel ``I did not arrange the meeting April
2'' (1987) between the top thrift regulator and four Senate
colleagues - who were intervening for Keating's failing Lincoln
Savings and Loan. Riegle did not attend the session.
   ``Is there any doubt in your mind that Sen. Riegle arranged the
meeting with the senators?'' committee special counsel Robert S.
Bennett asked Grogan, who was Lincoln's corporate counsel.
   ``No sir,'' Grogan answered.
   The April 2 meeting is important because the top regulator at
the time, Edwin J. Gray, has testified that Sen. Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz., tried to negotiate a deal for Lincoln that would have
waived a rule prohibiting risky investments. DeConcini has denied
the allegation.
   The committee is looking into the relationships of the ``Keating
Five,'' with Keating. It wants to know whether the five - in
addition to DeConcini and Riegle, they are John Glenn, D-Ohio, Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., and John McCain, R-Ariz. - committed any
improprieties in interceeding on Keating's behalf with S&amp;L
regulators.
   Grogan said he later ``got feedback the (four) senators were
miffed'' at Riegle's absence, since negative news stories about
Lincoln's condition made the session potentially ``politically
explosive.''
   After Grogan testified all day Friday, the Ethics Committee
scheduled a Saturday session to question him further.
   Riegle's office issued a statement saying Grogan's testimony
``shows no improper activity or ethical violation by Sen. Riegle in
the Lincoln matter.'' Unspecified statements of Grogan's were
incorrect, the statement said, adding, ``This will be clear in the
days ahead.''
   Grogan also told the committee that Riegle tried to hide his
role in initiating the meeting.
   The Keating executive said Riegle asked him to invite the other
senators and to ask McCain and DeConcini, in turn, to invite Riegle
to attend.
   ``Sen. McCain reacted very negatively'' to the suggestion,
Grogan said. ``He said he would not invite Sen. Riegle to the
meeting. He was very unhappy with that concept.''
   DeConcini did write an invitation to Riegle to meet with
regulators - not for the April 2 meeting, but to a session a week
later between all five senators and the San Francisco-based
regulators who were investigating Lincoln.
   At that session, the senators were advised that criminal
referrals regarding Lincoln would be sent to the Justice
Department.
   The committee is investigating whether the five senators'
intervention for Keating was related to the $1.3 million he and
associates donated to their campaigns and favorite causes.
   Grogan denied there was a connection, testifying he ``never got
the impression'' that ``any action we were requesting would require
a contribution.''
   But he added, ``I believe senators only have so many hours in
the day and if you make a contribution you have a better chance of
getting time in front of a senator to explain your position.''
   Most of Grogan's testimony concentrated on Riegle's actions, but
he also said that Keating dealt personally with DeConcini when the
businessman saw a chance to initiate a settlement in his feud with
regulators.
   Grogan also testified that in discussions between himself,
Keating and Cranston, topics often included both fund-raising and
the senator's intervention with regulators.
   In one case in 1987, Grogan said Cranston promised to call chief
regulator M. Danny Wall the same day that Grogan delivered a
$250,000 contribution for Cranston-backed voter registration
groups.
   And in one instance in late 1986, Grogan said he was asked by
Cranston's chief fund raiser to establish a $300,000 line of credit
for the senator. The credit was established but never used.
   Grogan said the request by fund raiser Joy Jacobson came during
a phone conversation in which Grogan was expressing alarm about
proposed legislation that was damaging to Lincoln.
   He said that after a discussion about the legislation, Ms.
Jacobson ``said, `Now I want to switch gears, and I want you to
know this is totally unrelated.'''
   ``She ... asked me if it would be possible that Lincoln could
make a loan to Sen. Cranston for use in his (re-election) campaign.
   ``My interpretation was, it was a personal loan,'' Grogan said.
   Ms. Jacobson explained, Grogan said, that Cranston ``was in a
tight race, money was tight...he might have to buy TV time.''
   Grogan testified the line of credit was arranged after Lincoln
received a legal opinion that it was proper.
   Grogan said that Riegle volunteered to arrange a meeting between
senators and Gray during a visit the senator made in March 1987 to
Keating's parent company, American Continental Corp. of Phoenix.
   Keating at the time was telling every politician who would
listen that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, headed by Gray, was
treating Lincoln unfairly and leaking damaging material on the
thrift to the news media, Grogan said.
   Grogan testified Riegle volunteered that ``he knew Ed Gray,
would talk to Ed Gray ... and thought he could set up a meeting.''
   During the same visit, Grogan said, Riegle discussed with
Keating a fund-raising luncheon that Lincoln's owner was to host
March 23 for the senator at the Keating-owned Ponchartrain Hotel in
Detroit.

   A general strike called to demand higher
wages for state workers degenerated into rampaging and street
clashes Friday that injured more than 100 people - most of them
police, officials said.
   The northern city of Fez suffered the worst violence, with about
300 people reported under arrest. Reports reaching Rabat said
youthful demonstrators in Fez attacked hotels, shops, banks,
telephone centers and other property and burned buses and cars.
   The General Moroccan Workers Union, one of two unions calling
the strike, claimed up to 25 people were killed in Fez.
   The government denied any deaths. It said about 70 police were
hurt, but that an estimated 20,000 demonstrators escaped harm
because of police forbearance.
   ``At no time did (police) use their arms,'' a government
statement said.
   The second union, the Democratic Workers Confederation, said it
could not confirm the report of deaths in Fez, a city of about
500,000 people.
   In Tangier in northern Morocco, a 17-year-old boy was shot in
the stomach in a confrontation between police and strikers,
hospital sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. They
listed about 50 known injured in clashes there.
   Lesser clashes also were reported in Kenitra, north of Rabat,
and the southern city of Agadir.
   Police threw tear gas canisters to disperse young rioters in
Fez, many of them from Fez University, where pro-fundamentalist
Moslem students and progressive students have been in conflict.
   The government said youths from outside Fez ``took advantage of
the strike.''
   In Tangier, youth threw up street barricades in Beni-Makada
district as police moved in.
   The government had warned against the strike. It said it would
investigate the incidents and that Premier Azeddine Laraki would
make a statement Monday before Parliament. Thousands of workers who
took part in general strikes in 1979 and 1981 were fired or
arrested.
   The unions said the government must bear responsibility for
Friday's incidents.
   The walkout apparently hit the education sector the hardest. Up
to 60 percent of university teachers and students obeyed the strike
call, said sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. The
Education Ministry claimed that institutes and special schools were
not affected.
   Last-ditch negotiations between the government and the unions
failed on Thursday. The unions complained they received nothing but
``the traditional promises'' in response to their specific demands.
   Laraki announced salary increases and special family subsidies
on Tuesday, but gave no figures.

   A teen-age bully who tied up an 11-year-old boy
and set him on fire during a robbery was sentenced Friday to a
maximum three years in juvenile detention.
   The victim, David Opont, was burned over 50 percent of his body
in the March attack. He was released from the hospital in August.
   His 14-year-old attacker was convicted in October of attempted
murder for tying up Opont and setting him on fire. The defendant,
whose name was withheld because of his age, also was found guilty
of kidnapping, robbery and other offenses.
   Family Court Judge Joseph A. Esquirol Sr. said it was ``perhaps
one of the most horrendous events I've had to preside over in a
long judicial career.''
   The teen-ager will be held for a year in a secure juvenile
detention center and allowed no visits home, Esquirol said.
   He will be placed in a less restrictive residential center in
the second year. Court authorities will decide later where the boy
will spend his third year of detention.
   The sentence could be extended each year afterward until he is
21 if he fails to show progress in his rehabilitation, Esquirol
said.
   Before sentencing, psychiatrist Dr. Walter Flegenheimer said the
deeply troubled 14-year-old ``receives gratification from acts of
violence, from acts of rendering people helpless.''
   The personality traits, if exhibited by an adult, would be
classified as ``a sadistic personality disorder,'' Flegenheimer
testified.
   The doctor recommended that the boy be held in a restricted
setting where he could not hurt anyone else and said he would
require years of therapy to overcome his deep-seated problems.
   David was abducted on the day before his 12th birthday as he and
some friends walked to school in the East Flatbush section of
Brooklyn.
   Doctors say he is making a good recovery, though his skin is
permanently disfigured and he continues with physical and
psychiatric therapy.
   The attack shocked the city and evoked an outpouring of sympathy
and get- well messages from across the nation. While in the
hospital, David was visited by former President Reagan, the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, Bill Cosby and other celebrities.

<HEAD>Chicago Generic Drug Company Founder Sentenced in FDA Bribery Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The founder of a Chicago generic drug company
has been fined $25,000 and sentenced to three months in a halfway
house for bribing two U.S. Food and Drug Administration officials.
   U.S. District Judge John R. Hargrove suspended nine months of a
one-year term for defendant Kun Chae Bae and ordered him to perform
1,000 hours of community service while he serves three years on
probation afterward.
   Hargrove, who imposed the sentence Thursday, said it was a
compromise between the need to send a message to other drugmakers
and a reward for Bae's cooperation with federal prosecutors in a
continuing investigation of the generic drug industry.
   Bae pleaded guilty last summer to paying a $10,000 illegal
gratuity to Charles Y. Chang in return for swift approvals of My-K
generic drug applications while Chang was chief of the FDA's
generic drug review branch in Rockville.
   Bae also pleaded guilty to a gratuities charge for giving Joseph
Micelli, an official at the FDA's medical directorate in
Philadelphia, a $400 videocassette recorder, a trip to Chicago and
$500 in travel expenses. Prosecutors there said Bae bribed other
employees at the Defense Personnel Support Center in return for
their help in obtaining supply contracts for his company.
   The defendant was instrumental in Chang's conviction on
racketeering charges and was a key government witness at the
October perjury trial of Marvin Seife, former director of the FDA's
Division of Generic Drugs. Seife was convicted.
   Bae told Hargrove that he experienced hunger and poverty as a
youth in war-torn South Korea, but seized the opportunity to be
educated in the United States. He said he ``worked very hard'' to
become a success here.
   ``I had a dream to do the best I could,'' Bae said remorsefully.
``Now I am a convicted felon ... and I have to explain that to my
children and grandchildren.''
   Prosecutors Gary P. Jordan and Geoffrey R. Garinther credited
Bae with full cooperation in the probe, which has led to the
convictions of 16 FDA and generic drug officials and companies.
   Bae, who started My-K Laboratories with $1,000 in 1973 and sold
it for nearly $20 million in 1988, now owns a Chicago-area bank and
numerous rental properties and is believed to be among the richest
of the generic drug defendants.
   Defense attorneys William G. Hundley and Ann C. Tighe requested
probation for Bae. They said he has been active in community work
since he sold My-K Laboratories.
   After Bae sold the company, he gave its employees $1 million and
donated another $300,000 to their profit-sharing plan, Hundley
said.

<TEXT>
   Former Prime Minister Kaiser
Mantanzima of Transkei has been detained in connection with last
month's failed coup attempt in the black homeland, a news report
said Friday.
   Mantanzima was detained Thursday under Transkei's Public
Security Act, the independent South African Press Association
quoted homeland official Gen. Richmond Mankahla as saying. No other
details were immediately available.
   The press association said Mantanzima earlier this week asked
South Africa to send troops to his constituency, where he is chief,
and remove it from Transkei control.
   In the Nov. 22 uprising against the military government of Maj.
Gen. Bantu Holomisa, 11 rebels and seven loyalist soldiers were
killed, including coup leader Col. Craig Duli.
   Holomisa accused South Africa of complicity. South Africa's
white-dominated government denied the charge.
   Transkei is one of four black homelands granted nominal
independence by South Africa. No other country recognizes their
sovereignty. Six other homelands are part of South Africa.
   The Pretoria leadership set up the homelands in the 1970s and
1980s as part of a plan to create separate states for blacks.
   Transkei, made up of three separate enclaves in southeastern
South Africa, has about 2.75 million residents.
   Mantanzima was the first prime minister after independence in
1976, serving until 1979. His brother George succeeded him and was
ousted by Holomisa in a 1987 coup.

<HEAD>Defendant in Mail Bombings Convicted in Unrelated Trial of Blocking
Justice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUNSWICK, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man accused of two fatal mail bombings
was convicted Friday of obstructing justice when he paid witnesses
to lie in court in an unrelated bomb possession case.
   A federal jury found Walter Leroy Moody Jr. guilty of all 13
charges against him in a five-day trial.
   Moody, 56, faces trial in mail bombings in Georgia and Alabama
last year that killed a federal judge and a city councilman.
   The jury convicted Moody of conspiracy, obstructing justice and
obstructing a criminal investigation, inducing someone else to
commit perjury, bribing a witness and witness tampering.
   Moody was expected to be sentenced in 60 days. He could receive
69 years in prison and nearly $2.3 million in fines.
   The trial hinged on the testimony of two women who said Moody
paid them to lie in court when he appealed a 1972 bomb possession
conviction. Moody had concocted a story and paid the women to back
it up. The appeal failed.
   A third woman also testified that Moody had paid her to lie at
his 1983 trial in Florida for attempted murder. That case ended in
a mistrial.
   The women had been indicted with Moody but were granted immunity
in exchange for their testimony against him.
   Prosecutor Louis Freeh urged jurors not to believe Moody's
claims that he was manipulated by the female witnesses.
   ``I'm saying he's a fake - he is a sham,'' Freeh said.
   Defense lawyer Ed Tolley argued that the evidence showed Moody
did not know what he was doing. ``He left a trail a child could
follow,'' he said.
   Also Friday, Judge Anthony Alaimo acceded to Moody's request to
exclude a possible verdict of guilty but mentally ill.
   After his attorney spent most of Thursday building an insanity
defense, Moody stood up and told the judge he objected. A finding
of insanity could have put Moody in a psychiatric institution and
he didn't want to risk that, his lawyer said.
   The recent trial was unrelated to the 70-count indictment
against Moody charging him with sending two deadly mail bombs.
   The December 1989 mail bombs killed 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals Judge Robert Vance in Alabama and Savannah attorney and
City Council member Robert Robinson. No trial date has been set.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says China Will Expand Privately Run Markets</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The official newspaper China Daily, acknowledging
the importance of private enterprise, said Friday that China plans
to increase the number of its free markets by more than 10 percent
in the next five years.
   The announcement reflects a shift in public pronouncements since
last year, when private vendors came under strong criticism. The
economy remains largely controlled by the Communist government.
   However, China Daily noted Friday a growing reliance on free
markets, which chiefly sell food, clothing and furniture. It said
the number of free markets will increase by more than 10 percent by
1995.
   The newspaper said unofficial statistics show China's urban
residents now buy 60 percent to 70 percent of their vegetables and
non-staple food from free markets. Farmers sell about half their
products at the markets, it said.
   Chinese buy staple foods at state-run stores, where they use
ration coupons that let them make purchases at a discount. They
turn to free markets to supplement food supplies and buy items
unavailable from state outlets.
   ``Since free markets reappeared in China 11 years ago, they have
been playing an increasingly important role in the daily lives of
urban and rural residents,'' China Daily said.
   After the government's violent crackdown on the pro-democracy
movement in June 1989, private enterprises were targets in
wide-ranging attacks on capitalism. State-run media carried reports
rebuking private businessmen, accusing them of making too much
money and of tax evasion.
   Official regulations still prohibit the free markets from
selling most raw materials and many consumer items, including
tobacco, liquor and cotton.
   The State Administration for Industry and Commerce said 72,130
free markets now operate in China. According to government
statistics, 4.8 percent of the enterprises in China are privately
owned.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors Friday unsealed two
indictments against a Bolivian immigrant reputed to rival leaders
of the Colombian cocaine cartels.
   Julius C. Beretta, DEA special agent in San Diego, described
Jorge Roca Suarez as ``one of the most significant cocaine
traffickers in the United States, on par with Medellin or Cali
cartel leaders.''
   Roca, his wife, Cirila Roca, his sisters, Beatriz Roca Torres
and Vilma Roca, and two others were brought to federal court
Friday, but their arraignments were postponed while they hire
lawyers.
   Roca's mother, Blanca Suarez, was also charged with
participating in the money laundering and cocaine conspiracy
charged in indictments unsealed in Los Angeles and San Diego.
   The indictments depicted a family style drug cartel in which
Roca's sisters, brothers, cousins and in-laws were key operatives,
shuttling shipments of cocaine and money between countries.
   They also alleged that threats, murder and kidnappings were
methods used by Roca, a resident immigrant, to protect his vast
cocaine cartel.
   Sometimes, the indictments indicated, piles of cash were stuffed
into refrigerators, vacuum cleaners and other appliances for
shipment to Bolivia.
   Roca was arrested Thursday at his 19-room San Marino estate. His
wife and the four others were arrested nearby. Another 17
defendants were being sought.
   The 12-count indictment unsealed in Los Angeles charges the
defendants with an array of tax evasion, money laundering and fraud
offenses involving export of millions of dollars.
   Federal authorities in San Diego simultaneously unsealed an
18-count indictment there charging Roca, a sister, his mother and
17 others with cocaine smuggling, conspiracy and related crimes.
   The U.S. Attorney's office said Roca is the nephew of Roberto
Gomez Suarez, once described as the ``cocaine king of Bolivia.''
Gomez is jailed in Bolivia and is a fugitive from U.S. federal drug
trafficking charges.
   In a press release, U.S. Attorney Lourdes Baird said that Roca
broke away from his uncle's operation and launched his own cocaine
trafficking and money laundering organization which operates in
Bolivia, Panama, Mexico and the United States.
   She said Roca directed a cadre of lieutenants, mostly family
members, who helped control all aspects of the Bolivian cocaine
trade.
   DEA officials said Roca allegedly undercut his uncle by selling
cocaine paste at lower prices. He reputedly is the most powerful
figure in Bolivia's coca trade, arranging cocaine shipments to U.S.
and European markets, the officials alleged.
   Roca was charged with evading over $1 million in federal income
taxes.
   In addition to the 38-year-old Roca, his wife, mother and
sisters, those indicted in Los Angeles included Emilio Diaz, Robert
Carillo and Antonia Carillo.
   The federal government also filed 15 civil lawsuits in federal
court seeking forfeiture of $8 million worth of property said to
have been purchased with drug proceeds.

   Twelve people who died at a religious
ceremony were the victims of accidental carbon monoxide poisoning,
the state government said Friday.
   ``They fell asleep thinking they were in a trance,'' said Baja
California state spokeswoman Sara Yolanda Gonzalez.
   Autopsies completed Friday on the 12 men, women and children
whose bodies were discovered Thursday showed they died from carbon
monoxide, a state government news release said.
   ``It was definitely an accident,'' said Victor Vazquez, a deputy
district attorney in Tijuana.
   ``They had no electricity, only a (butane) gas lamp. It consumed
all their oxygen, and they had no windows open,'' Gonzalez said.
   She said the deaths were not related to the religious ceremony
that brought the people together at the home in the U.S.-Mexico
border city of Tijuana on Wednesday night.
   ``They had an altar to the Virgin of Guadalupe, candles and holy
water, and they chanted The Lord's Prayer,'' Gonzalez said.
   A team of investigators discarded notions that the worshippers
were followers of the devil, the state news release said.
   Five people who survived the religious meeting remained
hospitalized Friday, all in comas. The state had said Thursday that
seven people were hospitalized, but revised the figure to five on
Friday, saying the earlier number was an error.
   Brain tissues from the dead victims have been sent to a San
Diego laboratory across the border from Tijuana for additional
study.
   Baja California Gov. Ernesto Ruffo on Friday ordered an
investigation of the circumstances that might have contributed to
the deaths, Gonzalez said.
   Tijuana state judicial police commander Jaime Sam Fierro said
Wednesday the group practiced spiritualism, which many Christians
in Mexico engage in and involves passing into trance-like states to
consult with spirits of the dead.
   Earlier Friday, a survivor described the ritual as a
purification ceremony conducted with a cardboard likeness of the
Virgin Mary and a rope tied with 13 knots.
   ``People started complaining of stomach pains and some of them
began to vomit,'' said Alfredo Osuna Hernandez from his hospital
bed. ``Some of them started to get scared and they started to
scream from the pain.''
   Authorities found the bodies Thursday sprawled on couches,
chairs and the floor of a home in El Florido, a shantytown filled
with squatter camps.
   Some of the dead were piled on top of others. Police said the
victims' faces were wrinkled in pain, their skin a purplish hue.
Three victims were children.
   The windows of the two-bedroom house were boarded up Friday and
two police officers stood outside to keep several hundred onlookers
away.
   The leader of the ritual, Federico Padres Mejia, was described
by neighbors as a recluse. He and his wife regularly had visitors.
Neighbors heard chanting and praying coming from the house
Wednesday night.
   ``I heard them praying real loud,'' said 10-year-old Ricardo
Mendez, who lives next door. ``They would say, `Help me, please
help me.' The children were crying, the women were moaning and the
old man (Padres) was saying, `Come to me, God, come to me, please
help us.' ''
   A neighbor said the couple moved into the neighborhood in July
and built a home that looks elegant compared to the cardboard and
particle-board shanties that stand nearby.
   Padres, 62, along with Consuelo Ponce, 35, and Juan Jose
Sarabia, 49, were comatose Friday. Ana Osuna, 8 months, was in
intensive care on a respirator, and Osuna Hernandez, 22, was in
critical condition.
   Earlier, Dr. Humberto Ariel Perez Munoz had said suspicions
focused on a fruit punch believed to have contained industrial
alcohol that the participants shared during a religious ceremony.
   Osuna, an auto body repairman, said he attended the ceremony in
hopes of finding a job. ``I was looking for a key to a job, a key
to work,'' he said.
   Several hours after the ceremony began Wednesday night, people
fell ill.
   Osuna's sister-in-law, Margarita Ramos Saucedo, 20, was among
the first to fall to the ground. The oldest was 77 years old.
   Officers who were inside the house said a rope had been laid in
a circle on the living room floor around four or five of the
bodies. The rope had 13 knots tied in it.
   Asked why no one left to seek help, Osuna said, ``It is very
damaging to leave the circle.''

   Iraq is known more for its sand than surf, but
President Saddam Hussein can take to the seas in a private yacht
replete with gold faucets and a 100-seat lounge, a Briton who was
hiding in Kuwait said Friday.
   John Lishman, 55, said he worked with the Kuwait Shipbuilding
and Repair Yard Co., which refitted Saddam's yacht following the
Iran-Iraq war.
   ``Saddam's own apartment had a large office and bedroom. There
were 12 luxury double cabins, very luxuriously arranged. The taps
were made of gold and there was a place for a helicopter to land
and the lounge had 100 seats,'' said Lishman, who returned earlier
this week from Kuwait.
   Lishman said the yacht had been built in 1981 by Danish
shipbuilders, Helsingor Vaerft, for $19 million. The vessel was
refitted at a cost of $291,000 in August 1988, Lishman said.

<TEXT>
   A prosecutor said Friday he will not
appeal a judge's dismissal of a first-degree murder charge against
a doctor who invented a device that an Alzheimer's victim used to
kill herself.
   District Judge Gerald McNally on Thursday threw out a
first-degree murder charge against retired pathologist Dr. Jack
Kevorkian in the June 4 death of Janet Adkins of Portland, Ore. She
died after activating a machine invented by Kevorkian that sent
poison into her veins.
   The ruling doesn't let Kevorkian use the suicide device again.
   Oakland County Prosecutor Richard Thompson said the ruling left
many moral, medical, ethical and religious issues unsettled.
   ``We think Judge McNally's decision was wrong,'' he said.
``(But) these profound issues should be decided by the legislative
branch of government, that branch which is pre-eminently suited to
consider the consensus of society.''
   Thompson also said there was no guarantee the Michigan Supreme
Court or Michigan Court of Appeals would hear the case and an
appeal would drain county funds.
   ``I'm pleased that he's not going to waste further taxpayers'
money on an appeal,'' Geoffrey Fieger, one of Kevorkian's lawyers.
``And I hope he'll drop the civil case as well. I hope he decides
not to enforce morality through the prosecutor's office.''
   Thompson said the county will continue its civil case blocking
Kevorkian from using his suicide machine or helping others commit
suicide.
   Kevorkian's machine remains in police custody after prosecutors
obtained a temporary court order preventing its further use. A
civil trial to decide whether or not to make that order permanent
will resume in January, Thompson said.
   Kevorkian hooked Mrs. Adkins, 54, to his device in the back of a
van in a park in Oakland County northwest of Detroit. Adkins pushed
a button, allowing lethal drugs to drip into her system.
   Michigan has no laws against suicide or assisting in it, but the
Legislature is considering at least two bills outlawing assisted
suicide.

   ``Besides the prayers being offered by Knights for a peaceful
resolution to the Persian Gulf crisis, the rosaries and the prayer
and confession guides should provide spiritual comfort to those
serving in the armed forces,'' said Supreme Knight Virgil C.
Dechant, overseer of the Catholic family fraternal organization.
   The rosaries and guides were shipped from the organizations
headquarters in New Haven to the Military Archdiocese's office in
Washington for forwarding to the Middle East. The Archdiocese is
responsible for the pastoral care of Catholics in the armed forces.
   The Knights of Columbus has 1.5 million members around the

   Five Israeli air force officers were killed
when their light plane crashed during a freight mission, the
military command said Friday.
   It said the accident occurred Thursday night in southern Israel.
There were no survivors.
   Brig. Gen. Giora Rom, head of the air force staff, said the
plane took off in the dark in ``slightly hazy atmosphere'' and hit
the ground about two minutes later.
   Officials said the accident will be investigated.

<HEAD>NATO Says Soviet Defense Spending Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT J. WIELAARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet defense spending fell by 4
percent in 1989 and will continue to drop in real terms until at
least 1995, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization reported Friday.
   The report was the first authoritative sign that the East-West
thaw has led to reduced Soviet military spending. Earlier, NATO's
military leaders said they noticed no appreciable decline.
   Friday's report put Soviet 1989 defense outlays at between $244
billion and $266 billion, according to Moscow's official exchange
rate.
   That would be double a figure cited by Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev in May 1989. However, it is hard to reflect Soviet
defense spending in Western money because the ruble is not
convertible to other currencies and the price the Kremlin pays for
arms is well below actual production costs.
   ``Unilateral force reductions, withdrawals from Eastern Europe
and cuts in military production led to a 4 percent real decline in
expenditure in 1989,'' NATO said in an annual survey of Soviet
defense spending.
   It predicted a similar drop in 1990, adding that the Soviet
defense budget ``is likely to decline in real terms until at least
1995'' due to the end of the Cold War.
   In 1989, Moscow spent up to 17 percent of its gross domestic
product on defense, the report said. It said the NATO allies spend
an average of 4.4 percent for defense.
   The 16 NATO allies spent an aggregate total of about $470
billion on defense in 1989.
   The NATO report said the rate of decrease in Soviet defense
spending hinges on further arms control accords, a possible breakup
of the Soviet Union, and economic reforms, notably efforts to
convert military production to civilian output.
   In the 1990s, NATO said it expected the Soviets to embark on ``a
radical reduction in the size of the military-industrial complex
and a further shifting of resources to the civilian sector.''

   A scientist said Friday up to 2,500 lung
cancer deaths in Germany could be caused each year by radon, a
radioactive gas that occurs naturally underground.
   Herwig Paretzke, a scientist with the GSF Ecology and Research
Center in Munich, said inhaling the odorless radon gas could
account for ``up to 10 percent of the nearly 25,000 annual lethal
lung cases.''
   He told a cancer symposium in Bonn his conclusion was based on
preliminary studies of cancer deaths and radon levels.
   Paretzke said radon can emanate into homes from some building
materials, groundwater or directly from the earth.
   Scientists at the symposium said smoking causes between 75
percent and 80 percent of lung cancer deaths in Germany.

<TEXT>
   The 1,800 patients of a surgeon who died of
AIDS will be studied to determine their risk of contracting the
virus, officials of Johns Hopkins Hospital said Friday.
   Hospital officials urged the federal Centers for Disease Control
to expedite new policies regarding the obligations of health care
workers who have been exposed to the AIDS virus.
   The study will be conducted by the Maryland Department of Health
and Mental Hygiene, the CDC and the hospital.
   ``Considering ... that so little is known about the possible
risk of HIV transmission from health care workers to patients, we
felt this situation at Hopkins presented a rare opportunity to
assess that risk,'' said Kathleen F. Edwards, director of the
state's AIDS Administration.
   The 1,800 patients were operated on in the past six years by Dr.
Rudolph Almaraz, a breast cancer surgeon who died Nov. 16 of AIDS.
   About 400 women have notified Johns Hopkins that they are
interested in the hospital's earlier offer of AIDS testing and
counseling.
   ``Our plan is to test all the patients of Dr. Almaraz, to go
beyond those who have volunteered to what Hopkins offered. The
tests would determine whether they are infected ... and also do
case histories to determine if there are any other risk factors
involved,'' said Mike Golden, spokesman for the state health
department.
   The lack of guidelines forces hospitals to work in a ``policy
vacuum,'' said Dr. Hamilton Moses III, the hospital's vice
president of medical affairs.
   In a letter to the CDC, hospital officials outline numerous
questions it asked the CDC to clarify.
   For example, Moses said hospitals need to know at what point
should AIDS prohibit a health care worker's contact with patients
and at what point the workers should be required to admit they are
infected.
   Under Maryland law, workers have no such obligation, said Paul
Rosenberg, general counsel for the hospital.
   Moses said the CDC has been writing the guidelines since it
announced in July that a dentist in Florida who had AIDS had
infected a patient.
   Gayle Lloyd, a spokeswoman for the CDC in Atlanta, said Friday
that the guidelines may be distributed in a few weeks.
   ``We share the concerns of Johns Hopkins, and we are expediting,
and we will have our guidelines ready as soon as we can,'' Lloyd
said.
   As of Sept. 30, the CDC received reports of 24 health care
workers who have become infected with the AIDS virus on the job.
   Almaraz closed his practice in March and resigned from Hopkins
on June 30. He told his patients that he was moving to Texas to do
research, but made no mention of his health.
   Almaraz told his attorney that he contracted AIDS seven years
ago when blood from an AIDS patient squirted into his eys and
mouth during surgery at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in
New York. A Sloan-Kettering spokesman said the hospital had no
documentation of the incident.
   Johns Hospital officials said Friday they tried during the
summer to confirm rumors that Almaraz had AIDS.
   Moses said the state health department advised Johns Hopkins in
the fall that it was not obligated to notify Almaraz's patients of
the rumor. After a newspaper reported that the doctor had died of
AIDS, the hospital sent letters to his patients offering AIDS
testing and counseling.
   The patients' contact with Almaraz presents only a slight risk
of infection, the hospital said.
   ``We believe there was no blood-to-blood contact between Dr.
Almaraz and his patients,'' Rosenberg said.

<TEXT>
   A jury Friday decided PTL founder Jim
Bakker should pay nearly $130 million to his former contributors, a
decision attorneys said made it unlikely the jailed televangelist's
followers will collect.
   ``The only thing my client owns is a 45-year lease on a 5-by-7
room in a Minnesota prison,' said Gene Carr, one of Bakker's
attorneys. Bakker received a 45-year sentence for fraud and
conspiracy after a criminal trial last year.
   Friday's judgment came on the fifth day of jury deliberations in
a class-action lawsuit that went to trial Oct. 24.
   The other defendants - accounting firm Deloitte, Haskins &amp;
Sells; David Taggart, Bakker's former personal aide; and Aimee
Cortese, a minister from New York who served on PTL's board of
directors - were not liable for any damages, the jury ruled.
   Also Friday, just 10 miles south of here in Fort Mill, S.C.,
California faith healer Morris Cerullo closed a deal to buy the
bankrupt PTL ministry for $42.5 million.
   The ministry includes the Heritage USA religious theme park and
two 500-room luxury hotels, five restaurants, a shopping mall, a
water park, a conference center, housing projects and more than
1,500 undeveloped acres.
   ``My client's integrity has been vindicated,'' said Jim
Williams, one of Deloitte's attorneys. ``This has been a tough
three years for them.''
   Tom Anderson, lead attorney for the plaintiffs, conceded after
the verdict it's unlikely his clients will collect any of the award
from Bakker. Bakker earns 12 cents an hour working at the Federal
Medical Center in Rochester, Minn.
   ``In order to collect any money it must have come from Deloitte
Haskins &amp; Sells,'' he said. ``We don't know of any deep pockets as
far as Jim Bakker goes.''
   The accounting firm, renamed Deloitte &amp; Touche after a merger,
is the nation's fourth-largest.
   The lawsuit claim totaled $757 million when it was filed in 1987
by about 145,000 contributors that PTL called ``lifetime
partners.'' They alleged Bakker conspired with other PTL officials
and accountants to set up secret bank accounts to give Bakker, his
wife, Tammy Faye, and other ministry leaders huge bonuses.
   Anderson, who spent more than $2 million of his own money on the
case, said he was ``very, very disappointed'' with the verdict.
   ``I feel that Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells got away with something
and I don't like it,'' Anderson said. ``The money is not the worst
thing, I just don't think justice was done.''
   Anderson said he will appeal.
   The jury deliberated for nearly 28 hours. Jury forewoman Denise
Elsner said the panel knew that any damages against Bakker would be
virtually uncollectable.
   A bankruptcy trustee closed Bakker's Heritage USA theme park
last year, and Bakker was fined $500,000 when he was imprisoned.
   She said jurors agreed that Bakker defrauded his flock but ``we
didn't feel he was a racketeer,'' a finding that automatically
would have tripled damages.
   Guy Forcucci, a tax partner at Deloitte, Haskins &amp; Sells, began
to cry when the jury's decision was made and gave an associate a
victory punch.
   ``I just have gratitude the jury focused on the issues and not
the innuendo,'' he said. ``This has been hell for me the past three
years. I just hope this is the last chapter in the PTL saga.''
   The jury said Bakker should pay $129,618,000 in actual damages
and $129,618 in punitive damages. The jury said Bakker would be
required to pay punitive damages because he committed common law
fraud.
   The jury did not elaborate on how it arrived at the figures.
   Another large accounting firm, Philadelphia-based Laventhol &amp;
Horwath, was named in the lawsuit, but the proceeding against the
firm was halted in midtrial when it filed for protection under
Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy law.
   During their deliberations, the jurors had asked to see several
items, including a video of Bakker hawking lifetime partnerships,
Bakker's criminal indictments, various brochures about lifetime
partnership programs and a bill sent by former PTL builder Roe
Messner on a payment of $265,000 to Jessica Hahn.
   Bakker resigned from his Fort Mill, S.C., ministry on March 19,
1987, amid a sex and money scandal involving Ms. Hahn.
   Mrs. Elsner described jury deliberations as festive, yet
``excruciating.''
   ``It was not like `L.A. Law.' It was more like `The Three
Stooges,''' she quipped.
   ``We're all going to go home now and have a nervous breakdown,''
said Mrs. Elsner, a social worker.
   Cerullo, head of San Diego-based Morris Cerullo World
Evangelism, did not attend Friday's negoatiations on the sale. In
September, he closed a $7 million deal for the former PTL
television studios and satellite network and began a monthlong
telethon that raised about $11 million of the money he needed to
buy the rest of Heritage USA.
   Secured creditors, who have deeds to parts of the PTL estate as
collateral for their investments or loans, stand to get about $39
million from the sale. But non-secured creditors, the donors who
won Friday's settlement, stand to receive little or nothing from
the sale.

   A judge Friday barred a record store
from selling 2 Live Crew's album ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be''
after listening to one song and deeming it obscene.
   Sheriff Wayne McElveen brought the civil action against Harvest
Records to prevent the record store in this southwestern Louisiana
town from selling copies of the album.
   Calcasieu Parish Judge E. Woody Thompson heard one song before
making the ruling. The sheriff's department lawyer, Fred Book, gave
the judge a transcript of the lyrics and played the song ``Me So
Horny.''
   The judge shook his head as he listened to the lyrics.
   Book said he wanted to enter the entire album into evidence and
asked if Thompson would like to hear the entire album.
   ``I'll rule that I don't want to hear any more,'' Thompson
replied.
   In October in Lafayette, 45 miles east of Lake Charles, a member
of 2 Live Crew, Mark ``Brother Marquis'' Ross, pleaded guilty to
obscenity and was fined $1,000 for simulating sex during a show by
the rap group in 1987.
   The plea came two days after Ross and two other members of the
group were acquitted in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., of obscenity for an
adults-only show at a nightclub in June.
   The store's attorney, James Morris, said no immediate decision
was made on whether to appeal.

   Albania was rocked by a second day of
riots Friday, and troops moved into the central city of Elbasan to
halt a mob of about 1,000 who ``destroyed everything in their
way,'' an Albanian journalist said.
   Albanian radio confirmed the unrest in Elbasan, about 18 miles
southeast of the capital Tirana. It said said six security force
members were injured by stones and two had to be hospitalized. It
also reported much damage on Thursday during seven hours of
vandalism and looting in the northern city of Shkodra.
   An editor of the Albanian ATA news agency said Elbasan, a city
of about 80,000 residents with a giant steel mill, was quiet Friday
night after soldiers and security forces moved in.
   Albanian media reported that 10 people were hurt and 30 arrested
in Thursday's violence in Shkodra.
   Albanian radio, monitored in London, also said an attempt was
made Friday to gather in the main square of the central coastal
city of Durres, but security forces intervened and dispersed
``these malevolent elements.''
   The two days of riots followed government concessions that
allowed formation of Albania's first non-Communist party. The small
Balkan nation south of Yugoslavia is ruled by the last Stalinist
regime remaining in Europe.
   Journalists and intellectuals had said Communist President Ramiz
Alia was meeting with leaders of the Democratic Party of Albania,
formed on Wednesday, as both sides appealed for calm and a halt to
unrest in provincial cities.
   But an intellectual said later the meeting never took place. He
said he talked with others who had wanted to participate, and
indicated the explanation by authorities was that no meeting was
needed because ``All that must be done and said has been done and
said. No more words. Now we must work.''
   Alia decided this week to allow alternative parties. Popular
uprisings last year toppled the other Communist governments in
Eastern Europe, Alia appeared to be trying to avoid an explosion of
popular discontent over living conditions and decades of Communist
repression.
   But on Friday, the angry crowd in Elbasan stoned official
buildings, ``broke windows, looted food shops, set fire to
different shops, cars and machinery,'' said the ATA journalist, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``They destroyed everything in their way,'' he said, indicating
that local police failed to stop the crowd.
   The official Tanjug news agency in neighboring Yugoslavia said
footage shown on Albanian TV ``showed fire and police vehicles with
water cannon on fire, turned-over police cars, smashed and
vandalized store windows.'' It did not say where the footage was
taken.
   Other footage identified as being shot in Shkodra showed armored
vehicles guarding the local radio and Communist Party buildings,
Tanjug said.
   Tanjug said Albanian Justice Minister Enver Halili appeared on
TV and said that democracy and socialism were in danger in Albania.
   The intellectual in Tirana, contacted by telephone from Vienna,
expressed concern that the violence ``is commanded by a hidden
hand. Who this is, I cannot grasp.''
   Asked if he thought the violence might endanger what has been
achieved in Tirana, he said: ``Exactly. It is done only for this,
to get the new events, the new freedom into difficulty.''
   An intellectual in Tirana said peaceful protests took place
Thursday in the southern town of Saranda on the Adriatic coast.
   The intellectual, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
crowds in Tirana had gathered outside the Palace of Congresses on
Friday evening in anticipation of the meeting between the president
and the new party. When the party was formed, tens of thousands of
people cheered party leaders at a peaceful rally.
   The opposition had been expected to present its platform for
economic reforms and adherence to international human rights
guidelines.
   On Wednesday, Alia appealed on nationwide TV and radio for
peaceful change in Albania, which has been under rigid Communist
rule since 1944.
   His decision to allow alternative political movements may have
touched off resistance among conservative elements of the ruling
Communists and the Sigurimi, the secret police.
   Alia also fired five hard-line members of his ruling Politburo.
   Police and troops moved into Shkodra on Thursday to deal with
hundreds of ``hooligans'' who attacked officials and buildings,
wounding the local police chief and two other officers, official
reports said.
   Persistent reports this year, many from Yugoslavia and Greece,
spoke of unrest in Shkodra and other northern areas that
traditionally were Roman Catholic before the Communists took over.
   Reports also surfaced of unrest in southern Albania, home to an
estimated 40,000 ethnic Greeks.
   Official newspapers carried a statement Friday from the new
party condemning the Shkodra violence. It was also read on state by
one of the party's leaders, Arben Imame.

   Forty western Massachusetts fir trees
were shipped to the Persian Gulf on Friday after Air Force
officials approved the Christmas project.
   The trees, cut and packaged by volunteers, and trimmings made by
Westfield school children, were shipped out of Westover Air Force
Base on a C-5A transport plane, said Major Richard Dyer, a base
spokesman.
   Initially, base officials were advised that the trees could not
be sent to Saudi Arabia because the Saudis' might object to the
Christian symbols, Dyer said.
   ``We were wrong,'' Dyer said. ``When we determined that there
was no religious prohibition by the Saudi government, we thought we
could ship them over there and deliver them fresh.''
   Dyer blamed the temporary grounding on ``conflicting guidance.''
   The base is the main staging area in the Northeast for transport
planes flying men and equipment to Saudi Arabia.
   The fir trees were carefully wrapped in plastic to keep them
fresh and packaged in cardboard tubes, donated by a Westfield
company that uses the tubes as forms for poured concrete.

   A Santa Fe freight train derailed Friday
in a remote region in north-central Texas and two police officers
were overcome with fumes from spilled chemicals.
   None of three people aboard the train, heading from Louisiana to
Fort Hood in Killeen, was injured when 13 cars derailed near
Alvarado.
   Two Alvarado officers were treated at a hospital as a
precautionary measure after breathing chemical fumes and were later
released, said police Sgt. Gerald Tucker.
   A state Department of Public Safety dispatcher said two
chemicals spilled from the derailed cars. The amount and types of
chemicals spilled was not immediately known.
   ``There is hazardous material involved in the cars that are
derailed,'' said Ken Jure, an assistant superintendent for Santa Fe
railroad.
   Fire officials said the spill posed no danger to residents.
   A portion of the train in front of the derailment was carrying
military equipment, including tanks and other equipment, to Fort
Hood, officials said.

   Chad Goetsch, 20, will be eligible for parole Nov. 8, 2014, 25
years after Caroline Goetsch died when her son shot her through the

   Dodge County Judge Daniel Klossner set the parole date for
Goetsch, who was adopted at age 3 by state Rep. Robert Goetsch.
   The first-degree intentional homicide conviction requires a
mandatory life sentence. A jury in September Goetsch guilty of
killing his 51-year-old mother and recklessly endangering his

   For the endangerment charge, Klossner sentenced Goetsch to a

state $2,000 restitution and his father $2,530 restitution.
   Robert Goetsch did not attend the sentencing.
   The younger Goetsch shot his mother Nov. 8, 1989, during a

<TEXT>
   Government regulators seized control Friday
of the state's largest savings and loan, a thrift racked by bad
real estate loans and allegations of fraud.
   The federal Office of Thrift Supervision placed ComFed Savings
Bank under control of the government's Resolution Trust Corp.
   Officials from that agency will try to find buyers for ComFed's
assets, said Jonathan Davis of Resolution Trust.
   Federal officials stressed the takeover did not interrupt
ComFed's day-to-day operations and the thrift's 30 branches in
Massachusetts and Connecticut will remain open for business as
usual.
   Earlier this week, the state closed New England AllBank for
Savings in Gardner, transferring its operations to another bank.
   ComFed Savings had been in deep trouble for months, but
regulators did not close it, instead taking the interim step of
placing it in conservatorship.
   The thrift's trouble stemmed mostly from losses in its loan
portfolio. The government said the bank was hurt both by the
declining real estate market and ``unsafe and unsound lending
practices.''
   As of Sept. 30, ComFed's delinquent loans totaled $219 million,
or 15.6 percent of total assets. ComFed reported assets of $1.4
billion, liabilities of $1.43 billion and tangible capital of
negative $78.6 million.
   ComFed's losses totaled $103.4 million for the nine months that
ended Sept. 30.
   ComFed Chairman Jack Zoeller said the thrift's financial
troubles were compounded by fraud schemes carried out by former
employees.
   Several ex-workers who handled loans for ComFed were convicted
of fraud. In October, the federal government indicted 12 people in
connection with a mortgage fraud scheme. The defendants included
two former ComFed executives.
   Officials said the scheme exposed ComFed to at least $12 million
in losses.

   The senior engineer aboard an Amtrak train that
smashed into a commuter train, injuring 264 people, had been banned
from operating trains in suburban New York because of signals
violations, authorities said Friday.
   Willis Copeland, 53, of Bethany, Conn., was supervising an
apprentice engineer at the controls of the Night Owl from
Washington that derailed and crashed as it approached a Boston
station during morning rush-hour Wednesday.
   On March 27, Copeland agreed to a lifetime ban from Metro-North
Railroad, the commuter railroad that serves New York's northern
suburbs, after running two temporary stop signs in 1988 and in
March, said Metro-North spokeswoman Marjorie Anders.
   He also was at the controls of an Amtrak train involved in a
July 1984 crash that was blamed on a signal problem. The National
Transportation Safety Board cleared him of wrongdoing.
   Apprentice engineer Richard Abramson, 41, of Trumbull, Conn.,
and Copeland were among eight people still hospitalized Friday.
Copeland was in stable condition after undergoing surgery for
multiple injuries, including a spinal fracture, and Abramson was in
good condition with a broken collarbone.
   NTSB vice chairwoman Susan Coughlin said a train driven by
Copeland derailed when he failed to stop before a drawbridge in New
York state in February 1979. Two months later, Copeland was
involved in a yard derailment, she said.
   Copeland was dismissed from Conrail in December 1971 and
reinstated six weeks later, Coughlin said. The reason for the
dismissal was unclear, she said.
   Copeland was unable to comment because of his condition.
   None of the signal violations while he worked for Metro-North
resulted in an accident.
   Federal safety officials said Friday that although Abramson
reported that brake failure caused the train to derail underground
near the Back Bay Station, the investigation into the cause of the
crash is far from complete.
   ``That is what he told our investigators,'' said NTSB spokesman
Brent Bahler. ``However, that has not been confirmed through any
other interviews or information we have. The investigation is still
very much open.''
   The Night Owl derailed along a curve and crashed into a
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority commuter train, injuring
264 people.
   Abramson told investigators he tried to brake the train three
times as it approached the station.
   ``He indicated that in his three attempts to brake the train,
the brakes failed to set up properly to stop it,'' Coughlin said
Thursday night.
   NTSB officials said Friday night it was possible the brakes on
both Amtrak locomotives failed, but the brakes on the train's
passenger cars were found to be working normally.
   Coughlin also said technicians were able to recover data from an
Amtrak recorder that had been erased. That information will be
analyzed in the next few days, she said.
   A tone had been recorded over portions of the tape covering the
final minutes before the crash, but Coughlin said it was unclear
whether that was an accident or had been done intentionally.
   Abramson had taken over operation of a regular train run for the
first time this week, authorities said.
   Bahler said that each car in a train has brakes, and normally
all are used to stop a train. Preliminary tests on the
least-damaged Amtrak cars, toward the rear of the train, showed no
brake failure.
   ``However, we'll be interested in determining the condition of
the brakes on the front of the train,'' Bahler said.
   Amtrak spokesman Cliff Black said train brakes are tested and
visually inspected upon departure and at every stop along a route.
   ``This train had no problems with earlier stops or speed
restrictions along the route, indicating that the brakes were
working,'' Black said, adding that it was as yet unknown whether
the brakes simply failed while entering Boston.
   ``It is within the realm of possibility that a brake problem
could have occurred at that point, but I don't know and I'm not
going to pretend to speculate,'' Black said.
   Coughlin said speed could have been a factor. Although there was
no way to determine the train's exact speed when it derailed, data
compiled from the station showed it averaged 91.8 mph during the
last 1\ miles before impact.

   Seven former Persian Gulf hostages got a
festive White House welcome even as images of the destruction they
had left behind lingered in their minds.
   The newly freed captives met with President Bush for an hour
Thursday, and five tagged along as he lit the national Christmas
tree in a nearby park. They provided a united vote of confidence
for Bush's efforts to free Kuwait from Iraq.
   ``To a man, we were in agreement with the care and the diligence
which is being taken by the president,'' said Ralph Montgomery, who
spent four months hiding in Kuwait.
   The hostages urged Bush to see that the international coalition
against Iraq stands firm, said Montgomery. The 57-year-old
architect from Indian Rocks Beach, Fla., hid with his son-in-law,
who was a teacher at the American school in Kuwait.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Blood and law, in the form of advice from his
brother, convinced William Bennett he should reverse himself and
reject the chairmanship of the Republican National Committee.
   Bennett's brother Robert is the special counsel investigating
one of Congress' most sensitive ethics cases - the propriety of
five senators' actions on behalf of financier Charles H. Keating
Jr., a major contributor.
   And from brother Bill's perspective, that case and his own ``are
not totally unrelated.'' Bennett, in an interview Thursday, said he
asked his brother whether he should take the top GOP position.
   ``He said, `My advice to you is not to take this job,''' Bennett
said. ``I said, `Is it a close call?' and he said, `90-10.'''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Secretary of State James A. Baker III told his
Soviet counterpart this week that heavy-handed measures to enforce
control of the economy and in the restive Baltic republics could
jeopardize a massive U.S. aid package, U.S. officials say.
   Baker made the point privately to Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze as the Soviet described Moscow's drive to assert
central authority in a country beset by economic problems and
separatist movements, a knowledgeable official said.
   ``I wouldn't describe it as a major warning,'' the official,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said Thursday night.
   The conversation occurred in Houston before President Bush's
announcement Wednesday that he would help the Soviets meet
anticipated winter shortages by approving up to $1 billion in
federally guaranteed loans for purchases of food and other
agricultural goods.

   CLARKSTON, Mich. (AP) - A judge dismissed a murder charge
against a doctor who invented a device that an Alzheimer's disease
victim used to kill herself, but he didn't clear the doctor to use
the machine again.
   District Judge Gerald McNally on Thursday threw out a
first-degree murder charge against Dr. Jack Kevorkian in the June 4
death of Janet Adkins. She died after activating a machine
Kevorkian invented that sent poison into her veins.
   Kevorkian was with her at the time of her death.
   McNally ruled at the end of a two-day preliminary hearing that
Michigan has no law against suicide or assisting in it.

   UNDATED - White House fears of unduly alarming the public have
delayed until next week the release of an Environmental Protection
Agency report linking electromagnetic fields to leukemia and brain
cancer in children, the EPA says.
   The report, which was to have been released last month,
suggests, but does not prove, that electromagnetic fields can cause
cancer, EPA officials said Thursday.
   D. Allan Bromley, a White House science adviser, and James O.
Mason, assistant secretary of health and human services, told EPA
officials they were concerned the public would misinterpret the
report's conclusions.
   ``They were concerned not about the accuracy of the report,''
said Robert McGaughy, who supervised the report's preparation.
``They were concerned about how people would react to the news.
There is a concern that people will take too seriously the
suggestions that there may be some connection with cancer.''

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - It's coming out over budget, behind schedule
and 16 years after its predecessor, but Paramount executives are
betting ``The Godfather Part III'' will be a movie audiences can't
refuse.
   After a frantic month of round-the-clock editing and polishing,
the final film in Francis Ford Coppola's Mafia trilogy was unveiled
Wednesday to critics and movie theater owners in New York, San
Francisco, Los Angeles and other key markets across the country.
   The response was mixed. Disappointment ran higher among New York
viewers, while those who watched in Los Angeles applauded.
   The movie will open on Christmas Day on 1,800 screens in the
United States and Canada. It originally was scheduled for a
Thanksgiving release, but was moved back because of production
delays.

<HEAD>Intoxicating Music Wafts From Jamey Turner's Brandy Snifters</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Musician Jamey Turner's favorite
instrument consists of 60 brandy snifters, several jugs of water
and a sturdy table, accompanied by a silent prayer that it won't
rain or freeze.
   Turner, a 50-year-old resident of this Washington, D.C., suburb,
earns his living playing water glasses. As far as he knows, he's
the only full-time, professional water glass musician in the United
States, and one of very, very few anywhere in the world.
   Simply by rubbing his wet fingers around the rims of glasses
partially filled with water - a trick he learned from his parents
at the dining room table - Turner can produce some of the most
ethereal music this side of heaven.
   He has mesmerized audiences from Boston Common to San Diego's
Balboa Park with splayed hands that swoop in deft circles over his
sparkling glasses, coaxing them to sing sweetly from Bach, Mozart,
Gershwin or the Beatles.
   His musical theme song is the ``Ode to Joy'' from Beethoven's
Ninth Symphony, which affirms his belief in the brotherhood of
mankind.
   ``My music is part of my ministry,'' says Turner. ``It lifts
people's spirits. It helps them feel closer to God and gives them a
sense of joy.''
   A former college instructor, photographer and camera salesman,
Turner has played the clarinet since he was a fifth-grader in rural
Montana. About 15 years ago, he turned to more unusual instruments.
   He became a self-taught expert in the glass harp, the musical
saw and the ``wrench harp,'' his own invention which features an
assortment of household wrenches stretched on a wooden frame with
fishing line. ``It produces a wonderful chiming sound,'' Turner
says.
   He settled on the glass harp, or musical water glasses, and has
been playing them ever since.
   Turner gives about 200 performances a year, from street corners
to concert halls. He has appeared five times with the Philadelphia
Orchestra as water glass soloist, and twice with the National
Symphony Orchestra.
   He's played for TV network shows, hospitals, schools, churches,
prisons, corporate meetings, weddings, birthdays and bar mitzvahs,
for a black-tie reception at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in
Washington and a catfish festival in Mississippi. He even dubbed
the music for movie actor Michael Douglas' water glass scene in
``The War of the Rose.''
   Lest anyone think they are musical oddities, Turner notes that
water glasses were popular classical instruments in the late 18th
and early 19th centuries.
   Mozart wrote two compositions for water glasses just before he
died in 1792, and Beethoven wrote several short serenades for the
glass harmonica, a mechanical version invented by Benjamin
Franklin. Similar pieces were written by Haydn, Gluck, Saint-Saens
and Donizetti.
   Turner says he prefers brandy snifters because their curved
shape provides a built-in resonating chamber that yields a
``rounder, fuller sound'' than ordinary water tumblers. He favors
plain glass over leaded crystal, which rings too long and has sharp
edges that hurt his fingers.
   ``I use only distilled water,'' he said. ``It gives me better
friction on my fingers and it makes a lighter, brighter sound than
tap water.''
   Squirting the water with a pair of oven basters, Turner spends
about 15 minutes tuning his snifters, which are strapped to a
custom-built wooden table with heavy rubber bands. The notes
correspond to nearly all the keys on the upper half of a piano.
   An itinerate water-glass musician must contend with some
frustrating hazards, Turner says.
   In the arid Southwest, the notes gradually sharpen as the water
evaporates. If it rains, the music goes flat. In Tampa, Fla., one
year a post-Christmas cold snap almost froze Turner's instrument.
The high winds accompanying a sudden thunderstorm in New Orleans
almost overturned his table.
   Through it all, Turner says he is continually awed and humbled
by his audiences' emotional response to his music.
   ``Water glasses produce a very mellow, genuinely sweet sound
that seems to have a universal appeal,'' Turner says. ``People find
it very healing. Countless times I look up and see some people
crying and nearly everyone smiling. It's a very joyous
instrument.''
   After one Bach performance before a sidewalk crowd, he said, ``a
teen-age boy came up in tears and whispered in my ear, `I don't
have any money to put in your basket, but you saved my life,' and
he ran away. He might have been contemplating suicide, but I'll
never know.''
   A lighter moment occurred during a lunch-time recital on Wall
Street, when Turner overheard one three-piece suit remark to
another: ``He's going to be very successful. Just look at those
liquid assets.''

<HEAD>Ted Koppel Investigates Sex in the Soviet Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ratings sweeps are over, so you can't
exactly accuse Ted Koppel of doing a report on s-e-x this week to
boost ABC's Nielsens.
   But you can accuse him of doing a fine, responsible job in ``The
Koppel Report: Sex in the Soviet Union.'' And of going beyond the
old reliables: porn, prostitution and the baring of Soviet bosoms
for Playboy magazine.
   The thesis of Koppel's special, which airs Wednesday, is that
the uproars loosed by the new freedom of sex and expression in
Mikhail Gorbachev's Soviet Union reflect far more profound changes
convulsing that nation.
   As Koppel notes in his preface: ``This is a program about
political, economic and moral problems as seen through the prism of
sex in the Soviet Union.''
   This doesn't mean the one-hour show is a dry recitation of those
problems, though. Far from it.
   An advance look at an unfinished version of the show reveals
some pictures you could call ``wowee!'' shots - even though ABC
says they'll be electronically altered before broadcast.
   These include scenes of dancing, bare-breasted women who are
part of a heavy metal act, and a nude woman starting to put a
condom on a nude man in a sex education film shown right there on
Soviet TV.
   (Speaking of the latter, Koppel wryly notes that this still
would be a no-no here, that ``what is now routinely shown on Soviet
state television has to be sanitized for American TV.'')
   And it's amusing to see Soviet men crowded into a cramped
basement ``Videoklub,'' one of a number of porn theaters now
allowed, avidly watching a soft-core porn movie full of the usual
gasps and heavy breathing.
   But all this aside, Koppel's expedition into Soviet lives, laws
and morals under glasnost is a somber, often sad trip, despite the
occasional side visit to places like the Videoklub or the interview
with a former soldier who now earns his way impersonating Marilyn
Monroe.
   The main stories Koppel reports on: the lack of privacy caused
by housing shortages; rampant divorce; virtually no sex education;
a lack of contraceptive devices, and an abortion rate he says is
six times that of the United States. One woman he interviews claims
to have had nine abortions and her mother, 19.
   In his look at the world's oldest profession, Soviet-style,
Koppel reports that prostitution is seen not as just a profitable
venture. It also is seen as a means of escape, a chance to meet and
marry Western men who will take their ladies of the night from the
Soviet Union.
   AIDS is on the rise and a potential epidemic, he finds, and for
the same reason it has spread in the United States - ``promiscuity
and ignorance.''
   New freedoms may abound, but homosexuality remains a cause for
furtive gatherings; it's still a crime punishable by up to three
years in prison.
   As one Soviet official bluntly puts it, homosexuality should be
a crime ``because most people who are AIDS virus carriers are
homosexuals.''
   Much in the show has been reported on before. But Koppel and his
troops do a first-rate job of putting it all into comprehensive
context.
   They don't always succeed, notably in the closing chapter in
which Koppel tries to sort out the meaning of increasing public
outrage that seems fairly divided.
   One increasingly vocal camp is opposed to the new
permissiveness. The other demands more freedom for sexual
minorities and far better treatment for women who, the show
reports, remain second-class citizens in all aspects of Soviet
life, including employment.
   Koppel's search for the cosmic conclusion to all this doesn't
quite come off. But no matter. His show still is a solid,
well-crafted documentary of the kind that have become a rarity at
the big networks.
   ---
   Elsewhere in television ...
   LEND AN EAR: Radio, as old fuds know, is TV without pictures.
Sometimes it even makes you use your imagination. Case in point:
National Public Radio's unique version of Charles Dickens' ``A
Christmas Carol,'' taped for broadcast by NPR stations during the
holidays. In it, Jonathan Winters, the wild man of many voices,
stars as Scrooge - and also is the voice of every other male
character in the show, even Tiny Tim. The womenfolk all are played
by Mimi Kennedy. It's an amazing feat by Winters. The only
drawback: He doesn't play it for laughs. He actually plays it
straight.
   Incidentally, NPR has had a brain wave aimed at helping those
who don't know the dial location of their local public radio
station. Just dial 202-822-2323, NPR says. The party at the other
end will be more than glad to help.

<HEAD>Keating Case Spurs Members to Demand Changes in Campaign Financing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Alan Cranston, defending himself against
allegations of impropriety, used props his audience could
understand: giant charts with the names of all senators and the
aides they authorize to solicit campaign contributions.
   If his help for big contributor Charles H. Keating Jr. is judged
improper, Cranston warned the Senate Ethics Committee, ``then every
senator, including every member of this committee, had better run
for cover - because every senator has done it.''
   Beyond the fates of the five senators, the question posed by the
Keating hearings which resume this week is whether the
embarrassment will be enough to shock Congress into altering the
system.
   Cranston, D-Calif., and the other four senators who allegedly
overstepped the bounds of propriety to help Keating and his failed
Lincoln Savings and Loan are blaming the system - while insisting
they are innocent.
   Nowhere is the demand for changing the campaign-financing law
louder than among the accused.
   ``It looks like hell,'' said Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., who
with Cranston faces the most serious allegations among the Keating
Five. ``Quite frankly, I don't want to have to go raise all the
money and go through all of this consternation.''
   There's been little agreement in the committee's four weeks of
hearings, except that Congress itself has been tarnished by the
experience. The hearings have placed an intense spotlight on the
relentless demands for money that are a part of congressional
campaigns and a full-time preoccupation for nearly every member of
Congress.
   ``I think that (the) Keating Five is adding to the momentum for
campaign finance reform,'' said Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., who was
shot down on the floor by House Democrats earlier this year when he
tried to gain House approval for a public campaign-financing
provision.
   ``America is getting a no-holds-barred explanation of what
really goes on in this campaign-finance system,'' said Fred
Wertheimer, president of the lobbying group Common Cause. ``And I
think it is confirming their worst suspicions.
   ``Never mind the aides,'' he said of Cranston's charts. ``The
senators can be on the phone raising money from the very same
people who come in to ask for help.''
   Other members of the Senate have rushed to blame the system.
   ``What is corrupt,'' said Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., ``is the
system. There is too darn much money required to seek and hold
office.''
   Congressional candidates spent $458 million in the 1988
elections. All reports aren't in yet for the 1990 races, but the
figure is likely to be about the same, perhaps higher.
   Yet so far there has been no clear sign that the case of the
Keating Five has provided the impetus for change that the Watergate
scandal created for public financing of presidential campaigns.
   The House and the Senate each passed bills this year aimed at
limiting campaign spending and lessening the influence of
special-interest money on congressional elections.
   But no compromise ever emerged, and the bills died.
   The more sweeping Senate bill would have banned political action
committee contributions and created partial public financing of
congressional campaigns. The House version would have created
voluntary spending limits.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, a supporter of public
financing, says changing the law remains a top priority of Senate
Democrats in the new Congress.
   House Speaker Tom Foley's support for some form of
campaign-spending law change has been considered suspect by many
proponents, however, and House Democrats have been reluctant to
change a system that re-elects incumbents at a rate of 96 percent
or better.
   They figure that spending limits would help incumbents by
limiting challengers' ability to compete, but that limits on
contributions could reduce the advantage of incumbency.
   With the scandals of former Speaker Jim Wright and Democratic
Whip Tony Coelho, the last Congress provided a good opportunity -
but one that fell short. Still, some are optimistic that Foley's
maturing leadership and the Keating case may make a difference.
   ``The Keating Five situation is a reflection of the kinds of
problems that occur when you refuse to fix a situation that is
broke,'' said Synar. He predicted passage of campaign-finance
legislation ``in the first quarter'' of the next session, which
begins Jan. 3.
   The Keating case is not one of a typical campaign contributor.
But the $1.3 million he contributed or raised for the causes and
campaigns of the five senators demonstrates how existing limits on
contributions can be circumvented.
   Much of that money, $850,000, went to voter-registration efforts
supported by Cranston and was not covered by existing limits. Other
contributions were raised by Keating from his employees and
associates. And Cranston had available to his re-election campaign,
but did not use, a $300,000 line of credit from Lincoln.
   The possibilities for corruption inherent in a system that
demands endless fund raising were noted by the ethics committee's
special counsel, Robert S. Bennett. Increased demands for money,
combined with increasing demands on Congress from constituents,
create a ``booming warning,'' Bennett said.
   ``Unless these trends are recognized and dealt with, we will
have more cases like this and the reputation of this body and its
members will be in ruins,'' he said.

<HEAD>How to Lose Money on a Japanese Investment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Gabos had hoped to strike it rich this
Christmas with a gimmick designed to symbolically turn the tables
on Japan, but his Japan Land Owner's Kit has put him about $100,000
in the hole.
   So much for Yankee ingenuity.
   ``I've had trouble,'' Gabos said. ``I could tell you I've sold
thousands of them, but I haven't.''
   A bar-code scanning equipment salesman by day, Gabos has been
shut out in his attempt to gain retail shelf space for his
moonlighting project: triangular cardboard boxes holding membership
certificates to The Preferred Japanese Land Owner's Club.
   ``Own a piece of Japan,'' the boxes urge.
   Convinced that Americans were feeling overpowered by the
increasing Japanese economic presence in the United States, the
31-year-old Gabos bet a large chunk of his life savings on the
notion that 1 million consumers would spend $12 to $14 each to
belong to a club which owns tiny piece of idle farmland in
Hokkaido, the least densely populated prefecture of Japan.
   Gabos bought the plot for about $50,000. The club owns the land
as a group, but club members don't hold individual ownership rights
and have restricted use privileges: They are prohibited from
building, hunting, camping, or removing soil, rocks, vegetation or
anything else.
   By mid-December, Gabos and his wife, Christine, had sold about
100 units, mostly to friends and through direct mail. Others from
the first printing run of 10,000 units are gathering dust.
   The couple has tried to build awareness of the product through
the news media with limited success. Now they are considering
several advertising options.
   ``It could very well be a turkey if he hasn't sold it to any
major retailers yet,'' Pet Rock inventor Gary Dahl said.``He's
blown it for this year.''
   Dahl has reviewed more than 5,000 gimmicks since selling 1.5
million Pet Rocks in the 1975 Christmas season.
   Had Gabos been able to offer the gimmick to retailers a few
weeks sooner than Oct. 15, they may have been more open to the
idea, he said. But there were delays closing the real estate deal.
Gabos said he found himself in a ``Catch 22'' situation wherein
retailers would pledge to buy the kits if other stores successfully
carried them.
   Gabos said the endeavor surprised a lot of his friends because
he considers himself a ``conservative guy.'' But his employer, Neal
Johnson of Dataserv Inc., a bar-code scanning concern in suburban
Eden Prairie, Minn., said the get-rich-quick scheme didn't shock
him.
   ``He's often told me he just wants to find a way to make a buck
apiece out of a million people to become a millionaire,'' Johnson
said. ``He's a tremendously talented, individual guy.''
   ``I haven't given up hope,'' Gabos said. ``This isn't a thing
that will be obsolete after Christmas. I honestly believe it will
sell out.''
   Christine Gabos said she's confident they will eventually break
even at least. But even if they lose money, she said they will have
no regrets.
   The $100,000 they spent came from stocks, bonds and other
savings, they said. John Gabos said they probably will keep the
land after the club expires, but he said he has no specific plans
for it. Legally he can't sell it until the year 2000, when the club
and its memberships expire.

and fascination. Even the chores and trials of daily life can be
inscrutable, as the writer discovered when she was assigned to the
AP bureau in Beijing.

   The driver wove through congested traffic, veered
around mule-drawn wagons and passed with cabbage-laden trucks, that
dated from World War II.
   A woman carrying a large basket of produce stepped directly in
front of the car. The driver braked, swerved, blasted the horn. The
woman stared as we passed her, bicycles crisscrossing in our wake.
   I had just arrived to take up residence in Beijing, and made a
mental note that a drive across town should not be approached
lightly.
   There is much for an outsider to learn in the world's most
populous country, from its ancient past to its complex modern
politics.
   It remains unique, despite increased contact with the outside,
and entices the curious to explore.
   Villagers welcome foreigners warmly, giving directions to the
most scenic spots nearby, sometimes even inviting them home for a
meal. On a long train ride, Chinese travelers will chat at length
with outsiders over tea.
   In China, evem the ordinary can be exotic. Sometimes, after a
wind storm from the north, it seems as if half the Gobi Desert has
been deposited on the floors, furniture and windowsills of a
Beijing apartment.
   Beijing is heated by coal and its air is thick with the residue.
You can tell how long someone has been in the capital, it is said,
by the severity and frequency of the person's cough.
   A newcomer must apply for a health certificate. Those who are
prepared bring letters from doctors back home, chest X-rays and
copies of laboratory reports certifying they have no communicable
diseases.
   Getting Chinese officials to accept the papers is the challenge.
The canny applicant places a ``chop,'' or official stamp, on every
piece of paper to lend an air of authority.
   After some wrangling, the hospital official agreed to accept my
X-ray. More discussion was needed to avoid paying the X-ray fee
even though no X-ray would be taken.
   By this time, a crowd had gathered to hear the discussion, which
alternated between Chinese and English as each of us used whichever
seemed best suited to the point at issue.
   Finally, the health official had dropped all but one demand. She
insisted I have a blood test for syphilis.
   A New York doctor had given me a letter saying I had no venereal
diseases, but, the official declared, ``Syphilis is not a venereal
disease.''
   I submitted to the test, paid the fee and left, wondering
whether the entire process was designed just to collect foreign
currency.
   Foreign exchange is in great demand and having it provides
options. But it's all a bit confusing because the local currency
comes in two varieties, one for foreigners and one for Chinese.
   Renminbi, the non-convertible currency used by Chinese, is
officially unavailable to foreigners. They are supposed to use
Foreign Exchange Certificates, or FEC.
   When I went to make my first household purchase, a kettle for
boiling drinking water, I had only FEC and the price was in
renminbi. FEC has a higher street value, so I asked the clerk to
lower the price.
   Onlookers clustered around for the bargaining. Some joined in,
helping me persuade the woman to offer a ``foreign money'' price.
   So she asked for dollars. No, I was offering FEC. Pretty soon,
she was quoting three prices: renminbi, FEC or dollars.
   Much too complicated, I thought, so I left to think it over.
When I returned the next day, all the kettles were gone.
   Part of the fun of bargaining is that, when the bargainer is
foreign, it becomes instant street theater. Passers-by love to
watch and offer advice, especially if the foreigner bargains in
Chinese.
   The polite parting line is always ``You speak very good
Chinese,'' however good or bad it may have been.
   Foreigners get used to stares on the street, but official
surveillance is another matter.
   Cameras record all comings and goings at the walled compounds
where most foreigners must live. There are more subtle reminders of
probing eyes, like tea stains on newspaper clippings from a friend
in the United States who doesn't drink tea.
   Foreign reporters seem the most closely watched and the most
resentful of it, which creates a mutual animosity that isn't always
hidden.
   At Foreign Ministry briefings, spokesmen often refuse to answer
questions and rebuke those who demand answers. Reporters counter
with derisive laughter.
   A Dutch journalist asked whether a new government campaign to
improve China's image would mean greater access to leaders and more
complete answers to questions.
   Colleagues laughed, anticipating an ironic or sarcastic reply.
   ``No comment,'' the spokeswoman said.

<TEXT>
   When the Roman Catholic Church turned the Jewish
catacombs over to Italy, leaders of the West's oldest Jewish
community thought they would be as popular with tourists as the
Christian catacombs on the Appian Way.
   More than five years later, most tourists still don't know the
Jewish catacombs exist. Those who do have to brave Rome's
bureaucracy for permission to visit them.
   Plans to make the Jewish catacombs safe and easy to visit fell
victim to a government budget that is chronically short of money
even to care for archaeological sites already open to the public.
   ``All the plans are ready,'' said Nicoletta Pagliardi of Rome's
superintendency of archaeology. ``We could do it tomorrow, but the
funds are used up. We have to wait for next year's budget.''
   Disappointed but determined, Italian Jews have turned to private
groups. Last spring, the World Monuments Fund began raising money
for a scientific survey of what must be done to make the catacombs
suitable for visits.
   The catacombs, used in the first three or four centuries after
Christ, are a ``unique documentation of Jewish life, of a religious
minority which lived in imperial Rome,'' said Tullia Zevi,
president of the Union of Italian Jewish Communities.
   Burial spaces, like narrow berths in a railroad sleeper car,
were carved in soft tufa stone, one atop the other. Inscriptions on
marble slabs that covered the niches are the main source of
information about the ancient Jews, Mrs. Zevi said.
   Inscriptions indicate the Jews prayed mainly in Greek and spoke
in Latin. Many apparently were ordinary people, artisans or
merchants, but there also were bankers, magistrates, actors and
other professionals.
   On the walls of the catacombs are stunning images of menorahs,
the seven-armed candelabra; peacocks, and pomegranates symbolizing
fertility.
   Nearly all the inscriptions now reside in the Vatican's museums
and storerooms. The Vatican took charge of the Jewish catacombs
after their discovery more than 100 years ago, before the modern
Italian state was created, because it was the only organization
with the means to excavate them.
   An estimated 40,000-60,000 Jews lived in ancient Italy, compared
to today's total of about 35,000-40,000. A synagogue at Ostia
Antica, Rome's ancient port, may be the oldest monotheistic temple
in Europe.
   Of Rome's six known Jewish catacombs, four collapsed or were
built upon in the last centuries.
   The fifth is on property of a private villa near the Appia
Antica and the sixth on the grounds of Villa Torlonia, now a city
park, where dictator Benito Mussolini lived for 20 years. Mussolini
signed the 1929 Lateran Pacts that gave the Vatican control of all
catacombs.
   To see the Jewish catacombs, a visitor must apply in person for
a permit at the superintendency of archaeology.
   ``If a person comes to Rome for a weekend, they'll be gone by
the time they get a permit,'' Mrs. Zevi said.
   Nearly all requests are from scholars or Jewish groups,
Pagliardi said, and ``it's rare when an ordinary tourist hears
about'' the catacombs.
   Mrs. Zevi said she realizes it will not be possible to match the
hours of the Christian catacombs, which are open morning and
afternoon six days a week and have thousands of visitors. Villa
Torlonia, for example, can accommodate only about 10 people at a
time.
   Jewish groups would be content to see the catacombs open to the
public at least one set day a week, Mrs. Zevi said.
   The World Monuments Fund favors making the Jewish catacombs more
accessible, but worries that tourists might damage them - by
brushing against a frescoed wall, innocently introducing bacteria,
even just by breathing - said Samuel Gruber, director of the fund's
Jewish Heritage Council.
   Pagliardi said Christian catacombs have been damaged by
excessive numbers of visitors and the state wants to save the
Jewish catacombs from a similar fate.
   Electrical wiring has been installed in the first 100 yards of
the half-mile-long passageway at Villa Torlonia, but much remains
to be done. When it rains, archaeologists place blocks of wood near
the entrance to serve as stepping stones through ankle-deep water.
   The reward for going in is a chance to stand for a few minutes
in a room that testifies to the Jews' strong feelings for their
faith. A menorah fresco decorates the vaulted ceiling and a rolled
scroll, representing the Torah, is painted near the entryway.
   Other frescoes include dolphins, palm leaves and the Ark of the
Covenant. Four tufa columns in the corners are painted to look like
marble.

<HEAD>Familiar Figure Leaving Wall Street Scene</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the stock market script for 1991 starts to
play out in a couple of weeks, one familiar element will be missing
- narration by Monte Gordon.
   The 67-year-old Gordon, one of Wall Street's most widely quoted
analysts on the ups and downs of the world of finance, retires Dec.
31 after 18 years as research director at the money-management firm
of Dreyfus Corp.
   Gordon's bespectacled face became a fixture in television
coverage of the stock market all through the turbulent 1980s.
   Long before that, he was well known to newspaper reporters, and
many of their readers, as an ever-available source of market
information and analysis, often served up in a style that might be
called Unabashed Baroque.
   A vintage Gordonism, delivered on what others might have thought
of as just a dull day on Wall Street: ``The market is languishing
in the shadow of its own worries.''
   Over a career of more than four decades - he previously worked
at what is now Prudential-Bache Securities - Gordon says he has
kept an abiding fascination with the financial markets.
   ``It's always exhilarating and never the same from one day to
the next,'' he told a visitor to his 55th-floor office in
mid-Manhattan. ``You never lose the zest for this.''
   Asked how his job has changed over time, Gordon immediately
pointed to today's instant communications systems, embodied by
computer screens with instant-by-instant charts of market activity.
   ``There was a time when if you wanted to know what was going on,
you had to call a broker on the floor of the exchange,'' he said.
``All that has changed with the structure of the flow of
information.''
   Given shortened reaction times in what has become a worldwide
business, and the development of such techniques as
computer-program trading, is the market more volatile now than it
used to be?
   ``It has more potential for volatility. It's like a coiled
spring,'' Gordon observed. ``But the basic verities of what is a
good stock, what is a good company, haven't changed.''
   A dark moment in recent Wall Street history, the crash of 1987,
provided a high spot in Gordon's memory of his years of market
forecasting. ``Right after the break, I said `buy 'em,' going on
experience and instinct'' he recalls. ``That was fun.''
   After the '80s, which he describes as ``a time of great
innovation and vitality,'' Gordon acknowledges that stocks and Wall
Street are now ``paying part of the price'' for past euphoria.
   While that may continue for a while, he says, eventually the
stock market of the '90s is going to be ``strong - different from
the '80s, but strong.''
   For the typical individual investor in late 1990, he recommends
committing about 60 percent of assets to stock-related investments,
30 percent to bonds and 10 percent to money-market vehicles. He
doesn't counsel waiting for the economic outlook to clear before
putting the money to work.
   ``Remember,'' he says, ``we started the '80s with the recession
of 1981-82. If you wait for somebody to ring a bell or blow a
whistle before you invest, it's too late.''
   After years of being consulted and scrutinized by reporters, he
was asked, how does he appraise the way broadcasters and the press
cover the markets?
   ``The coverage is better now - much more knowledgeable and much
more detailed,'' he says. ``There's a tendency toward hype,
over-dramatizing what's going on. But the quality and extent of the
coverage is much improved.''

<HEAD>Hammer, Henson Provide a Lesson in Value of Human Assets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES M. KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Occidental Petroleum Corp. without Armand Hammer
becomes a takeover target. Henson Associates Inc. without Muppet
creator Jim Henson loses its appeal to Walt Disney Co.
   The lessons of the past week clearly demonstrate the value of
human assets in American business.
   On Tuesday, shares of Occidental leaped 9 percent as investors
began to speculate on the corporation's life after Hammer's death
at age 92. For years, conventional wisdom held that the company
would restructure or be acquired once Hammer departed.
   Hammer dominated the company and built it into the nation's 16th
largest corporation. Along the way, the company racked up big debts
and paid out healthy dividends to shareholders as it acquired
interests in a variety of businesses including energy, chemicals
and meat packing.
   Without its strong-willed chief, the company could narrow its
focus, lower its debts, cut the dividend, or be acquired in whole
or in part.
   Investors who snapped up the stock after Hammer died were
betting on a profit down the road from whatever fate awaited the
company. Contrarians, however, believed the opposite, seeing a soft
market for takeovers and a minefield of problems for Occidental's
new leadership.
   Whatever the hypothesis, the loss of Hammer was central to the
calculations.
   The collapse of the deal between Disney and Henson was similarly
rooted in a valuation of the late Henson's own talent and
influence.
   When Disney and Henson announced an agreement in principle for
the two creative empires to merge 18 months ago, Disney was
figuring Henson himself into the mix as much as Kermit the Frog and
Miss Piggy.
   When Henson died unexpectedly in May, the proposed combination
lost some luster.
   Henson's estate kept pushing for top dollar, but minus the
puppeteer himself, Disney balked at a price tag estimated at $150
million.
   Corporations have what's called a ``book value,'' commonly
described as the value of assets on the books, less liabilities.
Not included in that definition is the asset value - or liability -
of a company's leadership.
   Individuals, especially those with larger-than-life
personalities, can add to either side of the balance sheet.

<HEAD>RETAIL SALES: The News Is Still Bad, But Improving</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   With 10 days to go until Christmas, the news was still bad, but
getting better, for the nation's retailers.
   Figures from the government showed total retail sales were off
0.1 percent last month. Excluding automobiles, sales inched up 0.2
percent.
   That's not great by any means, but it was a better report card
for the retailers than most experts had expected.
   Anecdotal evidence showed business picking up around the
country. Storeowners said traffic was up, and manufacturers
supplying merchandise to stores were filling more orders.
   The industry was hoping to make up ground in the final days, but
worries about the economy were still scaring off some consumers. A
poll released by The Wall Street Journal and NBC News said nearly
half of those surveyed planned to spend less this Christmas. Only
one in 10 said they would spend more.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>OIL: Still Waiting for Gulf Solution</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Uncertainty also continued to plague the oil world. OPEC agreed
at its winter strategy meeting in Vienna, Austria, to keep pumping
oil in excess of established quotas, at least until the Persian
Gulf crisis is resolved.
   Ignoring the quotas could lead to an eventual glut of oil, but
the money has been too good to pass up during the crisis.
   Ministers of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries did get assurances from super-producer Saudi Arabia and
others to trim production once the crisis ends.
   Market traders of oil were likewise on the fence. Oil touched
lows at midweek not seen since the early days of the crisis, but
rose again at week's end over worries that diplomatic efforts aimed
at ending the crisis were faltering. At $26.50-$27 per barrel, the
price of crude still had a $5 ``war premium'' built in.
   A government report said energy prices on the wholesale level
moderated during November, but inflation was still percolating at a
6.9 percent annual rate, up from 4.9 percent last year.

<HEAD>DEALS: NCR Rejects AT&amp;T; Kerkorian Likes Chrysler</HEAD>

   On the dealmaking front, the board of computer maker NCR Corp.
unanimously rejected American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s
$90-a-share cash tender offer, calling the bid ``grossly inadequate
and unfair.''
   The move by AT&amp;T turned hostile after friendly discussions broke
down a week ago. AT&amp;T, meanwhile, lined up all the banking support
it needed to finance the $6.1 billion takeover.
   Chrysler Corp. said California billionaire Kirk Kerkorian had
acquired more than 9 percent of its outstanding stock, prompting
the automaker to bolster its antitakeover defenses.
   Kerkorian has built a fortune in the entertainment industry and
is known for other takeover forays.

<HEAD>MEDIA: Bad Times Cause CBS Move, Lower Earnings Projections</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   CBS Inc. announced a $2 billion plan to buy back stock from
shareholders to bolster confidence in the company. The stock has
sagged in recent weeks under the weight of its own dour earnings
projections, heavy spending on sports programming and a soft
advertising environment.
   Other media companies represented at an industry conference in
New York spent the week comparing notes on the disappointing year
ahead. Among the giants forecasting hard times through 1991 were
Gannett Co. Inc., The New York Times Co., and Dow Jones &amp; Co.
   The ad slump was mostly to blame, and by one forecast shared at
the conference, ad spending may only grow 4.6 percent next year,
the slowest pace in two decades.

<HEAD>AUTO SALES: Good Report But Gloomy Predictions</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The nation's automakers reported a 22.3 percent increase in car
and light truck sales during the first 10 days of December, but
industry executives offered dark predictions for 1991.
   Sales could drop from about 14 million to 13.5 million vehicles
next year, the lowest total since 1983, when the industry was
emerging from the last recession.
   Adding to the gloom for American companies was the introduction
of a new Honda station wagon to be produced at the Japanese
company's plant in central Ohio. The new entry adds a station wagon
version to the Accord line, already the hottest selling car in
America.

<HEAD>THRIFTS: Losses Double in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Despite efforts to shut down failed thrifts, losses at surviving
S&amp;Ls more than doubled in the July-September quarter, the
government said.
   Thrifts lost $631 million in the third quarter, compared with a
revised $302 million in the second quarter and $373 million in the
first. The flood of red ink was blamed on the real estate slump.
   Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association of California launched an
effort to recoup some of its losses, suing Michael Milken and
others tied to Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Columbia said it was enticed into bad junk-bond deals by Milken,
the convicted financier, and other Drexel officials.

   They are competitors turned

it the future of steel.
   Either way, it's accurate. Inland Steel Co. and Nippon Steel

building a 10-story, 21st century mill that symbolizes the changing
look of the industry.
   Big steel in the '90s means big partnerships. The United States
and Japan, old rivals, have become new allies, each looking to
profit as they breathe life into an industry flat on its back for
much of the last decade.
   ``The Japanese are helping rebuild our steel industry and we
should not be upset by that,'' said Richard Florida, a management
and public policy professor at Carnegie Melon University. ``The
Japanese get access to the American markets. Americans get the
technology and good jobs. It's a win-win-win situation.''
   It's a marriage for money, not love.
   The Japanese have poured about $7 billion into single or joint
steel ventures, almost all in the late '80s, Florida said.
Kawasaki, Sumitomo, Kobe and Nippon - the world's largest
steelmaker - are putting down roots on the industrial landscape,
welcomed by such American stalwarts as Armco, LTV, USX and Inland.
   Inland-Nippon's I-N Tek, the world's most modern cold-rolling
steel mill, and I-N Kote, a galvanizing facility that coats steel,
together have a $1 billion price tag.
   The partnerships seem an odd twist, considering that imports -
along with the strong dollar and recession - contributed to
America's steel decline in the 1980s. Japan was the No. 1 foreign
supplier through the decade. American companies bitterly complained
about Japanese dumping.
   ``There's a big irony to it,'' said John Jacobson, of AUS
Consultants in suburban Philadelphia. ``Many of the U.S. companies
have just had to grin and bear it. They've really had to change
their perception of the world.''
   ``Have we given up control? Certainly,'' he said. ``U.S.
management does not control its destiny like it used to. But its
destiny wasn't all that good. Their prospects have improved with
their investment. It's better to have half of something good than
all of something bad.''
   Steel, indeed, was in crisis in the early to mid-'80s. Mills
closed, towns died, the work force shrank by hundreds of thousands.
The industry lost $12 billion from 1982 to 1986, though it since
has rebounded.
   ``It was a fat, overweight industry that ran into a wall and
ended up in the hospital for a few years,'' Jacobson said. ``Now it
seems to be back on a better diet, slimmed down, a little more
competitive.''
   The Japanese interest is largely spurred by the desire to sell
steel to the growing number of Japanese auto companies in this
country. I-N Tek, for example, sells to four: Honda, Toyota,
Chrysler-Mitsubishi, Subaru-Isuzu.
   These partnerships are just part of a nationwide Japanese
investment explosion. Some 1,100 manufacturing plants with a
Japanese majority interest were established or under construction
in the United States by the end of 1988, the Japan Economic
Institute reported last year.
   Japanese companies have invested more than $25 billion in
rubber, autos, auto suppliers and steel, Florida said.
   That way, the Japanese avoid the expense of building new mills
alone and reduce political risks ``by `buying off' U.S. producers
who receive both up-front cash and a share of ongoing profits,''
said a study co-written by Florida this year.
   These investments, Florida notes, also provide a solution to
trade barriers that limit the amount of steel that can be imported;
the current level is 19.5 percent of the U.S. market.
   Still, some bemoan the trend.
   The Japanese ``look far out into the future,'' said Tom Jones, a
staff representative for the United Steelworkers of America. ``My
concern is American management is so devoted to ... immediate
returns to stockholders or the short-term bottom line that unless
we're very careful, the Japanese will simply one day wake up and
have them all for breakfast.''
   Inland needed help after a disastrous string of years, starting
with 1982's loss of $119 million, the first full-year loss since
the Depression. Three more bad years followed, with losses totaling
$336 million.
   By the mid-'80s, about 30 percent of Inland's facilities were
obsolete and the steelmaker was hearing it couldn't match the
quality of imports, said Frank Luerssen, chairman and chief
executive of Inland Steel Industries Inc., the parent company.
   Times were so terrible that Inland sold its Chicago
headquarters.
   But there was hope. Nippon's chairman already had expressed
interest in a joint project, and as a potential mate, the Japanese
company had an attractive dowry: lots of money and sophisticated
technology.
   After Luerssen saw Nippon's continuous cold-rolling mill turn
out steel coils faster and smoother than ever during a Japan visit
in 1984, he decided Inland needed one to be competitive.
   Initially, the steelmaker planned to buy the technology and
equipment and own the mill. But it was clear it couldn't do that
financially.
   Workers knew it, too.
   ``We saw the business go away. We saw the number of employees
continue to shrink,'' said Paul Rausch, president of Local 9231 at
I-N Tek, who formerly worked at Inland's steel-making plant,
Indiana Harbor Works. The labor force at Indiana Harbor dropped
from 24,500 to 14,500 during the last decade.
   In 1987, after protracted negotiations, the Inland-Nippon
partnership was announced. Inland has 60 percent of the
partnership, Nippon 40 percent. Japanese lenders provided the bulk
of the money to build the plant, which started production this
spring.
   I-N Tek, the nation's only continuous cold-rolling mill, uses a
process that slashes production time from 12 days to less than an
hour with a third of the workers.
   ``This is the 21st century mill. We just built it early,'' said
George Landsly, manager of administration.
   It is a high-tech marvel: computer rooms resemble air traffic
control towers, human hands rarely touch steel, backbreaking chores
are performed by machines that look like props from ``The
Terminator.''
   And the product is premium-quality steel, made from coils an &lsqb;
of a inch thick and 65 inches wide that are cleaned, compressed,
softened, flattened and finished, then inspected to meet orders for
cars, appliances and office furniture.
   ``You get a uniform product over and over again,'' Landsly said.
``It's almost like making cookies one at a time or making a batch
together, where they all taste the same.''

   A new cancer treatment using genetically
engineered molecules that aim extremely high doses of radiation at
cancerous tissue may double doctors' ability to destroy some
cancers, researchers say.
   Scientists at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center are
using the techniques to deliver the highest doses of radiation ever
directed at human cancer tissue in an attempt to cure.
   By attaching radioisotopes to monoclonal antibodies and
injecting them into patients, widespread cancers can be destroyed
with massive amounts of radiation that otherwise would be fatal.
   Antibodies are proteins formed by the body's immune system to
fight foreign substances, or antigens. Monoclonal antibodies are
genetically identical molecules, usually developed in mice, that
can be targeted at cancer cells.
   The Hutchinson radiolabeling research is unique in that the
scientists are using antibodies to which more radiation, in the
form of radioisotopes, has been attached than those used by any
other group.
   Researchers are still testing to find the highest level of
radioisotopes that can be used, said Irwin Bernstein, a professor
of pediatric oncology at the center and the University of
Washington.
   ``We hope to deliver twice the amount of radiation, and thus be
twice as efficient in destroying the cancer cells,'' said Rainer
Storb, a program director in transplantation biology.
   The researchers believe the procedures will enable them to treat
some advanced solid tumor cancers as well as leukemias and
lymphomas.
   The research is being done in collaboration with the University
of Washington and is supported by grants from the National
Institutes of Health.
   The trials are an outgrowth of the work of Dr. E. Donnall
Thomas, who performed the first human bone marrow transplant in
1956 and was awarded the Nobel Prize this year. Thomas is assistant
director of clinical research programs at the Hutchinson center.
   The radiolabeling treatment was developed because some lymphoma
and leukemia patients whose cancers were killed beyond detection
using standard bone marrow transplants had recurrences.
   The patients in the immunotherapy trials have malignant diseases
for which transplantation is the only cure.
   For lymphomas, radiolabeling has been used without additional
radiation or chemotherapy, while for leukemias it has been used in
conjunction with the more standard transplant procedures.
   That involves removing a patient's bone marrow, administering
massive full-body doses of radiation and chemotherapy - sometimes
greater than the amount given off by the Chernobyl nuclear accident
- and reinjecting the marrow. Bone marrow is killed by high doses
of radiation.
   Over the past two years, 11 patients have been treated for
lymphomas with monoclonal antibodies radiolabeled with as much as
one-half curie of I-131, a level of radiation that would be fatal
if the injection was not followed by a marrow transplant.
   But even at lower doses, no sign of the cancer could be detected
after treatment in most patients, Bernstein said.
   Three of the patients have had long-term remissions, while the
rest are in treatment or have relapsed.
   Five leukemia patients have been given the new treatment in
clinical trials that began last year. It is too early to reach any
conclusions for those patients, said Fred Applebaum, another
transplant program director.
   Another research project at the center is using monoclonal
antibodies to sift healthy stem cells in bone marrow from cancerous
cells in patients with solid tumor cancers that have spread widely.
Stem cells are precursors for white and red blood cells and
platelets.
   White blood cells were incubated with monoclonal antibodies made
in mice and goats. The resulting ``sandwich'' monoclonal antibody
binds to the normal stem cells when they are passed through a
column, said researcher William Bensinger.
   The technique allows the blood to be cleansed of any cancerous
cells, which may not be killed by radiation and chemotherapy. The
treated cells are reinjected to replace the patient's bone marrow.
   Nine patients with very advanced breast cancers and three with
neuroblastomas (tumors that usually afflict children) have been
treated using the technique. One breast cancer and one
neuroblastoma patient have survived.
   The others died of reactions to the chemotherapy or radiation or
of relapse, Bensinger said.
   He said he was unaware of similar experiments by other
researchers.
   The treatment ``has the potential to get rid of tumor cells and
ultimately may be a better way to get rid of tumor cells in bone
marrow,'' Bensinger said.
   The Hutchinson center is the world's largest cancer treatment
center using bone marrow transplants. It performs about 400 of them
annually.
   Research using monoclonal antibodies is also being conducted at
the National Institutes of Health in Washington, D.C., the
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Johns Hopkins in Baltimore
and the Cancer Chemotherapy Center in Tokyo, among others.

   East and West took big strides toward a lasting
peace in 1990 after four decades of nuclear enmity. But civil
strife and all-out war still convulsed corners of the world from
Liberia to South Africa, from Sri Lanka to the Soviet republics.
   As the year ends, the greatest conflagration may lie just over
the horizon - the showdown between U.S. and allied forces in Saudi
Arabia and the Iraqi invaders of Kuwait.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein sent his battle-hardened army
into neighboring Kuwait on Aug. 2 and quickly took control of the
oil-rich emirate. President Bush responded by deploying hundreds of
thousands of American troops to the Persian Gulf region as part of
a multinational defense force.
   A U.N. resolution authorized the use of force to oust Iraq from
Kuwait if Baghdad does not withdraw its army by Jan. 15. Saddam
showed no inclination to leave.
   Throughout 1990, Washington and Moscow worked to reduce the
nuclear and conventional arsenals they spent 45 years amassing to
confront each other. But the Middle East conflict threatened the
peace dividend both sides hoped would rescue their slumping
economies.
   In Europe, Soviet troops began pulling back from Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and East Germany after non-Communist
governments came to power in those nations for the first time since
the end of World War II.
   Leaders of the United States, Canada and all European nations
except Albania gathered in November and signed the ``Charter of
Paris'' uniting them in a commitment to democracy and economic
cooperation.
   But ethnic tensions, long suppressed under Communist rule,
triggered violence in Eastern Europe. Romanians clashed with
Hungarians in disputed areas of Romania, and simmering ethnic
conflicts and separatist demands threatened to dissolve Yugoslavia.
   In the Soviet Union, all 15 of the nation's republics took
advantage of Mikhail Gorbachev's open policies to seek sovereignty
from the central government.
   Ethnic and nationalist tensions in the Soviet south led to
clashes between Armenians and Azerbaijanis and between Uzbeks and
Kazaks, leaving hundreds dead.
   Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov ordered troops to shoot
anyone who tried to seize military installations. Gorbachev and
Yazov also cautioned against attempts by would-be breakaway
repubics to form their own armies and take control of nuclear
arsenals.
   In the Mideast, Israeli troops and paramilitary riot police
battled Palestinian activists as the Arab uprising against Israel's
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip showed no signs of
abating.
   On Oct. 8, Israeli riot police shot and killed 17 Palestinians
on Jerusalem's Temple Mount. It was the bloodiest incident during
Israel's 23-year occupation of Arab east Jerusalem.
   Lebanese militias began to withdraw from Beirut as hope emerged
that the 15{-year civil war might be drawing to a conclusion. The
move became possible after Syrian and Lebanese troops ousted
renegade Gen. Michel Aoun, killing hundreds of his Christian
loyalists.
   In Africa, the guerrilla insurgency in Liberia degenerated into
a tribal-based civil war that killed more than 10,000, mostly
civilians, some of whom died of starvation. A West African task
force was sent in to end the fighting and help organize an interim
government until elections could be held.
   Chad's government was overthrown Dec. 1, when President Hissen
Habre and his Cabinet fled as rebels advanced on the capital. In
October, the Rwandan army repulsed armed refugees attacking Rwanda
from neighboring Uganda.
   South African President F.W. de Klerk released anti-apartheid
leader Nelson Mandela from prison and began talks with the
previously banned African National Congress. The prospects of black
majority rule led to more clashes between Mandela's largely
Xhosa-based ANC and the Zulu-backed Inkatha movement. Hundreds were
killed in that black township fighting.
   In the south Asian island nation of Sri Lanka, Tamil separatists
ended a 13-month-long cease-fire and began a new round of fighting
in their 7-year-old insurrection for a separate Tamil homeland.
Thousands of civilians and soldiers were killed as government
forces repelled the guerrilla attacks and pushed into the Jaffna
peninsula, the rebel heartland.
   Elsewhere in south Asia, the long-simmering insurgency in
disputed Kashmir, sandwiched between Pakistan and India, exploded
into guerrilla warfare, leaving more than 1,550 people dead.
   Cambodia's Vietnamese-installed government and its guerrilla
enemies formed a national reconciliation body but squabbled over
who rules before elections.
   In Latin America, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro scored a stunning
upset victory in Nicaragua's February elections, ousting the
leftist Sandinistas from power after more than a decade of rule.
The anti-Sandinista Contras then laid down their arms.
   But El Salvador's long civil war ignited again, and other
leftist insurgencies raged in Peru and Colombia.

   The celebrities of the People columns amused and engrossed
Americans in 1990. But they didn't make the country go.
   Here's a look at a handful of ``non-People'' whose talents,
passions and hard work helped shape American life in 1990 - from a
Maryland laboratory and Alabama city hall to the sands of the
Persian Gulf:

   In 1985, Dr. W. French Anderson predicted that by 1986 doctors
would make the first attempt to insert replacement genes into
people with genetic defects. He was off by four years, but the
first human gene therapy did occur in 1990, and Anderson is given
much of the credit for bringing it about.
   In September, a 4-year-old girl with a rare, inherited immune
system disorder was given an infusion of genetically engineered
cells intended to correct her genetic disease.
   ``This is the first step in what probably will be a revolution
in medicine over the next two decades,'' said Anderson, 54, a
physician at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md.
   Anderson's unique combination of scientific ability and
organizational savvy helped him find a route through the
labyrinthine federal regulations that had to be satisfied before
the experiment could take place.

   The political awakening of Christian evangelicals barely missed
a beat when Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson stepped out of the
limelight.
   ``Even while the Moral Majority was closing up shop, James
Dobson was opening up shop,'' said Alan Hertzke, a University of
Oklahoma political scientist and author of ``Representing God in
Washington.''
   Dobson, 55, a radio psychologist and author, uses his $65
million media empire based in Pomona, Calif., to urge evangelicals
to action on issues such as abortion, home schooling and
pornography.
   His daily Focus on the Family radio show is heard by a million
people. The political research group he took over, the Family
Research Council, has become a powerful lobbying voice in
Washington.
  The arrest of a record store owner and two members of the 2 Live

   The Bush administration touts school ``choice'' as the key to
education reform. But many say a state assemblywoman from a black
district in Milwaukee was school choice's most potent champion in
1990.
   Fed up with inadequate funding and an entrenched school
bureaucracy, state Rep. Annette Polly Williams sponsored a
first-of-its-kind voucher plan that sent 400 poor children to
private schools with state money.
   Teacher unions and others in the educational establishment have
warned that plans like Milwaukee's could seriously harm public
education.
   But the 53-year-old Williams has sided with Bush in arguing that
competition is exactly the jolt needed to improve public schools.
   ``There's a belief among the bureaucrats in the public school
system that as long as you're poor, you're not expected to
achieve,'' said Williams, a Democrat who has represented her
district for the past decade.

   Jeffrey Kilpatrick worries about hundreds of Washington, D.C.,
kids from poor families who, because they suffer from emotional
disturbances, have been sent to special homes as far away as Texas
and Massachusetts.
   Kilpatrick thinks that's too far. So the 37-year-old attorney
has campaigned to help the city government open a home for troubled
youngsters, ages 6 through 12.
   To sell the idea, Kilpatrick has lobbied on Capitol Hill,
leafleted door to door and delivered a pitch at community meetings.
The battle has been all the tougher because for two years he has
been fighting AIDS.
   ``I don't always have a lot of energy and a couple of times I've
been pretty sick,'' he said. Yet he stubbornly refuses to quit.
   The city now has bought a house for the youngsters in
Georgetown. The site selection met neighborhood opposition, but
said Kilpatrick, ``I just want to see those kids running up the
steps of that home.''

   A day after Iraq invaded Kuwait, Maj. Gen. William ``Gus''
Pagonis was in Saudi Arabia arranging for the arrival of U.S.
troops.
   The man in hands-on charge of the most impressive U.S. military
deployment since World War II had to work out of a rented car in
those early days. One night he even slept in the back seat of his
``office.''
   But soon equipment, ammunition and troops by the tens of
thousands were pouring into Saudi Arabia under the watchful eye of
the 49-year-old Pennsylvanian, Army logistics chief for Operation
Desert Shield.
   With all the kitchens, tents, laundries and diversions shipped
along with the war materiel, the task was likened to moving a
mid-size city halfway around the world.
   ``We've delivered more soldiers and discharged more ships in a
short period of time than any armed forces in the world,'' Pagonis
said proudly.
   Now 200,000 fresh U.S. troops are joining the 230,00 already in
the Persian Gulf, and the logistics operation is expanding rapidly.
``It's going to be a lot easier this time,'' the general said.

   He objected and soon television sponsors, fearing protests and
boycotts, canceled their ads. Eventually, Shoal Creek made a black
businessman an honorary member and set in motion applications for
full membership by blacks.
   he controversy led the PGA and the United States Golf
Association to require clubs holding tournaments to have open

   ``I knew from a local standpoint I was stepping on many toes,''
said Bell, 41. ``Many people - blacks and whites - were upset that
this Pandora's Box was opened.
   ``Nationally, it has put pressure on advertisers to think twice

   One of the most celebrated criminal cases of 1990 - the
securities-violation prosecution of Michael Milken - fell into the
hands of one of the youngest federal judges.
   Kimba M. Wood, at 46 the youngest U.S. jurist in Manhattan,
handled the Milken affair with a veteran's aplomb and toughness,
before finally sentencing the deposed junk-bond king to 10 years in
prison, a stiff term that surprised many observers.
   Beforehand, the judge held an unusual hearing into Milken's
alleged crimes, opening up wounds the defense had hoped to close by
arranging a plea bargain for their client.
   In the end, she humbled the ex-billionaire, telling him he
should be ``removed from society'' for abusing ``his leadership
position.''
   Born in Port Townsend, Wash., Wood went on to study at the
Sorbonne in Paris, Connecticut College, the London School of

   Hyatt, a bearded, soft-spoken Southern California engineer,
battled the U.S. Patent Office for two decades before he finally

   News of the patent caused a stir in the computer industry, which
officially recognizes several Intel Corp. engineers as the

   Americans watched the American pastime in a new way in 1990, and
baseball-loving Jed Drake was the man behind it.
   Drake, 34, is coordinating producer of ESPN's major-league
baseball coverage. In the first season of a four-year deal, the
cable station emerged as the ``network of baseball,'' telecasting
161 regular-season games, providing blanket coverage in a way never
done before.
   ``What we have to remember is that our audience is going to
expect more from us,'' Drake said. ``We can't just have good
coverage. We have to have great coverage.''
   Access to live feeds from all ballparks enabled ESPN to switch
back and forth from stadium to stadium, to show the final minutes
of a no-hitter, for example. It was a technique the network
perfected in its years of covering the NCAA basketball tournament.
   Drake, a Boston University graduate, has been with ESPN for 10
years and won a cable ACE Award for his 1987 America's Cup
coverage.
   ``Everybody that's working on baseball has a love for the
game,'' Drake said. ``That's probably the glue that's going to hold
this project together.''

   DETROIT (AP) - Early-December sales of North American-made
vehicles rose 22.3 percent, but the increase came against a weak
period last year and doesn't reflect the true softness in the
market, automakers and analysts said.
   The 10 major companies making cars and light trucks in North
America said Thursday that sales during the Dec. 1-10 period this
year averaged 27,624 a day, compared with an average of 22,589
during the same time last year.
   Car sales were up 27.8 percent and truck sales rose 14.3 percent

revised $302 million in the second quarter and $373 million in the
first. the Office of Thrift Supervision said Thursday. The second

   The decline was blamed on the real estate slump afflicting many

   NEW YORK (AP) - Gannett Co., publisher of USA Today, said a
slump in advertising will mean its revenue and possibly its
earnings will be lower in 1990 than a year ago.
   The declines would be the first such year-to-year drops at
Gannett since the company went public 22 years ago and reflect what
experts say has been the slowest annual growth in overall ad

   Gannett was among a half-dozen major media companies that

   Despite recent layoffs and cutbacks that have
created apprehension among reporters, Dow Jones &amp; Co. employees
voted down a proposal to affiliate with a major union.
   Reporters, technicians, clerical workers and other personnel
voted 61 percent to 39 percent against affiliating with the
Communications Workers of America, an aggressive union that staged
four strikes last year.
   Organizers said Thursday they were unable to capitalize on a
mood of anger and fear over recent layoffs, bureau closings and
other cutbacks at The Wall Street Journal, the business newspaper
published by Dow Jones.
   ``In essence we were saying that we have a fair-weather union
and we are going into rough weather,'' said Ron Chen, a Journal
copy editor and president of an in-house union, the Independent
Association of Publishers' Employees. ``That message apparently did
not get across.''
   A total of 1,074 of 1,800 members of the in-house union, which
had supported affiliation, participated in the vote, rejecting it
by 655 to 419. Dow Jones employs 9,800.
   Dow Jones President Peter R. Kann said he was ``gratified'' by
the vote. He said it suggested workers ``didn't see what additional
benefit'' affiliation with a large union would bring to the
employees or the company.
   Dow Jones management had lobbied against the proposal, saying in
a letter to employees that their union dues would triple for some
workers by 1993 and that only 4.5 percent of the CWA's membership
were publishing employees.
   Dow Jones, hurt by the recession in the securities and
publishing industries, recently announced it was closing the
Journal's Philadelphia bureau and laid off reporters in Los
Angeles; Houston; Vancouver, British Columbia; New Dehli, India;
Brussels, Belgium; and Seoul, South Korea.
   At least 10 senior employees either have been forced or lured
into accepting early retirement buyouts. Several reporters said
they are fearful of further cuts and angered by the way Dow Jones
handled the layoffs.
   ``If you had a circumstance you thought would play to our
strength it was job security,'' said Douglas R. Sease, a Journal
financial markets reporter and head of the in-house union's
bargaining committee. ``Obviously we didn't get the kind of support
we thought we were going to get.''
   Leaders of the in-house union had argued that affiliation would
bring professional instead of part-time representation during a
difficult period.
   But employees said they were swayed in large part by the dues
increase and union choice. The CWA, which has 700,000 members, is
trying to expand in the newspaper industry. In addition to
communications workers and newspaper production employees, the
union represents editorial workers at several papers in the nited
States and Canada.
   ``They're not known as a strong newspaper union and I didn't see
what they could do for the editorial employees,'' said one reporter
who rejected affiliation and asked not to be named.

   The chorus of media companies singing the
earnings blues because of the advertising slump is growing louder
every day.
   Gannett Co. Inc., which publishes USA Today and 81 other daily
newspapers, said Thursday the slump will drag down revenues and
possibly earnings in 1990.
   The declines would be the first such year-to-year drops at
Gannett since the company went public 22 years ago and reflect what
experts say has been the slowest annual growth in overall ad
spending since 1975.
   The Arlington, Va.-based media concern was among a half-dozen
media companies that described for securities analysts the toll
that the weak advertising environment is taking on their earnings
expectations.
   ``The only question to ask is: how much worse are things going
to get?'' Richard D. Simmons, president of The Washington Post Co.,
told the annual PaineWebber media outlook conference.
   To varying degrees, the slump was also cited for expectations of
either earnings declines or slower growth at The New York Times
Co., Affiliated Publications Inc. and Dow Jones &amp; Co. A.H. Belo
Corp. said the ad slump would mean lower earnings at least in the
first part of 1991.
   Gannett, which also has interests in television, radio and
outdoor advertising, expects revenue of $3.4 billion to $3.5
billion in 1990, said Douglas McCorkindale, vice chairman and chief
financial officer. That would be down from $3.52 billion a year
ago.
   McCorkindale did not predict earnings for the year but noted
that many analysts were estimating profits at $2.35 a share, down
from $2.47 a share in 1989. He told the group that estimate ``seems
reasonable'' and cautioned against guessing much more. It would be
its first such profit decline as well.
   The company also hinted that USA Today may fall short in 1990 of
posting its first profitable year as Publisher Cathleen Black said
ad volume fell 7.5 percent while ad revenue edged up 1.4 percent.
   Nonetheless, John J. Curley, chairman, president and chief
executive, said USA Today will decide by yearend on launching a
weekly sports tabloid.
   At The Washington Post, Simmons said earnings per share will
drop to $14.25 in 1990 from $15.50 in 1989 and decline again in
1991.
   He said the soft advertising market produced double-digit
declines in classified and retail advertising volume in the
flagship Washington Post and that three of the company's four TV
stations would have lower results.
   Walter Mattson, president and chief operating officer at the
Times, said earnings from continuing operations would be between 80
cents and 90 cents a share in 1990 compared with 87 cents a share a
year ago. He said earnings would be lower in 1991 but declined to
be more specific.
   Mattson said he expects an 8 percent decline in ad volume at the
Times, that ad rates will rise about 6.5 percent and the company
would try to boost circulation revenue. He declined to comment on
whether prices would be raised.
   Results from the company's 35 regional newspapers will be up
next year, he said, while magazines will have a smaller operating
loss and operating results from broadcasting and information
services will be flat.
   William Taylor, chairman of Boston-based Affiliated
Publications, said he expected earnings from continuing operations
would be down significantly in 1990 from 63 cents a share in 1989
and flat in 1991. He did not elaborate, but industry analysts have
estimated earnings at 35 cents to 40 cents a share.
   He said the company intends to raise the price of daily copies
of The Boston Globe to 50 cents from 35 cents in areas 30 miles
outside the city.
   Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal and owner of the
Telerate information services company, said it expects earnings
will fall to $1.02 to $1.06 a share from $1.52 a share in 1989
excluding a onetime gain.
   Peter Kann, president and chief operating officer, said business
was ``pretty lousy,'' with financial advertising off sharply and
demand for Telerate machines at thrifts and brokerages down.
   The company adopted a cost-containment plan recently that is
expected to hold expenditures to 1990 levels next year. Kenneth
Burenga, general manager and senior vice president, said the
company expects to have 400 fewer employees at yearend than it at
the start of 1990, when it employed about 10,000.
   The cuts include about 150 employees of the Journal, he said.
   Also Thursday, Dow Jones employees rejected a move to affiliate
with a big communications' workers union by a vote of 61 percent to
39 percent. The company had opposed the affiliation.
   Belo, the Dallas-based newspaper and broadcasting company,
expects higher earnings this year but the ad slump will mean lower
earnings in early 1991.
   James P. Sheehan, president and chief operating officer, said
analysts have estimated that it will earn $1.35 to $1.45 a share in
1990 and said the company will ``be in that range'' before a
special onetime gain.

   Sales of North American-made cars and light
trucks jumped 22.3 percent earlier this month, but analysts say the
rise doesn't reflect the actual weakness in the auto market.
   ``Deteriorating confidence in the economy is producing a
self-perpetuating downward cycle,'' said senior economist Tom Webb
of the National Automobile Dealers Association in McLean, Va.
   The 10 major automakers building cars and trucks in North
America said Thursday their vehicles sold at an average daily rate
of 27,624 during the Dec. 1-10 period compared with a rate of
22,589 during the same time last year.
   Car sales were up 27.8 percent and truck sales rose 14.3 percent
during the period compared with a year ago, which was the weakest
selling period of 1989.
   Sales of domestically made cars by General Motors Corp., Ford
Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. rose 29.3 percent, compared with
year-ago levels, while sales of North American built cars with
Japanese company nameplates increased 14.2 percent.
   The Big Three held 91 percent of the domestic car market.
   The seemingly large increase didn't impress auto analyst Mary
Anne Sudol of Fitch Investors Service Inc. in New York.
   ``The news out of Motown is not too terrific,'' she said.
``Consumers are putting rubber bands over their wallets and cutting
up their plastic (credit cards).''
   A more accurate picture emerges from the sales rate for the
entire year. Sales of North American-made cars and trucks between
Jan. 1 and Dec. 10 this year were running 3.1 percent behind last
year, with car sales down 3.1 percent and truck sales off 3.3
percent.
   The auto industry, which has slipped into a recession, watched
its total sales plunge in November, when fleet orders which had
inflated October sales numbers dried up.
   ``The comparisons are against a disastrous year-ago period.''
Webb said. ``True demand, absent the artificial prop of fleet
deals, remains weak, and our normally upbeat dealers are becoming
almost as pessimistic as consumers.''
   One unusual number in Thursday's reports was a 31.6 percent
decline in sales of Honda Motor Co. Ltd.'s North American-made
cars. Spokesman Mike Spencer attributed the decline to the overall
weakness in the industry. For the entire year, Honda's sales are up
22.3 percent against last year.
   Ford said its early December vehicle sales rose 32.5 percent,
buoyed by hefty increases of 32.2 percent and 32.6 percent,
respectively, in car and truck sales. Ford spokesman Joel Pitcoff
said a sales contest for dealers expired Dec. 10.
   For the year, Ford's combined car and truck sales were down 7
percent.
   GM's 28.5 percent increase in early December car sales combined
with an 11.6 percent rise in truck sales for a 22.2 percent
increase in vehicle sales. So far this year, GM's combined vehicle
sales were running 3.7 percent below last year's rate.
   Chrysler said a 13.2 percent decrease in its early-December
truck sales rate was offset by a 25.4 percent rise in car sales,
resulting in a 4.7 percent increase in vehicle sales during the
period this year over last year.
   Chrysler's year-to-date car and truck sales were running 13.3
percent behind last year's rate.

Systems announced.
   The equipment will be gradually phased in over the next 18
months to GTE Mobile markets in California, Florida, Hawaii,
Oregon, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Texas.
   ``We are changing out our existing network-related equipment
used to send and receive cellular communications by various mobile
phone users in our systems from Motorola to AT&amp;T,'' Jeff Keller,
spokesman for Houston-based GTE Mobilnet, said Thursday.
   GTE Mobilnet, part of the GTE Mobile Communications Group,
provides cellular telecommunications services and products in 46
metropolitan service areas and 10 rural service areas in 14 states.
   Tampa, Fla., will be the first city to receive the new
equipment, whose total value is about $600 million, by June 1991.

   The Dodge Daytona Shelby and Dodge Caravan are
close in price but far apart when it comes to insurance costs,
according to one insurer's annual rating of more than 200 domestic
and foreign vehicles.
   The staid Caravan minivan is among the cheapest vehicles to
insure in the $10,000-to-$15,000 price range, and the sporty Shelby
is among the costliest, the Allstate Insurance Co. said Thursday.
   Three other Chrysler Corp. minivans - the Dodge Grand Caravan,
Plymouth Voyager Turbo and Plymouth Grand Voyager GT - and the
Chrysler Fifth Avenue also ranked among the 10 models with ``much
below average'' insurance costs in their respective price
categories, Allstate said.
   The list was rounded out by the Subaru Justy, Suzuki Swift,
Toyota Tercel, Ford LTD Wagon and the Volvo 240.
   In addition to the Shelby, some of the cars rated costliest to
insure in their respective price classes were the Ford Escort GT,
Geo Tracker, Chevrolet Camaro IROC-Z and the BMW 750 series.
   The ratings reflect the type of damage a car will suffer in a
crash, repair costs and the car's potential for theft and break-in,
Allstate said in a statement from its headquarters in Northbrook, a
Chicago suburb.
   Allstate compiled the lists from its experience with collision
and comprehensive claims on 1989 and 1990 model cars in 45 states.
   Vehicles with ``much below average'' insurance costs generally
had ratings that were 25 percent to 30 percent below the average
for their price group, said Allstate spokesman Mike LaMonica.
   Those with ``much above average'' costs had ratings that were 25
percent to 50 percent above the average for their price group, he
said.
   Chrysler's minivans were about 50 percent below average in the
collision and comprehensive categories, LaMonica said.
   He said the collision data indicate the vehicles withstand
crashes better than others in their price categories. The
better-than-average experience with comprehensive insurance claims
reflect relatively low theft and vandalism rates.
   Caravans and Voyagers ``are just not popular theft items,''
LaMonica said.
   Demographics also factor into the ratings, said Allstate
spokeswoman Kathleen Hogan. Owners of Chrysler minivans, for
example, might tend to be families who live in relatively low-crime
areas and drive carefully because they have children in the car,
she said.
   Chrysler, the No. 3 domestic automaker, sells more minivans than
another other manufacturer but its dominance is slipping.
   Chrysler has a tradition of working with insurers to ``design in
features to make it easier for crash repair and protection,'' said
Tom Jakobowski, a company spokesman.

<HEAD>Commodity Groups Vying for Soviet Business Under New Credit Line</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>

<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the Soviet Union uses its new $1 billion
credit line, every U.S. commodity group hopes it will be on the
shopping list.
   If they wanted to, the Soviets could use it to buy more than 400
million bushels of U.S. wheat, which would be most of the entire
Kansas crop this year.
   Or all of the corn grown in Ohio, or all the soybeans produced
in Missouri and Mississippi. But there is also rice, dairy products
and dozens of other possibilities.
   ``Wheat could be the majority of it, I would think,'' said Barry
Jenkins of the National Association of Wheat Growers. ``But there's
going to be people lined up along with us.''
   Soybeans and other commodities such as corn, oats, barley, rice
and dairy products also are clamoring for attention, he said
Thursday.
   ``We may have something going for us, because they need some
flour real quick,'' Jenkins said. ``That's going to help, and flour
is a value-added product. That helps the wheat farmer and yet keeps
some of the money home.''
   Citing the ``tough times, the difficult times'' facing the
Soviet people, President Bush announced Wednesday he was waiving,
through June 1991, longstanding trade restrictions and handed
Moscow credit lines of $1 billion for farm products and $300
million for manufactured goods.
   Ironically, the grain trade had expected an even larger credit
line for the Soviets so the news of the $1 billion was bearish on
the market.
   Grain futures were sharply lower Thursday on the Chicago Board
of Trade. One analyst said the credit package was disappointing and
that traders had expected $1.5 billion to $3 billion, the level
urged earlier by Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   The Agriculture Department will work with Soviet officials to
decide details of the credit package, including schedules for
financing and repayment. USDA underwrites the loans, which are made
by private lenders under the department's export credit programs.
   Theoretically, if a four-way split could be arranged, with each
interest group getting about $250 million of the pie, it could mean
the sale of about 105 million bushels of wheat, based on a recent
U.S. farm price average of $2.39 per bushel.
   Actual selling prices would be higher than the farm prices,
however, since transportation charges to move grain from inland
points to port loading facilities must be computed, too.
   On the same basis, a $250 million share would account for more
than 114 million bushels of corn at an average farm price of $2.19
per bushel.
   About 45 million bushels of soybeans could bought for $250
million at the recent average U.S. farm price of $5.51 per bushel.
   The remaining $250 million might be used to buy miscellaneous
grains such as rice, oats and barley; dairy products, meat and
various processed food items.
   The Soviet Union has been buying large quantities of U.S. grain
since the early 1970s. In recent years, the purchases have been
under long-term agreements that commit both countries to minimum
annual levels.
   In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the Soviets bought 20.3
million metric tons of U.S. grain, including almost 16.5 million
tons of corn and 3.8 million tons of wheat.
   That was the equivalent of 650 million bushels of corn and 140
million bushels of wheat - roughly $1.4 billion worth of corn at
today's farm prices and $335 million worth of wheat.
   In all, last year's farm export value to the Soviet Union was
reported by USDA at more than $2.98 billion for all commodities,
down from $3.29 billion in 1988-89.
   Without the credit line, the Soviet Union was projected by USDA
to purchase about $2 billion worth of farm commodities this fiscal
year, down from more than $2.98 billion in the year that ended
Sept. 30 and almost $3.3 billion in 1988-89.
   At least part of the $1 billion credit will be used for
commodities the Soviets had already planned to buy in 1990-91, so
it is conjecture at this point to say what the final purchase level
may be.
   Exports are vital to American grain farmers, particularly wheat
producers whose crops are far in excess of domestic food needs.
   A large harvest this year - more than 2.74 billion bushels - is
adding to the U.S. surplus and holding down market prices.
   Out of the 1990 harvest, only 745 million bushels - about 27
percent of the total wheat output - will be needed as food. Even
with an increase in using wheat to feed livestock, inventories will
increase by the time another harvest is ready in 1991.

   Everybody and his dog can now munch tropical
treats being pitched to consumers as the new way to save shrinking
rain forests.
   Sales of such products as ice cream, mixed nuts and peanut
brittle for pooches are beginning to channel money from
environmentally conscious customers in the United States to the
impoverished inhabitants of the distant forests.
   So far, the products are heavily dependent on nuts for snacks.
But promoters are hoping to expand to a broader range of consumer
goods like soaps, cosmetics and furniture polish.
   The idea is to make sure that the world's rain forests are worth
more standing - and producing sustainable harvests - than cut for
timber or cleared for pasture.
   ``This by itself is not going to save the world's rain
forests,'' said Jason Clay, an anthropologist who has become an
importer of forest nuts, oils and fruits. ``But this can become an
important part of saving the rain forests and other fragile
ecosystems.''
   Clay is research director of Cultural Survival Inc. in
Cambridge, Mass., a non-profit group set up in 1972 to promote land
rights and alternative development schemes for indigenous peoples
in the Third World.
   The World Resources Institute estimated recently that 40 million
to 50 million acres of tropical forests are vanishing each year, a
pace that could wipe them out by the end of the century.
Environmentalists say this is likely to accelerate global warming,
because the forests soak up some of the world's production of
carbon dioxide.
   Scientists say the rain forests also are valuable as a home to
an abundance of plant, animal and insect species that live nowhere
else, some of which could prove useful in ways no one today can
imagine. Many are likely to become extinct as their habitat
shrinks.
   In 1989, Cultural Survival got into the business of promoting
trade in forest products as a way to get money into the hands of
the people they were trying to help.
   It is now selling imports, mostly Brazil nuts and cashews, to 17
companies currently marketing products in the United States -
including Rainforest Crunch and Bowser Brittle. It also has
provided samples to 75 companies for product development, Clay said
in a telephone interview.
   ``In hand, we have about $4.1 million in orders for 1991,'' Clay
said. ``We estimate that within five years we're going to be doing
more than $50 million worth of business.''
   Besides creating new income for people living in the forest,
Cultural Survival is plowing its profits back into projects to
strengthen native groups, producer co-ops and other local
organizations, including rubber tappers.
   So far, most of its work has been in Brazil, bu  it is expanding
into Bolivia and Peru and has bought some dried fruit from Honduras
and Belize, honey and beeswax from Zambia, jams and jellies from
the Philippines and other products from Ecuador, Colombia and
Botswana.
   Cultural Survival's biggest customer is Community Products, set
up by Ben Cohen, co-founder of Ben and Jerry's Homemade ice cream.
It produces Rainforest Crunch, both as candy for direct sale and as
an ingredient in Ben and Jerry's Rainforest Crunch ice cream.
   ``The concept is a really powerful one,'' said Martha Broad,
co-manager of Community Products, which is based in Montpelier, Vt.
Customers like the taste, but ``they're also excited that we're
helping the people in the rain forest.''
   In 1990, 300,000 pounds of cashews and Brazil nuts went into
Rainforest Crunch, Ms. Broad said, adding that a new product is
coming: chocolate chip Brazil nut cookies.
   Then there's Bowser Brittle, a concoction of rain forest
cashews, vanilla extract, wheat germ, flour, eggs and peanuts with
a label telling buyers they ``contribute to the saving of the rain
forest.''
   ``The dogs seem to like it. It's one of our two top sellers,''
said Teri Goodman, a partner in Dandy Doggie, a San Francisco-based
manufacturer of dog treats.
   Randy Hayes, head of the San Francisco-based Rainforest Action
Network, said environmental activists see marketing of forest
products as a necessary part of a strategy to save the forests.
   ``There's a common misconception that the tropical rain forest
is unoccupied by humans,'' Hayes said.
   In addition, he said, such products as Rainforest Crunch reach
people unlikely to read ecology magazines or join environmental
groups, but who may take an interest in the world's threatened
forests.
   ``There's been too much preaching to the choir,'' he said. ``The
environmental movement has sadly become a special interest group.
This is an excellent way of reaching out to other segments of
society.''

   Savings and loans associations could begin
recovering by late next year if the nation's economic slump is mild
and brief, but the industry would bleed red ink for years if the
downturn is sharp and long, economists say.
   Timothy Ryan, director of the government's Office of Thrift
Supervision, blamed a near-doubling of losses at privately held
S&amp;Ls on slumping real estate markets in many areas of the country.
   S&amp;Ls lost $631 million in the July-September quarter, compared
with $302 million in the second quarter and $373 million in the
first, the thrift office said Thursday.
   ``As long as the real estate slump continues, the thrift
industry will have a tough time improving performance,'' Ryan said.
   Analyst Donald Crowley of Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods in New York
said the industry's losses could begin to decline as early as late
next year.
   ``If projections for a short and shallow recession prove true,
we will probably see the worst of the thrift numbers sometime in
1991,'' he said. ``If the recession is deeper than that, the losses
will accelerate over the next couple years.''
   ``We will have at least two quarters of fairly disheartening
numbers before we see anything better,'' said Martin Regalia, chief
economist for the National Council of Savings Institutions.
   ``If we get into a steep recession, then we have a whole
different set of problems,'' he said.
   The third-quarter deterioration among solvent institutions
occurred even though the government has been closing down the worst
institutions. At the end of September, there were 2,389 privately
run S&amp;Ls, 208 fewer than at the beginning of the year.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the House Banking
Committee, said the report shows the cost of the savings and loan
crisis, estimated by the Bush administration at $90 billion to $130
billion, is still increasing.
   ``The recession has clearly snuffed out whatever light there was
at the end of the S&amp;L tunnel,'' he said. ``It is still going to be
a long, hard haul before the taxpayer emerges from this deep
hole.''
   Regalia called on regulators to more quickly eliminate insolvent
S&amp;Ls.
   ``It's quite clear that keeping defunct institutions in the
market worsens the environment for solvent institutions,'' he said.
   The thrift office considers 218 of the 2,389 privately run
thrifts all but certain to fail and an additional 356 S&amp;Ls with
poor earnings as marginal.
   Ryan told Congress earlier this week that his office would pick
up the pace of thrift closures starting next month to seven or
eight a week from two or three a week.
   Losses for the 206 institutions already seized by the government
but still operating at the end of September were not released. They
likely will be made available next week by the Resolution Trust
Corp.

<HEAD>Vista Chemical Merges With German Company in $590 Million Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vista Chemical Co. has agreed to be acquired in a
$590 million cash tender offer by the German energy and chemical
company RWE-DEA.
   RWE-DEA will offer to buy all of Vista's outstanding common
shares for $55 per share, according to a definitive agreement
signed by both companies.
   The tender offer will begin by next Wednesday, they said.
   ``This merger agreement, which was consummated on an entirely
friendly basis, not only provides the best value for Vista
shareholders, but also represents a sound and exciting future for
our employees,'' John D. Burns, Vista's chairman, president and
chief executive officer, said Thursday.
   Burns said that as part of the RWE group, Vista will be able
``to implement all appropriate investment projects designed to
strengthen and enhance our joint operations.''
   Houston-based Vista produces commodity and specialty chemicals
used in a variety of products such as household laundry detergents,
shampoos, cosmetics, automobile trim and fittings, vinyl packaging
materials, home siding and wire and cable coatings.
   Vista's earned $63.3 million for the 1990 year ending Sept. 30
on sales of $719 million. The company, formed in 1984, has about
1,850 employees and owns or leases nine principal manufacturing and
production facilities.
   RWE-DEA, formerly known as Deutsche Texaco AG, is involved in
oil refining, marketing, exploration and production of oil and
natural gas either directly or through subsidiaries. The
Hamburg-based company, which has about 6,200 employees, also
manufactures a wide range of petrochemical basics and chemical
products.
   For the fiscal year ending Dec. 31, 1989, RWE-DEA had a net
income of $120 million.
   RWE-DEA is an independent operating subsidiary of RWE AG, a
publicly held holding company that is involved in electricity,
mining, oil and chemicals, machinery, construction and waste
management through its six subsidiaries. RWE AG owns more than 99
percent ot RWE-DEA's stock.
   ``The combination of Vista and RWE-DEA provides a unique
opportunity to expand significantly into the global chemicals
market,'' said Armin Schram, RWE-DEA's chairman.
   ``We do not anticipate that the transaction will result in any
significant changes in Vista's structure of operation,'' he said,
adding that no layoffs are anticipated, and Vista plans to keep its
corporate headquarters in Houston.
   The $590 million offer is expected to be completed by early next
year, and the merger should be accomplished on July 1, 1991. At
least two-thirds of the common stock must be tendered.
   Vista cannot solicit takeover proposals, but the company may
withdraw its recommendation of the tender offer and terminate the
merger agreement if it receives a better proposal from a third
party.

   UtiliCorp United Inc. said it would pay
$346 million for the electricity utility operations of Centel
Corp., marking the largest acquisition in UtiliCorp's six-year
expansion.
   The deal would add 136,000 electricity customers in Kansas and
Colorado to UtiliCorp's operations. UtiliCorp, based in Kansas
City, provides gas and electric service to customers in eight
states and British Columbia.
   The transaction requires approval from state and federal
regulators.
   ``We have had an interest in the Centel property for some time
because it enables us to further balance our electric and gas
operations and our summer and winter peaking sources of revenue,''
said UtiliCorp Chairman and President Richard C. Green Jr.
   Chicago-based Centel said in August that it wanted to sell its
electricity properties to the highest bidder and concentrate on its
telecommunications operations. Centel provides local exchange
service to more than 1.6 million customers and operates cellular
communications franchises in 15 states.
   In Kansas, Centel serves 65,000 customers in Dodge City,
Concordia, Great Bend and other communities in central and
southwest Kansas.
   Under the deal, UtiliCorp will pay Centel $210.5 million in cash
and pick up $21.3 million of Centel's liabilities.
   In addition, Centel's 8 percent interest in the Jeffrey Energy
Center in Kansas will be picked up by a financial institution or
insurance company for $114 million, Green said. Jeffrey comprises
three coal-fired generating plants 30 miles northwest of Topeka.
   UtiliCorp will pay $12.4 million a year to lease Centel's share
of the facility. At the end of 25 years UtiliCorp will recover
Centel's interest in the facility at market value, Green said.
   Excluding the latest deal, UtiliCorp has invested $420.8 million
in acquiring regulated utilities and $390 million to acquire
unregulated properties since 1984.
   Green said that he would like to make about $700 million in
acquisitions in 1991 to sustain UtiliCorp's growth and continue
diversifying its revenue.
   Green told securities analysts that UtiliCorp expects record
financial results for the fourth quarter and 1990.
   UtiliCorp said it expects to earn $58.2 million, or $2.10 a
share, in 1990, compared with $48.3 million, or $2.04 a share, in
1989.
   For the fourth quarter, which ends Dec. 31, UtiliCorp expects to
earn $20.3 million on $224 million in revenue, compared with
earnings of $13.9 million on $237 million in revenue a year
earlier.

   Ashton Tate Corp. cannot claim copyrights to
its popular dBase software because the company failed to disclose
the program was based on one developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion
Lab, a judge ruled.
   The JPL program is in the public domain, and U.S. District Judge
Terry Hatter's ruling Thursday could make one of the most widely
used computer programs in the world available to anyone without
charge.
   ``We're surprised and alarmed,'' said Ashton Tate President
William Lyons.
   He said the ruling is wrong and the company will ask Hatter to
reconsider. Ashton Tate will appeal if Hatter does not change it,
Lyons said.
   It appeared unlikely the federal judge would do so because his
brief ruling was so strongly worded.
   ``This was not an unclear document in regards to what the judge
wanted to do, although it may be a little unclear about why he did
it,'' said Steve Hess, a specialist in personal computers with
Creative Strategies Research International, a consulting and market
research company in Santa Clara.
   Hess said if the ruling stands, it likely will be the end of
Ashton Tate, which built its fortunes around dBase, a product that
sorts, retrieves, and indexes huge quantities of information.
   The ruling may also open the door for additional challenges to
copyrights issued to cmputer companies that did not entirely
disclose to the U.S. Copyright Office all similar predecessors to
their products, Hess said.
   ``This thing could have some very wide implications,'' Hess
said.
   Hatter's ruling stems from a copyright infringement lawsuit
Ashton Tate filed in Los Angeles against competitors Fox Software
Inc. and The Santa Cruz Operation Inc., accusing them of selling
software that mimics dBase. Hatter dismissed the suit.
   Former JPL employee Wayne Ratliff devised dBase, and Ashton Tate
essentially developed as a way to market it. Over a decade, Ashton
Tate copyrighted various updated versions of dBase, including one
bug-ridden version two years ago that nearly caused the downfall of
the company.
   In his written ruling, Hatter said that when Ashton Tate applied
for a copyright, it failed to mention the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration-JPL link.
   Ashton Tate ``repeatedly failed to disclose material information
to the United States Copyright Office,'' Hatter's ruling said.

<HEAD>Newsstand Operators Sue Daily News Drivers' Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newsstand operators sued the striking Daily News
drivers' union, saying it encouraged a campaign of violence to stop
vendors from selling the paper.
   Two newsstand owners filed the class-action lawsuit Thursday in
U.S. District Court in Manhattan on behalf of the city's
approximately 12,000 news vendors.
   It seeks more than $30 million in damages from the Newspaper &amp;
Mail Deliverers' Union of New York and its president, Michael
Alvino. The drivers union is one of nine that have been on strike
against the paper since Oct. 25.
   Theodore Kheel, an adviser who often has spoken for the striking
unions, said he had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment on
it.
   The complaint alleges that the drivers union ``has carried out a
campaign of violence, threats and intimidation that has created
fear among the news dealers for their safety and the safety of
their property.''
   The lawsuit seeks damages from the union for alleged violations
of antitrust and labor laws and the Racketeer Influenced, Corrupt
Organizations Act.
   The Daily News brought a similar racketeering lawsuit against
the unions last month. Both suits detail allegations of ``attempted
murder, arson, assault and vandalism'' and accuse the drivers'
union of ``a long history of racketeering.''
   Plaintiffs in the vendors' lawsuit are Kishor Mehta, who
operates 11 newsstands in Co-op City, a large development in the
Bronx, and Nasir Naveed, who owns a stand in Brooklyn.

<HEAD>Business Inventories Rose 0.4 Percent in October</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business inventories rose 0.4 percent in
October, the government reported today, a moderate increase that
analysts say is unlikely to accelerate already growing
unemployment.
   The Commerce Department said inventories held on shelves and
backlots totaled a seasonally adjusted $813.9 billion, up from
$810.8 billion in September.
   At the same time, the department said business sales outpaced
inventory growth, rising 0.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted
$551.8 billion. Sales had fallen 0.8 percent the previous month to
$547.2 billion.
   The activity pushed the ratio of inventories-to-sales down to
1.47 from 1.48 in September. The ratio means it would take 1.47
months to exhaust the backlog of goods at the October sales pace.
   Many economists do not consider a 1.47 ratio to be excessively
high. But a larger increase could be worrisome since a major rise
in inventories in relation to sales could cause growing production
cutbacks and job layoffs as businesses attempt to sell off the
backlog.
   Even with the low inventory accumulation, industrial production
still fell 1.7 percent in November, the Federal Reserve reported
today. At the same time, 200,000 factory jobs were lost that month,
according to Labor Department statistics.
   ``The pace of accumulation has been and remains extremely
conservative by historical standards,'' economists at Fuji
Securities Inc. in Chicago wrote in their weekly newsletter
Perspectives. ``It is far too slow to jeopardize the
already-weakened economy with a purge of unwanted inventories.''
   Although inventories grew in all three categories, overall
growth slowed from 0.7 percent in August. And the revised 0.4
percent increase in September was smaller than the 0.5 percent
first reported.
   Manufacturing inventories edged up 0.1 percent while wholesalers
posted a 0.2 percent gain. On the retail level, however, the
accumulation rose 1.0 percent.
   At the same time, manufacturers' sales jumped 1.7 percent. Sales
on the wholesale level rose 0.1 percent and on the retail level,
0.2 percent.

   The stock market lapsed into a broad decline
today, faced with disappointing inflation news.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 9.41 to 2,604.95
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 294 up, 706
down and 485 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 19.68 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The day got off to a rocky start when the Labor Department
reported that the producer price index rose 0.5 percent in
November.
   That came as an unpleasant surprise to traders who had been
expecting a considerably smaller increase, given a recent letup in
the rise of oil prices.
   Separate government reports showed a 1.7 percent drop in
industrial production last month, and a slowing in the operating
rate of the nation's factories, mines and utilities to 80.9 percent
of capacity from 82.4 percent in October.
   Analysts said tht mixture of news provided stock-market
investors with little encouragement about the outlook for the
economy and corporate profits.
   General Motors dropped { to 33} and Ford Motor was down &lsqb; at
25|. The stocks of both auto giants have been trading this week at
their lowest levels in more than two years.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.67 to 179.44. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .64 at 306.07.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 7.92 to
2,614.36.
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines on the NYSE, with
782 up, 750 down and 495 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 162.11 million shares, against 182.27
million in the previous session.

<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines has become the fourth carrier
to join a freebie war that is spreading through the sagging air
travel industry.
   ``Northwest's promotion parallels offers by other airlines but
is the only one to include free travel to Europe and Hawaii,'' the
carrier said in a statement Thursday.
   Delta Air Lines fired the opening salvo early this week,
offering free flights or first-class upgrades to anybody who
completes eight ``segments'' of travel.
   A segment generally means any separate flight or connecting
flight that costs more than a minimum amount.
   Late Thursday, American Airlines and United Airlines announced
their own programs offering free flights, to be taken later next
year, for anybody who racks up either eight segments of flight or
three round trips.
   American acknowledged its offer was in response to Delta, and
United acknowledged it was responding to the other two.
   Northwest's program also requires three roundtrips or eight
segments, spokeswoman Christy Clapp said this morning.
   Airlines typically rush to match cheap fares and promotions
offered by their competitors for fear they could otherwise lose
passengers.
   Analysts have said the latest deal seems to be getting a head
start on promotions that generally come out after the winter
holiday season, as the sluggish months of January and February set
in.
   They said the airlines need to avoid offering broad deals that
are too good for passengers or run the risk of compounding troubles
brought on by high fuel prices and sluggish demand for air travel.

   Wholesale prices rose 0.5 percent in November,
the government said today, a worrisome number but mild in
comparison to the three-month burst of inflation after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait sent energy costs spiraling.
   ``It's another terrible number. We have not gotten rid of
inflation,'' said economist Michael K. Evans, a Washington
consultant.
   Faced with the disappointing news, the stock market suffered a
broad decline in early trading today. Most economists had
anticipated a wholesale price rise of 0.1 percent to 0.3 percent.
   The seasonally-adjusted November rise in the Labor Department's
Producer Price Index for finished goods, which measures inflation
one stop short of retail, follows three months of steeper
increases.
   Prices rose 1.1 percent in October and August and 1.6 percent in
September. The November increase, although tame by comparison,
still translates into a 6.1 percent annual inflation rate.
   In another economic report today, the Federal Reserve said
industrial production weakened in November for the third straight
month, falling back 1.7 percent to the lowest level since last
January. It was the steepest decline since output in manufacturing
plunged 2.0 percent in December 1982 as the nation began crawling
out of the last recession.
   And the Commerce Department reported that business inventories
rose 0.4 percent in October, a moderate increase that analysts say
is unlikely to accelerate already growing unemployment.
   For the year so far, wholesale prices have risen at a 6.9
percent annual rate, compared with 4.9 percent for all of 1989.
   In November, energy prices rose a scant 0.1 percent, after
soaring 8 percent in October, 13.8 percent in September and 9
percent in August.
   Gasoline prices fell 2.6 percent and fuel oil dropped 7.3
percent. However, natural gas costs, which had been largely
unaffected by Persian Gulf turmoil, rose 5 percent.
   Food prices rose 0.8 percent last month following a 0.9 percent
jump in October.
   The department said fresh and dried vegetable prices leapt 12.3
percent and fish prices were up 8.1 percent. Costs also rose for
fresh fruit, rice, beef, pork and sweets. Prices fell for eggs,
dairy products, chickens and turkeys, pasta and shortening and
cooking oils.
   Prices excluding the volatile food and energy categories -
considered a better barometer of underlying inflationary pressures
by most economists - rose 0.5 percent after no change in October.
   Tobacco prices were up 3.7 percent in November and 15 percent
over the past year. Passenger cars rose 1.8 percent as some
manufacturers curbed incentive programs. Costs also rose for
medicines, tires, floor coverings and textile house furnishings.
Prices fell steeply for glassware and edged down for lawn and
garden equipment and sporting goods.
   Until today's inflation report, most economists believed that
Federal Reserve policy-makers, meeting Monday, would stimulate the
economy with another cut in interest rates before the end of the
year. However, the Fed has nudged short-term rates lowers three
times since early November and may hesitate to cut them again if
inflation worries persist.
   Reduced rates stimulate the economy by making it cheaper for
consumers and businesses to borrow, but they also tend to foster
inflation by creating more demand for goods than producers can
meet.
   The various changes in November pushed the index for all
finished goods to 122.9, up from 114.9 in November 1989. That means
a hypothetical selection of goods costing $100 in 1982, cost
$122.90 last month, up from $114.90 a year earlier.
   Price pressures earlier in the production process were more
modest. Intermediate goods were up only 0.1 percent and the price
of crude goods fell 6.2 percent.
   An example of the three processing stages would be bread for
finished, flour for intermediate and wheat for crude.
   Most analysts believe the economic slump should keep wholesale
price rises under control through 1991 if peace prevails in the
Persian Gulf.
   ``Basically, the surge has pretty well spent its force,'' said
economist Robert G. Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. ``We
may be surprised at how low the numbers are in the spring.''
   Economist Donald Ratajczak of Georgia State University is
predicting that in 1991, the weak economy will hold price increases
down to 2.2 percent, the best since 1986.
   Dederick said the economic slump, which most analysts believe is
the beginning of a recession, has dampened demand from consumers
and businesses to the point where goods producers can't get price
increases to stick.
   ``I would think producer prices are headed lower. How long they
stay down depends on the depth of the recession and the vigor of
the recovery,'' he said.

   Grain and soybean futures were higher in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Analysts say the market should bounce back from yesterday's
losses caused by disappointment in the size of the export credits
given the Soviet Union.
   Wheat futures may get some support from news the U.S.
Agriculture Department will allow producers to place up to 300
million bushels of wheat in the farmer-owned reserve.
   Moderate export sales in the latest week and a cutback in the
crushing pace could bolster soybean futures.
   In early trading, wheat was a { cent to 1\ cents higher with the

   Livestock and pork futures were higher in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Livestock futures were boosted by higher cash prices and a rise
in beef cutout values Thursday, despite release of a study that
linked daily consumption of red meat to a higher rate of colon
cancer.
   Higher cash hog prices and ideas Thursday's selloff was
overdone, spurred buying of pork futures.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .32 cent higher with December at 81
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .33 cent higher with

   Livestock and pork futures settled lower in Thursday's trading.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. bankruptcy judge today turned down a
federal agency's request for 45 more days to review the bankruptcy
reorganization plan of Southland Corp., the Dallas-based owner of
7-Eleven convenience stores.
   Judge Harold Abramson said the extension sought by the
Securities and Exchange Commission is too long for an opinion that
is not required in the bankruptcy proceeding.
   Abramson had asked the SEC for a statement about Southland's
``prepackaged'' bankruptcy plan, in which a creditor-approved
blueprint for re-emerging from bankruptcy reorganization is filed
at the time a company seeks refuge from creditors. Ordinarily, a
company presents a reorganization plan months or even years later
and creditors often challenge it.
   The SEC had wanted more time to prepare a statement, saying
Southland's use of prepackaging would set a precedent for other
large bankruptcy reorganizations and merited a lengthier review.
   Southland filed for bankruptcy protection in October, using the
prepackaging tool.
   Abramson said the SEC has had months to look over Southland's
restructuring, which he noted began in March.
   ``I can't give you that long,'' Abramson told an SEC attorney
who asked for the 45-day extension.
   ``If the commission could make some kind of statement by Dec.
31st or the first week of January, that would be helpful to the
court,'' Abramson said. ``Otherwise I'll excuse you from that
request.''
   ``The buck stops here anyway,'' Abramson said.
   The judge indicated testimony in the Southland confirmation
hearing could last until early next month.
   At the time of filing, the company listed $2.53 billion in
assets and $3.38 billion in liabilities and said it was overwhelmed
by debt left from its $4.9 billion debt-financed takeover in 1987.
   Southland, which had sales of almost $8 billion last year, is
the largest of the few companies that have tried a prepackaged
bankruptcy. Company officials believe prepackaging will allow the
company to get out of the bankruptcy process in six months.
   In addition to speeding up the bankruptcy process, proponents of
prepackaging say it assures a fairer deal for a greater number of
creditors.
   That's because a prepackaged plan must be approved by at least
50 percent of the bondholders holding at least two-thirds of a
company's debt. If a judge approves, the terms of the plan are then
imposed on the dissenting minority, preventing holdouts from
seeking better repayment terms.
   Southland in March said its Japanese affiliates, Ito-Yokado Co.
Ltd. and Seven-Eleven Japan Co. Ltd., were willing to spend $430
million for stock in the reorganized company.
   The terms of the prepackaged plan were agreed to in October,
just before the Chapter 11 filing.
   Other companies - notably Atlantic City resorts owned by Merv
Griffin and Donald Trump - have used prepackaging in bankruptcy
proceedings.
   Republic Health Corp., a Dallas-based owner of 14 hospitals,
filed a prepackaged Chapter 11 plan last December and emerged from
bankruptcy in April. The company had posted a profit by the end of
August.

<HEAD>Oil Up On Hints That U.S.-Iraq Talks Might Be Off</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Oil prices shot up today on speculation the
United States and Iraq would not be able to set up top-level
diplomatic meetings on the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Light sweet crude oil for January delivery was up $1.43 per
barrel at $27.85 early this afternoon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Oil had opened higher in New York amid continued reports that
U.S. and Iraqi officials were quarreling over a date for Secretary
of State James A. Baker III to visit Baghdad.
   Iraq has insisted that Baker go to Baghdad on Jan. 12, three
days before the U.N. Security Council's deadline for Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein to either withdraw his troops from
oil-rich Kuwait or risk a military strike. But the White House
wants Baker to visit Iraq no later than Jan. 3.
   The diplomatic logjam had pushed crude prices up $1.07 per
barrel on Thursday and the surge continued today.
   The rally got an additional lift around midday when two senators
announced Bush was ready to call off the talks with the Iraqis
because of the disagreements. The White House said Bush had not
given up hope for the talks, but he planned a mid-afternoon
statement on the situation that had the oil market on edge as crude
traders wondered what Bush would say.
   ``The focus is on whether or not these talks are going to go
ahead,'' senior oil analyst Ann-Louise Hittle of Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc. said this morning. ``Obviously, the U.S. and Iraq are
still at a stalement.''
   As crude moved ahead, futures prices for refined petroleum
products were also on the rise.
   Home heating oil was up 2.93 cents at 77.50 cents per gallon for
January delivery. Unleaded gasoline was up 2.48 cents at 68.05
cents per gallon for January delivery.
   Energy analyst Thomas P. Blakeslee of Pegasus Econometric Group
Inc., in Hoboken, N.J., said heating oil had been the weaker of the
futures contracts, with supplies adequate and demand sluggish in
the unseasonably warm fall.
   ``It won't get cold,'' Blakeslee said. ``It's a little chilly
out there today, but there's no forecast for any types of freezing
temperatures.''
   Natural gas was up 2 cents at $2.24 per 1,000 cubic feet for
January delivery.

   NCR Corp.'s directors unanimously rejected
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s $90-a-share cash tender offer
for the computer maker, NCR said today.
   In a statement, NCR called the hostile takeover bid ``grossly
inadequate and unfair.''
   ``Clearly, AT&amp;T is attempting, for its own purposes, to take
advantage of NCR's artificially and temporarily depressed stock
price,'' NCR Chairman Charles E. Exley Jr. said in the statement.
   ``We cannot and will not permit them to seize for themselves the
enormous values that are building steadily within NCR,'' Exley
said. ``Having `just said no' to this grossly inadequate offer, we
are focused on implementing the business strategy that will
continue to build very real and very significant value for NCR
shareholders, customers and employees.''
   NCR's board met Thursday in New York, the company said. It was
the board's first meeting since AT&amp;T launched the $6.1 billion
tender offer Dec. 5.
   Under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, NCR had 10 days
- until next Wednesday - to advise stockholders on the bid and to
file an opinion with the SEC.
   NCR also said it filed amendments today to a lawsuit it had
filed earlier in U.S. District Court in Dayton, Ohio, its
headquarters city. The suit seeks to have NCR's anti-takeover plan
declared valid.
   The amendments allege that AT&amp;T's government filings for its
tender offer are ``false, manipulative and misleading'' and that
they violate federal securities law.
   The amendments also allege the phone company filings:
   -Failed to disclose that its tender offer is conditional upon
NCR's board approving a friendly transaction with AT&amp;T.
   -Failed to disclose facts about ``AT&amp;T's own failures in the
computer business.''
   -Falsely indicated AT&amp;T may be willing to wait 18 months to
complete a business combination with NCR.
   -Failed to disclose that combinations of computer companies in
recent times ``have resulted in failure.''
   AT&amp;T spokesman Walter Murphy said the phone company had not
fully studied the amended suit, ``but we believe their claims are
completely without merit. Our tender offer materials are complete
and accurate.''
   Earlier today, AT&amp;T said it was disappointed by the NCR board's
rejection of the tender offer.
   ``Our $90-per-share price is a full, fair offer, as we believe
NCR shareholders, if given the opportunity to decide, would
agree,'' the phone company said in a statement.
   `We are now examining our options for the next steps we will
take. AT&amp;T is determined to conclude the merger with NCR. We still
would much prefer to reach a negotiated agreement.''
   Industry analysts say the most likely next step for AT&amp;T would
be to launch a proxy battle to try to unseat NCR's directors. NCR
has in place a strong anti-takeover plan that could be removed if
AT&amp;T gains control of the board.
   Exley has said he would be willing to enter into negotiations
with AT&amp;T if it raised its offer to $125 a share, or a total of
about $8.5 billion. AT&amp;T rejected the higher price as ``outrageous
and totally unjustified.''
   Analysts said they believe Exley is exploring several options to
fight the takeover bid, which he has called an attempt by AT&amp;T to
rescue that company's unprofitable computer line.
   ``I think Exley's trying to find somebody who will bail him out
of this predicatment without taking control of the company,'' said
John Jones of Montgomery Securities Inc. in San Francisco.
   Jones said Exley may seek another company that would buy a major
stake in NCR but allow the company to pursue its own course.
   Exley has said he has been in contact with other companies that
might be interested in some sort of combination with NCR, but he
also said he is not interested in a ``white knight,'' or another
merger partner that would save NCR from the AT&amp;T bid.
   ``The deal (with AT&amp;T) is either going to get done in two weeks
or it's going to be drawn out for months,'' Jones predicted. AT&amp;T's
tender offer expires Jan. 4.
   NCR stock was down $1.50 to $88.62{ a share by early afternoon
today on the New York Stock Exchange. AT&amp;T shares fell 50 cents to
$30.50.
   Also Thursday, AT&amp;T filed a motion in U.S. District Court in
Dayton seeking to have a filing by NCR last week dismissed. The
filing asks the court to declare the company's anti-takeover plan
valid.
   In addition, the Ohio Senate Judiciary Committee scheduled a
hearing for Tuesday to review the takeover. NCR spokesman Mark
Feighery said Exley plans to testify.

   Chrysler Corp. said Friday California billionaire
Kirk Kerkorian had acquired more than 9 percent of its outstanding
stock, and the financially struggling automaker strengthened its
``poison pill'' antitakeover defense in response.
   Chrysler declined to comment on the move by Kerkorian, who has
ties to the entertainment industry in southern California and is
known for other takeover forays.
   It wasn't immediately clear why Kerkorian had invested in
Chrysler or how much he spent. But the move came against a
background of a mild resurgence in big-time takeover maneuvering
that were the hallmark of the 1980s.
   In recent weeks, for example, Hollywood entertainment giant MCA
Inc. has been acquired by the Matsushita industrial conglomerate of
Japan for more than $6.6 billion, and NCR Corp. has been fighting a
$6.1 billion takeover offer from American Telephone and Telegraph
Co.
   Investors who acquire more than 5 percent of a company's stock
are required to disclose that information to the Securities and
Exchange Commission within 5 days after they go over the 5 percent
threshhold. But Kerkorian's disclosure statement wasn't immediately
available at the SEC headquarters in Washington, which closed early
today at 2 p.m.
   Chrysler is considered the weakest of the Big Three automakers
and there has been persistent speculation that it might be
purchased or merged with another company in the future.
   Trading in Chrysler stock was halted on the New York stock
exchange pending Chrysler's announcement. At the time trading was
halted, Chrysler stock was selling for $11.875 a share, down 37{
cents a share from Thursday's close.
   In response to Kerkorian's move, Chrysler's board of directors
on Friday approved an amendment to its so-called ``poison pill''
share purchase rights plan. That amendment lowers the threshold for
the company's anti-takeover mechanism to kick into action when 10
percent of its stock has been purchased an investor. Previously the
threshold was 20 percent.
   If the mechanism goes into effect, shareholders are able to buy
stock at less-than-market value, making it harder for a corporate
raider, for example, to amass large quantities of stock.
   The largest Chrysler shareholders are the Wellington Group, with
about 9.2 percent, and Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. Inc., with about
8.3 percent, which hold stock for some institutions, such as
pension funds.

   Business sales outpaced inventory accumulation
in October, the government said Friday, giving some analysts hope
that the economic downturn might be less severe than past slumps.
   ``In previous recessions, manufacturing activity fell off
dramatically because of the build-up in inventories,'' explained
economist Mark M. Zandi of Regional Financial Associates in West
Chester, Pa. ``Businesses had to cut back their payrolls'' while
they depleted their backlogs.
   The Commerce Department said inventories held on shelves and
backlots in October expanded 0.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted
$813.9 billion, up from $810.8 billion in September. The revised
0.4 percent increase in September was smaller than the 0.5 percent
first reported.
   At the same time, the department said business sales rose 0.9
percent to a seasonally adjusted $551.8 billion. Sales had fallen a
revised 0.5 percent the previous month to $547.2 billion. September
sales first were reported to have been off 0.8 percent.
   The October activity resulted in an inventory-to-sales ratio of
1.47, down from 1.48 the previous month. The ratio means it would
take 1.47 months to exhaust the backlog of goods at the October
sales pace. The ratio reached 1.74 in January 1982 during the last
recession.
   ``The fact that inventories remained lean suggests that although
we're in a slowdown, there's not a lot of inventory correction
needed and that will keep the slowdown mild and of shorter
duration,'' Zandi said.
   Evelina Tainer, an economist with First National Bank of
Chicago, said the ratio suggests ``unemployment will go up, but not
as much as in past recessions.''
   Nevertheless, inventories on the retail level rose a hefty 1.0
percent while gaining just 0.1 percent on the manufacturing level
and 0.2 percent on the wholesale level.
   While saying inventories overall have been kept under ``pretty
good control,'' economist Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co.
International in New York said he still was ``concerned over the
retail level, particularly if this is a disappointing Christmas
shopping season.''
   The Commerce Department said Thursday that retail sales in
November fell 0.1 percent. Since the Thanksgiving weekend
traditionally is the start of holiday shopping, many analysts said
the report pointed to weak sales.
   Manufacturers' sales jumped 1.7 percent in October while sales
rose 0.1 percent on the wholesale level and 0.2 percent on the
retail level.

<HEAD>Coal Production to Set Record, Officials Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID WILKISON</BYLINE>

   U.S. coal production and consumption
should top more than 1 billion tons for the first time in 1990,
marking the fourth consecutive record year, industry officials said
Friday.
   ``What we have seen is consistent, steady growth from year to
year,'' said John Grasser, spokesman for the National Coal
Association in Washington. ``It's not what you'd call robust and
dramatic, but it's steady growth.''
   The industry group's forecast predicts 1990 production will
reach 1.02 billion tons, 41 million tons more than the record 981
million tons produced in 1989, Grasser said.
   The 4.2 percent increase in bituminous, subbituminous, lignite
and anthracite production is the largest year-to-year increase
since 1983 and 1984, he said.
   ``This is just that natural steady progression from year to
year,'' Grasser said. ``Eighty percent of the coal goes to the
utility sector. That's obviously our largest customer and that's
where we've seen the largest growth.''
   He said demand was helped by an increase in exports to foreign
customers and an unusually high demand for utility stockpiles.
   West Virginia, the nation's third largest producer, was running
nearly 14 percent ahead of last year's production figures through
October with 144.2 million tons mined, said Kathy Sloan of the
state Division of Energy.
   Wyoming has ranked No. 1 in coal production since 1988. Kentucky
passed West Virginia as the leading producer in 1972.
   ``From what industry officials tell me, we have a pretty decent
shot at coming even with Kentucky and maybe even passing it,'' said
Mark Polen, vice president of the West Virginia Coal Association.
``It's going to be pretty close.''
   While 1990 will be remembered as a banner year for the coal
industry, Grasser said the outlook for 1991 isn't quite as
positive.
   ``We are predicting a flat or even slight decline next year due
in part to the recession and the slowing of the economy,'' Grasser
said.
   National Coal Association forecasts for 1991 predict that
production will decline by 1.47 percent, while consumption will
increase by 1 percent.
   However, Richard Lawson, president of the National Coal
Association, said the Persian Gulf crisis may help the industry
next year.
   ``The recent and volatile increase in oil prices could have a
positive effect on coal burn next year, especially if the Middle
East situation is not resolved quickly,'' Lawson said.
   Recently enacted clean air legislation also could begin having
some effects on the coal industry, officials said.
   ``It's dicey to predict how that act is going to work because
we're not sure how the utility companies will respond to it,''
Polen said.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed slightly
higher Friday in lackluster trading on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The market was in a bearish position as a result of the
smaller-than-expected U.S. export credits given the Soviet Union
earlier this week, analysts said.
   Traders were wary of taking positions, pending an announcement
of a breakdown of the commodities the Soviet Union will buy with
the $500 million to $1 billion in export credits, said analyst Joel
Karlin of Research Department Inc.
   Corn futures came under pressure with news that South Korea made
a major purchase of Chinese corn.
   Wheat futures were boosted by a decision of the U.S. Agriculture
Department to allow producers to place up to 300 million bushels of
wheat in the farmer-owned reserve. The decision was made because of
concern over falling prices and lagging exports.
   At the close, wheat was 1\ cents lower { cent higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $2.53 a bushel; corn was {

<HEAD>Tribune Expects Big Earnings Decline, Knight-Ridder Expects to
Improve</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tribune Co. said Friday its operating profit
will slide substantially more than 25 percent this year because of
the weak advertising climate and rising costs of a strike at its
New York Daily News.
   Company executives failed to specify how much the seven-week-old
strike by nine of the 10 labor unions at the newspaper is costing.
The paper has continued to publish despite the strike although
circulation is down sharply.
   The executives repeated earlier assertions that they intended to
continue publishing the paper as long as it continues to progress.
   In a separate appearance before securities analysts at the
annual PaineWebber media outlook conference, Knight-Ridder Inc.
said it expected earnings would be up modestly in 1990 compared
with results in 1989 that excluded a gain on the sale of a
newspaper.
   Chairman James Batten said the Miami-based newspaper and
information services company has ``a realistic chance for at least
a flat year'' in earnings per share next year.
   The companies made their appearances on the closing day of the
weeklong conference that has featured mostly glum earnings
forecasts due to advertising demand that has weakened along with
the economy.
   A top advertising forecaster, Robert Coen, has estimated ad
spending will rise only 4.9 percent this year, its slowest pace of
growth since 1975, and grow 4.6 percent in 1991.
   Tribune, which publishes the Chicago Tribune and five other
newspapers in addition to the News and owns six television
stations, earned $3.17 a share for all of 1989. Operating earnings
amounted to $433 million last year.
   But the tough advertising climate helped push operating earnings
for the first nine months of this year down 25 percent from a year
ago as a double-digit decline in the newspaper group more than
offset gains in broadcasting and entertainment operations.
   Fourth-quarter earnings, while not out yet, also are below
levels of last year. The News employees went on strike on Oct. 25
and newsprint operations were depressed by a strike at Canadian
mill that has just been resolved.
   Scott Smith, chief financial officer of the Tribune, said
operating results are down by about 20 percent in the last three
months of the year excluding the effect of the strikes and
substantially more if they are included.
   He said the decline in operating profit for the full year ``will
be substantially larger than 25 percent'' including strike costs.
   Smith told analysts that earnings per share excluding losses at
the Daily News and the newsprint mill should amount to about $3
compared with $3.17 a year ago, and said earnings will be below $3
a share next year.
   He said the company would disclose the magnitude of the losses
at the Daily News when it reports its 1990 earnings early next
year.
   Daily News Publisher James Hoge said the newspaper continues to
hope a reasonable settlement can be reached to end the strike but
that the paper will continue to publish as long as it was making
progress toward regaining circulation and advertising.
   He said daily circulation has reached about 600,000 after
sinking as low as 250,000 shortly after the strike began. It was
more than 1.09 million before the strike.
   Hoge has previously said the Daily News lost $115 million
betwen 1979 and 1989 and that losses by the end of 1990 will rise
to about $200 million.
   Financial analysts, who were the only attendees allowed to ask
questions at the session, did not ask about the size of the News
losses.
   Knight-Ridder, which owns 29 daily newspapers including The
Miami Herald and The Phildelphia Inquirer, said it anticipates
earning $2.90 to $2.97 a share in 1990 compared with $2.86 a share
excluding a gain on the sale of a newspaper in 1989.
   The advertising climate has weakend along with the economy in
the fourth quarter, but Knight-Ridder aides said earnings per share
should at least match the 1990 figure in 1991.
   Revenue is expected to rise 2 percent to 3 percent next year
with slightly higher revenue from newspapers and a double-digit
increase from business information services, said Robert Singleton,
senior vice president for finance.

<TEXT>
   Union workers overwhelming approved a
new contract Friday with Delta Pride Catfish Inc., ending a bitter
three-month strike that brought out allegations of racial
discrimination.
   The plight of the workers in one of the nation's most
economically depressed regions attracted support from the NAACP and
other civil rights organizations and led to a national boycott of
Delta Pride products.
   The contract vote was 479-1. Union officials said the lone vote
against appeared to be a misunderstanding over wage provisions in
the pact.
   ``This is a great Christmas present,'' said Sarah White, a shop
steward who has been with Delta Pride since 1983, one year after
the nation's largest catfish processor opened. ``I feel good about
this contract and I've talked with several co-workers and they are
satisfied.
   ``We finally got some of the things we wanted ... including
things that should make the workplace better for all of us.''
   The strike began Sept. 13 when members of United Food and
Commercial Workers Union Local 1529 rejected a contract. About 900
workers walked off the job at Delta Pride's Indianola and Inverness
plants. A third plant in Belzoni employs non-union workers.
   The company had no immediate comment on the contract vote.
   Provisions in the contract include wage increases and assurances
that striking workers will be rehired, union officials said.
   The contract grants immediate raises of 60 to 65 cents an hour
for all workers with at least one year of seniority. Pay averaged
$4.05 an hour before the strike. The pact also establishes a
worker-management health and safety committee to monitor conditions
at the plant.
   While there were scattered reports of violence, including
rock-throwing, early in the strike, officials said recent weeks
were quiet.
   Aaron Henry, president of the Mississippi NAACP, said the
worker's anger arose from ``a combination of race and economics
coupled with the philosophy of the plantation.''
   Besides wages, the union also raised concerns about working
conditions. A common complaint among workers has been about
repetitive motion injury.
   Workers complained that they were timed with a stopwatch when
skinning, gutting, slicing and packaging fish. The also complained
of limited restroom breaks - six five-minute bathroom breaks per
week. Violators risked dismissal.
   White, who has two children, said the three months she has been
on strike created financial problems but ``the union helped take
care of our bills and provided groceries for us. We really
sacrificed but we had help with the basics.''
   White, 32, of Moorhead, said she planned to be in St. Louis this
weekend to attend a support rally for the striking workers.
   ``Now I can tell them it is over and tell them to start buying
catfish ... we need the hours at work,'' she said.
   E. Dale Cline of Memphis, Tenn., the federal mediator who helped
work out the new contract, said he is ``tickled to death that this
is finally over.''
   Union spokesman Neel Lattimore said the contract goes a long way
toward improving working conditions.
   ``We feel like there is language in the contract to make Delta
Pride more sensitive (to working conditions) and by all of us
working together we can get along,'' he said.

   The stock market recorded a broad loss today,
weighed down by disappointing inflation news.
   The day got off to a rocky start when the Labor Department
reported that the producer price index rose 0.5 percent in
November.
   That came as an unpleasant surprise to traders who had been
expecting a considerably smaller increase, given a recent letup in
the rise of oil prices.
   Separate government reports showed a 1.7 percent drop in
industrial production last month, and a slowing in the operating
rate of the nation's factories, mines and utilities to 80.9 percent
of capacity from 82.4 percent in October.
   Analysts said that mixture of news provided stock-market
investors with little encouragement about the outlook for the
economy and corporate profits.

   Shortly after the first of the year, The Associated Press will
begin transmitting live data from its new financial markets
computer system.
   We are now conducting tests of the new system. IT IS VITAL THAT
EACH NEWSPAPER RECEIVING DIGITALSTOCKS, DATASPEED OR SLOW-SPEED
STOCKS WIRES PARTICIPATE IN THESE TESTS.
   For the past several weeks we have been sending test tables on
Sunday, with advisories during the week telling members about the
tests.
   Beginning NEXT WEEK (Dec. 17), we will begin transmission of
test data on a daily basis as well as Sunday. Tests of the previous
day's tables will be transmitted at 2 a.m. EST; weekly tests begin
at noon on Sundays.
   Checking the time-offs is important in determining which
transmissions are the test tables. That's because the header
information for the test tables is identical to headers for the
regular tables. Again, the test tables are those that arrive after
2 a.m. on weekdays and after noon on Sunday.
   The tests are for stocks, bonds, options and stock-related
summaries (up-down, leaders, what stocks did, most active, etc.).
Commodities and futures tables will be tested later, so you won't
see those tables now.
   Please ensure that the test transmissions are 1) captured, 2)
typeset and 3) evaluated as soon as possible, and 4) please let us
know the results. This is essential to a smooth transition to the
new system.
   Although the tables are transmitted according to the same
standards that have always applied, it cannot be byte-for-byte
identical with data from the old computer system. This especially
applies to non-printing spacing characters, which may appear in a
different sequence, and tape-visible numbers.
   If everything looks fine, please advise your AP bureau chief. If
there are any problems setting the tables, call or send the typeset
copy quickly with an explanation to:

   Oil prices rallied Friday as traders speculated
President Bush might scrap diplomatic meetings with Iraq, then
crude fell back sharply when Bush's news conference rhetoric was
not so harsh.
   Light sweet crude oil settled at $26.55 per barrel, up 13 cents,
at the New York Mercantile Exchange on contracts for delivery in
January. Crude for delivery in most later months closed lower.
   In early trading, crude had jumped up by $1.68 per barrel amid
continued quarreling between the United States and Iraq over a date
for Secretary of State James A. Baker III to visit Baghdad. Two
senators said in Washington that Bush might be ready to abandon the
idea of the talks, adding to oil's rally.
   After Bush said in the afternoon that he was discouraged but
still hoped the talks could be held, crude plunged more than $1 per
barrel in about a half hour.
   ``It was probably a little over-bought on the whole situation,''
said Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc. ``Once he came out and didn't do anything, it was
easy to sell off, probably a little bit of buy-the-rumor,
sell-the-fact.''
   Oil traders often run up prices by buying crude futures
contracts when rumors hit the market, because they don't want to
run the risk of getting left out of a rally. They are more likely
to sell off their oil contracts on the basis of facts that indicate
adequate supplies or sluggish demand.
   During the week, crude hit its lowest prices since Aug. 3, the
day after Iraq invaded Kuwait. But after the close of $25.35 per
barrel on Wednesday, it began moving higher.
   Oil had been steadily dropping since Nov. 30, when Bush first
proposed the talks with Iraq and traders began believing a peaceful
solution to the crisis could be at hand.
   Once the diplomats showed they could not even agree on dates to
meet, the war fears began resurfacing.
   ``The last few days, it seemed like the peace talk has
diminished,'' said Ed Kevelson, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc.
   For the week, crude finished 3 cents higher on January delivery
contracts.
   Refined petroleum products moved in tandem with crude on Friday,
rising in early trading then dropping to show little change at the
close.
   Home heating oil was up .67 cent at 75.24 cents a gallon for
January delivery. Unleaded gasoline was up .61 cent at 66.18 cents
a gallon for January delivery.
   Heating oil has shown the most weakness of late, with supplies
adequate and demand sluggish amid unseasonably warm fall weather.
   ``It won't get cold,'' said Thomas P. Blakeslee, an energy
analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc., in Hoboken, N.J.
``It's a little chilly out there today, but there's no forecast for
any types of freezing temperatures.''
   For the week, heating oil fell 3.93 cents for next-month
delivery, while gasoline fell .29 cent.
   Natural gas for January delivery closed Friday at $2.262 per
1,000 cubic feet, up 4.2 cents for the day but down 8.8 cents for
the week.

   For a highflier like Kirk
Kerkorian, an auto maker like Chrysler Corp. is a pretty
down-to-earth investment.
   The World War II pilot-turned-tycoon, who sold MGM-UA
Communications Co. last month for $1.3 billion, is known for
trading casinos and airplanes the way some people do cars, more Las
Vegas glitter than Detroit grit.
   But Kerkorian's 9 percent stake in Chrysler, revealed Friday,
returns him in an odd way to his business roots. After dropping out
of trade school and a stint with the Civilian Conservation Corps,
the first business he set up was steam-cleaning auto engines for
used car dealers.
   Besides MGM-UA, Kerkorian is best known for investments in
airlines - and for being one of the biggest players in Las Vegas,
the highest-rolling city in America.
   ``He's got a reputation for being smart, and you don't have to
check your wallet after shaking hands with him,'' Bally
Manufacturing Chairman Robert E. Mullane once said of Kerkorian.
   Among other achievements in his 73 years, Kerkorian is noted for
twice building the world's largest hotel in Las Vegas, only to see
the record fall to others.
   His latest project there is a $700 million theme park and
5,000-room hotel on the Strip. He has hung a f
   ``At no time did (police) use their arms,'' a government
statement said.
   The second union, the Democratic Workers Confederation, said it
could not confirm the report of deaths in Fez, a city of about
500,000 people.
   In Tangier in northern Morocco, a 17-year-old boy was shot in
the stomach in a confrontation between police and strikers,
hospital sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. They
listed about 50 known injured in clashes there.
   Lesser clashes also were reported in Kenitra, north of Rabat,
and the southern city of Agadir.
   Police threw tear gas canisters to disperse young rioters in
Fez, many of them from Fez University, where pro-fundamentalist
Moslem students and progressive students have been in conflict.
   The government said youths from outside Fez ``took advantage of
the strike.''
   In Tangier, youth threw up street barricades in Beni-Makada
district as police moved in.
   The government had warned against the strike. It said it would
investigate the incidents and that Premier Azeddine Laraki would
make a statement Monday before Parliament. Thousands of workers who
took part in general strikes in 1979 and 1981 were fired or
arrested.
   The unions said the government must bear responsibility for
Friday's incidents.
   The walkout apparently hit the education sector the hardest. Up
to 60 percent of university teachers and students obeyed the strike
call, said sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. The
Education Ministry claimed that institutes and special schools were
not affected.
   Last-ditch negotiations between the government and the unions
failed on Thursday. The unions complained they received nothing but
``the traditional promises'' in response to their specific demands.
   Laraki announced salary increases and special family subsidies
on Tuesday, but gave no figures.

<HEAD>War or Peace Overshadows Other Market Influences</HEAD>

   For weeks the nation's farmers and grain and soybean traders had
been waiting with anticipation the Bush Administration's decision
on extending export credits to the Soviet Union.
   That decision came Wednesday, and it was disappointing.
   The United States will grant $500 million to $1 billion in
export credits to the Soviet Union to buy much needed grain and
other food products.
   Traders were expecting a credit package of $1.5 billion. Remarks
by Sen. Robert Dole, R-Kan., led the markets to believe the
administration could grant the Soviets $3 billion in credits.
   Farmers and traders were pressing for the granting of export
credits to the Soviets because U.S. exports have been lagging
tremendously.
   This year, corn exports are 36 percent behind levels last year,
wheat shipments are down 23 percent and soybean exports are at
their lowest levels in 16 years.
   ``Our exports are so far behind, if we don't start giving stuff
away we are going to end up with excess inventory,'' said William
Biedermann, an analyst with Allendale Inc. in Chicago.
   But analysts said credits of less than $1 billion won't allow
the Soviet Union improve this country's grain exports. They won't
allow the Soviets to fulfill their longterm grain-buying agreement
with the United States. The Soviets are committed to buy 1.2
million metric tons of wheat and 600,000 metric tons of corn by
year-end.
   The apparent lack of generosity by the United States has riled
some traders.
   Analyst Daniel Basse, of AgResource Co. in Chicago said the
amount of the credits are equivalent to a mini-embargo. He says
that since other nations are offering the Soviets as much as $12
billion in food aid, there's some pretty intense competition for
their business.
   Other grain-exporting nations have freely given export credits
to the Soviets, which put pressure on the U.S. to extend export
credits. Bumper crops have given the Soviets access to soybean meal
and corn from South America and wheat for Europe and Canada.
   Disappointment with the smaller-than-expected offering of export
credits extended to the livestock and pork market.
   A larger credit line had been expected to lead to meat purchases
by the Soviets. But they are now likely to confine purchases to
grains.
   Beidermann said farmers, particularly those who do not
participate in government programs, have been hard hit by the
declining exports. He said there is no reason for the United States
to be reluctant to sell its grain to the Soviets because the nation
has so much.
   In granting the credits, President Bush lifted a 15-year ban
imposed because of the Soviet prohibition of free emigration. The
Jackson-Vanik amendment barred closer U.S.-Soviet economic ties
until Soviet Jews and others were free to emigrate in large
numbers.
   This year, 150,000 Soviet Jews have moved to Israel and 50,000
to the United States. Kremlin officials said this past week that a
further liberalization in immigration laws was planned.
   Biedermann said a big question remains, whether the amount of
export credits granted Wednesday is part of bigger pie.
   The next prominent opportunity for the United States to announce
export credits to the Soviets will come in February, when President
Bush will travel to Moscow to meet with Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev.

   A few days before her Senate-race loss, Rep.
Lynn Martin stood in a Chicago alley and argued with a man who said
he was disgusted with her TV ads.
   Cars honked, but Martin didn't budge. The native Chicagoan was
near her old neighborhood, and like most politicians in that brawny
town she wasn't ready to yield an inch.
   ``Not mine!'' she told the man, who said her Senate campaign ads
were nasty. ``Usually before you hang somebody you have some
evidence.''
   Her accuser was not convinced. Voters were not sold on her
either. Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., crushed the Republican challenger
in a 980,000-vote landslide that even swept Martin's home county,
Winnebago.
   Soon to be out of work for the first time in her 18-year
political career, Martin accepted an invitation Friday to join
President Bush's Cabinet as Labor Department secretary, replacing
Elizabeth Dole.
   Simon immediately jumped on her bandwagon.
   ``I will vote for her and I wish her the very best,'' he said.
The Senate must confirm the appointment.
   Despite representing Rockford, a blue-collar city that is
Illinois' second-largest, Martin never forged any ties to organized
labor during her 10 years in the House.
   Business groups gave her $358,439 in campaign contributions from
1983 through 1988. Labor groups donated only $3,900.
   ``I, of course, am pro-business,'' Martin said earlier this
year. ``I think pro-business is pro-worker.
   ``It isn't a belief that business should always be protected. In
things like the environment, who should be hired - there are a lot
of things that business has to do a lot better with,'' she said.
   In one of the most significant business-labor debates of 1988,
Congress passed a bill requiring a 60-day notice of large layoffs
or plant closings. Martin voted no.
   ``The smaller companies who would be forced to give that 60-day
notice would find themselves losing virtually all credit and any
chance to survive,'' she said.
   Judith Lynn Morley Martin was born in Chicago on Dec. 26, 1939.
A graduate of the University of Illinois, she taught high school
economics, government and English before beginning her public
career with a race for Winnebago County Board in 1972.
   Four years later, she was elected to the Illinois House, and in
1978 the Illinois Senate. When John B. Anderson ran for president
in 1980, voters promoted Martin to the U.S. House, where she was
re-elected four times.
   Declaring that Simon was too liberal for Illinois, Martin ran
for Senate this year. But she was never able to overcome his
statewide popularity, match his $8 million campaign chest or
develop a clear campaign theme.
   Perhaps her favorite achievement in Congress, she said, was a
House rule that established an anti-discrimination program. The
Office of Fair Employment Practices mediates disputes between
lawmakers and their staff members.
   ``It was a giant step forward,'' Martin said in August. ``You
now see women who are administrative assistants. ... Minorities
have a chance to complain if they feel there is racial prejudice.''
   Few laws, however, carry her name.
   ``The fact is it's a Democratic majority,'' she said of the
House, ``so that means you have to be more concerned with getting
whatever you want done in the process.
   ``I think people would suggest I'm pretty good at that.''

<HEAD>Interest-Rate Hopes No Sure Thing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wall Street analysts have some words of caution
for all investors, consumers and business planners who have put
``lower interest rates'' on their holiday-season wish lists this
year.
   True, interest rates have come down significantly since they hit
their 1990 peaks around the beginning of autumn.
   True, also, the Federal Reserve seems committed to a policy of
gradually but steadily loosening its credit policy, helping to
foster lower rates as it seeks to cushion the impact of a
developing recession.
   And true, too, the consensus prediction among financial analysts
is for further declines in interest rates at least through the
early stages of 1991.
   But at least a few Scroogian voices can be heard in the chorus
of yearend forecasts being issued these days in the investment
world.
   Quite a few potential pitfalls dot the road to lower rates this
winter, the skeptics say. Furthermore, they add, even if rates are
indeed headed for further declines, the circumstances that permit
that to happen may be pretty unpleasant.
   One widely cited prerequisite for lower rates is a steady
improvement in the news on inflation. Wall Street suffered a
disappointment on that score Friday, when the Labor Department
reported that the producer price index rose 0.5 percent in
November.
   Traders had been expecting a considerably smaller increase,
given a recent letup in the rise of oil prices.
   The inflation outlook could be scrambled further should the
showdown in the Persian Gulf take an unexpected turn, sending oil
higher once again.
   ``The Gulf crisis and oil prices are the obvious wild cards,''
observed Edward Taber at the investment management firm of T. Rowe
Price Associates in his forecast for 1991. ``The less obvious
factor which could alter our forecast is a much stronger economy
than is currently in the consensus.''
   That could occur, Taber contends, as a result of such forces as
the Fed's easing, heavy deficit spending by the government, tight
inventories at many businesses, and any revival of consumer
spending.
   ``Should this alternative become reality, we would expect rates
to move markedly higher throughout the year,'' he said.
   The stock market struggled with such doubts through the past
week, changing directions at least half a dozen times. The Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials closed Friday at 2,593.81, up 3.71
from the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped .36 to
178.71; the American Stock Exchange market value index fell .71 to
305.74, and the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market was down 2.71 at 368.83.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 155.85 million shares a day,
against 200 million in the previous week.
   Wary analysts recall that interest-rate hopes also ran high last
year about this time. The Dow Jones industrial average reached a
then-record closing peak of 2,810.15 last Jan. 2.
   But it tumbled 266.91 points, or 9.5 percent, over the next four
weeks as rates unexpectedly turned higher, following the lead of
interest rates in Japan and Germany.
   If rates keep declining now, some observers say, they could be
signaling a deeper-than-expected recession, chilling any joy over
cheaper money.
   With all this, though, many optimists remain on Wall Street
offering assurances that the economy and the markets can ride out
the storm.
   ``Will lower interest rates revive economic growth? They always
have in the past,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at
Prudential-Bache Securities.
   ``Interest rates should hit their lows around March if the
economy starts to show some signs of life during the first quarter
as we expect.
   ``If, however, the economy continues to fall during the first
quarter, then interest rates will fall as low as necessary to
revive economic growth.''

   Disappointing inflation news and a rise in
interest rates helped drive the stock market into a broad retreat
Friday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 20.55 to
2,593.81, closing out the week with a net gain of 3.71 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
526 up, 1,025 down and 473 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 150.88 million
shares, down from 162.11 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 182.58 million shares.
   The day got off to a rocky start when the Labor Department
reported that the producer price index rose 0.5 percent in
November.
   That came as an unpleasant surprise to traders who had been
expecting a considerably smaller increase, given a recent letup in
the rise of oil prices.
   In the bond market, which is especially sensitive to shifting
inflationary expectations, interest rates rose for the second
straight session. Prices of long-term government bonds fell more
than $5 for each $1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the
neighborhood of 8.19 percent.
   Separate government reports showed a 1.7 percent drop in
industrial production last month, and a slowing in the operating
rate of the nation's factories, mines and utilities to 80.9 percent
of capacity from 82.4 percent in October.
   Analysts said that mixture of news provided stock-market
investors with little encouragement about the outlook for the
economy and corporate profits.
   General Motors dropped 1 to 33\ as the most active NYSE issue,
and Ford Motor was down { at 25\. The stocks of both auto giants
traded this week at their lowest levels in more than two years.
   Chrysler, meanwhile, was unchanged at 12\. The company said it
had moved to build up its takeover defenses after financier Kirk
Kerkorian accumulated more than 9 percent of its stock.
   Elsewhere among the blue chips, Philip Morris dropped | to 50|;
International Business Machines 1| to 111\; General Electric } to
55|, and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph &rsqb; to 30|.
   Castle &amp; Cooke fell 4| to 29. The company said it had decided
against selling any part of its Dole Food Co. operation.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $22.84 billion, or 0.74
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.35 to 178.71.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 2.89 to 382.53, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 2.52 at 326.82.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 2.67 to 368.83. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 305.74, down .97.

   Southland Corp.'s bankruptcy plan confirmation
hearing began Friday with attorneys clashing over efforts by the
parent of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain to disclose
reorganization options.
   Southland filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in October with a
``prepackaged'' plan already approved by most of its creditors.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harold Abramson must confirm the plan for it
to take effect.
   Abramson said he would first hear arguments over Southland's
attempts to inform creditors of the Dallas-based company's
financial condition and options, then hear arguments on the merits
of the reorganization plan. The hearing is expected to last for
several weeks.
   At the time of the bankruptcy filing, Southland listed $2.53
billion in assets and $3.38 billion in liabilities and said it was
overwhelmed by debt left from its $4.9 billion debt-financed
takeover in 1987.
   During opening statements, attorneys for creditors who oppose
the plan argued that Southland did not give them enough time for
its consideration, used a complicated ballot and withheld
information about the compensation of the company's founding
family.
   Southland's attorney, Mike Sutherland of Dallas, said the
company followed existing regulations for a prepackaged filing. He
said the dissenting creditors want Abramson to give them ``more
leverage than they have.''
   Southland is the largest of a handful of companies to try a
prepackaged filing, first used about a year ago. The company's case
has drawn extraordinary attention in the legal community because of
its precedent-setting use of the prepackaging.
   Proponents of the prepackaging device say it reduces the time a
company stays in bankruptcy and assures a fairer deal for a greater
number of creditors.
   Ordinarily, a company presents a reorganization plan months or
even years later after filing for bankruptcy and creditors often
challenge it. Often a small number of creditors, called holdouts,
will vote against any reorganization in hopes of a separate deal
that is better, leaving the majority to accept repayment on terms
that aren't as good.
   When a judge approves a prepackaged filing, its terms are
imposed on all creditors.
   Peter Wolfson, attorney for some of the dissenting creditors,
said the company doesn't have the support for the plan that it has
portrayed. But he acknowledged that, in most aspects, the company's
plan is supported by a majority of the people that Southland owes
money.
   Under the plan, creditors end up with control of 25 percent of
the company. Southland's Japanese affiliates, Ito-Yokado Co. Ltd.
and Seven-Eleven Japan Co. Ltd., get 70 percent and the rest is
left to the the company's founders, the Thompson family of Dallas.
   Jere and John Thompson, sons of Southland founder Joe Thompson,
lose their posts as the company's chief officers. They remain
directors and continue to be paid $600,000 annually, under the
plan. Their brother, Joe Thompson Jr., would also remain a director
of Southland.
   Abramson began the hearing by refusing to give another 45 days
for the Securities and Exchange Commission to review the Southland
plan.
   SEC attorney John Lee said agency officials wanted the extension
because Southland's plan would set a precedent for other
prepackaged bankruptcy cases.
   Abramson said the extension was too long for an opinion that is
not required by the Bankruptcy Code. The judge asked the SEC to
present a statement of position to help him form a ruling.
   ``If the commission could make some kind of statement by Dec.
31st or the first week of January, that would be helpful to the
court,'' Abramson said. ``Otherwise I'll excuse you from that
request.''
   ``The buck stops here anyway,'' Abramson said.

<HEAD>Chrysler Beefs Up Takeover Defenses After Investor Buys Automaker's
Stock</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto LA5</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California billionaire Kirk Kerkorian has bought
9.8 percent of the stock of Chrysler Corp. for about $272 million,
making him the company's largest shareholder and prompting the
struggling automaker to beef up its takeover defenses.
   A statement issued through a Los Angeles public relations agency
said the purchase was made as an investment. Chrysler spokesman
Arthur Liebler confirmed that a discussion took place last wek
between Kerkorian, of Beverly Hills, Calif., and Chrysler Chairman
Lee Iacocca.
   ``That's when Kerkorian said that he's supportive of Chrysler
and he described himself as a passive investor,'' Liebler said
Friday.
   Nevertheless, Chrysler's board of directors on Friday lowered
from 20 percent to 10 percent the amount of stock an investor may
hold before the company's anti-takeover mechanisms take effect.
   Those mechanisms include offering current Chrysler stockholders
shares at less-than-market value. That makes a hostile takeover
more difficult and expensive.
   Through a spokesman, Kerkorian indicated he was surprised by the
board's action.
   ``It is hard for us to see how the steps taken by the board
today are in the best interest of all the shareholders,'' the
statement said.
   It did not say when Kerkorian bought the stock or what range he
paid for the shares.
   A woman answering the telephone at Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp. in
Beverly Hills, who did not identify herself, said no corporate
officers were available and all comment was coming from the agency.
   More light may be shed in papers that must be filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission when an investor acquires 5
percent of a company's stock. Kerkorian had not filed the papers by
the time the offices closed at 2 p.m. EST.
   Chrysler first announced the purchase, saying Kerkorian had
acquired between 9 percent and 10 percent of the company's 224
million shares of outstanding common stock.
   About an hour earlier, trading in Chrysler stock was halted on
the New York Stock Exchange, with shares at $11.87{. Trading
resumed about two hours later and Chrysler stock rose to $12 a
share, down 25 cents from Thursday's close. Chrysler shares
regained the 25 cents and closed for the day at $12.25.
   The purchase makes Kerkorian Chrysler's largest shareholder. The
Wellington Group has about 9.2 percent, and Sanford C. Bernstein &amp;
Co. Inc. about 8.3 percent. Both hold stock for institutions, such
as pension funds.
   According to Chrysler's latest proxy statement, Iacocca owned
about 192,000 shares of stock, or less than a tenth of 1 percent.
   Kerkorian, 73, is known as a high-rolling airline and Las Vegas
casino investor. On Nov. 1 he completed the sale of MGM-UA
Communications Co. for $1.3 billion to Pathe Communications Corp.,
owned by Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti.
   There has been speculation for months that Chrysler, which is
struggling to be profitable this year, could be subject to a
takeover or may offer some of its equity to another automaker.
   Last month, about the same time Kerkorian sold MGM-UA, Chrysler
broke off talks with the huge Italian automaker Fiat SpA. Those
talks had included discussions about business and commercial
arrangements.
   Analysts speculated Kerkorian's move was purely for investment.
   ``He figures he has himself as close to a no-lose proposition in
the (stock) market,'' said auto analyst Charles Brady of
Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New York. ``The stock has bottomed out and
everybody has said everything bad about it (Chrysler) as they can.
   ``I think it's a genius move. Barring nuclear war in the Middle
East, he gets his money back.''
   Kerkorian personally owned about 70 percent of the MGM-UA stock
and controlled another 10 percent through a foundation. The sale
last month to Pathe netted him an estimated $1 billion.
   ``Until he files the (SEC forms), nobody really knows what his
true intentions are,'' said auto analyst Mary Anne Sudol of Fitch
Investors Service Inc. ``It could be the vague old `for investment
purposes only' or it could be something else.''
   Chrysler, like the other domestic automakers, has been hurt this
year by sagging sales in a flagging economy. It took a $214 million
loss in the third quarter on $6.5 billion in revenue, compared to
$331 million in earnings on $7.6 billion in revenue in the 1989
period.
   Chrysler is the smallest of the Big Three, with $23 billion in
revenue through September compared to $95 billion for General
Motors Corp. and $73.5 billion for Ford Motor Co.

   Wholesale prices rose 0.5 percent in November,
the government said Friday. Analysts called it a disturbingly high
increase at a time when the economy is slumping and energy costs
are moderating.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said U.S.
manufacturing had suffered its steepest one-month plunge in eight
years.
   The seasonally adjusted November rise in the Labor Department's
Producer Price Index for finished goods, which measures prices one
stop short of retail, looked tame in comparison with monthly
increases topping 1 percent from August through October.
   November's increase translates, however, into a worrisome 6.1
percent annual rate.
   ``It's another terrible number. We have not gotten rid of
inflation,'' said economist Michael K. Evans, a Washington
consultant.
   Faced with the disappointing news after forecasts of a price
rise of only 0.1 percent to 0.3 percent, the stock and bond markets
retreated. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks dropped
20.55 to 2,593.81, closing out the week with a net gain of 3.71
points. Interest rates rose in the bond market, with long-term
government bonds falling $5 for each $1,0wd, searching handbags and clothing
for weapons but there were no incidents. To the chants of
``Hallelujah!'' people carried placards reading ``Aristide Will
Save Haiti'' and sang: ``It's you we're looking for. Now ... we are
saved.''
   Aristide, carrying poinsettas, was mobbed by a throng of
screaming fans before he briefly addressed the crowd.
   ``We are the flowers of brotherhood,'' he said. ``We are
carrying the flowers to victory.''
   Haiti has been ruled by dictators virtually since it won
independence from France in 1804 and established the world's first
black republic. Two elections held the past four years have been
rigged or halted because of violence.
   But many Haitians said Friday they believed foreign observers
would make a difference this time.
   ``Even if 100 people get killed, the election will go on,'' said
Jean-Claude Bajeux, a civil rights activist who spent many years in
exile during the Duvalier family dictatorship.
   About 3 million people are registered to vote for president,
bicameral legislature, mayors and county officials. The government
has set up 14,500 polling places, and they will be open from 6 a.m.
to 6 p.m. Sunday.
   The elections gained new vigor a month ago when Aristide
declared his candidacy. He is the favorite of the poor who make up
most of this Caribbean nation's 6 million residents.
   An advocate of liberation theology, or church involvement in the
struggles of the poor, Aristide was expelled from the Salesian
order in 1988 for allegedly fomenting revolution.
   He remains a priest, however, and has said he would renounce the
priesthood to comply with Vatican rules against holding public
office if he wins the election.
   Marc Bazin, a former World Bank economist and finance minister
fired by the dictatorial Duvalier regime for investigating
corruption, is believed to be the favorite of the middle class. He
has a considerable following in the countryside.
   Bazin campaigned Friday in the mountain town of Tomassin,
overlooking the wealthy suburb of Petionville.
   ``People like me, a working man, will vote for Aristide because
he stands for change,'' said a street vendor who would only give
his first name, Antoine. ``The bourgeoise will vote for Bazin.''
   Election observers from the United Nations, Organization of
American States and the Caribbean Economic Community will monitor
the vote.
   Former President Jimmy Carter, who has monitored elections in
Panama and Nicaragua, arrived Friday afternoon with a team of 34
observers from the Council of Freely Elected Heads of Government.
   President Bush sent former Gov. William Janklow of South Dakota
as head of an eight-member U.S. government delegation.
   ``The election in Haiti offers a historic opportunity for the
Haitian people to freely choose their leaders after decades of
dictatorship,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   At the request of the interim government of President
Ertha-Pascal Trouillot, the United Nations sent 64 unarmed military
advisers to work with Haiti's notoriously ill-disciplined army to
prevent election violence.
   Until 1986, the Duvalier family enforced its rule for 29 years
with the help of a brutal private militia known as the Tonton
Macoutes.
   The dictatorship ended in 1986 after Jean-Claude Duvalier fled
to exile in France.
   Many holdovers from the Duvalier regime have remained intent on
keeping their hold on power and have sabotaged elections twice
since Jean-Claude was deposed.
   The elections in 1987 were aborted after army-backed thugs
massacred 34 voters at the polls. The army dissolved the
independent Electoral Council and held rigged elections in 1988.
   There has been relatively little violence during this year's
campaign.
   Fears of a bloody election were heightened on Dec. 5 when
unidentified assailants threw a grenade and opened fire on people
leaving an Aristide rally, killing seven and wounding more than 50
others.
   Aristide blamed the attack on Roger Lafontant, self-proclaimed
chief of the Tonton Macoutes and avid Duvalier supporter, and
demanded his arrest. Lafontant denied his involvement.
   Lafontant returned from exile to run for president, but was
disqualified on technicalities by the Electoral Council.
   He said this week he was the head of the Tonton Macoutes and the
Duvalierist movement, and that he was determined to keep Aristide
from becoming president.

<HEAD>Motorola To Build Next-Generation Chips With Toshiba</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SCHAUMBURG, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motorola Inc. will produce its next
generation of computer memory chips in Japan under a joint venture
with Japanese electronics manufacturer Toshiba, a spokesman said
Friday.
   The four-megabit dynamic random access memory chips will be
manufactured at a factory in Sendai, Japan, that is co-owned by
Motorola and Toshiba - rather than at Motorola's new chip plant in
Austin, Texas, said Motorola spokesman Dan Rogers.
   When production of the dynamic RAM, or D-RAM, chips begins in
the third quarter of 1991, it will mark the first time Motorola
will offer that particular chip in large quantities, Rogers said.
   The demand for faster computers has spurred a growing demand for
another type of semiconductor, static random access memory chips,
which are even faster than the dynamic RAM chips to be produced in
Japan.
   Motorola, based in this northwest Chicago suburb, decided to
build the dynamic RAM chips in Japan, and use its MOS-11 factory in
Austin to produce static RAM chips beginning in 1992, the company
said in a news release.
   ``Rapidly increasing demand worldwide for our ... fast static
RAMs and microprocessors is straining our existing production
capacity, so MOS-11 will be used to meet this need,'' said Jim
George, vice president of Motorola's MOS Memory Products Division
in Austin.
   Static RAM chips are more expensive to produce but are four
times faster than a dynamic RAM chip of equal memory. That speed
makes the static RAM chips desirable for computers used in the
workplace, an industry analyst said.
   ``There is a definite demand for static RAMs, which are
potentially more profitable than dynamic RAMS. The demand for that
high-speed static RAM is growing by leaps and bounds,'' said
Millard Phelps, an analyst at the San Francisco investment firm
Hambrecht &amp; Quist.
   Motorola entered a long-term agreement with Toshiba in 1986 to
produce dynamic RAM chips.
   ``We are not going to be a leader in the D-RAM industry. The
Japanese have taken over that market,'' Rogers said. ``That's why
we've gone into a partnership agreement rather than going out on
our own. It's a very expensive business to be in.''
   Toshiba officials dismissed as speculation published reports
that they pressured Motorola into producing the dynamic RAM chip in
Japan.
   ``We never mentioned to Motorola that Toshiba didn't want
Motorola to produce the chip in the United States. If Motorola
wanted to make the chip there, it could have. It's their decision,
not ours,'' said Tedsou Kadoya, general manager of public
communications for Toshiba America Inc.
   Motorola also produces computers, pagers, cellular phones,
two-way radios, and defense and aerospace electronics.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar registered a mixed showing against
foreign currencies on Friday amid new doubts over whether
diplomatic talks between the United States and Iraq would succeed.
   Gold was higher. But silver prices sank below $4 an ounce on the
lack of decisive war moves and a large selloff by institutional
investors. Over the past few days, silver has traded at the lowest
price levels in 16 years.
   The dollar strengthened as traders anticipated Middle East
saber-rattling from President Bush at a news conference, but the
currency eased in value when Bush's comments showed he wasn't yet
ready to scrap the diplomacy option.
   Bush scolded Saddam Hussein for failing to agree on a date for
Secretary of State James A. Baker III's diplomatic trip to Baghdad.
   ``The dollar came off a little bit after overanticipating,''
said Francoise Soares-Kemp, manager of the corporate advisory desk
at Credit Suisse in New York. ``Bush was tough but he didn't
declare war in the next 24 hours.''
   Overall the dollar gained against the yen, which is generally
weakened on Middle East war fears because Japan's economy is so
dependent on imported oil.
   The dollar closed at 132.85 yen in New York, up from late
Thursday's 132.17. In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.57 yen to a closing
131.87 yen and later in London, it was quoted at 132.85 yen.
   Jitters in Eastern Europe, particularly unrest in Albania,
pumped up the dollar against European currencies.
   ``There is some concern about European prospects with all this
pressure on their Eastern borders,'' said Soares-Kemp. ``This takes
some of the pressure off the dollar.''
   The dollar moved slightly higher against the German mark,
closing at 1.4825 marks compared to late Thursday's 1.4790. In
London, the dollar was quoted at 1.4845 German marks, up from
1.4805 marks late Thursday.
   But the dollar also strengthened against the British pound in
New York, with sterling weakening to $1.9370 from late Thursday's
$1.9450. In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9390, down
from $1.9440 late Thursday.
   Brokers said the dollar also got support from the 0.5 percent
rise in the U.S. producer price index for November, when a gain of
only 0.1 percent was expected. The poor performance suggested the
Federal Reserve may have less room to lower interest rates, traders
said.
   Higher interest rates generally make a currency more attractive.
   Beneath it all, though, the market retained a bearish tone amid
the potential for outside events, including the declining U.S.
economy, to weaken the dollar.
   ``There is room for the dollar to go lower, from both an
economic standpoint and also if peace breaks out in the Middle
East,'' said Jack Barbanel, managing director for First Global
Asset Management Inc.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's
prices, included: 1.2735 Swiss francs, up from 1.2660; 5.0405
French francs, up from 5.0255; 1,119.75 Italian lire, up from
1,115.25; and 1.1583 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1607.
   Other late dollar rates, compared with late Thursday, included:
1.2730 Swiss francs, up from 1.2660; 5.0475 French francs, up from
5.0305; 1.6745 Dutch guilders, up from 1.6700; 1,121.25 Italian
lire, up from 1,115.75; and 1.1594 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1595.
   Gold rose in New York, closing up $2.40 a troy ounce to $376.70
on the Commodity Exchange. Republic National Bank later quoted a
bid of $375.75, up $2.40 from late Thursday.
   In London earlier, the precious metal traded at $373.75 per
ounce, up from $372.25 bid per ounce late Thursday. In Zurich, the
bid price was $373.25, up from $372.25 late Thursday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose 76 cents to close at a bid
$374.24 per ounce.
   Silver plunged on the New York Commodity Exchange, closing down
6.9 cents to $3.937. In London, silver traded at a bid price of
$3.97 a troy ounce, down from Thursday's $4.02.

<HEAD>Insurers Should Help Pay Court-Ordered Damages, Lawsuit Contends</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM F. RAWSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Charles Keating Jr.'s insurance companies should
be required to pay part of any court-ordered damages arising from
the collapse of Keating's financial empire, a class-action lawsuit
contends.
   The suit was filed in U.S. District Court by the federal
government and investors in Keating's Phoenix-based American
Continental Corp. It contends that 21 insurance companies are
liable for as much as $110 million.
   The policies ``impose an obligation on the respective insurance
company defendants to provide insurance coverage for the acts of
the insured defendants that caused damage and losses to the
plaintiffs,'' the lawsuit says.
   The suit asks that the court to ``determine immediately the
scope and amount of coverage'' the policies provide.
   The suit was filed by four investors and the Resolution Trust
Corp., the federal agency empowered to dispose of the assets of
failed savings and loans. It was brought on behalf of more than
20,000 people who bought American Continental junk bonds through
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, Keating's California-based
thrift.
   Federal regulators seized Lincoln Savings in April 1989, one day
after American Continental and 11 of the thrift's subsidiaries
filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   Keating, members of his family and his former top executives are
defendants in lawsuits filed by the government and investors
seeking more than $1.3 billion in damages.
   The federal government is seeking $1.1 billion in a fraud and
racketeering suit that blames Keating and his associates for the
failure of Lincoln Savings.
   In a separate suit, more than 17,000 investors who put about
$200 million into American Continental securities are demanding
their money back.
   The 21 insurance companies named as defendants in the
class-action suit filed Thursday sold policies covering actions
taken by Keating and his executives that can be tied to the
collapse of American Continental and Lincoln Savings, according to
the suit.
   The insurance companies contend that some of the policies are
``self consuming,'' which means the proceeds are being used to pay
the legal bills run up by Keating and the others in various civil
suits.
   The lawsuit argues, however, that policy provisions that allow
deductions for legal fees are vague, ambiguous and unenforceable.
   ``As a result of this dispute, proceeds of certain policies are
wasting and elderly plaintiffs are losing their rights to certain
recoveries,'' the lawsuit says. ``Unless this court determines the
rights and obligations of the parties, many of the insurance
policies may be wasted or diminished to zero ...''
   A federal judge last May ordered National Union Fire Insurance
Co. of Pittsburgh, one of the insurance companies, to pay for legal
bills of Keating and his associates under two of its policies.
   The investors requested each insurer last May to deposit the
amount of the policies into interest-bearing accounts to pay any
court-awarded damages. But the companies have been reluctant to do
so, the suit contends.
   The suit was assigned to Judge Richard Bilby and probably will
be consolidated with other pending Keating suits, according to the
court clerk's office.

   Beleaguered Eastern Airlines continued as
recently as last month to falsify vital safety and maintenance
records, according to a confidential informant cited in a
government document unsealed Friday.
   Eastern angrily denied the charges contained in the document, an
affidavit to support a law-enforcement raid earlier this month on
Eastern's Miami headquarters. It details a lengthy pattern of
doctoring safety logs and other records to keep the airline's jets
in the air.
   Release of the document was a public-relations setback for
Eastern, which has been operating under bankruptcy court protection
since March 1989 because of a strike that has still not been
resolved.
   Eastern insisted there has been no conspiracy to cut corners on
safety, as the government has charged in a criminal case in
Brooklyn.
   In response to the latest allegations, Eastern's court-appointed
trustee, Martin R. Shugrue Jr., said that the government has a
``personal vendetta'' against him and ``a vendetta against the
company.''
   Eastern has continued to lose enormous amounts of money but
Shugrue has predicted the troubled carrier will start breaking even
sometime next year. Shugrue has been leading an aggressive
publicity campaign for Eastern in attempt to win more customers.
   During a Miami news conference Friday, Shugrue was visibly
shaking. His voice rose in anger at times as he accused the
government of embarking on a ``headline-hunting exercise'' to
damage Eastern.
   Eastern said ``the FAA's most recent inspections revealed that
Eastern was safe and that there was no evidence to suggest that
maintenance records were being falsified.''
   The airline said that based on its own investigation of specific
allegations it was confident that a grand jury would agree ``that
the charges contained in the affidavit are without merit.''
   Federal investigators armed with a search warrant went into
Eastern's offices on Dec. 1 and carried out boxes of documents and
computer records, according to Andrew J. Maloney, U.S. attorney for
the Eastern District of New York.
   According to a confidential informant, Eastern ``supervisors are
under so much pressure to avoid delays that record falsification is
the norm,'' the affidavit said.
   Maintenance workers at Hartsfield Airport in Atlanta routinely
falsified log books to hide faulty navigation, radar and other
electronic equipment, as well as bad tires and windshields that
leaked air, informants were quoted by investigators as saying in
the document.
   Confidential informants told investigators that ``flight delays
caused by necessary repairs or maintenance were simply not
tolerated by Eastern's upper management,'' the document said.
   One confidential informant in Atlanta said ``he witnessed
supervisors on almost a daily basis falsifying log books to make it
appear that inoperative cockpit instruments had been repaired when
in reality they had not been repaired,'' the affidavit said.
   In a point-by-point denial of the allegations, Eastern said it
believed much of the information had come from 13 machinists, nine
of whom have been on strike since 1989. Some of the information
came from an employee who had been involved a dispute with the
company over a disciplinary action, Eastern said.
   Last Friday, U.S. District Judge I. Leo Glasser of Brooklyn
ruled the affidavit unsealed Friday should be made public. However,
he put his ruling on hold to allow Eastern a chance to appeal.
   The appeal went before a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of
Appeals in Manhattan on Thursday. The appelate court ruled Friday
that the document should be made public.
   In July, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn filed criminal charges
against Eastern, alleging a pattern of falsifying safety records
and other maintenance documents to keep its jets in the air.
   The airline and several of its top managers are scheduled to be
tried next year.
   Travel agents said Eastern's bookings are not likely to
immediately fall off after Friday's disclosure of the affidavit,
although news stories about the document could raise concerns among
some travelers.
   ``Very often, we tend to see that unless there's some very
dramatic and negative aspect to some carrier, that what seems to
drive the consumer more than any other factor is the price,'' said
H. Wayne Berens, president of Revere Travel Inc., in Trenton, N.J.
   Berens said many of his customers who have flown Eastern
recently believe they have gotten good value.

<TEXT>
   President Bush said Friday he would nominate
Rep. Lynn Martin of Illinois to head the Labor Department, choosing
a longtime friend who lost her congressional seat last month in a
failed Senate bid.
   The choice of Martin to replace Elizabeth Dole, who resigned to
head the American Red Cross, will assure the continuing presence of
at least one woman in Bush's Cabinet.
   Another congresswoman defeated in an effort to unseat a
Democratic senator, Patricia Saiki of Hawaii, is considered a
frontrunner for the top position at the Education Department, where
Lauro Cavazos was forced to resign this week.
   Bush called Martin, 51, a ``distinguished public servant and
cherished friend.'' The president was scheduled to meet with Martin
at the White House on Monday.
   The announcement got a somewhat chillier reception from labor
leaders. Lane Kirkland, president of the 14.2 million-member
AFL-CIO, said that during her 10-year tenure in Congress her voting
record ``has not reflected a sensitivity to the needs of workers.''
   Bush's announcement, made hastily before he boarded a helicopter
for Camp David, Md., appeared designed to end a week of turmoil
within the administration on a positive note.
   Cavazos resigned Wednesday - after being told to leave by White
House Chief of Staff John Sununu, according to administration
sources. And Bush's choice as the new Republican Party chairman,
William Bennett, bowed out Thursday when he found out how
drastically new ethics rules would limit his outside income.
   Martin, in Illinois on Friday, was informed only an hour ahead
of the formal announcement that she had landed the job, an
administration source said. Martin declined to be interviewed, but
issued a brief statement saying her nomination was ``a high
honor.''
   ``I look forward to appearing before the Senate for the upcoming
confirmation hearings,'' she said, thanking Bush for his
``confidence and support.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., whose Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee will hold Martin's confirmation hearings,
commended her on her nomination. He said the department needs
someone who could ``stand up for hard-pressed families against the
constant pro-business tilt of the White House.''
   In making his announcement, Bush said Martin had served as an
``unofficial adviser'' to him on legislative matters in the past.
   She backed him in his first presidential bid in 1980, helped him
prepare for his vice presidential debate with Democrat Geraldine
Ferraro in 1984 and was a national co-chairman of his presidential
campaign two years ago.
   It was also apparent that Bush felt he owed her something for
her party loyalty in giving up a safe House seat to make the uphill
bid against Sen. Paul Simon. She had been passed over in Bush's
first round of Cabinet appointments after the 1988 election, partly
because of her own interest in the Senate.
   ``She's a mother who knows the need for child care. She's a
professional who understands the business-labor relationship. And,
as a congresswoman, she spent years dealing with the concerns and
aspirations of the working Americans from every walk of life,''
Bush said.
   Rep. Saiki had also been considered in the running for the labor
post, as well as for the education slot.
   Martin and Saiki were seen as likely nominees for several
reasons, political analysts said. They are women; they are seen as
being owed something because they gave up House seats with Bush's
encouragement to make the Senate bids; and, as Capitol veterans,
they could help him push administration policy in Congress.
   In addition, Saiki, an Asian-American, would add a minority
member to a Cabinet that lost Cavazos, a Hispanic-American.
   Besides the Cabinet openings before Bush this week, the
high-profile job of RNC chairman was added to the equation when
Bennett, the former drug policy director, said he'd changed his
mind about taking the job.
   Three Cabinet secretaries are among those frequently mentioned
as contenders for the RNC post - Samuel Skinner of Transportation,
Robert Mosbacher of Commerce and Jack Kemp of Housing and Urban
Development - along with former Rep. Thomas Loeffler of Texas and
longtime Bush campaign strategist Rich Bond.
   If Skinner, Mosbacher or Kemp took the job, that would give Bush
yet another Cabinet opening to fill.
   Besides Saiki, those also considered potential choices for
education secretary include Lynne Cheney, chairwoman of the
National Endowment for the Humanities; former New Jersey Gov.
Thomas Kean, now president of Drew University, and former Tennessee
Gov. Lamar Alexander, now president of the University of Tennessee.
Cheney, the wife of Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, has also been
mentioned as a candidate for the Labor post.
   Martin has never had a close alliance with organized labor.
According to the AFL-CIO's scorecard, she voted ``right'' on
workers' issues 29 percent of the time.
   When Bush tapped Mrs. Dole for the labor post two years ago, his
action was seen as a way for Republicans to mend fences with
organized labor leaders who had had a hostile relationship with the
Reagan administration.
   Analysts say more Cabinet changes might follow soon. Kemp,
Skinner and Mosbacher are all said to be itchy, as well as Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh.

   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and the U.S.

phone lines and digital fax machines, the companies announced
Friday.
   Under the one-year pact, the two companies will share sales

   The plan will involve AT&amp;T's digital phone service called

   Digital fax machines transmit documents in the ones and zeros of
computer code, which eliminates most distortion that can be
introduced into conventional analog transmissions. The machines are
designed for use with digital phone lines.

<HEAD>Prices Fall on Inflationary News</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   News of higher wholesale prices and troubles
facing Middle East peace talks sent bond prices skidding for a
second day Friday.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was down 25-32 point, or
$7.81 per $1,000 in face amount, at closing. Its yield, which rises
when prices fall, was up to 8.18 percent from 8.12 percent late
Thursday.
   ``The market kind of got blindsided by a worse-than-expected
(producer price index) report. That kind of rattled people. I
expect the president's press conference did likewise,'' said Bud
Sturm, senior economist for Fuji Securities Inc. in Chicago.
   Government economic data showed wholesale prices, excluding the
food and energy categories, rose a higher-than-expected 0.5 percent
in November after no change in October. Inflation generally erodes
the value of government securities such as bonds and notes.
   At a White House news conference, President Bush said planned
peace talks with Iraq are on hold because of a problems in setting
a date with Iraq for peace talks.
   Traders said prices also dropped following hawkish testimony by
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney before the House Armed Services
Committee. Cheney said that if the economic attempts and diplomatic
efforts to solve the crisis fail, the United States must have the
option of using force to oust Iraq from Kuwait. The bond market's
decline came after a sharp three-day rally that began last week
following announcement of a 5.9 percent unemployment rate for
November.
   ``I think today's market reaction gives some indication of how
far the market got ahead of itself over the last week,'' said
Sturm.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-term
maturities were down 1-16 point to \ point, intermediate maturities
fell 5-16 point to 15-32 point and long-term issues lost 7-16 point
to 25-32 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service
reported.
   The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, was down 3.70 to 1,185.93.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.06 percent as the
discount was up 2 basis point to 6.85 percent. Yields on six-month
bills were up to 7.07 as the discount rose 6 basis points to 6.75
percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 7.08 percent as the
discount was up 4 basis points to 6.64 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 7 5-16 percent late Friday, up from 7\ Thursday.
   Don Fine, chief market economist for Chase Manhattan Bank, said
he believes the Federal Reserve will drop the federal funds rate to
7 percent within the next couple of weeks.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 7-32 point to 91}. The average yield to
maturity was up to 7.47 percent from 7.45 percent late Thursday.

<HEAD>Bleak Economic Picture Depress Silver, Platinum</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Silver and platinum prices fell Friday on New York's Commodity
Exchange as the latest economic indicators pointed to a severe
slump in the manufacturing sector.
   On other markets, grains and soybeans were higher; livestock,
pork and energy futures were mixed; and gold was higher.
   Silver and platinum futures plunged on news from the Federal
Reserve that industrial production plunged 1.7 percent in November,
the steepest drop since the last recession in 1982.
   ``That makes for a very weak industrial future,'' analyst Jim
Steel of Refco Inc. in New York said. ``It means demand for
industrial metals, silver and platinum supplies are not as great.
But it will remain weak.''
   Silver has been on a downward slide since the start of the year,
as traders looked upon it increasingly as an industrial metal. A
large percentage of silver is used by the film industry. It also is
used by telecommunications companies and defense manufacturers.
   There are abundant supplies of silver, but platinum supplies are
not as high. Platinum is a key component of catalytic converters,
an automobile pollution control device, and in the aerospace
industry.
   Silver settled 6.9 cents to 7.7 cents lower with the contract
for delivery in December at $3.937 a troy ounce. Platinum was $2.30
to $3 lower with January at $412.20 a troy ounce.
   Gold futures moved in the opposite direction of silver and
platinum, supported by a surge of oil prices early in the day. A
stronger dollar and silver's weakness capped on gold's advance.
   Gold was $2.40 to $3.30 higher with February at $378.60 a troy
ounce.
   Crude oil futures gave up much of a $1.68 gain in a late
retreat, as President Bush was less aggressive than expected in
discussing the Gulf crisis during an afternoon news conference.
   Analysts said there was expectation Bush would cancel talks with
Iraq because of disagreement over the date for a planned meeting
between Secretary of State James Baker and Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
   Light sweet crude was 27 cents lower to 13 cents higher with
January at $26.55 a barrel; heating oil was .23 cent to 1.09 cents
higher with January at 75.24 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.60 cent lower to .61 cent higher with January at 66.18 cents a
gallon; natural gas was unchanged to .042 cent higher with January
at $2.262 per 1,000 cubic feet.
   Grain and soybean futures prices were slightly higher in
lackluster trading on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Traders were wary of taking positions pending an announcement of
a list of commodities the Soviet Union will buy with $500 million
to $1 billion in export credits, analyst Joel Karlin of Research
Department Inc. said.
   Corn futures came under pressure with news that South Korea made
a major purchase of Chinese corn.
   Wheat futures were boosted by a decision of the U.S. Agriculture
Department to allow producers to place up to 300 million bushels of
wheat in the farmer-owned reserve. The decision was made because of
concern over falling prices and lagging exports.
   Wheat was 1{ cents lower to } cent higher with December at $2.53
a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1\ cents higher with December at
$2.23\ a bushel; oats were a { cent higher with December at $1.08{
a bushel; soybeans were { cent to 1{ cents higher with January at
$5.88{ a bushel.
   Livestock futures were higher and pork futures were mixed on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Hog futures gained on higher cash prices and views that a sharp
sell-off Thursday was overdone. Pork belly futures were lower on
technical selling.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .38 cent higher with December at
80.97 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .32 cent higher
with January at 89.17 cents a pound; live hogs were .22 cent to
1.07 cents higher with December at 50.67 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .10 cent to .72 cent lower with February at 64.20
cents a pound.

   NEW YORK (AP) - NCR Corp.'s directors unanimously rejected
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s $90-a-share cash tender offer
for the computer maker, and alleged the phone company had violated
securities laws.
   In a statement, NCR on Friday called the hostile takeover bid
``grossly inadequate and unfair.''
   The move by NCR's board appears to set the stage for AT&amp;T to
escalate its bid. Industry analysts say the phone company may
launch a proxy fight to try to unseat NCR's directors, a step AT&amp;T
says it has considered.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Wholesale prices rose 0.5 percent in November,
the government said. Analysts called it a disturbingly high
increase at a time when the economy is slumping and energy costs
are moderating.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Friday U.S.
manufacturing had suffered its steepest one-month plunge in eight
years.

   DETROIT (AP) - California billionaire Kirk Kerkorian has bought
9.8 percent of the stock of Chrysler Corp. for about $272 million.
That makes him the company's largest shareholder and prompts the
struggling automaker to beef up its takeover defenses.
   A statement issued through a Los Angeles public relations agency
said the purchase was made as an investment. Chrysler spokesman
Arthur Liebler confirmed that a discussion took place last week
between Kerkorian, of Beverly Hills, Calif., and Chrysler Chairman
Lee Iacocca.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Most of the nation's largest banks are
teetering on the brink of insolvency and tax money must quickly be
injected into the government fund insuring deposits, warns a
congressional report due out Monday.
   Bank failure costs could total $63 billion in a severe
recession, it said. Even the mild downturn expected by most
economists would leave the fund short of cash, said the report,
which was written by three economists at the request of a
congressional subcommittee.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Tribune Co. said its operating profit will slide
substantially more than 25 percent this year because of the weak
advertising climate and rising costs of a strike at its New York
Daily News.
   Company executives on Friday failed to specify how much the
seven-week-old strike by nine of the 10 labor unions at the
newspaper is costing. The paper has continued to publish despite
the strike although circulation is down sharply.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Beleaguered Eastern Airlines continued as
recently as last month to falsify vital safety and maintenance
records, according to a confidential informant cited in a
government document.
   Eastern on Friday angrily denied the charges contained in the
document, an affidavit to support a law-enforcement raid earlier
this month on Eastern's Miami headquarters. It details a lengthy
pattern of doctoring safety logs and other records to keep the
airline's jets in the air.

   DALLAS (AP) - Southland Corp.'s bankruptcy plan confirmation
hearing began with attorneys clashing over efforts by the parent of
the 7-Eleven convenience store chain to disclose reorganization
options.
   Southland filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in October with a
``prepackaged'' plan already approved by most of its creditors.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harold Abramson must confirm the plan for it
to take effect.
   Abramson said Friday he would first hear arguments over
Southland's attempts to inform creditors of the Dallas-based
company's financial condition and options, then hear arguments on
the merits of the reorganization plan. The hearing is expected to
last for several weeks.

   PHOENIX (AP) - Charles Keating Jr.'s insurance companies should
be required to pay part of any court-ordered damages arising from
the collapse of Keating's financial empire, a class-action lawsuit
contends.
   The suit was filed in U.S. District Court by the federal
government and investors in Keating's Phoenix-based American
Continental Corp. It contends that 21 insurance companies are
liable for as much as $110 million.
   The policies ``impose an obligation on the respective insurance
company defendants to provide insurance coverage for the acts of
the insured defendants that caused damage and losses to the
plaintiffs,'' the lawsuit says.

   Donald Trump's Taj Mahal Casino
Resort met an extended deadline Friday to throw together a
restructuring agreement and hand it over to state gaming
regulators.
   The developer's other two casinos face deadlines Saturday to
make bond payments. Analysts said one - the Trump Castle - probably
wouldn't make its $18.4 million payment.
   The Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino was likely to make its $16.1
million bond payment, they said. Both are due by midnight Saturday.
   The Philadelphia Inquirer reported in Friday editions that Trump
Plaza has just $17 million in the bank and Trump Castle has only
$18 million handy. Failure to make payments could throw the casinos
in default and perhaps put them under the protection of bankruptcy
court.
   Ed Tracy, the head of Trump's three Atlantic City casinos and
one non-casino hotel, would not comment on the status of the bond
payments. Ten-day grace periods to pay the bonds would not start
until Monday, Tracy said.
   ``When we have something to say, we'll say it,'' Tracy said.
   The state Casino Control Commission is only immediately
concerned with the financial stability of the Taj Mahal and the
``pre-packaged'' bankruptcy plan it intends to file and leave by
the spring. The commission has said it will likely look at the
financial stability of the other two properties later.
   Friday's meeting began 1 hour and 40 minutes late as documents
arrived at the last minute by facsimile machine. Attorneys from the
state, the Trump Organization, Taj Mahal bondholders, Taj Mahal
subcontractors and banks sought to make sure they all agreed on the
final terms of the documents.
   Commission chairman Steve Perskie stressed, as he had in two
previous hearings, that delay in producing the Taj Mahal documents
could threaten the license of the 8{-month-old casino, the
glitziest in Atlantic City. He had extended his Wednesday deadline
for the deal's supporting documents until Friday.
   ``I am satisfied that with the submission of documents ... the
licensee and other participants have met the conditions imposed by
the commission,'' Perskie said.
   ``The commission recognizes that a lot of people have lost a lot
of sleep. Tempers might have been frayed and tensions might have
been high,'' he said. ``But the public interest is served by
certainty. The schedule was neither arbitrary, unfair nor as it
turns out unreasonable.''
   State law makes the commission responsible for ensuring that
each casino licensee remains financially stable. The commission has
the power to take away a license.
   The casino commission wants to see the overall agreement by next
Wednesday. Trump officials have said they intend to file that with
the federal Securities and Exchange Commission by Monday.
   Perskie said he would rule Monday whether documents detailing
the restructuring agreement should be released to the public. Other
documents, including certificates of incorporation and new bylaws,
were made public.
   The Taj Mahal failed to make a $47.3 million payment due Nov. 15
to bondholders, only to reach a restructuring deal the day after.
   The restructuring reduces the interest rate on the $675 million
in bonds from 14 percent to 12 percent, spreads their repayment
date over ten years instead of eight and gives bondholders half
ownership in the Taj Mahal.
   Trump, who has not attended the hearings, can raise his 50
percent ownership to up to 80 percent if he can repay the bonds at
rates higher than the restructured 12 percent.
   The Taj Mahal has set gross gaming records since its opening.
   But it has failed to consistently make the $1.3 million a day
that analysts said it needed to break even.
   In a market already weakened by the recession, the Taj Mahal has
siphoned away gaming business from the 11 other casinos, including
Trump's other two properties.
   Raymond Neidl, a bond analyst with Dillon Read &amp; Co. in New
York, said it does not appear Trump Castle would make its payment,
leaving open the possibility of a restructuring or bankruptcy.
   ``The market is assuming the payment is not going to be made,''
Neidl said.
   He said the situation looked better for Trump Plaza, which is in
the center of the Boardwalk area and is considered a more
attractive propoerty than the Trump Castle.

<HEAD>Paper Maker To Charge $212 Million Against Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Paper Co. said Friday it was
charging $212 million against fourth-quarter earnings for costs
associated with scaling down operations and installating
environmental controls.
   The reserve fund is equal to $137 million after taxes, or $1.26
per share, the company said. International Paper reported $546
million in earnings, or $5.01 per share, in the first nine months
of 1990.
   International Paper Chairman John A. Georges said the sale and
liquidation of company assets would improve the company's earnings
and cash flow during and after 1991.
   Asset sales were expected to generate up to $200 million in
after-tax proceeds over the next three years, the company said.
   International Paper is a worldwide producer of paper and forest
products with manufacturing operations in 22 countries.
   The company did not identify which facilities and business units
it was selling, but said they either were not strategically
important or not generating enough return on investment.
   Two-thirds of the fourth-quarter charge is to pay costs
associated with the asset sales, the company said. The remainder is
earmarked for paying for environmental controls at several
wood-treating plants and for personnel costs associated with
consolidation and improved productivity.
